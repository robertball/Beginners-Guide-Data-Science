Hands down the best scones I have ever made.  Better than my culinary school recipes.  I reduced the b.p. by 1 tsp.  The trick to scones is not to over mix the dough.  After you "rub" the butter into the dry ingredients , place the bowl in the freezer for a few minutes to re-solidify the butter.  Add the wet to the dry and mix just until combined. Thanks for sharing

I made serveral batches of these for a holiday tea.  I found that freezing the butter and grating it into the flour mixture was easier than using a pastry blender with soft butter and the result was just as delicious.  This is a terrific recipe for scones!

It's all in the texture and what you add to the final dough- maybe some mixed berries and white chocolate chunks! And after eggwashing the tops prior to baking try sprinkling a generous amount of coarse sugar. Or if you want to go savory, try some herbs and small cubes of a nice cheese- say chopped chives, bit of basil and oregano and chunks of gouda or edam. Instead of the sugar topping obviously something like some shredded cheese or sesame seeds would be more appropriate.

These scones really ARE the best scones I've ever had, and I used to be a professional pastry chef.

I made a few minor changes to adjust them to what I was looking for- I added vanilla, substituted white and semi-sweet chocolate chips for the currants, and left off the egg wash. And I just pulled  the dough apart into 8 pieces (the way I used to at the bakery) and baked them that way, without shaping them.  After they came out of the oven, I drizzled them with a vanilla/confectioner's sugar icing.  Thy were very sweet this way, but just what I was looking for. The sour cream gave them a great flavor and texture,

Truly delicious scones!  Only my 2nd attempt to make them (first attempt was 20 years ago and not very successful).  These turned out great but were not exactly like the submitted recipe.  I had recently eaten an orange cranberry scone at a Fresh Market and loved it and was trying to duplicate the flavor.  These are even better!  My changes included subbing orange Craisins and adding 1 1/2 tsp. orange zest, lite sour cream, fat-free evaporated milk (for richness), and omitting the egg wash.  They were so soft that I dropped them - 12 - onto a parchment lined baking sheet and sprinkled them with natural sugar crystals.  Fabulous!  They were full of flavor, not heavy, and crunchy on the outside.  My husband tasted them and has requested one with his lunch today (his first scone).  Next tiime, I will make 24 smaller scones and share them with friends.  This is not scone country so they will be a novelty!

Wow! I just tried this recipe based on the rave reviews and it is by far the best scone recipe I have EVER had! (and I'm not just saying that because I baked them. :) ).... Restaurant or home, these are the best I've tasted. And TRUST me. I've had many. At tea shops and at home. I've tried TONS of recipes and this IS the best. This recipe is amazing! It is foolproof unless? perhaps you are a really inexperienced baker? These were AWESOME! :)

Fantastic!!  I got hooked on Starbuck's scones and these are better (and cheaper)!!  I made this the first time exactly as the recipe said, wonderful,  Secondtime I used orange essence dried cranberries and orange zest with an orange glaze.  I recommend this recipe very highly.

A little too sweet, which is why I didn't give them five stars. But a great basic recipe that's easy to adjust. I've used plain yogurt instead of the sour cream and buttermilk instead of the milk. You can also cut back on the butter to about 3 tablespoons and they still taste delicious. To avoid overworking the dough, I just put it in a cast iron skillet, cut it into wedges and bake it that way.

This scones were the BEST! One reviewer commented not used to scones being "light and fluffy" like these. Lots of bad scones are hard and dense! I'm a beginner baker and my first scones usually were! ha ha. These were great, perfect, I've been to London numerous times and these remind me of the scones we had in some nice hotels.

I've never made scones, the only ones I've had were hard and dry and heavy. The reviews were so great for these, I had to try! couldn't get to store so i used what I had: yogurt for sour cream, and heavy cream for milk, added orange zest, mini semisweet choc.chips. Worked the butter and flour mixt. w/hands and carefully incorporated the liquid ingrediants,not to overmix, by folding dough with spoon. pulled dough and dropped on sheet, brushed with egg/milk/vanilla wash, and sprinkled with raw sugar, cooked for 13min. They are perfect!! So Moist. They are all gone today.....  :(  Time to make more!  I will use sourcream and buttermilk next time per another review I read.    UPDATE: made ham/onion/cheddar/parmesian scones with a little salt/pepper/garlic powder.Used buttermilk and sour cream. dropped on parchment, cooked 14+min. OMG SO GOOD!  UPDATE #2: combos i've made: fresh raspberry/white choc.chip, orange/cranberry, lemon/blueberry, orange/choc.chip, Orange/spiced (cinnamon nutmeg ginger).   They are all fantastic!

This could be a very good recipe, if you did not use so much baking powder.  I first tried this recipe, omitting all baking powder, but using self-rising flour instead.  The scones turned our wonderfully then. Because they were so good I decided to bake more, this time following the recipe EXACTLY, and they all risen too much, and they had a horribly bitter after taste. I will still keep this recipe, but from now on I will only use self rising flour.

Wonderful scone recipe - I froze the butter and then grated it into the dry ingredients.  I doubled the amount of sugar, as I love a sweet scone.  I used half and half instead of milk and after the egg wash topped them off with raw sugar for that extra added crunch.  These come out of the oven beautiful, almost look too good to eat.

First time making scones and I think I used the right recipe! Made 4 batches yesterday morning for beach day and potluck here on the big island. Made 2 batches of sweet and 2 of savory. I did make some changes due to what I read in the reviews. For both I cut back 1 t of the baking powder and used 6T of butter. I also put the dough on my floured bread board and formed into a 3/4" thick round patty using my floured hands (the dough is very sticky!) and used my bench knife to cut the rounds into 8 pie shaped wedges. I sprayed Pam on my bench scraper to help keep the dough from sticking and deforming the scones. I then used a thin spatula to transfer the wedges to a baking sheet lightly sprayed with Pam. For the sweet scones I brushed on milk and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top for the plain ones and just sugar on top of the blueberry. The savory I left out the sugar, added herbs of choice, 1/2c each of finely dice ham and grated sharp cheddar. Did an egg wash and added more cheddar on top. They turned out soooo good! I wish I had realized how easy scones could be! Out of the 32 taken to the beach, zero came home and there was only about 12 people there!!

WOW!  This is a great scone recipe. Being from Scotland I have eaten lots of scones but have never been able to make a good one until now.  On my quest to finally make a good scone I chose this recipe to try and I am so glad that I did it is wonderful.  This is a very easy recipe and the scones come out perfectly.  I was tempted to reduce the amount of baking powder as suggested but I stuck to the recipe and had no metallic taste.  I am very sensitive to too much baking powder but it was fine for me and my family.  I made plain scones but added a little extra sugar.  I also dusted the tops with sugar prior to baking as others did.  My scones were light and fluffy with a slight crunch to the top, perfect with jam and clotted cream.  To some who have been unhappy with this recipe ensure that you use all purpose flour and not self-rising as self-rising has baking powder added.  Also a light hand is essential, that was my failing in the past, I handled this as little as possible and the scones were perfect.  Thank you, I can finally make scones!

This is my absolute GO-TO recipe for a comfort snack. I've tried several scone recipes, and this is BY FAR THE BEST! I followed the tips of "Care". I reduced the baking powder by 1tsp, cut the cold butter into tiny pieces, and mixed it in with my hands until it was pea size lumps. I popped that bowl in the freezer while I prepped my liquids- I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the liquids because I love vanilla, and then I added some chopped up belgian chocolate chunks, mixed the dry and wet together gently. I  added a dash of vanilla to the egg wash and then sprinkled raw sugar on them and these turned out PERFECT! Soft and fluffy, with a sweet scone shell on top- soooo yummy, I was trying to recreate some chocolate chip scones I used to eat at UC Davis when I was a student, and these are better!!! I make them ALL THE TIME!

Great scones. Decreased baking powder from 4 to 3 tsp. Used vanilla sugar for regular white sugar. 1/3 cup dried cranberries, unsweetened in place of currants and added 1/4 tsp. orange zest.   I used my food processor to blend dry ingredients. Cut frozen butter into small cubes and pulsed about 5 times in processor. Added milk and sour cream and pulsed 3-4 times. I mixed in the cranberries by hand as I pulled the dough out onto a floured board and then pinched off the dough to put onto baking sheet. Followed the rest of the directions as written.

The only thing I knew about scones was that it was a sort of dessert shaped like a pizza slice. Because of this recipe and its many positive reviews, I studied my scones before trying out this recipe for myself. (-:
Turns out that scones are a type of BREAD that can be in various shapes: round, like a biscuit, square, or a triangle and either lightly sweetened as a dessert or savory. 
After studying the facts, I pulled out my ingredients and worked through this recipe without any changes except for two things: I switched currants for some frozen strawberries and blueberries, and I froze my flour mixture for up to five minutes after rubbing in the butter. 

Since this was my first time making scones, I worried that I'd overmix the dough. So I purposely left large clumps of dough only slightly moistened.

Unexpectedly, the scones turned out fluffy! After having my first bite, I was smiling. This, my friend, was delicious. I doubt I'll be able to find a recipe as easy and good as this one, right here.

This is the best scones I have ever made.  They were just perfect.  I made two batches one with orange peel and 3 tablespoons orange juice and the other with dried cherries...fantastic. They were gone in no time. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

These are heavenly!  I've made them four times now, and they are always amazing.  The only time I used the egg wash on top was the first time; I prefer them without.  I really don't think I've had a better scone.  Also, I've made them with salted and unsalted butter ... both are good, just half the salt if you use salted butter.

These were AMAZING!!  I've made scones from another recipe on this site, but these are the best.  As others recommended, I put the flour mixture (after adding the butter) in the freezer for a few minutes so the butter could re-harden.  I also found it to be very important to spoon the flour into the cup, and to sift it as the recipe says.  You can't overmix them, or they will be crumbly.  I added dried cherries and a little vanilla and almond extract.  We LOVED them!!  I've given the recipe away to others already.  Thanks for this one!

I love these!  One time I made it they didn't rise right, but all other times they've been spectacular!  One time I didn't have the sour cream, so I subbed plain yogurt and they were jast as good!  I dust the top with sugar over the egg wash for a little extra sweetness and they're great!

Loved these scones!  My oldest son requested blueberry scones after tasting one at a bakery last week.  As I do with many new recipes I want to try, I came to Allrecipes.com to find just the right recipe.  I am so glad I did.  After tasting just one, my son quickly told me he would eat the entire batch!  (Of course, his eyes were bigger than his stomach.)  I doubled the recipe, but made 30 smaller scones out of the dough.  Instead of currants, I used frozen European (small) blueberries.  I also just pulled off pieces of dough, as a previous reviewer mentioned, and I sprinkled the tops with Florida Crystals sugar instead of using the egg wash.  I will be making these again, for sure.

A wonderful brunch bread!  For health/nutrition reasons I had to make modifications for a "Lite World's Best Scone" but they were still super and still a 'keeper.'   I substituted Splenda instead of sugar; Dash of salt instead of 1/8 teaspoon (because I used salted butter); craysins instead of raisins; 1% milk and reduced fat sour cream instead of full fat versions. When I mixed up and shaped dough I found it made 12 scones instead of 8, so that was helpful in reducing amount eaten at a sitting, yet they were each a generous biscuit size.  From a nutrition website I recalculated the following nutritional information per scone: Calories 145; Carbohydrates 20 g (Fiber .8 g);  Fat 6 g; Protein 3 g.

This recipe is exactly what I've been waiting for!!  I used to have afternoon tea in Albuquerque where they served the BEST scones.  I could never find them or the recipe anywhere else until I found this one.  I hate tough heavy scones that could pass as bricks (Starbucks) These are light, airy, and delicate with a touch of sweetness.  I left out the fruit, reduced the baking soda to 3 tsps, used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and brushed the egg wash on top before sprinkling sparkling sugar on top.  I left a few without the sugar to see how sweet the dough was and they were perfect!  I am catering and afternoon tea with my church and I can't wait to serve these to them!  Thanks!

Recently I have become cow milk protein allergic and can no longer have a Starbuck scone with my homemade lemon curd which is just about the most intense culinary experience that I have ever enjoyed.  OK, so I love lemon!  Anyway I wanted to have a scone this morning because I had some leftover lemon curd from yesterday's cheesecake effort, and was just going to suffer by purchasing a Starbuck's scone, when it occurred to me that I could make my own scones and substitute goat milk products and not have to suffer.  When Iwent online and asked for the best scone recipe ever, this recipe came up and I made it immediately with goat butter which I had in the freezer, goat milk and goat yogurt to substitute for the sour cream.  It was so amazing that I had to sit down and write this review. . . my first ever review.  The result topped any previous scone and lemon curd experience ever!  Even if you do not have a cow milk protein allergy using goat milk dairy products may be a new taste sensation that you would really enjoy.

These turned out fantastic! I made two batches: one using AP flour and one using Busquick mix without leavening agents. Both turned out identical. For both bathes I 1) substituted sour cream for yogurt (that's all I had) 2) added a few more tablespoons of sugar in the mix and 3) added course sugar to the tops. Oh yeah - 4) ate almost half of a batch!

I had been using another scone recipe I got from here on All Recipes. I thought it was the best, until I tried this one. Oh man these are good!! I'm deleting the other recipe from my recipe box and always using this one from now on!

wow. these are amazing! Of course, I can never follow a recipe--have to innovate, so i used whole wheat flour, buttermilk and sour cream (which made them require a bit more baking time), and lots of cinnamon.   Then I slathered with real butter and rose hips jam. Absolutely delicious, even if I had to use a fork. Mine were a bit softer, cause I was so afraid of over beating. :) Maybe next time they should be a tad tougher.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I thought these were good.  True, not too sweet but scones aren't.  I put blueberries in mine and sprinkled with sugar.  The dough was very sticky so you need to flour your hands well!  Mine stayed soft the next day because I stored them in a ziplock bag.  They weren't as good as the first day though! Just stop mixing as soon as the flour mixture is absorbed into the liquid and you'll be fine!

We've ate at the Savoy and visited Scotland so I just had to try this particular recipe. WOW! So light and tasty, the sour cream really adds to the flavor. I used cherry flavored dried cranberries and sprinkled sugar instead of the wash. I spooned 8 of them onto my greased cookie sheet as one would chocolate chip cookie dough. This helped to give them a little more crunchiness on top. Can't wait to try them on friends!

Totally FABULOUS!  I also added 1 tsp Watkins vanilla.  Realized I didn't have sour cream so I used Greek yogurt instead.  These are hands down A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Light, sweet, delicious scones! I make this recipe a lot for breakfast. They are also pretty good after freezing, which I like to do because it cuts down on morning prep time. I freeze them on a pan, separated (so they don't stick together), then after about 1/2 hour I throw them all into a zip lock back. When I want to cook them, I take however many I want, pop them in the microwave for about 10 seconds to defrost, then bake as usual.
Also the recipe is great if you replace the milk with orange juice, and add a little orange zest if you have an orange around. Once I also brushed them with a sugar and orange juice glaze and it was heavenly!

This recipe is amazing. So easy to follow this recipe. Scones came out perfect! Not too dry, not too soft. I followed the advice of some others and reduced baking powder to 3 tsp instead of 4. I also took some tips from another recipe and used frozen butter and grated it into the flour mixture rather than using a pastry blender. I used craisins instead of raisins, but that is just a personal preference. After mixing the dough, I sprinkled my counter with flour and pressed dough down into a circle about 8 inches around and 3/4 inches thick. Then cut into 8 triangles like a pizza pie. Sprinkled with a teaspoon of sugar instead of egg wash and placed on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper instead of greasing it. I placed them in the oven on the lower middle rack and baked for 18 minutes. They came out perfectly golden brown without having to grease a sheet or fiddle with an egg wash. I agree with everyone that this ingredient list is the best recipe, but I feel the adjustments I made based on tips from others helped to make these a breeze to make;-)   Would highly recommend this recipe with those few minor adjustments! Check out my photo with the Krispy Kreme mug??

I have only had scones once in my life and they were hard, dry and crumbly.  I only decided to make these because one of my daughters really wanted to try scones.  These are wonderful.  So moist and adaptable to any flavor.  I kept thinking - I can't believe how easy these are to make.  The less work you put into the dough, the better they are.  I cut the dough in half and made 1/2 chocolate chip and 1/2 orange cranberry.  The chocolate chip were okay - the kids liked them.  But the orange cranberry were so good.  I even made a little orange galze, which added to the moistness as well as the flavor.  As easy as these were to make, I would be a fool not to make them again.  I am thinking lemon blueberry, raspberry, the possibilities are endless.

Bitter after taste from the baking powder.  Rule of thumb is 1 1/4 tsp per 1 cup flour, and this recipe has way too much. I was wondering why it was inedible for me, but my husband kept saying "it's not so bad", and it's happened before with us with a banana bread recipe. did some research and it turns out a small percentage of the population is super sensitive to the taste of baking powder. Lucky me.

I am *so* confused right now.  I read many reviews raving about how fantastic this recipe was and I was excited to try it today.  There was only one review I had seen which called the scones "flavorless,"  Unfortunately, after making the scones, I now agree with the negative review.  While the scones had a nice texture, they did not have much flavor.  I even made sure not to overmix the dough.  Oh well, better luck next time...

Excitement turned to disappointment after my first bite.  The leavening agent (baking powder) left a metallic flavor that couldn’t be disguised even with copious amounts of jam or clotted cream.

These scones not only look great but taste great.  To the reviewer who complained about the baking powder "taste" perhaps you did not measure correctly.  I did not find this to be a problem.  I have been searching for a good scone recipe for a long time and this one fits the bill.  The sour cream gives them a nice texture, not dry the way some scones taste.  I 've made this a number of times and they are always a hit.

I leave the currants out of this recipe and use what is left as a base to make a variety of other scones. I've used it to make blueberry scones, orange cranberry, chocolate chip and pecan scones. Very delicious!

Followed the recipe to the tee, and they turned out AMAZING. 

Oh, I lied, instead of raisins, I used chocolate chips. So that was different. But the dough...the scone part of the scones, regardless of raisins or chocolate chips...the dough was perfect. It created the right kind of density and mmmm. Om nom nom.

Seriously!  I was doubtful because I have a recipe I like, but these . . . they're light, fluffy and amazing.  I made cinnamon apple by tossing one chopped peeled apple with 1 TB cornstarch and 1 tsp cinnamon which I added instead of raisins.  Also used 3 TB bk powder + 1/2 tsp bk soda as suggested and they aren't bitter.  Sprinkled the top with cin. & sugar.  Yummm!  Now to try cranberry orange.

All I tasted was baking powder-yuck. Not nearly enough sugar. They rose good and wern't dry, but man that baking powder was over powering. I think 2 tsps would be plenty.

Yum. Blueberries and lemon juice were added and they were delicious :) This recipe makes very few so for the amount of work that goes into baking I will likely double the recipe next time :)

4.5 stars as written- next time I make them (did the cranberry version! used craisins) I'll let the baking powder activate a little more- but letting them sit on the cookie sheet for about 10-15mins. before I bake them- VERY good recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as told.  It was wonderful.  Melt in your mouth great!  The dough was very wet and sticky when I was forming the scones so I just kept putting my hands in flour and they formed fine.  Highly recommended!

This was an AWESOME scone recipe! They were light and fluffy and not dry at all. I sprinkled a little sugar on top before popping them in the oven. They came out with a nice and slightly hard top to them. Perfect! Oh and they smelled absolutely delicious when baking. Next time I might use raisins and another time chocolate chips. I used cinnamon chips for this batch. Thank you for the awesome recipe.

Scones from Britain are rather more dense. I cut down the baking powder from 4 to 3 teaspoons, and they still came out rather fluffy.  I suspect that more butter (or perhaps shortening) and less leavening is required for an authentic British scone.  I also molded these like a British scone in that I baked them as one large round that I cut into 8 wedges (but did not separate!) using a bread knife before baking. Requires a longer baking time because surface area is much larger.  Otherwise, they were very tasty when made with currants.

I wasn't a scone fan, but had to make some for a special event. This recipe was a hit. I make scones on a regular basis now.  Making a large batch? I mixed up a triple batch and scooped it into a pan lined with wax paper. After freezing it, I lifted the block out of the pan and cut them into standard size triangles. When I was ready to make them, I laid the triangles out on the baking sheet to thaw before baking.

My husband is a Scotsman and he said these were excellent scones, much lighter even than most of the scones you get in Scotland. I have tried recipes from every known source but this will be my recipe from now on.

This is a really great recipe, the scones are light and delicious.  I did add a touch more butter to achieve the right consistency.  Based on the reviews of others, I did sugar the cookie sheet, omit the egg wash and substitute Craisins TM, for currants.  These were brought to a potluck and I knew they were truly superb when ladies were asking "have you tried the scones? They're amazing".  A pleasure to say, yes, I brought them.  Easily doubled, I made 32 small scones.  Thank you Friendlyfood for sharing this great treat.

Moist, slightly sweet, light and fluffy. Very good, I think these might be the worlds best scones. The scones I have had in the past are usually dry and chewy. 
I served these for dessert with cherry preserves. They were a nice slightly sweet end to a wonderful meal!

OK, but I have tasted a lot better.  Fluffiness was nice.  I think it was the baking powder taste that turned me off.  I like a little sweeter and as some of the other reviews stated, too dry by mid morning for me to consider saving for the next day.  Fed the leftovers to my chickens.  I was NOT impressed.  I used craisins in place of raisins.  I was really disappointed overall.  I think I'd cut the baking powder in half if I made again, but I don't think I'll be making this one again.  Left too much of a truly 'bad taste' in my mouth to try this one again.

I have been looking for an easy scone recipe that you didn't have to knead and roll out and this was not only easy but delicious. I make these with Kraft Caramel Bits (available at Target) and they are amazing! A favorite with my teenage son.

I've usually made scones from a mix....don't ask me why as I nearly never use mixes.  I guess that I just thought that homemade scones would be difficult--wrong!  I wanted to make scones for Christmas morning and these turned out great.  I think that I put them too close to each other as they kinda mushed together when baking.  I took them out after 15 minutes and initially thought that they were a little underdone.  I took out the ones that seemed the most done and popped the rest back in the oven.  In the meantime, my husband started on his and told me to take the others out of the oven as they were just very moist inside, not underdone.  The scones accompanied soft boiled eggs and I served them with clotted cream and jam.  Delicious!  So much for scone mixes....this was perfect!

I have been making scones since knee-high (probably because I lived in Ireland) and these are the best.   Definitely must have very cold butter and grating it in is the easiest way.  Thanks for your submission.

WOW! These were amazing...I made them last night and my family begged me to make them again today. Definitely a new family tradition.  I used mini chocolate chips in place of currants and added about a 1/2 t of vanilla. Yummy!

I followed this recipe cutting the bp to 3 tsp. as everyone advised. I added a cup of frozen blueberries.  
This recipe tasted like my favorite scones bought in an L.A. bakery that is now closed. These were very simple to make and all comments helped. I am eager to try blackberries and rasberries too!

I used 1 cup of white flour and 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour. I also replaced the dried fruit with freshly chopped apple, tossed with lemon juice and cinnamon sugar. Plus, I always add a little vanilla to the milk and sour cream mixture~ just for extra flavor. Also sprinkled turbinado sugar + cinnamon on scone tops. Not bad, I'll try other flavors next time too.

these were great! I reduced the baking powder as suggested & used buttermilk & plain yogurt instead of plain milk & sour cream. I used frozen blueberries instead, (make sure to take these out just b4 using, as they turn the dough blue & squish if they start to thaw too much!) they added a nice flavor to the scone. I also brushed the tops w/ just milk & lightly sprinkled cinnamon & sugar on them. I had to bake them a little longer, may have made them a bit big, abt 20min b4 they got a nice golden brown. Tasted great w/ butter or honey on them. My 17yo daughter & her friends loved them!

I just came across this recipe recently and have made it several times. This is a great recipe and so easy to make.  I made 2 batches tonight one with craisins and dried nectarines and the other one with chocolate chips and dried nectarines and they both came out great. My family loves this recipe. I also increased the sour cream to 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup and the scones were nice and moist.

This scone has a light, fluffy texture - which is not something I typically associate with scones. It is also quite sweet due to all of the sugar. 

I reduced the baking powder to 2 teaspoons to avoid a metallic taste and that seemed fine - the scones still rose well.

Overall, I wasn't impressed.

This recipe was great.  Instead of rolling the scones into balls I gently formed the dough into a square and cut triangles.  This gives them more of the classic scone shape.  I also sprinkled the top of them with raw sugar to add a nice crunch to the shell.

Delicious. Insanely delicious.  And easy. Am making this again for the second time this weekend--it's so simple to make, I don't even need the recipe to do it.

Changes I made: I nixed the currants/raisins. I added a little splash of vanilla to the milk/sour cream mixture (and put a bit more sour cream in, a bit less milk). 3 tspns baking powder. As encouraged I do not overwork the dough.

SMASHING, splendid, delicious, easy--perfect!

Hi, As the writer said, the scones are tender and easy to make. Her point to not overwork the dough is VERY important so the scone does not become tough.  I substituted the fruit for orange zest because I did not want the scone to have too many inredients (i like to have scones and jam). I did not include the sour cream because the stores were closed LOL! So i added more botter and a bit more milk.  Next time I will remove the sugar (a bit too sweet) because, as I mentioned, I prefer to eat my scones with jam.  I think I should make it with the sour cream and I think that will cut the sweetness and make it better.  Thank you very much for the recipe!

WOW! My husband (who dislikes scones) said I thought that scones were suppose to be yucky and dry. These are good and moist. I agree. They are wonderful!!! I traded raisins for craisins and added some fresh lemon zest. This is a recipe that I will do over and over again. Thank you for sharing!!!!

First time scones maker. I tried many recipes but never scones. I went with my husband to a coffee shop and he ordered a scone with his coffee. It was delicious and that's why I searched for the recipe. The home made ones were much better and full of freshness. I made the dough a night before and I cut it and cooked the next morning. Thank you so much.

This recipe was sensational! Among the top 10 best breakfasts I have eaten in my life. I served them as the recipe said with raisins, together with lemon curd, butter, strawberry marmelade, some cheese, orange juice and ceylon tea. Very, very good!!

I don't know if it was suppose to be like that, but my scones had easy to fall apart. But if you were careful it was no problem, and they tasted was fantastic!
I think I added a little more milk and flour than the recipe, that why mine easily fell apart.

As the recipe says these are definitely the World's Best Scones! I had a friend over yesterday for coffee and since we are both Irish I told her I would make some fresh scones. I couldn't find my usual recipe so I googled scones and this is where it led me too. I had them made in no time at all BUT I only read the ingredients and not the directions - so i added the egg, sour cream and milk. the dough was soft so i just dusted with a little extra flour - the result was a super tender, melt in your mouth scone. Enjoyed them so much thaqt today I made it again - this time I omitted the raisins at my daughters request. I added the egg again and put the mixture in a loaf pan. I used another egg for the egg wash, baked it for about 35/40 mins at 375 degrees. we had it with some real butter (from Ireland) and some strawberry preserves. Absolutely delicious! Kids want me to make it every day. Will be adding this to my favorites. Thanks FRIENDLYFOOD!!

Delicious! Didn't have sour cream, but I did have plain greek yogurt, which seems to have worked fine. Patted the dough into a circle and scored into 8 wedges. Baked almost 20 minutes. Wonderful plain!

I made these with 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, yogurt instead of sour cream, and no egg on top (I didn't have any, so I just brushed it with milk instead).  Next time I'll definitely go with all white flour - the scones were WONDERFUL but the texture just wasn't authentic with the wheat flour.  The yogurt substitution was great, though.

These scones are delicious. Lighter and moister. I took another reviewers advice to put in the freezer after mixing the butter and flour.
I also put some glazing sugar on the top before baking. 
I will be making these again.

I am not a baker and was a little worried but WOW these are delicious.  I doubled the recipe and made 3 kinds plain, semi-sweet chocolate chip, and dried cranberry with pecans.  They were all great!  The only thing I changed was I froze the butter and used the shredder.  This was a tip from another review and it worked great.

These were great.  We like cranberries better than raisins so used them instead.  Also topped with tubinado sugar--to give it that bakery look.  Used white wheat flour for the first time, my husband even loved them --and he used to not like scones!  Great recipe....oh--the overmixing comes in after you add the liquid...  It's pretty hard to overmix the dry ingredients with the butter as long as your butter is cold, NOT soft...so I wouldn't take the time to grate the butter for those of you who haven't baked alot.

I am English (now live in Canada) and have eaten a fair amount of scones in my time from varying establishments throughout the UK, the best IMO being from Cornwall, served at high tea. These don't really resemble a traditional British scone, but they were very nice indeed. My Canadian husband loved them - he called them tea biscuits. They were not what I'd describe as a biscuit as they were soft and fluffy - a biscuit is crunchy! I am not sure that the recipe called for enough butter and I would use a further 2 tablespoons and next time I would also use salted and not unsalted butter, however I will certainly be saving this recipe and using again - thanks for sharing.

These were ok, but the texture wasn't what I had expected.  They turned out too light and fluffy - like a biscuit.  I was hoping for something more a little more dense.

Very light and tender scones.  I've been looking for a good basic scone recipe to play around with in terms of flavors, and this is the one I'll be using from now on.  I used chopped dried cherries instead of the currents and they were delicious.  I also used my large Pampered Chef scoop to portion them and just flattened them with my hand right on the baking sheet.  They made 12 that way.  I took them to the office and they were a hit.  I've brought in scones made from other recipes and the first comment I got this morning was "these are the best you've made."  I have to agree.

Wondeful scones! I added frozen blueberries and it came out great. I did cut the sugar down a bit because i find american desserts much too sweet, using 1/3 cup for a double batch. I made a lemon glaze using 2 lemonds, zest of 1 lemon, 2 c. powder sugar, 1 tbs. butter. can heat over stove or microwave 30-60 seconds. Wisk to break up all the powdered sugar clumps. Amazing.
Update: made again. Used hemp milk and light sour cream. only 1/8 c. sugar. used small wild blueberries and let defrost a little first. These were the most tender, light and fluffy scones EVER! I am putting this recipe in a frame with my changes and hanging it over the oven :)

I only gave the recipe 4 stars because the first time I made the scones I followed the recipe to the 'T.'  They had a bitter aftertaste!  After research, I made the scones a second time using only 2 teaspoons of baking powder and they are much better!  I also used blueberries for the fruit and sprinkled sugar on the tops after the egg wash.  Be sure you put the fruit in the flour mixture BEFORE you put the liquid in.  I will definitely make these again.

These truly are the BEST scones... I have tried other scones which came out dry and hard but these came out perfect! I made several variations for a Bridal Tea Party- blueberry, chocolate chip and cranberry-orange. They were all a hit and devoured! Perfect with some Lemon Curd. I will use this recipe from now on whenever I need to make scones!

in a word: FANTASTIC!!!! These scones are so light and fluffy and delicious. They are perfectly sweet...not overly so. I didn't add anything to them, just served them with homemade whipped cream and Tiptree Little Scarlet Strawberry preserves. Heavenly!!! Very easy and very fast. First time I've ever made scones in my life. They were great! Will definitely use this as my go-to scones recipe!!

5 STARS AREN'T ENOUGH!  More Amazing Than I Imagined They Could Be.  I have eaten scones @ Starbucks twice this week and was interested in making them myself (I never have before).  The only changes I made when I made these this morning were to omit the salt and instead use salted sweet cream butter and use orange flavored dried cranberries.   These made the scones at Starbucks taste like dry, crumbly, roadkill.  They were so light and soft, and didn't need anything.  We preferred them plain.   I tell ya, if Starbucks started serving these, they would have a major profit surge.  Better for me, though.  I'm saving money by making them myself.  Thank you, Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It will stay in my recipe box forever!

I made a couple of substitutions to match what I had in the pantry, but they still turned out great.  Used Craisins instead of raisins Used buttermilk instead of the milk & sour cream combination Used Splenda instead of sugar

I was going to submit my Mum's recipe (orininally from England) but its very similar to this.  The only significant difference is her recipe called for 1 1/4c sour cream (not the commercial type, but if you can get regular heavy cream and let it sour...scrumptious.) No butter or milk, just the sour cream, 2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda and 3 baking powder. Everything else is the same.  The dough will be quite sticky.  If you don't like messing around with the butter etc you might want to give this version a try!

EXCELLENT!! I made these with dried cranberries and they were great- very light and unlike the dense ones you get most places. One variation I made was to form the dough into a large round and place it on a greased baking pan in the freezer for 15 minutes prior to cutting into pie shaped pieces and baking. This resulted in the typical triangle shaped scones.

I absolutely loved this recipe and have made it several times now.  One great change I made by accident.  I was out of sour cream and substituted Oikos honey-flavored greek yogurt.  This added just a little extra flavor and worked fantastically.  All of my guests for that brunch were raving about the scones.  Can't imagine it getting much better than this recipe!

I only used 3 teaspoons of baking powder, as recommended by another review, and my scones still tasted strongly of baking soda.  I've seen scone recipes of the same size that only call for 1-2 teaspoons. I'm curious why this one calls for so much.

I chose this recipe because I just don't keep whipping cream (as is called for in most recipes) in the house.  I was very pleased with how well these turned out, but I might cut back on the baking powder next time -- I felt like I could actually taste it a bit.  I think the important thing to consider here is using this recipe as a base to build on.  Personalize it to your taste (no currants, using gingerbread seasonings, adding a bit more sugar, whatever), but don't expect a whole lot of flavor as written.  This is a classic, understated British scone -- not the hulking, iced variety you buy at Panera.  I also have to say that I followed another reviewer's tip about freezing and grating the butter.  Fantastic idea!  I may never cut in butter again.  Also, the suggestion to cook in a cast iron skillet (I buttered mine for good measure) was priceless.

This recipe is amazing!  I used 1/4 cup pumpkin instead of the sour cream and added 1 tsp cinnamon.  The suggestion of grating frozen butter into the dry ingredients worked wonderfully.  Just have two sticks ready to grate, because the first started to melt in my hand.  Also, I didn't bother with the egg wash.

Amazing!Amazing scones.The texture is superb. I love scones and this recipe hit the spot. My husb. chowed down 3 in one sitting. I read thru' the reviews and reduced the baking powd. to 3 tsp, added orange zest,frozen wild blueberries and some dried cherries. You really need to add fruit or other tasty things into the basic scone dough or the scone will be tasteless and "floury" (exactly like what some of the other reviewers had mentioned).thank you for sharing this recipe.

I used craisins instead of currants and added 1 tsp. dried orange peel and 1/2 tsp. oragne extract. They were FANTASTIC! Best scones I ever had!

These come out delicious. I did add a wee bit more sugar because the kids like 'em sweet and used salted butter because that's what I had in the frig. I've made them with white flower and ran out of sour cream so I used a generous 1/4 cu of of Philly Cream Cheese and one time a friend, visiting, even added one mashed banana. Delish! They had a cheesy crust. I've also made them with the Philly cheese and 1/2 cu half&half instead of milk. Yum. This recipe makes 4 big scones or 6 mixed sizes. The first I made it I over blended. The next time I kneaded by hand and let the butter make a crumb-like texture with the flour. I've also made them with 1 cup each of white and red wheat I ground myself and they come out the consistency of cookies.  A bit hard but greeeeaaat tasting and healthy. Can't seem to go wrong with this one. Everytime I've made them they've come out great. This recipe makes a great basic recipe to which you can add other ingredients. I believe cooking time depends on the oven. When using white flower and cream cheese I've had to extend the cooking time to 18-20 minutes.

These are excellent - I add dried cranberries and raisins (no idea where I'd find currants anyway), and usually about 3/4 cup or more rather than 1/2 as specified.  Thanks for the great recipe

I was not terribly impressed. The scones from the bakery down the street were far superior than my fresh-baked ones from this recipe, so not worth the trouble. Also the scones got hard very quickly, but the next day they are inedible.

these are by far, the best scones I  ever tried, and I am a sconeholic, instead of the milk I used half milk and half sour cream, and used a little less baking powder.

This is a wonderful recipe.  This was my first attempt at making scones, and those who ate them thought they were great!  One woman told me she didn't even like scones, but loved these!  I can't think of a better compliment than that for this recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

I made this recipe yesterday using all cake flour because I didn't have enough regular flour. I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla and one cup cherry flavored craisins. I did the egg wash with sugar sprinkled on top. I patted into a large circle and cut apart like a pie. They were wonderful. Thanks for the recipe. This was my first attempt at making scones.

These are very good.  I added golden raisins.  Fresh out of the oven with some butter,  mmmmm.  Be sure to mound them high on the pan or else they will be a little flat and hard to slice in half.

I love these scones!!!! They're amazing! My one caveat is i usually need to add a bit more milk- more like 2/3 to 3/4 of a cup. They always turn out amazing and everybody asks for the recipe! Delicious with 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes and 1/2 tsp coconut extract instead of currants. Or cut back on the sugar and add cracked black pepper and grated parmesan (you'll definitely need more milk then). Or add zest of a lemon and 1/2 cup frozen blueberries or raspberries.  Or just add 1 tsp vanilla bean paste and no other add ins. SO GOOD!!!!

WONDERFUL Scones, FRIENDLYFOOD! Followed exactly - so easy but sooooo delish. Made for Mother's Day. Added Vanilla Glaze on this site (Thank you, Jamie Langston) & a little orange extract for brunch & omitted raisins.  This is my 'go to' scone recipe in fact I'm craving them now!

I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the flour mixture and 2 apples (1 chopped and 1 shredded) to the flour before adding the milk/sour cream mixture.  I had red delicious so used them.  My husband and son loved them.  *Note - the mixture is a little wet due to the shredded apple.  To make handling easier I put waxed paper down and floured, then I put heaping tablespoon of scone mixture down, dusting with a little extra flour, rolled in ball and placed on baking sheet.  Worked great.

As other reviewers suggested, I didn't overmix the batter, and I placed the bowl in the freezer after mixing in the dry ingredients.  I gently folded in mini chocolate chips and sprinkled sugar on top.  These came out soft and were delicious just by themselves.  I will use this recipe for scones from now on.

Super easy and delicious.  I added Craisins and white chocolate chips instead of currants.  Also, I skipped the egg wash and just brushed tops w/ milk and sprinkled on a little sugar.  Perfect!

TERRIFIC recipe.  Unequaled scones!  I have made these many times, always to rave reviews.  The sour cream is a magic ingredient that imparts a wonderful tang and moistness.  Completely unlike the dense, crumbly specimens at Starbucks or equivalent.  Like many others, I reduce the baking powder to 3T with no ill effect, otherwise I taste the BP's bitterness.  I also find that a bit more salt is helpful--a heaping 1/8 tsp or a bit less than 1/4 tsp.  I skip the egg wash step.  Preparation is much easier if you have a food processor.  I usually keep some butter in the freezer and roughly cut up the correct amount in tablespoon-sized pieces (refrigerated butter works fine too).  I blend the butter and dry ingredients with my Cuisinart's metal blade until well mixed.  However, I don't use the Cuisinart for final mixing as I think it tends to overwork the dough.  I turn the dry ingredients+butter into a mixing bowl, mix in dried fruit, nuts, or other additions, then add the milk/sour cream mixture.  (Hint: Measuring sour cream is a little messy if you use standard measuring cups, so pour the milk into a Pyrex liquid measuring pitcher and then spoon some sour cream to the milk until the level of the milk rises to 3/4 c.)  One complaint: this recipe only makes 6 scones in my 8-compartment scone pan.  Larger recipe: 2 1/3 c (280 gr) flour, 4T Powder, 1/3 c sugar, 1/4 t salt, 5+ T butter, 2/3 c milk, 1/3 c sour cream.

These are truly the best scones around.  I made them with craisins for a wedding shower, and they received rave reviews - even from the women who already had their own scone recipes!  The butter takes a while to work in, so allow plenty of time, but it is absolutely worth it.  They also bake up well in miniature versions.

Perfect scones with an ingenious savory sweet twist:

Reduced baking powder to 3 tsp and reduced sugar to ~1/5 cup. Added 1/2 tbsp. caraway seeds and 1 tsp. fresh ground cardamom seeds to dry mix. Made with extra large raisins (which is why could reduce the sugar because they add their own sweetness). Skipped egg wash.

Everyone went bonkers for these!  Try them out! 
You can decrease caraway and cardamom for a subtler flavour or go hog wild and ramp it up and even add some other savory spices. Thinking of adding a dash of fresh shaved mace next time. Thanks for the wonderful recipe to play with!

Just made these this morning for breakfast!  Very fluffy and yummy with just right amount of flavors.  I also reduced the baking powder to 1 tablespoon (3 teaspoons) and it was just right.  Will make them again.

I was really disappointed with these. I followed the recipe very carefully and wound up with something like a metalic flavored, fluffy cookie just slightly reminiscent of a scone.

Easy to make. I halved the recipe and added chocolate chips to mine instead. I might skip the eggwash next time.

Not the typical scones many are used to, more like the ones in the UK. Not very sweet. I love them!

Yummy!  Flaky and really moist.  Because I made them for Christmas, I added craisins for the currants and zested one orange.  Would have been good to put a touch of orange juice in as well but I didn't want to mess up the moisture. Everyone loved them.

These scones turned out great with a few modifications. I added one half cup of sugar, almost a cup of raisins, one teaspoon of vanilla extract and instead of milk and sour cream. I added one cup of buttermilk. Also baked them in a round and scored pie shaped scones. Taste and look great.

Turned out light and just right texture.  Will make again.  Stuck to recipe except added about quarter cup diced dried apricots for colour and flavor.  Thinking about doing another batch at Christmas with different fruit.

These are best served hot out of the oven. I substituted fresh raspberries for raisins. I also prefer whipping cream to sour cream.

I followed the recipe as is, except no currants so I made it plain. It's a bit sticky and not possible to make into shapes so I scooped them onto the baking sheet. They came out okay, fluffy+dry, not the fluffy+moist I like. Will look elsewhere.

This was my first time making scones, and I wish I would have found this recipe sooner!!!  These scones are SOOOOO good.  I made the first batch with raisins, and the second batch I made with cranberries and orange flavoring.  Came out delicious!!! This will definitely be my go-to recipe for scones.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Wow! These are unbelievably good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added blueberries instead of currants or raisins. Delish! Much, much better than any scone I have ever made or purchased. Will definitely make these again (and again and again!)!

Excellent, very light and flaky!  I used just 3 tsp. baking powder. Left off the egg wash and used large sugar crystals on top.  Instead of currents I used butterscotch chips.  Yummy, Yummy. Will definitely make again.

Agreed. This is a great recipe. But you have add a few more ingredients to make them "THE BEST".  I used the currents, but added ~1/2c raw almond slivers (that I then crunched in the palm of my hand), 1tsp Vanilla, 1/2tsp cinnamon, and I added about 3 more Tb sugar to the recipe. hey turned out fabulous, and when compared side by side to the original recipe, the taste is far better.  They came out looking beautiful because of the egg/milk wash. Really, just barely mixing the flour & cream mixture is important. I only takes a few turns with a spoon. I gently formed them into balls and pressed them down as indicated, but next time I will form them into a thicker shape because the pressing made them turn out thinner than i wanted. GREAT RECIPE.

Fantastic recipe - thanks for sharing! I also grated the frozen butter & that worked GREAT! I added cherry craisins & some orange zest. After the egg wash I sprinkled with some sugar & they were perfect. Crunchy on the outside, moist & soft on the inside. I took these to my husband's work & got rave reviews.  Next I'm going to try bluberries with some vanilla extract & then some chocolate chip ones - definitely a keeper!

I have been dying to make scones for some time.  Once I get hooked on a new food idea I dive in until I perfect it.  This was my 1st scone recipe.  I have just finished eating my 2nd one and I cant stop!  I just checked my cooks illustrated site, they have an almost identical recipe! Grandma was way ahead of Cook's!! amazing!  Kudo's to grandma, this is an incredibly delicious recipe!

These are delicious! I am in Tunisia right now and do not have access to sour cream so I used natural yogurt instead. Still turned out great. They are really moist and yummy. I am going to try them next with chopped dates.

These may not be the best scones in the world, but they are the best scones I've ever had. I did not have currants—in fact, I don't believe I've ever seen a currant—and the raisins I had were dessicated, so I used cinnamon chips. Otherwise, however, I followed the recipe completely, and they were wonderful. In fact, they were even quite good heated up the next morning. I will be making more of these this weekend; I'm almost sure of it.

I have used the same scone recipe for many years, but kept seeing this recipe and was so tempted to see what it was like.  The scones were just so light in texture, different to the scones I am used to but I really did enjoy them and I am sure I will be using this recipe for some time to come.  Followed the recipe exactly, did not change a thing.  Served with a layer of strawberry jam, topped with fresh sliced strawberries and a big dollop of cream, yum!!  Perfect for afternoon tea.

Very tasty scone!  I made it according to the recipe and it was tasty as is, although I would have liked it a tad sweeter and plan to sprinkle sugar on top of the egg wash next time.

They were good!  The only way to have scones is with jam and clotted cream.  These were light and just crumbly enough. The only change I made was to leave out the sugar because they just don't need it.

This recipe is fantastic! I left out the raisins/currants, used reduced fat sour cream and fat free millk (since that is what I keep in my refrigerator) and I omitted the salt but used salted butter. They came out BEAUTIFUL. Gorgeous golden brown scones, light and fluffy but dense and very filling. My son LOVES them and is often a picky eater when it comes to trying new things, and this was his first "scone experience". They are perfect with some blackberry jam. They are great reheated too, I covered with foil and popped them in the oven on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes at 350 and they were piping hot and still so soft in the middle. I am sure these are going to become requested regularly for weekend breakfasts at my house.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were heavenly.  I'm not a morning person, so the night before I used my food processor to cut the butter into the flour mixture. Just pulse a few times until crumbly.  At this point I put it all in the refrigerator.  In the morning, all I had to do was mix in the milk/sour cream and shape. I also sprinkled a bit of sugar on them before baking just because I like that crunchy top.  Hot delicious scones with little effort in the morning. I usually roll my eyes when people title their recipes "the best yada yada in the world," but these just might be!
*UPDATE:  Even better...I've found you can mix the entire thing, shape them, put them on a parchment lined baking sheet. and throw them in the frig the night before. Pull them out the next morning and bake. AND even more better...after mixing and shaping, you can freeze these!  I freeze them first on a cookie sheet and then put them in a freezer bag. They can go straight from the freezer into the oven, obviously they will take a few minutes longer.

Excellent! My husband said they were the best scones he'd ever had, and he's British!   I left out the raisins and substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream. Perfect for afternoon tea.

I have made this many times, and my friends have told me that they are the best scones they've ever eaten!  I love the texture - fluffy, the way they should be.  I often substitute the sour cream for plain yogourt - it works out great.  I use a pastry cutter to cut in the butter. I once tried to substitute with margarine - it doesn't work! USE COLD BUTTER ONLY - NO SUBSTITUTES!  Super delish!  I like to pair it with clotted cream (you can get it at many Canadian supermarkets near the sour cream - it's called "Devon Cream") and raspberry preserves. Thanks for the recipe!

Getting good scones in Malaysia is a real hit and miss thing. More often miss than hit. So this very simple to make recipe is a real God-given for me, and a definite HIT.  Tested my product on an English man and he said this could sell in any tea shop in London. Acid test passed.  Have made it many times and am ready to venture into lemon, walnut, herb, cheese, and every other variation there is out there but with this recipe as the basic mix.

I used half&half instead of milk (because I wanted to use some up), also added blueberries (increased cooking time) .  I also left the dough in a sort of round and cut them into 6-8 even pieces then baked whole.  Came out moist and delicious!  Will try with more traditional currants next time!  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I combined advice/alterations from several reviewers, and tinkered with the recipe a bit. I used light sour cream instead of regular sour cream and evaporated skim milk instead of regular milk. I froze the butter, grated it, then tossed it in the rest of the dry ingredients, instead of using a pastry blender. I also substituted dried cranberries (heated in orange juice then cooled and drained) for the raisins/currants, and added the zest of 1/2 of a large orange to the dry ingredients. Finally, I sprinkled sugar over the egg wash before baking, and drizzled cooled scones with a glaze made from icing sugar, freshly squeezed orange juice, and the zest from the other 1/2 of the orange. The scones were delicious at room temperature, topped with butter and homemade strawberry jam.

These were very good scones.  Not to moist, not to dry.  The family loved them.  I did add a touch of orange extract and craisins.  I thought this was a nice touch.  My dad ate the last few without even sharing.

I grew up with scones - both bad and good.  Mom always overworked the dough and Grandma just didn't make them often enough :o) I have to say these scones truly earn the title of World's Best Scones.  Light, flaky, perfectly sweet.  These will be a staple on my breakfast table for family and Holidays.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

These tasted really good when they were warm, although they were more like a biscuit than a scone. After the first day they became very dry.

Best scones I've ever had anywhere.  And it looks beautiful.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins because it was what I had on hand.  It can out better than what I expected.
The scones were moist and the texture was perfect.  I'm definitely making more of these.

Just made these and they are fantastic! Light, fluffy and better than the ones I get from the bakery. I used blueberries and topped some with nothing, some with cinnamon sugar and some with streusel. Since these scones aren't too sweet the streusel was really good on them. I baked on parchment paper on my oven stone. My boyfriend who has never like scones LOVED these and said he prefers over his usual favorite muffins. Thanks for the recipe - can't wait to try some other variations.

I have been looking for a recipe to simulate the cinnamon scones we get from a bakery.  This one worked out perfectly.  All I did was replace the raisins with cinnamon chips.  Also the ones we get has an icing on them. I made a vanilla icing from this recipe and on half of them drizzled the icing on top.

I was pressed for time when I made these, so I mixed up the dough and put it in the refrigerator while I went out. When I came home all I had to do was the egg glaze and pop them in the oven. They turned out great!! I've never had a scone turn out as light as these! I used black currants and mixed up a berry butter to put with them. Perfect.

These are excellent scones.  The frozen grated butter trick works great and makes this recipe easy to make!  I've been experimenting with different additions.  One of my favorite is dried cranberries and then drizzling and orange zest glaze after baking.

My entire family LOVES these scones, and it is sooooo easy to adapt it to add different flavors. My favorite variation is for ginger scones. I add 1/2 tsp ground ginger and 1/4 cup minced candied ginger.

This is an excellent scone recipe--my favorite by far.  The scones are light and fluffy, not dense like the kinds you buy in coffeeshops here in the US.  I skipped the eggwash on mine put still sprinkled some sugar on top.  The sugar stayed on just fine.  The biggest hits have been chocolate chip, cranberry, and lemon blueberry scones (substitute lemon yogurt for the sour cream).  I would not use this recipe to make savory scones--they end up too sweet.

Delicious! I made this just as the recipe stated. Except I didn't have currants so I used frozen mixed berries! Let me tell you YUMMY! I took them to a coffee with my girlfriends and there wasn't a scone left. Even my British friends raved about them!

I had researched several scone recipes and tried this one. I used raisins and also added some cinnamon. They were wonderful! Pay attention to the tip to not over mix/kneed the dough. I also made a another batch using dried cherries and another with dried cranberries. I'll definately make these again.

I had never made scones before and my 10 yr old son wanted to try some. I took the not overmixing to heart and actually had some chunks of butter still in the mix. We're not big fans of raisens or currents so we added some thawed huckleberries, vanilla and cinnamin. Used salted butter (didn't have unsalted). WONDERFUL! I'll be keeping this one. Thanks

These scones are very tasty and light and fluffy.  I would have liked them to be a tad bit flakier.  I used the 3 tsp of BP as suggested, used heavy cream instead of sour cream, I also added fresh cranberries,orange rind and a tbsp of orange juice.  They were really delicious. I highly recommend brushing the tops with the egg mixture and a bit of sugar sprinkled on top, it just adds that extra touch.  I didn't do it on the first batch but did on the 2nd and have to say it makes them much better!

I just finished making these scones and they are the BEST scones I have ever made. The texture is just like the scones I buy from my local trendy bakery.  I am already thinking of different ways to make them - adding blueberries or cranberries instead of raisins, or adding lemon or orange zest, etc. 

I drizzled a glaze on mine, but they really don't need it.

My mother loved to make scones, and I wish she was alive to taste these.  She would surely love them.

These were the first scones I've ever made and they turned out perfect!!, They were light and crumbly and we ate them with butter or cream and strawberry jam. Scones are usually accompanied by a spread, that's the reason their flavor does not overpower but it's meant to complement. I used a fruit medley instead of currants and Creme Fraiche instead of sour cream. Because they're so quick to make I can see myself  using this recipe over and over...Thanks!

This truly is the best recipe! I used orange flavored craisins instead of raisins and they turned out great! This has become a family favorite and most requested breakfast item when friends and family come to visit.

This is the scone recipe I have waited my whole life for.  They are tender and flakey and very versitle.  I have replaced the currents with all kinds of dried fruits and have left out the fruit altogether to make a savory bisquit. WONDERFUL!

In search of the best scone recipe, this one is definately in the finals!  Made mine with dried cranberries, and added a little more than a cup, also added LOTS of fresh orange zest, WONDERFUL and the right texture too!

have made these three times in the last month. We love them.  A few variations I have tried---didn't have sourcream so I used a lemon flavored yogurt....excellent.  added vanilla for a little extra flavor and dusted with sugar before cooking.

This recipe is great! I goofed and mixed the egg into the batter and they still turned out. I used craisins instead of raisins and made 4 huge ones instead of 8 smaller ones. I had to modify the temperature and the time a bit to cook them on the inside. I will definately make these again - delicious!!

I have attempted other scone recipes without success and was a bit wary to try this one also. With my search continuing I decided to try this after reading all the reviews and have to say that I was very impressed with the results. Maybe my search is finally over.

Fantastic as is, and easily adaptable--just as good with whole wheat pastry flour and maple syrup instead of sugar.  Baking powder can be reduced to 3 tsp, but I kind of like the baking powder taste.

These were delicious! I was looking for a traditional, flaky scone recipe, and found it in this one. Followed directions but added 1/4 tsp cinnamon with dry ingredients (will try 1/2 tsp next time for added cinnamon flavour) and sprinkled egg wash with cinnamon-sugar mix. Enjoying one now fresh out of the oven. Yum.

I made a gluten-free version of this recipe...the scones were amazing. I followed the recipe with three changes. First, I used Bob's Red Mill gluten-free flour, which allows for a 1:1 replacement of wheat flour in baking recipes. Gluten provides the 'stickiness' to hold bread products together, so I needed to add xanthum gum to achieve the same cohesion (3/4 tsp per cup of flour for muffins and quick breads like scones). I bought both the gluten-free flour and gum at a local health food store. Second, I used agave nectar as a sugar replacement. I used the amber variety of nectar, but you can use the light or raw varieties as well. The amber variety has a subtle maple-like flavor, the light variety has a neutral mild flavor, and the raw variety has a richer flavor. The nectar to sugar conversion is 1/2 cup of nectar to 1 cup of sugar. I used 1/8 cup of nectar in this recipe, and added it once I sifted the dry ingredients together, but before the butter. Finally, I used non-flavored, unsweetened almond milk in place of traditional milk (1:1 conversion). This was my first time making gluten-free scones, and I was nervous about making the aforementioned substitutes. I was stunned and stoked at how amazing the scones tasted like authentic Scottish scones. My family and I enjoyed the scones with authentic Scottish and English jams I bought in Europe last year. Enjoy and stay hungry, my friends!

BEST EVER!!  AGREED by everyone I served them to.  I added 1/2 c. halved dried cranberries and drizzled powdered sugar icing with grated orange zest and vanilla added to taste.  YUMMY!!  Easy too.  Just know that super crumbly is ok as you press them gently together.   They will hold together after they are baked.

Perfection! I did add 1 extra tablespoon of butter because I have butter grated and in the freezer in premeasured packages since I make scones every weekend. I used golden raisins and added about 1/3 cup chopped walnuts (preference but would still be "perfect" scones without them). So glad I found this recipe!

Because of the sour cream, these scones are tender and fluffy.  Don't expect them to be crumbly.  They are the soft type scones. I used sour cream and buttermilk because that is all I have....the result is awesome...the flavor is buttery and they are melt in your mouth tender.  Keeper recipe.

I've been making these scones for two years now and  I get requests from everyone to bring them to tea.  This is a fantastic recipe that produces a light scone with nice exterior.  I use fresh blueberries in mine instead of raisins.

why anyone would buy scones when they could make these is beyond me.  For years I've been looking for a good recipe and finally found one.  Have made these numerous times and everyone raves about them.  They are easy to make and have a lightness that most scones do not have.  I've tasted some that were hard as rocks.  Thanks so much for this one!

Exceptional! I used fresh raspberries and white chocolate chunks instead of the currants, and sprinkled some coarse sugar on top after the egg wash. Amazing! I can't wait to try other ingredients. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and put the dry mix/butter mixture in the freezer for 10 minutes or so till the butter hardened and it was super easy to rub it between my fingers and mix it into the dry mixture. Pretty quick and simple to make as well. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!

Awesome...not dry at all. Probably needed a little more sugar or maybe I should've sprinkled with sugar after baking. I think its a matter of which fruit i put in though. I didn't use any dried fuits, instead, I used blueberries and lemon zest (inspired by the lemon blueberry scones - AR). My husband likes it packed evenly with blueberries because he didn't care too much for the bread part. All in all, it was good. Oh, one last note, I was getting afraid that the bottoms were starting to turn dark brown really fast while waiting for the tops to turn at least golden brown, but right when a hint of golden turned out, I pulled it out of the oven and quickly transferred it to a cooling rack. You know what, I like the crispness from the bottoms...yum! I didn't have that burnt taste at all.

These were very good. I did not have sour cream so I used Greek vanilla yogurt because that's all I had. Very good!!! I think I will do again and make with buttermilk and herbs for dinner. Thanks for posting

I was searching for a scones recipe after having them at Disney World's breakfast buffet-Boma! These turned out just as good as theirs! I made them the first time exactly as the recipe says and that is where my 5 star rating comes from.

The second time I used white whole wheat and instead of currents I did 1/2 cup fresh blueberries. I also added 1 tsp vanilla to the milk/sour cream mix. It never formed into a ball (assuming because of the wheat) so I added 3 tablspoons of orange juice and that did the trick. They were delicious! If you want to whip something togeher last minute these will not let you down. I served with whipped cream cheese when my friends came over last minute for tea =)

I wanted some scones that were more British than American, and this recipe absolutely hit the spot! They were a big hit with my friends, who remarked 'Wow, and I don't even like scones!' 

I took the advice of other commenters and grated the butter (to handle it less) and also refrigerated the mixture between portions of the recipe. I also added a handful of frozen blueberries, and they were pop-in-your-mouth delicious!

Delicious, I used whole wheat flour and added blueberries. Baked it in a 9x9 cake pan then sliced it when cooled. I did not put the egg topping on.

Best scones ever. I used buttermilk since I had it and it worked great. Added orange zest, dried cranberries and mini chocolate chips. I also sprinkled sugar on egg wash. I have already made them twice since yesterdy!! Yummy

I was trying to come up with something last minute with what I had on hand to take to a brunch.  I substituted the 1/4 c. sour cream with peach yogurt since I didn't have any sour cream.  I used 3 tsp b.p. per a previous review and used raisins, golden raisins and cranberries.  I also formed the dough into one large round loaf and scored it with a knife before baking for about 25 minutes.  I also only washed it with milk since I was out of eggs.  It was beautiful and delicious!  This is a definate keeper and will be made often here!

Easy to make and taste fantastic. I had never made scones before these and was incredibly pleased at how they turned out. Light and fluffy and just perfect when warm with a little butter and some current jelly. Have made three times now - will never need another scone recipe!

Just pulled out one of these scones fresh from the oven and it is TRUE!  They ARE the best in the world - fluffy, delicate, flavorful...mmmmmm.  I made 2 adjustments.  I soaked the raisins for 5 min in hot water and I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and skim milk for the regular milk.  Kept the butter, though :)

Die for these scones. You can alter them as you want (add raisins, currants, etc) but make sure to follow the instructions exactly. Especially not mixing or kneading too much! I'll throw in some cocoa and make them chocolately...or add peanut butter chips to make them more sweet & "americanized".

very good! Easy to customize; sweet or savory. I made them with dried fruit (rasins, crasins,cherry)with sugar on top and cheesy herbs(sharp cheddar and herbs de provence). Everyone loved them!

I am sure this recipe is great- but for someone with little baking experience- this recipe is deceiving. My scones were so bitter I couldn't eat them. There is WAY too much baking powder!! Maybe the recipe is supposed to be like this, because almost all the reviews indicate that this recipe is AWESOME. But I had a very different experience... :-(

Way too fluffy for a scone - I reduced the baking powder from 4 tsps to 3 tsps to give the scones a "denser" feel and texture.  Much better this way!

I hate to be the party pooper here....but I thought this recipe was a nightmare.  I opted for the metric conversion and can only think it must be wrong!!  15g of baking powder was way too much, so I just added one teaspoon.  Also 120ml of milk plus 60g of Sour Cream just made the whole mixture like a cake mix.  It was far too sticky to be able to form any type of scone at all.  As I was baking these to eat with friends on a coffee morning I decided to re-name them as Rock Buns, as thats what they looked like.  HOWEVER, in all fairness they tasted delicious and were incredibly light.  So please can anyone tell me how to adjust this recipe into a Scone dough instead of a sticky tacky cake mix consistancy, as its such a shame.  I was really disappointed.

The scones had a good flavor but the texture was not at all what I expected. They came out light and fluffy, almost like cake, not dense and flaky like I would expect a scone to be.

These are okay, not what I consider scones. Still a tad too sweet and you can taste the baking powder too much. Another sweet scone recipe on here is more addictive than this one. I don't feel making them was a waste, but I probably will not make this one again.

Very nice scones. When eaten plain, noticed a slightly odd baking powder taste, but I don't think it would be noticeable with jam/butter/cream. Next time I'll use 3tsp instead of 4, but overall, great recipe - these are yummy!

Yummy! They came out so fluffy and light inside, but nice and crispy on the outside. I just made these scones 3-ways. 1-fresh blueberries+meyer lemon zest and glaze. 2-dried cranberries topped with sliced almonds. 3-plain ole chocolate chips =) Didn't make any drastic changes. Just reduced baking powder to 3 tsp (1Tbs) and I think added 1 less Tbs of butter.

I THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  I am from Quebec(Canada) and a real "fan" of scones since several years.  I have tried many at different places and this recipe makes them taste like the ones I usually buy.  I have followed the exact instructions of the recipe (except that I had mid-salt butter) and put raisins.  Next time, I will try to substitute sour cream with yogourt and reduce amount of baking powder... just to see.
MANY THANKS AGAIN...  Have a nice day!!

These are wonderful "true" scones.  If you don't like this recipe, then you don't really like scones!  I used golden raisins in mine and they turned out perfect.  I can't wait to try lemon zest and blueberries. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I made these raisin scones with the children I nanny for a tea party we had. They were fabulous! They were soft and delicious. The children and family loved them, even the dad who told me he doesn't normally like scones because they are too dry. 
They did get old fast which may just happen with scones, but by the next day, they were already not as nice.

I love these scones.  I have been making these for quite a few years. This year I decided to use tart cherries.  I put the dried cherries in my steamer and put them in the refrigerator.  When my dough was ready I added the cherries and my, oh my. Best cherry flavor ever!  Steaming the Cherries works great. I did dried blueberries and didn’t steam them and the blueberry flavor is not there.  So steam your dried fruit and you won’t be sorry!

I usually do not leave a review but i just had to this time.  As a professional baker, i have tried several scone recipes but none came as fantastic as these ones. Simply delicious, moist on the inside and a nice crust on the outside. This will be the recipe i will use from now onwards. I made two changes. Used 3 teaspoons of baking powder and replaced sour cream with buttermilk because i had none. Will get some from the store the next time. My husband and son loves these scones. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe. Cheers!!!

This is the truly the Best Scone recipe! Thanks for sharing. Made these for a Bridal Shower to rave reviews. Even good the next day. You are so right, the key to them is not to over mix. My Scottish Grandmother made pie crust with milk and you have the same problem. Over mixing toughens the crust. I will be making these again and experimenting with delicious additions!

Delicious scone recipe- I followed it exactly and they came out moist, light, and flavorful. Definitely don't mix the dough to much as the instructions say that makes the scones tough. I baked mine the first time just touching as the instructions did and they came out as one giant scone that i had to break apart. The second time i kept them an inch apart and that worked better. I'm so glad I lost my other scone recipe our i never would have found this amazing one!!

So i tried this recipe. I only made half the serving and used chocolate chips instead of raisins because that's the only thing I have. I also used powdered dry chocolate milk again because that was all I had. Otherwise, followed the recipe measurements. It was awesome!!!! Eating them now with cream cheese and worrying if I'll spoil myself for dinner. Thumbs up!!!!

I've made this recipe twice now and I followed it exactly!  These are the most delicious scones I've ever eaten or made!  I agree with some other reviewers that the less your work the dough, the more tender the scones will be.  Instead of greasing the cookie sheet, I used parchment paper and I like that as the scones don't have a grease layer on the bottom.  Also, I used a cookie dough scoop instead of handling the dough to make them into balls.  The cookie scoop worked wonderfully!  I just dipped it in flour before each scoop!  It made the scones a nice size; not too big!  All in all, this recipe is super delicious and I thank "FRIENDLYFOOD" for sharing it!

Subbed missing ingredients - still came out great!  I have a fantastic scone recipe caged from the London Times that I love - but I didn't want to make the big quantity it creates so I tried this one.  Started before I realized I have (1) no  dried fruit (2) no sour cream. I used 3/4 cup skim milk plus 1tablespoon plain white vinegar and no fruit.  They came out very light, and rose beautifully!  I did use real butter - which I think is critical to the taste of scones.  Also, I used a trick from the other recipe:  heated the oven to 475 degrees & put my greased cookie sheet in five minutes before I was going to bake the scones to pre-heat it.  I do think a pre-heated surface helps the scones rise bigger.  Pulled the cookie sheet out, put the scone flattened balls on, put the sheet back in & adjusted heat down to 425 (which it had cooled to anyway with opening twice) & baked for 12 minutes.  Would def use this recipe again!  Lovely with light plain cream cheese, by the way.

These scones are wonderfully moist and very easy to make.  I substitute all sorts of things for the raisins, depending on the season and the setting.  Anything from cranberries and orange zest to savory breakfast scones.

If your preference in a scone is for something dense and dry and crumbly this recipe is not for you.  I tried this recipe on the recommendation of The British Baker and I was not disappointed.  These are moist and light.  I wanted a savory scone to go with a meal I'm making so I left out the currants.  Instead, I tossed in some finely chopped scallion greens, some freshly shredded Parmesan, and a good handful of toasted pecans.  I got 8 scones from the recipe and baked on stoneware.  The egg wash might not be necessary, but it adds a lovely shine and I think helps the browning process.  These are lovely to look at and delicious as well.  I can't wait to try them as written with something sweet like craisins and some orange zest.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Best recipe for scones. I use it for a base recipe for scones and then add according to what I want. Like orange zest from 1 orange and vanilla for orange scones or one apple finely chopped and adding cinnamon and nutmeg for apple scones. Going to try chocolate/orange scones next :-) But recipe is perfect!

These are not dense scones, but they sure taste good! I used 3 tsp baking powder because i am baking at high altitude. i also left out raisins just because. Instead of sour cream I used yogurt because that is what i had. easy to bake and tasty! I forgot to let it rest and it still turned out just fine!

My husband couldn't stop eating them. I didn''t have any currants. Remembered cinnamon sugar scones from a bakery in CA. I used the trii-fold method from the video and sprinkled cinnamon sugar at that step. Egg washed the tops and more cinnamon sugar YUMMY

Perfection. Swapped out the currants/raisins for chocolate chips- wouldn't recommend, overly sweet. Especially if you eat with jam/cream. Otherwise, super easy and delicious.

These scones were absolutely fabulous.  I divided the dough into 3 small sections as I wanted to experiment with flavors.  I added mini chocolate chips to one small ball of dough. Then rolled it out and used my biscuit cutter to cut them out.  Then I did one blueberry and one blueberry lemon with the remaining 2 balls.  They were all good, but the favorites were chocolate chip and the blueberry lemon.  I did not have not have sour cream or yogurt, so I used my powdered buttermilk to make 1/2 cup of liquid in place of the sour cream and milk.  Absolutely perfect substitute.  Will be making 3 more batches today.  Great recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

These were good, but maybe a little too light.  We had scones all over England and Scotland and by far the best ones we had were a denser, slightly drier recipe that we just haven't been able to replicate.  That certainly isn't this recipe's fault, but we consider those our gold standard of what a scone should be.

They were light and fluffy like a cake, but did not meet my expectation for a scone. They baked properly and it's good food for something else, but not a scone.

Not imprssed.  Baking powder taste is overwhelming.  Needs a bit more sugar.  But, they did rise nicely and are light and fluffy.  I shall stick with my tried and true version, which (surprisingly) is almost identical to this one, but has 1 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. soda.  Would not make these again.

Simple, easy, and delicious! Added 1/4 cup white chocolate chips to mine as well and sprinkled rock sugar on top. Used the suggestion to "grate" the butter into the recipe. What a fantastic idea! Worked perfect! Thank you for submitting this recipe!

I cut them into triangles and used dried cranberries as the mix-in. They are very good, just not yet the best. Nothing wrong with them, but not ultimate. They come out soft, but NOT melt in your mouth, which is what i was looking for. My kids really loved them! Thanks for sharing!

Wow!  These were excellent.  These scones were all I had for supper tonight and will definitely be made again and again and again.  Oh, yeah - I made them traditional style; i.e one large circle that I scored with a knife before baking.  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!

Not bad, easy to make, but I think this recipe is a a bit heavy handed on the baking powder.

Thankyou, I've been looking for  the perfect scone recipe and I found it. They were moist and slightly sweet. Perfect.  :) I used chocolate chips and walnuts.  Two of us almost ate all of them that day.

I did 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda and left out the currants as well as the topping. They are light and fluffy but a bit sweeter than I like. Portions are small so beware if you care about the calories - it's high! Will try again though.

I definitely believe that these are the world's best scones.  I didn't think they would turn out right because it's my first ever attempt at scones, but when I took that first bite, it was heavenly!  The raisins were the perfect amount of sweetness (which surprised me).  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  I'm making these again as soon as I can.

Just tried this and they turned out perfectly!  We just returned from a 3-week trip to the UK and were craving our afternoon tea and scones!  I had an open bag of organic mixed dried berries (cranberry, blueberry and cherry) so I used those.  Yum!

This scone recipe is a keeper.  I am baking some in the oven as I rate this recipe.  I have made them once before using orange flavored cranberries.  This time I am using regular cranberries and 1 tbls. lemon zest.  Can't wait to try them.  They vanished the first time around.  Very light scone almost like a biscuit.  Don't need butter or jam great flavor and wonderful warm from the oven.

These turned out beautifully. I made two batches of scones this morning. The other batch was "Ginger Scones" from Epicurious. These were much lighter, tastier, and easier to make, too!

These are delicious scones! I make them for my husband all the time and they don't take long at all! I've mixed them up by making some white chocolate-cranberry scones (adding a cup of dried cranberries and a cup of white chocolate chips) and chocolate chip scones (adding a cup of chocolate chips).     They also look/tast great with raw sugar on top! (sprinkled on after the egg wash is applied)

The name is perfect, no "tweaks"needed. This is hands down the best scone I have ever made and so simple to make. Make double because they don't last long!

I have made these 3 times now. Have been very happy with how they come out each time!  I add 1/4 t. lemon zest to the dry ingredients and when they're out of the oven I mix up a glaze with powdered sugar and lemon juice to brush on the top.  Thank you for the recipe!

These scones are amazing! I didn't put any raisins or currants in them and I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup all-purpose flour. I live in a dorm in college and my oven is horrible so I cooked them for 8 min and they were done. A little burned on the bottom, but DELICIOUS! (Now I know my oven is too hot for next time...)

I agree, these are the world's best scones!!  I am a big fan of the sour cream for added moisture.  Some scones can be too dry for my liking, but these are perfect!  I put cranberries in mine and then topped them with clotted cream to serve.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were the best scones ever!  We used chocolate chips in place of the fruit & they were awesome.  My 5 yr old, 4 yr old & I made them tonight and they turned out perfectly.  Light, fluffy and oh so yummy.  My hubby had never tried scones & doesn't like sweets, so I thought he might like these better than cookies, and I was right.  We all loved them.  Thanks for a 5 star recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I forgot to buy currants so I just made plain scones, and they are lovely!  I'm not sure what caused the metallic taste that some have complained of, as there is no hint of anything metallic in mine.  Nice texture, though almost a bit *too* crumbly, as they have a tendency to fall apart when spreading the clotted cream for my cream tea.  A small price to pay, however.  Just have some napkins handy.  Made them yesterday and am currently eating 2 that I reheated, topped with clotted cream and homemade blackberry jam, and they are just as good as they were yesterday.  Lovely!!

Fabulous recipe!  I just made these for my family using craisins and they ate the entire batch.  Made a second batch using tart cherries and they love them, too.  Next up will be apricot.  This recipe is foolproof.  Just don't overmix the dough and they will be excellent!

Sorry to break the news, but these are not the "World's Best". I would say they are a very good example of a basic scone recipe.

First time making scones EVER and they turned out GREAT!  I Brittish woman even asked ME for the recipe!  Didn't have unsalted butter, so I used regular butter and ommited the salt. I also didn't use the egg was either.

Quick, easy recipe, thanks! Might just be my oven, but had to bake about 17 minutes.  I used my Kitchen Aid to mix, and it worked great.  Not too dense, and very tasty, thanks!

This was my first try ever baking scones, and I've only baked a couple other things previously, so I was really happy with how well they came out the first try!  They took a little longer to cook for me, about twenty minutes, but my oven's slow.  I can't wait to try them with chocolate and different types of berries.

These melt in your mouth. I never really liked scones much (no matter who baked them) until I tried these. Addictive.

FIVE STARS!  Great recipe. Really simple.  TIP:  make sure the butter is really cold (I cut my butter up, thens stick it in the freezer while I mix everything else).  Also, stir as little as possible once you add the liquid.   If you want to be creative use fresh berries - I like raspberries.

This recipe is awesome. Instead of currants I used pecans and sprinkled the top with brown sugar and baked. They came out so good. Everyone raved about how great they were. You can use cinnamon and sugar mix for the top as well.

This was very tasty and easy to make! But, the dough was too soft so I added a bit more flour.

The scones were very delicious. However, the dough was too soft for me when i wanted to shape them. Maybe I need to reduce the milk and sour cream for a thicker dough next time.

Awesome!  Love the variations using cinnamon chips or even herb & cheese. I even make this using half whole wheat flour and a couple of Tbl. flaxseed for added nutritional value.  The best suggestion was to grate the frozen butter.  (Even works with margarine!)

Very nice texture and flavour.  I found it a bit dry the first time baking.  The second time around I added a bit more sour cream to the mix and it was much better.  I also decreased the baking time by 2 minutes.  My oven is crazy hot for some strange reason.  Thanks for the recipe.

Without a doubt, these are the best scones I've made to date.  I love scones and I've always made these horrible little dried-out hockey pucks...until this morning!  I am trying to be a bit more health conscious so I changed the recipe by substituting 1/4 c of the all purpose for buckwheat flour.  I also added 1/4 c of ground flax seed and 1/3 c each of pecans and dried cranberries.  I'm just guessing they are better for me but they sure taste fantastic!

I haven't made scones before and I thought they were going to turn out bad. I used margarine and the mixture ended up finer than a pea and I substituted yogurt for the sour cream because I didn't have any. I forgot to add currants/raisins. These scones turned out really well for all that! They were soft when I made them and they are still soft this morning. They are almost like the ones I get at the Scone Witch in downtown Ottawa. I am going to try different flavours now :).

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!! These are the best scones I have ever tasted hands down! I used Chocolate chips, almond slivers and cherry flavored craisons. I only used 1 T of baking powder. I also used 1/2 milk and 1/2 heavy cream. Otherwise I say follow this recipe to the t! This will be the only scone recipe I will ever use from now on! The texture of these scones is perfect! They are very moist and the egg wash makes them turn a beautiful golden brown. I absolutely could not be happier that I found this recipe!!! Thank you FriendlyFood for sharing this fabulous recipe!!!

These scones are amazing! My personal preference is chocolate chip scones, so I use chocolate chips instead of currants. I have also added orange peel for flavoring (with the chocolate chips) and that was very tasty. Everyone loves these so I always make a double batch. Excellent recipe!

I tried this recipe because I am trying to find a copy of the Caribou Coffee Cinnamon Scones.  These were pretty close they were not exactly like them but the cinnamon chips I bought were not like the chips used in teh Caribou Scones.  Not the recipes fault. Anyways these are the kind of scones I like!  I hate scones that are dense and dry.  These were very moist.  YUMMY:) I thought the recipe was very easy to make. I made it exactly as the recipe is presented. I used softened butter and mixed with the dry until incorporated and then added the wet and mixed - like the directions mentioned  do not overmix - and they turned out perfect.  I love that the ingredients are items that I would have on hand and aren't some crazy ingredients that I will not use often. I also like that there are many, many varieties you could try. Just add what flavors you like and I am sure these will turn out perfect for you:)  Also read some other reviews because there were many great suggestions I will try in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

Good scones, except when they went into the oven, they flattened out with pancakes! LOL  They were still delicious, but not like the British scones I've had.  These scones were sweeter, lighter, and more like cake.  I didn't use currants or raisins though.  Thanks for the recipe anyway! :)

I have been looking for my mothers recipe for scones forever! She passed away a little more than two years ago and with her I lost the whole Scone experience. I have found various recipes that are similar but not quite the same. These are awesome with cheddar cheese by the way!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Amazing basic scone recipe! I agree with another reviewer about someone not being a true scone fan if he or she doesn't like this recipe. More pronounced flavoring in a scone comes with the addition of optional ingredients like berries, cinnamon chips, extracts, etc. I did follow the suggestion of others by reducing the baking powder to 3 teaspoons and they still turned out great. Also, cheers to whoever suggested freezing the butter and using a cheese grater to simplify the cutting in of this ingredient. Turned a somewhat dreaded part of the mixing process into a breeze. An easy decision on 5 stars for this recipe. Many thanks!

I'm famously bad at making my Mum's scones, even though they work perfectly for her and my sister.  For a while I made lemonade scones, and while they're good, they're just not.. well... real scones.  This recipe is really easy and produced perfect tasting scones, even if they didn't look smooth and pretty like bought scones do.  They also taste great the day after.  I didn't use raisins in mine, I just made them plain and served them with butter, homemade strawberry jam, and whipped cream.  I used greek yoghurt instead of sour cream because I didn't have any (and it was 7am).  I took the advice of another reviewer and grated in the butter while it was frozen, which made it SO EASY.  Thanks for the recipe!

While these tasted great, they came out completely flat and with the wrong consistency. I'm a good cook and certainly have no problem following a recipe, but these did NOT work well. I wish I had a suggestion for how to improve them, but I really haven't the slightest idea what went wrong.

OMG! yum yum yum!  I made these for breakfast this morning and they turned out wonderful!!  My only complaint is they have a slight bitter taste, but I'm attributing that to the fact that I substituted raw sugar for white sugar.  I also used frozen blueberries instead of raisins/currents and plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream.  Definitely keeping this recipe!!

These scones tasted great.  I am debating on boiling the raisins next time so that they are a little more moist but as is, the recipe was wonderful.

Fantastic! I used my food processor to cut in the butter then transfered to a bowl before adding the liquid ingredients. I did substitute the milk for heavy cream and used blueberries instead of raisins. I made 8 scones and baked them for 13 minutes and they were very very tender and delicious. Be careful not to over bake.

Hello, i just baked these scones and they taste good. Only problem is that was my first time baking scones and i don't know if thats how the dough should be or it was just me, but it was sticky and hard to handle it, not as buns dough.So i just added little more flour. Now my only problem is that i probably don't exactly know how good scones should  taste since i only ate scone one time last week and i loved that one:) I just happened to buy one last week and it was like u guys say that is not good :) It was more dense, heavy and crunchy, i totally loved it and i hoped to bake the same. Only this recipe gave me light and fluffy  scone:) which is good as well but not what i wanted. I think maybe the scone i bought might have been done with small percentage of corn flour and lemon. If anyone who has more knowledge can help me , please write me if u know such recipe for a stronger scone.

These were a huge hit when I made them for colleagues at work. I used chopped, dried apricots (next time I'll remember to plump them up a bit before adding them to the dough) in place of the raisins, and topped each scone with a little turbinado sugar prior to baking.

Super simple and very tasty, great with tea or coffee.

So good! I didn't have sour cream so I substituted buttermilk in its place. They still turned out fantastic! Will definitely use this recipe again and again!

This is a deliciously lovely recipe.  The scones were nice and moist.  My variation: I use chocolate chips instead of raisins or currants.  Mmmm...decadent!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  I am a scone (it rhymes with "on") connoisseur.  This recipe provides a delicate crumb most neccessary for a good scone.  The only thing I do differently with my scones is I brush them with cream and sprinkle with Raw sugar prior to baking. You can vary your ingredients to come up with a wide variety of scones.  I like to add white chocolate chips and dried cherries to mine.

I made these scones to accompany Macaroni and Cheese, a traditional pairing in my house. This is a good recipe - I used regular butter (no unsalted on hand), and patted all the dough into a large circle on a cutting board. I cut the large circle into 16 wedges, pulled each apart and put them on a greased cookie sheet. This worked well; next time, I will put parchment on the baking sheet, as the egg wash "ran" making the sheet a pain to clean. No worries, the scones were tender and a good flavour.

I only changed the currants to 2 tbls. fresh rosemary. This turned out perfect. Hubby thought this was the best and put it in the keeper file.

I've made these the last two Christmas mornings.  Searched everywhere for Devon cream  (found it at World Market) and served it with raspberry jam.   As good as the scones I first tasted at the tea room outside Windsor Palace.

I soaked my raisins in rum for a couple of hours which resulted in a hint of rummy flavour.  I also tossed in a handful of toasted almond slivers.

Otherwise, I followed the recipe but after I portioned the scones out on the sheet, I covered in plastic and froze.  The next morning, I baked them for 40 minutes and they turned out just great.

Yum Yum Yum. I am not a terribly experienced baker and my scones turned out great. I took the advice of others and reduced the baking powder to 3 tsp. I also switched out cream cheese for the sour cream because I didn't have any. I added dried crannberries instead of currants and they are delicious. I will make these again and again and try all sorts of varieties. Careful.. these could become addictive.

Very good scone.  I added a little old lemon zest to give it a subtle hint of lemon.  Sticky to work with, but it gets the job done.

All I can say is wow! These scones were out of this world. The texture was a perfect combination of light & fluffy and dense(is that even possible?). I took some of the other suggestions and cut the baking powder to 3 tsp. I cut the egg wash and made a simple glaze using powdered sugar, butter, milk and a splash of lime juice.

These were not as good as I had expected. These were ok, but the other recipe I made was so much better!  This one just didn't have as much flavor, was impossible to roll and the texture wasn't quite right.

I have been making bread by hand for years and years, but this was my first time at scones.  I was honestly disappointed.  The taste was funny; I don't know if that's b/c of the fresh blended cranberries or not.  I'll keep looking.

These were very good.   I did use vanilla yogurt instead sour cream since I didn't have any sour cream.  Turned out great.  I also used cinnamon chips (like chicolate chips but cinnamon) and they turned out great!  I did notice a metalicy after taste.  I might reduce the Baking powder next time.  Thanks!

well, they're good but I'm a little confused because the ones I made could easily be mistaken for muffins. They are soft and moist and slightly sweet. I used raisins and cinnamon. So I'm wondering if that's the way scones are supposed to be? the ones I've gotten at bakeries have always been a little drier is that because they are not fresh? hmm...

In my quest for the perfect scone recipe, I tried this one.  I'm not sure if it's the "perfect" one but it's pretty darn good!!  They bake up light and fluffy and the tops are nice and crispy.  This will definately be added to my main recipe binder. Also, the dough wasn't sticky at all so no extra flour was needed.

this is an excellent & easy scone recipe! i made these beauties as directed with the exception of only slightly shaping the dough & then spacing them apart on a cookie sheet. we ate half of of our scones the first day then reheated (as recommended) the leftovers. they were delicious plain or with jam. many thanks ff!

This recipe is great and very easy.  My 15 year old step daughter wanted to make scones and even with her less the careful method they turned out great.  We used chocolate chips and just a touch of vanilla.  We also followed the advice of others and sprinkled some raw sugar on top before baking.  Wonderful.  Light and fluffy.

I made these entirely by the book, no variations. Curious to see how blueberries will work in the next batch...

2nd batch has now been made, substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream, and blueberries. Very good. I think part of this batch got a little darker than the recipe suggests, but I like them

Exactly how I like them. Slightly sweet, perfect with a cup of tea. I plan on adapting the recipe further to my own tastes. Sometimes sweet, sometimes savory.

Great scones! I wanted a lemony flavour so replaced some of the milk with lemon juice and added the zest from one lemon.  Didn't have currents, so used dried cranberries.  Worked out well!  The batter is definitely gooey and takes some work to stick together but it's worth it.

Note: If you don't have sour cream, Greek yogurt works fine.

I messed these up so bad and they STILL came out great! I started making them and too late realized I didn't have any sour cream so I substituted SILK non-dairy yogurt - blueberry, mind you - and 1/2 c. of half-n-half for the milk. The batter was so dry and crumbly I had to add more h&h just to be able to handle it, but the outcome was divine and just about the most delicious scone I've ever had. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe! I've made it many times. You can turn them into cranberry orange scones by substituting dried cranberries for the raisins and adding orange zest (1/2 orange per recipe). They are the best!

I reduced the baking soda by 1 tsp and very happy I did that because I can still taste it. Now I made a huge gaff and forgot to throw in the salt so I’ll be trying this again. The texture is perfect though. They are light and fluffy.   although mine came out flat even though I had let it rest I am hoping my next batch will taste better and I won’t forget the darn salt!

I made these for the first time for my Scottish family story. They turned out wonderfully and where a big hit. I also made the clotted cream to go with them

I didn't have milk so used cooking cream which i had at hand, instead. also used self-raising flour instead of all purpose flour + baking powder. It turned out absolutely amazing, buttery and indeed the best scones i have ever tasted!

only thing i will change next time is using half the sugar as husband felt it was too sweet for him. ;-)

Ooooohhhhh. I tried this recipe tonight with extra currants. I'm eating two hot out of the oven. So light and fluffy. I did not make them touch on the pan - they spread out a bit which probably helped the texture. Sooooo delicious. Will absolutely make these again but will try with other fruits and likely chocolate. Thank you - I've always enjoyed scones but a lot of the ones I buy are heavy on the fat. These are wonderful.

this was easy and turned out some absolutely yummy scones. They weren't overly sweet and perfect with morning coffee. I'm excited to try some flavoring variants like bacon, cheese, herbs, etc.

These are really, really good!  I only gave 3 stars because when I think of scones, I expect them to be a little sweeter.  Another receipe I use has 1/3 c sugar and I think the little bit more sugar is perfect.
These are great slightly sweet biscuits.  I put bacon and sharp cheddar cheese in mine for a more savory flavor.

Made as written except I frozen, then grated in the butter. I did not let them rest 10 mins, just put them in the oven. Mine took 20 mins. to cook through. So good, slightly sweet, but not too sweet.

My first time baking scones ever and my what a treat! My family loves them and now baking these has become a must-do on Sunday evenings! Thank you for sharing . I also found the tips in the reviews to be very helpful. Changes I have made: used yoghurt instead of sour cream and  omitted the sugar entirely. No egg  wash either and I prefer tearing the  dough over  hand rolling into balls.  (thank you for sharing this tip fellow scone baking enthusiasts! )I have made two types so far: sweet scones with fresh blueberries ( entirely without the sugar) and savoury  chili cheese scones. The latter are more popular with my peeps. Just taking a fresh batch out of the oven. Next week,  rosemary scones.

They turned out perfectly and the flavor is perfectly matched my memory of the best scones I've eaten. Added dried cherries (my favorite).  Parchment paper instead of a greased cookie sheet worked well.  I used another recipe's idea and gently packed dough into a large ball and used a chef knife to divide into eight pieces. Then, gently again, formed into round "patties"  three inches diameter by about 1.5 inches tall. 375 degree convection for 12 min worked best.

Very good recipe and easy to make with the kids. We added apples and cinnamon to the mix and they turned out great. It took a little longer to cook due to the increased moisture from the apples, so I think it was about 20 min cooking time and they turned out perfect. We will absolutely make this again.

Light and not too sweet. I mix My dry ingredients with cut up cold butter in my food processor until blended and then mix in my wet ingredients until just blended. I added dried cranberries and orange rind.  I pat it down between two pieces of parchment paper and also bake it on parchment paper. I cut it in six triangles and bake for 15 minutes. I did not do the egg wash but made a glaze with orange juice and powdered sugar over the top of hot scones. Delicious

I've never actually made a scone,  but just returned from a trip to England and am craving scones. I thought what better activity to do during a  Chicago polar vortex with  
-50 F  windchill but bake! 

I made it exact except I didn't have any raisins or currants , so I left those out.   In place of the milk I used half heavy cream and half milk.  I also added the coarse sugar on top to bake since that's how they made them in England, and added a splash of vanilla.... just cause.   I had to bake mine for 15 min. These were actually  moist ! They were THE best scones I have ever had. I cannot wait to add different combos of fruits to them and also make a savory batch! Thank you for this recipe!

I wasn't sure about sour cream in my scones, but it sure is yummy.  I added dried cherries to mine and they were out of this world good.  I didn't do the egg wash thing either as I completely forgot.  I bet the tops would be even better. 

Oh- and you know they don't have American sour cream in Scotland?  Just learned that.

Yummy and easy. I cut out 1 tsp of baking powder. I made one batch with dried cranberries and grated orange peel, and another batch with chives and shredded sharp cheddar cheese (in this batch I only used 2 T of sugar). Both were delicious.

I reduced the baking soda by 1tsp. If I make them again I will reduce by 2tsp. They leave the after taste of baking soda. They are very soft inside. Nice texture. I added 1tsp of vanilla and lemon zest. Also used craisins instead of raisins. I did not think they were sweet as some other reviewers suggested. I did drizzle with a light drizzle of powder sugar, vanilla and milk mixture.

I used self-rising flour (because of the baking powder issues).  Grated my butter.  I did add 1 tbsp. of cinnamon (wasn't enough) and used raisins.  Sprinkled the tops with raw sugar.  Egg wash gave them a nice brown and they rose nicely.  With my morning coffee, they were a nice treat.

I didn’t have milk but I used half and half and tried to mix them softly . Scooped them out of the bowl as one of the reviewers had described. They came out great and moist not dry.

I made the World's Best Scones this morning and my husband and I are now converts!  They were light, tender and so delicious we chose to eat them with just a little butter.  No need for the preserves.  The recipe, exactly as written, is perfect.  Unlike some other reviewers, I did not find the baking powder to be too much and experienced no after taste.  The  color from the egg and milk wash is beautiful and so inviting.  I am looking forward to variations, but the recipe as written cannot be improved upon.  Truly the world's best scone!  Thank you, FRIENDLYFOOD!

Follow the recipe, but use Craisins instead of currants.  Turned out great.  Will make double batch next time.  Thanks for sharing.

I made a batch this morning.  I cut the cold butter into small cubes and used a pastry cutter to work with the dry ingredients.  I used whole milk and full fat sour cream.  The dough was very sticky, so make sure you have flour available on the side.  I gently pressed the dough into a circle and cut out eight wedges.  I did not use the egg as it seemed like a waste (unless you are making scrambled eggs).  I brushed the scones with buttermilk, or you can use heavy cream.  I sprinkled vanilla sugar on the top of each scone.  It took about 17 minutes in my oven.  They were good, and I would describe the texture as crunchy biscuits that are tender, soft and fluffy inside.

I am on a scone-quest, and these are a delicious option. I only wish that the recipe and the video correlated ; the recipe says to bake them 'cozy' together and the video sets them apart. I followed the recipe and got one huge scone! They were separable, but not as pretty.I used self-rising flour and added one tsp of baking soda and just a pinch of salt. Next time, I'll skip the baking soda altogether or just use regular flour and cut the soda in half. Kind of sweet, but nice texture with the sour cream added.

These are quite good, and easy to make. My whole family enjoyed them.  I like that I could save a step by just rolling them into a balls, and then press flat, rather than patty down the entire dough, then cutting round with a biscuit cutter, or into wedge some with a knife. I substituted blueberries for the currants, and drizzled with a lemon glaze (1 c powdered sugar, 1/4 c lemon juice, zest of 1/2 lemon, and 1/2 TBS of butter, all heated over double boiler, whisking til smooth).  Served with hot Earl Grey tea.  Being true scones,  they do have a biscuit-like texture, so if you prefer the very sweet dense kind of scones you can buy at grocery store here in the U.S. , this recipe may not be for you.

First time making these with slight modifications and they were so delicious. Instead of milk I used heavy whipping cream. I added zest from one orange and use Craisins. I sprinkled raw sugar on top for added effect. Cooking time was 17 minutes.  I don’t have a sifter so as I poured dry ingredients into a fine strainer, my husband helped shake it to simulate sifting. LOL it worked.

Love this recipe! They turned out perfectly. I left out the raisins and added cinnamon (because I LOVE cinnamon.) This was my brothers' first time having a scone. One said it tasted just like a normal biscuit, while my eldest brother thought it tasted like oats! They liked them, even though they weren't sure what they were : )Definitely making these again.

Wonderful. So moist, like eating cake. I didn't have any sour cream, just used whole milk. I mixed in dried cranberries. I was very careful about mixing, and spooned the dough onto the cookie sheet, lightly touching each one. I will definitely make these again when I get some sour cream. Although I can't imagine them being any more delicious! Thanks for the great recipe !

I have made this recipe many times for my buddies at work and they are always a big hit.  I add orange zest and some of the juice from the orange to the batter and use lower sugar craisins.  I also use one egg in the batter, add a little more (salted) butter and use buttermilk cream instead of milk .

These are lighter than American scones.

To avoid the metallic taste from the high proportion of baking powder, I recommend using an aluminum-free baking powder such as Bakewell Cream (you'll need to add baking soda) or Rumford.

These turned out perfect. First time I made them they had a very bitter taste.  After looking back at what I did I realized I had used baking soda instead of powder. Made them again the next day and they turned out perfect. Crunchy on the outside moist on the inside. I did use blueberries instead of currents and they still turned out great. Definitely a keeper!

I have made these numerous times for Christmas morning or New Years morning. I accidentally added the egg to the mix instead of using it as egg wash on top, since under ingredients it says, "mix everything together."  I'm inpatient and it's early in the morning. I have made no other major recipe variation other than adding the egg, and I've made blueberry, apricot, and apple and cinnamon. Always right out of the oven I have a compote of the fruit I've baked in them warm on the stove top with melted butter. Immediately, my kids and husband grab them, drizzle with warm butter and top with the compote. Delicious! One morning my husband added a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I do top mine with sugar and I'm going to try the self rising flour and heavy cream in the morning for Easter. I also do not over work the dough. I add the flour last and lightly work it just until mixed and turn out a sticky dough onto my floured surface and cut my rounds then for baking. It's messy on the hands and cutter/glass, but the scones are amazing. Oh, one last thing, I melt butter on my baking pan and flip them once...love butter!

I was looking for a simple recipe that I could convert into something my lactose free kiddos could eat and these worked well. Changed out the butter for Smart Balance Spread and the sour cream for lactose free yogurt.

The best ever in spite of not reading the directions right to the end so I ended up dumping the beaten egg right into the dough. Just mixed it barely enough so it wouldn’t get tough and they turned out perfectly. Also liked the fact there was less handling by not having to roll them out and then cut them. Just used a tablespoon to grab a big hunk of dough and with floured hands made a ball, gave it a little pat down and into the oven. Just a wonderful texture and taste. Thank you. Have to confess I’ve been using allrecipes.com for years and I’ve never had a recipe that didn’t turn out exactly as promised.

This is a great trad Scottish recipe, not too sweet, and makes delicious scones like our Kelso Gran used to make. 

But if you want to make it a touch more 21st century, you can 
1) add the dry ingredients to a food processor, pulse a couple of times to blend, then add the butter, in 1 tbs pieces but frozen , and pulse until it's crumbs and 2) use coconut sugar, which will give you a darker flavour, very wholesome, and a few tbs of sweet or unsweetened coconut if you wish.

Really is the perfect scone. I opted for dried cranberry and zested and juiced a little fresh orange in as well. I sprinkled the top with coarse sugar for texture ~ they looked beautiful. 

Next time I may reduce the baking powder 1 tsp. as another reviewer recommended, I think the powder flavor comes through the tiniest bit too much.

Too much baking powder in this recipe. It left a strong unpleasant after taste. Definitely go with other reviewers who recommended reducing the total amount. Texture was nice though.

I have been looking for a raisin scone recipe forever.  I have tried countless recipes. My search is over. I made these scones per the recipe and they are perfect! I make cheese and green onion scones for my husband and he said he might like the raisin scones more.  Dang now I have to share. LOL

Ugh, this always cuts me off. Anyway, second time I used Craisins again and added the zest of a large orange to the dry mix and instead of the egg wash, I made an orange glaze (orange juice plus confectioners sugar) to top after baking.     Key tips are to use very cold butter to cut into the flour (i used my food processor) and to not overmix or handle the dough when you fold in the wet ingredients.  Definitely will make this version for Thanksgiving morning breakfast, as I love the marriage of cranberry and orange flavors.

This is a 5+ star recipe as written, with lots of room for adaptation. I added cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and cardamom for a chai spice flavor, and next time I want to try adding orange zest and substituting dried cranberries for the raisins. These turned out moist and flaky, just like a perfect scone should be. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

This was delicious. The suggestion by a previous commenter about freezing and grating the butter is brilliant. With no sour cream at hand, I used kefir instead and also added orange zest and craisins instead of raisins. The next time I might add a wee bit more sugar.

These scones really are excellent, though it did take me some trial and error for me to make them satisfactorily. First time I made the recipe, I followed the recipe exactly. I felt though dough was too dry (it didn't pack well- kept falling apart) and it ended up being too dense. Second time I made it, I added a little extra milk and followed other suggestions to decrease the baking powder by one teaspoon. Absolutely excellent in flavour, texture, and density.

Light and fluffy with a nice crust. Added dried cherries, chocolate chips and chopped nuts. Might need a splash of vanilla next time. Dough is very sticky so better to cut into wedges and then roll or keep wedges.

This was my first attempt at scones. They were very good except for a bitter aftertaste which was a bummer. I wonder if it was from too much baking powder.

I just finished making these and followed the recipe exactly.  I let the scones rest about 15 minutes before baking.  They were to die for!  Since I live alone, I only ate one and will freeze the rest.

I followed the recipe as it was since this is the first time I have made scones. I have to say they are wonderful. They were light and fluffy,  perfect with some homemade applebutter. Next time will add white chocolte chips and so forth to them. Great recipe and can't wait  to make them for my friends for our aftermoon tea time.

I have made this recipe multiple times and it is a hit whether I'm serving it to kids or adults! I like to substitute rum-soaked currents and use my food processor to cut the butter in. Other than that I follow this recipe to the letter. It is yummy!

Everyone loves the scones, and it is by far the most asked for snack/dessert in my house, though I do agree that it's better with less baking powder - 3 or 2 and a half teaspoon is perfectly enough.

Excellent scones!  I changed just a little.  I added 3/4 cup of dried cranberries in place of the raisins and a good tablespoon of orange zest.  In addition, I used orange juice and zest in the glaze.

Foolproof recipe for a buttery, sweet, cake-like scone.  I made them exactly as directed and baked them for 16 minutes because I used an insulated baking tray.  Next time I'll separate the scones about an inch because these spread.  Also they tested done before the tops were brown so a little more space between may allow them to brown more next time.

I had trouble bringing the dough together. There was a lot of leftover flour and butter--it didn't seem like enough liquid. I didn't want to overwork it, so I cut up the dough and kept it very rustic. They were good! I just wish that so much of the flour and butter hadn't been wasted. Next time I'll try a bit more liquid.

This is a really great recipe! I will come back to this the next time I make scones. I made them as an alternative to Irish soda bread for St. Patrick's Day and they came out wonderfully. I added a tablespoon of caraway seeds, but otherwise, followed the instructions to a tee. They come out light and fluffy, not too sweet with a perfect texture.

A couple of notes that I wanted to make were that first off, if you want to make more, you're better off by making separate batches rather than doubling or tripling the recipe. Since you have to be so careful in not over-mixing the dough, a smaller volume is much easier to work with.

This is the first time that I had tried grating the butter. It was far less of a pain in the butt than I had anticipated and I really think it made a huge difference! I measured and sifted the dry ingredients the night before so I could get right to it in the morning. A tip that I would like to add is to keep the grated butter in the freezer overnight. It's much easier to work with and more resistant to melting so quickly.

This is a wonderful recipe and think that it really lends itself to variation. I will try this replacing the milk with eggnog and swapping the raisins for cranberries the next time I make these.

I reduced baking powder as stated by others. I used a cheese grater for my butter (right out of refrigerator) and did let the dough rest 20 minutes or so before shaping and cutting.  Made two versions: blueberry lemon and cranberry orange. No egg wash, just brushed with milk and a sprinkle of sugar. Oh my! Just a perfect little slice of heaven. I tried three recipes this weekend. This is by far , My favorite recipe for scones!!

I have been on the hunt for a recipe that replicates the scones we tried at the Pump Room in Bath, our favorite scones while traveling across England..a trip that included many teatimes with scones and clotted cream.  I'm thrilled to say that this is the closest recipe yet!   These scones have the perfect balance of delicate fluffiness inside and delicate crust on top.  I made the recipe with the full 4 teaspoons of baking powder as instructed in the recipe and didn't notice any metallic off-taste (per other user comments...perhaps it's the brand they were using?).   I also made them by hand, not with a food processor as other recipes suggest, and it was very easy.  Instead of overworking the dough to incorporate the last bit of flour mixture, I used that little bit to dust my hands before shaping the dough. Fantastic recipe. My thanks to the lovely person who took the time to perfect her grandmother's recipe and then share it with us.

I never made scones before and I followed other reviewers recommendations and reduced the baking powder by 1 teas. and froze the butter in order to grate it into the flour mixture.  These were easy!  My husband and I enjoyed them for breakfast and with tea later in the day.  I added this recipe to my "to-go recipes" and will definitely make them again!

Excellent recipe!  The ingredients were right on, and I followed exactly, with only a few minor exceptions:
- Used 5 TBS salted butter; omitted salt.
- Mixed dry ingredients in a glass bowl and then added to food processor with the butter.  Gave it just a few whirls in the processor to incorporate butter into dry ingredients, and dumped all back into the glass bowl; stirred-in raisins.   
- Whisked the milk (I used half-n-half) and sour cream in a small glass bowl, and dumped into bowl containing dry ingredients.  
- Gently stirred together until almost all flour was incorporated.
- Patted all of the dough in a greased-and-floured (Baker's Joy spray) 9-inch tart pan.  Sprinkled with Sparkling Sugar (King Arthur).  
- Baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes (convection oven).  
Scones turned out PERFECTLY--lightly browned with a moist, tender crumb.  Next time, I will try adding a little vanilla for additional depth.  Great, uncomplicated recipe--thank you for sharing!!

This is without a doubt the best scone recipe I've found in a lifetime of baking scones (and that's a LONG time).  They're rich and moist on the inside and golden and crisp on the outside...just the way a scone should be.  I'm ditching all my other scone recipes.  I made them exactly as the recipe states.  The dough is a little sticky so instead of using my hands to make the 3 inch balls, I used a 2 1/2 inch ice cream scoop, placed them on the baking sheet and flattened them slightly with a floured hand.  I can't wait to try them with different flavorings.  I wish I could give them more stars...

I made these with currants and they are to die for with strawberry jelly and tea. I had a gross time making the butter into little balls. It's hard for me to find something in my kitchen to work with butter out of the fridge. So, that's a work in progress. I guess another option is to get a really sharp knife and just cut the butter into very small cubes.In the end, that's not much different from little hand formed pebble-sized balls.

I needed a recipe that tasted like the scones I made at home in Wales after I found that self-raising flour was very difficult to find in the part of Canada that I now live in! I love this recipe plus when I phoned home and told my Mum the ingredients, she said that this was the recipe my Nana had used before WWll ... so how can it not be perfection??!!

Great recipe. Didn't change anything, but  I reduced the baking powder to 3 tsp per the other reviews. I also grated frozen/harder butter and it made it a lot easier for me. I made three variations. 1.Chocolate chip with a little cinnamon and vanilla. 2. Cranberry with orange zest and a little of the juice. 3. Raspberry with lemon zest and a little of the juice. All turned out great!

I made these both the regular way and also modified them to be gluten free and butter free ( I substituted coconut oil for the butter and it was AWESOME!!!!)  Truly an easy and yummy recipe that has become a family favourite!

I was looking to copy the scones  I had at Harrod's in London- and this is a pretty good copy.  The texture is lighter, but the taste is very close.  This is more of a traditional British scone- not cake-like or sweet.  Fabulous with Easy Devonshire Cream (recipe on this site) and lemon curd or black currant jam.
 Now- the changes:  as others said, 3 tsp baking powder.  
I don't sift, ever.  Sorry.  They turned out great anyway.
I don't cut butter into things; I used a cold stick of butter, on the large size grater, and grate it in.
 The recipe says you'll get 'pea-sized lumps'- I didn't get those.  Probably because of my grating thing.
Apparently, if you want a heavier texture on the scone, you can cut down on the baking powder even more, but I haven't tried that yet.  We like these so much, I don't think I'll mess with them any further!

I used dates and it was delicious!   I did not do the egg wash.   I made it but forgot about it.   Love the recipe.  Will do it again but not use self raising flour. I'll use less baking powder than suggested as I could taste it.  I'm not usually bothered by it.   If I do dates again I would not add sugar as the dates made it sweet enough. 

This was the first successful scone I've ever made.   Thanks for sharing.

Don't forget the vanilla. Reduce b.powder by 1 tsp. (NOTE: Self-rising flour requires no bp.) Subs may include plain yogurt for sour cream;  buttermilk or half&half for milk. Reduce butter to about 3 tablespoons and they're still delicious. Freeze the butter and grate into mix. After "rubbing" the butter into the dry ingredients with your bare hands, place bowl in freezer for a few mins. to re-solidify the butter. THE TRICK:  not over-working the dough.  Suggested: Avoid overmixing by using  your cast iron skillet - score dough into wedges and bake. GO SAVOURY! Ham & onion plus cheddar chunks/grated parmesan and a little salt & pepper or garlic powder on top. Or, try chopped chives or basil & oregeno with cubed cheddar, gouda or edam and top with shredded cheese or sesame seeds. Omit the sugar! OTHER COMBOS: Fresh raspberries & white choco chips. Lemon & blueberry. Orange & cranberry. Orange & choco chip. Orange & cinnamon/nutmeg/ginger.

Hello! While I liked this recipe very much I did not like the butter measurement aspect:  Call me silly but tablespoons of butter? I ended up melting the butter to a pudding-like  consistency and went with it. I just wish we'd all use metric measures. Living and cooking in Germany got me into weighing almost all ingredients, making for great accuracy. Anywho the scones were excellent!

These were definitely the best scones I have ever had. I used 1/3 cup of butter instead of measuring out 5 tbsps, reduced the baking powder to 2 tsps, omitted the salt and brushed the tops with cream. My #50 scoop yielded 9 scones that baked in 14 minutes on a Silpat lined sheet. My guests raved about them, will double next time!

I did everything to the T in term of process and ingredients and it turned out really good. The only thing that are different is the time required to cook it which is understandably variable according to your oven temperature and setting and the size of your scones. My friends and husband loved it and wonder why I only make one batch :)

These turned out wonderfully! They're very soft and fluffy.
Mine spread out a bit more on the cookie sheet than I thought they would, so they came out somewhat flat-ish (1/4" or so high), though that didn't affect tastyness at all!

Excellent recipe.
Good advice not to work the dough.
Reduced the baking powder to two teaspoons and used yogurt instead of sour cream.

These turned out really well! I had to tweak it a little because I didn't have any sour cream, so  substituted with Vanilla Light & Fit Greek Yogurt. I also made mine with dried blueberries and a bit of lemon zest. I just pulled the dough instead of cutting it, and brushed the egg wash on top but I didn't sprinkle any sugar as I usually would have. I was worried that the vanilla yogurt would make them too sweet, but it didn't, they're awesome! I  like to trick of keeping the dry ingredients in the freezer while you're prepping the wet ingredients and greasing your baking sheet... keeps your butter nice and cold, which is perfect! This is definitely my new go-to scone recipe!

I sought a scone recipe after having the most amazing, rich scones of my life at a high tea shop in San Diego (tea upon chatsworth in point Loma). I have to be honest, I was very skeptical of this recipe when I saw how basic it was. I am pretty skillful with making flaky crusts, but based on reviews on handling the  dough minimally, I aired on the side of safety and kneaded the dough only briefly in a ziplock bag. The dough was very crumbly and I barely grabbed scoopfuls and to make loosely assembled balls into which I stuck frozen blue berries just before placing the balls on the buttered sheet. I baked for 20 minutes instead of 15 and they were a nice golden color. They hold together so well and are really rich and tasty. All measurements are right on for this recipe. I also made some clotted cream (easy Devonshire cream recipe found on this site/app!) to go with, and that recipe is phenomenal as well- so good!

Yummy! Flaky buttery goodness. I followed recipe except replaced currants with craisins and orange zest. Made about 12 drop biscuits that required baking for almost the full 15 in my oven. I was concerned at first when the dough was so flaky it was falling apart on the cookie sheet before baking, but it still turned out great! Adding this to my favorites box.

These are absolutely perfect-don't change a thing.  I know what is good, believe me.  I am 72 and love food and the older I get the more I appreciate a great recipe.  I bake these and store them in the freezer, reheat at 350 for 10 minutes and they are just like fresh baked.

Great recipe! I've probably made it 10+ times now. I was able to veganize it by using soy milk, earth balance and replaced the sour cream with vanilla soy yogurt. I usually add frozen blueberries (instead of raisins or currants) and make a quick lemon glaze to drizzle on top. I skip the egg wash.  I've made it with and without the egg wash and it doesn't seem to make much of a difference. Beats Starbucks scones any day!

They're so crip on the outside and soft on the iinside with  great texture, and the flavor is rich . Be sure your butter is cold and use a very light hand! The less you handle this dough, the better your scones will be.

I'm no scone expert.  I have only made scones once before and that was a long time ago.  I made this recipe exactly as stated except I added a tablespoon of orange rind and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.   Apparently, this recipe is the REAL DEAL as the author claims.  The scones were a smash hit at my coffee break girl's party.  Many begged for recipe!   Only 5 stars because there isn't 6.

Yup.  The name says it all.  World's Best Scones!  I was testing out 2 scone recipes.  One was for Orange Scones and from another site.  It came out great and I thought it was a winner.  Then I made these.  They were soooo good, they made the first (pretty good) recipe seem unworthy.  I may use this recipe and add orange zest, omitting the currents, to see if I can morph this into a new and improved Orange Scone recipe.  BTW, I used my food processor to incorporate the butter rather than a pastry blender.  Pulsed a few times and it was perfect consistency and so quick. Oh, and I used the full amount of BP.  Worked fine for me but I saw some others thought it too much.
UPDATE:  I read more of the negative reviews and saw that many referred to a bad taste or metallic taste. I looked at my container of baking powder  and noticed it actually says "aluminum-free".  Perhaps those peoples' BP had a bad taste because theirs was not aluminum-free.  The brand I have is "Rumford".  Just a thought.

Look no further - these are fabulous!!!  I made two batches: chocolate chip and lemon blueberry.  Used 3t baking powder for each, and grated frozen butter; otherwise followed recipe.  For chocolate:  added 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chips and topped with cinnamon sugar (I'd leave out the cinnamon next time - was good, but don't need it).  For lemon blueberry: added 1/2 cup large frozen blueberries, zest and juice of one small lemon.  Topped the lemon blueberry with lemon glaze (1c powdered sugar, 1/2t butter, zest and juice of one lemon - microwaved for 30 seconds.  Glaze was good, but also don't need it).   Will keep trying different variations for fun, but these are perfect as-is.   Thank you for a great recipe!

This is hands down the best scone recipe I've made.  I changed it as follows to taste:  used mixed berries, almond milk and greek yogurt (instead of sour cream).  they came out crunchy on outside and dense but still light/fluffy on the inside.  I'll make these over and over. Thanks!

I made these for my mother on Mother's Day, and she has raved about them ever since. They were perfectly moist, soft and warm on the inside. Superb recipe, I would (and will) make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly the first cooking time. Taste great when hot but little bit bitter when cool down. Then I noticed some comments about this and was scared about the unhealthy content in baking powder. Second time, I cut the baking powder from 4 tsp to only 2.5 tsp according to some other scones' recipe and can hardly notice the difference. Very easy and tasty recipe!

Best scones ever! Since I had a lot of self rising flour at home I substituted that for all purpose flour and only added a pinch of salt and eliminated the baking powder. I also substituted non-fat plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. Instead of dried currant I used a mixtures of dried currants, raisins and cranberries. I also followed another review and froze the butter and used a grated to grate it into the dry ingredients and used my hands to combine. This recipe is definitely a keeper! I can't wait to make a savory version with cheese and jalapeño.

I've made these scones 4 or 5 times.  Always trying something different for flavor, pears, apples, etc with appropriate spices.  They are awesome!!  Wonder what would happen if I used a mashed, ripe banana and some chocolate chips???  I'll let you know....

I gave it 3 stars for taste but the texture was much too cake like to be called a scone. I knew the recipe was off when I noticed that the dough was much too moist. The other thing was I noticed that there was  baking powder in the recipe instead of baking soda. Baking soda is much more traditional.

I use this site for new recipes... or to make something I've tried at a restaurant etc, to make on my own.  A couple of weeks ago we visited my father in law. While looking for something for breakfast I found 4 scones carefully wrapped in saran wrap. He buys his bread and such at a local German bakery. Yes, a German bakery has scones! Anyways... I placed one in the toaster oven, it was a wonderful Cranberry Scone!  It made me crave scones...  

I found this recipe after looking through several and for a novice scone baker they turned out WONDERFUL!  The first batch I made turned out to be plain scones because I was being SO careful to not overwork the dough I forgot the raisins!  (currants are hard to find here)  I was forced(?) to make a second batch, esp after the plain ones were so good!  The second batch was fantastic also!  They are bit thinner than what I'm used to.  That may be something I'm doing, maybe rolling them out to far? 

I had a problem with the cranberry batch last week, they seemed dry to me... but my daughter in law said she enjoyed them! Any idea?

We love this recipe and other than the one of 4 batches they are great!

Was really in the mood for scones this morning.  No buttermilk, no cream for my usual recipes but....I did have sour cream!  Found this Scottish scone recipe and gave it a shot! Followed the recipe exactly with just the addition of some maple syrup. Oh my....these were so light and yummy. Can't wait to try this recipe for savoury scones!  They would be  terrific with the homemade soups we love during the winter!!

Makes great scones!I do recommend using very cold butter (I get the butter out of the freezer just before I start working. I start with cubed butter, cut that in with a pastry knife and then work it with my hands for a minute. I have done several variations with this recipe. The favorite, so far is white chocolate chip lemon lavender scones. Muddle the sugar with 1 teaspoon of lavender. Switch currents with white chocolate chips, add the zest of one lemon and two teaspoons of lemon extract.

Wow! These were amazing! They weren't dry (I have found many scones tend to be dry and hard to eat) and tasted wonderful! I used golden raisins and topped it with an orange glaze, which was wonderful! I made it with a little less baking powder, which I would recommend, but it was wonderful overall!

These are the best scones I have ever made!!! I made them for Mother's Day and my sister ate ten of them! They were that good. Everyone kept begging me to make them again, and everyone also thought they were bakery bought! I remade them and they turned out just as good. The only adjustments I made was using two thirds of the sour cream recommended, and using Heavy whipping cream for the last 1/3 of the mesherment. This respie is decently worth making!

The best scone recipe I've ever tried! I used soft, dried cranberries and chopped them into smaller pieces. I added the cranberries to the wet mixture before adding it the dry mixture. After using the egg wash I sprinkled regular sugar on the top of a very crunchy sweet top. I did taste a bit of the baking powder so I will try using a little less next time. All in all, great! I can't wait to try some of the other combinations that have been suggested.

I have baked this with Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and fresh cranberries, which taste-wise turned out fantastic. I only wish they would turn out a bit more upright.

Love this recipe.  I have used scone box mixes and loved the King Arthur mixes, but decided to try to make them from scratch and selected this recipe from the internet search.  I selected this recipe due to the ingredient of sour cream, which intrigued me.  I very glad I did.  I love the lightness of the scone and the taste as well. I found the recipe to be easy and fast.  Eaten with my homemade clotted cream was just the perfect touch to a perfect scone.

First time that I have had success with scones.  I made them in my mixer, froze the butter and grated it in.  I used cranberries.  Also, I did not make individual scones but I used a 9x9 glass pyrex and placed the whole mixture in , flattened it and cut the mixture into squares with a knife.  This really avoided handling the dough too much.

These were great!

Lovely scones!  I used fresh cranberries instead of raisins, added lemon rind to the dough, and a lemon glaze after baking.  I also used a food processor to incorporate the butter.

This is one of my favorites to use. It's a great base recipe to play with different flavors. I find that using a large ice cream dishes is easier than the making balls and flattening. They tend to be tenderer too when to treat the dough that way. :)

I made the recipe exactly as printed and the dough was very sticky-I ended up putting chunks on parchment paper and they needed at least another 8 minutes in the oven but very tasty-I added zest of 1 lemon to the dough also

I tried this recipe and absolutely loved it! I was surprised at how quick and easy they are to make, and very light and tasty. Definitely better than store-bought scones. The only thing I did differently is added a couple of teaspoons more sugar, as I like my scones on the sweeter side.

OMG!!!! Hands down best scone ever !!! All that I did was tweak it a little. Shaped them into triangles made them thin spread sum fresh fruit that I heated with sugar, spread inside rolled them up like croissants and formed into balls. Another alternative was adding a tablespoon of orange juice and a teaspoon of orange zest. mmm yummy! huge hit with my daughter btw a very picky kid demands that I make them for her every Sunday. :)

Great recipe. I used Greek yoghurt i.s.o. sour cream (because that's what I had in the fridge) and I think it gave the scones a light touch. Only 10 minutes in the oven on 200C was enough! Almost burned them, but didn't :-) Made a few with raisins (for me) and a few without (for my 5 year old twins). We like to eat them with raspberry jam or butter and honey.

Great recipe and easy to follow! Changes made - used pomegranate craisins in lieu of the currants, and added some lemon zest. I also did not do the egg wash. Sufficiently sweet, but not overly so. Everyone loved the scones, including my 2yo and 8yo. A great brunch item or a breakfast treat.

I made several dozen of these for the husband to take to his Monday work meeting so I was really banking they would be delicious - and they were! I decided to use cranberries and also added some orange zest to the dry ingredients before adding the sour cream and milk. I made an orange icing that I drizzeled over the top 'Starbuck's' style. Rave reviews from everyone at his work as well. I also made a batch with cinnamon and raison, since that is the husband's favorite, and it turned out very well. This is a keeper recipe and I plan on making blueberry lemon ones next.

First time i've ever made scones, so was really nervous about it. Turned out great though. Made 12 of them and between 3 people they were gone in one meal. Topped with strawberry jam they tasted delicious. Will definitely make again.

These are a nice texture but more like biscuits than scones if you ask me.  I added chai spice to the dry ingredients and then, chopped fresh cherries instead of currants.  I also topped with an almond glaze to make a bit sweeter as these are not too sweet.  Would be good with savory add-ins - i.e. would be like a savory biscuit:)

I made this recipe yesterday morning.  I'd never made scones before.  I enjoyed getting my hands nice and dirty mixing the butter into the dough!  Eating them was even better!  I think I baked them a little too long (my oven is old and wonky), but they were delicious!  The insides were very tender and the outside had a light crispness that was wonderful!  I used blueberries instead of currants and want to try all sorts of different fruits now!

Indeed the best scones!  They are delicious beyond five stars.  I followed the recipe to a T but instead of currants or raisins I've used fresh blueberries and grated cheddar cheese.  If using the cheese don't add the sugar because they will not be savory - just sweet and cheesy (weird combination).  For the blueberry ones I sprinkled some sugar on top of the egg wash (another reviewer suggested this) and it was a nice addition.  Thanks you FriendlyFood, I am on my 3rd batch today!  My kids won't stop eating them.

Instead of dried currants/raisins, I made cinnamon scones by adding 1 tsp cinnamon to the dough and then sprinkling cinnamon/sugar mixture over the top of scones right before baking. Also reduced the butter to 4 TBS. My husband doesn't have a sweet tooth and he loved them because they weren't too sweet and were light and moist. We will be making this recipe again with other variations.

I made these with dried apricots cut into small pieces instead of raisins or currants. The results were AMAZING. My mom and I ate a whole plate of these, and I ended up having to make more for the tea party they were supposed to be for. Sweet, but not too sweet, perfect with a little melted butter or clotted cream. I highly recommend this recipe to everyone.

Amazing!  I prefer sweet stuff, so I substituted 1/2 cup chocolate chips for the currants and sprinkled sugar on top before baking.  These were as good as Whole Foods chocolate chip scones and maybe even better.

Coming back to my review to add this comment.  My daughter's boyfriend is from Northern England.  I made these for breakfast during one of his visits, and he said they are better than any scones he's ever had in England.  Good job, Friendlyfood!

Great!! Very similar taste and texture to my own favorite recipe. Made just a few minor changes. Used 1 Tbsp baking powder, scant 1/4 cup sugar, 1/3 cup skimmed milk, Fat free sour cream, and grabbed "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" not realizing it till after the fact.  Used mini chocolate chips too.  It really is not necessary to grease the baking sheet. Did not bother with egg wash this time. Thanks Friendlyfood.

Delicious and so simple!  I followed the recipe to the letter with the just two alterations.  First, I used cinnamon chips rather than the currents.  Second, after brushing the tops with the egg wash, I topped the scones with a mixture of sugar and freshly ground cinnamon.  I will most definately be making these again and again, playing with different variations.

these scones are amazing! this was my first time making scones and they were VERY easy to make for the beginner baker. i am a nursing mom on a non-dairy diet (free of all milk protein) so i substituted "earth balance buttery spread" for the butter, tofutti "better than sour cream" for the sour cream and silk soy milk for the milk. no one would ever be able to tell that any non-dairy substitutions were made. i used craisins instead of raisins and added 1/2 cup walnuts. BLISS!

I was craving scones with cinnamon chips like I've had at a local coffee shop so I tried this recipe and I'm glad that I did.  I reduced the baking powder to 3 tsp. because I live at high altitude and they came out great with no bitter after-taste.  I also subbed Greek yogurt for the sour cream with no problem.  I used salted butter and also added the 1/8 tsp. salt and they were not too salty.  I will make these again....someday, but too high calorie to have on a regular basis, especially since I find it hard to eat only one.

Great recipe!  Light scones, easy to do. Made these many times now using a range of dried fruits - cranberries, cherries etc. Won't go back to my old recipe. Well done and thanks

Not only are these simply the best scones I've ever eaten, this is this first scone recipe I've tried that's actually turned out. Great with some 'mock' clotted cream and a little lemon curd.

This was a great recipe and relatively easy to follow, especially with guidance from the comments. I did a trial run of these for my coworkers and they couldn't stop eating them! Then I made them again for a special tea party I was hosting, served plain with jam & Devon cream. They were a hit! People were fighting over who got the last ones! Next time I'll try mixing in some dried fruits or choco chips for variety. As a novice baker these were easy to make with great results!

These were ok, not a lot of flavor in my opinion.  My husband liked them but he is not a huge sweet fan.  I used blue berries, but I was a little dense and didn't keep them frozen so they broke down a bit.  I don't think I'll make these again.

this is my first time for scones and I might stay that I'm making this again. I made it plain then, I fill it with raspberry jam and creme fraice. I also used creme fraiche instead of sour cream. Five stars!

I've never had scones.  I've never wanted scones.  So what in the world was I thinking when the idea to make them popped in my head.  I followed the recipe exactly except for 2 insignificant changes (substituted 3/4c of the flour with whole wheat flour and adding Craisins instead of raisins).  They really turned out tasty.  I did freeze the butter, as suggested by earlier reviewers, and grated it into the dry mixture.  And I have to admit, in a last minute act of desperation, I panicked that my family (used to Oreos and Chips Ahoy) would find these bland.  So....I did whip up Vanilla Glaze (also from this site) and spread it on top to make them sweeter.  Overall though, these are good without being too sweet (or too bland).

Can you say FABULOUS!? Totally the best scones ever. I'm an American over here in Austria.. without measuring cups or anything, so i use a real cup, and real tea spoons, and was really worried these wouldn't turn out because i was trying to picture how much butter to use. In the end, it all just turned out amazing. So light and fluffy! My boyfriend didn't even know what scones were, but he was very happy with the result. I'm going to get more creative with them. Thanks!

The name does not lie.  I have achieved celebrity status with this recipe.  To make it more healthful, I add ground up flax seed and keifer in place of the milk.

This recipe is incredibly easy and delicious. I made this for a holiday breakfast. Several of my friends are concerned about what they eat, so I used whole wheat pastry flour, Splenda baking blend, soymilk and fat free sour cream. Even with the changes the scones were great. The tip on grating frozen butter was fantastic, made it even easier to incorporate the butter with the dry ingredients.

I made this recipe exactly as it stands.  Using only my fingers and hands.  When I poured the milk and sour cream in, I barely worked the dough.  It was just wet, but not smooth or anything.  With floured hands, I put them into balls and made them into large scones.  Absolutely perfect.  Didn't use any freezer or anything, but I think this also depends on what time of year you make this, as it's cold and in winter.  I had the butter only lightly softened at room temp.  Perfect.  Serve with clotted cream and strawberry jam.

I love this recipe!! Freezing the butter definitely makes your life easier and makes the consistency quicker to achieve. I have always used frozen berries- the moisture adds to the dough making them perfect. Looking forward to making them in a savory version!

These scones are light and fluffy, not too sweet, perfect for breakfast!  I made a batch plain, one with craisins, and one with chocolate chips.  There wasn't a crumb left!  I will definitely make these again.

WOW! I love scones, and these are the best I have ever made by far.  I followed the recipe exactly, being careful not to overwork the batter.  I didn't have any raisins on hand so I used semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Heavenly!!

I made these with the substitution of craisins and white chocolate chips.  They are wonderful.  Not dry at all, and incredibly easy to make.  I've made these for a staff breakfast at school, and I'm sure they will be a hit!

I made this recipe for the first time, and substituted 1/3 cup finely diced crystallized ginger (I'm a huge ginger fan) for the raisins. They are so light and fluffy, I ate two right after making them!

These are a WOW!  This was my first time making scones, never knew how easy they were to make.  I followed the recipe except I replaced the sour cream with plain yogurt and I put a little sugar on top.

so good!  i used margarine and brown sugar because i didn't have butter or white sugar and they were still delicious.  i will be making these again soon because they are probably worth 6 stars when made with butter.

Wonderful basic scone recipe!  I like my scones light and fluffy, so these were perfect. :) I substituted bread flour for the AP flour, and added in 1tsp of cinnamon, vanilla, and orange extract, as well as a handful of chocolate chips.  YUM!

I am not a big scone fan, but I randomly decided to make them today... Wow, I am surprised. I made some with just what is in the recipe, and they taste great! I also added to part of the dough vanilla, apple, and cinnamon. They are really good! Fluffy, and sweet!

I have never made scones before but they turned out perfect. I used a tablespoon of baking powder after reading that they were too airy. I also didn't have enough sour cream so I used plain yogurt. I was wondering if anyone had any different ideas about what to put in them?

Good, good! Capital, capital! These scones are most excellent!! I made them for a mother's day high tea and everyone loved them. I made them very small, so as to be bite-sized, and I sprinkled sugar on top before baking, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. They are great to eat alone or with jam and cream. Wonderful.

This is the best scone recipe!!! I took the baking powder down to 3 tsp.  I  just like it better. These scones are the perfect delivery system for clotted cream and strawberry jam.  Do not over mix!!

This is an excellent scone recipe and fairly versatile.  It worked great the first couple of times so on my third batch I used medium wholemeal flour instead of the all purpose flour.  Then I drizzled a little honey into the dough (after it had been totally mixed) and worked that in.  I bake for my friends all the time and these are definitely their favorite.  Thanks!

came out great! i didn't have sour cream so i used heavy cream, like another reviewer, and they still came out so fluffy and gorgeous, crisp on the outside. skipped the dried fruit, as i like plain scones. made these for a "high tea" with homemade lemon curd, homemade raspberry jam, and homemade mock clotted cream yesterday - and i'm having a fantastic breakfast right now!

Yes, you are all right.  These are the best scones.  They are crispy on the outside, and light and fluffy on the inside.  I added dried cherries instead of raisins.  Awesome.

This recipe is very good, I add a teaspoon of vanilla essence to the mix or a tablespoon of ginger for a different taste

Really wonderful scones.  Used dried cranberries and 3 tsp baking powder.  Tasted great with salted or unsalted butter.  Made 10.

This recipe is truly the best scone recipe I have ever tried. I actually stopped making it for a little while because the scones would be eaten before I could get the dishes cleaned up! These are wonderful served with clotted cream, like the recipe says, and a little of your favourite jam. Perfect for afternoon tea!

This really was a good recipe. I cut the baking powder down, but overall, a great one.
