These had an excellent flavor and chewy texture--on the outside edges that were cooked correctly.  The middle was very "sludgy" and remained so even after an extra 15 minutes of cooking.  I think next time I'll try it in an 11 x 7 pan, and perhaps drop the oven temperature to 325.  I used dried cranberries, they were a wonderful replacement for the raisins.

These were good, but I think they would have been better if I'd followed the recipe exactly. I fudged a little on the brown sugar because I ran out, and so I added a cup of mixed powdered sugar and molasses. I do not recommend this, as the molasses takes over the flavor.

This needed tweaking for the shortbread.  I used butter and left out the raisins.  I added raspberries for contrast flavors.  It looked brown on top when it was done, so I might cook the base differently.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was more of a cake than a true lemon bar. It looks nothing like the picture provided. If i wanted to make lemon bread I will use this recipe. Otherwise I will look else where for a true lemon bar.

This did not turn out how I expected. Did NOT look anything like the picture or lemon bars I ahve made in the past. Tastes ok, but wasn't what I wanted...

It did not turn out anywhere like a lemon bar but a bread or cake. Even the color was wrong: it is a very brown with no yellow.

saw this recipe a few years ago in 2009 and have been making it since!!!! I love it. I love lemons and this is great! A family favorite as well. I have to remember to take a photo the next time I make it. Next time ill make it into a shape!. It is very sweet, so for certain family member I have to tone it down. I did make a few adjustments as I learned to make it but still great!
