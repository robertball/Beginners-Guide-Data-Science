Good flavor from the herb mix. The top of the chicken was cooked at the end of cooking time but not the bottom nor the potatoes. I ended up having to cook them separately to get them both done. I think I would make this again with a few revisions on the procedure and cook the chicken directly in the pan without the rack. Thanks for the recipe!

This was not horrible, just not that great.  The chicken was moist, but the flavour was a little dull.  The potatoes were dry, I had to add more oo in the midst of cooking.  Maybe this would be better on the bbq.

I made it without the potatoes and perhaps that's why it was a little dry. Very tasty and easy to make.

This was very tasty.  Next time I would add a bit more salt, but overall it was delicious just as the recipes directs.

Meh.  I was unimpressed with this.  The chicken was nice and tender, but I thought the flavors were pretty uninspired.  Just so-so...and I'll likely not make it again.

I made this for dinner last night - and it was pretty good - but nothing spectacular.  It's relatively impressive for a beginner, I may try it again, but will add a bit more Dijon.

The flavor was good but not strong enough. Next time I will add more mustard and more lemon and maybe some white wine to the pan. The potatoes however did not cook at all. I think maybe adding some foil to the top to steam the potatoes would help but since the recipe didn't call for it I tried without and that was a mistake.

Chicken was good, but make sure you leave it in there much longer than 1:30, we ended up leaving it in there almost 2 hours on 375.

This was really good but I added a bit more dijon than the recipe called for, as well as adding more salt, pepper, and a few other seasonings just to add a little extra flavor.  I will make this again for sure though!
