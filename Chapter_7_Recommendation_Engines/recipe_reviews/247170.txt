It I will make it again. However, I cut back on the amt. of oil & used sesame oil instead of veg. oil. It was still too oily. Next time I'll reduce the liquid even more. Instead of Sriracha, I used a pinch of Cayenne, despite the fact  I love Sriracha. I then substituted rice wine vinegar w/cider vinegar. Since cider vinegar is far more potent than rice wine vinegar, I cut back on the amount used. Overall the recipe was great as a side to a barbecue sandwich. As usual, allrecipes.com, thanks for turning me onto new taste sensations.

I made this dressing for fish tacos topper, so I added 1/2 Lime juice, and 1/4 cup honey and only used fine Nappa cabbage and Shredded carrots. I shook the dressing in a jar and kept separate till serving. Rave reviews from a self proclaimed "picky foody"...Will definitely do some other ingredients to change up a marvelous dressing. How about ginger and sai- fun in a slaw?

I made it exactly like the recipe is. I  like spice and enjoyed the sweet of the honey with the back round of siracha. OMG I made some up for all the neighbors. This will be a regular staple in our home,Thanks so much for this wonderulrecipe.

Spivey and tasty.  Didn’t add the nuts, didn’t have any but was great anyways. A side dish to go with Korean tacos
