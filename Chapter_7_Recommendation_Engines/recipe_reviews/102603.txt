This recipe should say to use a "Fully cooked" ham. If using an uncooked ham, follow the directions on the wrapper.

I regularly make ham to be able to make soup the next day, and the recipe I used previously was good but fairly ingredient intensive.  This recipe was quick, easy and tasted great.  I used a spicy brown mustard, as that is what I had in the fridge.  It gave it a nice zip.  The ham was both sweet and savory at the same time.  I will definately be using this for my everyday hams from now and probably even my special occassion hams also.

Easy and delicious.  I had to improvise: The store was out of bone-in ham, so I used a pre-cooked, 2lb ham.  I didn't have maple syrup so I substituted with honey.  My husband raved!

Very nice ham. I used a 9 pound spiral sliced precooked ham and this turned out very well. I did not adjust the baste even though the ham was bigger and it was plenty. My son thought it was the best ham he ever ate. I admit I even had to get just one more piece even after I thought I was full. My husband doesn't like cloves and this was perfect for him too since it is one of the few recipes I've found without it. Nice balance of the mustard and the sweet, it wasn't too much one or the other.

Was very easy to make. Substituted honey for the maple syrup, dijon mustard for the yellow mustard, and omitted the onion powder..turned out great!!

I made this as described, but I left out the onion powder..  I used a 10 lb. butt portion ham, and put everything in an oven bag.  It came out great!  Moist, tender, and oh so flavorful!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was a hit!  I made this for easter and everyone was raving about the taste and the smell.  I used a 9lb. ham instead of a 5lb. and there was plenty of sauce to cover the ham 3 times.

I made this glaze for our Easter ham and it was really good...although I used a 10lb ham and it was plenty of glaze for that.  I will use this glaze again for sure, but next time I might switch out half of the prepared mustard for Dijon.

The concept of this recipe is good and works well in principle. For my family dinner I use a 9lb butt end Bone-In Ham and before any preperation I check for salt content and decide whether soaking is required. To proceed I take two lengths of Heavy-Duty foil and lay them crosswise on the counter. Then I place the Ham in the centre and loosley cover it, making sure that is completely enclosed. I place the whole bundle on a rack in a deep roasting pan and cook at 325F for 20 minutes per pound. Thirty minutes before it is done I lift the whole package and carefully remove the ham, carefully pouring the juices into a bowl. I then remove all the skin and make criss-cross cuts across the ham and increase the oven temperature to 425F. I then spread a mixture of dry mustard and honey and stud all over with whole cloves. I then return the ham (without the foil) to the rack in the roast pan and finish baking. The Ham should rest for at least thirty minutes before carving. The juices in the bowl will seperate into bacon fat, which can be used later for potato-boulagnes and the jelly for lentil or ham-bone soup. I serve with a Cumberland sauce.

I'd been looking for a glaze that was not-icky-sweet, didn't include cloves and didn't have require a ton of ingredients or alot of preparation. This recipe was just perfect. Because I had never found the 'right' glaze, I usually didn't use any ... which was pretty boring. This will now be my 'go-to' glaze for ham. It had just right amount of sweet and a little tang from the mustard. I was worried that the maple would be overpowering, but it wasn't. Everything blended very well ... and no one flavor was overpowering. It was wonderful! I highly recommend this.

Really good!  I added some ground cloves to the glaze and pineapple to the ham via toothpicks!  It was amazing!  The glaze caramelized amazingly!  Definately a keeper.

I saw this recipe and thought GREAT no cloves! I mixed it all together and thought it tasted great, but then I wanted to add my own flair. I did as many others here did I used Spicy Mustard in place of the yellow mustard. I also added 2 tsp garlic powder, and about Â¼ cup of horseradish. It was a hit, everyone loved it. I used a 10 pound ham spread it all around baked it tented with tin foil. The last 30 minutes I took off the tinfoil and it got a nice crust. The only down side was the color of the mixture was pea soup green. Today I am using the left over ham to make potato soup.

I needed a last-minute glaze recipe and this was fantastic! Three ingredients, so easy and simple to adjust to your taste. Make it tangy or sweeter by adjusting the ingredients. I brushed it on the freshly cooked ham and broiled it on low for just a few minutes until it was bubbly and sticky. Delicious! Thank you for sharing!

The first time that I cooked ham, I used this recipe.  The taste was amazing, and several people told me that they would use this for their Christmas ham.  The only change that I would make is to glaze it a half hour before the cook time ends, as the cooking directions on the package suggested.  I think this would have worked better for the texture of the ham.  Overall, I will be using this recipe in the future!  
EDIT:  I made a gravy by mixing the juices and bits in the pan with a little flour over the stove.  Fantastic!

Mix dark brown sugar and common yellow mustard into a thick paste.  Spread over the ham, insert cloves and bake uncovered until done.

If you don't like mustard, don't make this recipe or decrease the amount used in the recipe.  Mustard is too strong for us in this recipe.

It's simple and tasty, but not AMAZING. If you're in a pinch for time and ingredients, it'll certainly make any ham tasty and is worthy to serve to guest. I will use it again, no doubt.

We used spicy mustard and a mix of pure maple syrup and honey, because that's what we had on hand, and there was plenty to glaze an 8-lb. ham.  And WOW - my boyfriend liked it so much, he licked it off the spatula post ham-painting, before it was even cooked!  We'll definitely be using this one as our glaze from now on.

Excellent!  Recipe as written makes enough sauce for a 10 pound ham.  Would bake at 350 though as I had to boost the temp during the last hour and fifteen minutes to get internal temp to 140.  Will definitely be making this again!

I use a recipe like this but use grape jelly instead of syrup and wrap tight in aluminum foil.After 2hrs.I drain then every hr after squeeze out juice.This makes hame very tender almost like a roast very good.

O.M.G. this recipe was wonderful! I used a smoked (uncooked) picnic ham.  It was about a 6 lb ham and i cut and lifted the fat layer on top and stuck cloves in and lay the fat flap back down (sounds gross i know but i like to bake these hams with that fat on top) i stuck cloves in all over because i just cant imagine making a ham without cloves! Also I used honey instead of syrup...it was really REALLY good we ate it for days.  Buying another ham today to have handy so I can make this again soon!

This is really good. I made this using a ham from a pig that I shot. This is a really good recipe for the really natural and raw meat. I cooked it in the crock pot on low for 7 hours and then made another batch of sauce to smother over the ham and bake it in the oven for another hour at 200 degrees. Worked great!

I did not care for this one bit.  I felt it ruined a perfectly good ham, and I even love mustard.

My whole family enjoyed this.  Although, the sauce that I poured over the ham, burned to the bottom of the pan in the oven and ruined my dish.

Made this for Easter. I used a little less mustard than called for and it turned out great. My family loved the taste..

I was really very skeptical that this was all that good when I saw the ingredients but I was intrigued and gave it a try. It tasted great! It was so easy to make, too. I'd definitely recommend it and will make it again. I cross cut my ham all over and actually basted the ham several times while it cooked.

Good. We didn't have any maple syrup so i just used more brown sugar. I also added 2 Tbsp Horseradish. We liked the flavor. Only trouble was the outside got very brown and hard. We needed to remove the outer skin to get into the great meat. Next time i will cover with a foil tent for half the cooking time. Thanks.

I've been doing something similar for years, however I use a 50/50 mixture of regular and dijon mustard and fresh maple syrup. I also stick whole cloves throughout the ham. I don't add brown sugar or onion powder.

I seriously had my doubts with this recipe but needed something different to try. Plus it saved my from having to go to the store. I left it uncovered for 1/2 hour but didn't like the look of how it was cooking so I covered it with foil for the remaining time - moist. My 9 yr.old went for seconds- this is a keeper

This was very good!  Probably one of the best Roasted Ham recipes I've every made!  The only problem was that my roasting pan was impossible to clean after because of the carmalization.

A blustery weekend in Wisconsin, good for roasting a ham on the grill. This ham was GREAT! I used honey (local)instead of maple syrup. As others suggested, added some horserdish, 1 tbsp, a well. Roasted on barbi to 160F, 3 hrs (9 lb. ham)

This ham turned out very well, considering it was my first time baking a ham!!!  I thought the mustard was a little strong, but mixed with the maple syrup it help counteract the bitter with the sweet.  Definitely will try it again.

This was real-l-l-ly tasty !  I did decrease the mustard to 1/4 cup and only used 1 teaspoon of onion powder.....just out of personal preference  .  This one's a keeper for sure.

This was my first time making a ham and this recipe couldn't have made it any easier. All the ingredients were already on hand.  I don't particularly care for ham but my husband has been raving about it.  This one is a keeper.

This was a nice tasting ham, but the sauce is only on the outside of the ham so it isn't a strong flavor, but when you do get a taste it is nice.

My first time making a ham. When others made it, I usually end up putting syrup on my individual pieces. With this recipe it's so not necessary. 
I used Molasses instead of Maple syrup and garlic powder instead of onion (The garlic was a mistake that turned out great).
It turned out delicious. 
I had a 10 lb ham. I didn't have to increase the other ingredients. It was more than enough but I did cook it for 3 hours.
I will definitely use the recipe again.

This was good. Two out of three kids ate it, so not bad. I didn't have maple syrup, so I subbed honey in it's place, also I split the mustard half regular / half dijon.

This was really easy and tasty.  I was a little usure of how all these flavours would jive but trusted all the positive reviews.  Glad I did, this was great.  I didn't put all the glaze on once, but basted the ham every 1/2 hour or so.  Delicious!

Add cloves, and pineapple rings, substitute spicy brown mustard, and dried onion flakes, and it is perfect!

This was out of this world! My husband, 15 year old daughter, mother and I couldn't get enough and we all agreed it was the best ham we have ever had! In addition to the yellow prepared mustard I used dijon mustard. YUMMY!

If you ask for a fresh ham at the grocery store, the butcher will give you a Picnic Ham.  That is the wrong end of the pig for the holidays.  It is very fatty and not used for holiday gatherings, that I know of.  Fresh hams need to be smoked low and slow, till about 205 degrees internal, shredded and then pour on the BBQ sauce.

I made many changes using mango pulp" pineapple. Chili flakes" lots of minced fresh garlic and soy sauce. Served with Cuban style rice and pinto beans, mashed sweet potatoes, steamed collards. I made a big green salad and finished with a vegan apple crisp. Yum.

I tried this for the first time last year and everyone loved it. Even people who don't like mustard thought it was delish! I didn't change a thing. Although if I have real maple syrup next time that may change the taste to even better!

Made this ham for Easter.  Fantastic.  The glaze is amazing.  I divided the mustard into half yellow and half Dijon.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

We loved this recipe. I used Dijon mustard, rather than yellow. Other than that, I kept it the same. It added a nice flavor to the ham without being overly sweet. I'll definitely make this again.

I used a three pound ham but kept the glaze proportions so I had some leftover glaze. I also substituted sugar-free syrup and brown mustard (yellow mustard -bleack!), but it still came out very tasty. It made a nice Sunday brunch with some instant potatoes and steamed Asian veggies, and a few days of ham sandwiches for lunches. This went into my recipe box and will be used often!

Used pre-cooked ham to make 2 of these for a party. It didn't make it through the night. Mustard and ham just go together and the maple adds a nice sweetness.

Made this for Easter 2015 - cooked in the slow cooker while we were at church! Excellent! I used less mustard than recommended ... great comments! - Herb turned the ham :)
