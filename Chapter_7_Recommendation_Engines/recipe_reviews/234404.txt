For a really easy fast dinner this is a keeper.  The kids loved it.  Yes, it is a bit spicy, a little sour cream or cheese would tame that.  I used Zatarain's Spanish Rice Mix, 2 really large chicken breasts cut into thirds, to make 6 pieces. 
Very tasty for an easy meal.  Add a green salad or a vegetable side dish and you got dinner.

I like spicy food but this was a little too much.  Next time will use diced tomatoes without the chilies.  Followed others suggestion to use chicken broth in place of water for a richer flavor .  I also added onion, celery and bell pepper.

This is an excellent combination of flavors.  It is a bit spicy--we consider it to be about a 5 on a scale of 0-10.  My only change was to use chicken stock instead of water.  This would easily stretch to 8 blsl thighs, and I'm tempted to add some sliced zucchini about half way into the simmer time, when I make this again.   Leftovers would be an excellent lunch, if we had any!  Thanks for the recommendation, Baking Nana!

We also used chicken broth instead of water, and because of availability had 2 thighs and 2 drumsticks. The rest of the recipe was followed and it was really, really good. 
There are only 2 of us so we had enough fora second go-around was almost better than the first. Easy, fun  meal and we'll have it again soon. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very easy to make . I had to substitute things because I didn't have the exact ingredients but it turned out very yummy!  I didn't have Spanish rice but I had red beans and rice (Zatarains), I had Rotel but the chili fixing variety and I used broth instead of water like other reviewers had. That being said, this is a simple recipe that tastes amazing!!

I followed the recipe exactly,except that after cooking the chicken, I sautéed some Italian sausage,celery, onion, and bell pepper in the pan before adding the tomatoes, etc. Ittook closer to an hour for the rice in mine to get soft, but it was worth the wait! I served with sour cream for anyone who wanted to cut the heat level. It got rave reviews!

I ended up making my own creole seasoning and using more than just a pinch. Also, I made it with chicken breasts instead of thighs, but other than that, I stayed true to the recipe. I think it was alright, tasted (to me), like a typical spicy chicken recipe. If you are looking for something hot, this will probably take care of that need. I might make it again.
