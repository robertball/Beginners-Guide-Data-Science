I made this recipie exactly as the poster instructed. (BTW I have had professional culinary training both on the job and in schooling.) This had to be the second to worst dish I have ever made. (which is rare.) I made this one evening for dinner. My husband and I choked it down(Out of starvation!) then tossed the leftoversout! I would not consider this to be a recipe that you would even want to feed to your dog cat or even an enemy!

I made this for my kids and we loved it. The only thing I will do different next time is put a little less sugar. I may even substitute hamburger meat for the ham next time just to mix it up. Overall it was a hit at my house

I made this last night. The only change I made was to use bacon instead of ham. I'm sorry. The taste was overpowering and not good at all. Neither my husband nor I could even eat it.

I actually have to agree with one reviewer who noted that they attended culinary school this recipe as is is very bland. Compared to ramen noodles maybe not? Anyway you do have the possibility of creating a decent meal with lots of adjustments especially with the sauce. If you are going to make this taste it before serving it.
