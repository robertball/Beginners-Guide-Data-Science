This is the first review that I have written and unfortunately it has to be a negative one. I should have read the other reviews. Of course this was moist, it was the greasiest thing I have ever made and by just touching the bread, it stuck to my hands.  This recipe includes way too much fat to be necessary...the butter is overboard and fat free cheese is okay...I also added corn niblets.  I made this for the Fourth of July but ended up having to make another batch from BETTER HOMES & GARDENS COOKBOOK (excellent moist and firm recipe by the way!) the morning of the BBQ. this was a huge, disappointment.  Especially since this is my first problem with a recipe on this site.

We couldn't get enough of this cornbread.  I just took it out of the oven 15 minutes ago and it is half gone!  I cut down the butter to only 6 tablespoons and the sugar to 1/3 cup. I also added extra jalepenos and cheese and a dash of cayenne pepper.  It turned out perfect - moist but not greasy and very flavorful.

I followed this recipe to the "T" and it had WAY too much butter in it! it should of had at least half of what it called for. hubby said it was good but way too greasy and refused to eat the rest of that BIG pan so it got thrown away, so be careful about the butter it was way too greasy

This bread was fantastic.  I read all the other reviews and decided to cut the butter in half.  Also, instead of 1 cup of sugar, I added only 3/4 cups and it came out wonderfully.  I served it with other Mexican food and this was a hit to all of my guests.  It was even better then next day after all the flavors melded.  This one can be made ahead.  I am keeping it and passing it on.  I had several people ask me for the recipe.

Oh my!!!  Way too much butter....  A 1/2 cup of butter was sufficient and the bread was still moist.  Added diced red peppers, 1/2 tsp onion powder and corn OFF the cob that had been grilled.  To give the bread more complexity and a little more zip, use Pepperjack cheese in place of the Monterey Jack.

My husband loved this cornbread.  I didn't have any cornmeal so I just used 2 boxes of Jiffy corn bread mix.  I made the cornbread up like on the box and added the cheeses and chiles. Turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best! I substituted the last four ingredients for Jiffy  Brand cornbread mix and added a pinch of onion and garlic powders. Easy and VERY delicious.

Very moist and delicious !!! I added chopped hot pickled peppers, a little more cheese and 1/4 cup green onions.  I cut the butter by half and used only about 3/4 of the sugar.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

After reading all other reviews I decided it would be best to cut back on the amount of butter to 1/2 cup. I also adjusted the sugar to 3/4 cup, added fresh, sweet corn along with the can cream-style corn. Instead of green chile peppers I added some fresh diced red, green, and orange bell peppers for added color. I also threw in a generous handful of mexican blend cheese. It did not take long to prep and mix all of the ingredients together. I poured the batter into the greased 9x13 pan and it was done in one hour. The cornbread looked so pretty with all the colorful array of bell peppers peeking out from the top, sides and underneath the bread(see my picture).  The corn niblets, which was also visible, was sweet and added a nice tender crunch factor. The bread was a nice yellow color with golden crispy edges. As soon as I took my first bite, I noticed that it was indeed moist and sweet- full of good flavor. The cornbread was not greasy and oily to the touch. I am so glad that I cut down on the amount of butter otherwise I probably would have ended up with a mouthful of butter. I am sure if you added pepper jack cheese it would have given this a nice boost of flavor and kick. I am so happy this cornbread turned out buttery sweet, moist and delicious. This paired perfectly with the, "Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup," also from AR.

This cornbread was good albeit a bit too sweet.  I served it with "Beezie's Black Bean Soup" and it would've tasted better if it was more savoury rather than sweet.  But all in all, it was very enjoyable.

I enjoyed this and  am not a big fan of cornbread . My husband loved it. I will make it again. The recipe said it serves 6 I think 12 is more like it. It was on the sweet side.

Really good with using the other reviewers suggestions - less butter, less sugar.  Made a half-recipe for dinner last night and it didn't last!  I found that cooking the half-recipe in 8x8 pan took only about 35 minutes on 300 degrees (convection).

I have made this twice- once with all the butter and sugar and once with half and I found it just changes the texture but both are very good and everyone loved! Most recently I halved the butter and sugar and baked at 325 instead of 300 for one hour and the testure was much more like a traditional corn bread and not as cakey.

Good cornbread. I altered the recipe some. I used half the butter and sugar as some had suggested. I used self-rising flour and omitted the baking powder. I also used jalapeno peppers instead of the chile peppers. Baked in glass dish for 1 hour. Will make again and maybe add just a little extra cheese and peppers.

Any recipe that will make my 4 year old go "Mmmmmmm" is a winner with me! *LOL*  I only wanted to make half a recipe which turned out great though I must say though that I totally changed up this recipe.  A few changes on purpose -- added 1 cup of cheddar instead of 1/2 Monterey Jack and no chiles and a few changes on accident -- forgot to halve the 4 eggs, 1 c. cheese, 4 tsp. b. powder and 1/4 salt.  BUT IT STILL TURNED OUT PERFECT!!!!!   Also, when halving the recipe, it only needed to bake about 50 minutes.  Next time I'll make the recipe the "right" way (with a little less butter maybe) but I'll keep my alternate recipe on hand as well.  I rate this recipe 5 stars because of the way my family gobbled it up, because of how easy and flexible the recipe turned out to be.

LOVED this recipe. Got frowns from family when I said I was making cornbread but everybody loved it. I did use only 1/2 the butter, sugar and only 2 eggs, used the whole can of chili peppers. No jack cheese, all hoop cheddar. Made it in a 8x8 stoneware pan. Totally out of this world!! I don't expect cornbread to hold up like a slice of normal bread, cornbread crumbles a bit. I will make this every time I make chili and probably more often than that.  WHAT A TREAT !!!

This is the best cornbread I have ever tasted! I only used 3/4 cup butter, which was plenty. I also replaced the chiles with chopped pickled jalepenos. It was like eating spicy cake with supper!

This is one of those recipes you want to do over and over.  If you remove or reduce the peppers, while it will not be as spicy, everyone will totally love it.  Excellent recipe!!

Sorry, even with only using half the butter the cornbread was WAY too greasy...
fingers came away coated with grease just removing one muffin from the pan.
Texture was okay....used half the sugar and it was still a bit sweet for my taste.

This is the very best cornbread I've ever made!  I, too, cut back on the butter and sugar the second time I made it and it was just as good as the original recipe.  I did add more chili peppers and some regular frozen corn along with the creamed corn.  My family likes the moistness and softness of it so much better than the dry, crumbly cornbread we've always eaten.  Thanks!

NOTE!! * RATING BASED ON RECIPE USING HALF THE AMOUNTS OF BUTTER AND SUGAR!!*** If you cut the butter and sugar by half.. this recipe is a winner. It is moist and delish.. I'm making it for the second time. It was a winner the first time out for me because some nice folks reviewed it and said they cut the butter and sugar by half and I read that BEFORE I tried it and adjusted accordingly... it yields a delectable, moist bread that goes quickly especially when you serve it with chili! :)

Well, I made chili last night and needed a cornbread recipe.  My family hates my cornbread. (recipe off the back of the box)  I tried this recipe and as large as it is there are no leftovers this morning.  There are only three of us in the house.  Need I say more?  I didn't have a cup of butter only about 3/4 cup and it still turned out great.  Don't think I would substitute the butter for margarine. And I did add the entire can of green chilis just because my husband likes them so much.  Wonderful recipe.

A very nice cornbread. I used a can of jalapeno peppers instead of green chilis and the heat was perfect. A nice addition to the basic sweetness of the cornbread. It was devoured almost immediately.

Fantastic...I cut the butter back to 1/2 C. and only added 1/2 C. sugar.  Added the full amount of green chilies.  I used a full cup of Pepperjack.  This was wonderful and got great reviews tonight from our friends.  Served with Chicken Enchilada Verde, Mexican Bean Salad.  Fantasitc meal.....

Both my husband and I loved this cornbread.  I would give it more than five stars, but changed some things as others suggested.  Half the butter, Half the sugar.  I added red pepper flakes and chopped jalapenos.  It makes a lot, but freezes beautifully.  Try it - I guarantee you will love it.  Will be added to my favorite recipes.  Love it.

Especially good Mexican Cornbread IF you cut the butter amount in half.  If made according to directions the sugar can be reduced by half as well or it's extremely sweet.  My changes were...half the butter, eliminate sugar altogether and used a little less than 1/2 cup Splenda.  Sometimes I use Jiffy corn bread mix (only 1 box per recipe) and sometimes I follow the recipe for the cornbread part.  Didn't think I'd like it but David thinks it's "da bomb" and I DO  really like it myself.

I had to make a couple of alterations. I used fresh chopped and seeded jalapenos instad of the canned green chiles because I was out of them. I also cut way back on the sugar because of the sweetness of the corn, and also cust the butter in half because of preference. I used fine shredded mexican blend cheese because that's what I had on hand. We absolutely love this cornbread. Hmm, I think I'll make some more tonight!!

OMG, This is awesome! I only used half the sugar and it turned out absolutely perfect! I substituted finely chopped jalepenos for the chiles and also added 2 finely chopped (seeded & well-drained)roma tomatoes. When I removed it from the oven, I drizzled melted butter over the top and by the time we ate it (about 20 minutes later) it was beyond divine! I prepared this as a side for live, whole lobsters and as full as we were getting, we still wanted to eat more of this fantastic bread! THANK-YOU, JUDY!

I agree moist but lots of work. I have a similiar recipe that requires 1/2 the butter, no flour, no baking powder & it's great. No need in some of these ingredients. Use jiffy cb mix instead of flour & baking powder. Crumble bacon in mix as well & its awesome!

I can't say that we liked this recipe.  It wasn't very much like a cornbread, and had a much more cake like texture.  Also, it was greasy.  I think it definetly would benefit from less butter and more chiles etc.  Also, something else spicy (like Cayenne or tobasco) would improve the flavour.  I don't think I'll make this recipe again.

This recipe is PHENOMENAL.  It's been our staple cornbread recipe for almost 2 years now and it has never failed us.  For those of you who want to cut the fat, try using half the butter - but be sure to lightly grease your pan just to be safe!  It does make the cornbread a little less moist to do this, but at least the guilt factor is lessened when 2 people finish the whole pan in less than 24 hours (it's that good).  This is definitely a dangerously tasty recipe!!  Thanks Judy for giving it to us!

I found that 3 tablespoons of sugar, 1/4 cup of butter, and 2 eggs were sufficient for this recipe.  I also added 2 - 4 oz. cans of green chili peppers and cut the cheese into little cubes because shredded cheese seems to give the cornbread a 'thick' consistency.  I baked it at 325 degrees for 45 minutes (gas oven).  Very good.

I can only echo the cook's words, "don't let the ingrediants fool you!" Yes, we were hesitant to try based on some of the ingrediants, but, boy, what a delicious result! Best cornbread we have ever had!

Enjoyed the recipe!  I've made it twice already and each time it was fabulous.  For me, I didn't have a problem with the amount of butter so I'll stick to what the recipe states.  Second time, I forgot to restock my pantry with cream of corn, so had to improvise with: one can of sweet corn, 1/4 cup milk and a 1/8 sugar.  If I do run into that problem again, I'll just omit the extra sugar as it was too sweet that time.

Great recipe. A few things I changed was using only 1/2 the butter, very important. Next time I'll only use 1/3. I used 1 1/2 cup of just cheddar cheese and instead of cream corn 1/4 cup of buttermilk and a can of corn. I only used 2/3 cup of sugar as well. This was amazing and makes plenty enough for leftovers. Nomnomnom!

This is simply a wonderful recipe! This has become one of my staple dishes to take to family functions and pot luck dinners. I made it the first time for a fiesta themed dinner party. After reading other reviewer's suggestions, I half the butter quantity. One stick of butter is plenty for this recipe. I also omit the peppers, because of my personal preferences. I occasionally use the taco seasoned cheese, or the Monterrey Jack combo that is available in the grocery store.

Great base recipe. Great with a few splashes of chili sauce. I made the following changes: 1/2 C. butter, 3/4 C. sugar, 1 (4 oz) can of chopped chiles, 1 C. frozen corn (in addition to the creamed corn), 1/8 tsp cayenne, 1.5 C. cheese, 1 tsp of onion powder.
Next time I will make it spicier and use some fresh chiles as well as cilantro.

Best cornbread I've ever made!  Served it with Blackeye Pea Gumbo (recipe from this site) and collard greens for New Years ~ was a huge hit!  The only change I made was to cut the sugar in half, and was glad I did.

Hi there. Made this to serve alongside Albondigas (Belen). I'm not really sure what all the rave is about (?). This is NOTHING at all like true Mexican cornbread. This is basically plain 'ol moist / sweet cornbread with a few "extras" (and I even livened mine up by using a mix of cheddar-pepperjack cheese). I like my stand-by recipe MUCH better (by far). If I want basic cornbread, I'll stick with golden sweet cornbread (bluegirl) - it's the best I've made so far. If I want cornbread with a kick, I'll stick with my go-to Mexican cornbread recipe. It's spicier, uses WAAAY less butter (and is just as moist) and cheaper to prepare. My last gripe??? This took more than an hour to cook thru.... Parts of my cornbread tested underdone at the hour mark, but another 10 minutes seemed to do the trick. My only positive comment is that this is SUPER moist and not at all greasy (surprise!), despite the two sticks of butter called for. On the flipside, I'm not sure all that butter is necessary.... Thanks anyways, Judy.

I love that allrecipes has review and everyone makes recommendations.  I cut the butter and sugar in half like others had suggested.  I also used self-rising flour and cornmeal, so I left out the baking powder and salt.  The cornbread turned out great.  Wonderful flavor with just the right extra flavor from the chilies.  I would make this again for sure.  Very moist and tasty!

I have been looking for a good cornbread recipe for a long time, and this one is the best!  I cut the sugar and butter by half, and I think I could cut the sugar even more.  Moist and wonderful!

Everyone loves this cornbread. I usually get a few marriage proposals each time I make this for a potluck or bbq. I'm making it today for someone's birthday party who has requested this cornbread instead of a cake, haha. I have made it before with half the butter and splenda and it also turned out great.

This is by far the best cornbread i ever tasted.  It was a big hit in our family, even my 6 and 7 year old grandchildren liked it.  Easy to prepare and so moist, it is even wonderful cold.

This is a five-star recipe for sure. I made it as directed and it was marvelous, but I was raised in South Texas and I'm used to unsweetened Mexican cornbread. I think next time I will at least halve the sugar, as some other reviewers have recommended. I also agree with them that probably only half the butter is necessary. A bit greasy as is, but I will admit I ate every bite! : )

This is, absolutely, the best cornbread I have ever tasted. I made it again yesterday, without the cheese, (because I didn't have any on hand) and it still turned out wonderful. Thank you for the recipe. I also use the whole 4 oz can of chiles. Perfect.

Best cornbread ever!  I read previous reviews and also only used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup butter.  Maybe add a little more corn next time!  Thank you thank you thank you!

After reading the other reviews, I also made some changes to this recipe. I cut the butter to 1/2 cup, the sugar was decreased to 1/2 cup, I used about 3/4 cup of jarred jalapenos, and a dash ( or 2) of cayenne pepper. I also cooked it in a 10 inch iron skillet ( hey, I'm from the South, ya'll!) for about 35 minutes at 350 degrees. Turned out great, awesome, excellent! I would have given it 5 stars, but the original recipe had too much butter and sugar for my taste. Will definitely add this to my recipe box with my changes, and I will surely make this one again!

This was my first attempt at real cornbread (why try when you can buy a box of corn muffin mix for 33 cents!)and it was so fabulously delicious that I can't even believe it!  I cut the recipe in half for our group of 4, and also cut the butter and sugar in half again, as per other reviews.  I also used my beloved boxed Jiffy mix in place of the corn meal.  It was perfectly soft, sweet and spicy and the entire pan got eaten in one sitting!  I'll never go back the plain boxed mix!

Wow this was the best cornbread.  I cut the butter by 1/4 cup and and added a bit more cheddar.  I also used some salsa instead of the canned chilies.  It was so moist and fantastic.  I couldn't stay away from it.  I will definately be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We LOVE this recipe. Use about 1/2 cup extra cheese and 3/4 the amount of butter. We also add a bit of cayenne. This is a moist cornbread, almost like a cross between cornbread and sweet Mexican corn cake. This is the second time I've made this recioe, and it definitely won't be the last! A welcomed addition to my permanant file. Thanks!

I've made this a couple of times and it is a big hit!  I did make a couple of changes:  I add the entire 4oz of green chilies.  It also does not need to bake that long.  I bake it at 325 deg. for about 30-35 min!  it's perfect!!

I cut the sugar in half as suggested by others for my first try.  Also the butter. Note:  I am a sweet tooth and butter fanatic, but I took the other comments to heart and cut back anyhow. The result was fantastic corn bread that made the corn bread haters in my family weep and cry for more!  It is a home run as far as I am concerned.  I'll continue to make it with the same adjustments, I don't think it needs to be sweeter and it was very moist even with 1/2 cup less butter.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, it made my Senate Navy Bean soup an outstanding meal!

This corn bread is (as my Mother would say) "to-die-for" good.
It is so moist and delicious.  I did cut the sugar in half like most of the reviewers did.  I also used the full can of green chile's.
My daughter gobbled it up.  I had to stop myself at 2 pieces - I can't wait to have some leftovers tonight!!
10/15/06 - I just won 1st prize in our neighborhood chili/cornbread cookoff!!!
This cornbread (cake?) is so awesome.  I also used pepper-jack cheese and that added a nice kick.

I just made this recipe, before reading the reviews.  It came out perfect. Thank you! There is a trick to corn bread, light mixing. The emulsification was perfect, not greasy at all and I used real butter! Sorry to y'all who had a bad experience with this recipe. The El Torito Bartender said it taste like there corn cakes recipe, I agree!

We loved this cornbread, but agree with some reviewers who say it goes a bit overboard on the butter.  Next time we'll cut back somewhat (and could probably go with less sugar as well).  We didn't have canned chiles, so chopped up a few large jalapenos and sauted them in a little olive oil for a few minutes.  This really added some zing, and we'd definitely do the same thing when making this recipe again!

I made this according to the recipe except for 1 thing: I used a can of sweet kernel corn instead of cream style. It did come out very greasy so I will back off the butter next time and I will add some cayenne for more kick. It's very yummy and moist - just the way I like cornbread!

I thought this was great. I appreciated the moistness of the cornbread. There is nothing worse than super dry cornbread that you choke on. This was def. not a healthy recipe but DUH you are eating CORNBREAD. As a once in awhile thing, it's just fine.

This is a very rich cornbread.  If you are accustomed to putting butter on your cornbread, you won't want to with this one.  This was a big hit with dinner guests. My husband, who was raised in the South, says this isn't like "real" cornbread and maybe it's not, but I think most people will love it anyhow.

very good but I cut back the butter to 1/2 c and next time would cut the sugar in half too. Pepper jack cheese is a good idea.

This cornbread is absolutely delicious!  I love a sweet cornbread, so I didn't change the amount of sugar or butter.  It is so moist and tasty, and such a hit with the chili I served it with!

Make it, you won't be disappointed!

I just made this for the first time last night.  My aunt makes a similar recipe, and I was trying to mimic that.  This, however, is even better!  The only modification I made was to replace the chiles with Rotel.  Everyone loved it!  :)

cut the butter and sugar in half, and used 2 boxes of jiffy for the last 4 ingredients. i didn't have any peppers or green chiles on hand and i am sure that would have helped the flavor immensely. i might try to increase the butter to 3/4 cup next time for a bit of a creamier texture as mine turned out a tad dry, and cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup as it was still too sweet. however, the bf hates cornbread and loved this one, so i wouldn't write it off the way it turned out.

Excellent recipe--made exactly as written the first time. Has a nice little kick and the husband likes sweet cornbread anyway-its a happy medium. However, we like it a little more spicey so I chopped 2 jalapenos-seeds removed and added for the last two times made--oh and leave the mixture sitting in the mixing bowl for about 10 to 15 minutes (if you have the time) before you pour into dish to cook--it won't be as greasy!

This is my new favorite cornbread! I didn't have the recommended cheese on hand, only sharp cheddar so that's all that I used. The only thing was the next day, it seemed sweeter to me then the night before....almost too sweet for my taste so next time I will cute back to 3/4 cup and see how that works. This is really an awesome cornbread recipe and even my picky son, LOVED it!:))

I cut down the butter to half a cup, and added less Cheddar and 1/2 cup Monterey jack. I added chopped jalapenos too. It came out great and I served it with Chicken Enchilada soup.

Loved it! However I did alter the recipe, I put 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup butter and a whole can of green chilies with the juice. Came out moist but not greasy! Wonderful!

Very good cornbread,  although I did make changes per other reviews. After reading the recipe, I thought the cup of butter and sugar was too much. I was looking for a more savory bread to serve with chili. I read many reviews and decided to use 1/2 cup of butter, and 1/2 cup of sugar. I used 8 ounces of Pepper Jack cheese shredded, and omitted the green chilis. I topped the bread with jalapeno pepper slices before baking. Everyone really enjoyed this. I will make this again with these changes. As written, I think this recipe would be too greasy and sweet for me. Thanks for sharing :)

I have made this twice. The first time I folowed exactly, except omitted the green chile's. It was greasy,a little crumbly and a little sweet. The taste was still out of this world and we didnt have enough! So the second time I made it I doubled the recipe, and I followed other reviews and cut the butter and sugar by half and added an extra egg for better hold together and cut the baking powder by 1 tsp so it wouldnt rise as much. I think it was perfect. I will probably never use another recipe. Ever. It's called mexican but without the chile I call it southern.

This was wonderful. I wish I wouldn't have followed the advice and used less butter and sugar. Next time I will follow this recipe to a "T"
Thanks for the quick and easy homeade cornbread.

My boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe. I halved the recipe which still made a large 8x8 pan. I cooked it at 325 for 40 minutes. I also cut the butter and sugar in half again (only using half a stick of butter and 1/4 cup of sugar). Aside from cutting some fat, I also think this allowed it to be more like cornbread than the corncake that many reviewed it as. I highly recommend doing it this way. I paired this with the Chicken Tortilla Soup and it was one of our favorite meals I have ever made! YUM YUM! Will def make again and again.

This cornbread was very very tasty and rich. My family enjoyed it, but then again it might as well be served as a dessert and not a side dish because it has so much butter. If I make it again, I might try adding more cheese... Thanks!

As written, I don't know how it could taste like anything but cake.  I used 1/2 the butter and sugar and it was still too greasy and sweet.  I added all the green chilies, some mexican oregano and some chili powder and then it was just so-so.  I agree that there are better recipes out there or that this one need improved for my taste.  

If I were to make it again I would use 1/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter, the entire can of green chili and definately some jalepeno for heat.

This is delicious cornbread, moist and perfectly textured.  I have "tweaked" it for our family's tastes preferences by cutting sugar down to 1/4 cup, doubling the cheese, and adding the entire can of green chiles.  Perfect companion to a bowl of chili or King Ranch Chicken or Red Beans and Rice.  Thanks for sharing this one.  I also do not melt the butter, but just soften it and cream it together with the sugar before adding eggs.  This has become a regular at our house.

In my opinion, nothing in this recipe needs changed.  It is moist, sweet, and delicious.  Those thinking it is too sweet may not realize the difference between regular cornbread and Mexican corn cakes.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It was excellent served with the Southwest Stew from this website.

I made this recipe for a Company party "Christmas in July".  Everyone really enjoyed the cornbread and found it to be non-traditional.  I would cut back on the amount of butter used... maybe to 1/2 or 3/4 cup of butter, it was a little greasy.  Otherwise....GREAT

This was a really moist, delicious recipe, but very sweet.  I would definitely make it again, but with a soup or something not as rich as enchiladas (since they're so sweet!).

Very Good!  I looked at the other reviews and decided not to take away any of the ingredients like they suggested because I did not want to take away from the sweetness or the moistness.  After mixing all ingredients it looked too liquidy so I added 1/4 cup each cornmeal and flour.  Also if you want to kick it up a notch use the whole can of green peppers and use jalapeno jack cheese.  Mine turned out excellent and goes very good with chili.

I know people hate adjusted reviews but this was excellent (like my picky toddler ate 3 kind of excellent) after I made changes other reviewers made. Used ½ a cup of butter and ¾ a cup of sugar. Don't know about others but I hand mixed the batter with my trusty wooden spoon - I'm a snob about never using a mixer for cornbread. Next time I’ll add the whole can of peppers as I do love a green pepper and the flavor wasn’t really there for me when I only used half the can. 

Liberally sprayed my muffin pan with baking spray and put just over 1/8 of a cup in each tin. Baked at 325 for about 20 min but my stove is new and strong so the baking time may vary. 

In all I wound up with 24 wonderful little corn breads. We ate half with dinner and I put the other half in the freezer for another day. This is definitely going to be something I’ll make again.

I did not care for this recipe.  There is way too much sugar and not nearly the amount of peppers needed to make good mexican cornbread.  I once made some from scatch and did not use a recipe and it was much better than this bread.

Moist it is, mexicany it is not.

I've been making this cornbread for nearly a decade. I cut the butter down to 1/2 cup and instead of green chiles I use an entire can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles, pressed through a strainer to drain as much liquid as possible. It never fails to impress!

This cornbread was very tasty.  I followed previous reviews and only used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1 cup.  I thought it came out very nice, maybe add a couple more tablespoons of butter if you like it a little greasy.
I served this with a white chili recipe from this site, and the meal was a hit with the family.

I doubled this recipe for work,  reducing the amounts of butter & sugar called for by half. I used a fresh lg. minced Anaheim & red pepper & added minced black olives & 6 thinly sliced green onions. Instead of shredded cheese, I used 1 lb. of 1/8" - 1/4" cubes of Jack, Colby & Cheddar which were still visible when baked. 

So good fresh out of the oven with butter, and the leftovers are good split & toasted.

Everyone @ work liked it.

I just made my first pan of these cornmeal muffins,the only thing i did different was cut the butter back to 2/3 cup and the same for the sugar, my friend Libby said you should use the full butter that is called for in any cornmeal recipe.
These were great, my husband ate 4 peices while still warm, they were not greasy as alot of reviewers said, next time i will put the full cup of butter in, but i think 2/3 cup of sugar was sweet enough though, my husband can't eat anything too hot or spicy so instead of the chile peppers i put in a pinch of red pepper flakes. A great recipe, give it a try without cutting back on the butter too much!!

I made the corn bread for my co-workers, and boy did they enjoyed it!!  I followed the recipe, but I only used 1/2 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of sugar.  It turned out awesome!! I also put the batter into (large) paper muffin cups.  Baked for about 30 minutes!! A perfect size for a delicous bowl of chili.

Made these to go with chili.  Very good.  I will probably use diced jalapenos next time instead of green chilis as we would have liked a little more flavor.  As recommended, I only used one stick of butter and 3/4 c sugar and that was perfect.

I served several guests this as it makes a large pan full. They all loved it and have asked for the recipe. Personally I'd tone down the sugar. It was a bit sweet for our tastes, but that is relative I suppose. Excellent.

I have to say  I love this recipe.  I have made this numerous times over the past couple years.  The only thing I do different is substitute the green chilies for Ro-Tel Diced Tomatoes and Green Chilies.  Try this cornbread it is amazing!!

I made this yesterday to go with my company chili party.  It was absolutely excellent just the way it is.  I actually got 16 nice sized pieces out of it - serves way more than 6.  Don't change a thing!!  Yummo!

The best cornbread EVER! I have made this about 10 times now. The only change I sometimes make is to add a bit more cheese, but the recipe is perfect as is!

I've made this several times, and my husband says it's the best cornbread he's ever had.  That's saying something because I've tried a LOT of different cornbread recipes!  I do cut the butter to 3/4 cup, and the sugar could probably be cut to the same.

Wow...a real show stopper with my award winning 3-bean chili.  I served this all over the Pacific Coast & Arizona during our winter RV travels.  I learned right off to have both recipe copies available as rec'd so many requests.  I competed in both categories twice & won 1st Place both times with 25 other competitors.  I was even published in an Elks Club cookbook.Thanks for sharing!

I used Bob's Red Mill Stoneground cornmeal one time and found it was to grainy & baked dark.  I recommend using Bob's Red Mill regular cornmeal or any brand that is not stone ground for this recipe.

Made this for staff picnic, had lots of people comment on how moist and good it was.  Only difference was I added extra cheese and cooked it in a cookie sheet instead of a 9 x 13. Would make again

Second attempt w/cornbread and the boyfriend said I nailed it perfect!  First attempt was w/a different recipe (wasn't bad just not the right texture)  However, I did make the following changes and it came out the perfect crunch texture on the outside with a moist/light inside.   I decreased the butter and sugar to 1/2 cup each, did not add the chile peppers and used colby jack cheese and pepper jack.  I also increased the flour and cornmeal by a 1/2 cup.  Definitely be sure to mix the wet ingredients from the dry before folding together.   I then cooked in a skillet in the oven.  PERFECTION!

I've been using this recipe for years. My recipe card, which I copied from my mom's massive collection, credits a friend of one of my aunts. I make this recipe to serve as a side. It's also good toasted. It's rich like cake and doesn't need any added butter at the table. I've also adapted it for gluten free for my celiac daughter by substituting an equal amount of gluten-free flour blend (usually a mix of rice flour, tapioca, potato starch, bean flour, and corn starch) and adding 1/2 tsp. of xanthan gum. I've never made it with the chiles. I've also made it gluten free, cut into cubes and let it dry out for a few hours (or toasting it in the oven for 10-15 min @350) and made it into fabulous turkey stuffing by adding chopped, sauteed onion, celery, dried cranberries or cherries, chicken broth, and sauteed turkey sausage. Our non-GF friends rave about it. I'm perplexed by the reviews that say this is overly greasy. Mine has never turned out that way, but it is super moist and never gritty (not even the GF version!).

This is absolutely the best cornbread recipe I have ever made. Only made a couple of changes: I didn't have cream-style corn, so used whole kernel, drained, but added cream to make a 15-ounce portion. Also, I didn't have a can of chopped green chilies, so I chopped up some mild pepperoncini that I had in the fridge. Just the right amount of kick. I will serve this with some homemade chicken tortilla soup, topped with chopped fresh avocado. Almost too good to be true. Yes, my version is high fat; but for the once-a-year that I make cornbread, this is the recipe I will always use.

I have been using this recipe for several years now and Always get rave reviews! it is by far the Best Cornbread EVER!. Throught the years that I have been using this, I have made several "adjustments"..1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup, brown sugar instead of white, I also use 1 can of white sweet corn along with the cream corn. Finally, instead of the last 4 ingredients I use 2 boxes of Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix!

I love cornbread, but not when it's too cakey.  I make a recipe similar to this but with less butter and sugar and using regular corn, not creamed corn.  And lots more chiles, but if you're not used to spice you won't want to go overboard.

I seem to be in the minority on this recipe.  I didn't like it because it was too sweet.  I even cut the sugar in half and the butter to 3/4 cup.  I put in 4 oz of chiles and added a dollup of sour cream -but it was still way too sweet for my taste.  It came out beautifully and very moist - but if I make it again, I will leave out the sugar; the cream corn makes it sweet enough.  And, I will only use 1/2 cup of butter. Somehow I don't associate Mexican cornbread with that much sugar.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on the other reviews but honestly no one I made this for liked it. It's not that it wasn't moist and sweet because it was. None of the other bad things manifested in this cornbread either - it was just blah. I used a 7oz can of chilies because we really like chilies. It wasn't "cornbread-y" enough, more like a cake and that's not what I was looking for. My family said they preferred the old standby cornbread I usually make (and we're pretty adventurous food-wise). So the quest continues.

I halved the amount of butter and sugar, and it turned out perfect! Moist and delicious, could possibly cut down on the butter even more. Made it in muffin tins. I have gone through a lot of dry-tasting cornbread, but will keep this as my cornbread recipe from now on!

After reading all the "too sugary" reviews I followed Muffin's suggestion, tweaking it a little.  Like Muffin, I used half the sugar and butter, substituted sharp cheddar for the cheese and added another can of corn, drained.  I kept in the chilis though and found it burning at 350, so turned it down to 325.

It was the smash hit of the potluck!  Everyone loved it!  Very tasty and not too spicy or sweet.

This was awsome with some changes - I cut the butter/sugar in half and used bacon grease instead of butter, left out green chilis only b/c I didn't have them and wow. I will ONLY use this recipe from now on.  So moist and flavorful.  5 stars for sure.

I halved the recipe and followed the advice of the others by cutting the butter down to 6 tbsps and 1/3 cup sugar with a full can of chiles and a bit of chile powder; coupled it with "Deboozie's Blue Ribbon Chili" great mix!!

As others have suggested I cut the butter back to 6 TBS and the sugar to 1/3 cup. I also used jalepenos simply because its what I had, and used a colby/montery jack shredded cheese and only 2 tsp of baking powder. This way was fantastic, but as written I think it would have been way too sweet and way too greasy.

I don't think I have ever rated a recipe before but I just had to write in on this one.  WOW is all I can say.  I am a cornbread lover but don't make it too often but I sure will now!  This recipe was awesome!  The only thing I modified as per other reviewers was to cut the butter and sugar in half.  Did everything else as called for and it was just fabulous.  Thanks for such a great recipe!  :)

This is one of my favorite recipes...I have made it several times to serve with soups, chilis and Mexican dishes...everytime people ask me for the recipe.  I do think it's best served warm...and is easily made ahead and just warm in foil in a low oven...but I would not change a thing with this recipe!

I could eat the whole pan of this! Served with a spicy mexican soup, was the perfect side dish. I cut the butter to 1/2 cup, reduced the sugar to almost 3/4 cup, and the whole can of green chiles. This is my favorite corn bread of all time!

I rated this recipe 5 stars after reading the member reviews and following their suggestions. The next time I made it, I reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons and reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup.  I used 3 ounces each of finely chopped green and red bell peppers (the red peppers are sweet and add a little "fiesta" color).  I'm pokey, I guess; prep time for me was 25 min.  A tip for new cooks:  If you use self-rising corn meal OR self-rising flour, do not use baking powder.  Yumm Yumm!  The next time I make this will be to serve with a roast pork, and I think I'll omit the peppers altogether and use drained crushed pineapple.  I'll let you all know how that turns out!  Thank you, Judy Spence.

Really loved it.  Became a desert after dinner for a couple of knives.  Husband ate them like brownies...always seem to have one in his hand.

I followed the tips of other reviewers and 1) halved the butter, 2) used a touch more than half the sugar. I also used one large fresh jalapeno instead of canned chilis, one can of niblets instead of creamed corn, and 1 cup of a mexican cheese blend.  Mmmmmmm.....it compliments chili perfectly.

Very Good, although,I used 1/2 the butter and 1/2 the sugar.  I can't imagine what it would be like as written.

Yum! This cornbread is SO delicious! The first time I made it by the recipe, and it was really good. The second time I made it, I made it in muffin molds,  quadrupled the amount of green chilis, doubled the amount of cheese, substituted pepperjack cheese and chili-cheddar cheese for the regular cheese for a  HUGE kick of flavor! My fiance wants me to make this when we have people over, because this cornbread is one of his most favorite dishes that I've made. I've served it with chili as well as taco soup.

This is much more like sweet Mexican corn cake than it is cornbread. It was way  too sweet to go with my chili. I should have cut the butter and sugar as posted by previous reviewers. It was very delicious, it just didn't have a cornbread consistency.

Far too sweet for my family's taste buds. I might try it again with a 1/4 c of sugar because the texture was good but there are so many lovely cornbread recipes to try I probably won't bother!!

This cornbread is excellent!  I do not like sweet cornbread, but I decided to try it because my family does.  I found myself eating just as much as everyone else and our little chihuahua, Odie, who is the pickiest eater of the animal kingdom couldn't stay away from anyone that had a slice in their hands in hopes of crumb droppings.

This cornbread is very moist. I asked my husband what to give it because I am undecided if I like it or not. The flavor from the corn and the chilis was very nice, but it was too sweet for our taste. I even cut the sugar down some. I doubled the batch and instead of 2 cups of sugar I used 1 1/2 cups. maybe it wouldn't have been so sweet if I would have used a different brand of creamed corn? I am going to make this again, but with less sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband really enjoyed this recipe.  However, I did follow a few of the suggestions by other folks and added a few things myself.  I decreased the sugar to ½ cup, added 1-10 ounce can of well drained diced tomatoes with chiles, chopped onions, green bell peppers, and taco seasoned hamburger meat.    Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is absolutely the best corn bread I've ever had!  It was so nice to bite into a piece without it crumbling all over the place..very moist and delicious.  I tried it a second time with jalapenos instead of the chilies, but found we liked the chilies better..a definate keeper!!

This is the best cornbread I have ever had. It was so moist and flavorful. I did as other suggested and reduced the sugar to half a cup and I used margarine instead of butter and reduced that to 3/4 cup. I also used a full 4 oz. can of jalapenos instead of chiles. It turned out perfect.

This is amazing!  I follow the recommendations of others to decrease the butter and sugar by half and the eggs to 3.  In addition I add lots of fresh chile or jalepeno peppers, we like our food spicy!  I also use pepper jack cheese.  It's sooo good!

This cornbread was a hit at last night's Cinco de Mayo fiesta.  Not a piece left!
I read all the reviews, and made my changes accordingly.  It came out moist enough to be cornbread, with a lovely glazed country top. Yummy!
1/2 c butter
2/3 c sugar
3 eggs
whole can of chili peppers

If you're looking for spicy cornbread, this isn't going to do it.  Definitely use a larger can of chilis, or add minced jalepenos as people have mentioned.

I don't think I need to try another cornbread recipe after this one. It was the BEST. Didn't last long at all. I followed it religiously and didn't cut back on the butter or sugar but I may next time becuase of the guilt factor. Also so I can eat it more often without the extra fat and sugar.  It was sinfully delicious and goes great with the Chicken Tortilla Soup I here. You can look up my review for that one as well. Enjoy!!

When I took the first bite of this, I was disappointed.  I guess I was expecting something a little more spicy.   However, by the second or third bite I decided I could eat large amounts of this delicious cornbread.  I did cut the butter and sugar by half and thought it was still a little too sweet.  I will try the pepperjack cheese next time.  I served this with mexican chicken and chips with guacamole.

This is great cornbread! I cut the recipe in half for just me and my husband and I used fresh jalepeno instead of canned green chilies because I had it on hand. It was moist and flavorful. I served it with Black Bean Soup. Will definitely use again.

Actually this cornbread amazed me. While mixing the ingredients, I thought that it wouldnt turn out but after it was completely mixed it tasted EXTREME. I will definitely try this again. The mixture of creamed corn and chiles blends VERY well!!!

I made this recipe and I love it! I had to laugh cause when I made it, my son thought it was just another bean, potato,& cornbread meal and he is not a fan of cornbread. One slice of this and he is now asking me to make it every time I'm in the kitchen cooking. It's the best cornbread I've ever made...Thanks so much!

Good. I didn't have any yellow cornmeal mix so I skipped the flour and baking powder and just used self-rising cornmeal mix. Texture was fine with the substitution.

Outstanding! Thank you for sharing, Judy! The best (most addictive) cornbread recipe I've ever used. Family and friends loved it. It was a perfect complement to my venison chili. You'll love this cornbread even if you're not a fan of Mexican cuisine. One bite will bring on a good case of cornbread fever (i.e., it'll make your tongue want to slap your eyeballs out of your head - it's THAT good)! I followed the recipe as prescribed, but I couldn't resist adding 4 slices (chopped) of smoked bacon because that's just what I do with cornbread down here in Georgia. The original recipe is so perfect, the bacon did not hurt the taste of the final product.Thanks again, Judy.

I, too, agree that it had way to much butter. Ended up throwing it away. I am planning on remaking it before Sunday's Chili meal with half the butter and sugar. Will also add one whole can of chiles instead of 1/2. Hopefully this will make it edible. you could only eat this with a spoon, although it did taste good.

I'm going to rate this as a 3* because its a nice recipe but not perfect.  I love the fact it has chiles and cheese, but the overall effect is a little on the greasy side.  Just the right amount of cornmeal.  Nice taste, a shame its a little too greasy.

First time making it, & it was great! I took advice of other reviewers & only used 1/2 cup butter & 3/4 cup sugar, & my husband & I both thought it turned out great. I also think it would be great without the chilis, and/or with more cheddar. Taking to a Cinco de Mayo pitch-in at work!

I absolutely loved this recipe and so did my sisiter.  I halved the recipe.  The amount of butter did not make mine greasy at all.  I also used jalapenos instead and made it in a cast iron skillet as well.  It turned out wonderful.

Great recipe, thanks. I use vegetarian butter, brown sugar (and less than in the recipe) to make the bread healthier. I use pepper Jack as well per somebody's advice here, instead of other cheeses. It makes the bread just a bit spicy. Otherwise, great recipe

Loved it! I added jalapeño peppers, sweet & spicy...yum! Next time I will use half the butter in the recipe then melt the other half to top it off when it's fresh out of the oven.

This was some great tasting bread. The edges where perfectly crunchy-crispy and the center was moist and flavorful.  I did not include the peppers due to the company I was cooking for, but I think they would have made it that much better.  I paired it with a pulled pork and it certainly made the dish.  My only complaint is the amount of butter.  I followed the directions even though my gut said this was too much. Well... it was too much.  I'll try 3/4 cup next time and see if that helps with the greasiness.

This is a wonderful recipe but as many have said too much butter and for us too much sugar. I used half of both and the result was wonderful. Thanks this is a family favorite!

This cornbread was fabulous. My son does not like cornbread but he ate almost all of it up. I tweaked it a little. I chopped up a whole can of jalapeno peppers into the recipe and added a little more cheese. I took the suggestions of others and used a little less butter. Thank you for this delightful recipe Judy. I would give it 10 stars

This was so delicious!  I only used 3/4cup butter and 1/2cup sugar. I also added about 1/2tsp of cayenne pepper for a little extra kick!  I cooked it in an iron skillet at 425 for about 25 minutes.  Yes, it may be high in fat but I don't consider it a meal. Although I could, I'm not going to eat the entire pan.  Good for the occasional treat!  I will definitely makes this again and again.

Really good. First time baking it; the cornbread was too moist. Not sure why, but it was done. Still quite good, and we certainly scarfed it down. I'm thinking you could make this in a 9x9 pan for thicker bread; will try that next time.

Good tasty moist cornbread.  However, too sweet for a dinner bread, and way too much fat.  Cut these back to less than half the amount, and it's still scrumptious!  Thank you!

Moist, dense, sinfully good.  I leave out the chile peppers because I am not a fan of them.  We make this at least once a season.

This is a great recipe.  I like others just used 2 boxes of jiffy cornbread mix.  I wanted to make a whole meal out of it, so I browned 2 lbs. hamburger meat, drained, and added taco seasoning per package directions and added it to the mixture.  Baked right up into a wonderful easy dinner!  LOVE IT!  Also, avoid the chili's if adding the taco mix if you don't like spicy food.  The first time we made it we used both and the kids wouldn't touch it!

I made this bread to go with the King Ranch Chicken Casserole 1 recipe from this site.  I made it exactly as directed.  It was really good, and even my Dad who doesn't like cornbread as a rule said that he liked it! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe although the second time I made this I made a few changes to more suit my taste. I used only 1/4 c of sugar and along with the cheese already in the recipe, I added 6 slices of Pepper Jack cheese which I added after pouring in 1/2 the batter. Then I poured the remainder of batter on top of the cheese. Turned out great.

Made a few changes after reading the reviews.  I only made 1/2 a batch and then cut both the butter and sugar in 1/2.  It was the perfect sweet, spicy combination and so moist.  I think that the full amount of sugar would have made this almost like cake.  Went perfectly with our pork chili tonight.

I usually dont give ratings but I had to, this was not even a cornbread texture and was very thin, it was way too sweet and greasy.

Wow!  This is the best cornbread I have ever made.  My husband raved about it.  I followed the advice of past reviews and only did a 1/2 c. butter instead of a cup and only 3/4 c. sugar.  The cornbread was plenty sweet and I like my cornbread sweet.  I will make this over and over again!

Absolute Perfection!  Have made this MANY times and it's a huge hit.  I get asked for it over and over.  We love it with whipped honey butter  As others have suggested cut back on the butter and sugar in the batter.

It was buttery and sweet, so it is more of a Mexican corn pudding, than a corn bread.  I added sauted onions (1/2 medium, finely diced) and 2 Serrano peppers, diced, instead of the can of chile peppers. It was a hit.

I followed other reviewers' advice and only did 6 Tbs of butter and 1/3 cup of sugar.  I also cooked it as cornbread muffins to cut down on cooking time.  It turned out great!  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I liked this recipe, but only because I made the modifications suggested by other reviewers.  I decreased both the butter and the sugar to 1/2 cup each, and it was still plenty sweet and plenty tender.  Really, the texture is so soft, it's almost more like spoonbread than cornbread.  Surprisingly, the chopped green chiles added very little spice.  When I make this again, I will probably add more flour to give it more structure, and I may try substituting finely diced jalapeños instead of the canned green chiles.

Very delicious!  My son made this for his World Culture class' Cinco de Mayo party.  We followed the suggestion of a 1/2c of butter, but everything else we followed to a T.  Perfect blend of sweet & a hint of spice.  For an adult who loves spice would probably add some diced jalapenos, but for a class of 13 yr olds the spice was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe, will be doing this one everytime I want some cornbread & beans!!!

Not a crumb left! I cut the recipe in half and baked in a large cast iron skillet at 325 for about 35 minutes and it was perfect. I added chopped fresh jalapeno, omitted the sugar, and used a little more green chilies than it called for. I may cut back on the butter a little next time, but this was really good and a huge hit with family and a dinner guest.

This is hands down the best cornbread I've ever made.  After I had made it a few times i noticed the nutrition info (YIKES!) and decided to try a *lower* calorie version by replacing all of the butter with unsweetened applesauce, cutting the sugar in half (the applesauce adds some sweetness) and only sprinkling a little cheese over the top.  It was not as decadent as the original recipe (although my husband said he actually liked it better), but still quite tasty and much more reasonable in the calorie department.  If you aren't concerned with calories, make it with the original recipe because it's amazing!  Thank you so much for this recipe.

A friend of mine brought this to a New Years Day get together we have every year.  I couldn't believe the taste of this! I will only be making this when I make cornbread. It is the best I have ever had. I have made it twice. The first time, I made it exactly the way the recipe read. Too much butter for me. Still great flavor, but just too much butter. I made it a second time for the Cowboys game. I made it the way someone had suggested. Nine Tbls. butter. That was the only thing I changed. This is a keeper! You will not be disappointed! Love this!

Excellent recipe.  I wish I'd read the reviews first and cut back on the butter.  I would have liked it just as well less greasy and lower fat.  But its a keeper.

A close version of this recipe has been in my family for over 100 years and was a closely guarded secret from my Grate, Grate Grandmother who is originally from Honduras. After moving I lost it and have been poring through many different versions trying to recreate it before stumbling on this one, I almost started to cry, the only difference from Grams is that she used mild green chilies, and we cover the dish with foil for the first half of the bake time why I do not know but give it a try, I am not sure about the butter and sugar only time will tell my taste buds will not lie. My friends that I have made this dish for have been begging me to make it again but like I said I have misplaced the recipe. This is a true treasure and I cannot thank the original person that posted it enough!!!

This makes an excellent cornbread.  After reading some of the reviews I only used 1 stick of butter, 3/4 C. sugar and the entire 4 oz. can of green chiles.  I also sauteed about 1/4 C. of finely chopped onion with the butter before mixing it with the other ingredients.  I used all cheddar cheese since that's what I had on hand.  It was very moist and tasty without being heavy.  We served it with chili and it got rave reviews all around the table.

A little dry and bland. Next time I'll add more jalapenos, but will definitely try again.

Made this again last weekend for my family and wondering why I gave it 3 stars originally. This bread is amazing as written. I followed the recipe exactly and my family devoured it. Can't wait until it gets a little cooler to make again ... in fact, I don't think I'll wait :-)

Really good cornbread if you half the sugar and the butter! Jalapeno peppers go great as a substitute for the green chilles.

This is incredibly good.  Sweet, great texture, a combination between a moist corn cake like pudding and a rich cornbread that is easy to eat with your hands. I left out the chiles because kids were going to eat it and it was absolutely the best cornbread I have ever tasted! My new one and only cornbread recipe.

This was by far the best cornbread I have ever eaten.  I didn't think it was greasy at all.  Yes, it is fattening, but for a once in a while treat, you cannot find a more moist cornbread.  I guess the people who thought it was too greasy like dry cornbread.

This was the greasiest thing I have ever made.  I never post negative reviews but I couldn't let this go.  It is a pile of grease.  Way too much butter!  It was a very greasy cornbread.  Maybe the taste was okay but it was difficult to tell for all the grease and butter.  Very disappointing.

This cornbread is amazing!  I'll never make another kind.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used half the butter and sugar.  I also followed Lindsay's advice and cheated by using a Jiffy mix.  And finally, I only make half a batch because it's just me and my husband, so the can of diced chiles that I get is twice what the recipe calls for, but I throw the whole can in anyway.  It's perfect every time.

So delicious! I halved the recipe since there were only 3 of us. I used frozen corn (thawed) with 2 tbsp sour cream. I also cut the sugar slightly. I used 1/2 can of chiles for a half batch, but will definately add more chiles next time. there is probably more than enough butter in this recipe- but that's what makes it so fantastic!!

I also used the advice of other to only use half a cup of sugar and half a cup of butter. While the recipe only calls for a half of a can of green chiles, I did use a full can.  It gives it some extra kick without being too overpowering.  I sprinkled a little sugar on the top just as it came out of the oven.  

This is BEST served warm, but I can't stop nibbling at it even when it's cold. It keeps well and I have warmed it in the microwave as well.

YUMMY!!

I made this delish recipe as written and it was devine!  Paired wonderfully with Rick's Chili (from this site)and everyone at my party wants the recipe.  Don't overcook and just let sit and cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing.  Perfect!

We think this cornbread recipe is a winner!  Because of all the reviews about it being too sweet and too greasy, I only used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar.  I also went ahead and used the entire 4-oz. can of green chiles, since I didn't have anything else to do with them.  I didn't think it was even close to being too sweet or too greasy.  In fact, when I make it again I may make use the full cup of each just to see how we like it.  The texture was great, too.

This was my first time to make Mexican Cornbread. After reading the reviews on several of the recipes, I decided this was the one I wanted to try. It was fantastic!!! My family loved it and my husband said, "You need to make this again." I did follow the advice on most of the reviews and cut the butter down by half and I used 1/3 cup of sugar. I will use a whole can of green chiles the next time I make it because we didn't think 1/2 a can was enough. But it is truly delicious!!

This was great!  Since some in my family avoid green chilis, I split the recipe in half by using 2 8x8 pans and only added the chilis to one of the pans.  I used almost the whole can.  As others suggested, I did cut back on the sugar and butter.

Very good!  I accidentally put in twice the amount of butter, so I then doubled the remaining recipe ingredients to ensure it would come out okay.  I didn't have a second can of creamed corn, so I used white shoepeg corn, drained.  I also didn't have another can of chiles.  My Mom ate THREE PIECES.  This recipe is a keeper.  I made this cornbread to go with a very simple Taco Chili recipe.  A very easy, filling and flavorful meal.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I made this for a work luncheon and everyone loved this! Like others, I reduced both the butter and the sugar down to about 1/3 of a cup each. I used 2/3 c. hot green chile (frozen & defrosted) and used only cheddar as I didn't have Monterey Jack on hand and used homemade cream corn (Gulliver's Cream Corn). They were moist, slightly sweet, and were perfect with the cheese and chile! These definitely make more than 6 servings though! I probably cut mine into about 16 squares. Thanks Judy!

This recipe was excellent!  I made is exactly as the directions state.  However, it was waaay too sweet for my family's taste.  Next time I will cut the sugar down to 1/3rd to 1/2 a cup.  Other than that, this was the tastiest, most moist cornbread ever!

I was out of chiles the last time I made this, so I substituted Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce. I used 4 of them, diced, but less would work if you don't like that much 'heat'.  The combination of sweet, smokey and spicey was fantastic.

Wow! This turned out to be really delicious! I cut way back on the saturated fat and trans fat by using Smart Balance instead of butter. Other than that, I didn't modify the recipe at all. My husband and I and our guests loved it.

I usually don't eat corn bread, but this was the best! It was so moist and not what I expected at all! I made a mexican lasagna to go with it and it turned out amazing!! I'll definitely be making this again!

Frat bread!  I did not give 5 stars because I changed the recipe, so as it is, it´s not a 5 star. The changes are: reduce the butter ( I used salted) to 6 tablespoons, reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup, used mild green chiles and add 1/4 cup more of the cheese (bought a mix of both monterrey and chedar).
It´s an easy and quick bread, did it last night at the last minute to have for diner (frinds invited), served it with cream cheese.  My frinds said "could not be better"!

The only thing I changed was only using 1/2 cup melted butter. I just could not see it needing a full cup, and it didn't. With the full cup it would have been very greasy; with just a half cup, it was moist and still slightly greasy, so maybe even less butter is needed. I kept the full cup of sugar (we like sweet cornbread, and this is a sweet cornbread, so if you don't like sweet cornbread, try a different recipe), and it was just fine. I really liked the cheese and green chiles; I paired it with the White Chili with ground turkey and it was a really good combo.

You HAVE to cut the butter and sugar to 1/2 cup each. I roasted a very small red bell pepper over the gas flame and diced it really small and added to the chili/corn part.  Also, i didnt have quite 1/2 cup of butter so I---get ready now--added about 2 TBS bacon grease. I know, I know but its so good! Very good cornbread. i took it to a work potluck and they seemed to liked it.

I made this as part of a big old family dinner one night.  Everyone loved it so much that Grandpa had to bring some home with him.  It is really good.  I've made it twice now and the only thing I noticed is I like it cooked more so that it is really nice and brown.  AWESOME cornbread!

This cornbread is unbelievable.  The creamed corn really makes it super moist.  I left out the chilis, and added more cheese and other than the cooking time being a little off (I only needed to bake it for 30 mins. but that could just be my ancient oven) this is definately a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a cross between regular cornbread and sweet corn cakes, leaning more toward corn cakes which are a favorite of mine.  Loved this very much!  A winner with my whole family!

Oh, this is really really GOOD... Truly this cornbread is unbelievable! Very moist, sweet, not too grainy, not too cakey. The Monterey Jack gave this a really nice flavor. Mild peppers, not too spicy. I only had little over a 1/2 cup of cornmeal and used Jiffy corn muffin mix to make up the difference. I wasn't sure how it would affect this, but it came out fantastic. A keeper! Thanks for sharing this recipe. 5 stars all the way!!!!!!!!!

This was probably the best cornbread that I have ever had.  It was very moist and full of flavor.  I did add a whole can of chile peppers instead of half and it seemed just right.  My husband loved it too but suggested decreasing the sugar maybe to 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup.

A friend of mine at work brought this to office potluck event.  It was cold, but I loved it. I tried the recipe the week after, and wasn't very good because I did not use cream corn (used regular corn and mix them in blender) - it's not the same!  So I tried it again with cream corn, and it was unbelievable!  I couldnt find canned green pepper, and I used half a cup of dried jalapeno pepper instead and a little of other herbs - but it was really good with it too! Good job!

I liked the flavor, but I didn't enjoy the texture very much. It's so soft and crumbly that you have to eat it with a fork. My search will continue for a mexican-style cornbread that holds together when I pick  it up - maybe I'll try to tweak this one.

This was the best corn bread I have had. I followed advice of others and used less butter and sugar but I added more cheese.  I used the entire can of peppers and only half-drained it which kept it even more moist. Even my picky husband LOVED it.  This recipe makes a ton, so the second time I halved it and put it in a 8x8 pan.  Delicious!!

This by far was the BEST mexican cornbread I have had!  It was very moist and had a wonderful flavor to it.  I did leave out the green chilies for the kids and added the whole cup of sugar. I will make a double batch next time one for me and one for the kids.  Mine will have the chilies in it and maybe some other types of peppers also.  Thank you for this recipe!  YUMMY

Very good and it went over well with my family.  I made the recipe as written with the exception of halving the sugar.  I like my cornbread somewhat sweet (I grew up on the Jiffy Cornbread Mix) and using 1/2 a cup of sugar seemed to be perfect.  I will be making this one again and again.

This is without doubt the worst recipe for Mexican cornbread I've ever tasted!  It was so sweet it could almost have passed for cake.  This cornbread had at least four times too much sugar.

I didn't like this recipe at all.  I went by the directions exactly.  I would describe this as gooey, not moist and entirely too sweet.  I won't make it again.

I'm not too sure where I stand with this one.  It was waaay too sweet. I used jalapenos instead of chili peppers. While the flavours were good, despite the sweetness, my brain did not know what to make of it. One minute I think I'm eating cake and the BAM! I hit spicy jalapeno.  I do think I will try it again though.  Bur next time I will use half the sugar and half the butter.

This cornbread is perfect with chili.  Tried using margarine and splenda as well as the original recipe...really couldn't tell the difference....just as delicious either way...Thanks!

I reviewed the recipe to make sure that I did everything correctly.  But we did not like the texture of this cornbread- it was too "spongy".  It was also much too sweet for our tastes.

Put in the full can of chiles and accidentally left out one stick of melted butter.  Shortened the cooking time by 5 minutes.  The cornbread still turned out great! The whole family liked it.

I'm updating my review.  I definitely still give it 5 stars, but I do modify the recipe slightly.  I reduce the butter and sugar to 3/4 cup (anything less and I think you won't really appreciate the uniqueness of this recipe).  I also don't add anything spicy to it.  This is a great cornbread recipe for those who like it sweet.  The cheese gives it great texture.  Definitely not like a traditional southern-style cornbread, but all of my friends beg me to make it for them all the time.

I had been looking for a better side to serve with chili than standard corn bread, and this was easy & delicious. It has become a regular recipe in our household.

Yum!!!Thank you for sharing this recipe. I made it to take to a "Mexican Theme" party and it was a hit. It is moist and tender. Definately, something I will make again. I did alter it only slightly, I used Tex Mex cheese to replace the cheese in the receipe. The jalepeno jack added just a little zip and extra flavour. This baked perfectly and truly is a must have for everyone who loves cornbread! Thank again.

Good stuff, as others have suggested cut the butter in 1/2 and the sugar down to a 1/3 - also instead of stated cheeses, added a "mexican cheese" blend, and pepper jack and put in a little more than the recipe suggested. The pepper jack worked good to even out the spice in the bread, every bite had some heat :) very very good

I made some changes - used Splenda instead of sugar for a lower sugar version for my diabetic husband. Sweetness level was good - and if you want a non dry cornbread this IS the recipe. I lightened up on the butter volume based on other reviews. Overall a good recipe. The kids did not really like the green chilles flavor - but the adults approved.  Will try this again without the chile peppers and see if the kids are happier.

This is very good and so easy to make. We love a favorite Mexican restaurants corncake and this fits the bill to a T. I did reduce the butter and sugar by half and it was still very flavorful.

Excellent recipe! Although I may use jalapenos next time in lieu of the chile peppers. I love spicy! I was a little leary as to the temp only being 300 degrees, as most cornbreads are higher, but it worked perfectly! Great recipe!! a big thumbs up to the creator!

This is a fantastic recipe - my husband has 2 pieces of leftovers packed for his lunch tomorrow, he liked it so much!  I followed other users suggestions and cut the butter back to 1/2 cup, the sugar to 2/3 cup and 3 eggs.  For Canadian users, a 14 oz can of creamed corn and 4.5 oz can of chilies works just fine.  We'll definitely be making this again.

The best I've ever eaten. All I did was add one full 4 ounce can of chopped Fire Roasted Hatch New Mexico chilies. Remember folks, canned chilies that are fire roasted have no heat, only flavor so don't skip that part. If you want heat, add pickled jalapenos. This is a geat recipe!

Well, I followed a previous reviewers suggestion to do 1/2 c butter, 2/3 c sugar and whole can of chiles.  This was probably all a good move.  I'm rating it a little lower because I really couldn't taste the cheese and it wasn't all that moist but definitely not dry.  If I made it again, I might try doing all the butter, all the sugar and a whole can of chiles.  But it wasn't bad at all.  Nobody in our household is a huge cornbread fan, per se, so that could have a bit to do with the rating I'm giving.

I did my homework reading the many reviews on this one, and I am so glad that I followed the advice of many reviewers who suggested to cut down on the butter and sugar amounts.  I halved both ingredients, as well as, subbed the green chiles with jarred jalepeno slices.  It's a keeper!

I made this for a party and it was a hit!! Everyone loved it.  I had never made cornbread before and as I'm in Australia I couldn't get some of the ingredients.  I used a cup of Cheddar cheese and 1 fresh green chilli.  Everyone was asking if there was more.  Thanks Judy.

Very tasty, but a little greasy for my tastes. I think I will try it next time with less butter, maybe bake it at a slightly higher temp, 325-350? Otherwise good, I'll definitely make it again.

OMIGOSH!  This is absolutely the BEST cornbread ever.  We loved it so much, we gobbled it all up pretty quick.  A bit fattening, though- so for special occasions only, but so rewarding and heavenly!

After reading the reviews I decided to make this recipe with 1/2 the butter and cut back on the sugar as well.  It was wonderful.  I served it with a white chili that I got off this website and my fiancee raved about it.  I will make it again - it was very easy and delicious!

Really great corn bread.  As is, the recipe reminds me of a sweet corn bread served at a local grocery around here.  Reduce the sugar and butter, and it becomes a more savory bread well suited to chili and soups!  So, you've got the best of both in one recipe!
I made this for a luncheon ahead of time and the flavors really melded together well.  Thank!

Like others, I reduced the sugar and butter by half, but this was delicious!  I also used Pepper Jack cheese for an extra kick.  Baked in a cast iron skillet, this was definitely a hit with the family.

I am teaching my twelve-year old how to cook so I helped her with this and it came out very tasty.  It was made to accompany the Salsa Chicken recipe from this site (excellent).  As suggested, I did have her reduce both the butter and sugar by half.  We will definately make this recipe again and again.

Very Yummy! I halved the recipie, and it was enough for my family of four.  Cooked in a 8x8 glass pan for 50 minutes. I also cut the butter in half.  I liked the sweetness, but less sugar would not be bad either.

I should have read more of the reviews.  I made as directed except I halved the butter and added scallions.  It was still to greasy and cake-like.  My husband loved it for those reasons!  I agree, there was nothing mexican about it, I didn't even notice the chiles.  And it was a lot more than 6 servings.

My whole family, even the younger kids really like this cornbread, it is similiar to one we get at one of our favorite resturants. The serving size however is incorrect. This serves at least 12 not 6. I cut it in half and baked it in a 8x8 pan so we wouldn't have leftovers. It doesn't reheat that well, but no cornbread does!! Thanks for this great recipe!!

We're not normally too keen on cornbread, BUT, THIS stuff is amazing.  Worth every penny spent at the grocery store.  I share this with friends when I make it, so they can have a piece of this heavenly dish too!  Very moist, sweet, we can eat this 3 times a day!

I should have read the reviews, but I used all the recommended ingredients.  It wasn't cornbread, it was more like cake and it was too sweet.  I couldn't taste the cheese or the green chiles.  It was too moist - it fell apart in my hands.  If I make it again I will definitely cut the butter in half and maybe put in a 1/4 cup of sugar.  I was disappointed.  I didn't think there was any Mexican flavor to it at all.

I read all the rave reviews, I even cut the sugar and butter in half like many recommended.  I was really dissapointed in how it turned out.  There is so much creamed corn, there is no texture to the bread part of the cornbread!  Maybe I did something wrong. I won't try this recipe again.

This was great! I made it for a party, and it was gone instantly. Following others' advice, I halved the butter and sugar, and it turned out fine. I like a little extra kick, so I'm going to use the whole can of chiles next time, but for most people's taste the heat was perfect.

We eat at this wonderful restaurant, Rutherford Bar and Grill in the Napa Valley and our whole family looks forward to eating their cornbread.  This recipe is an incredible copy of their recipe.  We all love it as does our company.  If you decrease the butter by 1/4 cup, it won't be missed. This recipe is a real winner.

This is a very yummy cornbread!  It isnt at all dry and tasteless like many other cornbreads out there.  I admit... I havent gathered up enough courage to put the whole 1 cup of sugar in!  I always chicken out and put 1/2 cup sugar, and it is still SO delicious!  Also, I usually end up putting whatever cheese I happen to have into the recipe, and it doesnt seem to affect it negatively at all.  Whenever we have mexican food, my mother in law cant help but request this cornbread!  She says that she is in love with it, and I dont blame her!!  I also made it for my dad, and he was sure to get the recipe from me.  He said that it was the best cornbread he'd ever had!  This one is a thumbs up in my family, all the way!!

Edit (09/23/2005): This is still my favorite cornbread recipe.  I made it for work today, and everyone loved it.  One of my coworkers even told me that he hates cornbread and has never liked it, but he LOVED this cornbread!  That right  there says it all.  I've yet to come across someone who doesn't love this recipe... and I've been using it for over 4 years now!

Sorry, but I didn't care for this cornbread at all. It was heavy, not the least bit light and flaky like one expects with cornbread, and more than anything else...it seemed like someone had poured a liquid all over it and it was absorbed throughout. The taste itself was okay, but nothing striking.

Normally I don't change a recipe before making it, but after reading a good portion of the comments suggesting to decrease the butter & sugar I did. Using 1/2 cup of butter & 3/4 cup of sugar this recipe was delicious!!! My husband was nice enough to share a couple of pieces with me otherwise he ate the entire thing!  Will definitely include this in our monthly round-up.

I made a few changes to the recipe. As others have said,  I only used a half cup butter, half cup sugar. I also used half the 15oz can of cream style corn, the whole 4oz can of green chiles, added half a chopped onion, a 4oz can diced jalapenos, and used 1 cup shredded Mexican four cheese blend instead of the cheddar & Monterey Jack.  The result was a nice cornbread which was sweet but with a little jalapeno aftertaste. It was quite popular  at the potluck I made it for.

As a cornbread, this was delicious!  It was sweet, moist, good texture. The canned chili peppers invisibly bake into the bread, and the flavor is very subtle, so it was almost like there weren't any peppers in it at all.  I'll make it again, but will add some other peppers and ethnic flavor items to give it a kick.

I like this very much. I thought it a bit too sweet so the second time I made it I cut the sugar by half. And mine was a bit too dense the 1st time so I use 6 tsp baking powder not 4 on the second go around. Also added niblet corn and cheddar cheese but it's all good.

Loved it! Way better than the box. My family has a new and permanent cornbread recipe. Thank you! Because of my high altitude I added a little extra cornmeal and flour and baked it at 325 degrees. Maybe that is the sticky problem?

This was a hit at the office!  I added a little milk and used Jalepeno's instead of chile peppers.  I baked at 350  for 1hr. I also added a little hot oil to the bottom of the pan.

This is very good! Just made it and had a piece fresh out of the oven. I lowered the butter to 3/4 a cup and went with lowfat cheese. Also added a 1/2 cup of mild salsa. I think the family will like this one!

I made this last week to have with Buffalo chicken chili. A most excellent combination. I'm making it again tonight. However, I took the advice of many reviewers when making this for the first time to reduce the butter to half a cup and the sugar to 3/4 a cup. I will not make that mistake again. By reducing the butter you are taking out the biggest source of moisture. I will admit that I did not include the green chilies as I did not have them and don't particularly care for them. I would imagine they could contribute to moisture as well. Since I won't be using them tonight I will be sure to include the full cup of butter. I will update my review after doing this. Otherwise, this is a great recipe all around. I think the overall taste is highly dependent upon the type of cornmeal you use and how fresh it is. I'm not really sure why anyone would be making this recipe using a prepackaged cornbread mix- it rather defeats the purpose. This is an easy, made-from-scratch, delicious cornbread with a little extra something. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
Update: I made this last night with the full amount of butter. It definitely helped. Much moister. My family devoured it. I think next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I will meet half way with the butter. Perhaps 3/4 cup of butter. While the full cup helped make it moister, it may have been a tiny bit too crumbly from "grease". I will not go so far to say this was a greasy bread though. I will keep trying! Delicious.

Very moist and tasted great! I cut the amount of butter and sugar by just a bit and would probably cut the sugar even more next time and add a little onion.

BEST CORNBREAD EVER!!!!  Ever since I found this recipe and took it to several get-togethers, it is by far the most requested item that I am asked bring.  Simply delicious, especially if you like sweet cornbreads.  My husband eats it as a dessert a lot of times!  Great with soups!

Oh, my gosh, this is sooooo good.  I did take the suggestions made by others to cut butter and sugar by half.  This is the best cornbread I have ever eaten and my husband loved it, too. This will be a staple side for the many Mexican meals I cook. Thank you, Judy, for sharing this.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, is because I DID the cut the butter in half based on other reviews, and only added about 3/4 a cup of sugar. I accidentally cooked it at 350, so it only needed to cook around 40 min at that temperature. I substituted the chiles for jalapenos and only had whole kernel corn on hand. Still turned out fabulous! Made it alongside some vegetable soup and it was delicious. Will definitely make again!

My family loves this bread I think its good but I wouldn't call it a winner. I didn't make any changes I followed the recipe to the letter the 2 times that I've made it and I rarely have left overs. I've made it to go with soup and chili - both times it was good.

I foolishly just looked at the stars and forgot to read reviews first.  Way too much sugar and butter.  With so many reviewers stating that, it should be changed.  I'd also add jalapeño as it has no kick, at least to me, with the green chilies.

WOW!!! I didn't even get it out of the oven and the family was asking me to make it again! I will confess that I used 3/4 cup of butter instead of a full cup as the recipie called for. I also rinsed off the peppers to reduce the amount of heat. The only problem I have now is trying to plan a meal around this incredible side dish. It worked well with grilled pork chops and sausages, but I know it will be a part of my Thanksgiving feast as well. Thanks for this incredible dish!!

This recipe tasted really good. I served it with Chili I. Next time, I will use half the butter as other reviewers have suggested because it was too wet the first day but not so wet the next. Or I will make the day before.

For a healthier cornbread I substituted 1/2 Cup of olive oil for 1/2 cup of the butter in the recipe. Also cut back the 1 cup of sugar to 3/4 cup of sugar. Served the cornbread to over 100 people who also said it was the best cornbread they have ever tasted. I give this recipe 5 stars! YUM! -jagruti

This is just so amazing and such a great side for chili!! Of course this is not healthy by any means but it is so worth it. I split the mix into 2 batches, one with and one without jalapeños. Yummy!

Yum yum yum!! My husband and some friends couldn't get enough of it. It was incredible- moist with just teh right amount of kick- perfect with chili. Thanks to all the reviews warning about the sugar and butter. I decreased the amounts too- used 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 cups sugar. You could use 1/2 cup sugar if you don't like your cornbread very sweet. Instead of cheddar I used pepper Jack (in addition to Monterey Jack). I added 1/2 tsp onion flakes, 1/2 tsp garlic pwdr. Definitely a keeper.

This was so good! I only used 3/4 cup butter because that's all I had but it turned out fine. I also didn't have any green chile peppers so I had to add a little green taco sauce, but it worked for us!

Reduced butter to 3/4 c. Butter as other reviewers said to. Only added cayenne pepper as another reviewer stated. Not a good addition. Hot aftertaste for me and my family.

Ok, this was sooo good.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the butter in half, also didn't have the can of chillies so used a half a red bell pepper, diced, and some diced green onion.  It turned out absolutely delicious, I served it at a party with chilli, many people went back just for the bread, and it went like wildfire.  Great recipe.

I did not care for this recipe.  I'll stick to my regular cornbread recipe that doesn't have sugar in it.

This was good as far as cornbread goes, but I wanted more Mexican flavors.  I did half the butter and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup as others suggested.  I think next time I'll add more cheese, maybe even use pepper jack instead of Monterey, and include a diced jalapeno.  I did really love the texture of the cream corn.  I just think for our tastes I'll jazz it up a little next time.

Fantastic recipe. I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup and replaced 1/2 the butter with bacon grease, as well as added chopped bacon. Makes a great savory breakfast muffin!

This recipe was just ok. I would agree with the other reviews and say this was way to sweet. I was a little disappointed :( I remember eating Mexican style cornbread in California and it was amazing. wish i could have gotten the same from this recipe.

Eh, it was good.   Not what I expected, but it was worth the try.   It tastes like it was missing something..I'm just not sure what.   Hubby liked it and that's all that matters.

This is ultimately one of the cornbread recipe I seem to have been looking for although I never knew it. I like a cornbread that's more like a cake, sweet & light, not heavy or dense or worse = dry! This is good. Might half the sugar since I like to eat my cornbread crumbled up in my beans, but this was really good! Worth a try and very much worth a recommendation!

Made homemade cornbread for the first time tonight. I could not find my baking powder so I substituted a small amount of Instant Yeast. I also only used 1/2 cup of butter and being I have small kids I added only 4 slices of jalapeno chopped real small. It tasted really good just didn't fluff up much.

If anyone says this isn't good? They probably just didn't follow directions correctly! I don't remember ever even liking cornbread until we made this 1 & it's a hit w/everyone!

excellent i had to change it to half the amount of cream corn since i only had the half size can. i used a full cup of taco blend cheese which is half cheddar half monterey jack. i added a splash of rooster sauce and 1/2 the sugar which was plenty sweet for us.

I added chopped pimento, green pepper, and a little green onion.  We served it topped with cheddar cheese, sour cream and salsa.  My family loves it!

Simply the best cornbread.  It's a hit where ever I take it.  I add  2 small jars of pimento to give it more color and I live at a higher elevation so I have to bake it 15 minutes longer.  I tried this recipe in a gas oven at a friends house and found that you have to adjust bake time for gas ovens.  Fattening?  Yes, but ever so good.

This was really awesome, but next time I will cut the butter and sugar in half.  My hubby and I agreed after a couple of bites it was more cake like than cornbread.  Will make again though!

this corn bread was so moist and every 1 at my Mexican Christmas Dinner loved it. I didnt have the yellow corn meal on hand so i used two boxes of Jiffy Corn Bread Mix. It turned out perfect.

Okay - I'm going to delete the other cornbread recipes I have. This was wonderful, received great comments from my family, was easy to make, tasted delicious. I halved the recipe and it still worked well. I sprinkled some crushed red pepper flakes on top for presentation and it turned out nicely. Thanks so much for this recipe that even my cornbread-discerning husband loved.

What a disapointment after reading all of the great reviews.  I'm giving it 2 stars because it was edible, however, did not live up to the reviews by any means.  I should have stuck with my old standby which is... Jiffy Cornbread Mix, follow the instructions on the box and then add a handfull of cheddar cheese, a handfull of frozen corn and some diced up green onions.  It is quicker, taste better and the leftovers are good.  We tried to eat the leftovers from this receipe a few days later and they were unedible.

I made this to serve with Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Soup (found on this site).  I am glad I took the advice of others and cut down the sugar and butter by half, I think any more would have been over kill.  The texture was good, but I didn't taste any of the "extras" (cheese, chili's, etc).  That being said, everyone enjoyed it and i will definitely make it again!

Having attempted to make many mexican cornbreads, I was hoping this was finally the one. It is! Very good! I did reduce the butter and sugar by half though.

Yum!!! A few changes (all unintentional):  I only had 3 eggs, but they were extra large, so I don't think that hurt any.  Also, I used unbleached flour, so mine was a little darker but the taste was the same.  Also, I could not find shredded monterey jack cheese (don't ask why I just didn't shred it myself, please lol), so I used colby/monterey jack along with the cheddar. I did not feel it had too much butter or sugar.  I used all ingredients at the amounts called for (except the eggs), and I thought it was perfect!  Went great with a pot of chili!  I'll definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious....Perfect with a mexican meal and is a nice twist.   Otherwise I would rather just have regular corn bread if not eating with a mexican dish.

Well I should have listened to the reviews and cut the butter and sugar. Way to much sugar, sweet like cake and greasy because of all that butter. I might make it again but I would cut the butter and sugar in half.

I made this recipe and took other reviewers suggestion and added 1 can of drained corn, only 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 c. melted butter. Took it to an office luncheon/meeting and it was the hit of everything served. It was heavy, moist and very delicious. And it was very easy to make. Will defintely make again.

I made this tonight with ribs and coleslaw. I didn't care for this at all, and my boyfriend who actually requested cornbread was dissapointed and wouldnt even finish his one piece, and he is pretty much a garbage disposal lol. He is the not picky at all! Sorry but we just didn't really care for this, I think I will just stick to making traditional cornbread.

It was pretty good, I did like how moist it was.  Definitely too much sugar...I think that maybe even 1/2 cup could be too much.  Next time I will decrease the sugar, double the cheese and peppers, and maybe add something for some heat, like pepper jack instead of regular Monterey.

This is, bar none, THE BEST cornbread in the world!!  I have to change things to gluten-free, so I reduced the baking soda to 3 teaspoons, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, and the salt to 1/8 teaspoon.  These changes are because the gluten free flours react differently than wheat. Children LOVE this cornbread.  (including my husband!!)

I read the reviews before I made it and altered to suit our tastes.  I used half the butter, which was still too much and 1/4 cup of sugar.  My group doesn't love sweet cornbread.  Overall, with the changes the first time, good recipe.  The next time I made it this I used 1/4 cup of butter and no sugar and it was a hit.

This recipe is very good -- my children enjoyed it as well, which is always positive testimony. I used only 1/2 cup butter - it was plenty moist, and I cannot imagine using a full cup. I think it would be much too greasy. Also, as per the other reviews, I decreased the amount of sugar. I used 1/4 cup splenda and 1/2 cup sugar - it was plenty sweet for us - still tasted like cornbread. Next time I will try increaseing the splenda and decreasing the sugar. Also, I used the entire 4 oz can of chilis. Very good recipe -- will make this again.

I made these as muffins. They were good, though I actually was hoping for some more flavor from the cheese and chilies. Based on other recommendations, I cut the butter in half and only used 3/4 cup of sugar. Next time I may go down to 1/2 cup of sugar and/or increase the chilies and cheese. But the texture was great, and the corn flavoring was also really nice.

Finally a moist cornbread.  This was fantastic. We were having BBQ night so I omitted the chili peppers. I also ran the creamed corn thru the food processor because I don't like piece of corn in my cornbread.  It was absolutely delicious.  A perfect 10!

I have been trying to locate this recipe for 25 years! Used to make one like it. My hubby hates jalapeño. even the canned variety, loved this cornbread! The best part is the crispiness from using cornmeal rather than the box!

I have made this recipe about a hundred times.  It is outstanding.  I make it with or without the jalopeno....delious either way.  I also half the recipe and cook it in a pie plate, turns out wonderful.  Easy easy easy....people will ask you for the recipe!

This was by far the best cornbread I have eer had. I did follow the recipe exactly since it was my first time and everyone LOVED it. I will follow the suggestions of cutting the butter in half and backing off the sugar just a tad. Just because I'll feel better about having seconds, it's packed with calories and fat.  Boy, is it good though!

I have been making this recipe for years and it's still one of the most-requested things that I bake.  (I simply omit the green chile peppers for "regular," instead of Mexican, cornbread.)  I've passed along the recipe to many others who have requested it.  I'm not sure why some people were reviewing it as being too greasy -- I don't have that problem at all.  Thanks for sharing.

Update: I've made this many times now, people love it!  This is my go to recipe for cornbread.
*** I used blue cornmeal because I couldn't find the yellow...not the best choice, makes the cornbread look moldy.  I tried to pawn it off as my Halloween cornbread, I think it worked!  It's delicious despite the appearance.

This is by far the best cornbread I have ever had. I dont use canned cream corn I make my own so thats what I did and I didnt have any store bought peppers but had anaheims that I grew myself and I just blanched them. There wasnt any heat.but thats ok there was a lot of flavor. I will always make this cornbread instead of the boring one that comes on the cornmeal package. And as for the other reviewers. I disagree it was not greasy at all. Maybe you have to use real butter not margarine. It was the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe was good, but I made some modifications after tasting the batter.  I definitely cut the butter in half.  I added the whole can of chilis, and I also added some cayenne pepper and cumin.  I felt that the cornbread was a little too sweet, so I will cut the sugar in half next time I make this.

This was corn "cake".  Way too sweet!  When I make corn bread, with a recipe given to me by a native american married to a mexican almost 40 years ago, I use 1/4 cup of sugar for a 9x13 inch cake pan of corn bread.  She also taught me to make chili and homemade tortillas.

This was extremely moist and quite good. The kids and I loved it, my husband was indifferent. I didn't have creamed corn so I used whole kernel white corn and I also used a pepper jack cheese. I think if I were to make this again, I'd cut back on the sugar and maybe add a little Frank's Hot Sauce to give it more of a kick to offset the hot/moist. This is one of the moistest cornbread I've ever had.

This recipe is good, however very heavy.  I used 1/2 the amount of butter and sugar and it was still plenty sweet and greasy.  I don't think I would make it again, even though it was good.

I took the advice of others who reviewed this recipe and halfed the butter and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I also used jarred jalepenos instead of green chiles.  It turned out amazing!!!  Everybody at work loved it and want me to make it again.

I substituted the last 4 ingredients for 2 boxes of Jiffy Corn Bread Mix.  I also substituted the cheese with Jalapena Jack Cheese.  I made this for a Mexican themed Game Night and it was huge it.  It was more like a sweet corn cake (like you get at El Toritos, but more moist) and we all loved it.  It didn't seem oily to me, just wonderfully buttery.  But I also like Paula Dean so I'm big on skimping when it comes to butter baby!

I rated it a 5 star,as I thought it had a great taste. My problem was it gave me the impression it wasn't done, and I knew I followed the recipe to the tee, I think I will do what some did bake it at 325 and cut the butter, maybe that will do the trick. I like a sweet cornbread as well, and I have never liked cornbread before.

I have made this so many times! Love it. I always cut the butter and sugar in half, and then the entire recipe in half again and cook it in a hot cast iron skillet in the oven, when the skillet is preoiled and preheated the batter sizzles when you pour it in and makes a nice brown crust. The results are always so moist and flavorful!

Loved it. I went with what the others said about the halving the butter and sugar. I used a muffin pan and the cook time was cut in half. Great taste and recipe.

AMAZING!!! I only made two changes. I used 2 boxes of Jiffy cornbread mix instead of what was listed and I only added 1/2 cup of butter. I kept everything else the same and it was great. We had some friends over for dinner and by the time we got up only 1/4 of the pan was left. You cant go wrong with this. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Too greasy, but a good recipe.  Great flavor and texture, otherwise.. follow the other reviews and cut the butter a bit depending on your tastes.

I have made this recipe for several years now. I have never cut back on the sugar until this year and honestly it is still very good with just a 1/2 cup.   I make this recipe every year to go with our New years tradition... Black-eyed peas and mexican corn bread. So good!!!!!!!! You must try it!

I absolutely LOVED this cornbread.  One thing though, you have to love butter.  Some people found it "greasy", I just found it "buttery" and moist.  It really was the best cornbread I've made and will make many times again.  I only added half the can of peppers as the recipe says, but next time I'll add the whole can.

I've made this umpteen times according to the recipe (always real butter in my life) and always for a crowd. Everyone loves it, and I have referred them all to this site for the recipe. I don't know what people have done wrong to rate it poorly, as it's the best cornbread EVER... I even forgot to put in the baking powder once, it turned out okay but a lot more buttery, and people still raved about it! As a matter of fact...I had the most compliments on it at that particular party...so lots of us don't think there's too much butter!

I went by the other reviews and used half the sugar and half the butter and it turned out just sweet enough and not greasy at all it was great. However, I did double the recipe of the cream corn and it still turned out fine! Thanks for sharing I will enjoy this one again and again!

I used 1/2 the amount of butter and sugar, no chiles(because I didn't have any), added 1 can of whole kernel corn, used extra sharp cheese in place of the other cheeses and cooked it at 350 for 35 mnutes in a glass pan. The rest of the recipe I did as written. It came out perfect. I will make it again.

Usually cornbread is so dry I dread eating it. This was moist and yummy. I used the full amount of butter and didn't notice it being greasy, but I suppose that's just preference. Used cheddar and pepper jack cheeses with a couple dashes of hot sauce and chili powder. Next time I would add even more. All in all, a very good recipe.

I didn't really like cornbread until I had this recipe.  The kids and husband love it.  My sister in-law makes this, and my brother and parents (not cornbread eaters either) love it as well.  We use different cheeses, depending on what we have on-hand.  Usually we use Flagship (made locally at Pikes Place Market in Seattle) and cheddar cheeses.  This is a great recipe to take to or make for a BBQ.

Great Recipe, I did modify the recipe slightly to get what I was looking for, a moist traditional cornbread with corn. using this recipe as a base gave me what I was looking for, and it was the best home cooked cornbread I ever tasted. I did not used any pepers, I just used the some shredded chedar cheese towards the end. I am also health consious, and made fhte following changes to make it healthier. I used 6 table spoon worth of margarine. I used egg substitute for real eggs, sugar substitute, for the regular sugar, I also added a bit of fat free sour cream to maintain moistness, and a quarter cup of heavy whipping cream, at the ended, I mixed some fat-free shredded cheddar cheese, and baked. It was one of the best corn bread Ive ever tasted, and was gone shortly after cooking. (Also Healthier than major Restaurant Corn Bread) Looking forward to making it this weekend for dinner guest.

Good stuff! Like everyone else, I cut back on the sugar and butter.  Whenever possible I like to lighten up ingredients so I used Egg Beaters, Splenda & poured in I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Spray. I was able to reduce baking time to 45 minutes. Served with Emeril's Dirty Rice recipe. Will be good with the Boilermaker Chili from this site too. A definite keeper!!

Excellent recipe. I followed the direction exactly and it turned out picturesque. Would probably still be very nice with half the butter, but why?  Rather mild, so I will double the green chili peppers next time. Great with beans, chili or just plain!

Like so many other reviews, I prepared this to take to a party. It FLEW out once the first piece was eaten. I used small and large muffin pans to make serving easier. I upped the temp to 325 Convection and started testing the small pan at 30 minutes. Came out perfect. Great flavor. BRAVO JUDY SPENCE!!!

I just loved this recipe.  I made my sugarfree by using 1/2 cup xylitol and I only used 1 stick of butter.  I also added some chopped up jalapeno.  This was just such a delight hot or cold.

This is really, really good.  I made a few changes both to make it healthier and b/c I did not have all the ingredients.  Changes: Smart balance light butter and smart balance cheese, egg beaters, splenda (and just about 2 T of sugar) and a cup of frozen corn in about 1 cup skim milk (instead of creamed corn).  It was fabulous and less fat and calories.  ~Kristian, RD, LD from KY.

I followed everyone's advice and cut the butter down to 1/2 cup.  I was too lazy to get my sugar container out so added a packet of Equal.  I served it with Flatlander Chili from this site - our favorite chili recipe.  Yummy ... this cornbread was perfect with chili.  When my husband came home from work, he opened the door and smiled and said "mmmmm it smells like Cornbread and chili!" ... his tummy was happy tonight.

This cornbread was DELICIOUS! We ate it with the slow cooker chicken tortilla soup and it made the whole meal even more wonderful! I followed the advice to reduce the sugar and butter, and next time I will reduce the butter even more (to about 1/3 cup). It really doesn't need much butter, it stays very moist with the creamed corn. Best of all, it was very easy to make, so I wasn't slaving in the kitchen while my guests were here.

Holy cow this was good.  I made a few changes.  I halved everything, but then halved the butter and sugar again, if that makes any sense at all.  I used bottled, pickled jalapenos in place of the green chilis as I like those better.  I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes in a 9 inch round cake pan and that was perfect.  Even my 6 yr old went back 4 times!  Thanks!

I made this to complement my chili during a chili cook off.  It was more popular than my chili.  A big hit with people of all ages.  Kids even liked it.  People wanted the recipe.  I had to make another batch the next day since I had only a few pieces of leftovers.

I thought I made pretty good cornbread till I tried this. Now I know I make the BEST cornbread with this recipe. If I know everyone i'm serving this to can handle it I replace all the cheese with shredded pepper jack cheese. Perfect cornbread!!

This was my first attempt at cornbread from scratch and I couldn't have been more pleased.  I took the advice of some of the other cooks and halved the butter and sugar.  It was still plenty sweet and very moist.  I didn't want to waste half a can of chiles so I used the whole can.  Other than that, didn't change a thing and it turned out perfectly!  Will definitely make again!

I halved the recipe, used a 9" square pan & baked it in a 350 oven for about 27 mins. Didn't rise all that much, but the flavor was good.

I made this tonight for dinner along with "White Bean Chicken Chili"(On this site)YUM! 
The only changes I made are as follows. I used Betty Crocker cornbread mix instead of cornmeal and used  "mexican blend"
shredded cheese. Still pretty much the exact recipe and it was the best cornbread I've ever had! My family LOVED it!

If you don't have creamed corn... which was my problem.... simply use regular canned corn, and blend it in the blender, BUT make sure you drain some of the water/juice from the can, and add a little bit of milk if it is too thick.

This is a great way to make cornbread, although not your typical way it is a great variation.  I also used less butter and sugar.  I added the entire can of diced green chilies, took to a Potluck at work and it was well received. I paired it with Chile.

Soul Food cornbread! Not the dry stuff that people toss together with a few ingredients, or make if they are on a really strict diet. This is the real stuff, with very moist, cake-like texture. I took some to a pot-luck on exam-day in my CNA class. Everybody loved it.. the latinas said I "do some good cooking for a white girl!" The batter is so yummy you can just dip your finger in it. I am making it for the second time today. I licked the batter bowl clean.
 This time I used jalopenos instead of green chilis for the flavor and extra kick. I am a lean, slender girl, but when I splurge, I want it to be worth every calorie. And this certainly is.

There's a reason I trust the reviewers - they're RIGHT! I fixed this ahead of time to take on a camping trip and served it with Chili Rick's from this site. Talk about raves. I followed others suggestions and cut the butter in half, used a little less sugar (even though my clan has a huge sweet tooth), added a 7 oz. can of chilies and dumped in a little extra cheese. The suggestion to use Jiffy corn bread mix was genius. I'm making it again tonight - to eat with the leftover Chili Rick's that also was a major hit with our group of 12. Thanks to all.

This cornbread is really good.  Its moist and full of flavor.  I doubled the recipe except the following ingredients: I used only 1-cup butter; 1 cup brown sugar; 6 eggs; 6 teaspoons baking powder; 1/4 teaspoon salt. I also did not use the Chile peppers because my SIL cannot eat spicy foods and did not want to risk it.  After mixing the batter, I let it stand for 20 minutes so it would crown before pouring into the pan.

This was served to my inlaws and they just raved about it...The whole thing was eaten in under 30 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe...again, very good.

This was bar none the BEST cornbread my family and I have ever put in our mouths. This is so good it will make you smack your Granny! I followed the recipe exactly except I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/2 the butter it called for. I HAD to take everyone's advice on that and I am so glad that I did, because it was PERFECT!!! I cannot tell you how good this was, you just have to make it! OH, I lied!! I forgot that all I had was cheddar cheese and so I used 1 cup of that instead of 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 monterey jack.

This is wonderful!!  I made it just as shown, and it was great.  My husband and I agree that a whole can of green chiles instead of a half would be great too, I will try that next time.

I just made this and like it very much but it's a bit too sweet for my taste and that's even after I cut the suger down to 3/4 cup.  I also listened to others and cut the butter in 1/2.  Next time I make, and I will make it again,  I will use 1/2 cup of suger.  It has great flavor and texture otherwise.

Absolutely the best cornbread I have ever made.  Came out perfect the first time trying it.  Not too moist and definately not dry.  Would use jalapenos the next time for more spice, but not needed for a perfect cornbread.

Especially good and also easy to make. Hearty and filling. Husband said "Ahhh,this is special cornbread!" and one son, who usually isn't interested in eating cornbread,took 2 pieces home with him. I used the whole can of green chilies.

I have read some reviews about this cornbread being too greasy and/or too sweet, so when I made it, I used about half the sugar and used light margarine instead of butter (and I still used about 2/3 of a cup instead of a cup anyway). It turned out moist, but not overly greasy or sweet so I would recommend making it that way =)

Too sweet! Lots of people said this was too greasy. I didn't think so, but after my first bite I thought, "too much sugar!" Do not let it get cold, as it is much more palatable when it's still hot. I will not be making this again.

So I was in a hurry to get to a potluck dinner and cheated a little with this recipe...I mixed up two packages of Betty Croker cornbread mix than added the corn, chilies and cheeses baked it in a cast iron skillet for about an hour..when I took it out of the oven I topped it with a little more cheese...the end product was very good and all gone at the end of the night...I will make it again as written so I can find out how good it really is

Absolutely scrumptious. I've been looking for a superb cornbread recipe for years, and here it is! I wanted plain, non-Mexican style cornbread though, so simply omitted the cheeses and peppers ( this meant I needed to increase the salt from 1/4 tsp to 1 tsp to replace what would have been supplied in the cheeses and peppers, and it was perfect). Also decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup ( my personal taste) and baked it in 9 inch square pan. 
Thanks, Judy, for a GREAT recipe.

This is so good.  I really wanted to add more cheese, so I cut out the butter completely.  I used 1 1/2 cups of cheese and 1/2 cup of chopped jalapenos for that extra kick.  Like most other reviewers, I didn't need the whole hour to bake this-just 40 minutes.  I used the whole cup of sugar, and I'm glad I didn't use butter.  It's cheesy and spicy and somewhat sweet.  Great combo of flavors!

This was just okay.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup like others.  If you don't like creamed corn (and I don't like it much), you probably won't like this recipe very much.  Very strong creamed corn flavour.

This is the best!  I get rave reviews each time I make it.  I scaled it down a bit to fit in my cast iron skillet.  I have also cut the sugar down quite a bit, for my own personal taste.  It is great and you can't go wrong!

This is positively the BEST cornbread recipe I have ever tried.  I wouldn't change a thing...except to make more than one batch at a time.  I made this to go with some chili for a church game night, and everyone loved it!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I followed the suggestion of several reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I am grateful for that as the end result had just the right amount of sweetness.

I also followed the result of several viewers and reduced the butter to 6 Tablespoons, and the end result was moist and not greasy.

The combination of green chiles, cheddar cheese, and montery jack cheese also lends a great zip to the recipe.

What merits the 1 star is I was terribly disappointed with the texture and color of this cornbread. Perhaps the 4 eggs should have tipped me off, but the recipe ended up much more like corncake than the dense, moist bread I expect from cornbread. I was also disappointed in the unattractive yellow paste-color of my end bread (perhaps a result from tweaking the recipe). Overall I am grateful that I made this and tasted it before taking it to a potluck; this is not an offering I would wish to be associated with. I think I shall try to tweak a standard recipe to encorporate the chiles and cheeses.

OH My! Was this cornbread wonderful! I took this to a church function and it was gone in no time. It was so moist. I would put more green chiles in it next time and adapt it for my husband to be able to eat it. He is a diabetic.

Yummy and moist and perfect!  Not everyone in my family liked it though so I didn't give it 5 stars.

I would call this corn cake, not cornbread.  I made this tonight for a potluck in the neighborhood, and it was not a crowd pleaser.  I used 2/3 of the butter and 2/3 of the sugar and it was still too sweet.  I like sweet cornbread, but not like this.  I also used jalapenos instead of chilies and pepper jack instead of monterey.  I have lived in the South all of my life and have had a lot of cornbread, and cornbread THIS AIN'T.  I didn't mind the greasiness so much as the texture.  I was just like cake.  I won't make this again.

This cornbread is absolutely 100% perfect!  (I don't count the fact that it is a heart attack in a 9x13 pan.)
My husband's new favorite recipe!  Good stuff!

This cornbread was absolutely wonderful!  It is not good for the health concious, however, but I think you could cut some of the ingredients down to make it a little lower in fat and calories.  I followed the recipe exactly though and everyone loved it!

This was absolutely wonderful!  I decided to leave out the chilies because I really just wanted a sweet corn bread.  It made such a large batch that I decided to have a bit for breakfast.  I almost liked it better cold at breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is THE BEST, especially when you add a little honey to the corn mixture.  My husband requests this all the time (especially on game day with chili).

This has become our "go to" cornbread recipe. We've used jalapenos as well as green chilies and it's great either way. You won't go wrong with this one!

Extremely good....!   Instead of sugar, I use pancake syrup (1/2 cup); add garlic, fresh ground pepper, green onions, monterey cheese with jalapenos and cayenne on the top....it's a 10!!!!

Great recipe, but I modified it and it worked for me.  I didn't have chiles or creamed corn when I wanted to make it so I substituded the cream corn and chiles with one 15 1/4 ounce can of Del Monte fiesta corn which I put in the blender.  My family and friends love it.

This is the absolutely great cornbread. My husband enjoyed it a lot. Only thing I changed was that I used jalapenos peppers instead of chiles and it was incredible. Thanks so much.

I cut this recipe into 3 servings and then cut the sugar and butter measurements in half. This turned out AMAZING! I served it with vegetarian chili and it was incredible. Not too sweet and had a great consistency for cornbread.

This was a big hit at a potluck dinner!  Like many others, I halved the butter and sugar and doubled the green chiles.  This will be a staple from now on.

FANTASTIC.  Scanted the sugar a bit and used the whole can of chile's.  Yes, more cake than bread, but oh so good.  Moist, soft, spicy and sweet.  Oh, Mexican doesn't get better than this.

I got rave reviews on this one.  I did cut back the sugar and I cooked it in my cast iron skillet.  I also added jalapenos. One person told me it was the best cornbread he had eaten in 25 years.

I love cornbread and thought I'd give this recipe a whirl last night.  Having read other reviews, I decided to use a 1/2 C of butter and a 1/2 C of sugar. My boyfriend and I thought the cornbread was DELICIOUS but I have to disagree with the other posters.  I think using 1 C of sugar would be perfect!  Then again, I do like my sweets.  I'm going to give this four stars for now and will make this recipe again soon with the entire cup.  If it turns out like I think it will, I will give this five stars and will wish there were more to hand out!  Thank you for such a delicious recipe:)

Very good, no-fail cornbread.  I took it to a potluck and it was well-received.  Next time I will add a bit of cumin and maybe some onion.  I did cut the sugar back by half and used the entire can of chile, as suggested by other reviewers.

Fantastic! The only thing I changed was to add the whole can of chili's which really didn't make a difference anyway. Otherwise liked it exactly as recipe stated, including the whole cup of sugar. I like mine a little sweeter, and it was not overly sweet.

this was great.  I used two boxes of cornbread for the last 4 ingrediants and excluded the chile peppers and it was perfect.  I made them into muffins for a fiesta party and everyone raved.

This cornbread us fantastic, but I REALLY recommend cutting the amount of sugar in half. I did so & it was still pretty sweet. Also, I made w-jalepeno peppers instead of green chilis.

This is excellent cornbread recipe.  My husband especially loved it.  He craves mexican dishes.  I didn't have cream of corn so I made my own from frozen corn and milk.  Turned out really good.  I added a little bit more of green chilis, and it still could use a little bit more for our taste.  just excellent.  Served it with Mexican Rice (by AlanasMOM) and stir-fried beef, onions, and peppers. Avocados too! YUM YUM YUM

This is AMAZING.  It's very easy to make, and it's absolutely delicious.  It's very sweet... can almost be eaten as a dessert, but is great as a bread with dinner.  My friend liked it so much, she ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day!

This was the best mexican cornbread that I have ever tried! It was easy and perfect! It wasn't too sweet for me. I did double the green chiles only because I love it. I also used margarine and it was still yummy! If you love cornbread and love mexican food, you'll love this! I've been looking for this recipe for a long, long time! My search is over! I will definitely make this again and again!

Wonderful!!!  All my guests loved it!  I didn't change a thing.  It was a little too sweet for me, so I'll adjust it down to 1/2 cup or a 1/4 cup of sugar.  If you like sweet, the 1 cup of sugar will be fine.  It goes great with the Chili I recipe submitted by Bob!  It will certainly be made again & again!!!  Thanks Judy!!

*****I changed so much in this recipe, I didn't feel it was right to rate it. But after my alterations, I really enjoyed it. Neither my husband nor I like sweet cornbread, so I omitted the sugar completely. I used the whole 4 oz. of green chilies and added a seeded, chopped serrano pepper. It still didn't turn out hot at all, so next time, I may use 2-3 serranos or one habanero. Also, I only used 3/4 c. butter instead of 1 c. 1/2 c. butter would be alright too. I think next time, I will add 2 cans of cream-style corn to make it more moist.  I served this with homemade chili, and I'm thinking of making Green Chile Chicken Stew from this site to serve with the cornbread as well.

YUM! YUM! YUM!  This was incredible.  I only used three sticks of butter, and that was a little too much.  Next time I make it, I'll only use two sticks.  This was a great dish for my "mexican fiesta".

Overall a moist cornbread that my guests enjoyed. I made just 1/2 recipe in an 8x8 pan and cooked it for 35 minutes. I used the whole amt of butter and sugar for a half recipe and it tasted great.  This is a sweeter cornbread, for those who like that. I left out the chilis because we don't like them and it was still great.  Only thing I think I may do next time is to puree the creamed corn so that there are no chunks of corn. I have tried two of these types of recipes with corn in them and I just don't like the texture. I will make this again.

This was an okay recipe.  The cornbread comes out very greasy.  I also usually like cornbread a little sweeter so I would recommend another half cup of sugar added.  Overall, a decent recipe, but I haven't stopped searching for the best cornbread recipe with this one.

Very, very good and very easy to make.  I gave it 4 stars because I thought that it was a little too much butter.  My husband the "butter lover" thought it was the BEST!!
It's a keeper, Thanks :o)

This was fantastic. Two changes I made...I cut the cheese down to 1/2 cup and I just happened to have left over roasted red pepper from another dish I made that night, so in it went! Everyone loved it at our dinner party, the only bad thing was that there were no left-overs.

yummy. Could be a little spicier. But it was easy to make and beautiful to look at.  I made it for an event - the event got postponed. It was in the refrigerator for 2 days before we could eat it. I heated it up in the microwave and it was still moist and tasty, even 2 days later.

This is great cornbread - nice and hot! I used half the butter and half the sugar and jalepenos rather than green chiles. Recipe says it serves 6 but it really serves at least double that.

I made this for a potluck, and every body went back for seconds and thirds. They even said it was better then the dessert!
It could probably use a little less butter though.

I followed the suggestions of others and halved the sugar and butter.  I wish I would have added in the entire can of chiles, because it really didn't gain the chile taste and just appeared to have little specks in the bread.  Overall, it is a good recipe.  Kind of heavy though.

This is sooooooo good!  Everyone who tastes it asks me for the recipe.  And it's really easy to make!  When I make this, I get way more that 6 servings, but I guess it depends on the serving size.  I'd say there's more than enough for a potluck or family function.

i made this for 24 servings.  i cut the eggs by 1/4. i used 3 cans of cream corn and 1 can of whole corn drained.  i also used self rising corn meal for 1/4 of the required cornmeal amt.   it gave it a little more "cakey" texture.  i served it with chicken enchilada soup and it was an instant hit.  one gal ate 6 pieces and i've had many requests for the recipe.

I have made this several times and people love it.  I use 1/2 c. sugar and substitute jalapinos for chilis.  I also pour in about 2 Tbsp juice from the jalapinos.  Yum..........

I cut this in half and it turned out just great. I added less butter, i used corn meam and corn meal flour, an 8.5 oz can of creamed corn. I added pepperjack cheese in place of the monterey and i also added a few chopped pepperoncinis (seeds and all)in place of the green chillis. I was a bit timid to try this recipe because of the ingreedients but now I am VERY happy I tried it. This is a keeper.

A little too sweet for our tastes.  I did cut back on the sugar and butter as suggested-will cut even more next time.  Very moist.  I think I would put the whole can of chilies in and maybe a little more cheese as well.

A little too sweet. As per other reviews I cut the butter in half. I also used white/yellow corn instead of frozen. For added kick I recommend using pepper jack cheese and a little bit of extra sharp cheddar(Cabots is a favorite of my family). Thanks for sharing!

First off, I love butter.  This recipe has way too much butter in it to be good.  I cut the butter in half and still thought it was too oily.  You could probably cut the butter completely or by 75% and get a much more solid and tasty cornbread.  I won't be making this one again.

This is an excellent recipe!  It is indeed very moist and tasty - sweet with a bit of spiciness.  I have converted 2 non-cornbread eaters with this recipe.  They usually don't like it because cornbread tends to be dry, but they love this recipe.  I think next time I will either double the amount of peppers, or use something spicier, like jalepenos in place of the green chiles.

This was so delicious!! I loved it. I have to say though, it was not "gone" from my superbowl buffet. Someone even said "I thought this was cornbread...but, is it?" It was VERY sweet but I thought it went perfectly with my VERY hot chili! Also, this recipe would make PERFECT corn muffins. I am going to omit the chili's and use it to make muffins, I loved the taste so much.

As mentioned before recipe had way to much butter and sugar.  It really was corncake and I found it disappointing as with the peppers and the term Mexican I was expecting a little kick.  Next time I will try a 1/4 of the butter, 1 egg and 1 egg substitute, and 1/4 of the sugar.  I will add a 1/4 of sour cream (no fat or low fat) as well and use the whole can of chiles.  My 6 year old loved it but I would prefer that bread served with his meals not be that sweet.

This was okay.  I halved the sugar as suggested, and it was still way too sweet.  I will make it one more time and see if eliminating most of the sugar makes any difference.

This cornbread is delicious!  I was making it for a potuck at lunch (my 1st time making cornbread) and it was a HUGE success.
I had to keep my husband away from it!  
Thanks again..next time I will use half the sugar and butter..and more chile peppers.

I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the butter and sugar by half.  I also added a diced jalapeno pepper and a dash of hot sauce.  Still the flavor was mild and sweet.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add more hot sauce and a few jalapenos.  My husband loved it.  Finicky kids didn't care for it.

My Company puts together an employee chili-cookoff for fun. I brought this cornbread as one of the side items. I actually made to recipe to serve 50 people and it turned out beautifully! I think the corn bread (the ENTIRE pan) was gone before the chili. I even received an honorable mention for bringing it. Thanks!! :)

Really easy to prepare, and fast, too!

Based on previous reviews, I only used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup butter.  The texture was perfect and it was still moist and nicely browned.  I like thing a little hotter so will use the full can of drained chiles next time.

Though I very very very rarely make cornbread, this will be the recipe I come back to next time around.  Thanks Judy!

I REALLY enjoyed this recipe. I followed previous suggestions of cutting back on the sugar and butter, and it came out wonderfully. Next time, I might add some jalapenos or jalapeno juice for some added kick (though I did use Monterey Jack cheese with jalap. in it.) My first time making cornbread and this is a definite keeper!

Fantastic! Sweet, moist and servable to any palete. Not spicy, as you would presume by ingredients. Delicious!  I served it to my family and they raved.  Almost a dessert. I can't wait to make it again.

Very yummy! Yes - it may fall apart in your hands - but it's worth it! I used jalapeño jack cheese which added just a bit more flavor.

This is a great tasting and rich cornbread. I had been looking for a recipe after going to a restaurant that served this exact cornbread.  I cut down on a couple of steps by dumping everything together in one bowl which cornbread will allow and it turned out great and beautifully browned on top! The amount of butter scared me at first so I added about a half a cup more each of corn meal and flour and added about 1/3 cup of milk (probably didn't need the milk) and baked it in a cast iron skillet just like at the restaurant.  But beware all of the mix does not fit into a 10" skillet so had to put rest of mix in a smaller skillet and baked for only 30 mins. Looking forward to making it again!!

This is delicious.  I followed others advice and cut the butter in half.  I also questioned the oven temperature.  Tried it at 300 and it came out kind of flat and dense.  Increased it to  350 the next time for 30 minutes and it rose nicely and was perfect.

I had read the other reviews and made it just as written in the recipe; I also found it very oily when hot from the oven... so don’t be surprised.  After cooling the bread became much better.  Since then have added hatch green chili and cut the sugar in half - love it

Some of the best cornbread that I've had or made.  I made it in a 12" cast iron skillet in the oven.  It's very moist and kept well for several days at room temperature in a plastic pie carrier.

Tastes super good. I didnt think I would have such a problem loading my pan to the top. I was very wrong. The USA pan is stupidly nonstick so cleaning was a non issue. 8x pan isn't large enough. That's my fault though.

I made this for our Christmas dinner. It was a huge hit! The cornbread is sweet with a hint of heat, moist, and buttery. My husband is still raving about it.

I didn’t have creamed corn, so used kernel corn. I also added a quarter cup of diced red bell pepper. Absolutely delicious...

I changed it up a little bit.  I cooked it at 385 in a cast iron skillet, used whole kernel corn and a little bit of milk.  also used 1 cup of mexican blend cheese rather than the Monterey jack and cheddar.   I diced up canned jalapenos instead of the chilies.  my boyfriend ate more than I have ever seen him eat.. at first told me it was the best thing i had weve made but then retracted and said it was the best thing he had ever had in his life.  less than an hour after it came out of the oven.. he is in bed in a full blown level 5 food coma.  this is NOT a drill.

- reduce butter to 6 tbsp (from 16)
- added in extra peppers
- topped with jalapeño rings

Best cornbread ever!  I got tons of compliments on this at a potluck and subsequently made it for Thanksgiving instead of buying rolls.  Huge hit - this will be my go-to recipe!  I used 1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter and 3/4 sugar based on reviews and wouldn't change either from there.  I also just use whatever shredded cheese I have on hand (marble jack).

My family and I thought this recipe was too greasy. I made it with 1 c of butter, reduced the sugar to 1/2 c., and used the full can of diced green chiles. It had good flavor, but the consistency was dense. It went well with chili. I will try making it again and reducing the butter to 1/2 c.

Great recipe except for one thing:  use homemade cream corn instead of store bought. What a difference it makes. Grocery store cream corn does not even come close to homemade in taste or smell.

Like other reviewers, i used a half cup of butter instead of a full cup, and I used 3/4 cup of sugar instead of a full cup.  I substituted a 4 oz can of diced jalapenos instead of green chiles, and I used the whole can.  It turned out great.  The bread was sweet, had a moist texture, and it had a nice kick to it with the jalas.

I halved the recipe, used finely chopped red onion instead of peppers (it’s all i had), and baked it for 35 minutes in a pie pan. It was not greasy. I read some other reviews. Is it possible the people who found it greasy measured the butter after melting and not before? I found it to be delicious.

I cut butter to 1/2 cup and sugar to 1/2cup as other suggested and added another can of creamed corn. It was moist and so good. I also added a few more jalapeños from my garden to make spicier. Will make again and again. Loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

Had to leave a review on this because this sounded amazing but some of the reviews were mixed. I really don’t understand the hate because THIS WAS THE MOST AMAZING CORNBREAD EVER. This was everything I’ve ever wanted in a cornbread and omg did it deliver. I followed this recipe to the letter and it came out phenomenally. If you love your cornbread sweet and chunky like I do then this recipe is perfect for you and goes amazingly with chili. My hubby was spooning in with his chili and loved it. I wish it weren’t so crumbly but that’s my only complaint. Fabulous recipe!!!

I'm a born, bred and lifelong southerner and I'm here to tell you that this stuff is the best cornbread ever!

Suggestion to all you folks who change a recipe up then rate it for the rest of us - don't cut down on the ingredients, cut down on your portion size!  I ate only a 1"x1" piece and it was to die for!  If I'd eaten the size recommended, I probably would have died.

Happy I looked at the reviews. 
I cut back a bit on the butter and sugar.  Still very moist. Would prob add the whole can of peppers next time for a bit more kick but overall great recipe. Thanks

This is hands down the best corn bread that I have made and I have tried way too many recipes to count!  It is sweet, with a hint of spicy that makes you want to have more than one serving. It is absolutely delicious and moist, not crumbly like other recipes.
 I added Jalapenos to the mix, instead of green chiles, because I was out of that one ingredient. It came out great and my whole family loved it. This goes well with homemade chili and I am looking forward to making this recipe often when the weather turns cool.

Cornbread does not need sugar. At all.  I made without sugar and it has plenty of flavor. I imagine my grandmother rolling in her grave if I ever added sugar....

Good recipe.  I could tell by the ingredients it was going to turn out gummy and too sweet.  I also could tell there would be no spice making it "Mexican" cornbread.  So made with 6 Tbsp. of butter, approx. 1/4 tsp. red pepper, approx 1/4 cup  mild jalapenos.  It still came out sweet , moist and very little  "heat" so I will probably switch to medium jalapenos next time.

Amazing cornbread!  So moist and tasty.  I make this regularly and guests always go back for more of it!  Stick to the recipe and you can't go wrong.  It's a big hit during Mexican night!

4 Stars with changes -- 1/2 the butter, 1/3 cup sugar. I sautéed chopped red, orange, and green peppers and 2 jalapenos in a small bit of olive oil to add to the mix. I don't know if it changed the taste much, but nice texture and looked pretty. With these changes, I think this was the best cornbread I've ever made. I can't imagine making this with the amount of butter listed (sorry). THANK You to other reviewers for suggesting the changes that made this awesome.

I made some of the recommended changes (e.g., less sugar) and didn't have any creamed corn, so replaced it with frozen corn & a splash of cream. It was a HUGE hit with my family!

Delightful!!! Followed recipe as written but exchanged green chiles with 2 ounces of finely chopped jalapeño peppers. Absolutely perfect recipe when the butter, sugar and eggs are actually properly “creamed”! No need to reduce the butter or the sugar folks....the recipe is perfect and browns nicely. Cornbread was done at 55 minutes and beautifully golden brown around the edge!

The moment I made this I believe 5 years ago I knew it was a hit . I just recently made it for the church they loved it. I made it for my families Sunday Dinner my grandma had two slices. It was so moist and soft. I cut the amount of butter in Half. I omitted spicy peppers and it was delightful thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was fabulous! I made it to go with the King Ranch Chicken Casserole. I regularly make normal cornbread, so this was great for spicing it up for the fam! The kids loved it as is, but I think I could’ve used the whole can of chilis without making it too spicy. Loved it!

Very similar to Moms recipe and good.  One suggestion, add one small jar of pimientos, drained, for color.  I usually add the cream corn and then the milk to see if I need more liquid.  I usually cook mine in a cast iron skillet, help get the bottom crispy.

So good!  I did reduce the butter to 1/2 Cup, and reduced the sugar to 3/4 Cup (still a tad sweeter than I prefer), and used the whole can of chilies.   I cut it into 15 pieces, at 183 calories per piece (based on my changes).

I made this to go with a Mexican meal and everyone loved it.  I cut the butter to 1/2 a cup (one stick) & I think that was perfect.  No other changes & I baked it in my 12 in. cast-iron skillet at 325.  Preheat the oven with the oiled skillet in it before adding batter to hot skillet.  Great recipe & will make again!

Ok, in all honesty, I decided to half the recipe since there are only 2 of us. I halved everything but the sugar, due to a mind fart. Well, my husband said it was the best cornbread he had ever eaten. It was more like cake. I’ll make again!,

Delish!  Used a few substitutions since we did not have a couple of the ingredients... and it still came out great!  Used regular can corn to make cream corn (half the can in the food processor with 2 TBSP of milk) and finely diced  sauteed green bell pepper in place of the chili peppers along with a dash or two of Goya Adobo spice.

I changed it up based on the other reviewer's suggestions. 1/3 cup sugar only.  6 T butter. Add red pepper for color. Jalepenos instead of green chilis. Add onion. Baked at 325, can't remember but think it was about 45 min.  It was definitely just sweet enough, beautiful with the added red peppers, and so yummy. I would've given it 5 stars if it hadn't need so many changes.

Wish I would've read the reviews also. This didn't taste anything like Mexican cornbread! Like sweet pea said it was greasy. I'll be looking for another recipe.

Not very healthy but everyone loved it.   I made 1/2 with green chilis and 1/2 without, and they were both very popular.

This was great! Like some other posters, I used a bit less butter (3/4c) and sugar (3/4c)  and about 1/2 of the peppers .  Will  make it again for sure

I made this for an office Halloween pot luck and it was awesome.  I never use mixes but I was pressed for time so I used Jiffy vegetarian corn bread mix and followed the directions thus omitting the last 4 ingredients, the sugar, and 2 of the eggs.  Following the advice of others, I reduced the butter and only used 1/4 cup which turned out to be plenty.  I used  1/2 of a 4 ounce can of chopped Jalapeno; added chopped red, green and yellow peppers for color and also added about 1/2 chopped onion.  I substituted pepper jack cheese for the cheeses listed in the recipe.  If you don't like spice, I think the original recipe would be perfect  with less butter and sugar.  I will definitely make this again using corn meal and flour instead of a mix.

I've made this cornbread 5 times now! Taken it to cookouts and for family gatherings.  Everyone loved it!  It is moist and tasty.  I used fresh jalapeños instead of canned chilies.  It's a bit sticky to the touch but I prefer moist to dry.  I've given the recipe to several people who loved it too!

This was THE best cornbread I've ever had. I did also cut down on the sugar and butter though. I probably would add more cheese next time for my husband. He's never been a cornbread fan, but I think he would like it more with extra cheese however!

Made 1/2 recipe.  Didn't have  Monterey Jack.  Used double portion of Cheddar.  Added 1/2 small can of Mexican corn.

I'd use a smidge less sugar next time.

As a southerner, I have tried a multitude of cornbread recipes.  I thought I had found my go-to recipe until I found this one.  On my second time of making it, I changed up a couple of things that suited our love of spice.  I replaced the green chilis with fresh jalapeños and added onions and bell pepper.  My husband has stated to several people this is the best cornbread he’s ever had and has requested that I make it for family and friends.  It is incredibly moist.  One point — I have never found the cooking time to be accurate.  It took an additional  15 minutes but so worth waiting for.  Delicious.

I thought this Mexican cornbread was MUCH too sweet!  Although I added about 3 tablespoons of  pickled jalapeños to increase the heat, I feel it could have stood more.  If I use this recipe again, I will definitely reduce the sugar to 1 or less cups.

This was my first time making cornbread. Both my husband and I LOVED this recipe! The only thing I changed based on all the reviews was using 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup. It turned out perfect! I can’t imagine using 1 cup as the original recipe suggested. Thank you for this and we will be making this again!

Before I say anything, I did go back and check the recipe to make sure I did everything right.  And I did.  This was NASTY.  Way too sweet, and didn't get done in the middle before the top was really brown.  It also had very little spiciness, even after adding twice the amount of green chiles.

This is the best recipe for Mexican Cornbread!  If you are skeptical about trying it, don't be!  I couldn't believe the flavor and moistness.  It's addicting!  Everyone raves about it, and I am now the one responsible for bringing it to my once a month meeting.  Please give this a try.  It's a life changing experience!

Although I changed this a tad I still can only give 4 stars. It’s yummy yes. However I cut the butter down by half and it’s still way to much. It’s so sticky I can’t imagine what an entire cup would do. I did add the entire 4 oz can of chilies to it, 4 mini sized peppers, a tad of onion and used jiffy cornbread mix instead of the last 4 ingredients. It’s sweet enough so I eliminated the sugar entirely. I’ll definitely make it again sometime...but I think maybe next time I’ll do what most gals in the south do. Not mix melted butter in your mix..melt it in the bottom of a cast iron skillet before adding the batter to it so the pan is preheated. Maybe even up the temperature some iono. Recipe needs tweaked. Way to much liquid. The extra sauce from

This is not the first time I made this but it is the first time I tried using individual muffin cups. Stick with the plan, i.e. 9x13 pan. Always gets rave reviews from all ages and ethnics. (Except the one aunt who has always prided herself on making the best corn bread.)

Adjusted the butter to half the amount and used 3/4 cup sugar.  Added one can of Mexican corn in addition to the creamed corn.  Perfect and moist.

I have tried many cornbread recipes and this one is my absolute favorite! I sautéed 2 small ears of corn and added a little cream to substitute the can of cream corn, and added 1 cup of cheddar  cheese in place of half cup of each.

I cut the butter and sugar  to 1/2 cup each. Next time i’ll cut  it to 1/3 c. Since it seemed still a bit sweet. Used a 10 in cast-iron skillet preheated in the oven with hot veg oil to get a crunchy crust.  Really good.

I wish I would have made this recipe as written, but I managed to accidentally tweak the recipe by following these steps. 

(1) I forgot to buy green chile peppers so they were not in the final product. 
(2) I used 1 cup of Mexican Blend cheese instead of 1/2 cup Monterey Jack and 1/2 cup Cheddar cheeses (I think any cheese you like works well for this recipe though). 
(3) Which I think is the biggest mistake/happy accident I made: I substituted corn meal for corn flour. I substituted the corn meal and corn flour as a 1:1 ratio. Cooking time did not vary for this substitution. I have not had the recipe as written so I don’t know if there is a texture difference. My cornbread was slightly lighter than your average cornbread. 
(4) I split up the cornbread into two 11”x18” pans. This yielded more (to me) cornbread and about the same baking time as baking in a single 9”x13” pan (about 60 minutes at 300F). 

I would have loved to try the recipe as is before tweaking, but I did enjoy the cornbread as I made it tonight. I’d love to make it again as written next time. With my product, the cornbread was not too sweet or greasy as other reviews have stated.

I did not use the green chiles, and not all of the cheese, but this cornbread was DELICIOUS!  Will definitely make again.  May cut in half and do in a round pan.  Wonderful recipe!

I am shocked that this has such high ratings!  We made it as the recipe designates, but had a mushy pan after 1 hour baking.  To try to save it, we raised the temperature to 350ºF and popped the pan back in for about 12 minutes.  At that point is was then cooked throughout, but was quite crumbly.  The flavor was okay, but we will not make it again.

This cornbread was fantastic. I cut the sugar in half. It’s still plenty sweet for us.  It’s super moist and tasty. I also baked it an additional 3 minutes but that could be a slight temperature difference in your ovens accuracy.

I have used this recipe for years and always get rave reviews....
I make a few personal preference/modifications: I cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup; add a little extra cheese - ok I double it - hey I like cheese; and use 1 and 1/3 cups corn meal for a denser cornbread. I sometimes add a whole drained can of sweet corn (in addition to the cream style corn - for hyped up corn taste). YUMMY!! 
I sometimes bake in a muffin tin and just eyeball when they are done - approx. 1/2hr.
I make this to accompany chilli; brisket; Thanksgiving side-dish; BBQ chicken...

Great base recipe but a little bit too sweet for my taste.  I'll cut back on the sugar and add some stronger cheese and more chilli. My friend loved it.

I made this for a community meeting.  There were several pans of cornbread, but this was eaten first.  It was not as dark as I wanted, but appeared to be done so I put it on broil for a few minutes and you guessed it, it got almost burned.  I scraped all the black stuff off as best as I could.  It was still the favorite cornbread.  This recipe is great!

This cornbread is fantastic! I have made this many times, as it is now a much requested side. The first time I made this, I committed the huge, crucial error of leaving out all of the cheese. Yup. I did that. I was lucky in the end, though, because the cornbread was divine and I haven’t made this with cheese yet. I think I will one day, I just haven’t wanted to mess with a great thing! Oh, and this only takes 50 mins in my oven.

I have had this same recipe for years and I to agree way to much butter!  I made changes years ago and cut the butter in 1/2,  and it's absolutely awesome made this way.  To make it even spicier use a small can of jalapeño peppers instead of green chiles.

Too sweet for my taste. Next time, I will use less sugar, or none at all.  Nice texture though.  I couldn't wait an hour for it too cool, so I increased the temp to 350 and baked for 35 minutes.

Based on other reviews, I cut the butter & sugar in half. I should have halved them again. 
To be fair, though, I also added more cheese than called for. I realize now (too late!) that the cheese creates oil as it melts.
The result was cornbread that didn't rise enough. It's less than two inches in depth, but it does taste good.
I'll keep looking.

I listened to what many reviewers said and cut the butter and sugar by half.  I also added whole 4 oz can of green chilies instead of 2 and used Mexican and pepper jack cheeses.  This cornbread was very moist, but I am from the south and cutting back the sugar made it not sweet enough for my tastes.  I would make again but keep full sugar and only cut the butter to 1/2.

Overall it was a hit at my Xmas office potluck, but for my taste it was a bit too moist. Great flavors, though, and I may try again w/regular canned corn rather than creamed and use less butter. I also reduced the sugar by about half.

I couldn't stop eating it.  I substituted 2 cups self rising corn meal and didn't have Monterey Jack so I just used a full cup of cheddar.  Next time I will add extra cheese, an extra can of chiles and maybe even extra cream corn (just for added flavor and texture).  Very moist

I too lowered sugar to 3/4 C and butter to 1/2 C or 8 T.  We doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving. It was a hit. Had 18 people and there was only 4 squares left over. As I write this I have another batch of this cornbread in the oven.  This time I added minced scallions, a sprinkle of onion powder, and a dash of cayenne per other reviewers so very curious if we'll like these changes. I like to put hot pepper jelly on it. My sister made  Habanero infused honey so we used that at Thanksgiving. Butter is good too but who needs the extra fat. This cornbread is good on its own and also good plopped right on top of your bowl of chili! Enjoy.

This is nice and moist.  I used about 7 tbsp butter and 1/2 c sugar.  I didn't find it to be greasy in the least so next time I might try the amount of butter called for in the original recipe.

This!  It is absolutely the BEST cornbread I've ever made or eaten.  So moist and flavorful.  It is almost like a dessert.  I just used shredded cheddar as I didn't have pepper jack, nor did I have chopped chilies.  It was excellent!  Would be even better with the addition of the pepper jack and chilies, but this was  delicious without as well.

While it was moist, there really wasn't much taste.  Took it to  Thanksgiving dinner and it was not a hit.

Great great cornbread. It's so moist, almost creamy in texture. The added chiles (you'd think it would be hot, nope it's not). and bit of sugar give it an incredible over all flavor. Try it, you'll like it!!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I had to make changes based on ingredients I had.  This recipe is very amenable to change.  I cut the butter and sugar by 1/3 each, I had only kernel corn, and because I couldn't find canned chilies at the store, I used Monterrey Jalapeno Pepper Jack cheese entirely (eliminated the cheddar).  Served this as part of a Mexican meal at our Senior Centre and everyone remarked that this was the most moist cornbread they'd ever had, and so delicious.  I won't be going back to my old recipe.

I loved the taste of this but it was rather greasy from all the butter.  I halved the sugar and next time will halve the butter as well.  I will also use less eggs and the whole 4 oz  can of green chilies.  All in all though, the cheese and chilies give it a wonderful taste.

I saw the 3 star review that said there was too much butter, so I cut it down to 1/4 c and it turned out to be fantastic, but I also altered the recipe quite significantly. Here is what I used: 1 c flour, 1 c corn meal, 4 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 c melted butter, 1/2 c sugar, 3 XL eggs, kernels from one ear of corn,  a 7 oz can salsa verde, 1/8 c diced yellow onion, 1/3 c shredded fiesta cheese,  2 Tbsp milk. I followed the exact same directions as the original recipe, and I greased a 9x13 clear glass dish with ~1-2 Tbsp butter softened to room temp. It turned out amazing, wasn't greasy at all (literally only on the bottom from the greased pan), but perfectly moist. It was the best cornbread I have ever eaten! The reason I used 1/2 c sugar was because that's all I had (and it was plenty sweet, trust me! and I would probably even cut it to 1/3 or 1/4 c next time). I used an ear of corn because I didn't have cream corn, but I had bought fresh corn a few days prior. The salsa verde I'd had in my cupboard for a while and needed to use, and I added the milk because after mixing it all together it looked a little dry.  I will definitely be making my version again!

Just like I remember my grandmothers! I cut the butter down to 3/4 cup and sugar to 2/3 cup. I will be cutting the butter more next time. Also I added red pepper flakes, sliced jalapeño instead of chopped and some white onion. I baked mine per instructions but used a large cast iron skillet. Will definitely be making again!

This cornbread is just ok.  I made it with half the butter and about a 1/3 cup of sugar. It's not bad, but not something I'd rush to make again.

Our family liked it but I followed some of the other cooks advice and cut the butter in half.  I also have a child who does not like corn so I left out the creamed corn but added more cheese and did not drain the chilis. Paired it up with some white bean chili and it was a great meal.

Made this for a group of 20 people while camping. Everyone  LOVED it! Several asked for the recipe. I followed the suggestions of many of the previous reviews and cut the butter and sugar to 1/2 cup each. Cooked in a large cast iron skillet in the oven for 50 minutes in my 5 th wheel oven- perfect.

Love this recipe!  However, I did change a few things.  I used around 1/2-3/4 c of sugar, and it was still too sweet for me.  Next time, I will use 1/4-1/3c of sugar.  I also added a 4.3oz container of plain Greek yogurt because I was out of sour cream.  Being from the south, in my mind cornbread should not be baked in anything other than cast iron skillets, so I baked it in my large skillet at 325 for 45 min.  Will make this again with a few minor tweaks!

THIS IS AMAZING! I did cut the butter and sugar in half, but the rest of the recipe I followed exactly (except I had to use Colby jack cheese; my store didn't have Monterey). This is kind of like a cake. I took it to a church supper and everyone loved it! moist and delicious! WHEN I make it again for home, I'm going to put jalapenos in it!

One of the best recipes ever!!! 
I tweaked it to my own liking and add 2- 4oz cans green chili's drained and 2 cups of cheese(Jalapeno Monterey Jack and Old Cheddar) instead of 1 cup. 
Everyone that tastes it...wants this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

As suggested by others, I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and the sugar to about 3/4 cup.  I also used the whole 4 oz. can of green chiles. Easy and yummy!  Not too sweet or greasy, and just the right amount of kick.

I’ve read that more people have had issues with the recipe being greasy, I did not. I added 5 eggs, not 4. I added 8 fresh jalapeños and 5 ghost chilis in the food processor with the cream corn. I lowered the sugar to 2/3 cup. I also upped the cheese to 1 1/2 cups of fine shredded Mexican cheese. I baked it a little longer for crispiness too. If you like it hot, ??

Really yummy.  The whole family loved it.  I followed the suggestion of  reviewers.  I cut the butter down to 1/2 a cup and the sugar down to 3/4 cup.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Took an hour to cook and it was perfect.

If you are looking for a sweet, dense, slightly savory cornbread, this is it!   After reading thru A LOT of reviews, I ended up using 1/2 cup butter, a rounded half cup of sugar, and the whole 4 ounce can of chilies.  I baked it at 325 for 45 minutes.   We decided that for our taste, the butter quantity was perfect, the sweetness was a little too much (unless accompanying a batch of really hot chili, in which case the extra sweetness would help put out the fire!) and the green chilie was too subdued.  We also decided that the center wasn't quite done enough, even though it passed the toothpick test.  Next time I will decrease the sugar (maybe to 1/3 cup) and kick up the green chilie to 8 ounces.  I will also bake it until the entire pan has a pockmarked, slightly fried look on the top as did the perimeter of the pan I made last night. (The part we thought undercooked was smoother.)  UPDATE:  After making this for a couple of years I have changed a couple of things in the way I make it based on the ingredients I have at hand,   If using canned or frozen corn, I add an extra T of flour and 2 T milk.  If using Bisquick, I use 1 cup + 1 T Bisquick, reduce baking powder to 1 T. and omit salt.

Wow! Just followed the recipe and my beautiful wife was tickled. She said, "This is almost a dessert!" Along with our pintos and greens, this cornbread was a hit. A lot of calories but eating with beans and greens that's ok. Yes, I will make it again. I did bake it in a ceramic 9 x 13 for an hour. Awesome!

This cornbread is awesome! Instead of green chilies, I add jalapenos, half of a sweet onion,  and a dash of my homemade ghost pepper salt. My friends cannot get enough of it!

Good Jiffy-style sweet cornbread but not cheesy, spicy and flavorful likeI expected.  Nice and fluffy, it's almost more a cake than a bread.

Excellentl! I made this with a half cup I butter and about 3/4 of a cup of sugar and I could probably use less of both next time and still have a beautiful dish of cornbread. I will def make again.

Just made this cornbread for a New Years Eve party where we are having Chili.  It came out so good.  I don't really like cornbread and I love this recipe.  I used Self Rising Cornbread but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and after it baked and cooled a little I swiped the top with a little butter.  I highly recommend this Cornbread recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. Like other users suggested, I used only 1/2 cup butter and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. Next time I will use only 1/2 cup sugar since I found it to still be too sweet. Also, I used 1 cup of the pepper jack cheese instead of the 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 monterrey jack. Other than that, recipe came out great and very moist. Gave it 4 stars since I tweeked it a little.

I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the butter and sugar. I reduced both of these by half. Also, I added in the whole can of chile peppers. With these changes, this is a 5 star recipe, but without cutting the sugar and butter it would have been too sweet and greasy.

OK, finally found a moist and delicious recipe for cornbread, thank you Judy. I will definitely make this again and the only change I made was to the cooking method because, hey, it came with the new oven! I baked the cornbread for 45 minutes on steam bake and it came out perfect.

I absolutely love this cornbread!  I left it as it is written except for a couple of additions.  I took 2 jalapeños and roasted them in the oven.  Then I deseeded and chopped them before adding to the wet ingredients.  I also chopped 2 small green onions and added them too.  The results were wonderful.  Everyone loves this recipe and requests it frquently.  Thanks  for this great recipe.  You have spoiled me forever for this yummy cornbread.

If anyone is looking for the Bandera (or Houston's or Rutherford Grill) cornbread clone, this is supposed to be it.  I personally don't think it's the same recipe-- theirs has an incredible craggly crust-- but it's close, and delicious anyway!

I read the other reviews and was tempted to cut the butter and sugar as many suggested. But I'm so glad I didn't. If you want a dryer more traditional cornbread then choose another recipe, don't change this one! If you want a sweet, moist cornbread that is the hit of the party, then choose this one. If you are a fan of spoonbread then you will love this. Similar flavor, but thence enough to cut and hold it's shape.

The recipe does have a little too much butter, so next time I'd definitely use less. It leaves a little grease residue on your hands. However, my entire family LOVED it when I made it for our July 4th party! the only thing I changed about the recipe was that I just added the rest of the can of green chilies (it doesn't make it any spicier, I promise. my family isn't a fan of spicy).

this is my first review. turned out delicious. the first thing that hit me was that it smelled like buttered popcorn. I followed other reviews and used half a cup of butter and 2 tbs less than 3/4 of a cup of sugar. i also used all cheddar and no jalapeños since i didnt have any. it turned out very 'corny' and buttery. very rich and dense. if you are looking for a lighter more bready cornbread this recipe is not it.

I made this last night. Five stars plus. NOW I DID FOLLOW THE MANY REVIEWS THAT SUGGESTED TO HALVE THE BUTTER & SUGAR. A MUST. I added a drained can of corn kernels plus added the full can of chillies. The baking took one hour ten minutes before done with a browned top. Definitely a keeper. BUT HALVE THE BUTTER & SUGAR.

This recipe is the BOMB ! Made it with a couple of changes, I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar. Instead of just creamed style corn I used a can of GLORY Skittle Corn. I live in Florida and don't know if Glory products are available everywhere, I found all of their products  that I have used have that authentic southern touch to them. I have a neighbor who was born in Georgia and is an excellent cook we took a slab of the corn bread to her and she RAVED about it and wanted the recipe. This will become a staple in my household when the hankering for some southern comfort food arises.

I completely agree with the other reviews that said the recipe should be tweaked by cutting butter by half and cutting sugar to 3/4 cup.  I would just go ahead and use the whole can of chiles too.  I'd have given this a higher rating had it not been soooooo sweet and greasy!

I wish I had more stars to give for this cornbread. I made it to go with chicken enchiladas and it was amazing. My husband said it's the best cornbread he's had in his entire life, and didn't want me to send any of the leftover home with our dinner guests!

I'm not a cornbread person but my family absolutely loves this recipe! And it freezes really well- I always keep a few small pans in the freezer.

I tried this recipe tonight.  Based on previous comments, I used only half the butter and about 3/4 cup of sugar.    It turned out great!  The diced green chilies I used were mild, which made my husband like it all the more. I would have preferred a bit of a "kick" but the flavor was good without it.  I'll make it again.

The high rating really misled me. I didn't have time to read the reviews to see how people adapted this recipe to make it a 4 1/2 star rating. I didn't have all the butter, so I cut back on it a little. I had to double the recipe for a dinner we were going to. After baking an hour, it was a soupy mess. After another 45 minutes it was better but sitting in grease. My husband tasted it and said that it had really good flavor as his hands were covered in butter.I had to come up with something at the last minute. Very disappointing.

Good Mexican cornbread. I used half the sugar and I'm glad I did. Next time I'll use half the butter. As it was, it was moist and had just the right amount of heat.

I used white cornmeal because I didn't have yellow.
I also forgot to drain the chiles.
Neither change seemed to change the turnout...Delicious!

Based on the comments I made some changes. I cut the butter and sugar in half. I also used fresh jalapeño peppers instead of canned chillies. It was delicious. Will definitely be making this again.

This recipe got mixed reviews in our family. In the end the left overs weren't eaten though and we found that because it was so moist it spoiled really fast.

I have never made cornbread and this recipe looked easy. It was excellent. The next batch, I will lighten the butter, add sliced jalapenos,and a dash of some hot sauce!

Thank you poster for the recipe.

I made the same mistake as a few others and made this cornbread without reading the other reviews. I thought a cup of butter sounded like a lot, but ignored my suspicions and followed the recipe. Well, it is good, but you can taste the butter. I don't imagine that is the intent. It is also very greasy as the other negative/mediocre reviews claim. Now I know to check the reviews the next time I decide to go with a recipe.

Like some other folks, I cut back on the butter. Following this recipe and calling it six servings in a 9x13 pan... one would want to make their peace with their deity before packing in all that butter on top of the cheese, just to be on the safe side. I cut the butter and sugar by half (and even then it was still a little sweet) but doubled the jalapenos. It was fantastic.

This was fantastic.  I used no butter.  I used buttermilk instead and cut the sugar to a couple of tablespoons.  I also used a measure for measure Gluten Free Flour (1Cup) and it came out perfect.  Cooking time was the same and I used a pre-heated cast iron skillet in the oven.   Being a guy I also put bacon pieces in it (highly recommend this!).  It was awesome!

Thanks for the recipe it reminded me of home in Louisiana,

Roger

Best cornbread recipe I've ever had after I made a few minor mods. As mentioned in other reviews, cut down the butter and sugar by half. I also used a 7oz can of diced green chiles instead of a 4oz can. Other than that, I made it as posted and it was incredible!

I agree, this is a little greasy, but it is still the BEST Corn Bread I have ever made.  Loved the flavor, and it is moist.  So often, if you read the recipe on the side of a corn meal box (which I have), it often comes out dry.  I will downsize on the butter next time, but I did find the flavor terrific.  This will be my "go to" recipe for Corn Bread!!

This was excellent cornbread. As per many other reviewers, I halved the butter and sugar and it was plenty without leaving the cornbread really greasy. My daughter-in-law says this recipe is a keeper; the best cornbread she has ever had!

This was by far the best cornbread recipe I have ever made. I just used plain cheddar cheese, added a bunch of sliced spring onions and instead of a can of chilles I added 4 red serano chillis finely sliced. left overs were amazing used as a stuffing base for chicken. I have had so many requests for the recipe. I will never try another. thanks for posting it.

Use half the butter! Trust me. I'm a butter lover and this recipe calls for way too much butter. Also, I add roasted, coarsely chopped peppers. This recipe is fabulous! I'm only on here today because I have to print this recipe for about the 20th time.

Great recipe, especially With the burrito pie recipe on this site.  I used 6 tbsp. butter and 1/3 cup sugar.  Definitely good on the sugar, but next time I might try 2-3 tablespoons more of butter.  Wouldn't use the full amount of sugar or butter like the recipe states, though.
Thanks so much for the recipe!

I tried making these into mini muffins...the oven temp of 300 left them too crusty on the outside, yet still a bit undone on the inside. They also did not raise up...looked kinda like hockey pucs. I doubled the baking powder and baked at 375 and things were much better.  I greased and floured the tins, but they were still a bit difficult to get out of the pan. Even though I reduced the butter and omitted the cheese they were still greasy.  3/4 cup sugar was good though.

Love, love, love this recipe!  Used it to make mini muffins for a party I was hosting, one batch of batter makes 72 mini muffins.  I usually add the full can of green chiles and it gives them a little extra kick!

Huge hit, super moist and everyone loved it, even my extremely picky boyfriend.  I added a little shredded cheese on top right before it came out and it gave it nice texture.

I made the recipe as is only cut it in half. Instead of cooking it in the oven though I used our waffle stick maker and they turned out fantastic! It also cut the cooking time down considerably!  I'll make this again!

OMG - I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars!  As always, I read the other reviews before making this and decided not to change the amount of the butter and sugar this time but next time will probably cut the amount of butter and sugar.  I didn't have cream corn so I substituted a 12-oz bag of frozen corn and about 1/2 cup fat-free half & half.  I used the juice from the chilies and a 4-cheese Mexican blend.  This went so well with chili - my only complaint was that I ate so much corn bread, I couldn't finish my chili!  Next time I'm going to add some diced jalapenos to give it a little more kick.

Thanks to all the reviewers who suggested halving the butter. I left out the sugar completely, added finely chopped smoked ham & sun-dried tomatoes & a little finely grated pecorino & it tastes wonderful! I had about four pieces to "taste test" it! Thanks for the recipe. Will definitely make this again.

Really a fantastic addition to chilli, etc. I did as others did and halved the butter and 3/4 c sugar. Just the right amount of sweet and salty. Recvd lots of compliments from those who like peppers/spicier foods
...not that this is in the least spicy. Great recipe!!

I've been making this recipe for the past year and my whole family loves it. The only suggestion I would give is to cut down on the butter.
Give it a try and it will become a regular in your family gatherings :)

This really is THE best cornbread I've ever tried. Very simple to make and it is SO moist. I didn't have any green chile peppers so I used chopped jalapenos instead and it was great. The kids didn't even complain or inquire about "the little green pieces" in the bread!!

This is a great Mexican corn bread recipe!  I guess I don't share the opinion that it has too much butter ... I thought the butter content made it moist on the inside and helped to form a crisp crust on the outside.  I didn't have the green chili peppers or creamed corn on hand so I subbed 1 can Mexican corn and 1 can of diced tomatoes and peppers (Rotel).  It turned out really great.  I will definitely make this again.

I was in a hurry, so I made this without reading the reviews first.  I would definitely make this again, but next time I will cut the butter in half and reduce the sugar some.  My family doesn't like spicy food, so I did not add the chiles; however, I did add some diced green and red pepper.  

I also cooked it in a cast-iron skillet.  I heated the skillet for about 20 minutes at 450 degrees, took it out, poured in the batter, reduced the temp to 300, and put the skillet back in the oven.  This gives the cornbread a nice crispy crust.  Cooked for about 50 minutes.

Very good!  I halved the butter as some other reviewers suggested.  My only complaint is that you cannot taste the cheese.  Oh and I halved the sugar as well.

Does NOT need 2 sticks of butter - 1 is sufficient.  Used full 4 oz can chilies and only 3/4 cup sugar (may cut back to 1/2 next time).  Very moist and family liked it a lot.

I loved this recipe! I've made it 3 times.  I used jalopanos instead of green chiles.  I also cut down on the sugar (i only used 3/4C) and butter (i only used 3/4C) as it was originally a bit too sweet and greasy.  After making those simple changes the cornbread was PERFECT.  :)

My granddaughter is married to a Latin gentleman who loves authentic Mexican food; he raves about this recipe.  Every time we have a family gathering, he asks me to make this cornbread, and, if there are leftovers, he always takes them home with him.  I felt that 1 cup of butter was unnecessary, so I cut it in half, and the bread is still tender and moist.  I generally use the Kraft Mexican Cheddar Jack shredded cheese so I don't have to buy two different cheeses, but any blend of Mexican cheese works equally well as a replacement for the Cheddar and Monterey Jack. This recipe made it into my "lifetime favorites" recipe book, because it is so popular with my family.

Ok, this IS the BEST cornbread. My entire family always asks for this when we have any beans, peas, soups, chili, etc.... I did omit the chili peppers and used canned jalepanos from our garden. I slice them up pretty thin, about 1/4 cup (they are hot). Also, I use a Wilton Mini-Loaf pan to bake them in. (9 individual servings of the cornbread for each pan) I usually fill two pans with this recipe.

Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed! Such a croud pleaser at social gatherings too!

Too sweet.  The sugar overpowered the flavor of the cheese and chiles.  I would reccommened cutting the sugar to a couple of tablespoons.  I would also reduce the butter to a 1/2 cup.

I've made this a few times to go with chili, of course.  It makes enough to serve a large group and I'm always surprised at how high it rises up given the number of 'dense' ingredients that could bring it down.  I follow the recipe exactly and all my guests have loved it.  Nobody has complained of greasiness and they all commented on how moist and flavorful it was.  It is sweet, as others have said, and that actually ends up being a nice counterpoint to the spiciness of the chili (I make it Hot) and provides a bit of a cooling element. If you are looking for a more savory bread, you would need to make a few adjustments to satisfy your heat level.  But when so many of my friends and guests, with so many different taste preferences, all say it's a winner then the recipe must be doing something right.

This was very good.  I was skeptical after reading other reviews and was worried there would be too much sugar and butter.  I made it as written (except used jalapenos instead of chilies) and I thought it was great.  Deliciously sweet cornbread that went great with out chili.

I get rave reviews every time I make this! I like to make this batter and bake it in mini muffin tine for a nice bite sized appetizer to serve at parties. As written it is 5 stars, but to kick it up to 5+ stars I like to add about 1/2 c thawed frozen corn kernels (amazing to bite into), and chopped/seeded fresh jalepenos in place of the canned peppers. Try this recipe!

The best cornbread I have ever made - we double the recipe and freeze it.  We followed the recipe and changed nothing.

Excellent.  The only way I changed the recipe is by adding one 15-ounce can of whole kernel corn as well as the creamed corn.  This recipe is fantastic.

I didn't have the butter so I used a half cup of margerine and 3/4 cup of sugar because of some of the reviews. It was fantastic,I will have to make this exactly as it calls for in the recipe next time as I can handle to sweet and greasy. I will be playing with this recipe for quite some time!. This rivals banana bread, bread pudding, pound cake, and it gets really close to butter tarts. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

Delicious! I could only give it 4 because I followed recommendations of using 6 tbs of butter & 1/3 c. sugar. I plan on making this again.

4 star based on my changes.  After reading some of the reviews first, I also decreased the butter to 1/2 cup, and sugar to 1/2 cup.  It could be just a little sweeter, so maybe next time put more sugar.

I tried several highly-rated cornbread recipes on this site and did a taste test at our chile cookoff.  This cornbread was rated tops by everyone.  It was also the best the next day as it did not dry out.

When making this read some of the comments below. You can really cut down on the butter and some of the other fatty items to make this much healthy AND it actually cooks up better that way. I always make it with "Cowboy Chicken" which is on this site and pour the salsa from the chicken on top of it...Sooooo Good!

This cornbread was SO good, but it was super sweet and I could only eat it in a very small portion, almost like cake. Next time I'm going to put half the sugar as it was a lot. I took the others advice and added half the butter but it was still too much so I'll add less next time

Litterally the best corn bread I've ever had... Omitted chile peppers as personal preference but other than that changed nothing... VERY fattening, but worth it every once in awhile.  Thanks for the post!

This recipe was ok. I followed the recipe, and it was waay too sweet. Next time I make this, I am going to try to reduce the sugar and butter as suggested. I think it was a good base recipe, but needs some adjustments.

Almost dessert like - very good! Followed the instructions exactly.  The only thing I might change for next time is to add a sprinkling of jalapenos to give it some heat.

I love cornbread, and this recipe after the modifications I made thanks to other reviewers was really good. I cut the butter back to 6 tablespoons and possibly it could have even been cut back more. I also added the whole 4 ounce can of chili's. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  This was a new take on the traditional and I think it will be awesome with some chili.

This recipe is awesome as is, however i used a 1/4 cup less butter, 1/3cup less flour, and 1/4 cup more cheese...and I used 3 whole jalapenos roughly chopped w/seeds...immediately out of oven I drizzled about 2 tablespoons of honey over the whole dish. Anyone who eats this will rave! Went to chili cook-off, brought a pan of this as a side....Never in my life have I seen an entire batch of cornbread get eaten..there's alway some left over.....DONT BE LAZY AND USE JIFFY MIX!!

Best cornbread we've made! Used 2 cans green chilis. Used Splenda instead of white sugar. Used 1/4 habenero cheddar instead of Monterey Jack. Great recipe, we'll be keeping this one handy!

FANTASTIC!!  I did what some suggested and used 9 TBS butter and 3/4 cups sugar.  I stice fresh peppers and put on top before baking.  I wish I had put more on there as it really enhanced the flavors and gave it just the right kick.  I might of put a little more cheese cus we love cheese.  I made this with black eyed pea gumbo from this site...OUTSTANDING!

This corn bread is outstanding.  Did however only use half the butter called for as other reviewers suggested, and used the whole can of green chiles. Will definately be making this again soon.

As suggested, I cut the butter in half and used 3/4 cup of sugar instead.  The cornbread was still sweet and you could smell the chilies.  The texture was a little too chewy for me and it was also too sticky imo.

I am eating my first piece now- This is great! If you like Jiffy corn bread mix, you will love this! I have never liked homeade corn bread till now! I did 1/2 the butter, and only used 3/4 cup sugar. I also substituted jalepenoes for the green chilis. Gave it some heat with the sweet. Just a personal preference...

My whole family LOVED this cornbread. I didn't have it in there for quite an hour, probably due to the mix I used, it only took about 30 minutes. Regardless, it was a wonderful recipe and I intend to use it again!

I give the recipe five stars as it is really good bread. It is very moist and is really good with Taco soup. I will make modifications next time I cook it as my husband found it to be too sweet. I will add more peppers/spices and kick it up a notch as we like it spicy.

I would highly suggest you cut the butter in half.  It will still come out moist. I have made this recipe following the instructions and "playing" with it.  If you use the full amount of butter suggested, it can be intense.  I also omit the corn and substitute 1 cup of salsa.  The sugar helps to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  Have fun...

This recipe is sooo good!  I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was absolutely delicious.  It makes a quite a large pan but will not go to waste.  It was so good I even had some of the leftovers for breakfast with a cup of coffee.

I modified this a little and it turned out great and very easy.  I used 2 boxes of Jiffy corn muffin mix, one can green chili's, one can creamed corn, and one cup chedder cheese.  Baked according to the box directions...YumO!  Other reviews mentioned adding more corn...I think that I will try that next time...maybe half can of whole kernel. THANKS!

I just finished making this delicious mexican cornbread.  After reading the reviews, I did use 6 T of butter and 
1/2 c. sugar.  I will definitely make this again!!  Happy Holidays to everyone.

My family really liked this recipe (made as directed). It went great with the chili I made. I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews (too sweet, too greasy), but it wasn't over the top for either. We'll definitely have it again.

I adapted this excellent recipe by only using 1 stick of melted butter, 3/4 cup of sugar and adding the entire 4 oz. can of diced jalepenos.
Very moist,tasty and plenty sweet.

This recipe was okay. Not like my grandmother's and that is what I was looking for. I also tried to fry the batter in patties and that didn't come out too well. More like very thin pancakes. Next time, I will make as the recipe states.

Well, I must say that this is the most DELICIOUS cornbread recipe I have ever tried!  The only thing I did differently was to use a tad less sugar, and next time I will use a little more of the peppers, but from now when I want a rich and satisfying cornbread for a treat, this is now my go-to recipe.

This was great!  I tweaked a little for my own tastes - cut butter and sugar down to 3/4 cup and added the whole can of chilies.  It was still very sweet for us, so I'll cut down a little more and add at least another 1/2 can of chilies.  This will definately be my base recipe for Mexican Cornbread!

My husband and I absolutely loved this cornbread.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. It was very moist and flavorful.  My three daughters didn't seem too fond of it for some reason though.

This is the best cornbread recipe period.  Just use 3/4 C butter and 3/4 C sugar and it's awesome.  Not boring and stays moist.  Made is for the 4th of July barbeque and everyone commented on it and went back for more.  I'll use this one forever! Very easy and quick too.

Delicious!  I cut back on the sugar (1/2 cup) based on comments, however I thought it needed to be alittle sweeter and I would try 1 cup next time.  I also used all of the 4oz. can of green chiles and it was fine.

This was a very heavy, dense cornbread, but it was good.  I cut back on the butter to 1/2 cup and the sugar to 3/4 cup based on other reviews, and I kind of regret both of those decisions.  I feel it could have used that extra bit of sweetness, and maybe 3/4 cup of butter instead of 1 cup.  It was really yummy though and a nice complement to a Mexican casserole. Can't complain. :)

What a great recipe!  I made a few changes based on other reviewers suggestions.  I only used 1/2 stick of butter, 1/3 cup of sugar and a whole can of chiles.  Also, I didn't have any baking powder so I used self rising flour instead.  The end result was fabulous.

This cornnbread was the perfect addition to our taco soup. I cut back on the sugar, and used only cheddar cheese(didn't have monterey jack). The bread tasted great! I love a moist cornbread. My daughter, who normally wouldn't touch anything with green chiles, ate two pieces! Thanks for sharing.

I used half the butter, half the sugar, and pepper jack cheese... so good!
I'd use the whole can of chiles next time, and I think I'll add cayenne as well, even with the pepper jack.

I just tried it with whole wheat flour instead of white and it was also fantastic!  added some pimentos for color too.

There's only two of us so I cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8x8" casserole.  I did use the whole can of creamed corn and the whole can of chilis, not drained.  I just hate having half of anything hanging around.  I got down to putting the cornmeal in and found I didn't have any but I did have a box of Jif so I omitted the last 3 ingredients (I had already put the flour in the same bowl to save dishes).  It turned out wonderfully!  Very, very moist with a good flavor.

Mmmm.  I've been wanting to try this recipe for years and finally did.  I cut the sugar and butter in half and added the whole can of chiles.  It would have been way to much butter if I didn't.  This was really good.

It was great! I used pepper jack instead of cheddar and jack cheese. Next time I might not even add the peppers because the pieces that had less peppers were great with just the peppers in the pepper jack cheese. I also cut my butter down to 1/2 cup (1 stick) and the baking powder to 2 tsp, I also used 1/3 cup of sugar. It was great!

I followed the recommendations to halve the butter and reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup- so glad I did! With these adjustments this is a good basic sweet cornbread recipe, but it wasn't hot at all. That might be my fault, I used Original Ro-Tel tomatoes instead of the peppers called for; not sure which would actually be hotter. It could also have used more texture.

Next time I will add a can of whole kernel corn, drained, and a whole can of Ro-Tel and see where that gets me. All in all, a solid recipe for building on!

This recipe was really excellent!  I did, of course, make a few changes.
*Reduced butter to 6 Tbsp as suggested by other.
*Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup.
*Added some extra diced jalapenos (i like things extra spicy, and regular green chiles need a little something extra).
*Used a pepper jack/cheddar pre shredded combo cheese I had on hand.
Also keep a close eye on the cook time.  Even at 300, mine was done in closer to 45 mins.
With these changes it was still great.... next time I will probably use half the baking powder as well though, as mine came out with a little bit overwhelming taste of it.

I love this recipe. It is always a big hit! I bake it in a cast iron dutch oven and serve it with a spoon. It stays even more moist that way.

THIS RECIPE ROCKS!!!! I followed recipe but cut back to 1/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup butter, as per other reviews.  OH MY GOODNESS!!
Hubby who hates ANYTHING spicy, LOVED this, and so did I. Still a bit sweet, so maybe next time, I will cut back sugar some more, but other than that, all I can say is THANK YOU and we LOVED this with white chili II from this site.

I read many reviews and combined with Mexican style cornbread and Grandmother's buttermilk cornbread recipes, came up my own. This is what I changed: I used 2 Tbp butter, 3 Tbp coconut oil, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup of butter milk, 2 Tbp stir-fried pepper and cilantro, 1 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese replacing two cheeses, I baked at 350 degrees F for 1 hour. It was very delicious. Thank you for the recipe and the reviews.

Deeelicious.  Definately cut the butter in half at least, and do the same with the sugar.  I also substituted jalpenos for chiles.

Not what I was looking for.  I cut the oil and sugar in half and it was still too sweet for me.  It wasn't spicey enough.  I thought it could use more corn meal and less flour.  It was easy to make though and it did look nice.  I won't make it again though.

Cutting the sugar and butter are essential.  Thanks for that.  Also used the jiffy, thanks for that too. Made this with tortilla soup for a holiday dinner and everyone loved it.

This is such a great recipe.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  I cut the recipe in half, because I am the only one in the house who likes cornbread.  I baked it in a cast iron pan for about 45 minutes.

This super rich cornbread is the perfect thing to bring to a potluck or a party. I'm almost sick of making this cornbread since it gets requested so much but can't blame anyone for loving this cornbread.

I'm used to the corn bread muffin mix that is .39 cents a box, takes all of 5 minutes of work to prepare and are quite tasty.  This recipe required much more work and it was tasty but I don't know if it was worth all the extra effort.  Maybe next time I'll use the hot chili's instead of the mild for some more kick!  Overall it was yummy.

Awesome.  I use half of the butter that is called for.  It is less greasy and better for you if you do this.

Very yummy and easy to make. I did use a little less butter and sugar as suggested. Goes great with the recipe called cabbage soup (tastes like chili). 
Definite keeper!

This was very good. I cut the recipe in half and put it in an 8x8 pan for approx. 40 mins. The green chili's weren't hot, just added flavor.  So if you wanted more heat, I suppose you could add jalapenos.  I liked the idea of using corn in the recipe...definitely a bonus.

I made this for a chilli cook off w/ Rick's award winning chilli based on the suggestion on another reviewer.  Thank you, thank you, thank you what a hit.  This was the best cornbread I ever had and a followed the receipe to a T.  This is going in my recipe box and all other cornbreads will be removed!

This is the absolute and the only cornbread from now on.......everyone just raved about it. I followed the recipe to the T and it was just fabulous. Loved the flavors of the cheeses and the green chilies, I did use the whole can. I might cut back on the sugar next time. Made this with Boilermakers Tailgate Chili from this site for a party and it was a hit. Thanks!

There were a couple of reviews saying this was blander than would have liked, and we like spicy food, so added the whole can of chilies Plus 1/2 tsp of ground cumin and 1/4 tsp each of red cayenne and black pepper. Wonderful cornbread, other than those changes made exactly as recipe called for!! Would definitely make again!

This recipe is incredible!  I have made this probably 4 or 5 times now.  Anytime I make chili, this is right along side it.  My wife said she doesn't like cornbread. I found out it's because she only had boxed cornbread...no wonder!  She's addicted to this stuff though, and there's no way I'd get by with making chili without this.  I make this recipe exactly as described and make zero changes/substitutes and it turns out perfect everytime. Enjoy!

This is the best corn bread I have ever had.  After making it once I may tweak it with either a bigger can of chiles or maybe spicier ones.  I'm not a big fan of corn bread, but I won't try to find another one after this.

I love this recipe! It is very decadent and always rewarding. The only down side is that I eat way too much! I usually make it without the green chile peppers, and I use whatever kind of cheese I have handy at the time.

I used one stick plus 5 T. of butter, and extra cheese (plus I put some cheddar on top for the last ten minutes). 1/2 cup of sugar was plenty.  I used an entire 4-ounce can of green chiles and  chopped up half a small can of jalapeños and added it to the batter to spice it up a bit.  Really, really good!  Because of the sugar and the moistness, it molds/mildews within a few days, so be sure to eat it quickly or refrigerate it.

This was just okay.  I used the entire can of green chiles and still could barely taste them in the finished bread.  DH also didn't care for there being actual corn in his cornbread. I guess I'll just continue my quest for the perfect cornbread.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe and like most everyone else I changed a few things. I didnt have any can peppers so I used fresh, I used 5   chili peppers and 2 jalepeno  peppers. This was an awesome cornbread. I liked the butter and sugar just the way the recipe was wrote. The next time I will add one more jalepeno. It was not to hot yet it did have a warm taste that was just right and tasteful.

My husband and I agree this is the best cornbread we've ever had.  I cut the butter and sugar in half and cooked it in the oven in a 10" square cast iron pan.  One hour was perfect.

Muy, Muy Bueno!  Wonderful!  I didn't have any chiles on hand, so I left those out.  And I changed the cheeses to just 1 cup of the Sargento Chipotle Cheddar cheese.  Just the right amount of spice & sweet! Absolutely the best Mexican cornbread I have had!  Will definitely feed more than 6 as stated too.

Really good, though the sheer fat content of this recipe will prevent me from making this more than once in a while. I'm sure you could cheat this recipe with half the butter and maybe some light cheddar etc. without any negative effects. Good recipe overall.

This is a very good recipe.  I have made it twice.  The 2nd time I made it I cut the sugar in half and added extra cheese.  It is not spicy at all so next time I will add diced jalapenos and diced onions.  I will definitely make this again!!

Really good - REALLY good, but definitely more of a corn"cake" than a cornbread.  I upped the green chiles to the entire 4 oz can and decreased the butter to 1/2 cup.  I can't even think of how greasy this would have been if using the entire amount of butter.  Served it with some ribs and potato salad and it was very well received.  Thanks!

I cooked this for a couples wedding shower along with other dishes and this was far and beyond the favorite.  Some of the guests rated it above a local tex-mex restraurant.  Several calls asking for the recipe resulted the next week!  Wonderful taste and texture!

This is SOOO good! My fiance loves it so much, I wonder if he's just marrying me for my cornbread! :-) I adjust the amount of sugar and sweetness depending upon the main dish I have fixed. When I want a more traditional cornbread, I leave out the chiles and use all cheddar chese.

Because of the reviews I put only 1 stick of butter and only 2/3 cup sugar. I only had cheddar cheese so I put 1 cup. Cooked it for 1 hour. It was not sweet at all with the 2/3 cup and overall I would rate it as OK but not special. But to be fair I want to make it again exactly as the recipe is and see if its better that way.

this is by far the best cornbread I've ever had! I agree it's more of a cornbread/mexican corn cake. the recipe is fantastic with just the butter halved (the cheese has enough grease!) but i also just add the whole can of chilis in. It doesn't taste any different and you don't have leftover chilis. I also add more cheese and reduce the sugar just a bit.

My husband and I make this cornbread all the time. We like to add spicy sausage and ground beef for an extra kick. Everyone we make it for always begs for more.

Loved this and would make it again if cornbread was needed anywhere.  I did cut the sugar to 1/2c as some of the previous reviews called for.

This is a fantastic recipe and was a big hit at the pot luck I took it to. Several people went up for seconds until the pan was left empty. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I slightly altered the original recipe to use 3/4 cup butter, 3/4 cup honey and a full can of jalapenos.

Absolutely delicious!  Made this two days before Thanksgiving (half the butter as suggested) and on Thanksgiving day it was still moist and super delicious!  People even took seconds of it which was impressive since we had so much food!!  Also got compliments!

I've had a few different types of typical corn bread and this is by far the best, most moist corn bread ever.  Once, didn't have green chilis available, so tried jalepenos *chopped small* and I had some rave reviews with that too.
SOO yummy.. not too sweet, rich and flavourful.  An absolute must for bringing to a pot luck supper for friends!

this is the absolute best cornbread I've ever had(and I'm from the south where cornbread is a common dish)!!
I didn't have green chilis on hand so I omitted it which is also a great dish if you want a sweet cornbread with no kick.

Made this quite a while ago now, but never did review it.  This was AWESOME.  Made it for a group of friends, many of who have never liked cornbread before.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  My husband and I like spicy though, so we added a lot more heat with some hot sauce and quite a bit of jalepeno.

Great recipe! I didn't have the green chillies, so I used a little cyanne instead. Also, I didn't have tge monteray jack cheese, so I increased the cheddar to 1 cup. Wonderful! :)

This was moist and sweet and yummy. If I was serving it to someone, though, I would call it "corn cake" not "cornbread." I think I'll add the whole can of diced green chilis next time.

I cut the sugar in half, but not the butter. What a mistake. It was like an oily cake. I couldnt get over the oily/spongey texture enough to taste any of the flavours- just ended up throwing it all away. I dont wanna give this any more than 3 stars because really those little modifications make a huge difference. I didnt like the texture for cornbread anyways.

Really good, not quite what I was looking for, but nevertheless, it was still very good.  I would have liked it a little more spicy, but I can fix that.  Also, I might cut down on the sugar a little, the cream corn makes it sweet enough.  Everybody that tried it loved it.  I like that it was moist and not dry.  Thanks.

this bread turned out to be somewhat heavy with lots of fat in it, but with hot peppers, it was really delicious!!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and I added the whole can of green chilis. Other than that I followed the recipe as written.

I used half of the butter and eggs.  Had Jiffy cornbread mix in a box so we used that.  We like sweet cornbread but this was a little too sweet.  I would use less sugar next time.

This was an EXCELLENT recipe.  I loved how moist the cornbread was.  The only critique is that I didn't like the chilis.  I left them out and the cornbread was still great and everyone loved it.

Excellent...very pleased with the end results.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added the entire 4 oz. of chopped green chilies since I had no other use for it.  My family and friends loved it!  This recipe is now a part of our family.  Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent!  It's a bit sweet, so the green chiles really add a nice contrast.  My whole family loved it!  It's great with chili, too.  Thanks for the post!

I really wish I had enjoyed this recipe, but I didn't think the cornbread was that exciting. I followed the directions exactly, except I put a little less sugar in, but I didn't see anything special about it. The peppers in the bread gave it an interesting flavor, but that's about all I can say. I may try it again with a few modifications. Anyway, thanks for the recipe!

Wow, where did I go wrong?? This was tasty, but the texture was more like a dense corn pudding. It turned a light golden brown, but didn't look like bread. I reviewed the recipe and I don't think I messed up any of the measurements, so I can't quite figure this out. Won't try again.

My husband thinks this is the best thing I have ever baked.  The sweetness really cuts the heat with any chili or Mexican dish.  I brought it to a potluck at our church's chile cookoff and everyone who tried it wanted the recipe.  I was glad to share.

I made this bread for a Mexican-themed party, and it was a huge hit!  I used the whole can of green chiles, and the bread still turned out great.  Delicious with a nice kick to it.

Very good.  I used Splenda instead of sugar but next time I will cut down even more on the sweetness.  Just a little too sweet for us.  I had to leave out the green chile peppers because I did not think the kids would eat them but next time I am going to leave them in and see what happens.  Made with pollo fajitas from this site.  Thanks Judy

Tried this over the weekend to go with bean soup.  It is terrific!  As with the other raters, I will also try it next time with 1/2 cup of sugar.  But it is great just the way it is!  Just enough peppers to give it a great flavor.

I made this delicious cornbread to go with my chili cookoff at my local club.  Everyone raved.  As with others, I cut back on sugar to 1/2 cup
and parkay (use all the time) to 3/4 cup. Wonderful!!

This recipe is very sweet with a little kick to it. We loved it and so did our guests. I replaced the last 4 ingredients with 2 corn muffin mixes.

This was awesome!  So moist and great flavor.  I believe I cut the butter back a little bit because it seemed like a lot of butter but other than that everyone loved this at my mexican party!

This recipe was great , however I added 4 mixed peppers and 6 jalapenos. It really kicked it up a level.

Not bad but too sweet to suit me. I will make it again and cut the sugar by half.

AWESOME!!!! I see more cornmeal on my shopping list. If you like a little kick, try adding chopped jalapenos, or other hot pepper to the mix. ENJOY!!!

I too, changed the amount of butter by half, and may cut it further when I make it again, but it was FANTASTIC!  A big hit.  Thanks.

With some of the recommended changes (3 eggs, 1/2 the sugar and butter) I think this would be a five star recipe. Came out a bit like a corn casserole and a tad sweet but still delicious! BTW, this makes way more than six servings.

EXCELLENT! For the sake of time, I used a pre-made cornbread mix, and then added in the cheese and jalapenos.... very very good. I garnished with a sliced jalapeno on top. Very cute and tasty! I may never go back to plain old cornbread.

Below is my original review of this recipe.  I made it again a couple days ago and again it was wonderful.  Only problem for me is the amount of butter & sugar makes me feel guilty, so I am going to follow others directions and cut the butter and sugar in half.  This bread is WONDERFUL the second day.  By the way...I used fine ground cornmeal the first time and now I use coarse ground for a nuttier flavor.  

WOW!!  I loved this.  Made it for my Cinco de Mayo Party this year.  Lots of recipe requests.  Not a crumb left.  I eliminated the peppers because we had lots of young ones here, but it didn't hurt it at all.  Still flavorful. Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

Sweet!  Goes well with hot chili.  My camping buddies made it a rule that I have to make this any time we go camping.  (I made the batter, then cooked it in a Dutch oven when dinner time came.)

True to word it is for sure moist.  I thought I might have done something wrong.  My husband is not a cornbread man but he ate this up like there was no tommorrow.  I accidently forgot the green chili but i think it tasted great no matter.  Only thing is, it tasted a bit bitter the next day.  Will make again.

Instead of following of the advices of the other reviewers, I only halved the amount of butter and not the sugar because my family likes it sweet.  I also use 3-4 fresh chiles and 1 cup of cheddar cheese instead.  This recipes is a keeper.

i made this for a vegan potluck that i went to (everyone was vegan, except myself).  
i used egg substitutes (1tbsp. water + 1 tbsp. cornstarch and a dash or baking soda per egg),
i also used vegan margarine and vegan soy cheese.  but it was still amazing! it was
a big hit! i can't wait to make it with real cheese, butter and eggs!! 
(i halved the sugar and butter, like everyone suggested)
this is especially great because i was looking for a mexican cornbread recipe.. and i've
found it!! thanks!!!!

Really liked it, even with the chilies.  I did cut back on some ingrediants per the other reviews.  My real little ones did not care for it though.  I will probably make it again for a church function or something like that.

This recipe has potential, but I thought it was just okay as is.  I followed previous advice and only used half the sugar and butter.  Consistancy was good, but it was still too sweet for my taste.  Could use even more jalapenos.  Used less cheese in recipe, but sprinkled some on top.  All my friends liked it, however, so if you like sweet cornbread then go for it.  Will make again with a few changes.

For five years or so I've been looking for a really
good recipe for Mexican Cornbread. I'll stop looking
now! My family was here the day after Thanksgiving,
and for a change from turkey I fixed Mexican. The
cornbread was the hit of the evening. I did use the
equivalent of a whole can of peppers. I used green
and red Anaheim peppers that I grew in my garden, roasted
and froze. They are a little spicier than the regular
green chiles, but we really liked the zip they added.
My son-in-law was back in the kitchen getting more of
the bread a few hours after dinner. This one is definitely
a new old favorite!

Absolutely AWESOME cornbread!  My husband and all 5 kids LOVED it!  I can't wait till the next time I have to take "a dish" to a gathering... I know what I'll be taking!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it turned out tasty and perfect!

a crowd pleaser! i would like to try a little less sugar, but it was a success as is. jalapenos would give nice little kick. mine didn't brown on top as much as i would have liked. maybe increasing temp at end would help this. this is a recipe to add to your recipe box!

My husband really loved this one!  I'll definitely be making this one often.  A whole cup of sugar seemed a bit much, so I used half and it was plenty sweet.  Also went with half butter and half margarine.  Perfect.

My family didn't say much about this cornbread at all.  I was a little disappointed.  Won't make again.

This was the absolute best cornbread I've had yet.  A friend thought it was too hot so next time I'll leave out the jalepeno.  The cornbread was moist, sweet, and I will make this many times.
