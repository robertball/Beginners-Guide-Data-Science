Okay, I just wanted to add my review of a very similiar recipe.  It contained 2 packages of seedless red or black grapes, 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 to 1 cup of chopped pecans.  The cream cheese and sugar gets blended together with the pecans and grapes being folded in until coated.  It is a wonderful fruit salad that just happens to have just grapes.  I know it is a preference thing but I've had sooo many people ask me for the recipe.  Nancy's recipe sounds great too...if not a little "lighter" with the whipped cream instead of sugar.  Anyway, hope you enjoy.

I used 8 oz of heavy cream that I whipped with Equal instead of the Cool Whip.  I also used drained Mandarin oranges instead of the grapes. It came out delicious and low carb since cream, Equal, & Cream Cheese are very low in carbs.  Next time I will add pecans as well.

Even though this was relatively fast to throw together, we didn't care for it all that well. Might try it again with a well-drained can of fruit cocktail.

I made this recipe, but it was missing something. We ate it, but didn't really care for it. I had tasted this before and was trying to recreat it. The second time I made it, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1/4 cup of sugar and whipped it into the cream cheese. Perfect! I will always make it with the additional ingredients.

I'm no a huge fan of cool whip or cream cheese in fruit salads. I more prefer flavored yogurts, mayo, or sour cream as a dressing. But I have one question, "WHERE'S THE FRUIT?" My little granddaughter loves fruit salads and particularly grapes, but she turned her little nose skyward! Sorry, I won't be making this again.

This was a super easy and good recipe.  The family loved it....my suggestion would be to eat it in small amount because it's really rich.

This recipe tasted good.  I added about 2 tbsp. of sugar and 2-3 times the amount of grapes.  If i hadn't added the grapes we would have been eating only cool whip and cream cheese with a garnish of grapes!  It was easy, but probably not one I would rave to my friends about.

I thought this recipe was good and my 15 year old daughter thought it was GREAT!  It was light and refreshing. I added more grapes than the recipe called for and a little bit of sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe.

What caught my eye was "easy" and "only 3 ingredients."  Took it to a family gathering yesterday.  It was a hit.  Very rich.  I added extra grapes.  I don't think it would be good with any canned fruit, only fresh.  I thought about adding sugar, but it didn't need it.  Delightful!  Thanks.

Pretty good and so easy too. I couldn't find whipped cream cheese unless they meant the flavored kind that goes on bagels, so I used a block of cream cheese softened and extra creamy cool whip. This was nice and creamy and a wonderful light refreshing dessert. Thanks!

I, too, have done a rendition of this salad but the recipe I've tried creams together 8oz cream cheese with 7oz jar of marshmellow cream.  Then fold in the grapes...with slivered almonds, if you like.

We liked this- it was a nice change in desserts for us. I use red and green grapes. Another reviewer suggested sugar so i tried brown sugar that was good too.

Had a version of this recipe at a backyard party and few weeks ago. I had to make it at home . Found this recipe but , put a little spin on it I added a box of vanilla instant pudding to the cream cheese and cool whip mixture, added red and green grapes, the walnuts and Carmel ice cream topping to finish I added extra  walnuts on top and drizzled with more caramel  then refrigerate  for a few hours

This was an easy fruit/dessert to whip up. I thought there was too much sauce for 2 cups of grapes. I added more grapes and used half red and half green. I also added a small can of pineapple tidbits and a heaping tablespoon of brown sugar. Then it was yummy. Nuts could be sprinkled on if you need crunch.

Love this Recipe. I added Toffee Bits to the salad and it gave it the extra taste it needed! Have made this many times and shared the recipe with most everyone who tried it!

This is an excellent contrast to hot and spicy foods. Add a dash of cinnamon when whipping up the cream cheese and cool whip!
