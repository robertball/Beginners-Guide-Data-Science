Fabulous!!  I have made this dish numerous times and it is a big hit with the family.  You can use any type of vinegar (red, white wine, baslamic).  I cut the oil amount in half and use turkey bacon. Definitely a keeper.

A friend of mine recently made a blue cheese potato salad that called for sour cream. It was pretty good, but this recipe is so much better. It actually reminds me of my german potato salad with the extra bonus of the cheese. This is great served at room temperature. Thank you!

Easy and good recipe.  I added more blue cheese, and added it while potatoes where still warm.  This melts the cheese a bit and makes it creamier. Lots of good comments when served at a BBQ recently!

Whenever I make this salad, I get lots of "ooh's" and "ahhh's".  For those that don't care for blue cheese, you can also substitute crumbled gorgonzola.  It's just as rich!

Made this at a party I catered this weekend, and people wouldn't stop talking about it. Made a couple of changes--used cider vinegar in the dressing and roasted the potatoes. But seriously--bacon, blue cheese, and potatoes? If you don't like this, you're just not eating right!

I enjoyed this very much, but I thought it needed salt. I will make it again, but use less oil, more blue cheese, and more salt.

Simple and Quick....I wanted a recipe for potato salad without mayo... I cooked red potatoes in a microwave just like baked potatoes....then I substituted chives for green onions and imitation bacon bits for real bacon...I omitted blue cheese since not everybody likes it...even the kids enjoyed the finished salad...definitely will do this again!

Absolutely delicious!  I used 1/2 the oil called for in the recipe.  Served it at a barbecue last night, and it got rave reviews.  My guests want me to make it again tonight!

I loved this!!  I added some blue cheese dressing as other reviews suggested. It was outstanding.  However, you have to be a blue cheese lover....my boyfriend is just getting to where he will eat a little blue cheese dressing.  I had him try this and he didn't like it.

A nice twist on standard potato salad.  My husband and I really like blue cheese, so I added 3 oz of blue cheese and about 1/3 cup chunky blue cheese salad dressing.  I also used 6 slices of bacon.  Go for the gusto, I say!

Took other reviewer advice and decreased the olive oil mixture by 1/2 and added blue cheese to warm potatoes which gives it a more creamy texture. Also added 2 t. of dried dill. Yummy!

Awesome!  I went right out and bought all the stuff to make this for dinner.  Fed my husband and a few friends and they were all crazy for it.  I did add a couple cloves of fresh chopped garlic and extra blue cheese - because how can you go wrong with garlic and more cheese?  Great recipe - thanks!

This is my husband's favorite potato salad.  I found that adults tended to like it more than children.  I changed a little after the first time.  I added some blue cheese dressing along with the crumbled blue cheese.  This made it creamier and a little more flavorful.

This is an excellent change from the traditional potato salad, and it was greeted with joy by my no-so-flexible family. I did follow the suggestion of previous reviews and use less olive oil, and went for the flavor of gorganzola as an option to true bleu. If you take this salad with you someplace have recipe cards ready...I was asked repeatedly to share!

Absolutely fantastic!  This is a keeper!  Adding just a little blue cheese dressing enhances the flavor and makes for a creamier consistency!  This has become a staple for all of our adult cookouts!  Thanks so much!  Try this recipe!  You will not regret it!

Oh my gosh!!  This was so tasty and easy!  I was looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch the next day the night before!  I did cut back on the blue cheese a TAD and used balsamic vinegar, because thats what I had.  I made it twice in one week, that's a good recipe!

If you like Blue Cheese, you will love this dish. It puts a different taste on plain ol' potatoes. My bf loved it - who could go wrong w/ bacon & blue cheese.

So this is a funny review.  I was paranoid about overcooking the potatoes and I accidently undercooked them...literally raw! Couldn't take them to the party, but I put them in a casserole in the fridge for a few days and 2 days later threw them in the over.  They were delicious!!  Give it a shot.  (I also added some blue cheese veggie dip, which made it a bit creamier, but nice.)

I'm vegetarian, so I omitted the bacon and added chopped sun-dried tomatoes for flavor. Delicious! A wonderful change from mayo-based potato salads.

Great recipe!  Even one of my kids that doesn't like potato salad loved this.  The blue cheese didn't overpower the salad flavor.  The bacon was just the right amount too.

Very good!  Nice change to regular potato salad.  I added a bit extra blue cheese and plenty of salt and pepper.  Great for cookouts since there is no mayo!

Definitely a repeater. I used 1/2 the olive oil (light) & vinegar called for and "real" bacon bits. Try this one.

I would have loved to give this recipe more stars because I was so excited about it, but my husband and I were both disappointed.  It was good, but not as good as I had anticipated.  Something was missing, I'm just not sure what.  I may try it again and take the advice of others and add some blue cheese dressing.

This is easily one of the best potato salads I've ever made in my entire life. I added the dressing first and then the cheese with the bacon while the bacon was still hot. oh! It was completely amazing!!

I made this pretty much according to the recipe, except I used balsalmic vinegar.  I took it to a potluck and it was the only empty dish at the end of the evening.  I love that it doesn't have mayo and can be served room temperature. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious. I used white wine vinegar as that was what I had, added a little tabasco to the oil/vinegar mix. I didn't have any scallions so I just added a little dried onion for flavor. I adjusted liquid amounts to the amount of potato I had so it wasn't dry at all. Everyone loves that it's mayo free!

I was so excited to try a "Mayo" free Potatoe salad and made this yesterday for a Mom-in-law's BD dinner. I followed the recipe instructions exactly except adding more "Bleu Cheese" and found it to be very bland.  Actually all 5 adults served did not care for it. The Bleu Cheese and Bacon flavors are competely lost even with adding a lot more than recipe called for. All any of us tasted was potatoe. A HUGE disappointment.  I do not believe adding more salt, vinegar or anything else would help. Do not understand all the "Rave" reviews.

Delicious!  I made it yesterday and we ate it last night.  I wish I would have given it another day in the fridge, but everyone enjoyed it nonetheless.  The leftovers were even better today!

What a great spin on potato salad.  It's so light and fresh.  Much better than the creamy potato salad in my opinion.  I don't know that I'll ever go back!  I forgot the bacon in this, but it was still AMAZING without it.  I used red onion because that's what I had on hand.  This stuff is addicting.  It was just as good the next day, too.  I can't wait to make it again.

This was fantastic!  I love blue cheese and potatoes...together they were heaven!  I loved it hot as well.  Next time I will probably decrease the amount of oil, the potatoes seemed to be swimming in it.  I also used real bacon bits instead of frying up some bacon.  Can't wait for the leftovers.  Thanks!

I made one small addition only: the oil & vinegar alone wasn't doing it for me so I added about 1 Tbsp of creamy blue cheese dressing to it - that's all - just a dab. This potato salad has become my personal favourite. Wonderful change of pace!

I think it needs a bit of crunch texture and color, some celery or other crunchy vegetable (red pepper?, carrot? chives?)  but otherwise, this is very, very good for blue cheese AND bacon lovers.  A great main dish or addition to any BBQ.  Just remember to add the bacon close to serving time.  Otherwise it gets mushy.

TOO MUCH OIL!!! I had so much left over that didn't absorb. Eww! Otherwise, this recipe is great. I added celery, besides that next time I will cut back on the back a little on the bacon (personal preference). Didn't have enough green onions on hand, supplemented with red onion which was fine. The blue cheese flavor was very strong the first day, but mellowed out on day two.

Yum! And so easy. I didn't have any green onion so I added diced sweet onion instead. I also used half of the oil and it was plenty. I added a pinch of sugar to the dressing. I made the salad a few hours ahead so the flavors would meld. I added the bacon early too, but it got mushy, so next time I will add the bacon just before serving.

THis was super yummy! I doubled the blue cheese and bacon to make it a little more gluttonous! I also added a dash of blue cheese dressing. Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic!!!!  Brought to a 4th of July family picnic. Rave reviews. Caught my sister eating it as a midnight snack, she said it was the best she ever tastes. You must LOVE blue cheese though, which we do :)

As others suggested, I increased blue cheese and bacon (2.5 oz and 6 strips), and decreased oil to 1/3 cup.  I think that it would have been fine with the amount of cheese and bacon the recipe called for.  It ended up being a little bit too much blue cheese for my tastes- a little bit goes a long way! However, so glad I decreased the oil!  1/2 cup would definitely have been too much.  Overall very good flavor!

I'd give this 5 if it were just me. I LOVED it but it didnt wow the crowd as I thought it might judging from other reviews. It was definitely best the first day, the vinegar was kind of strong by second day. 15 minutes cooking time for potatoes is only good if they are about the size of ping pong balls otherwise definitely longer time.

Instead of adding extra oil to the dressing, use about a teaspoon of the bacon grease, instead.  I have used Bragg's cider vinegar on this for an outstanding finish.

My husband enjoyed. I can't eat blue cheese because of a severe penicillin allergy. He said that the potatoes needed just a little bit longer maybe 20 minutes instead of 15 but that could have been the fact that the potatoes were a little big.

Oh hey - this was just delicious!  Yes, it had a bit too much oil.  I usually read reviews and should have caught that.  Actually I had a sneaking suspicion there would be too much when I poured it in the bowl, but decided to go for it this time.  I used Gorgonzola cheese instead of Blue - personal preference and added a bit more salt after tasting.  We enjoyed it warm, but I'm sure it will be good after a rest in the fridge as well.  This is just a super potato salad.  Thanks for sharing!

Simply delicious recipe that is easy to make and is a nice change up from your typical Potato Salads.  I definitely recommend making it ahead of time a refrigerating to give time for the great flavors to  meld.  I did reserve some bacon bits, Green Onion and Blue Cheese which I sprinkled over the top just before serving to freshen it up.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this exactly as is, fabulous! Then I made it again adding some fried in butter fish. I had to use it up so I added it to this dish. It stands on its own, but can be played with too. The perfect recipe!

I made this recipe for a July 4th picnic.  The salad was the most talked about thing at the picnic, people loved it.  The combination of flavors give it a "new" taste, something different than the old stand by potato salad.  I would also recommend cutting down on the oil as others mentioned in their reviews.  Delicious!

Awesome.  For an extra twist I added a handful of dried cranberries.  Sweet, salty was excellent with the blue cheese.

I read over this recipe and decided to make it, as it contains all the ingredients I love.  Coupled with the overall 4.5 Star Rating, I thought this one would be a winner.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The flavors seemed to work against each other, and the blue tinge of the blue cheese made this potato salad look extremely unappetizing.  Will never make again.

I made this yesterday with 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil and everything else the same as the recipe, except instead of boiling the red potatoes, I rubbed them with olive oil and salt and roasted them in a 350 degree oven until tender, then cut them into serving size pieces.  It was super delicious and everyone liked it.

I don't often bother to rate recipes, but this one is SO good that it deserves 5+ stars!!  I am not a fan of traditional mayo-based potato salads, so this recipe intrigued me.  The flavors blend so well together to form the best potato salad I've ever had.  I get so many compliments and people asking for the recipe.  This one is a keeper for sure.  I agree with the other suggestions to cut the oil in half.  Other than that, I LOVE this potato salad!!!

I had to give it 3 stars.  Next time I'll follow the instructions instead of reading the other suggestions.  I added everything to the hot potatoes and the oil from the dressing separated out & made a mess.  Also the green onions became soft instead of crisp.  The flavor was nice, it just wasn't presentable as made.

This is amazingly easy.  Due to time restraints I made this totally in my office at work!!  Used a microwave veggie steamer to cook the potatoes and nuked the bacon, too. Mixed all while warm.  Very creamy. Served room temperature.  Only rave reviews from those attending pot luck.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This potato salad is very yummy. I added more blue cheese and omitted the salt. The bacon made it salty enough for my taste any way.

This is  an awesome dish.  When we had our friends sample it they immediately wanted the recipe....  One item I am going to add is fresh chopped jalapenos.  Just to spice it up a little.

Loved this potato salad - totally different than anything I have made before and a nice change.  I also used a bit of prepared blue cheese dressing in addition to the included dressing (just 1-2 T of it) and extra blue cheese crumbles.  I also added a little extra bacon and blue cheese crumbles.  It's excellent served at an outdoor BBQ.

Thank you for posting this awesome recipe.  I needed a recipe for potato salad that didn’t call for Mayonnaise since I have a teen that gags at the thought of Mayo!  I have made the recipe “as is” & it is great.  Nothing needs to be changed.  However, since we are all Bleu Cheese lovers, I added a little extra the second time I made it.  I also added finely chopped celery and I used a 2 lb bag of chopped hash browns to make the dish extra fast & easy.  My family loved it!

Like others, I cut back on the oil and added more blue cheese.  It was unique, a good change of pace!  I love blue cheese and am always looking for new ways to incorporate.  Thanks!!

This potato salad is AWESOME!  Both my husband and I loved it.  Like all the other reviewers suggestion, I cut the olive oil in half, and it was perfect!  I also did use 4 oz. container of blue cheese, and the flavor was perfect.  LOVE IT and will definitely make it again.

I am not a fan of traditional potato salad, so when I had to choose between having someone else bring potato salad, and making something I'd actually eat ... I chose the latter ... And everyone loved it. I too only used half the olive oil called for. I'll definitely be making this again.

I have to say that I chose to use Bernsteins Blue Cheese dressing (instead of the oil and vinegar), bacon, red bell pepper for crunch and it was very tasty.  My husband thought it was very good too! This was my first attempt of creating potato salad and I am pleased with the results.

My go-to side for summertime barbecues. I do not like potato salad in general (I'm not a huge mayonnaise fan), but I adore this one. So simple, so quick, so delicious! My in-laws rave about this recipe and consistently request that I make it.

I thought this meal wasn't too bad and different that the deli potato salads you get at the store. I did had to cut the quartered potatoes into bite-sized pieces. I've used only one green onion stalk instead of a cup and 8 red new potatoes instead of a pound. I might make it again, though I do have leftovers chilled for another night.

Excellent! Toss potatoes with oil and vinegar when potatoes are still warm and then let cool. Add cheese and bacon once it's cool.

Following some suggestions, I roasted the potatoes. My own addition was that I also used cauliflower that was roasted. No olive oil, rather I used some really good blue cheese dressing and some fat free Greek yogurt. It’s so good that I’m having a hard time leaving it alone while it’s chilling in the fridge.

Absolutely loved this dish! I followed the recipe exactly for a quick weeknight meal of grilled chicken, Mexican street corn & this potato salad. All of us loved it, and my brother-in-law asked for the recipe. I'm making it again tomorrow for a cookout. It will definitely stay in my Favorites

I really don't understand the rave reviews. There is so much pepper in this recipe that it absolutely overpowers everything else. My family couldn't eat it and we enjoy spicy food! It's just too much black pepper!!!
I tried two recipes from the June/July magazine and they were both under par. My confidence in the ratings system is shaken.

Saw this recipe in the latest Allrecipes magazine. So simple and it has a great flavor. Perfect with bbq chicken. Next time I'll reduce the oil to about half, same amount of vinegar and as mentioned in another review add some ground mustard.

Holy cow!  This is so good!  This is now the only potato salad I make.  I love to add some stone ground mustard for an extra little kick--a tablespoon or so, depending on how much I make.  Make sure to not overcook the potatoes.

Tasted great! We left out the bacon because we are a pork free family, but it didn't need it. We will make it again.

Delish!  This is a tasty gourmet potato salad.  I followed this recipe in its entirety and it's delicious.  We had locally made blue cheese in our CSA box this week and this recipe showcased it perfectly.

My husband was reading a book in which a character mentioned eating bleu cheese potato salad.  I thought he was crazy when he asked me to make it.  But if course I found a recipe on Allrecipes!  It was amazing & a huge hit whenever we take it to gatherings. It's a great change of pace from regular potato salad.  The only change we made was to add 1/2 cup bleu cheese dressing only because we wanted it a little creamy.  Perfect as is, too!

I served this potato salad with smoked ribs and coleslaw. The flavors paired well and the blue cheese complemented the dish without overpowering it. I would definitely make this again.

I really like this recipe. It's a nice change from the typical mayo-mustard type potato salad. I took someone else's advice and cut the amount of oil in half. Glad I did! Maybe if you give the oil time to absorb the full amount would be alright, but when serving immediately 1/4 cup will do. 

The only other thing that I did different was add a little bit of dill. I've made it without the dill and it is a bit tastier with it in there.

I really enjoyed this!  I used a lot of blue cheese because I love that stinky cheese!  I used 5 slices of microwavable bacon and I quartered the tiny red potatoes.  Roasted them in the oven, rather than boiling.  Very good.  Like the semi-German style potato salad.  Will make again.

I loved this recipe. The 2nd time i tried it, I halved the oil and used a white balsamic vinegar. I exchanged the blue cheese for gorgonzola & added about a tablespoon of fresh chopped dill. All I can say is WOW!

I love this potato salad.  It is sooo good and sooo easy.  Just a tip though, half the oil and make sure that the potatoes are cooked enough.  I did not cook mine enough and needed to throw it in the oven to finish cooking some of them.  Still turned out great.

Oh yummy!  I used multi-colored potatoes to enhance the look.  I cut the oil in half and used white balsamic vinegar.  I added the cheese to the hot potatoes so it melted a bit.  When I tried this dish warm it was out of this world.  I plan on serving it tomorrow at room temp.  Hopefully its as tasty!

Wow!! This is a great and easy potato salad! My husband and I both loved it and he already requested again for the weekend. I used bacon bits instead of slices cooked bacon because I forgot to thaw my bacon. It was wonderful with bacon bits so I cannot imagine how great it'd be with real freshly cooked bacon. YUM!

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ and it got devoured.  At first no one knew what it was but they went back for seconds.  I added chopped celery for crunch and I think it was a good idea. I had to make the dressimg twice, to taste the second time because the proportions were off on my first try and I also added a few tablespoons of blue cheese dressing to the mixture.

Made this yesterday for our July 4th party and it received rave reviews. I used half purple potatoes...so it looked very festive for holiday. I tripled the recipe, yet only used a little more than a cup of olive oil. I used more blue cheese than the reciped called for. Yummy!

I followed this recipe about 99%.  I added just a little bit more blue cheese than called for and that was the only difference.  I fixed it for a group of friends for an upscale BBQ and it was a great hit.  I had a few leftovers and I think they were even better the next day.  I will absolutely fix this again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loved this, even my picky eaters. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and cut back on the olive oil. I added chopped celery, red pepper and chives which made for a colorful salad. Will definitely make again.

I am a certified potato salad junkie so I wasn't sure I would like this with no mayonaise, but it was really good. A nice change to traditional potato salad.The bleu cheese adds a great kick.

This recipe is always a hit!  I usually prepare a day ahead - seems to taste better second day.  I cut the oil in half and add extra blue cheese. My family requests it on a regular basis.

I've had this at gourmet restaurants in Ohio. Now that I live in georgia, I haven't found anywhere that serves this... It is by far my favorite potato salad and a BIG hit at the dinner table!

Absolutely delicious!  The vinaigrette and blue cheese were a perfect pair.  A definite keeper!

This was pretty good. I added some sugar to the dressing so the vinegar wouldn't be so tart for the BF. That was a good move. HOwever, the potatoes needed to cook longer and were too hard. It was also very time consuming to assemble...probably due to the bacon. Will try again because it seems to be human error mostly.
