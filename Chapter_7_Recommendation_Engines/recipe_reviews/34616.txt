It's a good start but I didn't like the taste with the anchovy paste (a little to fishy) so I left it out the second time and added a little salt.  I also blended all the ingredents but the oil and then slowly added the olive oil down the funnel while blender is going.  It seemed to separate when blended all at once.  Also doing it this way I seemed to use a little less oil.
Thanks for the recipe, I have been looking for a tasty caesar dressing!

This is fantastic!  The first time, I did half the recipe and 2 cloves of garlic was just right for me.  I used less oil (about 3/4 c.), less cheese (about half of recipe) and no anchovies (yeck).  I didn't have any sour cream so I used a splash of buttermilk.  I put in 1/4 c. olive oil into the blender first to 'catch' the rest of the ingredients, chucked everything else in and I did drizzle the last of the olive oil in while the blender was on.  I dressed the romaine with it and added sauted greek chicken on top--all cold for a really hot day.  WoW!  My husband (v fussy) DEVOURED it and came home the next night saying 'I'm craving that salad again!'  (Good thing I had more!)  Will definitely do this again and am bringing some over to a friend.  =-)

Yum!  Much tastier than the store-bought stuff we just ran out of.  I didn't have any anchovy paste or parmesan on hand, so I  put in a rounded teaspoon of kosher salt and substituted pecorino romano cheese.  I also added freshly ground black pepper and a rounded teaspoon of sugar.  I forgot to add the mustard powder, but didn't miss it -- I'll have to remember to include it next time.  I had some really good extra virgin olive oil, and I'm sure that made a big difference in the overall flavor.

I just didn't like this recipe. My husband and I are huge caesar lovers, we choose restaurants based on their caesar's! So I'm surprised we didn't care for this, it was tangy and bitter. After reading the reviews again, seems most that liked the recipe didn't use the anchovy paste so maybe I'll omit it and try again?

This is a great Caesar dressing...quick and easy too.  I didn't have any olive oil on hand so I substituted Canola oil.  Also, I added about 1/4 tsp. fresh ground black pepper.  Delicious!!

This is THE BEST salad dressing!!!!  Even my finicky daughter loves it.  This salad fits right into our eating plan (Suzanne Somers') especially when we use sauteed parmesan cheese for "croutons."  Especially good as a chicken caesar salad.  I can't keep a double recipe on hand!

Great dressing! I didn't have anchovy paste, so I skipped that. I halved the recipe but forgot to half the garlic and was waaay garlicky but in a good way (I love garlic). I also forgot to put the parm cheese in - it was a little runny but still tasted delish!!

I thought it was too runny and a little too tangy. I omitted the anchovy paste, so maybe that was the problem.

NOT SURE WHY THIS HAD SO MANY STARS:  I really did not like this dressing at all. I am a traveler and my diet consists mostly of salads and I have eaten Caesar salads at some of the finest places to eat in the world. I am well accquainted with what to expect and this was not acceptable. I tried to modify the bitter and unpleasant results and it was almost unsalvagable. I DO NOT recommend this if you are used to fine dining Caesar salads- you will be very disappointed.

When I first make a recipe from AR, I like to make it as written so that I can give a fair review.  I feel like others that it was a little tart.  Next time I will cut the lemon juice in half.  I also, like other reviewers, found the dressing really runny.  After tasting the original recipe, I added a coddled egg.  (This is a whole egg boiled for one minute to kill any salmonella that may be present).  I added the whole coddled egg to the dressing and blended.  This thickened up the dressing really well.  Made it much better as a salad dressing, in my opinion.  Thank you for posting the recipe.

Not a bad flavor, but way too oily tasting...I would use less than half of the recommended oil...you can always add more if you want later, but you can't take it out once you've mixed it up.

I lost my beloved caesar dressing recipes a couple of years ago and this was the closest one I've found since.  I needed a quick caesar dressing recipe as my guests were scheduled to arrive in 30 minutes and I didn't have any store-bought in the house.  This homemade dressing is so much better than any store-bought!  After borrowing a fresh lemon from my neighbor, I whipped this up exactly as written.  It was a huge hit, even with the kids!  Like other reviewers, I tossed romaine lettuce with the dressing, some caesar croutons and freshly grated parmesan reggiano.  I LOVE a really tangy caesar dressing, so I thought the amount of anchovy paste and garlic was perfect.  A little goes a long way.  It definitely thickens overnight in the fridge.  Can't wait to use it again.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Too Olive Oily & bitter!

My husband loves Caesar dressing and I've had some I've like at good restaurants, but am generally not a fan of bottled Caesar dressing.  My hubby is fine with the bottled stuff--particularly Ken's Light Caesar.  Neither of us liked this.  Hubby said we'll use the rest but to please not make this recipe again.

I followed the recipe, but left out the anchovy paste.  Maybe the anchovy paste would help.  Might try it next time.

First off, it was way too Olive Oily & bitter!  It tasted like olive oil with other stuff in it.  (I make a dressing with olive oil, lemon juice, salt & pepper and we like that--somehow, this dressing was more olive oil tasting than my concoction)
I added more parmesan to the mix to see if it would reduce the bitterness and oiliness, but it didn't.  Might be too much garlic, too.  I used 3 large cloves.

We used it on salad straight away.  Don't know if it will be better tomorrow, as the author suggests it best after sitting in fridge "for a day or two."

Also, the dressing separates.  Don't know if that is normal.

Might be the mustard powder that caused the bitterness.  I'll try dijon from a jar next time.

I thought this was very good!  I used about 6 anchovy fillets in place of the paste, and probably used a bit less oil.  I blended everything except the oil together first, then drizzled in the oil to better emulsify it.  It's not as thick as bottled dressing, but it wasn't exactly a vinaigrette either.  I enjoyed it very much, and I am grateful for an egg-free recipe for this. Thank you!

Made a half batch as directed...It was ok...I used it as a base to tweek the ingredients more to my liking.  I do like anchovy paste as apposed to some other reviewers so I kept that.  I added: more garlic, more lemon, more vinegar (white balsamic) and I used 3 T of heavy cream insted of sour cream as I didn't have any.  I also added pepper.  Like i said, a nice base...but I wouldn't serve as written.

This is good but it does not age well. The recipe makes a lot of dressing so plan to make only what you will use in about a week or so.

Delicious. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because that is way too much olive oil. I used about 1/2 cup. I also left out the anchovy paste, used garlic powder instead of raw garlic, and dijon mustard instead of powder. I didn't have any sour cream, so I used buttermilk, and I used a lime instead of a lemon (just 1). I also added salt and pepper. A great base recipe, easy to substitute! Yummy!!

We liked the authentic taste of the anchovies.  I also liked the taste of the sour cream rather than some recipes that use mayo or mustard in place of an egg.  This was very potent which pleased my kids as more flavor = better in thier minds.  I made pizza on the grill and the salad was the first thing gone, not the pizza!!!  It needed  something.  I added salt and pepper...good now, but will keep trying to figure out what is missing.

Made exactly as stated. Delicious! You need only a tablespoon at a time mixed with the Romaine or you will get too much dressing!!! We added some Parmesan on top with croutons.

Great recipe but I altered it as well. I used 3/4 cup extra light olive oil, 3 tablespoons light sour cream, got rid of the anchovy paste and added a fair amount of pepper and some salt. I did the math and through my altered recipe it yielded 1 and 3/4 cups.

I love love love this dressing!   Some changes I made however, was 1 cup of olive oil instead of 1 1/2 for less fat, and replace 1/2 cup missing olive oil with water. Also because when refrigarated, the olive oil became hard, so it became more of a paste than a dressing. The water gave it some movement. I left out the anchovy paste because i hate anchovies. I didnt have mustard powder so I put just regular mustard instead. I like the parmesan a bit chunky so i bought it whole and pulsed it a bit in the food processor instead of buying it grated All in all, really great recipe!! :-) i always have a jar of it in the fridge!

Nice flavor (if you use fresh lemon juice and fresh garlic), but I was expecting a "creamy" texture like what you get in restaurants and that's not what I got!  Needs some fresh cracked pepper too.  Def too oily, should reduce it by at least a 1/3.  Will be looking around for a better recipe...

It was okay.  But just okay.  It had flavor, but just not a lot of complexity or character.

The first time I made this dressing I didn't have the anchovy paste and thought it was very good.  The second time I made it I used anchovy paste and WOW what a difference.  I love this dressing!

This is totally different from the creamy white Caesar dressings I'm used to having in restaurants. I would describe the finished product as a Ceaser-esque vinigrette. The taste was fairly authentic. Like the desciption says, it tastes better after a couple of days in the fridge. Way too much oil for my liking, but as this dressing seperates when left to stand, I just skimmed off the surface oil. A small amount of this dressing goes a long way as it's very flavourful. Perfect with a green salad (not just romaine leaves) topped with smoked salmon, poached egg and crusty toasted wholewheat bread.

Great but too much oil.  I cut back on the oil (3/4 cup) and added more parm cheese and a little hot sauce to kick it up a notch!!

This was great!  I did tweak it.  Skipped the anchovy.  Put everything in the blender then slowly added EVOO.  I didn't need as much oil this way.  Tossed in some extra sour cream and cheese to make it more creamy.  I was amazed that I had everything in the panty.  I won't buy Caeser dressing again!

Excellent recipe!  I did cut back by half on the Anchovy paste based on reviews I read and I added a  pinch of Cayenne Pepper.  Absolutely wonderful.

I really liked this- I made 1/3 recipe to test it out-just in case..I was worried about the generous anchovy allotment so for a 1/3 recipe I only used about a scant 1/2 tsp-and I thought this was almost too much for my tastes-but still good. To me I think the recipe as-is gives you a "Caesar vineagrette" which is very good but more of an oil consistency. I've had something similar in restaurants but I've also had the "creamy Caesar dressings" too- so to get a bit more creaminess-and to soften the anchovy flavor a bit more-I added a little more sour cream. For the finished salad I did add extra Parmesan and I was so I very impressed!! Both versions were good-whether you keep the recipe with mostly olive oil or add additional aour cream. All in all, this recipe is far better than most bottled, fresh, or restaurant versions. Thanks so much-super easy to make and so much cheaper than buying bottle after bottle after bottle...

This dressing is amazing! We had to go buy more salad because we could not stop eating it! I adjusted this recipe by using just over 1/2 cup oil (just seemed like way too much oil), used 3 anchovies and fat free sour cream. It's like having a quality restaurant salad at home!

This was the best Caesar Dressing I have found so far. I did not have to change a thing and used it right away. Using Olive oil makes it thicken up quite a bit in the refrigerator so needs to sit at room temperature a short time to be able to pour on salad.  Ruth S.

I used salt instead of anchovy paste as well.  Nice simple Caesar dressing.  I may tweak it a tad next time I make it, but overall I was very happy with this.

I really liked this dressing. Especially because it was so easy to make. I had anchovy fillets left over from another recipe so I used them instead of the anchovy paste. Other than that, I followed the recipe pretty closely.It was very creamy and exactly how I love caesar dressing (I love anchovies!) I did make only a half sized recipe and used about 1/4 cup less olive oil. I actually think I would use a ittle less oil next time. Maybe add a little more sour cream instead (?) You could really taste the olive oil. But maybe if it sits for a day the flavors will meld a little more. I will definitely be making this one again since I usually have all the neccessary ingredients around the house. Try this one!! You won't be sorry!

In case you were wondering - this recipe does not work with other types of cheese. I can't get Parmesan where I live, so I made this with mozzarella cheese - it was bitter and grainy. Frankly, I don't think it was just the fault of he cheese - there's also too much lemon juice, but the cheese didn't help.

This was a great dressing.  Changes made: used Canola instead of Olive oil, as olive oil separates and solidifies a bit upon refrigerating.  Also, only used a cup of oil.  I agreed with other reviewers and 1 1/2 cups seemed like way too much.  Omitted the anchovy paste, and added around a 1/2 tsp. each of salt and pepper.  I think it's key to use fresh lemon juice, as opposed to bottled.  Those who complained of the dressing being bitter clearly must have used bottled.  I think this dressing can easily be adjusted to one's preference, but it's delicious pretty much exactly as it is.  I made it in the morning and refrigerated all day for dinner that night and it was delicious.  My husband, who is a huge Caesar salad fan, LOVED it.  Be sure to use quality Parmesan cheese and real lemon juice. Thanks for a great recipe.

I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings. Also, rather than using 3/4 cup olive oil, I used 1/4 cup olive oil. The taste was great! I was so greatful that I found a recipe for Caesar dressing that has less ingredients than some other one's off AR and still tastes good. Served with "Hamburger Vegetable Soup," "Toasted Garlic Bread," and a romaine lettuce/spinach salad.

For such a quickly prepared recipe, this dressing is FABULOUS!!!  I didn't have any anchovies or paste on hand, so I omitted it and it was still wonderful.  I know I'll love it even more the next time I make it with the paste.  Thanks for the keeper!!!

Not the best caesar dressing I've had...  for my taste, I'll use it for a base and "twiddle".   I'm in the process of making it now.  I thought the amount of oil sounded like too much so cut it to 1 cup.  I thought the amount of anchovy paste sounded like too much so I started with a little and I am still adding.  I don't think the 2 table spoons is going to be too much.    Also, I needed to add 2 more large cloves of garlic.  Just tasted it again and I think I'll add even more anchovy paste.  It's still not quite right but not bad at all...  Thanks for a nice recipe.

I made this dressing to use in another AR recipe ‘Carrot Pepperoni Caesar Salad’.  I really enjoyed the taste of this 
Caesar, using part of it for the other salad and rest as dressing for salads.  Before AR I would have NEVER used anchovy paste – EVER!  I do not enjoy seafood, but I LOVE trying new recipes.  The first time I used it was in a pizza sauce recipe from AR.  The awesome people from “thebuzz” suggested I not leave it out as it adds a lot of flavor.  I used it for the pizza sauce and now I’ve used it on a couple of Caesar dressings.  I like the creaminess that the sour cream adds to this dressing.  It brought wonderful flavor to the salad I was adding it to.  If you are hesitant to use the anchovy paste, please use it.  It really does add a lot of depth to the dressing and is not the least bit overpowering.  Nice dressing recipe and I will be making this one again.

This is a wonderfully tasty and easy-to-prepare recipe.  We didn't have Parmesan the first time I made this dressing but it was still delicious.  We don't have a wide range of olive oils available here and I doubt what we get is very good quality but the result is fantastic.  LOVED it with the Parmesan!  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This is delicious! I used just one Tablespoon of Anchovy paste but I think 2 would have been fine. Tip: I combined all ingredients in a blender except the olive oil - then with blender running added oil in a thin stream and the consistency was wonderful, almost a mayonaise. It helps to use the best of ingredients - fresh squeezed Meyer Lemon, fresh garlic, good olive oil. I like that this recipe doesn't use fresh egg yolk so that it will keep in a jar in the fridge without spoiling.

This is one of the 3 caesar dressings we tried out today and it was pretty darn good (it took second place in our household...the third place one was waaaay behind).

I am still unsure how I feel about the sour cream but over all it was good. We did not have anchovy paste on hand so we used 2 actual anchovy filets.

We did feel that there was a bit too much oil involved and it seemed to separate quite easily (almost visually unappealing) so be sure to shake it before using. 

Although we liked the taste of this one, we probably won't be making it again. It IS worth a try though. We found one that we like a bit better so we will be sticking with that one.

I made a quarter batch of this for one salad but added 3 times as much garlic as the recipe calls for. If I hadn't over done it on the garlic it would have been perfect! I'll just do double garlic next time.

It was okay. If I made it again I would cut the amount of olive oil in half and maybe use a mix of EVO & Veg oil.I was getting an overpowering of the oil. If your a garlic lover you may want to put in another couple of cloves.  I will look for a different recipe for Caesar dressing before making this one again.

I halved this recipe for my husband and me and it made 4 entree-sized salads for us (yum, leftovers!).  I omitted the anchovy paste even though I love it - I couldn't find mine anywhere!  I'll plan on adding it to taste next time, because the dressing was delicious without it.  I added salt and pepper to taste as well.  I love that this recipe doesn't use mayo, which I hate.  Thanks for sharing!  This will be my go-to caesar dressing!

I found there was far too much of an oil flavour.  I doubled everything BUT the oil, and still find the flavour to be 'off'. I am currently letting it chill to see if it tastes better.  Either way, I would not make this again, or recommend it to anyone.

This dressing was easy to make, and was incredible!!  My husband commented several times through dinner how delicious the dressing was.  Thank you!!  I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and garlic salt instead of anchovy paste.  It really was delicious

I reduced the oil to 1 cup, added salt & pepper as well as omitted the dry mustard.  I used Light mayonnaise the second time I made this instead of sour cream, it was a little less tart.

I love this! Did it on the spur of the moment as the chicken was on the grill and it was yummy. Can't wait to taste it tomorrow after it has had time to blend. It's important to use a blender or food processer and drizzle in the most of the olive oil so that it emulsifies. Mine was nice and thick. I'm sure it would benefit from fresh lemon juice and high quality parm but even Real Lemon and Kraft were good! I doubled the garlic and didn't have anchovy paste but otherwise to the letter! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!!  This was such a great Caesar dressing - full of flavor and kick, and tasted SO much better than anything store-bought!  Like others, I had no anchovy paste, so I didn't (and wouldn't) use it.  I do think the garlic could be scaled back just a tad, but that is probably just my personal preference.  I also used less olive oil (about 1 c) because you could taste strong undertones of it, and upped the sour cream to about 5 Tbs.  Super yummy and very easy!

This is a great recipe! The only thing that I did different from the recipe was to add 1 egg yolk to help thicken it up a little. Like a lot of others I also think that next time I will cut the lemon juice in half. I will definately be using this recipe often in my home! I bet it would also make a great marinade for chicken!! Thank you.

I love Maggiano's caesar salad dressing and was hoping this recipe would be similar. I followed the recipe, with the exception of using a little yellow mustard in addition to the dry mustard that was called for. Also, after tasting the dressing, I thought it tasted too lemony (a combination of the lemon juice and the olive oil I think), so I added about a teaspoon of sugar to help get rid of that sour bite. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I do like the hint of Anchovy flavor in the dressing. It was a success, and very similar to the Maggiano's recipe. I even found myself scraping the bottom of the bowl to get out every last trace of dressing.

Very good, easy and quick. I didn't have mustard powder so I added some dijon mustard, didn't have sour cream, added plain yougourt and didn't have anchovy past, added some capers. I blended everything in the blender except the oil, then poured the oil slowly into the dressing while the blender was on.

I, personally, prefer to use 1/2 can of flat anchovies and a 4:1 ratio of oil to wine vinegar. I also kick it up with a full clove of chopped garlic and omit the sour cream. All goes in a food processor or are mashed between the tines of a fork just like table side service. It's a reputation maker!

I love garlic but the garlic was alittle over powering.  Maybe my cloves were bigger than they should have been.  I think next time I will use half.  I want it to have more of a subtle flavor of garlic.

Very, very good! I used half of the anchovy paste and half of the garlic, & it was plenty.  You only need a little bit of this dressing to dress an entire bowl of greens, and it is very tasty.

Excellent..just what I was looking for.  Just the right amount of garlic and tanginess.  I substituted cojita chesse for the parmesean cheese since I'm serving the caesar salad with enchiladas.

Really, really tasty. I used a whole can of anchovy filets because that's what I had on hand, they ground up really well in my mini food processor. Started on the lesser side of the olive oil, then added more to make it the consistency I wanted. Put it in the ol' Wishbone Italian Dressing jar for easy storage and serving. I really prefer a homemade dressing to store bought, but worry about the shelf life.  I usually don't keep/eat it more than 3-4 days after preparing. Anyone out there know how long a dressing like this will stay fresh in the fridge?

I had run out of the store bought stuff and needed a quick and easy recipe, needless to say I probably won't be buying the store stuff anymore. I thought this recipe was perfect and I had the satisfaction of knowing I had made it myself. I didn't have any anchovies so I omitted them, might try it with anchovies next time. It is true what the other reviews said... it isn't exactly the same as the restaurant version but then most home cooked meals aren't. I loved it.

This was really good. I added salt and pepper, and only 1 tbsp of the anchovy paste. I would have liked it a little thicker....maybe next time I will add more sour cream. It is a keeper!

I made this last night and it was great. I didnt use as much olive oil , as a matter of fact, I knew I wasnt going to like the anchovies paste idea, so i used the olive oil that comes with my store bought anchovies for the dressing. It turned out great. I also added a little black pepper.

This is such an amazing caesar dressing! To make it my own and to give it a less lemony taste I add a quarter cup of sugar to the recipe. This is the only caesar dressing that I use on salads now! This is a great and delicious recipe!

Awesome recipe! I love to make anything I can from scratch--avoid as much junk and processing as possible. I used the anchovy paste--can't imagine a great Caesar dressing without one--all the best restaurants use anchovies it's what gives Caesar it's unquie taste.

This has become a staple in our kitchen.  Very easy to whip up on a weeknight with some help from my daughter!  We we sometimes substitute the sour cream for plain yogurt.

This had a decent flavor, but I don't prefer it over store bought (I use Ken's). For the time, cost, and flavor, I'll stick with bottled Caesar, unless I don't have any on hand. I would give this recipe another go if I happened to be in a crunch.

Not even close to the best. It tasted like oil and vinegar. No ceasar flavor maybe it needs the anchovy paste. The only thing I left out.

I liked the look of this recipe, ingredients I had, no mayo start, I read the reviews and changed the recipe accordingly, 2 garlic cloves, a little less lemon juice, I was concerned about the amount of anchovy paste, much more than most recipes so I used about half, still so bitter it was almost inedible, sorry but not a keeper for my family.

My family loves this dressing on our Chicken Caesar Wraps. I do leave out the anchovy paste as it suits our family that way.   Also, I use less oil, only about a cup rather than the 1 1/2 cups.  I made the mistake of going the lazy route and using bottled dressing on the wraps last time; it was a great disappointment.   :)

you can easily add more garlic, and to thicken we used to throw a few cubes of tofu in and use a food processor. it will thicken it nicely with zero calories, if that is your thing

Around my house, there are always 'Fat Free' or 'Diet' Salad Dressings -- but Our Son was coming home over Thanksgiving with his Girlfriend and I wanted something that he would enjoy. Besides, he is weight training and eats 5000 calories a day!! Anyway, the only change I made was to increase the amount of Garlic, sprinkled in some Onion Powder, Salt and Pepper. Ironically, we all ended up trying it (What the Heck -- it's Thanksgiving :) And I was grateful that it didn't include Mayonaise (which I despise).

I have been making this recipe for years - and have given it  to friends and family. My daughter prefers the ratio of oil to vinegar to be equal but that is a matter of personal taste.  I have also substituted balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar with great results.

This dressing turned out great!  I only made a couple changes,  I used just over a cup of olive oil and one tablespoon of anchovy paste.  I also used low fat sour cream just to make the dressing a bit healthier.

Better than any store bought Caesar we have tried.  My 2 year old even loved it! I did reduce the oil to only 1 cup, I reduced the anchovy paste to 1 1/2 tablespoons, and at the last minute I realized I was out of Worcestershire sauce, and so had no choice but to use A1, which turned out really great!  Highly recommend, but if you don't want a lot left over, I would cut the recipe in half.

I doubled the sour cream and had to use prepared Dijon mustard (since that was all I had).  I've never made Ceasar with real anchovie paste before, but I liked this and it seems pretty authentic.

This is good, but it didn't taste like Caesar dressing to me.  I would call it "Garlic Dressing" because all I could taste was garlic.  I drizzled the oil in after the other ingredients and it emulsified into a mayo-like texture; I would not recommend doing it that way.

This was a really good caesar! I halved the recipe and it was more than enough to nicely coat the large salad I made. I couldn't find anchovy paste unfortunately. After tasting it at first, I felt it was a bit too sour from the lemon, so I just added about a tablespoon of sugar and it balanced it out nicely. I will be putting it in my recipe book, and I would definitely recommend it!

Too much Anchovie Paste. I think only 1/8-1/4 of what is called for is necessary. Next time I will use more buttermilk and less oil too, it was thick and oily.

I didn't have the Anchovy paste, and I used only one cup of Olive Oil. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. ( I used regular mustard powder, I didn't know if I should use the hot, so used the regular)  My dressing came out thick.  You have to add the Olive oil very slowly, or it will be thin.  I am going to  sprinkle more parmesan on the salad when I toss it.

I did not care for this. It looked like Caesar but tasted nothing like it! I think the red wine vinegar and sour cream are not good choices. I was able to fix it by adding mayo, more lemon juice and Worchestershire.

The flavor was there, but the consistency/texture was lacking.  I used a tad less oil, but still ended up being too oily.

This is very good with a few additions.  I halved the recipe and added 1/2 tsp of fresh ground black pepper and 1/4 cup of half and half.  The cream reduced the tang just enough.  I also probably used a bit more cheese but thats just my preference.
