This was really good. The whole family enjoyed it. Reading all the problems w/the rice turning the soup to mush, I came up with this solution. I made the soup according to the directions (adding a little more spices to my liking) and instead of adding the rice to the soup to cook, I made the rice first (I used instant rice) and then the last 30 minutes or so, just added the rice to the soup. Came out more like soup, not mush. Hope this helps anyone else. Thanks for the recipe Corwyn. This one is a keeper.

This soup is delicious and it is one of my
favorite dishes in the winter.   It goes great
with some home made whole wheat bread.

I like to spice up the soup a bit by adding
some thyme, garlic, and basil.   Find the right
combination of these three to meet your taste
buds.   

For the listed recipe that serves six,
I add one crushed clove of garlic, about 1 
tablespoon of dried basil, and 1/2 tablespoon
of dried thyme.   You don't want to overpower
the original recipe's taste, just add some more
subtleties.

If you're having problems with mushy rice, make sure to use parboiled rice.  I've never had the problem with mushy rice when I've used parboiled.

Loved this soup...added some more flavors to it...I cooked onions with the chicken and placed them in the soup, along with thyme, pepper, a little salt  and flavored chicken broth..I used four cans instead of three, I also waited till the last half an hour to put the rice in the pot.    It came out delicious, everyone enjoyed it...along with garlic bread.  It is lite but yet hits the spot on a cold New England day.  Thank you for the easy yet great recipe!

I had chicken rice soup in mind today and found this wonderful recipe. Had to change a few things based on what was on hand. No frozen veggies so used 1 zucchini, 2 carrots, 2 celery, 1/2 onion, 1/2 lemon (squeezed juice), added 1/2T basil, 1T thyme, 1 clove garlic. The rice soaked up most of the broth so added 4 additional cups of water + 2 cubes of MSG free chicken bouillon. Perfection! My new favorite. *thanks*

DELICIOUS! I added a little black pepper and garlic powder for some extra flavor. I would also recommend reserving the chicken and rice til the last hour or two of cooking, as the chicken disintegrates and the rice soaks up too much liquid and gets mushy. But otherwise I love it!

Good. But when preparing, I would cut back on the lemon seasoning.  Also, for an interesting twist, used flavored chicken broth.

I threw all the ingredients in my slow cooker before I left for work.  However, when my husband got home less than 5 hours later, the rice was nothing but mush.  I don't recommend this recipe.

GREAT RECIPE! FAMILY ASKED FOR MORE.  NEXT TIME I WILL TRY ADDING RICE 1 1/2 HOURS BEFORE FINISHED SO THAT RICE DOESN'T TURN MUSHY.

Followed others advice about adding 1 Tsp minced garlic, 1 Tbsp basil, 1 Tsp Thyme, 1  tsp celery salt, and 1 tsp dried Parsley. Left out the rice and replaced it with spinach and cheese Tortellini. I did not add the noodles until the last 25 minutes. Was really tasty! My boyfriend had 3 bowls full!!

My family is in LOVE with this soup!  We had it for the first time today and my husband can't stop talking about it.  My two year old even asked for more after eating a very hearty portion.  I took the advice of some others and added a clove of garlic, 1 T of dried basil, and 1/2 T of dried thyme.  In addition, I didn't have the lemon and herb seasoning on hand, so I added 1/8 t black pepper, 1-2 T dried oregano, 1-2 t bottled lemon peel.  I didn't have the time to use the slow cooker, so I just mixed everything, but the brown rice I used, together in my dutch oven, brought it to a boil, then reduced the heat and let it simmer for about 20 minutes or so.  Then I added the cooked brown rice to the pot and let it cook for another 10 minutes.  Absolutely superb!  Would give it more than 5 stars if I could!

Awesome recipe! I added more broth as people have suggested, I also used 3 boxes of long grain wild rice with seasonings (been sitting in the cabinets for a while and I wanted to use them up), I added them about an hour before serving and it turned out perfect. This also made it more of a chicken and rice dish so if you want more of a soup - use less rice. I believe me and my wife got 4 or 5 meals out of this one, it went a long way! Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good, butI would definitely add the rice at the end next time!  I don't mind mushy, but the rice turned to liquid.  I also added Thyme and Basil.

I had mush, too, and I added the rice 1-1/2 hours before serving.  My husband ate it, but no one else would.  I thought it needed more spices.

My family loves it.  I add basil and thyme, also.  I cook the rice separately and also cook noodles.  I just put the rice or noodle in the bowl and then put the soup over it!

I substituted more celery and some fresh baby carrots for the frozen mixed vegetables.  I added about a tablespoon of dried chopped onion, a couple cloves of minced then smashed garlic, lots of black pepper and a few shakes of cayenne pepper.  I screwed up the rice (made it ahead of time in a separate pan, but it turned to mush), so I just dipped some homemade sweet rolls in the soup.  The contrast of the sweet and spicy was really tasty!  I will definitely make this again and continue playing with the ingredients.

This was pretty good. Like others suggested, I just made minute rice & put it in for 10 minutes or so at the end. I also put celery seasoning in because I hate to buy celery & have the rest go to waste. It tasted a little more like canned soup as opposed to homemade soup to me, but I would still definitely make it again. It's great for a workday soup.

I would love to give this 4.5 stars, but that isn't an option.  This is very tasty soup, and convenient to assemble in the crock pot.  This is ready after 6 hours, and I am concerned about letting the vegetables get too soft if it goes to 8.  Fortunately, I'm at home today to monitor it, and I'm going to put it in the fridge until dinner (two hours away).  I think the best way to do this is to cook the rice separately.  I followed the recipe, with these exceptions:  I added 1 tsp. minced garlic; I added 1/2 c. chopped onion; I used brown rice; and I used uncooked, diced chicken.  Because I have a 5 qt. cooker, I deleted the water and added another can of chicken broth.  Great idea for a busy day!

Super simple!  I used two raw chicken breasts and shredded them right before eating.  Added instant rice for the last 10 minutes.  Only criticism is that I would have liked a tad more salt.

Instead of rice I added Pasta and it was really good. I had read the other ratings and did hold off on putting the pasta in until the end and it was great. I have a picky husband and 2 year old and they both ate it all up.

I make this often because it's one of the few ways I can get my toddler to eat both meat and vegetables (though I'm not sure if there are any nutrients left in the veggies after simmering in a crockpot all day), and I enjoy it too. I use different seasonings depending on what I have, and it always comes out tasting good.

This is the worst soup I've ever made or eaten.  My husband will normally eat anything.  He asked me "not" to save leftovers.  Remainder went into garbage disposal and recipe went into trash. What a waste of ingredients and my time. I would have given it lower than one star if that had been possible.

This recipe was very easy, however, I thought it was a bit bland.  I had placed the leftovers into "lunch ready" containers, but by the next day the rice had soaked up the rest of the liquid.  It was more like "chicken flavored rice and vegetables."  Of all the leftovers in the fridge...it is still waiting to be chosen.  :(

Had the mushy rice problem too, but was still very tasty and easy to make.  Couldn't find Lemon Herb seasoning, used Lemon Pepper with Onion and Garlic instead.

People complain about the mushy rice - I really liked it.  It thickened the soup up more like a stew.  I used "Better Than Bouillon" and added water instead of using broth and added no spices to get a more bland dish.     This is being fed to someone with serious stomach issues.  This came out smelling so good in the morning, I was hoping it would be rejected so I could have more!  It was not.  It's okay, this is a new staple in the cooking repertoire.
