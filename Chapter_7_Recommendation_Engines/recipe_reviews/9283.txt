This is the one my mom fixed. We packed it into a wax-paper lined angel food cake pan & after a few days pushed it out & peeled the paper off. Also, no serious chopping on the fruit. The larger pieces are prettier when sliced. It's like candy cake! Delicious!!

I'd consider halving the quantity of this recipe for our family. Even though it keeps well, it's very large and took us a long time to eat. Great party food.

Unbaked fruit cake has been my favorite treat since childhood. I've made it many times in the past and this meets my expectations. I usually add a bit of spiced or dark rum for flavor. Great with that holiday egg nog or wassail for traditional parties or small family gatherings. I have generally used regular evaporated milk in place of condensed for a less sweet base.
