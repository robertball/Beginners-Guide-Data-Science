Not bad for a quick and easy breakfast, but don't use all that ice... I froze my banana instead and added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon along with the nutmeg. Overall, pretty good with those changes.

Easy to prepare but lacks flavor. Would be better if you add a few tablespoons of sugar to the recipe.

Quick and easy to make. My 4 y/o and her friend liked it. I thought it lacked taste. I would make again but add either more fruit or some sweetener. Good base for smoothies.

I really liked this recipe. I used a little bit more nutmeg than I think was intended, but the flavor really came through nicely!! I'm kind of lazy, so I crushed 5 ice cubes in the blender before adding the other ingredients instead of the "crushed ice".. and it gave the smoothie a slushie-type feel, without being too icy. I will definatly make it again!

I agree with a the other post...IT LACKS FLAVOR. I added some sugar to it but still bland. Maybe needs some peanut butter or more bananas or some other fruit, but something I want make again.

Very good Banana smoothie, but I spruced it up with a tablespoon of honey and a large pinch of cinnamon.  I LOVE CINNAMON.

This is a pretty drink, so I submitted a photo. That said, it really needs some work as it's bland and too runny. I'd suggest freezing the banana and maybe cutting the ice back. I added sugar and used freshly ground nutmeg, but it was still bland. After the photo was taken, I poured it back in the blender and added some frozen strawberries and honey before re-blending. The resulting drink was delicious, thick, and creamy. It was, however not the recipe as stated.

I made this using skim milk, 1/8 tsp. cinnamon instead of nutmeg (personal preference), and only 1 cup ice. I also added Vanilla Bean Torte protein powder and drank the entire thing. A very nice Weight Watchers breakfast for 3 PointsPlus.

I read some reviewers' concern about too much ice, so I added only 1-1/2 cups, and it still was pretty liquid-y.  I'd recommend you start with 1 cup and if necessary, you can add more.  Just depends on the texture you're looking for I suppose, and I like my smoothies icy.  I used vanilla soy milk which I had in the fridge (I like it on cereal), and I think next time I make this, I'll use 1-1/2 bananas.  Liked this, it's healthy for you (not loaded with frozen yogurt which bumps up calories), and I'll definitely make this again.  For anybody on Weight Watchers Plus, this calculates to 3 points.

My Mom made this growing up. Great recipe, but, needs tweaking. This is how we make it: 2 bananas, 1 tray ice, about a cup of milk, 2 shakes of nutmeg, and SUGAR, 1/4 cup. For anyone who hated this recipe, try it again like this. It's sweet and creamy and delicious!

This is wonderful!! I used about 1/8 tsp nutmeg & only used 1 cup of crushed ice. I also used 2 tbsp + 2 tsp Splenda. It was great! Thanks so much.

This is soo good! I did change some though. Like the others that reviewed I did not use ice. I froze the banana. I also added some cinnamon (like a pinch or so) and about 1 tsp of brown sugar. It was perfect.

I was expecting a wonderful banana drink after reading the reviews, but I was dissapointed in this recipe.  The flavor just was not there for me.  Maybe my banana was not ripe enough?  I don't think I will try it again.

I love the simplicity of this recipe. As a banana lover, banana smoothies are my favourite kind of smoothie. This recipe tastes good because it's creamy and sweet.

Great! Except I would add a little sugar. Oh, and if you make it with a hand-held mixer, like a Bamix, then it amkes it extra creamy and smooth!

It was super yummy.  I added pumpkin spice, spices instead, because I didn’t have nutmeg. I added a little less ice and a little more banana. It wasn’t very sweet though. But pretty good. Maybe it was because my banana wasn’t quit ripe. I added a little less milk. Because I didn’t want it watery. Lol. Over all great flavor. Great snack. Great for any time of the year
