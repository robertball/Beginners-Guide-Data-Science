I can't thank you enough for this recipe.  My five  year old grandson is allergic to milk products, eggs, corn and chicken. We live in a very rural community without the luxury of large supermarkets or health food stores.   We have to be very careful with reading ingredients and substituting in recipes.  Finding "treat" recipes for him that acutally taste good and don't have a weird texture has not been easy.  So until I tried these, he had never had a doughnut.  And these are terrific.  Even his cousins who usually turn their noses at "Parker proof" treats, loved these sprinkled with a little powdered sugar.  The second time I made them, we added a little cinnamon to the batter and they are like a banana bread donut.  I plan on trying other fruits like applesauce and pumpkin in the future.  Thank you so very much for sharing.

LOVE this recipe! My husband is Samoan, and he loves it too. However, I tried making them like regular pancakes once (in a frying pan just coated with veg. oil) and they turned out AMAZING! Crispy on the outside, perfectly melt in your mouth in the middle. They are hard to flip, but if you can master that, they will be the best pancakes you've ever had! We serve them with melted butter, strawberries, and powdered sugar.

These are great! The first time I made them, I went exactly by the recipe, but I thought that they needed a little more banana flavor. I added a third banana in the second batch, and cut the water down a little bit.   I didn't have any problem with them coming out raw. I followed the directions and made sure that the oil was approximately 350 degrees (I used a candy thermometer), and dropped the batter in by slightly less than 1/4 cup fulls. I cooked the first side for 3 minutes, turned them over, and cooked for 2 more minutes (I used a timer.)   Some of the panikekes wanted to turn themselves over prematurely, so I had to hold them under the oil with tongs.  I sprinkled these with confectioners sugar, and they came out perfect! They are also fun to make!

I have never made any sort of fried dough and found this recipe to try.  It was amazingly easy and beyond delicious!  I posted photos to my facebook of them and several ppl asked for the recipe based on looks alone!  If they only knew how tasty it is!!  You do not need 6 cups of oil.  I used a large frying pan and filled it about half way...that was plenty...just flip them over when they appeared to be golden. I sprinkled mine with cinnamon sugar when they came out mmm  TIP:  don't cover them up until they have completely cooled!  Otherwise, they just become soggy.

Great, easy breakfast recipe when there's no milk in the house!  Make sure to use less than 1/4 cup batter.  When I used an exact 1/4 cup, or a scant 1/4 cup, it was still pretty gooey in the middle and that was after making sure that it was a darker golden brown all around.  On the second try, I used maybe a little more than 1/8 cup and it was perfect.  And I did make sure the oil was exactly 350 degrees with my candy/deep fryer thermometer.  You could even make just a tbsp. at a time for little bite-size "doughnuts."  mmmm.  Yummy!

My family loved these. My mother didn't put banana in mine as a child, so this was a fun change! The banana flavor isn't overwhelming. Definitely don't make these a scant 1/4 cup, they will never cook in the middle before the outside burns. A TBS or scant TBS is better -- you'll get 35 to 40 almost golf-ball sized panikeke. That was too much for my family of 5, and they aren't as good the next day so I would keep that in mind and reduce your recipe if you need to. Thanks for the recipe!

These were super yummy.  Definitely drop the dough in smaller portions.  They won't cook through otherwise.  I used about a half a tablespoon of dough.  They are ready to flip when the edges get hard, like a pancake.  I didn't have any vanilla extract so I used almond.  Make sure the oil temp is just below 350.

This is delicious!  Found it to be a bit time consuming but worth it! I waited to heat the oil once the dough was ready, next time I'll heat the oil while preparing the dough.  I used a sauce pan with 6 cups of oil, but they kept sticking to the bottom.  We just lifted them up gently and that was fine, but wondering if that is normal or if there is a way to prevent that!  Thanks for the recipe!  AWESOME flavor!

Exact measurement of the listed ingredients does not yield the thick, sticky dough intended. It yields a batter with the consistency of a thick soup. I've had to keep adding flour and some more baking powder in order to 'fix' the recipe the best I could.

These are delicious. I opted to not deep fry them, and instead made them into a version of pancakes on the griddle. They are so good. They are quite sweet and could probably be made with less sugar. Will probably make these again and again.

The moment I saw this recipe I had to try it! Growing up my mom made us panikeke for breakfast or just as a snack, minus the bananas. This was my first attempt to make panikeke and it was a hit with my kids!!! This recipe is great and I will definitely be making more again in the near future...

Pretty easy. This taste kinda like my moms called 'cekocok' or something like that. It is easier to use a tablespoon size cookie scooper and cut down the recipe because it makes alot (that's if you are using tablespoon size).

I love Samoan panikekes! My mum adds a can of pineapple pieces (drained) and it's delicous. I'm looking forward to trying the cinnamon addition suggested for a contemporary twist on a traditional dessert

Just like my exes mother used to make :D om nom

I used wholemeal flour, mixed the baking soda with some vinegar because i didn't have baking powder, and eyeballed the liquid because of the wholemeal flour.  Oh and i made them as pancakes.  I will def be making this again.  It is part of my recipes now.  Thank you! :D

Malo lava and thank you for sharing your recipe Koki! 
I llove it! I tried it a couple of times small tweaks to suit and they were absolutely scrumptious! I only put 1 cup of sugar and instead of using a second spoon put the spoon in a cup of hot water and dip the spoon in the cup between each scoop of mixture - slides right off!

Taste wise these are pretty good. Make sure you make them small, otherwise, they won’t cook through. It’ll remain raw inside.

Awesome recipe. Made this for the kids Christmas morning with a little chocolate sauce for dipping.  Extremely easy to make, and very delicious.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated except I made my balls of dough about an 1/8th of a cup like several others recommended. I rolled them in sugar and cinnamon and that was too sweet so I tried putting maple syrup on them, yuck. I am also not a banana fan and I thought the banana flavor was overpowering. If I make these again, I will use pureed pears or maybe even crushed pineapple and just sprinkle with powdered sugar. I also think I will try almond milk instead of water.

I was very excited to make these, but unfortunately they turned out to be dense and absorbed a lot of oil. .
Many of them were uncooked in the centre, even when I made them smaller.
Love the idea of a quick & easy recipe like this (especially because it's vegan), but it just didn't turn out for me, sorry.

This is my fourth time making panikeke using your recipe. Thank you for sharing & posting. I loved eating panikeke but always too scared or didn't know how to make them.

Great recipe! Reminds me of chamorro banana doughnut (bonuelos aga). I would stick to this recipe because i love the added vanilla extract. Going to try to make this with mango next time. Thank you for the recipe!

Yum! I used 4 bananas only because I needed to use them up. I was originally gonna make bread until I came upon this great recipe. My kids call them banana bites! We sprinkle powder sugar on them.

Not what I expected. I followed the recipe, usuing 2 large very ripe bananas, but all I wound up with were balls of grease-saturated dough with only a slight banana flavor.  I was so disappointed.  I stopped after frying half of the batter and dumped it in my waffle iron. The outcome was still pretty flavorless, but a lot less greasy.
