I'm certainly impressed with this recipe, especially coming from a microwave. Mine cooked to the right consistency in about 5 1/2 minutes. It will be thin when it's done, but if it can coat the back of your spoon, it's done. The curd will thicken up as it cools. The written recipe made almost exactly 3 half-pint jars worth. I used high-quality bottled lemon juice and it was a bit too tangy. I think using fresh juice would make a more mellow-tasting curd. Overall, an excellent recipe worth saving. TIP - strain the curd through a fine-mesh seive to remove all the white egg bits to ensure a perfectly smooth curd. **Update - The curd from the original recipe is quite grainy after it's refridgerated. I tested the recipe 2 more times and ended up with a wonderfully smooth, thicker, richer curd that can easily rival the ones you buy in gourmet stores. Use 3 whole eggs plus 2 egg yolks and increase the sugar to 1 1/4 cup. It won't be two sweet but will mellow out the tartness. I still cooked it 5 1/2 min. and it was perfect. Try it.

This was AWSOME!  I rolled out premade pie crusts and cut it with a cookie cutter to fit mini cupcake pan, baked it for 10 minutes and filled the little pastry cups with this lemon curd. They were GREAT! I never made such a quick and easy dessert before!

If I didn't see this for myself I would have never believed it.  I followed the directions exactly, used the ingredients exactly, and in two minutes flat (seriously!) I had a beautiful, sweet, tart, fresh homemade lemon curd.  Remarkable.  I used this for the lemon filling in "Lemon Lush," also from this site. I am really impressed.

This was great! As I like my lemon curd really smooth (with no crumbly/crunchy bits of zest that is), I used a vegetable peeler to make large ribons of zest, which I could then easily remove once the lemon curd had cooled a little. Thanks!

I have made this recipe on several occasions, both for personal use and to give as gifts. I use it to fill tarts, pour it warm over pound cake and as a spread on muffins and my favorite~just plain in custard cups. Everyone that has tasted it has asked for the recipe. Thank you for submitting such a tasty and easy recipe.

Great Recipe and easy to make!!  If you don't have enough lemon juice, unsweetened Kool-aid lemon ade flavor adds a great flavor to the curd.  To the viewer who asked if Splenda works, yes it does, however, I added 1 1/3 cups of Splenda and 1 Tablespoon of corn starch just to make sure.  Make sure the corn starch is added to cold liquid. I added mine to the lemon juice.  Also, I left out the egg whites as they are unnecessary and thre is no chance of cooked egg whites in the cooked curd.  A great place to use the egg whites is in a great recipe for homemade marshmallows.  I found it on the the food network under "Hot Cocoa and Homemade Marshmallows".  They are really easy to make (no temperature gauge)and made by Tyler Florence, and are they wonderfully soft!!! I will try to post the recipe or hopefully someone else will if I don't get around to it.

MMM!! soo good and sooo easy!!
but I set my microwave to 50% and didnt need to do it for more than 2 mins..I tampered the eggs with heated butter,sugar and lemon juice and that prevented the egg from being cooked into bits.. whenever I could see the mixture bubble slightly, I would shut the microwave and beat the lemon curd.. 

This is was too good! I ate it with vanilla cupcakes. Thanks!

I was worried aboout the prep in the microwave, but the curd came out beautifully.  I did start it out in the microwave with the butter solid in chunks but it melted long before the curd came together so it didn't matter (one less dirty dish).  I also did the first three minutes on full power and then the rest on half power, because I have a powerful microwave.  So simple I will make it more often!

This recipe is AWESOME!!! It took 2 MINUTES in my microwave to make!!  I didn't temper my eggs so I did have some small cooked egg bits.  I did strain the curd through a fine mesh strainer.  To see if this would turn out I scaled the recipe to 5 servings using 1 egg.  I have bought lemon curd (that was very expensive) from specialty stores before.  Not anymore!!  Can't wait to make the entire serving recipe and give as gifts.

This was really good and simple to make aswell!  I spooned it over vanilla ice cream for a quick but delicous sunday night dessert for the family.  I also used it spooned over To Die For Blueberry Muffins(also on this sight) for dessert in a hurry.  Don't be fooled by how runny it looks in the microwave, because it thickens as soon as it cools!

I've made this recipe too many times to count, and it always turns out fantastic.  I've never had a problem with curdling.  I don't know if it makes a difference or not, but after adding the sugar to the eggs, I let it sit for 10-15 min so that the sugar dissolves a little bit more.  I microwave the butter so that it's half-melted, then stir it until it's all liquid, and let it cool a bit before adding it to the egg-lemon mixture.  I also really like that the recipe is so easy to scale down, and frequently if I need a small amount for a topping, I'll make 1/3 or 2/3 of a recipe.  It almost seems like cheating that the best lemon curd I've ever made is also, by far, the easiest!

Loved the Curd.  Here's what I did. I took half of the curd and beat a half of a package of cream cheese into it.  I baked Pepperidge Farms puff pastry shells, let them cool, removed the cap from the shell and filled them with the curd and cream cheese mixture.  I topped each shell with the plain curd.  I put each shell on a small white dessert plate and dropped another dollop of curd beside it in a little design.  Made me feel like a gourmet chef.  Ha!  Thanks so much for the recipe. Oh, I caught my Mother-in-Law eating the left overs with a gigantic spoon.

This recipe is awesome.  I cut the recipe to '11' servings cause I didn't want to make as much as the original. with this amount, I needed 2 eggs, 1/3 cup of butter, and 2/3 cup + 1 teaspoon of sugar, and same measurement for lemon Juice which for me turned out to be 2 nice plump lemons. Two lemons was also what it took to get the right amount of grated peel.  I put it in the microwave for one minute at a time, and stirred briskly after each minute...for a total of 5 minutes. It firmed up completely in the fridge.  I waited overnight until I tasted it since another reviewer had commented that it tasted 'eggy' if eaten too soon.  Well...it was absolutely delicious!!! It is true that it is as yummy as any gourmet lemon curd that you may have paid big bucks for (pardon the grammer). I decided to create a gourmet flavor for my home-made yogurt so I added a huge dolop of it to my 'berry' yogurt and it was out of this world. So thank you for a wonderful recipe! I agree with another reviewer that if you don't like the grated lemon feeling in your mouth, you may want to get lemon peels into the curd that can be removed when you serve it.

I was so disappointed in this at first because I was making it for a small breakfast party with friends and it tasted rather "eggy" so I thought I'd over cooked.  Well, then I strained it to get the bigger bits of lemon zest out and the eggy taste was barely there, but still enough to bug me.  HOWEVER, after a night in the fridge it was wonderful.  Fabulous!  Amazing!  No eggy taste, just wonderful, tart, sweet, lemon!  I followed the recipe exactly and I will make again...maybe today.  Sadly, due to an oven malfunction, the scones I was to serve it with didn't turn out, so it wasn't served either, but I managed to eat the whole batch on other things ALL BY MYSELF, in just days :)  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Delicious and easy to make! Great to use for easy lemon cur bars or filling for cakes
Update: I've been making this recipe for years- it turns out perfect each time.  melt the butter in the glass bowl first. Then grate the zest right in. Pop,it in the fridge while you juice the lemons (just a few minutes.  Then beat the eggs right into the melted butter while it's still warm but not too hot. This will temper the eggs so no little egg bits. Whisk in sugar and lemon juice and follow the cooking directions. perfection! 
It's delicious mixed with plain Greek yogurt and fresh strawberries

This is great!  A few stirs in the microwave and its done.  Don't worry about it's runniness when hot, it firms right up when it cools.  I filled mini-tartlet shells and they were delish!!!

This had a very nice taste but never firmed up after cooling so I reheated and added some cornstarch mixed with lemon juice and brought it to a boil. after cooling it was perfect.

Can't believe great lemon curd is this easy - but it is. Besure to take the white egg cord out before cooking. I ended up having to strain my to get them out.  Microwave your lemons for 10 -20 seconds to get all the juice out of them.  I doubled the recipe without issues.  This is very tart/tangy. If you like it less so, the previous suggestion of an additional 1/4 cup sugar will fix it up. YUMMY!

I made this, cut down to 5 servings, and it was AWESOME. I didn't need it, just wanted to see if it would work, for future reference (hehehe) and so I ate some with a spoon (awesome) and stirred the rest into homemade lemon pudding. AWESOME.

I just tried this for the first time tonight. This recipe is about to become big in my life. I agree with other reviewers that it is on the tart side, but that's how I like my lemon, especially if you are going to serve it with something sweet. Definitely strain it through a fine mesh sieve to catch the bits of cooked egg and lemon zest that doesn't feel so good in the mouth. Silky, smooth, and the butter gives it a great richness. I would never have believed it, but this recipe ROCKS.

I used the juice of 1 frozen lemon.  I skipped the zest as the skin was too wet to grate.  I topped up the fresh juice with store bought lime juice.  (I didn't have any lemon juice.)  I followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  I microwaved at 70 percent in 1 minute intervals.  It took close to 10 minutes but the effect was pure creamy curd.  No lumps or anything!  You can spend the time straining through cheese cloth or the extra time at the microwave but on low power.  I never did see it boil as by the time it got that hot, the curd was already so thick.  I filled store bought pastry shells.  It was a hit with the kids and our family.  Such an easy dessert to make and great for company.  We like it very tangy and it was.  It's better than the store-bought lemon curd tarts I've been craving and buying on impulse at the groceries.  This recipe is a keeper!

I tried this last week with Meyer lemons and oh, my, is it delicious.  I made 2 batches because I had quite a few lemons and hesitated to try doubling the recipe.  I'm glad I made the 2 separate batches because it gave me an opportunity to test the time required to get the curd the right thickness.

I cooked the first batch about 8 minutes, stirring with a whisk after each minute.  In my opinion, it never did get quite thick enough, but it tasted great.

On the second batch, I cooked it about 4 minutes and then didn't get back to stir it for perhaps another five minutes.  It was nearly right.  So I cooked it one more minute (a total of 5) and left it unstirred after the final minute.  It came out what I thought was the perfect thickness.  Both batches were quite usable after a night in the fridge, but I think the second batch was the best consistency.    

I think perhaps I overcooked the first batch.  Shorter cook time, and not stirring at the end, seemed to be the key to a better consistency.

This got rave reviews as part of a cake I took to a ladies' dessert event.  Several asked for the recipe.  I will definitely be making this curd again!

Easy and delicious!  I followed exactly but used bottled lemon juice and skipped the lemon zest (I didn't have any on hand) and it still turned out soooo good!  Definitely a keeper!

This is great. I did take another reviewers suggestion and added a little cornstarch as I too like a thicker consistency.

This is probably the one recipe here at allrecipes.com that I use the most.  It is incredible with fresh lemon juice and zest, but in a pinch I have used bottled juice and skipped the zest.  My family and I love it either way!  You can use this lemon curd in a lot of different ways:  cookie or cake filling, in popovers with whipped cream, try it with the lemon curd bars (recipe on this site) or just eat it plain!!!  It is usually fully cooked in 4-6 minutes in my microwave.  I highly recommend straining the mixture prior to pouring into jars, in case some small bits of cooked egg whites remain.  Do try this recipe, though, you will love it!

Thank you so much for this recipe. Turned out great. Sour and sweet. Near the end of the cooking time I got nervous so I  put the power at 50% 1 min increments. What you are looking for is the milky yellow turn to a brighter  yellow coating the back of the spoon. And it's done.  Hope that helps. I thought I would need 6-8 lemons to make 1 cup of juice. Just wanted to share some juicing tips with others that worked great for me.  Put all your washed lemons in the microwave and zap to 10-20 sec ( I did 20). Then I rolled the lemon on the counter firmly. Cut in half and placed the lemon in between the handle part of tongs. Make sure u have your hand over the open end of the lemon and do this over a large bowl. Squeeze the handles. The amount of juice was amazing. Only used 5 lemons for over 1 cup of juice.  Got this trick from Rachel Ray.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  So easy and delicious.  I made 3 batches last week and gave 8 oz jars to several friends for Christmas gifts.  Everyone loves it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I have made lemon curd for a few years using the microwave.  The purists will tell you that the mixture will curdle but with care I have not found this happening and it is so quick compared to the stovetop.  I tried this recipe and it is excellent.  The only changes that I have made are that I use 30 second increments rather than 1 minute as the mixture starts to thicken, lower the power on the microwave and beat furiously with a wire whisk to get maximum smoothness.  I never use bottled juice, only fresh.

I would have given this 5 stars, but needed quite abit more sugar and I added another egg. I'm sure the amount of sugar depends on the type of lemons used (such as meyer lemons for example.)  Still an easy fix. Thanks for the recipe.

I did exactly as MommyFromSeattle did. In fact I doubled the recipe my first try. I needed to cook it for 11 minutes since it was a double recipe.  The Lemon Curd is simply wonderful! I love quick and easy that tastes like it took at lot of effort. :) Thanks so much for sharing.

Here was my take on it: 1/2 cup sugar, 3 eggs, juice of 2 lemons, zest of 2 lemons, 9 tablespoons unsalted butter -----> PERFECTION!!!!  This was my first attempt at lemon curd and with such success here I will ever even try another recipe.

WOW!  I used the juice of 2 lemons, and their zest.  Then I used bottled juice to make up the rest of the 1 cup lemon juice.  Perfect!! Served this with a big bowl of fresh blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries.

I was skeptical, but I have repented. This is the easiest, tastiest lemon curd recipe. We make it every St. Patty's day with our soda farls.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I use a teaspoon+ to flavor my plain greek yogurt in the morning and the local grocery store stopped selling the brand I liked....so I was looking for an alternative.  I made as directed but dropped the the recipe down to 5 servings ( checked and stirred every 30 seconds due to the smaller amt.)  This is definitely a keeper!
Thanks.

It's a great recipe. I didn't have butter so used margine and heated that with the lemon juice ( didn't use zest). While that heated for about a minute, I beated the sugar and eggs together, and slowly added in the heated lemon juice mix... then heated the whole thing 4x 1minute each/stir...no scramble egg pieces and taste great.

This recipe was extremely easy. I used the lemon curd to pipe into cupcakes that i made with lemon frosting. Everyone loved the tartness of the lemon curd with the sweetness of the cupcakes. :)

My Mom used to stand over the double-boiler making lemon curd when I was a child, and this recipe (we made together over the holidays) is just as good as that ! Love it on toast or put into mini filo cases.

Very very yummy..took me a little longer in the microwave than other reviewers..about 7-8 mins. or so..probably because I added a little more lemon juice than called for - was very tangy - I used it in the lemon bar recipe (from this site). Easy, great consistency and a great way to use up the Meyer lemons from my tree.

Delicious and very easy.  We used ours to dip Beignets into but it made more than we needed so we canned it up and are thinking of trying a few recipes other posters used!  The only thing different i did was use Meyer lemons but that is just our preferred lemon :)

Double delicious!  I used half sugar/half Splenda with 1/4 tsp corn starch. Couldn't tell the diff from all sugar. Have made this several times and if stir every min with a balloon whisk won't have any problems with egg bits. Mine comes out smooth every time. Good enough to eat in a bowl like pudding!!! Can't stop raving over it....

This is amazing- I used it to top off the mini cheesecake recipe from this site. I used a vegetable peeler to zest lemons, then placed the zest and lemon juice in the food processor and pulsed until the peel was pretty fine (I found that much easier than zesting all three lemons). I then added everything into the sugar and eggs.  After the 5 min in the microwave, mine was done. I strained it through a sieve and the finished product was a tart, and refreshing lemon curd. I will definitely use this again-- it was so EASY!!!! Thank you!

i changed the serving size to 5 so i could use 1 egg. i started with a room temp. egg and didnt have a problem with curdling. this was pretty good even though i used frozen bottled lemon juice. and left out the zest since i didnt have any lemons.

Another 5-star review for this wonderfully simple recipe.  I've been making my lemon curd on the stove for years using the Joy of Cooking recipe and when I saw this microwave version, the snooty side of me said, "how can this possibly compare?"  Well, it does.  Came out perfectly the first time.  The taste is not too different from the stuff I've been making for years (though it was a little more to the sweet side than the tangy side) and it was soooo easy..  My only variation was that my lemons only yielded about 2/3 cup of fresh lemon juice so I topped it off with the bottled stuff to bring it to the requisite 1 cup.. When I make it again, I may put in another egg yolk or two and see if I can up the richness just a tiny bit.  My Personal preference here is that the straining step is not to be skipped.  I think this is particularly true if you plan to give this as a gift.  You'll be surprised at all the nasty looking bits that a quick run through the seive takes out..plus it improves the final consistency.  If you haven't already got one, next time you are at the supermarket, you can pick up a cheapo strainer for less than the cost of a jar of prepared lemon curd and you'll have the piece of equipment forever!

Love the ease of this for making lemon curd. I did end up thickening it with some cornstarch slurry on the stove as I was looking for a firmer texture. It was pretty sour and could have used a little more sugar. I'll make this again now that I know how! Thanks!

The ease of this recipe for me was what earned it the 3 stars, but I was disappointed with the taste. Mine was WAY too tart, even after adding another 1/2 cup of sugar. Perhaps my lemons were just too tart, as they came fresh from a neighbor's tree and not the grocery store. I also added a little slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken it and left it in the fridge overnight to get the consistency that I wanted. Even though the taste was not what I was looking for, I am willing to try this again.

Really easy and good! I substituted 1/2 C honey in place of the 1 C sugar, used ~1/3 C butter instead of 1/2 C, and omitted the lemon zest. And used 3/4 C lemon juice instead of 1 C. Still came out really well -- less INTENSE -- definitely milder.

What a great recipe!  I love to make this for scones or sandwich cookies, but I also use it for layering in between lemon cake.  Try reserving a little and mixing it in with a cream cheese frosting for a haunting lemon flavor.  Yum! Also, I have scaled this recipe WAY up and it still works fine.  Just have patience at the microwave it will take longer.

Holy cow!! I'm in love!! I was so intrigued by this recipe I started mixing the egg and sugar (adjusting for a third of a recipe) and realized I only have limes. Go for it, my hubby said!! So juiced and zested the limes. Since it was a smaller amount, stirred every 30 seconds instead of every 60 seconds. In two minutes it was done! I seriously went into the fridge a couple times last night just to dip a spoon into it and eat it, lol!! Going to make some quick tart shells today and top with a bit whipped cream for an easy but impressive dessert. Yes, the zest does give it some texture but does it look beautiful in the glass jar!! This might be the best recipe on this site!!

I have been making this lemon curd for several years and it is easy to make and tastes really good.  I make exactly per the recipe, using fresh lemon juice, and it has never failed. Always turns out with the right blend of tart and sweetness. Takes 5 minutes in my microwave. Delicious!

Perfect as written. Simple, quick, and great taste. It took 8 large lemons (not very juicy) to get a full cup of juice although I saw a range of one to 6 lemons depending on other reviewers. CATSEO, thank you for sharing this fine recipe.

OMG!  Is this ever delicious.  Have never made lemon curd before and I was amazed at how easy this was.  It was a godsend, too, becaucs due to back problems, I find it very difficult to stand at a double boiler for a prolonged period of time.  The curd was lovely on lightly-buttered "Cranberry-Orange Scones" (from this site) and also on toasted English muffins.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe---I will be making it again and again.

VERY yummy and easy to make!  It makes a lot of lemon curd and it does rise/bubble up when it heats so make sure your bowl is big enough to accommodate that. I make it to eat with the simple scones from this site (the footnoted variations at the bottom...not the raisins) and the whipped cream recipe also from this site.  YUMMY!

This was very good and easy to make. I gave it four stars because I changed the recipe as another suggested.  I also left out the zest.  I prefer a smooth curd.  My lemons were very tangy so next time I will add less lemon juice and a little water.

This is amazing stuff!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very well.  I microwaved for about 6 minutes, stirring after each minute.  This was delicious on blueberry muffins.  I also used it as a filling for lemon cupcakes.

This is absolutely delicious--so tasty and so easy.  My husband and I love lemon, and this tastes very natural and full of lemon flavor.  It was fast and easy to prepare.  I strained it right after microwaving to remove the large bits of rind.  I made thumbprint cookies and used this on top--fantastic.  I still have some and will put it on plain yogurt as a snack.  One of our new favorites!

I have made lemon curd before and it always came out nice but I'd have to strain it through a sieve ... well, no more.  This was so easy and frankly tastes better than the double boiler version and is a whole lot faster.  One caveat ... watch the last 30 seconds as mine boiled over a bit in the micro.  I nuked it for a total of 3 and 1/2 minutes.  It came out perfect ...!  Now it will be my "go to" lemon curd.

In the end, this turned out okay for me.  But in the future I will stick to making my lemon curd on the stove.  I ended up microwaving this for close to 6 minutes, and it still hadn't thickened like I had hoped it would.  I also put this through a fine mesh strainer to make sure there were no bits of egg left behind.  After cooling and refrigerating, it did thicken a little more, but never did get to the consistency that I get when I cook it on the stove.

This recipe is outstanding.  It's so good & easy. (and I used bottled lemon juice!) I poked holes in a cake I had just baked & poured it over the top.  Can't wait to try with fresh lemons.  Thank you for posting!

Amazing. All the rave reviews are right. I usually buy lemon curd from Trader Joe's and this was just as good or better. Wow.  I made half a batch using one whole egg and one egg white. Worked great.

I found this recipe had too much lemon in it and did not thicken up to the consistency that I need for a filling in a cake.  Next time I make it I wall use only 1/2 cup lemon juice and I will add 1/4 cup corn starch to the sugar.

This was fantastic and great for those who love the full lemon taste.  I used this for the Lemon Filled Macaroon Tartlets on this site and it was perfect.  This is five stars for flavour, ease, texture and consistency of the lemon curd.

I made this using the proportions stated.  It's a little bit sweet for me, but wonderfully lemony and just tart enough.  As some suggested, I made sure the sugar & eggs were mixed well, and used a hand mixer.  It made for a foamy mixture, so when microwaving, I used 50% power for 1 minute at a time, whisking gently after each minute.  By the time it was cooked (~5-6 min), the foam had subsided and incorporated back into the mixture.  It was perfect in consistency after refrigerating.  No need for any further thickening.

Delish!!  I made this exactly as recipe stated except I left out the zest.  It was perfect.  I first tried it as suggested using more egg yolks but it was WAY too egg-y for my family.  I stirred with my immersion blender and when I strained it there were no egg bits in it.  I highly recommend this recipe

I *LOVE* lemon anything and this was fantastic and so easy!  I used it to fill mini tart shells and topped with fresh raspberries, put it on toast, dipped homemade graham crackers in it, mixed it with whipped cream and topped a slice of un-frosted cake....it is a seriously dangerous recipe!  It is a true keeper!

Mine took about 3 mins to cook. I tried this recipe two times before and over cooked it (it was horrible) this time I read through a few reviews to see if any one else had timing issue and since most peoples were done around 2 to three mins thats what I went with. I made a lime curd. It was delish! Good recipe you just have to figure out the time of your own microwave.

This was a perfect recipe. Delicious. I halved it and it came out just fine. It thickens after you put it in the fridge. This is one of the best things I have ever eaten.

As I didn't have any fresh lemons on hand, I used bottled lemon juice. Also, for some reason mine took FOREVER to microwave. It still turned out completely smooth and delicious, though. I put spoonfuls of it on top of freshly baked sugar cookies- everyone loved them!

Wonderful!  Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly.  I used it to fill phyllo cups and topped them with whipped cream and raspberries.

Super easy to make and darn near foolproof. I used this for filling in 
the Cream Cheese Thumbprint cookies.
Wow! Was that tasty. Will make again and

This recipe was fabulous!  I will admit that I was skeptical to say the least but it came together so quickly and easily.  Be patient as you stir and don't be discouraged if it seems too watery because it thickens up quite nicely as it cools.  It was a huge hit at my afternoon tea.  I'm planning to put small jars of this in my Christmas basket so I will obviously be making this again!

Microwaves and I do not mix well, so I was skeptical to try this recipe. Now it is my new go to. I got a nice texture and vibrant flavor with way less work than anything i've tried before. Awesome recipe!

The original recipe was okay and very tart. After making it, I tried the suggestion of MommyfromSeattle too. The extra bit of sugar helped mellow the tartness and the egg yolks added made it creamier like lemon bar topping. I ended up getting some small bits of cooked egg, so I used my strainer insert on the funnel I have. I have a high watt microwave, so I put it in for 35 second intervals. The flavor is great if you like very tart lemon curd. I like mine a little mellow when not with bars, so I added a little extra sugar.

I like this recipe's ratio of lemon juice and sugar--a bit tarter than some other lemon curd recipes.  I made this reciped on the stove, double quantities, and it came out beautifully.  It is a quick recipe! I even canned some of it--for using a little later. I used Meyer lemons and zest, too.

I use this recipe a LOT.  I found that I need to add a tbsp of cornstarch to get it thick enough for me, but I have to say that I like my curd to be pudding-like rather than spreadable.

I was looking through the reviews and found some said it had a weird taste.  The best advice I can give is to never let the curd come in contact with metal, which is why I love this recipe.  I put the ingredients in a plastic container and even stir with a plastic fork.  I don't even strain it because my strainers are metal.

OMG.   Delicious and Easy!  The sugar/lemon ratio was perfect.  Sweet, but not too sweet. I use it in plain yogurt, on toast and crackers with cream cheese.  I was very impressed and will be making again and again.

YUM, YUM, YUM! I never thought this would work, but IT DOES! I had a mix of lemons and limes to use up, so I guess I made more of a citrus curd, but it was wonderful. I halved the recipe just to try it, but wish I would've had extra lemons/limes on hand to make more. It took 4 mins. in my microwave, and it was still sort of on the thin side, so I just popped it into the freezer a bit (I was in a hurry for it, lol) and it thickened up nicely. I would LOVE to try this w/ oranges too. I've never made anything like this before, but I will be making it A LOT from now on...I can think of hundreds of things that I can do with it, including eating it right off the spoon, lol. A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

This came out amazing!  The only thing I did different from the original recipe was to only microwave it 30 seconds at a time in between stirring.  I didn't want the egg to curdle. So easy and so much better than spending $7 on a tiny jar at the grocery store.

OMG! I can't believe it. I love this.I would have never guess it would be as good as the non-microwave version. I am a convert!
For those of you who complained about egg bits, you can strain the mixture while still hot through a fine sieve and this will take out any lumps or bits.

With an overabundance of lemons, I tried this recipe.  I have never made lemon curd before, nor even thought of trying to, I assumed it would be too hard to make really good lemon curd.  Well, I was definitely wrong!  This recipe makes it so easy to make a fantastic lemon curd.  I have gotten rave reviews over this lemon curd.

Wish I knew about this a long time ago.  So much easier than slaving over a stove for 30 minutes.  I stirred every 30 seconds and it came out great.  Used to make molasses sandwich cookies.

This was incredibly easy and it turned out delicious!  I used the microwave at half power for about 6 or 7 minutes and it came out great.  I didn't strain through a fine mesh strainer, but would next time because the overall consistency is a little bit gritty.  But it's very lemony and very tart.  Thanks for the quick and simple recipe!

OMG this is WOW!!! I made it, and at first, it seemed runny, but then after it sat in the fridge for a while, it thickened up and it is tangy and fantastic. I used tart lemons, but I love Meyer lemons, so I may try that, too. I cannot believe how easy it was. Also, I used my food processor. I don't like the feel of the lemon zest, but love the taste. It came out smooth and perfect.

Used two lemons and filled out rest of cup with bottled lemon juice as another reviewer suggested. It really does work; our microwave cooked this at 4 minutes. We served this with English muffins and tea; this lemon curd is refreshingly sweet and delicious.

I was doubtful this would turn out, but it worked perfectly!  No curdling, no eggy taste, just the right amount of zing and sweet.  Perfect, easy lemon curd.

Excellent lemon curd! I was skeptical b/c I've always cooked lemon curd (stove vs. microwaving). Mine was very smooth, no egg bits noted. Cooked it ~4.5 min wisking well well after every min as instructed. Used fresh juice from my tree & was great! Thanks for sharing.

EXCELLENT! I'm not that much of a lemon fan but I had to stop myself from eating this right out of the bowl. It was so tasty. Very smooth and perfectly tart with a hint of sweetness. Fresh lemon juice is a MUST! I used it for the curd filling of the lemon frosting cake recipe that is also on this site. So easy to make and so delicious, you can't beat that! This curd was the main reason my cake was so delicious. Thank you!

Really good!  Going to use the curd to make lemon tarts with my toddler.  Mine did look a bit on the orange side rather than yellow...might have cooked it a bit longer than I should have, 10 mins in total.  No problems with any eggy bits...yay!  I also wanted to add - I was just short of the required amount of fresh lemon so I used some bottled lemon juice to top it up.  It resulted in one heck of a "tang"!  Wouldn't recommend even considering the bottled stuff (I've had to stir in a bit of powdered sugar to sweeten it up a bit!).

I use this to make Rachael Ray's Take Out Lemon Chicken. DELISH!

I was amazed at how easy this recipe is.  Love Lemon Curd and this recipe completely eliminates all the messing around normally associated with making it. The end result is a lovely texture with a fabulous tangy flavour.   Thank you for sharing this little beauty.

Wonderful Super Easy Recipe!!!! No worries about the eggs curdling. The microwave version is the best way to go!! My family absolutely loved it and all the scones were gone, gone, gone even the lemon curd was gone.  It makes plenty.  I used lemon juice from the bottle and I used orange zest instead of lemon cause that's all I had.  It still tasted so yummy and awesome.  We will be making this beautifully simple recipe again and again.

AMAZING!!  I substituted limes for lemons and this turned out fantastic.  Never in a million years did I think it could be this easy.  I strained out most of the lime zest and will probably use less next time.  I used it as a cake filling (an Italian cream cake...the lime cut the sweetness of the cake beautifully) and licked the jar clean once I was done.

I substituted the lemon juice with passion fruit but microwaved the pulp first so that I could easily remove the seeds.  Followed the recipe & it turned out great!  Tks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This was a deliciously easy version of lemon curd. This is something I really fell in love with when I was living in England. I think I would cut the amount of lemon zest I used. I really enjoyed this recipe. It was perfect for filling cupcakes with!

Easy and delicious. I mixed the curd with whipped cream and filled and frosted a lemon cake with it. It would be good as a filling for a Lemon Tart.

I adapted this recipe about 10 years ago from a Mary Berry recipe from her Aga cookbook. I did not want to stand over the aga all day.

I have been using it ever since. Thanks for the update recipe as the book is in storage. 

I'm just about to make some now. And no! you can't have any. Make your own -its so easy. The other half is getting the lemon juice ready now as I got a new big silver jucier.
 
Oh and we are cooking pork for lunch with fresh apples. Kitchen is a hive of activite this afternoon. So get in there now and make this wonderful item and put it on your toast in the morning- it will wake you up.

I've made lemon curd many times and this just didn't work well.  The egg cooked in little globs and good heavens make sure you use a bowl twice the size you need because the concoction grows in the microwave and will overflow!  Eek--better to make it the old fashioned way!

I will never slave over a hot stove again! This was easy and excellent. I cut the recipe in half, used limes instead (and added 1 drop green color)and used it to fill a layer cake. It was perfect. Thanks for a "keeper"!

This was so EASY to make and the results are DELICIOUS! Since I hate chewing on lemon peel, I used a microplane for the to create ultra fine zest. PERFECTION!

Unbelievable how EASY this is to make.  I was a little nervous about trying a microwave recipe, but this recipe  is definitely a keeper.  It tasted divine, just like lemon curd is supposed to taste!  My husband loved it too.

This was so easy and really lemon-y!  I made whipped shortbread cookies, with a thumbprint in them and filled them with this.  They are great!  I love a strong lemon flavor, not too sweet and this is perfect.  I used the juice of 4 lemons (a little more than 1 cup.)

I followed the recommendations in the most helpful review.  1.25 cups sugar, 3 eggs plus 2 yolks, 1 cup Meyer lemon juice, zest of all 4 lemons, and the butter.  It took 5.5 minutes in the microwave to thicken.   I pressed it through my sieve when done and had perfectly smooth, creamy curd that set up in jars in the fridge overnight.

Turn out very well Thanks to the person with the tip to temper the eggs, the eggs didn't cook. It was a little thin, but I'm sure I didn't microwave it long enough. I will next time.

Absolutely delicious!!!  When I taste lemon and it hits me in the taste glands it is perfect.   This one did.  I made it exactly as the recipe is stated.  After reading reviews about the eggs bits, I made sure my eggs were completely whipped through with the sugar.  I added the lemon juice and zest to the butter to cool it down then added all to the egg mixture and mixed well.  About 4 minutes in the microwave it came out perfect.  No lumps or anything to strain.   This lemon curd is going on top of the Easy Pavlova from this site.   Thank you for the great recipe!!

It doesn’t get any faster or easier than this.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of whisking the curd 15 seconds after microwaving to tempter the eggs and then every 20 seconds thereafter.   There was no need to strain as it came out perfectly.  The curd will thicken as it cools.

I wanted a lemon curd filling for my son's birthday cake, and this was so highly rated (and I was so rushed), I decided to give it a try. I'll be making it again!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, with one exception: I used six egg yolks instead of three eggs. I did not want to have to deal with bits of cooked egg white. That worked fine. I did worry that the lack of egg white was causing the curd not to thicken, but when it was cooled, as people said, it thickened just fine. I was glad I resisted the temptation to thicken it with cornstarch. 

I love lemon curd, but it was a little tangy even for my taste. I did whisk in a little powdered sugar, which also may have helped thicken it a little. I think next time I make it I will increase the sugar a little and/or decrease the amount of lemon juice, making up the rest of the cup of liquid with water.

Perfection!! I had great results (no egg bits, just smooth, tart and delicious!) by changing up when I added some of the ingredients. I added the melted butter to the sugar and whisked well. Then I added the eggs, 1 at a time, whisking well between each addition. (I happened to have extra egg yolks from another recipe, so I added two yolks in addition to the three whole eggs as suggested by another reviewer.) Then I added the lemon juice and again whisked very well. Other than adding the ingredients in this order, they key is whisking WELL between each addition. Then I microwaved in 45 - 50 second intervals, whisking in between. When the mixture coated the back of a spoon, I stopped cooking. This is just so easy and so delicous! I did not add lemon zest, but if I do in the future (I don't think it needs it, but I will probably add next time anyway) I will add it when I add the lemon juice.

My family loves lemon curd, so when I found huge bags of lemons on sale, I had to try this.  I followed various tips: 1) grind sugar with lemon zest to break up the bits, then 2) mix with butter. 3) Add in eggs, one at at time, before adding lemon juice.  To get one cup, I used about 5 sm/med lemons.  At 500W in my microwave, it took about 5-6 min.  I ended up with just under three half pints.  The consistency was perfect, and I had no problem with cooked egg bits.  This is really lemony - I may decide to play around with the sugar and butter ratios, but the result is already fantastic!

This may not yield completely perfect lemon curd (it was slightly grainy) but it was so, so easy and really yummy. I made it for a party at the last minute. Guests loved it and my kids could not get enough of it spread on vanilla wafers or on English muffins.

Absolutely incredible!
This is the easiest lemon curd I have ever made! I used Meyer lemons and what a wonderful treat. My husband has been wanting some for his toast in the morning, won't he be surprised when he wakes up tomorrow! I followed the recipe to a T. It took about 4 one minute intervals and a good mixing between each minute. My mouth is watering just talking about it.

Well, I have never had lemon curd before, but had to try because it seamed interesting and more importantly so easy to make.  It cooked in exact 6 minutes.  I whisked mine instead of just stirring to avoid lumps.  Its really zesty!  I don't know if the family will enjoy, but it seamed to go perfectly and I believe that is how its supposed to taste....

THIS IS AWESOME!!! This was my first attempt at lemon curd and it came out perfect. I took the suggestions of "Mommy from Seattle" and added 2 yolks and 1/4 cup of sugar and, WOW!!! It is sooo easy to make in exactly 5 1/2 min. I also strained it to get the zest and any possible cooked egg out. I tried some as soon as it cooled and had to hurry up and freeze it to avoid eating the whole batch! I'm going to make some blueberry scones topped with this lucious curd for Christmas. Definitely a keeper!...I know I gushed over this but it really is that good!!!!! Thanks for sharing.

I gave it a four because the recipe wasn't detailed enough.  I wasn't sure about the consistency. It ended up being too runny, however the flavor was perfect.  I ended up adding corn starch as another reviewer suggested and still upset with the consistency.  Retried this recipe and cooked it at 1 minute intervals, for 2 minutes and then 30 sec intervals (stirring after each) for a total of 5 1/2 minutes. Perfect!

I needed a lemon curd to make 'Lemon Curd Tarts' from AR.  After looking at three stores, I decided to make my own.  This recipe came recommended.  I loved the tartness that this recipe offers.  It is rather thin, even after making and refrigerating it.  I microwaved it at 1-minute intervals for six minutes, cooled and then had to reheat it on the stovetop with a thickening agent.  A nice recipe that I know I will use again.

Fast and fabulous. I only ended up with 1/2 cup of juice from four small lemons, added two egg yolks as recommended and added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar. Only took 2.5 minutes stopping after each minute and then after the last 30 seconds and stirring.

I can't believe how easy this was to put together! I usually stand over my stove with a double boiler making lemon curd, but this has the same results. I think I'm going to try lime curd, and orange curd. Thanks for a great recipe.

Using a stick blender gives a wonderful consistency! No bits of zest or anything else, just creamy. I took the time to remove the little white "cords" from the eggs as well and added 2 extra egg yolks. I reduced the sugar down to 1 Cup and felt it was sweet enough. Also followed a PP suggestion to let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes after mixing in the sugar to let it dissolve fully. Will never buy from the store again.

This was tart which suits me fine, but it turned out a littler thinner than I would have liked.  I've always cooked lemon curd in the double boiler, whisking often, and I did end up with some small pieces of cooked egg in this microwave version.  I really have to wonder if I overcooked it.  It tastes good, just more like a sauce.

Somewhat grainy when it cools but is fine when on something. Delicious taste! EDIT: I whisked the hell out of it before and during cooking and it was very smooth.

I used about 3/4 cup of lemon juice (the juice of the 3 zested lemons) and strained the curd when it was finished. I think more lemon juice would have made it too tart. Don't use bottled lemon juice, it will be too tart. Easier and faster than stovetop but just as delicious!

Quick and easy ~ used bottled lemon juice and no zest because I did not have lemons on hand. Cut the recipe in thirds, it was perfect after 3 min 25 secs on high. Made enough to almost fill 2 small jam jars.  It did firm up a bit in the fridge overnight. Thank you for this recipe!!

simply delicious! i mistakenly added 1/2 Cup more of the butter, even had the salted one, and ran out of lemon juice so used lemon lime & bitters concentrate. cooked it for about 5 minutes but it was just very nice and smoothly delicious! ate it with carrot cake and it was so divine. Thank you so much for an easy and wonderful recipe. :)

This is an excellent recipe for lemon curd in general, the addition of easy and in the microwave should make this six stars!  I do recommend straining, but the taste is delicious. I wanted to slather it over any likely looking food in my kitchen.

This is the second time I have made this recipe in the last 2 weeks and I have to say I've found the perfect recipe.  I've always been a big fan of lemon curd and never realised how easy it was to make.  Followed the recipe exactly and it thickened up nicely into a lovely tangy "custard".  This mornings batch are for Easter gifts, can't wait to share the recipe!

This is incredibly easy and the best lemon curd I've ever had. Nice and tart and satisfying, I like this spread on a toasted multigrain bagel for breakfast! I followed the recipe exactly, only I stopped the microwave to stir with a whisk every 30-45 seconds and ended up with no unappetizing eggy bits. I'll keep making this.

I recommend everyone try this recipe! I just made it and it turned out delicious! It was a little runny when I took it out of the microwave after 3 or 4 minutes but as soon as it cools it thickens! I'm putting it over my homemade mini cheesecakes, yummm!

I made this at my daughters and it turned out wonderful--I made it again when I got home and it was runny and never thickened.  The only difference is the fact that I used two different microwave ovens.  I would venture to guess my experience explains why some people (most) rave about it and others are disappointed in the consistency.  I will try again and add cornstarch to the sugar and see if that does the trick.

I found this on a food blog and decided it was worth a try. I've had issues with curd before but this one is almost foolproof. The biggest issue is not overcooking it. I average 2-3minutes of cook time in my microwave. After it bubbles I use 30second intervals to make sure its not too cooked. It also makes a wonderful lime curd. I tried a pink grapefruit curd but it wasn't quite tart enough. Made with local real butter and fresh eggs from chickens its hard to not eat the entire jar.

i can't believe that a lemon curd that comes together this quickly can be so incredibly perfect! i have found that i prefer the consistency and flavor of a half batch over a full batch, though. this is the only recipe i use now for lemon curd, and i've also tried with lime, and a combination lemon-lime. delish!

I have  made this twice in the microwave, I did one minute for the first minute, then descended to 45 seconds, then 40 seconds, then 35 seconds, then added butter and did it for 35 more seconds and it was done, no egg whites to strain out, after trying this recipe. I did cut the butter down to by 1/2 of what it called for the second time and it tasted more lemony than the first time. This is great  to serve on the side with a lemon cake, as it could get the cake soggy, using it as a filling, unless you serve it fairly soon after making.

I can not believe how easy this is and how perfect the results are. Delicious. Drizzled over Refreshing Limoncello Cake (from this site) and it was a great ending to our meal tonight. I see no reason to ever purchase lemon curd from the store again. Thanks for sharing!

Lemon curd is standard fare around our house, and I was happy to find a recipe that might help me make it faster.  This tasted great right out of the microwave, but a day later it had a grainy consistency.  We might not have noticed if this was in something like lemon bars, but on toast and scores it was disappointing.

Wow. Impressive! I think this is great if you have lots of things going on in the kitchen... just a little stir every time the microwave beeps at you, rather than keeping an eye on the stove. I'm really impressed with how easy this came together and that it actually worked! Yum...

I've tried two batches of this lemon curd, and it still isn't setting up correctly. I'm not sure what's going wrong, but it is still thin and too runny.

So easy and has a wonderful taste.  Sieving is a must for all custards, makes for a much nicer finished product....easy while it's hot. Used Meyers. Will try with Splenda, cutting down on Carbs! But first will fill a shortbread crust and top with whipped cream...

Great, simple recipe! Even tastier with Meyer lemons! This is super easy to make and took me all of 10 minutes. Like another reviewer, I split the recipe down to 1 egg, juice of 1 Meyer lemon, 3 tbs butter, zest of 1 lemon and 1/3 cup sugar. This has a sweet, mild lemon flavor - next time I would probably add more lemon juice as I like it very lemony. It took 3 minutes, and I whisked after each minute in between. A few tiny pieces of cooked egg but I fished them out by hand.

I used 3 lemons and their juice.  The taste is great.  I agree with some other reviews about the small amounts of egg whites.  If I was serving this in a dinner party setting I would certainly run it through a metal sieve, but as I wasn't the small amount of egg whites was no big deal.

Simply Outstanding!  I took the suggestion from  mommyfromseattle and this had everyone wanting more!  I used this as a filling in my coconut cake and it was heavenly.  I took the leftovers and made minature lemon meringue pies with my oversized muffin tins.  This is my ONLY lemon curd recipe!!  Oh, don't remove the zest via a seive... you lose flavor!

Very easy and tasty recipe. If you cool it down in small portions its nice dessert.In bigger portion you need to add something to break the lemon taste

great flavor and consistency. i agree that tempering the eggs helps.  it took 4 mins for me, so just be mindful of your microwave power.

oh my goodness. i cant beleive how delicious this recipe is... and i made it in the microwave!!! I do suggest fresh lemon juice for this recipe. However, when I made it, i was short like a 1/4 cup of fresh squeezed so i added the bottled kind and it tasted perfectly fine. I think what made my lemon curd such a success was that I let the eggs sit out for about 1 1/2 hours before i made it. I have no idea why but my lemon curd did not curdle at all which surprised me. I forgot to temper them too! and dont get scared because it looks so runny at first. i was freaking out for the first 3 hours it was in the fridge, but it turned out to be the perfect consistency. However, I would do 6 minutes in the microwave, just in case. I made a cheesecake that had blueberries tossed in on shortbread crust with lemon curd on top. it was beautiful and delicious. I then sprinkled sugar on top and torched it. I was trying to mimic the claim jumper lemon bar cheesecake recipe. Oh and be careful while in the microwave. On my fourth time in, it erupted a little. probably my fault, but from then on i watched it a bit more carefully. I am going to make this as gifts from now on. tastes great topped on plain yogart!!!

This is easy and delicious!!  I cut this recipe by a third and didn't add any zest and this was amazing!!  I didn't temper the egg and it was smooth and tart and not too sweet.  It firmed up quite a bit after about an hour.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Hmm, when I made this it ended up having a grainy texture, was a little thin for my liking, and not sweet enough.  I think I am going to stick with the stovetop method.

This was an exceptional recipe! One of the best I've found on the site. Very easy and absolutely delicious! I made it to give away in Christmas baskets, but as soon as my husband tasted it, he refused to let me give it away (I have yet to sneak any out of the house to let family taste.) I didn't change a thing about the recipe; it was perfect as is and extremely lemony and creamy.

What an easy recipe! I was watching "Whatever, Martha" tonight, and they were talking about lemon curd. I started getting hungry for it and decided to make it. I looked it up here and found this easy microwave recipe. I used Real Lemon juice instead of lemons, and I used no lemon zest. But I did use the rest of the ingredients. It came out great! It tastes like it took a lot more time to make. I lost track of how many times I took it out of the microwave, stirred it, then put it back in again. I think it was about 6 minutes that this took. I highly recommend this recipe!

Thanks for the easy and delicious resipe. My mother, who is very ill, asked me to buy lemon curd for her from a local store. She had it before and really liked it. Whn I got to the store, they told me they no longer stocked it. All Recipes and CATSEO came to my rescue. Thanks so much!

OMG! If I could give this 10 stars on taste & ease of preparation, I would! It is SO good! I used a combo of Meyer & regular lemons. Micro'd about 5 mins total. I couldn't stop licking the bowl! I made a blueberry lemon loaf and this was divine with it. I will definitely serve this at my tea parties/get together's with my sisters! But I won't share the recipe!

I made this as a gift for my Mom on Mother's Day.  She loved it!  Very easy and very good!  I used a vegetable peeler to cut my zest into large very thin strips - able to remove them very easily.  I didn't have any trouble with curdled egg.

Made this yesterday for the first time.  Super simple to put together.  I did strain it after cooking just to remove the few little bits of stringy egg-a very easy step to add in.  This was pucker-up good!  Highly recommend it!

Definitely easy to do. I will use this technique again, but not the recipe itself. It was too runny for me. I tried it in a cake and it was a mess. The butter ratio is way off and when you chill this, it is grainy.  I also thought  the flavor was greasy tasting too. Meaning it had a greasy mouth feel after eating it. So I guess the word is "too buttery". Absolutely take the time to strain off the bits of egg and lemon peel. If you know someone who has a Meyer Lemon tree, it is worth it to try and get your hands on some them.

Absolutely amazing! Super easy and super delicious. My one was done in 4 minutes. I didn't have to change or add anything. Even though it was too tangy for my bf but it means I can have it all to myself. Many thanks for the great recipe like this.

Absolutely awesome! I scaled it down to whatever number of servings required only two eggs, because that's what I had in the fridge. The juice and zest of two lemons ended up being the exact amounts needed as well. Will definitely be doing it this way forever! And it thickened up just fine.. dunno what other people's problem was!

Holy crow, this is good stuff! I had a spoonful left in the bowl after I filled my little pots, so I took a taste and almost swooned, it's so lemony and buttery and delicious!

If you love lemony flavors, go find the Lemon Yogurt Muffin recipe here, and then make some of this to spoon over a muffin. Yum!

10 stars! The best recipe for lemon curd I've ever tried. I've found other recipes to have a distinct "egg" taste and this does not! This has the perfect proportions of butter, lemon, and egg (but I did add a wee bit more sugar, and it was still VERY tart. I also did not use the microwave for this first try, but will next time! Last, I strained a finished portion for comparison, and while I loved the texture, it had a little less "bang" to the tastebuds with the peel removed.

I was very hesitant about trying this because I thought for sure the eggs would scramble. They did not. I probably had to stir 4 or 5 times (at the most). I cut down on the sugar by 1/4 cup and that was plenty. Very tart. I don't like all the zest so I also strained it. Very good. I don't bother with the sterile jars either. Plain ole tupperware works fine.

I too had trouble getting the curd to thicken in the microwave. After about 10 minutes I added about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken. That worked. I followed the recipe except cut the butter back to 1/3 cup. I don't believe that would keep it from thickening though. Just as easy to cook and stir on the stove top.

Did anyone else have trouble getting the lemon curd to thicken? I double checked another recipe and found 3 eggs and 1 cup sugar only used 1/2 cup lemon juice. So, I added three more eggs and another cup of sugar and it turned out great. The microwave was such a convenient way to make this.

I got hooked on lemon curd when living in the UK but it's hard to find here.  This was super quick and easy with a very strong lemon taste, but a bit too sour for me.  After I added another 2 T of sugar, it was fantastic on pound cake.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Aboslutely delicious!  I served it with the poppyseed bundt cake (II) also on this website, and it was wonderful.  This was my first time making lemon curd, and it couldn't have been easier.  I only had four lemons, and that made only 3/4 cup of lemon juice, so I filled the rest of the measuring cup with water to make 1 full cup.  It was absolutely unnoticeable, because it still had a very strong (but yummy) lemon-y taste. Even my mom who definitely knows her lemon curd said it tasted like a little bit of heaven. :)

This was not my favorite lemon curd recipe.  It had a cloudy color and gritty texture.  I didn't change anything ingredient or prep wise.  It was a bit too much on the tart side.

I remember making lemon curd when I was at school - it was a hot and tedious affair, involving thermometers, and 40 mins of constant 'figure of eight' stirring. This method is SO much easier! I also needed 4 lemons to have one cup of juice. The flavor was just right. Thanks so much!

Either in a bottle as a gift (this is a very impressive looking spread and would look fantastic in a bottle with a pretty fabric on the lid) on toast, a sandwich or fill a pre-made pie case and make a tart, this recipe is a winner.  I have made this over a dozen times, it always works a treat. Just stir like mad!!! Thanks Catseo, this is a family favourite.

Fabulous.  I didn't use all of the rind from the 3 lemons as my lemons were quite large so I put some in, then tasted and added more until I got the desired level of tartness.  I used the lemon curd as filling for lemon meringue tarts and my company all raved.

This recipe was SO quick and EASY to make and has a wonderful tart, lemony taste! I used this as a topping over pound cake and they licked the plate!! We have a lemon tree in our yard, and I will be using a lot of those lemons for this curd.  Thanks for sharing.

This went together easily and resulted in a zingy, tart spread.  Using fresh lemons (instead of bottled juice and zest) make a big difference.

This worked wonderfully! I followed the recipe as printed without a glitch. I wonder if fresh squeezed lemons work better than bottled or concentrated juice? I used fresh squeezed and it was sweet, tart and firmed nicely. I used it to make little tarts with whipped cream. Yum

Wow, this was great, cooked in 2 min and was perfect!  I’ve cooked Hollandaise sauce for years and love it.  I’ve adapted it to a curd, but this was so much faster and easy... if I hadn’t done it myself I wouldn’t have believed it!!

I have now made this many many times and it is a hit!! I packaged for Christmas presents, made lemon bars, and used it on my holiday Cheesecake. It is so easy and perfect and best of all, EASY!! Thanks so much for the recipe. It is a keeper especially if you have a plethora of lemons on your trees. I used Meyers lemons!!

I'm assuming maybe I did something wrong, but it didn't reach the consistency it should have. I slowly heated it to 170° and the flavor  was amazing, but more like a glaze than a curd. I would recommend cooking it on a lower heat for a longer period of time to see if that helps.

I made this and it is awesome!  So easy too. I hate to zest anything so I did as someone else suggested and put some peel in and removed it when it was done. I had to cook more than five minutes, maybe seven or eight. I stirred after each minute of cooking.   I will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made it exactly as the recipe says and it turned out perfectly! I am amazed at how delicious and easy this was. The longest part was zesting and juicing the lemons. It came together in 15 minutes,  plus refrigeration time. I served it with angel food cake, blueberries and strawberries, and a dollop of freshly whipped cream - the perfect light summer dessert!

This was the first lemon curd I’ve ever made. It was very easy to make. I used it in a recipe from this site called Lemon Meringue Cheesecake. The lemon flavor was a little too strong though. So next time I’ll probably cut the lemon juice from 1 cup to 3/4 cup, and see if it’s better.

Very easy and successful recipe. I made this today, the only changes I made was to blend everything with the immersions blender rather than stirring every 30 seconds. DELICIOUS! I made a second batch with key limes in place of the lemon, FANTASIC!

This lemon curd is CRAZY GOOD and  so easy! 
I made a lower calorie version by using erythritol instead of sugar. It was a bit too sour, so I added 3-4 Tablespoons  of  real sugar and ended up with the perfect sweetness  
 After stirring on minute 1 & 2,  I switched to every 30 seconds.  It was done and thickening  nicely at about 4-5 minutes.  I can't wait to eat more when it's cooled! 2 thumbs up.

This recipe is so perfect, used a stick blender to mix sugar and eggs together and again after adding juice zest and melted butter, first minute at 50 percent power then full strength. Have used lemons, limes, grapefruit and my granddaughter is requesting mango so will have a try at it next time

I used the ingredients as-is, and it all turned out correctly.  Mine was finished in the microwave in no more than 3 minutes though.  I did it by the minute, and when I got to 2 minutes, I could tell it was almost done.  So I then went 30 seconds twice, and it was perfectly ready, any more, it would have turned for the worse.  Everyone who tasted it loved it as the curd.  And, when I folded in whipped cream and used it in a trifle with pound cake and strawberries, they loved it that way as well.  I've given this recipe to others, all said it was a winner.  You can freeze it too.  I have an improved Meyer lemon and a Lisbon lemon tree, and when it is time to harvest, as we are finishing now along with zesting and making curd, and freezing is a must!  This is a winner, and a lot simpler than over the stove top!  Try it.

Super-easy tasty lemon curd.  I microwaved in 30 second intervals.  This curd came to the rescue after a cake partially failed.  I used it (plus some thickening with arrowroot and it was still not as firm as I wanted) to fill in areas where my cake failed.  This curd was easy, tasty, and so bright.  And I had some leftover that I could mix into my yogurt!

This is so fresh and tasty. My family loves it. I did add just a pinch of salt which cut the tangy sweet. I also added fresh blueberries and crumbled graham cracker crust on the top.

Very easy to make but took a lot of lemons for one cup of juice but worth it.  I started with two 30 second intervals and then went on to 1 min intervals for stirring.  I have a high watt microwave so thats why I did that.  It took 8 minutes to get it the thickness I wanted so to the ones that said theirs didn't thicken up its probably because u didn't cook it long enough.  I didn't strain out the lemon zest because it adds to the flavor.  Why put it in only to strain it out???  Anyway its tart just the way we like it but not over whelming tart.  I am going to try Meyer lemons next and use only 1/2 the amount of sugar and I will see how that goes.

it worked well, but i thought it was too sweet. i would lessen the amount of sugar, and add more lemon zest. i also drained it to get the zest out afterwards, as all the flavor went into the curd.

For the bottom crust I used 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans and 1 cup flour and 1 stick of butter, baked per this recipe.
For the Lemon filling, I used the recipe Microwave Lemon Curd.
I used Cool Whip for the topping, but next time I'll use real whipped cream:  Whip 1 cup heavy cream and 1 T sugar. 

I took this to a meeting, and it was a HUGE hit!!!

The curd was delicious. I am looking for additional ways to use it.  I tried a graham cracker crust and puff pastry crust. Will try a sugar cookie nest next time.

Followed recipe & it was so easy & was scrumptious! Probably could have nuked it 1 or 2 more times for for a more jelled consistency, i.e. to use as pie filling. Sure was easier than watching it curdle on the stove !

A lot of the lemon bar recipe's don't have enough "lemon" for my taste and this is absolutely the perfect tang of lemon - tart and lemony as I like it.  It will be my go to for the Christmas baking lemon bar's I like to make.  As one other reviewer noted, after 6 minutes it was still at what I considered a looser consistency so I simply added some cornstarch and then it was perfect - for me....

Quick, easy and delicious. No changes are required as it turns out perfectly. I used large, very juicy lemons and all their zest, as we love it lemony and it balances the sweetness

Absolutely delicious!  This was my first time ever to make lemon curd and it came out perfect.  I agree with another reviewer that fresh lemon juice is best.  I only got 3/4 cup of juice from my lemons and added 1/4 bottled to get the required amount.  The curd is still delicious but I think next time, I will add a little water with the bottled juice.  I don't know if it matters but I used a whisk to stir every minute and mine took 5 minutes to cook.  I didn't have any issues with egg bits - my zest was extremely fine so it's even hard to find bits of that.  It is super creamy and absolutely tastes divine!  Now I have to find recipes in which to utilize this deliciousness!

This is the best and easiest Lemon Curd that I have ever made.  I used 3 Whole eggs plus 2 Egg yolks and 1 1/4 cups of Sugar. 
Whisk the sugar and eggs together for 8-10 minutes or until you don't see any more sugar granules.
 I microwaved the ingredients in 1-minute intervals, beating the mixture after each interval for a total of  6 minutes.  
The Lemon Curd was perfectly smooth, thick, and creamy.  Deliciously tart and sweet.   Save this recipe, it is a keeper! :)

I was EXTREMELY skeptical of the recipe initially but it turned out AMAZING. I followed MommyFromSeattle's advice and added 2 egg yolks. I also strained the curd before storing to ensure a smooth texture (there will be tiny cooked egg white bits in there). I squeezed fresh lemons so it wasn't too sour. If you prefer a more sour curd, you could either use more lemons or use bottled lemon juice instead.

Used fresh Key Lime juice instead of lemon as I grow my own.  Was surprised how easy the microwave version worked.  I normally do my curd on the stove top.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and in my opinion it was perfect. It is a little tart, but that’s what I love in anything lemon that I make. If tartness ain’t your thing, you might add a little bit more sugar like someone else suggested. The only challenging part in making this was squeezing enough juice out of the tiny lemons I had, but cooking it could not have been any easier.

This is the easiest lemon curd I've ever made.  The tartness is PERFECT and this has now become my go-to recipe for curd.  It may seem thin when it's hot, but once it cools, it's the perfect consistency.

Great flavour and couldn't be easy enough. I am using the curd for a cake filling, so I would have preferred it to be a bit thicker and should have cooked for 30 seconds or so longer than the 5 1/2 minutes suggested. I ran it through a sieve at the end as well. Tastes just like my great grandmother used to make!

The first time I made this recipe it thickened after 10 minutes, the second time it never thickened, even after chilling overnight. I do not know why. Definitely sieve through a fine mesh to remove egg bits.

This is incredibly amazing!!! If you follow the recipe and MAKE SURE TO STIR, it makes a lemon curd as good as and arguably better than the ones you'd make over a stovetop. Glorious.

This is the fastest lemon curd I’ve ever made. I was expecting it to be curdled with using whole eggs, but it came out perfectly smooth and creamy. I cooked in 30-second increments, whisking each time, and stopping when it barely coated and metal teaspoon. I shaved lemon zest from organic lemons and left 2-inch by half inch strips in the curd because my seven-year-old granddaughter loves to chew on lemon rind. For a more mellow taste, you can omit the rind.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I let my husband try it without telling him it had the word curd in it (he's picky that way).  He loved it and wants more.

So glad I found this recipe.   It was super easy.  I dumped everything together and microwaved for about 2.5 mins stirring after each minute.  Taste divine, partly due to using lemons off our own lemon tree.

This turned out great. I used Meyer lemons from my backyard tree and that added a freshness to the final product that made it zesty (no pun intended) and so fresh. It was easy and forgiving, since I never made it before.

Looks delicious; but exactly what is a serving size?  I'd like to make enough to put in pint size jars for gifts; but have no idea from the recipe if it makes 2 cups curd or what.  Pity.  Sent an email asking about this to All Recipes yesterday and still no reply.

Thought I had a jar of lemon curd in the cupboard, but did not, so found this recipe - amazing.   Years ago I tried to make lemon curd and it was a disaster - I said never again, and have only bought jarred.  This was so easy and tastes amazing - I will never buy jarred lemon curd again - thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!!! I added three egg whites and then two more whole eggs and an additional 1/4  cup of sugar when it appeared it was not thickening up. Put the microwave on 2 minutes and used the strainer to strain out the egg white pieces and it turned out perfectly tasty!!!

Unbelievably easy and DELICIOUS!  Followed the recipe exactly, using fresh lemon juice and a bit of bottled to make the cupful.  I was in the 5th minute and turned my back a second and it over ran my 4cup measuring container! ??  Caught it before losing very much!  Whew!  
Smooooooth and delicious!  Just keep an eye out and use a bigger bowl!! ??

12/13/17 Update: I LOVE this recipe!! It is the perfect throw together recipe. I have been making batches all week after work for Christmas gifts. It is beautiful, creamy, tart, tangy lemony goodness. All done in my microwave! Please note, timing is all relative to your microwave. Even in my own, it can take different times for each individual batch. It has taken anywhere from 4 - 5 1/2 minutes to get to the right consistency.  Know your microwave, watch your batch, and when testing on the back of the spoon, hold it perpendicular to the bowl of curd, drag your finger through the curd on the back of the spoon, if the line does not fill in then your curd is ready! Best. Recipe. Ever.


1/31/17 I, like so many other reviewers, was skeptical about this recipe prior to making. After making, I am a convert! It took longer to prep than it took to get the finished product. I did a half recipe - and it worked exceptionally well. My curd took 2 1/2 minutes on high in my particular microwave to thicken up, and once it did, it was a beautiful, silky, lemony filling for my cake. I did let it cool in refrigerator prior to using. Anyone asking about a lemon curd, I will send to or hand out this recipe.

Very good!  Love the tart flavor.  Took someone's suggestion about using cornstarch.  I stirred 2 TBSP of cornstarch into the sugar before adding eggs to beat.  I also tempered the egg/lemon mixture by adding melted butter in small amounts and beating between additions.  I had no problems with the eggs "cooking".  Make sure you beat after every minute before returning to the microwave.  Perfect consistency.  I am going to use it tonight to dress up some lemon bundt cake.

This is amazing!!! I doubted it at first, but after I made it, It set up really well. The only downside is that I had to strain it to get the cooked, separated egg pieces... Otherwise, it's perfect!

This took me an hour, including the zesting and squeezing. Not much time to have 4 delicious jars of lemon curd to share. PS. I don't sieve the zest out as I like the texture. So good!

Love this recipe - so easy and so good!  I have a Meyer lemon tree in my yard and I can't wait until they are ripe enough to make this.  Followed recipe exactly - I found that if I add lemon peel and juice to melted butter first, I don't end up with cooked egg bits.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Be sure to whip the sugar and eggs really good that way it will not come out grainy.  It took about 5 minutes.  It firmed up nicely and taste excellent. No more cooking lemon curd on the stove when it isn't required.

super easy and delicious! I only had 2 lemons so I halved the recipe using the zest of 2 lemons,  their juice plus some bottled juice since it wasn't enough, one whole egg plus one yolk. it took about 3 and 1/2 minutes in the microwave total. my husband and I agree that we'd prefer it without the rind so next time I'll run it through a sieve to get the pieces out. I got enough fill one small mason jar plus a little bowl.  perfect for us and to have some leftover to freeze. we ate it with strawberry shortcake.

I've made lemon curd the 'hard way' before. Always a pain, but this was super easy and turned out beautifully. I only made half the recipe (using only 1 egg), 'just in case' it didn't turn out well, but it is perfect and delicious.  I used the tip to start out with 100% microwave power and end with 50%. I also made sure the butter wasn't too hot before adding to the egg / sugar mixture to eliminate any chance of cooking the egg.  If you prefer an more 'eggy' taking curd, you could add extra egg yolks. Yummy! Can't wait to make some shortbread cookies to go with it. Love it!

This was so easy and tasty it was a sin! I didn't add the lemon zest because I was zested-out and had a lot of freshly squeezed lemon juice to show for it! It was plenty lemony even without the zest. Yummy yum yum!

Don't you wish every recipe was this quick & easy?  I've made this several times over the last few years, and it's always delicious whether I temper the eggs or not.  I am careful not to pour hot butter into the egg mixture.  Today I made a batch with regular lemons and a batch with Meyer lemons.  I got almost 4 pints and both batches are excellent.  The slightly grainy texture doesn't bother me.  We spoon it over yogurt.  I also thin it with chicken stock for a nice lemon chicken sauce.

Love the Lemon Curd recipe.  Just curious about the photo on the site that appears to be a coconut macaroon cup with  graham cracker on the bottom then filled with the lemon curd.  Can anyone share this recipe?

This is excellent!  I did strain after.  Had no fresh lemons so skipped zest and used bottled lemon juice.

I made the lemon curd exactly as the recipe directed, and it turned out great! No lumps, and very yummy. I used it as a filling for a lemon cake and topping for blueberry scones. 
After tasting the curd alone, it is pretty tangy. If I were to use it as pie filling, I would add 1/4 - 1/3 more sugar. LOVE this recipe and how easy it is!

I make lemon curd for Christmas presents every year.  This recipe is tasty and you don't have to worry about the eggs not cooking properly and having bits of scrambled egg in the curd.  And my friends love it!

This recipe was sooooo much easier than my prior recipe and it still tasted wonderful. It didn't set up quite as firmly as my prior recipe but I'll know to compensate for that when I make it next time.

I made this recipe with no changes in ingredients but I did use a vegetable peeler to make the lemon zest as I wanted it to be smooth. It is easily removed after cooking. It is delicious and was cooked to the right consistency in 4.5 minutes in my microwave. I will definitely make it again!

I cheated and whisked in about a teaspoon of cornstarch.  Not sure if it made the difference but in 3 rounds  in the microwave mine was already pretty thick and ready for the fridge.

This was very lemony and tart. A bit too tart for our tastes. I added the zest after cooking and putting through a sieve. (I always sieve custard type things and didn't want to lose the zest to the sieve.)  my was a bit thin, but perhaps it was because I didn't cook it long enough. I will definitely make again, with a bit of tweaking for our tastes.

I didn't have fresh lemons but used bottled juice and zest I had previously dried and grounded to a powder. Worked beautifully and tastes delicious. Using half of the curd for a glaze on lemon pound cake. The other half is in jars for another use.

Wow! Great recipe followed it exactly.  Used wire whisk to stir between intervals came out perfect. Served over puff pastry topped with whipped cream. This was gone before the chocolate cake.

This was one of the easiest recipes I have tried! I am using the lemon curd in a Lemon-Almond Strata (basically bread pudding with lemon curd, almonds and raspberries instead of raisins and cinnamon). I am looking forward to tasting the result.

I've never made lemon curd before so I read many of the reviews before I started out. I tempered the eggs first as others suggested to keep the eggs from overcooking and turning into little bits. This was off the chain in taste! The sweet and tart flavor will be perfect for our scones. Thank you for a great recipe.

I did make a couple tweaks on this. First I creamed sugar and room temperature  butter, then added eggs and zest, adding juice last. Used 4 medium eggs in place of 3 large. My microwave  runs lower power so it took a little longer. Would have filled 2 pint jars full but we had to taste test.

I made this recipe but used LIMES instead of lemons.  I also cooked mine on the stove rather than the microwave.

Turned out GREAT!  I cooked it over medium heat and brought it to a gentle boil for 2 minutes.  This cooks the lime peel and makes it so yummy!

I really love how this recipe uses whole eggs rather than just the yolks.

This is an awesome recipe! ! I had a request for a lemon curd coconut cake.  I had never heard of this cake.  I have a wonderful cake recipe, but didn't know what lemon curd was. My client absolutely loved it!  Thanks to the person responsible for this recipe.  I'm making another one for this thanksgiving!

LOOK NO FURTHER!  I'm not domestic, never have really liked to cook or bake.  Had lots of lemons and just made this following the recipe exactly.  Outstanding results!  I think I did maybe four one-minute increments on full power in my 1000w microwave and it came out perfect.  Made two cups...?  Best part was licking the spoon ;-)

It sets nicely but not as firm as usually curd would be, to much lemon for my taste, it came out to sour, maybe less lemon will be better, next time I'll only use 1/2 cup of lemon.

This recipe is awesome! I have made it twice now when entertaining, and EVERYONE who tried it complimented it.  I even made it for a potluck when I didn't have a kitchen available (only a microwave!).  I have made the recipe exactly as directed both times with no problems.  It usually takes about 4 to 5 minutes to get it to the right consistency.  It will thicken once it cools so only heat it until it coats the back of the spoon and no more.  It is great when served with yogurt, cream cheese, or as a fruit dip.  It can also be used to make tarts and other yummy lemon treats.  Highly recommend it!

Couldn't be easier! I love this stuff. I have used this for lemon tassies, mixed it with cool whip for a lemon mousse, and used it in a layered pie. It is absolutely delicious! I made 2/3 of the recipe, and it made EXACTLY 1 pint of lemon curd. Perfect!

Very easy to make, so much better than stirring continuously in a double boiler. I strain it before bottling. However, like another commenter, I found that it didn't set, I suspect not enough eggs in the recipe, when comparing it to a recipe I used to use for the double boiler which was a good one. I will be using that one in future, just cook it in the microwave instead of double boiler.

this is an amazing way to make lemon curd, although i would suggest leaving it in the fridge over night to thicken up. i used this as a filling in a lemon basil cupcake and it turned out so good that i didn't need any frosting, yum!

I really loved this recipe! It is buttery, lemony, and decadent. I used this to make the "easy lemon lush" recipe on here and it was so delicious. the only problem I had was I couldn't stop eating it!

This was AMAZING!  I followed the directions of the "most helpful" review and added an extra 1/4 cup sugar and two extra egg yolks.  I doubled the recipe and used a heavy stoneware bowl, and after eight one-minute cycles I had seen no change, but decided to keep on until I was certain of failure.  Instead I was rewarded with SUCCESS after about ten minutes.  It was fabulous.  After chilling overnight it became whatever is even better than fabulous!  It wasn't grainy, wasn't eggy, didn't need to be strained, etc.  I will never purchase lemon curd again.  I will also not admit how simple this was, so everyone thinks I am a great cook.  This was the centerpiece of a tea party for 24 guests.  Thank you!!!

I host tea parties and this is a WONDERFUL recipe.  I have made it MANY times and it always comes out great.  Just keep cooking it in the 1 minute intervals until it coats the spoon really well.

Wowee! This was so easy and made so much! I did cut the sugar by 1/2 a cup and added ~1 tbsp of honey + the pulp from the lemons. I used 6 lemons and it took four 1-minute intervals for me. Very smooth and silky. I was stressing about having to do this with a double boiler and am so thankful I found this recipe -- a real time-saver for a quality, homemade, delicious gift! Thank you for posting this!

I tried this today because of the awesome reviews.  I was skeptical but figured it must work.  I took the advice of another reviewer to increase the sugar and egg yolks.  This recipe is amazing!  It turned out perfectly!  I've made it several times the past on the stove and it's been hit or miss with consistency.  Next time if using as a filling I will add cornstarch to thicken a little more.

We're going through a heat wave and I haven't wanted to heat up the house by using my stove, so the microwave method really appealed to me. First time I've ever tried making lemon curd and it came out truly perfect. I love that I can just use whole eggs and don't have to separate the yolks. I was skeptical but this recipe is the real deal!

This recipe saved the lemon curd for me!!  I had made it for the first time and it was not as thick as I thought it should be.  I was going to just put it in the fridge to see if it thickened as it cooled, but then I saw your recipe using the microwave and popped my thin curd in.  Thank you - now I know what it looks like and it worked like a charm.  Next time I will use this recipe!!

The lemon curd tastes fantastic and is really easy to make ..... it just makes too much! i usually only need a couple servings to go on maybe 6 scones, but i have a whole bowl left over which i have to throw out.

Quick and easy. I grounded the lemon zest with part of sugar in a clean coffee grinder to really bring out the lemon favor...it was wonderful! Also after it cooked I pushed it through a strainer for a smooth product. After it cooled, I folded it into about 2 cups of whipped topping then used it as a lemon cake filling.....so many compliments!

This recipe was as easy as stated, and turned out very nice and smooth. It was perfect for a cake filling, but I would not use this recipe on its own...it's VERY tart. I'd like to try it again with more sugar and see if I get better results that I'd feel comfortable with using for a pie.

I have the worst luck when it comes to anything requiring a double boiler so I was excited to see a microwave lemon curd recipe. The texture was perfect but it was a bit too tart for my tastes, I like my curd to have a bit more mellow flavor but for those who like a punch of lemon in the mouth this is a wonderful recipe!

Thanks for a simple recipe to make lemon curd.  Was very easy to follow.  When it was done, I ran it through a fine strainer to make it smooth.  I used it to stuff donuts, and DH was very happy with them.  The tart flavor went well with the sweet donut dough.

I took the advice to increase the sugar and egg yolks.
Didn't have a need to strain this curd.  No bits of anything in the curd...smooth as silk.  I waited to incorporate the lemon zest when the product was finished.  If I did have to strain it, the zest would have been removed also and I didn't want that.
Sure beats standing at the stove as this is just as good, if not better.

I cut the recipe to one-third.  Took the little white strands off the egg before mixing and didn't add the lemon zest.  I cooked it for two minutes in my 2 cup glass measuring cup.  My microwave is a small one.
Came out perfect.  Thanks to all the reviewers for your comments and tips.

The taste is excellent and not much work is involved. I peeled the lemons rather than zesting them (less work I think), then hand-diced to a very fine size. I micro'd 10 - 15 minutes and stirred between each, as recipe calls for. Stopped when curd was bubbly and looked like pudding...maybe overcooked.  However, taste is divine. Had some left almost 3 weeks now with very little separation.

Awesome!!!! This recipe uses way more lemon juice than most lemon curd recipes I've seen, and I love it. Its so tart and sweet and perfect. Not to mention you cook in the microwave. What more could you ask for?

Was so excited to try this recipe. Made it for the holidays was so disappointed. It was so bitter and not good. Used as filling for lemon cake and all the cake was eaten and the filling was still left on everyones plates. Will not make again.

This is a great recipe but I preferred to make it on the hob in a saucepan as I got fed up opening and closing the Microwave door,it also gave me more control.

It's not even cool yet and I can't stop eating it! I can't believe how easy it was. It took 5 or 6 minutes in my microwave and I didn't have a problem with any cooked eggs.

This recipe is very easy to follow and turned out great for me. However, I was planning on using it as a filling for a cake and it was a much to thin. It turned out more like a ribbon of filling instead of the thick, lemony curd I was hoping for. But with that said, it tasted delicious and to make up for the thin filling, I decorated the plate with some drizzles of the lemond curd before I placed the cake down, so everyone would get a nice taste. Everyone that sampled the cake really enjoyed it and said how great the lemon curd was. Thanks for the recipe---I will definitely use again on other projects!

I read the reviews for this lemon curd and was very excited to make it for the filling of my lemon cake. I was greatly disappointed. It was bad. Too tart with a bad taste.  I followed the directions, did not make any changes. Will NOT make again.

A little more sour than my family prefers...I think next time I would use less lemon juice...I had no problems whatsoever with the eggs cooking if done exactly as the recipe says to...

The result from this recipe is really nice. Thanks for providing a good lemon curd recipe that doesn't require extra egg yolks. Need those yolks for my cookies. It's the whites that I have spare. I was too lazy to wait by the microwave....instead I cooked it over the stove on very very low heat. No double boiler setup either. The result was still pretty good slight oil build up at the end. I used it to stuff my cupcakes. Next time I'll be using it for my lemon danish and probably add the butter after removing it from heat.

Couldn't be easier to make and really delicious! I found the taste to be quite a 'kick' so I may make it to be more mild next time. A great way to use up surplus lemon juice - it mixes well with ice cream, too.

I suspended my skepticism and tried it. Super easy and better flavor than the kind from a jar--not to mention much less expensive. Easy to strain through a fine sieve to make it smooooooth. I stirred a little into mascarpone and spread it in a pie shell, then tossed about 3 tablespoons lemon curd with 2 cups of fresh blueberries to go on top. Woowee.

I made this today because I wanted lemon curd for a coffee cake I am making. I usually make it on the stove, but thought I would give this a try. it was very easy to make, and tastes wonderful! Itr just hasn't thickend up yet and it's been 3 hrs. I am going to try like another reviewer tried and add some lemon juice to corstarch and thicken on the stove. I did cook it for 6 min. in the microwave and it coated the spoon, but still not thickening. will update after the cornstarch. also I do plan on trying this recipe as is again in the future and cook it a little longer in the microwave.  ok so I added the cornstarch lemon juice and cooked on stove, thickend nicely and didn't change the flavor. Yummy! I will try again in the microwave and hopefully will have better results, maybe I did something wrong!

Unbelievably easy!  I have an asian lemon chicken dish I make that uses lemon curd as a main ingredient but hate paying $4.99 a jar.  So I started making my own but usually have to make it a day or two ahead because it is time consuming.  Not anymore! Thank you CATSEO for bringing us into the 21st century.

Very good and cooked in 5 minutes!  I did use a sieve to strain out a small amt. of cooked egg, which I believe was from not stirring well enough at the beginning since my microwaveable bowl was a bit on the small size.  We used it as a filling between layers of lemon cake with a lemon buttercream frosting on top.  We only had bottled lemon juice and it was quite tangy but it still worked well with the cake.

This awsome.  I followed the review by Mominseattle and used 3 whole eggs and 2 egg yolks and increased the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cup.  It was the first time I made lemon curd and it turned out wonderful. Thank you for posting.

It turns out awesome with a very sharp lemon flavor. Make sure you make the liquid really smooth before heat it up to prevent small egg pieces.

Compared to store bought lemon curd, this was too sour.  Next time, I will add another egg, a little less lemon juice, and perhaps 2 drops of vanilla to soften the edge.  Very good, nonetheless!

Easy recipe! It took less than 5min to make. I reduced the recipe for 5 servings. I strained the mixture after it was done, put plastic wrap on the surface let it come to rm temp before putting in the fridge & it thickened up. Has a tart/sweet taste, I plan on using it int a coconut layer cake too!

WOW! I've always been afraid to make Lemon Curd, because of some bad egg-based fillings I've had in the past that tasted eww-so-eggy.  After making some gingerbread, I decided to go ahead and try this easy looking recipe to top it.  EASY, yes! YUMMY, yes!!! EGGY, NOOOO!  My curd took about 4 minutes to coat the back of a spoon, and I used bottled lemon juice. I also did not have lemon zest, but it was plenty lemony enough without it for me.  I served it warm over the gingerbread. Absolutely delicious!  After the curd cools and sets overnight, I just may have to make a tart or two...or fill cupcakes...or prepare a pie crust! :-)

Wow this was so easy not to mention so tasty. My Mom is from England and has made Lemon Curd for years in a double boiler and it took a long time. She has now swithched over to this recipe as it tastes as good as hers. We enjoy it on very thin pancakes or crumpets. Yummy!!

Made this today, scaled down to 5 servings, added an extra egg yolk, and strained it after cooking.  Very happy, it tastes delicious, lovely and tart!

I've made this several times now and it always come out perfectly. It is so easy doing it in the microwave and SO much cheaper than buying lemon curd in a jar. Try it with the simple scones from this site. YUMMY!!!

I took the advice of one reviewer to increase the eggs to 3 + 2 yolks, and the sugar to 1.25 cups. I juiced four lemons which yielded 3/4 cup; I subbed bottled lemon juice for the rest. It was a bit stronger than I would prefer, so maybe I will just use the 3/4 cup of juice next time.

This was very easy, and produced good results, despite the fact that I had to use salted butter and had no rind, but I simply increased the amount of lemon juice in it and that seems to have made up for the alterations well enough. I cooked it in 30 second bursts, and it was ready for cooling in 2 minutes.

I gave up trying to make curd years ago. I tried this today, and it turned out absolutely perfect!!!

I followed the recipe exactly. It took six turns in the microwave. I strained about a teaspoon of scrambled egg.

It makes about two cups! I will NEVER buy curd from the store again! This is so much better than anything on the shelves! Great recipe!

This was really good.  Came out great, I used fresh squeezed lemons, next time I may do have lemons and half bottle lemon juice and I will leave out the lemon zest as I don't like them generally, but wanted to make the recipe according to the direction.

This was a first for me and SO EASY!  I followed the directions as written and I only had to microwave for 2 minutes.  I probably could have gone one more but as I said this was my first time for lemon curd.  It is a bit tangy, I might add more sugar next time but over all this was GREAT and SIMPLE.  I did not need to temper the mixture I only strained it to remove the zest, as I knew my family would complain. This is very versatile I used it on angel food cake but the possiblities are endless. Thanks!

I have been making pudding and pie fillings in the microwave for 25 years and they always come out perfectly.  The only change I would make is like another reviewer wrote is that to use only the egg yolk.  I have never heard of using the white in a lemon pie or curd filling.  This is delicious.

Super easy. This was my first time making lemon curd, and I like to do things from scratch/on the stove, but after reading other stove-top recipes, this was completely worth using a microwave for. Works perfectly. 

I did find this to be very tart, though I used three large lemons. Maybe next time I will kick up the sugar a bit. Thanks!!!

Absolutely wonderful!  It's perfect as a filling for cakes, as the tartness cuts the sweetness of the cake and frosting.  Super easy to make, too!  I used a little less zest (about 2 lemons) and storebought lemon juice rather than fresh.  Awesome recipe.  Thanks!

Yummy!  Ok, so I actually didn't use the microwave b/c I don't like using it and just stirred almost constantly for about 6 min or so and then poured it through a strainer b/c i didn't want the zest in there.  I also subbed Xylitol for half of the sugar.  It was soooo easy and wonderful!  Thank you!

Pretty good & you can't beat how easy it is!! I think I added too much zest to mine though because it came out a touch bitter. I'm going to try this one again.

a tadlet too tart, but you're only using it in small doses anyway.

This is heavenly. While it was still warm I spread a layer of it on top of a baked & cooled cheesecake then popped that back in the fridge. At dessert time my family declared it the best ever! It's perfect on toasted english muffins too.

so easy and so very good.  I made this for a tart and topped with frozen red raspberries.  Has anyone tried this curd recipe with different flavors ie orange?

I was a little hesitant to make this because of the microwave prep. but I am so happy that I tried it. This has a bright tart flavor. I will make this again. I wonder if it would work with Splenda?

Certainly easy to make, but my husband detected an aftertaste that turned him off.

Wow, this is so easy and so tasty!  I love lemon anything and this has my stove top lemon curd recipe beaten hands down~thank you so much for this super recipe.  I prepared a pound cake, filled the center with fresh blueberries, dusted it with 10X sugar, and topped each slice with a dollop of this yummy curd! I am a Pampered Chef consultant and plan on sharing this recipe with my fellow chef "groupies" on my web site!

This was really simple to make. I had to be patient and stay by the microwave to keep an eye on it. Used 70% power on my microwave oven. Will never buy commercial lemon curd again.

Absolutely wonderful!  I couldn't believe how easy this was and how perfect! I'll never "buy" lemon curd again.  I spooned it on anglefood cake and my husband was crazy about it.  I saved some of it for scones I'm taking to a friend's home for a "British Tea" next week.  Thanks so much for such a great recipe.

I never would have believed it if I hadn't tried it myself!  I only needed a small amount of lemon curd so I made 1/3 of the recipe and stirred every 30 seconds.  It was delicious on poppy seed muffins.  Tip:  make sure your bowl is big enough that the curd doesn't boil over in the microwave like mine did the first try :) Thanks, Catseo, for saving me tons of time!
