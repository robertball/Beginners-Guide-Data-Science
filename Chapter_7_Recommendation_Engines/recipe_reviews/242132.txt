My husband and I have made these twice now. We really liked them, but thought they were missing something. We added 1/2 tsp of salt the second time and liked them much better. I also just left the apple skin on the second time. Since you blend them it was fine and you get the added nutrient benefit.  These have definitely been added to our Saturday morning routine and satisfy you for many hours.

These pancakes are a meal on their own. They're a hearty but healthy breakfast. We loved the use of the apple and banana. I may try other may try other fruits in the future. I did use salt, as suggested, and it did bring out the taste. We topped this delight with homemade blueberry, raspberry fruit topping and whipped cream. AMAZING!!! Definitely making these again!

If you are looking for a light, fluffy pancake, you'd better move on; however, if you are looking for something with great healthy substance, you've found it here!  These are dense and thick and delicious!  I tasted the batter and decided that indeed these could use a little salt as suggested by the first reviewer, so I added 1/2 teaspoon which seems to be right.  I made my granola using a recipe here that calls for some finely chopped nuts and dried fruits; these sweeteners were all the sugar the pancakes need.  One of my granddaughters thought these were very good, but the little one was suspicious of the texture---I suspect she will come around in time!  I will definitely make these again!  Thanks for this recipe, jboz53!

I LOVE these!! They are so yummy and filling.  I tried making these pancakes without peeling the apple as suggested and they were really good! This is such a fun, healthy alternative.  You can add syrup if you need the sweetness, although the blueberries really add a great, juicy explosion of flavor in every bite!

I was enthused to try this recipe. It was tasty! I liked it but, even more impressive, my 2 & 5 year old really liked them too.
    I did discover that this bakes up really well! The baked version tasted somewhere between coffee cake, bread pudding, and granola bars. I baked it about 30 minutes and drizzled my "Gallup Syrup" right before eating.
     I did blend the apple with the peeling on. Definitely tasty.
