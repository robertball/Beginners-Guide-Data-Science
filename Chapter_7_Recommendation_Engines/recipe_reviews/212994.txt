This was a pretty good recipe of Pinakbet. I was always so fond of this dish growing up, being that it was always available at family parties and my grandma's was hands down, the best! Some changes I made: I sauteed the onion, garlic, and tomatoes with patis(fish sauce) then added the pork. I added 1 cup of water with 1 tbs of bagoong alamang(no shrimp or prawns). I used butternut squash, because bitter melon is just not for me or my family. And I added zuchinni cubes. Brought everything to a medium boil for 15mins. But these are just my preferences, thanks for sharing :)

This recipe was fantastic, my dad isn't much a fan of Filipino and he said that he LOVED it.
Thanx!

A friend gave me some bitter melon, had no idea how to cook it. I found this recipe and had all the ingredients in my garden. I did not have any prawns so I omitted them. Did add  1 small fresh cayenne pepper, A little bland for us. It rocked. None left Will make this again!

It was an easy recipe. Instead of shrimp , I substituted with 3T bagoong alamang ( fermented baby shrimp ) and a dash of  patis ( 3 Crab Brand). It  was delicious. 
This is my new favorite vegetable dish.

I loved this dish! The blend of vegetables and cooking method used here resulted in a hearty dish. Very lovely flavors. I had to slightly alter a few details due to lacking a few ingredients. Lacked the bitter melon so I decided to substitute extra eggplant in its place. Didnâ€™t have prawns on hand so we used shrimp instead. This was a really good recipe, thanks for sharing.

I used chicken instead of pork as I had it on hand.  It was good, loved all of the vegies, but I thought it needed more flavor.

I used a 12 can of  v-8  tomato juice & cooked this in the slow cooker for about 4hrs. The seasonings from the v-8 made this really tasty...
