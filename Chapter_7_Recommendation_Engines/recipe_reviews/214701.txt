So, I made this this past weekend for Christmas Dinner. What I will say is, it was very easy to do. I think that is the only good thing about this recipe. It needs more ingredients with flavor. Im not the best cook so I am not the person to tweak another persons recipe. I gave it a 3 because it was easy to make and it was easy to understand. Having these ingredients in the house is so common with vegans BUT, again it needs something added to make the flavor other then the tofu. I was told all you could taste is that. I think if I try and make this again, I will add more Maple Syrup and maybe a bit more Lemon Juice... Again, NOT the worse one on this site, just needs a bust with another "BANG" flavor, more of one or a new one added. I will keep reading to see if somebody finds that one perfect add.

Loved this recipe.  I made it for a class and all the participants loved it.  It was lite and I love the flavor of the walnuts and maple syrup.  I also made another version substituting coconut palm sugar for the brown sugar and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.
