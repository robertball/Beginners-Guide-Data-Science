I only had 1 and 1/4 lbs pork loin . I was worried my crockpot was too big so i kept the whole can of pineapple and added 1 small can of pineapple juice. I decreased the spices only slightly. I cooked it 61/2 hours on low and it was so tender! I should have kept lid on crockpot as i pulled the pork as the juices evaporated but served over rice and it was very good!
