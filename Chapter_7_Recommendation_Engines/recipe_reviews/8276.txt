I loved this recipe.  I made it in the 9X13 pan and used extra creamy cool whip. I topped it with blueberries and sliced strawberries. It was very good the day I made it, but I put it in the refrigerator and the next day, it was even better.  The whole pan was gone in less than 24 hours!  It is delicious!!

I have made this 2 times and it has been a hit each time.  The first time I made this was for a bbq that I found out on arrival was also a birthday party.  Everyone at the party preferred this over the bakery bought cake.  The second time was for an outdoor concert.  Everyone who tried this sought me out to say they loved it.  I used both strawberries and blueberries on top.  Each to prepare.  Perfect combination for a great summer treat!

I don't get why this cake gets such great reviews.  It's not bad.  The frosting was weird tasting so I added a little sugar and some vanilla.  It was ok but I won't make it again. I think maybe with some fresh fruit it would have been much better.

Nice easy recipe.  I don't usually do easy, but I am 5 months pregnant and kind of lazy right now.  One tip...although it doesn't say, make sure you soften the cream cheese.   I softened mine, but apparently not enough.  I imagine you would have to near melt it to get it to completely blend with the cool whip.  Very yummy though!

I only gave this four stars because I think that this topping would be awesome on top of a fresh pound cake loaf made from scratch.  I felt like the topping deserved more than a yellow box cake.  But I added 2 tsp of almond extract to the cake mix and it was good.  Also, the topping is very pretty with blueberries and strawberries.
