I kept the eggplant slightly chunky.  It gave it more texture and substance. This is a very fresh and cool salad that I served with the Ugandan kebobs which are actually meatballs.  This is a great compliment to any spicy chicken or beef and would be particularly good in the summer.

Thanks for the recipe! This is an exotic and delicate treat. My husband and I recently moved to Tel Aviv, and when we went on our first Israeli date, I got something very similar to this and LOVED it! I am so happy to find a recipe for it so that I can enjoy it again and again. The smoked flavor is a little strong, and is somewhat unexpected especially as it is served cold - but it is very good!  Don't be afraid to try it! It really makes this dish unique. The smoking instructions given here are great - I never knew how to do that - Thank you!!

Very good!  I had this with pita and red peppers on the side, and my teenage son (who does NOT like eggplant) and I made a meal of it.  I did omit the smoking step and would like to try that another time.  If I truly loved eggplant, this would have been a 5* recipe because it is a very delicious way to consume that vegetable.
