I love this recipe!!!  A little coating mixture goes a long way so I found that I had a ton left over the first time I made it.  I've started substituing garlic powder and baking powder for the real thing.  Now I only pour what I need into a bag for shaking and I keep the rest in a separate bag in the refrigerator.  It stays fresh and ready for me to use for months and makes cooking a breeze!!!

My hubby loves shake and bake and said "tastes just like shake n bake, only better".  Great kid food too.  Tender, moist, no trans fats here folks.  I cut the recipe in half and used approx 1/2 of that on a cut up whole chicken.  I sprinkled the chicken with H20 b4 shaking, and sprayed the cooking sheet with oil.  At 400 degrees whole pieces of chicken take about 40 minutes in my oven, boneless pieces about 20 minutes.

I am more than thrilled that I found this recipe!  As much as  I like fried foods, I'm NO good at doing it...at all!  Well, this recipe is just as good, if not better than store bought, the chicken was very tender.  I took another reviewers advise & cut the salt in 1/2 (because of the celery & garlic salts) but next time I will use the correct amount of salt & cut the celery salt in 1/2.  Thanks so much Sara, for the recipe & saving me some cash!

Just roughly measured the ingredients. I used herb-seasoned stuffing mix and pure (not extra virgin) olive oil.  It is the addition of the oil that is key to the meat's success, ensuring that it will turn out crispy and golden. I used this mixture in the recipe for "Oven Fried Pork Chops," and it gave that coating the oil and extra seasoning I felt it needed.  The two recipes were a good combo.

This recipe was a good starting point, but calls for way way way way toooo much salt!  I made a small batch of this - it was enough to cover two leg quarters, two breasts, and two tender loins.    4 slices bread - bake at 283 for 25 minutes till completely dry and lightly brown.  Break up and put in food processor till all fine crumbs.  This made a little more than one cup of crumbs for me.    1/4 tsp salt 1/4 tsp paprika 1/4 tsp celery Seeds 1/4 tsp ground pepper 1/4 tsp garlic granules 1/4 tsp onion powder dash basil dash oregano  add all ingredients and process again till combined.  Place in large bag.  Add one piece of chicken at a time and shake till covered.    Bake chicken pieces on greased cookie sheet for about 40 minutes at 375 degrees.  Check temperature with internal thermometer and make sure it's at lease 165 degrees.  Yum!  We had cheese topped broccoli and rice on the side.  Double yum!

Great recipe except I cut out the Salt. You get enough with the Garlic salt and Celery salt. Have made this recipe many times. Family loves it and it's better than store bought.

I made a half recipe of this. I omitted the additional salt and used Beau Monde seasoning instead of celery salt because that was all I had on hand. Looking at the bread crumbs, I didn't think there was enough seasoning so I threw in more. A half recipe covered eight large-ish chicken legs. Great fill in for the commercially made coating but with less by products. Thumbs up from the family, I'll make this again with the increased spices.

Truly excellent. I was about to make dinner when I realized that I had forgotten the coating mix for the chicken. This is great. It's less expensive and has less sodium than the boxed stuff.

Thank You! My husband is one of the pickiest eaters, especially when it comes to chicken, but I made this for dinner with boneless chicken breasts, and he said it was some of the best chicken he had ever had! PEOPLE you have GOT to try this!

This is a great recipe! I won't buy commercial shake n bake again, this is so easy. I changed the servings to 2, because I only had one cup of bread crumbs, but it made just enough for one chicken. My family really enjoyed it.

This was absolutely wonderful!!  Much better than the commercial kind.  Used a cut up fryer and chicken came out of the oven (400 degrees for 50 minutes) tender and juicy.  There's enough mix for at least one more chicken!  Thanks for submitting, Sara.  Will definitely make again!

My "Ashamalie" is a total shake'em and bake'em freak and was so in the mood yesterday. I had zero time to run to the store as I had to work last night. I told her that if she could find a recipe on my site, I'd make it. I really thought I'd be off the hook, but dangit, she found this and was grinning from earring to earring. This was super Sara, but because I don't like a lot of salt in my foods, I cut it considerably. Thanks lots!

I used an entire packet of saltines and 1 cup of PC Italian Breadcrumbs for the mixture. I also substituted celery seed for celery salt due to the salt already in the crackers. I wet the chicken legs and placed them into the mixture and hand-coated before transferring to a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. I baked in a preheated oven at 400 degrees for 35 mins. It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. My 4 and 5 yr old boys had two pieces each. (see photo #3)

I joined just to rate this (but I should have joined years ago).

I have made this just as written many times and my husband loves it!  It's so much less expensive and better tasting than the commercial brand.

To those who worried about throwing away the excess: just freeze it!  I make a very large batch and keep it in the freezer.  I take out just what I need (it won't freeze solid).

I like to use this on bone-in chicken so I cook it at 350 degrees for about an hour (and I write that on the Ziplock bag).

What's best about this recipes is that it's so versatile to whatever you have in the cupboard. I halved the recipe and divided it into thirds, throwing the other two servings into the freezer. I didn't measure anything except the oil and bread crumbs (I used Italian).  I just tossed this and that into the mix, but the recipe gave me a great outline to start with. I used my mix on pork. Delish!

With a few "tweeks" I think I made it even better.  Just substitute a tsp celery seed and a tsp of granulated garlic for the two "salt "versions and a tsp of onion powder for the minced onion.  Also, add a teaspoon or two of poultry seasoning in place of the basil, parsley and oregano. Bake at 375 deg for one hour, removing the breast pieces at the 45 minute mark.  I also used Italian bread crumbs.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great alternative to the box mix.  I used it on pork chops.  The recipe makes a lot so keep that in mind before making it. I halved the recipe and used about a cup or so for 6 chops.  I stored the unused portion in the fridge.  I only used a teaspoon of Kosher salt, and used garlic powder and ground celery seeds in place of the salt versions.  For the herbs, my idea of a pinch was 1/4 teaspoon of each (for the halved recipe).  I'm thinking about grinding up Corn Flakes and using that for the bread crumbs when I mix up the next batch.  There's a lot of different flavor combinations that can be made with this recipe by changing the herbs or type of bread crumbs used.  That's a plus to help keep meals interesting.

My son, who is not a big chicken eater, is giving you 5 stars on this one. My only caution is I ended up throwing a lot of this away both times I made it because of excess. The last time I cut the servings down to 4 and it was still too much for 4 large chicken breasts. I'm cutting it down to 2  next time. Easy problem to fix! Great recipe.

This was excellent!  I didn't use the celery salt and garlic salt (just use powders instead) so I needed more salt.  Tasty though!  I mixed 1/2 cup squash puree with an egg to coat the chicken then dipped in the shake and bake!  Moist and delicious!

Of course when I went to the pantry I was out of shake n bake seasoning...so I went straight to all recipes...and found this recipe.  FANTASTIC!! I followed the advice of others and cut the celery salt to 1/2 TBS.  I also used garlic powder and onion powder instead of the salts.  This was absolutely delicious.  Everyone in my family loved it.  It does make alot.  I breaded 6 thick pork chops and I could have easily halved the recipe.  Only other thing I did different was I forgot the parsley flakes and I added a bit (1/2 TBSP) of pork chop seasoning.  This  will be my recipe for shake n bake from now on!!!!

Made this on the fly for the kids' lunch today and it was a big hit! It was simple and quick to prepare and there were no leftovers!  Love finding homemade alternatives for their favorites, since it's cost-effective and much healthier with all the gmo issues etc. Thank you!!

This was AWESOME!  I had defrosted 6 large chops & didn't have enough boxed Shake & Bake to make the dinner I'd been craving.  This was just the fix!!  I made 1/2 the recipe and omitted the salt until the end.  I wanted all the specific salts/seasoning combinations & then figured I would adjust the salt later.  It actually DID taste too salty when I went ahead and added the whole adjusted measure into the mix.  So much so that I actually added in another cup of crumbs (but added nothing else in terms of spices or oil).  Honestly, once baked on the meat, it was definitely not as salty as I'd feared and I almost regretted the extra crumbs I'd thrown in.  I do recommend that you stick to the herb salts (celery, garlic etc) and then adjust your salt by lessening the table salt.  If you insist on celery seed, I suggest you GRIND it because it will not have the exact same punch if left as whole seeds.

I used this with thin cut pork chops.  I scaled the recipe back to half and still had lots left when I was finished.  The taste is wonderful.  Youngest daughter said this is the best, best, best recipe ever.  :)

I made this recipe cut down to serve four. I also used celery seed instead of celery salt, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt. It was still a little too salty for me, but very good. A friend actually likes salty things and thought it was perfect.  I'll leave 3/4 of the salt out next time.  I used mine on chicken tenders, baked at 350F until done.

We made this last night on drumsticks and they came out so good we're making it again tonight with thighs.  Only things we changed were we used PANKO bread crumbs instead of regular, garlic powder in place of garlic salt, celery seed in place of celery salt, and a bit more kosher salt to make up the difference.  Also added a couple dashes of cayenne for a teeny kick.  The panko is so much more crispy and delicious and doesn't get sticky or soggy at all, try it!!

This is a great recipe.  I reduced the salt. a lot and it worked great.  First I did not added the salt, reduced the celery salt to 3/4 tbsp and changed the garlic salt to garlic powder.  This makes enough for several meals if you use a separate bag to coat the meat.  will be making again.

I'm giving it five stars because it tastes exactly like Shake 'n' Bake and it is very easy. I personally don't even like Shake 'n' Bake because I think the celery salt is too strong and it has no other flavor. I made it for my husband who liked it a lot.

I'm pretty sure this would also work with pork.

This is good but as others have said, too much salt. I cut back the salt, used celery seed, dehydrated onion and garlic powder and it was delicious. I have lots left over in the fridge, can't wait to try it on something other than chicken. Thanks!

This has completely replaced Shake and Bake in my house! I use it mostly for drumsticks.  I do significantly decrease the amounts given as for 5 drumsticks it makes way too much. I sometimes just use whatever spices I feel like adding and I have never added a tablespoon of salt to this or most other recipes so I cannot comment on the saltiness as presented.

Friends and family gave this a thumbs up for flavor. I only had enough shake and bake for half of the chicken so I tossed this together leaving out the minced onion and basil (I was out). The result was equal to the shake and bake flavored chicken. Thanks Sal.

The family liked this.  Great home-made copy cat recipe.  I made a whole batch and mixed it all in my food processor.  (I make my own bread crumbs from left over ends and such.)  

I omitted the vegetable oil completely.  Didn't have celery salt, so used a little celery seed.

I cut up two whole chicken breasts into pieces roughly 4" x 2" and just rolled the pieces in the mix.  The mix stuck to the chicken juices.  

I ended up using about 1/2 the mix, so I am freezing the left-over crumb mix; I never contaminated it since I expected extra.  

I baked at 400 deg F for about 20-30 minutes.  The bottom of the chicken pieces were soggy, so next time I'll elevate them on a rack or use a broiler pan so hopefully the bottom crumbs will crisp up.

Unfortunately the shake 'n bake recipe here is not the original chicken recipe of 1965 that was a flour based highly seasoned coating mix if you remember with that shake 'n bake after cooking the chicken you could take the drippings from the chicken  and make the best gravy
you can't do that with today's shake 'n bake.
The original shake 'n bake did not have bread crumbs or corn flakes in the mixture.

I cut this recipe in half, and it still makes a ton. Next time I'll make the full recipe and divide it up to freeze for other times. I used celery seed, garlic powder and onion powder instead of the salt blends. Also used a few pinches of Italian seasoning instead of the basil, parsley and oregano as I didn't have any left. Let the salt amount the same. Cooked chicken legs/thighs on 400F for 50 minutes on a rack over a baking sheet to drain away fat. Crispy, delicious and better than the box!

My whole family raved about this, and requested to make it quite often. I was short on the bread crumbs, so I used 2 c. bread crumbs and 2 c. crushed whole wheat flake cereal. I also was out of paprika and oregano, but the taste was still great. I may end up trying this on fish as well. Much cheaper than store bought, over-all. I'm all for that!

I wanted to try this recipe as I like shake and bake, but husband doesn't. I made a few adjustments, because I didn't have all the spices.  I used celery seed instead of celery salt, powdered garlic instead of minced garlic, and powdered onion instead of minced.   I think the amount of servings must mean the equivalent amount of envelopes of S & B!  I had a lot left over!  Enough to use several more times! I baked chicken legs and thighs for 45 minutes at 400 degrees, turning about halfway through the cooking time. Husband liked it, kid loved it!  It had a great flavor.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe was great! Way better than anything you can buy in a box. I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't have all ingredients (missing celery salt, and opted out of adding oil) so I can't comment on the recipe as a whole. What I can say that even without those two above ingredients, it was tasty. My family loved it.

I have used this mix a couple of times and it really rivals the expensive store bought brands.  I used this mix and baked my chicken in a convection oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and it came out juicy.

5+ stars! absolutely delicious! I know I'm not writing anything more than what others have written, but the chicken was perfectly tender and the flavor so delicious - everyone loved it! It makes a lot too so I refridgerated the excess, I probably used 1/4 of it for 5 chicken breasts. I followed the recipe closely, the only change I made was to swap garlic powder for the garlic salt. It was great and we'll have this regularly!

This is really awesome!  Glad I took the time to prepare this from scratch rather than buying the box.  I used panko crumbs and didn't use any of the "salts" but granulated garlic and a small amount of celery seed instead.  I did use the regular salt in the amount indicated tho.  There was so much flavor.  My family raved about it!  I cooked bone-in pieces at 400 degrees for about an hour.  Amazing!

Great.
I read other reviews that said it was salty so I used celery seed instead of celery salt - it was ok. It didn't taste too salty.

Kid tested, verry yummy! I omitted the salt since there was enough salt already in the recipe, tastes just as good.

Used this as the coating for our chicken tenders tonight.  Only difference was to substitute garlic powder for the garlic salt.  My daughter asked if we were eating "Shake and Bake".  Made this with the "cajun spicy potato wedges".  We will keep this one in the rotation for sure.

Extremely salty!!  I may try it again and omit the salt completely and decrease the pepper.  We had to scrape the crust off just to eat it.  A waste of a good pork chop.

This was great! I will add a little less salt next time and I didn't use the oil. I just shaked chicken thighs in the mixture and baked and added some Parmesan cheese.

This is amazing!  My family loved it.  I used it on a package of inexpensive chicken thighs and they were delicious.  I can't wait to try it on boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  It was so moist and flavorful.

This was awesome for chicken breast tenders. I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I used ritz cracker crumbs. Since I used the crackers, I decided to cut back the salt a little and it was perfect. The spices just go really well together. I baked it at 400 for about 25 minutes and the chicken was juicy and delicious! Served w/ mashed potatoes and corn.

Really good! Makes a lot so either cut the servings or put some in a bag in the fridge.  I wish I had made all of it so I could save it!  I cut it in half and we found it just a little salty, but still very good!

I've used it for chicken, pork chops, breaded zucchini, etc.  The recipe makes quite a bit and (since I make my own dried bread crumbs from left-over bread) it costs very little to make.  The purchased product costs $2.50 per box so this is quite a welcome addition to my recipe box. Thanks for sharing!

I used garlic and onion powder instead of salts, and cut the recipe in half because I only had a bit of bread crumbs on hand.  This was excellent!  Kids loved it, and hubby loved it, and he hates shake and bake.  Definitely a keeper!

This was really good.  My only complaint is that the celery salt was a bit too prominent for my taste.  I forgot to add the oil before coating the chicken so I  sprayed the chicken pieces with Olive Oil spray prior to cooking.  That seemed to work just fine.  They browned up nicely.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again.

I halved the recipe, made 2 cups of my own whole wheat bread crumbs - toasted 5-6 slices of bread, cooled, then put in processor to make crumbs. I used olive oil in this recipe, skipped the minced onion and garlic and added a half tsp. garlic powder instead. Baked 7 bone in chicken thighs at 400 degrees for about 50 min. It is amazingly delicious!

This was very good!  I didn't have celery salt, so I substituted Lawry's seasoned salt.  I also used olive oil, hoping to make it a bit healthier.  Next time I'll substitute wheat germ for some of the bread crumbs.

I used italian-seasoned bread crumbs, and this recipe turned out very well!  I used the same proportions of herbs as suggested (give or take...) and it really did smell and taste like the store bought stuff.  I will make this again.  Not too spicy for my two young sons.

Wowsers, never had so many compliments on shake and bake pork chops before! I had to make some changes only because I was out of a few items (don't you just hate when that happens)?  I had no bread crumbs so I pounded 4 cups of seasoned stuffing mix that I had left over from Christmas and were still good. I cut back a smidge on the salts by completely omitting the celery salt (I was out) and decreasing the regular to 3/4 tablespoon. And this was so easy and not MESSY! No dredging back and forth between eggs and crumb mixture... literally shake it and bake it without buying the stuff from the store. This will be our go to recipe for baking chops... thanks so much for the share!

Soooo delicious. This recipe is the real deal. You will not be disappointed! Bakes up crispy and nice, and the meat's MOIST!  I promise.  If you're sensitive to salt make the adjustment and keep it moving. Will be doing this with pork next. The family really enjoyed this chicken. I know, because they told me repeatedly.  I had quite a bit of coating left so I froze the rest. I might do half recipe next time... MIGHT.

I have a confession...I Love this recipe!! I have a box of store-bought "coating mix" in my cabinet (that someone else bought). I threw the packs away and kept the bags for shaking THIS recipe on my chicken legs. I have used this recipe several times and my very picky girls ask for "crunchy chicken legs" every week now!

I liked this, but I can't get my breadcrumbs crispy. I tried it on pork chops, and maybe that's my problem. Must try again on chicken.

I thought it was very good.  I didn't add the TBS of salt and substituted onion powder and garlic powder for the minced.  I also left out the oil and it was really good. Thanks.   I will not buy shakenbake anymore.

Used this for bone-in pork chops even though AR lists as homemade shake and bake for chicken...I will use this again for pork and will try if for chicken as well.  Recipe would make a ton of this, so I reduced to 2 servings, which still made a lot of topping.  Jack and I liked the results which I baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes (thin chops).

Oh my gosh, this is delicious!!!  And it's so very forgiving.  You can use whatever you have or like.  I followed the recipe almost as written, I cut the salt to 1 tsp. and used Italian flavored breadcrumbs, because that's what I had.  I made the full batch and it took about a cup for an 8 piece chicken.  I threw the rest in a bag in the freezer.  What a nice thing to have on hand and so inexpensive compared to store bought.  Probably better for you, too.  I dredged the chicken in egg before coating with mix.  YUM and thank you for posting!

Great recipe! I didn't have celery salt, so I substituted with celery seed. I also didn't have garlic salt, so I substituted with garlic powder. I think this was better because the recipe was not as salty as it may have been otherwise. Also, I changed the recipe settings for 2 servings and was able to get 6 small boneless chops covered. Thank you!

I used this recipe as a guideline as my husband loves shake n bake but I can't eat it because I am on a very low sodium diet. I used 2 cups of Panko that I whirled in my food processor to make finer, 3 tbsps canola oil, 1/2 tsp each salt free Cajun seasoning, poultry seasoning, oregano, basil, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley. I had 14 thin fast fry pork chops which I baked at 400 for 25 minutes on parchment paper lined baking sheet, turning halfway through. I don't usually comment on the healthiness of a recipe but as written this would have been way too salty, original sodium 1985 mgs new sodium 85 mgs.

So much better, healthier, and cheaper than the store bought version!  We made a half version and omitted the salt (per others' suggestions).  We also omitted the minced onion and minced garlic (we were VERY short on time).  It was still fantastic even without these ingredients!  We plan to make a full version with everything but the oil, salt, minced garlic, and minced onion, to keep on hand.  Then we'll just pull out a 1/2 cup at a time and add 2 t. oil when we're ready to use it (and if we have time, a little minced onion and garlic).  Thanks for the great homemade version, sal!

I did like the flavors in this, but it was MUCH too salty, and I had used garlic powder instead of garlic salt because of other reviews warning about the saltiness. I wish I had used celery seed instead of celery salt and had cut back the amount of regular salt, also. As it was, it bordered on inedible for me and a couple of others eating here tonight. I used it on chicken wings and half the recipe was plenty for coating a dozen full wings (24 pieces in all).

I have made this several times now with the following changes.  I omit the plain salt altogether.  I also when it comes to the celery salt and garlic salt make them scant on their measurements. I also cut this in half and still have plenty to do 8 to 10 thighs.  When I do this for the 2 cups of bread crumbs I put 1/2 C of panko crumbs to give it a bit more crunch.

I scaled this recipe down and didn't measure but I know I didn't use the whol amount of salt or celery salt and subbed garlic powder for the salt and dried onion.  Also added a little mustard powder.  I've never made shake n bake before so I don't know how you're supposed to use it but I dipped chicken strips in egg then the crumb mixture and baked on an ungreased sheet at 400 for 20 minutes withouth flipping.  They were crispy and crunchy and perfect for our breaded chicken wraps with ranch, fries and corn!

This was delicious! The changes I made was to use Panko instead of bread crumbs and I marinaded the breasts in peppercorn ranch dressing.  This really helped the panko stick to it .  It was moist and delicious, Very flavorful!!

LOVE THIS! I was so excited I found this. We love Shake 'N' Bake Chicken and this recipe is so much cheaper for more coating. I agree with other reviewers. I cut back on the salt and used powdered garlic, powdered onion, and Italian seasoning. This recipe is GREAT! It's also very versatile. I've used it on chicken, pork chops, fish, baked zucchini slices and other veggies. I want to try it using cornbread crumbs sometime in the future. THANKS to the person who came up with this recipe!

I made this due to husband loving it.  He said it better not be homemade, but loved the taste of it.  I think it tastes better than the real stuff.  Only made 1/2 batch but turned out great. Used it on boneless breasts.

Ive been to allrecipes many times b4 but this recipe made up my mind. I signed up here today just to post this comment!    Perfect imposter recipe I have to say - probably even better since its been many years since I have used "shake and bake".  Brought back some memories indeed!   Many thanks for a great site and a great recipe.

Thank you for this recipe. I had a box of stuff that I didn't realize had egg in it, and my son is allergic. So I came here and found this recipe. My only changes were using fresh bread to make my own bread crumbs, because I didn't have any. And I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

Absolutely the best.   I do not add the salt, as we do not use it anymore.  I use more garlic or onion and any other herb or spice that I have.  Each time it is different, but always delicious.

While I liked this recipe, I gave it a 3 as it would have been far too salty had I used all of the salts called for.  I used celery seed and omitted the garlic salt.

My husband loves it when he calls to ask what is for dinner and I say "shake and bake".  This is so easy to throw together and dress up any meat. Throw in some cayenne pepper for some added spice!  Very yummy!  Thanks

This is awesome! Very easy and tasty. I didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder in place of the garlic salt and the minced garlic and it still turned out good. You probably only need a generous 1/2 cup of this mix for a whole cut up chicken.

Just as easy to replace celery /  garlic salts to their own powders to reduce sodium contents. I would choose to only add minced garlic and onion (raw) until meal prep. I frequently make homemade croutons so I easily can make own crumbs. I love to raid the Wally World's reduced bread cart.  Any hard roll varieties are my preferred favorite to use. The more they have "hard rolls" the more I make!! The smell of the bread drying is incredible!!! Cut and lay out on towel covered kitchen table. 2 days later,  voila! I prefer to put dried bread into large bowl(s). Easier to control pour  -- Place even layer on baking sheet. Lightly drizzle w/ veg oil or butter, season (prefer own house season - you can be versatile) and bake! Just be on top of bake times for 30 seconds too long literally can burn.  Usually at 425 degrees bake 4 mins, stir lightly, bake another 3 - 4 more. Color should be like toast, light brown. Will continue to darken slightly. I lay out on cooling racks for 2 mins. Turn back out on table w/ towels. Let cool completely, bag into zipper type bags or airtight containers. I prefer to wait until next day to pulverize  into crumbs.

Great recipe! My hubby & kids all commented on how great the chicken tasted. One of my kids (the pickiest one!) said it tasted like it was from a restaurant!! The only thing I would tell people is that amount it makes is quite a bit, I coated 15 large sized chicken drumsticks and had about a third or half left over. Next time I will reduce the recipe amounts.

Very versatile. Every time I make it the spices are just a bit different. I use it for chicken, pork, even fish. I love curry, so I add curry powder, extra garlic, etc. I freeze the remainder and use and refreeze as necessary.

Made as described except for the following subs: 2c Italian bread crumbs and 2c panko in place of the regular bread crumbs; used kosher salt; Lawrys seasoned salt in place of the paprika; garlic powder in place of garlic salt; and onion powder in place of minced onion. Quite tasty, crisp, and not too salty. Mixed ingredients in a 2L storage container, spooned out as needed and have lots left over. Better, IMHO, than S&B. Good luck!

The only change I made was to use GLUTEN FREE Bread Crumbs and not adding the oil till the end that's when I knew it was way too much so I bagged up half of it for a later date then added the oil. 1. I don't think the oil is needed, it would coat the meat fine without the oil and 2. as others suggested it was slightly too salty and that's even with me using garlic powder instead of garlic salt so next time I'll take the reviews of others and I'll use less salt. But other than that THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!! My husband said he wished he had 4 more porkchops cuz it was so good. Will DEFINITELY make again!

Really, really good! I used this on chicken drumsticks to feed a group of 11 children. You know it’s a keeper when children come back asking for seconds and thirds! It’s a little on the salty side for my preference, so next time I might cut the salt in half and see what I think. Will definitely make this again!

I was so sad when Hodgson Mill quit making their gluten free seasoned coating mix. It had been my goto for a long time. Now that I could no longer find it, I needed to find a replacement. I found this recipe. I did this using gluten free Panko. I also used garlic powder and onion powder instead of the minced and increased both of them to a full teaspoon each. It was amazing and even better than the Hodgson Mill (although I loved that I could also make gravy with it. I may try this one with cassava flour instead of the panko and see if I can use it to make a gravy mix). This one is definitely a keeper!

This was wonderful.  Made it for pork chops.  I sprayed the pork chops with spray oil....then put them in the breading.  Love that you can tweak the spices....which you can't do with the store bought stuff.

Great recipe. I’ve used it a lot. Thanks. The best part for me (besides the taste) is being in control of  what goes into it and avoiding the chemistry class reading the store bought ingredients.

The Whole Family loves this and I love making!! I feel better using the spices in my own cupboard, than all the chemicals they use and call it Shake-n-Bake. I omitted the salt  and also just used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Our family doesn't use a lot of salt and we found it to be perfect.  We use it on pork chops and the meat comes out juicy and tasty.  My two teenage boys love coming home and knowing that we are having home made shake 'n bake...your family will love it too!

I made this gluten free using good gluten free breadcrumbs. It was FANTASTIC! Way more crispy than regular shake n bake. My picky eater loved it! 

I made some tweaks based on what I had or didn't have spice wise. I used celery seed instead of celery salt, garlic and onion powders instead of minced and I cut the salt a bit. I used healthy pinches of basil, oregano and parsley. I cut the recipe in half and still have some left after doing a package of 6 drumsticks and a bit over a pound of chicken tenderloins.

I cut the salt way back and used substitutes for the onion and garlic salt and it was WONDERFUL. Use about a 1/4 to 1/2 cup per use and it lasts forever.

That 1 tblsp of salt is a typ-o. It should be 1 tsp!!!

I didn't have celery salt. I added  1 tsp Stubb's chicken rub & dash of jalapeno seasoning. Since the comments say this makes a lot I placed about 1 cup of the crumbs mixture in another gallon-sized bag, added the chicken tenders and then added the crumb mixture accordingly so I could use the leftovers w/o fear of contamination from raw chicken. I plan on trying the other half on fish. This turned out well and my family liked it.

This was great. I used it on pork chops so I added a pinch of thyme. For breadcrumbs I used panko...nice and crispy.  Didn't have dried minced onion or garlic so just used powder. Will certainly make it again!

I was looking for a gluten free option.  This was easy to modify, I replaced the bread crumb with a 1/4 cup of rice flour. I skipped the salt and celery salt, and add some red pepper flakes. I didn’t use any oil, I just wet the drum sticks and then gave them a shake.  It turned out nice and crispy and tasted good.  Thanks

I like having a big bag of this around for a quick way  to treat some chicken on a busy day. We have adjusted seasonings to suit our tastes, as we prefer some stronger flavors. This is just so darn convenient.

Very good and easy to make.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  It was a bit salty, but good flavor overall.  This was used on 4 large pork chops and I used 1/3 of the recipe amounts.  Thank you for sharing!

I love, love, love this recipe.  I make LARGE amounts and keep in the freezer.  I reduce the amount of salt and that is about the only change I make.  My husband loves this.  I have also used this with crushed/pulverized pork rind chips for a low-carb version.  I used regular crumbs, Italian crumbs, Panko,  or a mix depending on what I have on hand.  Make this if you haven't.  Much better than purchased.  Also, bake chicken at 400 degrees.  Time varies on what pieces you are baking and whether it is boneless or bone-in.  I bake leg quarters for 45 to 50 minutes depending on their size.

I used this mixture on chicken thighs just the way it was written except for the amount of salt.  We find most things too salty so since I was using celery salt I cut the regular salt in half.  The chicken was very good and I have the remaining breading safely stored in the freezer.  I shook my chicken in a zipper bag with only one and one-half cups of the crumbs so the rest was not contaminated and safe to save.  I will use this often.  grammagennie

I made this tonight and it was phenomenal. I had to use what I had on hand so instead of Panko breadcrumbs I used crushed up oyster crackers. From now on I will use crushed up saltines, it was that good.  The recipe does not tell you what temperature and/or how long to cook so after looking through some other reviews I attempted to bake for 40 minutes at 400° but my oven started smoking after about 10-15 minutes (could've  been this oven - just moved and unfamiliarity with this oven) so I adjusted the temperature to 375 for the  remaining 45 minutes. Even the thickest chicken leg was done. Everyone including my six-year-old grandson who rarely eats  devoured it down to the bone. I was surprised I never thought of putting oil in the mixture but it worked out perfectly. I lined my cookie sheet with foil and sprayed with Pam for a quick cleanup. Like another reviewer said I made sure to rinse the chicken pieces with water before putting in the ziplock mixture. Definitely the best fried chicken recipe I've ever used. A keeper.

This is excellent! I make this with absolutely no salt, by substituting Mrs. Dash for the salt, celery seed for the celery salt, and garlic powder for the garlic salt. Tastes great and is easy to make. This is great on pork chops as well as chicken, and if you prefer extra crispy shake and bake over the original, substitute panko bread crumbs for 1/2 of the plain bread crumbs.

I left out the celery salt, because for my preference it is too strong of a flavor, and I never add salt to anything as I like some salt, but my husband does not, so I salt at the table if needed. For us salt was not needed! My husband and I both liked this alot. After I coated the chicken I placed it on a cooling rack that I had placed in a cookie sheet. I baked the chicken 20 minutes, turned, and baked 20 to 30 minutes longer in a 350° oven. Turned out very close to fried chicken, but healthier. Will definitely make this again.

Pretty good.  I halved the recipe - there are only 2 of us and I didn't want a ton if it if we didn't like it.  I used tis on pork chops and they were pretty good.  I think they need more seasoning - we like highly seasoned food but not spicy hot.  I added a little thyme and rosemary.  Next time I'll up the garlic - you can never have too much garlic and I'll add about 1/2 times more of the other spices.  I don't use garlic or celery salt - it's redundant and I used less salt than called for but I did use all the other spices called for in addition to those mentioned above.  I used ground celery seed.  A keeper with some tweeks!  Thanks for posting this.

After reading the reviews, I did make some changes.  I used 2 cups of bread crumbs and 2 cups of panko.  1 1/2 tsps. of salt, 1 tsp. of celery seed,  1 tsp. of garlic powder (omitted the minced garlic).  Measured out 1 cup of coating per gallon ziploc.    Stored in freezer.  Rubbed chicken in the oil and the gallon bag provides shaking pieces with no problem. One  cup of coating was enough for 4 thighs and 4 legs with a tad left over, in which I patted on top of chicken before baking.  I baked chicken on top of a cooling rack with a foil lined cookie sheet beneath it.  Turned out very crispy and juicy.  This is my now go to recipe.

I changed bread crumbs to cornflake crumbs. I happend to see a box of them at my grocers and picked them up to try.  It worked very well in this recipe and I think make it a little crisper. Either way, the recipe tastes very good. I put the extra in a mason jar and vacuum packed it and put it in the fridge.  I'd make this again for sure.

I made a few slight changes with the spices. I like it a little more spicy so added some cayenne pepper to it and it was delicious.I used it with pork chops instead of chicken. I will definitely be making it again soon. Better than the store bought.

This is just like Shake n Bake and although it made me laugh because it was what my mom used when we were growing up, we all really like it.  I cut the recipe in half  and instead of adding the oil to the mixture I put it on either the chicken or pork chops then hand coat both sides.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good basic recipe. I did not add the oil to the recipe. I did add 2 teaspoons of sugar, half cup of flour, and one teaspoon of cornstarch. I did add the oil to the pan enough to coat the pan. I baked it at 400 for 20 minutes and then I added some more oil to the pan and baked it for another 20 minutes. Understand I am one of those cooks that tends to add a little bit here and a little bit there and taste everything before I finish even the shake and bake coating before I used it. I never use anything without testing it first. So season it to your liking. I found with adding the flour, I had to season it a little bit more. Not anymore basil or oregano. Just salt, pepper, celery salt, and garlic. It did turn out very very tender in very moist. Just some ideas that I pulled out of a couple of different recipes including this one. Good luck!!

salt..celery salt..garlic salt??  way too  much sodium!  i left out the celery salt, changed the garlic salt to garlic powder and reduced the standard table salt to a 1/2 tablespoon,changed the minced onion to onion powder.. those were my only changes. family loved it. not quite the same as "store bought" box shake n bake but when is anything the same as store bought. Nonetheless  it was very tasty and the chops were tender, not dry or chewy. will make this again with the changes I made.

Great easy recipe. I recipe will usually coat 3-4 meals worth of both chicken and fish. I coated the pieces with buttermilk first which was really good.

Great recipe! I used 1/2 Panko, 1/2 regular bread crumbs, other than that, it came out amazing! Quick and easy to make! My very picky son not only had 2nds, but was picking the crumbs off the pan and sprinkling them over his corn! He told me it was the best dinner EVER and was really, really good! My whole family loved this crumb recipe over all others tried!

The only change I made was to the salt issue.  I only used Kosher salt and then used celery seeds (crushed) and garlic powder not the salt and it turned out wonderful.  I also used grapeseed oil as I don't use vegetable oil.  Definitely better than the commercial shake and bake.

Loved it! I did omit the salt and used 1 tbsp of chicken bouillon instead. Also used garlic powder  because that was all I have on hand. This will be my go to chicken coating.

I loved it fast and easy . I made my own  bread crumbs and took half corn flakes . It was  very good will make it again. There was enough for two meals. Put it in  a container in the freezer.  The only thing is I substituted granulated onion , garlic, celery seed not all the salt.

This is awesome a lot better than store bought!! I did reduce the salt because I had to use some Ritz crackers as I didn't have enough bread crumbs! This will definitely be added to the family cook book!!

Haven't bought Shake n Bake since I found this recipe about 5 years ago.   4 cups of bread crumbs is about one 15 oz round box so I just use one box each time instead of measuring.   I sybarite granulated onion and granulated garlic for minced since it is finer and coats better.

Use pork chops and substituted Doritos and tortilla chips for bread crumbs and spread the oil on the meat instead of in the mix. Cooked at 400 for 25 mins. So much better.

I have made this several times over the past year. This recipe is awesome! It tastes very close to actual shake n bake. I love knowing exactly what I've put into the mix and having the ability to control the amount of each ingredient I put in. I will never go back to the boxed stuff. I make a large batch of the mix without adding the oil and store it in a resealable bag. When I want to make it, I grab a bag and put some of this mixture in it and add a bit of oil and mix it up. I've also started to make my own breadcrumbs using dried out bread ends. The blender I use to make the breadcrumbs grinds it almost to a fine powder (much finer than the breadcrumbs you buy at the store). If you do the same and have almost a fine powder for bread crumbs, I would suggest you double the quantity of the seasonings. My first batch using my home ground breadcrumbs was a bit bland. I went back and doubled the seasoning to the remaining mixture I had stored. The next time I'd used the mixture, it was fantastic! Thank you for this recipe!!!

I did not have celery salt and garlic salt so I just added celery seed and garlic powder and just added a little bit of more salt and it turned out great. I had even realized that I forgot the minced garlic and onion and it still tasted great!! I will use this recipe again.

Everyone loved this breading.  Because I didn't have the exact ingredients, I used panko crumbs, omitted the celery salt, and used garlic powder and onion powder.  This recipe makes a huge batch.  I halved it and still had a lot to throw out after breading 5 huge chicken breasts.  Very good and will make again.

I made this once when I didn't have any of the brand at home. It just reminded me of my younger years and wanted to introduce my children still at home with me to it (18 and 20). It was really good! After my kids raved about it I went out and bought the box stuff and while I didn't use bone in chops this time (which could have made a huge flavor difference as well as cuts the time down by more than half so you don't get that carmelization), they definitely didn't like it as much. I'm definitely going back to the homemade version, and I'll make it in bulk this time and store it in an airtight jar for ease of use next time. Very good recipe!

i love this recipe, I usually eyeball it and use gluten free breadcrumbs. I think the celery salt is key, happy to have an option without all the additives. I have used for chicken and pork. It helps to bake on a rack so all sides get crispy

Really good! I had boneless pork chops to cook. I like them barbecued. My son loves Shake 'n Bake. I, myself, am not a big fan of it as it doesn't fan my tastebuds into a frenzy. It leaves me wanting more. I promised him I'd try to find a recipe I thought would work. This did!! I enjoyed the taste as much as he did. The chops were so moist and delicious and so tender we could cut them with a fork. 
I'd hoped to take a picture of my extra serving. Well, I didn't guard it and he ate it. I am not upset about it as this shows how much he enjoyed your coating!  We both did. I made one small addition as it was pork, I added a pinch of rubbed sage, a favorite of mine. I will be using this again and telling others. Thank you so much for sharing!

Used homemade breadcrumbs and followed the recipe to a "T".  Oh man was it tasty!  I used drums and thighs cooked at 375 for 45 min and then let the chicken rest for 10 min before eating.  It was crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside.

Very good recipe.  I cut my recipe in half and still had MORE than enough mixture to coat 4 large b/s chicken breasts.  Only suggestion is a little more salt.  Felt it needed more but will definitely use this recipe again!

This is a great coating for chicken. It is especially nice to know what is in it! The chicken was nice and moist inside and the coating has great flavor. The only change I made was that I added garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Will definitely use this recipe again.

We love this recipe! 
I do a few different things: 
I never have celery salt and garlic salt on hand so I don't use them. So I slightly increase the minced garlic, and halve the salt as I found one full Tablespoon to be too salty.
We only use smoked paprika, and it really enhances the flavour. 
 I also keep Epicure seasonings in the cupboard so I use the Three Onion Dip seasoning instead of minced onion. Works wonderfully for us.

delicious!! I added more garlic powder, because we love it, and also used less salts. I also sprayed the tops of the coated chicken with a little spray oil, to make it crispier :)

Soooooo much healthier than the store bought, and cheaper too! I keep some in the freezer at all times!

this is good. I wouldn't say great. 
it was good for a substitute for shake and bake Kraft. 

I followed the instructions for past shake and bakes.  I use milk or buttermilk as the "glue". the breading sticks to the meat better.

I followed the recipe as written except cut back on the salt from 1 tablespoon to 1/2 teaspoon.  After everything was mixed together I tasted it before I coated my chicken and still it was like eating a mouthful of salt.  It may be palatable if you cut out all the salt including the garlic salt & celery salt, but I threw the whole batch out rather than ruining my chicken.

Excellent recipe and I followed it all except that I did not add the vegetable oil instead I brushed olive oil on the chicken drumsticks before coating and I also added a teaspoon of newfie savory to the mix to give it a little added touch.

We wanted to cook American-style pork chops for our friends in China, so I used this recipe to make the coating. Our friends loved it so much they were eating the leftover crumbs from the pan! I had to make the breadcrumbs myself by baking several slices of bread and then grinding them in the food processor; I think this made the coating even better. I made half a recipe and it was enough to do two batches of pork chops.

This was just a bunch of mush, and the flavor wasn't exciting at all.  Will not be using this again.

Way too salty! Made again with maybe a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon of salt it would probably be good. I'll try it again sometime.

This recipe is wonderful except the salt! I read the reviews and took the advice of others, omitting and substituting where I could. The taste is spot on to the boxed mix and I love that I control the sodium. I halved the recipe and it made enough for 5 chops and enough leftover for another meal. I want to try adding some parm cheese for chicken or maybe some curry and cayenne for a change! It seems versatile and it costs relatively little in comparison to its boxed mentor! It's five star without the salt!  Thank you Sal

I didn't have a lot of the spices on hand so I had to improvise a little but it was still incredible! No more store bought for us!

Love this, allows me to avoid the shame of buying the boxed stuff! Good as written, but I cut the celery salt in half, it overpowers everything otherwise. I also ran out of garlic salt ages ago, so I just double the garlic powder (which I use in place of minced garlic) and keep the salt at the recommended amount. If you do use garlic salt, I'd recommend cutting back on the regular salt. I've started cutting the oil back too, you definitely don't need that much to get it crispy. 

The full recipe makes a huge batch of the stuff. I cook for two and at this point I think we've established that 1/4 of the recipe is all you need for 1.5-2 lb of chicken.

I scale this down to four servings. My husband and son loves this! The celery salt is what makes it. I added tons of fresh minced garlic. I use it for boneless pork chops. Bake at 400°F for 20 minutes.

Love it and is a big fav for my hubby. We use this on Pork ribs - we sometimes leave out the celery seed and sometimes substitute Jalapeno Olive oil we got from Con Olio's in Austin a while back. My husband does not like pork but LOVES this and prefers it over any store bought panko type breading mixes. I will be honest though, I have never gone by measurements, I just eyeball it.

very good. I made a full batch and separated out about a cup to coat 8 medium sized thin cut pork chops. I put the rest in a plastic baggie and stuck in the freezer for a later use. We loved this and my kids are huge fans of shake and bake so this is perfect for us. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Tried this tonight and it was great.  I cut out all the salt like everyone else.  I prepared the recipe with a 2 serving portion and it was more than enough for 6 thick pork loin cutlets and 6 chicken breasts.  I'd make this again.  Great post thanks!

I love this recipe! My 2 year old is a picky eater but she loved this on pork or even chicken. I didn't have a few things but it still turned out amazing! This has saved me a ton of money from having to buy the Shake and bake or other pre-make products like it, plus I know it is fresh and healthy.

Great recipe, just ditch the additional salt! It simply isn't necessary. I find the store bought stuff is much too salty as well, and this recipe is perfect without it. The celery salt and garlic salt add enough to make it tasty without being over seasoned.

I made a few adjustments to this pretty good basic recipe.  After adding salt and celery salt, I decided to substitute garlic salt for garlic powder.  I also added a dash of onion powder.  Since it called for basil and oregano I substituted crushed Italian seasoning.  :) thank you for the recipe!

It tastes just as good as anything I've tried for breading. I used it on pork chops, bone in, 3/4 inch thick. I baked in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 min each side (check temp - may need more or less time). At first I wasn't sure about putting the oil in the bag with the seasoning but it coated the meat perfectly!

This was good. I used melted butter in lieu of vegetable oil; trying to stay organic/non gmo and keep away from processed foods. I made about 12 drumsticks, and I cut the serving size from 8, all the way down to 2, and I still had quite a bit left over. Also left out the celery salt, just because I didn't have it, and used onion power instead of minced onion. Still good!

This is not shake n bake flavor so I didn't go 5 stars but it IS very good!  I used Glutino's bread crumbs to make it GF and basted the chicken in lite mayo and mustard first.  Great seasonings, family loved it.  Thanks!

This is so easy to make and it tastes just like the store bought version.  My kids are not big chicken eaters, but eat it when I use this recipe for chicken.  I use seasoned salt instead of regular and celery salt, and italian seasoning instead of the basil, parsely and oregano.

I used this on a whim on plain chicken breasts. It was easy to make and was delicious. I cut the recipe in half and still had LOTS left over. I could probably cut this into fourths to cook two chicken breasts cut in half.

"Incredible" was the consensus. I halved all of the ingredients and was able to fully coat 6, 5oz chops. I  omitted the 1tbs of salt, added red pepper, chili powder, and used panko crumbs. I cooked it in a skillet with a pat of butter in the oven @ 400 degrees for about 10 minutes. Wonderful recipe, so excited to have found this .

Very nice.  I was surprised to find that there was just a hint of a bite.  Pleasantly surprised.  I halved the recipe and it was plenty of mix to coat enough chicken tenders for 4 people.

Wonderful recipe!  I did modify somewhat as I try to keep as much salt out of our diet as I can.  I also am very frugal.  Waste not, want not!  LOL  I save up lefover portions of baguettes, hotdog and burger buns, thinini, partial loaves of bread too.  They get used in stuffing usually but this time, I made my four cups of breadcrumbs.  From now on when they build up in the freezer, I will regularly make them into breadcrumbs when I have about 4 cups worth.  I dried them out and made my own breadcrumbs.  Doing this will make each recipe differant as this time I had red pepper thinini in the mix LOL I used a pinch of salt, celery seed instead of celery salt, no garlic salt, 3 cloves of garlic  1/2 a small onion and left the rest the same.  I ran the garlic and onion in my magic bullet first.  FANTASTIC! I did use too much with my pork chops, and had to throw out about a cup, so be careful as this goes far.  I tossed the rest in a freezer bag in the freezer for next weeks chicken. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This recipe is Superb!  The whole family loved it!  My husband loves the bought "Shake 'n Bake" but from now on this homemade mixture is THE Shake 'n Bake for us!  One more note... at dinner table we kept discussing how delicious the pork chops were and how devine the homemade shake and bake mixture was.  My husband said, "Well, you know this is the shake and bake mixture we're using from now on."  Yup, this is it... and the neat thing also was that we had no leftovers.  Yay!
Thanks for having this recipe available.

A little too salty, but was still very good. I will cut back on the salt next time. It's a keeper!

This worked perfectly. I would, however, recommend leaving out the tablespoon of salt. The celery and garlic salts add plenty.

I made this with the ingredients I had on hand: onion, garlic powders, season salt and paprika and my family loved it.  So easy and good, I will never buy shake n bake again!!!

Wonderful recipe.  Instead of store bought bread crumbs I dried and made my own.  I used the recipe as written and my family absolutely loved it.  We are going to try it with pork and fish as well!

Have only used this for Chicken Breasts so far - excellent! am going to try it on Fish and Pork Chops. I love the fact that there are no unpronouncable chemicals in it! Thank you!
