Very good recipe. I modified it slightly to slowly cook the onions and celery (of which I used two stalks) in 1/4 cup of butter in a sautee pan for about 15 minutes. This softened the onions and helped them more readily dissolve into the stuffing. I also added all the herbs and seasonings to the onion mixture and let it sit for about an hour before continuing the prep. When it came time to put everyting together, I then mixed the onion/celery mixture into the breadcrumbs (I used corn bread) and spread it onto the baking dish.

A few other recommendations for improvement beyond this: Take out the chicken at the 1.5 hour mark, then spread out the stuffing onto a shallow baking dish and continue to cook for about 15 more minutes. I found the stuffing a touch too moist and this would dry it out just enough. Also, if you sautee the onions/celery first, you definitely DO NOT need the extra butter drizzled on top. Also, only 1/2 a can of chicken stock is necessary to achieve the right moisture level (I think next time I'd even cut the applesauce down by 1/3 to keep it from becoming too wet).

All that said, however, it is a great recipe!

I used a boneless whole chicken breast for ease... the skin was crispy and wonderful.

Like Steve said above, I would definitely saute the onions & celery first, and add less applesauce & broth.  The stuffing had a very delicious and unique flavour, but was too moist.  Both my husband & I loved it so I will definitely be making it again!

Awesome recipe! My boyfriend and I had a great time making this really simple dish. Tasted great! Really moist and delicious. Chicken fell right off the bone. I'd recommend this to anyone.

I didnt like how this turned out at all. The butter on top made it greasy, the stuffing was very mushy and the seasoning combination was just weird tasting.  I won't make it again.

I'll make this dish again because of its convenience/ease, but the satisfactory stuffing flavor only rates 3 stars.  I sauteed the onion and celery beforehand (with a few sliced carrots I had hanging out in the fridge), and assembled the rest of the dish as directed.  After one-and-a-half hours in the oven at 375, the chicken was bordering on overcooked.  Still, this dish fits nicely into a busy schedule (quick to assemble and frees up your time while it's in the oven), and healthy enough to earn a reappearance on my kitchen table.

I made this using boneless, skinless chicken breast (6) It took about an hour.  I thought it was too sage-y, but everyone else liked it.  The clean up on my pan... not fun.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I have made this twice for two different parties and both times had to give out the recipe.  I used apple cider instead of the can of chicken broth and only used half of the 14 oz. called for.  I didnt have any dried sage on hand so I used poultry seasoning in place of the rosemary, thyme and sage.  I also diced up an apple and added that to the stuffing.  It was delicious!  It's a great falltime meal!

I loved the flavor of this dish but I did have to cook for longer than recommended in the recipe.  I thought the flavor of the stuffing was really good.

I was not crazy about this.  The stuffing was very mushy and there was too much of it.  I did like the applesauce flavor but will not make this dish again

I didn't use chicken though! I've been using this to stuff my turkey's for a few years. It was perfect!! I added some ginger to it and used only a bit of chicken broth, that's all I changed.

very good, ive made this twice. once following the recipe and the second time with modifacations. both times it was very good. i however wasn't too fond of the texture of the breadcrumb stuffing, although the flavor was very good. so the second time i used regualr stuffing and added extra applesauce. we enjoyed this meal very much. i do love the idea though of using bread crumbs as stuffing, a great improvising idea!

Our family loved the flavor. Some did not like the stuffing, but they enjoyed the chicken.  I did substitute boneless skinless breasts, and Italian seasoning for all the herbs, and used a little corn meal because I didn't have quite enough bread crumbs.

This sounded great and I'll probably try again with some modifications, but the stuffing was absolutely slushy.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts too, which was probably a mistake; while moist, the chicken was virtually tasteless. 
Next time I will be sure to use skin-on chicken pieces, and will make sure to brown it well first and add all stuffing on top, using less chicken broth in the stuffing so it's a little firmer - might try adding an egg.  I used maple cinnamon bread in the stuffing, which gave nice flavor and went well with the applesauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I used chicken breasts, and they turned out super moist and tender. Next time, I want to try putting in fresh apples, dried cranberries, and some cinnamon!
