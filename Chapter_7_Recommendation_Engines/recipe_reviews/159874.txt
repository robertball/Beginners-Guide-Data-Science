I used 1/4 cup of sugar, which was plenty.  
Put a splash guard over the pan while frying the spices, the mustard seeds tend to jump all over the place. The recipe does not specify what type of mustard seeds to use - I used brown mustard seeds. I left the chutney to simmer for an hour, and it came out very tasty.

Interesting recipe with unique taste. Followed it but have a couple of suggestions. Makes alot of chutney. Might suggest using 1/2 or 3/4 cup of water as 1 full cup made it far too watery at the end. Used pork loin about 1 in. thick and found that 4 min. per side was not enough - go for 5 min per. With these changes, would do this one again - it's different and it's good!
