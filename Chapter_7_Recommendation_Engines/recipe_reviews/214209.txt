This is a great recipe! my family makes this dish in the fall every year. My mom-mom cooks bacon with the apples though and she adds a touch of brown sugar. Everyone loves it!!!

Scaled this down to 2 servings and used Gala and Granny Smith apples.  Most cooked apple dishes are sweet, so this is a really nice change for a savory side dish which was served warm with a pork entree.  Next time I make this, I will add some crumbled crisp bacon as suggested by the recipe author, as that should only enhance its savoriness.  Thanks Jin for sharing your recipe, this is a good one!

Loved this! My husband is allergic to red onions so I used a Vidalia onion instead. So yummy!

I made this to go with pork tenderloin today and we loved the combination as a nice change of pace from my sickeningly sweet style fried apples.  I'll make this again.

This was bitter and smelled bad when I made it as directed. Maybe I shouldn't have use granny smith apples.

Although I do love sweet things, this is a very nice change of pace for something "apple".  I fried a little bacon, and used part of the grease this produced to sautee the apple and onions, instead of adding butter.  When cooked, I seasoned with salt, pepper, and just a light sprinkle of seasoning salt  I served this over a little cooked barley for supper, saving a little for the next day to eat as a salad with just a tad of my favorite bleu cheede dressing.  Both were unique and tasty.  I'm very happy to have found this recipe.  Thank you!

We loved this!  Cooked in a bit of bacon grease, and added 2 slices crumbled bacon near the end, plus about 1/2 tsp brown sugar, which really took them over the top!  I peeled the apples for one of my picky eaters and cut the onions into larger pieces for the other - the longer onion strings caramelized nicely with the extra cooking time, and the whole thing tasted great!  Served with potato pancakes and sausage with red cabbage.  Yum!

I love this dish. It was quick and easy and a great way to add more fruit to my diet. I used granny smith apples.

Love this as a savory way to use apples.  Served as a side for sauerbraten and everyone raved.

My family loved this.  Made a big bowl for a family event and it was gone faster than anything else.  I used the apples I had on hand, and walla walla sweet onions.  I did add bacon, but I used the candied bacon I made the day before. A month later I am still getting emails asking for this recipe.
