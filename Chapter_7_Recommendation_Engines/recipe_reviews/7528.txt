My husband and kids went BONKERS for this recipe!  My mother made something similar with pinapple and cherries when I was a child, haven't had it since then.  I had fresh blueberries that needed to be used up and I felt nastolgic after reading this recipe... this was delicious!!!   I took Snocu's advice from the reviews and did not melt the butter, but sliced it thin and made a layer over top.  I added fresh lemon juice from half a lemon and a bit of nutmeg to the berries.  I also used Betty Crocker's Moist French Vanilla cake mix.   My husband and children DEMANDED that I make it again!  Thanks!

I gave this four stars because I do not agree with the melted butter idea.  If you cut the butter in slices and evenly place them over the topping, then it will not dry out as other reviewers have complained.  Delicious recipe, can be halved easily for those of us with smaller numbers to feed.

This is AWESOME.  As for the reviewer who said it didn't turn out b/c she used a bundt pan...it's not a "normal" cake, it's a dump cake...it doesn't form into a "bundt" shape.  It's supposed to be dry in some areas b/c you scoop it out and serve it with ice cream, YUM!!

Very. very tastey.  Here are the changes that I made with the recipe...I didn't have a yellow cake mix so I used a lemon cake mix.  Many blueberry recipes include lemon juice, so I figured this would be alright.  It tasted fabulous!  I can't imagine it without the lemon cake mix.  Also, several of the reviews on this recipe complained about the topping so instead of melting the butter, I used my food processor and cut cold butter into the mix.  That way it would be evenly distributed.  Instead of a 9x13 pan, I used 2 glass pie plates and divided the ingredients equally.

I don't like to leave bad reviews on recipes, but in this case I feel I must. I followed this recipe to the letter..the only change I made wasn't in ingredients but I used a bundt pan instead of a 9" by 11" pan.  I baked it longer than stated and it still was like batter in some areas and dry cake mix in others. I just wouldn't and can't recomend this to anyone, sorry

Very good and simple to make!  I used frozen blueberries, a cup of melted butter (instead of 1/2 cup) and baked it for about 50 minutes.  It turned out very good!

What a waste of my good blueberries! I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with dry cake mix on top with clumps where the butter had pooled. I mixed it all up and put it back in the oven to see if I could salvage it, and ended up with a big pile of overly sweet blueberry mush. Oh well, maybe it's all in what brand of cake mix you use, but I'll never try this again.

This is one of those things that makes you go "MMMMM..." We had been berry picking this past weekend and I used fresh blackberries. It is really good. Did I mention how good it is? 
I used a Duncan Hines Golden Butter cake mix, added cinnamon and sugar and 1 cup of oats. (Sprinkled on the top of the berries, before the cake mix) I also increased the butter to 1 cup.  Would be good with other fruits too. A definite winner.

This dish was delish! Warm with vanilla ice cream.  It was a grand slam with my husband!  I used a Pillsbury french vanilla cake mix instead of the yellow cake mix, because that's what I had in the house.  Now that is my topping of choice.  I also used an extra 1/2 stick of butter to cover the dry spots. Next time I make it, I think I'll throw in some raspberries in addition to the blueberries!

This is the easiest dessert in the world. Always gets great reviews. I do the cake part differently. In a seperate bowl cut one stick of butter into the cake mix with pastry cutter until crubmly. Then sprinkle this mix over the fruit. Never a clumping or dry problem. Can also sub for fruit: one large can of pie filling (blueberry or cherry are our favs) mixed with one large undrained can crushed pineapple. DO NOT make in bundt pan as one person tried!!!

I've been on a blueberry kick.  I was going to make muffins or cake but when I searched this recipe came up first.  Glad it did.  WOW is this good.  I omitted the cinamin though and used a larger cake mix and more blueberries so I added a little more butter.  I also baked it a little longer.  BUT THIS IS GOOOOOOODDDDD!  A keeper!

I adore this recipe! I have made it a hundred times and changed up the liquid on top and the fruit.  To cut back on calories I use 1/2 cup of buttermilk instead of butter- I just tip the pan a few times to cover all the cake mix. I also add a sprinkle of sugar and cinnamon to the top before baking. If any spots aren't wet after tipping- just drop a pat of butter or a little more buttermilk or skim milk.   This recipe equally as yummy with different berries or apples. I have had perfect results with buttermilk, half or half or skim milk in place of the butter

DO NOT melt butter, but slice it over the top,  bake until light brown

Cake mix has plenty of sugar already, so I left out the 1/2 cup sugar called for, & it still tasted great.

I needed a quick dessert for unexpected guests and this one came in handy.  After reading most of the review, I used 2 cups fresh blueberries (all I had on hand), about 1 cup dried cranberries, and 1 can of pineapple slices with the juice.  I mixed the berries and chopped up pineapple together and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar mixture on it that I keep on hand and then added about half a can of the pineapple juice and tossed it together.  I then spread that mixture in the 9 x 13, put the cake mix on top, used about one stick of butter cut in thin slices, and then poured the rest of the pineapple juice on top of the cake mix and butter.  Once it was in the oven and the butter had melted, I checked to see if there were any dry spots then added additional butter on those areas.  I baked it for about 40 minutes but kept checking about every 5 minutes.  When it was nice and golden brown, I took it out and it was perfect.  The guests loved it and there weren't any dry spots.  The juice helped a lot and allowed it to get a nice golden color.  I will make it again with the same variations.

I loved this with vanilla ice cream!!! I did as another rater suggested and I thinly sliced the butter rather than pouring melted butter. I used a potato peeler with cold butter.

Like someone else recommended, if you think 'cobbler', you will be more prepared for this. It was pretty good, although quite sweet and not cake like. For the cake mix to 'cook' you need to make sure the butter covers everything.

Very nice.  I actually mixed the cake mix and 1 cup of melted butter with a spoon and spread it over the berry mixture (despite the directions).  I baked for about 50 minutes and it was sort of like a cookie crumble on top of the berries.  Absolutely delicious - huge hit.

Definitely use a pastry blender to combine the cold butter with the dry cake mix. 

Sprinkle the cake-butter mixture over the berries and bake in 13x9 pan till bubbly and golden. 

Serve with ice cream and enjoy!

Made some changes to this recipe and got great results/reviews! Instead of a yellow cake mix, I used a white mix that I had on hand. I also used a can of blueberry pie filling, omitting the sugar, added an egg and TBS of lemon juice to the melted stick of butter and baked it in a 10" springform pan.

Grease pan, pour can of pie filling and spread on bottom. Melt a stick of butter, add 1 TBS lemon juice and beat one egg in butter mixture. In a separate mixing bowl, combine cake mix and butter mixture, stir till ingredients are combined. Don't over mix. It will look similar to sugar cookie dough. Pour this on top of blueberry filling, mixing just to incorporate the cake mix and spread over bottom of pan. Sprinkle cinnamon and a little sugar on top. Bake 45 to 55 minutes at 350.

I solved the butter issue by shredding it over the top.  There were hardly any dry spots.  That being said, this was super, super sweet.  Just over the top in my opinion.

I didn't care for this dessert. I left the pats of butter on top and I had a lot of dry spots. I loved the blueberries with the cinnanon. I think next time I will make up the cake mix and then pour the yellow cake mix over the blueberries.

I used a ratio of 1/3 blueberries and 2/3 sliced strawberries. I made it as directed but then wasn't happy with the way it was looking (dry and colorless) after about 25 minutes. I poured a little pineapple juice (about 1/2 cup) over the fruit to make it juicier, sprinkled some oats and brown sugar over the top, added more melted butter as others suggested, and it turned out really yummy and browned nicely on the top.

Easiest way to make a cobbler type dessert I've ever made.  Mixed the fruit, sugar & cinnamon in a bowl & poured into a buttered casserole dish. Used 2 1/2 c fresh blueberries & 2 c diced fresh peaches. Down cinnamon to 3/4 tsp. Up the butter to 3/4 c & cut into bits scattered on top the cake mix to avoid the dry cake mix issue. Baked 45 min & broiled last 2 to brown the top just right. Serve warm w/ice cream....OMG!!! Reminds me of down home cobbler!

YUM!  Took this to a work function and folks loved it!  I only had 2 c fresh blueberries.  After reading a few reviews about dryness I pulled a 2 birds/1 stone by adding a 20oz can of blueberry pie filling + fresh bb's (didn't add the cup of sugar).  It turned out great!  Also used Lemon Butter Cake mix to cut the sweet a bit.  There is no doubt that it's just as great w/white.

I melted the butter, mixed it in with the cake mix first and then dropped the cake mix in dollops over the blueberry/sugar mixture.  Tastes great, but bakes very flat.  To serve, I piled two pieces and topped with whipped cream.

Wow, this was really simple and great. I personally will use less sugar (1/4cup).   For anyone who had a tough time making this, this is what I did.   I used frozen blueberries and spread them (evenly) across the bottom of the pan. Wait til they thaw (leave juice). Evenly poor the sugar over the blueberries and then cinnamon.   Then evenly spread the cake mix over it. Break the balls of cake mix up with your fingers, and then evenly spread the butter over the mix! That easy!  I did however have to cook it 15 extra minutes (might be my stove). Make sure its a nice golden brown.

Fabulous, quick and easy dessert!! This was a big hit in my family - even with my son who is not a big  blueberry fan.  However I do agree with a lot of the other reviews.  I followed their suggestions and cut back on the sugar (which was difficult for a "Sweet Tooth" like myself") and added more butter.  I also added about 1/2 cup rolled oats.  Served it warm with some vanilla ice cream!! Didn't last the day with 2 boys. Going to try next time with apples and walnuts.

I cut the recipe in half because I only had a jiffy cake mix on hand. My family loved it! My husband thinks its the best dessert I have ever made. A definite keeper and one to show off to others!

Just got done eating this and YUM!  I tried the suggestion of using a peeler to lay thin pads of butter over the cake mix and that, I think, was easier than trying to sprinkle melted butter over it all.  There were a few dry cakey areas after baking so I threw a couple more pads of butter on and stuck it back in the oven for 5 minutes.  Perfect!  It truly was simple and delicious.  Boyfriend liked it too!

The cake was powder on the top, and mush in the blueberries.  It was also way to sweet.  I won't be making this recipe again.

If you've never had a dump cake before, you just may not understand how this is supposed to be....it is not a 'cake' persay.... think more like a cobbler and maybe you'll be happier.  In my opinion the butter must be melted and drizzled over the dry cake mix---it's part of the charm.  I don't even like ice cream on it, just the plain dump cake is YUMMY!  Thanks for this recipe using fresh fruit--lots less sugar than my standard using pie filling!  Try mixing a little almond into it if you want a bit of crunch

I wish I hadn't wasted the last of our freshly picked blueberries on this dish.  It was entirely too sweet.  I just couldn't eat it.  Also, if any of the dry cake mix isn't covered in butter it isn't going to cook. Period.  After the advised 30 minutes I had to brush melted butter all over the top of this cake just to get the dry cake mix to finish cooking.

This was a bit too sweet for me - tho eating with  whip cream helped tone it down.  Next time I'll use only 1/4 cup sugar to the berry mix.  I used frozen blueberries and baked it for about 45 minutes.  Very tasty, overall!

It tastes good, but I ended up with large clumps of dry cake mix on top.  I would use more butter next time and wished I had read the reviews first.  The taste was still great, but it was hard to get past the dry clumps and the liquid that pooled at the bottom of the pan.  Would try it again, but would use 1 cup of butter or mix the butter with the cake mix before putting it over the blueberries.

If you use lemon cake mix and chopped almonds on top of that, it's wonderful. Lemon and blueberry is always a great combo. It just sends this dump cake over the top!!!

I rarely complain about recipes, but I have to say this one was most disappointing.  I made it to bring to my church "covered dish" but had to make another dessert instead.  The cake was pale and "undone" looking after cooking it 20 minutes longer than the directions advise.  So I tried broiling it for only a few seconds.  This gave it a "browned top", but the cake itself was mushy/crunchy and much too sweet (we tried to eat some of it at home).  I'm afraid there's no salvaging this recipe.  I won't ever try it again, sorry to say.

I'm really sorry I used 4 cups of expensive blueberries for this recipe.  It's more like a bar cookie--about 1" high.  Some of the cake mix that didn't get covered by the melted butter was just dry and crumbly on the top.

This is DELICIOUS and REALLY EASY.  Tastes fantastic with whipped cream!  I had a bunch of blueberries I needed to use before they went bad and I decided to try this recipe since it was new for me.  I did use a little bit more butter and a tiny bit less sugar.  I also only had 2 1/2 cups of blueberries and it still turned out fine! Superb, will make again and again!

My husband raved head over heels about this one.  Definitely a keeper for my household.  I did shred the butter as suggested by another reviewer and I did broil the topping for the last couple minutes to obtain a lovely golden brown finish.  Worked perfectly.

Very easy to make.  Works best with a cake mix that doesn't have pudding in it.  I used frozen blueberries and had to bake about 15 minutes longer.

Great basic recipe for a dump cake! I used 2 cups of organic peeled, boiled pears (cut in approx. 1" cubes) & 2 cups of chopped fresh strawberries combined with blueberries & raspberries; so 4 cups total fruit, as per the recipe.  I increased the sugar to about 3/4 cup to get a more syrupy consistency, kept the cinnamon the same (1 tsp). After baking 30 minutes, it didn't seem done enough & had dry spots here & there, so I melted an additional 1/4 cup of butter & baked it for 10 more minutes. It came out so beautifully and was delicious! My 26 yr old daughter has requested this instead of cake in the future. I had to write this after reading a negative review from a woman who claimed to have followed the recipe "to the letter" & gotten a bad result. If you're a cook, a recipe is a guideline, not a Commandment.  Any good cook knows to use their judgement & experience to make a recipe their own.  This is the first Dump Cake I've ever made, but it won't be the last & this basic recipe will be used many more times. *I used Betty Crocker Super Moist yellow cake mix, "with pudding in the mix"

One of the best desserts I have ever made next to pumpkin pie.  For fewer calories and less sugar, use a sugar-free yellow cake mix and substitute the sugar for 1/4 cup of Splenda/sugar blend.

I cannot even imagine howsome reviewers didn't LOVE this!  It's awesome.  It's really not a cake though - it's almost like a strussel-topped crumble, not a cake....but that's just the name.

I love this recipe and  I followed the directions exactly. This recipe is also great because you can interchange fruit. I have used a can of cherry pie filling in place of the bluberries and that was delicious as well...I have made this several times and each time I have NO leftovers!

I made this for a party without trying first. Would never make again, waste of great blueberries. I really love dump cake, but this was just a goopy mess. Nobody would even take any home. Sorry, hate to give bad reviews, it really sounded good.

Have made this two weekends in a row and did not make any changes.  Super simple and very satisfying on a cold day.

We loved it!  I too used 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup, but next time I will cut back to 3/4 cup of butter to save a few fat grams, LOL!  I sprinkled the top with walnuts before cooking, now I know this is more fat added, but it was very good - especially served with vanilla ice cream, I know - more fat!  I will definitely watch my portion size and only make if we are having company over so there will be no leftovers to nibble on!  Thanks for this terrific recipe!

Super quick and easy and very good.  Next time I may try this recipe using a lemon cake mix.  I took another reviewer's advice and instead of using melted butter I shaved thin slices and placed it on the top of the cake mix.  We will definitely have this again!

My husband (and I) loved this recipe. I used the food processor to mix the cake mix and cold butter. It is one of our favorite from now on. Easy to make and low cost. I'll try with other berries.

All of the cake mix did not 'cook' so it was powdery on top. I made it in a 9x13 and maybe I did not add enough something for juices---anyway I ate it. I would lighten up the sugar-it was too sweet for me.

Was quick and easy to make.  However,I was not happy with the end result. The yellow cake mix flavor was strong and it made the dish way too sweet. I would cut the cake mix AND sugar in half if I would make it again.

This cake was very easy to make and delicious.  I did make a few changes by decreasing the sugar to 2T and adding 1T fresh lemon juice. As another review suggested,  I did use a pastry cutter with the cake mix/butter and that worked great.

It would be hard to find an easier home-made desert... I followed other reviewers' advice and thinly sliced the butter over the top of the dry cake mix- it came out with no dry spots.  I also used only about 1/4 cup of sugar- you may be able to skip the sugar altogether, the desert is definitely very sweet.  Used frozen blueberries, mixed in some canned peaches.  Everyone loved this recipe!

This was tasty but I will probably not make it again.  It was too sweet & it was not cakey at all (no eggs), the cake mix was dry in some places where the butter didn't go - It was VERY easy to make

LOVED it....I was cooking for a tough crowd too and we all LOVED it.  I increased the melted butter to closer to 1 cup...but i actually made it 2 days in a row cause everyone loved it...and these are real food savy people...I just didn't tell them how easy it was.  I was on vacation and this was very easy to make and a sure pleaser will absolutely make again..thanks so much

I had a dump cake for the first time about a month and a half ago.  It was amazing.  I found this recipe and was excited to make this for myself.  It was really good, cured my sweet tooth.  Since I'm the only one in the house who likes blueberries I halfed the recipe, but used the original amt of butter (I sliced it and placed on top instead of melting it as other reviewers had suggested). I ate it warm with cool whip.  The only thing I will do differenly next time will be to add a little bit more cake mix because it was a lot like a bar and I was hoping for something more cakey.

I was a bit worried when 30 minutes passed and this didn't look anywhere near what I expected, so I left it in until about 50 minutes (checking every 5 or so) and it turned out great!  It tasted awesome warm and would highly recommend warming before eating!

Good and easy!  Since a few reviews mentioned dry spots, I lightly sprayed the top with butter flavored cooking spray instead of adding more butter and it worked great.  Cooking time was 40-45 mins for my oven.  Overall a great quick dessert.

This is one of my favorite dessert recipes!  It's easy yet delish.  I vary it sometimes using lemon cake mix instead of yellow.  Lemon and bueberries together are the bomb!  I also like to use mixed berries - blueberries, raspberries and blackberries.

I believe this recipe definitely has possibilities, but as a number of other reviewers have suggested, it absolutely needs another approach with the butter on top of the cake mix.  I used 12 oz. fresh blueberries and two large fresh peach--hence peach and berry dump cake.  When I make it again I will add some lemon juice and reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup as 1/2 cup made it entirely too sweet.  Even though I spotted the cold butter on top of the cake mix, it still had spots where it was just dry cake mix.  Perhaps the buttermilk is a possibility or even cutting in the butter with a pastry blender.  Will let you know when I make it again.  Served it with whipped topping.

It was way too sweet with the sugar coating the blueberries. The butter did not cover the cake mix so there was uncooked mix on the top. I had to add 20 minutes to the overall cooking time to get a brown topping.

Not overly impressed.  I cut the butter into the cake mix instead of melting it.  When it was done, you could tell that it was still dry.  Melted another 1/2 cup butter and poured over top and baked for 10 more minutes.  It was mush and was way too sugary.

The recipe does need to be altered.  It isn't wonderful without making some changes.   there isn't enough butter in it to cover the top.  I followed it exactly and when it was done I had dry cake mix on top in so many areas.  I added lots of drops of cold butter on top and put back in the oven for atleast 20 min.

Very good!  Love a quick and easy recipe. I added more blueberries (about a cup or so extra) since I had them to use up.  Increased the sugar just a bit to compensate for the extra berries, melted some butter  (used a little more than called for, as well) and chopped some cold (worked to give both textures in the topping) and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar over the cake mix.  I did need to bake longer, but that was probably because of the increase of berries, sugar and butter.  Thanks for sharing!

Could this get any easier?  Very delicious, especially warm out of the oven.  As one reviewer suggested, I mixed the yellow cake mix and butter in my food processor and it turned out great.  I also used about five cups of berries because that's what I had so I just threw them in and it was perfect.  The topping wasn't browned at 30 minutes of bake time so I added another 10.

extremely easy to make, I crumbled the butter into the mix and it made the topping moist, and added a bit more butter on top like others suggested. The topping is a little sweet though, maybe next time can add a bit more flour into the mix, but wonderful and easy

This was fantatic hot, cold and warmed in the microwave.  I used fresh blueberries that were frozen then thawed.  I thinly sliced the stick of butter on top.  Everyone loved it, especially with ice cream.

Delicious - I too did the thin pats of butter (cut from the stick long-wise), I baked longer than 30 min (45min so it was browned). It made a nice crunch on the top. I would call this a "cobbler" vs. a cake. SUPER sweet!!!

This was fabulous! I used the amounts of the ingredients as listed, but I did not melt the butter. I put about half the dry cake mix over the blueberries, then processed the other half with the butter in my food processor until it was crumbly and then spread that over the top. Topped it all off with some homemade vanilla ice cream and it made a real treat. I really can't get over how good this was to have been so easy. The family has already asked for it again!

For a really simple dessert, this was really good.  I used fresh blueberries that I had frozen, thawed. I added a can of crushed pineapple, drained, as others had suggested.  I melted the butter but I did a little more than one stick.  Mine had to bake longer than 30 minutes....maybe closer to 40 or 45 minutes.

Incredibly easy... my 9 an 4 year old make it.  Do NOT melt the butter, just put pats on top.  Have used lemon cake and yellow cake.  My family loved both, but with a slight preference toward the lemon cake.

Great recipe!  I added crushed canned pineapple to my bluberries and omitted the cinnamon. Since we have diabetics in the family, I used Splenda in place of sugar and a low sugar cake mix and served with S/F vanilla ice cream.  It was a hit and I'm definitely making this one again!

This was a good recipe!  I didn't melt the butter first and I had to increase the amount because it was still dry in spots.  I put  a few more pats of butter on top and stuck the cake back in the oven for a few more minutes.  It was very popular at our church potluck.

I tried to replicate the best blueberry dump cake I've ever had, which I had a work function, and this came pretty close.  I used frozen blueberries which I thawed in a strainer in the sink first, because the store was out of fresh ones for some odd reason.  I also used a can of crushed pineapple on the bottom with the blueberries since the blueberry dump cake I have had always had crushed pineapple.   I used butter recipe cake mix. I also used about 1/4 cup of extra butter to make sure it wasn't too dry.  I melted some of the butter and poured it on top, and put the rest of the butter on top in chunks without melting to fill in the spots that were dry.  It turned out just great and not too dry at all.  The family ate the entire pan within an hour of it coming out of the oven!  Will definitely make again.

I've made it twice and it's been awesome.  The first time I made it as stated and thought it was an awful lot of sugar and butter.  The second time I made it I just sprinkled sugar and cinnamon over the fruit until I thought it looked good.  I probably used 1/2 to 2/3 of the sugar.  Also, I used frozen berries both times, the second time using a mixture of berries...turned out great, just had to cook for an hour.  ...and I even used a lemon cake mix the second time too, it was so yummy!

I would give this 5 stars, but I had to do some improvising. I only had 2 cups of blueberries that I added to one (21 oz) can of blueberry pie filling (omitted the need for any sugar). I only had a white cake mix. I melted 3/4 cup of butter. The aroma of this baking in the oven was fantastic. Very easy and delicious!! Next time I may stir a cup of flaked coconut and some chopped nuts into the cake mix.

Every time I take this recipe anywhere people ask for more! To all who are having a hard time with the CRUMBLE TOP. I just melt the butter in a separate bowl, mix the cake mix until crumbly and then sprinkle on top of the blueberries. I also sprinkle a little sugar on the berries and have also used raspberrys in place of the blueberries. Give it a chance you will love it! I don't think it deserve any bad reviews.

I was in a hurry to throw something together to take to a dinner party, and this was perfect!  Fast, simple, and so SO delicious! I did, however, use 1 cup of melted butter instead of just a 1/2 cup.

I was really nervous about this recipe. I had read good and bad reviews, so I thought I'd give it a try. It turned out great! I used a pie pan instead of a 9x13 and I used both melted butter and grated. It tasted great with ice cream!

This is a fantastic alternative to blueberry pie and just takes a couple of minutes to prepare. Couldn't be easier. Sweet, juicy and great with ice cream or a hot cup of coffee. I'll be making again.

Talk about smelling divine when it came out of the oven! It was so easy to make and quick. The only complaint was that it was bit too sweet, but that was only from one person- the harshest critic. Everyone else loved it and I will be making this again.

I feel bad that this is the second bad rating I am giving to recipes on this site today, but I really did not care for this. I have a recipe for a wonderful dump cake that I make all the time with canned fruit, but on that one the fruit goes on top and then there is a topping of nuts and coconut. It is delicious and I thought this would be similar and just as good. Well, I was wrong.

This is such a quick and amazing recipe! I 100% recommend it. I followed the instructions with the exception of using a little more butter than what was called for. The butter I used was frozen, easy to cut, and I used a stick and a half. I was worried that it would either have dry spots from not enough butter or be soggy from too much butter but it turned out perfectly. I love this cake!!!!!!!!

AWESOME!  This was sooo easy and delicious!  I only cooked it for 30 minutes and even though there were spots where the butter never touched the cake mix, it still tasted good and didn't taste dried out.  The only thing I'll do different next time is add less sugar, maybe a 1/3 cup.  It was a bit to sweet.

This is a very good recipe, I recommend using a frozen stick of butter and grating the butter over the top of the cake dry mix. YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!!

This is my favorite dessert in the world!  But I like mine better!  I have always used a lemon cake mix and use 1 1/2 sticks of butter patties and put on top.  The blueberries should be cooked first on low heat with the sugar and cinniman.  I always add pecan halves on top and then cook.   Yummy

Way too sweet! The cake topping tasted raw and gritty. My three year old wouldn't even eat it. We ended up throwing the leftovers away.

After my kids and I picked 12 pounds of Oregon blueberries this week, I was all set to try this recipe.  I took the best tips from several reviews - I melted one stick of butter but first I sliced another half a stick very thinly and layered that on top ofthe cake mix.  The result was superb - I think it is very important to have an even layer of the cake mix before adding the butter.  We had a soft "crust" on top with no dry spots - it's called a dump cake because you literally take a big scoop and "dump" it into a bowl; it's not supposed to be cut into pretty slices   - we enjoyed ours warm with vanilla ice cream.  My husband is a "from scratch" snob and he loved this.  Four stars because I did modify it a bit, but overall a great recipe.

Ok I am giving this recipe 4 stars.... I was looking for a blueberry cobbler recipe that was quick and easy I didn;t have much time and wanted it for dessert last night... so I tried this one... I had a yellow butter cake box cake which I used.  I did make a change or two I did not use the sugar called for in the recipe because I felt that the cake mix would be sweet enough so I just sprinkeled somme cinnamon sugar on the berries with a little lemon juice... i did melt the butter but added just a tad more to the recipe and sprayed a little butter flavored pam on the top to avoid dry spots from cake mix... and the recipe calls for 4 cups of blueberries well I only used about 3 cups which I felt was too much.... if i make this again... I will cut it back to 2 cups and I think then it will be perfect. It did come out good but seemed like it had too much blueberries and not enough of the cake on the blueberries.... all in all it was good and hit the spot not too sweet just perfect with some vanilla custard that my son brought us.....  with the above changes when I make it again i think it will earn 5 stars.... and I also baked it for about 35-40 mins a little longer then was stated in recipe...

I made this dessert last night.  It was wonderful, I followed the directions as they were written, using frozen blueberries.  When I poured the melted butter over the top, I took a spoon and evened it out some over the cake mix.  I cooked it until the top was a light brown, it took about 40 minutes.  It got rave reviews from my husband.  I will make this frequently.

Thsi recipe is wonderful (easy). I grated  frozen butter over the top of the cake mix for an even topping. My brother gives us blueberries each year from the family farm. I'm hard press to use them all- this recipe will help because it turns out just right. I agree as mentioned by others not to add the sugar to the blueberries. However, I did added sugar because I wasn't sure if the sugar breaks the blueberries down to make the cake mix cook correctly. We found it very sweet. But still very good. Next time less sugar for us.

This recipe was delicious.  As suggested, I too placed butter on top of mixture.  The only change I made was dividing the recipe in half - a much better size for two!

Big hit. I put the pats of butter on top instead of in the blueberrires, Had to bake about 40 minutes to get nice and brown. Very good, will make it again, need to use up the blueberries in my freezer.

I don't know why its called a cake because it doesn't rise. When you put the butter on weather it be in chunks or melted it just turns into a mock streusel topping on top of blueberries. What a waste of perfectly good blueberries. I think if you could get the cake to rise by adding eggs or water to the cake mix before pouring it on the blueberries it would be muuuuccch better. I'll try that next time and report back.

I loved this recipe.  I took some advice from others and changed just a few things.  I added a can of pineapple to blueberries and I used a pineapple cake mix.  I also used 2 stickes of butter, I didn't melt it just cut it into pieces and layed it on top of cake mix.  Came out perfect and everyone loved it.

So yummy. The blend of sweet berries with buttery cake is fantastic. Very easy with kids since the most diffcult skill really needed is gentleness when coating the berries with the sugar and cinnamon.
Doesn't look very pretty but has a memorable taste!

Extreemly easy.  Great way to use up blueberries.  I had to make a few modifications though.  I used a little more sugar and had to bake it for at least 45 minutes - it wasn't near done at 30 min.

I was left with a lot of dry powdered cake mix on the top of this.  When the cake was almost done, I poured a little milk on the dry spots, and it turned out pretty good.

If you follow this recipe closely and use a 9 x 13 pan, I repeat a NINE BY THIRTEEN PAN, then in all likelihood you won't run into problems. If you use a bundt pan, you're going to have far less surface area for the cake mix to fully absorb the butter and you'll end up exactly with the situation you described. Some people should just stay out of the kitchen, or at the very least they should refrain from leaving one star reviews when they don't follow the recipe. This site needs downvoting functionality for situations like this. It isn't fair to the posters who can actually cook.

I had absolutely horrid results.  The butter certainly did not cover all the dry cake mix.  The portion of the batter that was moistened came out very gummy.

This dump cake is absolutely wonderful - wish I could give it more stars! I have a bunch of frozen berries that I need to start using before this summer's harvest.
Read all the reviews and I did blend my butter and cake mix together before putting it on the berries. I used about 5 cups of berries and added a bit of cornstarch to the sugar them since the berries were frozen. Baked about 40 minutes. Great flavor and texture. Will be making this again and again.

Tasted great but came out very thin in the pan...I might try a slightly smaller pan next time.  Also I added about 2Tbl to the butter called for, one stick didn't cover as much as I wanted.  Super-easy with blueberries and cake mix on hand.

I used fresh picked blackberries  and served for my elderly mother's birthday party with only seven guests.  There was only one small piece left and everyone  ate  French vanilla ice cream with it (no one is a huge eater either!).  Obviously  everyone enjoyed and complimented  me.  Definitely a keeper recipe and so easy to make!

This was a great dump cake!  I used frozen, thawed blueberries, added juice from 1/2 a lemon and a few grates of fresh nutmeg to the blueberry mixture.  Everything else was the same.  Should have fed 8 but I had a group of hunters at our cabin and with seconds, I had nothing left!  Fed 5 very hungry hunters!  With ice cream, of course!

I followed everyone's suggestions and added 1/4 cup sugar but in spite of that, the final product was honestly 'sickeningly sweet'. My daughters generally love any baked item but it was not good even for them. The taste of the yellow cake mix was the problem. I used a Duncan Hines product but I have no idea how it ended up so sickly. I hate to give it 1 star. In my daughter's words - no point eating empty calories if we don't like it.

YUMMERS! I sliced the butter length wise and laid across the top-fantastic!!!! I used dark canned cherries-drained and a 9x9 pan. The top is soooo good and the smaller pan made a nice thick topping,that wasn't dry at all. (lightly sprinkled a little sugar a cross cherries,didn't measure)

You can't make a bundt cake out of this! I have used this for many desserts, and it NOT a cake.  It is more a fruit crisp.  It does work very well in a dutch oven over charcoal.  We have used it with cherry pie filling, apple pie filling, pears(with spice cake), all sorts of berries, mixed or not.  Blueberries are always a favorite.  I have also seen it made with a bottle of Sprite or 7-up over the cake.  I do like the 1 cup butter, however, but then I like butter!

It was too sweet for my taste.  There is already sugar in the cake mix so  a half cup sugar was too much.  I will make it again with less sugar.

I've made this recipe with cherry pie filling and crushed pineapples instead of blueberries and it's been amazing!  I am excited to try with fresh/frozen blueberries rather than canned pie filling.  I do agree with the other reviewers that it is best to cut the butter into thin slices and place on top of the cake mix to keep it from drying out.  It's a huge favorite whenever I make it for an event or family get together.  Instead of using 1 cup or 2 sticks of butter, I only used 1 and a half sticks, distributing the butter evenly on top of the cake and it still turned out well and makes it slightly less fattening, however this cake really doesn't have many redeeming qualities as far as health goes!  But it is very delicious and so easy to make!

30 years of baking this and taking it to events and always take several recipe cards along as I am always being asked for the recipe. Now my 3 adult children make this for their events as well.  I now add 1 tsp. of cinnamon for a nice twist and the lemon cake mix is awesome as well.

I have made this recipe 4 times in the last month because my family RAVES about it, but I do alter the recipe a little bit, I do use melted butter and cut it just a bit because as much as I LOVED the thinly sliced butter covering the top idea posted by another person, my dad is on a low cholesterol diet, So I add about 1/4 cup of light brown sugar sprinkled over top to add moisture and help it crisp up, and I sprinkle some of the cinnamon over the top also, cause WE LOVE cinnamon! I am always asked to make it every sunday night. HUGE HIT! THANKS!!!

I have made alot of dump cakes, I don't melt my butter, I slice it, not very big, it usually takes 1 1/2 sticks to cover the entire cake, then I cover with nuts.  For the people who said the butter went through, and you like the cake, try it this way.

This recipe is fabulous!  You do need to be sure the butter covers the entire cake mix or you will have dry cake mix in the spots where the butter did not cover.  Increasing the butter quantity a bit helps with this.

So easy, SO delicious! I didn't melt the better, I just covered top with pads of butter. My kids even loved it and they don't like blueberries. I'm trying not to eat the entire pan by myself;)

This is a great recipe and easy.  The first time my sister-in-law made it, it was a little over sweet so when I made it instead of 1/2 cup sugar I changed it to 1/8 cup sugar 1/8 cup splenda.  It is great. It reminds me of a cobbler.   My husband is not a big cake eater but he really likes this recipe.  He said I can make this anytime.

I used frozen berries. I added 10 minutes of cooking time at 300 degrees. Halfway through baking, I added another 1/4 melted butter, then sprinkled with course sugar. I raised the temp to 450 for the last 5 minutes, for a total cooking time of 40 minutes. I WILL be making this again. It's awsome, and I can't wait to try some other variations this winter.

Only differnce I did was I used fresh blackberries instead of blueberries.  I received rave reviews for this recipe.  This now replaces any fresh fruit cobbler recipe I have used in the past.  Amazingly simple recipe that creates a very delicious result.  :)

It was pretty good. The cake topping was too sweet. My husband was skeptical at first but he said it was better than what he expected. I didn't melt the butter, I cut the butter into pats. We had it right from the oven with some vanilla ice cream on top which helped cut the sweetness of the topping.

Very easy, but a little to sweet from the cake mix for my liking. Served with vanilla ice cream which cut down on the sweetness.  Will make again and try different fruits as well as adding things to the cake mix.

Yum Yum Yum!  Was gone in minutes.  I cut up the butter as suggested by other reviewers.  I put mixed half with the dry cake mix and put the remainder on top.

Great recipe for young cooks in the kitchen. My 8-year-old son and I made this for dessert last night, and it was a hit with the family. The only thing I didn't care for was that, where the melted butter didn't hit, it was dry in spots. I will try the pats of butter next time as other reviewers suggest. Otherwise, a delicious, easy recipe. Thanks!

I loved this!  My friends and family did too.  So simple.  I followed previous reviews and placed thin slices of butter over the mix.  A little more time, but I prefer that the "crust" be more uniform.

I followed the recipe exactly and yup ended up with a dry mealy flat substance, that tasted sort of like cake, but was missing all the delicious softnes of traditional cake. It was wayyy to sweet as well and though the ice cream did manage to make ti tolerable I would have peferred to just have the ice cream alone. Sad waste of delicous blueberries and a hour of my life.  Joel

I also sliced the butter and laid it on top of the cake mix rather than melting it and it came out great!  Great reviews and so simple. I would definitely make it again!

I make this all the time, howeve the recipe I used calls for 1/2 pound of butter, not 1/2 cup.  Could be the reason it is so dry for some.  But otherwise we live it!

So easy & delicious. Used the slices of butter tip & 1 added 1/4 cup of dried apple pieces.  This made the blueberries just a bit thicker. Family requests it often.

Used lemon cake mix, since that was what I had on hand, and saw that another reviewer liked it that way.  I also sliced up a cold stick of butter and laid it evenly all over the top of the cake mix on top of the berries with sugar and cinnamon.  This cake turned out really really ohhhh so good.  I'm not sure I would use the lemon cake mix again.  The lemon flavor competes with the blueberries for flavor.  They do go well together but we really love the flavor of blueberries, so i will definitely try this again with a milder cake flavor.  Wonderful and couldn't be easier!  I love that you mix it right in the pan too!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this for the first time tonight for family game night.  This was a HUGE hit and so easy.  NO effort and such a good dessert.  I will be making this for a long time to come.  I made it exactly as written except I used a Golden Vanilla cake mix since it's what I have in the house. Thanks, Debbie!!

I didn't have that many frozen blueberries left, so I also used frozen blackberries and raspberries. Because they were frozen, I had to cook it for about 15 minutes longer. I used a suggestion and added more butter (I used 3/4 cup), but I wish I hadn't! It would have been perfect with 1/2 cup. But otherwise, this turned out great and was really easy. I'll be using this one again for sure.

I had a problem with how much butter this called for.  It was to 'wet' for me. I will probably try this again without as much butter.

This was really good!  I made it for my husband's birthday and he LOVED it.  I added lemon juice to the blueberries before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also did not melt butter but took others advice of slicing a stick of butter on top. Yum!

This was great, I brought it into work and we ate it cold.  I've had it warm before too, both ways are delicious.  I would definitely recommend mixing the butter and cake mix together, and I think I should have used a little more than the 1/2 cup of butter that the recipe calls for.  Great recipe!

I gave this 4 stars because my husband loved it. I thought it was WAY too sweet, but that might be helped by adding some vanilla ice cream. Just a warning - this is much more like a cobbler than a cake. There's really nothing cake-like about it. It does make a yummy blueberry filling, but the topping is basically moistened and baked dry cake mix.

this is really a nice and very simple dessert.. You can not go wrong especially if you eat it nice and warm with ice cream. i make dump cakes alot and have tried lots of fruits. i do however like to put chopped pecans or almond slivers on top. i do however like to drizzle melted butter over the top, especially if you put nuts on top.. it will toast them very nicely... Go ahead make this dessert..

This recipe is a winner!  I had never made a dump cake before and was a little bit leary about trying it.  Let me tell you though, that it was great, and how much easier can you get!?  I used frozen berries, so I had to cook for longer.  I also took the recommendation of slicing the cold butter so it wouldn't pool up.  It was so good!  I'd definitely make this again.

This recipe is fantastic!  I took a lot of the suggestions by other reviewers and the recipe came out perfect!  I used approximately 1/8 of a cup of sugar and about 1 cup of melted butter (may have been a little too much- next time I will go with about 3/4c)  I also added 1 cup of quick oats to the cake mix.  I then sprinkled the top of both pie dishes with dry oats and slivered almonds.  I also mixed in some raspberries.   Fantastic!

WOWOWOW!  so easy & delish!  Took the advice of another reviewer & used 1 stick butter (frozen) and grated on top of cake mix.  I didn't even have time to dish up any ice cream with this before it was ALL GONE!!  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed making this for a dinner party and everyone there enjoyed it.  This is beyond simple and takes less than 10 minutes to prep.  When I made it, I went with others' suggestions to slice the butter rather than melt and pour it.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone--especially someone with little experience baking or who's just short on time.  My only suggestions for this recipe are to cut the sugar or leave it out completely as cake mixes already have sugar in it.  I understand the consistency of the blueberry juice, once cooked, will be runny, but an easier, "healthier" way to combat this, is to just use honey or stevia.  Also, I doubled the amount of cinnamon and also added nutmeg.  Served with lemon sorbet--great pairing!  Great recipe!

i tried to make this a little less bad for us by using angel food cake mix, i can't believe it's not butter, and half splenda/half sugar (1/4c each). it was really good but the mixing the berries w/sugar first is REALLY not necessary as there is so much sugar in the cake mix.  it's really cobbler-y and really good.  i didn't have ice cream so put cool whip on top.  good with a big glass of milk!

This is really good with some minor adjustments.  I followed some others' advice and melted 1/2 the butter.  I used 1/2 the cake mix and stirred it with the berries first, then drizzled the melted butter.  I then "dumped" the other 1/2 cake mix on top, and sliced pats of butter covering the top.  It took closer to 45 or 50 minutes to bake though.  This got gobbled up quick!  Blueberry, strawberry, and raspberry (all fresh) went well together.

this recipe was a huge hit - didn't last more than a few hours in my house.  i used 1/4 cup sugar and mixed the butter with the cake mix before putting it over the blueberries.  i will be making this again soon!

This recipe went over very well with my family.  I did end up with some baked spots as well as raw cake spots.  Next time I make this, I am going to mix the cake mix and melted butter before putting on top of the blueberries.  Overall wonderful flavor and very easy!

I had the same problem with the cake mix being dry except where butter was poured.  I put back in the oven for another 30-40 min and it turned out excellent.  I think the cooking time depends on the bueberries.  If they were frozen or mushy then 30 min might be enough but if you use fresh berries you will need more time.

I only used about 2 1/2 to 3 cups of blueberries and it was plenty. I would use a little bit more butter though.

i GAVE THIS ONE STAR B/C THE YELLOW CAKE MIX IN THE RECIPE CAME THROUGH WAY TO STRONG AND ADDED A WEIRD ZING TO THE FLAVORING-THE IDEA IS GREAT MAYBE INSTEAD OF USEING A BOX CAKE A HOMADE CAKE MIX WOULD TASTE BETTER, ALSO ALOT OF SUGAR, BUT KUDOES ON IDEA WITH SOME TWISTING MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE TURN OUT GOOD

I made this with lots of fresh blueberries (probably more than 4 cups, more like 6) and it was so delicious. We had it at a graduation party in June and it was a delicious summer treat! I'll definitely make this one again. The cinnamon makes it delicious.

This was pretty good. I used blueberry pie filling as blueberries were not in season. There was not enough pie filling to use the 9x13 so I used a slightly smaller pan and about 3/4 of the cake mix. I used a little over a stick of butter and cut it up to cover the top of the cake mix... didnt experiecne any dry spots. Baked for about 45-50 min. It was sooo easy and tasted great with ice cream. It's a great desert if you have unexpected guests or you've spent all you energy on dinner and dont feel like putting alot into your desert.

Made this by following the recipe exactly....wouldn't change a thing! Very easy to make and very tasty! As far as the dry spots go...that's typical of any dump cake. I've found the trick is to spread the butter around as much as possible over the top of the cake.

I was sceptical because I usually make my cakes from scratch. But I was in a hurry for something easy to use up some blueberries. I mixed the berries with some home canned peaches and used a little more butter. This was so easy and good!

i used 2 cans of blueberry pie filling instead of fresh blueberries. it tasted really good! the only thing that i would change is... more cinnamon? but other than that excellent recipe. I also made a previous dump cake  with peaches,  but i used wet vanilla cake mix instead of dry but it tasted good as well.

It was good. There were areas the butter didn't reach so the cake mix stayed dry. I felt like it was too much blueberry to cake.  I'd make it again with adjustments.

I had never heard of a dump cake before but my husband requested it recently, so I found this recipe. It was completely delicious and so easy. I did take the advice of others and instead of melting the butter, I cut into very thin squares and distributed evenly all over the top. Be sure to mash down any cake mix blobs or you’ll get powdery patches. This was great! He ate almost the entire thing himself. Now I’ll be interested to try some other variations!

I reverse the order, put came mix on bottom.  Pour butter over cakemix.  In mixing bowl I mix remaining ingredients then spread over cakemix.  Cooking as directed.

Comes out almost like a cookie with a berry topping.

My family loves it This way better.

Quick and easy dessert.  I used fresh cranberries and a spice cake mix.  Used a fork to lightly mix butter into got to avoid splotches of dry cake mix.  I will probably double the cranberries next time to get a higher fruit to topping ratio

I've made this exactly as written at least twice.  Both times turned out meh with lots of cake crumbs that never got moist or changed in any way.  Sugar sank to the bottom and nothing was consistent.  

Last time I melted the butter and mixed it with the cake mix (think graham cracker crust consistency) and mixed about a quarter of the mixture throughout the blueberries and topped them with the rest.  PERFECTION!!!  It solved every single problem I had previously and we ate the entire thing on one evening!

I've made this cake over and over again.  It seems to require more butter than I'd like to use to get the top looking great, but no one else seems to mind.  I use very cold butter instead of melted which didn't work for me at all.  I add a little bit of lemon juice to the blueberries and usually use a lemon cake mix.  I've also tried it with blueberries and peaches.  Still fantastic.  Couldn't be easier.  Next time I'm going to try to mix the cold butter right in with the cake mix as one reviewer suggested and see if I can get by with less.

7.10.19 ...... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/7528/blueberry-dump-cake/ ... Well, this is an unattractive dessert.  I suppose I'll take the blame for the dry spots, but I spooned the butter over & didn't hit the edges too much.   When I took it out, I spread out the dry spots & sprayed with butter-flavor oil.  It looked better, but still no beauty.  It tastes okay, but kind of like a dessert you used a dry mix & poured butter over.  From me, three stars.  E has it almost gone.  I'll up it one more star for him - & I'll try a homemade version of this.

While the taste was fine, my husband is diabetic and he said this was way too sweet, even more than dump cakes made with pie filling. I would have thought the opposite using fresh fruit but we ended up not eating it. Waste of blueberries I would have just as soon had fresh....

This was scrumptious! I used 3 cups frozen cherry-berry mix plus 1 cup frozen rhubarb. Aside from that, the only changes I made are to add the juice of half a lemon to the fruit, and like another reviewer suggested, I pulsed the cake mix in the food processor with 1 cup of butter. Baked it for about 50-55 minutes. It came out crispy on the top and chewy on the inside. More like a cobbler than a cake, but absolutely delicious. If you want a dessert that tastes like summer, this is it.

Delicious!  Used frozen blueberries since I didn't have fresh on hand and enjoyed the extra moisture they made.  It's super rich so I'll cut down on the added sugar next time, but loved it!

Absolutely scrumptious!  I added some lemon juice to the berries before adding cake mix.  I also sliced the butter thin and set on top of the mix instead of melting it.  I will definitely make again, it was so easy!

Followed recipe exactly. Unfortunately, it was a sad waste of good ingredients.  Piles of dry cake mix, gooey clumps of mushy sludge, and an overall medicinal taste. Wish I had my blueberries, butter  and box of Betty Crocker yellow cake mix back.

My 4 and 6 year old granddaughters made this cake with minimal help from me.  We were all pleased with the result, which we ate warm with vanilla ice cream.  This was was fun to do together, and was quick to make with little cleanup.

It ended up being delicious, but I did have to cook it for an hour.  The 30 minute directed amount of time was way too short and very raw still.  Cooked for an additional 30 minutes and it came out perfect.

I made this recipe with lemon cake and thought it was delicious. I do agree with others that it’s way too sweet so next time I will cut down on the sugar and add lemon to the blueberries. I also used a pastry cutter to combine the cake mix with the butter and dropped into the pan in dollops. The batter is rather sticky and difficult to spread so dropping small amounts and spreading that way helped. Served it warm with vanilla ice cream, everyone enjoyed it.

I made the following changes:  decreased the sugar to about 1/4 cup, used frozen mixed berries that I thawed, added 1 tsp fresh ginger, the zest from one lemon, 2 Tbsp of lemon juice and 3/4 cup of cold butter to the cake mix and pulsed to distribute.  This made more of a pastry than a crumble.  I pressed it over the fruit to cover.  This cooked perfectly in 40 minutes with no dry, uncooked spots at all.

Used 2 tbsp more butter to drizzle over dry mix. Could have reduced the sugar. Lots of flavor with a bit of crisp. Not dry, or grainy -which surprised me. So easy i will make it  again.

Hi Chefs!

I made this delicious dump cake but I made a few changes: I used mixed berries (i.e., blueberries, strawberries and cherries), used  1 cup of better (instead of 1/2 cup) and I used 1 cup of sugar (we like it sweet).  It turned out very well.  Hubbie asked me to make it again tonight!

Better than the Bakery.  I used Fresh Wild FROZEN Blueberries still frozen.   I put the cake (vanilla) on top and drizzled melted butter.   I will make this again.  My husband is a Chef -- he said it was EXCELLENT!

I haven't made this particular recipe, but several other dump cakes. It works much better to lay butter slices on top of the  cake mix..... less dried cake mix. I hate it when someone disses a recipe. I will try it! 
And don't start off saying, " I made these changes"....??

I did add a few extra tabs of butter in a few dry spots and after baking it I broiled it for an extra crispy top. The taste reminds me of blueberry pop tarts.

I followed the directions exactly and the cake was terrible. The cake mix should been mixed with the butter. After 30 min. it was not brown and you could see the dry cake mix. I left it in for one hour  and took it out. A waste of blueberries.

I think next time I would make this in a 9x9 pan instead of a 9x13. There was a little too much surface area, and the melted butter didn't cover all of it, leaving some dry patches of cake mix. But otherwise this was pretty great.

Made this with lemon cake mix and omitted the cinnamon and it was gone in 5 minutes. I also put more blueberries on top. 
Didn't melt the butter but sliced it and layered on top.  
It's okay to use frozen berries too. Just thaw them in a colander so they drain. Will be making this again but will make two!!!

Good but I made two changes to make it great, at least for us. Two changes: one brown the butter. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter and cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until it smells very nutty, turns golden, and flecks of dark brown appear, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix the browned butter with the cake mix and spread over berries. Then bake.

I would make it again but would use a little smaller pan, maybe one size down.  The cake was delicious.

it's been in the oven almost an hour and the batter still hasn't been absorbed.... if I make it again I'll probably make the cake better as directed on the box and pour over the blueberries.

Update:  after an hour it was done I put water where the batter was still dry and it tasted excellent with a side of ice cream. Batter Plus better formed a lovely crust.

I followed the recipe exactly, the only exception I made was not melting the butter.  Instead, I sliced the chilled butter and ensured that I covered the entire 9 x 13 pan with a little space in between each slice of butter.  I also baked it until slightly brown which took 45mins.  I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  My entire family raved about this dessert and even asked for seconds.  I will definitely make this again! A new family favourite.

Easy, easy. I did have to bake it to 40 minutes until the top was slightly brown. Delicious warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Will definitely make often, maybe trying frozen fresh peaches and sprinkling with more cinnamon, a little fresh nutmeg and sliced almonds...yumm!!!

Meh... I can't say we were thrilled with this recipe. I made it as directed, except I don't think cake mixes come in 18+oz anymore, so I used the 15+oz box I had on hand. The topping was a golden brown, but still had a raw taste/texture after 40 min. in the oven. We tried it at room temperature and reheated, didn't make much difference. BUT the bubbly blueberry, sugar, cinnamon bottom was fantastic! It has sparked some ideas that I will try next time I have an abundance of fresh blueberries...

Oh my goodness, this recipe is beyond horrible. I followed the recipe exactly. The cake mix was not  cooked and it had lumps of powdery mix all over...I was very upset. I just threw it in garbage.

SO friggin delicious. The ONLY critique I have is that when you bake it, if you missed ANY spot of the cake topping with the butter, it is dry and powdery still. So I had to add more butter to the powdery spots at the very end to fix it. Next time I would maybe cut the butter up really small and place it all over the cake instead of using melted butter. Other than that, SO good!

Is a new favorite -- just make sure you to try to get butter on all of the cake.  it's okay if some is left dry -- it's called dump cake.  it was very tasty

We liked this.   I made with 1/2 cup of Stevia instead of sugar and it was  too sweet.  Will cut the Stevia in half next time.  I used a frozen berry mixture(thawed) and a white cake mix.  Next time will use a yellow butter cake mix to give it a more buttery flavor.  I also place the butter chunks on top of mix instead of melting it.

I used blueberries that I had flash frozen and I think that's why my cake was very thin. It was still very good but a bit too sweet. Next time I will cut the sugar in half.

I pretty much followed this recipe to a t but used french vanilla moist cake mix.  Used sliced butter vs melted and noticed it was not browning at the 30 minute mark so baked for 50 minutes and it came out perfect.  So easy that now dump cakes are my favorite and won't bake anything else!

Came out Awesome, as others have stated, I used Lemon Cake mix instead of white or yellow, I doubled the Cinnamon, and added lemon extract  to the blueberry/sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I also made a powdered  suger glaze with fresh lemon juice, and lemon zest for the top.  It came out amazing!!!

It was super quick and easy, edible, but not great. The topping texture was a little mushy. Great in a pinch though. I used yellow butter cake mix, frozen berries, and based on the recommendations by reviewers I added an extra 1/4 cup of butter.

Super easy! I sliced a cup of strawberries and added 3-4 cups of blueberries (I didn't measure) to the bottom of 9 x 13. (No lemon juice) I sprinkled the 1/2 cup sugar over the berries evenly (I didn't mix it beforehand like it says in recipe). Then I evenly sprinkled 1/2 tsp of cinnamon over the sugar. Used French Vanilla cake mix. Sliced 1 1/2 sticks of butter and put in all over the top.  Baked uncovered for 30 minutes. Then broiled for about 2 minutes to golden the top up nicely. After it cooled for about an hour, I set it out for our pool party. It was still warm but not lava hot. Included choice of whip cream or vanilla ice cream.  The whole thing was scraped clean in less than  30 minutes! Next time I will make two! One more thing, all I tasted were the blueberries, so maybe more strawberries next time.

Followed the recipe to the letter. The blueberries tasted amazing and the topping was nice. However, only an inch of the topping was cooked. The rest underneath was still dry cake mix. It was unappealing. If I ever make this again I might try using less cake mix or mixing half into the berries first.

Delicious and easy!   After reading the comments, I made a few changes.  First, I used a lemon cake mix.  Lemon and blueberry combo is amazing.  Secondly, I used less sugar.  I shook the blueberries in a baggie with 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/8 tspn cinnamon.  Thirdly, most important, I worked a stick of softened butter in the cake mix like I do when I make a pie crust.  The entire cake mix was mixed well with the butter, it was not dry at all.  I cooked for 20 minutes.  Delicious with vanilla ice cream!

Very good. I followed the directions except I deleted cinnamon and mixed cold coconut oil with cake mix rather than butter.  I was out of butter.  I also have made it with a berry mix of frozen cherries, cranberries, blueberries, raspberries.

Fantastic! I did not add any sugar because it doesn't need it. I also cut cold butter into pats and spread it over the cake before baking

Easy and delicious. I used frozen blueberries (about 2 bags), and sliced 1.5 sticks of butter for the top (not melted just sliced and spread on top). Otherwise I stick to the recipe.  Best served warm with vanilla ice cream.

Made this recipe and didn't enjoy it.  The cake mix doesn't fully cook and  although the recipe says to bake it for 30 minutes, it takes almost an hour to get the cake mix to a place where it isn't "raw".  Would not make this again.

This is fabulous, easy, and delicious!  You cannot mess it up and I'll be making it every time I need a quick dessert and/or when company stops over!  You can change it up with different fruits and different cake mixes!  Like another reviewer here, I used the lemon cake mix with the blueberries!  Wow!  I also added a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg.  I used 1 stick of melted butter and 1 stick of cut up butter on top - making a whole cup of butter, so it wasn't dry Or too greasy.  I didn't measure blueberries, I just dumped them in; but I felt like it was more like 2 cups and not 4!  Lastly, the final touch, which also helped to cut sweetness, was to mix in a blueberry yogurt container with a cup of fresh whipped cream.  I read that in a magazine and it was superb!!!  I cooked all in a cast iron skillet for 40 minutes!!??

I had a tub of fresh picked blueberries and this was perfect.  Not too sweet, and just the right amount of crunch on the topping.  I would recommend a little extra butter and keep it toward  the middle, the outer edged seemed to have the blueberry juice coming up around the sides.  I used a strawberry cake mix instead and it was delicious.

this is my first review but this recipe was so good and easy to follow I had to write this. I did use lemon cake mix however instead of yellow and baked it a little longer so the cake is crunchy and it was delicious within two days the whole pan was gone the kids loved it.

This is my go to recipe for dessert! I used lemon cake mix, and also cut the butter in pieces on the top so it wouldn't dry out.  I used frozen blueberries and raspberries - super yummy!

What a tasty and EASY dessert to make.  My picky picky hubby loves it and my equally picky son, who doesn't like blue berries really likes it too. I didn't have any ice cream so we topped it with Cool Whip.

Great cake. I used frozen berries and a spice cake. Like others, I did not melt my butter first but I did use a spray "butter" to fill in the spots that the cube slices did not cover. Next I want to try it with the lemon cake.

So good.  So easy.  So versatile; my local grocer had a sale on raspberries, so I did part raspberries, part blueberries and it was really good.  In comparison to all desserts, this is not the best I've ever had, but it deserves 5 stars b/c of how good it is for such little effort.

I made this to serve with lunch after church on Sunday.  I also used a full cup of melted butter like others suggested.  It was a huge hit!!  This was so easy to make.  I'll definitely make it again. Thanks.

We enjoy this recipe! I've made it twice using some of the suggestions from other reviews.  I used 1/2 the suggested amount of sugar.  It is still very sweet & next time I will cut back further.  I grated the butter & spread it on top of the cake mix.  Just watch for dry spots during baking and put a little pat of butter on them if there are any.  I served this with whipped cream.  Very yummy!

This was sickly sweet, this is the worst dump cake I ever made!. Dry and hard on top, even using bits of butter instead of melting it didn't help.   I can usually eat my failures...not this time. Don't waste your blueberries!!

I used fresh blackberries and a butter spead instead of stick butter. I tasted a bite b/f I sent it to my neighbors, friends, and relatives. It was buttery and sweet. I think they will like it if they can deal w/ the seeds in the blackberries.

I'm with Louise Canada.  Sorry I used the berries.  I tried adding the milk before it finished cooking, smothered it with ice cream and still hated it.  Way too sweet for me.  Maybe if you made the caked mix according to the box and poured it over the berries without the sugar it would be better.  Not going to waste the berries to find out though.
