Scared of the very word "ganache"?  Well, you don't have to be with this recipe!  This is THE easiest ganache recipe I've ever used.  Since I was out of dark chocolate (which I highly recommend), I had to use semi-sweet chocolate chips--1 cup worth--and threw them into my food processor to save time and energy from chopping.  Once they were all chopped up and the whipping cream (didn't have heavy cream, either)was nice and bubbly, I turned the processor on and slowly poured in the whipping cream.  Stopped, scraped the sides, mixed it again, took the blade out (chunks of chocolate will stay on the blade, and you don't want the chunks of chocolate falling onto your cake when spreading the mix!), and put the mixture in the fridge for 15 minutes.  When the mix was a few notches looser than wiggly jello, I slowly poured the mix over my chocolate truffle cheesecake (which was cooled completely).  I had previously run a knife around the cheesecake and loosened the edges from the pan, then all but snapped the spring-form pan back into shape, leaving a slight space for the ganache to drip over the sides of the cake.  Let the cheesecake refridgerate overnight and you've got a big hit!  Note: after you've poured the ganache over the cake, use your finger to pop any air bubbles, so the finished product has a beautiful complextion.  Also, the better the quality of choclate, the better the ganache.  Don't go cheap on the choclate if you want a killer ganache!!

If you whip this in your mixer for 5 minutes or until it changes from a dark brown to a light brown, it will make the most wonderful frosting! VERY YUMMY!!!!!!

Outstanding and easy!!SO worth it for both flavour and presentation.
Suggestions: Be EXTRA careful not to let any water get into your chocolate, as it will seize- not a good thing. Let the chocolate thicken a bit before pouring, place your cake on a rack over parchment paper for easy clean up, and take your cake off the rack and put on to your serving plate before the ganache has set- otherwise it can attach to the rack and tear when you lift it off. A wonderful recipe sure to win compliments from all!!!

I thought this recipe would be really touchy and difficult to get perfect, but it was incredibly easy.  I used it in the place of regular icing for a chocolate layer cake.  First, I used 3 oz semisweet chocolate chips (that's all I could find) and 1/3 c. of cream with a little bit of Bacardi rum, and I put it in the freezer for a few minutes after mixing.  I used an electric mixer to beat it up into a fluffy icing for between my layers. It seemed like it would be too thin for it to work, but it got perfectly fluffy and light brown and gorgeous.  I then made another batch with the full portions but didn't beat it into fluffy icing, and used that for the top and the sides.  It turned out gorgeous and everyone loved it. I don't think I'll ever make plain icing again.

This was a great first-timer ganache recipe!  I added 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 semi-sweet, as I like milk chocolate better.  I used it over a devils food and cookie dough ice cream cake- too good for words!  Everyone said I could put Cold Stone out of business! :)  I am now trying it with White chocolate.  Note to people using it as a frosting/icing: put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes- it will set up quicker and better!

Perfect and simple, especially for die hard chocolate lovers. This is very rich and intensely chocolate! I used Perugina Italian bittersweet chocolate and didn't use the optional rum. This was the perfect glaze for my Snickers Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake. Very reliable and versatile glaze or frosting. If used as a glaze, let it cool somewhat, until it's pourable and still warm. If used as a frosting, let it cool, then chill in refrigerator for a few hours, then whip it till light and fluffy.

excellent.  i used to to coat a cheesecake that cracked and it looks beautiful.  TIP:  chill whatever you are going to coat first ... the ganache will adhere better.  

also, used a Hershey's Special Dark and semi sweet chips, and added vanilla cognac instead of rum.  delicious!

Love it, love it, love it! Turned out dark, glossy, and delicious! Very easy to make and very good to eat. I used it as a topping for Chantal's New York Style Cheesecake. The only thing i did differently was to use semi-sweet chocolate chips not bittersweet. It didn't make the color lighter and it tasted sweeter. Great!

Fool-proof. Simple, lovely to look at, easy to make. I whipped it to use as a frosting. The taste quality of your finished product is completely dependent upon the type of chocolate you use. Caillebaut (I get it at Whole Foods) is the best I've tried. I'm sure Lindt or Godiva would be wonderful, as well. Be aware that made as written, it is "adult" type chocolate, meaning not very sweet, so to increase kid appeal you'd need to tinker with it, using part or all milk chocolate instead of bittersweet. To make it into a more "mainstream" type of frosting (though not cloyingly sweet) after whipping it, you can add a stick of softened butter, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup sifted powdered sugar. whipped again until it's stiff enough to spread. Additionally, doing this will "stretch" the amount so that you can easily fill, frost and decorate three 9" layers. This retains its shape as well as its appealing, mirror-like sheen. It will not crust, no matter how long you leave it out. As a decorative touch, I saved out about 1/4 cup of the original ganache (while liquid, before I whipped it to turn it into frosting) and later poured it over the frosted cake, letting it drizzle lazily over the sides, then placed a pile of chocolate shavings in the center.  Get your cameras ready for a Kodak moment! Stunning presentation, positively DECADENT flavor!!!

I've never used rum but this icing is great as a ganache or whipped into a frosting.

My husband made this last night for a chocolate pound cake. He generally makes the ganache perfectly but screwed it up last night and we ended up with "broken ganache." If your ganache ends up looking like caviar or used coffee grounds then you didnt heat the cream high enough. 

We had used all of our cream and fine dark chocolate from Christmas. There was no plan B for the cake.

In order to fix this you split the broken ganache in half. We put half in a bowl and placed it outside for a half an hour, but the freezer works well too. Once chilled, you heat the other half. We used the microwave. Then you re-mix using an electric mixer. It came out perfectly.

WOWOWOWOWOW! Ok this was soooo easy to make (and I've never made ganache before!) and it tasted AMAZING!!!)
For those of you using chocolate chips 9 oz = 1 and 1/2 cups. I split it between semi-sweet and milk chocolate (3/4 cup for each). Half of the ganache I put in the freezer for 20 minutes, then whipped it into light fluffy truffle frosting (only took about 30 seconds to whip it). The other half I poured over the top of my cake then scattered blue sprinkles over. I had some ganache left over so I dipped some pretzel sticks in it then stuck those in the freezer! For my cake I had used the Brownie Frosting Recipe from this site for the inside, and top layer of frosting (see pics)! Oh, and I didn't use the rum for mine, still tasted great!

So easy and almost fool-proof! Used 4 oz bittersweet Ghirardelli chips (they seem to melt better than other chips) and 6 oz semi sweet Ghirardelli chips-no need to chop- 3/4 cup cream, three tablespoons melted regular butter, and 2 teaspoons corn syrup (really makes it shine). Heated cream AND syrup to boiling, poured over chips, let set for 5-10 minutes, then slowly stirred with spoon to prevent air bubbles.  Mixed in melted butter as soon as chocolate was melted. Butter adds a richness to it.   Let sit for 15 or 20 minutes depending on how runny you want it. Room temp product is fudgy frosting-like.  Thanks for the basic recipe!!!

I made this ganache to cover an 8 inch round cake.  It was a little too much for the size but I can still use the leftover for icecream or toast or anything.  It tasted very good!  I used 70% dark chocolate from a good chocolate shop in town.  If you chill up your cake in the fridge at least 3 or 4 hours before you pour the ganache on it then put your cake in the fridge again, the ganache firms up very nicely, not too hard but not runny at all :)

Easy, simple.. DELICIOUS!
I am never EVER making another chocolate frosting.. this doesnt have that sugar after taste that other frostings have.. also I imagine it wont taste like plastic tomorrow like other frostings that use butter
thanks!
5 Dic: Im going to make this with cadburry three wishes chocolate that has dark, milk and white chocolate. in chile its called tres sueños. I want to frost cupcakes with it. I will tell you how they come out!
UPDATE: Ok, so i made this with milka triolade and it was oh so goooooooood! however, the texture was more like a mousse when i whipped it. so next time im going to use 10.5 ounces triolade chocolate and 3/4 cup cream . Why? because milk and white chocolate have milk! and a higher fat content (Should have thought about it before LOL)
i also was a little in a hurry so i put the still warm ganache in the freezer and it curdled a bit. make sure you have the time it takes to let this cool down. dont put it in the fridge if its not at room temperature. make sure you like the chocolate your using, or LOVE IT. the ganache will taste like it only a bit softer.. 
I cant believe chocolate companys havent made there version of ganache yet.. its much better than any frosting or buttercream. 
UPDATE 2. made the ganache and dipped strawberries in it , put them on foil and stuck them in the fridge!!! perfect, the chocolate hardened so beatifully. i will upload a picture! if doing this make sure the strawberries are dry so the ganache sticks to them

With or without the rum, this is a wonderful recipe!! I use it all the time for all kinds of sweets!! A little note: if you refridgerate it for 4hrs or overnight, you can use it for a chocolate truffle! It's so yummy, you just use a melon baller and scoop up some of the chilled ganache and dip it into any kind of melted (slightly cooled) chocolate, let it set and you have a melt in your mouth truffle :)) Enjoy!!

I expected the chocolate to harden for my chocolate covered strawberries, so I think that's why this recipe disappointed me.

So perfect! I can always rely on this ganache to deliver that extra punch to top of all of my desserts. It would taste great on anything! As a big fan of dark chocolate, I love how the bittersweet chocolate makes the ganache very dark chocolaty tasting. But, to please my not-so-fond-of-dark-chocolate crowd, I simply substitute semisweet chocolate to make this a more innocent milk chocolaty ganache. Either way, the ganache always comes out superb.

This was the first time I ever attempted to make a chocolate ganache, and it turned out so well! I made 2 batches - one for cupcakes and chocolate covered strawberries, and one for a cake.  Everyone thought it was delicious, and it looked so professional! I did not use the optional rum but it was still really good.  I just dipped the cupcake tops in it and it was SO much easier than frosting them all.  I loved working with it... the longer you let it cool the more solid it becomes so I let it cool a little longer before pouring it over the cake.  Thanks for this simple recipe!

Very, very easy recipe to throw together, as a few others reviewers suggest, I place mine in the freezer for about 20 minutes and then whipped it till light and fluffy. It sets up beautifully and I for something that sounds so elegant it is very easy to make! Makes us look like pro's!

For personal taste I would use semi sweet instead of bitter sweet chocolate. Also chocolate chips can be used instead of cutting up bakers chocolate to save time.

Super ganache! I still can't believe how easy it was for such a great result. I halved this recipe and used it to top a chocolate cheesecake. It came out beautifully, and had a smooth, dark sheen when it set, making it look very professional. I used 4.5oz of semi-sweet bakers chocolate, and didn't add the rum. I had some concerns that all the chocolate wouldn't melt simply by pouring the heated cream on top - but it did perfectly. After letting it set up in the refrigerator for about 20min it was ready to go. Half the recipe was a perfect amount for a 9' cheesecake. For those who are pouring it... it will stick better if the cake/cupcakes are completely cooled or chilled (where appropriate), giving that pretty dripped effect on the sides without having too much drip completely down and off. I'll be using this again for sure.

Very good, very easy. I had a terror the chocolate would seize or wouldn't have the nice shine I was looking for but no need to worry on both counts.  I used Lindt baking wafers (58% cocoa) and because I store them frozen I melted the chocolate in a double boiler.  Once the chocolate was just melted I set aside, boiled the cream then poured the chocolate into the cream to minimize the risk of seizing.  I stirred slowly until the mixture came together with no streaks remaining.  I omitted the rum.  After cooling for a bit I poured 3/4 over Black Magic Cake (from this website) and left the remaining ganache in the fridge for about 1/2 an hour then whipped and decorated the sides of the cake.  The flavor was chocolatey without being too sweet and complemented the cake beautifully.  I will definitely be making again!

This recipe is so easy and very good.  I used Nestle semi-sweet chocolate chips, and it turned out great!

This turned out amazing! Rich and decadent!! I used fat free half and half (watch it carefully because when heating too fast it can curdle). It didn't whip up into the frosting when I tried so I just used it as a ganache and it was so good! Since it's thinner with the fat free half and half, next time I will slice my cakes into more layers and add it to every one. It's a must try!!!

Made this today for my son's birthday cupcakes that were filled. I double dipped some of them. For the rest I whipped the chilled ganache w/ a little shortening and confectioner's sugar to cut the bitterness of the dark chocolate (son doesn't like anything other than milk chocolate). They turned out great. The whipped ganache was very light. A definite keeper. Super easy and beautiful ganache for pouring on top of, or dipping items into, to ice.

You can use a bag of Candy Melts as well. Whipping it makes the tastiest filling ever for cakes.  This is the BEST. I am getting ready to pour this over a Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Cake for my 33 year old daughter's birthday. You don't need a lot of decorations with this stuff. It is gorgeous by itself. LOVE IT!

Fantastic Recipe! I love this recipe. I have used this ganache a handful of times and I get tons of compliments everytime. I use Ghirardelli baking bars for the chocolate. I have made it with semi-sweet, bittersweet and milk chocolate...they have all turned out fantastic. The recipe calls for 9 ounces of chocolate to 1 cup of cream...most of the baking bars I have bought come in increments of 4oz. so I reduce the amount of cream to 3/4 cup of cream for 8 ounces of chocolate (2 bars) or I use 2 bars and a 1/4 of a 3rd baking bar to make 9oz. It is not a difficult recipe at all and you will not be disappointed...Try It! You will love it! Thank you so much for sharing it INGRIDEVOGEL!

I used semi-sweet chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand. After letting it cool about an hour I whipped it to use as a frosting on the "black magic cake" from this site. It was so yummy

Definitely let it cool and whip it again: after the first time it's liquid. I did 250 ml cream and 200 g chocolate and after the second whipping it was fine, and delicious!

This is a really EASY recipe for ganache.  If you don't want to fuss around with the stove, you could just microwave the cream until it starts to bubble. TIP:  I put my chocolate chips in a measuring cup and poured my hot cream directly over the chocolate chips.  This is really helpful when pouring the ganache over a cake for a glazed look!

I was making it to pour over a strawberry cake with strawberry swiss buttercream and I'm so glad I tasted it before I dumped it over.  I did use bittersweet chocolate and it was SO bitter.  It probably would've been good with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  If this is what ganache is supposed to taste like, I'm glad I had never tried it before.

GREAT all-purpose icing!  I've combined this with the other recipe and add 3 T. butter, 1 t. vanilla, and 2 T. light corn syrup.  This thickens the icing up perfectly!  I've also used both rum and whiskey and both work great depending on the use.  I always split the chocolate 60/40 bittersweet or dark (70% caco), and half semi-sweet.  It just seems to be the way the amounts in the package work out.  This does make A LOT of icing too - enough for me to easily do 24 cupcakes.

I made this for the first time and whipped it for a birthday cake. It turned out really well. I had a lot left over( used the whole bag of chips) and iced the whole cake with it. Big mistake. It was just not sweet enough and was over powering. I will make this again with milk chocolate and it should be a great hit. Thanks for posting this recipe.

So simple, and so, so wonderful. Buy the best chocolate you can find for a truly rich ganache. Add a little butter (1T) for a nice shine. If you're going to whip it into frosting, *Let.*It.*COOL.* Overnight even, if you have the time. Don't hesitate to make this one. It never disappoints!

I made this today to use as a frosting in between layers of my Chocolate Chiffon Cake. It's so easy to make and its very yummy with a rich chocolate flavor. I used dark chocolate coca powder and semi sweet chocolate. However, if you are going to fluff it, I strongly suggest using a hand mixer because it takes a while to get it to stiffen and fluff. Your arm will fall off it you do it with a whisk.

Terrific and so easy to make.  I made this recipe for a yummy Black Magic Cake (which is also available on Allrecipes.com).  Next time I'll allow the icing to cool longer and I won't be so stingy with the icing between layers.  A definite keeper!

Great recipe! I used dark chocolate and  added a bit of powdered sugar to sweeten it. I used it to coat an ice cream cake! It does get thicker if you let it sit about 30 minutes.

This was my first attempt at a Ganache...so easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly then split it in half. Kept half on the counter and put half in the freezer to cool for 15min. Whipped the freezer stuff up to a fluffy yummy frosting. I used that for the inner layer of my cake. then chilled the whole cake for 15min and covered it with the remaining Ganache that was on the counter. It all came out beautifully!! My husband who doesn't eat chocolate or dessert had 2 pieces saying it was the best cake I had ever made!! That says a lot. I will be using this recipe again and again!

I just don't get it.  Where is the sweetness to this?  I realized after making this exactly as described and using Scharfenberger chocolate, that it was not sweet at all.  When I looked at the recipe there wasn't any sugar called for.  Is it supposed to be that bitter?  Anyways, I definitely will not be making this again.  I had to add powdered sugar to this in order to sweeten it up some and make a frosting out of it.

I used this to coat a french chocolate truffle cake from this site.  It was amazing!  Very rich but perfect for the chocoholic.  I place my cake on a wired baking rack placed on top of a round baking pan and poured the ganache over it.  I was then able to pour the drippings back over the cake to make sure every bit was covered.

This ganache recipe also works very well when you substitute the same amount of white chocolate for dark and gives you a delicious white chocolate frosting when whipped.

I give the recipe 5 stars, but I didn't care for the dark flavor. I used 1/3 dark and 2/3 milk, and the dark still overpowered the flavor so next time I will use milk or semi-sweet. I whipped this up and spread on a chocolate layer cake, filled with chocolate mousse, and the frosting was too rich to eat. I will make again, but next time I won't put so much on the cake, just a thin coating.

Everyone is always impressed when I use this for frosting cupcakes.  I did leave out the rum just because I didn't have any, and it turned out great.  I always have to give the recipe out!

5 Stars for flavor - it was excellent! I made a double batch and covered the top of my cake and sides, still have 3 cups left over! I wish it would've hardened a bit more, but the flavor was fantastic.

Fantastic, easy and scrumptious! I made it exactly according to the recipe, sans rum.  It was a perfect use for left-over ends of chocolate chip samples.  Shortly after making, I put some between the laers of the cake and drizzled the rest on the top...it actually is an ATTRACTIVE frosted cake! Unlike my usual ones. :) Oh, and a measuring tip in case you haven't already figured this one out.  A half pint of cream was exactly one cup. Scrumptious, perfect. Yum...will make again!

This was so good and incredibly easy.  I used it as a filling in a cake.  I'll be using this recipe again.

Update: I've used this recipe many times, using different flavorings (raspberry, mint, vanilla, etc) - all were delicious.  Recently, I had the kids help whisk the ganache into frosting for cupcakes.  We took turns whipping it using a regular whisk and it worked quite well.  They had so much fun and it was delicious!

I loved this. It was my first time making a ganache. I used a cup and a half of Ghiradelli 60% cocoa chocolate chips that I pulsed in my Ninja a few times just to break them up more. Heated the cream until just bubbling, poured over the chocolate and stirred until streaks were gone. I put it in the freezer for about half an hour then used my electric mixer to make frosting. It tastes great, almost mousse-like in the texture. Now if only I could get my cake layers to stop baking at a slant, this would have been the perfect cake.

Idk why this calls for bitter sweet chocolate. Not good! But it would be with semi-sweet.

Love this recipe. So simple and tasty!  Perfect recipe for my first ganache. Great for any kind of chocolate, not just bittersweet, but don't forget to adjust the cream/chocolate ration when using other kinds (particularly white chocolate).  I suggest semi-sweet. Also, if you want to use this as frosting, you will have to add powdered sugar or cut back on the cream. As is, it does set up, but never to spreadable consistancy.

Simple & Decadent - adding different liquor or extracts changes it up.  Simply wonderfully perfect!  I love to use on cheesecake - cuts the sweetness.  Use the best chocolate you can - I love anything 70% or more.

This recipe is absolutely marvelous! I used a whole batch of the whipped version to fill a 2-layer 9" cake and then made another batch as is to pour over it. The result is a beautiful, glossy finish that is sure to impress anyone! This ganache is perfect with the Black Magic Cake recipe on this site, and the combination is out of this world! The whipped version is perfect for cupcakes and it tastes exactly like chocolate ice cream! Also, when whipping the ganache for the frosting, it took me quite a while with a beater to get the fluffy consistency, so don't give up if it takes you a while too! This will definitely be my go-to recipe for a frosting/ganache from now on!!!

I made this except I used vanilla instead of rum.  It was delicious.  I will use this recipe from now on for this type of frosting or topping.  I chilled it in the refrigerator until it thickened up and then beat it for a while and spread it over a Mounds Cake (aka, chocolate coconut cake) and it was a winner.  Thanks Ingridevogel for posting this.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  It is so easy and I have thrown out all other frosting recipes in my cookbook.  It is a rich chocolate glaze that melts in your mouth.  If you let it sit and cool, it will be the best chocolate frosting you will ever make.  I've had tons of requests for this and it never disappoints.  A no-brainer recipe.  Thank you so much!!!

Very yummy on my Boston cream pie cupcakes!

I melted the chocolate in the microwave according to package directions and then poured in the heavy cream. Looks so professional &  tastes GREAT!

I used this on my David's Yellow cupcakes with the Pastry Cream I made earlier.  It came out very smooth and chocolatey.  I used Semi Sweet real chocolate from Guittard - so you could say this is a three time All Recipes cupcake.

As a pour on ganache, I would say this is allright, still a little bit lumpy, but pretty smooth.  But once you whip it, oh my, its heavenly.  Its firm, and stiff, like buttercream, but a hundred times richer and more chocolatey than buttercream could ever get.  Plus it has a light texture to it

I used 9 oz (1 cup and a half) of semisweet chocolate chips, and instead of dark rum I used Torched Cherry Rum, since the ganache was going on the Cherry Chocolate cake (on this site). Very easy and very good. Made plenty to cover the cake and then some to dip fruit in! Will try whipping it into frosting next time!

Perfect! Used grand Marnier instead of rum, and semi sweet mini chocolate chips, only because these were on hand. Poured over a cracked top cheesecake. It filled in the cracks, the top is completely smooth, and the slices look pretty.

YES! YES! YES! This is great! So easy and quick! Liked it with the bittersweet, loved it with the semi-sweet. Tried it with white chocolate, did not work so well.
Used ganache on ice cream cake, worked well and froze well. Also made a frosting, was easy and delicious, got great reviews on frosting for cup cakes. Again, semi-sweet was a bit better then bittersweet (personal preference). Also used to make chocolate strawberries.  have made with and without the rum. Can't say I could really tell the difference. 
Love this!!

I tried this recipe following it exactly and it was very thin and runny so I tried adding 1/3 more chocolate chips and it still would not set up. what a disaster! could it have been the chocolate I used or the heavy whipping cream? I have to admit I have never seen a recipe for ganach that called for this much cream.

I made this with half bittersweet and half semi-sweet chocolate.  It was very good. I think the next time I would make it with all semi-sweet.  Definitely the easiest ganache to make and I will be making it again.

I made this in two versions as frosting for muffins: double cream (51% fat) and heavy cream (40% fat). Go for the double cream. It tastes way better. It won't increase in volume as much as heavy cream if you whisk it for frosting, so you may need a bit more.

Super easy and tastes amazing! I made this to put in between my red velvet cake layers on top of the cream cheese frosting, the results were great! Although since I wasn't really thinking and should've halved the recipe I know have lots of ganache left over......oh well guess that means more baking and I'll use it as a frosting :0)

I made this exactly as written using Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Bittersweet chips & a family favorite chocolate cake recipe.  It was completely successful & I can't stop sneaking a bite of last piece. However, you should be warned that it is seriously chocolatey!  Do not overestimate your chocoholic guest's dedication.  Some guests left the ganache & ate the cake.  My cake was cool & the ganache was only barely cooled down & it still set up pretty thick.  Next time I'll try to lay it on a little lighter or thin it slightly with more cream.  The rum added a little flair & it didn't taste of the alcohol.  I'll use it again.  thanks!

It tastes great, but flat out:  if your going to use this as a frosting or filling, you're going to have to add at least 3/4 cup of confectioners sugar...and whisk the hell out of it

This worked great - and I had been a little nervous for whatever reason. I did two, a milk chocolate and a bittersweet. I poured the milk chocolate one while it was thin to do a 'glaze,' and poured the bitterweet thicker onto the plate before laying the cake on it. Pretty and delicious! I'll use this again, thanks!

Oh My Goodness!  LIke other users, I wanted this as a chocolate truffle filling for my layer cake and so I put it in the freezer for 1/2 hour and then took it out and whipped it up with my Kitchen Hand Mixer for 5 minutes and oh my goodness, the colour lightened, it got fluffy and it was delicious...it was so hard to not eat it right out of the bowl!  Look no further for the best ganache recipe ever!  This is totally to die for!  I don't think I will ever make plain buttercream icing again!  I didn't use bittersweet, I used fine dark belgian chocolate and it was excellent!  I didn't have regular cream so I used whipping cream!  I wasn't able to ice my cake right away and I let it sit for 15 minutes and it did harden up a bit and was a little hard to spread; so next time I will spread it right away for easier application.  Thanks so much for this recipe! MMmmmmmm! A+++

Every ganache I've ever made has hardened up pretty quickly after being chilled and can be easily spread on the cake.  I refrigerated it for hours trying to get it to set so I could finish my cake, and the consistency never changed from being sauce-like.  The sauce tasted fabulous, but it did not work the way I needed it to for the cake I was making.

I made this as a topping for a chocolate cupcake. After letting it cool for a about 30mins, I dipped. After the ganache cooled off, it gave the cupcake a lovely chocolatey shine. Very nice!

Fantastic! For those who found it runny,the longer you let it cool, the thicker it gets.  I let mine cool at room temperature overnight.

I made this ganache with white chocolate instead. I used a vanilla extract w/ vanilla seeds in it. I was a little scared because I didn't know if it would work.  I ended up mixing the ganache in a mixer.  I did this because I am using it as a filling so I didn't care if I had air bubbles.  It is beautiful.  Thank you so much for your recipe.

This is a really good recipie. I acutally just microwaved everything and it worked. ( Note, when microwaving chocolate, be very careful as the chocolate retains its shape even tho its melted. I microwaved for 30secs at a time to check on it.) I put in 4 capfuls of Bailey's and its delish! But the problem i had was that it had a runny, glaze texture. Maybe its because I used cabury dairy milk chocolate, but the ganache only became a frosting after I left in the bowl overnight even though I whipped it as instructed. Next time, I leave it in the fridge till it turns to frosting and then use it to frost my cake. But the runny glaze gave my cake a really nice fudge like glaze that really worked as well. Good stuff! Thanks Ingrid! It went great with the "Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake" from this site too!

Nothing wrong with this one!  Just what I wanted.  Used the rum.  Topped Peanut Butter Cake III from this site (which is a bit dry) with this.  Put raspberry jam in the middle (between cake layers).  The ganache poured and set perfectly, would be beautiful if you sprinkled some shaved chocolate overtop or set any garnishes on top shortly after pouring.  I let the ganache sit in the pot for about 15 minutes before pouring.  Used food processor to finely chop chocolate.  Great stuff with 3 ingredients!

This recipe was great! I used it at its most liquid and it turned into a beautiful and shiny ganache. Because I had leftovers, I put that in the fridge for a couple of hours, then took spoonfuls, rolled them in more cocoa and served them as truffles. Double win!

This recipe was perfect for my needs! I halved the recipe and whipped it to frosting for my parisian macarons. I found that it was easier to freeze my chocolate and just used a grater over my scale to get the correct measurement. So simple! I don't know about people claiming that its bitter but I made sure to use a 60% bar. It worked for me. Thank you!

Easiest recipe EVER! You can't screw it up & can do a million variations with it. White.chocolate subs really well, especially on devils food cake. It you chill the ganache you can also then beat it into a frosting. So delicious!

This is the best ganache!  I used it on cupcakes...the shine, the taste...just awesome.  I had enough to dip them twice. Turn them upside down, dip and twist..super easy. I'm a good baker and my friends still thought they were bought from a bakery!!

I tried this with bakers premium dark chocolate and it did not work at all! Gross! 

I tried it again with Callebut Bittersweet Chocolate Wafers and added 1 Tablesppon corn syrup after it was melted together and it was shiny and delicious! Do not add corn syrup if using for truffles! I also did not add the rum or flavouring.

what a great recipe! it's very easy to follow and it came out perfect the first time i tried it. the mixture cools off slowly and therefore leaves you enough time to decorate the cake. this recipe is definitly a keeper and i'll make it again.

I made it without the rum and it still turned out great. Super easy to make and very delicious! I made it with Ghiradelli bittersweet chips but I also plan to try it with 9 oz of Cadbury's milk chocolate.

Love this recipe - super easy and is great to dip brownie bites in or to pour over a cake.  Bittersweet chocolate makes it delicious without being too sweet.  Will use over and over again.

This was beautiful, and so easy. I used bittersweet chocolate, and the nice thing about this is, you heat the cream, not the chocolate, so there's no burned taste. This will replace my chocolate buttercream recipe. Thanks for a great ganache!

So easy and decadent!  I iced my husband's dark chocolate birthday cake with this. Instead of brandy, I added a few shots of maple syrup to balance out the bitterness of the 85% dark chocolate that I used.  I let the ganache sit for about 20 minutes in the fridge before frosting the cake and the consistency was perfect after I whisked it a little.  I melted some of the leftover ganache in the microwave to pour over ice cream (delicious!).  A chocoholics dream...:)

Once the first batch seized on me and I had to discard, the second batch came out perfect. As previously mentioned, even 1 drop of water on your whisk will cause this to seize. The perfect batch was glossy and delicious. I let it cool, whipped it to fluffy perfection and iced chocolate cupcakes for a Halloween party. I made as written. Am looking forward to making a cheesecake and pouring the smooth, unwhipped ganache over it for an elegant Christmas dessert.

Excellent!!! I made the One Bowl Chocolate Cake III from this site for the first time (which by the way is a delicious recipe!!)I didnt have enough bittersweet so I used 6oz bittersweet, 2 oz semi sweet. I covered with the ganache and then refridgerated. I whipped up the remaining into an icing (I would have to say I was skeptical it would whip up nicely but it did). Then topped the cake with dollops of whipped ganache with a strawberry in each one. Seriously, the whipped ganache was SOOOOOOO good...I rarely lick the mixer blades but today I did!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

This is an extremely easy recipe, I used it when I was a beginner & am now in business and will continue to use it, modify it... just make sure you do this in advance and give it time to cool if you want to use it as a filling or whip it.   THANK YOU for posting this great recipe!

Easy and delicious!  Left out the rum because I didn't have any.  Thickly covered a single layer 8" cake with about a cup left over so I think it could easily do a 2 layer cake.  But it was so rich, a single layer cake was a decadent treat.

This is so easy and I give it a 5+ stars. I made a dense chocolate cake and made this ganache to go with it...wow was it phenomenal! Gotta try this. The only variation was I used Malibu Rum and used shredded coconut in between cake layers and on top of ganache! Delish!

This was perfect and not as sweet as it looks. I DID used bittersweet chocolate (Ghirardelli) as recommended and I'm glad I did. It wasn't too rich at all. DID NOT use Rum. However, I WILL say the amount in this recipe is MORE than enough for one bundt cake. I had A LOT of unused left over. Yummy and I will be making it again.

This was amazing! I added more chocolate to make it a little thicker, but my husband and I loved it! I topped a Black Magic cake with it, and oh my gosh! I'll never use another ganache recipe. :)

I like to add black sambuca to the cream before it boils.

SO easy.  Virtually idiot proof (I should know!), silky, delicious, and versatile-- my son even ate bits of it like chocolate candy, after the leftovers had chilled in the fridge.  I've used this recipe many times and it never has failed me!

Yummy! This was super easy to make. I did not use rum. I drizzled it over a chocolate bundt cake. The ganache made it look fancy. It makes alot and I had lots left over. I will find something to do with it - maybe drizzle over vanilla ice cream.

Super easy to make. If you like dark chocolate it's an A+. I myself am more of a milk chocolate fan so I'll try this again with a different form of chocolate. However, it looks really pretty on the cake I put it on and my girlfriends love dark chocolate so it was a hit.

Absolutely fabulous!!  I whipped it, once cooled to use as a filling for my daughter's birthday cake.  Couldn't resist a taste and it blew my socks off!  use the best chocolate you can find.  I live in a small town, so I'm limited, but I used Swiss bittersweet and it was fantastic!

TOP NOTCH!!! I used vanilla instead of rum and followed the directions and used bitter sweet chocolate- it was good, but for what i wanted it for, semi sweet would have been better. BUT, its still very much a 5 star recipe- hands down, this is GOOD stuff!!! I used it to cover the black magic cake from this site and I used the fluffy peanut butter frosting recipe as the filling for the cake- it was SOOOOO GOOD! Thanks for the recipe.

Have made this recipe numerous times. Superb.  I left out the rum thing though.  Recently, tried whipping it up per recipe's instructions.  Simply awesome!  Easy to apply onto my chocolate cake and received many compliments on my effort.  Thanks Ingrid! ***MUAH***

This is the most wonderful icing!  Yummy!  I used Dove dark chocolate bars and 1 tbsp Grand Marnier and 1 tbsp Amaretto liquors instead of the rum. I drizzled some over my thoroughly cooled bundt cake (Dark Chocolate Cake II from this site), then refrigerated it, drizzled more, then back to the fridge, again and again about 8 times until it seemed to have sufficient chocolate icing and it was hardened enough to be very pretty.  (I had to microwave the unused icing for about 10 seconds before drizzling each time.)  For the same cake I also prepared a white/coconut icing using 1 big bar of Lindt white chocolate and a bit less than 2 bars Lindt white/coconut, plus 1 tbsp coconut rum.  It didn't harden as well as the chocolate icing but it was delicious.  When drizzling as explained above, I drizzled the chocolate, then the white, then the chocolate, then the white, etc.  Very pretty to have the white AND the chocolate.  Not a cheap cake to make for hubby's work, but aaahhh, the compliments!  Thanks for this recipe!!!

Amazing recipe. I actually use a little big less chocolate sometimes and whip it with powdered sugar for a killer fudge frosting. Try it with GrandMarnier and orange zest or candied orange peels as garnish - you'll love it! My other favorite is to use Amaretto in it, pour it between cake layers for a filling and then make truffles out of the rest (cool it or freeze until just barely soft and roll in cocoa powder) and use them to garnish the plate along with slivered or sliced almonds

So simple. Although I enjoyed the directions from the Martha Stewart recipe better. For instance Bittersweet Chocolate or semisweet may be used for this recipe. Also once you pour the hot cream over the chocolate bits let it stand for 10 minutes.  Then stir until combined. So easy and so good! 

Added it to my perfect Brownie recipe. Fabulous!

This is an excellent recipe and very easy.  As a note, I modified this for a lighter chocolate frosting by using 2 cups of heavy cream and 9 oz. of semi-sweet chocolate.  When it was cool, I  whipped it (refrigerated it a little first)and there was more than enough to frost and decorate a torte-style cake.  Best of all--not too sweet!

If you want a decadent frosting try this.
double the recipe. then whip half the ganache til thickened and lighter in color and use to fill the cake. Then assemble the layers and chill. Keep remainder of ganache warm as the filled cake firms. Put cake on a rack over a baking pan and pour some on the top. Using a flat spatula, start sealing the crumbs in with a "skim coat" (very light layer of ganache). Let that firm slightly, then pour more on and gently make sure all surfaces are well coated with the yumminess. Garnish with whipped cream and fresh fruit! You now have the most wonderful icing imaginable and probably lots left over to ice cupcakes, etc with!

This is wonderful and so easy to make!  I made 2 batches and whipped one into a mousse.  I cut an angelfood cake into 3 layers, put a layer of raspberry jam and mousse between layers of cake and then poured the ganache over the entire cake after assembled. Drizzled melted white chocolate all over and topped with chopped nuts and whole raspberries. What a hit!

worked beautifully!!  I did vanilla instead of the rum (I wasn't sure if all guest would have liked the flavor) and added a bit of freshly brewed coffee to inhance the flavor of the chocolate.  I made this in a massive quanity as I was making a cake to serve 100+ people and it still worked well.

This is my first ganache and it was sooo easy - and super yummy.  I poured it over a cheesecake that had browned a little too much - yum.  I used Kahula and coffee instead and it worked well.

I used this recipe for a ladies luncheon - I used it to cover a standard chocolate sponge cake. I also used it to coat the layers of the cake. Many compliments. Many thanks!

I read this recipe over 3 times, it was hard for me to believe it would be so simple! But, I tried it and for this first timer it turned out fantastic and tasty. My crew do not like bittersweet chocolate so I used good quality semi sweet chocolate chips (1 1/2 c.) and I live in the country so my choice for the cream was liquid whipping cream. With even these differences it turned out wonderfully and my peeps all think I'm a genius! I can make ganache, whoopee!

Absolutely incredible!!! Made as instructed and it is THE chocolate topping/frosting/icing recipe to go to. Perfect pared with a not-so-sweet chocolate cake like Dark Chocolate Cake II on this site. CAUTION: have glass of cold milk on hand with this one :)

This was divine!  First time I made ganache, and it was so easy.  I used 3/4 cup heavy cream and 1 and a quarter bar of Ghirardelli dark chocolate espresso bar, that I broke into small pieces using my food processor.  Used the ganache to top a chocolate espresso cheesecake, and it was perfect!

This recipe also works great in the microwave, I make it that way all the time.  Combine the cream and chocolate (I generally use semi-sweet chips) in a micro-waveable bowl and heat it on high until the chips melt.  I think I usually do about 2 minutes, then take out and stir well; put back in for 30 second increments until all melted, smooth and glossy.  Then I add vanilla extract.  I make all the cakes for my office for birthdays, and every time I use ganache on one, I get raves.

Just gorgeous, used it to top a chocolate cake, its great as a sauce over profiteroles and once cooled it can be made into yummy truffles - I had some Tia Maria lurking in the cupboard and that worked well as an alcohol addition. I used semi sweet chocolate chips as thats all I had. Spare sauce kept in a jar in the fridge - its good warmed and poured over ice cream.

I followed the recipe directions but it came out grainy.  It must be my fault but I don't know what I did.   Easy to follow directions and good flavor for someone who prefers dark to mild chocolate.

I used this to top the French Chocolate Cake recipe I made and it was a big hit. It was very easy to make and it turned out well, although I melted the chocolate before adding it to the cream, which may have helped prevent any clumps forming. I can't wait to try making it into frosting.

I whipped this up and used as frosting.  Next time I will reduce the amount of chocolate.  Tastes excellent.  Very rich and chocolately.  I will try it as a ganache on a bunt cake.

Makes any dessert you make look fancy! Poured this baby over my 'Too Much Chocolate Cake' recipe..what a winning combo! Turned out shiny and came out a perfect consistency, plus it was so easy to make. After I poured it over the cake, my friend and I noticed it was really bitter so I was worried. But the recipient didn't complain, he loved everything!

Very easy and a nice touch to the peanut butter pies I made, used bittersweet chips as the pies were already very sweet and rich, came out great.  I halved the recipe and it was just enough to put a nice thin layer over two pies.  Sets up well in the fridge.

Great Simple recipe! I used 60% bittersweet chocolate chips because I love dark, rich chocolate and this was perfect. Sure the heavy whipping cream is a bit unhealthy, but if you pour it on a cake recipe that doesn't use butter, as i did, its not half bad!

Lovely recipe. Easy, fast and tasty. though a bit runny for my liking.  so for those who like a bit thick add less cream. I also find dark chocolate much better than milk chocolate.

I never dreamed that Ganache could be so incredibly simple.  My better half wanted a triple chocolate cake for his birthday.  I love ganache and researched alot of recipes.  I finally decided on this one.  It was amazing.  I made two recipes one I put in fridge and used as a filling.  The second i poured over the top.  I also made a small amount with white chocolate to drizzle over the top for decoration.  It was a huge hit and will be made at many birthdays to come.

Excellent recipe - I used one entire bag of semi sweet chocolate chips (which was 12 oz) and crushed them to tiny pieces in my food processor.  Since I used more chocolate, I also increased the heavy cream to 1 1/2 cups.  The recipe worked out beautifully!  I would definitely recommend trying this one out.  Next time I will try to beat it into a fluffy frosting as suggested by other users as well.

Quick, easy and delicious.  I used this for cupcake filling.  The key was to let it sit until completely cooled before attempting to whip it to a frosting. I put it in a pastry bag with the appropriate tip and filled each cupcake perfectly.  It was a huge hit! Anyone can make!

This was way better than I expected. It was exactly what I wanted! I put a little triple sec in but not enough to give it any real orange taste. Maybe try more next time, but it was awsome just the chocolate. I chilled it, then allowed to return to room temp-ish until it was spreadable. I spread it all over cake and chilled again, then decorated with butter cream.   This is definitely as good as the chocolate you use, so don't be too cheap there.

This recipe was delicious! And so easy to make too! I was intimated to make a ganache at first, but this recipe made it so simple. Instead of rum, I put peppermint extract into my ganache and poured it over "Best Brownies" from this website. It made the brownies taste like York Peppermint Patties! Soooo Good! I will definitely be using this recipe again!

This recipe was a life saver! My son's birthday fell on Memorial Day weekend and going to the store was out of the question. I didn't have the heavy cream so I found a substitute of 3/4 c milk and 1/3 c butter melted. I used semi sweet chips so I would not have to chop up the chocolate. It was a great thin coating for the choc cake I made. The more it cooled the more it thickened until it looked like the filling of trufuls!! Yum Yum! Thanks again!

I made this with high quality semi sweet morsels, and used raspberry liquor as I didn't have dark run on hand. I also didn't have heavy cream, so I made a substitute: 3/4 cup of milk and 1/3 stick of melted butter. Came out perfect!

I don't know how you could give this anything other than 5 stars.  It couldn't be more simple, and it is a classic.  It takes well to alterations.  I use dark chocolate chips for these, since no one sees the difference, and I don't need to chop anything.  A 250g bag is a third of an ounce short of 9 oz and does a great job.  To make sure I don't end up with any bits of unmelted chocolate, I strain it twice.  It's definitely worth the time.  Oh, and did I mention that when you whip it, it's like chocolate mousse frosting?  Heaven!

I was one of those people who thought making ganache was way out of my league. This recipe is so easy and so insanely delicious. I whipped the ganache when cooled into a filling that I used in thumbprint cookies, just as a change from the usual jam filling. I got such rave reviews that I will use this from now on, whenever I need any type of chocolate filling. Simply fabulous. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is wonderful! I was making ganache for the first time to go over chocolate cupcakes that I made for a baby shower, and they were an absolute hit! I omitted the rum because there is never alcohol in my house, but it came out really good. I think next time I might tory and experiment with some almond extract.

This ganache was so easy to make, it tasted delicious, and worked beautifully! I used it to cover a mocha truffle bombe dessert. The extra ganche can be chilled, and it becomes like a frosting that can be piped beautifully.  It looked gorgeous and tasted great! I will definately make this ganache again!

OH. MY. GOSH. This recipe was so extremely simple AND delicious, I don't get it! LOL! The only substitutions I made was to use 1 1/4 c semi-sweet chocolate chips, and that was because that's what I had on hand, and I didn't add rum (I'm pregnant). It still turned out delicious! I wasn't expecting much, but I got a wonderful go-to frosting/ganache recipe! I even took the other reviewers advice and beat the ganache (once it cooled to room temp.) with my electric hand mixer for 10 minutes and got such a wonderful frosting for my chocolate cake! Definitely better than any pre-made  frosting I've had, and honestly, comparable to all the choco ganache desserts I've had in restaurants! In a nutshell, EXCELLENT!

Quick and easy. Used half and half instead of heavy cream and a mixture of bittersweet and semisweet chocolate. I refrigerated it, whipped it, and then spread most of it between the layers of Dark Chocolate Cake II from this site. The rest I ate straight out of the bowl.

This was good. I played around with the ingredients a bit and made some improvements. I am getting some laughs from all the 1 star reviews. Are you people  morons? If it's bitter, then just change the type of chocolate you're using, not whine about it online like a little  head. If you don't like bittersweet, then use milk chocolate and add a bit more to help with consistency issues. I'm no chef, but I feel like Gordon Ramsey at Amy's Baking Company.

WOW!  Decadant is the word that best describes this!  I use semi sweet chocolate chips and no rum.  I used this to cover cream puffs and the remainder to dip strawberries in.  Sooo easy but sooo worth it. Thanks for a great recipe.

I didn't follow the directions entirely, which is why it became a kitchen fixer-upper, but in the end it worked out. I figured I would share my experience. In the event that you buy the POWDERED bittersweet cocoa because it is more economical on the wallet, just remember powder doesn't melt like bar chocolate. But do not fear, all is not lost! Just add 2 cups of heavy cream, a small can of sweetened condensed milk (really helps to sweeten it up), and a few splashes of low-fat milk (whatever you have on hand) and stir it up with a spoon over low heat until the heaping glob of chocolate thins out. The benefit is the chocolate will harden and has a glossy look to it, so it makes it ideal for chocolate dipped cookies. It works out well when you get past the initial panic.

I liked the flavor of this a lot..typical ganache recipe except I think I expected more of a firm ganache.  But even based on the 1 cup cream to 9 ounces of chocolate chips, I should have known better! Not the recipes fault.  Next time if I want a more firm ganache, Ill scale back on the cream and add more chips.

I made this last night and poured it over my coconut cupcakes. The cupcakes tasted like an Almond Joy! I didn't have rum but will make sure to use it next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I now use ganache all of the time in place of icing.  It is so much easier, and I would imagine, healthier.  I don't dirty two pans; instead, I bring the cream to a boil, shut off the heat and then add the chocolate to the cream.  It's always a little scary, because it doesn't seem like it will incorporate, but it does if you chop the chocolate up.  Then, if making cupcakes, I just dip them into the pot, let them set up, and then I can pipe a small flower on the top, and it is elegant. My recipe is even easier: equal measure of cream to chocolate, so if I get a pint of cream, then I chop up 16 oz of chocolate.  Any leftovers go into a pan which I refrigerate, slice into cubes and then I have "truffles" to eat!  They last a good long time, too.  I've been able to stretch it out over two weeks.

Its fantastic, however it was quite bitter so I added about 1/2 tbs of powdered sugar, and also added vanilla as well as rum.

Excellent taste. The process of getting the ganache just the right consistency for my purpose I am still working on, but really, not as scary to make as I thought. Thanks for the recipe.

Super easy and super delicious! Per another user's suggestion, I raised the cake a bit off of a cooling rack, and placed tin foil underneath the cake. When I poured the ganache on, all the extra just fell down on the foil, so cleanup was really easy.

I followed the directions exctly, but mine came out a little granulated-looking. It was never really glossy smooth like some of the photos. Not sure why, but I was disappointed. The flavor, though, was fantastic.

I made this as the inside layer frosting of a three tiered cake and used the splash of rum option as well as just chocolate chips.  It was amazing.  I let it cool a bit until it was spreadable consistency and then chilled it with the cake.  Upon cutting the cake it was still a bit too cool so the ganache broke when cutting it.  But the next day when the cake was completely room temperature it was the perfect fudge-like consistency I was hoping for! Very good, versatile and easy!

I made this ganache to cover a double layer brownie "cake" I made for my best friend's 30th birthday party. People exclaimed at the party (and even after) that it was THE best cake they'd ever had. I owe it all to this ganache. It's that good.  I'm making it again to top a peanut butter cake for my brother's birthday.

A bit of chocolate heaven.  Hard to mess this one up as a filling and topping; it covered without having to spread it.  I had the chocolate ready in a bowl so as soon as the cream boiled, I poured and stirred; I just kept stirring as it didn't smooth out right away. (plus I needed to test it by taking a little taste now and then to see how smooth it was...) I skipped the rum and opted for Hershey's special dark chips.  I can't believe I messed up baking a jelly roll cake, but I did. So, I pieced it together flat, covered it with a layer of ganache, rolled it up and then covered the whole roll with the ganache and refrigerated it.  No one could tell that it was a mutational jelly roll.  Ganache covers a multitude of sins!

easy and delicious.  I had a hard time mixing it into a fluffy frosting.  It never got fluffy after seveal minutes of mixing, so I gave up.  Delicious in a chocolate and ice cream layered cake.  Also, dipped some oreos in it- took a while to harden, but not too sweet.

I have used this twice now and both times it has been a snap to put together and work with!  Yesterday I made it to go on the Black Magic Cake for DH's birthday.  I kept it in it's regular form to spread between the layers as my filling for my 9" round cakes, and then I whipped the rest of it to frost the top and sides of the cake.  SO SO SO good!  I used a mixture of both semi sweet and bittersweet square (that's what I had on hand) and vanilla extract and it was DELICIOUS!  I cannot say enough about this ganache.  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe!

This is soooo good it almost didn't even make it to the cake. I was tempted to just hide in the closet with it and a spoon, lol. I've followed the recipe exact and aslo subbed chips for the chopped chocolate, and both ways are just amazing. GOOD STUFF!!

Excellent recipe, easy to make. However, if using for cake topping, only use about half this recipe, as it will be too much and spill over the sides of the cake!

I used this for chocolate covered strawberries and it was awesome! We ran out of strawbwerries so cut up bananas to make chocolate covered bananas and they were great too. I didn't have any rum though, but was still great, hubby couldn't wait, he dipped and ate. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Btw, I used a name brand 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate baking chips, no trouble melting, just whisked them with the cream, no problem.

Perfect ganache!!  I used 1/2 Tbsp. vanilla in place of the dark rum.  This set up beautifully over buttercream and was remarkably easy with which to work.  Oh yeah, it tasted divine too!

The taste and texture are terrific. But my ganache usually separates from the cake when I slice it. Is there a remedy for this?

Yummy Ganache! I have been making cakes for 10 years now and love a good ganache. This is a great simple one anyone can make. I made it 3 times in 2 weeks. Filled all my cakes with it and iced and whipped it to make a boarder for another. I didn't use the rum cause I had kids and other picky eaters and I couldn't get bittersweet chocolate at the store (I live in a rural area) so I used semisweet chocolate chips cause thats what I had. I think I let it cool a little too much for the cake I wanted to pour it over. I had iced the cake in buttercream and I just wanted it smooth on top and dripping over the sides. It didn't drip so I ended up smoothing it over the whole cake. It looked great and I whipped up some for boarders. Everyone loved this and cause I used it on 3 cakes I had about 30 different taste tasters to tell me. Thanks again, makes a great filling and I will be trying these on some chocolate petit fours in the future. I will edit and let you know how it turns out. I also took pics but they are to big to add to this site and not sure how to resize them to fit.

Seriously amazing! Last time I made ganache it was the most intensive process ever and did not come out as well as this easy recipe. Once it was whisked I set it in the freezer for about 5 minutes and the texture was perfect and it tastes delicious.

This ganache was so easy to make!  I bake cakes all the time and sell them, but had never tried ganache until I got a cake order with ganache filling.  I trusted that this recipe was good based on the reviews, and indeed, it was.  I actually used 1/2 bittersweet and 1/2 milk chocolate because after trying it first with just bittersweet, I thought it was a little too bitter.  Once I mixed the two, it was perfect.  I will definitely be using this recipe in the future!  Thanks!

Absolutely decadent!! I used this with the Black Magic Cake from AR. Made a two layer cake and for the filling added 1/4 cup powdered sugar and let my mixer whip on high for a good 10minutes. Came out light and fluffy...Perfect!

I can't believe how AWESOME this ganache is!  I made 1/2 the recipe and used 1 bar (4 oz) of Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate and 1/2 a cup of heavy whipping cream.  I recommend stirring your cream while it's boiling to avoid getting that weird skin.  After I poured it onto my chocolate, I waited a few seconds before whisking it.  It was shiny, delicious, and I used it on the Black Magic Cake cupcakes I made.  My whole family was raving about the ganache and I felt so accomplished.  It was like a milestone in my baking career for sure.  Maybe next time I'll try a white chocolate or a sweeter chocolate.  Anyways, this is the REAL DEAL.  Simple and it sounds so professional to say, "I made a ganache!"

I've made this several times with semi-sweet chocolate and no rum (or vanilla) and it always comes out perfectly! I usually set aside a small portion and whip it with a whisk until it lightens in color and becomes fluffy and creamy. I use that portion as icing between my cake layers. This ganache goes especially well with the Black Magic Cake on this site.

Used it as a filling for a 9 inch layer cake. I used bitter-sweet and wish I would have used semi-sweet. For a filling, I let chill for two hours and then whipped with my hand mixer. I wanted a thin layer of filling, but this gave too much for a two layer cake. Maybe next time I will need to spread it between four layers. Also, once I put my cake in the fridge the filling got really hard, not creamy. Maybe because it shouldn't be refridgerated? I'm not sure. First time making.

I'm not sure, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong thing, but my ganache never really set up on my cake. I followed the recipe minus the rum but I couldn't get it to really harden like I wanted it to. It was delicious though and did make the cake seem extra special so I'd probably do it again.

Top notch recipe. Instead of the liquor, I add raspberry extract and it gives a wonderful extra flavor. Just keep adding the raspberry till you get the desired flavor, it usually requires the entire small bottle of the extract. With the raspberry its also great to then use it for truffles.

I have never made ganache, or frosting for that matter, and it was wonderful!  So easy!  After following the very simple directions the ganache came out perfectly rich and silky...but I wanted a fluffy frosting so I put it in the fridge for a little bit and when whipped it up.  It turned out so light and fluffy!  I couldn't stop eating it....I will never buy chocolate frosting again when I can just make this!  I think I will also experiment with it by adding peanut butter or vanilla or mint or something.

yes, this is the best.. earlier i was afraid of ganache, but this one is very easy, I used semi sweet choco chips, powdered them in a blender and then poured cream over it. Spread very easily on my cake and looks amazing.

Unbelievably easy, unbelievably good. After reading so many reviews saying chocolate is too bitter, I didn't even bother with the bitter chocolate, just used 9 oz of semisweet. Chopped the  chocolate into fine bits in the food processor before pouring the boiled cream over it. Very easy to get it smooth that way. I let ganache sit in frig for 30 mins before whipping it to make petit four filling. Fabulous. I know I will make this recipe over and over. I used the 1 tablespoon of rum. I also put rum in the chocolate glaze for the petit fours--I feared it would be too rum-like but it wasn't--just perfect.

I'm giving a three because it may be user error, but I could NOT get this to work.  I followed the directions exactly and was so disappointed with how things turned out.  It poured okay, but as I spread the ganache and it drizzled down the sides in clumps almost, and did not stick to the cake at all.  I did have it frosted, as I've had it like that before-could have been the problem?  Also, it looked really greasy.

Simple, simple, simple! Used it as a frosting, so I let it sit in the fridge for a while before whipping it the rest of the way. Tastes AMAZING!

Super easy, fast and wonderful! I used Nestlé baking chocolate (the kind they sell in bar form here in France) as it was what I had on hand, but I could also see ramping it up with Valrhona or other luxury chocolate. 

I used this in two forms to decorate a round cake I had frosted with orange-tinted buttercream icing to make a jack o'lantern. After icing the cake and chilling to firm, I chilled the ganache for approximately 1/2 hour, then spooned some into a baggie to chill longer. By snipping a tiny hole off the baggie corner, I used it to pipe eyes, nose and mouth, filling in with more ganache. Then I whipped the remaining ganache (note: definitely chill first!) for about 3 minutes or so until it was light brown and fluffy, then used a piping bag to pipe on a pumpkin stem. I used the remaining ganache to fill another cake. This was really wonderful!

Not sure what to think.  Tried to whip part of it for frosting and it never got very firm, the rest of the ganache never seemed firm up as much as I would have liked either.  I used good quality cream and high quality semi sweet chocolate and followed the recipe so I'm not sure what happened.  On the up side, it's quick, easy and tasted good.  All and all, I didn't have a pretty cake but I did have a delicious cake.

Maybe semi-sweet chocolate would be a better choice instead of bittersweet chocolate.

WOW!  I needed a quick recipe for a chocolate bundt cake and stumbled on this one... OMG, it was simple, tasty and quick to make... I added orange extract instead of the recommended rum extract, it was DELICIOUS, I'm anxious to try other flavored extracts.

Wow, I had no idea it could be so simple to make a cake look that flawless!  I made two chocolate cakes and iced one as the recipe suggests (though I omitted the rum and added a hint of vanilla instead) which was a HUGE hit, and I made another version of this recipe using oat milk instead of heavy cream (for a vegan friend) and it was PERFECT!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I wanted to experiment for christmas, so I made this recipe.  The texture and shine came out just as expected, but the taste was different for me.  I'm used to sweet flavors not bitter ones.  I think I used too much bitter-sweet chocolate.  Next time I'll cut down on the bitter-sweet.  Other than that, it was very good.

Very easy, very pretty, very tasty! I let the chips sit covered in hot cream for 5 min before stirring  and then didn't let it cool further before putting it on the cake- it was perfect and hardened so shiny! This recipe is a keeper!

Comes out perfectly every time.  I find that it is a great "base" recipe and very forgiving.  I often omit the rum and just go with super dark dark chocolate (60% and higher) it is enough intensity.  Also, I have used this as a base for truffle centers.  I find that if I leave herbs to steep in the cream or even boil them in it, a very delicious and special desert can be made - people will never expect it from the home cook!  I have had wonderful success with lavender and rosemary.

Simple and elegant - can't mess it up.  Really dressed up a plain cheesecake.  Will try on chocolate cake.  Should have waited till it thickened more before I poured (made a bit of a mess) but now I know.

O MY GOD... This was so simple and so beautifully yummy! I use no less that 70% cocoa chocolate in all my cooking and it really makes a difference in the flavour. I used this to pour over a lovely chocolate fridge cake that i make with chocolate biscuits and cream... it was like eating pure sin... i had at least 10 requests from people at work for the recipe!

Yum, yum, yum!  I used whipping cream and three different types of chocolate, cooled in the fridge and whipped with a mixer to make the inner frosting for a three-layer cake, then made another batch using only dark and bittersweet chocolate.  Cooled that in the fridge and then poured it over the cake... got rave reviews!

This recipe is great and foolproof! After cooling and whisking it was perfect for icing cupcakes. I added some coffee & coffee liqueur (instad of rhum) to half of it for mocha cupcakes.
I look forward to making it again and trying out some of its other uses.

Very easy, very yummy.  I made two batches.  One batch I added just under a tablespoon of mint extract in place of the rum, put it in the fridge for about 15 minutes to cool down and whipped (with a mixer) into a frosting.  The other batch I made with just the chocolate and cream and poured over the mint-frosted cake.  The cake turned out wonderful.  It was a HUGE hit!  Thank you!

This is a great recipe for ganache.  Drizzles beautifully over a chocolate angel food cake.  I didn't have bittersweet chocolate so I used 7 or 8 oz of semisweet and a square of baker's unsweetened and it turned out perfect.  Garnished with some shaved chocolate curls immediately after pouring over the cake made a great presentation.

Beautiful and yummy.  This time poured it over a cake and sprinkled powdered sugar on it.  Very fancy looking!  (When I can't drive to the bigger grocery store, I just use Hershey's Special Dark chocolate bars and chop them.)

This is the perfect chocolate icing! I couldnt find bittersweet chocolate anywhere and found this substitute: 9oz of semi-sweet chocolate plus 2 1/4 tsp unsweetened cocoa.  Worked like a charm.   I poured enough over my cake to cover and then let the rest cool down and whipped it into icing.  Its amazing as whipped icing!

3 11 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/33647/chocolate-ganache/ ... Wow.  I'd "heard of" ganache & how it was made.  I thought it would be too dark, intense, heavy.  Yes, rich.  Warm, it's smooth & easy.  Cooler, cold, it's rich & thick.  It's the same "strength" as chocolate chip cookies.  :D  I chopped 1 1/2c semisweet chocolate chips. Okay, almost 1 1/2cups.  About 3T were milk chocolate.  I cooled for about twenty minutes then spooned it over cheesecake topped brownies.  Stayed shiny (beautiful) & had just a little bit of "give".  Fabulous.  Who knew?  Not me.  :)

Best and easiest ganache I have ever made! It makes quite a bit and so I use the extra to fold into the whip cream and made some amazing mousse.

I made this to go with the Too Much Chocolate bundt cake on this site. I used the Ghiradelli 60% bittersweet chips (full bag) as another user suggested but didn't add the rum. Was AWESOME and it did not need butter to make it shiny.  Next time I will halve the recipe as that was enough to cover the entire cake.

I made this to pour over the Crazy Cake that I made for Easter dessert(recipe also on this site).  I used Gharardelli bittersweet chocolate chips.  OMG it was SO good, and I am quite the chocoholic!  Everyone loved it!  It was also easy to make.  Highly recommended!

Simple. Wonderful. I used coffee liqueur instead of rum to pair with a dark chocolate and toasted hazelnut cake. Just bitter enough to offset the sweet cream I put between the layers. For the reviewers who had trouble with this one turning out oily, not setting, etc: the quality of chocolate makes a huge difference. I don't want to mention any brand names, but with so few ingredients, if you use crappy store brand stuff that's mostly cocoa butter, you won't get a nice, smooth finish or ganache that performs as well.

This is a great, simple recipe. I used bittersweet chocolate, no liquor and used to frost cupcakes. I was unsure if the chocolate would be too bitter, but I had cream filled cupcakes so it offset it nicely.

Yes I agree, rich  dark chocolate. I used this on a peace offering cake and a greek cheesecake. I loved it and so did everyone else. I also made my own mini cheesecakes with a hint of orange cognac.

Really good and really easy ganache recipe. Don't let it cool too long or it will be too thick to pour easily. Spread leftovers between two graham crackers, put in freezer and you have great little treats for kids.

I've made ganache before, but this recipe was the easiest & best. I used Captain Morgan's spiced rum which added just a hint of flavor. Next time I'll try Chambord (raspberry liqueur). Can't wait!

I've used the recipe twice already. Once for my husband's birthday. Before I get into it, I would like to mention that I have found a way to make this chocolate ganache into the BEST frosting I have ever tasted! Instead of just bittersweet chocolate, I try to get as close as I possibly can to a 50/50 split of dark chocolate and bittersweet. The dark chocolate makes it thicker, but for any serious chocolate lover, it's heaven! I made a layered Devil's food cake (the hubby LOVES chocolate). I used 1 Tbs Malibu Black Coconut Rum, let it cool until thick, then whipped to use it as frosting. First I filled the cake, then with the remaining frosting I folded in some whipped heavy cream to give the frosting a lighter color and texture...then coated the cake with shredded coconut...it was amazing! I just used this recipe again for my step-father's 60'th birthday last night. We invited 60 people to this mega-surprise birthday party so I had to make a huge cake. Like my husband, he loves chocolate so I came back to this recipe and made it again, but I didn't have any rum this time so I just did a straight ganache. I had a 2" thick 12x18" layered sheet cake to make so I had to multiply the recipe by 5 (LOTS of frosting!), then let it cool and whipped it. Like I said, he loves chocolate, so I did Devil's food cake again. All 60 of his guests loved this cake! And it's so easy! Next will be a yellow cake w/ lemon white chocolate ganache topped with coconut.

This is a super easy, rich, and delicious icing. I used Lindt 70% cocoa dark chocolate and spread the frosting on a nearly flourless chocolate cake and it was heaven for chocolate lovers! Will definitely make again.

This recipe was wonderful the SECOND time I made it. DO NOT ADD RUM! When I added the rum the first time, the ganache broke and I had an oily mess. So, at 11:00 at night I had to go out to buy more chocolate and cream. It got great reviews, though!

Very Tasty. I left mine in the fridge for too long and it got a little harder than I would have liked it too. I tried to fix it by adding more cream... but it's best just to use it after it has been in the fridge for a short period than try to correct it.

I would rate this a 5 but I had so much left over, some it went to waste. The first batch I coated a double batch of cream puffs and had about twice what I needed. The second time I made a three layer boston cream cake and still had about half left over. Left overs can be warmed up and poured over ice cream (YUM!) Aside from the amount this makes it is easy to make and taste great. It seems runny at first, but firms up nicely.

This ganache was amazing!  I took it to a party and it served about 20 people I would say... maybe less? We sliced the pieces fairly thin so more could go around, but it was a very rich cake and this "icing" is very satisfying.  I used 1 shot of espresso in place of rum, whipping cream, and ghirardelli chocolate chips from the store (not the entire bag).  Let it cool slightly and poured over a cooled "Chocolate Oil Cake" (from this website)- Very simple! Also, there was about 1/3 cup leftover.  I saved it in my fridge and am planning on re-melting and dipping strawberries in later...

Absolutely amazing! I whipped the first batch for the filling, layered with strawberry jam for some extra flavor. Then i draped the second batch on top of the three layers. Delicious!

Turned out great,.... I did use semi sweet chocolate chips and I added a few drops of Raspberry extract to it....  Sooo good.    I put it over  a chocolate cake with Raspberry cream cheese icing filling.

Delicious!!!!! So easy too. The only things I changed were that I used semi-sweet chocolate squares rather than bittersweet & I melted the chocolates squares in the microwave (only takes like 2 minutes) rather than chopping. Watch carefully, my chocolate burnt the 1st time I did it. I poured the ganache over the Chocolate Flourless Cake I recipe. Turned out nice & shiny too. I will be using this recipie again.

I love this recipe!  I didn't have any dark rum, just vanilla.  I used the vanilla rum and it still turned out fantastic.  I drizzled this on top of the chocolate cavity maker cake.  I thought they really complimented each other.  I will use the recipe again!

I've always been intimidated by ganache, so I'd never make it.  I don't know why - it was simple and tasted so great on my chocolate cake with chocolate mousse filling.  WOW!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I made this ganache for some loaded brownies and it was fabulous.  I will certainly be making this again.  I can taste it over fruit, cake, ice cream, cheesecake, etc.  Yum!  Thanks so much for sharing.

I have used this many times, so simple and so good. You can't go wrong with this, it is fool proof.  It is great to use by itself on a cheesecake or add some Heath bar crunch or peppermint.  I have to say when my cheesecakes crack ( and they do) this is my go to topping to make it look perfect!   Thanks for a great recipe !

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe! This is the first time I've tried to make Ganache (which is my favorite topping for a cake) and it turned out perfectly!!!! I didn't have cream in the house, however, so I used Bailey's instead paired with 80% cocoa dark chocolate by Lindt and left out the rum. Let me tell you, it was amazing!!! I recommend this recipe to anyone who doesn't like sweet sugary icing but loves dark chocolate. This will be a recipe I'll use for years to come. Thanks again. :)

I've never before made ganache, this was SO ridiculously easy and tastes amazing!!! I made it with Captain Morgan's spiced rum and poured it on top of a chocolate bundt cake. I got rave reviews from everyone!

Okay, RUN, do not walk towards this recipe!  I put a crumb coat of buttercream on first, and put the cake in the fridge - and I let the ganache cool to about 84 degrees.  Perfect.  My first time, too.  Thanks a ton!

So good and so easy!  I used semi-sweet bakers chocolate, because I couldn't find bittersweet and I added a splash of vanilla instead of rum.  I made it to ice a dressed-up wacky cake (in a fluted tube pan, with diced dried apricots and chocolate bits) as the cake came out of the oven.  I let the ganache cool while the cake was cooling & then spooned it on the cake while it was still on the cooling rack, with a plate under it, then transferred it to a serving platter.  My only mistake was to put the cake in the fridge, as the ganache lost its' shine.  Tasted heavenly!

So easy. I had semi sweet chunks in the house and I needed a finish for a chocolate cake with a raspberry sauce filling so All Recipes to the rescue. I put the chunks in the microwave for 30 seconds x 2 just to give it a start then I i poured the hot heavy cream over the chunks and whisked until smooth. I didn't have rum in the house so I used a scant for drops of brandy. Recipe make an ample amount of ganache. I didn't chill the cake before as I was concerned when I took it out of the fridge it would start to sweat and mar the finish. I cooled at room temperature and stayed wonderfully glossy which is what you want in a ganache. Tasted fantastic- what's not to like when you use a good chocolate. I'm not sure what the alcohol brings to the party but I didn't want to leave it out when I needed the recipe to count- taking cake to Easter dinner. Overall truly worth the 5 stars.

I used this to ice the Dark Chocolate Cake I from this site.  There was just enough to cover the three layer cake.  It was the perfect consistency and tasted great.  I used Ghirardelli 70% Cacao Extra Bittersweet Baking Bars in this recipe and I did NOT use the rum.

The taste of this ganache is heavenly.  Be a chocolate snob when it comes to what type/brand of chocolate you use for this recipe.  The better tasting chocolate is well worth the upcharge!!

I don't own a chopper/dicer, and I found it hard to chop the chocolate bars by hand. So, I melted it in a saucepan over medium heat, and then removed it from heat and added the cream. I whisked for 1-2 minutes, and there it was: Perfect ganache! I drizzled cream puffs with it, and my fiance couldn't stop raving about them!

It really is THAT easy.  Even more so when done in a KitchenAid.  Poured it over some chilled pre-cut rice krispy treats (on waxed paper) to make a special treat for my students.  Divine.  Be careful, the ganache "sweats" when left at room temperature and permanently changes the appearance of whatever it is atop.

This is SO GOOD and so easy! I left out the rum (only because I didn't have any and didn't want to hit up a liquor store..) and instead of 9 ounces bittersweet, I used 6 ounces bittersweet and 3 ounces semi-sweet Ghirardelli chocolate. I let it chill and whipped it to use as a filling for a chocolate cake and it's fabulous. This is definitely at the top of my favorite cake fillings! Someday I'll try it poured over a cake, too.

After boiling the cream and mixing it with chocolate, I refrigerated the ganache for 30 minutes and then whipped it for 5 minutes to create a wonderfully light and fluffy frosting.  I was worried at first because the ganache seemed too runny even after refrigeration, and I thought it wouldn't whip up nicely into an icing-like consistency.  But it became fluffy and suitable for frosting a cake after 5 minutes or so of beating.  This recipe doesn't produce a thick, heavy frosting (like the kind you would find in the super market); instead, the whipped ganache is light and airy.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and omitted the rum.  This is a wonderfully easy recipe, and I will use it again in the future.

Perfect. What else can I say? UPDATE: I can say more. While I love ganache, because I love things like espresso and dark chocolate. My kids are not big fans. But I still cannot imagine a ganache being more perfect than this! It is dark chocolate satiny decadence.

yummy and easy!  
I was worried this wouldn't work out for me but it did and made an excellent topping for my Black Magic Cake, made with a recipe from this website.  of note, definitely watch your heavy cream carefully on the stove, mine boiled over extremely quickly and made quite a mess!  
I whipped my cooled ganache until the color change and heaped it on top of the cake, then into the fridge to sort of solidify.  I used vanilla extract, instead of rum and milk chocolate instead of dark.  
next time I would use the whipped version as a filling and something a little lighter for topping and frosting the cake (maybe an upwhipped batch of this recipe, chocolate nirvana!).  
thanks for sharing!

This is definitely a keeper for me. I used dark chocolate (78% cocoa) and loved the result. I drizzled it over the Oreo cheesecake I made for a bbq and the bitterness of the dark chocolate complemented the richness of the cheesecake. Thanks for sharing!

way easy to make but quite bitter using bittersweet chocolate....i had to add sugar to more boiling cream and add more chocolate to doctor it up. i love dark chocolate, but this was way too much; next time i will try semisweet or a mix of milk chocolate and semisweet from the get go.  there is a difference between bittersweet, semisweet, and milk chocolate in the sugar content. i used it as frosting and it whipped up real fluffy and it frosted a two layer cake.

This was excellent ganache.  I was a little nervous about making it, however, it turned out wonderfully.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips instead of the bittersweet chocolate.  Next time I may try using milk chocolate chips.  I used the ganache on the Too Much Chocolate Cake also from this site.  It was amazing!!

Tasted amazing.  I used regular semi-sweet chocolate chips, skipped the rum; let it sit on the counter for maybe 20 mins & it was beautiful and delicious. SO easy! I accidentally nudged some off the top of my cake & plopped a little extra on, thinking I could smooth it down -- did not work out, but I turned the plop into a rose, added more "roses" and drew in stems with a toothpick.  Simple & gorgeous, got many compliments!

Easy and delicious.  You tailor the richness or sweetness by the type of chocolate you use. I used a dark bittersweet and whipped it.  It was divine!

Well I went on a limb and made this chocolate ganache for chantal's cheesecake recipe. I tasted it and it was really bitter but in combination with the richness of the cheese cake it was a perfect match.. I love this recipe. I will definitely try it on other recipes. . . . .

I used sweet vermouth instead of rum in this recipe (just because I had it and it sounded good) and it was delicious. I was worried at first that it looked too thin and would run right off the cheesecake I was coating but it turned out perfect, glossy and thick. It did make about half again as much as I needed though (for my 10 inch cheesecake); I had to restrain myself from eating the leftovers with a spoon!

So easy. As you mix the ganache, first it looks like it isn't going to combine but after just a little while perfection!
I helped some non-cooking 14 year olds make this as the topping for a cake project for school. An A project!

I was looking for a simple chocolate frosting recipe.  It can't get much easier and tasty as this one was!  I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect!

I only had a 4 oz. bar of bittersweet chocolate but I had a 1/3 bag of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and used those and it turned out fine.  It didn't dry like  I would have liked and still is a little moist about 8 hours later.  I used this ganache on individual brownie bites and decorated them w/ white stripes on top with a royal icing recipe.  The taste is phenomenal ~ kind of like mini Hostess cupcakes and they look like they came from a bakery.  I will use this recipe again because it was so tasty and easier than any frosting recipe I have ever made.

I did not use the rum, out of personal preference, but I may try that sometime too.  This was simple, especially when I found bittersweet choc chips in the grocery store!  Let it cool at room temp for about 45 minutes, then I poured it over Choc Lover's Cake from this site. This is DELICIOUS!  May try again with the rum or rasberry extract.  Also, made a beautiful satiny looking finish on my cake.  Would be excellent as a dip for fruit as well.

Delicious. Followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfectly. I've used this to ice a cake, as an ice cream topping, to make truffles, and as a drizzle over coconut macaroons. It's always perfect.

This is a very good multi-purpose base recipe for ganache.  I have used it for almost every possible application of ganache.  If you want to use the alcohol, you can always use an appropriately flavored liqueur to compliment your baked good.  I like to use Chambord (raspberry flavored liqueur) to compliment a raspberry swirled cheesecake.

Super easy!  I used semi-sweet because the bittersweet is just, well, too bitter for me.  But it was so simple to do, very quick, and I let it sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes and when I poured it on my cake (french vanilla...YUM!) it went on nice and thick.
Great recipe, will be using this a LOT!

the first ganache I have ever tried, and I felt like a rockstar!  I was always intimidated before, but now I know there is nothing to fear.  The bittersweet chocolate is the perfect foil for a sweet buttercream.  (The glossy finish totally camouflaged what may actually be a questionable cake.) 
I can't wait to make truffles with this!

I am classically trained pastry chef and a 1984 Graduate of Johnson and Wales University. I have made 1000's of ganache tortes and this recipe is simple enough for the beginner.  For the person who was disappointed because they wanted the ganache for chocolate covered strawberry's if you make this version and the strawberry are washed, dried and cold it will harden and still be delicious.  You can make this recipe and it will last weeks.  Just warm it when your ready to use  and stir with clean whisk or spoon.   This ganache recipe also makes a great chocolate truffle base.

My goodness!  What have I been missing all these years!  This is so easy, it's practically fool-proof.  I poured it over a peppermint frosted chocolate cake and voila'!  The cake disappeared!  I had to make it without the rum and it was awesome, next time trying rum or another flavoring.

I made this as a topping over a chocolate mousse cake.
I used spiced rum and also a Tbs of iced coffee. It was my first time trying such an elaborate topping and it turned out great. 

I couldn't find anything labeled "Bittersweet" chocolate at my store, but the they did have "unsweet" (100% Cacao) "Semi-sweet" (~56% Cacao) and "German Sweet" (~44% Cacao)... they were 4oz bars, so I did a bar of semi a bar of german and filled the last oz with the unsweet... it was great that way.

Big Tip:
Be sure to place the cake on a piece of parchment paper when you do the pour over so that you can scoop the gnache back up on the bare spots and make a thicker layer on top as it cools.

A. MAY. ZING! I make this ganache for a chocolate ring cake and then drizzle it across the cake, back and forth, in a clockwise manner. It presents beautifully and tastes like something from a top bakery! I also place strips of parchment paper under the bottom of the cake before drizzling the ganache and remove them when finished pouring. The plate stays perfectly clean!

Soooooooo easy!  I used a 12 oz bag of mini semi-sweet chips and upped the cream to 1 1/3 cup.  If you want to whip it to use it for frosting, don't give up!  Make sure it's completely cool & keep whipping.  I added 2 tblsp powdered sugar to sweeten it up just a little.  I used this to frost the Black Magic Cake & there was plenty to frost both layers.  Fluffy, light & super chocolatey.

Definitely super easy. I have made several times. First time, I whipped after cooled to use as cupcake filling. I have also used in between layers of chocolate cake. I have also added confectionery sugar and beaten and used as a frosting for the out side of that chocolate layer cake. I have used as the base for truffles. And have used as a quick, fun fondue for fresh fruit, graham squares and marshmallows with my family. Superb.   Thank you!!

I used 51% cocoa chocolate and added a little confectioners sugar.  As children were going to be eating the cake I left out the rum.  Perfect.

I love this!  It is so simple and so tasty.  I love that it whips up into a fluffy topping.  I used a splash of vanilla vodka since I didn't have rum and it seems perfect.

I made this this morning to top the Too Much Chocolate Chocolate Cake on this site and I must say this ganache is absolutely delicious. I used Ghirardelli 60% bitter sweet chocolate chips and it was divine. No butter needed for shine. Gonna try it with the rum next time. 

I would only use a sweeter chocolate if it was for a child's dessert and want them running around like crazy folks.

So simple and so tasty. I have made this ganache a few times, always as a topper for banana bread, and it gets great reviews!

Excellent recipe!  I even had to substitute canned evaporated milk for the heavy cream, and semi-sweet chips since I'm baking in the middle of a snow storm, but even with having to "make do" with substitutes, this was outstanding on my chocolate cheesecake.  Thanks so much for a wonderfully easy and delicious recipe.

Quick, simple, perfect.  I used this over a 10 inch rum cake.  I only wanted the top to be covered and drizzle down towards the bottom, and I had about 1/3rd of the ganache leftover.  I'm going to try another reviewer's suggestion of using it as truffle filling.  Another time I used this with dark chocolate morsels.

Used this to glaze the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe from this site. I didn't have any heavy cream, so I used whole milk and only used 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup. Also, I used 6 oz of bitter sweet chocolate chips, and 3 oz of semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the chopped bitter chocolate. 

I heated the milk in the microwave for 1 minute, added the chocolate, and stirred in. I kept microwaving for 15 second intervals until smooth. Let cool for a bit, then poured over the cake. It was the perfect amount for my bundt cake.

I am more of a dark chocolate fan so next time will try it with dark chocolate since the bittersweet was just a bit much for me. Otherwise, it is a very good recipe and easy to follow. Will try this for future foods with the dark chocolate.

I used this as a filler for the cake I made for my husbands bday, I didn't use the rum tho, I also took the left over half a bar of the bittersweet chocolate bar and melted it and dipped strawberries in it to put on top of the Black Magic Cake recipe from this site.  Tasted amazing :) thanks for the great recipe :)

Excellent ganache! The measurements are spot on...did not use the rum this time, but will try it another day. I used semi-sweet choco. chips. I allowed this to cool/thicken a bit and then sandwiched it between 2 cookies~YUM!!!!! I will be using this recipe again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Easy and so very delicious!  I tried replacing the rum flavoring with almond (a little goes a long way!) and it was very good.  My kids prefer it made with semi-sweet chocolate without any added flavorings, so this is how we make it more often than not.  It is delicious with the Heavenly White Cake recipe here.  And fresh strawberries are such a treat when paired with this ganache recipe.

I made a variation of this recipe. I used Jack Daniel's instead of rum, to try to complement the chocolate. I also used dark chocolate as opposed to bittersweet chocolate. I turned out amazing.

Very easy and very good.  I heated the cream and then added the chocolate to the cream in the pan as instructed by another recipe.  Just pour chocolate into cream, shake the pan to cover chocolate and stir after a minute or two.  I also added 1-2 tablespoons of butter for the shine it gives.  I did not add the rum, but would certainly consider it in the future.

Soooo easy.  And super yummy.  I was worried after whisking it that it was going to look grainy or bumpy when I poured it on, but after I let it "set" in the fridge it became smooth and just right for pouring on my Shadow Cake (choc cake with fluffy white icing and chocolate ganache poured over it).  I will definitely make this again!

I've used this recipe six times in the last three months. It's easy, it tastes great (what's not to love about chocolate, cream, and rum?) and everyone loves it. I've been experimenting with the way it sets up. I've used it in its thin form for dipping cake squares, I've let it chill and thicken for icing flourless chocolate cakes, and most recently I chilled it enough to be able to create a decorative edge and "flowers" in chocolate with a frosting bag and tips. This is a big winner, in my book.

SOOOOOOOOOOOO EASYYYYYYYYYYYYYY BUT SOOOOOOOO DELISH!! A fancy French word for a very easy recipe!  Try it.. love it... use it again and again!  This is a *snap* to make!  I didn't have any rum so I added a little Mexican vanilla.  Make sure you let it cool a bit before you pour it over the cake so the flow stops before puddling down to the cake plate.  Oh..in addition to all of the above?  It soooo pretty!

I made this lactose-free, substituting the heavy cream for soy creamer. I changed the proportions a bit, because the soy creamer has only 10% fat compared to the 36% in heavy cream. I used 10 ounces of 60% chocolate, and 8 ounces of creamer. The result had a very good consistency. I whipped part, as a filling; I didn't add margarine, so it didn't whip like cream does, but it did get some air and the consistency and color changed a bit. Then I reheated the other part and poured over the cake. The result was not as shiny as with heavy cream, but still looked quite good. The taste was great, you can't tell it has soy cream on it!

Used this ganache for my Death by Chocolate Cake. Wonderful. I didn't put any bourbon in the ganache and it still tasted fantastic. Left the ganache out for an hour on the counter, and it got nice and thick for spreading on my cake. I've also whipped it with my kitchen aid and it got nice and fluffy for a great chocolate filling.

Don't tell anyone how easy it is to make ganache!  Just kidding.  This one's a winner!  I plan to use it as a filling for my strawberry red velvet trifle.  I'll let everyone know how it turns out.

I don't know why but my ganache didn't set up at all and was very runny even after being in the refrigerator over night.

Worked well warm, and cooled in a ice bath and whisked for a cake filling. I used vanilla instead of the rum.

I made a batch to go inside a cake and whipped it up....it takes a while, I kept wondering if it would work, but it did. I made another batch and added a tbls of butter to shine up the glaze to pour over the top. I used chocolate chips instead of chopped  chocolate and it worked perfectly. I used the ganache under fondant icing and it created a very smooth surface and a wonderful taste. I will be using this recipe over and over and over. (and in secret so I don't have to share licking the mixing bowl!)

I will never use a store bought frosting again. I have tried this the original way AND have whipped it for cupcake frosting- both are amazing and should never be substituted for store frosting!

I made it with fat-free half and half and semi-sweet chocolate chips (Ghiradelli) and dipped cupcakes (Dark Chocolate Cake I) into them.  Delicious!  Will definitely make it again.

The ganache is delicious!  I whipped it to use as a filling for my daughter's birthday cake.  I ended up adding some powdered sugar because I thought it was too dark for younger kids.  I think I will try it with other kinds of chocolate for other uses.

Very easy and very good! Used as a filling for a chocolate cake with caramel icing.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips because the cake was already going to be so rich.

Oh wow! This icing-frosting is delicious! The best part is you can make it more sweet if you like.  It was perfect for a chocolate cake for my husband. I added cherries and pecans on top.

This is so easy and so impressive!  I've used it to top cheesecake, bundt cakes and dip fruit.  I didn't have any dark rum on one occasion so I used almond extract and it was a great compliment to the chocolate.  Thanks for sharing!

This did not turn out.  Twice.  Not sure what the problem was.  The chocolate never fully melted despite me chopping it fine with a knife.  The cream boiled and the chocolate glistened for a brief period and then turned into "curds."  I tried microwaving it and that only made it worse (it separated for some reason).  Could be the electric stove, could be that I reduced the recipe in half. Don't know.  Either way, I now have chunky dark frosting (it did not run) on top of my cake.

A tad disapointed, as abit oily even though I followed the recipe to the T.  I halved the recipe for a 9 inch chocolate cake.  Was more than enough.  Would defo search for a different recipe, although tasted like a nice dark icing, and solidified over time.

Fast, easy and ohhhh so delightful.  Thorough cooling (1/2 hour in refrigerator) makes it spread easily and stay in place.  Develops a nice patent leather shine.

This recipe is so quick, simple & fantastic it's unreal. No need to sit there and chop  the chocolate into small pieces. Just break the chocolate bar into it's little square pieces, pour the cream, whisk like crazy and voila! I pour it onto baking paper in a swirl motif and put it into the freezer overnight. I then pull the paper off and decorate my cakes and it looks incredible. BIG thank you's for this!!!

This recipe is soo easy! I actually put the cream into the microwave because I was to lazy to get out a pan, worked great too! I also added a bit of rum extract, coffee granules and used butterscotch chocolate together with extra dark chocolate, the taste was simply amazing! I think this would also go really well with chopped hazelnuts on top. This recipe is very versatile as it is easy to add a little extra flavor/personal touch to it without messing it up or ruining the taste. definately recommend this one.

Wow - this is great. Will make any simple (chocolate) cake so rich, chocolatey and delicious. And so easy! You can't go wrong. Highly recommended.  Be careful with the quantity though. Turns out if you follow the recipe, you end up with quite a bit!

Used it both as a ganache and icing and both worked very well. Be careful to not over whip because it become very hard to spread (I just put it in the microwave for several seconds to make it easier to smooth and it worked very well!). I used the whip cream to go inbetween the layers of my cake and then on top, let it cool and then drizzled the ganache on top for a fluffy and rich taste.

I didn't use the rum, but this recipe is amazing! I used it as the icing for my birthday cake (over a layer of cooled buttercream) and it was my guests favorite part of the cake. It was also so amazingly easy to do.  I highly recommend using this recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! I've only heard of the word ganache whispered thorough the cooking world's grapevine, and was scared of it since I could pronounce it. I am not renown for my cakes turning out perfectly - but I can promise you that this made a simple, impossible-to-screw-up chocolate cake worth a restaurant showcase! Using semi-sweet chocolate chips and some heavy whipping cream, it took no more than five minutes for me to drizzle it over the cake halves and another five to paint it with pretty swirls of a spatula! You can't go wrong with this!

This is the yummy! One warning, though I don't think it's a detractor from the recipe itself - this doesn't really keep all that well for next day use. Try to make only what you need and use it all up.

Flavor = five stars; quantity = three stars; so I gave a total of four stars. This was just too much if you're garnishing (drizzling) over a cheesecake. It is probably the perfect amount if you're trying to ice an entire, single-layer cake. I don't have a kitchen scale, so I used a scant 1.5 cups of dark chocolate chips for the 9oz. chocolate. I also read from previous reviewers that the chocolate crusted and hardened up with chilling. I was using this to garnish and decorate a strawberry swirl cheesecake and wanted the chocolate to still run a little, but the cheesecake has to be chilled. So I added a scant 2T butter to the final step, which kept the ganache from getting too hard. The final texture was great, even after several hours of chilling. The only complaint was that there was about 2 times as much ganache as there needed to be with a strawberry cheesecake, so I would halve the recipe unless you're trying to ice a cake.

So easy and wonderful. I found high quality chocolate in chocolate chip form and used that instead of worrying about chopping the chocolate. I don't think I'll ever buy a jar of chocolate sauce or hot fudge again.

I used this ganache as an icing for "flourless chocolate cake" from this website.  It was a great consistency to work with, hardened nicely and tasted amazing!  It made more than enough to ice the cake. I did have some leftover.

I put this on the Fudge Truffle Cheesecake from this site.  Decadent and very, very easy!  The only time-consuming thing about this recipe was chopping the chocolate (and if I had a blender or food processor, that wouldn't have taken any time or effort either!)  Thanks for this recipe--it made my cheesecake look so fancy!

Very good, so simple and impressive results.  I whipped the ganache for the filling in my cake, and used the poured ganache for the outside of my cake.  I didn't care for the whipped version and probably will not do it again, but I really liked the results of the poured gananche.  I used semisweet chocolate and found it was almost not sweet enough for me.

Used this one on top of a chocolate cheesecake for my daughter's birthday (she is a consumate chocoholic) and WOW!!  When it firmed up it was shiny and what flavor!!!  I added a few Tbsps of Kaluah but I'm sure any liquer would be fabulous in this (I'm thinking Grand Marnier next time).  It made an otherwise ordinary chocolate cheesecake extraordinary!!

This is a great ganache recipe. I helped my friend make this for her brownies, and she said they went over very well! We left out the rum, though. This makes brownies even more fudgy and decadent!

This recipe has me ga-ga over ganache.  I had been intimadated by the name and gourmet chef-style texture and flavor, but this recipe changed all of that.  I too can make a fabulously decadent and gourmet frosting.  I have many plans for this recipe.  Adding rum shall only be the beginning.  What about Kahlua or a smidge of cinnamon and chili powder for a bit of a Mexican chocolate experience?  One note...plunk it into the fridge just until it is chilled through - as mentioned in another review- 30 minutes is just about perfect.  Use an electronic hand whip, if you have one, and whip away until the ganache turns lighter in color.  I had a lovely, divine, creamy and fluffy frosting in minutes.  P.S.  Do yourself a favor and Do Not look at the fat content.  Just enjoy the sweet moment!

Wow, this recipe is so simple. It was dark and velvety just like I expected. I also did not use the chocolate as directed. I added semi-sweet choc. chips and hershey's bars instead. It turned out perfectly. Thanks so much!

I'm on the fence with this one.  It was very easy to make....but the bittersweet chocolate was a bit to bitter for us.  If I make it again, I;ll use a sweeter chocolate.

F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C!  And so easy!  It was so delicious on top of Duncan Hines boxed brownies.  Would give more stars if possible.

***Update***  Made the ganache again on 6/29 and allowed it to cool. Then mixed on lower speed to whip into a frosting!  Yum!

I thought this was interesting. Great recipe, I have never had Ganache before. So, I didn't know what I was making or what I was looking for. I used it as a cake filling. I am making a cake for my sister in law's wedding, so I am making test cakes. I think I may play around with this and experiment with different flavors on top of the Chocolate. :-)

Excellent!  So incredibly easy to make!  I've used this on the Too Much Chocolate Cake and One Bowl Chocolate Cake (both on this site).  I've used dark rum as called for in the recipe and also tried Malibu Rum for a little something interesting in the flavor.

I used dark chocolate Hershey's kisses to make this ganache minus the rum. I also whipped it just slightly so it barely drizzled over my chocolate bundt cake (Jan's Chocolate Cake recipe from this site!). Delicious!!

I used this ganache on Chantal's cheesecake  just like The Italian Chef.  In fact, my cheesecake looks a lot like his too (I copied him/he should be flattered).
Recipe is straight forward and I had no problems with it whatsoever (even though I was intimidated at first).  Since I needed 9 oz, but the bittersweet chocolate bars came in 4-oz size bars, I bought 2 bittersweet and one sweet and used 1oz of the latter for my recipe.  The bittersweet went perfectly with the cheesecake.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I have been wanting to try a ganache recipe for some time now and I am very glad I chose this one. I actually used half bittersweet chocolate and half dark chocolate and I think that made it extra yummy!

Wowsers, this is good. I was worried because I only had cheap, store-brand  chocolate chips to use, but it turned out pretty dang good! I used semi-sweet for the ganache outer layer, and whipped some milk chocolate up with extra cream for a mousse layer inside. I can't wait to try it with quality chocolate-- when we all recover!

This was a very tasty and rich chocolate sauce, icing or frosting which ever you want.  I think I made the wrong kind of cake for this chocolate ganache, but it was very tasty even if it didn't look so pretty.  I couldn't quite make it look like it was a glazed icing and it melted quite fast for me.  But the taste was good.  I'm trying to be a baker when I'm not...so Im not sure if I used the Ganache properly but it was tasty that is for sure.

Always use this recipe on my chocolate cake (minus the rum). For a two layer 9-in cake, this is perfect. I like to whip it and it really goes a long way. For the chocolate, I just use a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Highly recommend!

This was so simple to make. I’d never made a ganache before and this recipe helped me nail it! I made it for my daughter’s birthday cake. Chocolate is her favorite thing on earth and she loved it, as well as all of the guests. I’ll make this again for sure!

Perfect, quick, and easy. One tip: heat the cream in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between. When it starts to boil up, quickly hit cancel or just open the door to stop. Pour over chocolate, stir and it's done. Thanks!

So rich, delicious and easy!  A few tips: (1) you need to weigh out your chocolate chips on a scale - using the 8 oz = 1 cup rule doesn't work for solids; (2) after you add the boiling cream to the bowl of chocolate, put a lid on top and wait 5 minutes; this provides sufficient time for the cream to actually begin to melt the chocolate without losing heat; and (3) wait about 5-10 minutes for the ganache to cool and thicken slightly before pouring on a cake.  You probably could wait 15 minutes.

I used this ganache for a 3 layer chocolate cake and it looks beautiful.  I used high-quality (i.e., not Nestle) chocolate chips and didn't chop them at all beforehand.  Very easy and straightforward, and the taste is heavenly.

What is there to say? This is about all there is to ganache. Chocolate, heavy cream and maybe a dash of rum. Easy peasy and so very versatile. Want it thinner? Add a bit more cream. Thicker, a bit less cream. You can serve it warm, cool or whipped into a heavenly frosting. Just remember to chop up your chocolate (even if using chocolate chips - it will melt faster and blend smoother). And if it is cooling before it is all blended after adding your hot cream, just pop in the microwave at half power for a few seconds to rewarm and whisk again until melted and smooth. Oh, and you can choose your chocolate too. Forget the chocolate snobs who say dark, decadent, bitter chocolate only. Yes, that makes a delicious ganache, but depending on your need/tastes, so will semi-sweet and even milk chocolate. You choose and enjoy! :)

Place the bowl in the refrigerator 30-40 minutes to speed cool. To whip, stir, scraping the bowl to bring the coldest ganache to the center and even out the chill. Whisk by hand, or pour into chilled mixer bowl & whisk until thickened and fluffy with whisk attachment. Frosts and fills 2 layers, 8 or 9 inches.

Beautifully rich. I don't know if I made it wrong or something, but I left my ganache covered cake in the fridge overnight and the next morning the ganache had set.

But I loved the ease of making it and the flavour, so I will definitely be making it again.

If you want as much as shown in the picture, double or triple the recipe.  But I did make several changes.  I added 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1/2 cup corn syrup to stabilize it.  If I hadn't added those two things, room temperature would have melted it and without the powdered sugar and corn syrup it wouldn't have been sweet at all.

It came out really well. If you want to make it a fluffy frosting, and it’s not becoming fluffy when you whip it, stick it in the freezer for a few minutes and do it again. It will come out nice and fluffy. It is VERY rich and chocolate, so if you’re like me, and prefer milk chocolate over dark chocolate, I would get a milk chocolate baking bar instead of dark chocolate. This is a really easy and wonderful recipe!!!

First time making and the video looking super simple - how could I mess up.  Followed directions exactly.  Not knowing what to expect I "Allow[ed] the ganache to cool slightly before pouring over a cake."  The ganache in a matter a seconds was as thick as pudding.  My opinion that if you want to "pour" over your cake don't wait...just do it ASAP.  Maybe more cream is necessary.   I'll know next time to whisk and pour.  This was for a neighbor's birthday party so don't know how it taste (but I'm sue it will taste wonderful).

So easy and yummy too! Brought the cream just to boil and didn't really let it cool but just a minute or so. It poured perfectly over my cake. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I used 1 1/2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips.  After making I let it sit for about 15 minutes then poured it over a boston cream pie. Very yummy & a nice texture!

I halved the recipe and hand beat it to keep it smooth. I poured it on top of my cheesecake while the spring form was still intact so it didn't drip down the sides. When it was set it made a lovely layer of the richest chocolate! It definitely stood up to the cheesecake and wasn't lost in the flavor. Highly recommend!

Super easy! I put the cream in the microwave for about 2 minutes until it was boiling and then stirred in the chocolate. I used chocolate chips...FYI, about 1 1/2 cup is 9 ounces. Came out perfect!

I used the "cling wrap" method in order to contain the exact consistency! You could try it too and see the difference.

This was so easy and perfect! I used a 10 oz bag of mini dark chocolate chips and omitted the rum. I will definitely be experimenting with different types of good chocolate and flavored liqueurs.

This was so easy to make, and very creamy and delicious. I added another tablespoon of cream instead of the rum. I wanted to whip it, so I cooled it in the refrigerator.  It was in there too long, and set up on me, so I added another touch of cream and whipped it anyway. Turned out perfect! I used chocolate chips. Next time, I will use the full 12 oz package and increase the cream by 1/3 cup, so that I will have more!

I used a few Lindor Truffles and chocolate chips. The runny version of this was awesome but I wanted it to be thicker because I wanted to use it with French macarons. I did as another user suggested and whipped it for 5 minutes which just made the chocolate separate from the cream and it looks disgusting. Not sure how I could avoid that in the future.

I made this to drizzle over a dark chocolate cake. It's a winner!! It was the easiest thing in the world to make and came out delicious. I served the cake not long after making and drizzling the ganache so it was still liquidy and I loved it. I put the cake in the fridge overnight so the ganache hardened into a soft shell and again -- I loved it!!! It's delicious fresh or chilled. I will say I didn't have quite 9 oz of chocolate -- I bought two 4 oz bars and didn't want to buy another bar just for one more ounce. And by the time I got done "testing" the chocolate, there may have only been 7 oz left. It still came out just wonderfully. I can't remember the exact percentage of the chocolate I bought -- it was somewhere in the range of 60-63%. I am SO excited about making this ganache again in the future.

Substituted 1 1/2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips, omitted the rum, but this was DELICIOUS!   Let cool and whipped it to make a frosting.  I will never buy canned frosting again!  So easy to make!  Love it!

I am yet to find a recipe that I enjoy more. Every time I make it it is a total hit with everyone. Made a dark chocolate ganache and used the Bundt pan and I’m sure it’s going to be as good as the other eight or 10 I’ve made before. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was easy & turned out great!  I added the chocolate ganache to the top of the Too Much Chocolate Cake.  I mixed a half batch of the ganache recipe and it was the perfect amount, I thought.  This ganache was suggested after the cake video played.  Thank you for sharing the ganache  recipe.  In the future, I will make this instead of chocolate buttercream.

When I make Too Much Chocolate Cake as cupcakes, i make a full batch of this ganache recipe.

So easy and delicious! I let mine cool longer, and whipped it into icing! It was a Dark Chocolate Heaven!! Easier by far than homemade butter cream. I smoothed it over a new recipe I was trying, called Whacky Cake! Both were easy, and awesome! :)

Can't believe that such an easy quick recipe is so luxurious and decadently delicious! A chocolate lover's dream... Whether you add rum or amaretto liquor as I did, this recipe is a fail proof hit!     I've poured this velvety ganache over chocolate cake, cheesecake, and my new favourite, the Allrecipes 'Best Brownies' recipe from this site!! Have to stop myself from pouring it over everything...

I dont know How this gets such high reviews. Its disgusting. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chips and its Awful. Its Dripping oil, that once cool is just solidified fat hanging from the cake. and its..Bitter..surprise, right? I feel like an idiot for following it. It just Ruined my Black Magic cake. Use the Mocha Icing recipe.

I made it according to the recipe w/o the rum but the butter/oil in the chocolate separated. It came to the top so much I could pour it off. I used ghiradelli 60% cacoa. I was going to pour over a ice cream cake I’d made but the ganache didn’t turn out like I’d anticipated. Anyone have any idea why?

Wow, this was easy!!

I used bittersweet Ghirardelli chocolate bars. I broke them up using my blender. I didn't add the rum, but for a variation consider a raspberry liqueur. Yum!

Bon Appétit!!

Used imitation butter rum flavouring. This was easy-peasy to make and has a smooth texture and delicious (not too sweet) chocolatey flavour.

Wow...just wow
I have tried many chocolate ganache recipes but yours is now my go-to recipe.
It's so rich and smooth, and it makes my mouth water just to look at it. Well Done!
Thanks for sharing your awesome expertise with us.

I wanted a peanut butter chocolate frosting and came across this recipe.  It looked so easy I had to try it.  It was AMAZING!   I used 1 bag of peanut butter chocolate chips (I didn't bother to chop them as some reviews have said to do) and omitted the rum.  I continuously stirred the cream until bubbly, then poured over the chips in a glass bowl and whisked until fully melted.  That was it!
I had made a chocolate fudge cake from a box and it was wonderful with the peanut butter chocolate ganasche!  Not too rich, just perfect.   
I'm sure you could use any flavor chips with this recipe.. white chocolate, mint, butterscotch.. the possibilities are endless!

First time making a ganache. So yummy! Poured enough to cover the entire cake to get all that chocolatey goodness. Whipped what was left into a light, airy texture, then used it to adhere malted milk eggs around the base of the cake. The result was a cute little Easter cake that tasted amazing!

I give this 5 stars because it was so easy (I used  chips) and it tasted fantastic.  I followed the suggestion of others and whipped one batch and put it in the middle of two layers.  Make sure you cool it completely before whipping.  Then I made another batch and drizzled in on top.  It was a huge hit for my house full of 14-year-olds.

I followed some of what another reviewer said and used a blender (I used my Nurtibullet with a dash of the heavy whipping cream added to help...) to get the only chocolate I had on hand mixed into more of a powder. I added it to the near-boiling heavy cream and stirred. It looks amazing and tastes great!

Easy and excellent ganache.  Only change I made was I used a mix of Bittersweet (6 oz) and Semisweet Chocolate (3 oz).  This provides  more "subtle" chocolate compliment.  Find using only Bittersweet results in the Ganache overwhelmening most cakes\cookies.  This slight modification allows the base taste of the primary dessert to "blend" with the Ganache.

This taste great and a very easy recipe.  I usually don't like to change recipe too much but this one I did change, I did semisweet chocolate and I added some white chocolate chips to it along with 1/3 cup of condensed milk that made it even better, it was not too sweet as you would think it would be and I did add rum to it as well I put it on top of the "too much chocolate cake recipe" that can be found right here on Allrecipes, I took them to a Christmas dinner and everyone raved about it.

I made this twice. Both times I used unsweetened chocolate then added sugar to taste (about 7tbsp for 9oz). Works great. But a tip for anyone who like me is prone to the occasional brain lapse make sure the cream comes to a FULL boil. Not kind of boiling. If it doesn't get hot enough you end up with delicious but lumpy chocolate spread (it goes nice with vanilla cake) not ganache.

I wanted a chocolate ganache to put inside my cupcakes, as well as drizzle on top, over the icing. I tasted the ganache by itself and I didn't really care for it (too bitter?), but I still put it inside the cupcakes thinking it would taste different. The little bit inside the cupcakes made them taste pretty good, but I decided against putting more on top because it would've killed the cupcakes. I will be looking for a new ganache recipe.

I used an 85% dark chocolate for this, I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate, so I think next time I will use something lighter. However, this is my new favourite method of making icing! Goodness it was easy! I also used artificial rum extract and it worked well. 
I topped my chocolate banana cake with this, then topped the ganache with bananas and Caramel sauce. The bitterness of the chocolate and the sweetness of the caramel nicely complimented each other.

AMAZING! It is smooth and creamy and have a decadent chocolate flavor. Perfect on top of vanilla cupcakes and topped with raspberries. (Note- if you let this sit in the fridge all day you can eat it with a spoon like fudge).

This recipe is perfect! I let my batch chill for a few hours and then whip it up with my kitchen aid to make a wonderful, fluffy filler and frosting! Also, you can use any type of chocolate chips with this recipe, depending on what your preferred flavour is.

I used 9 oz of chocolate chips and did not put the rum in.  The outcome was WAY too loose.  I will try again with more chocolate.

I added some vanilla, omitted optional rum flavor. It is so easy and delicious. I had a two layer chocolate cake to frost (NYT dump it cake). I beat the ganache with a hand mixer and it didn't take long for it to become fluffy, lighter in color, and spreadable, as opposed to pourable.  It made an adequate amount, but I wouldn't have minded a bit more so that I could put more between layers.  If I were making a bundt cake or cake in a tube pan, I would probably use as a glaze.

This was great!  I made it exactly as written, without the rum.  used it to top off "Too Much Chocolate Cake" by Denise.  One of the best cake/icing combinations I've ever had.  Just be ready with a large glass of milk!

I made this and it turned out great. I put the chocolate in a double boiler and added the cream to that. I whipped it with a hand mixer to make it fluffy for a cake filling once it was cool.

I used this recipe for my grand daughter's 8th birthday cake.  It was delicious.  It was a 1/2 sheet and only crumbs were left.  That ganache is incredible.  I whipped it just as the recipe instructed so I could decorate with it. I followed the instructions exactly.   I highly recommend this recipe.  Made me a happy camper.

I suggest the ratio between the chocolate and cream weight wise to be 2  to 1 with the cream being half the weight of the cholcolate (1 lb of chocolate to 1/2 lb cream). 
Recipe is good, ratio is off...

This was overall a great recipe, however, it did take a while for the ganache to cool enough so that it was thick enough to frost cupcakes. As in, it took 2-3 hours. Just a warning.

Delicious! Used it as a filling for macarons. Whipped it , but  it is still a little loose for a filling. Next time I will not use as much heavy cream. Will use the remainder as a dip for fruit. Yummy!

I've used this both "regular" and whipped and it's always a crowd favorite :-) I use vanilla extract in place of rum because we don't usually keep rum on- hand. I used it to decorate a 5 tier tall volcano cake for my son's birthday recently and it was quick and easy!

My first time making ganache, I used half cooled  for a filling and spread the rest when it was still warm  on top. It had a shiny coating, and as a filling was nice  creamy chocolaty texture. This is bookmarked as a favourite now.

Super easy, forgiving and versatile. I have made it several times using different flavors including using the rum. I've made it as a "icing ", a cake filling and as a mousse .

This was an amazing and easy icing.  I used semi sweet chocolate chips and it was great. Once I made it with the rum and once I made it was 1/8 tsp almond extract. Both were delicious .  It works best to put it on a cool or even cold cake.  I put the whole thing in the fridge for 20 minutes before serving and it was amazing.  So easy.

If you like chocolate, and I mean CHOCOLATE as opposed to the mamby pamby milk or even semi-sweet chocolate, then this is the perfect topper for anything you want chocolatized.  Well, I guess if I left it in a bowl with a spoon, my wife would probably be just fine with it by itself.....but her chocolate palate is super human.  If you need a dark chocolate kick to the face, then put this ganache on top of the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" from this site (but use bittersweet chips and chocolate fudge pudding in that cake).

I made this with 9oz of milk chocolate chips and whipped it for five minutes, then filled some raspberries. Just need to think of what to do with the leftover. YUM! (I did include the rum - slight aftertaste so don't use if you don't like rum. I happen to love rum.)

So easy and tasty! Don't scald the cream! It only needs to be heated to hot, not a rolling boil. If you notice the milk fats separating, it's too hot. I counted around 2 minutes on high and that was plenty. Also, for a little kick, I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to this and then poured it over a chocolate cake, let it cool slightly and topped it all with a pint of fresh cold raspberries. The ganache serves as kind of a glue for the berries to stay in place and the sweetness of the cake and berries rivaled the little bit of subtle heat in the ganache. All in all, it was a beautiful combination and rivaled restaurant quality cakes. Thanks for the recipe!

I love to make this Ganache! I sometimes sub orange liqueur for the rum, raspberry liqueur and others. I love to experiment coconut is great too! Today, I am just using the regular rum with no spice! Bon Appetite~

This is an amazing recipe! I don't usually have bittersweet chocolate on hand, so I have substituted dark chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, and added some unsweetened chocolate to balance it out.  It's always great. I tip my ice cream cake with it; the rum helps to keep it from freezing too hard:)

So easy, so pretty, and so delicious. I wanted to make this non-diary, so I used Rich's Whip instead of heavy cream.  I didn't have rum, so I added a splash of vanilla liqueur.  Yum!

This is an easy to make chocolate ganache, and it is not finicky and is very spreadable (and forgiving!). I made half the recipe and it was enough to thinly spread over a 9-inch chocolate cheesecake (made for Canadian Thanksgiving). Thanks for sharing the recipe - a no-stress ganache. WOW!

Easy and tasty! I did whip it to make a frosting for MyCupcake Addiction's Paint Palette Cupcakes. The bittersweet chocolate would be great with raspberries. As far as frosting, next time I'll try semi-sweet chocolate.

Thought it was time to rate this as it's the third time I'm making it. Love it, it's easy! Tastes great. Today I am halfing the recipe because I'm only using it to top off decorations on my cupcakes. I'm using a swirl of buttercream frosting then just dribbling a bit of this on the top.

Great recipe.  I usually make buttercream frosting but since I moved to Egypt I found that my family here likes ganache.  Before this recipe I never made it before but it turned out excellent poured over my cake.  I substituted the rum for a tsp of instant coffee (we don't use or drink alcohol in any form) and it turned out great.

Super easy and very rich!  I left put the rum but mixed some expresso powder into the chocolate chips before adding the cream.  Easily covered the top (and drizzled down the sides) of an 8 inch sponge cake with some left over to use for chocolate eclairs this coming weekend!

This was my first attempt at a ganache and it turned out great! If you're going to whip it and use it as an icing give it at least an hour and a half to sit and thicken after you whip it. It seems really runny at first, but as it sits it will thicken to a perfect icing consistency. Will definitely make again!

I have made this recipe on numerous occasions, using bittersweet and milk chocolates. Most recently, I made this ganache as part of my chocolate ganache and lingonberry infused chocolate cupcakes. Excellent turn out every time!

I made this for my "Grandmom's Chocolate Cake", it was easy and yummy, but needed a bit of sweetness.  I added some colored sugar on top.

Simple, quick and easy. Used half recipe to cover a 9x13 cake. Used dark chocolate chips - no need to chop. Whisk to incorporate hot cream.

This was my first ganache and it was excellent. The alcohol flavor was stronger than I liked, so I would scale it back to about 1/2 tablespoon. Other than that, it was perfect. I used this one for chocolate chip cookie sandwiches and it was great.

Great recipe.  Be sure to not use cheap chocolate.  It's versatile so you can use semi sweet chocolate if the bittersweet doesn't appeal.  Everyone down to the young kids in my family love this recipe.

I mixed chocolate chips & the heavy cream in microwave for 3 minutes. Then whisked it together and let it sit for a couple of minutes. It was perfect for glazing. If you want it for frosting, then let it cool in fridge for 5 minutes. It's so yummy and easy your friends will be impressed.

This recipe was excellent.  Made it for over the top of an extra chocolatey chocolate cake for my Dad.  It was divine.  Easy and delish!

My son does not like a lot of frosting on cake, so for his 14th birthday, I decided to top his cake with this ganache instead of buttercream. It worked great, and complimented the cherry chip cake that I made very well. Will use this recipe again - maybe to dip cupcakes!

This recipe was shockingly easy, and very fast. The cream only took a single minute to boil, and about five minutes to stir the ganache to a consistency that both my father and I loved. The only thing I changed was that I added 1 teaspoon of sugar, as my father has a sweet tooth, and how the ganache was as-is, it wouldn't have cut it for him (I thought it was fine either way).

This was incredibly easy, and incredibly delicious.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead (and chopped them "fine" in a food processor), and added the heavy cream at boiling point (heated in microwave, 30 seconds at first, then 15 second increments until JUST started to boil). Removed 1/3 to reserve at room temp; froze the rest for 30 minutes, and whipped it.  Poured "whipped" portion over Flourless Chocolate Cake II and spread to coat cake; then poured a bit of the reserved (room temp) portion for contrast.  Dotted the cake with pecan halves.  Decadent--this ganache was PERFECT.  Many thanks for the recipe and for the helpful reviews.

This really saved my flourless chocolate cake for a dinner party.  I had burned the top and cut away the black crusty parts, then poured the ganache over top, then place pecan halves in a circle around the periphery of the cake.  It was wonderful and I was even asked for the recipe!

Has anyone ever made this with something besides rum?  I have a cake that calls for Irish cream was thinking about trying it with that so it compliments it.

This recipe is so very easy!  I have used it as a filling as well as an Icing.  I have added some coffee instead of rum.  It just makes the genache that much more rich tasting.  mmmm

This ganache is wonderful and so easy.  I made a chocolate cake roll with chocolate mousse filling and poured the ganache over.  Very impressive for chocolate lovers. I halved the recipe and added the butter for a glossy look.  Thank you for the recipe.

I entered into a Chocolate Cake Bake Off at work and won first prize! I am sure it was the ganache that put my cake over the top, it was smooth and very tasty. I added Kahlua instead of the brandy and two tablespoons of light corn syrup as suggested by some other reviewers. It is quite runny, however, I put it in the fridge overnight and it was beautiful as a thicker icing if you don't like it so thin. Either way I will be using this recipe a lot as it is just that yummy!!!

I would have given this recipe 10 stars, it's so wonderful! I adjusted the servings down because I only needed 1/4 cup. I used Ghirardelli 60% cocao and for this dessert, I added 2 tsp of Nutella because I was using it on a Banana Bread, Nutella & Strawberry Preserve cake-let. I made it in the microwave, 1 minute on 60% power to heat the heavy cream and then stirred in the chocolate chips. Make sure to watch the cream while it's in the microwave so it doesn't boil hard. 
This is the 3rd time I've made this ganache & every time it comes out perfectly! So easy even a beginner can make it & impressive dessert!

Delicious and beautiful chocolate treat - and this was my first time trying out ganache! I would suggest to refrigerate the ganache for about 10 minutes before pouring over your cake, strawberries, etc. for a nice consistency that will coat the entire dessert. Thank you for a terrific recipe!

Never heard of bittersweet, and sadly listened to my Mother who said it was the same as unsweetened... so first batch didn't come out smooth and still got that taste in my mouth. ended up doing a second batch using semisweet chips instead because short on time and used what I had, and came out great. The rum added a nice bit of extra flavour. Used it on a cappuccino cheesecake recipe. tasted great and helped fill in a few small cracks as well.

AMAZING!! This recipe was do easy and came out perfect! I didn't have bittersweet chocolate so I used milk chocolate. I made my chocolate cake a little less sweet then usual for fear the two together would be too sweet but the flavor was everything I was looking for! Thanks for sharing!

Great basic recipe.  I wanted a lighter cake topping, so used 1 cup heavy cream with 4 oz. of bittersweet chocolate.  Also added a couple tablespoons of white granulated sugar to heat and dissolve in the cream on the stove, stirring constantly until boiling.  Instead of rum, added Frangelica for a hazelnut flavor.  Very happy with results!  Ganache was very chocolatey, creamy and a deliciously lighter consistency .  Will make again and again.

SO FRUSTRATED!!! This recipe didn't say when to turn the heat off and mine turned out lumpy and the oil separated. 

I used medium heat and waited for the whipping cream cream to start boiling in a small saucepan & then I added the chopped chocolate to the boiling cream and started whisking. Was the heat supposed to be turned off immediately after the cream started boiling? after you add the chocolate? I kept it on thinking the chocolate would melt and when it was smooth you were supposed to take it off the heat.

This turned out FANTASIC! I poured the mixture directly on top of a chocolate mousse cake i made. Everyone loved it. This will be my go to recipe for ganache, frosting or to make truffles from. the simplicity of the ingrediants is wonderful. I didnt have dark rum, so i didnt use it. Also i couldnt find "heavy cream" at my grocery store so i bought whipping cream, which said was 35% milk fat, so that worked just fine. I used this to top a 9X13 cake so i increased the amounts by a little bit.

Easy recipe!  First time I have ever made a ganache.  I doubled the recipe and the split it to make mousse as well.  I used rum extract and it was way too strong, so next time I will not double the rum.  I used 8 ounces Bakers semi sweet chocolate and a bag of dark chocolate chips when I doubled it and it turned out great!

This was absolutely the most amazing ganache and so super simple to make.  I put it on top of a chocolate cake from this site and served it as my grandmothers 82nd birthday cake.  My very "hoity toity" family LOVED it!! And that's saying something!

I used this as a cupcake topping, and it turned out great.  I didn't wait for it to cool, so it was fairly drippy, but it looked really gorgeous, and tasted absolutely wonderful, so I didn't mind the extra drips on the serving plate. :)

It is certainly as easy as it sounds..and the kick of rum makes a huge difference!

Absolutely love love love this recipe. I don't know why I never reviewed this earlier (must have forgotten) ... but this is my all time-favourite, go-to recipe for ganache. Thank you INGRIDEVOGEL for sharing this recipe! :D As other reviewers have suggested, it helps to chill whatever you are going to pour the ganache on. Also I have used equal proportions of milk and dark chocolate chips, all milk chocolate chips, all dark / semi-sweet chocolate chips to make this recipe. Yum every single time!

This was great. I made this as a topping over buttercream frosting for my husband's birthday this year, and everyone loved it. Next time I may use milk chocolate instead of the bittersweet, but was still great. It is very tasty over vanilla ice cream too.

I love this!  I used Nestle dark chocolate chips and added no additional flavors.  AWESOME!  This ganache can take an angel food cake from light and guiltless to decadent.  I also added a tablespoon of smooth peanut butter and used it as a faux fondue to dip stratwberries.  Y.E.S.

Gave this a five and I did not use the rum. I used this on something really rich and that bittersweet was perfect.

It's my go to recipe for a "fancy" looking cake. I always make it for chocolate cake too. I switched to vanilla because I don't like the taste of rum.

This was my first ganache and it was super easy. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chips. It made a very dark chocolatey ganache which my husband loved. Personally I prefer milk chocolate so I might try this with milk chocolate chips next time, or at least half milk chocolate.  It poured nicely over my cake and looked beautiful.  I reserved about a half cup of it to whip into "frosting." After taking it out of the fridge it was very stiff.  I had to nuke it in the microwave for 30 sec. on 50% power to make it soft enough to whip. Then I tried to pipe it onto my ganache covered cake, little blobs to press fresh strawberries onto.  Unfortunately the whipped ganache was a little too stiff to pipe.  This was likely my fault somehow.  It still worked, but it wasn't quite the right consistency. Fortunately the strawberries covered it up well enough.

This was pretty good- the store didn't have any more bittersweet, so I had to use 2 ounces bittersweet and 6 ounces semisweet. It still wasn't very sweet AT ALL, so in the future I'm going to use all semisweet. I didn't use the rum, however, so I'm sure that really affected the taste.

It needed powdered sugar, corn syrup, and butter if you make it with a combination of bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate.

Very easy Ganache! I used semi-sweet, because that is what I had on hand, and it was still yummy!I dipped my chocolate cookies in the ganache, then whipped the rest into a frosting and topped them with that as well and sprinkiled with some mini chips. It was decadent! We are going to pair those with some ice cream for a chocolaty dessert fit for an amazing Grandma on her birthday! We used the Hot Cocoa Cookie recipe by  Pip & Ebby floating around on Pinterest.

This is a great recipe, especially great instead of icing. Everybody loved it on a cake and it really added that extra bit to a perfect chocolate cake. This recipe is extremely simple and I will make it again. I will use this instead of chocolate icing with powdered sugar, since everybody finds it way to sweet. This is the perfect thing since there is NO added sugar!I will also try making it with white chocolate!

I didn't have bittersweet chocolate so I ended up using unsweetened squares with a tablespoon of sugar per square.  Not as good as I know this should be but still absolutely delicious. I did whip it up a bit more to make it fluffy like suggested. I put a thin layer over cream filled chocolate cupcakes.  After sitting overnight they tasted almost like the Hostess cupcakes...but better!  Thanks so much for sharing!

Quick and easy to make, I left out the dark rum, not by choice but simply because I forgot to add it!!!  Even so it still turned out totally decadent.  Will certainly be using this recipe again.

I used this as a filling for the Black Magic Cake, with the Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting as a topper.  It was fantastic, and my chocoholic husband loved it.  My neighbor practically stole the cake on her way out.  Decadent.

Very rich. Loved the bittersweet chocolate too.  I chilled part of the batch and tried to whip as directed... didn't really get fluffy but still tasted great.

I have made this twice, and both times it didnt quite turn out. I wanted a whipped chocolate ganache for a filling, and once it cooled and I whipped it, trying to get a good consistancy, it started to curd. It looked like it was seperating! It tasted ok, I made one with bittersweet chocolate, and one with a chopped up easter bunny (milk chocolate). I would reccomend the bittersweet chocolate, as milk was a little sweet for everyone. Does anyone know why mine 'curdled'? I think I will pour it over my cake next time.

Incredible!  I've never even heard of ganache and this seemed so easy that I thought I'd try it. It was fantastic.  I had most of the dark chocolate, but had to throw in a bit of semi-sweet to top it off.  It still turned out great.  When it cooled but was still liquid, I poured it over a (banana) cake and let it drip over the sides.  Everyone went bananas (sorry) about it!

Perfect Ganache I did not use the rum, but I followed the recipe exactly and just let it cool in the fridge and then whipped it up to use as a filling for a devils food cake,it was so good.

I'd give it 4.5 to be true- tho I skipped the rum. It was good, easy, spread well and I used it whipped as a filling for the cake. It set quite hard too when I put the remainders of the cake in the fridge after. However a little too waxy/greasy for my liking- I guess thats the cream. I will continue looking for a sticky, sweet choc topping.

I love this recipe for ganache.  The only thing I changed was instead of the rum, I used vanilla extract.

This was a very easy ganache, and paired with the Dark Chocolate Cake II from this website, it made a very rich, satisfying dessert.

Used it as a frosting for "Fabulous fudge cake." It's possibly the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. Didn't use the rum and it was still very good.

I have to admit I was skeptical at first, even after I tasted it, I felt like it wasn't going to work. But I am happy to say that this is so good! I topped the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" with this Ganache, and it worked together perfectly.

I used this between layers of a beautiful 4 layer cake.  It was thin enough to soak into the cake then I covered it with icing.  It gave the cake that little something extra I was looking for!  It has a wonderful dark flavor and just the right amount of sweetness when combined with everything else.
