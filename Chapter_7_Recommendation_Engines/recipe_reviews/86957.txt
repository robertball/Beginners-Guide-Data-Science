I got a new quesadilla "grille" at Target for $20 (later getting rid of it...isn't needed. This is  comfort food for sure. Get a bunch of 10" flour tortillas since it is hard to say how many you will need.  I sauteed portabella and crimini mushrooms with onion and garlic plus a few spices "du jour", also doubled the spinach and used 2% cheese of my choice.  Later I did the same thing with chicken and no spinach.  These are the same sauteed ingredients of many pasta dishes. I folded giant spinach tortilla's in half and cooked them in my panini press.  I packaged up two of the spinach quesadillas with two chicken/vegetable ones in aluminum foil to freeze.  A couple minutes in the toaster oven (which I don't own?), or just thawed and it's instant finger food.  Dice anything you like, cook it anyway you like, then put it in between a couple tortillas (I like flour or whole wheat or spinach or...), and it's either a snack, a meal or party food.  How fun is that?

These were great! However, you don't need to add oil to the pan to brown them. Just use med-high heat and they should brown just as nicely.

Delish. The pat dry part, way important. I've made these twice (on the same day) and got rave reviews. They want to have them for another party. Didn't need oil in the pan; they toasted just from the heat of the pan. Thanks!

The quesadillas were okay albeit a bit bland.  I served with salsa, but the filling needed a bit more oomph so the second go around I added a diced jalepeno, black beans and topped with sour cream, guacamole and salsa. I am a vegetarian and find the tastes to mix together well.

Much better mhhmmm...

Simple, real tasty and quick...what more could you ask for?  Since I like a lot of "heat" in my food, I added some chopped fresh jalapeno peppers.

Instead of spinach I used fresh swiss chard from the garden.  I steamed/sauteed it with the mushrooms and garlic then drained mixture in a colander to remove excess liquid.  Hubby the Hungry Carnivore gobbled up 3 of them standing at the kitchen counter!

i absolutely love this recipe, i did however make a few alterations, i left out the oil, used fat free shredded mozzarella, and topped w/ hot salsa, yet they still turned out delicious... the garlic adds a really nice touch... most definetly will serve this again.

These were soooo good! I did make some changes though based on what I had in the fridge. I used a combination of parmesan and mozzarella cheeses. Second, I used "regular" mushrooms as I did not have portobellos. I also added some fresh parsley because I wanted to use it up before it went bad in my fridge. It turned out tasting amazing and I served it was sour cream.

Very tasty and quite easy to make.  This was a perfect light lunch served with some rice and black beans and sour cream and salsa on the side.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my new favorite quesadilla!!!  Delicious! I used a whole bag of fresh baby spinach that I sauteed with the garlic and sliced baby bella mushrooms in olive oil, not butter. I also used a whole wheat tortilla and a Mexi-cheese blend. I topped mine with homemade pickeled jalapenos, salsa and some reduced fat sour cream. So good! Cant wait to make again!

I only had 1 flour tortilla so I did not measure anything. Step 2 is completely unnecessary.  I sauteed mushrooms, garlic and chopped onions in butter. Once they were soft, I added the spinach, seasoned with salt, pepper and red pepper flakes and cooked until wilted. I wiped the skillet out  and melted some butter. I placed the tortilla in the skillet, scattered the cheese throughout the tortilla and spooned the spinach mixture on one half of the tortilla. When cheese was melted, I folded tortilla over and cooked until crispy and golden brown. Delicious.

Great addition to a quesadilla...we loved the spinach and mushrooms.  I did end up using button mushrooms that needed to be used, but I don't think that made much of a difference.  We enjoyed this with homemade pico de gallo and sour cream.  Thanks for the keeper!

Thanksgiving 2010. Great way to use up leftover ingredients from Thanksgiving. Used olive oil instead of butter.  Used combination of crimini and white mushrooms.  Used 1/2 onion.  Used 16in flour tortillas.  Also used leftover sausage.

These quesadillas were great! I was surprised at how much flavor these had since there aren't very many ingredients. My whole family loved it, including my two year old, which was a shock since there wasn't any meat in it. The only thing I might change for next time is to add more mushrooms because I thought the spinach/mushroom ratio was just a little bit off. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Very, very good and easy. Entire family (kids ages 4 and 6) gobbled them up. Used baby bellas, frozen spinach and mexican cheese mix. No oil necessary to pan fry them and dipped them in a bit of sour cream.

I thought this was excellent, especially because it used ingredients that I wouldn't normally think of using in quesadillas.  I made a couple minor changes.  I marinated the mushrooms with the garlic in about 1/4 cup of balsalmic vinegar for 1/2 hour, then sauteed that all with olive oil instead of butter.  They were delicious!  I would have served them with guacamole but I was out of avacados.  We ate them just with salsa.

Too much garlic, premise is good (love mushrooms and spinach), but aside from the overpowering garlic taste, something else is missing...can't quite put my finger on it....

Oh my....these are spectacular!!  I made these in my George Foreman Quesadilla maker and the stuffing per the recipe was so much, it started oozing out the sides, but my husband and I gobbled them up.  Will surely make again!

I used fresh spinach, onion, garlic and mushrooms.  Sauteed everything, seasoned with salt and pepper, and put on a flour tortilla with pepper jack cheese.  Cooked on the George Foreman grill, then served with sour cream.  It was good, not great, but certainly an easy weeknight meal.  Next time I will add chicken.

This was delicious.  I added onions and a pinch of red pepper flakes (I like a little heat).  I also ate it with some salsa I had and it was great!  I had mushrooms I needed to use up and luckily some frozen chopped spinach in the freezer that I used.  I will definitely make this again! (I also didn't use the oil as others had mentioned).

These were AMAZING!!! I didn't fold the tortillas in half though, I just put one whole other tortilla on top of the other and flipped that. Doesn't even need guacamole or sour cream, the flavor alone is the best!! I put some chopped jalapeño on mine, because I like them spicier.

This is a fabulous recipe. I had these at a tex Mex. restaurant and had to have the recipe. Found it on, where else, here. I followed the recipe, closely, except, you do not need oil in the pan to finish. Just use a non-stick pan. I used 5 year old cheddar and spicy shredded cheese(the one in the bag). It was excellent. Made this again and used blue cheese, but the flavour wasn't right. I like that this is folded in half in the pan, much easier to work with, to serve I cut each half into 4's. I served with salsa and low fat sour creme.

This recipe was very easy to make and was quite good. I did stray from the recipe a bit. I used fresh spinach, 4 cloves of garlic, mexican shredded cheese blend, and I added a can of black beans (suggested by my wife). I noticed quickly that I should have had the burner on low-medium when I put the quesadillas in the pan. They browned up very quickly. Next time I think I will add some yellow/green/red peppers and diced tomatoes. Overall, a very quick, easy, and delicious meal.

This was very good and easy to make.  Even my husband, who always has to have meat whenever he eats, enjoyed this vegetarian dish!

Wow amazing! I read some reviews before I made this..and quite a few were stating how bland it was. So here's how I adjusted it to suit my tastes: I used fresh spinach and sauteed it with  the mushrooms, garlic, onions, salt and pepper. The only other change I made was that I used a peppered cheese blend that gave it just the right amount of kick! Even my dad who doesn't like spinach loved it!

These were great! I had to change it up a little due to what I had on hand. I used WW tortillas, regular white button mushrooms and also added mozzarella cheese with the cheddar. Also, I baked mine @ 400 degrees for about 10-12 mins. These were soooo tasty! I served them w/ salsa and sour cream. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a great recipe that you can adjust to your taste.  I used fresh spinach just mixed with the other veggies and cooked until just wilted.

Thanks so much for the amazing recipe! I never made quesadillas before and no one believed me when I made these. I used LOTS of garlic, organic spinach, and did not use any oil in the pan so they just lightly toasted. Perfect!!

I added some sauteed onions to this recipe, starting with them, adding the mushrooms, then adding the spinach.  Very delicious and quick to make.

I enjoyed these, and they were pretty easy, too! Did not use port. caps but instead chopped button mushrooms and they were yummy. Nice meal to add to the meatless rotation.

The addition of peppers and onion adds flavor. Often times I saute the veggies til slightly soft. Real bacon bits make a nice change, too.

This was great! My boyfriend and I are new to the vegetarian world and loking for other things to eat besides pasta and salad. I am an extreme novice in the world of cooking. I was a bit afraid that I would mess it up but I didn't. It was super easy to do. I did add onions and jalapenos to it though just for more kick. My boyfriend and I had mexican night and paired the quesadillas with Spanish rice and black beans. He loved it and was happily surprised that I did it. This will be commited to memory!

I've made these wiith a mix of cheddar and gruyer cheese. I also used a 6oz package of fresh baby spinach. I omitted oil. The result was yummy, even for my picky eater.

I added cheddar cheese with halepenos in it, it was perfect had enough spice to make it taste and feel authentic.
Thankyou! I'll be looking into your other recipes.

I was impressed when my kids gobbled this up. I steamed fresh spinach but next time I will just throw it in baches along with the mushrooms and garlic (it's such a pain to squeeze all the liquid out of spinach). I used a quesadilla maker (we love ours) and served with salsa and sour cream. Will definitely make again!

I did a few minor changes to the recipe... First I added a little onion, minced the garlic, used button mushrooms instead of portobello and fresh spinach instead of frozen. I did not use butter to saute` the mixture, cooked them on my panini press to eliminate the oil and used reduced-fat mozzarella & cheddar! The whole family liked these!

I thought this recipe was a good start.  I want to make it again, but the mixture needs more seasoning.  It was a bit on the bland side.

Very good. I bought everything very cheaply at Grocery Outlet. I used mini Bellas, whole wheat tortillas and 2% shredded cheddar. I served this with D's Famous Salsa. My oldest and I really liked these. NOTE: The vegetable oil isn't really needed. If you like it, then use it by all means. We didn't.

Good recipe. I didn't use frozen spinach, I just sauteed spinach, added spices, garlic, and mushroom. Then I put it in a bowl and mixed in corn. Usually when I made quesadillas, I just use a skillet. I tried the oven thing, and I think next time I will just do it the way I am comfortable with. Also I will probably add shredded salsa chicken. But it was an overall good recipe.

This was simple to make and delicious! I made them in my quesadilla maker. I sauted chopped onion in with the garlic and put everything on whole grain tortilla. I also added some deli rotesserie chicken to some and that was delicious as well! Great recipe!

These were pretty good.  I cut back on the oil, and they still seemed too oily.  Next time, I'll follow the advice of other reviewers and skip the oil completely.  Other than that, they were very good.

Fantastic! 

I used portobello mushrooms and I might add an extra garlic next time (we're a garlic loving family.)

They came out looking yummy and they tasted so good. I'm definitely making this recipe again ??

Yummy quesadillas!  I used sliced baby bella mushrooms.  Also, I would skip 2 steps in the directions.  It is not necessary to "cook the spinach according to package" and you do not need to melt the cheese in the oven.  I served with guacamole and sour cream.

I just used the skillet and no oven, cheese melts fine. What a fun and easy dinner for two. Dipped with homemade guacamole and some sour cream.

This is healthy, delicious and EASY, EASY, EASY.  I used what i had in the house - baby bella mushrooms, fresh spinach, low fat cheese, sea salt and whole grain tortillas....and the best part is it only took me 8 minutes from start to finish...a new favorite in this household

Easy and delicious! Good for a quick meal at night.  I used Italian cheese in mine, sauteed  bell pepper and onion with baby bellas and spinach.  I served with sour cream and salsa. SOO yummy.

Was okay.  I added some chopped red onion, but overall found the flavor somewhat bland.  I tried eating with salsa and sour cream but this then overrode the flavors of the vegetables and cheese.  Still had fun cooking it though!

This recipe was just mediocre. I added some onions to it, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was really bland. I had to serve it with salsa to give it some taste. I was really surprised by the high rating until I read the reviews and realized most people altered the original recipe. I think next time I will add some jalapenos to it and maybe some black beans like other reviewers did. It's definitely lacking some kick.

These were SO good.  Sauteed fresh spinach, garlic and portobellas all together.  Montery jack is a great cheese for these - nice and mild - does not overpower the mushroom / spinach.  No baking required.  Just stuff the mixture and fry on a griddle until melted and browned.

This was really yummy and really quick and easy!  Only change would be to not leave the tortillas in the pan to brown for very long at all! It is VERY easy to burn these.   I will be making this pretty often!

These turned out very good, although I was skeptical about using cheddar with the spinach and mushrooms. I initially wanted to use Monterey Jack cheese, but decided to follow the recipe and my boyfriend loved these! He doesn't usually like quesadillas, I was surprised. I topped these with salsa, sour cream and green onions. Next time I make these I will try the Monterey Jack, but make his with cheddar because he loves them as is. They were super quick and easy too, thanks :)

My husband, 10 year old son and I loved these. Super simple recipe and ready in no time!  The only change I made was to use Mexican Blend shredded cheese (and added a little more to our taste) because it's what I had on hand.  Definitely a keeper!

They were decent, but the tortilla got really crunchy after putting it in the oven. It made the rest of the process difficult.

Mine was a little bland, but a good base recipe.  I added some chicken and served it with sour cream.  It was an easy and simple dinner when paired with refried beans.  I will make these again and add some more seasoning.

I love trying new things, so when I get home and the family has already eaten, I treat myself to something I know they won't try (picky eaters!)Great recipe! I sauteed my mushrooms, garlic and spinach in olive oil and a splash of marsala cooking wine. I also used wheat tortillas (not a big fan of flour tortillas)What a great light, easy dinner recipe. Will definitely make again.

great recipe.  i used shitake as well as portabello.  i added some italian seasoning for flavor.  most of all i sauted fresh leaf spinach(not baby) which gave it a more hearty feel.  one tip, make sure the spinach is as dry as possible.

We had these last night using white mushrooms instead of portabellas b/c that's what we had.  Also, I added some paprika and chile powder to season up the filling a little, and I didn't use any oil to brown the quesadillas - they did fine in our nonstick skillet w/o any added fat.  They were really good!

Delicious.  I added onions to the mixture, it makes a difference.  I didn't use the oven, I skipped that step.  Instead, I just took two skillets, and warmed up one side of the the burrito skins.  Flipped the skins over so the warmed side is up, and then loaded the filling.  Folded it in half, and then it was done.  I didn't need to use oil with this method, since the skillets are non-stick, though cooking spray might add a little flavor.

My husband and I really liked this recipe and we will definitely make it again! It tasted like a quesadilla you'd find in a good restaurant. :) 

We tend to load our quesadillas with stuffing so this only made three quesadillas for us - if you're cooking for more than two hungry adults, or you like loading your quesadillas, I'd advise two packages of spinach and 4 portabello caps.

Three stars as written; a bit bland for my taste, as other reviewers have said. I resolved the problem by using pepper-jack cheese instead of cheddar. Gave it great flavor. Also used fresh spinach instead of frozen, because I think fresh is always better. With that change, though, it's a five-star!

This was really good, especially as a change for something different.

I used fresh spinach, folding it in after the portabellas were cooked. Amazing!

I made a lot of changes, but the bones of the recipe are good. I eliminated steps 1 and 2 entirely, along with the oil from step 4, and I added some sorely needed seasoning (garlic salt and a southwest spice blend) to the filling. The results were great, and super easy. I'll make (my version of) these again.

This was fairly easy to make .   I added chopped onion to the  mushroom/garlic saute and used 8" whole wheat tortillas as that's what I had on hand.  Once the mushroom/spinach mix was cooked, I spooned into a bowl and used the same pan to do step 4 (I didn't add any oil and it turned out not to be necessary).  I put some salsa, sour cream, and shredded lettuce on top of the finished tortilla.  The taste was OK--too much spinach.  I won't make this recipe again unless I made significant changes.  I'm sure there is a recipe out there that is more to my liking.

1.17.18 - I continue to make this recipe, but there's no need to bake the tortillas (I use GF corn). I just make the filling, heat a little olive oil in skillet, place tortilla in skillet, sprinkle cheese, top with mushroom/spinach filling, fold other 1/2 of tortilla over mixture, wait 1-2 min, flip, 1-2 minutes more and it's done. Delicious and easy to make! 10.13.16-Very simple and easy to make. I scaled the recipe in 1/2 and used 5 oz. fresh spinach (I chopped it), sliced baby portabella mushrooms, gluten free corn tortillas, and lactose free shredded cheddar. Made the recipe as is and it yielded 6 quesadillas. Corn tortillas are obviously smaller than flour tortillas, but I feel the recipe would yield the proper amount of filling for flour tortillas. The filling is also easily modifiable to include more seasonings if you’d like, but I felt you get enough flavor from the mushroom and spinach with garlic. You could substitute olive oil in place of the butter to make it healthier if you want, but hey butter makes everything more delectable right? Topped my quesadillas with a dollop of guacamole and salsa. Thanks for the recipe!

Followed recipe as written, but used pre-sliced mushrooms and added handful of extra cheese to mix before putting it on to the fajitas. I decided to use our George Foreman grill for browning as couple others have suggested. It did a good job, BUT what a mess. Guess they were a bit overloaded with the extra mushrooms and  oozed out the side. Great taste though and I will be making these again soon!

The idea is fine and the ease of cooking is great, biggest problem was cooking them in the pan at the last step.
Three minutes is /way/ over-kill for them. I barely got past counting 10 seconds and it was already browned. 

This is after decreasing the time drastically when the first one /burned/ on one side at 3 minutes, followed by still burning the other side at 2 minutes. I lowered one side of the second to 1 minute, followed by the other side at 30 seconds, and all of this culminated in me just counting out 10 on each side and them looking perfect. This is with oil in the pan, as per instructions, on medium heat.

Maybe it's different with a gas stove over an electric one, but with an electric stove: beware.

I altered the recipe since some family members aren't as big a fan of mushrooms as I am, instead I opted in for a can of black beans, drained, adding them to the cooked onion, garlic and spinach, just long enough to heat them up. Delicious!

Wow! What an awesome weekday dinner! Filling and healthy depending on what you want to jam in there... I had some sliced shrooms to use up as well as a red onion and some cilantro. I chopped up fresh spinach and went easy on the cheese (microwaved to melt instead of revving up oven). You really can add whichever veggies you want/have onhand. I had some guacamole and smeared it on top - SO good!

I used spinach and herb tortilla and added some salt, pepper and Adobe to my spinach mixture. It was delicious and filling. I also added a little mozzarella cheese.  The only issue I had is the water in the spinach. I used fresh spinach, so next time I will drain it after sautéing. Definitely a dish I will make again!

I give this 5 stars with the changes I made. I used 1 tbsp butter and a few tbsp. evoo. I also added Adobo seasoning (you can find it in the mexican food section of your grocery store) to the spinach mushroom mixture. The first quesadilla I put in a skillet with 1 teaspoon canola oil. I cooked it for 3 minutes on each side and it was way too crispy and over cooked. So the next three, I added 1 teaspoon of oil each time and did them seperately. They took about 2 minutes on each side to be lightly browned but still moist. Overall, this was very yummy and with the changes I will def make again!

I used a little pepper jack along with the cheddar which gave them a nice kick.  I also used fresh baby spinach and just sauteed it with the garlic and mushrooms and added fresh diced tomatoes.  As written it's a 4 star recipe but with a few minor changs definitely a 5 star!

I didn't have mushrooms or garlic so I just did tomatos and onion with some garlic powder. Also I didn't use butter or vegetable oil as there isn't really any need for it. I used frozen spinach and just put 1/3 cup in the pan with a little bit of chopped onion and cooked that for 4-5 minutes. This was perfect for 2 tortilla's folded in half. And I skipped the oven step and just put the cheese & spinach mix on together. Topped with sour cream and salsa, it was a great meal, good comfort food on a rainy day.

I asked my son how many stars this recipe deserved and he said "five stars, Totally!".  We made our quesadillas with whole wheat tortillas and added chicken seasoned with taco seasoning.  We also filled ours with salsa before browning in the pan.  A delicious warm lunch on a rainy day.  Our family loves mexican food.

Sauteed the fresh spinach with the mushrooms and garlic and added salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. I used a Mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar and didn't bake the tortillas, just cooked them on the skillet until brown and crispy. Perfectly simple and light dinner for me tonight!

Yum..these were delicious!  Just to clear out the fridge a little I added some red bell and onions to the garlic and mushrooms in the skillet.  I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Tomato's would also be awesome in these!

You don't have to fry these. You can use a George Foreman grill or panini maker. Then they don't get so greasy. You should also put some sort of pices in it. Spinach and mushrooms are pretty blah. You can add in any veggies you want. Squash is really good and a couple of sliced jalapenos for some flavor.

I would've rated a 5, but husband thought, as recipe is, it is only 4 stars. Next time we'll use more garlic.  Easy to make, but make sure you melt the cheese in the oven because it doesn't take long to fry these & the cheese doesn't melt quick enough otherwise. Will make again.

I love spinach in Mexican food and loved this one as well. It is a simple quick recipe yet tastes great. These quesadillas are better with some sides (Salsa, Guacamole, Refried beans etc - all found on this website)  Thanks very much for sharing this yummy recipe!

Tasty!  I decided to add some grilled chicken into these for a one dish meal (and hubby does not much care for meatless meals!!).  I sauteed my fresh baby spinach with minced garlic & button mushrooms (unfortunately out of portabellas).  Used both whole wheat and spinach tortillas and used light cheddar.  To my disappointment, I was out of sour cream, but did add some fresh salsa, yummy.  Great main dish!

this was delicious :)  i used mozzarella instead of cheddar, though, button mushrooms instead of portabella, and i forewent melting the cheese onto the tortilla in the oven and just sprinkled it over the spinach and mushrooms (on top of the tortilla) over the skillet at the end; i think the mozzarella substitution makes the quesadilla slightly bland (not really salty enough), but topping it with some fresh quacamole (mash avocados, sea salt, lemon, and pepper) does the trick :)

Excellent recipe! I have been looking for a good spinach quesadilla recipe, and this one is very flavorful. I didn't have cheddar cheese so I used mozarella. Easy to prepare and delicious!

I like this and my carnivore BF prefers this quesadilla over the meat-filled varieties.  I use Smoked Gouda instead of cheddar.  The smokiness really pairs well with the earthy pungency of the portobellos.

These came out with much more flavor than I expected. Loved them!! I did add onions to the spinach/mushroom/garlic that was sauteed. I seasoned the sauteed mixture with s&p, onion powder, and garlic powder which may have increased flavor. I used olive oil and 4 garlic cloves to sautee and then used the butter only in the final step when browning each side of the quesadillas. served with sour cream and loved it.

The first time I made this recipe, using the spinach and mushroom mix. Very watery. I modified it to use only the mushrooms, and cook them with the garlic and butter for about 15 minutes. I don't use the oven to make, but toast the tortilla on the stove top in a pan.

Great base for a recipe. After reading reviews warning about bland flavour,  I added half an onion (carmelized in the saute pan before adding the mushrooms and spinach). I also used fresh spinach and sun dried tomato tortillas because they were  both on hand. The end result was very good and something I will certainly make again.

These were pretty good.  I like the general concept, but I think I'd play around with it a little bit.  The garlic flavor was a bit overwhelming for me.  I love the sauteed mushrooms and spinach though.  I'll definitely make this again, but probably with less garlic and some added seasonings or so.  Good recipe to start with though!

This was quite good, although I made a couple of alterations.  First, I used whole wheat tortillas.  Second, instead of mushrooms, I used chopped, cooked bacon.  My whole family enjoyed it.

This was a nice, quick dinner. I first diced a small onion sauteed that in evoo for a minute or two, added a pinch of salt and pepper then threw in the spinach and covered the sauce pan for three minutes, I drained and patted the spinach mixture dry. In the same pan I then sauteed the garlic and added the portabellos in a bit of evoo with a slash of balsamic vinegar, cooked that for 5 mins and added the spinach in. I lightly greased a cookie sheet, I then assembled the quesadilla using "whole wheat chipotle and red pepper tortillas", added the spinach mixture, added diced fresh tomatoes and a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese (I didn't follow the cheese measurements on the site). Cooked in a preheated 350 oven for 10 mins. I didn't make guacamole (too lazy) but it would have been much better served with guac. I served this with salsa, sour cream and a salad. This was a good healthy variation on quesadillas (I personally enjoyed them a lot) however my siblings said they prefer chicken or black bean ones that are more "traditional" tasting.

Pretty tasty; just needs a little more flavour. To make it healthier, I use skim mozzarella cheese and whole wheat tortillas, and olive oil instead of butter. I think I would add some chopped black olives and chopped green onions next time; maybe some chili powder or jalapeno too. I made a few changes, based on how I normally make quesadillas: I don't fold the tortilla; I just place the filling between two tortillas, and cut the entire thing into eighths. Then I grill them til they are browned on DRY heat--for a large batch, I use my large griddle, but a skillet would work too. I had leftovers for lunch, so I toasted them in the office toaster oven (both sides). Very yummy. These are great with "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce" from allrecipes.

Very good...I added jalapeno powder and fajita seasoning to heat it up a bit.  They were also very simple to make. I think these could also be something great to serve as appetizers at a party; just use smaller tortillas and/or cut the pieces smaller

I was looking for some new ideas for lunch and tried this recipe, boy am I glad I did! I didn't use any oil, or the oven, just a non stick frying pan. Came out fantastic! Not bland at all...

These have been a staple snack in my house for years. Tastes great with whole wheat tortillas and feta cheese.

Needs more aromatics and seasonings. Perhaps throw in some bacon or pancetta.

The garlic and spinach are not the best combination.

These are soooo good. We used spinach and herb tortillas instead of flour. My two year old loved them. We will be making these again soon!

This recipe was quick and easy, I also made some with regular corn tortillas and it they were great! I changed the recipe by using garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. It would had been better if I had some but I can definitely see how the garlic enhances the flavor of the spinach and mushrooms.

Added some diced onion & little parmesean but still lacked taste for us.  Used tons of guacamole & yougurt on top for flavor.  Sorry, won't make again.

These were very tasty, very good and very quick, I did step 4 using a panini press (can use 2 skillets with one pressing the top too) so I didn't need to cook in oil, they came out nice and crispy.
