At first I was skeptical about this recipe since it had such wierd ingredients.  Namely the syrup.  But I tried it because of the lack of eggs.  I don't like the idea of eating raw eggs.  But it turned out to be wonderful.  I liked it so much, I made it for a family party.  They all loved it and asked for the recipe.  I've made it about 5 times already.  And still crave it.  Thanx

This is the absolute best tiramisu recipe, ever. No it isn't Italian restaurant quality, but it is the best homemade tiramisu, you'll ever make.  It was fairly easy and everyone loved it.  There were no leftovers.  Thanks Nancy B.

Delicious!  I wasn't sure about the combination of coffee and maple, but it works real well.  To add more maple flavor, I added 1/8 - 1/4 tsp. of maple extract.  As an alternative, pound cake would be good in place of ladyfingers.  My family loved this.  It's quick, easy, and different.

This was a hit in my household! I did alter the recipe a little. I used french vanilla coolwhip instead of regular coolwhip. I used a shot less water and used one shot of kaluha to mix the 2/3 cup of strong coffee. It turned out wonderful! I will certainly make this again! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe Nancy B!

I didn't use as much maple syrup in the cream cheese portion, only 2 Tbsp was the perfect amount

Great recipe. I used an entire package of cream cheese in the 8x8 dish and adjusted the other filling ingredients accordingly. I also added a layer of ladyfingers with the coffee-maple syrup in the middle of two layers of filling. I loved the fact there is no alcohol in this recipe and my guests enjoyed it also at the dessert buffet after high school graduation. Keeps well and I am having some of the leftovers (not much was left) three days later and even better now.

This is truly a great recipe. I tried this recipe yesterday for a party and it was great hit. Thank you for posting it. I made the following changes to make it taste like the real thing. Pour the coffee ( use Gevalia espresso) in a shallow dish, add two teaspoons of rum and a little coffee liquor.  Mix well. Now place the ladyfingers until they are soaked.  Do not leave them for too long.  Take them out when they are still a little crispy on one side.  Place them on a clean dish untill the entire dish bottom is covered with the fingers.  Now poor the rest of the mixture from the shallow pan a little by little.  Reserve about two table spoon of this mixture. Now beat a package of cream cheese with 1 cup of heavy whipping cream, two teaspoon of the reserves coffee mixture and half a cup of golden syrup. I did not use maple syrup because it has a strong flavor.  Golden syrup is english and has a great flavor.  Taste the mixture and if you like add more syrup to make it sweeter.  Now pour the mixture ob top of the layered fingers, spread evenly.  Now soft the powdered cocoa on top.  Place in the fridge for two hours. You will LOVE it.

I had to try this.  I don't totally regret it, but it's just not that great traditional tiramisu.  I didn't care for the maple, and the marscapone cheese was badly missed.

Overall, this recipe is fine.  The syrup gives it a little sweetness, but sort of a "what is that?" element to the taste.  I made it for an informal get together and got mixed reviews.  Some said it was "great" and some said it was "okay".

Excellent and quick! I've never made a dessert before, so this was my way to get a toe in the pool before diving in. It's cheap, it's easy, and it's easy to get all the ingredients. I used sugar-free syrup and cool whip, so it was even fairly low-cal.   As others have mentioned, it's not classic tiramisu, but given that it cost less than $8 for all the ingredients and took less than 15 minutes to prep, AND it could be done by someone who had to ask his Mom what it meant to "fold" the whipped cream in, it's a great idea.  My modifications: I ended up using 8 oz of whipped cream instead of 12 as specified, and I think that hurt the filling a bit. I added a bit more whipped cream as a topping and it really leavened out the heaviness of the faux-mascarpone. I also added a glug of Kaluha to the coffee/syrup mix, and will try again later by adding a bit of rum as well. It could use some bite.   Finally, it tasted MUCH better after sitting in the fridge for 1 hour than it did after sitting for 15 minutes. I think it gets better as the cream and ladyfingers blend a bit and the mixes soak in.

I loved this! My adjustments: I whipped two cups of cream and added a little powdered sugar instead of Cool Whip and added a few tablespoons of chocolate syrup to the coffee/maple syrup mix. I also put the lady fingers on the bottom of the pan, not the sides; I layered some of the cream cheese mixture over the lady finger base (sprinkled some cocoa powder on), put the remaining lady fingers on that, then put the rest of the cream cheese mixture on top.  Sprinkled lots of cocoa powder on top.  It was so good, I'd make it again.

Was Ok. It ended up being a puddle of marshmallow fluff- tasting stuff with some ladyfingers. Overall, though, it tasted good and my family enjoyed it.

A fast fix when you just need Tiramisu, and I like that it doesn't use raw eggs, but it's a little too much "sweet nothing" in my opinion.

I made it EXACTLY as the recipe directed and it was super good.  Not exactly like the Tiramisu from an Italian restaurant, but I didn't expect it to be.  Will be making this again for sure.  Great dessert.

For a simple dessert, this is awesome!  I am lactose intolerant and I used Toffuti sour cream and cream cheese as well as a splash of Kahlua!   I used more lady fingers because I like ladyfingers and did not soak them in coffee but merely rolled them in the coffee syrup and placed it in the dish so they wouldn't be too mushy.  I used chocolate shavings over the first layer of cream mixture and on the top.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was a simple and quick desert.  It is a good substitute for when you cant get the cheese.  Also quick to make.  Not so sure about the maple syrup though.

This was the perfect texture and looked just like tiramisu should - however it was just too sweet for my taste.  I think next time I will omit the maple syrup and see if that will bring it down for me.  Also, it was impossible to halve the lady fingers, they just kept crumbling, so I left them whole.

I changed a few things too. I used White Chocolate Irish cream instead of maple syrup and cut the amount in half. And vanilla yogurt (heavy type) in stead of sour cream. The lady fingers we a little strong but it was very good.

Simple tiramisu is the perfect name because it was soooo simple & delicious! I had my parents over for dinner and made this. My dad is a diabetic and my mom is dieting so I made this with sugar-free maple syrup, sugar free cool whip, and fat free cream cheese. You would think that it would taste way different, but you could barely tell! It was still yummy!! **I also made this a different time following the recipe exactly and it was very good! Thanks for sharing!

This is a very good recipe, however, as stated, the cream was not sweet enough and even a little tangy, which it is not supposed to be.  Next time I will add a little sugar.

I loved this recipe!  I was having a hard time finding marsacapone (sp?) in my town so I wanted to find a recipe that did not call for it.  This was the first one I tried and I am happy I did!  My husband had 5-6 helpings of dessert that night!!

I have made this recipe several times since finding it here, and it's always a hit!  Like other reviewers, I use half a brick of cream cheese (4 oz.), and in the topping mixture, I use half the listed maple syrup and substitute chocolate syrup for the remaining. I also have problems finding ladyfingers, so use shortbread cookies.  I plan to make it this weekend in a sugar free version to be shared with some diabetic friends!

OM NOM NOM!  This recipe made our tummies happy.  No blood was spilled that evening, let me tell you!  The maple syrup was an odd, but lovely touch.  I layered the ingredients as per a previous reviewer's suggestion - it looked great!  We had some extra filling left over, so we put it in our espressos.  Prabob!

Great taste, and easy! However, if you follow the recipe exactly, you don't have layers of ladyfingers alternating.  It's just a 'crust' of them and the filling on top, which makes for quite an imbalance. It's a LOT of filling to a little bit of ladyfingers.  I'd recommend layering....like true tiramisu.

This recipe is great for a "Quickie" dessert. Be sure the coffee is STRONG! I also reduced maple syrup and added some Kahlua to flavor. And a small amount of cinnamon. I drizzled chocolate sauce on top for affect! After it "sets" it is also very easily transportable.

Not a traditional tiramisu, but it's really tasty!! Made it for a family get-together and everyone raved. Didn't use the cocoa powder on top because I didn't have any.

Good for a quick and easy recipe. When I make it next time I am going to make more of the cream topping so there is a thicker layer.

Even though I screwed this up (cream cheese mixture was too soupy as I didn't have frozen whipped topping), our guests still raved over it.  I made ladyfingers from scratch (reason it was probably still so great) and the flavors from the maple syrup were really awesome.  Will try this again and use the correct whipped topping.

a big WOW.  This is impossible to go wrong with.  I didn't measure a single thing and it turned out perfectly!  Only change was that rather than cool whip I made homemade whiped cream and added a little powdered sugar.  SOOOO  good!  Definatly will make it again.

I like this recipe because it's super fast and a lot easier than other ones I've seen. I don't line the sides of the pan, I just make layers. I also added about a quarter cup of mascarpone to it, just because I had some in the fridge. Was very yummy!

I get asked to make this over twice a week! Quick, easy, and absolutely delicious! I ususallu use half a bar (4 oz) of cream cheese, and extra maple syrup for added sweetness!

This is a great desert if you don't have allot of time but I would go lighter on the whipped topping and add more cream cheese. (I'm not a fan of whipped topping) I added Kahlua in with my whipped topping, it made it very tasty!

Easy, easy, easy ....easier if you use a pre-maid bought gram cracker or chocolate pie crust! I use less maple syrup and for variety ... a dash of cinnamon, or orange shaving, or nutmeg! Don't forget a cherry on top!
