The blue cheese/bread crumb mixture didn't melt into the fennel as I was expecting at all -- it just lay there on top.  The fennel was okay.  I'll look for another recipe for fennel.

although this has potential to be very good... it just didn't work out that well. Maybe putting more cheese on would help, but I just was not a fan.
