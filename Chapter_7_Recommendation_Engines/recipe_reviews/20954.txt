Da Ono Kine!!!  I live in St. Louis, MO and don't have access to butterfish, Hawaiian sea salt, ti leaves or taro.  I substituted as follows and it turned out great:  Butterfish/Whitefish, Hawaiian sea salt/Kosher salt, Taro/Fresh Spinach Leaves, Ti leaves/Tin Foil.  Thanks for a taste of the islands in the midwest.

This is how you make Lau Lau!  You can do all chix or all pork if you want to.  Also, the cooking time is not for the meat, but rather the amount of time it will take to cook the taro leaves, which need to cook till - well, basically mush.  If you are substituting spinach for the taro leaves, you can shorten your cooking time by a couple of hours.

Ono!  I found luau leaves @ the Asian market.  For all the Hawaii transplants, butterfish is also known as black cod on the mainland.

Allow me to translate: this is an authentic taste of real Hawai'i, just like Momma used to make. Puts a tear in my eye. Mahalo Auntie May!
