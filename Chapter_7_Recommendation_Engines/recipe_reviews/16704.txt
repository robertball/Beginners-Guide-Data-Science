This was a pretty good dish! Based on previous reviews I only made a few changes. I boiled the potatoes for about 15 minutes to soften them up a bit before the oven. I put onion slices in the mixture and added some garlic about half way through. Some people stated that the potatoes were somewhat bland and I added about 2 tablespoons of butter to the potatoes. Used creamy italian dressing. The dish came out great! Thanks!

Great recipe!! I do this one in a slow cooker. Mixing sliced potatoes on the bottom with the dressng and adding cubed chicken on top. Cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 6 hours. Superb!

This is a terrific recipe! It's very easy and there's only one pan to clean (and if you line the pan with foil it's even easier!) And it's versatile: I added additional vegetables (carrots celery onions) and it turned out great.

A very easy and tasty meal. I put the chicken over the potatoes and carrots and that gave the potatoes more flavor. Also I topped the chicken with a little more dressing five minutes before taking it out of the oven to strengthen the taste of the dressing.

Certainly was easy & I don't know...maybe I had a bad batch of potatoes...but even after extending the baking time the potatoes just didn't get cooked. The recipe didn't specify but maybe would've been better if baked covered.

This was very good.  I followed some previous suggestions and added some chopped carrot and onion.  Also, my grocery didn't have a creamy italian so I used a red pepper and parmesan italian.  My five year old declared the name to be "Poticken" and said it was delicious!

Simple to prepare. Added some additional seasonings like minced garlic pepper etc. Probably would rate this closer to a 3.5 instead of a 4.

It's not spectacular but it's easy to make and it tastes fine. I also added carrots celery and onion. And I also recommend at least partially cooking the potatoes first (I nuked mine instead of boiling them) so they're not still hard when the chicken is done.

I did this in the slow cooker for about 6 hours. I added minced garlic carrots onion in addition to the main stuff. It was tasty and I think I'll experiment with different dressings. I always try to have leftovers and this was horrible as leftover. Not sure I will make this again.

Didnt use italian dressing but used light ranch and the results were amazing...the chicken was juicy and amazing and the potatoes I had to cook a little longer but it was so worth it. I also added grill seasoning to the potatoes and chicken for a little extra kick! Next time I will try the italian dressing and see if its just as good!

As with everything I changed the recipe to make it my own. I put the chicken in a freezer bag and made a rub of 1/4 cup paprika 1 tbs Cayenne Pepper 1 tsp onion powder 1 tsp black and white pepper 1 tsp thyme basil and oregano. Added 3/4 of the rub and the italian dressing to the bad and marinated for an hour. Then put in the baking dish with the potatoes which I drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled the remaining rub on the potatoes. It was incredible.

This was pretty good. Very easy I must say. If I make this again I might add something to the dish like peppers or other veggies. I also used Zesty Italian dressing which probably added a little as well.

I just made this tonight for dinner and it was excellent. Based on some other reviews I did make a few minor 'adjustments'. I put my 13 red potatoes in the microwave for about 15 min. before quartering them. I then lined the pan with the potatoes and put the chicken on top. After pouring the Italian dressing (I used Good Seasons mix and made my own) over all of it I sprinkled Garlic over the whole thing. It was all delicious had great flavor and was devoured by my husband and 2 young boys!

This was SOOOO good! I did flavor the chicken a little with some odds and ends: Season All Rosemary Salt and Pepper. However the next time I will omit the Rosemary as I think there were just too many spices. BUT...wow! Super easy to make. The only problem I did find is that the potatoes NEED to be boiled beforehand. I didn't boil but cut into slices thinking that would make them easier to cook. However that wasn't the case. I will boil them next time and then cut them. Other than that the flavor was excellent and I plan on adding this to my monthy meal chart. EXCELLENT! My two toddlers ate it all up and wanted seconds.

This did not work for me. At the end of the cook time my potatoes were still mostly raw. I kept cooking for another hour before they were good. Even then the dish was too oily for my taste. I would not recommend it.

It was okay. The chicken was quite tender but we found that everything tasted the same - a bit boring. I would make this again but use less salad dressing and add some onions and carrots.

The chicken was very moist and my husband and I both liked the flavor. The potatoes seemed kind of bland and even though I cut them into quarters (instead of halves) the potatoes were not soft when time was up.

First I chose this recipe because it was kid friendly to make - they cut the potatoes and poured the dressing. However we found the results to be less than stellar. The chicken was fair better with the sauce on top but the sauce was so oily no one wanted to eat it. It probably would have been better made into a gravy instead of the greasy mess it was (we used creamy italian dressing as suggested). The potatoes would have been better off cut in quarters as only a portion of them were cooked through - I even put it in the oven for an extra 15 minutes but still had some potatoes that weren't done. Overall it's probably not a recipe we'll try again despite the fact it was easy for the kids to help make.

I had a bottle of Lawry's lemon pepper marinade so I used that instead of italian dressing. I added thickly sliced crooked neck squash and sliced carrots. I cut up the red potatoes thickly but I would recommend cutting them no thicker than 1/2". All in all this was delicious and fairly healthy as the marinade only had 240 calories and 0 fat for the entire 12 oz. bottle!

Marinated chicken in dressing for 2 hours in fridge prior to placing in oven. Placed chicken on top of potatoes. Added zucchini onions. I've had better and will probably not make again because I'm not a big fan of that dressing taste.

We like this for a quick basic throw-together chicken dish. I use regular Italian instead of creamy and add a little minced garlic. Other than that leave it as is. Nothing spectacular but I'll make it again.

Definitely easy but I think I will try a different dressing next time it came out way too heavy on the vinegar. I may try diluting with chicken broth instead.

5 stars for ease and versatility! I used what I had on hand (chicken cutlets fat free low cal Italian dressing celery onion carrots) and it still turned out great! This is a great base recipe that works with different spices and delivers flavorful moist chicken. I did follow others' advice though and half-cooked the potatoes and chicken before baking (which cut the oven time to 35 minutes). Thanks - I'll definitely be adding this to my regular rotation!

I usually marinate chicken breast in Italian then throw them on the grill. I had the potatoes left over from a previous meal and stumbled upon this recipe. Looked good and I know the fam like the Italian chicken breast so it was a no brainer.

A very simple quick and tasty dish. I sliced my potatoes as you would for scalloped and they still took 45 min. to cook thoroughly. I used creamy Italian dressing and added sliced onions and mushrooms. I will nuke my potatoes for a few minutes the next time because the chicken was done before the potatoes. I am anxious to try different dressings with this recipe also. Thanks for another keeper.

I changed a couple of items sautéed in butter 1 TSBS red onion 1/2 cup and celery 1 cup placed in dish then added chicken and potatoes. I baked for 1.5 hours at 350 to ensure the potatoes would be fully cooked. I enjoyed the dish and recommend this when time is limited and you need something quick and tasty!!

Pretty good! Chicken came out nice and tender. I agree with lining the pan with foil for easier clean-up. Next time I would use less dressy and definitely opt for creamy Italian - I think regular Italian would be way too oily.

Right before cooking I covered chicken and potatoes with 1/3 cup parmesan cheese.

Delicious I add a tsp of italian seasoning and a half up of parmesian cheese sprinkled on top cover for the first 20 minutes of baking.

I've been making this dish for years always a favorite. Sometimes I just do the potatoes with Italian dressing as a side dish. Adding onions to this doesn't hurt either;)

A fantastic and simple weeknight meal! Made this while I added additional spices including oregano black pepper crushed red pepper and onions and this was very very good. Definitely a keeper recipe!
