This simple easy and quick Black Bean Soup is perfect to serve as a side or as a stand alone soup and it packs a high nutritious punch. Seasoned with the orange juice, cayenne and chili powder put this over the top.

I made this soup just as the recipe said. It was way too hot for me and my family. I made a whole other pot but added no hot spices. I then mixed the two soups with a ratio of about 1 part hot to 4 parts plain(no cayenne). This made it far more palatable. I also added a can of tomatoes to the second batch.Will definitely make it again.

This soup was wonderful.  I reduced the spice to 1/8 Tsp each because my husband wonâ€™t eat spicy food and it honestly seemed like a bit much.  I think it was just right for us.  I loved it and will absolutely be making this regularly.
