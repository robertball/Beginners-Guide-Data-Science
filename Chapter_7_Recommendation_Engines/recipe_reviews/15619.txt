We had this for Christmas morning breakfast as the poster suggested, and we really enjoyed it.  It's got a different texture (something like   bread pudding) from most make-ahead egg casseroles that I've tried.

This was really easy and smelled wonderful as it was cooking! My husband doesn't like sausage so I used bacon instead.  The bread was a little mushy for my taste, but everyone else loved it.  The next time I make this, I may toast the bread before putting it in the caserole.

We didn't like this very much. After a few bites both my husband and I ended up eating oatmeal for breakfast instead.

Other than being way too salty, it was pretty good.  I would use a 4 quart dish, as the three quart just barely held with ingredients,leaving much spillage.

Just made my first batch--I can tell it will be great and it sure was easy.  One thing though, I could not imagine actually using a can of cheddar cheese soup, it did not sound appealing.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead, and will try cream of celery next time.

I made a few changes by reducing the salt to 1/2 teaspoon which I felt was plenty because of all the salt in the soup.  Also, after I began making this I discovered I only had 5 eggs so I reduced the milk to nearly 2 cups.  I didn't make this the night before, just prepared it in a 9x13 pan and threw it in the oven.  The taste wasn't bad but it wasn't outstanding either.  I particularly didn't care for the texture.

I followed this recipe almost exactly.  I only doubled it and adjusted the cooking time accordingly.  It cooked for over two hours, and it still had an "underdone" texture.  I think there's too much liquid in this recipe.  It definitely has promise, and we're going to tweak it a bit.  The mouth-feel was just too......soft. The taste was good, we just need to dial-in the texture but cutting down on the milk a bit.  Thank you for submitting this promising recipe!

loved it but made some changes. Instead of bread i used french fries and used cream of mushrooms instead cream of cheddar cheese. Plus I did half bacon and half sausage. Super unhealthy but delicious.
