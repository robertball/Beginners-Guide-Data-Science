Delicious as it!  I do use a quick trick a vegan friend taught me--drain package water from tofu. Cut into desired number of pieces, place between paper towels, and microwave for two minutes, then follow the recipe. Eliminates soggy tofu.

This is hands down the best tofu recipe I've ever had. I don't like the taste of tofu but this recipe makes it so  delicious. Make sure you line your baking sheet with aluminum foil tho because it's gonna be really hard to clean it up afterwards because the sauce that's not on the tofu pieces kinda burns.

My tofu turned out the perfect texture and had a nice glazed coating with a subtle flavor. Maybe a tad too subtle for me, so I might amp it up next time. But that's just a personal preference. (followed cook's notes and used brown sugar instead of agave due to what I had on hand.)

This is my go-to recipe for tofu, and my family eats a lot of tofu.  I like the texture and crust that forms with this method, and it is super easy to use in a stir fry dish, add protein to a salad, or just eat with steamed rice and vegetables.  It's very versatile and forgiving; I never measure anything, and improvise if I'm missing an ingredient.  I've made it exactly as written, though, and it is delicious.

A big hit!  I subbed 1 T brown sugar for the agave and omitted the ginger.  Super delicious.  Served with stir fry veggies and udon noodles.  This will become a regular.

Five stars for this dish. I have used honey instead of agave syrup. My husband loved it as well! One of the best tofu recipes we made so far.

When I first became vegetarian, I found this recipe for tofu, and it has been a constant in my recipe book ever since! It's super easy to make and has a great flavor. I actually let the tofu marinate in a small pan for a while before baking to give it an even stronger flavor. Sometimes I also broil the tofu for a short amount of time at the very end if I feel like having a crispier tofu.

I didn't have any sesame oil on hand so I made this using peanut oil - then I made it again, and again.  This is one of my favorite tofu recipes.

This is really, really good. The sauce gets thick and sticky and just tastes good. I used tamari sauce for the soy so it would be gluten free but otherwise, I didn't change a thing...you don't need to. Thank you Teri Rose for your recipe.

I mades changes. In my version I used honey, olive oil, and I didn't add sesame seeds. I made this changes mainly because I didn't have the required ingredients. I also baked them on nonstick foil, so they didn't come out crisp.  Stick to the original recipe ??

The flavor of the glaze is fantastic- but the tofu didn't hold it very well, in my opinion. I was given advice by a well-versed vegan that tofu marinates best when poked full of holes, so there are places for the marinade to go! Next time around, I'll give that a try.

Very tasty!  Added to a "glory bowl" with brown rice, baby spinach, grated raw beets and carrots, toasted almonds, and a wonderful lemon tahini dressing.  A perfect addition to the bowl.

This is the best Tofu recipe I have ever had.  I'm new to a plant based diet so I am not a Tofu expert by any stretch.  The flavor is so good and the texture of the tofu is just right - you actually crave it.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I used brown sugar instead of agave, as mentioned in the chef's notes. This recipe is definitely going to be a regular in this house. Not every day my husband enjoys a vegan meal.

I baked it a little less too, since I like my tofu to be on the soft side.

Made this for vegan dinner guests and it turned out great.  Didn't have any agave nectar so used honey as another reviewer suggested and didn't have sesame oil, so used olive oil.  Make sure to get the packing liquid out of the tofu.  I cut tofu block into 6 pieces and pressed them between a clean dish towel, a surprising amount of water comes out.  Thanks.

My favorite tofu recipe yet, did substitute raw sugar for agave since I don't have any (but am picking some up today to make this again soon), added a bit extra garlic, had to skip the ginger since I didn't have any on hand. Really looking forward to making this again soon and trying it as intended. Tofu was firm but retained a lot of its moist flavor in cooking when done.

excellent recipe!  We've used it in salads and breakfast and as a main course.  Extremely versatile.  I discovered at the last minute that I was out of sesame oil so used olive oil instead and it was fine.

Awesome tofu recipe. I was highly suspect of tofu, having been subjected to soggy tofu previously. Tastes great hot or cold. I would recommend this recipe to anyone, especially as a newcomer to being vegetarian.

We loved this tofu ! It tasted as good as the pan fried one I usually make !  
I was in a hurry so i used garlic powder and ginger powder for the fresh ones. You will need to watch the tofu in the oven during the last 20 minutes of baking. Mine got little too brown on t he 2nd side after 15  minutes.

This tofu is delicious. I didn’t have ginger so I dropped in a teaspoon of ginger garlic sauce for the garlic and ginger.  I had accidentally bought cubed tofu so it made crispy, tasty little bites. I’m literally holding myself back from eating it all so my daughter can have some.

WOW! I wasnt sure what to expect but this was so good! I roasted broccolli to go with it and so tasty. I added the leftovers cold to a bed of salad and a drizzle of sesame ginger dressing for lunch. Simple, delicious and easy way to use tofu.

I really liked this recipe. The flavors were wonderful and I can see using this preparation as my go-to recipe for tofu preparation. The directions were easy to follow and worked as expected the first time I made it.

Super tasty and easy.  Only change was powdered ginger as I didn't have fresh on hand.  It's a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

I love the marinade; it was even delicious on broccoli. The total bake time was a bit too long - my tofu got a bit crispy round the edges...next time I'll shave a bit off the cook time.

so good! loved the sauce. I sliced the tofu about 1 cm think and slathered the sheets of tofu pretty good.  Came out perfect. I had to put them away so I'd stop eating them. I used brown sugar instead of agave.

I made it just as written and brought it to a party.  A few people asked where I got the recipe, so it was a hit.  Next time I will add more garlic and ginger because I like things a bit zestier.  But definitely a winner which I will be making often.

This recipe was a success! I substituted the agave nectar with brown sugar, as the recipe specified.

I didn't have a brush, so I drizzled and rubbed down the marinade on the tofu by  hand.

I also baked the tofu for intervals of 30 minutes. And the recipe turned out as fine.

The dish was a great hit, especially with family. Will make it again.

I liked this very much because of the crisp crust the marinade helps to make on the outside of the tofu.  I cut my tofu into finger size wedges to have more surface area to get that crispy, brown finish.  Will def make this many more times.

Excellent.  I cut my tofu slices a bit on the thin side, my preference.  So needed less cook time.  25 minutes on first side and 18 minutes when I flipped.  No agave, so used honey instead.  Nice glaze, subtle flavor, and soft and chewy on the inside.  Win, win, win!!

Very easy to make and turned out great!*
The only problem that I had was non-uniform tofu sizes which was my own fault. The larger pieces were beautiful but the smaller ones became carmelized and were a bit chewy. The next time I make it, I will probably add some chili paste or some spices to the marinade for a little kick

Like another reviewer I will likely do 20-25 minutes per side; 30 minutes may just be too much in my oven. Otherwise this was an easy recipe to make Tofu and didn't require a lot of ingredients.

It's good. The flavor is a bit subtle, so I think next time I will marinate the tofu for a while before putting it in the oven.

The marinade had amazing flavor but the tofu absorbed next to none or it so it was still quite bland. Part of the issue may have been using premium firm tofu. I will try this at least one more time with a softer variety of tofu and will try to follow up.

Overall, I followed the instructions, but I slightly reduced the amount of sweetener. It is not bad, but not good either. It spends too much time in the oven, it absorbs way too much oil, and all of this for not enough flavor. I have used a similar marinade for tofu (differences: it had grated lemon peel and lemon juice, no sugar or agave syrup) I would quickly sautee in a pan for 5 minutes and the texture was better, not to mention it was ready in minutes.

Even my skeptical husband liked it! I actually think the leftovers I ate cold the next day were better than the ones I ate hot.

Totally delicious! I used two drops of stevia and a T. of peanut butter instead of the agave and it was great! Definitely  would make again!

I made it for the first time today with the following revisions: (1) sliced tofu into 8 equal pieces, wrapped in paper towels and heated them in a microwave for 2 minutes to remove water (2) used maple syrup instead of agave nectar. Besides that followed provided directions. The tofu came out great!

Love it, and worked out beautifully at a recent dinner. I just kick it a little further with some lime juice and cayenne. I'm not quite a vegetarian, but I eat a lot of tofu and tempeh. This recipe is one of the best ways to turn tofu into something savory and delicious.

It was good, and even the kids liked it! 350 for an hour put this right at the edge of burning because of the sugar in the recipe -- don't bump up the heat or time. I followed the advice of another reviewer who suggested oiled foil to make cleanup easier... I'm glad I did. Will probably add a dash of cayenne next time around to spice it up!

I had only sweet soy sauce in my pantry, so I used 4 tablespoons of it and skipped adding any sweetener. I also doubled the garlic and ginger. Easy, tasty and friendly to my wallet!

I love this recipe so much!  I drain my block(s) of tofu between thick kitchen towels, and I took one commenter's advice and microwaved the tofu slices for 2 minutes between some paper towels.  I also use parchment paper so I don't need to add the calories of oil.   The sauce is so delicious that I make extra for when I make tofu in pita sandwiches - with onion/tomato/hummus.  The recipe is so good and foolproof that two batches are usually made at a time (one where I add some red pepper flakes for me and none for my husband), and there is some in the fridge at all times.  So versatile for a sandwich, to add to soups, etc.  This is definitely a keeper.

I will always use this recipe!  The flavor of the glaze is just phenomenal.  I will be making extra glaze from now on as a dipping sauce.  My favorite way to eat this baked tofu is in half of a pita and spread with hummus with some onion and tomato.   I did two tweaks from the comments:  I pressed the tofu and then microwaved them in paper towels for 2 minutes, and I threw them under the broiler for 2-3 minutes after baking.  I could eat this tofu every day for any meal!

I just made this and one thing I would say is to add a bit less soy sauce. My tofu came out really salty. My technique for tofu is to drain it and than freeze it. When I want to use it I just thaw it out in a cup. All the water basically comes out and It becomes a sponge. It literally absorbs everything you put on it. I think that’s the reason my tofu became salty. This recipe was good and I’ll most definitely try it again. One more thing I would note is my tofu only took 30 mins to bake as opposed to the 1 hr.

The grownups in our family loved this, but the grandkids I’m still working on to get their full approval for tofu. I made two batches; one with firm tofu and one with frozen, defrosted, firm tofu. Both were great but we like the frozen version even better – little crumbles fell off and baked up crispy, Yum Yum. Also, the frozen version, which is chewier, absorbs the sauce thoroughly and looks a bit more like meat. Be aware that after freezing and defrosting that the block is fragile, thus difficult to slice. The crumbles that broke off were so good that I plan to make my next batch all crumbles to serve on top of rice or toss with noodles and/or broccoli.

I had to bake it longer, about 45 min each side. I tried with different sweeteners because of what I had on hand - real maple syrup and another time used 2 packets monk fruit sweetener. Both turned out great. I also substituted garlic powder and ginger powder because I had those on hand. Very tasty! They're a great on-the-go snack :)

It didn't have much flavor.  Not nearly as good as another recipe I have that calls for breading marinated tofu in cornstarch and pan frying.

Delicious! Took the tip to dice, press between paper towels, and microwave for 2 minutes before roasting. Tripled the recipe. Took about 20 minutes in oven on each side (two baking trays). Will definitely make again. Thanks, Teri Rose!

No changes made except that  I marinade the tofu for 24+ hours before I bake it.  The marinade is so yummy I think  I will try it  on chicken or pork for the non-tofu eaters at my house. Delicious!  THANK YOU for sharing!

I make this on a regular basis and my family (meat eaters) love it! I use brown sugar in place of the agave nectar, and I have found that medium-firm tofu works best, though it's tasty with firm/extra-firm as well! This can be eaten warm or cold - I serve with rice, on salad or straight up as a snack. Thank you for a delicious and easy recipe!

Delicious and easy to make!  I always add drying out the tofu by throwing the cut pieces into the microwave for at least 3 minutes beforehand.

basic but very easy.  I start with dry frying the slices.  after I bake, it's chewy and irresistible.  I'm trying the same recipe with tempeh now.

This came out excellent, although I cut my cubes into 16ths because my kid has a texture problem, but even she loved it. I like mine over rice with soy sauce and scallions. I’m a prostitute for scallions.

It was good but lacked flavour despite marinating overnight. Next time I'd double the ginger etc to try to increase the flavour.

Yummy and easy in the oven. After pressing the block of tofu, I sliced it the "large" way (into 4 big, flat slices) and used small cookie cutters to make stars, bears, and trees. My 7-year-old kept sneaking the cold tofu bits left over from the cookie cutters; he still ate the cooked tofu for dinner, which means it was extra good.  Will make again!

The  idea itself is a good one; I think the temperature was a little bit high and the time to long.  My tofu cutlets were very caramelized but they worked well in my pad thai.

Tasted ok. You should really marinate any tofu to get the flavors throughout. Also, the tofu should be sliced as thin as possible given the dimensions of your brick.
I used extra firm though the recipe doesn't specify.

Quite good, my daughter likes tofu. It was a bit chewy, but okay. I used Trader Joe's Organic Tofu.

Didn't have enough agave so I used both agave and honey. Came out very tasty. I would make this again.

I think this recipe is great. My daughter and I love it. My hubby, not so much. I only shaved off a star because it doesn’t please the whole family.

I used honey instead of the nectar and it tasted great! I cooked it for 30 minutes and then 30. Next time I will do 25 + 25 minutes.
