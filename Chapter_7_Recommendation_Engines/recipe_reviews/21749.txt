A little salty.  Could use some form of unsalted margarine to lessen the saltiness.  I prepared and put on a chicken pasta.  My very picky husband liked it and he normally does not eat chicken unless it's fried with a batter on it.  Next time I think I will melt cheese on top - like Provolone or Monterrey Jack.

Good flavor.  Couldn't be simpler.  Chicken Soup base granules aren't as salty as boullion cubes and worked great.  Will make it again.  Thanks.

I cut the chicken into strips and served it with rice and got rave reviews from my husband and all his friends. It's probably the easiest meal I've ever made.

This was really good and simple. My husband is a really picky eater, and he ate it all. Any recipe that can do that is a five-star recipe. I recommend this for picky eaters.

Easy and so Good! I clarified some butter to cook the chicken in and then in the last few minutes of cooking added some unsalted butter and spooned it over the chicken.
Based on the other reviews I backed off the bouillon by 50% to reduce the salty taste.
Good Eats!

This was really good! My a big chicken fan, and I get tired of the same old chicken every day. I tried this recipe and it was great. This one is a Keeper!! I even used "I can't believe it's not butter" instead of the margarine, due to my diet. And it was really good. I can't imagine how it tastes following the recipe!

This was great!  I sprinkled each breast with garlic (not garlic salt) and seasoned pepper before putting them in the margarine/bouillon mixture.  And I didn't use bouillon cubes, I used "Better than Bouillon" (lower salt) Chicken Flavor.  Served with Pasta Roni Angel Hair Pasta with herbs (kids' request) and green beans.  Great (and oh so incredibly easy) meal! :)  Thank you!!

I like it but I was the only one that seemed to. Everyone else complained it was too salty and when I tried making it with less bouilion it had no taste.

I'm hoping that Mom had touch cause when I made it, it was way too salty sorry about the rating but I guess I'm basing it on my novice cooking skills.

Easy, simple. Tossed in some minced garlic near the end to give it some more flavor. Served over rice with a little lemon juice. Good for something quick and tasty!

This has been added to my list of "favorite things to make when I don't feel like cooking."  Cause this wasn't like cooking at all.  I made this as is (using low-fat margarine).  I didn't notice it being salty as others are claiming, but I'm unfortunately a salt freak.  It wasn't "spectacular" but it was pretty good and gets extra points for being SO easy.

I used canola oil instead of butter, and used 1 tbsp. of bouillon since I was only doing 3 chicken breasts.  Still pretty salt (but I like salty), but it was easy and full of flavor.

Delicious. I would agree it was a bit salty, definitely best made with unsalted butter. Some honey drizzled on top before serving cut the salt and didn't make it sweet.

I love salt, anything thats covered in salty goodness. But flavored salt? even better! I just eyeballed this because I dont like following the recipe exactly. This turned out brown, crispy, salty, crunchy and juicy! My warning: Its very salty. Butter DOES spit, so be careful if you don't want to get burned. I topped it with mozerella, black olives, and served it with french bread and green beans. Will use on days that I am lazy and want some good soul food.

Quite salty but good.  Next time I add a splash of white wine and perhaps a few spices (thyme, pepper, parsley... something) to add a little more depth of flavor.  But simple, quick and good.

I didn't have granuals. So, I took to bullion cubes, I put them in my pan with about 2tbs water and heated them. They softened so I was able to crush them and disolve them. Then, I added 4tbs unsalted butter. I paired this with noodles with olive oil, garlic, kosher salt, and a dash of pepper. I might try 3 bullion cubes next time, if I still don't have the granual, but this recipe was SO simple to make and was a very nice, lite meal. I will MOST CERTAINLY make this again!

Delicious!
I followed the recipe exactly and it was scrumptious. I had leftover butter/bouillon sauce so I poured it over Albino Pasta (found on this site) and they worked wonderfully together.

very simple to make. we followed advice of other reviews and only put somewhat less than a tablespoon of the bouillon and was to our liking. served it as an entrée and cut up the leftovers the next day in a pasta salad for lunch. (we cooked fresh garlic also for the leftover chicken for a slightly different flavor profile and that was delicious as well)

This recipe was so quick and easy! The chicken was very tasty and juicy. I cut back on the bouillon by about a teaspoon and added a little bit more margarine. I browned some onions in the butter/bouillon mixture before adding the chicken and served with white rice and green veggies, No leftovers here and the onions added some great flavor to the chicken.

This was a tasty weeknight item!  My husband and teens all liked.  I use Move Over Butter spread, and Wyler's sodium free bouillon, so we didn't have the saltiness that other's mentioned.  Also, I sprinkled some pepper and poultry seasoning on the chicken tenders.

I found this way too salty. I think to counter this, serve it with plain rice or mashed potatoes. I made the mistake of cutting the chicken into chunks and seasoning my rice. The leftovers have sat in the fridge for days and I'm about to through it out. That never happens in this house!

I love salty food (especially meat). This was very easy and wonderful. It has many possibilities. I served with potatoes and asparagus. Next time I will try rice or pasta. THANKS!

This was ok for my falmily. It was tasty but not overly special. This would be good only as an "emergency dish".

Very easy to make.  Nothing fancy, but goes well with a lot of different sides. Can easily be dressed up a bit too.

This recipe is great! It definitely needed some minor changes for my tastes. Like the previous posts have stated, it is too salty. I used only one bouillon cube. The chicken was still somewhat salty, but not too bad. The chicken was   very moist and extremely quick and easy to make.

Absolutely loved this. So EASY and CHEAP. Do watch the bouillon as it could get very salty, and the onions was a nice touch and suggestion. Hubby and kiddos loved it. Will definitely be a quick and easy lunch staple.

I made this for my sister and her two kids. Her six yr old is the pickiest eater I have ever come across and he actually asked for seconds! This was easy, quick, and very flavorful. I used a little more bouillon then required for my own preference and it was very delicious. I will definitely use this again and recommend it to anyone who loves flavor!

Very good, a touch on the slaty by my 9 year, who thinks the only food is Hamburgers stated this was awesome. I may need to cut back on the bouillon next as it does get salty. Added a little Garlic Powder during cooking but it wasn't necessary for this to taste good.

I maybe had my heat too high but it seemed like it was starting to burn and I did not want to add more margarine so I added some chicken broth and simmered it.   Also sprinkled some garlic powder and lemon pepper on the chicken.  Was very good and moist.   I would make this again.

This is so easy and so yummy. The only change that I made was to add some garlic powder to the margarine and bouillon mixture. The chicken came out very tender and if you let it cook down a bit, the outside gets a really tasty, browned almost crusty outside to the chicken. A big hit in my house and with its super easiness, this will become a go-to recipe!

There was nice browning in the bottom of the pan so I made a gravy to go with the chicken.  Next time I will use the bouillon granules as the cubes are way too salty and I will add mushrooms to make a mushroom gravy. Really good and simple.

I made this one night when I had a lot of chicken breast, but not much time.  Very fast to make, and quite tasty!  I see what other reviewers are talking about when they mention it is a bit salty - for me only the liquid left in the pan was too salty, the actual chicken (with no "sauce") was perfect!

Had good flavor.. I had thawed chicken and not much for spices.. I didn't  have any bouillon so I used a ramen noodle seasoning packet and served with rice and a vegetable. It turned out great! Husband loved it also!

This was awesome with some tweaks made:  canola oil instead of butter, and added zucchini, chicken cut into strips, then halved the strips.  It was not all salty----just the right amount for flavor!  A definite remake!

excellent and 5 stars for easiness!  I added capers at the very end and also added a little extra butter and cooked it down to remove some of the saltiness.  Served with pasta and a little parmesan.  Delicious!

My three year old LOVED this Chicken and she has been VERY picky recently. I was glad it was very easy since It is hard to cook with an 18 month old and three year old hanging on you. It is saltly but that is easy to take care of using more margarine and low sodium marg....

I used chicken soup base (lower in sodium) and still cut back a bit because I used salted butter.  It was tasty and I poored the butter mixture over plain white rice.  I'll probably make it again but tweak it a bit.

I've had this in my recipe box for almost exactly a year and last night was the first time I made it. It just sounded too simple. Plus, my wife is on a low sodium diet and sodium free bouillon isn't always easy to find. I'm glad I finally tried it, though. It merits 4 stars on taste alone. The fifth star is for the utter simplicity of this ultra-moist, spoon tender (yes, I used a spoon to cut it for my two-year-old), very flavorable dish. I serve mine with rice and made gravy from the leftover butter and bouillon. We will be having this again SOON.

This was the best flavored chicken. It was just what I was looking for to make. As sides I made it with a spinach salad and Chicken Rice-a-Roni. My family loved it. I will recomend it to everyone that I know.

This was delicious!  My family really loves this chicken and ate every last scrap!  I did a little tweaking with some minced onion and a blend or two from Mrs. Dash.  Super easy and delicious!  Exactly what I needed when I had no idea what to do with my chicken.   All ingredients were on hand, too!  superb!

I used pre-cooked frozen chicken breast strips, a clove of garlic, slightly salted Lurpak butter, and vegetable bouillon, which turned out fabulous!

I made this quick and easy recipe for my family.  It was good.  I used fresh garlic and onions, cut the chicken up and topped with locatella cheese.  Next time I will use more margarine for more sauce.  My picky husband who compares my Irish meals with his mom's Italian enjoyed this meal.

MY BOYS AND HUSBAND LOVED THIS. ONE OF MY BOYS SAID IT TASTED LIKE ROTISSIERE CHICKEN. NICE TO COOK IN THE SUMMER AS NO OVEN IS NEEDED AND THEREFORE LESS HEAT IN THE HOUSE. WILL USE AGAIN.

Easy to cook, but too salty for my tastes.
