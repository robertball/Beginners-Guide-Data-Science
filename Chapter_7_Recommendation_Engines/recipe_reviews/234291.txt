If you like something a little different, you have to try this!  I did not have allspice so I used 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon, a pinch of cloves and a pinch of ginger.  Next time I'll up the ginger and decrease the cloves but that is just personal taste.  Hubby loved this with Best Ever Crab Cakes and I also made Tartar Sauce II.  Thanks outdoorsgirl, I cannot wait to try this again!

Tried it last night with lightly fried scallops and it was fabulous,  a light yet hearty zest which complimented my dish.  I can see where it would be excellent on almost every seafood but in particular prawns, scallops, and oysters. Well done to keep it simple and unique.

I doubled the recipe to have enough for everyone to liberally dip their peel n eat shrimp. It was great!

This was a very good cocktail sauce. It uses ingredients one is likely to have on hand, and it was just what we needed for  our shrimp. It is unlikely I will purchase bottled sauce again.

Simple and delicious.  A great sauce for oysters, shrimp and prawns. Sharp and tangy.... Livens the fish up.
