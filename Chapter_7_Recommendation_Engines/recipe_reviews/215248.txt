Very good and very easy to make. Used the regular sugar, flour, etc and worked great. I used mini chocolate chips. They were a hit!!

What in the heck is going on with the measurements for this recipe? I assume that six cups baking powder and 185 cups flour was a mistake when I cut the recipe in half using the serving adjuster. Whoops. That aside, I used my better judgement and used 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour and a teaspoon of baking powder. When I halved the recipe, it called for 3/4 cup of melted butter and 1 1/2 eggs. Because I didn't want to measure out half of an egg, I used both eggs and cut back a couple tablespoons on the butter so I could use two full eggs. The chocolate chips I used were mini chocolate chips and because the measurements were fudged on that as well, I used just under a half cup. I got exactly 12 muffins from a halved recipe and mine were done at exactly 20 minutes. These muffins turned out really pretty. They were good--I just think there should be a little more banana. Maybe next time, I'll cut back on a little of the butter and add in some more mashed banana. NOTE: I hope my review was able to help someone who wants to know what the measurements should be for a half recipe.

These were good, albeit a little bland.  If I were to make these again I might try adding some vanilla.

Awesome just the way the recipie reads. My family loved them...barely last a day in my house with two teen boys. They are encouraging the bananas on the counter to brown more quickly so I can make them again. Only thing I did was substitute regular ingredients for the fancy organics and it worked perfectly.

I used oat flour because my sister is gluten intolerant but the muffins still turned out moist and delicious.

These little muffins are a hit! I bring them into work for motivation. I added about a 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a 1/2 allspice for a nice spiced banana flavor, very delicious!

this was an easy recipe. I liked them but a couple of people I shared them with LOVED them.  I will make it again if one of them requests them. If I do, I will suggest that I bake in a pan instead of cupcakes.

I wasn't really a huge fan of this recipe.  I made it to share with several of my neighbors, and everyone agreed it sort of tasted like a flavorless muffin with chocolate.  I even added extra banana and a little vanilla and it did not have ANY banana taste at all.  They were best when heated in the microwave with some butter on them and the chocolate chips got all melty, but otherwise they were quite bland.

OH MY GOODNESS...... these are soooo delicious that 24 turned into 8 at dinner... then 3 at breakfast.... then 0 at lunch.......... I used to hate banana bread, but let me say this: IF YOU DO NOT TRY THIS RECIPE YOU ARE MISSING OUT BIG TIME!!!!! and don't "alter" the recipe and then give it a low rating. This recipe deserves 10 stars as it is (except that you can use normal flour, sugar, etc)!!
