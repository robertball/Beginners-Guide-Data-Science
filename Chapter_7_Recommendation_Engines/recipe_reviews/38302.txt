Delicious!! However, do not sprinkle the cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice on top of the granola topping or else it will burn in the oven.  Mix the spices in with the oat/granola mixture from the start and add a dash of vanilla extract and it will be perfect!

Crisps are so easy and are a great fall treat.  With this recipe I used no granola, only oats.  I don't use quick oats either, which gives a more chewy substantial topping.  I used peaches that I had cubed and frozen, and after thawing they were quite watery.  I put them in a colander to drain most of the liquid, and then added about 1/8 cup of Minute tapioca to make sure remaining liquid would thicken up.  It was delicious and easy.  Perfect for busy families.

This is a very nice blend of tartness and sweetness. the granola topping was awsome however the peaches came out just a bit tart. I loved it as did my fellow co-workers.

Really good recipe!!!  It was a bit too sweet for me, so next time I'll use less sugar.  I used 1 cup oats and no granola. Instead of fresh peaches, I used 1- 13 oz can of sliced peaches, drained except for about 3 tbsp of the juice. I only used 1/2 stick of butter and it still came out brown and crispy.

Oh boy, this was a winner. I had a zillion sweet peaches (59 cents a lb!). I did not use granola, just a cup of oats, went heavy on the cinnamon and added a TABLESPOON of Mexican Vanilla, dribbled over the peaches, not the topping...just cos I could. Now, yes, this dish was super juicy... but I am not one to complain about juicy or waste a single bit of sweet peach juice! BUT WAIT...THERE'S MORE! Had it hot over Breyers Vanilla Bean ice cream FOR BREAKFAST with espresso...how's that for decadent?! Hubby says he ain't ever tradin' me in!

This is a delicious crisp. I couldn't find loose granola so I bought Quaker Crunchy Granola Bars, (Oat, Nuts and Honey flavor) and I smashed a couple of them. It worked really well. 

Instead of flour I stirred 1 Tbls Minute Tapioca into the peaches and it thickened the juice very nicely. We served it with vanilla ice cream and caramel topping. FABULOUS!!!

This was tasty.
I had a lot of peaches so I used my lasagna pan. I used 2 cups oats & granola, 1 cup brown sugar, no flour & 1/2 cup butter. Nice & brown with a good crunch.

I thought the crisp was very good.
I made a few changes in the order of the ingredients...I added the 1T of flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and toasted pecans to the peaches...I used canned peaches as fresh were out of season. I cooked the mixture on low for about 20mins and then added to a 13 x 9 baking dish.  I added more oats, granola, flour and sugar for the topping to cover.  Baked in oven to brown.  This was my dessert for Thanksgiving this year and it was enjoyed by all.

I've just made this crisp and my husband and i ate nearly half of it! it is very tasty and fairly harmless (of course if you eat all of it in one sitting like I am seem to be able to, then even all that fruit is not going to balance out the butter and the sugar, so enjoy it in moderation).
here are a few modifications I've made:

1. I did not have enough peaches so I added about 8 plums (the oval blue ones). the plums added a bit of sourness to the sweetness of the peaches; they also changed texture a bit. I liked the combination so much that I am going to keep it even when I do have enough peaches. You might want to add a bit more sugar if you don't like the sourness of the plums. I used plums that I bought from the local orchards; they are superior to the store variety. I would not add fruit from the supermarket to this recipe. 

2. I used organic nut/maple granola. I liked it because it had different nuts and seeds: sliced almonds, sunflower seeds, cashews... Aslo the maple flavor goes well with the rest. 

3. I added walnuts instead of pecans and that worked just as fine. 
4. my husband does not like cinnamon so I added a bit of freshly ground clove. I like the zest that it adds to the overall flavor. But do not add too much; it is very strong. 

I recommend this recipe to those who like making easy treats with the fruit in season.

This was pretty good.  I wanted a sweet dessert, so I added extra brown sugar to the peaches themselves and baked them for about 15 min before adding the topping.  Also, thought a little more topping would have been nice.

I made this recipe last night for after dinner and it was so good! Everyone raved about it! The granola really does give it a different taste and it was so delicious.  It is all gone and I want to make some more already. Made with real peaches and served warm with cool whip! Will definately make again!

This is the best crisp I've made in recent memory. Actually crispy, with a nice blend of spices. I didn't follow the method quite as written, but I'm pretty sure as written it is also worth 5 stars. What I did: I used a full cup of granola in place of the granola, oats and pecans, since mine has nuts and is not as sweet as the boxed kind. I combined all of the flour, the sugar, butter and spices in the food processor until crumbly and then stirred a few big spoonfuls (1/2 cup?) into the peaches before pouring the peaches in the pan. I combined the remaining sugar mixture with one cup of granola and sprinkled it over the top. Came out great!

I took a lot of the reviews into consideration when I made this. I took this dish to our 4th of July celebration yesterday.  Wow, everyone loved it!!! I doubled the topping recipe using melted butter, nature valley (green box) granola bars, I mixed in the cinnamon and nutmeg into the topping mixture and omitted the allspice. I blanced the peaches for easy peeling. I mixed in a little bit of sugar and cinnamon as well as the tablespoon of flour and I added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the peaches before putting them into the baking dish.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  I followed the oven setting and baking time exactly and it was absolutely perfect!  Can't wait to make it again :)

This is a great way to use fresh peaches!  I omitted the granola (increased oats) and pecans, and mixed the spices in with the crumble.  I also left the peel on the peaches - more fiber that way, and it's easier!

I really liked the use of granola in the topping. It added an unexpected "crisp" to the crisp. My only change was not mixing the spices with the granola. I mixed them in with the peaches like you would with a pie as I felt this would be better. It turned out great.

This is the best peach crisp I have found on this site.  For once it is not so sickenly sweet which is a bonus in our house.  Thank you, thank you. This will be passed along to several friends.

Yummy!  We loved it!  The oatmeal and granola made it even more wonderful.  I would say it was only 4 or 5 servings...even with ice cream on it.

Perfect! I used frozen peaches, whole wheat flour, and Earth Balance. Be sure to cut peach slices in half, and mix the spices in with the other dry ingredients. Don't be tempted to add extra sweetener to the peaches! I didn't have granola, so I used extra oats and brown sugar. It came out great! I served it warm with coconut milk ice cream.

I made a mini version of this for Hubs and me.  I did have to use canned peaches and agree that it probably would have been better with fresh.  I really liked the crispy topping.  I mixed part of my spices in with the peaches and part in with the crumb topping ingredients just to give it spice throughout, rather than just sprinkling them on top.  I’m anxious to try this again when fresh peaches are available.

This was a very tasty dessert.  I could not find honey sweetened granola so instead I mashed up two crunchy honey flavored granola bars.  This trick worked very well with the dish.

Used the exact amount of ingredients in the recipe and it was fabulous! Don't try to mix the butter in with a food processer...it just comes out all sticky :{ Just cut it in and don't worry if it seems really chunky, it's perfect! Also, do mix the spices in with the oats and flour. Some vanilla Haagen-Dazs ice cream on top and this really hit the spot!

Very yummy!!  I picked this 'crisp' as I thought the addition of the granola was unique and something I hadn't tried before in this type of dessert.  I didn't quite have enough fresh peaches left, so I threw in some fresh apple slices and a couple handfuls of fresh blueberries that needed to be used up!  This turned out nicely...left out the pecans as a personal preference!

The granola was what made me want to try this recipe and it was a delicious addition to the tradtional oats only topping. The spices were a little overpowering for my taste so I will probably cut them in half next time. But otherwise very yummy.

I added about 1/2 cup sugar to the peaches. I also combined the cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and pecans to the granola topping. Served it with lowfat frozen vanilla yogurt.

Perfect as written.  I also like this with all oats, in place of oats and granola.  I also add just a tablespoon of honey, when I omit granola.  LOVE this!

Delicious!!  I used slightly under-ripe peaches from my peach tree so I added sugar to the peaches before sprinkling with oat topping.  I used home-made granola (Jennifer's Granola from this site) and also took the advice of other reviewers and sprinkled the peaches with tapioca instead of flour.  Will definitely make again!

This was excellent. I used fresh peaches, nectarines, and pears. The topping was wonderful - just the right amount in my opinion. Wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

I made it with frozen sliced peaches. Used Stevie sugar substitute in place of granulated  sugar and 2 tbsp minute tapioca instead of flour sprinkled on the peaches to thicken as it cooks. Topping cut in 1/2 stick butter ,1 cup quick oatmeal, 1/3 cup AP flour. 3/4 cup brown sugar blended together with nutmeg and cinnamon , salt to preference. 30 min at 350f. until top is nice and brown-crispy.
Have made this also w/fresh blackberries and was delicious. Serve w/ Devon Cream or ice cream. It does have calories but healthier than all white sugar -white flour.

I grew up making apple crisp, but in the middle of peach season using this recipe seemed more appropriate. However, I did make some of the following changes: added a 1/2 can cherry pie filling, a dash of almond extract. Topping: oats and flour (instead of granola), mixed with the pecan pieces, a dash of fresh nutmeg and a handful of Hershey's cinnamon chips. No other spices needed. I wasn't sure if this would be a blend of to many flavors, but it came out great with or without the icecream topping.

Really good! I used nectarines instead of peaches because that was what I had in the kitchen (they were  getting to be overripe) and doubled the topping. I didn't have granola so I doubled the oats and added 4.5 tbsp of flour.

Found the amount of nutmeg required a bit overpowering. Will make again but will have to alter the spice recommendations. I also found it to be a bit runny the day after I guess its best to serve all of it the day you make it.

Yum! I even forgot the brown sugar and it was good, haha. Just sprinkled some on top after it came out. And it turned some gritty peaches that weren't great by themselves into an awesome tasting dessert.

This tasted great!  Didn't see a need for the granola, so I left it out, and I used walnuts instead of pecans because I had them on hand.  It'd be easy to adjust this recipe to your own taste.

yum! Made recipe as-is (no allspice or pecans). Cut topping down to a 4 person serving and used 4 sliced fresh peaches in an 8x8 pan. Got rave reviews served hot with vanilla ice cream. Will definitely make again.

I just made this and it turned out very good.  I didn't have granola and don't like pecans so I doubled the oatmeal.  Mixed the spices in with the oatmeal, also.  Pretty easy to make.  My peaches were ripe so it didn't need any extra sugar as some have suggested.  Yummy.

I made this using 1 c of old fashioned oatmeal and used 3 c of fresh peaches and 2 cups of mango, just to try it.  It really was different and good!  I especially loved the mix of spices (used the cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice) and pecans with the oatmeal topping.

Good tasting & quick. I recommend a bit more brown sugar.  Don't sprinkle the spices on top, but rather mix them in with the crumble mixture.

This was very good! I added some frozen blueberries I had, which was great. Next time I will cut the butter down, it seemed a bit much for me. Looking forward to making it in the fall with fresh picked apples.

I made the crisp exactly like the recipe said, except didn't have any pecans.  It was quite good, and I don't think the spices "burned" on the top of the crisp, but it was definately a darker color when I removed it from the oven.  It was delicious, but a bit watery.  I think the others' suggestions to add the flour and spices directly to the peaches is a good idea, but it DOES work okay as printed.  If your peaches are good and juicy as mine were, add 2 T flour to the peaches rather than the 1.

I used freshly frozen peach slices (made sure they were completely thawed, and not too wet).  I added the pecans. I followed another's suggestions of mixing the spices into the oats instead of sprinkling them on top.  Still it appeared to be powdery on top. So, I placed a few extra tidbits of butter here and there on top, and added a quick spray of olive oil Pam on it (about 5 minutes before completion).  This recipe was a HIT! Will definitely use again.

Delicious! I brought this for a potluck and those who tried it, loved it! Some were unsure if it was burnt because of all the cinnamon and allspice on top, so I think I'll mix those into the crumble before topping the peaches. Also, I ALWAYS double the crumble and this time was no exception. Turned out great with fresh peaches and nectarines! Thanks!

OMG! This is amazing! I did follow the suggestion and mixed the spices in the granola mix and a splash of vanilla. My peaches got damaged on the way home from the market so I used all of them making 7 cups. I did not adjust the granola mix, just used a little bigger baking dish. We served this later in the evening so we nuked each serving for 30 seconds and topped with creamy vanilla ice cream.  This is now at the top of my desert go to list! A perfect combination of favors.

Excellent base recipe.  I did not have quite enough peaches so added some frozen mixed berries which turned out great.  Also because I'm diabetic I used only 2 tablespoons of brown sugar in the toppping.  I found this to be a perfect ratio.  I had only almond and dark chocolate granola which also contains a mix of seeds and that too made an excellent crisp.  I tried this with small scoop of vanilla ice cream and plain.  Both were very delicious.

DELICIOUS!  I had two peaches in the house as well as a ton of black raspberries from my yard, so I made a 1/3 peach, 2/3 black raspberry crisp.  It is out of this world!  The peaches and black raspberries go so well together--way better than red raspberries.  I also did not have the granola, but I used extra oats and flour.  I wish I had some vanilla ice cream to go with it!  I will definitely make this one again.

This is super easy and SO yummy!  We never have leftovers!  The only change I made was incorporating the spices with the granola mixture.  Will make everytime I have fresh peaches!

This recipe was very good. I used 1 cup of cooking oats because I did not have the honey-sweetened oats. I will use this recipe again and again.

Very good. There wasn't a whole lot of topping compared to the peaches, which isn't necessarily a bad thin who doesn't love peaches but still might be better with a tad more. Still very good, i made another to stick in the freezer for later.

As suggested by others, I used 3 smashed Quaker oats and honey granola bars in place of the granola.  I also mixed the spices into the topping before sprinkling on the peaches.  I really liked this recipe.  My biggest complaint is that the topping didn't really get crisp.  I cooked it for over 40 minutes hoping for crunchier, chunkier topping but it did not happen.  The flavors and level of sweetness were excellent.  I'd probably use a bit more flour or cornstarch on the peaches as there was some liquid in the bottom of the pan, but that was more a cosmetic issue than a flavor one.

Great!  Blanched peaches to peel them easily.  Added extra white sugar + cinnamon + flour mixture to taste to coat peaches, making them sweeter.  Omitted granola.  Added a pinch of baking soda and baking powder to topping.  Mixing topping with melted butter worked fine.

This recipe is awesome! In consideration of some other reviewers who found the topping to be on the minimalist side, I doubled the topping recipe, adding the spices into the topping mix. Since I didn't have granola, I used Kashi Go-Lean Crunch. I also used fresh peaches from my own tree. I found the amount of flour to be insufficient to thicken the juices, but I didn't have any tapioca - oh well, it was still GREAT!

A very satisfying dessert. Peaches don't pair as well with oats as apples do, but the combination was good. I didn't have granola so I used all oats. And in order to ensure even distribution of the spices I mixed them into the oat mixture. I think the peach mixture could have used something - maybe a bit of the sugar and some cinnamon.

This was okay for me. The peaches were to tart. I guess I will have to add sugar directly to the peaches itself next time. The crisp topping was pretty good, but did not like how the spices on top burnt. I made this with frozen peaches that I thawed in the micro and then drained. It worked just fine this way. I think this recipe would be a 4 star if you just add a little more sugar and mixed the spices in with the oat mix. Thats just my opinion, I just like it sweet!

This was amazing...I'll just keep making it over and over and over again!  Only thing I did differently was add a sprinkle of brown sugar and cinnamon to the fruit and the rest I mixed in with my topping!  Everyone just loves it!!!  I also added some frozen mixed berries to the peaches and substituted quick cooking tapioca for the flour!!

This recipe is wonderful. I'm not very good at making deserts or baking, but this was so easy to do & so delicious. I added some extra sugar to my peaches as they weren't very sweet & a little extra flour & it was perfect. I'll definitely make this one again!!

Great!  I used Quaker Granola cereal and also used fresh grated nutmeg.  The only thing I omitted was the allspice.

I baked in individual bowls and served with one scoop of vanilla ice cream on top(with a tiny bit of nutmeg grated over it).  Very pretty presentation!  Will make again!!

Very delicious!  I cut down this recipe to two servings and put it in ramekins instead of a baking dish.  I also used a combination of white and regular fresh peaches (highly recommended!) and didn't use nutmeg (since I didn't have any).  I also put pecans on top, but next time I will mix them in with the granola and oats b/c some got a bit burned.  Oh, and I also used low-fat granola and smart balance margarine, although you couldn't tell!

This was delightful. I also increased the topping and added a little brown sugar to the peaches and cooked for 15 min before adding the topping. It wasn't necessary to add extra flour to the peaches as they thickened w/out. Yummy it's a keeper!!

Very good!  I used frozen peaches and had to adjust the cooking time (lowered the temp & cooked about 10-15 minutes longer).  I also used 1 cup oats and added a little more flour & brown sugar because I like alot of topping.

Didnt really have enough flavor or sweetness and I made it exactly like the recipe said to. Also when it came out of the oven, some of the topping was still dry like it didnt absorb enough juices during the baking process.

Worked out great! I did use less sugar than listed because I broke up some Nature Valley granola bars, which I always find very sweet. But otherwise perfect.

Loved this - did not have any oats so used all granola.  It was superb, served topped with vanilla frozen yogurt.  Used fresh peaches, on sale cheap in the summertime.  Would definitely make again when company's coming.

I added about a cup of fresh blueberries. Admittedly, the peaches weren't at the perfect ripeness but I thought it was just ok.

I didn use the honey sweetened granola and only used quick oats. Did not change the sugar amount as the peaches were really sweet on their own. I put a bit of the sugar called for  in the peach mixture (couple Tablespoons). Left out the allspice and the nuts and added nutmeg instead of the allspice. Nice recipe easy to adapt to your liking.

I made this today but all I had was a bag of frozen peaches, so used them.  Also added about 2 cups of frozen mangoes.  Made the recipe using homemade maple pecan granola.   I also mixed the spices into the dry ingredients.  Because there was more fruit than the recipe called for I increased the oatmeal and granola, but only about an extra 1/4 cup.  Also about 2T more of flour.  It cooked a good half hour longer because the fruit was still frozen.  I really enjoyed it, but my son says he still prefers apple crisp.  LOL, but it is a good recipe and will use it again

My husband and I really enjoyed this. Not too sweet. I substituted a pre-mix of pumpkin pie spice because I had it on hand. We served it up with a splash of milk.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Good recipe I just don't like a lot of sweetness to over power the peaches and the granola topping is too much for me. But if you like sweet then this is for you:-)

This recipe was perfect. I needed something quick, cheap, and tasty that would use up the ingredients I had on hand in freezers etc. The house smells amazing it took no time at all and I am extremely happy with the results. Thanks for sharing

I did what ROBYNBNB did in terms of the crisp part and lasagna pan, and found that the increase wasn't enough. I love when the fruit is entirely covered, so next time I would even increase the increase!

This recipe was good. I made a few alterations,as suggested by other reviewers, I mixed the spices in with the topping. I like a crispier topping, so I used nature valley oats n honey granola, also upped the butter by two tablespoons, and mixed it all together in the topping before putting it on the peaches,followed by a drizzle of honey on top. For the peaches, I cooked them for 15 minutes before adding the topping. Came out GREAT!

Deliciosa, y sumamente facil de preparar. Lo que mas me gusto es que no es super-dulce. En esta receta, Ud. va a poder disfrutar de la dulzura natural de la fruta. Yo no tenia granola a mano, asi que le puse mas avena. Use las especias a mi gusto, y use "pecans". Use la fruta congelada ("frozen peaches without sugar") Yo le daria 10 estrellas!!! Me fascino.

Added homemade vanilla ice cream and yummy.  This would also go well with yogurt if you wanted to be healthier; plain yogurt and this would be delicious!

Made this last night as dessert after unstuffed peppers. It Was real tasty  and I  used canned peaches w/o juice altho I think I may try it with a little of juice as I used coconut flour which is a little heavier than regular flour, the granola and oats made a nice crunchy topping which we all love.  A definite hit with my company and hubby, will definitely keep and make again !

I made this into a gluten free version and it was delicious!  Even using GF flour and oats, the topping came out nicely browned and crispy.  The only thing I did different, was eliminate the spices and sprinkle the cut up peaches with cinnamon sugar and the 1 T. GF flour and mixed that together.  My family doesn't like a lot of spices, so that worked well for us.  Definitely a keeper!

Yummy & easy recipe.  I haven't made many Crisps in my life though so I don't really know how this compared to other recipes.  I forgot to put the flour on the peaches so it was a bit runny but still good.

It was very good and foolproof to make!  Not too sweet so it really accented the flavor of the fruit.  I added both raspberries and blueberries on two separate occasions to the peach mixture just to spice it up a bit.  Did not add the allspice and nutmeg as I really do not care for those spices.

Very good.  I added 1 cup raspberries (only had 4 cups of peaches).  Next time, I'll use firmer peaches.  Added some sugar and flour to the fruit mixture to sweeten up the berries and make it less juicy.  Ended up being a bit too sweet (5 tablespoons of sugar) and wasn't juicy at all (2 tablespoons flour).  Also left out the nutmeg and allspice -- didn't have any.

This is really delicious.  Next time I am going to mix the spices and nuts in with the crumb mixture, and I also think I will cut back on the sugar a bit - it was very sweet.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is the best peach cobbler I have ever made.  It got rave reviews from everyone who ate it.  The best part of the crisp is that it is tart, not too sweet.  Perfect, wouldn't change a thing.

Very good recipe, I like the use of granola in the topping.  You could do so many different types for a different flavor each time.  I used a combo of frozen and jar peaches and it turned out great.

Basically I used what I had--old-fashioned instead of quick-cook, vanilla granola instead of honey, no allspice or nutmeg--and it turned out to be a mouthwatering delight.  Thanks for an easy and worthwhile recipe!

Wow - this was so good!  I love a crunchy topping on top and this is exactly that!  I found some apple cinnamon sweetened granola for the topping - wow, this was so amazing - I'm hoping it works as well with apples too!  Thanks for this super recipe

Fantastic. Great way to use peaches in season, I just picked literally 13lbs. This had just the balance of sweetness to enhance the peach flavour, but not overpower it, so it was SuperPeachy, definetly a Plus.
My only mods were using dark brown sugar, which gave it a rich flavour without any heaviness, and just eyeballing the nutmeg and cinammon on top, because I knew 1 or 1/2 of a tsp. would NOT be enough for my palate :)

This dessert is divine! My hubby and I had to stop overselves from eating the whole dish when it was still warm out of the oven. I used fresh peaches, and we loved it. We don't like foods overly sweet, so I also made the crisp using all long-cooking oats, no granola. I also cut down the brown sugar and used some artificial sweetener. We served it with redi-whip and it was plenty sweet. I used cashews instead of pecans.

Delicious! This was exactly what I was looking for. The oatmeal/granola mixture makes it a bit less of a guilty pleasure, it almost seems healthy. I used fresh ripe peaches and they made all the difference in the world.

This was good, company liked it. The peaches were pretty much on the bottom w/ this on top, did not incorporate at all. Guess that is how crisps are. I used canned peaches but would not recommend. you could tell, because the granola mixture did not interfere w/ peach taste or mix in w/ peaches. Which would be great w/ real peaches, i just wasn't able to use those. Might be better w/ apples!! Would still recommend this recipe.

I love this recipe.  I'm a big fan of this combination of ingredients - from the granola to the pecans. Yum!  I'll make this recipe all through peach season.  Thanks!!
