Made my own rice flour by grinding 1-1/2 Tbls of basmati rice in my spice grinder. Worked great! Good popcorn - just a tad bit salty - but good. I've never had StarbucksÂ® version, so I can't compare. Would go great with a nice cold beer.

At these rations of oil to dry parts, the topping was pasty, and not easy to drizzle over the popcorn. I've tried mixing with a spool, and a manual whisk. 

Not my favorite.
