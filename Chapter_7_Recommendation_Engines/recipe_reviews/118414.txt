4.5 stars. This was a great way to use up some carrots in the freezer.  I brought it to a potluck, so I missed getting people's response, but the dish was gone, so it must have been a crowd pleaser.  The topping made it satisying.  The coconut is a nice addition although it did seem to get lost in the flavor a bit.

This is absolutely delicious.  I've been making it for years and it is always a hit.  My extended family always requests it for our get togethers so I make it several times each year.  Thank you for sharing!

This turned out to a great way to use up the carrots we had.  And I am going to be making this again in the future.  Such a yummy dish and super easy to make!  I never thought of putting carrots and coconut together, but it is delicious.

3.5 - Everyone but youngest liked this.  I personally thought it was too sweet.  Will try again with less sugar.
