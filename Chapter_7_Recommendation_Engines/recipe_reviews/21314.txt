This recipe gets high marks for idea, but low marks for flavor without some tweaking. I was tired of the standard potato/ham casserole and was looking for new ways to use turkey smoked sausage or kielbasa, so I gave it a try. I read previous reviews and incorporated some of other reviewer's ideas and some of my own. What we came out with was a winner, but as written I think the recipe would have been a bland potato stew. I used three medium sized russet potatoes peeled and sliced 1/8" thick. One can of Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup and one full can of skim milk. I sauteed the sliced kielbasa, 1 cup of chopped onion and one chopped red bell pepper with the garlic in a little oil, and added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to the mixture. Once the kielbasa was lightly browned to bring out the flavor I mixed it in the bowl with the potato slices which I'd parboiled for 8 minutes and drained and the soup mixture. Spread that into a 2 qt casserole dish sprayed with cooking spray, baked for 50 minutes, then sprinkled a cup of medium cheddar cheese on for another five minutes until melted and bubbly. We got a terrific dinner casserole and leftovers that we can reheat for a weekend breakfast! This recipe needed less milk, more spice, and the creamy added texture of the melty cheese. Once I added these things to the mix it was a great casserole that we'll repeat!

Okay, my last review was incomplete (my changes didn't post!), so I'll update it. :) First things first: OMIT THE SALT! You can add some if you need it, but it's hard to remove salt from a recipe once added! I used a can of mushroom soup, 3/4 can milk, about 1/3 cup sour cream, maybe ½ tsp garlic powder, several shakes of pepper, a can of mushrooms, ½ a small onion, and maybe a cup of frozen peas. I pan-fried the sliced sausage up with the mushrooms and the onion, and I preboiled the potatoes for about 10 minutes. I topped the entire thing with a few shakes of parmesan and maybe a cup of cheddar cheese. Since I preboiled the spuds, the baking time was only around 40 minutes. Very tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe and kid friendly too! I used fresh garlic and followed the recipe exactly except I used beef link sausage instead of kielbasa. I can't imagine why some people felt it was "soupy". Did they maybe cover it with foil? And bland? NO WAY! I did place it on a foil-lined cookie sheet because I knew it would boil over and it did. But mmmm... the potatoes turned out perfect (firm, not mushy) and the top browned over beautifully. The sauce is creamy and delicious. It got a thumbs up from my entire family!

My Polish husband loved it...even wants me to give the recipe to his mother! Made a few modifications to improve it. Cut the potatoes into small cubes, about 1/2". I added about a cup of sour cream to the soup mixture. Also used one clove of fresh garlic rather than garlic salt or powder. Topped with lots of grated cheese. This was awesome!

This recipe was great!! We had NO leftovers!! :(
I can't understand the reviewers who said they had to bake for longer. How big were your cubes?? Try thin slicing the taters next time. And too much garlic??? Are you people nuts?? Next time I'm adding MORE garlic!! I think that I'll probably add onions too, and perhaps cheese topping the last 15 minutes of baking! Thanks Geneva for sharing this great recipe with us! It's a keeper at this house!

I have been making this for years now, only we use cream of celery soup rather than cream of mushroom.  Other than that, the only difference is I slice my potatoes, although cubing them is probably easier and I top with cheddar the last few minutes of baking.  
I serve for dinner all the time with bread and salad and my 13 month old loves it, she can't get enough.

I was really on the fence on how to rate this recipe.  Out of fairness, I changed the recipe quite a bit the first time trying it after reading other reviews referring to the bland flavor.  Because my family does not eat mushrooms I used cream of celery soup.  I used potatoe slices, and I also added a cup of cheddar cheese to the mix and then another 1/2 cup to the top for the last 15 minutes of baking.  I also fried the garlic with the kielbasa which I think helped the flavor.  I also added some french fried onions to the top of the casserole with the cheddar cheese at the end.  I would HIGHLY recommend not adding any salt to this recipe as I did not and it still was salty enough.  I only added 3/4 soup can of milk and it was plenty.  After all these changes, I must say this casserole turned out AWESOME!!

I made quite a few variations.  I used 3/4 can milk as recommended in reviews.  I browned the sliced kielbasa with minced garlic and half a sliced onion.  After I removed from pan, I deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine and added that to mix.  I scalloped my potatoes instead of cubing and cooked for 45 min.  I added grated cheese over half the casserole (in case I didn;t like it) in the last 5 minutes of baking and it was sooo much better with the cheese.  I also omitted salt and found it was perfectly salty on it's own.  I want to try this in the slow cooker.  It was good, I thought it would be better than it was though. I think if I make it again, I will add sauerkraut.

Wonderful flavors! It looked a little odd when I started baking it. However, the aroma and finished product is to die for! It is creamy and definitely a comfort food. Can be a little salty though. Be careful of that! :)

This is a great comfort food and reminds me of a dish my mom used to make when I was a kid. I did make a few changes simply because I like to tweak things a little bit and make it my own. I used 6 russet potatoes sliced thin with the peels left on. I sauteed the sliced smoked sausage until slightly browned(I used turkey smoked sausage) along with about a 1/3C of diced onion, 1/4C sliced leeks, 1T of minced garlic and a handful of baby bella mushrooms sliced thin. Meanwhile in a sauce pan I mixed together a can of cream of mushroom soup, 2C of milk, 1/2C of sour cream, 1/2 teaspoon each of onion powder and garlic powder, a tablespoon of parsley  and a few shakes of red pepper flakes then melted about a cup and a half of chedder cheese into this mixture until just heated through and mixed well. Next I loaded a baking dish with the potatoes and tossed that together with my saute mixture. Next I topped that with 1/8 of a cup of sliced green onions and poured the soup mixture over top of everything. Sprinkled with parmesan cheese and popped in the oven for an hour and half...absolutely wonderful. Not exactly the most health conscious dish but really good on a cold night as other have said.

Very good.  I thinly sliced 4 baking potatoes, and layered them with the sliced kielbasa.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, mixed with one can of skim milk, a little bit of jarred minced garlic, and freshly ground black pepper.  I poured the soup mixture over the potatoes and kielbasa and topped with 1/2 a bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  I baked for an hour, and then topped with some French's Fried Onions and baked about 8 minutes more.  Let it set outside the oven for a while for the sauce to thicken.  A word of advice:  this does not need the teaspoon of salt!!  The kielbasa makes it salty enough (this coming from someone who likes salty!).   This was a good diversion from our usual grilled kielbasa and my family says it is a keeper!

I made this to take to a potluck and had 3 people ask me for the recipe.  It was good but I think it could be better with some cheese on top and perhaps some onion and bell pepper mixed in and more seasonings.  Just my opinion.  I made recipe as it is stated here.  Diced potatoes small and came out completely cooked.

I gave this 4 stars, my fiance gave it 3.5.  I used sliced red potatoes, skin on and followed the advice to parboil them for about 8 minutes first- and I'm glad I did!  I also lightly browned the kielbasa with the garlic and dried minced onion before putting it all together.  I used Cream of Celery soup, and 1 can of FF milk.  I cooked at 375 for about 50 minutes and it was perfectly cooked.  Fiance complained it was a tad bland and a tad too soupy.  So we'll work on that for the next batch!  This was easy, pretty quick and tasty. We'll def make it again- THANKS!

This was a nice, easy, rich dish.  Great for a cold rainy night. not five stars because its not the most delicious thing ive ever made. I made a couple modifications to make it my own and it turned out nice and thick, not soupy like some were saying.  My mods: 6 red potatoes(skin on) that i diced and boiled for 5 minutes before adding to the sauce.  2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. 2 cups of milk. 1/2 pint of sour cream. I also diced up half of a large yellow onion and sauteed it with the kielbasa slices before adding to sauce mixture. i put everything in a 13x9 glass dish and baked for an hour.  delish!

I thought this made for a good fast & easy dinner. I didn't use cream of mushroom but used cream of poblano instead, only because that it what I had on hand. It was flavorful and everyone liked it. I didn't give it 4 or 5 stars because although I liked it and it made for a good meal it wasn't something to jump up & down about. I will probably make it again.

Delicious.  I sauteed  sausage with 2 minced onions first. Added about 2/3 cup sour cream, and 3/4 cup shredded cheese before baking.  Plus I only added 1 can milk as suggested by others. After 60-70 minutes covered top with cheese and french fried onions.  I don't think there was to much  salt.  I think it depended on what kind of sausage you choose.  I'd make it again and keep varying it depending on my pantry.  A definite keeper!

I did read some of the tweaks I read in other reviews before making this recipe. It was great, even my husband (who is a chef) liked it. I added only a cup of milk.  I doubled the amount of garlic and added 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard with some onion powder for a good bite to it.  I baked for only an hour then added shredded cheese and french fried onions, baking for another 10 minutes.

I actually didn't bake this dish, I boiled the potatoes and then added them to a skillet in which the keilbasa, soup, milk, and spices were already added, then I just heated it thru and it actually came out really good. We were kind of hungry, that's the only reason I didn't bake it this time, but I will definitely try it next time baked. I kind of over cooked the potatoes (not on purpose... :) but it made it a bit more creamy like that. I also used less than the called for 2 cups of milk which made it less runny as well. It all depends on how you like it though. Anyway, this is a definite repeat dish. One more little tip - I sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese on top (instead of adding cheddar) and it gave it a nice taste. Hope this is helpful to those who'd like to try this but don't have two hours to kill. It took about a half hour all said and done. Enjoy!!

This was a good "comfort food" meal, but I agree with other reviewers that it's a bit bland.  I took the advice of others and boiled my potatoes 10 minutes before mixing in the other ingredients.  I also browned my sausage with garlic in a bit of olive oil.  Only used 1 soup can of milk and it was nice and creamy, not soupy.  Just lacked much flavor.  Needs additional spices.

Hmm, need's more flavor. I added about a cup of shredded swiss cheese and this addition would bring the recipe up to a 4 star.

I'm a college student and I make this recipe a lot, its cheap and fast. It heats up well so its an easy warm lunch when I'm on campus all day during the winter. I do use fresh garlic, and follow everything, but I add a cup of cheese and a little sour cream, I also think the thinner the potatoes are sliced the better. I love it, its a great comfort food and is a meal that reminds me of living at home.

Very good.  A bit salty, especially if there are any leftovers. Recommend cutting down on added salt.

This recipe reminded me of a dish my father made while i was growing up. The wife and kids loved this recipe very much, I used cream of chicken instead because thats all i had, and i topped with cheddar cheese. My only suggestion is with the excess liquid have some good bread at the table to dip it into the liquid.

Tasty! I grew up dreading kielbasa night, but I married a man that loves this stuff. I finally found a recipe that we both enjoy. I cooked the sausage in a pan to cook off some of the fat and brown it a little. I will use 3 potatoes next time I make this.

This was great with the following changes: Sauteed the kielbasa, garlic, onions, and bell pepper for about 5 min. Then added the potatoes and cooked for another 5 min, before transferring to baking dish. Then added the cream of mushroom and about 3/4 c. milk. Omitted the salt. So, I ended up baking it all for about 35 min.

I used to make this in a skillet w/o the cream of mushroom and garlic. I always felt it was lacking something--this is perfect! I used 1/2 can of milk and I really like the consistency, like a casserole. I only added 1/2 tablespoon of salt because we like to sprinkle Cavender's Greek Seasoning on it instead (it really adds taste, it may be the thing some of you feel this recipe might still be lacking). Also, to increase more flavor, brown the sausage slices in a skillet 'til they're golden. I found that some of the tastiest sausage on my plate were the carmelized ones that were browning on top (my husband felt the rest had a raw texture--I can see his point since they've been soaking in the cream). I didn't add cheese, it tastes great and creamy enough w/o it, though I may try it once for kicks. This is one I will continue to make often, with the great new additions.

Great flavor!  Mine turned out great.  I used a little less milk, half the S&P.  I added a little chopped onion and celery, and diced the potatoes very small (1/2"), as suggested.  Made half the recipe in an 8" square pan (3 cups diced potatoes), baked it at 350 for 1hr & 15 mins, and it came out perfect!  Next time, I may use less kielbasa or else cut it up (it was very strong - I used Hillshire  Farms Turkey Kielbasa).

This recipe does not call for garlic SALT or lemon pepper(?).  I used red potatoes so that I wouldn't need to cook it as long.  It was so good my husband and I ate the entire dish!  I would recommend if you want leftovers to double the recipe.  I love this recipe!  And no it is not a creamy base dish.  Ingrediants are used for flavor only,  not consistancy.

A quick scan of the ingredients told me that this was going to be far too soupy for what I wanted. Since I wanted more of a creamy casserole than a soup, it was necessary for me to make a few changes. I omitted the milk entirely and  used cream of onion soup mixed with 8 oz sour cream. I added some garlic/onion powders, pepper, paprika, a few shakes of dried parsley, as well as a handful each of shredded cheddar and an Italian blend. I cut my potatoes a bit bigger than diced and parboiled for 10 minutes. I browned my lowfat smoked turkey sausage, which I sliced into halves, in a bit of canola oil, then removed from the pan and sauteed a small onion in the drippings. I combined the parboiled potatoes, turkey sausage, onions, and the soup/sour cream mixture in a 9x13 baking dish (don't own a 7x11 dish). I added some additional shredded cheddar atop the casserole and baked for 25 minutes at 350. The last 2 minutes, I set the oven to broil and scattered a few French fried onions. I let the casserole sit for 10 minutes after removing it from the oven and the end result was delicious!  Will definitely make again using this recipe as my inspiration!

Great simple recipe!

Changing things up a little, I sautéd half an onion, a green pepper, a clove of garlic with a little olive oil with cayenne pepper and black pepper; then added the kielbasa to cook for a bit. Instead of 2 cups, milk, I used 1 cup half & half, 0.5 cups milk, 4 oz of sour cream, a handful of sharp cheddar cheese, and a little black pepper. Omit the salt as the kielbasa will make up for it; add garlic salt if desired.

It will help to reduce the cooking time by putting the cubed potatoes in the microwave on high for about 4-5 minutes.

Turned out awesome!

I rated this a 3 star simply because it needed alot of tweeking! But after the "tweeking" it's a 5 star recipe!! I added 1 can of cheese soup, along with 1 cup of sour cream and 1 more cup of milk. And topped with shredded cheddar cheese. I also thinly sliced my potatoes, so it cooked faster. After my additions it filled a 9x13" pan. Will make again!

The original recipe looked good but bland so I added bacon & cheddar cheese & it was wonderful !!
To everyone who said it was too soupy....leave it sit for awhile. It thickens up a bit as it cools

This should be called kielbasa potato soup because thats what I wound up with! Very bland! I followed the recipie exactly then I had to add a bunch of stuff to it to make it an awsome soup recipie. I will be writing up what I added which is ALOT and will post it as a seperate recipie. I also hate when someone rates only after they changed the origional. So anyways 2 stars as written 5 stars after I got done with it.

Good flavor, but would need quite a few modifications. I figured I'd try the original recipe first just to give it a shot and decide from there.  It turned out bland and watery. The potatoes weren't all the way done but I think having the pan underneath was preventing that.  Next time i'll deffinatly add more garlic, and maybe even red pepper flakes, and some onion. And instead of 2 cups of milk, maybe only 1 and some sour cream. Over all, it had good flavor, but wasn't one of my favorites.

I had to make some changes to original recipe since as is the dish is soupy, it seems to be missing something and the potatoes aren't done. Instead of creamed soup I added cream corn and added 2 Tbsp flour, I also added 1/4 cup diced onions as others had mentioned and parboiled the potatoes. Then for last 5-10 minutes of baking topped with grated cheddar. Much better flavor and I will make it again.

Very delicious!!  I used celery soup.  My only complaint is that it was kind of salty.  Next time i will use reduced sodium soup and kielbasa.  Also, it was a little soupy.  I would recommend letting it sit a while or using only one cup of milk.  All in all very tasty! I will definitely make again! Thanks!

This was very filling.  I used cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of mushroom since we don't like the taste.  I also used red potatoes because I was out of russet.  Because the potatoes were smaller I only had to bake for about 70 minutes.  Next time I won't put as much milk in.  Seemed a little watery.  Thanks Geneva!

Three stars on the original recipe. I agree, great idea, but lacked flavor. Five stars with changes. I made a simple roux by using equal parts of butter and flour.I mixed in some chicken broth and some milk. I added salt for flavor. I mixed in a handful of cheese. I sauteed onions with some garlic, then added sausage. I mixed the sausage in the roux. I layered the potatoes, spread the sauce, then layered again and finished with the sauce. With these changes, my family really loved it and I will make again.

Followed some previous suggestions:  1) Fried the kielbasa with one small sliced onion and the minced garlic before adding to sauce.  2) Used 1 1/2 cups milk instead of 2 cups.  3) Added just a dash of salt.  Can't imagine using the whole teaspoon!  Will probably make again.

I made this dish for a recent gathering thinking the men would enjoy it but even the ladies liked it.  Simple to prepare and very tasty.

I should have read the reviews before I made this recipe. I was hoping I could use the idea for a recipe for our store ad. It was far too runny as many others had suggested. (Sometimes the potatoes will cause that.) It was too much for a 9-inch square baking dish - perhaps a 13 x 9-inch pan would give greater surface area and allow it to dry up better - then one wouldn't need the baking sheet. IF I ever make this again, I will use 1 cup milk. I always look at the salt and never add it when I think the dish will be too salty. This would have been the case with this one. I added drained canned mushrooms. Onions would have been good too.

Comforting and easy casserole.  I made a few changes and am glad I did or I fear it might not been as tasty.  I substituted cream of chicken soup (out of mushroom), added about 4 oz. of cream cheese to the sauce mixture, as well as garlic powder, dried minced onion and cajun seasoning.  I will use even more seasoning next time.  I made it in 2 layers and topped each layer with grated cheese too.  Not real healthy, but sure tasted good!

I thought this sounded like it would be good. I'm sorry I made it. This has got to be one of the most disgusting meals, I have ever had the misfortune of trying. All I could taste was the grease from the sausage, and my mom and I also agreed, it had a funny taste.

I wasn't to sure about how it tasted.  It needed something the taste was kinda BLAH.  When I make it again I'll probably add some veggies for flavor....and something to kick up the texture.  I did add cheese towards the end and liked that.  The next day I stared at the left overs not really excited about it, BUT it does taste better re-heated like others have stated.

This is a great way to wake up in the morning! I used polska kielbasa (we love it) and per other reviews, I added some dry minced onion and some sharp shredded cheddar cheese during the last 10 min to melt. Yum good! Since I cubed the potatoes small, we had no problems of them being undercooked. One small bit of advice, be sure to grease your baking dish well-even though I greased it, some of the potatoes still stuck to the dish. However, this did not detract from the taste. Would make this again!

My family likes this dish. I have to use a 13x9 pan, though, and I cube my kielbasa along with the potatoes. The sauce will thicken a little upon standing. It is strong on garlic, but we like that!

I thought this recipe was excellent! Definitely a "do-over" (meaning make it again, and again, and .......) The only thing I did differently was to add onion, simply because we like onion in nearly everything we make.

Not great but also not bad.  I boiled the potatoes first, browned the sausage, cut milk in half, and added carrots and tomatoes.  I'll probably make again but this isn't a recipe I'd brag about.

This has become a favorite in our household. I grew up with my grandmother making Kielbasa and potatoes for my grandfather once a week. This is a modern version to her dish. It also doesn't take long to make. When I am in a hurry, I fry the kielbasa until it's brown, boil the potatoes for 10 minutes, then follow the recipe. Adding those extra steps means less time in the oven. Dinner is ready in less than an hour. My Italian husband and kids love it.

It's a good thing I made a double recipe the first time I made this. It was really good and the boyfriend really liked it as well. I followed the recipe pretty much through and through, just added more garlic and I had one less potato on hand. Great with cheddar cheese on top. If you have guests, this would be great with baked rolls and some sort of veggies on the side! Next time, I would add less salt. I'll definitely be making this again!

I took what I thought were the best suggestions from all the comments.  I used sweet potatoes instead of potatoes, I added some sharp cheddar, I left out the salt (thank goodness, very salty anyway).

Like others have said, it was quite "soupy" but if you make it, do yourself a favour and make sure you serve that soup.  The broth is where all the best flavour is.

Would definitely make this with sweet potatoes again.  Delicious.  Might try it without cheese net time.  It was good and gooey, but I'm not sure it's necessary.

Leftovers were just as good the next day!  I mostly followed the recipe, except that I did add a sauted onion and added only 1 cup of milk.  I did microwave the potato slices ahead of time for a couple of minutes to cut down on the baking time.  I ended up baking it about 50 minutes.

Really good - especially considering how easy it was.  Only changes were using turkey kielbasa and did add a generous sprinkling of garlic powder (based on others' reviews of it being bland).  Must've done the trick because it wasn't bland at all.  Will definitely make it again,

This was sooo good.  Lots of flavor.  Very satisfying.  I used Cream of Celery as suggested by another reviewer.

I absolutely love this recipe, I only made one small change and added some shredded cheese and placed back in the oven to melt. Gives a little extra flavor and the kids love it. You can also use a little lemon pepper to add a little tang. Husband will even make this meal for us. Great for cold days.

I really liked this, my husband's only complaint was that the kielbasa was sliced to thin, so I will chunck it up a bit next time. I did cube the potatoes. Very good!

This recipe is so good with changes i made after reading other reviews. I sliced and parboiled the potatoes and added sliced peppers and onions. Omitted the salt. Used one can of milk (using the soup can to measure) and stirred in a can of french fried onions. Topped with 2 cups of shredded cheddar and baked 1 hour. I also let it set for about an hour before serving to allow to thicken. This will be going into my regular rotation. Delicious!

Went with alot of reviews on this one. Omitted the salt and added basil and pepper. Fried the Kielbasa with an onion and garlic. Boiled potatoes and broccoli for 10mins. And only used a cup of milk and used cream of celery instead of the mush. This is a sturdy Kielbasa meal and will be making again. As written 2 stars as rewiews written 4 so I went in the middle.

I made this last night for my family for dinner.  I made a few adjustments to the original recipe though.  First, I fried the Kielbasa and potato slices with Tastefully Simple's Onion, Onion as well as minced garlic until the potatoes and kielbasa started to brown a bit and become tender.  I used Cream of Celery soup and 1 can of milk.  I added a couple handfuls of shredded sharp cheddar cheese then mixed in the kielbasa and potatoes.  I added extra of the onion onion spice and minced garlic.  I put it in the oven for 30 minutes then topped with french fried onions and additional shredded sharp cheddar cheese and put back in the oven for 15 minutes.  With these changes, it was delicious!  Not only did my husband love it but my 4 year old daughter and my 10 month old daughter loved it as well!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was super yummy, tasted just like scalloped potatoes with kielbasa added to it.  We did do three things differently:  we omitted the salt, we sliced the potatoes thinly (maybe 1/4") instead of cubing them and we added 1/2 c of cheddar cheese.  We will definitely be making this again!

I kinda doubled this. 3 links of kielbasa, the lite kind. 8 cups of potatoes and doubled the rest. Needs a little less milk, and I used cream of celery soup. (My kids don't like musrooms.) Over all it was a nice change to the normal potatoe and kielbasa dinner. next time I'll make a few more changes... add corn and onions and mix all in a very large bowl. I layered it this time (potatoe, kielbasa, soup and then repeated) and topped with shredded cheese. It didn't work so great. I also used my convection oven (400 for 1hour) needed just a bit more time.

Very yummy!  I sauted the kielbasa and garlic before adding it to everything.  Will definately make again.  Was a little runny, next time I may use less liquid, hubby likes thicker sauces!

Simple and delicious! Everyone in my family enjoyed this even two picky toddlers. I added a chopped onion and green bell pepper and cooked them with a little butter. Then I added a handful of shredded cheddar on top the last five minutes of baking. A little cheese makes everything taste even better. I'll be making this many more times, It's a keeper!

This was great!  I did follow a few suggetions, browned the kielbasa on both sides, fired an onion and added to mixture, left the salt out and sliced the potatoes thin.  I tried this with less milk and the full amount of milk  I think the difference is that I stired this while cooking twice.  Without the full recipe milk it was dry, but it is because I mixed it twice while cooking.

This recipe is the best I have ever tried!!!! I ALWAYS add a large chopped onion into the bake for an amazing added flavor, but I have even used this recipe in a fundraising dinner event, and was asked for the recipe over and over!!! We sold over 50 dinners!!!

very yummy, my husband had seconds.  gave it 4 stars because I changed the recipe a bit.  only added 1/2 can of milk like other reviewers suggested.  I fried the kielbasa first with the garlic and pepper to make it a bit crispy.  I omitted the salt and it was plenty salty.  I also sliced the potatoes very thin and added a layer of chedder cheese and crushed ritz crackers to the top (I think that really made it great!).  I will definately make again!  Great comfort food.

This was great! Although I read all the reviews first so I got a general idea of the dislikes so I could make it perfect.  Indeed I did sautee the kielbasa, onions, and potatoes.  Since my husband is diabetic I needed a vegetable to make it more "well rounded" and brocoli is really really good with it.  I definately recomend this recipe!

I added some thinly sliced onions before baking. I thought this was a OK recipe. I think I will try again but fry the sausage a little, maybe that will give it more flavor.

Great recipe with a few changes.  Made for a large crowd, so added more potatoes and an extra can of soup (Cream of Celery) and used only 1 can of milk. Also added chopped onions.  Was excellent!  Everyone wanted the recipe!

This is really good. Per other reviews, I decreased the amount of milk to one soup can and that was plenty - even then it was still a bit soupy - could've added more potatoes though. Didn't think I'd be able to taste the garlic over the kielbasa but it's definitely there. It was done in an hour. I put some cheese over the top the last 5 minutes. Very nice - will add to the potluck rotation!

This came out pretty good, but I made a few changes.  I only used a soup can full of milk and threw in a good handful of shredded cheddar.  Also, I used the Golden Mushroom soup, which has a little more flavor than the regular cream of mushroom.  I sliced the potatoes thin and the cooking time was fine.  Then let it sit for 15 minutes or so before diving in.  Good start to a recipe that can be changed to suit your taste, but 2 cups milk is definitely too much.  I think you could throw in a beaten egg to help hold it together also.

This recipe was very good, just a little shy of 5 stars though.  I found that boiling the potatoes for a few minutes while I cut the sausage and combined the other ingredients really cut down on the oven cook time. I think this is why I also found this recipe a bit runny, but I didn't really think that was so bad.  We just ate it in bowls instead of on plates, and had a little bread to mop up the sauce at the end.  I skipped the salt because I thought the sausage would be plenty salty, and it was.  The smell and taste of this dish were very good, and we'll definitely make it again, but we just sort of felt like 5 stars was a bit too generous

Came out soupy.  I added onions to the mix, and it tasted ok.  I may mess around with this recipe and try it again to see what I can do differently.

This is great for a cold winter day.  My husband even had seconds!  I added celery and onion, which added a lot to the dish.  Thanks.

I will have to make again.  Had to leave and turned the oven off when it was nearly done.  Good flavor but it was a bit runny.

This dish smelled heavenly while cooking, so I was very excited to sit down to dinner.  Like others have said, it was just too salty.  And, I like salt!  But, even though I did NOT add the tsp. of salt the recipe called for, and used Campbell's Healthy Request (low fat/low sodium) Cream of Chicken Soup, the flavor was overwhelmingly salty.  I used turkey kielbasa, diced red skin potatoes, added chopped onion and celery, a dash of cayenne, and substited 1 C. Milk with 1 C. low fat Sour Cream.  I  mixed in about a C. of shredded cheddar, too.   It looked great, and smelled even better, but my husband and kids ended up ordering Chinese Take Out instead.  Bummer. I gave it two stars for the aroma, and the ease of preparation.  I'd like to try it again, but I don't know how else to eliminate the salt/sodium.  Do they make low sodium kielbasa?  I doubt it.

I thought this was fantastic! (so did my room mate!) I made this for dinner. I added sliced onions, sliced mushrooms, diced red bell peppers, minced garlic(1 huge clove), and diced celery. I had no cream of mushroom soup, so used cream of chicken to which I added the milk, a couple of good shakes of cajun-style seasoning, some corn starch (to aid thickening) and about a tblsp. of marsala cooking wine. I followed the temp. and cooking time exactly. What a great dinner we had! Served it with some fresh, crusty bread and chilled merlot. Can't wait to make this again. Thanks Geneva!

This was very good, although I had to bake it for almost 2 hrs.  I also added some cream cheese to it as someone else suggested.

This had a good taste but way too salty.  Next time I will leave the salt out completely.  I followed the ingredients exactly and only had to cook for an hour which was perfect.  Make sure you cube you potatoes small and watch them so they do not get mushy.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I used two very large russets which I diced small, and a 14 ounce piece of kielbasa.  I used a little less milk, but kept everything else the same.  I don't own a 7X11 dish, so used my 9X11 cake pan and this came out perfect!

My husband claims this is a KEEPER.

This was okay. It took nearly an hour longer to cook than what the recipe said- after about an hour and a half it was still swimming in sauce. I turned up the heat a little and took the cookie sheet out from under the casserole dish. After that it started to cook better, and much of the soupy liquid that was there cooked off, thankfully. I added cheddar cheese on top at the end of cooking and let it melt. I was glad I did, because I think it wouldn't have tasted as good without it. Will probably not make again. It could probably use the addition of some veggies or something else. A little too boring with just potatoes and kielbasa.

Wow! Delicious! I used smoked sausage and added a 14 cup of chopped onions to the recipe. I had two big helpings. I normally don't care for the taste of sausage, but with this recipe it was great.

The flavor in this dish was excellent!  I used cheddar soup and added a dash of cayenne pepper and onion salt in addition to the spices that were called for.  Yum!!  The only problem was that mine came out pretty soupy.  I am not sure what the cause of this was.  I'd welcome suggestions!  Maybe next time I will cut down on the milk a little bit.  Overall I would highly recommend this dish, though!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I did add some sliced onions, but I baked it for the time stated and had no problems at all.  It was great.  Even better the next day!  Very creamy and a hearty meal for these cold winter months in NY.  A great pot luck.

I thought this was good but my husband loved it. I added cheddar cheese, as some of the other reviewers had suggested, and also a thinly sliced onion and garlic. I topped it off with more cheese. I will definitely make this again for my family.

Used a little less milk and sliced the potatoes, instead of cubing.  The family really enjoyed it.  It was so easy to fix and only took 1 hour for the casserole to bake.

Okay is it just me or do you have to bake it almost double what the recipe says?
The tase is pretty decent, i left out the lemon pepper....  I baked it for about 30 minutes longer than it says to and the potatoes are still not done!
Won't be making again, sorry : (

There is no way this receipe can be correct. I baked this 1 hour longer than the receipe called for, because it was soupy and the potatoes never got soft. This receipe needs to be revised to read: Boil cubed potatoes 8-10 minutes. Add 4 beaten eggs or 1 carton egg substitute. That will hold everything together. After adjustments...was good!

It had great flavor but a little too much.  
 If I make it again I will cut the garlic in half and probably the salt and pepper, too.

Prebake your oiled and cubed potatoes (with Paprika and Pepper) at 425' for 20min, stir, return to oven for 10 min, than add the rest(all heated in microwave so as not to crack your glassware) and return to oven now lowered to 375'. (that way it comes out creamy, not all dried out) Much yummier! I used less milk and subbed salt with celery salt and added sliced cheddar as an afterthought.

The whole family loved this! I had 2 pieces of bacon to use up so I fried them in my large cast iron skillet. I removed them when browned but not done. I fried the onion in the bacon grease. I then browned the sausage slices. To the soup/milk mixture I added a pinch of onion and garlic powder and pepper. (No salt needed). I put the potatoes in the soup mixture, poured it in the cast iron skillet and mixed well. I cut the bacon into small pieces and combined with the mixture.  I baked it in my cast iron skillet at the same temperature and for the same amount of time as the recipe. The sauce soaked into the potatoes and the top browned beautifully. The potatoes were soft and the sausage was tender. Yum!

I give this a 4 star rating because I made changes.
Like others I par cooked the potatoes in boiling salted water.  While doing that--in a skillet--I cooked the kielbasa with onion, and added garlic at the last minute.  
I added cheese to the final mixture, before placing in oven.  And 10-15 minutes before I remove it from the oven I sprinkle cheese on top--then finish baking.

Parboiling potatoes cut the time to 40 minutes, I added some partially fried thick sliced bacon, (cut back salt) at 20 minutes I added Trader Joe's precooked brussel sprouts..... outrageous....!!!!

My family wasn't thinking they wanted anything to do with kielbasa but they ate the entire thing, I did add broccoli and some cheddar cheese. It's an easy quick dinner.

My husband and I both loved this.  It's creamy and reminds me of something my Mom made when I was younger.  I was a little concerned about it being bland after reading some of the reviews, so I added an onion and sprinkled some cayenne pepper on it.  Also used ham instead of the kielbasa just because that's what I had.  I baked it covered for an hour, took the foil off and baked for 15 more minutes, added some cheddar cheese on top and cooked it 15 more minutes.  Mwah!  Perfection.

My mom has always made a recipe just like this one, only she adds onions. Perhaps that is the missing flavor people are looking for? I made this, but with sliced onions, as I am accustomed, and it was great as expected.

Our family liked it as written however I made it again and added grated cheese and minced onion and garlic and pats of butter then topped with slightly damp stove top stuffing...
Great recipe that you can tweak to families liking or whole new concept! ...

Beyond delicious!! I recommend not adding the salt, it was plenty salty as is. I didn't have a problem with it being too soupy, I actually had to use the full amount of milk. I did add some sour cream as well. This was a huge hit with my husband and 6 year old and super easy to make. Definitely a keeper!

before I put the potatoes in the sauce I tasted the sauce and it tasted like a clump a garlic with milk, so I decided to add my own touch. I added some ginger, red pepper, and some lemon pepper seasoning. then I tasted it again, and it actually had flavor. so try adding spices and different things, what I added is not for everyone, so keep trying things.

Superb dish. I only used half the salt, replaced 1/2 cup of the milk with sour cream, used red potatoes instead of white and added 10 degrees F temp and 10 minutes more to the cook time due to our higher elevation and electric oven requirements. It was smooth, creamy and captured the true essence of the kielbasa. Next time you feel like fixing scalloped potatoes, fix this instead. You will be glad you did!

No spoons on this one. I used the Kielbasa (polish Hillshire band), 4 potatoes, milk, mushroom soup and seasonings, baked it for the 90 minutes and it is the most watery I have ever seen! The picture is so white and nice looking and I used whole milk, and it was nice and white when it went in the oven but like I said it was watery and filmie when it came out of the oven. LOL

It was awesome. Added chopped red bell pepper to give it a little extra pizzaz and various seasonings, including an Italian blend. I also added the 1/2 cup sour cream, like the other reviewers suggested and LESS milk, maybe 1 cup or even slightly less. Next time I'll be forced to use a smoked or spicy sausage instead of kielbasa, due to the fact that hubby does NOT like kielbasa...you would think I'd know that by now lol.

I cut the recipe in half because it is just my mom and I. It was very good. The potatoes and keilbasa were tender and flavorful. It was super easy to make. I just needed to look at my recipes early. The hour and half bake time put dinner a little late. Lol! I might add some carrots or broccoli next time.

The whole family loved this hearty casserole! I added in a few extra ingredients...half a chopped onion, one can of sliced mushrooms,then toppped it with some parmesan cheese, along with some shredded colby jack cheese on top during the last ten minutes of baking time. I also covered the dish with aluminum foil. Absolutely superb! Yum!

Like previous comments, I boiled the potatoes, used almost a whole can of low fat milk, omitted the salt (enough in the soup & sausage), added a couple potatoes, used condensed chicken soup,  didn't measure garlic powder and fresh cracked black pepper. All in all, pretty tasty. Didn't get all stars cuz 8 servings?! Really? For whom? This fed 3 teenage boys & one preschooler. Will use this recipe again- double or triple!! = ]

This was tasty but all the reviews were pretty accurate.  I turned mine into potato soup because it just would not thicken.  I sprinkled some shredded cheese and we ate with spoons :)

this was delicious.  i added i cup of sour cream, instead of the second cup of milk.  i also sprinkles shredded swiss cheese on top.  mine seemed to cook a bit faster than the cooking time suggested (mine was done in an hour). i did not add any salt, since the soup/kielbasa/cheese have enough salt.

Great Idea but I can't do this to home made kielbasa! That's gotta be eaten cold with red beet horseradish! I have long cheated this idea with sweet italian sausage and a box of au gratin potatoes. It's quick and yummy but this works for a more home made appeal.

I made this as directed, and while it was alright, It was not a big hit in my house. It was worth a shot though, but I doubt I'll be making this again. If I do, I would defenitly use more Kielbasa, and maybe some other ingredients as well.

This didn't turn out as good as I thought it would. Not bad, just not over the top kind of bland for me, I ended up adding some cheese to the top.

I enjoyed this but it was done after 70 minutes cooking [would have had to cover with foil or let it burn] and as my potatoes were not very large I used less milk, about 1 1/2 cups.

One of the nice things about this recipe is that it is so customizable.  I used probably about a can and a half of milk, thinly sliced the potatos on a mandolin, added some thyme and parsely, browned the sausage with some onion and added some frozen mixed vegatables, mixing it all in a 13x9x2.  Threw some cheddar on top during the last few minutes and it made a very tasty cassarole.  Can't go wrong.

This recipe was really good and really easy.  My husband said it reminded him of something his mom would make. I take that as a really great compliment.  The only thing I did differently was I sauteed the potatoes for about 10 minutes while I prepared everything else. So I only cooked it in the over for about a half hour.  90 minutes is too long to wait!

I thought this was a really good recipe.  I added some frozen green beans just to use them up, and also added about a cup of sour cream and cheddar on top (the last 15 minutes). Cheezy, creamy, flavorful!

After the previous reviews, 4 out of 5 stars, I anticipate a delightful dish.  Unfortunately, it was bland and not palatable in the least. After disposing we opted for take-out. I will not be making again.

as written, the recipe is lacking (except in saltiness.) With changes suggested by others the recipe was at least "4-stars."  I added only one soup can of milk to prevent soupiness. I also didnt add salt and used garlic powder, minced onion, and a bit a mrs. dash to help with flavor. I also added mushrooms because we love them!  I thinly sliced the potatoes and it took about 45 min at 375. My fiance loved it and he isnt easy to please!!

This was easy and tasty with some additional cayenne pepper, fresh garlic, and topped at the end with cheddar cheese and french fried onions. Also used 3/4 C milk and 3/4 C sour cream. Par-boiled the potatoes first and it only took a half hour to cook.

First of all, I used red potatoes instead of the russet and it turned out to be pretty tasty. I used one can of milk, omitted the salt, used about four cloves of garlic, sauteed the kielbasa prior to baking and added cheddar cheese to the top the last ten minutes of baking. I also sprinkled parsley on the top to give it some color and a little added flavor. My husband liked it, had seconds, then took the leftovers to work the next day!

I'm giving this a 5, not because it's the best thing I've ever tasted, but for the amount and affordability of the ingredients, this tasted dang good.  I only used one cup of milk and sauteed the kielbasa and garlic ahead of time.  I also added cheese to the top at the end.  Tasted like meat and potatoes comfort food.

The taste of this recipe was excellent!  The flavor of the Kielbasa was absorbed into the potatoes, which were cooked to perfection.  We followed the recipe exactly--the only issue I had was that when we dug into the dish it was a bit watery. Not really sure how to correct that.  Otherwise, my family (including 3 kids under 6) loved it, and we definitely plan on making again!

This recipe was very good.  The only changes I made was I didn't put in any additional salt and instead of cubing the potatoes, I sliced them thin.  Also, at the very end of cooking, I topped the casserole with a little bit of grated cheddar cheese.

Ok, yum!  My 2 year old just ate her whole bowl...  And everyone else liked it too!  I thought it had just enough flavor to be good.  And with stuff already in the house.  Great for busy evenings!  I did use cream of chicken, cuz that's what I had in the pantry.

We really enjoy this recipe.  We have made it several times.  It is a good comfort food.  It is one of those dishes that hits the spot on a cold winter evening.  It is also very easy to fix, which is a plus when you don't have a lot of time after getting home from work.

I ended up following some of the suggestions of the other reviewers and cooked the kielbasa with onions and garlic in a skillet before adding it to the bowl to mix with the other ingredients.  I also scalloped the potatoes instead and used half a cup of milk instead of the two cups as listed.  I also omitted most of the salt but sprinkled some grated parmesan cheese during the last five minutes of baking.  It was finished baking after 50 minutes.  I thought it was ok, but even though I had used very little salt, it still came out very salty which wasn't too much of a surprise since the kielbasa itself is already salty alone.  Overall I felt like this dish was somewhat boring and plain.  I will not be making this again.

Not bad.  I followed other reviewers advise and cut back on milk.  I ended up using about 3/4 of a soup can full, and if I make it again I will use even less.  I wanted more of a casserole outcome and it was still soupy.  I added 1/2 cup cheddar and used the new Del Monte canned diced potatoes (2 cans) which made it real easy and cut the cooking time down by 45 minutes!

This was pretty good- my hubby loved it. I took the advice of others and put in about a soup can full of milk, tossed in some cheddar cheese and sliced the potatoes.  It was done in about an hour.  Good recipe!

Verry gooood.  I added about 3 large cloves of garlic though, because I like it alot.  Everyone in the family really enjoyed it.  I made it for dinner and it was done in about a hour.

I had my doubts about this one ... but it came out great. Family loved it. Since, I love garlic I used the cream of mushroom with rosted garlic in this receipe. Next time I will scallop the potatoes rather then cube them. As far as the milk .. it depends on how you like it .. runny or dry.

I also used less milk and plan to use even less (maybe 1/2 a can) next time, I also plan to use less garlic next time. MY daughters picky taste buds even went for seconds!

This was quite good.  I, too, cut back to 1 cup of milk.  I wish I'd thown in some cheese to - but will next time.  Hubby & son really liked it - both helped themselves to seconds.  A great recipe to use up that bag of potatoes!  And did I mention that it really smells wonderful while it bakes?

My husband and I both loved this recipie.  From reading the other reviews I cut down on the milk to 3/4 of the cr. of mushroom soup can.  Turned out perfect!

This smelled good while it was cooking, but I was disappointed with the actual dish. I just didn't like the flavors. I sliced the potatoes super thin so they would cook quickly. Husband thought it was 'just ok.' I doubt I'll make this again, but thanks anyway.

Wow, I can't believe how good this is. My husband tried it and couldn't keep from eating it. The only thing that I changed was that I added alittle more milk and added onion powder. This would be good for a side dish, like steak. The servings are small if you want to serve it as a main dish, which is what I did. The 8 servings is good for about 3 or 4 people depending how much they eat. This is a keeper in my recipe box and I printed it out. Thanks 5 star all the way !!!

Easy. I added some fresh parsley and increased the garlic. Cut back on cooking time, I baked for 1 hour 15 min.

I hate being the negative one, but I didn't like this at all. I thought it was terrible and ended up throwing away the rest of what we didn't eat, which was a lot. I don't know where to start: thought the tbsp of garlic was a little too much - other than for the garlic, it was pretty bland. I stirred it a few times while it cooked and let it stand for 10 minutes after I took it out of the oven, as someone suggested, and it didn't come out soupy at all. Sorry. The vast majority of reviewers seemed to enjoy this... guess you just have to taste it for yourself.

This was just "ok"  - my husband said he'd rather have just had potatoes and kielbasa.  I sliced the potatoes scallop style and it was done in 1 hour.  A 7x11 pan is not big enough - I only used 3 potatoes and still  had to use a 9x13 pan.

This is an excellent, easy recipe.  My son is a super picky eater and said it was good!  The thing that would have helped me, though, is if the recipe said to let sit about 10 min. after removing from oven to thicken.  I topped the leftovers with cheddar cheese which was also yummy!

Sorry, but I really did not enjoy this recipe.  I'm Polish and my father brought me some authentic kielbasa from a Polish deli.  I was looking forward to trying a different recipe with the kielbasa, so I found this one, and followed it perfectly.  It took a fairly long time to cook (1 1/2 hours in the oven) and it came out OK, but I didn't think it was anything special.

Wonderful recipe! I made this exactly as directed and found this to be an easy to make and delicious dish. I froze some for my husband's lunch later in the week. He thought it tasted even better the second time around.

Me and my husband liked this recipe pretty good!  Could have used a little more liquid but overall I would make it again!
