I'm confused by those who say this recipe doesn't compare to real cheesecake, or it almost tastes like cheesecake, or this is easier to make then cheesecake, etc.  This IS cheesecake! The filling is classic ingredients with standard amounts and ratios of ingredients. The crust is rich, light and flavorful, and the nuts, which I chopped finely, gave these another dimension of flavor.  I doubled the filling mixture and was happy I did.  I used the lemon juice called for and it was perfect, especially since I swirled blueberry preserves through the filling before I baked it.  This is creamy and delicious, and my addition of swirling the preserves throughout gave this a little flavor boost. I can't wait to make flavor variations with this!

Couple of notes - definitely double the filling if you're serving this as a dessert (9-12 servings rather than the 36 it says), but if you're making it to cut into teeny squares as party refreshments or something, you're probably okay as is.  Also, as every cheesecake-baker knows, the cream cheese will blend better if softened.  Don't melt it, as one reviewer suggested.  This is pretty easy and good, but I don't really love the lemon flavor and would probably leave it out if I made it again.  My family didn't agree with me however, my mom in particular loved the lemon. So it's all a matter of personal preference!  Just note that it IS a noticeable flavor, so if lemon's not your favorite, definitely omit it.

Very quick, very easy.  I used a muffin tin instead of an 8x8 pan and they came out beautifully.  Nice for individual servings.

Here are a couple tips for cheesecake beginners: 1) Make sure that all the ingredients are at room temperature before mixing. 2) Cream the cream cheese first, then add in sugar. Mix just until smooth (NOT fluffy!). 3) Hand-mixing is more preferable than using an electric mixer, because this way you can avoid incorporating too much air into the batter, which results in bubbles and cracks in the final product. However, if you insist on using an electric mixer or a stand mixer, keep the speed on low (with the exception of medium-low for creaming the cheese) and scrape the bowl frequently. 4) Well grease the pan before baking in order to prevent cracking. 5) When pouring the batter onto the crust, pass it through a sieve and use a rubber spatula to break down any lumps. 6) If you want to double the filling as some other reviewers have suggested, bake at 300 degree F for 35 - 40 minutes, or until the cheesecake is set 2 inches from edge but the center still looks a bit wet. Do NOT open the oven door while baking. Take the cheesecake out of the oven immediately after it is done (do NOT leave it in the oven like you will do with a regular cheesecake) and cool on a wire rack. It tastes best after being refrigerated for one day. I hope these tips are helpful for you!

Everyone had a fit about this recipe, especially my husband who loves cheesecake.  The crust is like a shortbread and very buttery tasting.  One thing I did that I won't do next time is I pressed the crumb mixture down in the pan pretty hard, making it harder to remove the bars when they were done. Once I got them out, though, they were fantastic!  Another thing I'll do is cook them just a tad longer, maybe 5 minutes.  They were a little soft unless I kept them refrigerated until right before serving.  Not much of a problem, though, since they disappeared so quickly!! This one is a keeper for sure!

This cheesecake bar was easy to make and tasted just like cheesecake.  I omitted the chopped walmuts for the crust and it turned out great.  I will definitely make this again!

Very easy and quite yummy!  To "dress-up" my bars, I drizzled melted chocolate, white chocolate, and seedless raspberry jam on top, then cut them into triangles.  It looked like I had spent lots of time on them, but I didn't!  Thanks for the recipe, Frances!

This recipe came out fabulously.  I substituted toasted almonds for the walnuts in the crust.  I also doubled the filling recipe, and added 1 tsp cinnamon to the filling.  I cooked for 40 minutes because of the extra filling.  Everyone loved it!

A quick and easy way to make cheesecake when you have the craving!  These are so good.  You definitely don't get 36 servings out of an 8 inch pan though.  I can't wait to try these again with different toppings!

this was the first time i ever dared to make a cheesecake and i must say, everyone was extremely impressed. based on some others review i doubled the filling and used cupcake tins instead of a baking pan. these were perfect for individual cheesecakes and everyone loved them. for some extra flare i drizzled them with rasberry and white chocolate topping. i will definitely make these again!

I had to double the recipe because it didn't make enough filling. I also used graham crackers ground up with butter to make the crust. Very tasty indeed.

The operative word here is "bars." It's not meant to be a cheesecake. The filling is purposefully made thin. Think of it "finger-food cheesecake." I usually save out about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of the crumb crust mixture, and sprinkle it over the top of the filling before baking. This gives a crunch when you bite in, which supplies delightful counterpoint to the soft filling. These always go super fast.

I doubled the filling and am definitely glad I did.  When I make them again, I will spray the pan with cooking spray or line with foil or parchment as I had a heck of a time getting them to come out of the pan.  I used a sharp knife dipped in hot water to cut and wiped the knife clean between cuts.  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.

Great recipe!  I made a lot of modifications though, first off I made single servings in foil muffin cups.  I mixed 2tbsp butter and 1tbsp sugar with crushed graham crackers and put a tablespoon of the mixture into the bottom of the cups.  Then I packed them with my fingers.  Then I tripled the recipe for the filling and ommitted the lemon.  I baked for 24 minutes at 350 and it was PERFECT!  This was my first attempt and I was very pleasantly surprised!  Also I made a batch with chocolate graham cracker crust and put chocolate chips & rasberry jam on top of those.  DELISH!  Also adding about 2 1/2 teaspoons of cocoa powder into the filling makes a delicious chocolate cheesecake!

I loved this recipe, however I did take advice on the reviews and I made it with a graham cracker crust, I made it in a 9x13 pan so I tripled the filling recipe (also recommended in the reviews.) I cut out the lemon and replaced it with almond extract along with the vanilla and I bake it at a lower temp...300 for 45 mins. I thawed out some strawberries and mixed them with sugar for a topping.  This was a good recipe with all the recommendations I was able to make the perfect cheesecake bars to feed a crowd!

Doubled filling (this is almost the america's test kitchen filling sub'ing milk for sour cream). Used the top rated graham cracker crust and doubled volume for a 9x13. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes. Swirled homemade strawberry topping on top. Received a number of compliments even though it wasn't made known I had made it. People went out of their way to find out who had made it. Thanks!

Yummy! I've made cheesecake before...Cheesecake in a Springform pan; cheesecake 'cupcakes' but so far this is the best kind of cheesecake I've ever made. :D

Like others suggested, I doubled the filling, then baked for 30 mins, and turned it off and let it cool in oven for 1.5hours, refrigerated when fully cooled and it was delish! Perfectly browned around the edges with minimal cracks. :D

Note: I substituted the 1/3c walnuts with a handful of almonds & a pack of Lornadoones (Shortbread cookie). I also omitted the lemon.

Not bad.  Cheesecake flavor in an easy to make bar.  I wasn't overly fond of the pastry bottom, or the filling itself, as it was not as rich and decadent as a good cheesecake is.  I did double the filling- and thank god I did because it still didn't seem like enough- I can't imagine how thin these bars would have been as written.  My advice- don't make them without doubling the filling! Were they easy- yes!  And that was their saving grace.  I needed a dessert in a hurry, and they did come out of the pan beautifully.  I served them drizzled with a Mango sauce which helped dress them up. A good recipe in a pinch, but not as satisfying as a real cheesecake.

Simplicity is the real value of this recipe. I find it better to beat the cream cheese alone. That eliminates most of the lumps. Then add the remaining ingredients.  Also, let the cream cheese set out until it comes to rooms temperature.

OMG!! These are so awesome. The only tips i would give are #1 (A MUST DO) Toast the nuts slightly before adding to the crust. Its makes all the difference in the world!!! #2 Definately double the filling recipie. #3 Swirl in a cup of smuckers cherry preserves before baking (bake a little longer, 10 min or so). Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm!

Success. Bake only until the middle starts to become not jiggly on the top. The edges should not brown. A toothpick will NOT come out clean. Let cool & refrigerate before cutting. Creamy and wonderful instead of spongy and eggy. Thanks!

I took the advice of several reviewers and doubled the cream cheese filling, very glad I did! Otherwise I don't think you'd have enough. I also made a graham cracker crust instead of the one specified...just a personal preference in my household...we like graham cracker crusts with our cheesecake. The filling is fluffy and rich, very good! Will definitely make again! :)

Did not care for the crust on these.  I guess that is just a matter of taste.

So easy! So good!! I love this recipe because it is simple and just awesome. Sometimes I add fruit to it before I bake it! Love this plain, and love this with blueberries!

For this recipe to be successful one must follow these three main rules: 1) Double the filling - When doubling the ingredients double all ingredients except use one egg to avoid an eggy taste. 2) Refrigerate for atleast three hours before consuming. Taste great when you make it in the evening and consume it the following afternoon. 3) this recipe makes 36 cubes not bars lol. The cubes are great for appetizers.  This recipe was great except I used whole wheat flour and crushed almonds. Instead of butter I used peanut oil which gave the crust a nice nutty taste.  I also used organic soymilk and omitted lemon juice due to the recommendation of others.  I intend to use this recipe repeatedly it was simple quick and delicious.  Also very economical.

Very good recipe!  I doubled the filling because the bars would be way too flat. I also increased the baking time to about 15-20 mins. since the recipe is doubled.  After refrigerating for a few hours, these bars are amazing.  I made some strawberry coulis and family members who like the fruit, added it. But some prefer it plain.  I did not use the crust on top of the bars...I used the entire amount to cover the bottom of the square pan.  Great recipe...it's a keeper!

I made this a few weeks ago but I made them in a 9x13 pan.  I doubled the crust and tripled the filling.  They were such a big hit my MIL requested I make them again for Thanksgiving.

I used this as a basis for white chocolate cheesecake bars and added 1 oz of shredded white chocolate bar inside and 1 oz on top after it cooled. Next time I'll add 2 oz inside. I took others advice and ground the nuts in a food processor. I put parchement paper on the bottom of the pan, with a little butter on the sides and the bars came out easily. Cut in little squares and it's just the perfect amount and really terrific.

The are great as is...I prefer less filling.  The cookie part was hard but it was a cookie after all.  Would have preferred if it was more chewy.  BUT it was still really tasty and different.    **update**  I had been dreaming about these and made them!  I made graham cracker crust from this site and it was FAB.  I also doubled the filling this go round.  Was just like cheese cake...I never need to bother with the real thing again.  Still 4 stars on this...I am just not impressed enough to give it five but i will make this again and again!

i thought this recipe was HORRIBLE, i read the other reviews and tripled the filling and left the crust as is, the filling was bland and gritty and almost had the consistancy of ricotta cheese YUCK!!!! I am very disappointed it smelled wonderful in the oven and it looked beauitiful what a waste of perfectly good cream cheese, i also tried to save it by putting on a can of chilled cherry pie filling and not even that saved it i through out an entire 9x13 pan of it...the crust was ok I have had much better i think it would of been better without the walnuts but all i tasted was butter...im sorry i even tried this will never do it again. save your cream cheese and find a diffrent recipie...

Very yummy.  I didn't add nuts, but did put cinnamon in the crust.  I served it with basically apple pie filling and ice cream.  Guests went crazy over it.

I made these in a 11x7 pan and I cut them into 24 servings. They were small peices and thin but that made them easier to eat like a bar cookie rather than a piece of cheesecake.  In that regard, this was exactly what I was looking for.  I also made a blueberry topping to go with and they were fantastic.

doubled the recipe to fit in a 9x13 but didn't triple the filling and I think it is fine that way.  I wanted a nice bar not a huge bite of cheesecake.  Added blueberries and raspberries for a 4th of July look and used a graham cracker crust. I will try the crust in the recipe next time though. Oh and it definitely is lemony (which I like but others may not so I would cut that down if you don't like a lemony flavor)

I found this recipe so so. Only thing I changed was since I don't like nuts of any sort I substituted the walnuts for oats. The Lemon flavor was too strong for me to be a "subtle" taste in the cheesecake that I was hoping for. Might as well call them Lemon Cheesecake Bars or decrease the lemon juice by half at the least. I saw all the recommendations to double the filling or else it would be thin so I promptly IGNORED those suggestions and made it as is because I'm not trying to gain weight. Thinner was better for ME personally. But am warning others, the filling for this isn't much more than half an inch thick. And that was me making it in an 8 inch round cake pan. I'm giving it three stars for good texture and decent taste, was nice and creamy, but not sure if I'll be making this again personally. However, if YOU want a plainer really quick (in preparation) dessert, go for it.

I think they were perfect with the regular amount of filling.. any more would have taken away from the delicious crust (which was actually my favorite part).  Make some cinnamon/sugar apples for the top.. unexpected but delicious.. that is what my friend did!

These were easy and excellent - the nuts in the bottom add a great crunch. Like others, I doubled the filling, and highly recommend doing so.

Great recipe, the filling is sturdy yet yielding.  I made a half sheet tray, so I double the crust and quadrupled the filling and it came out just right.  I also used ground pecans in the crust for a tasty alternative.

These were pretty yummy, although I did make a few changes in execution. I left the ingredients as is, save for fruit topping, and doubled the filling to make mini cheesecakes in a muffin pan. I used the recipe for the crust and am sort of on the fence about it. I thought the shrotbread flavor really suited the lemon in the cheesecake, but there was just too much of a butter flavor for me. It really seemed to overpower the cheesecake flavor. I topped with some strawberry sauce over fresh blueberries, and all in all it's pretty good. I loved the lemon in the filling and enjoy the lightness of it. I do like my cheesecake to be a little thicker, and richer, though, so I'm not sure this will be my go-to recipe. EDITED TO ADD: I wanted to add that the lemon is really very good in this recipe, at least use some of it on your first attempt. Also, I genuinely think it's a mistake to taste this cheesecake, or really any cheesecake the same day you bake it. It hasn't had time to set properly and the flavors won't really meld and intensify until a full day of cooling. On the first day (after hours of cooling), I thought these were pretty good. After two days in the fridge, these were terrific.

These are really easy and perfect. I agree with one reviewer that you should let the cream cheese soften so it's easier to mix. I also doubled the filling but not the lemon juice. Next time, I might omit the walnuts for a full smooth texture, but I had them on hand.

Super yummy! I left out the walnuts because I didn't have any and I'm not really a fan anyways. I usually don't like cheesecake crusts but this one was soo good! I swirled in raspberry jelly as well . Will definitely make again.

These bars were very good.  I served them to guests for dessert topped with a raspberry sauce.  These are nice to make when you get a cheesecake craving and don't want to make an entire huge cheesecake.  I did double the filling for these; however, the next time I make them, I will use a traditional graham cracker crust.  Even though I was careful with putting this crust in the pan, after baking, the crust made the bars too hard to cut decently.

Made some changes and they came out great.  Probably very good as is.  I substituted peanuts for the walnuts and omitted the lemon juice.  Chopped up 2 1/2 2.7 oz Snickers bars and sprinkled them on the cooling crust.  Finely chopped the remaining half of the Snickers bar and mixed it with the reserved topping.  Very rich and yummy.

These were absolutely delicious! One of the best foods I've made from this website. Everyone loved them and they turned out wonderful. I did double the filling, as I noticed the quantity seemed very low like others said. I omitted the walnuts and everything still came out great. I will definitely make these again & again!THANKS!

Excellent recipe! I didn't use the recommended crust, instead I used a graham cracker. I also doubled the filling recipe and good thing that I did because I don't think that it would be enough. These were quick, easy and my picky husband and daugher loved them!!

I doubled the filling recipe from the suggestion of others and baked it for 40 minutes. I'm not a fan of crust in general, but this was a nice change. I'm not a fan of big lemon flavor in my cheesecake either, so next time I'll def. cut back on what the recipe calls for. Overall, people liked it!

I put this in what I believe was an 8x8 pan and it came out way too thin. I could be crazy though and have used too big of a pan. 

But, I love the crust idea, it turned out great and I don't need to have grahm cracker crumbs on hand to make a cheesecake. The flavor of the cheesecake itself was okay but a little hard to tell for me because it was so thin.

oh they're mmmmuch better the day after being baked, if they are refrigerated. the crust was not as good as the "lemon curd bars" crust though... i'd still make again as they were easy and yummy. i nuked raspberry jam (w/ seeds) then strained the seeds thru a sieve to get it seedless then drizzled it atop the bars. they received ooohs from my happy neighbors!

Thank you Frances for submitting this recipe - it is absolutely delicious, and I love being able to have cheesecake, but in small amounts so as not to wreck my waistline!  I actually used a homemade graham cracker crust/crumbs instead of the pastry...it was wonderful!  Thanks again!

This really does taste like cheesecake! The pastry part wasn't for me though, I will be using a graham cracker pastry the next time. It was still delectable though! Highly recommended!

These are soo good. I 1& 1/2'd the filling, but doubled the lemon juice. I made no other changes, it is fantastic! I cut my bars tiny, as they are rich. I love the nuts in the crust. Thank you for posting.

Well liked.  I omitted the nuts and kept everything else the same. Made a blueberry compote to go with it: 1 cup blueberries, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 TBSP water, 1 TBSP lemon juice, boil for 5 minutes, smash some blueberries while cooking.

Made this as stated with two exceptions- I used light cream cheese and omitted the lemon (for no other reason than I didn't feel like having a lemon flavor that day!). I didn't find the filling sweet enough at all! It was quite sour and disappointing. And, as other reviewers stated, the filling is thin. I would have doubled it as suggested, but didn't have enough cream cheese on hand. The crust was delicious but a little bit crumbly, even after 24hrs in the fridge. I will, however, make this again because it was SO easy, and believe it can be delicious by implementing a few easy changes-- next time I will double the filling and increase the sugar by one and a half times, and make sure to use regular full fat cream cheese. For the crust I think I'll decrease the flour a bit- to 3/4c- and hopefully it will stick together better.

This was good but I really needed to double the filling.  They were really thin bars I thought.

I skipped the chopped Walnuts b/c I didn't have any and the crust was fantastic.  Very surprised by that.

Easy to make and received lots of compliments when served. The only thing is that I STILL can't figure out how in the heck you get 36 servings out of one 8" square pan? I cut them relatively small and still only got 16. Hmmm....

Fairly easy to make and got rave reviews.  I would recommend buttering or using cooking spray on the bottom of your pan, though.  I did not put the crust mixture on top, doing as another reviewer suggested and drizzling with melted semi sweet and white chocolate.  

I bought pre-chopped walnuts (speed was one of my main criteria for choosing this recipe) and while I normally would have chopped them more, having larger chunks of walnut added to the texture.  I definitely am keeping this one for future bring-a-dessert-to-share events.

Tastes pretty good. Doubled the recipe and baked in a 13 x 9 pan. Don't love the walnut flavor but don't hate it either. Hubby does not like the walnuts. Next time I will double the filling. 10/20/11 Came up with a pumpkin version that is AMAZING!

I made the filling of these bars and then made this for the crust  * 1 1/2 cups finely ground graham crackercrumbs  * 1/3 cup white sugar  * 6 tablespoons butter, melted  * 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)   Mix graham cracker crumbs, sugar, melted butter or margarine, and cinnamon until well blended . Press mixture into pan Bake at 375 degrees And then topped with  *4 oz fine-quality 60%  chocolate (not unsweetened), coarsely chopped  *1/2 stick  butter, cut into pieces  *2 teaspoons light corn syrup melt it all together over a LOW heat (or double boiler) then pour over room temp cheesecake bars - refrigerate! Turned out Very good!

I have no idea what everyone is raving about with these. The bottom was hard and dry, and the filling (which I did double) was so bland (I opted out of the lemon juice as many other reviewers did). I will never make these again.

Not that good for me. But I blame myself due to a couple of modifications.   1-Used Splenda  2- Attempted to double recipe midway through the process because it was such a small amount of batter  3- Probably should not have used 2 eggs.

i think its important to realize that this is designed to be cute into itty bitty pieces and served as like bitesized snacks, not a cheesecake recipe and thats why there isn't much filling.   however, i made it as a cheesecake and simply doubled the filling recipe as other suggested. the crust is absolutely delicious and the entire cake was sooo good.   i'm a very inexperienced baker and only 17 and this is the first homemade cake i've ever made and it was simple. i also mad ea strawberry glaze and chopped fresh strawberriers that added an extra deliciousness.  it was very easy and very awesome my dad loved it and im sure my boyfriend and his lil sis will too! i am about to get another piece right now!

These bars were very good.  I made the mistake of using a 9x9 pan instead of 8x8 so they were rather thin.  I also had to substitute white sugar for brown because I was out, which I don't recommend, but it worked ok.  Despite these things they were still delicious and were gone within 24 hours.

I just made these tonight and they were great! I doubled the filling as other reviewers recommended and they were perfect. I have no idea how the recipe is supposed to yield 36 bars though. I think both the walnuts in the crust and the lemon in the filling tasted awesome and they were so easy to make. I served them with fresh strawberries and it made a tasty summer dessert.

This was a really good cheesecake! I put lime juice instead of lemon juice and then put sugared strawberries on top and the lime/strawberry mix was delicious! I recommend putting that or even 1 1/2 tbs. of key lime juice. I doubled the filling, as others recommended. I can't imagine how it would of been if I hadn't! I might even triple the filling next time. Other than that, this tasted like real cheesecake and will be made again in the future!

This is the best cheesecake recipe I have ever tasted.  I took the advice of the other reviews and doubled the filling and I omitted the lemon (I am not a huge fan of lemon).  The bars turned out fantastic.  Everyone loved them.  In the summer for a family reunion, I added about a half cup sf fresh blueberries, they were a hit! Thank you so much for this easy and delish recipe.

Very good and very easy. I have never made even a cheescake before. But these were very easy to make and very tasty. Brought to a dinner party with fresh raspberry sauce and was a big hit.  Definietly, press down crumb mixture into pan best you can. I also sprayed pan with Pam. I also cut after cooled but before I put in Frig. I had no problem with falling a part or sticking to pan.

This was a huge hit at the office.  The nutty crust was everyones favotite.  It did only amount to about 16 servings. It was the perfect ratio of crust to filling.  I will be making this again!!!

Great recipe Thank you! 
I omitted the nuts and lemon. Doubled the filling and warmed blackberry jelly in the microwave and swirled it in the filling before cooking! Big hit at the family get together!

This is the first time i ever baked a homemade cheesecake. It was pretty easy. I took alot of other peoples suggestions like, doubling the filling. If I wouldnt of i wouldnt of had enough for my one pie pan i used and the few cupcake sizes. I didnt use no nuts or lemon juice. I doubled the vanilla. and it tasted great. for the crust I would of rather had gram crust instead of this. but everyone loved it and I melted chocolate and drizzed that on top. and put cinnamon on top of the chocolate, and that gave my newphew somthign to do.

Bf and our roommate loved these.  Only complaint bf had was that they were warm, so I told him to put them in the fridge.  I thought they were just okay, but I am not a cheesecake fan, so if they liked it, I'm fine.  I doubled the cheesecake filling as others did, and then baked for an additional 20 or so minutes.  Thanks!

I just got done making these and they are Yummy! I did substitute a few things. I used pecans (no walnuts),white sugar(out of brown). I made the filling just like it is. I did swirl chocolate sauce through the filling, being careful not to disturb the crust. I used cooking spray in my 8x8 glass baking dish and did not have trouble getting them out. Just cut them when they come out of the oven. Next time I'll make a bigger panful and double everything.

Good recipe, but the filling has to be doubled in order to have more cheesecake than crust. Very good flavor, though. Sets up nice, too.

I certainly would suggest doubling the filling, but not the lemon juice (thanks to the Naples girl who suggested that). Do melt 1/3 cup of seedless strawberry(or other fruit) jam and drizzle on before the added topping, then bake. It may have been too plain without the fruit addition. Loved the crunchy walnuts, but 4 stars because the crust is yummy but hard to cut & does separate from the topping after chilled. Thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe!! So easy to make. I ommitted the lemon juice as per the other reviews. Tip: make sure you use softened cream cheese AND softened butter - makes it much easier; also, cut into pieces after it comes out of the oven and before it goes into the fridge. Awesome recipe - thanks for sharing!!

WARNING - these cheesecake bars are extreemely addictive.  They sit in your fridge and tempt you to just eat one more.  But you can' stop, and before you know it you're 10 pounds heavier and you have to buy a whole new wardrobe.  I don't always have nuts on hand, so instead of the crust in this recipe, I use the crust from 'THe Best Lemon Bars' from this site -- just have to remember to lightly grease the bottom on the pan if you are doing that crust -and don't cook it too long - 10-15 minutes tops.  I double the filling - and they are best after they have been refrigerated overnight.

Great flavor and easy to follow!
--For those who have little experience with homemade baked goods (like me): make sure you MELT THE CREAM CHEESE before you fry your beater trying to mix the rock-hard chunk of cream cheese with the sugar!! 
--DO use walnuts! It makes the crust soo much more flavorful! I was hesitant to use them because I don't really like nuts, but it makes a HUGE difference.
--If you want restaurant-style cheesecake, double the filling. Though the filling looks kinda wimpy with just the amount of filling listed in the directions, it is sufficient for eating purposes.
--This is encouragement for those who aren't sure if they can handle this recipe: you can! I stink at following directions, but this one had such few and simple directions (except that part about melting the cream cheese) that it's hard to go wrong.
--I baked my crust for a little longer than 15 minutes and it was the perfect tint of brown. I baked the filling for 27 minutes and it was perfect-brown around the edges to make sure it is baked enough and not so brown that it looks burnt.
--My picture is the one with kiwis and strawberries. I decorated it as a birthday cake for my mom, and she loved it!

This was AMAZING. I had my first bite 10 mins after it came out of the oven (it just smelled divine)and I was absolutely smitten with the recipe. Creamy, crunchy and so light. I used a 12 oz tub of whipped cream cheese, which made it really easy to cream, and instead of milk, used whipping cream. Don't neglect the walnuts. You can hardly taste them, but their amazing texture gives the crust character. I also used a pyrex 11x7x2 instead of 8x8, which was perfect, time and quantity-wise. A few bits of advise for after you take the bars out the oven, and before put it in the fridge: 
-Cut them into bars immediately with a sharp knife. Then let cool 
-Put your jam, jelly, chocolate etc before the topping gets firm and slick. 
-EAT IT RIGHT THERE. I found that 12 hours in the fridge made it a little too tough to serve. Definately a winner. So easy to make, 10 times more delicious to eat.

Wow! I added a little cinnamon to the crust, and this was an awesome (and easy) recipe.  I do think that I might double the filling next time, and there will definitely be a next time!

Good!  I read the reviews and decided to double the filling- and was glad I did.  It was perfect that way.  With the filling as is, it would have been way too thin.  For some reason, the crust seemed a tiny bit rubbery, but maybe that's because I've only tasted the corner so far.  I served this with Praline Sundae Topping from this site.  Oh my gosh, that combo is to die for!

Excellent and easy, a nice variation on traditional cheesecake.   I took these to a potluck tonight and people loved them!  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan at 300 degrees for about 35 minutes.  I also increased the sugar by 50% and reduced the lemon juice by one-third, ie, 2 tsp per recipe instead of 1 tblsp.  This gave a moderate lemony taste but not super strong.  Really liked the shortbread-type crust.  The filling was about 5/8 inch deep, which was fine for a bar cookie.  You could easily drizzle these with chocolate or serve with fruit, but I was very happy with them as is.

I really liked this recipe! I made it for our Bible Study and they got good reviews. I needed more than the 8 x8 pan the recipe yields, so I doubled the crust and tripled the filling, and baked in a 9 x 13 pan. Between the extra filling and our high altitude (around 6,000) I added 10 minutes to the baking time.  I especially liked the walnuts in the crust. I served them with strawberries macerated in orange juice and sugar. 
Note: The recipe calls for reserving some of the crust to use as topping. I did not do this, and the crust turned out a little thick. Once the bars warmed up to room temperature, it wasn't a problem, but when they were cold, they were a little difficult to cut through.

These were amazing, I did however double the filling as another reviewer suggested and baked at 300 for 35 min, I also used a graham cracker crust and lined the pan with parchment for ease, and I also did only 1 tbsp of lemon juice in the filling instead of doubling like the other ingredients,  it came out perfectly, I highly suggest this recipe.

It gets four instead of five stars because of the changes that need to be made, but once the changes are made, 5 stars all the way! 

I did a graham cracker crust, baked for 5 minutes.  I doubled the filling (frankly, it could have been tripled) and omitted the lemon.  I used an electric hand mixer and did the cheese first by itself.  I baked for 35 minutes at 300.  These are positively sublime and I finished them in a day.  :x

Fixed these yesterday for an afternoon card game, twelve attendees. Everyone LOVED it and wanted recipe. In the interest of full-disclosure, I did a couple modifications (the way my mother used to fix). Pecans instead of walnuts-personal preference. Also, put a bit more than half of pastry mixture in bottom. Baked for 15 minutes. Poured cream cheese mixture over. Crumbled remaining pastry mixture over it. Baked for 20 minutes.

The recipie has no break between the crust ingredients and cake ingredients, and so I mixed the flour into the cake(i made a differant crust)...it did not work. I am giving this 3 stars because I think it would have tasted good-had I not added the flour. Thanks!

I'm sorry to say I found these pretty bland.  I didn't deviate from the recipe either.  The crust was ok but needs some "oomph" and it really felt unnoticeable because of the blandness of the cheesecake.

Did this for a potluck, super easy to make, and tasted great! Everyone thought it was a restaurant quality cheesecake. Excellent for dinner parties and finger snacks. Kids love them too. Don't have to change a thing.

I feel that this recipe doesn't compare to real cheescake. I'm not sure if it lacked sugar but it just wasn't that sweet. I followed the recipe as written. The batter tasted so good until I baked it and let it cool. It just wasn't as good as I expected.

These were yummy--the filling is a very good base cheesecake bar recipe that you could do a lot with. I made mine in silicone cupcake holders, used a graham cracker crust and popped them out of the holders before I served them with strawberries on top. They were yummy and cute!

The filling is a typical cream cheese/cheesecake filling.  The crust, however, was not to my liking.  I did not like the consistency at all.  No one like it at my house.

This is the same recipe my grandmother uses, but she usually uses a can of cherry pie filling and refridgerates before cutting. Delicious!

This turns out fabulous each time I make it.  I have even bumped the number of servings up to an insane (100+) amount and made it in a 9x13 pan for my teenaged daughter's birthday party/sleepover.

Definitely double this recipe if using an 8" pan!  In order to fill a 9 x 13" pan and have plenty of the cheesecake filling, I quadrupled the filling ingredients and it still came out well.  The only change I made while mixing such a large batch was to use only 2 eggs.  Previous reviews mentioned that it would be too "egg-y" otherwise.  The crust is a nice change from the usual graham cracker or cookie crumb crusts.  Of course, the baking time for the filling was also much longer because of the greater amount.  We topped it with cherry pie filling, but I would love to try this with mini-chocolate chips or a raspberry swirl.  This recipe is one I'd make again when a cheesecake craving hits.

good recipe, i didn't have enough cream cheese to double as others recommended, they're fine as is. i added 2 Tbsps sour cream to my mix & used chopped almonds instead of walnuts.  i really like this isn't the typical graham crust base.  YUMMY!!

I was suprised how easy this was to make. i doubled the recipe to fit a 9 by 13 pan. I cooked this for 30 minutes in my gas stove, slid it out  to sprinkle the topping, adn left it alone in the oven for another hour. Also, i didnt have eggs or vanilla. so i added a little extra milk. They were delicious, creamy, light, and the perfect bite size snack for a party or event. (I made 40 minature squares with this recipe) Thanks!

These were good although the crust was a little too crunchy and hard, I did not use the lemon juice because other reviewers said that is all you could taste, next time I think I may swirl strawberry or blueberry preserves through the mix.

I have never made cheesecake before and thought I would try this recipe out because it seemed fairly easy.  The texture came out a little more like a custard than I would have expected, but the taste was good.  The crust stuck to the bottom of the pan the first time I tried to cut into it, but once you get the cutting started the bars come up easily.  This was an okay recipe, loved more by my husband then myself, but I will be searching for a more "cheesecakey" cheesecake.

I thought that the flavor was fantastic, the crust was perfect however there didn't seem to be enough filling. I think that the next time that I make it I will double the filling recipe and try again. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

very DELICIOUS! There was a nice balance between crust and filling, unlike some cheesecakes where there is a quarter crust and 2 inches of cheesecake...which can be way too rich. But, not this one. I told my fiance next time I will do something about the crust because it was just a tiny nit crumbly, but he said "No don't, its great". So, maybe I won't change a thing about it. Great idea with cutting into bars also, loved that!

I used white sugar for the crust and it held mini cheesecakes together just fine. I doubled the amount of filling and made 12 mini cheesecakes in a non-stick muffin pan. Next time, I will use 1/4 cup measures to make the crust: there was too much left over.

I had such high hopes for this recipe, and I must say I was disappointed.  It tasted nothing like cheesecake.  I doubled the filling recipe, and if I hadn't this would have pretty much been crust with a thin layer of would-be cheesecake.  Save your ingredients for a different recipe.

I really did not like the crust... it stayed together but if I make this again I'll stick with a standard graham cracker crust. Most likely I'll use a different recipe since this is a common dessert.

These Were Pretty Good!  They had a nice texture to them, and were very versatile.  I used home made strawberry jam to top one piece, and I sprinkled a little powdered French Vanilla Cappucino on another.  A very quick, easy, and delicious dessert!

Fabulous! Simple, easy, cheap to make, very tasty.
Don't monkey around the ingredients, they are perfect as they are. (I did, however, save 1/3 cup of the base to sprinkle over the top.
Just the right size for a small gathering. Will keep, use again and pass on to others

Found the crust a little dry and the cheesecake top was quite thin. I would double the topping next time. But they were wonderfully flavorful.

Good, with a definite cheesecake flavor.  It is probably more an issue with me than the recipe, but while it has a cheesecake flavor, it can't compare with an actual cheesecake.  I could not help but making the comparison.  So while they are good bars, I think I will stick with the real thing.

These turned out delicious! I made the recipe with only 2 changes. I used almonds instead of walnuts in the crust cause that's what I had on hand and I omitted the lemon juice cause I'm not a big fan of the flavour. I did not double the filling as some suggested and it was just right for me, probably because I like more crust than filling rather than alot of filling with little crust. I would defitnitely make these again but next time I think I may grind the nuts to a powdery consistency since I'm not very fond of the nut pieces in the crust...but the taste is great! Thanks alot for the recipe.

I thought these were pretty good.  I would have liked a firmer texture, though.  I swirled in some raspberry preserves before baking to give them a little something extra.  Next time I would probably take the advice of other reviewers and double the filling.

This is a great recipe! I substituted confectioners sugar for white sugar, used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 for milk, and drizzles raspberry preserves on top. They came out amazing!

I personally was not that thrilled with the filling.  I really liked the crust, as I am sick of so many cheesecake recipes calling for graham crackers in the crust!  I thought the filling was kind of eggy and the texture was not my favorite for cheesecake- a bit too fluffy, not so creamy. They did get good reviews from my co-workers, though- but any treat in the office is usually well received.  I did double the filling as some had suggested.  I think I'll save the crust recipe and try with a different filling, or maybe use the crust as a base for an actual cake instead of bars.

These have good flavor and are definitely easy! I used only a dash of lemon juice to give it a little kick while not overpowering with lemon flavor.  I also think that there should be more filling- the crust was at least as thick as the cheese part- I prefer the filling to be at least two thirds of the bar, with only one third being the crust. But maybe that's just personal preference. Next time I wil double the filling.  Be sure to top with fruit to give it extra flavor! Thanks!

This Recipe was Fabulous... Thanks ...Texture was great and right amount of flavor...A few tips...I didn't use lemon juice and i tripled the recipe...I didn't use the brown sugar, flour and walnut as called for, for the crust, instead i used Oreos(my preference) and butter mashed them and baked them...REALLY good...I also STIRRED IN the extra 1/4 cup oreos after i put it in my pan instead of just leaving it on top...
    I played around with different flavors and used like peanut butter Oreos then took peanut butter chips and mixed those in with the cheesecake part...( i wasn't there when they were tasted, but i was told they were delicious...they looked REALLY good)...
   My next try is Mint Oreos and white chocolate morsels, we'll see how it turns out... Thanks again, Frances!

Very good recipe.  I had to substitute almonds for the walnuts because that's all I had and it tasted great.  I did however omit the milk from the cheese mixture as when I prepared it seemed awfully soupy.  Overall very good recipe, consider doubling the mixture to have a bit more cheese if you like it as much as I do.

I used a little more cream cheese - there was about 9 ounces in the tub I had, omitted the nuts and used margarine... AMAZING. It's like little cheesecakes! Did add cinnamon to crust, like suggested. I will be making these again.

I made these by doubling the crust and baking it in a jelly roll pan.  I multiplied the filling by 4 because I wanted it to be thick.  I swirled seedless strawberry jam on the top before baking.  It was so much quicker than my normal NY style cheesecake for the holidays and soooooo delicious.  I received many compliments.  Thanks for this one!

Good recipe.  I doubled the filling as one reviewer suggested, but I did not increase the time (I forgot.)  The middle cookies were way too gooey and the outer ones were soft, but still tasted good.  So, if you double the filling, be sure to increase the time.  Also, I used pecans in the crust because I don't like walnuts and the crust still tasted good.  I will try the recipe again paying closer attention to the cooking time.

Instead of chopped walnuts, I suggest "finely chopped walnuts" for the base.  Also, more cheesecake filling would be better...But it tasted great!

This recipe is quick & easy & delicious. I've already made this a couple of times. I mixed together 3 to 4 digestive biscuits (crushed) + 1/3cup chopped walnuts + 1/3cup butter for the base. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't make the crust like this tho -  i made a regular graham cracker crust.  I also used homemade preserves diluted with a little lemon and water so they were more spreadable and swirled it on top

I save about 1/3 cup of the crust and sprinkle it on the top before I bake it.. I  double the filling part of the recipe and add a bit of lemon zest. These are great on a dessert buffet or on a tray of cookies..

Not a fan!   Walnuts didn’t go with the lemon in the cheesecake.  I would have used pecans and no lemon at all if I made it again. Which I won’t

Worked like a charm!! This is a great recipe to turn into any kind of cheesecake you can imagine. In my case, I turned it into strawberry swirl cheesecakes easily. I changed the recipe into "cupcake" form, instead of bars, resulting in a 18 minute bake time. My only complaint is how much crust you can make with this; it's not coherent to how much cheesecake batter you plan on using. I doubled the recipe apart from the crust, and the batter came in about 6-7 short of filling 24 cupcake liners. Keep that in mind if from bar to cupcake is the transition you want to make. Otherwise, I am keeping this chameleon cheesecake recipe in my arsenal! Absolutely recommend!

i had 2 packages cream cheese i needed to use up, so i make this in a 9X13 pan and it turned out excellent. So this recipe can be doubled successfully. I added lemon zest, which was really good as well.
Will definitely make again, and plan to use the crust for other bar recipes.
Thanks for this!

These were good. As another reviewer said, it's not really any different from regular cheesecake.  The pastry crust was loved by some, hated by others. I am partial to a graham cracker crust myself. This is a good, simple recipe, though. I added green food coloring for St Patrick's Day. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as stated.

I used a graham cracker crust instead . I added  a layer of raspberries and poured raspberry Jello on top. After it set, I took it to a potluck and it was the first thing that disappeared after dinner. Everyone was talking about how delicious it was.

Very good and basic recipe, I used a graham cracker crust doubled the filling except used only one egg. after chilling I cut into small squares, freeze. I only take out what I need squares are room temp in five to ten minutes. If you cut squares in bit size pieces you can eat them straight out of the freezer, they melt in your mouth. Full flavor,  great recipe to use in a pinch.

The bars were hard not soft like a cheesecake, and I used almond extract instead and I feel it would have worked out better if I had used vanilla extract, but oh well.

Very good recipe. Super easy. I made them in a muffin pain (ie. mini cheesecakes instead of bars) could have used more filling, less crusty bottom but none the less, excellent recipe

I made these last night.  They turned out amazing.  The only change was using sunflower seeds instead of walnuts in the crust since that what I had on hand.  I topped with fresh raspberries.  Everyone loved them.  Thank you for sharing.

I love Cheese Cake and I love Lemon Bars, so I doubled the Lemon and omitted the milk. Worked out great. For the pastry I had on hand croissant dough, so I used that. Baked the crust first till a nice golden color, it cooled very quickly, then I poured the batter on, stuck it back into the oven and voila. Thank you for a simple, yet great recipe.

The photo & directions are misleading.  I'm not sure how you'd get 36 bars out of an 8x8 pan.  I used the crust recipe as is, doubled the filling recipe [but not doubling the lemon] and cut them into 18 servings, serving with cherry pie filling as guests desired.  It's an easy, solid recipe.

Crust was good in my opinion, the only thing is to double the amount of filling.

I used my own graham cracker crust recipe so I can't rate that, but the cheesecake filling is way too thin; it looks nothing like the picture. I plan to make it again but double the filling recipe.

After reading the reviews, I decided to double the filling, and so I increased the amounts of cream cheese (16oz) and white sugar (1/3c – prefer it less sweet). However, it completely slipped my mind to do the same for the egg, milk, lemon juice (in fact, I even reduced this to 1/2T) and vanilla extract. But despite such a huge mistake, the final product was delish and had a wonderful texture – thumbs up for this super forgiving recipe. I'm sure it would have been even better if I wasn't so forgetful!

I used a graham cracker crust (1 cup ground GC crumbs and 1/3 cup of melted butter combined and patted down into baking dish and baked @350 for about 12 min) and I doubled the cheesecake filling (not the lemon juice). I also put small dollups of black raspberry preserves on top and swirled them through with a toothpick. baked for 35 min at 350.
It looked pretty and tasted good. Very rich and filling but that's cheesecake! I think I would make this sgain. It was easy. I was glad I doubled the filling.

Made with limes since that is what was available. Halved the amount of sugar through out the recipe, the sweetness was perfect for us. Also, added 1/2 tsp. of salt to the crust. Turned out good.

I love this recipe!  I found a graham cracker crust recipe on this site and made it instead.  I followed the filling exactly and turned out yummy!!  I used an 8 x 8 glass pan and baked it for 25 min.  I added fresh sliced strawberries on top.  Thank you for the recipe!

These are sooo good!!  I loved the crust.  The first time I made them, I went to find a graham cracker crust and then just used the filling of this recipe.  The crust is my favorite part!  Oops, one change we did have to make to the crust was substituting almonds for walnuts as my husband is allergic to walnuts.  I loved this recipe so much that I made some changes to make a key lime version.  I tripled the crust for a bar pan. For the filling a quadrupled it for the bar pan.  I omitted the lemon juice.  I took three limes, zested and finely chopped the skin and juiced them.  I also omitted the milk since I wanted a stronger lime flavor and used the juice of the lime in place of it.  SOOO good!  Thank-you so much for this recipe.  I am excited to try some other versions.  White chocolate-raspberry next?

These were divine!  I did not change a thing, didn't double the filling either.  The crust is like a brown sugar shortbread, delicious!  I don't have much of a sweet tooth so I cut some up very small for myself and bigger ones for my husband.  They were easy to make too!

I made this using flax meal instead of flour and coarsely chopped almonds, resulting in one of the best crusts ever. We added chopped fresh cherries and whole blueberries and baked the filling about 40 minutes. This was easy and is a definite keeper.

Perfect.  Delicious.  The recipe only makes enough for 10-12 bars, though, depending on how you cut them.  It's enough to feed your roommates, but not enough to take to a party.  I like cutting mine into tiny squares and placing toothpicks on them - at a big party where nobody really wants a whole bar, it's a great serving alternative and an excellent way to make the recipe stretch.    I also like the flexibility of the recipe.  I've made these with chocolate, chocolate marble topping, and with fresh raspberries.

I have to agree that you need to double the filling for this.  I made two 8" pans with on batch of the crust recipe, the first I only used one a single batch of the filling and it was very thin.  The second I doubled it and it came out better.  I did not use the lemon in mine.   I do however like the addition of the walnuts in the crust.  I will add that after they sat in the fridge buy the second day they tasted much better.  The crust softened a bit and they tasted more like real cheesecake.

These are actually really good and really easy and they do taste like cheesecake. However, I don't know what recipe they were using when they took those pictures because the tops of mine were yellow! I also agree with the other people about doubling the filling. They're good if you are craving cheesecake but don't feel like making it. I wouldn't take them to the office or anything because they don't look like cheesecake with the yellow. As well as the one following the recipe, I made another one with tofutti cream cheese and soymilk and it was just as good!

It was very hard to make these look pretty. It was not easy to remove them from the pan, and when you did, they were impossible to get out with beautiful even sides like the picture. I didn't have lemon juice on hand, and without it, it was very bland.  They weren't bad, my friend actually loved them, but I will not be making again.

These were dekicious !  The crust was much better than using graham cracker crumbs as a lot of recipes do. I did not change any of the ingredients at all except that before baking and before sprinkling the reserved crumb topping on I drizzled some seedless red rasberry jelly (my favorite) on the top and swirled it through the batter with a knife.  I will make this recipe again and again.

I'm a sucker for cheesecake but have never got up the guts to make my own. So I decided to start out with a simpler recipe. And oh man was this a delicious recipe. My whole family gobbled these up in one night. To "jazz it up" I added raspberry preserves and fresh raspberries after baking.  I will definitely be making these again.

This was an easy recipe and very tasty.  I used pecans instead of walnuts (because my husband doesn't like walnuts) and it was great!  Next time I might try grating some fresh lemon peel for the filling, but it was delicious just following the recipe.  Thanks!

These were okay for a quick snack. I wasn't a fan of the crust. I would have preferred a graham cracker crust, but I didn't have that in the pantry, so I kept with the recipe. A little disappointing.

The filling layer was very thin- the picture must be a triple dose. The flavor was decent for the quick aspect.

If you follow the recipe as written, the bars certainly won't look like the picture! One definitely needs to at least double the filling amount. Even then results are so-so.

Everyone adored them!! Even people that don't normally like cheesecake. I did omit the walnuts, though.

These were just okay.  Certainly not anywhere close to the best cheesecake I've ever had.  I did not care for the crust and it was really hard to cut.  Graham cracker crust is the only way to go!

They were good, but its not "new york" style cheesecake.  I think that's where people are expecting something other than what it is.  But it does taste like cheesecake.

I did not make the bars, I used a store bought shortbread pie crust instead. I doubled the filling and after it cooled I topped it with canned cherry pie filling. This turned out so good, very creamy! I did not find the lemon to be overpowering and the crust was a good contrast with it's crunch. I will be sure to make this again, so many ways it can be changed. Fresh berries on top also would be very good!

These were outstanding! My daughter wanted to make a cheesecake for her birthday, but we ran out of time to do it right. So, we tried these instead. All the great cheesecake taste without all the time and hassle involved with a cheesecake. Very easy. Very Yummy. Other than doubling the filling, the only change we made was in using the Graham Cracke Crust I recipe from this website. We just wanted to stick with that traditional crust. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were very delicious, although mine didn't turn out quite as thick as I would like. Next time I will double the filling. I also added a raspberry swirl. Delicious!!!

Definately very rich, and tasted a lot like a "normal -take forever-and has agazillion steps" cheesecake (which I do like to make, just not all the time :). Per other reviewers suggestions, I doubled the filling which was good for a birthday dessert, but we definately ate smaller piececs.  Thank you for sharing!

Excellent recipe. I substituted chopped almonds for the walnuts and it was still really tasty. Also used brown sugar in the cream cheese and that tasted really good as well.

I made this as a whole pie. It was DELISH! However, since my dad is alergic to walnuts, I used Pecan Sandies in the crust. It tasted so marvelous! I highly recommend this recipe -it was so quick, so easy and SO yummy!

Too much lemon, leaves a sour aftertaste, not incredibly bad but enough to notice. The crust is too thick & there just isn't enough cheesecake portion per bar. Disappointed in the finished product since it has great reviews from trusted AR cooks, we just weren't impressed. Sorry:(

Definitely a winner and very easy to make and "tweak" to suit the occasion. I am not crazy about walnuts, so I substitute with ground almonds and a small amount of graham cracker crumbs for the base. I also have tried it with orange juice and another time with lemon rind and lemon juice.  Definitely double the cream cheese filling. These are a favourite and I am always asked to bring them to many get-togethers where they disappear very quickly.

Accidentally I added 2 pkgs of cream cheese to my filling mixture, so then I doubled the filling recipe.  Now I see from the reviews that was recommended!  I definitely would double again.  Took about 45 minutes to bake.  Baked perfectly, came out of pan looking great and tasting superb.  I served with fresh fruit and next time I'd add again add 3 tbsp lemon juice plus maybe some zest.  A keeper.

Sorry but we also were not thrilled with the filling.  I agree with another reviewer that it almost tasted like something was forgotten in the recipe directions.  In fairness two of us liked and two of us did not.  I will keep looking.  Thanks

I improvised a bit on this recipe, but I'll still chime in. My version had crushed pretzels instead of nuts in the crust. I added PB to the filling, and left out the lemon. My version is delicious, the only cons are that the topping & crust don't stay "on" very well, and the filling is just a tiny tad dry. Not really creamy like a cheesecake. But it is still extremely edible! Oh yes, I also doubled the recipe & used a 13x9" pan.

I'm iffy about this recipe. It was definately easy but when I tasted it it seemed like I had forgotten something but I double checked the recipe and had followed it correctly. I will try again and double the filling as suggested, and probably add more sugar. I might also leave out the lemon juice as that may be the flavor I didn't like.

Very bland.  Was hoping for a rich tasting cheesecake.  Cream cheese layer is pretty thin also.

These were really good.  I just wish that the filling was thicker.  I may double the filling ingredients next time.

This recipe is absolutely delicous!  I make it for friends and family all the time.  I omitted the nuts from the recipe though (and the last time i didn't have milk so i used creamer! but it turned out fine).

Excellent, though the crumbs sprinkled on top didn't bake in and so had a tendency to fall off and make a mess while you're eating it. But all  my friends loved these!

Good, easy, and fresh. I might have liked a thicker layer of filling, but these were good, though. My father loved them.
