We really thought this tasted great and elegant.  Wrapping the fish ends around the spinach was a bit of a challenge, but if you can't manage it, just lay the fish on top of the spinach.  Served with parmesan pasta and stir-fried mushrooms, green onions and zucchini.  Good combination.

I thought this was very tasty and elegant.  Next time I might use a different fish such as tilapia since the fish wasn't quite done after the indicated time and because my husband doesn't like the texture of catfish.  But overall I thought the flavors were excellent.
