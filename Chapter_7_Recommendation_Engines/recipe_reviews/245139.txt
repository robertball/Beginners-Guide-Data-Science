Awesome! This "creamer" gives your coffee that push into the Fall like no other. And it is so easy to put together using all natural almost all homemade ingredients. The coconut milk (keeping low on the water helped make it thicker) flax seed milk pumpkin (I just dipped my Tbsp into a fresh roasted pumpkin) and pumpkin spice mix were all made in house from recipes from this website. I added rice syrup instead of maple. In the end I added 2 Tbsp of coconut oil for a nutrient boost (as if this needed it) and absolutely loved it-and I'm not paleo or vegan. This is simply a great way to flavour coffee and get something good out of it rather than the store bought syrups or additives. Thank you Brooke for your recipe!

I like the pumpkin flavor this creamer gives, but I had to use much more than 1 serving to get my coffee the right creamy consistency I like. But for those who are off the creamy stuff, it should work well.

Just a note- if the creamer comes out too thick you can always add more of the non-dairy milk-the coconut milk tends to firm up when it is really cold. I sometimes try to take the creamer out of the refrigerator about 30 min or so before using and that helps but is not always possible if you are in a hurry:-)

This was very good. I left out the maple syrup since I didn t have it and added vanilla extract to the mixture. I used Stevia to sweeten. Next time I think I will try honey or agave.
