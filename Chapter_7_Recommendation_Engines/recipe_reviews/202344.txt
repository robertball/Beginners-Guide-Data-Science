Wow! What a fabulous dessert! I had my eye on this for a while and finallly got around to trying it and am so glad I did. The combination of fruit is awesome and not overly sweet.  The shortcakes are light and fluffy - I cut the salt down to 1 tsp., added 1/2 cup of flaked coconut, 1/2 tsp. of lime juice and used butter instead of shortening.  You definitely need a well floured surface to cut these out on as the dough is very soft.  After I cut out the shortcakes I topped them with a bit of turbinado sugar and placed them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. I let them set for about 30 minutes in order to the the baking powder "react".  They baked up beautifully! For the whipped cream I used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream with 2 Tbsp. of white sugar and 1/2 tsp. of coconut extract. Be sure your bowl and beater are well chilled and it'll whip up nicely.   I can't remember when I've had a more unique or refreshing dessert. Thanks larkspur for a great recipe!

This is my recipe, and I have a couple of tips to help anyone who wants to make this! The gelatin part of the coconut cream is optional; it is just intended to help stabilize the cream if it has to sit for a long period of time. If you decide to put the gelatin in, be careful that it doesn't cool down too much, as it will form small, hard lumps in the cream when you try to beat it in. I hope this helps! Thanks for looking at my recipe!

Another seriously good recipe. I made as written, but did not add the gelatin as I was whipping the cream up just at serving time. I did use the real buttermilk called for, as I believe it adds to the richness of the shortcakes. The dough was unbelieveably soft and pillowy. I just knew they were going to bake up nicely, and they did. We just loved the coconut cream, and the flavors in this recipe are a match made in heaven.  The only thing I would change next time is reducing the salt in the shortcakes. It was also a very quick and simple dessert to put together. It looks involved at first glance, but it's not, at all. Wonderful! I can't wait to make this again.

I made this tonight!  They were really good, ,I read larkspurs review and did not use the gelatin or water for the cream topping mixture.  Instead I used the heavy whipping cream and confectioners sugar (powdered sugar), I also added about 1-2 tablespoon shredded coconut to it!  Turned out great.  I also didnt have buttermilk for the bread dough part, but a good substitute (I didnt want to run to the store) is fill almost 1 cup of milk add 1 tablespoon white vinegar or lemon juice and let set for 5 minutes and then use this as you would in the recipe.  I also added 1 extra tablespoon honey.  It worked out great!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe Larkspur, hopefully I did not make to many changes :)

Delicious! All of the flavors mesh together so nicely. The shortcakes smell heavenly right out of the oven. I recommend making them slightly thicker than suggested. A great summertime treat!

I only gave it 4 stars because there is enough in the shortcake batter for 12 but the actual recipe will only serve 6.  I served 6 and could have used still more fruit and whipping cream.  I went to the store for strawberries and of course they were out so substituted kiwi.  I didn't have the poppy seeds but I think that would add. Not sure of the purpose of the gelatin.  Wouldn't bother with it next time.

These are delicious! Easy to make and beautiful dessert. Didn't use the gelatin since we were eating it right away. The dough was very sticky when kneading so I just kept adding flour and it didn't affect the final product I agree with CC at first glance seems like a labor intensive dessert when in fact can be put together in no time. Definately worth of serving to company. Thanks larkspur for sumitting your delicious recipe! Elvira Silva.

These were very good! I had a mango that I needed to use and I've had my eye on these, so I went ahead and made them :) I did have to make one significant modification and that was that I did not have a lime (or a lemon even) so I had to do without. These were still great, but I could see how the lime would make them even better. Like others, I did not use the gelatin in the whipped cream and it turned out great. I really loved the coconut flavor in this. As for the shortcakes, I used butter instead of shortening and I did not have poppy seeds, but those were the only changes I made. They turned out fantastic. Loved this! I will definitely be making these again with the lime!!

Very delicious! We loved the flavors in the shortcakes.  I did use butter instead of shortening in the shortcakes, I don't usually have shortening, and it worked perfect. I also cut the butter into the flour mixture with the food processor, it is so much quicker and easier.  Also just whipped up the cream before serving. My husband who insists that he hates mangoes loved this! And he didn't even eat around the mango. I topped with a little bit of toasted coconut. Thanks for the recipe Larkspur I will be making these again!

This was pretty good. Didn't add gelatin to the cream and reduced salt but reduced it too much. My mangoes weren't very ripe or sweet so I think that will help. It made a ton of shortcakes but I think I made them too flat, will make them bigger next time. Liked the lime zest in the cakes.

I really enjoyed this recipe! Though the gelatin through me and I didn't use it, they cream was delicious! Messy and definitely for older kids and adults. my son loved the strawberries and cream and i enjoyed the added flavours throughout the dish, lime, coconut, strawberry's an mango's made it really feel like spring time. Can't wait to make these for guests! Thanks for this one :) As a side note, I would also decrease the amount of salt in the dough.
