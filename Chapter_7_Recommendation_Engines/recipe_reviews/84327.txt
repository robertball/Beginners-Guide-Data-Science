This was so delicious just the way it's written!  I'm someone that likes lots of spices, but sometimes it's nice to have a dish like this with simple ingredients so that you can appreciate the food's individual flavors instead of the added spices.  So I followed the recipe closely and was very pleased.  I actually wanted to impress my boyfriend with a hearty and inexpensive casserole when I chose this one, so there was a lot of pressure.  But it was a success!  We both loved it.  Even his roommate scarfed some down!  I will DEFINITELY make this again.  (Make sure you grease your pan tho.  It sticks to the bottom easily.)

My family loves this recipe. It has a wonderful flavor combination. My daughter likes it better with chicken instead of tuna and it also works well with leftover turkey. Other than switching up the meats I follow the recipe as written with no complaints or wants to change it. I do suggest you use a good brand of french fried onions. There is a huge difference between them. I like French's.

I made this the other night when I forgot to plan for dinner. It interested me b/c I had all the ingredients on hand. Husband liked it very much and I didn't think he would. Very easy and quick. I used a can petite diced tomatoes, drained well for the tomato. Would be a good dish to get your kids to eat their broccoli. Will make again! Thanks Pidge.

Made with 4 large tortillas and stuffed them like burritos.  Didn't have any cheddar, but used a young gouda.  Whole family loved this unique combination which went together surprisingly good. Will definately make this again, possibly with homemade cream of mushroom to make it healthier.  Thank you for a great new way to eat tuna!

I have a feeling that this recipe would be great following the recipe, but I used what was on hand.  I substituted cooked flaked walleye for the tuna, fresh cooked broccoli for the frozen, wheat tortillas instead of flour, and mild salsa for the tomato.  I see this as a very versatile recipe.  Thanks PIDGE! It's a keeper.

Very interesting! I added some garlic powder, but that's it. Good flavor and a great idea. My only complaint is that it was so mushy. I'm not sure if baking the roll-ups first, and then adding the soup halfway through would do anything to help this or not. It was tasty though, and cheap!

Very tasty.  Will be making this again.  I forgot to use nonstick spray on the glass 9x13 pan and it wasn't a big deal.  Perfect level of moisture and cheesiness.  Didn't give it five stars because we thought it would taste even better if another meat was used instead of tuna.

Hubby loved this recipe.  It was very delicious and easy to make.  I too didn't have any french fried onions on hand so just used diced onions.  Yummy!!

This was absolutely horrible.  Nothing about this recipe was complementary.  Broccoli and tuna are two very strong odors and tastes, and are hard to combine. Plain old tuna noodle casserole is much better.  Will NOT be making this one again.

Easy recipe.  Quick to make.  We like spicy food so I added a can of chopped chiles, doubled the cheese using Hot Pepper Cheese instead of Cheddar, and then increased the tuna to 3 cans.  somehow 1 can didn't seem like enough.  I think next time I will add more cheese on top and take off foil earlier for it can get a little brown and bubbly.  Also think substituting spinach for broccoli would be a yummy variation.

Not a lot of flavor and the broccoli and tuna did not work together very well.  Sorry, but will not make this again.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I was lacking the onions so I substituted Ritz cracker crums and onion powder and cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom.  It definitely was a crowd pleaser!

Easy recipe and yields a lot of food. I could imagine this being fun for families with children. Next time I will try it with chicken just to see how that works.

I found this recipe looking for a way to use up some french fried onions lurking in the back of my pantry (not sure how I came by them and I loathe green beans). I must admit I had some misgivings about the combination of flavours in the recipe but it turned out quiet pleasent. Nothing I'd serve to company, but a quick and cheap weeknight meal - I think kids would like it too.

I followed this recipe exactly and it just lacked flavor. It definitely is missing *something* I just don't know what it is! I liked the idea of this dish, but it's just not that good.

I looked up a tuna recipe that wasn't a noodle casserole or a salad and found this.  I substituted frozen mixed veggies as I didn't have any broccoli.  It came out great and was a big hit with my family!

Interesting use of tuna.  I would rather make this without the tortilla shells as they came out sort of gummy.  I'll add some baby carrots and snow peas next time and make this more of a throw together casserole.

I accidently forgot to use condensed soup.  I got so excited when I saw a Cream of Portobella soup that I didn't even think about it being soup and not condensed.  Otherwise, these little wraps were delicious.  The french fried onions were the perfect touch!

I made five servings out of this dish but i changed the proportions of the filling and sauce to the tortillas. I used 5 large tortillas. I doubled both the sauce and filling ingredients. I used a 14.5 oz can, drained, of diced tomatoes. I spread about half of the remaining milk mixture on bottom of pan (after making  the filling). I added 1/4 tsp. pepper to both the filling and the leftover milk mixture. I filled the tortillas, placed them in the pan, and spread the extra filling over the tortillas, then continued as written with the French-fried onions and tomatoes. This dish was OK not great. It seemed to be missing some flavoring, a little bland. Maybe I'll experiment with spices a little next time, if there is a next time. Anyway, a good recipe with room for improvement.

Loved it.  But I made it vegetarian style, I boiled some potaotes for 10 minutes and then added  fresh broccoli for 5 minutes more.  I continued with recipe as directed.  My family loved it!!!  Will make again.

This was really easy to do i added some rice a roni fried rice to the mix and topped with mozzerella instead of cheddar and my kids begged for more which doesn't happen very often. think next time i'll try to use the canned chicken instead of tuna and add some scallions. YUMMY!

This is a refreshingly different way to use Tuna, and a good one dish meal. I was surprised at how much my family liked it.  I will definitley make this again.

I didn't have fried onions (but added minced onions for flavor) and we didn't miss them.  My only complaint was that the rolled tortillas hardened on the bottom and were hard to cut.  Next time I'll smear a little sauce on the bottom to hopefully keep them moist & soft.

My family and I absolutely LOVED this meal and it's hard to find things my very picky daughter will happily sit at the table for. Now that I've tried it 'by the book' I'll be having fun experimenting!

Made this recipe with tinned salmon. It's delicious! Used what I had on hand. Garlic chapati's, low fat condensed mushroom soup, trim milk,
fresh steamed brocolli & low fat cheese (edam)
& steamed onion rings. Baked without the foil until cheese was bubbling then covered with foil & lowered oven temperature. My husband thought it was a fish pie! Very tasty! Healthy too!

This turned out delicious. I used whole grain tortillas, and it still turned out much better than I expected. Instead of putting the milk in cold, I made a rue with some onions and then added about 1.5 cups of milk. That way I had more soup to add to the tuna mixture. I also added a bit of tony's for extra seasoning

I found this recipe to be really good, even though I usually can't stand tuna. my boyfriend raved about it and I enjoyed it too.  The leftovers were a little soggy the next day, but I expected that, so it was alright.  I'll definitely make this  recipe again!
