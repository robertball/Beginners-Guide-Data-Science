Easy and good.  I top mine with meringue and no one knows it's not "homemade".

I recently found out that I have gestational diabetes, and this is a great low carb/low sugar recipe. I replaced all ingredients with no sugar and reduced fat products, and it still satisfies my sweet tooth. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Been making this for years - fabulous!  Even tastes great when I do a "healthier version" using skim milk, SF/FF pudding, reduced fat NILLA wafers and COOL WHIP FREE. Hubby LOVES this one!
