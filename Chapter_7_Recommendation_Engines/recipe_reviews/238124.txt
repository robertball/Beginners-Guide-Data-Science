Absolutely delicious! I'm feeling a bit of nostalgia, as I eat my third piece of this bread. It's just like my Mom used to make. I should mention that I did not use the prunes, as I had exactly 1 cup of chopped dates left in a bag and about 6 whole dates, that I just chopped up and subbed for the prunes. My teenage daughter arrived from school and asked "what's in this bread? Are those chocolate chips?" ... (Me) "No, those are dates" . . . (Her) "why do you always put weird stuff in there, you know I don't like that stuff?" . . . (she takes a piece anyway). Five minutes later she takes another piece . . . (Me) "I thought you didn't like that weird stuff in there?" . . . (Her) "I don't!" (takes another piece). Enough said, it's delicious whether she will admit it or not.

Thanks for posting this recipe!! I really do love this bread! It is moist & dense. It makes the perfect breakfast bread or perhaps it's dessert at breakfast when we spread whipped cream cheese on top of our slices after toasting them to carmelize all the sugary fruits. Recipe is great. Only thing I modify is I don't soak & throw away raisins but use dried cranberries and just pour water with baking soda over all the dried fruit I combine in my initial big bowl (cranberries, dried figs, dates). I tend to make 2-3 at a time & give as gifts, while we keep one to plow into. It keeps well over days & days wrapped in press n' seal.

A wonderful recipe that reminded me of my grandmother stated that bread. The addition of the prune was unusual, but good. I'll be making this a lot more.

This date nut bread was delicious. Moist, good texture, and perfect flavors.  I didn't change a thing and I will definitely make this again. A slice of date nut bread, a slather of cream cheese, and a cup of tea. Perfect! Thanks Grandma

The recipe calls for baking soda until you get to step 4 where it says baking powder.  I didn't know which was the right one so I went with the first.  The bread is tasty but crumbles. Don't know if it's because of the baking soda/powder mix up.

Following another review, I substituted dried cherries for raisins and mixed them with the prunes and dates. Baking (at high altitude, 6500 feet) took the full 65 minutes, and I had to cover the top with foil the last 20. It is moist and has a unique taste, perfect with a spread of cream cheese. Overall an excellent recipe.

Very good date nut bread! The bread part is light in color (compared to another darker bread that is one of my favorites).  I used all dates (no prunes) as I had dates that needed to be used. I would definitely try it with the prunes another time. The instructions mention baking powder. Even though it wasn't in the list of ingredients, I still added about 1/2 tsp. I subbed unsweetened apple sauce for the butter, as a reviewer suggested. The next time, I would cut back of the sugar (plenty of sweetness from the dates) and also cut back on the nuts. I used a 9x5 pan, and the bread tested done at 50 min (I would even take it out sooner....it was a little more brown than I would like and just a tad dry to me). Great for breakfast this morning with a little cream cheese and a hot cup of coffee.

I used strong coffee instead of hot water. Otherwise I made no changes and loved the recipe.

This is the recipe I was seeking.  Perfect.  One change I might try is using applesauce instead of butter because I like a HEAVY fruit-nut bread.  This is dense and moist...but I like it when it's a workout just to lift it.

Very good.  Followed suggestion above and skipped the soaking raisins step - just put dried cranberries, prunes and dates in bowl, sprinkled on baking Soda and then added boiling water.  Used 1/2 cup turbinado sugar and 1/2 cup sugar substitute.  Turned out great...  definitely one to make again.
