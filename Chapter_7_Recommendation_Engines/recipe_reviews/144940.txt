I thought it was good, and other people did too! I found it needed about a tablespoon of vinegar and some salt.

Refreshing!  I added salt and pepper, and maybe next time I'll add some garlic, but this was very good as is over a mixed greens salad with sliced apple, red onion, tomatoes and a little feta cheese.

Awesome! Threw a crushed clove of garlic in too. Mint flavour is nicely subtle. Loved this over quinoa salad with kale, peppers, feta, dill and other items. Deeelish!

Very delicious!  I also served it on roasted monk fish.  It really enhanced the flavor of the fish.

It was good! It was refreshing, better than putting mayo in with a salad like we Russians usually do, and more tasty than just oil and lemon! I made a salad with cherry tomatoes and  chilled saut√©ed mushrooms with oregano! So it went perfectly with my new summer salad!

Loved it. I added crushed garlic and salt to it. Did not strain the dressing. Liked the mint leave texture of the dressing. Used the dressing over apples, cucumber, broccoli and little chopped red onion.  It tasted very nice with sweetness of apple countering tangy taste of lemon. - Lata
