This is a really tasty and easy recipe.  Before making it, I read the reviews and noticed that a lot of people said that it was too thin.  The problem lies in the fact that they did not cook it long enough.  The recipe say to cook until "sugar is dissolved and mixture is smooth".  If you do not cook it long enough the fondue is very thin and watery, but if you let it come to a boil, it thickens up nicely and is very very tasty :)!  I would highly recommend this recipe.  We dipped cannolis, trefoil girl scout cookies, lady fingers, pineapple, peanut butter and fluff grahm crackers, and whatever else was in the kitchen in this and it was very good!

Very, very good!  I have made it 3 times in 2 weeks.  A very fancy presentation.  Make sure to use Vitamin D evap. milk.  I used skim the first time and that is why it never thickened up.  Also, I find it reheats better than serving immediately.  I premade it, refrigerated it, and then microwaved it and put it in my fondue dish prior to serving. Perfect!  I dipped pineapples, strawberries, pretzels, and angel food cake.

Amazingly easy to make and tastes amazing too!  I made this in my Rival "Little Dipper" crockpot.  It fit just perfectly.  I took it to a school board meeting and got outstanding reviews.  We dipped fruit (I dried it with paper towels after washing), pound cake, and pretzels.  It is addictive-people kept returning to the pot to try something new to dip.  Thanks for a super-easy recipe!!

Fantastic and easy!  The consistency was perfect for dipping bananas, apples and almond macaroons.  The cocoa provided a much richer chocolate flavor than candy bars and also produced a much smoother texture than I've gotten in the past when I used chocolate chips or baking squares.  Much faster prep time, too.  Will definitely make this again.  Kids and husband loved it.

Absolutely delicious!  Ive made this twice in a week.  My favorite to dip was bananas and cut up sarah lee pound cake (the frozen one)  Mine was plenty thick and stuck to the pieces of cake and fruit just fine.   I will make this one again and again.  Oh yea, and so easy.  Total prep time is about 5 min.

I made this yesterday at our friends super bowl party and it was a big hit! I used fresh pieces of fruit, pound cake and marshmellows. My best buddy's son make homemade ice cream so some of us took a slice of pound cake, put the ice cream on top along with strawberries and drizzled the yummy fondue on top. Excellent! It's interesting that some people said that theirs turned out watery. I can't imagine why, as ours was a perfect consistency that clung to the fruit very well. I had forgotten to bring the evaporated milk, but whole milk worked just fine. Thanks Hershey!

Wonderful rich chocolate taste. This doesn't clump and harden like melted chocolate. It stays nice and smooth.  It has a much better temperature tolerance than chocolate does when dipping cold items like strawberries. Can make it ahead of time and leave on stove top, then just warm in micro for a few seconds then put on your fondue pot. Love any recipe that doesn't send me crazy just before the guests come!

This is the best recipe for chocolate fondue.  No need to try any others.  One reviewer was right when saying you can lick the bowl clean.  In fact instead of dippers just give everyone a spoon and dig in.  A couple of things.  I think you need to make a double recipe of this.  It didn't mention if this could be made ahead and just reheated.  It only takes a few minutes to prepare so I wasn't away from my guests for long the first time I made it but the second time I made it ahead and it tasted just the same (and I was able to clean up before guests arrived).  This is simple and easy and just the best recipe ever. I will be trying this over cake as well for a frosting.

I have made this twice.  I only use 1/2 the amount of butter called for.  It comes out great.  Cutting down the butter might help those of you who are having trouble with it being too runny.  Otherwise, you might want to make it ahead, refrigerate and rewarm.  I now keep a container of this in my fridge all the time.  It is great for fruit snacks, ice cream, etc.  This is a good basic recipe.  I can think of a lot of variations....kahlua....irish cream....fruit zest, etc.  I cannot wait to try them.
THANKS HERSHEY'S.  I love your chocolate!!

I think anyone who ended up with a runny sauce maybe should try it again!  It was thick and creamy from the get-go, and was wonderful with all of our fruit--I agree that we needed bananas or maybe peanut butter balls next time! We thought it was a bit "cocoa-ey" and not fudgey, but I didn't use Hershey's, we used up what we had...next time we will use Hershey's.  We even substituted honey for sugar, and it was super yummy!! Definitely worth trying, just keep stirring!

This may have been the best chocolate fondue I've ever had.  I'm not proud to admit it, but I actually licked the pan clean when my husband wasn't looking.  I followed the advice of others and brought it to a boil and then let it boil over low heat for about five minutes, stirring constantly.  We used bananas, strawberries, pound cake and marshmallows, and my husband and I can't wait to pour it over vanilla ice cream!

This was great and so easy to make. Everyone raved about it. It is not too sweet, simply perfect.   We dipped fruits (strawberries, banana, dried apricots) cookies, and marshmallows.  The biggest hit was dipping a marshmallow or banana chunk in the fondue and then rolling it in chopped nuts. I also made an "adult" version by substituting Kahlua for the vanilla in one batch.   We also use this as an ice cream topping.  Everyone was so impressed when I made this "homemade hot fudge" and set it out with ice cream, whipped cream, nuts and cherries.

This was a hit at my housewarming party and I loved that it was so extremely easy to make.  This recipe will definitely be making a comeback at my next "fondue" party.

Guests at a large neighborhood gathering loved this fondue. I served it with strawberries, banana pieces, pound cake, macaroons, & mandarin oranges. Keep the heat low, though, to avoid it becoming too thick.

I made this twice now - the first time the chocolate got a little clumpy - which happens when the wettness of fresh fruits gets mixed in so the second time around I cleaned the strawberries the day before to give them time to dry and didn't cut them.  But it was best with bananas.  I only found it a little runny when it was first heating up.  Everyone loved it!

The advice to cook a little "hotter and longer" worked really well- thanks!

This is indeed a fondue with strong chocoate flavour. I used it as a base and divided it up into 6 small bowls, adding a different flavouring to each bowl (peanut butter, mint, Irish cream, Amaretto, Grand Marnier and coconut rum). This recipe was excellent to add these flavours to- my guests raved. 

I agree- on it's own, this might be a little strong.

This fondue had a wonderful taste to it, but the consistency was a bit too thin for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of having to double the recipe in order to fill my fondue pot and making it a day ahead of when I was serving it.  I would describe the consistency as a little thicker than Hersheys chocolate syrup.  I prefer my fondue to be more thick, like fudge sauce, so you can really glob it on your fondue dippers.  This sauce, although delicious, kept dripping off my fruit and cake, leaving little fondue left on my dipper to enjoy.

I have tried several chocolate fondue recipes (all of them a lot more complicated than this one)... this is the best by far. It's a foolproof, easy recipe that takes very little time and preperation and tastes great with anything (strawberries, marshmallows, brownies, and bananas are some of my favorites). The leftover fondue is even delicious used as hot fudge for ice cream.

Good Recipe and easy to make.   It didn't do well in my fondue pot because it continued to cook after I transferred from the stove top.   If you don't use a fondue pot this is an excellent receipe.

I was a little worried about trying this fondue, because of a couple reviews of it being to thin.  That wasn't the case at all!  This is a wonderful, rich recipe.  I served with fresh fruit and homemade angel and pound cakes.  Lots and lots of compliments!

Definitely tasty. I would cut out a tablespoon or two of the butter and maybe add a pinch of salt next time. Very rich and fudgy! Yum!

This fondue is quick, easy and has garnered much favor everywhere I have served it.  I do choose to use higher end cocoa - Hershey's Special Dark and greatly enjoy multiply dippers, especially fruit - pineapple is outstanding!   So if you're looking for an easy and impressive recipe, go ahead and try it - the only thing I would say about it otherwise is that it can seem a bit runny, - it's not a thick fondue- but flavor is out of the ballpark, thus my rating.  Be careful not to put it over top of too hot of Sterno fuel, as then it tends to scorch the bottom!  Happy munching!

I am famous for screwing up recipes.  When I read that this recipe was at risk for being thin, I figured I'd be in trouble.  I had read to cook it a little longer and a little hotter, which is exactly what I did and it was perfect.  A great Valentines day treat, super easy to make, and really yummy and fudgy.  Perfect!

I've made this fondue twice now, and the second time, I also had problems with it turning out too thin.  THERE IS AN EASY SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.  Cook it a little hotter, a little longer.  All I did was heat it up for another 30 seconds and it was PERFECT!

This wasn't like any fondue I've tasted. It was too rich and very chocolaty, almost overpowering. You could only eat a little bit. I would like more of a classic fondue taste. I won't be making this again.

This fondue was so easy to make and it was wonderful.  The perfect consistency and flavor.  It was a big hit with both adults and kids!  We loved it just as is.

This recipe was so simple that I was skeptical of the outcome.  I was SO suprised at the richness of the flavor and texture.  My husband raved and so did my guests.  Well done!

This is an excellent recipe for chocolate fondue!  It is not too sweet which is a good contrast to the natural sweetness in the fruit.  We dipped bananas, granny smith apples, pineapples and marshmallows (which we then rolled in a chopped nut/chocolate chip mixture).  We will definitely make this again!!

I doubled the recipe on this thinking I'd need more, but found I had too much. :)  So, now I have chocolate fondue for later. :)  It turned out awesome! :)  VERY Fudgy/chocolatey!!  We had cut strawberries, cut bananas, marachino cherries, and pieces of pound cake with this fondue.  It was so yummy! :9 I'd definitely make it again, but this time not double the recipe unless I have like six people eating this. :)

We made this recipe for our New Years party. It was a great success with all, adults and children. It went very well with the pound cake that we made and was washed down nicely with a strong cabernet.

I made this for my first Kentucky Derby party and put it in a chocolate fountain. I made this x4 to fill my fountain and had that much extra to fill as needed.  I have made this in the microwave, especially if I ran low for the fountain, just cook on medium power and stir every minute.  With the fountain, if the chocolate gets thick and kind of seperated, I slowly added more canned milk to the top tier of the fountain and mixed it in the main bottom bowl with a high heat spatula or scrapper. I also used it for my sisters graduation and everyone knew who to come to if it needed filling or thinning!

This is SOOOOO good! I had to cook a little longer to thicken it as one of the reviews suggested and it turned out just great! Great with pound cake cubes, strawberries, marshmallows and bananas! We used this for a teen girls sleep-over as the midnight snack. YUM!!!

This was awesome!  Everyone loved it!  So simple and yet so good!  I'll make this again and again.  I didn't think this would be as good as my "regular" recipe but I didn't have any chocolate so I had to go to plan B with this one.  Thank God! My old recipe is out the window!  I'll only make this from now on.  Besides being simple, it held up so well.  Yum!!!

This is such a yummy fondue recipe- perfect for dipping!  It's the only chocolate fondue recipe I've found where you use cocoa instead of chocolate bars.  We will definitely be making this recipe again and again and again!

This is very buttery. I let it cook in my fondue thing for quite a while and the butter turned into a lake of grease on the top. It tasted ok, but I think that just melted chocolate would better.

This was the best Chocolate Fondue ever!  I did half regular cocoa and half dark chocolate cocoa.  It's not a rich and sweet fondue, but it is so, so good. I have trashed my old chocolate fondue recipe, so I won't get them confused.  It is not a thick fondue, so your cake doesn't crumble in the fondue.

This was a Valentines Day dessert for my family-a first at fondue for most of the kids.  I chose this recipe because it looked easy and it is, and the ingredient list was on hand!  I substituted heavy whipping creme for the evaporated milk and it was perfect. The kids had a blast dipping pound cake, bananas and strawberries, and the chocolate coated the fruit nicely, and wasn't overly sweet. (wash strawberries ahead of time and make sure they are dry) A really nice change of pace for a dessert that was easy but seemed very special. This may become a tradtional dessert for Valentines Day from here on. Thanks, I'll hang on to this recipe.

This is terrific if you're careful with it, but if you neglect to stir it constantly, it is thin and bitter with all the ingredients clumping at the bottom of your fondue pot, and burning there.  Still if you're attentive to it, it's quit yummy.

This recipe turned out perfectly- I did use a little less butter and evaporated milk than the recipe called for.  The chocolate had a fantastic consistency- not runny, not too thick.  I served it to my 3 boys with strawberries, bananas, apples, and pound cake and it was a fantastic success!  Make this chocolate- you won't be disappointed!

This fondue is GREAT!!! We served it with chopped up apples, pineapples, pound cake, cheesecake, and strawberries. Not too sweet, good consistency, a big hit with everyone!

I also found this very runny.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it didn't thicken up at all.  Thought it would turn out great as I had read the reviews beforehand, but I was dissapointed.

This recipe is great.  I add a a little more butter so it's more liquidy for sundaes.

This fondue had a great taste, but was not thick and fudgy like I thought it would be.  It did not stick to the fruit well at all.  Somehow, it needs to have an ingredient that would thicken it up considerably.

This makes a very, very thin, watery fondue. I added about a pound of powdered sugar to thicken it and then it was almost disgustingly sweet. I was very disappointed.

This fondue is great and so easy to make.  I followed other reviewers advice and let it simmer longer, where it thickened up to the desired consistency.  I have made this several times for company and everyone loves it!  (I recommend using bananas and marshmallows for dipping as well!)

This tasted great, it took a little while to thicken up and did not get as hard as I had hoped but the flavor was great and I will make it again better knowing what I would be getting.  We dipped strawberries, bannanas, pound cake and pretzels

WOW!!!  I needed a fondue recipe for New Years and was not sure about this one looking at the ingrediants.  This was a HUGE hit for my party and EVERYONE wanted the recipe.  We dipped leftover fruit in the chocolate and put in the freezer for a yummy treat the next day (Banana and Cheesecake where the most liked items!)  Thank you for such an easy and tasty recipe!

You must try this recipe for making chocolate fondue.  I thought just melting chocolate would be better, but I can see how that might be a little too thick.  This is so simple and yet so good!

YUMMY!  We dipped strawberries and pound cake in it.  The pound cake fell apart but it was yummy scooping it out of the chocolate.  I also baked a cake one day and poked holes all over it and poured this on top like an icing.  It was SOOO YUMMY!!!

I would give this 20 stars if I could.  This was GREAT!  It made a LOT, though... well, it would probably be about right for 5-7 people.  This was super easy and super yummy.
I served it with pound cake, apples, strawberries, maraschino cherries, and forgot to serve the banana!  whoops!  :)

This was very yummy and so easy to make!  I love that it only has a few ingredients and that they're things I usually have in the house.  We whipped this up in minutes for New Years Eve and served it with pretzels, marshmallows, strawberries, bananas, and chunks of pound cake and angel food cake.  Mmmmm!!!

I made no subsitutions to this recipe and it turned out wonderfully.  It was really very good and not too sweet.  I did have the element on medium-low rather than low.  Will make again!

A taste of Heaven.  This was really good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I only used two-thirds C of sugar instead of three-fourths C.  I dipped strawberries and bananas.  Yummy!!!

This was taste but average in my opinion.  Using Nestle chocolate as a base works better for me and gives the flavor I love in fondue and for dipping strawberries and fruit.

This fondue was so easy and so good! I do think you could use slightly less butter, but it is great the way it is. I used a wire wisk and it was so smooth!!! It is great as hot fudge over ice cream.
