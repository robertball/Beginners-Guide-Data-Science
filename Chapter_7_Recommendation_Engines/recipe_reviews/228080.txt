this is incredible. we didn't have all the fresh spices on hand, but i faked it using Poultry Seasoning, which is basically all of these spices only dried (McCormicks brand is what i happened to have) and it was perfect.

Holy Yum!  I didn't follow the ingredient measurements exactly, but it turned out great!  I like the idea of using maple syrup next time.

Loved it as written. Good to taste REAL sausage again and know exactly what is in the food I'm giving my family. To make it even better, the cost ended up being almost half of what I would have paid for the store-bought stuff. And it tastes half as good as this! Thanks.

This is great sausage. I quit looking for a sausage recipe after I tried this one. I don't keep fresh spices around so I used dried at half the recommended amount where fresh was called for. Yum. I make them into little meatballs and bake them. In the morning, I half or quarter a few and throw them in with potatoes and eggs.

Little too much sage and also a little spicy for us (but that's a personal taste preference).   Not sure you need both cayenne and hot pepper flakes, but I would omit the cayenne in the future and cut the sage in half.  Also, sausage patties are not very thick, so plan on reducing your cooking time, otherwise, you'll have dried out sausage.  Overall, pretty good recipe.

I don't think I can ever buy commercial sausage again! I omitted all the pepper, (I don't like spicy sausage), added more sage, (I love sage!), and used dried spices because I didn't have fresh. Excellent recipe!! Seriously, you have to make this!! Next time I might add some shredded apple for a sweet variation.

Our daughter doesn't eat pork ('cause pigs are cute!), so I make her turkey sausage quite often.  I happened to see this recipe.  It looked interesting and had great reviews.   I used a 2.5 lb. package of ground turkey from Sam's Club and adjusted the spice amounts accordingly.   It was pouring rain, so I didn't bother cutting fresh herbs.  I used dried sage, dried thyme and a dash of herbes de provence and halved the quantity (dried vs. fresh).  This is hands down one of the best sausages I've ever made.  Not just the best turkey sausage, the best of ANY kind!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely Phenomenal!!!  Tastes phenomenal, tastes almost exactly like Jimmy Dean sausage patties or ground sausage, but its better because no added sugars or wheat by products!

These are awesome !! I used ground chicken because that's what I had in the freezer, and I didn't have any nutmeg so I added a little paprika. The whole family loved them! If I would've known how easy it was to make breakfast sausage I would've done it a long time ago! And love knowing what is going into my food.

Will make again.  It's better than brand sausage and doesn't have corn syrup and fillers.

Used chicken thighs with skin and breast.  Ground in my KA.
Mixed fresh sage and powdered sage and poultry seasoning and OMGosh!  This is sooo very delicious and juicy.  Son and kids loved this.  Once you make breakfast sausage yourself, I really don't think you will ever want to buy it again.  If you don't have a grinder, I think that using a food processor would be OK too.  Made into 2 oz patties and froze on tray, then packaged them.  Do Try!

I love the recipe!! I'm not a fan of spice so I sometimes swap the cayenne for minced garlic and only a pinch of chili peppers. I quiet often double the batch and freeze part of it; great for breakfasts on the run.

I was pleasantly surprised by just how good this sausage is!  My local grocery store had a pack of fresh "poultry seasoning" spices - sage, thyme and rosemary, so that worked out perfectly.  I used the same amounts that the recipe called for except decreased the cayenne pepper by just a little and left out the nutmeg (I thought I had some but couldn't find it). They turned out yummy and pleasantly spicy!  Also, I found that my patties browned a little quick and I wasn't sure they were cooked through, so I popped them into the oven for a few minutes at 350 degrees.  I will definitely make this again!

Really great sausage. Tried cause it looked healthier, cook making because we love the taste. We make it the night before we cook it for the most flavor. Freezes well too!

I thought it was really tasty.  I wouldn't change anything.  Better than the commercial brand sausages I normally crave.

This sausage is delicious. I've made it numerous times. Being 8mo pregnant I will cut down on the salt, pepper and cayenne next time. It's a little much for me to handle right now. But when I'm not pregnant it's spot on! I love how easy it is to just through in the kitchen aid and mix, I love that it's an easy recipe to be in control

Great recipe. I used ground goat, and added maple syrup. I left out the cayenne and red pepper because my husband doesn't do well with pepper. Yum! Will definitely make it again, and try it on chicken and beef.

Made this this morning after partially thawing out a few pork chops.  Cut them into chunks, and added all to the food processor.  In about 5 minutes, I did a taste test with a little bitty sausage patty, adjusted my salt and pepper, and it was good to go!  Finished cooking them, put them back into the freezer ready for breakfast this week!  I am addicted to Wendy's avocado bacon flatbread breakfast sandwiches, so I use a small white tortilla heated gently in the pan.  after turning it over, I put on some cheese and the guacamole (1/2 on one side 1/2 on the other).  I usually put some bacon in there after microwaving, but this sausage is going in instead!  Fold it up and it's breakfast!  So yummmy!

Fabulous recipe!  I've tried other recipes and they are too salty or too many flavors... This one is great and with the right lean meat, it's a perfect and much healthier alternative to anything at the store.

Really good Paleo friendly sausage. Newcomer, but this will be something I make frequently!
