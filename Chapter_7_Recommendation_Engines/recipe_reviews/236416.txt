It was my first time making chowder and this recipe was good.  I followed the recipe as written using the clams and shrimp only I had to substitute the haddock for sole and the lobster for fresh scallops.  I will make this again.

Often times I surf the web looking for ingredients for newly created recipes and of course check out all recipes (that’s a given for me).I saw your recipe online and decided to adopt from it. I wanted to make a medley of seafood items in a dish very much like yours. I love your ingredients and from that I made a few changes and here’s what I did.Instead of using water I  exchanged that for chicken broth and whole milk instead of half-and-half.I upped the butter to one cup.  In my sauté I chopped celery, green onions and white onions.  I added. Oyster sauce, and plenty of obey seasoning. I omitted the tomatoes.  Of course the corn and potatoes.I included cod fish, salmon, shrimp, scallops, oysters, clams, and squid I wanted  but I didn’t have any on hand.       In conclusion my dish was scrumptious. Thank you for helping me through your recipe in creating a dish of seafood medley.  Kevin, Washington DC

It couldn't find bar clams, so used clam juice and a can of clams. Used prechopped seafood chowder mix (fresh). Added 2 cloves garlic and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and extra herbs and lots of fresh ground black pepper.

Excellent!  I used 4  fresh Jumbo Tanner Crab legs instead of lobster and bar clams.  I also added a little Old Bay Seasoning and Paprika to make it more like a Cajun seafood chowder minus the cayenne.  I will make this again..

It's a good base of the recipe but I would definitely change some things when making it again. The corn was just overpowering and too weirdly sweet for it, it tasted more like a corn chowder than a seafood chowder. So I would probably just chop up some carrots and celery next time. I would also add more potato to the mixture and not add the dairy until much closer to the end. But it's not a bad recipe and a good base to jump off and customize to your own taste.

I'm making this again as it is delicious. This is a favorite of my son so I'm making extra and will take him enough for left overs. I usually only include shrimp, lobster and clam but may try a different combination this time. THANKS for a great recipe.

OMG the best clam/corn chowder that I've made so far! I replaced the cherry tomatoes with celery instead.

I used only clams and lobster for the seafood element. Used 1 potato, 1 carrot and 1 celery stalk for the vegetables. Used half as much cream as was called for and subbed in seafood stock. Added seasonings like thyme and dill. Garnished with a dash of hot sauce.

This recipe is sensational-I always follow the recipe exactly for the first time, I used a fresh lobster however instead of canned.  This is now on my list of favorites and I will definitely make it again.

It was my first time making any Chowder. This is so easy to make and everyone raved about how creamy and delicious it is. I used haddock, shrimp,  scallops and lobster. Made a few adjustments and  it was done. Will be making it more often for a winter delight.

This was soooo good!  The cheese in the recipe was about $15 so I used fresh parmigiana instead and it was still great.  The 1st time I made it was just a trial run so I cut corners by skipping the lobster and using cod instead of haddock .   It was still delicious.  For Christmas Eve I used the lobster and haddock and really didn't notice any difference. I also left out the tomatoes for Christmas Eve.  They added nice color, but the skins pulled away from the rest of it and overall I just didn't think they were necessary.  Next time I might add some scallops!

This recipe is awesome! What I love the most about it, is that’s it’s so versatile to anyone’s taste buds. I used fresh minced clams, lump crab meat and haddock. I added minced celery instead of tomatoes and anchovy paste for extra taste. This is absolutely a 5 star recipe. Thank you!

Just finished with the Chowder. It was absolutely the tastiest chowder I have ever put in my mouth. I changed a few things. I couldn't find lobster so I used the meat from (3) huge crab legs. I couldn't find the fish so I substituted nice flounder fillet. I used (2) pounds of 
nice shrimp and some nice fresh clams.  This is a bit expensive, at least the way I made it, but what an awesome bowl of chowder.
I have friends coming over later in the evening and I can't wait to serve them a bowl of my newly discovered chowder.
Thanks

First time making a chowder so I wanted to follow the recipe to make it come out well.  Problem was, I was not able to find all the seafood ingredients so I used fresh shrimp, canned baby whole clams, pollock filet and small bay scallops, I did add in some Old South Bay seasoning, and a small bottle of extra clam juice since I didn't have the canned lobster juice to use.  It came out so delicious, everyone loved it and the recipe is forgiving if you use different kinds of seafood with the chowder base, add some spice or alter the consistency to your liking.  Will definitely make this again, thank you!

I was looking for a chowder recipe for the leftover clams, crab, lobster, potato and corn from a large steam pot a few days before. This recipe was perfect. I used the corn from the cob and added a little cayenne pepper otherwise I followed the recipe. Fantastic!!! My husband and kids said this was the best chowder they've ever had. Thank you.

I loved this chowder!  I didn't put in the whole kernal corn but by adding the cream style corn it gave the base a very unique, delicious flavor.  I had to add more liquid than I expected because of the flour so I added all the clam juice and a bottle of clam juice plus milk.  The only thing I would change is I would cook the potato before adding the half & half to prevent the chowder from sticking to the bottom of the pot.

This is a great recipe, I modified it by using cuttlefish instead of the clams,fresh lobster meat. I added chopped Surimi, mixed seafood blend (scallops shrimp's calamari).I added two stocks of celery to the onions in the beginning. The seafood blend it was frozen and I did not thaw. Liquid from the seafood thinned out the chowder to a perfect consistency. I waited till the seafood add simmered
