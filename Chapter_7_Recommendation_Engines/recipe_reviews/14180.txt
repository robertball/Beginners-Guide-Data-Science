nice change for a salad.  after reading the reviews about it being too oily, here are my suggestions.  first, mix the vinegar, sugar and oregano in a bowl.  i measured a 1/4 cup of olive oil and only drizzled it into the vinegar while whisking.  when the consistency looks good to you, taste test it and then add either more oil or a splash or 2 more vinegar. I did not use the full 1/4 cup of oil, but that is my personal preference.  then add salt & pepper if you like.  also, many reviews talked about there being too much dressing and the salad is just sitting in it.  once the tomatoes sit in the refrigerator, they release juices...this causes there to be more liquid in the bottom of the bowl, you will have some liquid even if you use a very small amount of dressing.  this recipe really is a 5 star for taste, however, due to the instructions i give it a 4.

This is a delicious recipe, assuming you actually like all of the ingredients to start with.  I used kalamata olives instead of black olives and subbed some balsamic vinegar for part of the red wine vinegar.  My husband and I couldn't stop eating it (so we didn't care if the kids wouldn't touch it).  Sprinkled a little feta on top at serving time--yum!

Delicious!  Everyone that tried this has loved it.  I used grape tomatoes and ¾ cup of green olives instead of 1 cup.  This was very easy to prepare.  It is also something delicious to make the night before company arrives because it tastes even better the next day after all of the juices marinate!  Oh, I also didn’t add the pine nuts until just before serving because I didn’t want them to get soggy while it marinated overnight.  Great recipe, I will be making this one again!!!

WOW! I will def. make it again. I needed to make it ahead of time so I prepared all the ingredients except the tomatoes and mixed them in a bowl. Marinated them overnight and then tossed the mix (didn't use all- about 3/4 of it) over the tomatoes 1/2 before serving. By doing this I did not have to put the tomatoes in the refrigerator -which i don't do, they lose flavor- and the salad doesn't get too runny. VERY nice!

I thought the flavors in this were delicious! Such an odd assortment of things to put together, but it was wonderful. One thing to remember, there is A LOT of vinaigrette. I used about half of it and it still was too much. It made the salad taste too oily for my liking. Next time I will use less than 1/4 cup oil and add more later if I need to. Otherwise, great recipe!

Over the past couple of years I have made this recipe many times and it has become a family favorite. It's especially pretty as a holiday dish because of the red and green colors, and it's wonderful in the summer when we have fresh garden tomatoes. I've added the little yellow tomatoes and green peppers for extra color and the salad always tastes great. I even get requests for this salad when I'm invited to potlucks or parties. 
I, too, have found that the amount of oil can be reduced without any noticeable effect and I like to increase the amount of vinegar for extra tang. The toasted pine nuts impart a unique (delicious) flavor and are the crowning touch that sets this salad apart from the usual potluck fare.

Scored again! This salad is great. I had my worries because of the ingredients but I was wrong big time. I cannot wait to make this for some friends. The colors together were beautiful. I already had some toasted pine nuts leftover from another recipe so that was a little bit of a time saver. Used grape tomatoes because that is what they had at Sams Club. Also, I had pimento stuffed green olives, whole, not sliced, so I just sliced them and kept the pimentos in the mix. The dressing was the perfect amount. I just love Allrecipes and everyone that contributes. THANK YOU!!!

I was a little worried when I served this at a dinner party for several people who are wonderful cooks.  I didn't need to be.  The flavors blended beautifully and the nuts added a delightful flavor.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and halved the vinaigrette (not just the olive oil) and it worked well.  This salad is great!

Very creative salad and much more interesting than the typical  tomato-cucumber variety.  Flavorful and colorful melange of ingredients all brought together with a light vinaigrette. I left out the sugar - don't like "sweet" in salads - and I used fresh oregano because I have it in my garden.  I took the easy way out with toasting the pine nuts by doing it in the microwave on a paper plate.  It was refreshing to have an unboring tomato salad for something a little different.

Too much onion, too much oil but other than that it's really tasty! Olives and pine nuts play the important role in making this salad tasty.

We LOVE tomatoes and didn't care for this at all.
The ingredients sounded wonderful and full of flavor on their own - but came out sort of bland tasting in this dish. I even added more red wine vinegar and garlic salt, but it didn't seem to help. We liked the concept (esp. with a garden full of cherry tomatoes) but I think I'll try a different vinegarette next time.

This salad is not only beautiful, it is quite tasty.   Like the other reviewers, I cut the olive oil in half.  I had to improvise because I was out of some of the ingredients.  I was out of red vinegar and had to use balsamic.  I did not have green onions, so I used a white onion instead.  I had fresh oregano (since it is still growing here in South Carolina).  I will make this recipe again!  The combination of the olives, tomatoes, and pine nuts are fantastic!  I will make this again!

Used red onion instead of green onion and kalamata olives instead of black olives. I also tossed in 2 tablespoons of capers for extra measure. Delicious! I'll definitely try the suggestion of using sunflower seeds next time -- sounds a lot easier than having to roast the pine nuts.

This is a most incredible salad!  I used half red cherry tomatoes and half yellow teardrop cherry tomatoes (they are sweeter than the red ones).  This combination added wonderful color and another layer of natural tomato sweetness.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar with no change in the flavor.  I also doubled the green onions, I love the contrast in flavor they provide.  I followed the recipe the first time and added the pine nuts as directed.  Now, to make sure the pine nuts retain their toasted crunch, I add them just before serving.  This salad also tastes better the second day after overnight marination, IF you have any leftover!  Everyone that has tried this salad absolutely loves it!

I love this recipe and used it frequently during the summer.  I halved grape tomatos and it turned out fine.  Party guests seem to love it or think it's just OK, but I have never had leftovers!

I made this for a Valentine's Dinner and it was wonderful!  Very pretty, too.  After four years together I never realized that my boyfriend didn't like olives, but he LOVED this salad.  He even had me send the recipe to his mom--the ultimate compliment!  Also, I usually don't review the recipes on here,but this one just had to get raves!!!  You have to try it!

We make this recipe (minus the sugar and vinegar), and serve it hot over pasta with fresh grated parmesan. It's delicious, and now one of our family favorites. Makes a great vegetarian meal. The higher the quality of tomatoes, the better. With fresh garden tomatoes it is amazing!

I LOVE this recipe, my friend made it and brought it to work, I loved it and had to make it myself. I followed the recipe except I didn't have any oregeno, so I used an itallian blend of spices, turned out great! I followed Missdvs advice and left the pine nuts on the side...YUMMY! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Oh Wow!! This is really good. I don't really eat tomatoes and even I loved this. My hubby had three helpings tonight. He said next time I make it to add red onion and little mozzerella cubes. This will be a summer staple! Thanx!

I absolutely love this combination of tomatoes, onions and olives!  I never would have dreamed they could be so great together, (not particularly loving green olives)!  THEY WORK GREAT!  I keep this mixture in the refrigerator, and have often added it to beautiful lettuce when having dinner guests.  Rather than using the dressing they show here, I used my favorite forever, called ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS GREEK/HOUSE DRESSING, found on this site, but scaling down to 10 servings for normal family use.

This recipe is yummy! I substituted sunflower kernels (roasted and salted) for the pine nuts due to the unavailability and the cost of the pine nuts. You do not have to toast the nuts in the skillet, simply add them! 

I also leave out the green olives because I do not care for them. One time I tried adding a little shredded Parmesan cheese (a couple of tablespoons) to the mixture -YUMMY!!!

This recipe is awesome! Do not leave out the pine nuts, and definately roast them! I tried the salad before and after adding the nuts, and they made a huge difference in the flavor and texture.

Wonderful and easy to eat!  I increased the dressing by half since I also added shredded iceberg lettuce and feta cheese on top...and put a few extra olives and tomatoes in.  Next time I will decrease the olive oil and add a little extra red wine vinegar.  Overall, this was very tasty and easy.

Absolutely delicious, exactly as written. This is a perfect way to enjoy fresh summer tomatoes. I tend to use fresh oregano instead of dried but can't imagine this would change the end result very much.

This is a very versatile recipe. I used cherry and yellow pear tomatoes. I made a simple dressing of pesto, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and salt. Delicious and pretty!

This was very good. My hubby and I are doing the South Beach Diet right now, and this was a great side dish for the diet. You could even leave out the sugar and it would still be good. I added some fresh cubed mozzarella which made it even better. We really enjoyed it.

This is SO good!  I used grape tomatoes (grocery didn't have cherry tomatoes), regular diced white onion, sunflower seeds (couldn't find pine nuts) and balsamic vinegar. I didn't use any salt (DH can't have it).  I am not a salad person (wish I was), but I could make a meal of this.

This was quite good - different and pretty.  One caution, though:  I used only 1/4 to 1/3 of the pine nuts, and that seemed like plenty to me.  I find them a little strong, and I think the full amount would have been overpowering.  I used the green olives with the pimientos, and it was fine.

I really liked this and I am not a huge tomato lover. I did not have olives so I cut up cucumbers into small chunks. I also added fresh basil and parsley to fresh oregano. I couldn't help but to add some dried cranberries because they were next to the nuts in the freezer. Delicious.

This is a delicious and healthy salad! I ended up using 2 packages of grape tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes, since they were more cost effective, and substituted some slivered almonds for the pine nuts (didn't have any on hand). Served it for dinner one night, and dh raved about it. We had company later in the week, and I served it again, only to hear how delicious it was! Thanks so much Keren! Definitely a keeper!

We loved this recipe! What a fresh, non-lettuce salad idea! Had to sub balsamic for the red wine vinegar and it was still great. Went great with our roasted chicken and couscous dinner. And I mixed the leftovers with the couscous to have a different salad the next day.

This looked like a unique salad, so thought I'd try it for company dinner. I used grape tomatoes and toasted the pine nuts. Based on other reviews I cut the dressing in half.I didn't have red wine vinegar so used Balsamic. The pine nuts went in right before serving to maintain the texture.

I was completely NOT impressed with this recipe.  The idea was good, but it had WAY too much oil in it (and I cut it in half) and really didn't have a melding of flavors.

this was yummmmm!so fresh and crisp..the pinenuts were an absolute delight. i halved the oil, used brown sugar and balsamic vinegar and increased the cherry tomatoes to 50. i also did not halve the tomatoes as they were becoming limp when i tried that. will definitely make this again and again!

I reduced the olive oil as suggested by other reviewers.  This was pretty good; probably rate it about a 3.5.  Definitely need the toasted pinenuts.  Also wouldn't salt it much; the black olives & the green olives are salty.  I added some shredded parmesan too which also has salt.

The pine nuts pushed this dish from 4 to 5 stars (I served them  on the side so they'd stay crunchy). This salad was even better the second day. The only thing I'd change is I'd use less olive oil. I love olive oil, but it was a little too much. Next time, I'll make it with fresh oregano.

The flavors were way too strong, even for olive lovers. I needed a recipe to use the multitude of cherry tomatos my garden is yielding, but I won't make this again. It may work better as a pasta salad.

Delicious! I didn't use the pine nuts (forgot to get them at the store), used grape tomatoes sliced in half and made it the night before. I worried that the tomatoes would fall apart but they stayed firm and the flavors blended wonderfully! The dressing is so light and so refreshing. Also, I bought a can of sliced black olives and used whole small green olives. It was a breeze to throw together!

Good, however made a few changes.  Added red onion, balsamic instead of red wine vinegar and fresh oregano instead of dried. Will be even better when the 'good' tomatoes show up at the farmers market.

I served this salad at a Memorial Day BBQ and it was a hit!  I used whole grape tomatoes instead of cutting cherry tomatoes in half because I didn't want the liquid from the tomatoes to water down the salad. I also added the dressing right before serving to avoid mushiness.  It was so fresh, so colorful, and tasted wonderful.  I will be serving this salad again and again and again.

This just wasn't as great as I had hoped - I followed the recipe almost exactly (something I rarely do, except for using "ugli" tomatoes instead of cherries.  It was a little bland - but I may make it again with a tweak or two.

Although I found making the salad quite labour intensive as I was doubling the recipe and had to slice all those olives, it was worth the effort.  I kept opening the fridge just to smell the great aroma and it looked fab too.  I think next time, if I was doubling the recipe, I would only make 1.5 times the dressing as it was a tad too oily and I used 120 tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe...the salad is excellent and somewhat addictive!  I would suggest using more tomatoes, maybe 60 instead of 40, as the strong flavor of the olives can be a bit overpowering and the tomato flavor tempers this a bit.  I ate this salad about 30 minutes after putting it together, and it was very good, but it was fabulous the next morning after it had time to marinate.

Thanks for all the suggestions on this recipe.  Like others, it was a huge hit at a backyard BBQ.  I halved the dressing, added feta cheese and loved every bite.  I did hear, "I don't even like olives, but this is great!".  My husband mixed it with another side dish of pasta wheels and basil and loved it. We're making it again tonight.

This is fabulous, thanks so much for this great recipe - I only use top-shelf olives (sometimes those "gourmet" ones from specialty grocers); there are never any leftovers ;-)

Good! This is a fun way to eat your veggies. For the vinaigrette, I started with 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar and drizzled olive oil in as I whisked. I did not add very much. After I made the vinaigrette, I poured it over cherry tomatoes, mozzarella bits, cucumbers, and green onion.

I love this salad! My family refers to it as "Favorite Salad" and it is at all birthday dinners! The only change I made was using sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts!

Delicious with a variety of tomatoes from the garden.  Added chopped fennel fronds and chives (instead of green onions), used Splenda (a diabetic in the family) and it was still excellent.  I go to this recipe over and over when tomatoes are plentiful.

A VERY tasty and appetizing salad - beautiful presentation!  After reading other reviews I used a bit less EVOO, about 1/3 cup, and substituted basil since I was out of oregano.  I tossed everything and let it sit in the fridge about an hour before serving.  I also ended up topping it with crumbled feta cheese and the end result was fantastic!  Highly recommend!

We LOVE this recipe. I do usually make a few changes however. I use balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, basil in place of oregano, and sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts. I have added diced cucumbers, but they seem to get a little lost in the mix. Anyway I fix it, it is always a hit! Thanks for the recipe.

Made exactly as written but added mozzerella balls cut in half.  Used stuffed green olives and black olives from the olive bar at the local market. Was especially good the following day.  Thanks for the recipe.

This truly tastes like fresh summer!  I did not have green onions so used fresh chives from my herb garden and a little sweet white onion.  Everything was great in this salad, a hit at the table with my family.

This was darn good! The toasted pine nuts are a must, add them just before serving. The oil in the dressing could be cut in half and the vinegar doubled, and I only used half the amout of green olives. I also used halved grape tomatoes instead of cherry because we prefer them at my house.

I really like this. I did not heat my mixture though and forgot the pine nuts. I served this chilled on a bed of iceberg lettuce and it was delish! I'll fix it next time according to the recipe. But either way, this is good!

I used whole grape tomato instead of cherry - I would say that's OK to do, but better if they were cut.  I loved the recipe, followed it exactly and used it at a family BBQ.  Some of the guests wouldn't try anything beyond hot dogs and potato salad, but the ones who tried it agreed it's really good.  I'll use this again for sure.

Was looking for a recipe to use our home-grown cherry tomatoes...this was wonderful! We've made it everytime we get about 40 tomatoes off the vine! What a wonderful and unique side-would never have thought to combine these ingredients, but it definitely works. Thank you !

Excellent and really different. I would forget adding salt, as it is really salty because of the olives. I added a few more green onions.

I liked this recipe alot.  I used grape tomatoes available in the stores right now.  Could use more than 40 grape tomatoes because they are smaller than cherry tomatoes.

Absolutely delicious and very diet friendly.  Made this probably 12 times so far and everyone I shared it with also loved it.  Definitely whisk in the olive oil a bit at a time!  The olive oil is really good fats and makes for a great diet friendly side or even lunch.  My whole family loved this (even the 12 year old).  The only option I decided not to use was green olives because I don't like them.  Everything else is as listed in the recipe.

LOVED THIS! i had sooo many left over grape tomatoes from a veggie platter i took to all recipes. did make a few adjustments after reading some reviews. first i cut the tomatoes in half and let them soak on some paper towels. im not a huge tomato person so i wanted a lot of the seeds and juice out. i used green and kalamata olives and white onion. i used half the amount of oil and since many used balsamic vinegar i did one tbp each red wine and balsamic. i cut out the sugar and added a pinch of garlic salt instead of reg salt. i let it marinade a few hours and then added sunflower seeds (was all i had) it was so yummy i was surprised. i was trying to eat healthy but next time i will add some feta or mozzarella. yum yum yum!

A delicious and attractive salad. I only had black olives (no green ones), but added some capers instead.

This is just unusual enough that I thought we'd love it, my husband liked it, but I can't say I did.  I re-named it "olive salsa" after tasing it :-) Hard to think of this as a salad.  I did mix the dressing well and reduce the amount of it which helped (great advice).  Really really salty (all those olives!) and the pine nuts were pretty much lost.  I get pine nuts at Sam's club in a big bag for a great price, so I didn't mind that very much, but if you are paying full price at the grocery store I wouldn't waste them in this recipe - instead toast them and serve them separately or sprinkled on top right before serving so you will get the great full pignoli flavor.  Tought this was a good way to use the many cherry tomatoes I'm harvesting now (winter season in Florida is in full swing) but I'll keep looking for a healthier way to use them.

I thought this was good but did reduce the oil by half. Next time I may use Italian seasoning instead of just oregano for a bit more complex flavor.

Love this...and I'm not even a huge fan of black olives, but I love them in this recipe.  I added  some little yellow tomatoes for even more color.  So pretty!  This is a keeper!!

This was a crowd favorite! Cut sugar in half and added feta cheese and fresh olives rather then canned. I served it in Parmesan cheese crisp bowls that I made.

Awesome!  I took the reviewers advice and cut the olive oil in half and I think it was perfect that way!  The pine nuts really tie the whole thing together.  I also added calamata olives with the black and green...just an extra color/flavor.

I made this salad this morning for tonights dinner. The only thing was, I didn't have any green onions and my neighborhhod store was out also, darn. I did reduce the amount of oil to 1/4 cup as others recommended and even without the green onions this salad is very good after only a couple of hours of marinating. I then added 2 cloves of minced garlic, about 1/3 cup of crumbled feta cheese and a talespoon of minced fresh basil, as some other reviewers said they had. OMG! I'll definitely be making this often. Thank you Keren! Can hardly wait for dinner.

This was good but next time I will definitely cut down on the oil since I thought there was a bit too much.  Love the flavor combination - yummy as bruschetta topping.

I liked this, but I took it to a party and barely any of it was eaten.  I followed the recipe, except it took probably twice the tomatoes than what the recipe stated.  This would also be good if you added pasta to make a pasta salad.

Wonderful!  Took it to church & everyone raved about it & asked for the recipe. I left out the pine nuts (didn't know where to get them).  I added a yellow pepper & marinated it overnight.  Next time will add cauliflower.

Way too much dressing, and I will use fresh basil in it instead of oregano. If fresh basil isn't available, the dried works. Basil and tomatoes are natural partners.

This is a fantastic recipe to add to any entertaining menu.   I made it for a company Christmas party and received great reviews on it.  Those worried about the recipe having too much oil, if you make it the day ahead of time and let in marinate in the fridge it soaks up the additional oil.   If you are only allowing the salad to marinade for a couple of hours I will cut the oil in half.

This a very refreshingly different and delicious recipe.  Like other reviewers, I cut the olive oil in half and doubled the red wine vinegar. I made it about 8 hours ahead of time and kept it in the refrigerator.  The flavors blended nicely by the time dinner was served. This will become a regular in my house.

A nice refreshing way to use up my cherry tomatoes from my garden. My dinner guests loved it! I didn't have pine nuts and decided not to try a substitution, so I just left that out, but it was still very good. Next time I might half the recipe because I rarely have that many cherry tomatoes at once, and if you have leftovers, it doesn't keep very well. Great recipe though!

Very refreshing salad.  I'm not a big fan of green olives but I loved them in this.  Great way to use up the tons of cherry tomatoes in our garden.  I only used half of the oil the recipe called for and thought it was perfect.  Thanks!

This is awesome as a side dish and tastes even better the longer it sits.  I am not a huge green olive fan, so I used all black olives instead.  Delicious!

I loved this recipe although I made a few changes.  I used all black olives as I don't care for green olives.  I also like it best at room temperature but my family likes it chilled.

This is such a great starter, everyone has loved it  even the picky eaters!  I have started making it the morning or night before so the flavors have a chance to mix.

This is a great, easy, beautiful salad!!  I loved it- everything was easy to follow.  I did add a little crumbled feta cheese to it, which turned out great.  The hardest thing was finding unstuffed green olives at the grocery store. I took it to a party, received rave reviews and will definitely make it again!

OMG, this recipe is fabulous and I don't even like tomatoes. My husband had a half full container of tomatoes that we needed to use up so I found this and tried it since I do love olives. Used a yellow onion since I had one and omitted pine nuts since I didn't have any. Otherwise, followed recipe to a T and we both loved it. I even had seconds, which amazed him. Thanks for sharing!!!

I will definitely make this again but with less olive oil.  I used balsamic vingerette instead of red wine vinegar and doubled it to remove the oily taste.

This really caught my family's attention.  I have sent the recipe to two members who requested it.  I did add about half a cucumber cubed.  I also added a little parsley that I needed to use.  The pine nuts add a lot to the texture.

Unusually and very good. Didn’t use canned olives, but bought from the olive bar at sprouts.  I halved the amount of olive oil and it was still fairly oily.  Will do the same next time but save half of the dressing to pour on individually if desired. Really excellent flavors.

Will make it again. At given 1/2 c. oil, a bit too much oil. Reduce by half. The chilling can congeal the dressing, so take care.

I always have an over abundance of cherry tomatoes every year. I've made this twice lately and silly me, didn't read the reviews the first time. At that time I added two more tablespoons of red wine vinegar because I agree it was too oily. 
This second time I made it I changed it up. Instead of olives (my husband doesn't care for them) I added chunks of red onion. I also used fresh oregano (2 large sprigs, no stem), chunks of red bell peppers (another over abundance!) and small broccoli florets. The broccoli was THE perfect veg to soak up all that extra dressing this makes! I also added more pine nuts than called for because I really liked how they tasted in this. 
Next time I plan to add leftover quinoa or orzo instead of pine nuts since they are so darn costly.

I really didn't want to rate this as I have made multiple changes and agree with others that express their dislike for that type of thing, but since I can't seem to find a place to make notes on the recipes I have tried, I have to write a review.  I have a love/hate relationship with this website.  Love the recipes....not so much the newly revised website.
Enough complaining - here are my changes:
*I used salted sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts - cheaper and easier - no toasting necessary. May go with unsalted next time as there is plenty of salt in the olives.  I did not add additonal salt either, and used Herbes de Provence.
*I also added cooked bow tie pasta to create a more filing meal.  Will consider adding chicken at some point as well.  Will likely add cucumber and/or parboiled asparagus.
*Used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar just because I prefer the taste and used just a small amount of olive oil.
That was pretty much all of the changes so far - really love this recipe and will make again and again.

It looks great but I have a question and didn't see any other way to ask.  The picture seems to show ingredients that are not listed.  Please correct ME if I'm wrong.   Large whitish green chunks - could this be cucumber?   Dark burgundy  - could these be  kidney beans.  Please advise.

This may be the best salad I've ever made.. I used a variety of cherry tomatoes for color,  half english cucumber (seeded) rough chopped, my favorite salad dressing recipe. Refridgerated mixture using half the tomatoes overnight.. about an hour before serving, drained off some of the juice, added a bit more dressing, the remainder of the tomatoes and the freshly chopped cucumber.. It was fresh and had an excellent taste.. toasted pine nuts held up well.. next time I may add roughly chopped sweet onion..

It was delicious. At first I was concerned that it wouldn't have enough seasoning, but the simple ingredients really just accented the freshness of the vegetables.  I used red onion instead of green onion, walnuts instead of pine nuts, and I added some diced mozzarella.

I absolutely loved this salad! I do love olives and really it is a good combination of ingredients. Since I only prepared this recipe for 2, I used a lot less ingredients than called however I think next time I would add a little extra oregano to boost the flavor. I could not get regular black olives so I used what was available. In this case, it was the nicoise variety that I used and honestly this was so good! It reminded me of tapenade. My husband did not eat the olives so I ended up getting a piece of french bread and dipping it in the sauce and pouring the olives over the bread...YUM! Will make this again even if it is only for myself!!!

My family enjoyed this salad immensely. I followed the recipe and loved its simplicity. All of the flavors melded together superbly. ONE NOTE: Why didn't someone mention how EXPENSIVE pine nuts are?? lol Nonetheless, I've already made plans to prepare again.

Changed to half the oil per other recommendations.  Lots of olives for the amt of tomatoes so I added more tomatoes to make more balanced. It was tasty and a nice change.  Leftovers the next day were a bit slimy looking but it still tasted good.

This was great. I did  not have pine nuts or some of the vegetables, so I used what I had on hand: tomatoes, a red onion and carrots and it worked. My onion was too strong and it would have been better with the green onion as indicated in the original recipe or maybe a sweet Vidalia but it was still delicious and a good way to use up vegetables. The oregano adds so much flavor to the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This is Fabulous! Make and refrigerate overnight. Use
sunflower kernels as suggested. I used plenty of bacon- even some "bacon bits" I had- the more the
better. A great salad.

Love this quick and delicious and nutritious salad.  I was looking for a way to use all of the cherry tomatoes that we were gathering from our garden.  This was a great hit with the whole family.

This has been one of my go to recipes since 2009.  I've printed it and put it into my recipe binder as well!  But goes great as a topping as well of a leafy green salad if you feel you want something tomato based.

Very easy fast and delicious!

I made this salad for a dinner party last night.  Got rave reviews and empty plates!  Served it at room temperature and guests used baguette slices to mop up the delicious vinaigrette.  A winner.

I used spiced rice wine vinegar and a squeeze of lemon juice with about half the olive oil recommended.
Also used diced red onion, a shake of lemon pepper AND ONE DROP OF SPLENDEX INSTEAD OF SUGAR.
I LOVE THIS!!!!!

Good use of seasonal tomatoes.  I used red, orange & yellow cherry tomatoes so it was very colorful.  As suggested by others, I used much less oil and much more vinegar.  Also added some basil.

FABULOUS!  The pine nuts are imperative and really make the salad.  I had to sub balsamic for red wine vinegar because that's all I had, but will try the red wine next time.  Also, I will definitely reduce the oil considerably as suggested and maybe add the feta on top just to try it out.  Very good though!

Yes, it's salty but you can't stop eating it!  I didn't have cherry tomatoes so used about six regular ones that I diced, which may have accounted for the salad becoming very wet.  I also used Newman's Own Lite Balsamic vinegar instead of the oil, etc., and just a tablespoon or so will do so don't start pouring it on.  This would be great with chopped lettuce as a chop-chop salad or with a nice piece of crusty bread.  I made the bleu cheese burger recipe and served this as a side dish.  If I would have thought ahead and drained it a bit more I would have used it as the condiment for the burgers.  Will definitely make again (boyfriend loved it!).

Found this recipe on this site years ago and it's one of my favorites!  Perfect when bringing something to a potluck because you can make it ahead and don't need to worry about keeping it cold at the party.  I don't add the pine nuts until I'm ready to serve and I always add cucumber.

I love the main ingredients of this salad, just not in this recipe. I cut the recipe in half (just me and the hubby), used a couple tablespoons of the dressing (which I used balsamic), and left out the onions. I was quite disappointing, because the recipe sounded so good. Next time I will try more variations suggested from other reviews and possibly leave out the pine nuts, as I did not like the flavor they brought to this dish. Even after sitting in the frigde for 12 hours, I'm still not crazy about this dish. I will not make this again.

This is gorgeous and delicious.  I used Kalmata olives, green stuffed pimento olives (because that is what I had).  I reduced the oil to 1/4 cup and added two tbsp of lemon juice to give it more kick and round out the flavors. I haven't tried it with feta cheese, but that sounds awesome too.

Really, really good, and easy to make. When toasting the pine nuts, I threw in some sesame seeds and toasted those too. My coworkers enjoyed it and several requested the recipe. I'll be making this one again, thank you.

I absolutely loved this. I did cut down on the oil a bit. But it was great!

I made this last night and it was so easy and the flavor is wonderful.  I omitted the green olives and served it over lettuce - husband loved it, too!

This recipe was very easy to do and thoroughly enjoyable, i changed it slightly as I roughly chopped the green onions instead of mincing them, very popular on a family buffet.
