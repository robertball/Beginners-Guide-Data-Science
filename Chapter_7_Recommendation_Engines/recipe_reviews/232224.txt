Wow...this was FANTASTIC! Te only thing I did differently was to add some sundried tomatoes on top of the goat cheese before I folded the breast closed. If you added mushrooms, I think it would be an easy copycat of Carrabbas stuffed chicken breast

My family loves this recipe! I do make some changes. I add mushrooms(rough chopped about 4 ounces fresh button), garlic (about 1 clover per breast) and sundried tomatoes (about 1 tablespoon for 3 breasts) to it. I also add a tablespoon of honey to the balsamic vinegar as it reduces. Sprinkle fresh parsley on top. I serve it with roasted vegetables and mashed potatoes for a meal that even my extremely picky daughter loves.

Two things about this recipe:  you need to love balsamic and goat cheese because they dominate equally.  I reduced the balsamic to a sweet syrupy consistency which was decadently rich.  My chicken breast was HUMONGOUS, so I pounded it out a little, spread the goat cheese on it, drizzled some balsamic, and then rolled the chicken breast which made for a really nice presentation when sliced.  I think the goat cheese filling was longing for some other ingredients, so I will try that the next time.  Sauteed some mushrooms and topped the chicken breasts when serving.  We liked this, but I think it needs a little tweaking (but not much) to reach 5 stars.

Great flavor and easy to make.  But if you don't like balsamic vinegar, don't bother.

This was a really good recipe!  I made it exactly except for the shallots (used an onion instead) and it was delicious.  I have to say if the vinegar flavor is too strong you are probably not reducing it slowly enough or long enough.  It does have a great flavor.

Wow, this was so fast and so good. I pounded out the chicken breasts and spread on the goat cheese. Used finely chopped onions and a couple of tablespoons of honey in the balsamic reduction. Used 1/2 cup of balsamic and did not reduce it too far, kept it thin and brushed it on the inside of the breast over the goat cheese. Rolled it up and skewered it, dusted the outside of the breast with seasoning salt. 22 minutes at 350 in a convection oven.

I used onions instead of shallots, added mushrooms to the stuffing mixture, and seasoned the chicken with garlic salt and Italian seasoning!!! Turned out great!

Impressive for company. VERY tasty. I think thighs work better than breasts because you don't have to slice them thinner. I sauted mushrooms & onions separately, then added to the balsamic later, but maybe you wouldn't have to do those separately. I added sundried tomatoes to the cheese.  More time intensive prep than indicated

Enjoyed this recipe immensely, but I did lighten up the balsamic glaze.  I used a pre-purchased one, and lightly sprinkled it on the inside and outside of the chicken, so it wasn't overpowering.  More would have been better, but not everyone in my home enjoys balsamic vinegar.  I also used goat cheese with wild blueberries.  Topped it with cranberry sauce when I served it, and it was delicious.

30 minutes in the oven turned them to leather. Needed like 20 minutes tops. I also found the balsamic reduction to be a bit overpowering.

Delicious, and so easy! I didn't split the chicken breasts... just piled the ingredients on top. Used a premade balsamic glaze.

AMAZING!!!! So good and easy. Per suggestions the first time I made I did use sun-dried tomatoes on top of the cheese. It is not necessary.  Love this dish.

I used chicken thighs and sheep feta instead. They came out perfectly. I paired them with balsamic vinegar butter veggie mix and baguette. A yummy and easy to make dinner. My guests absolutely loved it! Will definitely make this again.

I agree with several reviews that this has a tad bit too much Balsamic vinegar taste.  The Balsamic over powers the flavors.  I added some chicken stock to cut this flavor down which helped.  Reducing the Balsamic did not remove the overpowering flavor.  Adding plenty of Goat cheese helps too.

I think my chicken breasts were too thick. There wasn't enough filling for the thickness of the breasts.  The taste of the reduction was good but I think next time I'll add some of the add ons  other's have added like the sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms. It was a little lack luster for me when I followed it to the T.

I did not like the sour cheese in the chicken with the balsamic reduction.   My husband loved the balsamic glaze. (I added about 1 oz real maple syrup to cut the bitterness) 
I will not make it again, but I did like how quick and fancy it was!!

My husband says it's the best chicken dish he ever ate! Like other reviewers, I added in a little honey to the balsamic, added sun dried tomatoes, and used shitaki mushrooms for more flavor. I made mashed potatoes as a side and we both found that putting some of the reduced balsamic on top of the potatoes was heavenly!!!!

Made it with a few adjustments. First added garlic to the olive oil/shallots then layered prosciutto on the butterflied chicken followed with goat cheese, diced sautéed mushrooms and the balsamic mix. Mouthwatering

Delicious!! I have made it like the recipe and it was a hit! I have also made it and added some Italian herbs and garlic to goat cheese filling, as well as some sun dried tomatoes  and baby Bella mushrooms in with the goat cheese and it was AMAZING! Everyone thought it was from a gourmet restaurant! Seems you can play around with the filling with the goat cheese depending on your tastebuds. Definitely a new recipe to impress any crowd. Doesn't hurt that is pretty simple to make too!

Deeeelicious!  I didn't use a whole cup of balsamic but cut it with some red wine I happened to be drinking at the time. I followed someone else's suggesting and added my favorite ingredients that go with goat cheese:  sundried tomatoes and fresh Thai basil.  We both wanted another piece, so I'll have to make it again real soon!

Made this tonight with homemade goat cheese.  It was good but not great. Maybe some additional seasoning would have helped or a little more goat cheese.  I also think that next time I may do a quick sauté of the chicken to brown it a little before putting in the oven. I’ll try this again but with a few tweaks. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe for dinner and my family loved it. I cooked three chicken breasts instead of two and increased the goat cheese to 3 oz. (1 oz) per breast. I made the sauce as per the recipe but added mushrooms which I cooked with the onions. I also added about two tablespoons of honey to cut the bitterness of the balsamic vinegar. My husband isn't a  huge fan of chicken but gave it high marks for chicken. However, my father in law over ruled him and gave it an A+.

Like others, I added sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms.  Followed all other steps in this recipe and it has become one of our favorites!

Nice recipe, just a couple of changes next time: 1. Add sundried tomatoes as some have recommended; 2. Salt & pepper the chicken; 3.  Add a little of butter on the top. About the time, I did 23 minutes and I was great like that.

Exceptionally easy.  Don't worry about the measurements; they are flexible.  And be sure to reduce the balsamic enough.

Will definitely make this again. I mixed very finely chopped mushrooms  (quickly in the  blender) in the balsamic sauce with a bit of garlic.  This recipe is fantastic.

I added sundried tomatoes on top of the goat cheese, and it was excellent!  Be sure to use good quality balsamic and reduce it well.  I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because the cooking time is way off.  My breasts were done after 20 minutes.

These easy chicken breasts were very tasty. Other types of cheese work well too with the balsamic reduction flavors.

I loved this recipe!  My family and I really enjoy balsamic flavor, so the goat cheese balanced the balsamic.  It was a nice twist to the ususal chicken breast dinner.

Unfortunately, I found this to be saturated by balsamic flavor!
