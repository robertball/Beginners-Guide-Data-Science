This turned out to be a much tastier dish than I anticipated. The simple modifications I made put this over the top. I used a heaping 1/3 cup of salsa in place of the tomato sauce, added about 1 tsp or so of cumin, and salt to taste. I also used chicken stock in preparing the rice.

This is, bar none, the best recipe I have received from this site so far. It may be the best recipe I have ever tried. The only changes I made were to omit the onions (my husband doesn't like onions), use a couple tablespoons of olive oil instead of cooking spray, and then it was so absolutely fantastically delicious (and I rarely rave about food) that I ate it without the cheese.  I recommend increasing the portions. Thank you.

To preface my review, my star rating may not be accurate specifically to the recipe itself, because this is a great, tasty, basic recipe, but I took it to the next level to create five star burritos with a Mexican flair. Yummy! As the starting point, I left the original recipe nearly as is, with these minor changes:
1. I only had 1/2 onion on hand and that was plenty.
2. I added one stalk of celery chopped, and sauteed it with the rest of the vegetables.
3. Instead of tomato sauce, I mixed in about 1/4 cup of medium Pace Picante Sauce, for more flavor.
4. I stopped short of adding the cheese at this point.

Next, I cooked some meat for the burritos, simply taking a couple pork chops, cutting them into small, bite-sized pieces and  browning them until thoroughly cooked in 2 T butter, seasoning them with a desired amount of pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and basil, to compliment the veggie mix. You could easily do this as well with a couple chicken breasts or some nice beef.

Finally, to put it all together, I warmed flour tortillas in the microwave, and then filled them with the veggie mix, meat, and cheese, and then punctuated the mix with a desired amount of Tapatio hot sauce for a final spicy touch. (A little sour cream would also have been nice, but we were out of that). Regardless, the result was homemade burrito heaven. This is something I will end up making again and again. Thanks!

I don't particulary care for Rice and Beans and healthy things like that but I've turned 60 (the new 40) and want to be around for another 40 years (like my Dad-still kickin at 96!).  This was outrageous - followed exactly except for using salsa instead of tomato sauce since I had a jar opened.  I skipped the cheese for the 2 of us but if I had company I would definitely serve it.  Thanks submitter!

What a quick easy recipe.  I added canned diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, canned corn, and used minute rice.  The whole family liked it and the time from prep to table was snappy.

This is a yummy and simple vegetarian side dish or supper. However, I do find that it is a little bland, so I usually add a tiny bit of cumin and some chopped jalapeno to add some more flavor.

With pre-cooked rice, this was a snap to put together at the last minute.  I added about a cup of frozen corn, used ketchup instead of opening a can for the small amount of tomato sauce, and added some cumin for extra spice.

This recipe was really tasty! I tweaked with it a little, as I didn't have green pepper, just red, and I added some extra heat with red pepper flakes, but in general, this was delicious!

This was yummy.  I didn't have black beans so I used black eyed peas instead.  I also added a bit of cumin and coriander while it was cooking.  I also didn't want to open a can of tomato sauce for 1 tbs so I used a tbs of salsa.  I will be making this again.

Very good for a quick meal, although needs a bit more spice. It was a little bland.

Easy, Healthy and Good! Thanks for such a good recipe. I only changed a few things because of what I had on hand - used salsa instead of tomato sauce and used yellow and red peppers instead of green and red.  I thru in a bit of cumin too since we were having a southwest dinner. And served without the cheese.

My husband really liked this, as did I, but I agree with other reviewers that it needs a little more kick.  Next time I will add some salsa or hot sauce to spice it up.

I made this as a side dish for tacos, and since it was so tasty, ended up using it as a filling for my tacos too!  It was really good.  I used roasted garlic tomato sauce and it ended up needing a little more juice so i threw in about a fourth cup of salsa too.  I also added about 1/2 cup frozen corn, a teaspoon of cumin, and a little salt. I mixed the leftovers with my leftover taco meat and I'm excited to eat it for lunch today!

I used this as a base recipe, in a crockpot I put 2 can's black beans, half a chopped onion, leftover corn salsa, cumin and minced garlic. Cooked it on low for about 2 1/2 hrs. Yum! Delicious. I served with yellow rice.

Worked well with brown rice.  Used reviewers' advice & added cumin, salsa, and cayenne -- also added some corn which gave it a great look.

Delicious.  I added 1 tablespoon of Tabasco and 1 teaspoon of chili powder instead of the peppers (I did not have peppers on hand).  This gave it plenty of kick.  I also substituted brown for white rice.  This was very good tasting BNR.

Was good. I added canned corn and switched tomato sauce for salsa.  I liked it and will make it again but it is a bit bland so next time around I'll add more salsa. (5 Stars for how simple it is to make)

Great dish prepared as written. Makes a good base for many dishes as described in several reviews. Besides being delicious, it's WW friendly. I substituted smoked turkey sausage  for the cheese. I'd like to add to others that have rated or may rate this in the future to try the dish as written. It is unfair to change someone's recipe and then say you don't like it.

Instead of doing that all that work chopping and making sofrito try out this really delicious sofrito I found on the web.    You can substitute 1 - 12 oz jar of their All-Purpose Sauteed Seasoning in place of the  onion, peppers, garlic, basil, black pepper, tomato sauce, and red wine vinegar.  It is really good stuff. We’ve been using it to make chicken and rice (Arroz con Pollo), red beans and ham (Frijoles Colorados), Paella, Picadillo (Cuban sloppy joes), braised short ribs in wine, tamal en cazuela (Cuban Polenta with Pork) and others.

This was really good and my husband and 2 year old daughter enjoyed it...I added more garlic, some cumin and some smoked sausage to make it a more complete meal.  Will definitely be making it again.

I used this recipe as a guideline, and just kind of threw in what i had on hand. I used pinto beans because i was out of black beans, and i used salsa in place of the tomato sauce. I didn't have any red wine vinegar so i omitted that. This was DELICIOUS! It was so easy too. Thanks for the great ideas!

My husnand was unsure about this dish but after he took one bite he couldn't sstop raving about it. I did as others had suggested and used salsa instead of tomato sauce. I also added hot sauce (3-4 shakes) and some fresh cilantro (about 2 tbsp).

This was a very tasty and quick recipe. Like others, I subbed salsa (chunky,medium heat) for tomato sauce. I only had red and yellow peppers,u sed fresh basil (all I had) and skipped the vinegar(didn't have). But, it was spicy enough and very satisfying! Thank you!

This was pretty tasty, and so easy to put together. Great for a fast meal. Even my Husband liked it and he's a meat and potatoes person. I did make some of the changes I read in the reviews, but  for the most part, stuck with the original recipe. Wonderful for people trying to cut back on their meat intake. Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent I thought. I added 1/2 pound of Tennessee pride sausage, a little curry powder and cayenne red pepper to the mixture, 3/4 can of tomato sauce. Left out the vinegar and cheddar cheese. then cooked until it was a little dry. My son and I loved it.

Wow!  I was amazed at how good this was.  I've been eating black beans & rice for years, but I think the wine vinegar & tomato sauce really gave it a different taste.  I LOVE this recipe!

Wonderful! I made a few changes but I know it would have been excellent as written. I sauteed the onion, peppers and garlic in a little olive oil. I added cumin, cayenne and garlic powder with the other seasonings. Instead of tomato sauce I used a can of Rotel tomatoes. The cayenne and Rotel made it quite spicy but my bf loves really spicy food. Finally I used saffron rice instead of white rice which made it very colorful. It was a huge hit! I served it with Fish Tacos. I think it would be delicious as a main dish with some grilled chicken breast added. Thumbs up for a great recipe!

This was pretty good.  Just make sure you use a sturdy rice such as basmati.  I used jasmine and it ended up very "mushy"

this is one of my husband's most favorite recipes now, and it's so cheap to make that it's a great, easy-to-please recipe! We usually add a lb of ground turkey breast or lean ground beef, and leave out the cheese. Great recipe!!

I really liked this.  We needed something vegetarian that no one would fuss about. One kid liked it better in a tortilla, another liked it wrapped in a romaine lettuce leaf.

I've never made black beans and rice before but wanted to try it.  This recipe was great, I read the other reviews and substitued my homemade salsa for the tomato sauce, and added cumin.  Yum, will make again!

Good but a bit bland. Added garlic powder and cayenne pepper to taste. Deleted green peppers (husband doesn't like them). Instead of tomato sauce used tomato paste mixed with the vinegar. Added more vinegar for more flavor. Used Quinoa instead of rice. Yummy! Will make again but use more spices.

I've made this recipe twice and each time I've been pleased with the results. My daughter is NOT a pepper-lover, so we compromised with one red pepper, a deal that  was kid-friendly and was tasty for me and my husband. We added lime and cilantro, too.

I have a two year old and wanted to make this a complete meal.  I skipped the peppers and added frozen corn and spinach and replaced the red wine vinegar with balsamic.  I used brown rice and extra cheese and rolled it into burrito's. Kids and burrito lovers loved the meal.

Huge hit in my house.  I used what I had on hand, celery instead of green pepper and 1/2 cup of a salsa instead of tomato sauce and a can of ranch style black beans.  I also added 1 tsp each corriander and cumin when cooking veggies.  When veggies were done I threw in some left over sausage I had, to heat through, then added the beans and rice.  I cut the vinegar in half since I used salsa.  My family loved it!  Without the  sausage it fits into WW with only 5 points!

Delish... my 9 and 2 y.o. gobbled it up. I added 1/3 salsa instead of tomato sauce. I didnt use garlic or red wine vinegar b/c i didnt have any. I will make again. My son topped it with salsa and we ate it with corn tortilla chips but i bet it would taste good rolled in a tortilla too.

This was okay...I felt that it as bland in flavors.  I sub salsa for tomato sauce and also added a chopped jalapeno, but it still was pretty bland in flavor....i was expecting more.

Made this tonight for the family and they loved it. I took the suggestions of others and added 1 tsp of cumin, subbed the onion, peppers and tomato sauce for chunky salsa and used whole grain rice instead of long grain rice. I tasted this as I cooked and added additional  ground pepper, red pepper and salt to taste. Really great dish this way.

Hmmm, I'm not sure why this was ever given a high rating. I doubled it and served it at a party and nobody took more than a bite or two and nobody wanted seconds. I had almost the entire pan left over after the party. Was not a big hit! It wasn't bad, just not good.

Actually if I could I would rate this a 3 1/2.  This was good, but not great!  I made this exactly as above.  The whole family found it a little dry and a little bland, but for the most part liked it and ate it. I would make again, but try to alter it in some way to jazz it up a bit.

It was too dry for me, and there was more spicy heat than layers of flavor.  Will not make this again.

This wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either. I think it could be ok, but needs work to get there. The whole family thought it was dry and needed... something. I was a little disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews.

This is really yummy!  I have made this twice now, definately add a nice amount of cumin.  Also, if you like to kick it up a notch, sprinkle on the hot sauce once its on your plate.  That takes the dish to a whole new level!  
I fixed with tortillas the first time and the second time without.  I think I like it better without and I  made some asparagus with garlic and onion to go on the side.

This was pretty good, which surprised me.  My 10 year old loves to eat beans and rice, which I think is bo-ring, but I took the advice of others and added cumin, salt  and salsa, and this dish was satisfying for the whole family!

This dish is my favorite! I pair it with some blackened chicken or southwest chicken and it's a phenomenal combo. I add more than 1/4 cup of cheese. Probably about 1/2 cup bc i like cheese and also the suggestion of cooking the rice in the chicken stock makes a world of difference. It's not the same dish if you don't cook the rice in the broth. A family favorite!

I took the advice of others and added a dash of cumin to this dish, which worked quite well. It's a hearty side dish that could easily, with increased portions, be used as a main course. The cheese is optional, but certainly adds to the display value when used.

5 stars for being easy, using fresh veggies, and good taste. After tasting we added a little garlic and cumin because maybe we like things a little spicier than most. Also used one cube of veggie boullion in the rice. But it was truly good "as is" and worth your time to try.

This recipe was really good. I didn't have a green bell pepper but other than that, I followed it exactly. Served it as a one-dish dinner for my DH and me! Yummy! I could see how the salsa instead of the tomato sauce would give it a needed kick. Thanks for the recipe!

it was AWESOME. didnt have any red bell pepper, but still came out wonderful. Hubby is picky about onions so I was nervous because you put a whole onion in there - but after it cooks down, you cant even hardly tell its there. Mixed some cheese in with it, then sprinkled a bit more on top. I served with Mexican Baked Fish from this site. YUMM! Too bad we are out of Margarita mix!

This is good stuff and really easy to make.  I didn't want to open a can of tomato sauce just for one tablespoon, so I added salsa instead.  I really like the little kick it gave, I think I will always make it this way.

This is very good and very easy to throw together.  Like others, I substituted cumin for tomato sauce.  I also added cilantro and Crystal hot sauce (just a splash).  Hmm-hmm.

Very tasty, very easy to make.  I omitted the onions because I'm not a fan.  I tasted it before serving, and it was a bit bland, so I kicked it up with a bit of red pepper and chili powder which complimented my Mexican main dish perfectly.  Will be making this again!

I think this is a very good base but needs additional seasoning. I didn't really know what seasonings to add but it was definitely lacking something. If you are adept at cooking with these kinds of spices you should do fine by adding what is needed. Will try this again, it is a keeper.

This was sooo good and  very simple!  The only changes I made were I used some diced tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce and I used apple cider vinegar, it was all I had on hand.  This had amazing flavor, definitely a keeper!

We really enjoyed this last night.  The only change I made was to use a splash of Zing-Zang (Bloody Mary mix)in place of the tomato sauce because I didn't want to open a can to use one tablespoon.  Also drained but did not rinse the beans.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks.

Yummy! I didn't have any rice cooked, so I put the rice and water in the pan together and cooked it with the rest of the ingredients. It turned out fine.

This was excellent!  The flavors were great together.  I think the serving size needs to be increased.  I could have eaten the whole recipe myself.  We loved it!!!

Awesome. I used half an onion, half a red pepper and half a green pepper. I also used basmati rice. It was quick and delicious. I may have used a bit more cheese..

Very Good recipe.  I used boil in a bag brown rice and some freshly cooked black beans I was using for soup.
