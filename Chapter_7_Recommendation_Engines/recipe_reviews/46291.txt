I have twice used this recipe as the bread component for Eggs Benedict, and both times I went without the smoked Gouda--didn't have it on hand. I doubled the herbs as well, to thinking that this would make up for the loss of the cheese flavor. The second time I used a Belgian waffle-maker, and that really made the recipe. They were crunchy and flavorful, and they'll be a permanent component of my Eggs Benedict from now on! I really recommend that you try these that way.

My family loves these waffles.  The first time I made them, I made a creamed ham to go on them.  They were fabulous.  The next time, I used cheddar instead of the gouda.  I made an Italian sausage and mushroom sauce and they were once again great.

We tried these waffles last night and they were quite enjoyable.  They took us much longer than 15min. prep that is suggested but were worth the extra effort.  Our gouda was not a really strong gouda and the flavor didn't come out too much.  Next time we will try another flavor of cheese. oh-and you really need to oil the waffle iron--our first waffle had to be scraped out!  Once we started oiling liberally, they turned out perfectly.

I am sorry to say that we really did not care for the waffles.  I made them to go along with  spicey fried chicken and was very disappointed.

These are my new obsession.  I ate them with chicken salad and then with beef stew.  I do have a non-stick waffle iron and it does need lightly greased when I make these, so follow the directions that say lightly grease.  I made the whole batch and froze the waffles.  Just as yummy after thawing and putting in the toaster.

I made these with scrambled eggs and they were really good. Next time, I'll try them with an actual creamed dish. And to the person who made them with spicy chicken--did you read the description?

I really, really love these. I made them as written minus the tarragon and served them with some lobster newburg over the top. A great change of pace and utterly delicious. They are great plain as a substitute for boring dinner rolls and biscuits. I will make these weekly with different herbs and cheeses. Definitely do grease the waffle iron!

Great recipe!  I used whole wheat flour and sharp cheddar cheese.  We'll be making these again!

A nice change for dinner.  Made cream chipped turkey with mushrooms, green garlic, & onions to top them.  Substituted 1 cup oat flour for 1 cup wheat flour.  They were exceptionally light.  Next time we might try making them without whipping the eggs or increasing the oat flour to increase the density. Perhaps doubling the seasonings could make them a more flavorful stand alone entree.

They were delicious!  The only change we made was using cheddar cheese instead of Gouda.  We served them with chicken and gravy.  We will definitely make these again.

This is a great idea! I switch up the cheese/spice blend depending on what I'm serving with them, but the savory waffles are so good that it's worth hauling the waffle iron out for! Thanks for sharing!

I made this to go with tomato soup last night. It was delicious! In my opinion, adding cheese to bread batter is never really worth it because the flavor a aren't strong enough, so I omitted the Gouda, reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and added an extra 1/2 tsp of garlic salt and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. I also cooked them for 1 min longer than my waffle iron recommends for recipes. They came out light, fluffy, crispy and delicious!! I froze the leftovers and toasted to reheat for breakfast, which worked very well.

Unique waffle. I served it with chicken nuggets and will try again with creamed chicken.

Thank you very much for this recipe.  I served under chicken diablo which I'll share soon.  The dish is quite hot so it didn't allow the fine flavors in the waffles to shine through.  This really makes a nice change out for starches in the meal. You are correct about how these smell wonderful while cooking!

Let me add that I think that with the amount of fats in the recipe, it is better served with tomatoe or sweet pepper based sauces to help cut the fats.
