I tried to make this recipe but the quantity of buttermilk it asks for cannot be right.

I rarely ever rate a recipe this low but this is far from anything like Irish Soda bread.   It is much too rich and the liquid ingredients are wrong - at least that is how I feel.  Of course I was weaned on the stuff so tend to be critical!!   There are much better recipes on this site.

Milk and sour cream are not an option.  Without that extra moisture, it would be too dry.  We loved the taste and texture. We will be making this again!

I think the recipe should be 1/4 cup of buttermilk.  I looked at a few others and that looked about right.  Anyway, it turned out pretty good.  I added raisins and fennel because I used to know someone that made it that way and it was always a big hit.

If I could gave 10 stars, I would!  This was awesome!  I halved the recipe in case I didn't like it --- now I wish I would have made both loaves!  The only changes I made was that I added an extra tablespoon of butter because my mixture wasn't "crumbly" enough.  I added the sourcream (with a little extra) and instead of the milk, just added some extra buttermilk.  It was fantastic....people were asking for the recipe left and right.  I put about 3/4 cup of raisins and about 1/2 cup of cranberries.  What can I say -- it was better than dessert and I only like chocolate for dessert!  WOW!!!

I made this according to the recipe and it turned out wonderful.  It was light and moist with lots of flavor.  I didn't have caraway seeds, but will definately get some for the next time I make this. For those who thought the buttermilk amount was incorrect, if your buttermilk is fresh and you used baking soda and baking powder, you should not have had any problems.  Sometimes if the butter milk is old it gets thin.

I love using raisins (light and dark), walnuts, and dried cranberries in this recipe.  I highly recommend it.

This recipe cannot be correct.  I measured precisely and followed directions and it turned out of the oven more like bread pudding!  It was soft and mushy...not like bread at all...with way too many raisins.  Is there a mistake?  A disaster in my book!

I agree that the buttermilk measurement must be wrong. I had to add another 2 cups of flour to get a dough that even resembled bread. It was still too moist. I ended up with something resembling a batter rather than dough. When finished, the texture was close to a banana nut bread. Not bad actually, but not the irish soda bread I was aiming for.

I received two requests for this recipe. I did not have sour cream so I used plain greek yogurt. This was the texture I was looking for as it did not crumble when it was sliced. So delicious!
Next time I will use less buttermilk as I had to add more flour to recipe. I did manage to get two round loaves from it though and froze one. Many thanks.

Being of part Irish, Scots and other other European descent, I remember relatives who made soda bread. Of course, it accompanied other Irish dishes.  It was always a treat! I'm glad to have discovered your site and these recipes. The family will enjoy a greater variety of dishes.  Thanks ever so much from The Big House, J.

I made two loaves of this bread yesterday and thought it was excellent. I did not add the caraway seeds and only used 1/2 cup of sugar. Next time I think I will use more than 3 tablespoons of sour cream. I might even add a little Philadelphia cream cheese, but the basic recipe is excellent in my opinion.

This is excellent. Used a mixture of dried fruit with no caraway seeds. Baked in 4 small loaf pans so I could share with neighbors and family.

Very moist and almost like a dessert. Perfect balance for a salty meal! I made a half batch which made 1 loaf and it came out perfect! I also didn’t add the dried fruit or the seeds. Probably one of the best soda breads I have had.

I made this as directed, but did not add milk or sour cream. the raisins were rehydrated with hot water and drained after about 8 minutes, and added extra moistness to the bread. my wife and I give this 2 thumbs up

I am so glad 1. I have never had Irish soda bread before....and 2. I did NOT read the reviews before making this recipe. I used a little extra buttermilk as I did not use the sour cream and it was GREAT! Don't know if it tastes like "real" soda bread but it was very nice with our corned beef and cabbage dinner! Can't ask for more than that!
