This was just great!  I halved the recipe and used 1 cup of salsa in place of the diced tomoato.  The spices tasted like packaged taco seasoning without all that sodium!  What an excellent and easy alternative!

Three pounds of ground meat for 10 servings seemed quite a lot to me.  I made this for a leaner taco salad, so I scaled down.  Used half a large onion, 1 large garlic clove, 1 tsp oregano, still full Tbs cumin because we love cumin, 1 pound ground turkey with about 2 Tbs lime juice squeezed in while onions were sauteed.  Still used the full can of tomatoes since this was for taco salad.  I also used crushed white corn tortilla chips to thicken the mixture till it reached the consistency I preferred.  This was excellent.  It still made quite a lot for a taco salad.

I used lean ground turkey and it came out great for tacos (and almost fat-free!). The leftovers were delicious in a taco salad.
I didn't have any canned tomatoes, so I used chunky salsa and added 1/2 cup of water.

I have tried a similiar dish but never with the cornmeal nor fresh spices - it made a whole lot of diffrence to the texture and taste of the beef. It was much more moist and delish :) Was well worth it .. yummyyyyyyy :)

I may have used too much meat for spices.  As a result, my husband was not fond of it.

This was very tasty, and didn't take a lot of time or effort to make. Just top the tacos and you've got a meal (okay, more like 2 or 3 meals).

I gave this recipe 5 stars.  The meat has a very good flavor.  I will never buy packaged powder again.  It makes a lot.  I made it for my family and shared it with a friend that had just had a baby.  We still had enough left for lunch the next day!

good stuff! i'm not a fan of the spicey envelopes of salty junk my mom normally uses to make taco meat and i was on the hunt for a replacement. the spices didn't overwealm the rest of the taco and had a super taste!

This was very good and a nice substitute to the taco seasoning packets that have a power punch of sodium.  The only thing I did differently was to use a can of Rotel as I didn't have tomatoes on hand.  BTW - this was better the second day as it gave the flavors a chance to meld.  Goodbye taco packets!  Thanks Pam for a healthier alternative!!!

This was great! I'm trying to incorporate more Ground Turkey in our diets. I did cook this longer since I was using low sodium tomatoes & no salt. I also used regular Chile Powder & Chipoptle Chile Powder. Since we can't eat salt you really have to up the other spices. I let this simmer for several hours before adding the cornmeal. We made tacos & it was great!

I agree with the ratings that said that this was bland.  I was hopeful, so tried it anyway.  I have a bad palate, but I know what I like, and it was just missing "something."  I don't know what!  More salt, maybe?  And something to give it a little more kick.

Perfect! Like another reviewer said, it tastes just like the seasoning packets but without the dreadful amount of sodium. I usually just throw a bunch of seasonings together when I make tacos, but for some reason never thought to add oregano! Great addition. I used a can of mild Rotel instead of the plain diced tomatoes. Also skipped the cornmeal - didn't feel it was necessary. Hubby is a taco addict so he was a happy camper. Thanks!!! :)

I used red onion, venison ground, and doubled the spice amounts. I added a chopped Hungarian Wax pepper and some cayenne to the mix, as well as adding some chopped cilantro at the very end.  I must say that this turned out excellent this way!

I loved it with the ground turkey.  I didn't use the cornmeal but I did thicken it by adding vegetarian black beans and vegeterian refried beans. Flavor was great.  Thanks for sharing.

Not sure about the "Southwest" flare, but I did add a can of the Rotel mix for the tomatoes, added the spices, and kicked it up a notch with a chipotle pepper and sauce. Toppings for the salad included a black bean and corn mixture. Quite easy and tasty.

This was a very quick and nice take on taco-worthy ground turkey.  I used 93/7 turkey, and I drained the tomatoes first.  I didn't use any cornmeal, but I would if I had used beef.  

I also added about a t of paprika and 1/2 t of onion powder to the seasoning mix.  What makes this recipe so great is the time, especially if you let it cool and use it the next day.

Healthy, delicious, versatile, and easy! I scale this down and use 99% fat free ground turkey breast. I have used tomato sauce in place of the diced tomatoes. Salsa would be good too. I also like to use Chipotle Chile Powder instead of regular for some spice. Mixing in some mushrooms is good too. When served on a whole wheat tortilla with a little shredded cheese, this is a wonderful, healthy meal.

I am going to say that I didnt follow the recipe to the T BUT I took your concept & directions on how to cook it & I got to say I was happy with the results. With mine I like spicy so I added jalapinos; I also didnt have chili powder so I used adobo; & last I didnt have a can of dinced tomatoes so I used a can of tomato sauce & chopped up some tomatoes & put in in there. Great recipe.

For a taco mix this was incredibly bland.  Made according to recipe and it just didnt have much flavor.  With a ton of doctoring might be ok but just not worth the trouble.

I used this as my basis. I scaled it down to 4 servings, 1.25 of meat. I added chopped bell pepper with the garlic & spices. I went light on the chili powder to make sure it was not too spicy. I also used tomato paste to thicken instead of the cornmeal.   I could have used more chili powder or even green chiles instead of the bell pepper. Also, be careful scaling as the amount of onion and amount of tomatoes did not scale.

This worked out great for our family's 1st shot @ Taco Salad!  Did as some of the other reviewers, didn't have the cornmeal so used tomato paste instead.  Even my picky 7 yr old said "I love the meat!"

This was really good!  It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, so I added black pepper to taste at the end.  I think an 1/8-1/4 tsp. cayenne would do nicely in this dish.  I added 1/2 green bell pepper diced, and sauteed it with the onions.  I also used about a cup of crushed tomatoes instead of the diced (my husband will eat what he cannot see).
I simmered it for 30-45 minutes because I had time to kill.
Overall an nice base that can be played around with to meet individual needs.

We thought this tasted great, mild, but very good! My husband raved about it and said that he wanted it again sometime. The only change that I made was I added a couple of cans of black beans to bulk this up a bit and to make it last longer. Since there were only three of us eating I made the full amount but froze half of it for a very easy meal in a few weeks. Also, if anyone cares, I used ground turkey since it is healthier. Thanks for sharing this recipe, and we will definitely be having this again!

I only had 2 lbs of ground turkey on hand so used that and eye-balled the ingredients to scale them down to size.  I then took half of the final product and packaged it for freezing because 2 lbs. seemed like way too much for my husband, 2 small children and myself.  OMG.  I wish I would have had 3 lbs of turkey!!  This was FANTASTIC and my husband had no idea that it wasn't red meat!!  We gobbled down the 1 lb. that night.  The next day, my husband and I couldn't stop talking about it so I took out the package from the freezer for dinner 2 nights later!Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It is officially being added to my "favorites" recipe box!!

This was really good. I used ground beef and made them as tacos with crunchy shells, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, jalapenos, sour cream and salsa. Loved it. Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow as taco salad.

Pretty good! My hubby LOVES tacos and routinely "begs" me to make them (more often than I want to lol!). While I enjoyed Pam's preparation, I think I prefer Erica Stewart's microwave tacos a tad better. Having said this, my decision really boils down to whether or not I am making tacos or a taco salad. I think this is much better suited for taco salad, but that's just me. Heck, my my hubs prefers an even simpler approach - fry up a lb. of ground beef, add a packet of taco seasoning and pile into crispy taco shells! I guess there's no one "right" way to eat tacos, so do whatever works for you. :) Served with a side of Mexican rice, frozen strawberry margaritas and all my favorite taco garnishes, this was a decent meal. Thanks for sharing, Ms. Anderson! :-)

This was really good!! We used ground chicken, added some bell pepper, and since we ran low on chili powder we added red pepper flakes ... was so delicious.. it did turn out kinda spicy due to the red pepper flakes but thats okay since we love spicy dishes. We will be making this again for sure! Thanks for the recipe :-)

This was good, easy and I would make it again. I used low-fat turkey and made it into a taco salad. I did add a little red pepper flake for some heat.

This recipe made great tasting taco filling. I followed the recipe but adjusted the cooking method to allow draining off the fat from the beef. This recipe would be way too greasy with the amount of fat even a lean grind produces, so I would really recommend draining it first.  I used a 2 to 1 ratio of beef and turkey. Everyone gave this a thumbs up and I packaged the excess to freeze for future use, which will be a real time saver on those inevitable busy nights.

This was good; however my family voted the recipe called Taco Seasoning 1 is a bigger hit.  If you like tomatoes in your taco meat, this one's a winner!  Bottom line, both recipes are terrific, healthy alternatives to the packaged seasonings!

Unfortunately, husband and I did not care for this. I don't know what it was, but it didn't come out as good as I had thought it would. Maybe it was too grainy...? Anyway, whatever it was, we didn't eat it (though I sure tried to, bec. I hate to waste food). I'll just stick to our basic ground beef mix. Thanks for shring the recipe though! It's always fun to try something new. I'll probably try this again, later, just to see if it comes out the same way. Maybe we'll change our minds. :)

This beef for taco is very lip-smacking.  This is my first time making beef for taco that the entire family truly enjoyed.  Compared to taco seasoning mix are normally used in making beef for taco, this blend of spices  plus the addition of corn meal produced a very scrumptious dish – very creamy and spicy.  I will always use this recipe when making beef for taco.  After reading other reviewers’ comments, I used salsa instead of petite diced can tomatoes.     This recipe deserves a five star rating.    Thanks very much for sharing this unique recipe.

Great recipe except the spice is a bit bland. Next time I will probably just use a taco seasoning packet with meat and add the canned tomatoes.

This is a quick versatile recipe. I used this over chips to make nachos. I didn't want any heat so omitted the chili powder and only had a pound of turkey to use up. Even with using less turkey, it was just what I was wanting.

This was super! I used 1 lb. of ground turkey, 1 cup of salsa and I used 1/2 cup of Masa (used to made corn torillas) for cornmeal. I used the leftovers to make a SW omelet. I used about 3/4 cup for a 3 egg omelet. It was AMAZING!!

This is the best taco recipe I have ever used. Adding cornmeal was the frosting on the cake. My husband and I loved the flavor and how the mixture held together. This is definitely going in my "Recipe Box."

We really liked this recipe. I scaled it back because it was for only the two of us, so three pounds of meat would have been way too much. It was a nice change to our taco rotation. Thanks for sharing!

Throw out those taco seasoning packets that are just loaded with the extra junk!  This is the closest you will get to that, with a lot less sodium and sugar.  Flavor can be easily modified to your liking but great as it is written!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  Have made it several times since!

I have made this several times and I love it.  The only change I made was that I lessoned the chili powder from 3 tablespoons to 1 (I can't handle the heat.) Besides that this recipe is perfect, thank you for the healthy alternative to beef:)

This recipe was sooo good!I didn't change a thing about it and it was just wonderful. My 10 year old son is a picky eater but he had no problem eating this up. I made it for taco night with some homemade guacamole and sour cream on the side and will definitely make this again!

This is fantastic! We are watching our weight and this was a perfect topping for our salad with tons of veggies. I followed the directions to a tee and made "fiesta dressing" from this site to top it off. It was a wonderful, healthy, filling meal. Will make again for sure!!!!

This recipe is serioulsy amazing!!  It is way better than any taco seasoning packet you could buy at a store.  The flavors in the this go perfectly together and taste wonderful.  I made this with ground deer meat and it turned out better than I could have thought.  Sometimes with deer meat, you can still taste the gamey-ness in it, but this disguised it very well!  My husband and I just raved about the taste through our entire meal!!  We made burritos with this meat!!  Bought huge tortillas, shredded mexican cheese, and I made some pico de gallo from a recipe on here, and stuffed it into a burrito with this meat and it was to die for!  Just like going to a mexican restaurant!!  5 stars all the way!

This was okay, but a little bland for me. I cut it down to 1 lb of beef, half a large onion, 2 tsp of minced garlic, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp cumin because we love cumin, 1 and 1/2 cups of fresh tomatoes instead of from the can.

Loved this.  I have made it twice.  Never with cornmeal..I drained the hamburger  and used a can of tomato paste along with the diced tomatoes.  Also used salsa.  Good seasoning!

Made this recipe and loved it even more the next day.  Initially I used this recipe due to my daughter not being able to have preservatives that are in so many premade seasoning mixes.  I will use this recipe for now on.  Forget about the seasoning packets This recipe is better!

DELICIOUS, I will never use taco seasoning again.  It really does not take much more time and it turns out much better.  I have made this taco meat several times.  I never use cornmeal because I don't have it handy.

I will never use packaged taco seasoning again after trying this.  I did use a can of Rotel diced tomato/green chili instead of the plain tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, including the 3 lbs of meat.  We LOVED it.

I was looking for a taco meat seasoning recipe that didn't use the nasty packaged stuff and this definitely filled the bill. Agreed, it could have used more heat, but I made it as-is first on the off chance I could get my 5 year-old to eat it (no luck). Overall, a really nice blend of seasonings; we'll probably just add a little cayenne or jalepeno next time to kick it up for our personal taste.

This recipe has all the right basics, but lacks in flavor.   I used hot chili powder instead of regular, and it still lacked a kick.  However, I love the 3 cloves of garlic.  I added a tablespoon of Tabasco (there's a lot of meat here) and that helped a great deal.  I would also double the cumin and add another teaspoon or oregano.   Also, I don't see a need for the corn meal as I like my taco meat to be loose, not mushy.   I really like using tomatoes instead of water to moisten the meat.

The second time I made it, I left out the corn meal and I decreased the chili powder to 1 TBSP and increased the oregano to 1 TBSP.

I used ground turkey. Absolutely delicious.

and cooking the onions and adding the dry spices
with garlic till fragrant was the secret to this wonderful taste of this dish.  Only used 2 lbs of turkey and used salsa med. and diced tomatoes
without juice .  Flavorful and quick !!

This is a favorite for my family.  I have three kids under 15 and everyone loves this recipe.  I only cook 1 pound of meat at a time but still use all the same amount of spices.  It is perfect!

Good starting point to know which spices I needed to add. However, I used only 2 lbs ground beef (needed to do something with it ASAP!) and ended up doubling the amount of spices in the recipe as I cooked it. I browned the onion slightly before adding the spices and then the beef. I substituted ancho chili powder and some chipotle chili flakes and powder for the regular chili powder (didn't have). I think tomato sauce or paste would have been better than canned tomatoes. I often use recipes as a starting point, and this was helpful in that way. I've noted the adjustments I made and will make it again.

I'm sorry, but this was REALLY bland... I did not cut the recipe down and only used 2lbs of ground beef. Thank goodness I had a taco seasoning packet on hand to save the dish. Sorry, won't be making this one again.

I had to add so much extra seasoning, real tomato bits, and tomato paste(and some water).I was out of chili powder, I learned after starting this,so I added a  Hot taco seas. packet to add flavor. Added more garlic, (1 small diced zucchini to sneak some in) onion, Mexican seasoning, cumin, coriander, salt and pepper.  Used a 3lb. pkg. of Ground turkey, so maybe that was  why it was so bland? Won't make again.

This is a great recipe! I love to make it for tacos or taco salad! Just the right amount of seasonings! I don't use the tomatoes because my family is picky about that but it still turns out delicious.

This is amazing! Similar yet different from the way the powder makes meat taste, but definitely better! Very good!

This is by far the best taco meat recipe I have ever made. I do add an additional tablespoon of cumin, well because you can always use more cumin. Great recipe and a huge, huge hit!

Fantastic, added Worcestershire sauce to it at the end to add a bit of tang otherwise it was a bit flat. Was a hit after adding it!

This is delicious! I used it for a taco salad, and I have some left for the freezer. It will be great for a quick meal, used for burrito filling or chimichangas. The seasonings are perfect, although I had to add quite a bit of salt to taste. Don't be afraid to use the cornmeal as a thickener; it works really well, and it adds a nice taste to the meat. Thanks for the good recipe.

Tasted great!  I used lean ground turkey and fresh tomatoes.  I omitted the cornmeal and used a few tablespoons of tomatoe paste intead.  Added a little hot sauce.  Went well with soft tacos.

3 TABLESPOONS of chili powder is way too much.  It made the meat extremely spicy and almost inedible.  I've got a taste for spicy foods, like wasabi, but this was too much.

this is really good however I do agree that 3lbs is a bit much. I would use 1.5lbs of either ground turkey or ground beef. another thing, you can do without the cornmeal.  tacos are fun and easy, the key is to pre cook the taco shells, then dress the tacos with your fixings, top with cheese and bake again until cheese is melted. top with sour cream-delicious!

Our family is following a low-sodium diet and this recipe was perfect with only 1 adjustment.  Instead of using the cumin, oregano, salt and chili powder - I simply used approximately 4-5 tablespoons of Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime seasoning.  It is sodium free and has all of those spices (plus more) in it. I was also able to find "NO ADDED SALT" diced tomatoes. I also added about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar at the end - it just gave it a different flavor that I liked. I used lean ground turkey.  We will eating this with tacos, salads, wheat egg noodles or brown rice. Would also be nice on a roll as a Sloppy Joe type sandwich or on top of a baked potato.  The possibilities are endless!  This will be added to our regular "rotation" and I would definately recommend this recipe!

I had about a pound of ground beef that I needed to use up so I made a half recipe. I had to substitute: I was out of chili powder so I used equal parts paprika and red pepper flakes and I also diced up fresh tomatoes instead of using canned. My husband, not the biggest taco fan, loved it.  Will definately be making this again instead of the *taco kits* we usually get.

I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes and I did not add the cornmeal. Next time I will just to see what happens. Very good. In fact, my guests loved it. Plus it is good cold.

This was okay but a little bland for my tastes. (I love spice though) My family didn't make comment so it must have been okay for them. I used Mexican oregano which has a different flavor than the Mediterranean type. We used this warm to make taco salad for dinner and it turned out well. I would fix this again, but it didn't make my favorites list.

I don't know if I did something wrong when I attempted this recipe, but it came out so bland that I had to add a packet of seasonings, a can of green chiles, and lots of water so it wasn't so thick.  I really had high hopes for this recipe because of all the wonderful reviews I read.  Could it have been something I did wrong?  One would tend to think that, but then again, how hard can it be to follow the easy directions?  However, I am sure that the person who made up this recipe really has a treasure here - I guess I just wasn't the person to discover it! : )  Oh well, I'm glad everyone else enjoyed it so much!!  Happy Cooking!

The first time I made this, I cut back on the seasonings because I thought it would kill my husband (he's not overly fond of spicy food). It is far better with the called for amounts and still isn't a mouth-burner. It was a huge hit for burritos and for dip.

I thought this was just ok.  I didn't have enough chili powder and I think it would be better if I did.  I used 1 pound of beef w/a whole onion, 2 cloves of garlic, and a whole can of tomatoes.

Good blend of spices- needs a good amount of salt. I used ground turkey so it was very dry and needed to add some extra water for moisture.  Did not add any cornmeal at all. Will try to use this more often than packaged taco seasoning.

Very good!  I used this with ground turkey and since I halved the recipe and did not want to waste half a can of tomatoes, I used a good quality salsa in its place.  This made for some tasty tacos and I plan to use up the leftovers with nachos.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best taco meat ever!! I don’t just use it for taco salad - also use for regular tacos and taco casserole!! I will NEVER use taco seasoning packets again! This is the best without all the sodium that the packets have!! Highly recommend! I did follow the directions - but for the diced tomatoes - used tomatoes with green chilies and added a bit of Slap Yo Mama seasoning to add some heat & kick!! YUM!!

I used salsa instead of the canned tomatoes. Otherwise, I pretty much followed the recipe. There was enough left for taco salad the next day. I added kidney beans and fresh chopped tomatoes. My family loved this one!

We only used 1 pound of ground turkey and cut the rest of the recipe in half and, oh yes we forgot the garlic it was still very good!
We enjoyed!

This dish was amazing! I did as directed except I changed it out for ground turkey and slimmed down the sodium because of our diet. I'll make this dish again and again all summer long, and then some since we live in Florida. ??

Absolutely.  Positively.  Phenomenal.  I grew up in Texas on a diet of Tex-Mex.  For years I've been disappointed with ground beef that I've made for Tacos.  I'd always used the Old ElPaso taco meat mix, or those like it.  I always felt they were mediocre at best.  

Tonight, I finally decided to check out AllRecipes.  I should've done it a long time ago.  

I chose this recipe out of all the others, and man am I (and my family) glad that I did.  The ONLY thing I did different was to use two 10oz cans of Rotel rather than the 14 oz of tomatoes.  

Other than that, I followed it to the letter -- even though I was tempted to alter it.  Don't Do It!  Prepare it exactly as directed and you'll be the hit of your next fiesta.

I'd give it more stars if I could.  ENJOY!

We used Rotel's diced tomatoes and green chiles instead of just diced tomatoes to give it a kick. We also added jalapeños to the meat mixture. We didn't have cornmeal so we substituted flour. The tacos were extremely flavorful and I would make it again.

I made this few times, and I love how it comes out, however I did add more seasoning because I just didn't get the authentic taste with what's suggested in the recipe. all around this is a good one.

I halved the recipe & chose to use ground turkey, following another reviewer's idea of adding 2 tbs lime juice while the onions were sautéed.  The other ingredients were: 1 tbs olive oil; 1/2 cup onion, chopped; 1 large clove garlic, chopped; 1 tbs Penzey's chili 3000; 1 tsp oregano; 1 tbs ground cumin; 1 14.5 oz can Furmanos salsa style petite diced tomatoes; 1/4 c cornmeal.  Yum!

This is identical to the way I make my tacos.  I like to make them in bulk because I freeze the meat in containers and use it to make taco salad, tacos, burritos - whatever I want.  And it does get better if it sits overnight and gives the meat and spice to marry.  I have used pork , chicken and turkey besides the ground beef and it comes out great every time.  I do sub 1/2 T for ground chipotle chili powder because I like the smoky taste and the added burn.

I used my own taco seasoning from which is very close to the seasoning mix except it has red pepper and garlic powder in it.  used turkey as ground beef is not the quality is used to be.  like to use sour cream with home made french dressing found on this site.  Very good starter salad to add your personal touch to, add corn to salad and layer with corn chips

These simple tacos were great! I didn't make any changes, but was nervous about the cornmeal as I never heard of that before in a taco recipe. The cornmeal gave it an authentic taste and helped bind everything together. Also, I've never added Rotel to a recipe, but I loved it! Will definitely be making this again.

I used four turkey patties that were thawed for the ground turkey and I halved the ingredients.  I did not have cumin so I put 1 tbs of fiesta lime by Mrs. Dash.   It was very tasty.  I topped it with sour cream, guacamole, salsa and shredded cheese.

This recipe as my base was awesome. I tweaked it some.  I used Lawry's season salt, paprika, a pinch of onion salt, I am sure I added 2x more cumin than called for in the recipe, two cloves of garlic, a 1/2 tbspn of dried cinnamon, a 1/2 tbspn of cayenne pepper, and I probably used 1/2 the chili  powder, I don't cook with olive oil anymore I used clarified butter (ghee), in my cast iron dutch oven. I also added a 32 oz of cannellini beans (Goya) and my 14.5 oz can of tomatoes was the seasoned tomatoes with basil and garlic. I also used a 24 oz of Rao's tomato basil marinara sauce.  I add Rao's to everything that requires tomatoes it is fabulous. You don't have to use the entire jar like I did. We ate this as the main meal with corn chips on the side. I loved it. I loved the turkey it was seasoned properly. If I had more time I would have let the turkey sit in the fridge for an hour seasoned maybe next time I will try to follow the recipe less liberally.  I will definitely make this again.

I like to add spinach after simmering in crushed tomatoes. 1T chili powder per pound is way too much for me; I use only about 1/4t. I also skip the cornmeal. We like to have with on a piece of romaine and slice of multigrain bread (like an open-face sandwich).

This was easy and really tasty. I used ground turkey breast and thought the final dish tasted very similar to the packaged taco seasoning mixes. I liked being able to control how spicy it was. I did not have cornmeal so I just omitted it, and thought the texture was still great - not too saucy.

I only used a pound of turkey and halved all of the ingredients.  I also added a bit of fajita seasoning in addition to the chili powder and, as someone else suggested, used 1 cup of salsa instead of diced tomatoes.  Combined with a little cheese, sour cream, and homemade corn and black bean salsa, it was great.  A hit with my family!

Followed the recipe and the whole family loved it.  I used all turkey for the recipe, which I enjoyed as a salad and my kids enjoyed in taco shells. Making a big batch and freezing it means having an easy and tasty meal on the table in only minutes.  Great recipe that this family will rely on frequently.

This is one of my favorite recipes I make it about once every couple of months and it lasts us a while and I freeze the leftovers for tacos later. My kids love it; it's one of their favorite meals. I use turkey meat and it tastes great. I also use it as a base for a camping meal; it works every time.

I made this with ground turkey and was a little disappointed that it didn't have more flavor.  It was just missing...something.

I changed the recipe to 4 servings and used ground turkey.  It took a lot a extra seasoning to get it to have any flavor at all.  Maybe it's better with ground beef - will try that next time.

I liked it and was surprised by the cornmeal but will try to adjust the seasoning to make it more flavorful. Would still recommend it.

I tried this for taco filling last night and it was wonderfull!  My husband loved it.  I added red pepper flakes to make it a little more spicy.  This will be my "go to" recipe when I want to make tacos.  I know it would make a great taco salad too!

I've been using this recipe now for about 2 years, so I thought I had better rate it. I make it exactly as written. My family will not eat tacos with beef made any other way. I didn't have some of the ingredients one night and made tacos with a package of spice I had in the cupboard....YUCK!!! Most of supper got chucked that night! Thanks for the great recipe!

Killer flavor comes from using your own spices to season this taco meat. I agree with other reviewers - it tastes much better than using a package mix chuck full of sodium. We decided we wanted the meat a little zippier so I added a tablespoon of Chipotle pepper (smoked jalapenos, dried & ground. comes in a jar). Added the cornmeal after simmering 5 min and voila - best taco salad meat ever!

Easy and relatively quick.  I used about 1/3 ground beef and 1/2 the spices, but all of the tomato.  I'm just not into using half a can of diced tomatoes.  Anyway, it's a nice combination and I served it as taco salad with refried beans, chips, lettuce, olives (for me), and salsa.  Pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first recipe I've found for ground turkey that I love to make. Super easy, versatile and tastes great with turkey or beef.  I like to add a tsp of ancho chili powder to give it a little more flavor without adding heat. I will never buy taco seasoning again!

We used ground turkey.  I hadn't been successful with turkey tacos using packet seasoning but these were great.  I'll be using this recipe instead of the packet seasoning from now on, with beef tacos too.

Very good recipe. I omit the onions and bell pepper and just add a jar of salsa. It saves on prep time. I really like the consistency once the cornmeal is added. I also add a little cayenne pepper to add some kick. This is my second time making this recipe and it definitely won't be the last. Thanks for a great recipe.

We enjoyed this with hamburger or chicken. I made it a second time a week later for company and it was devoured.  I used mexican chahuahua cheese and fried flour tortillas a little. I placed the meat on 1/2 of the tortilla then added the cheese and folded them over.  I allowed the guests to add tomatoes, cilantro, chopped green onions and salsa.

Had all the ingredients on hand for a quick dinner.  I cut down the recipe to 1# of ground beef, therefore, didn't want to open a whole can of tomatoes for this one recipe.  I had some homemade salsa on hand, so used it instead.  Didn't really see the need for the cornmeal, so didn't add it.  BF liked it, so looks like we'll be having this again.  Much better than the package stuff.

Like a previous reviewer I am now following a low sodium diet. I love Mexican food but those "taco seasoning packets" are filled with large amounts of sodium and a big no no!! So when I came upon this recipe it seemed quite simple and there was no salt added to it. I also used the "no salt added" diced tomatoes. We like things spicy so I did add more cumin. I didn't see the need for he corn meal so I left it out all together. This recipe is fabulous! I'll never use the seasoning packets again. My husband LOVES this recipe. We've made tacos, chimichungas and put it on rolls for a a sloppy joe like another poster mentioned. Thanks for the recipe!! One of my best finds here.

I cooked this in a slow cooker with added water on low for about 5 hours.  I browned and drained the beef first.  I did not really like this very much.  I don't know if its because of the slow cooker or not, but I cook chili and things like that with the same spices and they never taste funny like this did.  Its a great recipe as far as the idea goes, I'm just going to have to look around for another one.

I give 5 stars because no one in my family "likes" turkey, but after they ate this, I made the big reveal.  Everyone was in shock that they had eaten turkey meat.  I, also, substituted salsa for the diced tomatoes due to not having diced tomatoes.  GREAT!

I did the recipie by the book and It seemed to taste to me like a sloppy joe not really like a taco meat.  I used the meat as a topping for nachos.  My husband likes the meat and he gave no complaints and he is the type to tell you.  Overall it was  good.  I do not think I will make this again, but it is still good eatin'.

This was delicious!  I do not cook often and am always afraid when I try new recipes.  This was easy and everyone loved it.  I used turkey meat and it worked well.

Wow! This was perfect. I used super lean turkey and used hot salsa instead of the tomatoes. Other than the salsa everything else was according to recipe including the cornmeal and it was perfect. Now I can make this on my own to make it lower sodium and it was really quick too!! Will most definitely make this again. Thaks for the recipe.

Great flavor!  I like the natural ingredients compared to the packaged stuff.  I used maltodextrin instead of cornmeal.  It added some sweetness that complemented the spice.

This recipe is really good. I have never made my own taco seasoning before and I will never use it again. The only thing is that it needs a little more of a kick to it. It needs something so I guess I will play with it a little bit and see if anything helps. My husband loved them and ate 4 tacos. I will definitely make this again.

This is an excellent alternative to the packaged seasoning variety.  I was looking for a homemade and authentic tasting taco meat but without the artificial taco seasoning packets you find at the grocery store.  I did puree the tomatoes and didn't add as much cumin, just due to personal tastes, 
and I forgot to add the cornmeal.  Delicous and my kids loved it too.

This was fantastic.  I can't wait for taco salad tomorrow.  Like someone else who reviewed this, I did not need the cornmeal. I did not add any tomatoes and used salsa instead. I will never use a taco seasoning packet again.

This was great for tacos.  I used them for 7 for dinner and had plenty left over for my own taco salads for lunches.  I used all lean ground beef.  Great recipe!  Much better than a taco seasoning packet.

This was good but I scaled back to 2lbs beef and used 1 10oz can of Rotel otherwise used about the same measurements for spices. I also added garlic salt and garlic powder per my taste. I'm thinking of adding green chiles too. Great basic recipe to adjust to your own taste.

I made this recipe with ground buffalo and I substituted salsa for the canned tomates.  I made the best burrito using this meat,taco sauce, black beans, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, and tomatoes.  I will definitely make again and again!

This taco meat turned out really well.  I liked the addition of the cornmeal..it kind of holds the meat together with all of the juices instead of just running out of the side of the taco!  My supermarket was out of ground turkey (which I prefer over ground beef) so I had to use 80% lean ground beef.  I drained it really well after browning and then added the seasonings.  I left out the vegetables the recipe called for and just added garic powder and onion powder.  I did have to add some water to the meat though after adding the cornmeal.. I think I drained it too well.  I actually didn't eat any of this..but my husband finsihed all 2 pounds of taco meat himself :0  That's a good sign to me.  I'll make this again when he's in the mood for tacos.

This made an excellent taco salad with cool ranch doritos crushed, lettuce, tomatoes, olives and ranch dressing with a sprinkle of cheese. We are having it as tacos later in the week. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I think it needs to be spicier. Maybe by adding a few jalapeno peppers in with the onions? Will play with it a bit to add more kick but otherwise great recipe. Thanks!

Really liked this recipe; I only made one change. I used corn instead of tomatoes (only because we don't like tomatoes, and I figured corn would work). Oh - and actually forgot the garlic! But still it tasted really good and I will definitely use again. I made a "mexican-style" enchilda casserole; layered tortillas, meat mixtures, mexican cheese blend, broken tortilla chips and then one more layer of all. Baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Yummy! Thank you for a good recipe!

This was awesome and am very picky about any kind of food like this.  I made this last night and it was great.  I did not have tomatoes or onions so I used mango salsa and regular salsa.  It was so good.  My friend added to a salad with a dash of Catalina dressing.  I would def recommend this.

This seasoning comes out more like Ortega taco seasoning than the Old El Paso that we would normally use, but it was still really good. I cooked it with a seeded jalapeno chile, and was forced to omit the diced tomatoes as my husband hates them and I had no salsa on hand. It could have used a little more spice, but otherwise it was really good and satisfying to eat tacos without all that extra sodium.

This has been a wonderful addition to our standard taco salad. The boys just ate the leftover meat on fried corn tortillas. YUM twice in one evening! It is not quite spicy enough for us. We are still trying to spice it up.

This turned out awesome! I will never again purchase packaged taco seasoning again. It does take a little longer to prepare, (since you don't just open a package a pour it in) But it is worth every extra minute! I will definitely make this again. Great recipe!

This was an awesome and easy recipe. I used vegitarian ground round and added 1-2 tbsp. Ketchup for added flavour. I also recommend making a side of guaccamole to add to your taco or pita.  Very Tasty and a definite keeper.

My wife made this and she scaled it down to one pound and then added 2 chipotle peppers from a can and it was delicious.
