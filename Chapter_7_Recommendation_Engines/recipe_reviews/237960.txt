This is really good and easy to make, but the underside of the biscuits always remains doughy while the tops brown nicely. This happens even when I peel the biscuits in half. *When it looks done, flip the biscuits over and bake for another 10 minutes or so. Voila

My hubby really enjoyed this recipe. I’ve never attempted to make pot pie of any kind prior to tonight. It was really savory and satisfying and I didn’t need a campfire. I used another poster’s suggestion of baking it in the oven for 20-25 minutes at 375. In the last 2 minutes of baking, I turned the broiler on HI and browned the tops of the biscuits. So easy, it’s hard to mess this up.

Such an easy and quick recipe for a Dutch oven! Just for the convenience, we used two cans of undrained chunk chicken breasts instead of precooked chicken breasts. We also added one large can of chicken noodle soup (26 oz) for flavoring and to dilute the creamed soups a bit. Sincle we had a large group, we also double the recipe by using the larger cans of creamed soup (26 oz) also and adding double the veggies.  This recipe is a keeper!

I had a similar recipe.  I used cream of chicken and herb soup, cheddar cheese, corn and carrots.  I topped it off with a layer of cheddar cheese and Grands Flaky Biscuits.

We used canned chicken too and sometimes just leave off the biscuits so that is a completely can opening and dumping, no refrigerating dish.

EASY!!! I didn't get my biscuit fully browned because of having to play around with the heat. Cooking on a campfire isn't super easy. I checked it often and changed the elevation so it didn't get burned on the bottom. Took a good 30-40 minutes, but was amazing!
