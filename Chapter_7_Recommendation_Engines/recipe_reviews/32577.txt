I made this most wonderful punch for our daughter's wedding.  It doesn't leave the mouth sticky like most punch, instead, it's quite refreshing.  I received many compliments on the flavor and even the color.  I'd like to pass on something I did.  I wanted an ice ring.  I filled my mold to about a 1/3 of it's capacity, then put it in the freezer.  At the same time, I took fresh strawberries,(washed and hulled) and frozen them on a plate lined with waxed paper.  I also filled a container with punch and froze it to the consistancy of slush.  When the mold was frozen, I added the strawberries and the "slush" to fill the mold and returned it to the freezer.  It really looked pretty. I also placed the remaining frozen strawberries in the punch to help keep it cold.   Her wedding was Valentine's day and the  strawberries in the punch was a colorful touch.

One mistake I made...I didn't make enough.  I trippled the punch and it still wasn't enough.  Many liked the punch much better than the wonderful champaign we had.

This was a big hit at a meeting.  EVERYONE wanted more when it was gone.  The only change that I made, I made it four times over and only added 3 gallons of water and extra sugar, I added alot of ice and that made up for the extra gallon of water.  Will be making this again.  Thanks

I served this wonderful punch at a birthday party for my 80 year old mother.  It was delightful.  I added some additional ingredients.  I scaled the recipe up for 100 people, and added two 1 liter bottles of Gingerale.  Also, to top this off I added softened lemon sherbert to float on the top.   The rich golden color is just perfect for the fall and made a lovely addition to the table.

Confronted with the task of making some punch for a wedding reception,I looked to allrecipe.com to see if I'd find something appropriate. The name caught my eye then the simple ingrediants seemed like they would blend well together. I made a batch a week early to taste- thats when I knew it was gonna work. I decided to "doctor it up" by replacing the O.J. with Minute Maid Blends orange passion concentrate. I used a little less lemon juice about 1 1/4 cup per gallon of water and I also added a fruit blend from Trader Joes (mango,guava,passion fruit,orange ect.) a little extra sugar to compensate for the melting ice.  It was great

Not what I expected. I followed the recipe to a T. I am not sure why my guests did not gobble it up. Maybe they had to many drink selections. It tasted very "pineappley".

I served this for my parents' 50th wedding anniversary party, and it was *definitely* a hit!  With triple the recipe and about 85 guests, there were 2 cups left at the end of the 3 hour party.  I bought a three tiered beverage fountain from an online retailer (think of a river in South America) for about $50, and didn't want a recipe with carbonation which would quickly be lost, or citrus pulp which would clog the pump or holes in the fountain.  This recipe was a TOTAL success!!!  Nice flavor and the golden color of course matched the golden theme of the anniversary.  I was worried about using bottled lemon juice rather than fresh, but it worked fine.  And the sugar seemed like a lot, but with all the lemon juice, it was needed.  A great alternative punch to the "standard fare" red punch or those made with ice cream or sherbet, lemon lime pop, etc..  The fountain was very much a hit with the kids, and no spilling as with a ladle!  Tara, thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Wow!  I made this punch for a church function and it was a huge hit!  Several people commented that it was the best they ever had.  I did make some changes as suggested in other reviews.  I used a 2 liter bottle of lemon-lime soda instead of the sugar/lemon juice/water mix. Making the recipe 1 can of OJ concentrate, 1 46oz can pineapple juice and 1 2 liter bottle of lemon-lime soda. I added a squirt of grenadine in the bottom of the punch glasses after filling with the punch which made a really lovely "sunrise" effect.

I had this recipe in my recipe box for a long time before using it for my inlaws' 50th wedding anniversary.  Wow - so glad I kept it!  This was a HUGE hit at the party.  I did make some changes due to an unintentional error on the recipe (I'd forgotten it and my mom read it to me on the phone when we were on the road.), and due to what my favorite no-frills grocery store carries.  For one original batch, I used all the same amounts for all but the pineapple juice.  I used 4, 12 ounce cans of *orange/pineapple/apple* juice.  I just realized it when coming to rate this, what happened.  I thought it was rather strong punch - LOL!  Everyone loved it, though!  Out of ~100 people at the party, I had 20 requests for the recipe.  Our aunt was laughing all day at me, serving punch and yakking away about AllRecipes.com!!!  If you make this for a party, you really *must* have copies of the recipe with you!!!  My MIL had 5 more requests for the recipe today when she was at church!  THANK YOU!!  What I *really* enjoy about this punch is how it doesn't have any carbonation or sherbet.  You can make it up ahead of time.  We mixed the sugar and water in pitchers, and the other juices in another container, and then just poured the two together into the punch bowl when we needed more (I separated out each batch).  I'd figured on 120 people with 8 oz cups, so I made three times what the stated recipe said for the number of people.  You'll want to make at least twice as much! I added frozen frui

Thank you Tara Laine Hoffman for this wonderful punch recipe. I made this for my Christmas party this past Friday, and it was wonderful. I scaled the recipe for 40 people. My punch bowl wasn't large enough to hold that amount of punch, so I mixed what I could and the punch still turned out perfectly. I only got to drink one cup while others were scavenging to find more. I was asked to make more but I only bought enough for one round. Anyway I now have to pass out the recipe, and have enough for next time. Five stars all the way! ! ! !

I like fizzy punch so I used 2 liters of ginger ale instead of the sugar and water.  The punch was a huge hit.  One 13-year-old boy said "This is actually kinda good!" so I told him he should have this punch at his wedding.  Not overly sweet!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  I made this for my inlaws 40th anniversary party at a BYO restaurant.  Considering that I only found the recipe @ 7AM on the morning of the party, I needed something easy.  I made this and it turned out FABULOUS!  It was delicious and people kept refilling their glasses.  I was particular about what I needed because the party began at 1 and I needed something that could be either nonalcoholic or spiked.  I made this and offered a spike of champagne - kind of mimosa-ish but not that you can't drink more than 1 or 2.  It was delicious - refreshing and sweet, but not too sweet.  Also, since I didn't have time to make an ice ring, I added 2 (10 oz ?) bags of sliced frozen strawberries and it was PERFECT!!!!!!!!! Champagne & strawberries in a mimosa!!!! what could have been better!  I will make this again & again - thanks for sharing such a fabulous, versatile recipe.

I made this punch for a middle school dance.  The kids loved it!  We needed a light colored punch so the table cloths wouldn't be ruined by red stains(pre-teens with cups).
I used gingerale instead of the sugar and water and it gave it a "sparkley" flavor.  I did this because where I was didn't have a kitchen and it was easier to carry.  I just mixed the cold ingredients as I ran out (I used two bowls).  I allowed the juices to thaw in the fridge and put everything else in to chill.

I did omit the lemon juice and added another can of pineapple juice,  plus 46 oz. of water rather than a gallon. Let me tell you, it was gone in 60 seconds! My party guests were raving about it. I will definitely make this again.

This punch was very good - although I had to add an additional cup of sugar as it was pretty tart with the lemon juice without it.  All the guests kept coming back for more and asking what was in it.

I made this punch for a wedding reception recently and it was excellent.  I received complement and complement.  I wish I had made more though; I ran out before the reception was over.  Thank goodness I had extra lemonade on hand.  There were about 150 guests and I made the recipe for 200 due to other reviews stating they also ran out early.  My suggestion is to make a little extra.  Also, I used a punch fountain and did not have any problems at all.

I made this punch for our wedding 6 years ago. It was wonderful! I have been looking for an excuse to make some more since. Threw my husband a birthday party just to make the punch! Okay, so that was a bit of an exaggeration but it really is tasty punch.

Made this for my in-laws golden anniversary reception. I used 1 C sugar, 1/2 gallon water, & a 2-liter of gingerale to add a little spritz to the punch.  (note:  you may mix & chill all ingredients ahead of time and add gingerale and a little ice right before serving.)  It was fabulous and the color complimented the decor well.  Everyone loved it!

I made this punch for my soon to be daughter in law's bridal shower.  It was a BIG hit. Everyone loved it. And, her colors are yellow so it even matched! We got a heart shaped mold and froze our ice with lemon slices in that. It was really nice. We plan to make this for the wedding as well.

This is an excellent punch, but my daughters thought it was too lemony.

Very good punch!  I scaled it way down since I only had 2 6 oz. cans of pineapple juice I needed to use up.  I didn't use quite all of the water called for since I was serving it over ice and didn't want it to be watery.  It'd be interesting to try substituting the water for carbonated water or gingerale.

I made this for a wedding it went over very well I could barely make it fast enogh and I had a doubble batch made to start with. This is a lite drink and works well with added ingredients to change the taste ex. with a small batch I made at home I added coconut rum to it and it gave it a whole new twist. For large amounts of this I found that using a well cleaned 3 gal water cooler bottle to mix in helped and also made getting it to and pouring it into the bowl easy.

I served this punch at my grandparents 50th anniversary party. We had about 50 people there and I yielded the recipe for 100. After the party ended, the punch machine was almost dry!! This is a must have punch. Tastes great!! Guests were very impressed!!

Served this at a birthday open house for my grandmother. People loved it. We did make some adjustments to the recipe. Instead of using cans of pineapple juice we used sweetened frozen pineapple concentrate and added the amount of water called for on the can. We also substituted approx half the water in the recipe with grapefruit soda.

First time making a punch.  Little too sweet for me, I think I'd cut back on the pineapple juice and add some more OJ and lessen the sugar some.

This punch is delicious - very tropical! My variation: 8c OJ, 8c PJ, 4c seltzer, 1/2c lemon juice. I left out the sugar. Word to the wise: I made this for a baby shower, and my pregnant friend drank some and got horrible heartburn due to the orange juice.

I love this punch, with some changes. I used 1 and a quarter lemon juice and 5 smashed bananas, and 6 cups of water. I froze everything together and then poured 7 up on the mixture a few hours before serving.

Hope to make this punch for my daughters wedding in August but being in England we no longer have frozen orange juice in cans. Can anyone recommend alternatives? Would freshly sqeezed orange juice be better and would PLJ do for lemon juice?

This was great!  I used unsweetened pineapple juice which made the punch a little tangier than I believe it should have been.  It was still really good though!  It makes a large batch, so I froze some in a gallon size plastic bag for later.

This was easy and delicious!  I didn't want a bubbly punch for my brunch so I gave this one a try.  Wow!  From my son to my husband's grandparents, everyone loved it.   I made a half batch and it was all gone!  Delicious.

Great flavour! What makes this different than most punches is that it doesn't have that overly sweet sticky/pasty effect on the tongue - likely thanks to the lemon juice.

Excellent punch.  Made this last year for our annual Halloween Party.  Served it in a large black cauldron and told the kid's it was "witch's pee".  I made a double batch and only had about a quart left over.  Will make again this Halloween.  Thanks for sharing.

Simple, easy, inexpesive and delicious!  Not much left after a birthday party with a bunch of 10 year old girls.  Used unsweetened pineapple juice and it was just sweet enough.

I have made a version this recipe twice and it is a big hit.  I only use the Orange Juice, Pineapple Juice and 7 Up or Sprite.  I do not use water or sugar.  With the 3 ingredients I use it is so good.  Everyone loves it.  I have made it for 250 people and ran out and for 25 people.    Give it a try!
