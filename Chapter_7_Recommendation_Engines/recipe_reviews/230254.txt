Very,very good.  I like spice, so I use a little more hot sauce.  Great to take to a party or a dinner.  I like the idea for decorating the top.

This is good. Best on saltines. Next time I might add 1 more can of crab meat for more crab flavor.

BLAND!!!!  I added a tiny dash of Cayenne, but in hindsight I should have added more. Maybe some salt? I don't know. It didn't taste terrible, it was "ok", but just SO BLAND! I tried putting some Frank's hot sauce on it, but then it just tasted 100% like Frank's hot sauce. I think I will add some cayenne to the leftovers and maybe it will make a good condiment for a sandwich.

The flavor is okay, but the jelly-like consistency is weird. It looks beautiful ( I even did a crab stencil in paprika) but when you cut into it ... Just odd. I might make it as a dip next time, forget the gelatin and molding it.

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a total of 3 cans of crabmeat.  It has a very good flavor.  But I was not firm enough to unmold. The crab meat was obliterated in the processor.  I think next time I will add 2 packs of gelatin and mix the crab meat in by hand..

Recipe didn't gel like expected. Crab flavor was weak.

Just made this for Christmas '13. The family and friends loved it. It makes a good amount for a party. If you want to get wild, add a little minced garlic :) Thanks for the recipe. This would double really well as a filling for mushrooms or maybe even some breakfast crepes or omelette.
