I've never made or eaten bison before, so this was a first for us. It was DELICIOUS...Tender, juicy and so flavorful! I marinated the meat overnight. The yogurt-cucumber sauce was sooooo good, and complimented the bison wonderfully. I will be keeping my eye out for bison in the markets (haven't seen it so far), and I can't wait to make these again and try some other recipes~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

It was my first time eating Bison and it was really good, I didn't tell the kids what it was until they finished.... they loved it! I loved the marinade, it was a perfect combination of flavors... the yogurt sauce was a perfect dip! I followed the recipe exactly as stated.

Quite tasty. Don't hesitate to marinate overnight. I had to use beef skirt steak, but it was delicious. The yogurt sauce is yummy. Will make again.
