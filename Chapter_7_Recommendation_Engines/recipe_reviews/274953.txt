Great! I've never tried the original blooming onion dish, but this is like a healthier alternative to onion rings, or, like he mentions in the vid, French onion soup turned into a solid bite. The proportions of the ingredients seem a bit off, as  I had far from enough to spread over all the onions, but that's a trivial adjustment to do.
