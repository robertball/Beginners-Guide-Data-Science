The only way I have ever gotten any of these granola bar recipes to stick together is to melt the butter and sweetener together over low heat on the stovetop (and drastically reduce the sugar, I might add), mix the dry ingredients in a bowl, then pour the melted butter in and mix well. If you plan to add any chips, wait for the mixture to cool to room first. Then I push the mixture into the greased pan and bake. It will seem really greasy until it thoroughly cools. Then you will have a happy, held-together granola bar. :)

Great recipe.  I made it exactly as written the first time.  The kids loved them, but I thought they were a bit too sweet.  I cut the sugar in half, and they were perfect.  I've used Sucanat in place of sugar with great results.  I do bake them a bit longer, maybe 20 minutes, to get them crisper.  Overall, a keeper.

I thought my end result was a 5 but I'm not sure as written it is. 

I used way less brown sugar about 3/4 c and it was still really sweet. I didn't have wheat bran so i subbed 1/2 c flaxseed & 1/2 self-rising flour. My mixture would not stick together so I ended up adding an egg & a 1/2t soda. Added apricots & cranberries. I couldn't get it to spread out in a 9X13 so I used an 11X7 and cooked it about 20 minutes. End result is fantastic!

Great base recipe for granola. I added chopped almonds and dried cherries, plums and cranberries for a sweet and crunchy taste. It didn't quite keep the "bar" shape, though, so I broke it into crumbles to make a yummy homemade cereal. Thanks for the recipe, Tony!

It was really good, except I followed some of the other advice: I added a few more dry ingredients (whole wheat flour, ground flaxseed) and I baked mine twice as long. I baked them for 10 minutes, then cut them into bars and baked for 10 more minutes. After they were completely cooled, they were firm and stuck together rather well. Next time I might cut the sugar, as well - they were pretty sweet. But my kids love them!

Way too sweet, moist, and chewy to be called a granola bar.  Try another recipe.
Also, beware that this makes a large amount!

This recipe is great, although I didn't really put in all of the above ingredients because I realized I only had 3/4 cup of oats . . . ended up doing a combo of oats, oat bran, wheat germ, sesame seeds, ground flax seeds & whole wheat flour that all equaled 4 cups in place of the 3 cups oats and 1 cup wheat bran (which I didn't have at all).  I added craisins to half the batch and that was good. Does anyone have suggestions on making them stick together better???

The flavor of these was good but WAY too sweet.  I would make them again because they are so easy but I will cut the sugar in half.  Also, they didn't stick together at first.  I had to return them to the oven for an additional 10 mintues which did the trick.

These granola bars were good but hard. First time I made them I let the cool, and then I cut them but they were to hard to cut. Second time I made them I cut them before they cooled all the way but then they were to hard to bite. I do not know if it is just me.

Great base. I cut the sugar to a little under 1 cup. And I substituted butter for shortening and added dried cranberries. I also cooked it for double the time. I used the tip from another where they suggest heating the butter and sugar before adding to recipe to ensure stickiness.

This recipe is tasty and can be modified with nuts or dried fruit. By putting the granola bars into the refrigerator as soon as they are done baking, it helps the firmness.

I thought this recipe was great. Very easy to make. I added chopped almonds, sunflower seeds, raisins, & dried cranberries. The bars to not stay together well, but you can crumble up the granola and sprinkle over yogurt!

Great outcome! This was precisely what I was looking for. Using other readers' reviews I made sure to melt the liquid ingredients first (stovetop). Used only 1/2 cup sugar mixed with some splenda, and only used half cup butter filling the rest with unsweetened apple sauce and some pure organic coconut butter. I did put more than double the cinnamon because my family loves it, added some nutmeg too. To the dry ingredients I added half a cup organic Soy flour to keep things stuck together. Once I had my wet ingredients in a sauce, I poured over the dry ones (mix well if you mix this by hand, all the dry stuff needs to stick together in the end). I added goodies to my bars: pumpkin + sunflower+ flax seeds, walnuts and sesame as well as some gourmet dark chocolate chunks. Pressed the mixture tightly into a glass baking dish, baked 10 minutes, removed and cut, then baked another 10 minutes. PERFECT!

It was a really good granola bar.  We decided to play with it though.  We didn't add the baking soda, replaced the butter with peanut butter, added nutmeg, nuts, and dehydrated fruit and turned it into cereal!  We haven't bought any cereal from the store since!!!

This is a tasty treat, but as others have said, it does not keep it's bar shape...they fall apart very easily. Still good though.

These were a good granola bar but you have to be really careful to not overcook them or they get hard.

Didn't have wheat bran, so I subbed it for one part oat bran, one part hot cereal. I also added a bit of cocoa powder and chocolate chips because I love chocolate, and I cut the recipe in half.

I think the bitterness of the cocoa powder might have cancelled out some of the sweetness that everyone has been talking about. I didn't think they were overbearingly sweet, but I also have a sweet tooth. My husband and I really liked how they turned out, though.

My only real complaint would be that they are Incredibly crumbly, especially if they're thicker than 1/4 of an inch. I noticed the thinner it is, the less crumbly it is, but then it wouldn't be a bar, it'd be like peanut brittle. Shrug. Maybe honey would combat that? I dunno.

This recipe was truly amazing! It was very buttery, though, and it would soften if it got too warm- but if you refrigerate it, its stays firm. That is all because of the butter! I added chocolate chips and cranberries- haf cup each- and cut the recipe in half. I also popped it in the oven for 10 minutes, then took it out, and then cut into squares and it was back in the oven for 6 minutes. Next, I let it cool for 25 minutes and put it in the refrigerator- and they were perfect! This is a great base recipe. :)

Good base, here are my changes: 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar. 4 cups of oats (no other "flowers") twice the amount of cinnamon, add 1 cup raisins. Baked for 20 min.

I made the recipe as follows, but I halfed the sugar. I pressed mixture using a 1 cup measure into a foil lined 9x13 and baked it for 20 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes. Holding both ends of foil I removed from pan and placed on the counter. Cut into bars and let cool on rack for another 10 minutes. These were very greasy. I played the bars on paper towels to absorb the excess butter, twice. They are great bars however next time I will try less butter.

Fantastic recipe, I added 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup chopped, raw, almonds and a half a peach, pureed; it is like eating a peach cobbler for breakfast!  The wife and kids loved it too.
 
Although like others, I had a hard time getting it to stick together,I just cut a "bar", scooped the chunks into a bowl, added some milk and heat in the microwave; best granola cereal I have ever had.

I loved this recipe.  I only used a little less than a cup of the brown sugar and added a teaspoon of almond extract in addition to the vanilla.  I only baked mine for 6 minutes and they didn't get hard.  I pressed them after taking them out of the oven and cut them while they were hot.  They were fabulous! Oh and I didn't have bran, so I used a Cinnamon Life cereal.
