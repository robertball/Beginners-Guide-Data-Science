I tried using grape flavored Jello and I was not very happy with the taste. My kids however loved the grape flavor- as did kids from my church. (ages 3-12) I also tried rolling the balls in another package of grape Jello to add more flavor but I thought that it made the outside of the cookies kindof sour. (Probably why the kids liked them...) Next time I may try lemon or cherry flavor and roll the balls in plain sugar and then flatten them. You will need to add extra food coloring as the coloring in the jello really isn't enough to color the entire batch of dough. I used my Pampered Chef small scooper to make identical sized cookies and ended up with exactly 43 cookies. I also baked them on parchment for 7 minutes. Still soft inside and only slightly browned on the bottoms. Over all this was a good sugar cookie and they were very simple to make.

I was in a baking mood last night and after making some delicious oatmeal cookies I tried these. I had jello on hand and used the ingredient search voila!!! An instant hit! I work at a leading woment's fashion retailer and brought these in for my staff they LOVED them! The most asked question? "What's in these that makes them so good?" Well a little bit of jello and a whole lot of love... Thank you for the awesome recipe! It's going to be getting shared quite a bit! (I used raspberry gelatin powder and chopped up some milk chocolate squares and put them in the middle as a little chocolate fix for the girls!) Heather

I grew up making Jello cookies for Christmas using lime jello and cherry raspberry or cranberry flavored Jello. I love them my daughter also loves to make them. To make the color richer we add a few drops of food coloring to the cookie dough.

This cookie was very good. I even made a sugar-free version using splenda. Use sugar-free jello and add 1/2 cup of splenda and reduce flour to two cups. Bake as normal. It doesn't make as many cookies but they taste just as good. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

My husband loved these (gasp!!!). I wasnted more of a buttery taste to the so I made them with butter-flavored crisco. Kids loved them too. I think I may have over cooked them because they weren't moist enough... next time I make them the cooking time will be shorter. Thanks for sharing!

Mine came out crispy bland and colorless. They reminded me of eating dog treats. It's a great idea but really falls flat. I'm not a good enough baker to know how to modify this recipe to make this excellent idea get off the ground. I'm giving this two stars because my husband ate more than one.

Not very good. I used black cherry flavor and I didn't think they were very flavorful. The bottoms of my cookies burnt and I wonder if maybe the temp. was too high. There is just something missing with this recipe. I won't make them again.

I thought these were pretty good. I also used strawberry jell-o and my kids loved them too. Very easy. I will definitely use this recipe again and try different flavors to coordinate with the upcoming holidays.

These are great. I doubled the recipe and used cherry flavored jello. I may drizzle some chocolate on them. I am sure my kids will enjoy them(2 are headed back to college tomorrow). I plan on making orange ones for our trip south to see the granddaughter!

The recipe calls for ONE 3oz package of Jell-o but most packages are actually 3/10 of an ounce. Could this confusion be why some people thought it was bland and tasteless? I was about to try the recipe but only had a few packages of 3/10 oz jell-o.... Haven't tried yet someone let me know which it is?

I made these cookies with my 7 year old son and they were super easy and fun to make! We used cherry jello it was a bit tart so we melted chocolate frosting and dipped the tops of the cookies in it. They taste kind of like a chocolate covered cherry!

The kids liked them. I used wild cherry and they are pretty good. Bit sugary for me. We used cut outs to make them for Christmas might try a different flavor next time.

Oh my oh my. Grape and Streavery? Creative choices. Play it safe with more traditional choices for cookies -- Orange and Lemon jello pack a delightful flavor punch (no pun intended!)

My kids liked these and they smelled good. I tried one and thought they were pretty bad. I tried filling them with Lady Lock frosting to make them a little better. The color was nice though I used strawberry.

I loved the color of these cookies. (I used strawberry jello.) They had kind of a bland taste so I tried rolling some of them in sugar and that seemed to help a little bit. I used a contrasting colored sugar like blue which made them very vivid.

I was looking for a colorful and yummy treat for the holuday and thought I would try these. They turned out very pretty but the taste was very dissapointing. Very bland. I even sprinkled extra jello mix on top before baking. I tried raspberry and orange flavors. The kids didn't even ask for more the 3. Sorry...everyone has different tastes and these didn't suit us

My kids and I had a blast making these! It took no time at all and they felt like they really made something spectacular. The person who said they were tasteless and doughy must've made a mistake because they tasted great to me and my family. may need a bit more cooking time. We used cherry jello and can't wait to try different flavors to experiment!

I was looking for a different jello recipe and came across this one. I thought it sounded interesting so I went to the kitchen right away to see if I had all the ingredients. I had orange jello instead of strawberry and I cooked them and thought they looked like tiny pumpkins. I think I will make some for Halloween and put faces on them. Well I just tasted one and does have an interesting taste. I don't know if it's the orange or just the cookie itself but I am not impressed. I will give it another try with the strawberry to see if that's any better.

These cookies are edible but I think they are not something I will ever make again. Though I think kids would enjoy them. I used strawberry jello and the flavor had a mildly fruity taste.

I have to agree with the person that thought these cookies were bland and tasted doughy. I was very disappointed. I used raspberry jello. The color was great but not much taste at all. My 12 year old didnt like them either. I am debating trying lime for St. Pattys. Maybe raspberry just doesnt work.

Quite good a little sweet. The strawberry flavour was pink enough so I did not add any food colouring. I used butter instead of shortening and let my son use the mixer until the dough became quite fluffy.

I made these for valenties day. We used Strawberry jello and added sprinkles to the top. I tried shaping the cookies but could not. The kids really enjoyed them particularly due to the color. I'm preparing to make some green ones for St. Patricks day. It's a great alternative to cut-outs.

This was a pretty good cookie. Really sweet. I used strawberry jello and some people loved them while others thought they were too sweet. Overall though they were not bad. Will probably make them again with another flavor.

I could not find my mom's jello cookie recipe so tried this. The cookies were tasteless and dough like. My 7 year old son asked me not to bring them to school tomorrow. He said he knows what kids like and this wasn't it. I agree.

My four-yr-old loves making these. I make them with butter instead of shortening and it takes them from blah to melt-in-your-mouth. Also be careful to not over cook.

I made these with strawberry and lime (red and green) and used a cookie press to make Christmas cookies. Kids loved them and had a couple moms ask for the recipe. The dough works fine in the cookie press. I will definitely make these again.
