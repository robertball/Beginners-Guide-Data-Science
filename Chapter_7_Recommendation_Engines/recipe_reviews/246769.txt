What a great recipe!  For our vegan guests, I added jalapeños, red onions, carrots and celery to the basics listed above.  I also used only sesame oil and a little extra soy sauce.  Adaptable, flavorful, a little time-consuming to prep all the veggies, but a great dish.  Thanks for the post.

I love fried rice and the recipe is perfect for me! I'm a vegetarian but I don't like egg in fried rice so I was pleased to come across this recipe! I added corn and green onions since that was what I had on hand but next time I plan on adding onions, snap peas, zucchini, and sprouts.

I am making this right now but the ratio of soy sauce to rice is very high.  I've added the soy sauce without measuring but most likely used a tablespoons worth.  Only used 1/4 onion and 1 very large mushroom.

I added some celery and frozen peas.  I suggest sautéing the veggies a little before adding the rice as the bell pepper was still a wee bit crunchy.  It was a little too oily, probably my fault because I didn’t measure the oil. It was good though.  DH liked it. I will make again.  As someone else suggested be sure to use a NONSTICK pan or wok.

Quick and easy. Did not add as much sodium as stated but still tasted very good.

Very easy to make just be sure you have a big non stick pan to fry the rice in before you start.

I was excited about making this...love all the veges in it.  I was a little concerned about the amount of soy sauce mainly because I needed to quadruple the recipe.  That meant a cup of Soy Sauce! This was too much.  I'm thinking of going half.  Next time I'll add soy sauce last and adjust it.  Can't wait to try it again...all I could taste was soy sauce this time around.

We are not vegan, and we LOVED this!  I did not use the sliced mushrooms b/c I didn't have any on hand, but I followed the recipe otherwise. Great flavor...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
