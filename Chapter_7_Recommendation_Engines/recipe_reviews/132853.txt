I found this exact recipe on Recipezaar and love it!  Although that recipe did not call for cilantro - it called for 1 tsp. curry, 1 1/2 tsp cumin and 1/2 tsp cayenne - I would knock the cayenne back to 1/4 though...it was pretty spicy!!  And I made it with fresh pumpkin - takes a little time to cut, peel, boil and mash the pumpkin - but tasted great and a nice way to use pumpkins this fall!

This sounds great, I like to use grated ginger (fresh) with pumpkin or winter squash.
A hint about cooking fresh pumpkin: cut in half scoop out the seeds (bake and eat the seeds) then place on oven safe pan with 1/2 inch water and roast in a  300 degrees till tender, brings out the flavor and when cooled a bit you just scoop out the pulp, NO PEELING! works for me every time.

This is a great soup with a few changes for my family. We used white beans, no corn, and with the suggestions of others added,1/2 tsp more cumin, 2 tsp fresh ginger, 2 tsp curry powder, and almost a 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. Very tasty!

My husband and I loved this soup... with our own slight twists. I wanted to keep the soup more of a southwest style, so I did not add curry and ginger as other reviewers did. I added 2 tsp of cumin and replaced the tomato sauce with a large can of diced tomatoes. Added a little kick with cayenne and garnished the soup with sour cream instead of whipped cream. Delicious!

INCREDIBLE!  I changed/added a few items as I was working with what I had on hand...used 1 cup frozen corn, chopped small fresh tomato and finally added 1 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar.  As a garnish added a dolop of sour cream.  This is a keeper!  Thank you so much!

We had a small dinner party last night and featured this soup, and it was a huge hit! The only thing we changed was to puree it all with a hand blender. Creamy, hearty, perfectly spiced and delicious!

Amazing soup! I took others advice and increased the cumin to 1.5 tsp and added 2 tsp curry and 0.5 tsp of cayenne pepper, it's got the perfect kick!

This is really yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, using sour cream as the garnish, and I found the spices just right. I definitely recommend adding the sour cream, it's the perfect extra flavor.

I followed the reviewers advice and added curry & ginger.  Delicious!  I didn't have tomato sauce on hand so I used a can of diced tomatoes and a shot of tomato paste.  Fantastic way to use up leftover ingredients from Thanksgiving!

Very good. I also added a chili pepper. And I browned some stew meat cubes and threw those in to. I didn't have potatoes, so I cubed up some fresh pumpkin and threw that in with 1 c. pumpkin puree instead. Whipping cream wasn't needed. Just top with a little cheese and chips...like a taco soup.
I think it helped that I accidently browned the onions and cumin a little.

I was kind of worried about this soup (as was my wife) but after cooking it and letting the flavors blend, it was actually really good! I added in a little bit more of each spice it was calling for but it was probably needed. You should taste it first to decide for yourself.

Loved this! It's so healthy too. I used fat free chicken broth but next time i may try vegetable broth. I also added an extra can of beans(either black or garbanzo beans) and used frozen corn and a frozen mix of bell peppers. I did not use the cilantro but did as others suggested. I added 1 1/2 tsp of cumin, 2 tsp of curry powder, 2 tsp of ground ginger and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. It was great!

Wonderful soup recipe, I was looking for a pumpkin soup and this will be the one I used forever and ever. I liked this one because it used more pumpkin compared to similar recipes and included cumin, mmm. I made this to use up leftover chopped ham so I changed the beans to Northern, two cans for preference, and threw in at least a pound of ham. With the extra stuff I used a whole 48oz can of chicken broth, also for preference as we like brothy soups. My last change was to use a 14oz can of green chili tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, the added heat was perfect for us. I'm sure the next time I make this I'll change some more things around but the recipe itself is flawless, thanks so much for posting!

This is a great soup for those cooler days when you need something quick and healthy. I also added a touch of curry powder to make the soup more complex in flavor. Thanks for the recipe!  BTW, my 3 year old son enjoyed this soup, too.

This was pretty good but it didn't blow me away.  I had extra pumpkin on hand so it is a creative way to make a savory pumpkin dish.

Great soup!!! I added nutmeg, coriander, and brown sugar. If I had some sage I would have put that in also. I didn't have red peppers or black beans but I did have navy beans so I used those. I also deglazed my pan with apple wine after the onions, garlic, and spices were done. YUM!

I would give this 10 stars if I could! Sooooo good. I used fresh pureed pumpkin and leftover corn cut off the cob. I did not have cilantro, but will make sure I do the next time I make this, which will be soon. I also added about 1/2 cup of evaporated milk at the end because I didn't want to throw it away. Thanks so much for sharing.

I made the soup as written, except for using green peppers instead of red ones. I found the need to add some extra flavor when the soup was done. I added a few shakes of chili powder and two more teaspoons of salt. I served it up with dollops of sour cream, surrounding them with a sprinkled blend of Mexican cheese, and ate it using white tortilla chips. Both my husband and I enjoyed it, was like a different kind of chili.

Fantastic! Best soup I've made this fall so far, and I make one every Sunday night. I mostly kept to the recipe, but used frozen corn instead of canned and garnished with yougurt instead of cream.  I was able to take a small portion and puree it a little bit more for my 10-month old and he loved it too!

VERY pumpkin-y, but VERY good! I've made this twice now, once per the recipe and once with half the pumpkin and the other half vegetable stock. Both were excellent, the first being more like a stew and the second more of a soup. We prefer the thinner soup-like version as it doesn't scream pumpkin at you, but as I said, both were delicious. This is now a staple on our Lenten table as even our 6 year old daughter loves it! Thank you for such a great way to use pumpkin!

So good. Instead of heavy cream I added sour cream & a sprinkle of cheese with cilantoro. It is amazing with or without.

Good but due to a review I added 1/2 tsp more of cumin and 2 tsp curry.  I did serve with fresh cilantro and lime they weren't necessary it was good without it but we are lime lovers.

This soup would be a 5 if it were seasoned better; I love the veggies, but I thought it was a bit bland. I added 1 tsp fresh New Mexico red chile powder to the leftovers, and it was great. I also used a lot more cilantro, and fresh roasted pumpkin. I'd make this again with green pepper instead of red (thought the red was too sweet with the corn), more cumin, the red chile powder, and another clove of garlic. All in all, though, a very good recipe!

Very nice and very hearty. It did not even need salt and pepper for taste, which is good as this soup is already high in sodium. I used dried black beans rather that canned and low sodium chicken broth to make this a truly healthy soup. I could not detect the cilantro, so would add considerably more. Thank you for the recipe!

I really liked this soup.  The second day I added some leftover Salsa Chicken, it was even better.  I would make this again.

Despite doubling, substituting, and mangling the directions, I loved this soup! 

Started with 1 lb black beans pressure-cooked in 4 cups chicken broth, substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice for the cumin and orange bell peppers for the red, skipped the cilantro and cream. Yummy!

This is a hardy soup with an excellent flavor and will definitely make again.  I made it with following differences. I used the flesh of a fresh pumpkin instead of canned (see below). Also, I didn't have the cumin, or a can of corn, and only used one can of chicken broth to make a thicker soup.

The pumpkin I used was the flesh of one 12 inch pumpkin quartered with seeds and fibers removed and cooked in crock-pot with 1 cup of water for 2 hours. Let cool and spooned out from the outer shell, then pureed in blender. Make about 3 cups. Use all of this in the soup.

Really liked it.  I didn't have fresh cilantro so substituted one tsp of ground coriander seed and two shakes around the pot of curry powder.  So easy to make and so YUM!

Yes, would make again, perhaps adding curry powder.  Used plain greek yogurt to garnish, which really added to the flavor and texture.

Great soup! Took just shy of an hour start to finish.

We added an additional 8 oz of broth as the basic recipe is really thick. Also topped with sour cream instead of whipped cream.

Next time we might use some green pepper and white corn for color.   

Considering adding sweet Italian sausage as well.

This was a great recipe! I also followed previous reviews and added a little more cumin, 1 tsp of curry, a pinvh of cayanne, and about a tsp of fresh ginger. once the onions and peppers had cooked down, I added all the spices, pumpkin, tomato sauce and chicken broth and used and emulsion blender before adding the corn and white beans. Very hearty and flavorful! Yum!

Our whole family loves this recipe...a winter and fall staple at our house.  We always add a dash or two of cinnamon to give it a little more warmth and cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  Delicious!

This was okay, definitely nothing to write home about.   The Pumpkin Black Bean Soup recipe submitted on Allrecipes  by ReedyGal was much better than this...this was rather bland & heavy, but giving it a 3 because it can be made low fat, as the heavy cream was optional.  Sorry Julie... :-{

As written, it was very tasty but lacked depth.  I ended up adding some chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to intensify the smokiness.  Since I was roasting peppers for the main course, I actually roasted the red pepper and removed its skin before adding it to the soup.  Also, a touch of cinnamon really rounded out the flavor profile.  Another tip: throw in the entire cob of corn and let it sit as you simmer.  The corn really sweetens things up.   This was a thick, hearty, chili-like soup.  Thank you, pumpkin gods!!

This is more of a stew, but quite delicious.  I was curious what the pumpkin would do.  It gave a slight squash flavor, but the tomato sauce was the major flavor in the sauce.  My husband doesn't like soups or squash too much actually loved it.  Tasty dish!  I'll certainly make it again.

This soup was SO good.  I changed it a little- using what I had at home.  I used pureed acorn squash instead of pumpkin and pinto beans instead of black beans.  The soup had plenty of good flavor and a great texture.

What a nice change for dinner.  I pureed a pumpkin about 6 weeks ago and needed to use the frozen batch for something yummy.  The family liked it.  I added chopped jalapeño and used green onion instead of regular since we have it in the garden.

A favorite already after two double batches consumed at my house!  Great flavor, and very healthy. Makes a hearty meal. A fifth star to add when the spices are just right. Still could use more.

My grocery store was out of pumpkin so I substituted 12oz frozen pureed squash, added a tablespoon of curry powder, 1 can of diced rotel tomatoes with habanero peppers (because I like it hot) and shredded chicken. Delicious!

I only had green pepper, so used it instead of the red pepper, I added a few mushrooms, and instead of using chicken broth, I used water.  This is a hearty, tasty soup!  Thanks for the recipe!
