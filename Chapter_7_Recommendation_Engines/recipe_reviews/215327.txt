Huge fun for my youngest boy and I to have today while everyone else was out. I used organic bananas, extra-dark chocolate chips and we used both chopped salted peanuts and toasted coconut to roll the bananas. We were able to make these this morning and they were ready to enjoy after Quiet Time. HUGE hit. We loved this.

Cute and creative - not to mention delicious! This reicpe is definitely one for kids of all ages. My niece and I had fun decoating these we used a variety of items including: chopped peanuts, coconut, M&M's, colored sprinkles, and mini marshmallows. These not only look good, but taste good too! Thanks for a great recipe and a fun activity!

What a fun and yummy recipe, not to mention another terrific use for those over ripe bananas. I never would have thought to make these myself ~ one of the reasons I love this site so much. They were easy for the kids to handle and dip in the chocolate themselves, which is great, because when you've 'made' it yourself, it tastes so much better! We dipped, then rolled in chopped peanuts. One tip: take the bananas out of the freezer only one or two at a time to dip. The dipping, rolling (and reheating of the chocolate halfway through) process takes just enough time that half of our bananas had become soft and wet on the outside which meant the chocolate kept sliding off when we went to dip them. Thanks for giving us a fun and nutritious snack recipe for the kids!

Gotta say, I had some major ISSUES when I first tried out this recipes...I went through TWO bags of chocolate chips and they all BURNT. Yes, you can burn chocolate, haha. But after finding some easy fix tips this recipe turned out AMAZING. First off, DO NOT try to melt you chocolate in 30 second intervals- ten secodns intervals is recomended if youre going to use the microwave. Its a pain to stop and go for that long but I promise you, you wont burn your chocolate like I did. Secondly, you can use a double boiler, basically find a pot or soemthing that can withsand boiling water heat and place it ON TOP of your pot of your boiling water- youll have a consistent heart source so your chocolate wont harden as quickly and you dont have to worry about it melting (I highly recomend using the double boiler method!). Last tip! If you find that your chocolate is still hard and isnt having a "melty shine" to it (basically its not very liquidy) slowly add canola oil - about a table spoon each you feel like you need it-to the mixture as you stir. It loosens up the chocolate and makes it much easier to work with and you get the right texture for the chocolate; this works if youre melting your chocolate on a double boiler or in the microwave- add the canaola oil every ten seconds interval for microwaves and whenever you feel lik you need it on the oven. Did a batch of white chocolate bananas and they were DIVINE.

I cut my bananas in thirds instead of half, as I was making these for pre-schoolers.  I went the easy way and bought tubs of microwavable chocolate and therefore did not use the butter.  I dipped mine in red/white/blue sprinkles for a 4th of July cookout celebration at my granddaughter's preschool.  They turned out really cute and were a big hit.  Easy, semi-healthy and fun!  Thanks for sharing the recipe, CRYSTALSHOE!

Interestingly....we didn't like these much.  I had a difficult time getting the chocolate to stick to the frozen banana which made a huge mess.  Not sure what I did wrong, but we didn't like this treat enough to make it again.

I had a package of milk chocolate chips in the house so that is what I used. I did add one T of butter  while melting the chips in a double boiler but my chocolate was still too thick to dip the bananas into it. I then added some half and half to the chocolate and that worked fine. So, although I deviated from the original recipe, and improvised a little, everything still came out fine.  I rolled the bananas in shredded coconut and also in chopped pecans. They look and taste great.  I love the recipe. What a nice treat. Thank You.

thank you so much for this recipe. Made these for a bake sale and sold our fast! I also made some with white chocolate and coconut. I did find using a product like almond bark was much easier than melting chocolate chips.

Mmmm, these bring back lots of memories! My mom made these for us all the time when we were growing up and now I make them for my son. Simple, healthy goodness! I usually don't roll them into anything, but sometimes into sprinkles for the little guy. Everyone always loves these~YUM! :)

We loved these awesome treats! We did have a little bit of a struggle with melting the chocolate, but we just added a few tablespoons of vegetable oil.  These are delicious treats and perfect for a hot day. Thanks so much for sharing it!

Fantastic!  The frozen banana has an ice cream-like consistency to it, combined with the chocolate (we used bittersweet) and oh my goodness, this was amazing.  I'm so glad we made a few extra- although, I don't know if I'll be sharing.

Maybe needs adjustments for high altitude? Rather than melting the chocolate got stiff after just a couple 30 second turns. Turned out like stiff frosting rather than something you could dip. So we frosted instead of dipped.

My kids ages 10- 17 years old all enjoyed making and eating these. The fist time we topped them with crushed peanuts, the second each of them chose different toppings such as sprinkles and crushed pretzel crisp. we had some left over chocolate so they dipped their pretzels.

 I would just strictly advise you do it on the stove top. It's just far too easy to burn the chocolate in the microwave. Also I had 4 kids taking turns so it's better to be able to use low heat to reheat the chocolate after the second child so that it doesn't harden before you are able to apply toppings.

I cut the bananas in approximately 2" pieces and inserted popsicle sticks.  This made them more managable for small children.  We enjoyed them as a small desert or snack.

We did just chocolate covered bananas,  but the kods loved it. And loved that they got to make it. I only wondered if we did something wrong on the chocolate.  We bought Herseys chips and still had to use way more butter to get the chocolate nice and smooth.
Regardless the kids loved them!
