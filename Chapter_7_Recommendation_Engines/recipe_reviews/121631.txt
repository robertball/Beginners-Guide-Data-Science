This recipe was great.  I used cubed sirloin instead of ground beef.  And I used half milk and half beef broth to make it creamier.  I also added garlic and onion for flavor!

I am Very impressed! I DO NOT like stroganoff at all. I made it for my husband who loves it. I added onions, 2 cloves of garlic and 2 cups of fresh mushrooms. I also seasoned it with season salt and paprkia. I must tell you that even though I hate stroganoff, this was AWESOME!

I can see why the contributor wanted this recipe made for her birthday dinner.. this is ultimate comfort food!  Recipe was super easy, fast, and full of flavor.  You would never know the mustard was there, but there would be something missing if omitted.  My family loved this, and I will make this again and again.  I did not alter the recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  Exactly how I make mine from scratch except I boil my meat in the beef broth, instead of cooking it first. (minus the mustard, but I will give it a try!) My family loves this recipe and for my husband I add freshly sauteed mushrooms.  The rest of us don't like mushrooms so I make him some and they get added.  I have a very picky family and they just love it.  Definitely a keeper!  PS - If you don't have a can of beef broth - I use a cup of boiling water and boullion - works just as good!

Very good, QUICK and EASY! I accidently used cream of chicken w/mushroom soup... was worried that it would not be very good, but it was fine! I also had to add about 3/4 can of water so it wouldn't be dry while it simmered a few mins to heat through, again it was fine. My family LOVED IT!!! Great to reheat, just add a bit of milk on reheating to prevent it from being dry. It's a keeper for those nights you need something quick and hearty! Thanks!!!

I hated stroganoff as a youth. As an adult I found this recipe and it has become in heavy rotation at our home. Only changes I make are adding chopped onion to the cooking meat, season the meat with garlic powder and pepper and I add a can of mushrooms to the cooking meat. This recipe has become a comfort food for me!

Excellent recipe!  I made this recipe meatless.  I sautéed diced onion & 2 cloves of garlic in butter first.  I didn’t add any flour. ½ can water and ½ can milk with two beef broth cubes. Dijon mustard (great suggestion from other reviewers!) and Top the Tater sour cream  (chive/onion flavored).  I also added a couple shakes of Tarragon, which I felt really added depth to the recipe.  For anyone worried about the mustard… the mustard taste does stand out a lot, until the sour cream is mixed in.  Then it blends seamlessly.  WONDERFUL!

I thought this was a really good and quick meal.  I did add onions and garlic and add a couple of shakes of season all instead of the salt.  I thought it was very tasty and goes well with a side of mashed potatoes!

Pretty good!! Will make again, but I will add some onion and garlic as another reviewer suggested.  Nice and creamy-just needs a little more flavor from the garlic and onions.

This was a hit in our home and my 5 yr old had seconds...that says it all!  I made a couple modifications:  I sauteed 1/2 medium yellow onion with just under two lbs ground chuck (90/10) and added 3/4 tsp garlic powder with the salt.  I whisked 2 tablespoons beef stock paste with 12 oz hot water instead of bouillon or consomme and mixed with Cream of Mushroom.  I used no flour and let the ingredients boil down, simmering 30 minutes.  I used two cups sour cream and sprinkled 3/4 tsp paprika into sour cream mixture and poured it over 12 oz pkg medium egg noodles, preparing al dente.  I was nervous adding mustard to this dish but ended up adding an additional 1/2 tsp!  Delicious.  This will return to our table!  Thanks for sharing.

So easy and delicious. I added a dash of worschesire to this and a little parpika. Everyone loved it.

*edit 11/13/11- I've made this many times since my first review...and it always comes out so delicious. My father in law asked for the recipe as he gets sick of making just meatballs, sloppy joes, or tacos with ground beef. Sometimes I use a dijon or deli style mustard for kick. Five star all the way!! 
**EDIT 12/24/11  I tried this with ground turkey that was on sale and it also was really good! Love this reciipe.

This is a super easy and quick recipe. I usually stay away from recipes that are use condensed, canned soups because they taste bad. A homemade cream sauce will always taste better than canned Cream of Mushroom soup. However, the addition of the can of Consumee, is what gives this recipe it's flavor, and it tastes pretty good.  I do make one major change however - I use regular pasta instead of egg noodles (I don't care for the egg flavor), and I serve DOUBLE the amount of noodles with the sauce. For our family, the original recipe is way too rich and gloppy as written, boiling 16oz of pasta to go along with the noodles is just right. (I also use ground turkey instead of ground beef). Serve some steamed green vegetables on the side to further cut down on the heaviness/richness of this dish.

My son entered the kitchen, looked in the pot of sauce and exclaimed, "It looks like dog food!" Granted, this was before I added the sour cream, but it give potential makers of this dish an idea of what to expect. The sour cream improved the dish remarkably, but to be honest the sauce was so similar to cream of mushroom soup that it was hard to get down. The taste was just ok... again, it was the texture of the sauce that turned me off. Sorry--not a keeper in my book.

Quick & Easy to make, but tastes just like Hamburger Helper. Had mixed reviews from the family - the 13 yr old loved it, the 10 yr old said it's okay.

4.5, resisted the urge to put in onions and mushrooms but I did put in some minced garlic but NO salt as the soups are salty enough.   Mustard added an interesting touch and we totally enjoyed it!!!  : )

I did make a few changes.  I used beef left over from Christmas dinner.  Also, I had to use cream of celery and fat free sour cream due to my husband's heartburn issues.  Everything else stayed the same.  This turned out really well.  We were both extremely pleased with the final product.  We will definitely be making this again!

I added chopped onions and garlic to the beef. and seasoned it with a bit of paprika, pepper, salt and garlic powder. I also only added a quarter of the flour asked for and let it simmer a bit longer. My boyfriend loved it! It was very creamy. it's great recipe to build on.

I have been looking for a recipe like my mother made, which was a childhood favorite.  This came pretty close, but was a little bland.  The second time I made it, I made the following changes:
-cook 1/2 onion, diced, with the beef
-add 1 teaspoon paprika and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder when adding the soup and consomme
-add 1/4 cup sherry when adding the sour cream (I used fat free)
We liked it much better this way.

a great base recipe.  I left out the mushroom soup and added creamy plain Greek Yogurt, sauteed mushrooms, onions and 1 garlic clove.  S & P to taste.  A good way to use up an inexpensive steak - omit the hamburger, take slightly frozen steak and slice thinkly and saute with mushrooms etc.

I made this because I was looking for something inexpensive & easy that I could make with stuff I had on hand.  It was okay.  I followed several other reviewers recommendations and added onion, garlic, paprika, milk, skipped the sour cream and only added 1 can of condensed soup.  I also used 1/2 lb ground beef, and 1/2 pound chicken sausage.  Overall was okay, tastier than regular old stroganoff but probably won't be part of the regular menu plan.

I liked this recipe. It was a bit too creamy for my taste though. I would not add the whole can of cream of mushroom or sour cream again. I would also make the mustard half a teaspoon. The mustard didn't ruin the recipe it just wasn't for my particular taste. I also did not use all of the flour. I thickened to my tastes. This was a great base recipe for me! I really enjoyed it.

This is soo easy to make and has so much flavor!  I would not change a thing!  I use beef broth because I can never find beef consomme in the store.

This recipe was great, but the sauce was quite thick and I used beef broth rather than consumme (as that was all I had on hand). The taste was fantastic, but I will either use less flour next time or more broth - otherwise, THANKS for a great recipe!

You can definitely taste the mustard flavor in the dish which is why I think it is important to use a good quality mustard. I used whole grain dijon but I bet horseradish sauce or honey mustard would be nice too. It is good with noodles but I also like to serve it over rice.

Super simple and the family loved this dish. I didn't care for the mustard taste, but no one commented so it must have just been me since I knew it was there. This wasn't the best ground beef stroganoff recipe I've used from here but was good enough and I'd make this again. Thanks for a great meal!

Although I hate to use canned soups, I have to say that in a pinch they are necessary, and this recipe is delicious.  I add a few dashes of liquid smoke too and it tastes even better.  I also made my own noodles today using whole wheat flour.  Very yummy.   I have made this stroganoff quite a few times now and my boyfriend loves it.

Great recipe as written!  Have made it several times.  Try using left over meat from a roast and its a delicious alternative to leftovers.

I made this last night for my family.  I have 4 teenagers and usually out of the 4, one or two will love something and the others won't.  For the first time they all loved it!!!   It was so good and very very easy to make.  The only thing I did differently was I didn't use ground beef.  Instead, I used thinly sliced steak.  The meat was very tender and is also probably why my kids loved it!

Delicious! It's very rich and creamy. I had some extra frozen meatballs I needed to get rid of so I used those instead of the beef. It was great, although next time I will try beef, I'm sure it will be even better!

This was fantastic!  Every bit was gobbled up, even by a 4 yr old.  I did think 1/3 c flour was excessive and made it too thick and pasty rather than saucy.  Next time I will decrease the amount of flour.  But the overall flavor was great.  I did chop and sauté 3 large mushrooms to top the dish.  This recipe is an instant family favorite.

Super easy to make, but I didn't like the flavour the mustard added. I would make this again and cut way down on the mustard, or leave it out entirely.

I usually only rate recipes I love but really want to "pan" this one a bit (no pun intended). First, it took MUCH longer than the 30 minutes estimated; closwer to an hour and 15 minutes BEFORE clean up which was huge. Which takes me to issue number two, it makes a huge mess on the stove and in your sink. But if it were delicious I would forgive all this. Sadly, it is not. I followed the recipe exactly and came up with a soupy watery mess, and could not dilute the mustard smell and taste to an acceptable level (and I love mustard. If you still insist on trying this be sure not to add the flour directly to the beef as directed. I did so and stirred it like a maniac, and still ended up with huge lumps of flour that took an extra ten minutes to smash up. I wish I'd not tried it.

This is absolutely delicious!  Easy to make. Great comfort food.  I only had spicy brown mustard on hand, and it turned out great. I added about 2 TBSP of Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef, yum.  I will make more noodles next time though

This is fantastic!!  Super creamy, just like I like it.  Used beef cubes, since that is what my mother used in her crock pot beef stroganoff recipe when I was growing up.  I, of course, added mushrooms.  If it's too creamy for your taste, adding some beef stock or broth will reduce the creaminess.  This is also good with meatballs.

I added a few extra spices to this dish. Onion, garlic, & pepper. I', not a big fan of mustard, and I could taste it, next time I won't use quite so much. It was throughly enjoyed!

I made this recipe as written. My family and I did not like this at all. I found the mustard flavor overpowering and the rest of it bland. My 11 year old took one bite and asked if she could make herself mac and cheese instead. On the up side, this was extremely easy and quick to make. Unfortunately I won't be making this again. Sorry.

Very good meal.  I made this last night for dinner.  I did make some changes.  I added fresh mushrooms, onions, garlic, steak seasoning, and Worstershire sauce.  And I omitted the flour.  It was great...the whole family ate it up.

This was very satisfying, rich, creamy, filling - not to mention easy and cheap! I also sauteed onions and garlic, and added about 3 cups of chopped mushrooms as a substitute for the beef. I left out the flour and salt. My best addition (according to my fiance) was a bunch of cracked pepper. The mustard is really good - gives it a more layered taste. This isn't sophisticated, it's just good old comfort food.

I personally thought this to be bland. My boyfriend and 10 1/2 month old daughter enjoyed it very much though!! Maybe next time I will experiment with some spices.

This recipe was really good. I have to give it a 4 because i couldn't give it a 4.5.  This was extremely easy to make after work one night.  I made the following alterations (browned beef with what ended up being about 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 onion diced, and about 4 cloves of garlic, diced. Added Worcestershire and lots of pepper. I didnt have sour cream, but i think i might not want it.  Added leftover gravy i needed to use (1/2 mushroom, 1/2 regular brown).  Used spicy brown mustard, probably 1 T at least.  I let it simmer quite awhile. Served over buttered white minute rice. My boyfriend is excaiming over it; his first bite was "whoah".  Thank you for this easy and tasty recipe!

Very good dish for busy family, it's quick and easy to make and sooo yummy! A little too much of the sour cream taste at the end so I seasoned it up quite a bit more but maybe that was just me. All in all a great meal!

I use to make this years and years ago and I had forgotten about it. What a pleasant surprise to see the recipe and to make it again. Years ago it was a family favorite. I brought it back to the kitchen table, and it still is a family favorite. Easy, quick and delicious.

I used leftover prime rib instead of ground beef, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious, though very salty! Next time I will not add the salt, and perhaps use low sodium cream of mushroom soup as well.

This is a really good recipe but needed a little tweaking. I left out the mustard and adding 1 tsp. garlic powder and 2 tsp. dried onion (fresh when I have it) for added flavor. I also substitute lean stew meat chunks for ground beef.

Followed the recipe exactly.  This just isn't my thing.  I thought it would be good comfort food and be scrumptious.  It was bland and boring.  Won't be making again.

I don't know why this got such great reviews.  It was bland and bf didn't like the mustard.  We had to put hot sauce in it to make it taste good enough to eat. Would not make again. Sorry. BF said it was ok but he threw the leftovers out (which were a lot, this makes a ton!)

I used ground turkey instead of beef, lite sour cream, beef broth, and added mushrooms. Still, the final product was a bit rich for my tastes. Perhaps less flour would have been the answer. Or just a little more water. Would definitely make it again!

I wish I could get my kids out of the rut of wanting it "the way you usually make it mom". The mustard threw everyone off. I will leave it out next time. Added minced onion & garlic. I liked it but the mustard also turned it a strange color that the rest of the family couldn't get past.

This recipe was a huge hit! I used left-over roast and the juices from that roast instead of the ground beef. It was great, though I would not be opposed to trying it with ground beef for a quick meal.

I was in need of something I could make for dinner tonight without spending any money. I tried this. Thank you for such a great, easy, and cheap recipe. I did add 1/2 of an onion and some garlic powder when I was browning the meat. I also added some worcestershire sauce, parsley, paprika, chili powder and some Montreal Steak seasoning. We love cheese, so I added a cup of shredded cheese, and then topped with another cup of cheese. I didn't have egg noodles so I used macaroni. I served this with french cut green beans, and enjoyed mixing them in with the stroganoff, and next time I think I will add the beans, or maybe even some peas right to the stroganoff. If I'd had some on hand, I would have also added a can of mushrooms. I can see black olives going very well with this, and will try that next time. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because it was a little thick for my taste even before adding the cheese. My texture sensitive 6 year old had a hard time eating his required 6 bites. I'm not sure the flour was necessary, and will omit it next time, and will probably add at least 1/2 soup can of milk or perhaps more broth.

This was quite nice.  I used a can of regular mushroom soup (I can't find condensed here) and added a tad more flour.  I also substituted french onion soup for the beef consomme.  Tossed in a can of mushrooms and an onion, and it was great!

I made this exactly as recipe called for- and it turned out delicious.  The only issue I had was the sour cream didnt quite mix in well- mine was organic and low fat which defintley may have been the problem.  It still turned out delicious and my boyfriend and I loved it.

This was very easy and delicious.  I used left over steak from the freezer, rather than ground beef.  I sliced it thin and cooked it in the pan with the garlic, onions, etc.  I also added some tarragon (1/2 tsp or so), cayenne pepper, and a splash of Worcestershire sauce. It was very simple and very tasty, even with the mustard.  I was hesitant to add it, but it really adds depth.  Thanks!

It was an alright recipe. It was definitely quick and easy to make with ingredients I had around the house.

However, it needed sauted onion and garlic, first and foremost, together with sauted fresh mushrooms. I would put half the mustard in, maybe 1/4 and add part consumme and part cream.

Other than that, a great easy dinner recipe!

Made it last night for dinner. It was quick, easy, and even my 5 year old wanted seconds.  I didn't change anything to this recipe, and couldn't find anything wrong that I would change.  I will make it again.

Quick and easy.  I added additional fresh mushrooms, cooked lean beef with worcestershire sauce in lieu of salt and used reduced fat sour cream.  Still very creamy and very tasty.

Great flavor.  I used thinly sliced London Broil and browned it in butter and garlic.  Simmered with remaining ingredients for one hour adding sour cream at the end.  Perfect.

Fantastic and easy!  I followed to the letter and agree with others that the mustard seems out of place as you read this, but it gives it a great kick! 
The whole family loved it!

This was a great quick and easy meal! I followed the directions exactly, except I added some diced onion to the ground beef while it was cooking and I added a jar of mushrooms when I added the soups. Everyone liked it. Delish!

Yummy! Very easy to put together in a hurry. I had everything in my pantry/fridge already.(Love when that happens!) I did add some sauteed onion, garic salt, and a small can of mushrooms. I subbed bow tie pasta for the noodles. Thanks!

This was good and different, but not as good as my old standard recipe. I did like the addition of mustard--it added a nice rich flavor. I used ground turkey, so I didn't add as much flour since there was no fat. I added healthy request mushroom soup and light sour cream so it was healthier than my usual recipe! Thanks for a nice change Melissa.
