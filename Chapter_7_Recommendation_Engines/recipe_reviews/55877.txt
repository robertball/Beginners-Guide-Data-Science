This was, as the name suggests, very easy to make, and very tasty too!  I didn't have all the spices on hand and made some substitutions, but I think many combinations would work well, and one could play with the ingredients to make an italian version, mexican version, etc.  Most tempeh recipes are based on very strong sauces, so it's nice to find one that doesn't try to disguise the main ingredient.

This was quite good, not overpowering. I would suggest something super easy (this will be almost FAST FOOD). I found that all of these spices are in "Simply Organic Chicken Seasoning." Being vegan we wouldn't have looked at that jar, but we now use it ALL the time.

This was very easy to make and even my 3 year old loved it! The only thing I would do differently is cut the salt in half. It was too salty for our taste.

Excellent tempeh recipe. Why didn't I ever think to put nutritional yeast on my tempeh before? That was a great idea even if you change the other spices in the recipe. I also added some soy sauce for an extra kick!

So good!  I actually didn't have dried chives or coriander but it was excellent anyway.  My 16 month-old is gobbling it up like candy.  WIll definitely add this to my permanent collection.  Thanks for a great new way to cook tempeh!

This was OK. I found it to be rather dry, even after adding extra oil like the other reviews said.

The yeast is a great idea! This is a wonderful base recipe-I will try different variations of herbs with this for many different meals. Thanks!

Super tasty/savory! I substituted dried marjoram for fresh, and dried sage instead of chives. Great as appetizers too.
I agree with another reviewer, halve the salt, easy to add later if preferred.

I did not care for this. Maybe I made it wrong or maybe, after several attempts, I just don't like tempeh.

For some reason this came out extremely dry for me.  I will try it one more time, perhaps with more oil?

I doubled the recipe (and that gave me 4 servings). I mixed the dry spices in a bowl and then added the cut tempeh and oil to a gallon size plastic bag and shook it to mix all of the ingredients. This came out great and I will definitely make this again.

This was much too salty. I'll try again with half the amount of salt suggested.

Omitted marjoram because store had neither fresh nor dried.  Had to add more oil to get spices to stick to tempeh.  Final product was not to my husband's taste, but son said it was ok, and I polished off most of a batch as an accompaniment to a baguette.  I will make this again even if I am the only one eating it.

This is very good. I added hot pepper flakes and a tablespoon of minced onion instead of chives. Fast,  easy and crispy. I will make this again.
