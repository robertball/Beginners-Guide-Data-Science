This drink screams spring to me.  Yesterday was our first warm day of 2013 and I made this while preparing dinner.  It was refreshing and delicious.  The only change I made was no Triple Sec because we don't have any.  This will be a repeater at our house.  I did find I prefer it was a bit more Diet 7-Up.  CHEERS, STINKYKG!
