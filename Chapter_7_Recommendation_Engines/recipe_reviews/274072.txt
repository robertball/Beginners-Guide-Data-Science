I cooked this in my instant pot. I heated the oil, sautéed the meat, afterwards added the beef broth, and curry paste. I cooked it on high pressure for 10 minutes, did a quick release on the pressure. Then added the remaining ingredients. Cooked for an additional 5 minutes on high pressure. The cooking method was the only thing changed, which I don’t believe compromised the outcome. I was expecting this to be more flavorful, but was disappointed as it was lacking in flavor.
I think it needs some garlic and some more pop of color.
