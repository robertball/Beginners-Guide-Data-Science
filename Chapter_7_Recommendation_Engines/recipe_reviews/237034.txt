This was a wonderful recipe, so much better than the plain bread pudding recipes I've tried.  I can't say that I would change anything, it was perfect when followed the  exact recipe.

Mine didn't turn out as great as I'd hoped it would; the custard never formed. :-( Maybe someone can help me figure out where I went wrong? I used soft wheat bread, would that make that big of a difference?

Instead of berries I just added another 16 oz of peaches and kept everything else to the recipe, next time Iâ€™m going to use apples instead because the spices would work really well for that.

I made a few adjustments after  reading previous reviews. Used 4 cups stale bread and added a dash of cardamom. If I had cooked it a wee bit longer, it would have been PERFECT, but that's my own fault. Great basic recipe!

It was okay. Not the best ever. We did eat it, but the younger kids in particular weren't fans. Maybe I overcooked it or something. Other bread puddings I've made in the past have been better.

Seemed overly soggy. Followed directions. It had good flavor.
