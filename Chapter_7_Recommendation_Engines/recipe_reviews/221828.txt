Pretty good if only i didn't add as much salt as it says. But i added more tomato to reduce the saltiness.

This has WAY WAY WAY too much salt as written.

I significantly reduced the amount of salt, and it was very good. Maybe 1 to 1 1/2 tsp is good. In any case, don't just put 2 Tbsp in there like the recipe says, start small and start it to taste.

So good! I took the liberty of pureeing everything and using twice the paneer! I thought the spinach was skimpy, so I added a pound of frozen spinach to my Vitamix, then threw it back in my pan to heat up again. I then added more Indian dried red chili I had in the cupboard. Extra cumin and only salting to taste at the end and serving over Jasmine rice made for a perfect lunch with leftovers.

This is a great fresh tasting and quick palak paneer.  The recipe calls for too much salt, though!  I think they meant teaspoons and wrote tablespoons.  

I keep paneer around to go in the microwavable pouches of saag paneer for school lunch.  I had all the other ingredients in my pantry, so when confronted with a "oh, man, what's for lunch?"  I made this for my kids.  They loved it.  I loved it.  It's worth trying.

This recipe doesn't have as much spinach as the local E. Indian restaurants put in their dishes, but it was still good.
