The olive oil and lemon added just enough flavor.
The broiled lemon was an excellent idea.

Made this last night and it was so simple to make.  I did not have fresh lemon so I added California Lemon Peel (McCormick) in the seasonig mix along with some Zesty Lemon (Weber).  Before baking I sprinkled additional Lemon Peel on top.  We had Mackerel steaks (instead of fillet) so cooking time was a bit longer and I did flip the steaks for an additional 5 minutes to complete cooking throughout.  
They came out moist & flaky and very delicious.

4.5 stars!!!  Delicious!  The perfect amount of seasoning - you could still enjoy the flavor of the fish.

This was very tasty.  The lemon and the paprika work very well with Spanish Mackerel.  My only problem was that I could not get the fish to cook completely under the lemon.  I ended up microwaving the fish, in 30 second intervals, for about a minute to complete the cooking after I had broiled it for about 7 minutes.  Because of this, I am only giving it 4 stars.

I used lemon juice (since I had it on hand) rather than lemon slices, and added a bit of chilli.

I was a little worried that this recipe would add too many strong flavours and would overwhelm the naturally strong taste of the fish, but it was just right: didn't try to mask the fishiness, but added some complimentary tastes. I broiled the fish for 6 minutes and it came out perfect! 

Served with (among other things) plain rice and the flavour of the fish was really taken up by the rice perfectly.

Fresh caught... Like we caught them today. Made my first batch just now. Love it!! I may did add Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper instead of salt & pepper. I do not add salt to my dishes. I think it may also be good with Panko to crisp the top up. What does everyone think?

We caught King Mackerel while deep sea fishing in Key West, Florida.  We kept plenty of filets, went back to the condo and used this recipe.  Absolutely amazing!  This is a five-star restaurant experience at home.  Thanks you very much!!  Joseph F. Lahue

This is my first time I try the recipe and mackerel. This was good. It was very easy and quick to make. I served it with a side of Byrdhouse blistered tomatoes from this site. It is a great combo! I used coarse salt and it came out perfect. Now as is I think it is good, but I would like to know if adding a bit of minced garlic would make this recipe even better. I love how fast it is. Dinner in NO TIME hands down. Add also crusty bread and there you have it!

I did not use oil at all and did not missed it. Used plain and smoked paprika. Loved it.

Super easy and delicious. Make sure you have fresh mackerel. We used smoked paprika for a little more favor.

Thanks for the recipe! This is a nice way to prepare mackerel.
I've had decent results substituting Old Bay seasoning for paprika.
