My wife and I had 10 couples over for desert on New Years Eve. We decided we wanted to make this recipe after reviewing it.. are we glad we did. All I can say is this, they kept going back to the server for more. I made a double batch and by the end of the evening it was gone. Thank you Jeannie for a great desert recipe; it is very easy to make and extremely tasty. It is being passed on to all of our family members by request.

Loved the fruit in it but be sure to tuck them into the slices of bread or they get burned.  I'd also cover it with foil next time so that the tops of the bread pieces don't get burnt.

Tonight, I made three bread pudding recipes (I had alot of left over hot dog and hamburger buns after a cookout). This recipes wins hands down over Grandmother's Bread Pudding and Bread Pudding with Whiskey Sauce III. 

The bread pudding alone is very flavorful. The addition of the sauce makes a great recipe even more decadent. I only made a couple of changes: I used fresh strawberries and a cup of frozen mixed berries (blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries). I also substituted buttermilk and heavy cream for about 3 of the 6 cups of the whole milk--I needed to use these items before they went bad. 

Update: I sent my husband with a batch to take to work and I took one to my place of employment. We both received comments stating that this was the best bread pudding EVER! 

Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Bread pudding is my weakness, so I'm always on the lookout for a new recipe, especially one that doesn't require tons of butter or heavy cream.  Instead of using butter to grease the pan, I sprayed 4 ramekins (halved the recipe) with cooking spray, used an egg substitute for the eggs and f/f half & half for the whole milk.  Baking the dish (or ramekins) in a water bath helps to eliminate a soggy center, as some reviewers experienced.  The spices complimented the fresh berries perfectly -- will make this again.  Thanks!

I made this for dessert last night and everyone loved it, even my husband who claims he hates any bread pudding.  I followed the recipe exactly except the cooking time, I had to add an extra 30 minutes and I didn't have very many blackberries so I added a few blueberries, also I added pecans.  I've made several different bread puddings and this is one of my new favorites.  The mix of the berries and the brown sugar sauce is great.  It tastes even better the next day!  Make sure that you use a good french bread and that it's definately stale, trust me it makes a difference.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm not a fan of bread pudding but this was delicious! I used 2 cups of strawberries and no blackberries  since  I didn't have any on hand. Also I used 2% milk mixed with half & half and evaporated milk since that's what I had. It still worked and will make it again.

I've made several fruity bread puddings before.  This one is a really good combination of spices and fruit.  It's sweet and tasty enough without the sauce.  I usually just let the bread soak about 5-10 minutes, then add the fruit, making sure none are on the surface.

Wonderful flavor! Couldn't get fresh berries so I used 16 oz. frozen blueberries (the nice big ones)thawed and well drained. They worked perfectly! Would look for a more dense bread next time-I used a so so french loaf. Also used fresh grated nutmeg instead of the pie spice. This recipe is a real keeper!!

This was a big hit with all my guests!  Gooey, sweet and delicious.  I used unsweetened frozen blueberries and strawberries and it was really yummy.

Great recipe...though I changed it a bit to be more figure friendly.  I used skim milk, only (1) cup of splenda, egg beaters, and whole wheat french bread. I added some nutmeg as well.  I used blueberries and rasberries along with the strawberries and blackberries (which was delicious!!).  I also didn't make the sauce as the pudding was sweet enough already.  I cooked in a glass dish and had to cook it for about an 1hr 30min rather than the stated 45-50 min, or it would have been really soggy. I put foil over the top for the last 30 minutes so the top didn't burn. I also made sure and tucked all my fruit under the bread so it wouldn't burn as stated by other reviewers.  Bread pudding is my FAVORITE dessert and I have to say that this was among the best I have eaten.

I found this recipes a few years ago and forgot to review it. I was surprised that it did not have more reviews. This recipe is delicious! I did not have enough french bread so I used half french and half croissant. I also used the frozen berry mix from Costo and added 1 cup more - fabulous!! I also used cream cheese, confectioners sugar, vanilla and brandy for the sauce - Wow! I have also used Agave Syrup in place of some of the sugar. Great Recipe! Give it a try. Thanks Jeannie for the awesome recipe!

This was my first attempt at any bread pudding recipe and I thought it turned out pretty good! I used frozen strawberries & blueberries. I think next time I will put the fruit under a layer of bread.  As it baked, the blue berries on top dried out a bit too much.   I don't think the brown sugar sauce was worth the time or calaries.  The bread pudding has enough flavor to stand on its own.

This turned out wonderful! I'm not real familiar with bread pudding and this was probably my third attempt at this type of dish. I was unsure as how long I should bake it. After 45 min. it didn't look done and center wasn't even near set. I ended up adding another 45 min. to the baking time. During that time I also made sure berries were tucked down into the bread so as not to burn. The end result was a fabulous mixture of gooey and crispy! The sauce topping was wonderful. Three things I did differently was used margarine instead of butter to grease baking dish, three layers of regular white store bought bread, and used about 3 cups black berries. No strawberries. My husband loved it. (And didn't want to share.)

This was wonderful, even though I made substituted frozen blueberries.  It cooked a lot longer than recommended, but I think that was because I just kind of used what I had on hand as far as 'dry bread' instead of following the recipe exactly.  Next time I think I'll make it in two 8 X 8 dishes.  It had a wonderful texture and the sauce was delicious.

The bread pudding part deserves five stars.  Perfect texture and flavor.  I took it to a dinner party and everyone agreed the sauce was not the right flavor for the pudding.  It was fine, but definetly missed that wow factor you get in fine restaurants.  I think I will try it with a carmel sauce or vanilla sauce next time.  Thanks for the bread pudding, it was yummy!

YUM!  I made this tonight.  It is the first time that I made bread pudding.  It was SO good!  I used leftover Italian bread from a pasta dinner earlier in the week.  The berries made it feel a bit more summery than what I usually think of when I think of bread pudding.  I will definitely make this again!

it tasted great and was easy to make.  it turned out too moist inside for me, so I would cut down a little on the milk and egg mixture next time.  I would also cut the sauce in half, because it was very sweet and would have totally drowned the pudding if I had put it all on.

This was my first attempt at bread pudding and it turned out amazing. I used a vanilla bean instead of extract. I scraped the inside of the bean and put it in the milk along with the vanilla pod and let it soak for a few hours. Removed the pod before making the egg mixture. I used all blackberries and it was great. Definitely, DEFINITELY make the brown sugar sauce, even just the littlest drizzle over the top makes the dessert even more amazing. I loved this so much I made it twice in one week.

egg mixture makes a nice custard.  i added more fruit than listed and mixed layered it with the bread in addition to having it on top. otherwise, the fruit only on the top will shrivel up and you will need much more to have the fruity taste as well.  overall, very good. the sauce makes it.

I used a different bread pudding recipe and was looking for a yummy sauce. This brown sugar sauce was easy to make and delicious! It was the perfect sauce for the bread pudding! I can't wait to make the Berry Bread Pudding and use the sauce!
I did add some cream to the sauce at the end to make it creamier. 

Wonderful recipe!

I did not find this bread pudding to be flavorful. I can't figure out what it was lacking, but it just wasn't quite right for me.

This was really good and I was prepared to NOT LIKE it.  I am seriously attached to my mom's bread pudding recipe but this was a great alternative. The berries add just the right amount of flavor punch to tie everything together.  It is a very wet bread pudding so if you like yours on the drier side add lots of bread.

Wow, this is a great recipe.  I don't have great luck making sauces turn out right, so I was worried about this one, for sure.  But it came out perfectly.  And was a compliment to the pudding.  The pudding is just like it should be.  Crispy on top, mushy inside.  The berries are a great addition.  My husband who doesn't like desserts much really liked it.  It's rich, though.  Not for the faint of heart.  I followed the recipe exactly (minus a cup of milk because I was worried about it all fitting in the mixing bowl) and it turned out great.  Highly recommend this one.

WOW I can't believe people said too mushy, this was fantastic.  I made sure the bread was 4 days old and measured only according to what the bread needed to soak up.  My whole family loved it.  Would do again!

This was wonderful! My french bread was probably not stale enough so I had to cook it a little longer, but it turned out great. The sauce added a lot of calories and was rather sweet. The pudding stood up well on it's own, so I don't think I'll make the sauce next time (though it is very yummy.) I served it for a family dinner and my son & daughter-in-law both gave it a 10. Thanks!

Oh my gosh this was good.  I made it with blueberries.  At first I thought I should have made only half a recipe, but we all loved it so much I'm glad I have the whole pan full.  Just wonderful for a cold winter night at home.  I served it with some vanilla frozen yogurt and yum!

I've never made a bread pudding before. This was so easy and tasted sinfully wonderful! I toasted my slices of French bread in the oven first to ensure they were plenty "stale" enough. I divided the recipe into two small dishes so I could take one to a relative. Based on other reviews I made sure all of my fruit(I used raspberries, blackberries and blueberries) was tucked inside and under the bread. I didn't have any problem with burned fruit. The cooking time was way off though. At least am hour and a half at a half at a minimum. Thank you for a delicious recipe!!!

The only reason I'm giving this a "four" is because I did not make the bread pudding, only used the brown sugar sauce on another bread pudding recipe - it was yummy!  I will try the whole recipe in the future, though, because it sure sounds good.

REALLY Yummy, ate it for days.  THe only change I made was to pour melted butter over the bread.  I also added some chopped nuts on top.  I wasn't crazy about the sauce, but it went well with it.  Maybe a caramel sauce would be better.  Either way it was delicious.

This is a wonderful bread pudding recipe!  I really love the richness of the berries & cinnamon together!
I have varied the berries with whatever variety I have on hand, & they all have been great!  Finally!  A bread pudding worth making more than once!

The bread pudding itself is a little bit too soggy, even after I baked it for 60 minutes. It tastes great, although without the sauce, it's not sweet enough. However, the sauce turned bad after a day since it's butter-based.

I am really not sure where I went wrong.  I am not having much luck with making bread pudding.  I cooked this almost double the time specified and it was still a soggy mess.  I will try again b/c the part that was cooked was really good.

I made this for a dinner party at my house and everyone was so impressed (and it was really easy)!  I used frozen strawberries and fresh blackberries - yum!  The sauce was a nice touch, but we didn't even really need it.  Thanks Jeannie for a great recipe!

Made this for the whole family, kids and all.  It looked strange to the younger ones (you know, too many things going on) but served this to the adults.  Well everyone loved it and I noticed halfway thru the evening the younger ones had served themselves and loved it!  This is the most delicious bread pudding I've ever had.
