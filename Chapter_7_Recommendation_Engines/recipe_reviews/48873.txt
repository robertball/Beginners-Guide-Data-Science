Extremely quick and easy to make. I added about one half teaspoon of cornstarch to help thicken the sauce. Next time I think I'll add a little garlic mushrooms or onions to the mix. Kids liked it. Husband liked it. I liked it but thought it could be even better with a little extra spices. Served it with angel hair pasta tossed with butter and pepper french bread as suggested steamed mixed vegetables and a fresh tossed salad. I will definately make this dish again.

I had to give this four stars for the original recipe.. BUT After taking the advice of some of the reviewers and adding garlic seasoned salt and Mrs.Dash to the chicken while it cooked... YUMMY!!!!! I will make this again with those changes. Make sure you buy crusty bread to dip in the sauce.

As with other reviews I would say this is an EXCELLENT base recipe. I have made this a ton for my very picky family. To make everyone happy I've slowly altered it from the original recipe. To start I thicken up the sauce as well as add a ton of much-needed flavor by adding a can of garlic-seasoned cream of mushroom soup to the creme before adding the chicken. I also season the chicken with garlic poweder. I have added various vegetables -depending on my mood. This is a definate picky eater pleaser.

This was by far the best chicken I have ever had! And to make it even better it was so fast and simple! I ate it with some Uncle Ben's flavorful rice and a side of green beans. I still dream of that meal. I will make this recipe again as soon as I can.

This was REALLY good! Much better than it sounds. It sounded a little plain so I added sliced black olives and some leftover corn and served it over brown rice. Real comfort food! Will definitely make this again!

This was incredibly delicious for something so quick and simple! I used two smaller chicken breasts instead of the tenderloins and I added a bit of parmesan cheese and some garlic powder to the cream. I served the sauce over the chicken on a bed of brown rice and broccoli - it was delicious! My husband and I all but licked our plates clean. If you're serving more than two or three people I'd suggest doubling the sauce. Yes it's that yummy.:-) Thanks Patty!

Oh my arteries! We loved this. I did use seasoned salt and added garlic powder to the chicken and because we're mushroom fanatics I sauteed some of those before adding the cream. Actually I used half and half because that's what I had but if you simmer it long enough it will thicken the same without needing cornstarch. The chicken just melted in our mouths and my husband was happy I'm supporting his low-carb diet! Thanks for the great recipe.

wonderful recipe even our 4 girls loved it I will make this again soon. Just a hint to those reading this, dont be to quick with the corn starch, as with all cream products it will thicken as the water evaporates out of it just be patient and dont stir to much.

The recipe as written is divine and perfect for a low-carb diet. The second time I made it I sauteed onion and a little celery with it and garlic powder. Then with the cream I added a half-shot of good bourbon whiskey. DIVINE! Restaurant-quality!

I found that this recipe wasn't quite buttery enough so I added another 1/4 to 1/2 cup of butter and some Parmesan or mozzarella cheese to taste. I also added broccoli to make it appear like it is healthy. Overall I loved this recipe!

This is an excellent quick and easy recipe. I added about a tsp each of onion and garlic powder and the flavor was wonderful. I also added in some mushrooms to saute with the chicken and threw in some broccoli at the very end. Definitely not low fat but very very tasty. Thanks!

Fantastic! I followed the recipe except used whipping cream instead of heavy cream because that is what I had. Worked great. I simmered the cream a little longer to get it thick. I took the chicken out early to not overcook it while I finished simmering the cream - delicious! I served it over noodles to the kids and my husband and I ate it without the noodles (we are doing low carb). It was great and the whole family liked it. Keeper - thanks!

I was skeptical; it sounded bland. The rave reviews and being on Atkin's made me try it. Really delicious. I cut the chicken into tiny pieces and browned some garlic in the butter before throwing in the chicken.

This was good. A little too heavy for me but my husband loved it. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and thickened it with cornstarch. I also used chicken breasts and cut them into small chunks. Next time I'll brown the chicken in less butter or a little bit of olive oil instead of the amount of butter called for. The chicken just boiled in the butter instead of actually browning. I seasoned the chicken with seasoned salt and some pepper and served it over rice.

This recipe was excellent. I did some modification after reading several other reviews. I used boneless chicken breast cutting them into large nuggets instead of strips. In addition to seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper I also seasoned the raw chicken with lawry season salt(this really enhances the flavor of the chicken. I added one tablespoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce. I served a baked potatoe and fried green beans for my side dishes(there is an exellent recipe for "fried green beans on the "allrecipe.com" site.) The french bread was great no need to toast. For a simple quick meal this recipe rocks.

As written I can only give this recipe three stars. Without the "extras" that I added this sauce would be nothing short of flavorless. For added flavor I used the chicken thigh instead of the breast. At the first step while heating the diced chicken I included some shallot and garlic. After adding the cream and heating through I seasoned it up with kosher salt and black pepper. It still needed something so I added some red pepper; it gave it a nice kick. In the end the sauce was very good sponged up by the bread.

Wow this was great! I make a similar dish with white wine and rosemary but now I know that I don't have to have wine on hand to make an impressive quick meal. The only changes I made were to butterfly the breasts and pound them thin and I added quartered mushrooms and seasoned the chicken with Mrs Dash table blend. Served over spagetti squash with a ceaser salad...there was not a drop left over!!

I love this recipe! It's easy & tasty. I always add fresh sliced portabella mushrooms & onions quartered (I prefer Vidalia or sweet).I would add a 1/4 cup of white wine but my husband dosen't like it. French bread is a must with this recipe for sopping up all the wonderful creamy sauce!!

It was okay not fabulous. Kinda bland although the sauce was very good w/ bread. I added garlic to the butter onion powder and yet the chicken was still so-so. I'm giving it 4 stars because of how easy and fast this dish was and I will make it again but will work on making the chicken better.

I added chopped onion to the butter in the beginning and then I added garlic powder to the chicken. When I added the chicken to the pan I added thinly sliced mushrooms. I followed the rest of the recipe and tasted the sauce periodically adding salt and pepper to taste. The sauce came out amazing. It was a quick and easy meal that was extremely satisfying. You definitely need bread to mop up every last bit of this delicious sauce. Thanks for the recipe! I will be making this again.

very nice recipe but I did alter it. As it is it's bland for my taste. I cooked the chicken in an olive oil/butter mix and added about half an onion. I seasoned the chicken with salt pepper & a tsp of onion powder. I added minced garlic just before I added the heavy cream. To the heavy cream I added about a quarter cup of Romano cheese (you could easily use peccarino or Parmesan cheese)To thicken I added about a tsp of corn starch. Served over mixed steamed veggies with lots of sauce.

Yummy!!! I did add garlic and vidalia onion when browning the chicken and the flavor with the cream was just fantastic! When my partner came home for dinner his first comment was "what is that awesome smell?" We love this stuff and the bread to soak it all up is better than dessert!

Good but not amazing. I think the dish needs a little more flavor. I added garlic powder but I think in the future I would saute some garlic and maybe onion with the chicken. Also the sauce never really thickened too much for me. I don't know if I didn't cook it long enough but it was quite thin. Still good though I'll just have to tinker with it next time.

I thought this recipe was great! I added a bit of lemon juice and mushrooms to jazz it up a bit. Will certainly make this again it was a hit over fettuccini noodles.

Great recipe! I also use skinned boneless chicken breasts pounded thin and then cut into about three strips per breast. I then dredge each strip in seasoned flour and sautee about three minutes on both sides in real butter for about three minutes per side or until golden. I then add the cream scrape the bottom of the pan and then gently simmer for as long as 20 minutes. The flour and additional time thicken the cream perfectly. I serve the chicken with rice and broccoli. Super comfort food!

I love this recipe. I have made it several times because it is so simple and flavorful. My kids like this served over rice/noodles. I like it with crusty french bread. I have added a can of sliced mushrooms to it at times just to change it up. Definitely a keeper.

Good recipe. Because some of the reviews said that it was bland I added mushrooms bell-peppers and hot sauce (I didn't have fresh jalapenos otherwise I would have used that). I served it with french bread and rice. My husband really enjoyed it.

This was GREAT. it was very easy to prepare. I also added in garlic and onion and think that next time i will add more spices. The sauce was thin but still delicious and made the right amount to finish with the chicken and bread. I will definitely make this again.

I made this last night using a pint of whipping cream as another reviewer had said it came out fine. It was pretty bland even though I added garlic and onion to the chicken tenderloins as I sauteed them. My son tried some and suggested I add some cheese to the remainder so I threw in about 3/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar. What a difference. Much better with the cheese. I served this over angel hair and had french bread for dipping.

Overall this recipe was good. I did have to follow the advice of others and added garlic and pepper flakes to the chicken. This was absolutely necessary for flavor which is why I only gave a rating of 4 stars. I will make this again with the adjustments.

This was really really good. It is a very rich dish but that was exactly what I was looking for tonight. Added a chopped shallot and minced a clove of garlic and doubled the sauce. Served over Rice with Herbes de Provence (from this site) and it was a perfect dinner that was on the table from start to finish in 25 minutes. I will make this often. Thank you for sharing!!

This was good. I would probably prepare this again. I actually ate it over rice but would have preferred it over pasta! Lots and lots of butter is in this recipe so It probably wont be something that I prepare too often due to health reasons. but overall good.

the butter took forever to cook the chicken in and immediately started burning faster than i could save it when it finally did start. might be ok with oil but it ruined the dish.

KETO friendly !!! This is a GREAT EASY base. I have made this as is and with added ingredients. It is good either way. You do not need to add cornstarch. It will eventually thicken. Just give it time. The batch I am currently making has sautéed onion and capers in it. I will also be adding shredded Parmesan to it. Put whatever spices and additions in it that you have in yr fridge. Olives,onion,corn, mushrooms ...whatever YOU like. It will all work out and be good.

This is an excellent starter recipe. I dredged the chicken in seasoned flour and let it absorb most of the butter while cooking. I added a can of mushrooms several cloves of garlic and a can of cream of mushroom soup. Served on top of buttered angel hair pasta with a side of garlicy green beans and of course French bread. Very fattening and oh so yummy!
