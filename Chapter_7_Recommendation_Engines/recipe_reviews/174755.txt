If you are searching for recipes for this type of chowder, STOP RIGHT HERE.  Just reading the recipe with a "chef's eye" you can tell this is far superior to the other ones posted on this site.  i don't give out many 5 star ratings, but this is most definitely one of them.  i was searching for a crab/corn chowder recipe because my husband and i enjoy Bonefish Grill's version so much, but it is pricey - $6.50 for a bowl.  I searched the internet for a bonefish grill copycat chowder recipe, no luck. Came on reliable all recipes, and I was just hoping this chowder would taste good, as it seemed like it would - but it tasted IDENTICAL to bonefish grills (if you are the author reading this, please take this as a compliment!)   The changes I made were as follows:  omitted celery and the shrimp (personal preference). no clarified butter - didnt have time - just used a regular tablespoon of butter, worked fine.  Cajun seasoning instead of Creole (I'm sure its next to the same thing).  and canned golden corn and canned jumbo lump crab instead of fresh.   It was, ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.  Try this, I promise you won't be disappointed.   (unless you don't like spicy - it does pack a little heat! ;)

Normally I try to stay true to the original person’s recipe unless the masses have agreed to some changes but I had to re-work this recipe for 3 reasons.  #1.  Everybody who is eating my chowder agreed that the Bonefish grill was WAY too spicey (in ALL their dishes, not just the chowder).  I’m a spice light-weight, and my wife is a total spice wuss so I just couldn’t make it as-is based on the other reviews.  #2. I don’t have the alcohol required in my house (I’m more of a Jim Beam kinda guy) and it’s Sunday in PA and I can’t buy it.  I don’t think I’ll bother next time either since it doesn’t call for much so I would be wasting it.  #3. Corn is now out of season and the only small shrimp I liked at the market was cooked/pieces so I went for it – and crab around here sucks right now.  So here is the Spice Wuss/Alcohol Free/Out of Season Variation:  I replaced the cayenne with double the amount of Old Bay and dropped Creole seasoning completely.  I replaced the white wine with pure motts apple juice and the brandy with apple cider vinegar.  I used a 1 lb bag of frozen white corn/yellow corn mix partly thawed in the fridge.  Since my shrimp was cooked I left it out until the potatoes were cooked then tossed them in and let it come back up to a simmer then added the crab meat (which was canned chicken of the sea premium crab meat..all real crab).  I then left the whole thing on the stove on warm until dinner time (about an hour) so by then everything was a perfect temperature.

This recipe is superb! Like the 1st reviewer, I was looking to duplicate Bonefish Grill's chowder and I am very happy with the results! I omitted he cayenne pepper since I didn't have any- the creole seasoning added just enough heat.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

So... this recipe isn't cheap to make if you follow exactly and the prep time is way off (takes twice as long).  I'm sorry but I really wanted to rate this well based on the previous reviews.  I have been to Anthony's and Duke's (fine seafood restaurants) and they have had a corn, crab and bourbon bisque that is to die for and is very similar to each other.  I have been searching and thought this recipe was similar.  I followed this recipe EXACTLY and it ended up VERY bland.  I didn't want to waste so much money with the crab, shrimp, etc. that I ended up going back to the store just to liven it up.  I added more shrimp, creole, brandy, wine and even after all that, it still seemed bland that I put in a tablespoon of vanilla.  After all that, it only tasted fair.  I'm sorry but this is not worth the time and money (at least for me). :( I will keep searching.

Prep time is way more than 35 minutes, however well worth it.  This recipe filled a large crockpot.  I made the soup and let it cook on low all day in the crockpot.  After letting it sit in the fridge all night, I let it cook one more day on low until we enjoyed it that evening.  I think soups are much better after they have had time to marinate.  Instead of small size shrimp, I used petite shrimp for salad or shrimp salad.    This soup is delicious and definately worth making. I am from Maryland and love cream of crab soup.  This is a lot more than just corn and crab soup.

Great recipe!  There is a little local eatery here on the Outer Banks that has the best corn and crab chowder that we've ever eaten.  This recipe may be better!  If you want to carry it to the next level, add sea scallops and clams.

This is my 1st recipe review... but I just had to! 
We have a monthly soup and salad group so I am always on the lookout for great soup recipes. When I served it the other night, all the gals said that it could never be topped. All the guys asked for seconds. My husband, the Chowder Connoisseur, who has ordered chowder in every city we have ever vacationed at, said it was the best he ever tasted. I did reduce the cayenne pepper for him though. hubby doesn't do hot. AND, I completely forgot to put in the bacon, which I did fry, but I'm a Senior- what can I say.  

After cooking the bacon crisp, I sauteed the veggies in the bacon fat- I really think that was enough of the "fat". but, next time, I will definitely add the bacon. This is one of the best soup recipes I have ever come across.

Thanks Sheryl!


Next time, I will put in the bacon, but not the grease... I think it is enough if you just saute the veggies in the reserved bacon fat. Then

Used two cans crab meat instead of fresh and ham instead of bacon.  Very good stuff!

I made this for my family last night and it was a disappointment.  Sorry, but it really ended up tasting like straight cream with a little spice.  My husband and I went back to double-check we added everything and we did.  The crab wasn't cheap and it took a lot longer to make than expected.  We ended up pouring it down the drain. :(

This soup was excellent. I followed the directions exactly. My three year old who never eats soup loved it so much that he asked for it for dinner three nights in a row.

Wow!  Better than any restaurant chowder I've had.  I was a little intimidated by the recipe, but it was written so well that it was very easy to follow.  Would also be great with smoked salmon.  Awesome - I will continue making this!

Easy, delicious. Look no further. Prep time less than 35 minutes for me.
Can reduce stock and make up with 4 small tins of chopped clams and their juice (leave out shrimp).
Have muslim friend so left out the bacon - still fabulous.

My husband is a Captain for the F/V Baranof out of Dutch Harbor Alaska so we always have King Crab at home. I made this recipe tonight and will be serving it tomorrow for some friends. Before I put it away I tried a bite and it was delicious. The only change I made was  green peppers for red and added Crown Royal instead of Brandy and used Old Bay instead of Creole seasonings but only beacause that was what I had on hand.Obviously I used King Crab instead of lump but who wouldn't!! LOL!!

If you are looking for a thick, chunky chowder-like soup, this is not it.  This is a very thin soup and is not that great for the time and money put into it.  Bland and tastes like fattening half-and-half.  Sorry! :(

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe for everything but the sherry and chicken broth and used 1/4 tsp Cajun seasoning instead of cayenne/Creole. I substituted milk for the chicken broth since I was out and it was perfect. So glad that this made left-overs!

Best Chowder recipe I've tried so far.  You won't be disappointed.  Stuck to the recipe except for reduced servings to 6 and it made about 5 good servings for our family.  Used cooked shrimp, just added them at the end to warm them through, and I didn't have any crab.  I will be making this again with crabmeat someday.  My husband wants me to make this "at least 4 times a year" and my 19 month old couldn't get enough of it.  I didn't giver her any shrimp yet though. This is a keeper.

Very good! I used a red pepper just for better color and I would add a little more shrimp and some parsley. Didn't feel it was too spicy, just right!

My husband and I made this last weekend and it was great! We used frozen, left-over seafood - cooked crab and shrimp. We didn't shop to make this - we used what we had on hand and made some adjustments to accommodate our groceries. The recipe still held up strong in spite of the substitutions I made and we thoroughly enjoyed making it and eating it. This is a family-sized recipe. We'll likely half the recipe the next time we make it. If you're craving Cream of Crab or Clam Chowder, give this a try - you won't regret it. It is a wonderful dish and we loved eating it with just saltines.

This is the best Chowder recipe on this site!  However, the roux took more like 30 minutes instead of 10 so be sure to give yourself plenty of time to make this.  I used smoked salmon instead of crab and shirmp.  Since it's already cooked, I just added it in at the end.  I also omitted the bacon, bell pepper, brandy, cayenne pepper and creole seasonings.

WOW!   What a great soup!   After making this soup, I joined allrecipes.com just so I could thank Sheryl for sharing this delicious recipe.    I rarely measure spices but know I uused extra of everything except the cayenne pepper.  I did not have fresh corn but 2 cans, drained, of a high quality canned corn worked fine.    This is a keeper and I will be making this soup again and again.   Thank you, Sheryl!

Amazing.  Followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the brandy - didn't have any and didn't want to buy a whole bottle just for 1 teaspoon.  Makes enough to feed a crowd, though, so you might want to add cream just to the portion you're going to use that day, and freeze the rest of the base (adding cream when you reheat it).

Oh my goodness..this soup was very very good..I'm still full this morning. My boyfriend was craving corn chowder and I'm so glad I settled on this recipe.. It was time consuming, but well worth it. I used cream, but then substituted milk for the half & half - it was creamy, luscious and we both agreed it was definitely restaurant quality! Thanks Sheryl!

This is the best chowder recipe I've ever had, including restaurant chowder! I don't usually leave reviews on Allrecipes, but this chowder was so good that I felt it would be a shame not to let everyone know that my family and I absolutely loved it. Thanks for sharing this exceptional recipe!

Hello all...  I am so happy that so many people like/love the recipe!  Me and my family love it.  This was the first time I ever put a recipe here, so there might have been a few mishaps with prep time... sorry for that, I an a newbie to this.  You can easily substitute any of the seafood in this recipe to fit your taste, I see that alot of people have done that already.  Once again, I'm glad you like it!

An awesome Crab Chowder.  I have Made this for parties in the past and it is always a big hit.  I aways add a bit of old bay at the end, according to taste.   Also don't bother using super lump crab meat for this, the claw or regular lump is just fine.

This soup is fantastic! Had company for dinner and serve this in sourdough bread bowls The only changes I made were..added extra of all the veggies and shrimp. Used red pepper instead of green and didn't peel the potatoes ,added a few dashes of red pepper flakes just because we like things spicy.

This chowder is awesome! I think the recipe yields more than 10 servings but who's complaining.  I made it exactly as written with the exception of eliminating the shrimp and instead adding 1 lb. of frozen scallops (wasn't into peeling shrimp today).  Better than restaurant quality.  Next time I may add a can of diced tomatoes.  Hope I don't screw up a good thing.

This is a great recipe...I did change a few things for my liking.  I used better the bouillon lobster base instead of the chicken stock, did not add the white pepper...the cayenne pepper gives this soup enough heat.  I didn't have any crab so I doubled the shrimp.   It was terrific!!!

This was one of the best corn chowders I have ever eaten. It may seem like a lot of ingredients, but it is worth it. I omitted the flour, and the soup still thickened nicely. It even freezes well, except the shrimp become a bit mushy after reheating. As I write this, I am eating the soup that has been frozen 3 months, and it still tastes fresh and full of flavor. Perfect for a cold day.

My husband and I loved this ... however I did use a little more of all the seasonings. I didn't use the Brandy because we didn't have it on hand. Instead of Creole I used lots of Old Bay seasoning. And I also used a red pepper instead of green ... looks better and I love red peppers. We also didn't use the shrimp. Loved it and will be making many more times!

The flavors of this soup were good, but the directions for the roux do not produce the right kind of thickener. I put the heat on medium-low, melted a stick of butter and added 1/2 cup of flour, stirred constantly for ten minutes, and what I had at the end of it was not "peanut-butter" consistency. It was runny and just looked like thick melted butter. So my soup was very runny and I had to resort to adding instant potato flakes to thicken it. Once I fixed the thickening problem, I added more creole seasoning and salt than the recipe called for because it was just a little bit bland. 

At that point, the soup tasted very good and was sort of thick. But what ruined the whole thing for me was when I added the lump crab at the very end. I used the kind you get in the seafood section that is refrigerated and comes in a plastic cup. It said it had an expiration date of nearly six months away. But after I dumped it into the soup, the whole thing took on this inedible fishy taste. I don't know what went wrong with that crab, but I suggest tasting your lump crab on its own before you ruin the soup by adding it.

WOW!!!!! This is definitely no ordinary recipe. Best chowder I've ever had.......actually.....one of the best things I've ever eaten! I did not have brandy so I substituted it with a little extra white wine. I also doubled the creole seasoning- I like things spicy. Absolutely AMAZING. However, there was a TON leftover after my husband, three kids, and I ate. Next time I make this it will be for a bigger group of people. Thanks for sharing this! I will definitely be coming back to this recipe again and again. :)

This chowder is a crowd pleaser!  Typically, by the time I have finished cooking something, I am already tired of it, but I could eat this chowder at every meal.  I served it as an appetizer at a party recently and everyone loved it!

According to my husband this is one of my best soup recipes and he doesn't like seafood chowder! He said he wants this as the first course on Christmas Day...Didn't add the heavy cream as I was trying to cut some of the calories but this is a definate keeper recipe. Thank you Sheryl!

Everyone loved this! I used fresh crab legs. I bought 3 lbs. of regular sized crab legs and only needed to shell a little more than half, so I would say buying 2 lbs of crab legs will definitely yield enough crab for the recipe. I boiled the legs for 3 minutes in salted water and used heavy duty kitchen shears to get the crab meat out. I used regular sized frozen, cooked shrimp and cut them into little pieces after thawing them and removing the tails. because they were pre-cooked I added them to the simmering soup just long enough to warm them. The price of fresh corn was too high this time of year so I used frozen white corn. Those were the only changes I made and it was delish on our first snowy day. My husband said it was even better the second day (he called home from work on the second day to tell me to make sure the kids left some for him!) so next time I might make even more than 10 servings. I served it with home made Russian black bread and Sam Adam's Boston Lager on the side. Sfarrish...this recipe rocks! Many thanks!

This soup was absolutely decadent! I usually don't write reviews but this was so worth it! The prep work took a tad longer than expected but overall it wasn't a very complicated dish! I left out the brandy since we didn't have any and I did not see a point in buying a whole bottle just to use 1 tablespoon. I also used 3 cans of lump crab mean instead of fresh because I couldn't find any! Even with the changes the chowder was absolutely divine! If I could give more stars I would :)

Fab! used black pepper and it was tooo much. Minor adjustment and wonderful flavors. Did not use any alcohol, or cajun spice. Just old bay seasoning. We also did not add the whole milk. Just used the broth and cream.

I forgot to review the first time.  This is my second time making.  Wonderful, rich and creamy chowder.  THE BEST!  The only thing I did different was to add a little clam juice (about a cup) in place of the same amount of stock.

I'm going to make this for a ladies get together.  I'd like to make it the day before, let it marinate and reheat.  Can anyone tell me how it holds up the next day.  I just want to make sure it doesn't separate or look funky.  Thank you so much.

This soup is amazing!  Even better than Bonefish's.  I cut out quite a bit of the fat and it still held up really well and stayed creamy.

This was great. But very very time consuming!!! And sooooo many ingredients. I followed everything to the T. Except I used the advice of another member and instead of the butter I used Evaporated Milk to cut back on calories.

This was excellent.  I have several recipes for corn chowder but none with seafood.  I changed the servings to 5.  I did make my own roux and had no problem.  I added more bacon and extra to garnish with extra crab when served.  I doubled the brandy. Cut the potato amount in half, it was a large russet. Did not want the potato to be the dominant ingredient. I changed the heavy cream and used half/half.  Then added coconut milk for the half/half amount.  I made my own Creole seasoning.  Cut up large shrimp as I think have more flavor.  Also, I added at the end so would not get tough. Fresh crab claw which was not expensive. As I had more than enough chowder for two meals, I measured out the amount for our first dinner, added the seafood only to that portion.  I will add the seafood later when we have leftovers.

Lovely flavor. I reduced the amount of corn and potato, and used half and half and 2% milk. My husband wanted a Bonefish Grill copy and he was very pleased with how similar the flavor profile was.

DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER FOR A CHOWDER RECIPE!  RESTAURANT QUALITY!!!  This recipe is EXCELLENT!  The recipe fills a crock pot.  It freezes very well too.  LOVE this recipe.  I had been looking for years for this taste in a chowder.  I also used it for our "game dinner" and used walleye instead of crab.  Just as wonderful.  The base for the chowder is so good, you can use any kind of fish or seafood.  I get compliments galore when I make this chowder.  It's a special occasion recipe - it's that good.  I just can't say enough about it - ya' gotta try it!  Oh yeah.. I used whiskey instead of brandy and didn't use clarified butter.  Just regular butter.

You must have patience!! I made mine with 1 cup half/half and 3 cups whole milk and it still came out thick and yummy! Of course not as thick as with cream, but also not as fattening. It takes a while to properly cook that much roux and a long time to thicken that much soup in one pot. Well worth the time spent. Delicious! Save yourself some time and don't peel the potatoes. There's no reason for it.

This is fabulous!! Family favorite. I don't understand why people complain about any recipe being bland? It is difficult to write a recipe that suits all tastes, so I use it as a starting point, and modify if I don't care for the end product. I always taste as I go, and add seasoning at the end, if need be. What cook makes something and doesnt do a final taste test, especially with a soup? Also, this recipe doesnt need to be super expense. The first time I went all out with fresh, super-expensive ingredients. The last 5 times I've made this I used tiny frozen shrimp, frozen corn and canned crab and it is still to die for. Use your heads!

Excellent recipe, very flavorful. However, the next time I make this, I will reduce the amount of thyme by half. My dried thyme was a little overwhelming.

Wow. This chowder is awesome!!!  I  made a few changes based on personal preferences and availability, but followed the recipe for the most part. I used regular butter, not clarified, upped the amounts of onion, celery, garlic and used red bell pepper instead of green because it's prettier. I will use even more red bell pepper next time. I used fewer potatoes than called for, and will use even fewer next time. (Maybe I had huge potatoes.) I used frozen white corn kernels and subbed sea scallops for shrimp because I prefer them, and used the canned jumbo lump crab meat because fresh was WAY too expensive. I also threw in some canned clams because I love clams. The end result was eye-rollingly good, and it's a good thing, too, because we will have to eat this every meal for days... it definitely makes enough for a crowd. I should have halved the recipe for just the two of us- I wasn't thinking.

I have to say, I really didn't follow this recipe that closely.  I was looking for something to do with some leftover corn on the cob and some cooked shrimp that I didn't want to go bad.  I love soup, so this chowder was the inspiration for mine.  I don't really like to measure things and somine was more of a it says white wine and that looks pretty close...I think the best thing about a soup recipe is that you start with the basics and then add the things you like or take away the things you don't like/don't have.

It's a yummy one, and boy oh boy does it make alot! Yes, it is alot of work but it makes it worth it since and I can freeze it up and I can have it easier in the future. Also, I don't know how it happend, but it seems like it makes about 15 servings rather than 10. Also, during this recipe, I used 3 cans of crab meat. I think in future I would perfer 4 cans. I also think I will mash the potatoes just slightly in the future for a better texture aswell. I also added more of each spice to taste. I think kicking it up a bit makes it a top notch chowder soup!

I made this for Mother's Day.  1. Takes A LOT of time.  2. Ingredients are expensive and a restaurant would be cheaper. 3.  I followed it to a T and it tastes like cream.  4. Consistency of a cream broth with chucks of crab, corn, etc.  and would not consider this a chowder.  Thin soup and bland.  Will not make again.  Sorry.

My wife and I made this as a team using the Dungeness crab we caught on the Oregon Coast.  One of the absolute best chowders I've had in my life!  We have some more Dungeness and Red Rock meat in our freezer and will be making more soon!

This was not cheap but it was so good.  I made a few minor adjustments (1/2 the white pepper, 2 cups of cream + 2 cups half and half, forgot to add the bacon) but overall thought this was delicious.  I would make it again.

Loved the recipe but I am trying to cut back some calorie intake....I used half and half not heavy cream and opted not to add the bacon fat, I used one extra rasher of bacon. This was fantastic and I would serve it to anyone!

I too, was looking for a copycat corn and crab chowder similar to BFG. This is it!! For my first try, I halved the recipe, because....well...crab is expensive. I followed the recipe exactly, only making a few changes: I used apple juice instead of brandy and white cooking wine instead of dry white wine. I only added a dash of cayenne and included both old bay and Cajun seasoning. Instead of green peppers, I used red. I also used canned corn and Philip's lump crab. The soup was delicious. I knew it was a hit when I heard the sound of my husband's spoon scraping the bowl.

It is quite a bit more work than other corn chowder recipes I found, but it is completely worth it. It makes a lot, which is great for leftovers. In fact, it was even better the next day. I am a spice wimp so I left out the cayenne, which was a mistake. Next time I will definitely add it. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a great recipe. I made a few changes though. I omitted the potato but added 3 more slices of bacon. I also added more (unsalted) real butter. I cooked bacon in the oven; then, I used the same pan for the shrimp on 225 for just a few minutes. I added a tsp. crab boil, tsp. fish sauce, and some/lots of fresh garlic. I did not use the half/half. I added whole milk instead. I probably had more soup in the end, but it will be eaten! I cooked on low for almost 2 hours (while waiting on hubbie) which allowed the seasoning to set. Then, finally, I added the fresh crab meat. The extra time made all the difference! My husband ate two bowls and thanked me 3 times.

I have no words for how delicious this is. It is restaurant quality and one of the best soups I've ever had. I was appalled at how much fat was in this recipe so I used 1 cup cream and 3 cups half and half, and it still turned out amazing!

Can't understand why part whole cream and part half-and-half.   There is already a ton of fat in the recipe and a little bit of H&H is a real "why bother?"   Went ahead a used 4 cups whole cream.
Will surely make it for company!

Oh, I'll definitely make this again.  As with many recipes, I do change a few things so suit what I have on hand.  Didn't do too many changes to this one, though.  This is one recipe that can be a whole meal by adding a salad and  Italian/French bread.  
Do allow a lot of time for this one, but it's worth it.  It's even better the next day!   Use this as a base for almost any chowder.

This is so rich, yet I'd hate to try to cut down on the cream & butter - fairly time consuming, but worth the trouble if you want a really delicious chowder. I didn't have crab but  the fresh corn we had was super sweet, so didn't miss it.  Seasonings were spot on. Thanks!

Terrible.  I ate cream and that was it.  Not sure why everyone is raving.  Was like pure thin cream that should go in coffee.  Don't waste time and money on this.  Made it to the "T" and all 8 in my family had a couple sips from their spoons and couldn't eat their bowls.  It was an embarrassment.

It needed more garlic, twice as much, and 3 more tablespoons butter, what the heck, you already have fatty stuff, so make it taste good. Also I added salt. Also more wine. THEn it was like restaurant chowder.

This was a delicious recipe, I did switch it up and use kielbasa instead of bacon and cream corn instead of fresh.  It turned out delicious!!  I also simplified and did not use the following: Worcestershire, creole, wine or brandy, and it was still great!

I added sausage and used turkey bacon  instead.  I also used 2 cups of whole milk and added a half cup of butter to substitute the heavy cream.  I did not add the brandy since I did not have any.  I also used black pepper instead of white pepper since I like it spicy.  Came out fabulous.  My teenage son and husband complimented all night about this recipe.

I didn't want to make as large of a batch as this recipe makes so I just used lessor amounts of everything but didn't really measure things out so I'm sure the ratios are off a bit, but Otherwise followed the recipe as is minus the brandy.  This is a great recipe and didn't leave me feeling as if something was missing.  Will absolutely make again.

Excellent soup! My family loved it. I made sure to buy good quality shrimp and crabmeat. I made a double batch and found it to be on the thicker side so just needed some extra chicken stock...and wine. I'd be careful to not overdo the heat, followed recipe closely and it had a nice heat to please a crowd.

Halved this recipe and it still made plenty! Changes I made... Didn't have any shrimp so doubled up the crab and subbed old bay for creole seasoning. Didn't add green pepper cause I don't like it.  Used all half and half bc I didn't have heavy cream.  Next time I'll use way less white pepper, maybe even cut it out all together. I don't really care for it and the kids thought it was way too peppery! Overall very very tasty!!

This is one of my very favorite recipes in summer when crabbing is plentiful. I have never been disappointed. I pretty much follow the recipe but add a little more crab and extra bacon for serving.

This recipe is excellent!  Just the right amount of heat with the creole seasoning and excellent flavor.  You can definitely use frozen corn if fresh is out of season or for ease of preparation.  This has become a family favorite and a request from my extended family members.  The prep time is long and the recipe is expensive, but well worth it!!

I have never wrote a review for any recipe.  I am so proud of this Great recipe, flavors are all over the place! I changed very little:  I did not have white wine, I used frozen corn, the crab meat I used was left overs from New Years Eve so I boiled the shells and paws with some fresh vegatables to make a broth to subsitute the Chicken Broth.  
This is in my top 10 box!
