It was good but nothing special at all. I like the idea of tofu with pasta.

I think this recipe was good.  Not fantastic, but a nice non-tomato sauce pasta recipe.  I used feta instead of romano cheese.  I'll make it again too.

A little bland to me, but my family all liked it. Definitely making it again. I'll try to make the oil more of a sauce next time.

This was very good. Used Scallions instead of onions just because that's what I had and twice the mushrooms. Very tasty!

WAY too much black pepper.  It completely overpowered the other flavors in the dish.  I would make it again with about 1/4 of the pepper.
