I made the cake EXACTLY as indicated, however I increased the batter by doubling the it because I wanted a thicker cake. The results were perfect!!!  For those who had problems with the streusel topping sinking into the batter and cracking during the baking process, follow the simple step. After preparing the topping, place the entire bowl (not the batter) into the freezer for several hours or overnight. Remix with a fork until they resemble small crumbs. Sprinkle on top of cake batter. Pat down gently with a large spatula (especially the corners) to ensure the topping "sticks" to the batter and also to even the cake out. I baked mine at 325 degrees instead of 350 and the cake baked and rose more evenly. Take a look at my photo. The cake was delicious and disappeared very quickly!! Thank you Mary for the recipe!!!

LET ME FIRST SAY THAT THIS COFFEE CAKE IS DELICIOUS!!!!  I HAVE NEVER TASTED A COFFEE CAKE LIKE THIS BEFORE.  BEFORE TRYING THIS RECIPE I DID READ ALOT OF THE REVIEWS AND TOOK IN TO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SAID, SUCH AS NOT ENOUGH STREUSEL AND THE STREUSEL MELTING INTO THE CAKE.  I REMEDIED BOTH, I USED 1/2 CUP OF FLOUR, 1/2 CUP OF WHITE SUGAR AND 1/2 CUP OF BROWN SUGAR (KEPT THE BUTTER THE SAME) FOR THE STEUSEL, IT MADE MORE THAN ENOUGH, I ALSO DID'NT PUT THE STREUSEL ON UNTIL IT WAS COMPLETELY DONE. I PUT THE STEUSEL ON AND COVERED THE PAN (9X9) WITH ALUMINUM FOIL AND THAT MOISTENED THE STREUSEL I THEN PRESSED IT DOWN JUST A BIT. I ALSO ADDED A BIT OF CINNAMON TO THE FLOUR FOR THE BATTER AND IT ALL TURNED OUT GREAT!!!! THANKS MARY

I used an 8 x 8" pan and put half of the streusel in the middle and half on the top. I used 1/3c white sugar and 1/3 c brown sugar to make up the 2/3c sugar for the streusel.  I baked it for 40 minutes. Delicious!

The streusel topping melted during baking so, now I add it towards the last 10 mins of baking. I have made this cake several times with no additions or ingredient changes and it was never dry. Try rotating the baking pan at the halfway point of the baking time and then check five minutes before the end of the recommended baking time with a cake tester or toothpick. There should be very few crumbs adhering to the tester when the cake is ready. Hope this helps.

I really enjoyed the taste of this coffee cake but it should have been made in a 9 x 9 pan.  There didnt seem to be enough batter for 13 x 9.  Also I think a little less butter in the topping would make it crunchier.  The topping melted into the cake.

Delicious! Try it for yourself, don't trust the bad reviews. I halved the recipe and made it in a 8x8 in. pan--I still used one whole egg and added milk to make 1/2 cup. I also made a full batch of topping using brown sugar instead of white.  It took a few extra minutes to cook and a few minutes for the topping to set.  I did not follow the directions for mixing the cake--just did it as you would any other cake and creamed the butter with the sugar, etc. Quick, easy, tasty, and uses ingredients you always have on hand.

Excellent and Easy! The only alterations I made were to use a 9 inch round springform pan and baked for 35 minutes, increased milk by 2 Tbsp. and used 1/3c white sugar and 1/3 c. brown sugar in topping, rather than all white sugar. This was a hit with my kids and guests. So easy and uses always-on-hand pantry items.

This cake might have gotten 5 stars except for the instructions.  A recipe's ingredients should be listed in the order in which they will be used - unless there is a caption showing the following ingredients are for the topping.In this case, the topping is listed last but the instructions deal with it first.  The poster notes the 1/4c. flour & the 2/3 c sugar & 1tsp cinnamon but then simply says to cut in the butter.  I can see why one reviewer ended with a puddle of butter on the cake because looking quickly I put in the 1/2 c butter.  Just before turning the mixer on I realized what I had done and was able to remove some in time.    Other than that blip, I followed the recipe, had no problem with using a 9x13 pan.  The cake itself rose to almost 1.75" and with the topping it was a good 2".  That's quite good enough for a coffee cake.  I'm finding the topping crumbles a lot when removing to serve but the flavor, moisture, texture is excellent.  Took about 15 minutes longer to cook.

I really wanted to love this cake, but it just didn't taste very good. I think it has potential, but I'm not going to waste my time trying to 'save' it. I thought it was bland. I followed the recipe EXACTLY as written. I even made this recipe TWICE in case I did something wrong without knowing, but I CAREFULLY followed it again and it still tasted bland. I later baked another recipe from this site (Cranberry Upside Down Coffee Cake) and THAT one was ACTUALLY absolutely delicious.

This is a perfect morning cake! Delicious, fluffy and super simple. Made it in a 9inch round pan...planned to use the 9x13 but didn't look like it would be enough. It was perfect in the round pan! Layered the topping and added some chopped walnuts to the top. Couldn't have been better! ( take it out before the top starts to brown and it will be super moist, and addicting!)

This was a good coffee cake that hit the spot for brunch. I added a 1/4 C of chopped walnuts to the topping mixture. As one reviewer noted, there doesn't seem to be enough batter for a 9x13 pan but it can be done through a little bit of elbow grease-- the batter is sticky and hard to spread.

This cake as written needed a little work, in my opinion, so I added some brown sugar to both the strussel and the batter and used more cinnamon then called for.  Also, I put some of the strussel in the batter and swirled it around with a butter knife, and then put the rest on the top during the last five minutes of baking.  Make sure to make a little extra strussel.  Without these changes I think the cake tastes too dense and like it has too much flour.  These changes will give it a lot of extra flavor.

This was pretty good although I made my own streusal by combining 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I like a thick coffeecake so I used an 8-inch glass cake pan and layer the batter with the streusal ending with streusal on top.  Since it was thicker I had to bake it for 50 minutes.

I have been looking for this recipe for many years.  I used to make this cake back in the early 80s.  The recipe got lost in my many moves.  I am delighted to find it again, just as easy, just as delicious!

TIPS:  Use COLD butter.  Remember to NOT over-mix.  Lumpy batter means tender cake.  Also, I like to add 1/4 C chopped nuts to the streusel topping.  Simple and perfect every time.

Great recipe!  Followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the topping.  I put half the batter in, sprinkled some topping on, poured the rest of the batter, then put the remaining topping on. Doesn't even need sour cream or yogurt in the recipe. I'm definately making this again.

I followed a review; to first bake the cake and while still warm just after taking it out of the oven sprinkle with streusel and wrap foil over it. I discovered is best to take it out of the oven while almost ready sprinkle with streusel and then bake for another 10 mins. Turns out great!!!!!

This tasted just like coffee cake from a coffee shop!  I made minimal changes based upon reading others' reviews.  For one, I added just a splash of extra milk because the batter seemed dry.  For the topping, I used 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. flour, keeping the butter and cinnamon the same.  The most important change was that I baked it in an 8x8 instead of 9x13.  I don't see how there would be enough batter to use a 9x13.  Using an 8x8 was perfect.  Will be making again for company!

This was so good, I followed the cake recipe exactly and it was fine in a 9x13 pan.  I just spread it out with a rubber spatula.  I did add brown sugar to the topping and a little more butter and held off from adding it until the last 10 minutes of baking...it is really, really good and I will definitely make again!

Taste was fine but the cake was dry, dense and flat. Topping was crispy not crumbly. Maybe cooking it in a smaller pan might help.

Great Recipe!  I made 1.5x the streusel and used a bundt pan.  Grease and flour a bundt pan, pack some streusel on the bottom (top when inverted) fill with 1/2 cake mixture, another layer of streusel, finish with rest of cake mixture and bake 30-40 min.  I added a simple cinnamon glaze on top - wonderful recipe - thanks!

This is the exact coffee cake recipe I've always wanted! Delicious and it tastes great the next couple of days also. I love coffee cake and have made lots of recipes, usually the sour cream version, but love this one so far the best! I did use brown sugar in the topping though instead...just because I know thats how I like the topping.

I used 1/3 white sugar and 1/3 brown sugar and added pecans to the topping... I also ALWAYS sift the flour in cakes or use cake flour.  I sifted the flour 3 times.  Makes this recipe lighter.  This recipe is really good.  Everyone loved it.  It reminds me of Starbucks.. :0)

Delicious!  I made this EXACTLY as written.  At first I thought the 9x13 pan would be too big because it seemed like the batter was a thin layer.  But it fluffed up while it baked and was perfect.

instead of following the recipe i made it in a mixer like other cakes i bake. it turned out great. i doubled the recipe though because i don't want a thin coffee cake. being doubled it rose to more than three inches. i also added cinnamon into the middle of the cake so it is more a cinnamon swirl coffee cake. anyway delicious. only thing i may change next time is adding a bit more soy milk so the batter is a little more like batter and not dough.

My family LOVED this coffee cake.  I made it in a Demarle silicone bundt pan, baked it for 35 minutes and it slid out great.  Great texture, very moist.  I also did 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar and would do the same next time.  So happy to have found a different coffee cake recipe.  Thank you!

I'm not sure what happened but this coffee cake turned out awful!!!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY but it turned out totally flat, rubbery and tasteless.  The struesel topping just melted into the cake.  With all the good reviews I hate to give a bad one.  Usually I have no problems with recipes from this site that have four or five stars.  I think this is a first.  Oh well!  I'll keep looking for a good coffee cake recipe!

My mom used to make a bisquick coffee cake when i was a kid, and it was always my favorite. This one is 100 times better, I really liked it. I I doubled the crumble like others said and I put it on half way through. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Double the recipe for the 9x13" pan.  Sprinkle half the streusel in the middle of the batter, the rest on top.  SO GOOD!

This is my go to coffee cake recipe.  I always make it in an 8X8 dish and sometimes add berries or chocolate chips to it.  Today I am making it just as it is.  Super yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I followed another user's advice and made it in an 8x8 pan. I put half of the streusel topping in the middle and the rest on top. Will DEFINITELY make this again!

This cake was delicious and so simple to make. I added and extra 1/4 cup of milk and the moisture was perfect. I also did as other reviewers suggested and used 1/3 cup of white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar for the topping. Since I used an 8x8 glass pan, the cake needed at least 40 minutes to bake, but the extra time was worth it. My husband and kids loved it! This is a keeper.

These are AWESOME! BIG HIT! The only change I made was double the topping and baked the cake for 15 min and then added the topping then baked until a toothpick came out clean..approx 10 min. more. JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN!!!!

Well I learned my lesson!!!  I printed this recipe and made it several times...EXACTLY as stated at first and then by making a little more "crust topping".  This tastes just like a famous pastry company that I will never be buying their expensive coffee cake again thanks to this very quick, easy, and most importantly: TASTY cake!  My lesson?  I forgot to save it in my "recipe box" and lost the printed paper.  It seemed to take forever to find it again!  Now I saved it in 3 places...breakfast, dessert, and breads!  This is one of those "company is coming" recipes that I can throw together in a hurry and still taste like I prepared for hours!  I can serve it warm with ice cream.  While not an everyday thing, I can serve it as a Sunday morning breakfast treat.  I can also bring it to a local bake sale or family/church/school gathering "pot luck".  So my only question is...do I reveal my sources of this masterpiece or leave them wondering?  Thank you Mary!  This is the perfect recipe!...now I am going to see what other ones you have posted! :)

was really good! i did follow the amount of topping to put on top from other users (1/2 cup flower, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, same butter and cinnamon). oh, and since a lot of people were saying that it melted, i just waited to put the topping in after 10 mins of baking. very tasty, definately would try again :)

Works well as a bundt cake too! I lightly pressed the topping into the bottom of the bundt pan and poured the batter on top. Cooked for 20 min longer than written. Was very moist and the topping was very crispy! Will probably make again, as my family loved it. ^_^

This was a great easy coffee cake with staple ingredients. I like mine with more topping so I doubled it and put some brown sugar in with the white. Yum.

This is great coffee cake.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was on the topping I did half white sugar and half brown sugar.  

 I had no problems with dryness at all.  It was still moist three days later.  The only thing I can think of what happened to others was they either baked it too long or their oven was too hot.  

I will be making this again.

College Student's Dream! Very easy to make but satisfies sweet tooth at 11:00pm! I had no butter in the house so substituted margarine, went a little overboard with it in the topping, but that made a nice caramelized “crust” with yummy gooey caramel filling! Margarine worked fine. Fluffy, true cake taste. I would add about ¼ teaspoon clove to the cinnamon on the topping next time, just for a bit more flavor. Drop this by your kid’s dorm room as a surprise they will love it!

I made this for a last minute brunch and this was very quick and really good.  It was moist and not too sweet.  I think I might try brown sugar in the topping as some have suggested. Cinnamon in the batter might be a nice touch, too. Will make again.

Loved this recipe.  Very simple to make and it's not too heavy at all.  Have made several times for a women's study group and all loved it!  Have had the recipe requested many times.  When my 3 year old nephew comes to visit he asks for it as soon as he walks in the door!  The only alteration I ever made was to add half a bag of the Hershey's cinnamon chips just to use it up.  My husband prefers it with the cinnamon chips - but I like it as is!  I could eat 1/2 the cake fresh out of the oven.  Thanks Aunt Anne!!!!!!!!

This coffee cake is delicious!  I found this recipe about 8 months ago and I've made it at least a dozen times since. 
All the ingredients are in my house all the time, and it's so simple to make! :)

Great starter recipe.  I added cream cheese, lemon zest and crumble and blueberries.  The crumble on top was made the same only without cinnamon.  I baked it in a springform pan and it came out cleanere than I thought it would.  The taste is divine and moist and yummy!

I followed the recipe almost to exact, except for the streusel topping, I used 1/3 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar, I added the topping the last 10 minutes of baking. I baked the cake for about 40 minutes in a 8x11 inch pan. The cake came out great!

This cake was delicious, the sweetness perfect, just like my mom's! But only right after I pulled it from the oven. The batter was so sticky I had to add allot of flour and it turned out kind of dry. When it cooled down completely it turned to stone.

My husband says "the consistancy isn't right but it tastes good". He just doesn't want to hurt my feelings. This was the densest cake I have ever made, it was absolutely horrible! Its wetter than banana bread! I should've known when the batter was thick like brownie batter that it would have the consistancy of a cookie.  I'll never make this recipe again, there was nothing that could've been done to make it better.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used my own topping. It looked like there wasn't going to be enough to cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan, so I used a 9x9. The cake rose well (almost tripled in size), but it was VERY dense. It tasted delicious, so I think next time I will try the 9x13 pan.

Aunt Anne's Coffee Cake is actually from an old McCalls recipe card and it is delicious. I always make this because the ingredients are things I always have on hand. My kids love it and are constantly asking me to make it on the weekends.

I threw this coffee cake together on a whim.  
The cake itself was moist and delicious, I added a little cinnamon, but will add more next time.  As I made this so quickly, I didn't have time to read other comments....I agree that a 9x13 is too big and that the crumb topping melted away.  Mid-cooking I realized this and whipped up an apple, butter, cinnamon topping----tasted great.  Next time I will use a smaller pan but the same amount of crumb topping, I will just add it later in the cooking cycle.

Came out tasty. I doubled it, and it made a huge cake that bubbled out of the pan, but it worked out. Can't make a crumb topping to save my life. But, it came out good.

Made just as described on ingredients did use a slightly smaller plan but kind of wished I didnt personally I would have liked the cake a bit thinner as opposed to the thicker. Reminded me a lot of those donut sticks you can get from little debbie! but better

I love this cake. I make mine a little different, adding a bit more milk than suggested. The cake comes out moist & delicious. My husband and neighboor (hubbies best friend) ask for this cake OFTEN!

this cake was pretty good, but it seemed more like a streusel cake than a coffee cake. the topping was good, but the cake part was a little too plain for me. next time i make it i plan on adding a couple tbs of pumkin pie spice to the crumb mixture (its a blend of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg mainly) and i think that will take care of it.

Thanks a million for sharing such a fantastic recipe! I followed some tips from other reviewers such as substituting 1/2 brown sugar and half white sugar; using oil instead of butter in batter; doubled recipe for height; finely chopped 3 small apples and layered the batter; added chopped pecans to crumb mixture. Incredible! Can't wait until my hubby gets home to share :)

This recipe was perfect. It was very easy to make and actually it was the first thing that I have made from here that took as long as it said it would to cook. The only thing that I may change the next time is to use a smaller pan to make a thicker cake. Great job with this one.

I made this in a 9x9 stone and put a layer of the streusel topping in the middle. I also used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar for the topping. I baked it for 40 minutes and it turned out wonderful. I think it would have been too thin had I used a 9x13 pan. I brought it to work still hot out of the oven and everyone loved it. One person said it tasted like Amish Friendship Bread - and it's MUCH faster!

It was ok, I layered the topping into the batter. I think the fact it was all white sugar made the streusel a bit crunchy and hard. I will keep looking for a recipe more to my liking.

Sorry, not what I was looking for.  I wanted more of a cake like texture.  This is much more like a bisquit with a sugar topping, no one really cared for it.

Wow! This really is great coffee cake.  I'm making my second batch at this very moment, because yesterdays batch was eaten so quickly! I'm making a little extra topping this time, but it was great with the standard amount as well.
Thanks Aunt Anne.

Wow! Yum! I followed the directions pretty closely and my cake turned out to be perfectly delicious! I used a 10" round and it was the perfect size for me. I will say I was surprised at how much volume the cake had. It really does poof up. I did put some streusel in the middle as well. Also, after some mental debate, I put the top layer of streusel on the cake BEFORE putting it in the oven and it was perfect. My coworkers kept commenting that the cake had the perfect combination of crunchiness from the top layer, balanced with the delectable-ness of the rest of the cake. I really recommend trying the cake recipe as it is written before making too many changes. It was super yummy.

This cake is wonderful. I omitted the topping and added a pint of fresh blueberries to the mixture and sprinkled with corse sugar after baking.  It needed nothing else.  I baked in a 9x11 pan.  

Suggestions for butter.  Freeze for 30 minutes then grate with a cheese grater.  

Give this recipe a try.  Easy and YUMMY!

Excellent - made exactly as written, except I used margarine instead of butter.  Next time I might try brown sugar instead of white on the topping.  Very good recipe.

I followed the cake part pretty much exactly, but making sure to soften the butter.  I followed another reviewer but doing the following for the streusel: 1/2 c flour, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1 tsp cinn, 1/4 c butter.  I tried it in the 9X13 despite what other reviewers said b/c I wanted it to cook quickly.  I'm glad I did.  I had no trouble spreading it, it puffed up during baking, and it was done in 25 minutes. Came out perfectly!

I followed some of the tips.  I doubled the streusel and put some on top before I baked it, then added the rest for about 10 minutes before it was done. We like cinnamon, so I doubled the amount in the streusel and added about a teaspoon to the batter.  I baked it in a 9x13 for about 28 minutes total.  The streusel came out nice and crispy on top.  I think it is not enough batter for a 9x13 however, so I gave it 4 stars.

We really enjoyed this coffee cake, I did bake it in a smaller pan 8 by 8... Also because I used a smaller pan I had to bake it longer. I did make extra topping and used a combo of brown and white sugar... I layered the topping in.. Turned out great thanks for the recipe!

AMAZING!  I added about 1 tsp cinnamon to the cake batter and used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the topping.  I also doubled the caked topping and added it to the cake 15 min before it was done cooking. It was PERFECT!!!  Everyone at Easter brunch loved it and asked for the recipe!

So I haven't got to try this cake yet, but I do have to say that it takes longer than 25min in a 350 oven. Mine wasn't even cooked except at the very edgesat that time. I put it in for another 20 minutes and it still wasn't done. So I increased the temperature to 400 and put it in for another 20 minutes, hopefully that'll do the trick. i'm trying to feed 2 kids this for breakfast, but unfortunately because of the time stated in the recipe it's now become lunch. And my oven is running at the correct temperature.

This was a good inspiration recipe and is a keeper. I decided to make this in an 8x8 because I am certain it would have been very flat if done in a 9x13. It turned out perfectly in an 8x8 -- tall, thick & moist -- like you'd get at a fine coffee shop. Instead of using the crumb topping the recipe suggested, I used the one from the banana crumb muffin recipe on this site but doubled it and added cinnamon. I waited until 15 minutes into the cooking time to add the crumb topping. I added some extra cinnamon to the wet batter before baking as well, sprinkled on top, which made a nice cinnamon layer. This is a definite keeper because it can be made easily & fast with ingredients I usually have on hand every day and it was so good it was gone in one day at my house.

Was very easy to make with ingredients I normally have on hand.  As other reviewers mentioned, the topping did melt into the cake (Even though I refrigerated it overnight as one reviewer suggested).  Both my husband and I thought it was too sweet.  I would probably make this again because it was easy and delicoius, but would definitely use less sugar and topping.

This cake tastes lovely-a little heavy for my preference.  Also, I had a difficult time putting the batter into the 13x9.  Recommendations: 1 tsp less butter cut into topping, use 8x8/9x9.

Wonderful coffee cake.  Easy to make with ingredients that are always on hand.  Cake held its moisture for several days.  Will try making muffins with this recipe next time.  A true 4 star. Thanks

This recipe turned out great. After reading a few reviews, I added the streusal topping during the last ten minutes of baking. The cake was moist and I couldn't stop eating it...perfect!

Very easy to make. I added about 1 1/2 c. blueberries and we loved it. This is a fast easy recipe, especially if you don't have sour cream on hand, which is a common ingredient in coffee cakes.

I made no changes to the recipe and it turned out great.  Moist, tender, delicious, and so easy to make.  I found the 9x13 pan to be perfect, and it was barely any trouble to spread the  batter in the pan, even if it was a little thick.  Pieces came out just right, not too thick, not to thin.  Will be making again for sure!

The basic recipe is fantastic. It does need more topping though. I have make this a couple time adding canned peaches, frozen blueberries, or jam and it works out perfectly.

I think it's funny to read people complaining about the struesel sinking into the cake.  I have been making a recipe simliar to this one (same ingredients, but the measurements are different) for over 20 years - and the MAIN thing that everyone raves about the most, is the topping that is inside the cake, in addition to the delicious taste  I've never had another coffeecake recipe that bakes like this or that tastes so yummy.  For that reason, it is my # 1 choice.  I would never try and change things to get the struesel to stay on top - that is what is so good about it!!!

Excellent recipe, very easy to make.  I highly recommend doubling the batch for a 9x13, regular batch only gets about 3/4 thick.  Also tossing a little fresh fruit (NOT FROZEN) in just before putting in the pan is a great way to add some additional flavor and variety.    My mom always made us coffee cakes.  Made some this morning for a group and out of 9 people only 2 had coffee cake before, but they all loved it.

This was delicious! Perfectly moist. I had some leftover apple pie filling that I needed to use up (maybe about a cup), so I mashed up the pie filling and spooned it over the cake before adding the streusel topping. YUM! Definitely a keeper! Also, I baked in a 9X13 pan as directed and I thought the thickness was perfect.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The great thing about it was that I threw it together in about five minutes time with ingredients that I had in my kitchen.  So it's very easy.  I creamed together the sugar and butter the way I would if I was making cookies.  Also, I used brown sugar for the topping and added a bit of oats to the topping.  I made 1 and 1/2 times the recipe quantity and it fit perfectly into a 9 x 13 inch dish.

Just finished eating this for breakfast, and it was wonderful.  I followed the numerous suggestions of using 1/2 cup each of flour, white sugar and brown sugar for the streusel.  And I put it on the last 15 minutes of baking.  I used a 9" square stoneware pan and baked it for about 32 minutes.  I spread confectioner's sugar on top after it cooled.  So yummy!  The cake part itself was delicious on its own, which is our test of a good coffee cake.  The texture of the streusel wasn't exactly what I was looking for (wanted it more like Entenmann's), but I'll keep trying.

This coffee cake was very easy and tasty.  I used a 9x9 pan and used the same amount of butter for the topping but used roughly 1/2 cup white and 1/2 brown sugar and almost 2 tsp. fancy Vietnamese cassia cinnamon because I love a pronounced cinnamon flavor.  I would make it again exactly the same way.

Awsome and very easy.  I do however recommend increasing the topping amt.  I follow one reviewer's suggestion (1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, same butter and cinnamon) and it is perfect every time!  Thanks !

Just made this cake and thought it was very good for a quick cake, using ingredients most of us have in the pantry.  I heeded some reviewers' advice and used an 8x8 pan, and added the streusel after about 20 minutes of baking.  The only real change I did was to use buttermilk instead of regular milk.  The cake actually tasted better the second day!

I really enjoy this recipe. The batter is thick and doesnt look like it will cover the pan- but dont worry!! Spread it out evenly and it will come out wonderful. The only thing i changed is i  increased the cinnamon just a little and used brown sugar on top instead of white. This recipe is a keeper!!!!

Dry batter; difficult to spread in pan. In the topping, decreasing the white sugar to 1/3 cupand adding 1 1/2 cup brown sugar to helped its flavor.

I took the cake out of the oven and turned it out onto a platter (bottom side up) and drizzled a vanilla glaze over the warm cake - I whisked together powdered sugar, vanilla, a pinch of salt and enough milk to make a nice thin glaze. Try fruit or nuts if you like - very versatile recipe!  YUMM!

Afer I had prepared the topping and the cake batter, I decided that I was going to end up with a very thin coffee cake if I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan.  So I buttered a 9 inch square pan, spread half of the batter in the bottom and sprinkled a thin layer of topping over it.  Then I added the rest of the batter and covered it with the remaining topping.  I baked it for about 40 minutes and it came out perfectly!  It is sweet and moist and delicious, with a thin layer of streusel running through the middle.  I had it ready to bake in about the time it took my oven to preheat.  This is a wonderful recipe for anytime, but especially when you need a dessert in a hurry.

This was pretty good. I wasn't to happy although it could have been my husband's baking skills. I think I will try again, although the topping is not enough I would double it to cover the whole cake.

This was a disaster. The pan size given was incorrect, I had to use a smaller pan.  The topping was awful; not at all a crumb topping as it spread. Further the taste was terribly bland.  What a waste of time and ingredients.  Skip this recipe!

I made this coffee cake while I had house guests and judging from the amount they ate, it didn't seem as if they were too crazy about it. My husband and I both thought it was good, however it wasn't what I was expecting. The taste and texture of the cake reminded me of a scone and the topping just sat on top of it and didn't sink down into the cake as most coffee cakes I've eaten do. I think I might make it again but I'm still on the lookout for a more cake-like recipe. I also think it would have been better with all or at least half brown sugar in the topping.

Easy recipe but spreading batter on a greased & floured pan was not the easiest. I prefer to pour a cake batter. As per the reviews I read before making this, I put the struesel on for the last half of the cooking time. I wish I had not as all that crumbly goodness should be part of the cake and not left behind on the plate when you're done. There are far better coffee cake recipes.

This really wasn't all that great and I consider myself to be a fairly good cook. I've made much better coffee cakes before. It was dry with not much flavor and the streusal wasn't as good as I thought it would be. If I were to make this again, I think cinnamon added to the batter would work well, as well as using brown sugar rather than white for both the batter and the streusal. But I don't think I will make this again- there are better recipes out there.

This was very simple to make with ingredients most of us already have on hand. I added a can of pears (I diced them), because most coffee cakes get pretty dry, I added chopped walnuts to the topping. It came out great, very moist.I think tart apples would be a great addition too.
I have been making this cake alot, my families favorite add in fruit is mandarin oranges, I omit the cinnamon topping and make a powder sugar glaze with orange juice (from the mandarins or reguar o.j., whichever is on hand)really yummy to take to work or school if it lasts that long.

It was okay, I had five people sample it and all said, it's okay. Nothing great, I actually think they were being kind. I followed all directions, it looked beautiful, but not something I'd make again.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  It was extrememly sweet and was more like a regular cake than a coffee breakfast cake.  The topping was horrible, it wasn't crunchy or hardened at all, it melted into the cake. Even my husband who isn't picky, didn't like it. I will stick to my old coffee cake recipe for now on.

Excellent recipe! My family loved it. The only changes I made based on reviews was to double the topping and add some cinnamon to the batter. Next time I will add the topping halfway thru the bake time to ensure it’s slightly softer when done. I will also triple the topping so I can place a layer of topping halfway thru the cake.

I made this for a Sunday brunch and my family really liked it! I made it in an 8x8 pan and baked it a tad longer because my family likes thicker pieces. It wasn't my favorite coffee cake but it was worth saving to make again.

I have been searching for a coffee cake since Costco no longer has the all butter coffee cake that my family loves. I really hate when a recipe is reviewed and it has so many changes it hardly resembles the original. I must admit the change I made was to bake the cake in a round springform pan to resemble the cake from Costco. I placed a piece of parchment on the bottom and sprayed it with non stick spray although I don't think the parchment was necessary.  I did place the crumb mixture in the freezer for about a half hour before putting it on the top. At 25 mins there was a pool of butter on the top of the cake and it did not test done with a toothpick so I baked for an additional 15 mins. The crumb crust wasn't very "crummy" when it was done but it was yummy. Family said it was a keeper for sure. The only thing I may do different next time is make more topping and put it in the middle of the cake.

This was amazing! The butter measurements were not specified, so I messed up and put the full 1/2c in the topping. When I made the cake batter, I realized I was supposed to put the 1/2c in that! (I'm a beginner baker obviously) but, it was a tasty mistake, I recommend a 1/2c in both batter and streusel. I refrigerated the topping while the cake baked as someone suggested and then spread it on top when the cake finished. Popped in oven for 5min at 350 to crispy the topping. Beautiful! My two picky toddlers loved it too!! Will bake again very soon.

This recipe was really good! The only thing I changed is for the streusel topping I did 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar. I'm new to baking and had never cut butter into flour. So,  I used a cheese grater and used refrigerated cheese on the biggest grate and it worked out really good! It grated the butter into small enough pieces that worked out well in the batter. I'll definitely will make this again...I have to be careful because it is so good! I baked it at 325 in a round spring pan.

This is not a typical cake. It is a coffee cake. Not too sweet.  Not to heavy. Perfect. That being said. If you want a thicker cake put it in a 9x9 baking pan or double the recipe. Also, I used cold butter and struggled to get the correct consistency. I ended up adding an extra 1/2 stick of unsalted butter (it's what I had. I used my salted butter already.) Softened butter may have worked better. It doesn't say which to use. Some said theirs turned out gooey in the center.I cooked mine on one rung above the middle rack in the oven and for 25 minutes. It was crumbly and good. Next time I may add blueberries or diced cinnamon apples. Just to change it up a little.

My 5 star review is based on a few alterations I made:  (1) Used a 9 x 9 pan instead of a 9 x 13  (2)  Added extra 2 tbsp flour to crumb topping (next time I will add 1/4 cup oats -- I didn't have any on hand).  My crumb topping still sank in slightly, but in a good way, so it won't fall off as you eat it!   (3)   For the cake: Creamed the butter with sugar first, then added the egg.  I mixed the dry together and added half of it to the wet.  I then added most of the milk, and finished adding the rest of the dry.  I added a little more milk as needed.     It baked for 40 minutes and came out perfectly moist with a crunchy topping!  Best coffee cake I've ever made!

Definitely make the streusel with a food processor, much quicker. Also, I'd suggest putting only half of the streusel on before you bake it and wait until you've baked it to add the rest of the streusel. Very good, very moist

I would definitely make this again! After reading a few of the other reviews, I put the topping in the freezer while making the batter. Then I put the topping on just before putting the pan into the oven to bake. I also used a glass 8x8 pan and it had to bake for a total of 40 minutes.  No other substitutions were made. It was nice and moist and added to a nice brunch with friends. Easy but yummy recipe!

This recipe is written very poorly. I also folded the crumble topping into the batter until moistened, again because of the poor wording. Oops. The second time I made this recipe it was good, I added apple purée and an extra egg into the batter and replaced the white sugar with brown sugar for the topping. It was much more flavorful.

Ok.  Make this in a pan smaller than 9 x 13"!  That, or double the recipe.  Unless you like cake that is about 1/2" in thickness.  If you do it like the instructions say you'll end up with a thin cake and about as much streusel as cake.

I did add one egg. I thought it was good but I definitely will put brown sugar on top next time, and bake in a smaller pan. It is very thin, but I intend to stack it. :)

Here's a helpful tip:  use a food processor.  I don't have a food processor, but I do own a mini-prep processor, and it works really well for this recipe. I just work in smaller batches for both the streusel and the cake batter.  It's still faster using the pastry cutter without my hands cramping up, and the results are the same: deliciously moist coffee cake with the perfect crumb texture.  This cake is all about texture!  Every time I make this coffee cake, it disappears so quickly that I get requests to make it again.  Per other reviewer's recommendations, here are some things I do with the recipe.  When I make a 9x13 cake, I double the entire recipe & add just a bit of of extra vanilla.  For the streusel, I use 2/3 C each: flour, brown sugar, white sugar, 3 tsp cinnamon (I love cinnamon) with 1/2 C butter.

Use your best butter. I used 1/3c white sugar, with 1/3c brown sugar for streusel topping & added tsp+  cinnamon in cake mixture. Made one time with 100% brown sugar, as was out of white and it turned out fine, streusel sunk deeper into cake. My 3.5 twins and husband love it both ways....

Everyone loved it!
It was perfect, but I changed some things:
On the first part I used 200 grams of shortning instead of butter.
On the second part (that should go in 1/2 a cup of butter) I put in 1/4.
I just thought it would go in great;but the top "crumb" part was just paste!
So, using a spatula, I mixed it up, but I left it sort of not mixed up.
(If that makes any sence!)

Made this with the following changes: 

1/3 cup each of brown and white sugar for the crumb instead of just white sugar, baked it inside a 9-inch square pan as opposed to the 9  by 13 (this recipe's definitely not enough for that), reduced the sugar in the batter a little bit (didn't fill the measuring cup all the way), used margarine instead of butter, added two tsp of cinnamon to the cake batter and divided the crumb; half in the middle of the cake, and the rest on top. 

With these changes, it was very delicious! Will definitely make again.

Excellent!!excellent!! I served this for after a lunch to out of town guest and they thought I purchased the cake from a bakery. I followed the cake recipe exactly but had to use a bundt pan. For the crumble topping I followed another users review and did 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar the rest was the same. Will be making this again.

Excellent coffee cake!  As many reviewers have suggested, I also baked this in an 8x8 dish.  I have to admit that I was concerned about this recipe turning out right because after mixing the ingredients the batter was stretchy like bread dough.  I had to stretch it to fill the dish.  I also put half the streusel between two layers then topped with the remaining.  I served it warm and it was perfect.  Will make again!

I found this cake was completely cooked after 20 minutes, so definitely keep an eye on it while baking! This cake worked out very well in a 9x13 pan. You have to spread it out to make it fit, but it rises enough to make a nice size cake. I took other reviewers' advice and added 1/2tspn of cinnamon to the batter, which I think helped. I also used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar in the batter. I also changed the topping to be 1/2 cup each of flour, white sugar, and brown sugar, which made for a nice amount of topping. I still found the overall recipe to be slightly bland, so I added toffee bits and caramel sauce on top.

Very bland taste. This is not enough batter for 9 x 13 pan so i had to grease a 9 inch square pan and repour the batter into that. The topping is not enough so i had to double. Also use brown sugar instead of white or do half of each. I would also add cinnamon to batter because this recipe as is is less than ok but maybe with these changes it will be better. Thank you.

This recipe creates a base that, when tweaked, is pretty good in terms of taste; it *is* a bit of a pain to put together due to the extremely sticky batter, though, and if you decide to use a smaller pan, you'll probably want to spruce up the batter a bit to keep it from being too bland. I used an 8x8 pan and distributed about a third of the streusel between two layers of batter, and also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter itself. Because I'm at a high altitude, I also cut out 1/4 tsp of baking powder, increased the milk to a full cup, and increased the oven temp by 25 degrees (and baked for 35 min). This *is* a dense cake, which is probably why the original recipe bakes it thin in a large pan, but I found that the thicker cake was still quite pleasant when reheated before serving. Even starting with partially softened butter (a no-no) and increasing the oven temp, I had no issues with my streusel melting away, but the second time I made it, I added the last handful in the last 10 min of baking. Overall, it's a pretty good recipe but rather troublesome to work with. I liked it a lot better with my changes.

Great Recipe!I followed another reviewers advice and added half cup white sugar,half cup brown sugar and half cup flour for the streusel. I kept the butter the same and I also didn't add it until it the cake was cooled down. I noticed it wasn't sticking so I popped it in the oven for 5 minutes and then refrigerated for 30 and the problem was solved. My husband loved this cake and so did I.I also made it in a 9x9 pan.

Delicious? No. It is 'to die for' delicious. Entire family loved it. I did use 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar for the struesel (as others have) and also added about 1/2 tsp almond extract to the coffee cake mixture. Best ever! Can't wait to make it again. Thank you for the recipe.

I have made this several times and have made it for others as well. Everyone seems to enjoy it. The first time I made it, I made the crumbs too fine but after that I learned to leave in chunks. I also use a little bit of whole wheat flour (3/4 cup) for the fiber. Tastes good either way! I make mine in a bundt.

This is moist and flavorful, very good. I was surprised it was better than sour cream based coffee cakes. Doubled topping and made in a brownie size pan, baked 35ish minutes. Loved it.

I got overly excited about this cake, as many times as I saw it pop up in the reviews. Despite the title, looking at the pics, I just assumed it was a crumb cake. I so wanted a crumb cake and was really looking forward to this being done! As another reviewer said, the strussel topping does melt mostly right into the cake. It creates a thin crisp sugar cooking on top. I wanted a soft strusel. Other reviewers said their cake was hard or biscuit like. Mine was quite sweet, but was very moist. I can only assume their baking powder was not effective. The cake was pretty good, but the thin, sugary, crispy, unattractive coating just made it mediocre.

Whoa this is so good!  I followed the recipe for the batter, except I baked it in a 9x9 pan for a thicker cake.  For the topping, I doubled it and used half white and half brown sugar.  I baked the cake at 325 for 10 minutes, then sprinkled the topping on ( I only ended up using about 3/4 of what I made, I froze the remainder).  I baked for another 15 minutes then bumped the temp to 350 for another 20 minutes.  Turned out perfectly moist and the topping had that nice crunchiness to it.

An easy to make, classic coffee cake. To reduce the amount of fat in this cake, I used 1/2 cup canola oil instead of butter in the batter. I also used brown sugar in the streusel instead of white. Other than that, I followed the recipe closely. The streusel did sink into the cake and was not quite enough to cover the 9x13". Next time, I would use a smaller pan, maybe 9x9 or 8x8 as I would prefer a thicker cake. The streusel topping would also go on top perhaps in the last 5 to 10 mins or so, so it doesn't sink. As described by Mary, a good Sunday morning coffee cake for sure for its ease of making and for having such a classic taste and look!

I made extra topping using equal parts white/brown sugars. I was low on milk so sub'd 1/2 &1/2, as well as adding a few dashes of cinnamon in the mix. Def used a smaller pan!! Did a powdered sugar icing to top it off. increased baking time to 30 min. Perfecto!

This cake was more bitter than I expected. Not sure what happened to the batter, but it tasted like too much flour or baking powder was in it. I took other people's advice about the streusel and put it in after the cake finished baking. The streusel was delicious though! I would make it gain with a bit more sugar and vanilla extract though!

This comes together very quickly, which was just what I needed.  I had some tree trimmers show up at 7:30 am and I had it out to them by 8:20.  And the taste and texture are really great.  I subbed some plain yogurt for milk to increase the moistness.  So I most likely had more than a cup of moist ingredients - sorry, just eye-balled it until I had a spoonable batter.

I changed this recipe up quite a bit since I had an apple that need to be used and I did not have any all-purpose flour. I substituted the all purpose flour for the batter with 1.5 cups oat flour, 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup rolled oats. For the crumble top I used whole wheat flour. 

I poured half the batter into a 9x12 ceramic pan, then sprinkled 1 chopped up apple over the batter (cut into small, 1/4 inch chunks), I also sprinkled some raisins, brown sugar and a titch of cinnamon over the apples. I mixed 1/4 cub of fat free vanilla yogurt with the remaining batter and poured over the top of the apples. I topped with the streusel (which did melt) and baked at 350F for 34 minutes. DELICIOUS!

Best Coffee Cake ever.  My only change was to add more flour to the topping to stretch it out because my margarine is less than stellar.  Still, it was fantastic. I can't wait to make it with real butter. We may all fall into comas of joy!

I enjoy making coffee cakes on Sunday mornings for my family.  This morning I wanted a quick and easy one to throw together, that didn't include a cake mix (trying not to eat stuff with preservatives), and found this recipe.  Though this recipe is easy to throw together, it has a rough texture. The topping is off looking (needs brown sugar), and it seems almost greasy when you first take it out of the oven.  The flavor is okay, but I won't be making again.

Very good, needs a larger streusel to batter proportion, or I'd have given 5 stars.  Nice texture and wonderfully fast to put together.  Try it w/lemon zest & dried blueberries in the batter.

This is a great, easy coffee cake. I baked this according to specifications exactly (except I did use brown rather than white sugar in the topping) and it came out delicious. I even used the 9x12 pan (and thought it was going to be a mistake). It rose beautifully. I'll make this again for sure.

Wow, I have never made coffee cake before and this was amazing.  I didn't have any vanilla so i shredded a granny smith apple and put that in for some sweet and tart falvour.  It worked great, will make this again.  *update*  I have made this cake several times now and although I have been adding the vanilla I still add a shredded apple.  The one time I made it without the apple my hasband said he thought it was missing something.  I added the apple the next time and he and the kids thought it was better.

VERY good!  I followed the recipe to the letter except that I baked it in an 8 x 8 pan so that it would be taller.  Because of this, I had to increase the baking time a bit (about 5 mins), but it came out tall, light and fluffy, and oh so delicious!

Definitely a a keeper!  Thanks!

I made 2 changes and it came out perfectly! Instead of 2/3 cup of white sugar in the topping I did 1/3 cup each of white and brown sugar. Also, I baked it in a 8x8 pan for 45 minutes. This is a recipe I will definitely bake again!

I turned this into an almond coffee cake. It was wonderful!! I did 1/2 white flour and 1/2 almond flour. For the streusel, I added chopped almonds, a bit of nutmeg, and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I sprinkled the top with almonds, as well. I put half the streusel in the middle and half on top. I also baked mine in an 8x8 as I think a 9x13 won't make a thick enough cake. This is fabulous traditional coffee cake recipe and a great basic to go by when experimenting with other varieties. Thank you!

Awesome recipe! SO GOOD! The only change is that we baked it in a 9" circle pan because there wasn't enough batter for the 9x13. It seriously could've come out flat. We didn't modify the ingredients at all. We baked it at 30 minutes before checking it to see it was done using a toothpick. We baked it again for 5 minutes but now it's *slightly* dry. We should've taken it out maybe 2-3 minutes after we put it back in but ovens vary. Just keep a close eye on it. SO GOOD!

really yummy...just needed to add 2 tsp more of cinnamon to topping (personal preference) and perhaps would use brown sugar instead of white there next time.

Great basic recipe. I made this for my boyfriend to take to a potluck at work and he said it was a huge hit. I doubled the recipe and used a different recipe for the streusel topping (using 1/2 cup brown sugar packed, 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 cup butter) then after the cake cooled for 15 minutes, I drizzled it with an icing made up of confectioners sugar and milk. The only thing I would do differently next time is maybe substitute the milk for something thicker like sour cream or yogurt- the cake part was not as moist as I expected it to be. Other than that, it was a great recipe!

I made this for the first time today. I followed the recipe completely, except I used a 9 inch round glass pan. I refrigerated the topping over night so that it wouldn't melt into the batter. I added the topping about 10mins until the baking should have been done. When I took it out of the oven, it looked great! But after sitting on the counter for about 15minutes, I noticed that it sunk :( Even with baking it an extra 8-10 minutes it still must not have cooked all the way through. Next time I'll try making sure it's completely cooked before adding the topping, and just baking it another 10 mins until that is done. I'm eager to try it again :)

Great recipe! I put the topping on after baking it for 10 minutes.. I used a 9x13 pan and it took in  total 25-35 minutes to finish.  Be sure to let it cool completely before cutting and eating. 5 Stars from me!

This is delicious!  The recipe is one-two-three easy!  I can't believe how good this tastes, it's great to whip up when you need to feed your company.  Perfect for breakfast, lunch or after dinner! I followed the recipe exactly, except I add extra cinnamon in the strudel and a little bit in the cake.  I also bump up the measurements in the strudel to get more crunch on top!

VERY good! Delicious moist texture and flavor. I took advice from other reviewers and used a smaller baking pan. Someone also said it was a little dry so I added a small (4 oz) no sugar added applesauce cup to the batter. I added the streusel topping during the last 10 mins. of baking and it still turned a little "crispy".  This is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.  I will work on the streusel topping and make this again. yum!

I'm not sure what I did wrong here. I doubled the recipe and the topping melted all throughout the cake and crystalized on top. The actual cake part of this was good, but I had to scrap off the topping. Will not make this again.

Our family loved it.  We shared with a neighbor and made another one for the next morning.  We will definitely make it again.  We followed the recipe except that we used almond milk in place of milk.

Excellent coffee cake.  Having read all the reviews, I found it interesting that several people commented on how dry the batter was with I believe one person saying they had a dough ball to spread in the pan.  I had the exact opposite.  I carefully measured the flour, sugar, etc. and broke the egg into a measuring cup, beat the egg slightly and then added milk to the 1 cup mark.  Added the vanilla and poured it into the flour mixture.  The result was a very thin batter which easily poured into the pan.  I baked it in a 8x8 pan for 40 min.  I also had a problem with the streusel topping.  I probably overmixed it as it came out like paste so I just dropped bits of it all over the top which did melt into the top of the cake.  Will definately make again and see if any of my experiences with this one change.  Still a great coffee cake.

This was a simple recipe.  I made mine into cupcakes.  The only suggestion is to put the streusal mixture in the fridge or freezer.  That way you can break it up and it will be crumby.

This was so easy - what a great (QUICK) recipe!  I made an extra "1/2" recipe (alter the servings to 22 or 23, and use two small eggs or one really large egg for the 1 1/2 egg ingredient.  In a two cup liquid measure fill milk to 1 1/2 cups after adding the eggs).  The cake rose beautifully - perfect amount for the 9X13 if you add the extra 1/2 recipe.  And to avoid the "cutting in" of the butter, I grated it while cold into the dry mixes and used the paddle attachment on my mixer to finish incorporating.  Easy easy easy.  I did add some extra cinnamon to the batter (1 tsp) along with the dry ingredients.  I love that this recipe is all ingredients that I typically keep in my pantry!

This was a really good basic coffee cake.  It was difficult to get so little batter spread all the way to the edges in a 9x13, but I got it most of the way and it rose up beautifully and filled the whole pan.  The cake itself was just a touch on the dry side, and the topping recipe made TONS of streusel.  Next time I would definitely layer the topping and cake in a couple of layers (although I don't know how - the batter was spread pretty thin with just one layer!  Maybe I'll just halve the topping recipe...)  Anyways, good cake, we all enjoyed it for a special Saturday morning breakfast.  Also it came together fairly quickly so my impatient kids didn't have to wait too long! :)

Mmmmmmm this was really yummy! Though, just like everyone else, I think that a smaller pan should be used! It was delicious and everyone loved it!!

I added a T of cinnamon to the batter and baked in a 9x9, but a 9x13 would probably be better since it baked up really tall for me. Very good!

This coffee cake came out amazing! I followed some of the advice given by some of the other reviewers and waited until the last 10-15 minutes in the oven before putting the topping on the cake. I agree the topping was a little too buttery and slightly melted into the cake. I also had to bake the cake for a little longer than 30 minutes. Overall, this recipe was a success!

Fantastic - moist and sooo delish!  Accidentally put 1/2 cup of butter into the topping as well as the cake, and it still turned out great.  Made the topping first and popped it into the freezer while I made the rest.

Super recipe. I doubled the recipe, and put it in a bundt spring pan.  I also added the brown sugar to the streusel topping, as it gives it a nice, rich flavor.  Since with any bundt cake, the top is actually on the bottom of the pan, I placed a bit of the streudel on the bottom of the pan before adding the dough, and I put more in the center then added the remaining dough then cooked. Topping: I put the remaining streudel on after I had taken the cake out of the pan, and put the cake back in for a few minutes under the broiler to get it nice and crunchy.  Optional:  I added 1/4 cup of Disaronno (amaretto) liqueur to the cake batter after I added the 2eggs/1 cup milk to give the coffee cake a lovely almond infused flavor. Yummy!

Great recipe!! I was up late one night and got a sugar craving and found this recipe and made it and it was wonderful. I took the advice of some other reviews and cut the butter in the cumble topping down to three tablespoons and baked it in a 8x8 dish for 45 minutes and it was wonderful!!

Excellent recipe, and easy because it uses standard ingredients I normally have on-hand.  I made it per the recipe, but did adjust the topping with 1/3 c brown sugar and 1/3 c white as suggested--you really have to do that for the best streusel.  I also added the extra 1TB oil to the batter, because it is a thick batter.  Don't be worried, but you will see chunks of butter in the batter, and that helps make the cake lighter and more moist as they melt and steam in the cake.  I baked mine in an 8 x 11 pan for 33 minutes.  Didn't add the topping until after 20 minutes, just to be sure it wouldn't be too heavy on the top of the cake.  I baked it until the toothpick came out clean.  Is a quick bread, so don't expect it to be as sweet as a cake (even though the topping is), it is more like the texture of a muffin.  Wonder how it would be to add some pecans to the struesel.  Was PERFECT with sunday morning coffee.  Will definitely keep this one handy.  Nice and moist, light, sweet...exactly what I was hoping for.

Made this cake with very little modifications... Used 50:50 Brown and white sugar in the streusel.  The topping was plentiful, but I doubled the whole recipe. I also didn't put the topping on before baking, but instead I let it bake halfway through then layered the top with the streusel. Got good reviews here!

This crumb cake was so light, fluffy and moist! I followed the recipe exactly but baked in an 8x8 pan for 40 mins. I did not have any problems with the topping melting or sinking. I also think I had more than enough topping...maybe because I used a smaller pan than suggested? This recipe is worth the extra effort of using a pastry cutter! I also like that it calls for ingredients that I pretty much always have at home. Will definitely make again!

This was delicious! I am only giving it 4 stars because I made a few minor alterations. Following others' advice, I baked it in an 8" x 8" pan for about 40 minutes. I layered the streusel, half in the middle and half on top. Also, for the streusel I used 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar instead of all white. Next time I might double the streusel topping, but other than that it was perfection! I will definitely be making this for the holidays.

So simple and so delicious. I loved this recipe!  Loved that I could use everything I already had in the pantry, loved the wonderful texture of the cake, and the wonderful taste of the topping.  Thanks so much for posting this.  It's perfect to make when you realize that you're having company over soon but you don't want to run to the grocery.

This tastes exactly like a coffee cake I used to make when I was a kid. It was a recipe from a little booklet published by either Robin Hood or Five Roses flour in the late 60s or early 70s. Well, the recipe booklet disappeared years ago, and I've been searching fruitlessly ever since, until today! This is it. Found the recipe this morning and made it right away. The only difference is the topping. The old recipe said to drizzle melted butter on top of the batter in the pan, and then sprinkle a sugar and cinnamon mixture on top. I don't think this recipe is supposed to have a traditional streusel topping on it like other reviewers have stated. I think you're supposed to end up with the topping melting into the batter resulting in this crunchy glaze. Absolutely delicious!  I also used a 9" springform pan, and baked for 35 minutes, thanks for the tip!
PS - I love LucyDelRey's photo. It looks just like the old coffee cake I remember.

this is a perfect coffee cake...simple to make and simple composition that makes a good "go-with." Very moist and with an excellent texture.  followed the recipe exactly and turned out excellently.  You could make changes by adding nuts and different spices or fruit, but this is excellent as is....

this is great! i love how simple this cake was. i have to admit that next time i will try to put the streusel topping in the freezer for a couple of hours like somebody here suggested. otherwise it sinks in a little which isnt too bad either.

I give this a 5!!!! I changed a few things. In the cake mix and for the topping I used margerine. In the topping I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I baked in an 8x8 pan. I also layered half of the topping mixture in the cake. I adding topping in the last 10 minutes of baking. SO GOOD!!!!

This is a fabulous foundation recipe that you can make as is or change it up and it will still be great! I added 1/4 cup cocoa powder to the crumb topping, as well as an 1/2 tsp all spice, and I used light brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I do not drink milk, so I substituted coconut milk and added 1 1/2 tsp of rum extract as well as the vanilla.  Me, being a dumb , forgot the sugar in the batter, so I added the extra sugar on top and let it melt in.  What resulted was AMAZING! The whole plate was gone in 6 hours.

The cake was good. I followed others suggestions and subbed half of the white sugar for brown sugar for the streusel topping.  For extra flavor, I added cinnamon extract to the cake. I also baked the cake in an 8x8 pan for 40 minutes. I didn't put the topping on until the last 10 minutes of baking, which prevents it from sinking into the cake. A 9x13 pan is way too large for the amount of batter. If a 9x13 cake was used, you would have a really thin cake. The 8x8 pan was the perfect size and I didn't need to double the topping.

Moist and delicious! I made exactly as directed, and the cake turned out perfect. Brought back memories of my Grandma Vera's kitchen as a child :) My family also loved the cake. We were happy with the thickness in the 9x13 pan...Next time I may try some of the variations by other users, but I am more than happy with the cake as is!!!

I made this recipe exactly as it was listed. Like many other users I would have to say to double the topping and made this in a 8x8 pan. I made this in the 9x13 pan the recipe called for and the cake was way too thin. It was still very delicious and my bf's little sisters ate half of the cake before dinner was even served!

Changed the topping to 2/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white, 1/3  cup butter.  Used an 8X8 inch pan, placed half the batter in the pan, then half the streusel, then remaining batter.  Baked for 15 minutes, added remaining streusel and baked for an additional  10-12 minutes.  Love this recipe!

I'm gonna have to try this recipe again. My cake tasted like glue...was a simple, but huge mistake: When I printed the recipe it didn't separate the 2 sections of ingredients. I had just enough butter to make a double batch. So when I was making the topping, the directions have all the measurments except for the butter. I looked up at ingredients and saw 1/2cup butter (1cup doubled) I remember thinking "really? ok." The topping crumbled ok, but was still pretty moist so I added more dry stuff. Then when making the batter it said to cut in the butter again, with no measurment. At this point I was pissed and knew I messed it up now seeing the 1/4cup butter ALSO listed in the ingredients. So my topping had 1 cup butter and my batter only had 1/2cup...yuk! The directions where it says to add the egg/milk mixture JUST UNTIL MOISTENED were a little unclear. I didn't know when to stop adding: just at moist was still a little crumbly. Had I had the correct amount of butter in the batter to begin with it may have gone alot more smoothly. BE SURE TO READ THE ENIRE RECIPE BEFORE YOU START ANY RECIPE!

Just found out tonight that I'll be having company for coffee in the morning and no sour cream on hand to make my usual coffee cake recipe.  Whipped up this cake in minutes with ingredients on hand.  I couldn't wait till morning to try it and I guarantee it does not disappoint! Moist and flavorful; for me a 9 x 13 pan was just right because the shorter cake  increases the streusel to cake ratio! :)  Hmm, a recent "expert" cook referred to this cake as nasty.  I wonder on which planet she is an expert.

Not complex which is good in certain circumstances.  I didn't have a pastry cutter for the butter so it was difficult to get the topping the way it should have been.  From my novice experience, I added more butter to the topping which I think gave it a more crunchy texture.

Great coffee cake! I substituted canola oil for the butter and mixed the cake ingredients with a mixer instead of making crumbs - way easier this way. I also baked it in a 8x8 pan to get a higher cake. This one is a definite keeper.

I used 1 3/4 cups of cake flour and 1 tsp baking powder....this cake turned out super moist...the only thing I will do different next time will be to wait to add the topping until the last 10 minutes of cooking...thanks for the recipe

So delicious and extremely moist :)  I also had problems with the topping melting in the batter.  I would reccomend using a smaller pan too, and then its just the right depth.  I always use part white sugar, part brown, so I used 1/2 cup white, and 1/4 brown for the batter for extra moistness.

Very good! I was looking for a new coffee cake recipe... the one I usually use is a sour cream coffee cake, but I didn't have sour cream or walnuts on hand, so I used this.  It turned out very well - it tastes great! I added a bit of cinnamon to the batter as well, which was nice. Also, I ran out of white sugar, so I only used about 1/4 cup white sugar for the topping, the rest brown sugar, and entirely brown sugar for the batter. It turned out well - no problems because of the different kind of sugar.  Overall, it is super easy to make and very delicious!

Very good. I went with half brown half white sugar on the topping.  I will add more cinnamon next time on it.  I added the topping in the last 15 minutes.

Today I wanted to make coffee cake and went on a hunt for a recipe that I had all of the ingredients for... settling on this one... And it was delicious! I didn't use the streusel topping... and I added a bit of cinnamon to the mix... baking it in a bundt cake pan for 30 minutes and it turned out PERFECT! Great flavor and great consistency!

I will definitely be making this again.  I used a square pan, so I increased the baking time by about 10 mins to make up for the volume.  For the streudel, I used 3 tablespoons butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 1 tsp. cinnamon.  It turned out excellent!!

one of the best and easyest coffee cakes i have ever made. i followed the directions to the "T" and it came out near perfect. the only thing i did diferent was add 2 tablespoons of my favorite coffe to the toping mix and adjusted the moisture as nessary with more butter and put 1/2 on top before baking and the other 1/2 5 min. before it was done.

Overall this was a good cake, quick and easy to make from ingredients I keep on hand. The topping was not crumbly but it still tasted good. I will make this again but will make changes to the topping to get the right texture.

As suggested by other reviewers, I used 1/3 c brown sugar, 1/3 c white for the topping, and it came out great. I didn't have any problems with the sugar melting into the cake even when I placed the topping right away, and the cake was a lot more moist than when I waited till the last 10 minutes to place the sugar.

I've already made this recipe twice, and everyone loved it. I really appreciate how the ingredients are ones that you normally keep in stock, so it's something you can make anytime. It's very easy to prepare too. Thanks for a lovely recipe. =)

good, but the texture was a little off.  It was gobbled up at my family function though.  I added a couple tablespoons of ground coffee for flavor.

This was great! I have made it twice now and the second time I did mix about a tablespoon of the crumb stuff in the main mix and I liked it even more! Either way it was a yummy breakfast! I also love the  Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake from this site (submitted by Michelle Krzmarzick). :)

I loved this!  Very easy to make.  I don't mind the topping melting into the cake so much.  Next time I will sprinkle on towards the end of baking just to see what difference it makes.  I am adding this to my folder of favorties!

Yum!  Super tasty, dense and moist.  I used an 8x8 pan instead of the 9x13... Definitely not enough dough for such a big pan, and I cut the topping in half.  I like a little less crumble on top.  Otherwise, yum yum yum... My hubby loved it and it tastes a lot like my mom's!

This cake turned out tasty, but its was rather flat - as in maybe a half inch tall. It tasted great, but I don't think I'd make it again.

This is a good coffee cake. I felt it needed something extra so I drizzled chocolate on it for presentation. I also thought it looked like to little batter for such a large baking dish, so I used a heart pan that is probably only 9 inches. It worked out great. The flavor my fiance commented was like a thick cookie, only cake-like. I agree.

Wow! This is the best coffee cake I have ever made! At first, I was worried with how thick the batter was but it baked up beautifully. To me, this tasted like one of those old fashioned donuts with sugar icing. So amazing!

I just made this for about the 50th time and thought I should probably give it a review! I always double the amount of topping and use brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also bake it in an oversize pan. If you add blueberries or cinnamon chips or cinnamon to the batter it is even better! Thanks for this often used recipe!

Halfway into baking, I realized that I had used some specialty flour for making bread instead of all-purpose flour. I don't know how it changed the recipe, but it was still very very good. :)

This recipe was okay.  The cake itself had a wonderful crumbly texture, but the topping was too sweet and crunchy for my taste.  Although I would not make this again, I would recommend less picky people to give it a try.

Following the directions for this recipe I found that I would have liked a bit more cake for the size pan that it calls for.  Other than that, I found the coffee cake a little bit dry but all in all a great, quick, and satisfying treat.

Followed the recipe exactly with wonderful results.  Took a chance and made this for the first time for breakfast for my mother in law and it was so good that she seemed doubtful that it could be from scratch.  Does that mean she was questioning my cooking skills???  Will definitely be making this again.

I added oatmeal, walnuts & dried apricot to the streusel topping and it came out so well. I love that I didn't need sour cream, cream cheese or fruit to make this; I could make it with items in my own house!

This coffee cake is delicious! I took others advice and added extra brown sugar and white sugar (1/2 cup each) for the streusal and also added 1/4 cup more of milk, 3 tbsps of apple juice and 2 tsps of cinnamon to the batter. I also poured half the batter in and added some streusal and then poured the remaining batter on. I baked it in an 8x8 pan (took a lot longer). And also waited until the end to put the remaining streusal on top. It turned out really moist and very flavourful. It was a hit with my family! Thanks

I made this cake last night and it didn't turn out as a coffee cake at all.  it was tough and chewy even though i added more milk like the below person suggested.  I was SOO EMBARRASSED because i decided to choose to make this cake when the pastor came to visit as a fast dessert and boy did i feel AWFUL when he couldn't even cut his fork through the cake.  i am so mad about this because i left such a bad impression when all my other cakes have turned out wonderfully.

Doubled the topping as suggested, using all brown sugar. Try adding a cup of cinnamon chips to the batter. Loved the non-cakey texture.

I absolutley LOVED this cake.  It is a very light cake with a sweet, crunchy topping.  I took everybody's sugestions and split the 1/2 cup of sugar for the topping into 1/4 of sugar and a 1/4 of brown sugar and it turned out wonderful.  My brother is a fan of coffee cakes and this is by far his favorite!

I like to think that I am a good cook, but I know I'm a lousy baker.  Either this recipe is excellent, or I misjudged myself!  I followed others' recommendations and doubled the streusel topping and did not add it until the last minute.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter, like suggested.  However, in the batter mixture, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Also, I thought the batter was a little dry before I put it in the pan so, out of necessity, I mixed in about 2-3 T. of apple juice.  It was moist and had the flavor, sweetness, and that "something extra" that others said were missing.  And I don't even like coffee cake!

Wonderful old-fashioned recipe.  Reminds me of Cinnamon Flops.  Moist and delicious, easy to prepare.  My only change was I used half brown and half white sugar for the topping, and baked it in a 8 x 12" pan.  My husband and I both loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I took a previous reviewers suggestion and added cinnamon chips to the batter. I think this added a good taste, but could be achieved just as easily with regular cinnamon in the batter. I did use brown and white sugar in the struesal topping, but that is just because we like ours really sweet! I didn't add the topping until the last 10 minutes of baking and it got nice and crunchy. I took this to my mom's birthday brunch and it was the only thing that there was none left of! My dad (the coffee cake conisueur) said it was perfect!

This was really yummy. I used brown sugar in the topping and added 1/4 cup Hershey's cinnamon chips to batter. Also baked in 9x9 in. pan. Perfect size. I just increased baking about 10-15 min.until center was cooked. It was early in morning and I was half asleep when I made this and didn't notice it called for vanilla until I had it all mixed and ready to bake, It was still great! Cinnamon chips add alot of taste to this, maybe that's why van. wasn't missed. This is very similar to the Hershey recipe on this site. I don't think I would have enjoyed this as much without them. Without chips I think it reminds me of snickerdoodle kuchen. Delish! Thanks Mary!

Very good recipe.  Was easy and fast and tasty.  I would agree that more crumb topping with nuts would be best.  Goes great with coffee for sure. Yummy. I also made it with 1/3 brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar and it was just like Hostess!!

Great coffee cake that's not too sweet. I used a 9x9 pan, and used mostly brown sugar for the topping with some white sugar. Added a bit more cinnamon also to the topping. The topping melted into the cake, but the flavor was great. Maybe less butter in the topping next time, and nuts as suggested by others also sounds good.

I made this with my 12 year old son. This time I supervised him, and it turned out great. It was very easy. Next time, I will make the mix in a plastic ziploc, and add the wet ingredients later. It works real nice, when the kids want a last minute "luvin' from the oven".

Great stuff. Not too hard to make- I even  my added the butter last and it was fine. I topped mine with some cinnamon roll type frosting. Everyone loved, in fact my 2 year old devoured it!

Yummy! The cake is moist & fluffy. It's not too sweet, which is a good match for the crunchy sugar topping. Just a warning: the cake batter doesn't have too much volumn, but don't worry - it'll rise to about 1" tall. This recipe is so easy and doesn't require a blender; it's perfect for late night baking!

I chose this recipe because it was quick and easy and that it was!  It was tasty too.  But I will keep looking for another recipe because this one didn't have the rich dense texture I was looking for (it was rather fluffy) and as my son says, the inside is kind of bland.  

The topping was kind of soft.  I can see why reviewers say they put it in the last 10 minutes or that they put more flour, sugar to the topping to get more crumbly texture.

This cake tasted really good but it had a little to much butter in the toping for me I took out a tablespoon of the butter the next time I made it. You also may want to add more cinnamon cocoa powder or vanilla extract. To prevent the streusel melting into the cake I put mine in the freezer for an hour or two.

I followed the instructions exactly. Inserted toothpick, came out clean, but as you are eating it the cake seems undercooked because the butter from the crumble topping melted into the cake making it feel like the cake is still raw.

My family loved it. My daughter tries to be dairy free so I used almond milk and plant butter. Still delicious.  Also used brown sugar for the         topping.

Directions were not clear on the butter amount. I used in total 1/2 cup and divided it into 2 parts for the parts it says to cut in the butter. It does fill the 9x13 pan very shallowly but it rises to a decent size. The cake was moist and crunchy on top the next day. I would make again.

It was good. It was very buttery tasting. I used brown sugar in the strudel as opposed to white sugar. I also used an 8 X 8 pan. I left it in about 55 minutes, because it was a thicker cake. Next time, I'll leave it in for 50 minutes because the bottom and top was a little crispy. and I'll double the strudel only.  It was good, but I'd like to try another recipe that will knock my socks clean off!

I made this gluten free using Bob’s Red Mill All Purpose 1 to 1 flour. Oh my god. Oh my god oh my god oh my god. This is the best thing I’ve ever baked - gluten free or otherwise. I made it in a 9 inch round and it came out perfect. I add a touch of salt and do 50/50 white and brown sugar in the crumble - but otherwise, this is perfection. Perfection.

Made as directed until the streusel went on in which I added walnuts and blueberries. While the cake tested as done at 30 minutes, it was jellylike in the center of a 9X11 glass pan. I baked at 350 then added ten minutes. It looks ok. I'll let you know how the gang appreciated the effort (which wasn't much). This recipe might have been taught in my home ec. class in 1968. This was outstanding.

I thought this cake was quite good. Very easy. Mine came out a little crumbly - probably operator error. That said, it certainly wasn’t ruined, and it definitely was enjoyed.

Will totally make again. Also I used an 11x14 pan so I doubled the recipe. I used half the streusel before baking and then the other half with ten minutes left to bake. 
Was a hit, family made lots of yummy noises!! 
Thanks for sharing.

Followed recipe except added extra egg yolk for volume. Spreads rather thin in 9x13 pan but turned out fine.  No problems with strusel topping.  Baked 350, 25 minutes.
Very nice coffee cake.

Turned out pretty good, it's mostly the recipe itself that threw me off. Next time I'll add more cinnamon too.

Doubled the recipe. Made the cake as is but adjusted topping according to another review. It took a long time to bake, but it turned out great. Moist cake and crispy topping.

I made it yesterday for breakfast today. Per other reviews I added lots of nuts and brown sugar to the crumb mixture. I put half of the crumb mix minus the nuts in the middle and half way through baking  added the rest. I used a 13 x 9 pan. The cake rose nicely and looked great. Per other reviews it is very crumbly but tasted good.I also found making the cake frustrating having to cut in the butter. Why not just cream it in with the sugar like other cake recipes.

The only thing I did differently was to use my stand mixer instead of cutting in the butter by hand for the cake batter. I used my hands for the topping....Delish! The entire cake was gone in 2 days --- and there are only 3 of us!

Quick and easy to make, although I had to increase the cooking time as I didn’t have the right tin size...  would probably use a little less sugar in the streusel next time. Didn’t stop the family from enjoying it!

I followed the recipe exactly for the cake except I used a slightly smaller pan so it was a bit thicker. I followed one of the other reviewers recommendations for doubling most of the topping. (Though that was a little heavy on the brown sugar for me, so I’ll reduce that portion next time.) I also put the topping on about 3/4 of the way done to avoid the sinking issue people had. Came out perfect.

I made this just as the directions say, except I took others suggestions and added the crumble AFTER the cake had cooked.
This tastes just like my grandmother used to make and my family loves it!!

This is delicious, but the better is more of a spread into pan than a pour. Also, I’d use a 7 x 11 pan. I’m always hard pressed to make the batter spread over 9 x 13. Otherwise, this is a big hit in my house.

I am rating this low bcz I feel like  the recipe was written backwards or something. I thought since I was making the streusel first that the first items on the recipe list were for the streusel and so i wanted to double the whole recipe and now i have a mess that i am trying to fix-hopefully it tastes great!
Review #2- i had bake it an extra 2o minutes but the cake turned out pretty good-very moist-i forget the vanilla so i am not sure how much that affected the taste. i would make it again and be more careful about reading the recipe (i added another star)

This coffee cake is my go-to quick weekend treat. I've made it three times now based on the directions and it's delicious! I know it looks like there won't be enough batter to fill a 9x13 pan, but I promise it will fluff up perfectly in the oven (see photo).

Huge hit!  This will not last in my house long.  It came out really good.  I let it cool a little and tried it when it was still warm.  We then had another piece after it cooled, I think it tastes better cooler.

I made this awesome coffee cake.  Came home from work.  Had unplanned company.  Threw it together in minutes.    Honestly one of the best cakes I've ever made and I bake alot !   Omg.   Followed the recipe to the T.   Except 9x9 for 35 minutes.  Sinful

Ok ... I made it again tonight   "Slamming"  I thought maybe the first time was a lucky fluke.   This recipe is a keeper forever !

Thank You so much for this recipe,Mary!!!!!!!!!!! We loved it!     We never ate  any other coffee cake so scrumptious! The refrigeration of the streusel  for 24 hours helps it not to sink into batter. If you want a thicker coffee cake use a 8x8 pan.

The cake tasted fine. I made  the mistake of using room temp butter so the topping was not exactly a crumb. Wish it had stated firm or cold butter. I was planning to make cookies (hence the softened butter) but my better half wanted coffee cake instead

This crumb cake is delicious! I baked them instead as 12 muffins. The crumb on top came out extra crispy which I loved. The cake is super moist. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I wanted it to be thicker and wanted to try adding blueberries. So, I spit the batter between 2 loaf pans and stirred in 1/2 cup blueberries to 1 of the pans before putting on the streusel. Both the regular and blueberry versions are equally delicious! They needed about 25 minutes at 350°.

This was very good. I cooked it in my 8x8 pan and I did split the topping and put half inside and half on top. The part on top was still dry looking after cooking so I'm thinking of putting on some butter.  I will make this again.

Definitely will make again, this coffee cake was delicious.  Everyone loved it and it makes 'just enough'.  I did follow reviewers' suggestions to add the crumble in the last 10 minutes of baking and adding a bit of cinnamon to the cake portion.  Perfect!

Exactly what I was looking for!  Made it in a 8x8 and layered the crumb. I did make double the crumb because I'm all about the crumb.  Baked for 20 minutes then put crumb topping on to finish for another 10.

Basically went with the recipe. Only change - 9x9 pan which I noticed a lot of other people did the same, which increased baking time to around 35 minutes. I also added an additional 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.

I made this exactly to the recipe Ingredients.   I used a 9X9  inch glass pan. I spread 1/2 the batter first and added 1/2 the crumb topping over the entire surface. The added the rest of the batter,  carefully spreading it out and then added the rest of the crumb topping.  Mine was completely cooked in 45 min. The cake is like moist pound cake.

I think it needs less sugar in the streusel topping, but other than that, delicious and moist cake. Very well done! :) It was an awesome recipe that I'm glad my mom got me the ingrediants for. Super easy!

Made it and baked it about 35 minutes the cake did not turn Brown like other cakes. I was disappointed with the thickness of the cake but the cake was absolutely delicious. I didn't wait for it to cool and had a piece right out the oven. I loved it. Had 3 pieces with milk. Mahalo for sharing.

I made this cake and used an 8” square metal pan. I am lactose intolerant, so I used lactose free milk and coconut oil instead of butter.  For the topping I used clarified butter (milk solids removed) and sugar. It turned out great and everyone who ate it loved it. The only thing I would do differently the next time around, is to add more cinnamon and some nuts to the topping.

I made this coffee cake this morning. I doubled the batter for the 9x13. Kept the streisel topping same (did not double). Used brown sugar for streussel topping. Added the streussel after cake had been in for 25 minutes. Followed others advice to lower temp to 325, with the doubled batter and lowered temp, it was in the oven about 40 minutes. DELICIOUS! Family loved this treat.

I made this exactly as written and it turned out beautifully. While eating his piece, my husband told me three times how much he loved this and that it was possibly the best dessert he's ever eaten! That says a lot coming from him!!! I highly recommend serving this warm as it tastes even more delicious.

so great! i did add 2/3 cup oats to my streusel and it was great. i will definitely make this in the future.  i also made these as muffins and they were great too! they make about a 12- 16 muffins. I put about 2 handfuls of streusel on mine but I think I only had enough because of my addition of oats. I also melted the butter in both the streusel and batter and I found it much easier to mix

This has been my "go to" coffee cake recipe for years. I always add a 1/4 tsp of cardamom to crumb mixture. Sometimes I'll stir chocolate chips into the batter to make my kids happy.

Simple and easy to make, but not what I was looking for. The cake is delicious, but the topping is pure sugar and cinnamon. (What was my first clue??) Will search for more of an Entemann's-type topping. This is great if you want a fast and easy cake, and love a super-sweet topping.

I've made this cake 3 times so far. The first was for my sons Birthday Because he doesn't like icing. He loved it and so did everyone else. I make it now and wrap the slices individually for a grab and go snack or lunches. I followed the recipe exactly and it turns out great every time. Thank You:)

Like an earlier reviewer, I doubled the recipe to make it thicker, and baked it for 35 minutes.  I added more sugar and cinnamon to the streussel on top.  I also retyped the recipe, because the ingredients were not given in order that you mix them. Absolutely delicious, will use it as potluck contribution.

I made it as written; except I substituted granulated Splenda for the sugar. I made the substitution for both the batter and the topping. It worked well, I really liked this coffee cake!

Having read LOTS of the other reviews, I made the recipe in a 9" springform pan - made the crumb topping with 1/3 cup each of brown and white sugar, and added 2T extra butter.  I also added 2T extra milk to the cake.  I didn't hold off on putting the crumb topping on until later in the baking period - SO IT SUNK to the bottom.  I had cinnamon frosting to put on top, so it all worked out.  The crumb topping made a nice crust on the bottom.  Will probably make again and put vanilla cream cheese frosting on top.  Just happened to have cinnamon frosting I bought on clearance after Thanksgiving.

Very easy. I work in an adult foster care home and my guys LOVE this cake! It's super easy and doesn't take too long to get ready. I chop apples very small and add it to the topping. It's BOMB!!

I didn't have sour cream for my regular coffee cake recipe, so I thought I'd try this one because I had all the ingredients. It was ok when first baked but a little on the dry side after it cooled down.   I don't think I will try it again but if I do I think I'll take others recommendations and add more milk or something. There are better coffee cake recipes out there.

I don't like coffee........But the cake? I love! My mom&dad love too! Just one thing don't put real Coffee in it because then the kids can't have any! Just try to put a nice coffee taste not real coffee. Some people I know love to put real coffee in it! And because of it I hid it every time from my friend's kids and I don't  want to do that!

I read some of the comments and decided to make some alternations based on the reviews.  First, I doubled the recipe (turned out a much thicker cake).  Next, changed the sugar in the streusel to 3 parts brown sugar, 1 part white sugar and also put the streusel in the frig to chill while making the cake.  Lastly, after I spread the streusel, I used a knife to swirl some of the topping inside the cake.  That really helped with keep it from being bland.   I also made this gluten free using my favorite gf flour blend.  Sometimes converting regular flour recipes to gf will result in a more dry cake.  But not this one.

We made minor changes to the topping which was doubled except for the amount of cinnamon and we subbed brown sugar for the white.  Otherwise we made as directed.   Everyone eating was smacking their lips and saying "Oh, my God."  Good old-fashioned goodness in this one!  It is saved to my collection.  Update:  We made this again with the double topping and added a few oats to that this time.  I did not have baking powder on hand so I mixed all the other ingredients up plus 1 tsp of vanilla to make the batter.  To  a small bowl I added 2 tsp of baking soda and 4 tsp of lemon juice and stirred until just bubbly.  This bubbly mixture was quickly incorporated into the batter by folding. The final result had perfect lift and perfect texture.  We made it in a spring-form pan and it did take 40 minutes to bake.  Moist, delicious, wonderful once again.

The cake was delicious! I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and made the struesel equal parts flour, white sugar, and brown sugar. I also mixed it like you would normally when baking making the wet and dry ingredients separate then adding together at the end. I baked it in an 8x8 and baked at 350 for 50 minutes. It was delicious! Only change I would make is putting some of the struesel topping in between layers of the cake batter since it is so much cake in an 8x8. But will definitely be making this again!

I agree with other bakers regarding not to overmixed the batter and the instructions can be a little bit more clear.  I couldn't follow the instructions until after reading about 8 bakers' comments.  I like the cake's texture, its lighter than some coffee cake I've had, but I do miss the taste of cinnamon in it. As for the crunchy top, I would prefer it having a little bit more flour. I think the ratio can be adjusted to personal tastes.  I used all the brown sugar for the topping after reading other peoples comments.  I think the white sugar and the butter might be what causes it to sink into the cake. My cake did cracked, but since I followed one baker's suggestion to put the topping on in the last 10 minutes, the topping covered the crack.  To remedy topping, I added some  almond meal to make it more nutty and crunchy.  I noticed that this type of cake taste better the day after so I will try again tomorrow and see how the cake taste overall.

Made  one change,  used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the 3/4 cups it calls for, trying to cut down on the sugar. Baked it at 350 for 25 minutes, the topping was crispy on the edges. Next time I will double the batter and bake it at 325.

So I made a huge mistake, but it turned out just fine!! I accidentally skipped cutting butter into the batter - and poured the milk/egg right in. Dangit!! So I ended up just mixing that 1/4C butter, mixing the strussel into the batter, and baked for 30min in a 9x9". I was sure it won't work, but it did! Had the same delicious taste but a different cake consistency and much less messy. Moral of story: don't throw your mistakes out, use your smarts and try to fix them! Sometimes it works out :)

This was a big hit at our house. I had no problems with consistency or sinking toppings. I did chill my topping to make it more crumbly and decreased the pan size to 9x9. I refrigerated leftovers in single serve containers to retain moisture. Very tasty, even on the third day. If it weren't so high in cslories, I'd probably make it weekly.

This is the first from scratch cake I have made. The recipe was simple and easy to follow. I listened to a few other reviewers and used 1/3c brown sugar instead of 2/3c of white sugar for the topping and used a 9" round pan. It took 35 minutes to completely  bake. Came out great! Thanks to all the ladies leaving reviews! It helped this newbie make Mother's Day a little more special!

I made it twice.  First time as per instructions.  Baking time was a little longer in my oven.  It was really good.  The second time I made it as coffee-cup-cakes and it was fantastic.  Baking time was more accurate then.

The cake was very moist and my guests asked for seconds! However, I think I'll add more cinnamon next time, to add a bit more flavor.  I made 1.5 times the streusel recipe for more streusel topping.  To prevent the streusel topping from melting into the cake, add it in the last 20 or less minutes.  The topping is a bit more crunchy-candy-like than it is crumbly, but it's good.  Delicious, easy-to-make, and gone quickly.  As written, it makes a small square cake or 1 loaf pan, about 6 servings. Definitely try it!

I did read several reviews for this coffee cake and was a little worried since people made a lot of changes.  I made the recipe as written in a 9x13 pan.  I baked it for the amount of time listed and added my topping the last ten minutes of baking.  My coffee cake turned out perfectly!  Using the 9x13 will obviously make a thinner cake, but that's fine with me.  The topping created a nice crispy coating.  We loved it!  Will be making it many more times!

A fairly neutral tasting cake that I felt needed something. I'm glad I added cinnamon to the base and increased the streusel. IMHO it still needs more cinnamon.

Awesome recipe!   It comes out very tender and moist.   I did change a few things.   For the topping I only used 1/4 cup of butter,  added a pinch if Salt,  and used brown sugar instead of white sugar.   For the batter I added about a 1/2 tsp cinnamon and about 1 1/2 TBSP buttermilk powder.   I also used a 8x8  pan, reduced the temp to 325°F, and baked it for about 50 minutes.   I wanted it to be a bit taller.   It came out GREAT!

I made this recipe on a whim - had a friend coming over and just had to throw something in the oven to impress.  The picture is not very flattering, but the coffee cakes were to die for!!!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe :)

I prepared the streusel, and then I prepared two separate batches of the dough for the cake. (Yes, it is more like dough than batter, and I don't like doubling things the first time I try them.) I carefully spread both batches of the dough into my 12x17" jelly roll pan. I baked it for 30 minutes and the toothpick came out clean. This is for a big group, so I was going for a sheet cake type coffee cake.  Some reviewers said it was not sweet enough, so I prepared a simple glaze to drizzle on before I cut it. The texture was exactly what I was going for. It was a hit!

This turned out amazing...moist middle...and the crumble..perfect...the only thing I did different was melt the butter in the microwave for the batter and the topping...this it's the way I do it and it makes a crumble..plus it's easier for me to just stir it...then cut it in....and I ask Holy Spirit to make it delicious..and He is so kind to do so...thank you for the recipe.

I have made this a number of times in a number of different pans ... loaf, square, angel food, and quiche ... and all turn out simply lovely.  Cooking  times may vary.  This does not have a lot of redeeming value of course, but has simple ingredients most of us have in our house and is a tasty treat with a warm cup of coffee.

I made a vegan version of this and it was delicious! I used almond milk, earth balance, and ener-G in place  of their dairy counterparts! Turned out great!! My only comment is that some other mentioned that it's not a lot of batter for the 9x13 pan. It still worked, but just thin. I would've used an 8x8 and made it a little thicker!

Just made this cake. It is thin, but very delicious. Follow the recipe as is. I will remake this cake again but will try in a smaller pan as I prefer a thicker coffee cake but other than that, I would not change a thing. Thank you!

I've never left a recipe review before, but I made this coffee cake this morning and it was quick, easy, and delicious!  It is a light and fluffy coffee cake with a slightly crispy browned crumbly topping. It made my whole house smell amazing! The only additions I made to the recipe was to add about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the dry ingredients. It would be scrumptious without it, but I couldn't help but punch up the warm flavors. I highly recommend this recipe. Yum!

I read a review that one found this to be a bland coffee cake, so i changed it up a little and made it like a marble style. I took out about 1 cup of the batter and added cinammon and sugar and then plopped it on top of the regular batterand swirled it around with the end of a spoon. This added magnificent flavor and also made the cake very moist. Loved it! Will surely share the recipe with my friends and make it again. And again. My son loves to have it for breakfast. ...if it doesn't all get eaten the nighr before!

I don't have a 9x13 pan and after seeing some of the comments indicating it didn't get very tall I tried to use a 7x9 glass  pan. It got plenty tall in that but I ended up baking it for almost an hour as it was still gooey in the middle and the struesel stuff got way too dark. My fault. I followed the recipe exactly except for the pan size. I thought the cake part was a little bland too. I dunno, it just needs something, needs to be more cake-like and less bread-like,  tastes like a hippy cake. I'd make it again if it were the last coffee cake recipe in the world but since it's not I think I'll try another one next time. Much better than no coffee cake at all though :) .

EDIT: I have to admit I made this recipe because I had everything in the house to make it. No non-stocked ingredients so I'm going to add an extra star for simplicity and the truth is I probably *will* make it again the next time I'm dying for a goodie and all the other recipes require things I don't have, lol.

This cake was moist and delicious. It didn't look like much batter when I poured it in the pan, but it rose perfectly. There was an ample amount of streusal for the topping! I will definitely add this coffee cake to my regular breakfast rotation. My husband and daughter raved about it. I did add a dash of powdered sugar before serving, just for fun!

Wanted to make dessert with ingredients I had on hand, and this fit the bill.  It came out delicious!  Followed the directions exactly, except I only had one stick of butter , so I used margarine in the cake and butter in the topping.  The topping kinda sunk in some places for a bumpy top, but making a lovely ribbon of  struesel running through some slices.  I like alot of crumb on top, so I was thinking it wouldn't be enough but it was just perfect.

My boyfriend LOVED IT and I didn't like it at all..  weird how a cake can be so polarizing. I have to agree with the negative reviews but I give it 4 starts because I made it for my boyfriend so it served it's purpose. I say try it and find out for yourself. :)

Made them as muffins and didn't change a thing. Two recommendations: 
1. Use a food processor for the crumble and cake (before the liquid ingredients)
2. Use salted butter

Muffins took 25 mins at 350°F.

Good cake but wish it was thicker.
I should have read the reviews first but overall impressed! Definitely wish I had a pastry knife for the ease of cutting in all the butter.

Made exactly as per the recipe.  I suggest you do yourself a favor and use a food processor; I had never cut butter into a recipe before, and I learned my lesson making the topping.  The batter is really thick, and it looks like it won't be enough to fill a 9x13 pan, but it does, you just need to spread it out with a spatula.  If you like your cake really thick use a 9x9 pan.  It didn't brown on top as I'd expected, so I wasn't sure it was done, but it passed the toothpick test - and turned out perfect!

This has been the best bread I've ever made! So moist and the bread was sort of fluffy. But I recommend this to anyone! Even beginners.  I'm 14 years old and I made it!

The recipe was more like dough, rather than batter and that concerned me. It turned out fine though. Flavor is just sweet enough for a morning bite. I will be making this again, perhaps adjusting the vanilla, as the cake was a tad bland.

This recipe makes a fabulous cinnamon crumb coffee cake!  It tastes delicious and did not take long at all.  However, the recipe is a little vague and confusing.  But now that I have worked out the kinks, I will definitely make this again

I made this recipe and tweaked it slightly by adding an extra 1/4 cup of flour and one egg yoke and also doubled the amount of cinnamon and added a pinch of salt to the streusel. I have to say that it was the best coffee cake that I have ever tasted. Thanks so much for the idea of cutting in the butter instead of melting it, made the cake so light and airy it was truly delicious!

My family loved this recipe. I took into consideration some of the comments and added cinnamon and dark chocolate chips to the batter (to make it sweeter and give it more flavor) and I added vanilla to the streusel topping. I would also recommend lowering the temperature to 325 and cooking it for about 15 minutes longer. I put the topping on and then baked the cake. So the topping did melt a bit (but it was still delicious). We had guests over and the coffee cake was totally demolished by the end of the day. My husband has never had coffee cake before and loved it. Definitely a great tasting recipe!

I have been making this as my "go to" dish for every brunch for 9 years! My kids beg for it, it is truly amazing.
I have a question though? Has anybody tried making this as muffins? Would I need to change anything? Just thinking

Ridiculously tasty & moist.  Doubled recipe for thicker cake in 13x9 pan. Changes: more milk...1.25 c milk including egg (instead of 1 c including egg); used 1/4 c white and rest brown sugar in streusel topping; added a cinnamon sugar layer (more cinnamon than sugar) between 1/2 of batter; topped with other half of batter and streusel. Baked at 350 for about 45-50 mins. By far, the best crumb cake I've made.  Thank you Aunt Anne!!

I read all of the Comments and I baked the cake for almost 45min.  I also used a 9x9 pan.  10 minutes prior to completion I sprinkled the topping on the cake.  I used 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar along with the 1/4 cup of butter and cinnamon for the topping.  Delicious cake for our first time use.   A little bit generous on the vanilla and salt.

Read a bunch of reviews before I made this one.  Decided to make it in an 8x8 pan and layer half of the topping in the cake and half on top.  I also used half brown sugar and half white in the topping.  I'm making this for a third time in as many months because my bff keeps asking me to bring it to our monthly brunch.  I like this cake because its easy to make and I always have the ingredients on hand.  Everyone else likes it because it is so moist and delicious!  Thanks Aunt Anne for a great recipe!

Just what I was looking for, DELICIOUS ! Made it exactly from recipe no adjustments.  Didn't think there was enough batter for 9x13 pan but it came out perfect. Topping melted into cake, I kind of like it better like this.

Good, but the cake part turned out a bit dry for me. Some folks love it like that; they say it goes better with coffee that way. I enjoyed the extra crumb topping that someone else suggested.  I made it by following the suggestion to increase the amount of crumb topping by using 1/2 CUP OF FLOUR, 1/2 CUP OF WHITE SUGAR, 1/2 CUP OF BROWN SUGAR, and doubling the cinnamon.  Used the same amt. of butter for the crumb topping.

I didn't make the streusel; just the cake. It was rather bland on its own, but dipped in mocha cappuccino, it's great!

The reviews are helpful. I used a 9 x 11 inch pan and baked the cake for 15 minutes before adding the streusel and it turned out great!

I had some leftover haroseth that we made for a VBS lesson and didn't want it to go to waste. I thought it would make a great topping for a coffee cake so I tried it out. I followed the cake recipe and altered the topping a little adding about 2 cups of the already prepared haroseth (apples, cinnamon, walnuts and a tablespoon of sugar) to the mixture. It looks, smells, and tastes deeeelicious!

Perfect! I used an 8x8 pan, cold butter and half of my sugar was white sugar.  Just the right sweetness. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe.  The only things that I changed was in the streusel topping instead of using white sugar I used brown sugar and instead of putting it in a 9x13 inch pan I used two 9 inch round cake pans.  It came out moist and delish and my family love it!!

I started out by reading through a few of the reviews. I decided to use 1/2C Flour and 1C Brown Sugar with the 1/4C Butter that was originally called for. I chose to multiply the batter recipe 1.5X to make it thicker, and because of all of the reviews about the streusel melting, I chose to bake it at 375 degrees like other coffee cake recipes I have used. I believe that the combination of using all brown sugar (instead of all white or 1/2 & 1/2) plus increasing the temperature did the trick, because my streusel didn't melt. The cake was moist and delicious and everybody loved it. I will use this recipe again.

I was looking for a replacement for a coffee cake mix that is too hard to find.  This recipe came very close and was very tasty.  Moist and not too sweet.  I used an 8x8 pan which I recommend.  Also, I used a mix of brown and white sugar for the topping.  I will use all brown sugar next time.  I will definitely make this regularly.

My family just polished off half of this wonderful coffee cake while it was still warm!  It is scrumptious- only change I made was DOUBLING the amount of "topping" that I used.   Yes I know it is sinful- but I do believe it made a difference for my family- as we drink very strong coffee and the sweetness is a great balance!

This recipe is really quick and easy if you just need to bring something good to a party. I especially like how spare it is--most of this stuff you'll just have around the house.
I made little coffee cake cupcakes. It makes about 18 cupcakes and you want to put about one generous spoonful in each cup and bake for 25 minutes. A lot of people really enjoyed it! If you have cocoa powder and a bit of powdered vanilla, I'd add them to the crumb topping...you don't have to, but it makes a really subtle-yet-nice difference.

I wish this recipe had the ingredients listed in the correct order.  It's a little confusing when you list the same ingredient twice in a recipe but in wrong order.  So.... Needless to say I messed the recipe up a bit and put 1/2 cup butter in crumble mix and 1/4 cup in cake.  I don't know how it happened but it turned out great! Go figure.

I only gave this 3 stars because made as is, it is really flat (3/4") tall.  After making it I went back and read reviews where users say to make in an 8x8 pan rather than a 9x13".  I shouldn't have to read reviews to learn how to make it correctly. It tastes great and I would make it again, but not as printed!  Make in a 8x8" or have an embarassingly flat cake!

Found this recipe when I was craving coffee cake one morning and have made it many times since. This is a great coffee cake just as is but it's so easy to customize! I like to add a pinch of cinnamon to the batter and when it's ready to pour into the baking dish, I pull out about a cup and mix in a good amount of cinnamon to swirl in the regular batter. Easy to add the spices of your choice, or fruit, or whatever. I also double the topping (personal preference) and use a 9x9 pan for a thicker cake. 

Turns out wonderful every time and my husband always gets excited when he wakes up and sees this in the oven.

New Note: Our blueberry tree provided me with plenty of blueberries to bake with.  I made this recipe and covered the top with the blueberries, then sprinkled sugar and butter chunks over that. So, good!  This is such a great recipe and anything you add to it makes for a great treat. June 2014

I searched allrecipes for a coffee cake recipe that didn't call for sour cream (which I didn't have) or fruit (which I also didn't have), and finally found this one.  I made it just as written only used the topping from another reviewer of 1/2 C. Flour, 1/2 C. Sugar, 1/2 C. Brown Sugar, with the same vanilla and butter amts. as called for in the recipe.  It baked up beautifully, and tasted wonderful.  This will take the place of my long lost go-to coffee cake I really loved. Thanks to Mary for posting this delicious cake.

This has been my family's all-time favorite breakfast for as many years as it's been published!  I just forwarded it to my eldest Son's wife as he has been missing this cake since getting married (LOL)! It has never turned out badly and I have varied it sometimes using brown sugar for the topping and I usually add a pinch of nutmeg in the streusel.  I have reviewed it before but just wanted to update things since I have a hard time understanding how anyone could not like this cake (I know, everyone has their own tastes - we can't all like the same things)! If the batter comes out a little too thick for your liking just add a little more milk till you like the consistency. One thing, I always use real butter - never margarine, since that contains water and just does not substitute well in any baked goods.

Made no changes and got plenty of compliments from the party. Even though I didn't cook it all the way through (sorry!) Thinking of trying some of the suggestions, like adding cinnamon or other spice to the batter. Also would like to see if they can hold up if cooked in a muffin tin and tossed into the lunchbox. I'd love one of these with the morning cup of coffee that doesn't get to happen until i get to school.

This recipe was GREAT the first time I made it... But IDK what I did the 2nd and 3rd times... It was awful after the first time! I don't know if if changed something to make it good on the first round, or if I've just been messing up after that... But I will find another recipe for Coffee Cake.

This coffee cake is delicious, but I must say that it took WAY longer then 25 minutes in the oven. The oven was on 350 degrees and after 30 minutes of it not being done i finally had to turn up the temperature to 400 degrees and it finally finished after 10 minutes.....I would recommend starting at at 400 and just keeping an eye on it

This cake turned out AWESOME!!! Didn't look like enough batter for a 9x13 pan, but I still used it and I'm glad I did, it turned out perfect. I did use 1/4 c butter, 1/2c flour, 1/2c sugar, and 1c brown sugar for topping and put in fridge. Add 10 mins before done.  I also added a little cinn and all spice to the batter. Other than that I followed the recipe. Great cake!!!

quick cake recipe, loved how much vanilla was in it! Streusel melted into the cake mixture (common problem with streusels). I compensated by opening the oven door after the 15 minute mark (golden rule of not disturbing the cake's environment - prevents sinkage)and added the streusel quickly. Ten minutes later cake was done and the streusel had survived as beautiful crumbles atop the cake! Next time I'll add more flour (coat the lipids of the butter), add streusel prior to oven baking, and hope the streusel doesn't melt again.

This is an extremely easy recipe and it came out perfectly.  The only thing I changed was the size of the pan - I used 8x11.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly how it was written.  My husband took the cake to work with him and his employees loved it.  Definitely making it again soon.

Simply delicious! I did bake this in a 9 x 9 glass dish as others suggested, but still made the same amount of topping and it was wonderful! I cut the sugar in the cake to 1/2c and just creamed it with the butter. Also added some spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg) and used brown sugar in the topping, which I sprinkled on the batter after topping it with pecan halves - baked up like pralines! Will definitely make again.

I have to agree with some of the other reviews that although this recipe is easy and quick, it was too dense. I added more milk because the batter was so thick, and I am not sure if it helped or made it worse, but the cake was edible. I also added walnuts which gave it a little extra touch but is coffee cake supposed to be this dense?

It was great :) came out awesome on the first try. I added 1/3 brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar like everyone recommends and a bit more butter. I added a bit of topping since it was going to melt in and then added the rest with 10 minutes left and it came out nice and crispy on the top and soft on the bottom,  I would totally make this again

This recipe is fantastic! A big hit in my house and with our neighbors. Last time around I altered the recipe to include jellied cranberry sauce as a topping and made a vanilla frosting to drizzle on the top. Amazing! Now I know what to do with all the leftover jellied cranberry sauce after the holidays.

Made the recipe as written, but as others have noted, it should be made in a smaller pan. I used an 8x8 and that was perfect. Very good basic recipe that you can dress up as you please.

Yummy! The texture of the batter is very dense. Made in a Bundt pan, so after inverting it, I sprinkled the streusel. It didn't stick! To be quite honest, the cake was amazing on its own without the streusel, but if I want it to stand on its own without the streusel, I'd probably add more sugar next time. The only changes I made were to mix brown and white sugar in the cake, and to add like half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Very easy and good. Will definitely make again and sprinkle the streusel either right in the beginning or halfway through.

Made in a 9 in round, its hard to tell when its done there is so much butter on top.  After 30 mins I took it out and thought it was sinking in the middle. Put it back in for few more mins. That was a mistake.  I say bake in 9 inch pan for 30 mins and it will be good.

This was perfect!!  Like others, I added brown sugar to streusel topping.  9X13 is perfect, the batter rises quite a lot as the cake bakes so it looks like it's not enough when you first spread it in your pan.  If you bake in a smaller pan you will have to increase baking time, and the edges will be dry.  Yum this was fantastic!  Thanks!

Perfect!  The whole family loved it!  I made this in a bundt pan and had to bake for 40 minutes, but it turned out fantastic.  I think next time I will cut the topping in half since I made it in the bundt pan and there is less surface to cover.  I took the another reviewer's suggestion and made the topping first and then put in the freezer while I did the rest.  Make sure the egg is at room temp to make the cake perfect.  You can also add in flavored coffee creamer in place of the vanilla and a tad bit of the milk.

Great coffee cake! I think the best thing about this recipe is that it didn't require any box mixes, so I had everything at home to make it. I took it out after 15 minutes and it was perfect. My boys and husband loved it!!

This was very good, however, how it is listed ingredient wise could of been a bit easier if listed in order of tad bit dry, we used a 10x13 pan and baked at 350 for 25 min, maybe next time I'll add a lil more milk.  Also since we love cinamon, we added some to the batter... we will make again!! Thank You!

Great recipe, exactly the coffee cake from my childhood.

The only thing I did differently was I used jumbo muffin liners as this for a bake sale.  This made 28 muffins.

Wonderful!  Good tips from comments:  smaller pan, go with more generous proportions for the topping and freeze the topping overnight.

I added more butter to the streusel just because I like a little bit of a crumbier topping. At first it may look like there isn't enough batter but the cake comes our the perfect thickness. This is one of the most delicious recipes I have tried!

Delicious. I followed other reviewers' ideas about doubling the streusel, and put it in a 9x9 pan. It doesn't last more than a day or two at my house!

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flower, and (because couldn't wait to taste) I used a muffin pan instead of the 9x13 pan. It made 12 good-sized muffins, and because I used the cake flour they came out extra fluffy and tender! I've been baking since I was a little girl, and this is by far the best coffee cake recipe I've come across!

I prepared and baked just as directed but pulled it out after the specified time and it was completely uncooked! Had to put it back in for at least 15 more minutes.

I love this coffee cake. It is delicious. I just cannot stop eating it. I always say that it'll be just for breakfast as a welcomed alternative to cereal, but it usually gets eaten after the second day. I would not make any alteration to the cake, but I do increase the topping yield, as I like the crumbly deliciousness on top and could eat that all day long.

Came out perfect!  My dream coffee cake.  Followed directions, except I put crumbs in freezer until last minute because one of the reviews said that they melted.

This made a good coffee cake, but definitely not my favorite.  I put the batter in an 8x8 pan and sprinkled some of the topping in the middle.  It turned out fluffy, but a bit dry.  Overall a good, but not great coffee cake.

A very yummy, simple coffee cake.  I made it as directed, but used a 8x8 pan instead so that it would come out thicker.  Just the right amount of topping.  Baked for more like 40 minutes since it was so thick.

This was the first time I tried making a coffee cake and it came out great! I did sprinkle cinnamon over the top of the streusel just before I popped it in the oven.

Great as is - ignore comments. In a 9x12, it didn't cover the bottom, but I spread it out and it spread while cooking - yielding a 1" thick cake with a good proportion of crumb toping. I put the toping on during backing as others suggested - result was great, although I'd like to cut down the butter somehow.

Many thanks! I made this for DH's birthday as he is a huge fan of cinnamon coffee cake. This is so moist and tasty and light. We had company and everyone loved it, son & wife broke diet, brother & fiancee raved, DH said it is definitely the best coffee cake he's ever had, outshines Starbucks even. I want to memorize it and pass it on to all my friends! Out of state of course, can't be giving it away to the locals :-)

Like other reviewers said, the butter thoroughly  melted through and I ended up with an extremely rich butter cake. I'll try it again later with the suggestion of adding the topping in the last 10 minutes.

let cake cool!  I made this last night and ate it while it was still a bit warm... it was nothing special. I had it again tonight though, and it taste so different. just like an authentic coffee cake... and i was thinking of leaving it on the common kitchen table at work... ha.  adjustments: 8 inch springform for 25 minutes. add crumbs (1.5 times) for another 15 minutes.

Great recipe, especially for the novice!  Easy to customize.  I am not crazy about cinnamon, so I used maple syrup for the streusel topping.  Also, natural Hawaiian sugar also worked great.

this was the first coffee cake recipe i came across that didn't require sour cream, which i didn't have. i baked this in a 9" springform, i don't think it would have covered a 9x13. i added a few tablespoons more milk and a tablespoon of oil, the batter was too dry without it. i spread half the batter, then half the streussel (doubled the recipe but kept the butter the same) and then topped with the rest of the batter. i added the last half of the topping during the last 15 minutes of baking. baked for 40 minutes total. came out lovely, moist and delicious.

We tried to double the recipe and it did not go over well. I guess that is our own fault. It might be very good if made normally

This is the first time I've ever made a coffee cake, and I thought it was great! I did follow the modicfications on the topping though, 1/2 cup flr, 1/2 white suger, and 1/2 brown sugar, kept butter and cinnamon the same.

This cake was delicious! I made only a couple of minor changes. I substituted Smart Balance for the butter, and doubled the recipe. I read what some of the others folks said about the topping sinking into the cake, so I added about 3/4 cup of uncooked oats into the topping mixture. This kept the topping on top and also gave the crumbs a great texture. Thank you for a wonderful coffee cake recipe!

Awesome cake!!! This cake is soooo moist and delicious. The only changes I made was to use while whole wheat flour in the cake and streusel topping, rice milk to make it non dairy, healthy tub margarine instead of butter. I also doubled the cake part of the recipe as someone suggested and it rose beautfully. It was delicous and everyone loved it! YUM YUM YUM!!!!

This was fantastically fluffy and delicious!  While it may have a touch too much vanilla, but the overall flavor is fantastic.  The only problem is that I could eat and eat it for forever!

This was delicious and great because I had all of the ingredients on hand. The only complaint is that it is very one dimensional in terms of being all about the butter. Delicious, but once it cools down it is a little hard and crumbly because of this.

This was a delicious recipe and it was easy to make. I think I was hoping for something a little better, though. I made it in mini bunt pans, but they didn't turn out cute like I hoped :c Oh, I'm fifteen, so you know that this really is an easy recipe.

Very yummy and easy! I use an 8x8 pan, as I like the cake to be thicker. Although then I find that I need to use less butter for the topping (otherwise I end up with pools of butter...which isn't all bad).

I've tried many coffee cakes. Most are good. This was FANTASTIC! We actually had it as a dessert, topped with a scoop of ice cream and raspberries/blackberries. When the ice cream soaked into the cake, the texture and taste was amazing. I'll make this again and again.

Like another reviewer said, "Way to buttery!".  I made exactly like the directions called for, except I increased the topping as per other reviews.  I've been baking for a long time and I know when it's me and when it's the recipe, this time, it's the recipe.

This was amazing coffee cake and would be even more amazing if you double the strousel.  I would suggest putting half on during the last 10 minutes of baking and the rest right out of the oven.  I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious, with a wonderful texture!  It was an awful lot of work, though, cutting in butter so much (why twice? why does a cake batter need cut-in butter? cakes don't need to be flaky).  And next time, I'd make a bit more of the topping and put some in the middle of the cake, too.

I'm wasn't sure about the consistency of the batter before putting it in the oven.  When I made this it was like a ball of dough.  I'm wondering if it should have it been like that or much more liquidy..?

It's a pretty good cake, except that it's not as tall as I would like it. So a smaller pan would be in order. I did like others and doubled the struesel topping, which was just enough for our taste. I don't know if I will make it again, though. There are so many other recipes out there. Not bad, though.

very good recipe.  I added sour cream instead of the milk, and pecans to the Streusel. I am a beginner cook and this was nice and easy.  Thank You. By the way, I have 2 more in the oven as we speak

My whole family loved this cake I made at my son's request for his birthday.  I had many over so had to double it.  Turned out perfect. They liked it was lighter and not as dense as a regular coffee cake but still very moist, rich and sweet.

Per other's reviews: Put half of the streusel in the middle and half on the top. There doesn't seem to be enough batter for a 9x13 pan, use 9x9. 1/2 c flour, 1/2 c white sugar, and 1/2 c brown sugar.  Add streusel when completely done or almost done and cover with foil to moisten streusel.

Very good recipe!  Took the advice of others, but used about 3/4 brown sugar to 1/4 white sugar for the streusel.  Also threw in about 1/3 cup old fashioned oats to the streusel mix.  Made 1.5X streusel and put a layer in the middle.  Also folded in some dried cranberries just before baking in a 8X8 dish.  Baked for about 40 minutes.  Came out thick, moist and not too dense....  Cake is not overpoweringly sweet and streusel has a nice little crunch!

This turned out really good but I was surprised that it did not call for brown sugar in the steusel... Next time I think I would make it with part brown and part white. I also added some chopped walnuts to the streusel for added crunch and I would highly recommend doing that to others unless you have a nut allergy.  Also, I did not have any eggs on hand so I substituted them with applesauce... The cake still came out moist and delicious. I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

OMG this was so good. my first time making coffee cake. because of people's complaints of it being too thin I baked mine in a 10in spring form cake pan instead and it was a good thickness (Might try 9 or even 8 in next time for thicker) and even though mine was smaller I still made the topping double because that's the best part! haha Also I used half brown sugar and half white like others suggested. Everyone who tried it raved and my father who usually doesn't like sweets had seconds! Can't wait to try this again soon.

WOW! This is coffee cake heaven, made with readily available ingredients. I used 1/3 c. brown sugar and 1/3 c. white sugar in the topping. I had a much easier time the 2nd time I made this by just mixing it all together in my stand mixer- just cream butter, sugar & egg as usual. I was also able to make the topping much more uniform by mixing it in the food processor. I didn't have sinking when I mixed it like that, though I did when I tried to cut the butter into it by hand. This is just too darn good!

Found this to be a little dry but still very tasty. Will try and add some homemade apple sauce to the mix next time to give a little more moisture and flavor!

My husband loved this! He said it was the best he'd ever tasted. I took the advice from other users and used 1/3 brown sugar and 1/3 regular sugar for the topping. I also waited until the last ten minutes of baking to add the topping.

Made this early this morning to take to my sister's house for the traditional new year's dinner. I followed the receipe for ingredients & the mixing instructions with the only exception being I used 1/4 c flour, 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar for the streusal (left the butter & cinnamon the same).  Baked in a 9X9 pan @ 350 for about 30 minutes....just perfect.  Next time though, I will put a layer of streusel between layers of the cake mix to get that extra goodness in the cake.  The streusel did "crunch" up on top when cooled, but was very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first coffee cake, and it's really delicious... the streusel is the best part! I actually made this coffee cake in a Bundt cake pan instead by converting the baking time from the "Blueberry-Coffee-Cake-I" recipe also found on All Recipes - and also added a few frozen blueberries into the batter mix and baked for 55 minutes. Once baked, I flipped it upside down to a plate, and dusted it with confectioner's sugar. It's a perfect light dessert or snack! The possible additions to this are endless I think... and don't believe it could be ruined easily. I will definitely be making this again! This was a great recipe to use my new Bundt cake pan for the first time, which was a gift for Christmas.

Amazingly delicious!  I made this coffee cake as a light dessert to go with my Christmas dinner and the whole family loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly as its written.  I do recommend making the topping first and letting in sit in the fridge while you prepare the batter.  This allows the butter in the mixture for the topping to stay solid until you are ready to put in it the oven.  Also, you will want to use a smaller pan.  I used a glass Pyrex 8x10 inch pan.  I give this recipe 5 stars...

This was great!  I ended up changing it a bit, but the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was because I like my coffee cake thicker and it turned out pretty thin and I followed all the directions to a "t".  It may have been my changes.  I replaced the white sugar in the topping for 1/3 cup of Splenda brown sugar and added 2/3 cup chopped pecans.  I also replaced the white sugar in the batter with 3/4 cup Splenda.  I added about 3/4 cup of dried cranberries to the batter, too.  My hubby loved it and he didn't feel bad about eating such a treat on a Sunday!  Thank you for sharing. 2nd Review: This is still great, but I did make the struesel changes listed under DishDish's review and the topping came out wonderfully. Also, I switched out the cinnamon for pumpkin pie spice (which I also added to the dough). This is still soooo good!

Wonderful! Wonderful! I followed the recipe, only using a mix of vanilla/almond exctract, and adding a swirl of brown sugar/butter to the batter before topping and baking, and a little brown sugar to the topping. Also, I only had a loaf pan available, but it still took the same amount of time. It came out so PERFECT and tasted amazing! I made a drizzle of powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk, which just finished it off! Thank you for this recipe!!!

This is what I think of as an emergency cake, because it uses storecupboard ingredients. I used brown sugar in the crumb topping but kept the amounts as specified in the recipe. There was a lot of topping so another time I might layer some halfway though the cake. Far too good to keep just for cake emergencies. Thankyou Mary.

Really good! Put mine in a 9X9 for a thicker cake & cooked for 40 mins, added streusel topping and back in for another 15.  Turned out great, my 1 & 2 year olds ate as much as me!

I made this in a 9x9 pan because I like my coffee cake thicker.  I added the topping in the last 15 minutes or so and it was yummy!!  Add about 15 minutes for the smaller pan....  One last change...  a large splash of cinnamin in the cake batter (thanks to my son).

Very good! I baked it in a springboard pan and used half and half instead of milk, because I was all out. It was thin like a pancake, literally 2 inches thick. I accidentally put in 1/2 cup of butter in the cake, this might have made a difference in it not rising more. It was still a hit. Next time I will definitely double the cake batter. Thank you for posting.

Not like I need to give this recipe another rave review because it already has so many.  I really wanted to review this recipe because it's the best recipe I've made on this website.  I used a 9" spring loaded pan and used 1/2c white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar for the topping.  I also waited till the last 5 minutes to apply the topping.  It came out soooooooo good.  I also tried using whole wheat flour and it comes out just as good.  It's more filling and you wont eat as much.

This is a great recipe especially considering it uses half the butter that many recipes call for.  I made it w/ a few modifications.  I prefer to have a thicker piece of coffee cake so I made the batter recipe the same but added in 1 tsp cinnamon.  Then split batter in half and add in streusel in the middle.  Add rest of the mixture to the top.  I useded the previous reviewers suggestion for the streusel topping.  Use 1/2 cup (each) flour, sugar, and brown sugar.  Keep butter the same.  Also add in 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  I baked in an 8x8 pan for about 45 minutes.

Absolutely delicious! I took a recommendation of doing 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, cinnamon and butter for topping. I put the topping on after about 15 minutes into cooking and topping did not run into cake at all! I will absolutely make this again. Love that all of the ingredients are items that I always have on hand!

This was good. I think i made a mistake on the topping. I read that it baked into the cake...which mine did. But...I did 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. And same butter and cinnamon. Maybe i mixed the mixture too much...who knows. BUt will make again. Trying something different.

Really good and easy to make. I made them into muffins since I couldn't find a 9x13 pan, also I used about 1/8tsp of nutmeg and 3tbls of brown sugar instead of cinnamon. Delicious.

Yum!  This cake is wonderful . . . searched for a recipe without sour cream as I was out :( & found this one.  I used an 8x8 pan and added pecans & changed the sugar to brown instead of white in the struesel.  Was tender, not too sweet - definitely a keeper.

This cake was not what I was looking for.. The top melted into the cake even though I used half brown sugar...I did put a bit more milk then it called for due to the other reviews saying it being to dry.  It was very sweet a little to sweet..I will continue looking for another recipe.

I loved this cake and made it without the topping as I was looking for a simple white base for 'soak' type cake.  I ended up eating it on it's own as a plain coffee cake - it was that yummy :).  I had to make another one for my soak.  It's not too sweet, has a great texture.  Will definitely make again.

uh-MAZING! made it exactly as specified, except it looked like it needed more milk, so added more. the truth is, i ran out of milk right after i measured 1 cup, and improvised by adding some buttermilk since it needed more liquid. turned out great.

My daughter asked for coffee cake, so I made this for her for breakfast. When I asked her if she liked it she could nto talk because her mouth was full. She asked for seconds, which is the ultimate compliment as she is the pickiest eater I have ever met. Thanks!

After reading the reviews, I used 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1/4 cup butter for the streusel. Next time, I will reduce the flour in the streusel to 1/4 cup. Also, when preparing the batter, I used the usual method of creaming the butter and sugar, etc. I poured half the batter in a 9x9 inch pan, sprinkled half the streusel, poured the remaining batter, and baked the cake for about 35 minutes.  I sprinkled the remaining streusel in the last ten minutes of baking.  However, the sugar on top did not melt and crystallize, and instead, it remained too crumbly for my taste.  Next time, I'll sprinkle the streusel on earlier (perhaps in the last 15 minutes of baking). But the flavor of the cake was excellent.

This coffee cake was wonderful. I did make adjustments. The cumb topping I did 1/2c. sugar and 1/2c. flour. I also put it in an 11x7 pan. It came out perfect. The first time I made it I put it in an 8x8 pan and that made the cake just too tall and did not bake well.

All I can say is WOW. You must try this coffee cake. It is moist, fluffy, and so delicious. The recipe is wonderful as-is, no need to change anything. (I did use 1/2 whole wheat flour b/c I ran out of regular) I thought the amount of struesel was perfect.  Thank you, thank you so much for this recipe!!!!

Delicious coffee cake.  I also doubled the strussel topping.  I also used all white sugar and added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of molasses to give the sugar a little color and richer flavor.  Just delicious and very quick!!

it was okay, the only thing wrong was that the cake was a little bit dry, tough, and too heavy!!! It may be a high altitude thing that I didn't think about!!! I will definitely try it again, taking high altitude into account!!!

I was impressed! My fiance got 'burnt out' on coffee cake as a kid but when I made this he licked the plate. It LOOKS flat in a 9x13 at first, but it rises. If it doesn't rise, it's probably time to buy fresh baking powder.

This was great.  I made some alterations to the topping.  I took someone's advice and divided 1/4 cup of flour, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and 1/4 cup of sugar and mixed some in the batter and the rest on top.  I also baked it in a bunt cake pan for about 40 minutes (keep an eye on it while cooking).  It turned out very tasty.

This coffee cake was really good; it's quite similar to the cinnamon coffee cake they sell at Starbucks. I imagine if you added more topping and created a thin, goopy layer of cinnamon in the middle of the cake, you'd have the the same exact one!
It was really easy to make with lots of standard ingredients, thus convenient to make within in an hour to munch on at home or even to take to a friend's house.


* I heeded the advice of adding the topping about ten minutes before taking the cake out and it turned out fabulously.

Wonderful, moist, light coffee cake.  Perfect in the morning or in the evening !  Hubby couldn't stay away from it !!!  If you like a denser pound cake type of coffee cake this is not for you.

We loved it !!

This recipe was absolutely awesome! I used DISHDISH's recommendations for the topping, and additionally I chopped up some walnuts to sprinkle in with it. I also mixed a little powdered sugar and a splash of cream together to make a drizzle for the top of the cake. Delicious! Thanks for this winning recipe!

Easy to make and tasted almost the same as my high school alumni used to make it. However, the butter really should be left a room temperature before baking or mixing. I figured that out when I started cutting the butter into the batter and it wasn't evenly broken up or spread. Other then that, it was pretty great!..Just remember to add half the strusel in the beginning and in the end of bake time.

The cook time for me was WAY longer than suggested, it took over an hour to bake in my oven. I definitely like the additional streusel that other users suggested.

well I made this recipe and it turned out GREAT....I was pleasantly surprised. I did add some chopped pecans to the brown sugar topping.although the batter was kind of thick and the cake was thinner than I thought it would be.IT WAS STILL FANTASTIC . I recommend trying this recipe.

I made this for a potluck and it was really nice. Just the right amount of sweet. I'll make it again.

Tasted wonderful.  
I felt the instructions could be clearer... the butter should be room temperature (softened using microwave at 30% power works well) for both strusel and creaming.
Baking time was ALOT longer than listed, but that may be my own oven.
If you have a sweet tooth, you will want more strusel (double recipe will do fine), if you don't then the recipe listed works great.  
When I made this, the topping did not sink in as other reviews have noted.

This recipe was just great! Moist, crunchy and delicious. The only thing I changed was 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of plain white sugar in the topping. I also baked it in a loaf pan and put some topping in the middle of the cake. It bakes a little bit longer, but is the best coffee cake I have ever had!

A very tasty recipe. Like another reviewer suggested, I used brown sugar instead of white for the topping.  It was gobbled up in no time!  I have no desire to look for a different crumb cake recipe.  This one is wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

The description says it all, it didn't last long enough for me to grab a slice of coffee cake for myself. I made this wonderful coffee cake for my friends' BBQ paired with a blueberry pie. It was a HUGE hit. great recipe :)

This coffee cake turned out pretty good.  I used half brown sugar and half regular sugar for the streusel topping.  I didn't have any trouble with it melting down through the cake.

I changed a couple things and this recipe came out awesome. I used 1/3 c white sugar and 1/3 dark brown sugar for the streusel, and I added a couple dashes of cinnamon to the batter. I brought it to work the teachers loved it and my students loved it too!

There was no way this was going to cover my 9 x 13" pan and the baking time was off (needed almost 45 minutes).  However, the taste was good and it was relatively easy to make.  Not sure I'll make it again though. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow! This was scrumptious! My 5 yr old daughter she wants me to make this every day :-) I used other reviewers' suggestions, such as adding 1 tsp cinnamon and a few Tbsp apple juice to the batter, preserving half the streusel topping for the middle and the other half for the top of the cake,and lowering the cooking temp to 325 for 40 minutes. I sifted the flour mixture 3 times for fluffiness, and it turned out PERFECTLY. I will never use another coffee cake recipe. Thanks!

Not a bad recipe. I always add a little cinnamon/nutmeg to the batter to give it a little spice. I've prepared it several times, whenever I'm in the mood for an easy coffee cake. Thank you!

Very easy to make. The topping is especially easy if you use a food processor! It turns out delicious and is gone quite quickly. So far I've made it twice, and it's been gone within the day both times! I find it is best to take the butter out only when you need it and to slice it a little, but quickly so as not to melt it. It makes for a much better crumble!

This is simply the easiest and best coffee cake I have made.  I too, split the sugar using both brown and white.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and have only had great success.

This is a great coffee cake recipe! I wanted something sweet and I did not have a ton of ingredients in the house so I tried this one and wow! I am a serious coffee cake snob and this was spectacular! I made a ton of streusel and finished it off with a powdered sugar glaze and it was to die for! But a word of warning it tastes better the next day than the first!

I used the split sugar/brown sugar mix to make up the 2/3 cup sugar called for in the topping...it really sunk into the cake while baking.  Its appearance and texture is bad but suprisingly the the cake has a good taste.  I just have to have the family close their eyes before taking a bite.  I'd suggest not adding the topping until 2-3 minutes before the cake is finished baking.  That way you wont have a cake filled with craters and valleys (mine looks like the Grand Canyon).  With some work, this cake could be a 5 star recipe.

My husband and I like anything made from scratch so it's hard not to rate this recipe high! I had a friend coming for breakfast and needed something convenient and quick and this was wonderful.  I used brown sugar for the topping and it turned out sort of marblized (partly because I read the instructions wrong and used too much butter!).  It tasted great, still! Thanks!

Mmmmm...C'est trés trés bon!  I made this for a family in France and they loved it.  Just one word of caution: NEVER make this with a vegetable oil spread.  The French family for which I was making this gave me this stuff called Omega 3, which I've been using the entire time for everything else I've baked, and the results were horrendous.  I ended up with this weird custardy layer at the bottom and all my crumb topping  sank to the bottom.  Fortunately they'd never had it before, so they didn't know! ;)  It was totally my fault for doing that, and it may be the reason that other people's have turned out weird too.  Still, I'm giving it five stqrs because the flavor's so good.  I'll definitely try this again and with ingredients that will make it turn out correctly.

This recipe was awesome!  I also made the toping 1/3 C white and 1/3 C brown sugar.  When I made the batter/dough it seemed a little thick so I added maybe 1/4-1/3 cup of milk, and WOW!  Moist, flavorfull, and delicious.  I will definetly be making this one again.

This recipe is wonderful and so easy to make! I took everyone's advice and did 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 brown sugar for the topping. I made it tonight so we could have it for breakfast tomorrow, but after having a small taste, my husband and I were too tempted...it's already half gone! Great recipe!

Sooo easy & sooo delicious.  I had all the ingredients without a shopping list.  Highly recommended.  Give it a try.  The sweetness content was perfect aswell.

The cake was moist and flavorful, but the topping could use some work.  I would change the streusel topping to 1/3 white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar and add a couple more tablespoons of butter.  Overall, good recipe.

A great classic coffee cake recipe...my mom used to make this when I was a kid.  She tops it with canned peaches or pineapple.  Make sure you use fresh baking powder so it rises well.

mmmmmm i loved this recipe! my friend and i made it one night. We were bored and didnt have choc. chips or anything special like that. We looked on here and say all of the positive ratings. This cake was good, but we added a few sliced marshmallows when it was cooling. It added a little bit of sweet and a different texture. Next time i hope to use more sugar, possible powdered!

This coffee cake is awesome! I always add a cup of fresh blueberries, or sliced apples.  People in my family fight for the cake and the whole thing is polished off in one morning! This is a winner in my cookbook =).

This was very easy to make.  I was skeptical about it when I poured it into the pan.  Didn't look like enough batter but it was perfect!  Made the house smell wonderful on a Sunday morning.  My husband loved it!  I will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was fairly quick to fix and tasty.  Husband wasn't real impressed with it though.  If I make again, I'll add pecan bits to the topping.

I really liked this coffee cake. It was quick and easy to make with simple ingredients. I accidentally made a double batch of the topping and I was glad I did. It covered the cake nicely. I also substituted buttermilk for the regular milk because I like the taste better. Delicious!

I made the following changes. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar for the streusel. I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter. I then added 2 tsp. white sugar and 1 tsp. cinnamon to the flour used in preparing my bundt cake pan. I put 1/2 the batter in the pan then put the streusel on followed by the remaining cake batter. I baked it 10 min. longer than instructed. Allowed it to cool 15 min. in the pan before turning it onto my cake plate. I thought about a powdered sugar glaze but decided it might be over kill on the sweetness. My son and I thought it turned out great but my husband wasn't overly impressed. He thought it tasted like it had apples in it...Hmmmmm...maybe next time it will also maybe some crushed pecans in the streusel... Thanks for the recipe Mary!

Pretty good basic recipe, though it's nothing fancy (which is good for small kids!).  I'd like a more complex flavor, but this is a great Sunday morning cake for my boys.

This recipe is very good, just the right amount of sweetness.  A family hit, even my spinger spanial liked it.  Get for Sunday Brunch. Will make it again and again.  I also placed the topping on at the last 10mins of baking, and I used 1/3c. brown sugar and 1/3c. of white sugar for the topping.

This is delicious coffee cake!  The streusel topping is what makes it.  It was so quick & easy to make.  I baked it in a 12x12 pan, and had to bake 10 min longer.  Pefect touch for a brunch!  I'd highly recommend this.  Thank you Mary for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Very delicious coffee cake.  I like that it bakes in a short amount of time compared to some coffee cakes. Also, no special ingredients are needed.  My entire family loved this breakfast treat.  The recipe was so easy I'll let my daughter make it next time.  The cake comes out with the texture of a traditional muffin, which is wonderful.  Just make sure to only stir batter until flour is moistened... do not overstir, just as if you're making muffins.

This is the best coffee cake ever.  My family could not get enough and my children woke up the next morning asking for more.  I am not a good baker but this one changed the minds of all my family including my husband. Now he's asking me to look up more recipes and go for it.  Thanks

This was so tasty, I had to put it out of sight, so that I would'nt end up eating the whole thing myself.

This was a simple recipe that turned out very nicely. This also stayed moist for a long time. I added sauced blackberries and it was a big hit.

Mmmm, yummy!  The description is right....you can't eat just one.  I made mine with Mexican vanilla, and the aroma while baking just about drove me loco.
