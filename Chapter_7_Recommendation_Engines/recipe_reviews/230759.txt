My 10 year old grandson asked me to make him some chocolate covered bacon. I have heard of it, but have never tried it. Who knows where my grandson heard of it? I'm making it this week, so we'll give you our updated stars by the end of the week. Almost anything covered in chocolate is good, ha ha. Thanks for posting Denise! *** Back again, several months later. Just wanted everyone to know how much my grandson loved his chocolate covered bacon. I've made it a couple more times, and everyone loves it.

---Mom: whatcha making?
--- Me: chocolate covered bacon
--- Mom: you should be arrested---

I made my bacon in the oven. Took closer to 40 minutes to get crispy for some reason... Then dipped some in milk chocolate and sprinkles; some in white chocolate and drizzled with milk chocolate; some in melted peanut butter chips sprinkled with sugar. 

---I should be sainted---

I think I'd love this. Haven't tried it yet but I'd cook the bacon in the microwave, like I always do, until it's crispy, then brush each piece with two coats of the chocolate and sprinkle with cayenne pepper.

Excellent!  My only advice is to open all the windows because bacon smokes in the over.  But it was sooooo good.  My hubby would like it a little bit sweeter, so next time I'm going to try half milk chocolate.

I make this a few times a year. I don't skewer them, though this was the first time I brushed instead of dipping; so much easier! Topped with food colored sea salt

I just made this for a party we were attending. I tried them myself first and thought 'yeah they're okay' but it was such a hit at the party, people just loved them. I used semi sweet chiplits this time but next time I might experiment with chili flavoured dark chocolate.

Chocolate covered bacon, weird as it may sound, is really good.  If you haven't tried it yet, you have nothing to lose.  Give it a shot and see what you think.  In the least, you can say you tried it! :)

Great recipe!! I made this for my dad because it’s literally perfect for him (some baseball loving, chocolate loving, bacon loving person out there will understand) I haven’t given it to him yet, will update when it do. 
Great recipe overall, but when we baked the bacon for 23 mins, it burnt quite a bit. I would recommend doing 20 mins, instead of 25, definitely!

I've have never made this before until last week. I've heard of it occasionally...after all said and done. It was okay. It's much better when served cold out of the refrigerator.

I didn't have skewers or shortening. I cut the bacon in half and cooked it on the stove and substituted a couple tablespoons of butter and a splash of canola oil.

I have been wanting to try this for a long time. I had a few strips of leftover bacon, so I didn't try making the bacon in the oven or putting them on skewers. I used milk chocolate. I brushed chocolate on both sides of each piece, and I wished I had done a second coating of chocolate. I liked it, but I didn't just love it. I don't know that I'll make it again, but I'd certainly eat it if someone offered it to me.
