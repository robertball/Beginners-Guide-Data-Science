Made this for the guys down at the firehouse and they all loved it.  Made a few alterations though.  Used 6 eggs instead of 4.  When I was browning the sausage I added some fresh mushrooms and half of a yellow onion to the mix and sauteed them.  Also I added half a pound of thick bacon.  We love meaty breakfast.  I also added a little extra of each type of cheese.  Next time I make this I will add sliced jalepenos to spice it up a bit.  Definitely recommend giving this a try.

This is a really great recipe.  It is versatile by allowing the cook to add whatever ingredients (meat, veggies) that is desired.  That aside, it does have a tendency to come out a bit more running than most breakfast casseroles.  To alleviate this problem, I use a 16oz bag of herb seasoned croutons. I also like my casseroles a bit more meaty and cheesy.  Therefore, I use 1 pound of turkey sausage and 1 pound of bacon along with 16oz of shredded cheese. I also add a bit of paprika to the mix.  The eggs and milk provide ample moisture for the crouton mixture to bake up moist but not soggy. As for execution, I mix everything except the croutons together and then mix in the croutons so that the add-ins are distributed throughout the casserole.  Then I pour everything into a 9x13 baking dish.  I take this casserole to MOPS (Mothers of Preschoolers) everytime it is my turn to cook and I never come home with any left overs.

When preparing this dish I sauteed fresh mushrooms with onions and garlic instead of using the canned mushrooms.  This dish is a big hit with my family.

My new favorite breakfast casserole. It has such a great flavor. I replaced all the ingredients (eggbeaters, LF milk, LF soup, LF cheese, turkey sausage) with their lowfat, healthier counterparts and it was delicious and actually pretty healthy when you change out those ingredints. I've already made it twice in 2 weeks. I can't wait to share it with others.

Kudos! I got rave reviews when I made this for a broker open house. Only change was I used fresh sliced mushrooms. I did an extra 2 eggs because mine were small and the pan was a tad larger than called for. Smelled wonderful cooking. Agents said that it had a great flavor and one who used to run a B&B said it was better than hers and not as heavy tasting. Great as a leftover,  too. Make this and you will not be sorry!!

This dish was awesome, or in other words DA BOMB!  I recommend using Pepperidge Farm dry stuffing mix (cubes) and adding some crumbled bacon along with the sausage.  Of course also, I recommend Jimmy Dean Hot sausage or Tennesse pride spicy sausage. Also, you can add whatever else you like to make it an even bigger success.  I plan on added onions the next time and may make a small one for myself and a large one for my family to enjoy!

thanks for the FANTASTIC recipe!  i served it at my baby's church dedication lunch and got rave reviews.  the only changes i made were very minor and i 99.99% stuck to the written recipe.  i did use another reviewers tip by adding more seasonded croutons.  i think i maybe added 4 cups.  i threw in some bacon and used sharp white cheddar and some swiss.  i also used fresh mushrooms.  it sounds like i made alot of changes, but not really.
the seasoned croutons, spinach, and mushrooms were AWESOME!  this is definately THE best breakfast casserole and so handy because you assemble it the night before.

I thought this was good for a breakfast casserole. A tip for those who thought the bottom layer of mush was unappetizing: Put the bread crumbs or croutons on top, then bake. Same ingredients & amounts, just put cubes on top. This will allow them to get browned and make a slightly crispier texture, than on the bottom. Just save a sprinkle of cheese to put on top of cubes, and you can broil for a minute or so after baking for a nicer crunch/texture. One more hint: Use a pre-made pie shell. Load the ingredients, minus the croutons, and simply bake. This will solve the problem of mushy croutons all together. :)

So many breakfast casseroles call for cream or half-and-half, which I never have on hand.  But I ALWAYS have a can of cream of mushroom soup in the cupboard.  For that reason, this recipe works really well for my family.

I tend to use stuffing mix instead of croutons.  Tastes great!

I took this to a church brunch & the flavor was great but it was kind of soggy. I'm afraid it needed more time to cook. I will be making it again Christmas morning & will see how it is w/ additional cooking time.



I did make this again, adding an additional 15 minutes & it was much better!

I made this for my office Christmas brunch and it was the favorite for everyone . . . and the most talked about.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  After reading all of the reviews, I did tweak the recipe as follows: used 3 cups of seasoned stuffing mix for the croutons, used 2 lbs of sausage (1 spicy and 1 maple), only used 2 cups milk, used fresh spinach (sauteed), used fresh mushrooms that I sauteed with a white onion in butter, used Swiss cheese instead of Monterey Jack, omitted dry mustard and parsley.  I will definitely be making this again . . . and likely cutting it up into pieces and freezing it for quick breakfast (or dinner).  YUM!!!

This was the rave of our Christmas morning -- my entire family devoured it, and kept eating the leftovers throughout the day.  Based on other reviews, we used fresh mushrooms with which I sauteed some sweet onion.  I also used swiss and white cheddar for the cheeses, because we prefer swiss with mushroom and spinach flavors over the Monterey Jack as the recipe was published.  I upped it to 6 eggs, then it looked like it was going to be too much for my pan, so I added another can of mushroom soup, another cup of cheese, and split it into two pans -- one with sausage, one with bacon.  I upped the temp to 350 and baked about an extra 15 minutes.  They both turned out beautifully!  Next time I'll look for a sausage spicier than the "country sausage" I used, otherwise will make just as I did this first time.

Big hit at our house. I omitted the small can of mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them. He knew the recipe called for mushroom soup but agreed to try it anyway. He had seconds today and I'm sure he'll have leftovers tomorrow. The seasoned croutons made a delicious crust and the presentation was attractive.

Made this for a sunday brunch. Used some of the suggestions from others but tweeked it a bit too. Used 8 eggs not 4- used 2 - 5.5 oz bags of croutons. Added 1/2  lb of bacon and sauteed onions which I cooked with fresh mushrooms. Baked it for a little over an hour and it set up and held its shape well. I think the original recipe would be a bit runny without adding additional eggs and increasing the croutons. I would  make it  again in a minute....there was none left and received many compliments on the dish.

This recipe was amazing!! I was a hit for my sunday football brunch! I tweaked it a little by using stuffing bread cubes instead of croutons. I also used fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach. I added about a half of back of bacon which I cooked, then crumbled and sprinkled over the top of the sausage as I was layering. I added about twice the amount of cheese because my family loves it and eliminated the dry mustard because I didnt have it around. I also used 6 eggs instead of 4 because I was using smaller eggs. The fresh spinach and mushrooms gave it a fresh taste and the bacon added a great savory kick! I made this the night before and popped it in the oven about an hour before the game. By half time it had cooled and everyone was eating. There was not a crumb left!! I will definately be making this for thanksgiving breakfast, its so convenient because you can put it together the night before I think next time I may chop up some fresh basil and shallots and add that into the mix as well. If you like a hearty savory casserole this one is a winner!

Made this according to directions and was very disappointed.  Far too much liquid and croutons turned to mushy globs. Won't be making this again

This is a great recipe. I really didn't make a lot of changes, but I did end up using both fresh spinach and mushrooms, which I think added some great flavor. It was still pretty watery after 55 minutes, I could probably leave this in more like an hour and a half.

Delicious.  I agree with other reviews that even after letting it "warm up" on the counter before baking for 30 minutes, it still needs 10-15 minutes more cook time.  But it's awesome and a more "refined" breakfast casserole.  YUM.

I make this everytime my coworker and I are to bring in breakfast for the office.  It disappears SO fast.  The only changes I really make are less milk (I use only 2 cups) and I substitute 1 can green chiles (drained) for the mushrooms (I just don't like them).  GREAT and easy recipe.

I love this recipe. I have made it several times....most times for meat eaters. On Sunday I decided to make it Vegan style, I just substituted the meat with Vegan meat crumbles, used "fake" egg whites (used 8 instead). I used the new shredded Vegan cheeses they now make. I also used fresh spinach & fresh mushrooms & sauteed them. I used extra croutons (about 3 cups) so it wasnt so runny. It came out wonderful! Even the meat eaters in the group loved it!!

It was delicious but my cardiologist (a fellow cook) took one look at the ingredients and turned a pale greenish hue and seemed to have lost his once lively talent for discourse on matters cuisine.

Perfect recipe! I did use one reviewers suggestion and added bacon. SO GOOD!  I also would cut back on the spinach next time. I'm not sure if I didn't mix it enough, but there were some areas of the casserole that were a little too spinached out. :)  I also brown the sausage with onion and used fresh mushrooms as well.  It's easy to make-ahead for a no-fuss breakfast for guests...I just pop it in the oven and wait for the rave reviews to roll in. :)

AWE-SOME!  I took this to a church breakfast this morning and it was gone in a flash.  I had multiple people come up to me and ask for the recipe. The spicy pork sausage and addition of mushroom soup are what I really think put it over the top. The slight changes I made are as follows:  * Added an extra egg. * Omitted the mustard (hate the stuff) and subbed in some onion powder, white pepper and crushed black pepper. * Skipped on the canned mushrooms and instead used some thawed chopped broc.   * Used low fat mozzarella in place of the monterey because the grocer was all out (go figure). THANK YOU FOR SHARING!  :)

I used various vegetables instead of sausage (zucchini, peppers etc). This was so convenient and delicious!

I liked this recipe, I used fresh mushrooms, pre-cooked turkey sausage crumbles (great time saver), and added onion which I did not pre-cook.  I am glad I did not pre-cook them because it gave the dish some texture.  While the flavor was GREAT I can't say I was into the soggy croutons.  I will make this again but will put more thought in the texture.

  I love texture if you could not tell :)

The only reason I didn't give this a 5, is because it has just a bit too much spinach.  I will make this recipe again but cut down the spinach to maybe half of the recommended amount.

Prepared exactly as directed with egg whites and skim milk.  I was worried it would look icky without egg yolks - no problem!  Mine took closer to and hour and a half to set in the middle. Delish! Everyone loves and was happy it was a healthy breakfast unlike many casseroles. THanks

I did what Blondie410 did but used fat free milk.  I used cubed stuffing instead of croutons and doubled the spinach.  I used Campbell's 98 per cent fat free cream of mushroom soup.

Excellent dish, we make this one each year for Christmas morning.  Love having a "gourmet" like breakfast and not missing any of the Christmas fun making it.  We follow the recipe and have rave reviews each year.

I made this last night for a church breakfast today. I used Pepridge Farm Seasoned crotons (stuffing, one of the recomendations mentioned this) and 2% milk and 2% Cheese (Sargentos Chedder and Jack). I also used Campbell's Low Fat mushroom soup and 16 ounces of cooked portobello mushrooms. It was excellent. Everyone mentioned how good it was. There was about 20 people. I made two 9x13 pans. Cooked for one hour. GREAT!! Thank you Shannot Marie!!!

My family loved this.  I used regular Jimmy Dean sausage that I had on hand instead of spicy sausaage and then sprinkled a little red pepper flakes over the meat layer.  It was perfect and I had more control of how spicey it was.  It was a big hit.

This is SUCH a good casserole!!  It has all the great breakfast ingredients thrown into one casserole.  I've made this many times!  It's great for when my husband has a breakfast at work and needs something other than muffins, fruit, etc.  This is great served with coffee cake and coffee - YUM!!!

I made this for New Years Day brunch at a ski house and it was a big hit!  I took suggestions of others and sauteed fresh creminis, instead of using canned mushrooms, half and onion, and 3 cloves of garlic in some olive oil.  I also used 2 cups of milk and 7 eggs, since I had more people to feed.  Everyone loved it!

It turned out PERFECT!  This is the first breakfast casserole that is even worth considering making twice.  I've made so many that were blah, but this was DELICIOUS!  Thank you for posting.    I used 8 eggs, 2 cups of skim milk, sausage and bacon and large generic garlic cheese croutons.  I mixed it all together in bowl before putting in dish.  I increased temp to 350 for 60 minutes.

Made this for breakfast, prepared it the night before and baked it in the morning. I didn't use croutons or cream of mushroom soup. I also used ham instead as I had a lot leftover from a ham dinner. My family loved it!! My husband says we should make it when we have family stay over or Christmas morning. Easy way to slip veggies into food, I used fresh spinach and green peppers. Baked up perfect for me, not dry at all. This is a great recipe! Served with some biscuits, delicious!! Thanks Shannon!

I've been making this for years.  The first time, I made it for our office & used spicy pork sausage...it was a hit so I've used it every since.  I have also made it with chopped canadian bacon and chopped, fully cooked link sausages such as smoked sausage or polish kelbasa.  I have also added chopped onions &/or bell pepper to the pork sausage while browning too.  I have never used ground beef but I think it would be good if you seasoned it very well.  I have always said I am going to make it with several meats together, but just haven't done it yet.  Hint, always use large size croutons (texas style) & the bottom will be more crusty and makes it easier to serve.  

It has since become my favorite to make for families when there is a death in the family.  Everyone always takes food, drinks, desert but breakfast is often forgotten.  Put it in a tin, cover with foil, and write the hitting directions on it and deliver.  I also not on the foil that it reheats very well after cooking.  For large families, I will usually make two and just do a different meat in each one in order to change it up. You don't have to pick up your dish later, and they can throw the tin away after consuming. 

Great recipe that you can easily alter to meet different needs & taste!  Try it!

Great, easy recipe. Made it Christmas Eve for Christmas brunch. Like others, tweaked it a little...used 5 jumbo eggs, 2 c. milk, no mushrooms (sister doesn't like mushrooms), seasoned croutons. Had a list of ingredients, but couldn't find the recipe, so I layered the croutons on bottom, layered cooked sausage & chopped onions on top (used 1.5 lbs spicy & .5 lb regular), layered spinach, poured egg mixture on that and they layered the monterrey jack and cheddar on top... baked 325 for 1.5 hrs...had a layer of alum.foil on most of the time..took off toward the end... turned off oven and let it sit in there for about 20 min. 'til I served it... it was WONDERFUL!!! served with fruit and warmed flour tortillas....

Superb and super healthy casserole. I used fresh spinach and added garlic salt and black pepper to taste. I used turkey sausage and whole wheat bread instead of croutons. It was delicious.

Easy to make for a potluck at work.   Texture of it made me rate it lower.  Tasted good though.  I followed the recipe with the exception of sauting fresh mushrooms instead of using canned.

I made this recipe exactly as stated, but when I realized my mother did not have croutons in her kitchen and I was not about to run to Safeway on Christmas Eve at 5pm, I decided to substitute with stuffing mix. It was all I had. Unfortunately that substitution caused the entire dish to taste verrrry stuffing-y and anyone who dished out a piece of casserole had to leave about half the crust behind to be able to taste the cheese and meat etc! But that was my fault, I would love to try this recipe again with croutons or my own homemade croutons. Aside from this minor issue the casserole was delicious. I cooked and drained the sausage then sauteed sliced mini portobello and button mushrooms with a very small onion... YUMMM. This is a keeper and I cant wait for the next time I make this!

I followed the other revisions such as fresh mushrooms, 6 eggs, 2 cups milk, added some chopped green bell pepper and onion to the sausage (I used regular Jimmy Dean).... used 2 - 6 oz bags of garlic cheese croutons on the bottom, and added a splash of worcestershire to the egg/spinach/cheese mixture in my mixer.  I baked it for about 70 minutes to make sure it was firm in the middle.  Absolutely the BEST breakfast casserole I have ever eaten.  I renamed it Christmas Morning Souffle and shared the recipe with my friends and family! (I did tell them I found the recipe here).

This is a great recipe very filling. I made a few changes: I used Jimmy Dean Hot breakfast sausage which gave I think gave it a good taste. I used fresh instead of can mushrooms like someone else suggested. Next time I make it I will fresh instead of frozen spinach. I left out the croutons because I'm trying to eat low carb. I used 5 whole eggs and one egg yolk because the four egg and milk mixture just seemed too milky. All in all it turned out get. I think the cream of mushroom soup gives it really good flavor. I will definitely make this again.

It's yummy. I follow another reviewers suggestion about mixing all ingredients together. Thank you, that worked out perfectly. Added more breakfast sausage and less cheese. I like that it wasn't over-the-top with a ton of eggs. Great for a lighter dinner. Cut up in squares and it's breakfast on-the-go. Lots of variation with a little creativity. -thatgirl

I have been making a version of this for over 20 years.  The difference is: no spinach or mushroom;  the mushroom soup is added on the top of the casserole just before putting it in the oven in the morning; cheddar cheese in place of Monterey Jack; and diced jalepeno peppers over the sausage. I cook a full hour and let set at least 10 minutes before serving.   Leftovers can be frozen for later.   This version is just as good, just a bit different.

My family loves this casserole. It's so easy to put together. I used a whole 6oz bag of seasoned croutons. Changed the sausage to 1lb of bacon and omitted the mushrooms (my daughter is allergic to them). I changed the sausage to bacon because I also make sausage gravy and biscuits to go with the casserole. I now make this casserole every Christmas breakfast. Thanks for such a great recipe.

This is the best breakfast casserole!  I love that it is made the night before.  The only changes I make are adding additional eggs (2 or 3 more) and changing up the meat portion based on what I have on hand; it's great with sausage, bacon or ham.  I made it for our turn for coffee hour at church and almost everyone asked for the recipe - rave reviews by all!

Pretty Good. I used pepperidge farm stuffing mix as the base and it turned out too "gooey" on the bottom. Will use croutons next time. I had a lot left over and it was even better on the second day.

Worked out really well..

I used fresh mushrooms, and also added broccoli.  Seemed you could add most anything.

A great, easy recipe!

VERY good. DEFINITELY use fresh mushrooms (I crumbled the mushroom slices with my hands to "chop" them). I also used six eggs, and Swiss for the jack cheese. Leftovers were delicious, and I melted additional Swiss on the top. I loved the Swiss so well, next time I will sprinkle more on top before baking.

I loved this... my only complaint would be that the croutons did make it soggy. I wish I knew a way to avoid this.

However, it is still an excellent meal and my brother and husband both ate several helpings.

Awesome..I sauted my spinach first w/garlic and mushrooms, let it cool then added to egg mixture.  I also added 1 can cream/mushroom soup and 1 can cream of potato. (i made for 20 servings) Next
time I will use only cream of potato. And use turkey bacon instead of pork sausage.

This was not very good - I expected it to be much better than it was, with all the 5-star ratings. The croutons made it soggy and it was just not very flavorful.  VERY spinach-y...I won't be making this again.

This was great.  I've already bought the ingredients to make it again.  We brought it with us on a trip as an "already done-pop it in the oven" thing so we could spend more time with our guests.  The kids were a little leary about eating it but once they tasted it, they loved it.  The 7 year old had 3 helpings.  I left out the mushrooms and spinach b/c I wasn't sure if everyone liked it but I'm sure it would have tasted great included.  I also used restaurant style croutons which were larger and pre-seasoned.  They come in 6 oz boxes and that's just the right amount to cover the bottom of your dish.

Excellent.  Its been a hit each time I've made it.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding to the cooking time maybe 5-10 minutes.  I've made the recipe several times and have found the Brownberry Seasoned Croutons to be the best.  In my opinion the seasoned croutons really add flavor that sets this dish apart from other breakfast casseroles.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this recently for a Father's Day brunch, and it was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it, raved, and helped themselves to seconds (a couple of people had thirds)!  So easy and just irresistably good.  I highly recommend.  I served this with a big fruit salad, toasted bagels, and a few different spreads.  I used egg substitute, reduced-fat soup, and skim milk to make this a bit healthier, but I wasn't able to find the reduced-fat cheeses or sausage (I guess the store was out).  I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

I made this for a retirement breakfast at work (because my co-workers are my willing guinea pigs!). They absolutely loved it! I made two casseroles--one with turkey sausage, the other without meat--and they were completely devoured! I used egg substitute, turkey sausage, reduced fat soup, and 1% milk with wonderful results. This recipe was extremely easy to assemble the night before my event and pop into the oven in the morning as I was getting ready for work.
I have had a bunch of requests for this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!

Very good--one of my guests had 3 helpings!  Instead of seasoned bread crumbs, I used seasoned dry stuffing mix (cubes). I also used reduced-fat sausage so there was very little fat to drain off.  The spinach is an unusual ingredient and is really a wonderful addition.  I will make this one again.  Thanks for sharing, Shannon.

I made this today for a group of friends for a breakfast birthday celebration.  I read so many reviews and was concerned about the 'soggy croutons', so decided to buy sourdough bread (which I love), left the bread crusts on, and made my own croutons from a recipe on AR for sourdough croutons.  I cut them in almost 1" squares.  They came out really good.  I obviously had to double all the quanities, and added bacon as well, extra cheeses (no Monterey Jack available locally, so had to use a mix of cheddar, Gouda and mozzarella).  I was nervous about serving this to guests, having never tried it before, and after assembly, became even more concerned, as it did not look much like the picture, so even though I had already used many more eggs, I added about 6 more with extra milk.  This morning, I baked the casseroles on 350F for about 55 minutes, and I was very happy with the outcome.  No soggy croutons, but slightly like a bread pudding, which I saw one guest absolutely scraping out of the pan!  Our guests couldn't stop telling me how wonderful it was.  Will definitely make again, and will experiment with other ingredients.  Many thanks!

I have been making this breakfast for the holidays for about 3 years now and it is wonderful. I do do a few things differently. I always use skim milk...doesn't change a thing. I also add a bit of garlic powder, sorry I don't measure. I also use the Mexican blend cheese mix and just use 2 cups, it's easier. Last thing I do differently is I don't use spicy sausage, I use breakfast sausage with sage....so good. This is a family favorite and they look forward to it each holiday. Thanks.

Recently my in-laws descended on us and I gave this a try. What a HUGE success. It was healthy, delicious, easy to make and the leftovers microwaved nicely so there was no effort feeding my mom-in-law the next couple of days. And I'm looking like a star "for going to so much trouble".

This is so good! It's beautiful, versatile, and delicious - definitely worthy of a holiday get to together. My variations - I use a bigger casserole dish and enough croutons to cover the bottom. I use ham instead of sausage. I omit the spinach and canned mushrooms. I add onions to the egg/soup mixture and double the eggs and dry mustard with abt a quarter cup more milk than the recipe calls for. Then on half of the dish I add fresh sautéed mushrooms and red peppers on top of the ham before adding the egg mixture on top of the whole dish.

I don't know what I did wrong.  It looked great when it came out of the oven but the croutons on the bottom were soggy and unappealing. I definitely would not recommend it or try it again.

Perfect for a breakfast/brunch, but add in the time to spend from refrigerator to oven---at least an extra hour of time on the day of serving.

Excellent recipe!  The only changes I made were using 6 eggs instead of 4, reducing the milk to 2 cups, placing the spinach frozen on top instead of thawing, and using an italian cheese blend as it is what I had on hand.   Delicious!

Delicious and easy; which is my motto!  Added two extra eggs as recommended by another reviewer.  This is definitely rich and will be saved for the holidays.  Very surprised that my mom and husband squirreled some away for lunch the next day (considering it was a breakfast casserole), but it was very good!

Terrific!  Super easy, and the make ahead aspect makes it a keeper!  I used pepper jack cheese, sauteed fresh mushrooms, garlic/cheese croutons, ditched the mustard, and dusted the top with onion powder. (I had the baby pouched while cooking, so cutting onions was NOT an option!)  After plating, I topped each piece with shredded Parmesan.  Awesome!

YUM.  Easy to throw together.  I left out the mushrooms since I had picky eaters.  I bought large flour tortillas and served breakfast wraps.  I also made some wraps and froze them - great for weekday breakfasts!

This was really good. Made exactly as stated in the recipe but left out the can of mushrooms in fear the kids would not eat it. Also I didn't make it the night before - I just made it right away.

I had to omit the spinach and I only used one kind of cheese.  I also used cooked chopped breakfast sausage.  I also used Pepperidge Farms Herbed stuffing instead of croutons.  I loved it.  I wouldn't make again unless there are more people to feed because the leftovers weren't that great.

This was a hit for brunch.  I took a lot of advice from the other posts and used fresh mushrooms along with adding bacon.  My two year old scarfed it down! Will make this again and again.

This was okay, what I didn't like had nothing to do with the recipe really, only next time I will make it with fresh spinach... the frozen ones just taste like raw iron, to me.

This was great, although our guests kept describing it as a "quiche", which it does seem a bit more like than a breakfast casserole!  I was very nervous about the croutons, but other reviewers are right - great flavor and texture!  We sauteed fresh mushrooms with onions and garlic and added colby jack cheese instead of the 2 kinds of cheese, but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  Excellent!

Excellent.  Made this for the church breakfast and it was a big hit!  If it is let to stand for 10 minutes before cutting, it will set and not be so soupy.

this was incredible.  I scaled it for 40 people and it was delicious.  it did take probably about 10 minutes longer (and at 100 degrees higher) to cook it than the recipe calls for, but everyone wanted the recipe and it was melt0in-your-mouth good.  Perfect consistency and I can't remember when I have had a better breakfast casserole.

Great dish.  I've made this a few times for football tailgates and it's always a gib hit.  I've used "Gimme Lean" soy sausage and no one knew the difference!  This freezes well too.

Wow!  I used fresh chorizo for the sausage, omitted the mushrooms and sauteed 1/2 chopped yellow onion and 4 minced garlic cloves to add to the egg mixture.  I had to bake it a little longer but that's probably my oven's fault.  It was delicious!!!  Brought it to a brunch potluck and it was gone in no time.  Very easy to make, too.

I used less spinach than was called for.  It was really good tho.  I have made almost the same recipe many times but w/out the spinach.  I liked it with it, it makes it look pretty.

Very good, and easy to make.  I made two for a early morning football watching crowd, I followed the exact recipe for one, and left out the spinach and mushrooms in the other (for picky eaters).  Both were excellent and people asked for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  My son was not that fond of the spinach, so I sauteed a pound of sliced mushrooms in butter for a replacement and that was even better.

I made this for a girls weekend at the beach.  For croutons I used Pepperidge Farm seasoned stuffing mix -- about 3 cups on the bottom and another cup or so sprinkled on top for crunch.  I reduced the milk to 2 cups.  I added about 1/2 cup chopped onion while browning the sausage.  It took just over an hour at 325 to set up well, after being in the fridge overnight and left at room temp for about 30 minutes prior to baking.  Everyone loved it!  Be aware that this is more of a spinach casserole with some egg than an egg casserole with some spinach -- the spinach is defintely the standout flavor.  I will  make it again but would like to experiment with different bread bases, and next time I'll add more cheese.  I also think it might be interesting to substitute crab meat for the spinach.

I made it exactly how the recipe called for the most part. I didn't have ground mustard so I just put about a tablespoon of regular yellow mustard and added garlic and onion powder. It turned out perfect and delicious! Will be making again!!

Delicious. I made it twice over the holidays once with spinach and the other time with chopped broccoli. Both times I used cubed stuffing mix. Spicy pork sausage made the spice subtle but there. definitely will make again

Everyone loved this casserole and it was very easy to make.  I would add more vegetables next time (zucchini?) and not use seasoned breadcrumbs (made it way too salty).

I tried this recipe for the very first time with my Sister in Christ Bible Study.  It was wonderful and everyone loved it.  So did my husband.  This is a keeper, so different from the other breakfast casseroles out there.  I like the fact that you only use 4 eggs.  I used fat free milk, heart healthy cream of mushroom soup, and both cheeses were with 2% milk fat. I will use egg substitute next time and see how it works. This is a great recipe....loved that it had spinach.  Have a great day and God Bless.

I made this for coffee hour at church this morning.  Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I did not make any changes, although I threw in extra cheese (both kinds).  I also made a veggie version for some of our congregation by just eliminating the sausage and adding a bit more of each of the other ingredients. Loved the taste and also absolutely loved how easy it was to put together!

Made this for a church breakfast and it was a success.
Very tasty and easy to prepare. Like other reviewers, I sauteed onion, fresh mushrooms with the sausage and also made sure to drain everything well before adding on top of the croutons. Used about 3 cups of croutons to make sure there was a good layer in the bottom of the dish. Did not have any "soggy crouton" problems that others reported. Look forward to making this one again and playing with different vegetables.

Even though I don't particularly love eggs, I loved this casserole. My coworkers loved it as well - I got a lot of compliments for it and also had a couple people ask for the recipe. I've made this dish twice, always according to the recipe except I omitted the mushrooms and spinach. Still tastes amazing!

Wish I could give this a better review.  Tried it beacuse of the spinach.  Turned out ok but tasted like the soup instead of egg.  Will be sticking with Zippy Egg Casserole from this website and adding spinach to it.

This was wonderful!  I took if for breakfast at church and our worship leader asked during the service who brought the yummy breakfast casserole with the spinach and mushroom.  I did add an extra egg, some bacon, extra croutons and fresh mushrooms. I will definitely be making this again.

This was great!  Easy to put together with great flavour.  A hit with friends for brunch.  I've made this easy casserole a few times and it has always been great.  Substitued asparagus for the mushrooms (a friend did not like mushrooms) and added cream of corn to the mix for nice surprise.  Making substitutions to this recipe is simple and its always delicious.

The croutons and cream of mushroom soup are brilliant additions to the breakfast casserole idea.  I've made lots of breakfast casseroles with just regular bread, and just milk/cream, and the flavor and texture was not as good as this.  I used Pecorino Romano insteadf of Jack cheese, and made mine in an 8X8 dish, so I cut back on the milk, sausage, and spinach to accommodate the smaller dish.  I made this for a friend yesterday morning, and she's quite a foody and cook.  She went back for seconds, and commented especially about the texture and flavor.  Thanks for posting this, Shannon Marie.  I'll use it again and again.

I regret that I had to change this recipe a bit due to some miscommunication with my shopper.(DH) I had to use some crusty french bread rather than croutons and cheddar cheese instead of the montereay jack.  I used more eggs- 10 I think & everyone loved it!

We did not like this recipe that much but it may just be our taste. I used an off brand of sausage and that might have made a difference but it was very heavy and was not a big hit. We didn't have leftovers. It was certainly eatable but I probably won't make again.

I have made this a few times now and the whole family LOVES it.  It's so convenient to for going to the cottage so I don't have to wast my time cooking and doing the cooking dishes.  And the left overs are a great treat too!

Very easy to make. I did not add the spinach since my family does not like it, instead added a bit of parsley. I also used spicy turkey sausage to cut some of the fat. I did end up cooking this dish for a extra half hour, it didn't seem to set up in the 55 min. called for. Overall, a very good dish.

This is very similar to one that I make that is delicious!  One thing that I do differently is I use cream of potato soup (instead of mushroom).  It adds a nice little something extra, kind of like mini hashbrowned potatoes.  (Also, my recipe doesn't call for spinach nor mushrooms.)

I hate to be the spoiler here but my family did not care for this casserole!! In all fairness-I made with all reduced fat ingredients and I am sure that affected the outcome.  However, we did not like the croutons--they seemed soggy and not very tasty?? Even thought I love spinach and my famiy doesn't, I thought it would be okay since it was mixed with lots of other ingredients but I think that if you don't like spinach--you should leave it out or not make this casserole. I am sorry we didnt care for it--I was really excited about the reviews!!!

This was a crowd pleaser! Everyone loved it. Several went for seconds and wanted the recipe. One gal in our group is a vegetarian so I made one without the sausage and replaced it with green and red peppers. For the one I made with meat I also added crumbled bacon and peppers. In addition I saved half of the cheese to use on top; I added it half way through the cooking process. I will definitely make this again and look forward to experimenting with more add-ins.

This was so easy and so good!  I used pre-cooked ground beef and a squirt of regular mustard instead of dry to make it even easier and it was still very tasty!  Only thing is, it seemed to need an extra 10-15 minutes cooking time.  (although, once done it seemed to keep on cooking itself en route to my destination--so be careful wiht that!)

I didn't have enough croutons so I used what I had and then made some toast and broke it into pieces on the bottom.  I used an extra egg for the heck of it, and forgot the mushroom and spinach.  I added some bacon bits to the egg mixture, and next time I'll put in diced onion and green pepper.  Overall, it was really good, and great to make in advance

I've made this twice, once with herb stuffing mix, 6 eggs, and a full can of mushroom soup.  I served it to my women friends for brunch, and it was such a hit that they asked to take the leftovers home.  
I thought it was a little salty, so the second time I added a half teaspoon of salt to the milk mixture, added a sautéed large onion and sautéed sliced fresh mushrooms with garlic powder, dried thyme and oregano.  No canned soup.  And I used diced French bread.  My husband loved it so much that he had it for dinner tonight.

Overall this was very easy to make and taste good. I think there were two places where it lacked, one of them was no fault of the recipe. I purchased Bob Evans “Hot” sausage. The sausage was lacking in the flavor department. I bet sausage from a local butcher would have helped greatly. The other, instead of croutons, potatoes might have given it a less mushy and more rewarding texture. Again, overall, very good. I will make it again with slight modifications.

I really enjoyed this as did my family!! I happened to have 
some heavy cream in the fridge so instead of milk I subbed that. Yumm very creamy and rich also added onion while browning the sausage and used smoked gouda and cheddar!! This will be my new go to breakfast casserole  replacing an 8 year fave.

I wanted to make something a little different for Christmas morning this year and chose this recipe.  My entire family was very glad I did!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added sauteed onions and mushrooms.  I also used about 4 cups of croutons and added an extra egg.  It turned out beautifully - nice and light, not runny at all as mentioned by others.  We only had a little bit leftover and that was snapped up by my dad and brother for lunch!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe!  I sautéed onions and celery with the sausage and added some sage.  I made the stuffing according to the package.  Because the stuffing was already cooked I only added 1 cup of milk. I used 6 eggs instead of 4.  It was fabulous.

Absolutely wonderful! Very easy to make. You do everything at night and when you get up in the morning put casserole in oven. I have a gas oven and it took 50 minutes to cook. Our Sunday School Class loved it. Some  of my friends wanted the recipe. I told them go to all reciepes.com.  If you hardly have any cooking skills you definitely can make this. I can't wait to try the next recipe! This also a colorful dish. The spinach adds good coloring.

I made this casserole for Christmas morning, and it turned out great. I did make a few adjustments. I used regular sausage (not spicy), added about a cup of sliced, fresh mushrooms (not canned), and used sharp cheddar cheese. It baked up very nicely and was very filling and yummy!

I cooked this for our church leadership meal, and LOVED it!  The seasoned croutons add a unique flavor that beats the blandness of many breakfast casseroles.  I will be making this again -- probably for holidays as advised!

Brought this into work and WOW!  WAS IT GOOD!  The only thing I would change is to add more of the egg mixture to make the peices thicker.  But, as is....it's awesome!!  Just needed more of it. : )

I made this recipe last night for dinner b/c I wanted to try it out before I made it for a meeting and it turned out to be bland.  I'm probably not going to attempt this one again.

This was a really nice easy breakfast.  I cooked it for my sons sleep over.  I cooked cinnamon rolls as well but after the kids had finished off the rolls, they all wanted the casserole too. It smelled so good.

This really is the best casserole.  It took WAY longer to set up than expected though, and I even reduced the amount of milk to 2 c.  I also used fresh mushrooms sauteed in olive oil with minced onion and garlic salt and then wilted some fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Added extra mustard as well.  I used soy sausage and soy milk, and my family loved it.  Just needs a LOT of extra baking time!  Also, I may not make it ahead next time to keep the croutons crunchier...

For all the great reviews, I really thought this casserole would be amazing. Unfortunately, it was not.  My husband and I agree that it is missing something. If I make it again, I'll add onion, garlic, maybe some salt and pepper. It's a bit too meaty - I'd use half the meat, maybe switch to bacon for some more flavor.

Wonderful-- I made it for Easter brunch and the family loved it! Next time, I might try homemade whole wheat croutons  so it will be more healthy. I used low fat sausage and it tasted great!

I halved the recipe, except I used the whole can of mushrooms.  It was very, very flavorful, not too spinach-y at all, as another reviewer commented.  It is, however, very soggy, which some people like.  I like a more firm casserole.  The flavor is so wonderful, I may give this recipe another try and tweak it by adding more eggs, reducing the milk and perhaps adding a few cubed potatoes.

This is a very forgiving recipe.  I forgot to mix in the spinach, so I beat a couple of eggs and some milk with the spinach and poured it on top of the rest.  It was a little odd to have a "crispy spinach topping", but tasted great, and actually looked cool.  It also worked out quite well to make it on Christmas Eve and cook Christmas morning before the kids woke up.  Best to find sausage without MSG (harder to find than you might think).  I'll definitely make this again.

I modified this recipe and the casserole turned out to be very tasty and flavorful.  I followed previous suggestions and omitted the croutons and cream of mushroom soup.  I used 6 slices of frozen garlic bread, 6 eggs and 1 Cup half-and-half.  The garlic bread gave the casserole lots of flavor!

I made this just as it is listed based on the rave reviews and got many compliments.  I like the strong mushroom flavor given by the soup.  I have found that Swiss cheese goes very well with mushrooms so I might try it using that another time. Definitely worth making.

Just made this recipe last night for a brunch today.  I opted for Fresh spinach and for ham instead of Sausage.  I think these choices made it a little too bland.  Compared to the Blue Cheese Strata, this was only so-so.  Maybe sausage would liven it up a bit.  Green onions would help, too.

Our family loves this savory breakfast casserole. My husband and I have been doing the South Beach Diet, and this is a nice alternative to the usual scrambled eggs.  I would like to find a substitute for the croutons to make it truly lo-carb.  I might try making my own croutons next time with whole grain bread and a few seasonings.  It's great to freeze, too!

I needed something last minute for our apartment community brunch and only had 9 eggs.  I threw this together (no mushrooms or spinach but added onions) and it ended up being the favorite dish.  I was told that next time I need to make more of it, and to think it was the one I was unsure of.

loved this...made several times for family brunches, etc.  I used fresh mushrooms (sauteed with onions and garlic, of course) and everyone REALLY liked it, and asked for the recipe.

Made this for Easter breakfast. Wow! I used ground turkey (seasoned like pork) and 1/2 eggs and 1/2 egg beaters. Wonderful. Thank you!

Very Good!! Everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently was exclude the mushrooms (I don't really like mushrooms), but I did use the mushroom soup. It was perfect!

This has become a new family favourite.  I served this at our 2019 Christmas brunch, and everyone raved about it!  I will be making this many times in the years to come; in fact, I think family will come to expect it.

The only ingredient substitution I made was to use regular Cheddar cheese rather than sharp, as I am not a fan of sharp cheddar, and the Monterey Jack does have a distinctive flavour of its own.  In future, I may also experiment with using fresh spinach - I like the idea of finding whole spinach leaves in the casserole.

WOW, this casserole was so easy and absolutely delicious! As suggested by another, I used stuffing/dressing mix instead of the croutons. I think the seasonings in the stuffing mix took this recipe over the top. I will definitely make this again and again.

It was delicious, and my Sunday School class liked it! I added more croutons than the recipe called for, and it turned out too “bready” for me. Next time I’ll follow the recipe more closely. I may add pimentos next time for color. I used mild sausage instead of spicy because I don’t usually like spicy hot. I used black pepper instead of cayenne for the same reason.

This was good, albeit a bit 'mushy' in texture. I'm not sure it helps to build it the night before. Might be better off simply making on the spot? 

I did enjoy the spinach and other flavors that aren't usually in a breakfast casserole.

I made it according to directions. The bread on the bottom doesn’t crisp up at all but it’s not a bad texture. I cooked it an extra 20 minutes because it was nowhere near done when it said it would be. (Oven is accurate. ) overall I’d say it’s ok but not 5 stars.

I used plain unseasoned croutons but sprinkled with Garlic and Onion powder.  I think it could've used a little more more spice. I have yet to make it with seasoned croutons, we shall see, overall, it was good

Easy to make and absolutely delicious!  Adults and kids both loved it.  I used regular Owen's pork sausage, but think it would have been tastier with the spicy sausage.

Say no to croutons. I make a version of this when guest are over at our beach house. I use left over baked potatoes from the night before and/or cook up a bag of hash browns with peppers & onions in it.

the only thing I changed is I used thinly sliced sausage links and I added onions and I only had one cup of shredded cheddar cheese so I used slices of Monterey Jack sole across the tops before pouring the spinach egg mixture on top. To me the croutons were just too soggy and I more of a texture person how to get the crust more hard or crunchy I don't know I've kept it in the oven up to the temperature and it still is a little too soggy for me but the flavors are amazing.

It was wonderful!  I sauteed fresh spinach, fresh sliced mushrooms, chopped onions and chopped garlic, then layered it over the sausage.  Then made the egg mixture separately and poured it over everything.  It was delish!  Everyone wanted the recipe!

After reading the reviews I slightly altered recipe. I added 2 more eggs,  fresh sautéed mushrooms and used Stovetop stuffing instead of croutons. I also baked it about 15 min longer. 
It was the best breakfast casserole I’ve served my family! They all thought it was great. It was moist but not soggy and very flavorful!

Great recipe! Except for adding an extra cup of croutons and using fresh spinach instead of frozen, I followed the recipe to a tee. I used store brand butter garlic croutons, 2% milk, and medium Country Boy sausage.  Used store brand cream of mushroom, store brand sharp cheddar cheese and store brand Monterey Jack. Cooked for about one hour at 350 degrees. The last ten minutes I covered it so it wouldn’t brown anymore. It looked great and tasted even better. Very, very good!!! Will make again.

Very very good. I used 6 eggs instead of 4. I added 1/2 pound of bacon and I sauteed fresh mushroom and onions . I actually use hash-browns mixed with the croutons for the base. I bake this without any foil or anything on top because it needs to dry out a bit, for about an hour, then take it out and put some more cheese on it...then bake it for about 10 more minutes with the cheese. When I want to make it spicy, I saute Serrano peppers with the onions and mushrooms. All this takes more time, but makes it so tasty. Last, the kids and I will eat it with Tapatio hot-sauce, although a bit salty, it's the way we like it.

Good, nice and easy. Better when it sits for 10 minutes or so.
So that it can fir up a bit before cutting and serving. I makes a lot for two people, Next time I'll cut the recipe in half.

Delicious.  I did take the advise of another and put the croutons on top.  Had company overnight and it was ready when everyone was up and ready for breakfast.  It was the perfect.

I assembled this dish and cooked it for an hour.  I then reheated it in the oven on warm for an hour and it was perfect!  I thought it might have eliminated the soggy stuffing but it didn't but that was ok!  I used 6 eggs.  I also added 1/2 pound bacon to the pork.  I saved the drippings and sautéed the fresh spinach and mushrooms I used in it.  I used mrs. cubbisons herb stuffing instead of croutons.  This dish was awesome.

My husband has been making this over the last couple years for his men's group whenever he has them over for breakfast and they just love it - it's simple, tasty, and more "manly" than a quiche Ha!  It has turned into a "go-to" now when we go camping as well.   On our last trip recently we forgot to bring the spinach so we improvised with a Cranberry Kale salad mix leaving out the cranberries of course and sauteed the salad in some of the sausage oil & butter.  We thought best to pick out the larger pieces of the kale stems.  With the kale, broccoli and carrot slivers, and all it turned out fantastic and we'll be doing this going forward!

Made this for a brunch and it was a huge hit.  Like other reviewers, I modified the recipe by using 6 eggs, a full bag of croutons, and two cans of mushrooms.  I ended up making two casseroles to feed the whole crowd and cooked them for about 1 hour 5 minutes.  There were no leftovers and multiple requests for the recipe!  I did not have any problem with it being too runny... the texture was perfect!

Made with 8 eggs, and 1.5 cups of white sauce instead of country gravy since we didn't have any country gravy on hand. Slightly browned the shredded hash browns ahead of time. Used chicken sausage and baked in a 9x13 pan. Recipe turned out very good.

Excellent, used six eggs per other comments and Jimmy Dean hot sausage, added a bit of Italian seasoning.  Turned out perfect for breakfast the next morning. Highly recommend.

This was a hit! I made it for a baby shower brunch and many commented how good it was. I even shared the recipe. Following other reviewers I browned onions and chopped fresh mushrooms with my sausage and then left out the canned mushrooms. Also, because I was making it to share, I used foil cupcake liners and made individual servings. There were leftovers so my husband got to try it and said it was really good. I have another request for a breakfast dish coming up so I'll be making it again.

This one is a keeper.  Easy prep, and it came  out perfectly.  I used fresh mushrooms and chopped up a bag of fresh baby spinach instead of using frozen, which can be watery, and was very satisfied with the results. I also added fresh dill.  I like how this recipe lends itself to easy adaptations. I could see making an Italian take with spicy sausage, tomato, chopped zucchini,etc.

Used hashbrowns instead of croutons, swiss instead of monterrey jack and eliminated the mushrooms. Reduced milk to 1.5 cups. Added 1/2 lb of bacon, cooked and chopped.  Sauteed fresh spinach in the bacon grease. Phenomenal!

I have served this many times and always get great praise.  Easy to make ahead of time and watch it go.  We go out in our Motorhome for weeks.  I make bake and then freeze in 2 person serving.  Great reheated in micro or oven.

We added kale to ours, which we really liked. We also had to use homemade croutons, which aren't as dry as store bought, so we used 1/4c less milk than the recipe called for. We drained the fat off of the sausage and also padded it with paper towels, but the croutons still seemed a bit soggy. Next time I will try using even less milk to see if that helps. Overall, I'd recommend trying it!

Excellent, everyone loved it!  Made over the weekend when I had a house full for a family wedding.  Biggest advantage that I could make the day ahead and just toss it in the oven in the next morning!  Easy peasy.   Definitely will make again.

I made this for a potluck everyone loved it I took advice of one of the reviews. I added 6 eggs and used fresh mushrooms and cooked them with the sausage and used onion and instead of Monterey cheese I used pepper jack cheese I will make it again.

It's true, I think it requires more cooking time and probably less milk, or more solids. I changed it a bit, instead of 2 and 1/4 of milk, I only added 2. Baked for 1 hour. Canadian bacon instead of sausage, broccoli instead of spinach. Did not added the mushrooms, just the condensed mushroom cream. This thing is DELICIOUS!

I used mild Italian sausage and fresh mushrooms, otherwise followed recipe. It was really good. Leftovers warmed in the microwave were great too.

This is a fantastic recipe. I mostly follow the recipe. I just use whatever type of cheese and croutons I have on hand. I take this to a moms' group and always receive loads of compliments. I imagine you could dress it up as many reviewers have suggested, but I'm thrilled with the recipe as is. The only thing I'll mention is that it usually takes a bit of extra time to cook, but that could just be my oven.

Really really great easy dish to make. 
Made it several times thinking I can have it for a day or so and always end up eating it in 1 day! My 18 month old loves it as well which is always a plus.

We really enjoyed this a lot!  It took almost twice as long to cook as the recipe stated, so definitely account for that.  Also, the spinach was a bit much.  It was ok, but I think the recipe would have benefited if I had cut the amount of spinach in half and maybe added some sautéed peppers and onions or something in it's place.

Delicious!  I used chicken Italian sausage, fresh mushrooms sautéed with a quarter onion  (instead of canned mushrooms), all the rest per recipe.  And yum! But seems like 8 servings not 10.

I made it with fresh mushrooms, which may have been part of the problem, was really wet.  I also felt there wasn't enough bread and too much spinach.  I had to cook for 10-15 minutes longer than suggested and still wasn't super pleased with the outcome.

Absolutely delish! I was worried about using croutons since similar recipes use bread or crescent rolls. I chose Caesar croutons since they are seasoned with Parmesan cheese, and let me tell you, they were superb in this dish. My changes to the recipe: I sautéed fresh mushrooms and spinach in a little butter  instead of using using canned. I had 2 egg yolks left from an earlier recipe and I added them as well. I used hot pork sausage which gave it a nice bite, but kids may prefer a milder sausage.

Excellent breakfast casserole.  I was a huge hit Christmas morning.  Only tweaks were that I used two 5oz bags of seasoned croutons and two 8oz packages of fresh sliced mushrooms that were sautéed down and 6 eggs.
To get a better distribution of ingredients, the sausage, sauteed mushrooms, and croutons were all stirred into the egg mixture, and then poured into the casserole pan.

This is delicious.  I am always looking for something different for breakfast and this is perfect. I used cream of celery soup instead of mushrooms, and I used Italian turkey sausage without the casing. I love it. Thank you so much!

Delicious! It is important to note in the recipe that the mixture MUST rest overnight in the fridge, or it won't set properly. Since canned mushroom soup is a dead giveaway, I use cream of celery instead,

This turned out great but I made changes that may address the soggy outcome some experienced. Six eggs instead of four, whipping cream instead of milk, eight slices of cheap white bread instead of croutons. I also used crab instead of sausage (which is actually more watery) and I baked at 350.  Do let it set for 10 minutes or so. It's a good base and you can mix and match meats and cheeses if you stick with the cited quantities.

Delicious.  I used 1 pound Jimmy Dean mild sausage, Hormel real bacon bits, one tub of fresh mushrooms, 2 c shredded Velveeta, 7 eggs, spinach,  seasoned croutons, and a dash of milk.  I didn't have mushroom soup on hand, but it was good without it. I did not make it ahead and popped it right in the oven. I will definitely make this again and will try it with the mushroom soup and per my husband's suggestion, a little less cheese.

This is delish and fun to make! I added a pound of crumbled bacon. I used fresh spinich that I sauteed in a bit of bacon grease, then drained on paper towels. Then I browned the sausage and part way thru I browned fresh mushrooms. Because of adding the extras I used 6 eggs. This was loved by all at our Sunday brunch for just 4 and we are having left-overs for dinner tonight! I will be making this again. Very good! I served this with shredded hash browns and fruit salad.

It was delicious! When I made it I thought it didn't seem "eggy" enough but I'm glad I didn't add more egg mixture. It cooked up perfectly & was a big hit!

Big hit with our Easter brunch. Had some leftover ham I needed to use, so didn't bother with the sausage. It re-heats beautifully!

This is great for a base recipe and nice that it can be made in advance.  I tried it per exact recipe and was disappointed.  The flavor was bland, but the second time I added more sauteed mushrooms and onions, a little ham, bacon and more cheese. Everyone loved it.

Pretty good recipe.  I think next time I will put the crumbs/stuffing etc, on top for a crust. It was very runny on the inside, perhaps more eggs next time will help that. Otherwise it's a pretty good base for a breakfast casserole. I also left out the mustard and just used a herbal seasoning on the bread crumbs.

i made it without the sausage and it was good, but I bet with the sausage I'd have given it a 5 star rating. Maybe next time I'll try some turkey or chicken sausage.

Yummy.  I love this with some salsa and sour cream.
