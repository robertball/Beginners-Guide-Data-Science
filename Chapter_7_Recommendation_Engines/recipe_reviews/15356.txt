I added a good dark German beer when I added the cabbage, it gave it a wonderful extra flavor.

This was delicious!  Starts off looking a little weird, but I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great.  My finicky 4-year-old, and my husband who despises cabbage, both loved it (me too)!

This was great. Filling, cheap to make, easy! I do think, the cabbage is a little overcooked. I would reduce the last 20 minute simmer to about 10. Also, next time, I will find a less spicy sausage. We used one, and it had too much kick!

I was looking for a way to use some leftover Bratwurst Patties and did a search for "bratwurst" on this site. What a hit! Wonderful recipe. My whole family ate it up! I substituted 2 cups of shredded mixed blend cheese (Mont. Jack/Cheddar) instead of the Swiss. And I added 1 teaspoon of curry powder to the mix. A real keeper!

I loved this soup! My girlfriend doesnt eat any soup besides chicken noodle and she loved this soup to.
 I did changed it up a bit. Along with the bratwurst i also added a half pound of bacon. I cut it up into 1 inch long strips and cooked it with the bratwurst.
 I was out of swiss cheese and found that a slice of american cheese in each bowl was a great substitute.
 I added a minced clove of fresh garlic and a few shakes of red pepper flakes when browning the meat.
 I also substituted corn beef broth (from the night before) for the water. 
 I WILL make again.

Excellent and will definitely make again. I used Turkey Bratwurst and thought it worked well.  I also added red pepper flakes, garlic powder, salt, soy sauce and replaced 1 cp of water with 1 cup of chicken broth.

I didn't know what to do with the deer bratwurst my husband brought home that had been in the freezer for a year.  I used this recipe and added white pepper, cayeene, pepper, some more salt, beef bullion and a bay leaf.  It was delicious.  Thank you so much for posting!

Great soup. I used italian sausage and substituted broccoli for the cabbage. Other than that it just needed salt for our taste. My kids and hubby loved it. Next time I'll try it with cabbage and bratwurst

This was a perfect, comforting soup for a cold day like today! The only thing I had to change was that I did not have any swiss cheese, but I did have some Velveeta, so I subbed that. Other than the cheese, I made this exactly as written and was rewarded with a delicious, hearty soup taht my hubby went crazy for. So simple too...I will definately be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this for my husband last night. He loved it! I didn't have real swiss so I used laughing cow light + gruyere + American (melted it in the microwave first, then mixed it in at the end) worked out well. Also used Lactaid instead of real milk, kinda tasty. And garnished with fresh chopped parsley. Will definitely be making it again!

Everyone loved this soup...except for son, he does not care for bratwurst. I did not have swiss cheese so I used sharp cheddar.  I also added a little cream cheese. Yummy!!!

This was quite tasty...a great comfort food.  I followed the recipe exactly but used kielbasa instead of bratwurst, just because I love kielbasa and cabbage together.  I will definitely be making this again.  Just as a note, I used red potatoes, as they tend to hold up better than russet potatoes.  They were tender but didn't turn to mush.

I don't know if I did something wrong but this just did not turn out five-star at all, which really surprised me from the reviews.  I tried to follow the recipe exactly.  After the first 20 minutes of simmering the potatoes, I added the cabbage and realized my potatoes are going to be mushy by the time the cabbage cooks all the way (which made the soup more like a very thick stew).  Half way through simmering the cabbage, I realized it's not cooking fast enough and there was not enough liquid.  I threw in about a half cup of chicken broth and still had to simmer the cabbage for about 30 minutes overall (by that time I had no potatoes left in my soup at all).  I bought fresh Swiss cheese from a deli in a block and cut it up into small chunks but even after simmering for an additional 10 minutes trying to melt the cheese, it did not dissolve (perhaps shredded would of worked better).  Then in the end, the soup was very tasteless (although it smelt really really good).  I added salt and pepper which made it a little better but it was still VERY bland. I think in the end, the recipe is missing some sort of spice that will take it to the next level and I think the cooking instructions need to be altered.

This is a great soup! It has a very nice consistency and flavor. Easy to make and proud to serve. I used sweet Italian sausage, which I didn't like. We'll go regular or spicy next time. Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe!  All six eaters devoured it and asked for the recipe.  Followed recipe as stated with minor changes as suggested by others.  Did not peel the potatoes, healthier and easier anyway, and added chicken bouillon granuals to the water.  Since I also added an extra potato, I added l more cup of broth.  It needed it.  For the cheese I used half shredded cheddar and half spicy jack for a little kick.  I also prefer to make my thickening with corn starch instead of flour to avoid the lumps.  Thank you Marbalet!

this was delicious - my whole picky family loved it! I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but I made 3 changes out of necessity. I had celery that was past its prime, so I added it to sneak in some more vegetables. I doubled the recipe and substituted 2 C water for 2 C chicken broth. My husband is allergic to nitrites and nitrates and I could not find bratwurst without them, but I did find ham without. So good!

Very tasty!! Needs more spices/salt but other than that, the original recipe is solid. This is a great "main dish" soup and makes fantastic leftovers. We ate it with cheddar cheese garnish and french bread! YUM.  The other reviewers are right - it looks weird until you're done adding the milk, but turns out great. To save time, I put the cabbage and the potatoes in at the same time and simmer for 20 - 25 minutes.    I always add a cube of chicken boullion, and salt, pepper and red pepper flakes to taste.

Good, I'll definitely make again. I used broth instead of water and did not have swiss cheese, so just omitted that step. It took a while to thicken up, so I might adjust that in the future, but overall was really good. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good!  Fresh brats definitely help with the flavor of this recipe.  I live in Wisconsin...so they are readily available.  I used a little more water, but I think that was needed because of the amount of potatos I put in.  I also added some s&p, and red pepper flakes.  This was great.  The ratios can easily be adjusted.  Definitely a winner!

Easy, delicious, hearty soup. My only complaint was it tasted a bit too much like flour for my taste, but no one else seemed to notice.

Outstanding! The only ingredient I changed was using a can of low sodium chicken broth instead of the water (although I added about 1/2 cup water to give enough liquid to cover bratwurst and potatoes).  I also cooked the onion with the bratwurst meat, because I prefer my onion to be browned in soups.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and it is fantastic.  Thanks for such a great, easy dish!  ETA: I think the blandness other reviewers experienced had to do with the type of bratwurst they used.  Be sure to get a good, "real", fresh Wisconsin bratwurst and you can't go wrong!

Really good.  I had to add a lot of salt and pepper for flavor and I didn't use near as much cabbage as it called for.

Great soup. I made this last year and lost the recipe, I am so glad i found it again. The only thing that i did different was i added salt and pepper and substituted kielbasa instead of bratwurst. Great soup!

I doubled the recipe...  Did not use any flour... After I fried up the bratwurst, I dumped it on several paper towels, then blotted it with some more towels to get rid of some of the fat.

My husband LOVED this soup (I did too)!  Only changes made were: -Used beef broth (all I had on hand) instead of the water. -Left skin on potatoes. Next time, I'll use chicken broth and a different kind of sausage (something spicy).  Oh- and yes, it looks a little strange when you're cooking- but if you follow the directions, everything will turn out great.  Also, even better the second day.  Definitely a winter weather keeper!

Really good.  I added several cloves of minced garlic, a few shakes of red pepper flakes and 4 slices of bacon chopped into 1 inch pieces.  Cooked the bacon and sausage together until bacon was cooked through and the sausage was browned.  Also followed others' advice and only boiled the cabbage for 10ish minutes.

Good, but not as good as I was expecting with all the rave reviews here. I used smoked brats, leeks instead of onions, less cabbage, and not as much flour. It was definitely better the 2nd day, so make extra!

Wow. This was extremely good. I say "was" because the double portion I made is pretty much gone. I used 1.5 pkg of brats (1.24lbs ea.). I used 2/3 head of cabbage, 3 large potatos, 1 onion, and I added 2 huge handsful of fresh brusselsprouts (halved), 6C milk, 1/4C flour, and seasoned to taste. Wow. wow wow wow. My high school sophomore son said "no no no" as I was cooking it. He was upset I was making a soup out of the brats.  But we heard nothing but silence (with slurping) at the dinner table. Excellent recipe. Thanks so much.  The 2 yr old and the 5 yr old devoured 2 bowls each. Loved it. Can't say enough.

Based on other reviews I used chicken broth instead of water and added fresh garlic & celery to step one.  Also, I used Velveeta instead of Swiss because it is more economical and I had tripled the recipe to serve at my tavern.  Turned out to be delicious!

This was so yummy. My kids kept coming into the kitchen to taste it as I was cooking. They were excited for dinner. I did however add some fresh minced garlic, salt, pepper and blanched spinach to the recipe. I used less of the cabbage as well, and I put that in during the browning stage.

WOW! This soup is wonderful! My husband can't stop raving about it! He says it's a taste explosion. (Of course, he loves bratwurst.) His eyes opened so wide after just one bite! I did season it up. Will definitely make again.

I loved this soup.  Was afraid of using milk but I'm so glad I gave it a try.  I did doctor it a little because it was abit bland.  As in previous reviews I added soy sauce, a bit of red pepper powder and liquid smoke..served with some crusty bread and made my husband a happy man...definitely will make again

Not really crazy about the bratwurst, but otherwise the combo of the potato & cabbage was very nice.  Good base for a potato soup w/a spin, but next time I definitely won't use brats, maybe bacon which would complement the cabbage nicely.  There wasn't enough liquid to cook the cabbage, had to add an extra 1/2 c. as some others suggested.  Also, was a big bland so we spiced it up w/some seasoning (salt, pepper, dash of Frank's Red Hot, etc.) which brought out the flavors.  Well worth making again, but will not follow the recipe as written.

This is a great recipe - but I was concerned about it being flavorful, and having enough liquid, so I added:

1 can (2 cups) chicken stock
red pepper - flakes
red pepper - powder
worcestershire
Paul Prudhomme's - about 2-3 tbsp
additional cheese - colby jack cheddar
garlic powder

and it came out FANTASTICALLY!  Would definitely make this one again!

Spectacular.  What an easy recipe to prepare, with ingredients that are often on-hand at our house.  I did not remove the bratwurst castings; it seemed more trouble than it would have been worth.  I used three potatoes and added another 1/2 cup of water after I added the cabbage.  There wasn't any liquid to "boil," that's when I added the extra water.  I did use a little garlic salt and fresh ground pepper.  My wife was totally impressed and I rarely impress her with my cooking.

My family LOVES cabbage, so this recipe already started out on the right foot! I followed the recipe, except for following Holly's suggestion of using sweet italian sausage instead of bratwurst (a favorite of my husband's). We will surely make this again!

Very simple yet so yummy. Here are the changes either out of necessity or I felt I should. I had some leftover brats but not a pound so I fried up 2 bacon strips. Then used the oil from the bacon to saute the onion for 10 minutes. Added some minced garlic and brats and sauteed for a couple more minutes. Substituted 1 cup of water with chicken broth. Only cooked the cabbage for 15 minutes like others suggested. In addition to milk I added a splash of heavy whipping cream because I had some in the fridge. Oh and I threw in a couple sprigs of parsley because I had some. Added quite a bit of salt and some black pepper. Didn't have swiss cheese so I used some parm, but really didn't need it. Thought I would get the raw flour taste but not at all. My boyfriend said "this kitchen sink soup is good."
I created an account on this website just so that I can post this review, which is huge.
Thanks for all the suggestions and the recipe.

We had a cold day with several inches of snow on the ground.  I had 2 extra hungry young men in addition to my two.  I looked in the freezer and saw some brats and knew they couldn't be cooked on the grill because it was covered in snow. Grilling was the only way I have ever had brats. I began searching for a recipe using them and was glad to find this.  But I had no cabbage.  So I took the brats out of the casings and peeled several large potatoes.  I diced them and cooked them in chicken broth, just enough to cover. Diced the onion and put it in there also.  Added the cooked meat after I drained it really well.  Added heavy cream, salt and pepper and a garlic and herb blend from Wildtree because I have a friend who sells that stuff. I had so much my dutch oven was full.  I used about 2 cups or less of heavy cream, 1/2 and 1/2 would have been fine but I needed to use what I had because of the snow storm. That is all I put in it.  Served it to my husband and the 4 young men who were here and it was all gone, they loved it.  I only got a taste but it was delicious.  Was wonderful to find such a great and versatile recipe when I was desperate to feed these man/boys. It was very heavy, perfect for the weather.  I wouldn't want to serve it in the summer.

Somewhat bland . . . missing its umph! Will make it again, but will be adding a bit more spice to it--perhaps some red pepper? The cabbage, itself, was a wonderful surprise that made 'plain jane' potato soup a notch above!

I made this in my slow cooker this morning. I cut the brats into 1inch pieces and then browned them. I added all of the ingredients except for the 1cup of milk and the flour and let it cook on low all day. I thickened it when I got home from work. It was delicious!

This recipe was a hit.  Though I will probably cook the bratwurst so that it is slightly crunchy.  That way it will be a little less mushy in the soup.  Great taste with the swiss cheese....yum.

Very good!  I made it last night for a work function and just had to taste test it. I think my coworkers will love it!  I was concerned with the lack of spices, but the cheese and bratwurst provide enough salt and flavor.

We did not like this combination of ingredients at all.  My DH wanted to try it because he really likes sausage soups and after reading the recipe I knew it would be bland so we added lots of fennel seeds and sage and while that helped we couldn't get past the watery, milky broth and chewy cabbage. We were able to finish one bowl, but the rest had to be thrown away.  We will not be making this again.

This was delicious. My bf was wary at first, but he loved it too.  This was a rather large batch for just two of us so I froze some.  Froze and defrosted nicely. :)

This is a very good recipe.Even my son, who doesn't like cabbage, kept complimenting it! I couldn't believe he even tried it!It is a bit bland though for me.I really liked it although I added some fresh cracked black pepper and I also used cajun brats in this for alittle more spice.Thanks for the recipe.

So yummy!  I have made this several times.  I have made it with regular brats and spicy brats.  I also have made it with cabbage, spinach, chard and most recently bok choy.  It is always great.  Also, I add some chicken stock in place of the water.

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  Perfect for cold weather, but also good in warm.  Be sure to let the cabbage cook down and the soup thicken.  Great comfort food!

We really enjoyed this!  It was nice and creamy - great comfort food on a cold, winter night.  I didn't add all the milk so it was very thick, just the way we like it!

This recipe was good with a little tweeking. Was bland at first. Added some Liquid smoke and onion salt. Made it much better. Took it to a soup social with 15 other soups and this one was voted best!!

I LOVE this soup!  I actually made it for dinner for my boyfriends family!  What a hit!  Now they ask me to make it all the time.  I'm not a fan of Swiss cheese, so I use Cooper Sharp instead.  Cooper is a wonderful compliment to the bratwurst flavor. This soup is almost a stew.  Absolutely great!

It is delicious.   I used chicken broth instead of water.  I used what I think is a medium head of cabbage.   I wish recipes should say how many cups of cabbage. I think I used too much  cabbage.  I used Savory Leaves  spice from Penny’s. Four stars because I think you should  cook the potatoes with the cabbage.   Potatoes were over cooked.  Needed salt and. I put in some white pepper.  I browned some brats but added more that my husband had grilled and put slices of them in the soup.    Will make again.

Whole family liked it- my husband had three helpings! Growing up in Germany I learned to add caraway seed to any cabbage dish for better digestibility and taste, and so I did. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added the cabbage after 10 minutes cooking time of the potatoes. They  turned out soft without losing their shape. The sausage makes the dish- chose the kind you like best. I used brats.Yum!

Very good.  Used Johnsonville Original Brats, squeezed the meat out of the casings before browning.  Diced onion, potato, and cut up cabbage without really measuring - but assume close to amount written.  A bit more water, a bit less skim milk, and definitely more spices: added SlapYaMama (Cajun blend) and garlic salt.  Would probably put the shredded Swiss cheese in after dishing it into bowls next time.  Skipped the flour - it didn’t need thickening.  Thanks!  Will keep this in my ‘favorites’

A family favorite!  My husbands new #1 asked for dinner.  Wants me too double it for leftovers for work! Have never changed anything but cheeses, usually use swiss, gruyere, and little cheddar. Making tonight and am  going to put in some bacon that needs to be used up, I'm sure it will only make it even better!

Wonderful.  I did make one major substitution.  Cabbage makes me socially unacceptable.  For some reason, Brussels sprouts do not.  I used a whole package of fresh sprouts, quartered.  They went well with the brats and Swiss.  Thanks for the good recipe.  I will make this again.

We made it and it was good. I felt it was a little bland though. I guess the bratwurst I bought didn't have a lot of flavor. I may try and find a spicy version. And I may also take a previously posted tip and add some dark beer to give a little more flavor.

FANTASTIC recipe! Adding it to our favorite recipes list.
Used chicken bouillon, not plain water. Added crushed dried rosemary and black pepper to taste. Boiled potatoes and cabbage together, too. Only cooked bratwurst on the grill or fried before. My husband doesn't like cabbage, but this soup was a huge hit. Glad it doesn't have to simmer for hours to be flavorful--cooking time was rather short! Loved it.

This was a very good recipe. I loved how creamy it was! The only change that I made was I added another bratwurst because it didn't seem like enough to me.

Instead of water, I added beef broth to enhance the brats flavor. I also added a pinch of salt and pepper to bring out more flavor, and of course garlic.  Made more then enough and everything got inhaled. Only enough was left over for lunch tomorrow. Either way, this one is going in the book for later.

Wow!  This is good!  Followed recipe exactly except for adding red pepper flakes as so many seen to have done.  Will make again and use chicken broth in place of water to see if even better tasting. This is definitely a keeper!

This was really good. It reminded me of my Beer Brawts & Cabbage recipe. So, I combined this recipe, using Johnsonville Beer Brawts for the meat with a recipe for cheddar-beer soup. I removed the casings from the brawts & browned it with 1 onion, chopped & 6 cloves of garlic, minced (we really like garlic & this is a lot for most people, so you'll want to adjust that to taste). I used 6 red potatoes, unpeeled & cubed, 6 carrots, chopped, the cabbage & proceeded with my cheddar-beer soup. It was delicious! I have it 4 stars because I don't know what this soup actually tastes like, as written, but the soup I made, using this as a starting pointfor my soup, which was fabulous (or we thought so! ;-) ). I think this would have been delicious without the changes; the recipe just sparked an idea! Thanks for getting my creative culinary juices flowing! Yum!

I was worried about adding Swiss to soup so I tasted the broth beforehand and it was pretty boring.  Basic hot milk flavor.  Then I realized there was no salt, pepper, anything in the recipe.  So I added about 3 slices Swiss and some shredded parmesan, garlic salt, pepper.  I liked it a lot but hubby did not.  He said it just tasted like Swiss soup (lucky I didn't use the full amount!).  If you're worried about the Swiss, try a little at a time or use a different cheese.  It was very filling but like most soups not bad on calories.

Delicious. I used chicken stock instead of water, heavy cream as I was out of milk, corn starch instead of flour, added pepper and corn. Everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing!

I substituted the water with a Lager beer, and added a teaspoon of Caraway seed! I think the ONLY thing that could have made this any better was to add a bit of bacon to it! After all, you KNOW everything is better with bacon! My wife is also a VERY picky eater, and if I even put a PINCH of pepper on anything she will whine about it. But this she loved!

I modified this recipe a tiny bit. Used 1/4 Cup beef broth and broccoli instead of cabbage, already cooked Johnsonville cooked stadium bratwurst. If there were 6 stars I'd give it 6. We loved it and daydreamed about leftovers tonight when we get home!

Overall, this recipe was tasty and hardy. Slightly bland, and the cabbage was still on the crunchier side when I followed the times in the recipe. But my family enjoyed it.

I was looking for a new bratwurst recipe and I had all the ingredients this recipe called for so I gave it a shot.  I was a little hesitant b/c the ingredient combination seemed odd, but I read the reviews and went ahead.  I did not use a whole head of cabbage and used chicken stock instead of water.  My husband and I liked this, but my kids did not prefer it very much, though they are not picky eaters. It's a hearty soup and perfect with a nice crusty bread.

Pretty good, but nothing over the top.  It could have used something extra, but maybe using Italian sausage would give it that extra flavor kick.

This is a good base soup, but it  is bland,  you will need to had your own mix to spice it up  Enjoyed this soup with Best homemade Bread. Do cook the cabbage with the  potatoes together.  I did add 2 knorr chicken stock cubes, 2 chopped garlic, 2 tablespoons of Jamaican hot curry powder, 1/2 teaspoon of crushed pepper, salt and pepper to taste.

I made this soup with a few substitutions; homemade chicken broth in stead of water and I didn't have sausage so I used ham instead.  Swiss cheese and ham are good together, so it was no exception here.  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  One criticism I have is the potatoes cooked down to near nothing...the chunks should have been cut larger (at least 3/4 to 1 in. chunks).  My cabbage kept it's form, but I only cooked it 10 min. instead of the 20 min. suggested in the recipe.  I do think less cabbage would also be best as it seemed to be very dominant in this soup.  I'm not sure if I will make this one again as there are so many other soup recipes to try.

I halved this recipe, used 12 oz of Jones sausage instead of 8 oz of bratwurst, substituted vegetable stock for the water, and omitted the cheese when I tried this. It seemed a little too thick, so I added a can of evaporated milk, and it came out heavenly! This will be added to my list of absolute favorite soups, thanks for the great recipe!

I replaced a cup of the water with a can of Guinness. I also used frozen spinach instead of cabbage.  I don't like it when cabbage gets soft.  Lastly, I used cornstarch instead of flour. Warning: give the cornstarch a few minutes to work because if you keep adding more it will become really thick. For spices I added garlic salt, poultry seasoning, pepper, and grill seasoning(I add this to any potato cream soup). I made this for the Superbowl and everyone who tried it loved it.

Just made this for the second time this week by request.  I cut the cabbage a little larger this time and added a few more potatoes.  Forgot to grab swiss cheese tonight but gratted some colby jack.  I think you could use your favorite cheese for this.

This is a keeper!  I sauteed the onions first and added garlic.  The sausage I had on hand was mixed with mozzarella, so I didn't add the swiss.  I will try that next!

A very hearty meal. I used a turkey bratwurst and in doing so I needed to add a bit more spice. A little bit of pepper and Tony's really made this meal. My husband and I really enjoyed it.

I liked the taste of this recipe but it was a bit thick and I think I would use a different cheese next time.  It took longer than I thought to prepare.  Still, a great soup and worth trying.

This soup is really good.  I think next time I will add more potato though.  That was the only flaw.

This was good.  I had to add 3 more cups of water because it was so thick, and that was only using 1/2 the cabbage.  I added some garlic, salt and pepper per other's suggestions.  It was good.  The kids didn't dig it but my husband and I liked it.  We are vegetarian so I used Boca Bratwurst instead of sausage.

OMG is all I can say. This soup is out of this world. Did tweek it a little. Doubled the recipe so had to use more water to boil everything. Also used cumin,chili powder,minced garlic,crushed red pepper,2 chicken boulion cubes and 4oz each of sharp chedder and pepper jack cheese. Will serve this often!

I am very surprised people have liked this SO much. It was just ok to me. Def. needs some seasoning and is very chowder like. I made this to give me a break from my Cabbage soup diet...wonder if this is very healthy or not?

Husband thought was bland but would eat again. Child wanted more cheese in it. I agreed with another reviewer about cabbage boiled overlong with 20 minutes.

This was very tasty! My family is so diverse when it comes to eating things so it's nice to find something everyone liked. The only change I made is to replace the flour with cornstarch. I never, ever use flour to thicken as it leaves such a pasty taste in soup that most times I can't get past the taste and it ruins the soup. But other then that, no subs and it was just perfect!
