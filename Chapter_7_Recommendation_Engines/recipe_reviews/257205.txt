I skipped the pepper. I added the spinach just to half so people could have a choice. Came out perfect. Delicious.

This was awesome!  I used regular ground turkey and topped the casserole with fresh sliced jalapenos.  Yummy!!
Thanks for the recipe.

This was really delicious. We used regular crescent rolls and made two large pans, one with peppers and one without. They were both really yummy. Will definitely make this again.

This is the best recipe.  Great way to sneak vegetables in for picky children like mine.  They loved it.  Making it for the second time tonight.  Just doubled everything up, because they wanted more.  Ty for sharing.

This was oh so yummy! Loved the flavors. I thought it would need more eggs, but I was totally wrong. I will make this again and again! 5 stars no doubt!
