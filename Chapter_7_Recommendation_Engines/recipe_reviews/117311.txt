I wanted a casserole with salmon in it, and this fit the bill perfectly. I added 2 teaspoons of salt instead of one, and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder based on the other reviews claims that it needed more flavor. I made my own white sauce instead of purchasing the condensed soup because I've never enjoyed the canned condensed soups that are used in many casserole recipes. I used 3 1/2 cups of skimmed milk, and added a sprinkle of salt, garlic powder and pepper to ensure that I wasn't going to make the casserole bland with the addition of the milk. I heated the milk in a pan and sprinkled about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of the 'Shake and Blend' flour (Pillsbury makes it!). I heated the milk until it boiled and thickened. It was delicious! A casserole like this isn't gourmet (and isn't intended to be!) but it was very good comfort food and is a budget stretcher for sure. My whole family enjoyed it! thank you for the recipe!

Great comfort food!  I made three changes that I think only enhance the taste:  I added 2 cups of cooked broccoli, 1/2 cup cream cheese and I put in 1 lb of fresh salmon instead of canned.

This was a good start, but I had to add a lot of Mrs. Dash and more salt and pepper to suit our tastes.  I also added some mixed vegatables so it could be a rounded meal.  Family liked and requested it again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

this was a good basic recipe - but next time i'm going to definitely play with seasonings - i needed a lot of hot sauce to get through it all :)

We really liked this recipe!  I was concerned it would be too bland but it really wasn't.  I added one Philadelphia soft cream cheese container in chili sauce instead of one of the cans of condensed soup (its a mild chili sauce which I am sure added flavour but not too much spice).  Instead of peas we used frozen green beans and we had no pimentos so just left them out.  great family meal with plenty of leftovers!

Just blah.  Wasn't all that great.  Very little flavor (and I added garlic and extra salt as the comments suggested).  The potato chips seemed purposeless too.  Won't do again, but glad we tried something new!
