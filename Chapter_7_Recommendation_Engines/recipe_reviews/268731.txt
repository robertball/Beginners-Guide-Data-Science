These are excellent! I doubled the cilantro out of personal preference and I couldn't find the jalapeno cream cheese so I just used regular. There was plenty of jalapeno flavor still. These were a nice change from the every day mashed potatoes and this is one I'll make again.

Delicious twist on mashed potatoes, especially with our grilled T-Bone and grilled asparagus! For personal preference only, I seasoned with garlic salt to taste and added 1/4 teaspoon white pepper. My potatoes were a bit dry so I added an additional 4 heaping tablespoons of sour cream for creamier consistency. Thank you for the recipe!
