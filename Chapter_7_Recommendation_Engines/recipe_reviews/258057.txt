This recipe is simple and great! I am always looking for grill sides with ingredients I have on hand. I put mine in a foil pan and did not cover, so it didnâ€™t steam and make the bacon soggy. This also made it easy for my husband to stir it as he was grilling. I did not add any butter as the bacon produces enough grease.

I chose to make these in the oven as the recipe submitter suggested and it did not work. After being in the oven for 30 minutes, the potatoes were done, the bacon was no where near cooked and they were floating in a pool of bacon grease and butter. I finished cooking the bacon in a pan and crisped up the potatoes with some onions and seasonings in the bacon grease. I then placed on a paper towel to soak up the grease and served them topped with bacon and green onions. The end results were very good but we would not have been able to eat them as written in the recipe.
