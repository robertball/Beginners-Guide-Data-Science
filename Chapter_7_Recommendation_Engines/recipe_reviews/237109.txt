I cooked this for dinner tonight.  I changed the recipe to my liking and it turned out wonderful!  I do not like imitation crabmeat at all.. does not taste anything like blue crab! It is a bit more expensive, but I used real blue crab meat (claw meat). I used the oven ready noodles and had no problems.  I also mixed two small cans of cream of mushroom soup into the Alfredo sauce to add more mushroom flavor. I did not use cottage cheese since my husband is not a fan of that. I also used mozzarella cheese on each layer on top of the ricotta cheese. He loves it ! This recipe is excellent on a cold night and for anyone who enjoys eating blue crab !!

I made this tonight and it was really good. I didn't precook the noodles but i did buy oven ready noodles. I dont know if that made a difference but they came out perfectly. I added 1 8oz jar of lump crab meat. Also, i cooked mine for 2 hrs and 15 minutes, well because i misread the cooking time. It still came out great. I put everything together at the same time. I didn't wait to add the cheese and it still was good. I waited for 45 minutes for it to cool instead of 30 minutes, then i ate it. It was really, really good. I seasoned the crab meat prior to cooking and i chopped the mushrooms up into small pieces to make sure they cooked, like someone suggested.

I tried this recipe subbing Johnsonville mild Italian sausage, cooked and drained. I followed the recipe, but used a 5oz container of spinach. This really requires a larger style crock pot. I used a crock pot liner in my medium crock pot and had to move the liner to the larger one. Another issue was I felt it really needed extra sauce. Also, upon reading the reviews I was unsure about the noodles, to use dry, pre-cook, or use oven ready ones. I chose the oven ready type and found the texture chewy all the way through. I would use regular boiled noodles. I was not sure how to fix the noodle issue. 2 pieces were eaten and the rest could not be salvaged. This recipe may work if the right noodles are used.

Just made it today for the family. My husband and I loved it. I had to adjust the amount of some ingredients though. I used only 8 oz of lasagna noodles but 16 oz of crabmeat. Also, next time I'd chop mushrooms smaller, sliced mushrooms didn't have time to finish cooking. I don't mind mushrooms crunchy or chewy but for guests I would cut them up smaller. Overall, it was very tasty and light.

I made this for dinner tonight and it's amazing. I stuck pretty close to the recipe, with a couple changes. I wasn't sure if I was to cook the noodles or not as it wasn't stated, so I cooked them just enough to be pliable. I used sliced baby Bella's (8 oz package) and then diced the slices per a previous review suggestion. I also used a full container of ricotta and a full container of cottage cheese, mixed them together and spread them that way. I sprinkled some garlic powder and salt as I was worried it may be a little bland....it was AWESOME!!! Very very good and definitely will make this again. Note that it s hard to get out of the crockpot, as it becomes juicy, but definitely worth it.

Excellent recipe!  I did not precook the noodles and they came out perfectly.  I also added cocktail shrimp and garlic salt for a little more flavor.  Small scallops would be a nice addition too.  Or stick to the original recipe, it's a good one!

I always like to read through reviews before making a recipe so based on other reviews. I bought oven ready noodles, chopped the mushrooms smaller and added onion garlic based on my families preference. There was prep involved, I mixed my ricotta and cottage cheese together and layered it with ease and added cheese into the layers. I did wait to add the cheese til the end and I am glad I did the cheese browned which was surprising. Will make again the family enjoyed it. Maybe an addition of red pepper flakes next time!

I made as the recipe instructed, using dry uncooked noodles straight from the box. The only alteration I made was to add a small amount of water to the top of each noodle layer. Cooked up well with a very nice texture to the pasta.

I was really impressed by the end result and ease of putting this together.  All that was used was a cutting board and my crockpot.  The lasagna noodles cooked through however the bottom layer was a little tough.  The overall flavor was really good. My husband and son liked it and said it would be over the top if I add a few minced cloves of garlic next time around. I'll definitely be making this again.  Thank you for sharing.

Luckily I chose a dish too small to hold the leftovers. This gave me and my hubby the opportunity to eat the extra right out of the crockpot. This dish was not only easy to make, it was fabulous. My taste buds are still smilin! Thanks for sharing.

This is the best lasagna I have ever had!!!! My husband and I love surimi, the fake crab. I did make one change, because basic Alfredo sauce is a little boring for me. I used one jar of Alfredo sauce and stirred in 1/2 jar of pesto sauce. It was perfect! I will definitely be trying this with shrimp next.

Can someone tell me if they've ever used Marinara instead of Alfredo sauce? I dislike Alfredo sauce but this recipe looks so good.

Turned out great, will definitely make this again. Made some adjustments after reading the many suggestions-thanks. I mixed the ricotta, mozzarella, cottage cheese, and one can of cream of mushroom soup with garlic. I added the small shrimp, and poured a little water in the Alfredo container, shook it and poured it over the top layer of noodles to avoid that dryness some spoke of. Came out perfect, even my picky eater son raved. I also misread the cooking time like another and only cooked for the 2 hours and 15 minutes. I’ll cook it for the extra 30 minutes next time but it was great and time was saved with not chopping the mushrooms, or dealing with them not cooking all the way. Others mentioned adding some salt next time, the sodium in the soup more than took care of that issue. Also definitely don’t forget to add that layer of sauce at the bottom before the first layer of noodles. I used oven ready and they all were great. I think the key is letting it cool prior to eating, because we had to run an errand right after it cooked and we came back maybe 40 minutes later and warmed up our plates and had a terrific dinner.

Great recipe!! It was a hit with my 13 year-old daughter.  I did substitute Alfredo sauce with Marinara to be on the lighter, less fat gram side.  For the most part I stuck to the recipe (minus onions;  we don't like onions). Used imitation crab meat. Very good! Thanks for sharing!

I made this along with a traditional lasagna for a dinner party yesterday. The only changes I made was to mix sun dried tomato Alfredo sauce with regular Alfredo sauce to help with the color problem noted by other reviewers. I added a few tablespoons of Old Bay and some salad size shrimp. Everyone raved. Some people went home with the recipe and some called the next day!  Very much a hit and so easy to make!

So, my husband and I both don't like seafood, so I just omitted the crab from this recipe and it turned out AMAZING. My mother-in-law is known for her amazing spinach lasagna and my husband said this one was even better! I might try it with the oven ready noodles next time, since boiling the noodles before putting them in the crock pot added a bunch of extra prep time I hadn't accounted for.

This was wonderful!  I did make a change in how the alfredo sauce was layered.  I divided the sauce into thirds.  I spread one third of the sauce on the bottom of the crockpot, I layered one third with the remainder of the ingredients, and I added 1 cup of water to the remainding third of sauce in the jar. I poured this over the top layer of noodles to keep them moist.  I could have used chicken stock for more flavor if I had some.  This was WONDERFUL!  I definitley will put this recipe into my     "go-to" file!

I made it exactly as written except used real crab.  A few notes - my top noodles were drying out way before the time stated, at about 1:45 hrs so I sprinkled the cheese on early to try to keep them from being hard.  Needed more sauce on top for sure.  Would be better with more sauce inside - cottage cheese/riccotta mixture was a little dry/crumbly. I would salt the layers lightly as well, had good taste but was subtle other than the crab flavor.
