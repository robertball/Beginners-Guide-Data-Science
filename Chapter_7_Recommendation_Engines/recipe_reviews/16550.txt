This is a wonderful recipe, and it's now my favorite recipe for meatloaf. The only thing that I added was using the glaze that was called for in Delia Martinez' Glazed Meatloaf.

For those who thought the meatloaf was bland, you HAVE to try the Glazed Meatloaf glaze on this meatloaf and you will swear it's awesome! I've shared this recipe with others as well as Delia Martinez' glaze and they've all thrown out their old meatloaf recipes and swear this is the best meatloaf EVER! Just do a search on Glazed Meatloaf on Allrecipes to get her glaze and try this meatloaf with her glaze and see if you don't agree it's AWESOME!

I took the meatloaf out 10 minutes early, drained off the fat, then put the glaze on and popped back in the oven for the final 10 minutes. I've always loved meatloaf, but this combination was the best! I had a hard time finding grated Romano cheese, so I used grated Parmesan instead. Thank you Mr. Gerry for sharing this fabulous recipe!

This is a great recipe.  But instead of using the bread, I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I also added garlic, oregano, and italian seasoning to the mixture.  Cooked them like the recipe said, then added them to my spaghetti sauce in a crockpot on low for a couple of hours.  It turned out great!  Will use again and again!

I made the meatballs .They were good. Next time though I would probably add some garlic and italian seasoning. I also baked them in the oven instead of frying them. My husband loved them. I will definetly try the burgers and meatloaf in the future.

The meatballs were excellent!  I have always had bad luck in the past because I never liked the texture or taste of all those breadcrumbs, but soaking bread in milk then mixing it in fixed all that!  I didn't use the Romano cheese because I'm on a budget, I just used Parmesan and it was still great!  I also added a packet of the dry Ranch seasoning! (stolen from the BBQ cola meatball recipe!)  excellent!

Sensational! I used half ground beef, half ground turkey and worcestershire sauce instead of steak (same difference really - just what I had on hand).  Also I toasted the bread then processed it lightly for breadcrumbs and added a bit of milk to make up the liquids difference.  These were SO GOOD, I was eating them out of the pan, barely managed to get a few dozen (small ones) put up in the freezer.  These don't even need sauce but I'm sure they'll be fabulous simmered in a nice marinara, alhtough I've been dreaming about them in brown sauce over mashed potatoes....

I made this recipe exactly as was written except I did not use the optional onions. I found that the meatballs had just the right amount of spices. Medium spice flavor. I would deffinetly make them again.

Excellent Meatloaf!  *NOTE: Add 30-40 minutes to cooking time if you are using a drip-rack or broiling pan (to cut down on fat content).

When adding the eggs stop after 2 & then decide if the third one is really necessary.  I soaked my bread in a little warm milk.  Squeezed it dry.  Also added Italian seasoning & garlic.  I followed the recipe [3 eggs]  & it was way to moist for me.  Put in some bread crumbs, still too moist.  I  had 1 lb of Italian sausage in fridge so I added that too.  This made 12 med. meat balls & 1 small meatloaf. Delish!!  so now when I want to make this italian style I use 2 lbs beef & 1 lb Itl sausage, other wise I use 3 lbs of beef.  It's like making 2 meals. 1 for now & 1 for the freezer for later.

I wanted to like this recipe for meatballs but felt they were dry.  I followed the recipe except for subbing a small amount of sausage in place of the ground beef plus added a dash of italian seasonings and 1 clove of crushed garlic.  I also browned mine slightly in a olive oil then cooked in sauce.  Mine did NOT cook in 15 - 20 minutes in sauce, more like 1 1/4 hours on low heat as not to burn the sauce or meat.  I will try this mixture for burgers next.

NOT great... they don't hold together well at all-- I tried both frying and in the oven and even added cracker crumbs to get them to stick... nothing special tasting either-- oh well... I'd keep looking for another recipe-- I used it for meatballs but I wouldn't use it again for either of the three! :(

I just ran my bread (unsoaked) through the blender on the ice crushing cycle. I used a bigger-sliced whole wheat bread so I didn't need four slices, I used just three. Because I was using this to go into spaghetti sauce, I used three tablespoons of the homemade sauce instead of ketchup but I kept the steak sauce the same. I did run my onion through my mini-processor so I wouldn't have big chunks of onion in my meatballs and I threw in a teaspoon or so of homemade italian seasoning at the last to add extra flavor. I was worried that the meatballs might be a little too wet as they seemed to be as I formed them into balls but they cooked up nicely. I'm really glad I decided not to soak my bread as I think the meatballs really would have been too wet had I done so. I baked mine in the oven so I could just pour the grease off before adding them to my sauce--350 degrees for a half hour was perfect. Tasty meatballs! I liked the addition of the steak sauce. I worried that it wouldn't mesh well with the spaghetti sauce but it was tasty. I'll definitely try this recipe again when I make Barbeque Meatballs another time.

Great flavor, but never again will I fry meatballs!  That took much longer than 5 minutes and they always fall apart.  Next time, I will bake them at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes until browned.  Much easier!

Loved it except I use 1 Cup of instant oatmeal instead of the bread. Much healthier for you and makes them a little bit lighter.

It is a good recipe, but my meatballs, meatloaf, and burgers taste nothing alike - on purpose. I love the steak sauce idea for the burgers, but I'd lose the bread. Similarly, I'd lose the steak sauce and ketchup from my meatballs and add some tomato paste and Italian spices. Meatloaf is one of my favorites to make, sometimes w/ ketchup, or steak sauce, bbq, etc. - and I use just one egg per pound of meat. As it is, it's a fabulous meatloaf - but life's too short to shape the same prepared chunk of meat in 3 different shapes and call it 3 different names.

Good and moist. I did soak my bread in skim milk instead of water.  Made 16 nice meatballs. Nice flavor with a little sweetness from the ketchup. Family enjoyed.  Thanks!

Similar to my firehouse meat balls. Try using the meatloaf mix for this recipe. (beef,veal,pork) use 1 egg and 1 slice of bread per pound of meat. Soak the bread with milk rather than water. Add bread crumbs as needed to dry the meat mix slightly so that it does not stick to your hands. I usually use about 3 pounds of meat and the guys devour them!

YUMMY! I have cooked for years, but decent meatloaf has always escaped me! Mine always fall apart, or are dry or just generally a reason to eat out!

I made these today, and did meatballs, with the intention of meatball sub sandwiches. I read through the other reviews, and toasted the bread first, then broke it into little pieces, and used milk to soak it instead of water.  I also added some Frank's hot sauce, cuz my whole family likes a little of it in recipes. 

I decided to try something a little different (for me, anyway). I pan-fried the meatballs first, to make sure they had a nice brown coating on them. I also rolled them in cracker crumbs before frying for extra hold-togetherness, but they really didn't need it. After a quick pan-fry (not to complete done-ness, but just to brown them up), I put them in a crock pot where I had already put 2 sliced onions in the bottom. I put the meatballs in there, and added about 2 cups of liquid - I used hot water and dissolved two beef boullion cubes, then added some more steak sauce and black pepper to it, then poured the liquid over the meatballs and onions. 

After about an hour, I turned everything over carefully (the meatballs will break apart some if you are too rough) to make sure nothing got dried out. By dinner time, the onions were so nicely browned, and everything smelled heavenly! Had hubby pick up fresh hoagie buns on the way home from work, and we had these meatball hoagies with pasta salad. Oh my goodness!  It was GRE

My family loved this meal, my mom helped me a little. I added a teaspoon of onion powder and garlic powder. I used mom's leftover gravy from the pot roast from Monday over the patties. I got 5 patties from a half recipe. I will make this recipe again tomorrow because my family liked it too much!

I like to follow the recipe exactly the first time and then make changes if need be.  I agree that this was to mushy and fell apart.  It was a little dull in the taste department also.  Sorry I will not be using this again.  I have better recipes from other places.

This is a great basic recipe, however, I always add some italian seasoning, italian style bread crumbs, egg and my secret to moist, very flavorful meatballs is sour cream.  The family loves it, and has been requested at family gatherings over and over!

This did not work well for burgers on the grill. It was too mushy and the meat just fell through the grate. I also wasn't that pleased with the taste. All of the ingredients sound like they would make a tasty burger, but it just didn't work for me.

I have already used this recipe several times.  My kids love meatballs with their spaghetti and this one works perfect.  I scale the recipe to use 3# of hamburger, and it makes about 75 small meatballs.  I bake them in the oven, use what I want for that meal and freeze the rest.  (I freeze them on a cookie sheet first then pop them into a ziploc bag)  For birthdays, I make BIG meatballs and the kids get a kick out of getting one large meatball!  GREAT recipe!  THANK YOU!

These were awsome. I did add a little garlic and onion powder. Also a teaspoon of Italian seasoning. I used the milk to soak the bread as another reader suggested. They were great. Thanks for a good recipe. I baked them in the oven 350 for about 45 min. PERFECT

Some of the best meatloaf I've ever had! My husband actually made it and added some basil and oregano to the mixture, in addition to a bit of minced garlic.

I made this mixture for meatballs the day before and what an easy dinner.  A jar of good marinara and boiled some noodles--delicious!  Everyone in the family loved them from 2 to 32!  I think maybe making them the night before and refrigerating them actually helped them to stay together.  I didn't use the soaked white bread, I just made whole wheat bread crumbs and threw those in.  Quick, easy, and delicious.

AS A MEATBALL RECIPE:
Not good.  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  A couple fell apart when frying, the rest required much effort to keep them from doing the same.  Regardless, I went ahead with the recipe and poured in my pasta sauce and let it simmer.  More fell apart and the rest are still delicate little things.   I tried a piece of meat from one that had fallen apart and it's mushy...yuk.  A previous reviewer suggests baking them and I'm willing to give this recipe another shot that way.  Otherwise, maybe it's better for meatloaf.  Can't imagine a burger frying up any better than the meatballs did.

Great basic recipe for meatloaf or meatballs, but for the best burgers I prefer 80/20 ground beef only seaso salt and fresh cracked pepper -just on the  outside- immediately prior to placing on the grill.

great for meatloaf  super for burgers in a sauce ,because of the steak sauce and ketchup  they conflict with the spaghetti sauce though  ALSO use the bread ( we always use our day old ) it IS critical in the texture and moisture level of the meatball/meatloaf

I made this and wound up with about 40 to 50 meatballs.  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the soaked bread, parmesan cheese instead of Romano, fresh diced onion and a few cloves of crushed garlic.  The breadcumbs were just a little overpowering.  I browned the meatballs in a skillet, then baked them at 400 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes.

Made this mixture into meatballs and I thought they were very moist and pretty good! I simmered mine on low in sauce for flavours to blend together for about an hour instead of the rec. time of 15-20 min. Great base recipe. THX.

I have made this recipe time and time again over the past year or so; only now deciding to review it.

I have only used it to make spaghetti meatballs combined with "Brian's Favorite Sauce", also on AllRecipes. I have worked out a simple preparation and can whip these meatballs up in short time. They are perfectly tasty meatballs.

My changes: I use dried bread crumbs instead of soaked bread. I don't add onion, since it is in my sauce. Often I use canned parmesan cheese instead of romano. I don't measure out any of the ingedients; I just eyeball it and it turns out fine.

This is a good, simple, flexible meatball recipe recipe.

I used half ground pork and half ground beef and made meatballs. I also used french bread that I processed and didn't add any water. Not at all wet and they held together well. I think something is missing though, which is why it's only 4 stars. Next time I'm going to add garlic and some italian spices and see if that helps. Thanks, Peter!

I went wrong somewhere - I think it was the bread-I used a soft bread and adding the water and squeezing it out turned it into more of a dough. The mixture was way to moist, but, we still were able to fry as meatballs. Needs a little more flavor - so, when I retry it, I will try adding seasoning salt instead of regular salt. Also, I think the addition of some garlic is a good suggestion.

Yummy!!! I made meatballs for subs. I only used 2 eggs because that seemed like enough and I am glad I did. I didn't have steak sauce so I used worchestshire instead.  I baked them at 350 for 25 minutes then added to the home made sauce I made. Will make again!!

Thank you for this recipe!  My family loved this and said this was the best spagetti AND meatballs ever.  I did however use leftover bakery bread and it came out sticky and raw-like when I added the water...it would not separate when I squeezed in between fingers so I threw that away.  I ended up using plain bread crumbs.  It came out with great reviews so  I'll be using this recipe from now on.  Thanks again!

I added one egg to many, but it didn't matter much. These were pretty good. I made hamburgers with them. I can't really think of a time when it would be useful to have such a mixture, but it was good either way. If I only have the basics on hand, I'll make this again. But I'm not going out of my way.

This isn't the best recipe.  The ingredients took away the taste of the hamburger.  Also I didn't like the consistency of the hamburger patty.  It was too soft for my family’s liking.

I used part of the ketchup and steak sauce for the meatballs.  They turned out very moist and flavorful.  For the meatloaf, I'd suggest adding a  lot more ketchup, particularly on top for the baking.

I made meatballs.  I followed the directions except I soaked bread in milk instead of water and used green onions instead of white.  I will keep this recipe but definitely add seasonings for more flavor (garlic and onion powder, etc.)

I was sure I'd love this recipe, but I didn't.  The steak sauce was overpowering, as was the Romano cheese.  I made it for meatballs, but I'm sure it would be better as a meatloaf.  The frying first did NOT work for me either.  Seemed like a taste my kids should like, but they turned their noses up at it too.  Another frustrating suppertime.  :-(

This is my "go to" meatball recipe.  I add some dried basil & oregano for more favor.  And I bake the meatballs for 15 minutes before I add them to the sauce.  My family loves them.

This is exactly what I've been looking for!  Excellent texture and flavor.  I was a little nervous with the wet-bread thing, but it was perfect.  I did add a few shakes of onion salt because we're not big on onions and it was great.  I made meatballs but will definitely adopt this as my long-searched-for meatloaf recipe as well.  Really, really good is all I have to say!

Really good basic recipe.  The milk soaked bread really makes a difference vs. bread crumbs in most recipes.  I did tweek it a bit.  I replaced 1/2 the minced onion w/ minced garlic.  I also added 1 tsp. Italian Seasoning as well as 1/2 cup of Italian Bread crumbs based on another review.  Next time I will use 1/2 the steak sauce and double the ketchup as the steak sauce seemed a bit over powering.  I also used a ground beef/veal/pork mixture (sometimes sold as a meatloaf mix).  I did not cook these in a sauce, but on a rack over a cookie sheet to catch the grease.  They cooked perfectly for 50 minutes at 350 degrees.  This is a keeper!!

I made the meat loaf but used ground turkey instead of ground beef and it was delicious.  My 24 year old son said "Mom this was really good".

Not real fond of this recipe. Rather disappointing. The mixture was rather mushy and the meatballs did not hold their shape. Wouldn't recommend, especially if you're looking for meatballs to to into your spaghetti sauce.

It was nice to find a recipe that didn't begin with "saute onions until translucent". I used seasoned Italian breadcrumbs instead of bread - as I didn't have bread on hand. These were great meatballs! My family went crazy about them. I will absolutely make them again, and often!

This recipe is so good!  And I disagree with one of the reviews, these burgers can be grilled on the bbq, it worked well.  Of course you have to be a little careful to prevent them from breaking, but that goes for most homemade burgers.  We're grilling them again for dinner tonight!

GREAT RECIPE! I have tried the hamburgers and the meatballs. My husband and I LOVE these meatballs. They fall apart very easily but if you are careful, they stay together. Regardless, if they fall apart, they are still wonderful. My husband asks for these all the time. Easy to make and very tastey! Thanks for the recipe, Peter!

I made this recipe for hamburgers and my family loved it.  I even made a small meatloaf out of the leftover mixture with steak sauce in it and that was a big hit.  My husband tried to make the meatballs with less success.  They didn't hold together very well and we ended up with meat sauce instead of meatballs on our spaghetti, however, it was still undeniably tasty.

This is great with homemade spaghetti sauce!  We used the leftovers for mini meatball sandwiches (put them on fresh baked dinner rolls and add parmesan cheese).  Yum!

I did use fresh sliced bread but skipped the part about soaking them.  I just processed them in my Cuisinart until they were all crumbled.  This is by far the best recipe I've ever used for meatballs!

I used half pork and half beef and the meatballs turned out great as they were nice and moist!  I did have to add more soaked bread to the mixture and I also baked them at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes after I had pan friend them.  They were liked by all at the Christmas Eve dinner with a brown beef gravy and mashed potatoes!

I think this is an excellent way to take advantage of hamburger when it's on sale! The freezing part is what I LOVE! My husband and 4 children all love any type of meatloaf, meatballs, or hamburgers. With this recipe you can add more seasonings to the likings, and the possibilities are endless! A 5 star in our house!

We had a spur of the moment get-together a couple days after Christmas (6 kids and mates plus 9 grandchildren)Recipes.com to the rescue.  Everybody raved over these meatballs. Even my son-in-law who is a chef by trade. Made extra and froze a meatloaf for later.  
Hats off and thanks to Mr Gerry.

Like others, I used Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce as well as seasoned bread crumbs, not bread. Turned out excellent! I put these on a baking rack on a jelly roll pan. Baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Finally have a meatball recipe that everyone in the family loves!

My husband said, "This is the best spaghetti I've had in my whole life!"  That's a lot coming from him, because spaghetti is his favorite food!  I was so happy!  I used Italian Bread Crumbs (1 cup) instead of the soaked bread, and added a little bit on Garlic Powder.  I used Minced Onion Seasoning instead of actually chopping up an onion as well, and these turned out delectable.  AWESOME meat balls!  Just added our favorite spaghetti sauce on top, and voila!

For meatball this recipe is amazing.  I usually half the recipe because it make more meatballs then I need.

For meatloaf this recipe isn't so good.  I tried making it twice and both times my meatloaf shrank and dry.  I have any tried making meatloaf these two times so maybe I'm doing something wrong...

I substituted Worchestershire sauce for the steak sauce in the meatloaf, and 4 tbl was too much. I also used about 3 cups of bread crumbs rather than four slices of bread, but I would, in future, use less, as the meatloaf was a little dry. Otherwise, it was really good though!

I was very impressed at how well these meatballs stayed together.  I always have bad luck with meatballs falling apart, and these didn't.  On the other hand, I was hoping they would be exceptionally delicious, and they weren't.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but just average.

We were extremely disappointed in this recipe after reading all the great reviews it got.  I used it for meatloaf the center was completely mushy and the top was overcooked.  I followed the directions exactly, but I wonder if I didn't do something wrong.  I don't know, but this will never be made in this house again.

Yummy, easy recipe.  Made burgers this evening with 1.3 lbs ground turkey, following this recipe.  I made only a few changes, using 1/3 cup bread crumbs instead of white bread and substituting parmesan for the Romano cheese.  My boyfriend was skeptical about the steak sauce (he's not a fan) but the taste isn't strong - just enough to make the burger interesting.  I also added some garlic powder.  Sauteeing worked well - the burgers stuck together without any problems.  Delicious - thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good.  I will broil next time instead of pan fry (quicker and less involved for me).  I added fresh basil to be different.  Also, I didn't have any romano so I used parmesan.

Very good, although I would make sure to use extra lean ground beef. I didn't cook the meatballs in the sauce as I didn't want a sauce to rich. Baking them gets rid of most of the grease, and they are still very moist! Next time, I will probably try adding a little bit of BBQ sauce or steak sauce to the mixture to spice it up a little.

A little bland, but nothing you can't fix. Next time I'll use more seasoning and some garlic. Also, used ground turkey, less fattening!

I have made this both as meatloaf and meatballs.  Really easy and yummy.  I did not have bread this time, so I used bread crumbs instead -- did not notice a difference.  We can't wait to try it as burgers next!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made the meatloaf - followed the directions exactly and it was good but not great.  My husband said it was a little bland - maybe I'll throw in onion soup mix next time.  My oldest son said it was ok and my youngest son spit it out after the first bite.  I thought it was pretty good and really easy to make, but it was a little bland.

My family loved these meatballs.  I served them with a homemade spaghetti sauce.  I used the leftovers to make meatball subs the next day.  I'm not a big fan of romano cheese, so next time I'll make these meatballs with parmesan cheese instead.  Otherwise this recipe is terrific!  Thanks for sharing.

I like to keep up a batch of pre-cooked meatballs in the freezer.  A few meatballs taken out when you start cooking dinner, can easily be rewarmed in the microwave and given to your young child who doesn't like to eat other cuts of beef.  This recipe is great because it is seasoned in such a way to be very flexible:  add to spaghetti sauce, stroganoff type sauce, cheese sauce, etc. or can be eaten plain.  My daughter likes them dipped into Chinese sweet & sour sauce.  I used the standard parmesean cheese out of a can, and added a little onion powder since I was out of onions. I also baked them at 400 degrees on a rack on my cookie sheet to decrease the fat/grease.  They turned out great.  Thanks Peter.

My husband and I tried this receipe the night he didn't want to cook and it was easy, we used it for hamburgers.  We made a few adjustments and the burgers were the best we had ever had. We added Shaka marinade sauce to the bread pieces and worsteshire sauce to the meat as well.  This kept the burgers nice and juicy as well as tasty. Grilling them on our George Forman Grill helped eliminate the grasy fat and it was perfect serving for two.

I made the meatballs for a big family dinner and everyone raved over them.  I had to print the recipe out for everybody.  This was the 1st time I ever made meatballs, I couldn't get over how easy they were to make.  I'll never buy premade again!  Since I made so many I didn't fry them I baked them in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes on each side which worked out great.  Thanks for this great recipe!!!

Great recipe.  I made meatballs, so I added fresh onion and garlic as well as oregano.  After browning, I dropped them in Nanny's Spaghetti Sauce (also from this site and fantastic!) and let them finish cooking in the sauce.  Terrific!  Thanks.

I made up the meatball version and froze them for taking on vacation.  All I had to do was thaw and simmer in a jar of spaghetti sauce for great meatball sandwiches.

Made meatballs with Italian bread crumbs in lieu of bread. Added minced garlic. Oven cooked and added meatballs to Aldi's Meat Sauce. dinner was delayed 2 hours and the meatballs 1/2 fell apart. My family thought the sauce was superb! I didn't necessarily care for it. This is the family recipe now. I just don't kill  meatballs in the sauce.

Loved the recipe.  Used 1 C. Italian-Style Bread Crumbs due to time constraints.  Topped the meatloaf w/Delia Martinez' Meatloaf Glaze (Glazed Meatloaf I recipe) which is absolutely scrumptious.  Yum!

I LOVE this recipe. The very first time I made it I didn't read the instructions very carefully and just added everything into the bowl, then realized you leave some out depending on what your making. The result was DELICIOUS. They were so good!! I use this recipe all.the.time. With all that mixed together it is a soft mixture and somewhat tricky to cook in a pan but SO worth it!

i had doubts about the steak sauce, but since my husband loves steak sauce, i thought i'd give it a try. i also used bread crumbs instead of soaked slices of bread. i made this for meatballs, and simmered them in marinara. they didn't fall apart, but they were awfully mushy.  i won't make this again.

These were a hit.  My children at them up. They suggested to make them for the holiday with barbecue sauce or as meatball sandwiches.

I was really looking forward to these burgers.  The problem is that this recipe as burgers CANNOT be grilled, which is something I think the person who submitted this recipe should have noted (as most people do not pan fry burgers).  I basically ended up with a pile of meat because all of my burgers fell apart and ended up in the grill.  I was very disappointed.

This tastes really good and we loved it for meatballs.  However, I tried using it for hamburgers on the grill and they kind of stuck to the grill and fell apart.  They still tasted wonderful when I scooped up the pieces and put them together on a bun.  The leftover scraps were used in spaghetti sauce, which tasted great!

What a great easy recipe!  The flavor that the meat adds to the sauce is just tremendous.  The kids, who normally pass on the meatballs, swallowed them up!! THANKS

I thought it was quite good and I had everything in the house already.  The kids loved it!  My only concern would be the nutritional aspect.  31g of fat is more than an adult needs in a whole day.  I substituted with some ground turkey, which helped.

I made the meatballs and they were great!  Everyone loved them even my picky eaters.  I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and italian seasoning and added them to spaghetti sauce.  I used the slow cooker spaghetti sauce recipe from this site.  Great combination!

I like this recipe because it is a 3 in one... I was looking for a recipe that I already had all the ingredients for and could make quickly and easily... I'll definately keep this for future use!!!
