I love Saganaki...the whole family does.  But after trying this recipe for the first time, I have a couple of tips.  First of all....pretend you are Chef John making a video, and HAVE ALL YOUR INGREDIENTS PROPORTIONED AND READY!  Things happen fast, and you NEED to be ready.  My first attempt, I made the mistake of having skillet TOO HOT, and burnt the cheese and smoked up the kitchen.  You want the skillet to just start smoking, not heavily smoking and olive oil evaporating.  Suggest you make a batch for yourself to practice first before trying to impress your special someone.

I’ve made this before from another recipe and the one thing that was different was to “marinate” the cheese in brandy for an hour before cooking. Either way, this is AMAZING!! Especially with some home made pita! Definitely have everything ready before you start and be careful lighting it. I once singed the hair on my arm making this. LOL! Opa!!!!!

This was just plain fun to make. Had everything ready to go before I started and was glad I did. My honey told me I was going to catch the place on fire. Well when  it was lit on fire my smoke detector that’s right above where it was done went off lol. My honey devoured almost all of this. Thanks for
The fun recipe.

Cut the cheese in 2, first one it didn't light on fire (my fault), second time it did. Preferred the first one! Maybe the flames add visual interest but not better taste?

Super easy and tasty. Used cilantro vs parsley. Will become a staple.

It turned out pretty good.  I did not have the lemon to extinguish the fire, nor the fresh parsley.
