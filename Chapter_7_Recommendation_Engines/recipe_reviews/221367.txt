This is a great base soup! I used the ingredient search to find it and as I live in Germany it seems quite appropriate!  I used approx. the same amount of vegetables but added in a chopped up leek.  After simmering for an hour I added the parsley and blended it smooth.  I used 2 cups of 3.5% milk, not 1/2 & 1/2, only 1 tsp. of salt and added a pinch of crushed red pepper.  I added in small meatballs for protein and garnished with green onions - delicious!

This turned out really good! I recently moved to Germany and these are all ingredients I could find here. I used a bundle of suppengruen (a leek, 2 carrots, a slice of celeriac and some parsley) plus a half an onion for the veggies. I actually forgot to add the half and half and it was still excellent. I used bockwurst and added it with the potatoes to brown it up a little. That meant that when I used the stick blender it blended up the sausage too, but that was just fine. Served it with yummy German bread.
