Very good and super easy.  This is a great recipe to make ahead of time and you just pop it in the oven.  I used leftover shredded chicken from a rotisserie chicken we had the day before.  I also added one can of condensed cheddar cheese soup in with  3 cans of enchilada sauce.  I dip the tortillas in the enchilada sauce first and then fill and roll up.  It makes it easier to roll the corn tortillas, since they tend to crack if you don't do that.  I also added one can of black beans to the chicken mixture.  It stretched the chicken and made more enchiladas.  Next time I will also add a can of corn (drained).  We have a big family so stretching our dollar is very important.  I topped with  the remainin enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese and baked.  When they came out of the oven we served with sour cream and hot sauce.  You can also garnish with olives and green onion.  This is a go to recipe when I need to either make a quick meal or I need to make meals ahead of time in the event we're having a busy week.

This was restaurant quality.  I used the exact ingredients, but did not put any cheese in the mixture and I put 3/4 of the enchilada sauce in the mixture.  I used the remaining 1/4 can of enchilada sauce to pour over the enchiladas along with the sprinkling of cheese.

My hubby raved about these ALL evening! I followed other readers' advice and added cheese to the top of the enchiladas before baking them. SUPERB!

So simple.  I threw my chicken in the food processer rather then shread it up.   I did add taco seasoning to the chicken/onion/garlic as I warmed it.  Then added the chilies, enchilada sauce and cheese.  I wanted to put refries in the enchiladas but didn't have any, next time.  After I had all the enchiladas wrapped up I poured more sauce over the top(I used a whole 19 oz can) and lots of cheese on top.  I would also typically throw on gr onions and bl olives, but I was making this for others that don't care for those ingrediants.  Repeat recipe.

I made this tonight...it was really good but next time I will add a half jar of chili powder to the chicken to give it more of a kick.  It was a little flat for my taste.

Really easy recipe, I used flour tortillas and added extra green/red pepper and it was just great. Can't imagine a better enchilada.

This was wonderful, my whole family loved it.  We made it as is the first time, the second time we cut back on the onions just to tweak to our taste, having a good enchilada sauce is the key.

I was nervous about these until I actually tasted them. I followed the recipe almost exactly, and they were great! I did add a generous handful of cheese on top. The second time I made them, I added some extra enchilada sauce on top, but I don't think I'll do that again.

These were pretty good.  I made exactly as stated but it was quite bland.  Perhaps it was the enchilada sauce I used?  I used Old El Paso.  Would make again but try an enchilada sauce that I can find on All Recipes.

These are very simple and taste great. The only think different I did was heat the chicken in a slow cooker with the enchilada sauce. I cooked it on hight for 2.5 hours and the chicken was falling apart it was so tender. Then I added the chicken to the pan and added all the ingredients. I also tried to make them healthier by using fat free cheddar cheese and fat free tortillas and added a can of diced tomatoes. After forming the enchiladas, I covered them with the remaining enchilada sauce from the slow cooker and remaining cheese. Very good!

Loved this recipe! However, I did add a few things to them to make it have more flavor. I saved half the enchilada sauce for the shells and I added olives and cilantro on top. I didn't broil, I just baked for 15 minutes. It came out perfect! This was my first time making enchiladas and this recipe really was easy, just very messy!

When I made this I was worried it might be dry but it wasn't. It was perfect I followed the recipe exactly. Next time, the only thing I will add is some cayenne pepper to spice it up.

I did half flour tortillas, and half corn tortillas. My husband liked flour better, I liked corn better. So either one is good! I used a mild enchilada sauce, because I have little kids (who liked it btw) but it would be much better with a medium, or hot sauce. Love the crispiness that broiling it at the end does!

I make this recipe pretty much exactly as its written.  My boyfriend always wants these chicken enchiladas.  I do not make it for our younger children because it can be a little on the spicy side for little ones, but my 12 year old loves them.

I found this not very exciting.  it may have been the enchilada sauce i used. hard to say, but in any case something was lacking in the flavor. i will say this was easy to make.

Great tasting and very easy! Used a can of tomatoes with green chilies instead of just the chilies (that's what I had on hand). Used Mexi-cheese and put enchilada sauce/cheese on top too. Very good, will make again!

I loved this recipe. ..to spice it up I added a half packet of taco seasoning to the chicken.   I then dipped the tortilla in hot oil for about 2 sec on each side and dipped it thru some enchillada sauce before filling them.  The hot oil makes the tortilla soft so they are easier to roll up.

Loved this recipe. I did not follow the recipe precisely either I made some changes that were more to my taste. My changes were as follows: I used flour tortillas, instead of corn and instead of chopping/dicing the onions and garlic I added the jalepenos, some olives and the garlic and onions together and pureed them because I do not like chunks of onion. Then I followed the directions and at the end I placed olives and the left over sauce on top with the cheese as well. My photo I added is #4 I believe half eaten ROFL

I have picky eaters in my house but my husband and son both loved this! Changed a few things to suit our taste however. Added black olives, jalepeno's and sweet red pepper and instead of shredded chicken used ground chicken which worked just as great!  I also poured another jar of enchilada sauce on the top before baking and put cheddar on top.  Super delish!!  My husband asked if we were in a 5 star restaurant!  Thanks for sharing!

The brand of enchilada sauce and tortillas has everything to do with how this turns out.  I used a larger sized can of Las Palmas mild enchilada sauce and the thick Mission corn tortillas.  I heated some of the sauce to dip the tortillas in until they were soft enough to roll.  After filling the pan, I added the remaining the sauce to the top.  Because this particular sauce is plenty spicy for me, I used colby-jack cheese and placed most of it on top of the sauce, then sprinkled sliced black olives over that.  It ended up making 13 very filling enchiladas, enough for dinner and lunches.  My husband said they were excellent...about 10 times!!

I would give 5 stars if recipe included sour cream. It was good but really needs some sour cream next time I make it and more shredded cheese.

Extremely delicious!  These were very easy to make and perfect for those busy school nights.  The only change I recommend making is adding more cheese.  My family loves their cheese so I usually double the amount of cheese and it turns out very well!

These were good.  Added 1/4 cup sour cream to the chicken mixture.  These ended up more like big Taquitos than Enchiladas.  The tortillas got really crunchy.  All in all- good flavor and whole family enjoyed them.

These were great as is.  Just the right amount of heat.  Cut the recipe in half since it was just the two of us for dinner.  I like more cheese than my wife, so we assembled our own.  Wonderful flavor!

I didn't have cooked chicken so sauted chicken with a little chilli seasoning.  Putting the sauce in with chicken mixture made it very easy

this was really good! I had a lot of leftover roasted chicken to use up! Personally I don't like enchiladas doing the back stroke in a pool of cream of what-ever soup, so this was exactly to my taste. The tortillas were crisp and crunchy and the filling was picante!

This recipe was very easy to make, which was a plus. I skipped the broiling step and didn't miss it at all. Next time I will get an extra can of enchilada sauce to pour over the top, plus add more chili powder and cumin for flavor.

The only change I made was to increase to 2 cans of enchilada sauce and used one to drench the tortillas before stuffing and rolling. I used low carb tortillas and it was delish. Will make again!

This is hands-down THE BEST enchilada recipe I've tried.  I used green enchilada sauce so it would be milder for my 1-year-old, but it would definitely be delicious if hotter, for those who like it kicked up a notch.  Quick, easy, and delicious.  The whole family loved it!  I would give more than five stars if I could!!

These are REALLY good. Was skeptical as I thought there was really nothing spectacular about the ingredients. I used corn tortillas, added some pinto beans to chicken mixture and used green enchilada sauce on top as well as some shredded jack cheese.

Hands down restaurant quality!  My family loved it!  The only things I did was add about 1 cup sour cream, used pre-cut chicken breast and used about 2 cans of the sauce, like to add a lot on top and then smothered with Montery Jack cheese.    Soo good I can't wait to make it again.

My husband is an enchilada fanatic and we live in a town with no mexican food restaurant so have been trying to find a decent recipe.  I made these ones and he stated these were the closest to restaurant quality I have made so far.  I also used a ready baked chicken and used 3/4 of the sauce mixed in the chicken and added the rest of the 1/4 to the top of the enchiladas along with some cheese sprinkled on top.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I did add an extra can of enchilada sauce on top of the enchiladas.  Also took advice of past reviews and added 1 tablespoon of taco seasoning to chicken mixture.  Added 1 cup of cheese to chicken mixture and 1/2 cup of cheese sprinkled on top.  Next time I'll add 1/2 cup sour cream to make them a little more moist.  Delicious!

These weren't bad, but it was a bit soggy. I don't know if it was the brand of corn tortillas I bought or the fact that I don't use this type of tortilla, but they had a weird taste. I would make these again, but probably use flour tortillas that have been cooked briefly in hot oil. Or I may turn it into a casserole with tortilla chips. It was easy to make though!

The only thing I changed about this recipe was actually frying the tortillas for a sec and then dipping them in the sauce, when I followed the recipe's instructions the tortillas were very hard the next day at both ends where there was no sauce. Other than that, it is an excellent recipe I've made on numerous occasions!

I boiled my chicken in beer, taco seasoning, chili powder, cumin and white ground pepper and it turned out great.  I also doubled the cheese.

I have been tweaking recipes for a long time trying to get the perfect Chicken Enchilada and now I've got it thanks to All Recipes and my favorite - the reviewers - you guys are great!!  The only change I made was per one of the reviewers who dredged the tortillas in enchilada sauce - thank you for that.  My family loved these, I was hoping for leftovers but no such luck!

These were very good. I used a little less than half a sweet onion, only half the can of green hatch chiles, and mexican blend cheese. I had some leftover enchilada sauce that I used for this. I added a half package of homemade taco seasoning to the chicken filling. I'm not sure how much chicken 1 lb is, I used 2 boneless skinless breasts and it was just right. Great little recipe and it turned out very tasty.

I love this recipe-it's easy and super tasty. It's now one of my whole families favorites! Sometimes to make it easier-I make this lasagna style where I just layer the tortillas and chicken mix-and top it with lots of extra cheese. So good!

My picky five-year-old ate this meal without complaint! I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added black beans. I used olive oil and flour tortillas. In the future, I would use an extra enchilada sauce so I could pour some over the top. I used a cheese blend and added green onion over the top which was the perfect compliment!

Tasty but way too spicy for me and I didn't even put in the green chilies.  I had to use sour cream to temper the heat.  Would make again but use cheddar cheese instead of jalapeno jack

This recipe says "broil for 5 minutes". I did as the recipe said and ended up with half charred enchiladas. I just assumed i could follow the directions as stated with such a highly rated and simple recipe.

A little dry. Sour cream is a must. Doubled the cheese. After these things, delicious!

I thought it was pretty good however I did things just a tiny bit different.  I seasoned the chicken with cayenne pepper and paprika plus a little salt and pepper.  After I shredded it, I put half of the chilies in a pan and the rest in the pan with the sauce, onions and garlic.  I put the chicken and chilies in flour tortillas (I only used 5) and then ladled the sauce of the top and put regular shredded cheddar on top.  My husband wasn't a fan of all the onion but besides that, we really liked it

This was excellent! I did exactly as the recipe called for in addition to adding more sauce on top and then sprinkle with cheese. They weren't too spicy and could've stood for some spicing up but being that I have 2 little kids, it was perfect. Everyone cleaned their plates!

These were "OK." My fiance liked them, but I didn't.... At least they were easy to prepare :) On Wed., I go to a networking grp. and therefore am not usually home until later in the afternoon. I rarely feel like prep. an extravagant meal, but am always HUNGRY lol!!!!! This recipe fit my needs perfectly!!! I did find it necessary to make a few minor adjustments, however. As paslea1987 did, I too 'dipped' my (corn) tortillas to prevent cracking, but not in enchilada sauce - I used slightly warm chx. broth instead. To avoid a "dry" enchilada, I comb. a 10 oz. can of La Plaz enchilada sauce w/ my skillet mix. & then poured a bit of the other can (I used 2 cans tot.) on the bottom of my greased baking dish & the rest on top of my enchiladas. Following Traci B's Kitchen's advice, I added more cheese to each rolled tortilla (in addition to the 1/2 c. cheese I melted w/ the chx. mix.) & used the remainder of the 8 oz. bag of Kraft Mexican-style cheddar pepperjack cheese on top (we LOVE cheese!). To speed prep, I purchased a rotisserie chicken at my local grocer yesterday (they are 1/2 price after 9 PM!), but I suggest making your own & using the leftovers for this recipe instead (just be sure to plan ahead!). I think a garnish of chopped green onion / sliced olives & a dollop of sour cream would be a nice touch (and I think I would have enjoyed these much more had I done so...). Served w/ tortilla chips & Dirty Rice by jen (also on this site), this was a very filling meal. Thx!

Followed recipe but used flour tortillas.  It was an easy recipe for left over chicken.  But my kids hated them.  My husband and I thought they were good but not great.  We won't make again.

This was very good.  I only made two changes.  I used whole wheat tortillas and I used cheddar cheese because that's what we had on hand.  I used some left over chicken from the Delicious Baked Chicken recipe on this site.  My 10 year old daughter enjoyed helping me make this and it was so easy to prepare, she can probably make it herself next time.

I though this dish was great. In addition to the can of green chilies i added a can of diced tomato and chilies and folded it in to the chicken and onion. I left the can of enchilada sauce to pour on top and sprinkled jalapeno cheddar on top as well.

Yummy!  What a keeper.  I improvised a little to suit my family's taste and what I had on hand.  Just sprinkled garlic and chili powders in with the chicken/sauce mixture and heated before adding cheese.  Topped with a little more cheese and a little more enchilada sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was delicious! My husband, who usually hates Mexican food, loved these! When I made them the second time, I was in a rush and used a little bit too much enchilada sauce so the end product was a bit mushy.. However, that was my mistake and you shouldn't usually have that problem. All around, I love this recipe and will definitely use it again.

This is a great recipe. I also added a little cumin to the chicken. I also like the fact that this recipe calls for corn tortillas which is one of the major differences between an enchilada and a burrito. This is a classic enchilada.

The is absolutely delicious. The best homemade chicken enchiladas I have had yet. We seasoned the chicken with cumin to give it a little extra flavor. Also sprinkled extra mixture and cheese on top. Tastes great with whole grain tortilla shells as well.

I used fat free sour cream instead of cheese in the mixture, and also poured an additional 10 oz sauce on top of the enchiladas.  I dipped my warmed tortillas in some of the enchilada sauce instead of water, which worked well to keep them from breaking up and also added some extra flavor.  It is a good recipe, fairly simple, but I think I need to search for a better enchilada sauce next time or make it from scratch.

This recipe is very good and so simple.  My family really enjoyed it the first time around and we have it on our menu for this week!  I like to add the cheese to the chicken mix and on top and I also buy a bigger can of sauce so that I have extra for the top.  Also, I use flour tortillas instead of corn but that's just because I prefer them more.

So simple and delicious. I used shredded beef instead of chicken and saved some of the enchilada sauce (1/4) to dribble on top of the enchiladas before adding cheese. This is definately a keeper!

These were very good.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn just because my husband doesn't like corn tortillas.  I had 2 leftover chicken breasts we had grilled 2 days before so I diced them up.  The only modifications I made were adding black beans and sour cream to the chicken mixture and adding enchilada sauce plus shredded cheese over the top.  I only broiled for 3 minutes because they were perfectly browned at that point.  We served with fresh salsa, sour cream and jalapenos.  Very, very tasty!

These enchiladas are delicious!  Because of my toddler, I included diced red pepper instead of the spicy chili and I used regular cheddar cheese.  I also added a can of rinsed black beans, a small can of olives, an extra can of enchilada sauce and about 1/2 cup of sour cream.  A huge hit!

LOOVE this recipe, changed it up a bit, didn't cook w/the chiles because of my kids and cut the sauce by half in the mixture and added some sofrito instead....AWESOME!!  It was a huge hit, and really easy to make!

I made these over the weekend and thought they were wonderful.The only thing I did different was I smeared refried beans on the shells before filling them with the chicken mixture. I liked the crunch the broiler added to them. They were on the dry side but that's how I like them. I also thought mild sauce was spicy enough, since I'm not a spicy food eater. Maybe just a little more cheese next time.

This was a fantastic recipe! I made a big batch for a bunch of my college friends and they all scarfed it down. I did what the other reviews suggested and saved some sauce and cheese for the top. I also rubbed taco seasoning into my chicken before I baked it so that gave it some extra flavor. I would suggest doing at least a batch and a half of the sauce because we ran out quick. But overall delicious!

This was really good, but I have a few suggestions.  I would suggest broiling this for about 3 minutes instead of 5.  It's important to keep an eye on it when under the broiler because it can get dried out vey quickly.  When serving this dish I added fresh salsa on top which gave it some extra spice.

4 for taste and 1 for prep. no matter what i did the corn tortilla's would fall apart. i warmed them up, dipped them in water, broth and enchilada sauce....nothing worked. besides that they were very tasty. i used three cans of enchilada sauce and added a can of corn. so yummy! will make again but leave out the tortilla next time and use it as a chip dip!!!

I followed a couple reviews and used way more enchilada sauce. The last recipe I used never seemed to call for enough sauce so I used 1 28oz can for this recipe. It was not as dry as the other recipe I followed. I minced a few cloves of garlic w/ the chopped onions. And I added a lot of cheese. I know that deviates from the given recipe a bit, but still turned out tasty!

I used two cans of red enchilada sauce. 3/4 can in the pan, 1/4 in the bottom of the baking dish and another full can on top. I tossed about. 1 tblspoon of chili powder into the pan as well based on other reviews. Plus, added about 3/4 cup cheddar on top of the rolled enchiladas, and topped with 1/2 cup sliced jalape√±o and one small can of diced black olives. I had whole wheat tortillas on hand and used them in lieu of the corn (although not excrly authentic, this really help the texture IMHO) This recipe may be great on it's own as well, I'm just a better cook when I veer from the recipe a bit!

very good and super easy!!! My boyfriend and I made these yesturday for dinner. Im currently eating the leftovers at my desk.. really good. I took other reviewers advice and poured the rest of the enchilada sauce over them before baking..i also dipped the tortillas in the enchilada sauce in place of the water. I added jalapenos and a can of black beans to the filling mixture.. very good. Next time i think ill add more cheese and some fresh tomato slices on top at the end..very good

I'm giving it a four b/c I poured half of another can of sauce on top of the enchiladas before baking so they wouldn't be too dry. That said, my husband said these were restaurant quality and I'll definitely be making them again. I served them with a Black Beans and Rice recipe I got from this site, which was the perfect side dish.

The recipe may be great... I wouldn't know. The directions are a particular kind of awful. The tortillas barely stayed together long enough for me to get them filled and into the dish. Some where it really needs to say, "You need a tortilla steamer to make these into anything resembling an enchilada." I am eating crumbled tortilla over enchilada filling. It is also not what I would call spicey. Actually it is quite bland.  On a positive note... I do like the filling.

I just made this recipe and wasn't really impressed. It was really bland.  I ended up adding quite a bit of onion and garlic powder as well as a few tablespoons of sour cream and half a can of seasoned black beans to the filling.  I also bought an extra can of sauce to pour over the top of the enchiladas.

Following some advice I used more sauce; I poured some on top and they were very good!.. After sprinkling the chicken mixture over the tortilla I then added cheese generously inside before rolling.  I also sprinkled more cheese on top of the dish before baking!..

Seemed a little bland and dry.  Maybe I should have used more sauce?

I LOVED these!  Even my family decided that we should do "Mexican Food Monday" every week because they thought these were so delicious!  I made my own enchilada sauce using another recipe I found on allrecipes.  I added a little more cheese because we can never have enough.  The whole pan was gone- my 5 year old had 3rds and 4ths!

Recipe has potential, but definitely is too dry if made per recipe.  I followed the recipe, and would double the enchilada sauce next time - using 10 oz inside the enchilada and pouring 10 oz on top prior to baking.  I will try making them again, and hopefully doubling the sauce will do the trick!

Perfect enchiladas...we had tried out several enchilada recipes that were much more complex but did not taste as good as this one!  This is my new go-to recipe!  I used a 16oz can of enchilada sauce instead of the 10oz can and poured the remaining sauce over the enchiladas before baking...this was the perfect amount (they were not dry) Yum!

I doubled the enchilada sauce and used one can to top the whole thing off.  These were a total hit!  Everyone loved them.  I'll definitely make them again soon!

This is a great base recipe.  I made it exactly as stated and thought it had great flavor, but too dry.  I will make again but will double the cheese and enchilada sauce, using 1 can of enchilada sauce in the chicken mixture, and the other can on top of the enchiladas.

This is by far my favorite enchilada recipe. I usually use more cheese then 1/2 cup and shredded chicken. This recipe is definitely underrated!

I've made this twice now, and my husband says it's one of his favorite meals that I make.  I do tweak it a little by adding some beans, tomatoes and potatoes to the filling.  I use green enchilada sauce, and I think that makes all the difference.

I made these a few days ago and everyone loved them. I saved some of the enchilada sauce to pour right before putting them in the oven and I sprinkled extra cheese on top. The enchiladas were delicious. The chicken filling was excellent. I am going to make these again soon!

I absolutely loved this recipe! It was super easy and my husband LOVED it! However, I did change it up a little bit. We happened to be out of chicken, so we used canned chicken instead and it tasted great! Also, we added more cheese and less garlic.  I for sure will be using this one again.  Thanks!

Pretty good.  

We didn't have pepper jack so we used a 4 cheese Mexican blend and only had whole wheat flour tortillas.  We also poured a little enchilada sauce over each with a small topping of cheese to help prevent drying out.

I agree with a prior review that the chicken mixture does need needs a little extra kick.  Perhaps some dried chilis in the mixture?  But overall, a good basic recipe that we will use again.

This is a good basic recipe. I added some fresh cilantro and a pinch of red pepper which added some kick.
