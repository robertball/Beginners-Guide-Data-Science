What do you do when neither you nor your husband eats grapefruit, and are gifted with 10 pounds of it for Christmas? Well, you make lots of seabreezes!  A quick trick - roll the uncut fruit around on the counter or firmly between your hands for a minute or two before slicing and more of the juice will be released from the skins! Also, a cheesecloth can help separate out all the pulp and seeds better than a juicer can.

An all time favorite! These go down way too easy and are especially good with a bit of coconut rum.  Perfect drink for summer.

This is really excellent with either Malibu coconut or banana rum, on top of the straight vodka.

This is a super drink. My husband loves it with Vodka, but I prefer it with tequila. I also use no sugar added Ruby Red grapefruit juice. Yummy, thanks for the recipe.

Sorry, I drink seabreezes all the time, and  I use 2 part grapefruit juice and 1 part or less of cranberry juice.  Drink should be pale pink in color.  If you use to much cranberry juice it becomes to sweet and masks the grapefruit juice.  Always add a twist of lime.

You can cut out the tart/bitter flavor by using orange juice instead of the grapefruit juice. It's ideal with coconut rum. On a HOT summer night it's  lucious !!!

I love these. I like to add a wedge of lime squeezed into it. I even had this during a recent snow storm. A Sea Breeze is great anytime of year in my opinion!

Refreshing, but very bitter as written.  After I doubled up on the cranberry juice and cut back slightly on the grapefruit juice, it was perfect.

I called it "The Impregnator" because it came out a pretty pinkish purple and I have two friends trying to conceive. Great hit!

This is very easy to make.  I use frozen cranberry juice and bottled grapefruit juice.  I usually make it without the alcohol since vodka really doesn't seem to add any flavor--just a little buzz, if that's what you want.

This has been our favorite cocktail for years. I do prefer 2 parts fresh or high quality grapefruit juice to 1 part diet cranberry juice  cocktail. Makes it a lower calorie, light drink, that is health conscious. LOL
Just recently started using a flavored vodka like Absolute Mango. Wow, what a delicious low carb cocktail.
