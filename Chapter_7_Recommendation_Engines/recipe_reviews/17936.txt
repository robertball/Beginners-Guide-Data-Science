Very quick and easy to make. Texture is excellent, could use extra flavor. Perhaps use bacon grease instead of butter. Overall an excellent recipie.

I gave this a four, with some changes. I added 1/4 cup celery and 1/8 carrots for color (as previously reccemmended). I increased the salt to 3/4 ts, the pepper to 1/8 ts, the onion to 2 tb, and the dill weed to 1/4 ts. The soup was thick enough not to need any flour. My husband also added a dolop of sour cream on top.  I think green onions would be nice, too.  Oh, and there is no way this makes 4 servings. We got 2 out of it, with no seconds. I think we will make this again, with the said changes, and will double it.

Consistency is very good, but I added a few more spices to give it a little more kick.

Too bland for my taste.  I would tweak it up next time myself.  Hubby loved it.

I love this soup - it's nothing super fancy, but tastes great with the dill and is a full mean when you add green onions and cheese!

This was good. I think it called for alittle to much onion, but it does have a great taste. I served with beer bread from this site and it turned out a great dinner.

It was pretty good. I'd agree that it was a little bland.
The changes I made were adding bacon and carrots. I cooked the carrots and onion in the bacon grease. I didn't really need the flour. 
My boyfriend would have liked it better chunky, but I liked the smooth consistency. I added more onion and replaced the dill with parsley. 
Oh! I put the parsley in with the boiling potatoes and when I pureed them, it turned kind of green! So be careful of that!
All in all pretty good, but still a little bland. I'd still recommend it, just add your own personal touch!

Without my adaptations, this recipe would have received a lot lower rating.  I took some suggestions for added flavor and it came out great!  I doubled it (so my husband could take some to work for dinner), but instead of doing 3 cups of broth for a double batch, I did 4.  I used about 3/4 cup chopped onion and I added 1/4 cup thinly sliced celery.  I also added garlic salt to taste and about 1/4 cup of bacon bits.  I didn't have any dill, so I omitted it.  After stirring it all together, it was too thick, so I added half and half until it was to a more soup-like consistency.  I also crubmled colby-jack cheese over the top.  SUPER YUMMY in the end.

Basic recipe and easy to make.  I doubled it to make enough for 3 people and added diced ham.  Very tasty with grated cheese (my husband tried cheddar and I had Gouda on mine).

I just made this soup.  I made it with leftover mashed potatoes instead of fresh, added bacon bits and some cooked finely chopped mushrooms sauted.  It was really good.

This soup is very thick and creamy. I used chicken bone broth instead of regular chicken broth an it tastes amazing. I will definitely add this to my cold winter night rotation of soups.  Very simple to make and takes no time at all from beginning preparation to relaxing and enjoying it.

Delicious and easy to make. I used unsweetened almond milk instead of regular milk. At the very end it needed a bit more watering down, so I added about a half cup of sweetened almond milk. It gave a boost without being sweet. I also added a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder. Thank you for this recipe!

This is such an easy recipe that I wont have to read it again to remember it. Delish..I added roasted garlic and 4 strips of bacon (chopped finely and pan fried, drippings and all went in). Really hit the spot and now I can share it, so easy and great flavor.
