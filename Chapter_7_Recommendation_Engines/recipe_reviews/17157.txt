I'm not sure why people had trouble with this setting up. I have not made this one, I use my mom's recipe that is very old. It is: 1 large size jello, 2 cups hot water (no cold water), 1/2 pint orange sherbert or a little more. Jello should be a thick syrupy consistency and then add 1 cup drained mandarin oranges. This fills a small jello mold. I have never ever had problems with this setting up and have made this since I was a child. I really hope this helps, if it doesn't set up, then you didn't add enough sherbert. Good luck!

Tastes delicious however if using the juice from the mandarin oranges
use 6 oz size of gelatin.  When I used the 3 oz size called for in the 
recipe it didn't set properly.  To save it, I dissolved another package of
gelatin in a small amount of hot water and added it to the salad.  It
then set up properly.

The salad set fine for me. This is fun to make, I think it was one of the first recipes I ever made as a child.

First time I could talk my daughter into making a jello mold.  Told her to look here for a recipe.  Darn-  Thanksgiving, a house full of guests-the "Mold" was liquid.  After looking at the recipe, it was understood.  You say drain the oranges, however, then the directions say "Add...mandarin oranges with juice".  What juice?  Of course, she thought the mandarin orange juice.  PS - my daughter is 24 and was so disappointed, besides wasting all the ingredients.

I made it exactly as the author wrote and had no trouble with it setting up. I'm not sure why some people might. Could altitude have anything to do with it? We had this for special family meals when I was younger. My aunt made this and I still love it.

this is very similar to the recipe i use... i use 3 - 3oz pks gelatin, 2 1/4 C boiling water, 1 quart of orange sherbet, and 1 - 8oz sour cream.  i dissolve gelatin, then mix in sour cream, then mix in sherbet.  i chill for about 30 min till partially set. then i add the mandarin oranges, then chill over night.  its really good.  its always a hit!

I thought that the recipe was good.  The kids didn't too much care for it though.

The jello didn't set too well and I even used 6 oz. of jello like someone else suggested here.  I also think that using the juice from the mandarin oranges made the jello that much more sweet so it gave it a very, very orange"y" taste.  Nobody touched it at the party other than a couple of people who made sour-looking faces.

I made this the day before I was having a picnic, and the next day I was so disappointed.  It was a total liquidy mess, and yes, I did follow the directions exactly...drained the oranges, etc.  Not sure why this doesn't work!  I've never had problems with a recipe from here before!

I had to bring a jello to a funeral luncheon.  Made this the night before and was totally disappointed the next day.  It didn't set!   Very disappointed as I purchased all the ingredients to make two of them.  I wanted to make another for Mother's Day on Sunday, but will decline now.  :(

My mom told me sometimes the jello gets old and won't set up.  I wonder if that could be why some people had trouble.  It doesn't seem like the kind of thing that would expire.

The first few bites of this gelatin mold were good; after that the heavy orange taste became a little overwhelming. I think it would be better with pineapple or another fruit added.

Actually followed Awesome in Tummy’s recipe under comments. Came out perfect. I also used sugar-free gelatin. Reminds me of my Aunts house at every holiday celebration.
