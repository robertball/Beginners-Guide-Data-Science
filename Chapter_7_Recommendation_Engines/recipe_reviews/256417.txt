Very good! I wasn't sure, so I used marinated artichokes, which worked well in this. I was afraid that there was gonna be too much going on here, but all the flavors went together nicely. This does have a nice kick to it, and I reduced the cayenne a bit, so just keep that in mind. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
