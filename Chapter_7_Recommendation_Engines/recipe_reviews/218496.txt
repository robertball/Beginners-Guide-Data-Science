Don't bother me I'm eatin'. Really I have a big piece of Donnasue's casserole right here and it's awesome. I am a hopeless lover of cornbread which is what caught my eye. I may have been born in California but to Southern parents. I'm a Southerner at heart. When I was a kid mama and daddy would pick a bunch of salad fixin's from the garden. Then we'd each chop up our own salad of raw mustard greens lettuce green onions radishes and tomatoes and then we topped it off with hot bacon drippings dressing. I knew mixing cornbread and mustard greens this had to be awesome and it didn't fail to make me smile. Did yourself proud Donnasue. I'm goin' after more Cornbread Casserole Don't bother me...

I made this without the ham and meat tenderizer (I'm vegetarian) and used almond milk (cause that's what I had) but otherwise followed this exactly. OMG it was amazing! Having recently joined a CSA and received a huge bunch of mustard greens (which I had never even seen before much less cooked) I came in search of something to do with them that didn't require bacon grease. Well this is it!! I served this casserole like cornbread with butter slices on top and EVERYONE went back for seconds. We ate it with a vegetable soup. This will be a recipe staple.

This is very easy to prepare however it was a little dry for our taste. The flavors go well together but I don't think enough for me to make it again. Just seemed like it was missing something.

I made it for the first time and luv it. Next time I know to add red pepper flakes because I like my greens with a little kick to it. Other than that it turned our great!

Mine came out a little dry with too much bread. I will try again with only the cornbread mix. Also this was a bit much for my largest casserole dish. Taste was a little bland. I was happy to note that my rather bitter mustard greens came out mild after cooking.
