Well the Pork Board certainly came up with a winner with this one! What a great recipe and just perfect for this time of year when folks are looking to use up their Easter ham and hard boiled eggs. My only suggestion would be to use two slices of bacon per roll up rather than two slices for four. So good!!!!!!!!

Made these for Super Bowl Sunday. Even tho I'm not a huge egg lover, I was very geeked to make these by rollng them up in flour tortillas and serving them!  They were good...interesting I'd say. The egg was a little overpowering tho, so next time, we'll cut back a little on that part and add more bacon.   Making them the way we did, fed WAY more than 4 people tho! We made 2 rolls (burrito size tortillas) and one would have been enough for 4 people.

These were great!  I used real bacon bits to avoid having to cook a pack of bacon.  They were great, although I'd recommend making sure that your ham isn't too thin or they could fall apart when you roll them.

I made this as a wrap with a tortilla.  It's excellent, very good.  Don't use too much mayo though.
