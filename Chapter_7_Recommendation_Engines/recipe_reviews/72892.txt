I just made one large packet instead of individual ones.  Easier to handle and takes up less room on the grill.  I added Parmesan cheese and fresh torn basil to the pine nuts. We loved these with any sort of steak or london broil!

When I first made this recipe, I followed it as is, except halved it and used one foil pack instead of individual ones.  That worked out fine, but I wasn't wowed by the flavor.  I wanted to try them again, so  I added chopped garlic to the stuffing.  Adding the garlic helped quite a bit.  Four stars with garlic!

These were FANTASTIC...the pine nuts are a great compliment to the mushrooms & onions, and the flavors come togeter very well on the grill.  Will definitly use again.

This recipe was not bad.  The pine nuts definitely give the mushrooms a unique flavor.  Personally i prefer stufed mushrooms with a breadcrumb/parmesan cheese kind of filling.

This was tasty. I added some parmesan cheese and extra virgin olive oil to the stuffing mix. I think the olive oil helped everything stick together and stay inside the mushrooms. I will grill for a bit less than 20 minutes next time, as some came out a bit too charred.

This dish was so good, I made it as presented the first time for myself and my husband as an appetizer.  I asked my husband what he thought could be added to make it more to his liking.  So this is what he came up with:  Keep basic recipe as is, add 1 Tbs. parmesan cheese, 1 Tbs. fine bread crumbs, 1 mashed minced clove garlic,  1 tsp. dried parsley.  I guess we're just used to the traditional stuffed mushrooms, but these with the pine nuts were really special. 
 I served them the other night when we had a BBQ with another couple, as a side dish to steak accompanied with a chopped tomato and cucumber salad.  Six to a foil wrapped packet was perfect, a little surprise to each plate....lot's of good comments, thanks dipc1974, we now have two new foodies to follow Allrecipes.

These are fantastic. Who would have thought just mushrooms, pine nuts and green onions would make such a great combination, but they do. I make this frequently and have always done it in the oven in a 13x9 casserole dish. Works well. I serve them as side dishes for dinner and plan on making them for New Year's Eve appetizers. A keeper for sure.
