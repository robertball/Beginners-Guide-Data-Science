This marinade tasted delicious when I first tasted it. It would be great for dipping wontons.  After the salmon marinated in it for an hour, it was a bit overpowering.  It may be better if it's marinated for just a few minutes and then grilled instead of cooking in the marinade.

Took note of the last review and marinated it only for 20 minutes.  The flavour was alright and this recipe is incredibly easy to make but sadly only worth 3 stars.  Hope you enjoy the picture I took for it! :)

I marinated about 15 minutes and broiled it in the oven.  The salmon turned out great!
