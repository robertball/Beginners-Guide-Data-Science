I've been making this same recipe for years.  It's an easy, weeknight meal.  The only thing I do different is I bake the chicken and sauce for 30 minutes at 350, then add the pepperoni and bake another 20 minutes.  Then add the cheese.  A one dish meal for easy cleanup.

Even though I cooked and then baked a little extra time, on the chicken, it still wasn't cooked all the way through.  I then put it in the microwave to finish cooking it.
The reason I give it only two stars is I could barely eat it after serving it to family still raw. It might have tasted fine, but I just can't eat it again.

Love the movie,  love the recipe!  I had some chicken thighs already cooked, so I chopped a few pepperoni slices, put it in the sauce, and poured it over the thighs with a hearty portion of mozzarella cheese (and some more slices on top).

"Anyone who makes me make chicken pepperoni, makes me crazy, and YOU...are making me crazy!"
