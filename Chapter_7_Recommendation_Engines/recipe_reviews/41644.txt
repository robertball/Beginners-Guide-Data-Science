Very tasty recipe, but looking more forward to the leftovers; thinking that the flavors will have come together more.  Next time I would let everything simmer together longer on low heat before serving.  May also substitute a different tortelloni, e.g. stuffed spinach or cheese.  The sauce is delicious.

I agree that it could be simmered longer to help blend the flavors but otherwise this was absolutely wonderful.  And the leftovers are even better!
