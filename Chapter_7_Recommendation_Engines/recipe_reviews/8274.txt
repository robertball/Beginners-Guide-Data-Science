Mmmmmmmm! I'm eating one that has been out of the oven for less than 10 minutes and it is sooo good. Chewy crispy top, velvety cakelike center. I think it should be a little bit cooler to serve though! The center is still really soft. I suspect that anybody who has a failure with this recipe will be tripped up by step number 3. Here's how to keep them from collapsing and to avoid the egginess. Where the recipe says "In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, vanilla, sugar and flour."  Don't just stir them together, since there is no leavening in this recipe except the eggs, beat them with the sugar until thick and light lemon colored (about 3-4 minutes with a Kitchenaid) before adding the flour, vanilla and then the chocolate mixture. I got 18 cupcakes from my batch.

Description of this recipes says these should taste like a rich chocolate brownie. They have a decent texture but not much chocolate flavor.

This recipe is awesome! I just pulled a batch out of the oven and they came out perfectly! My younger brother was begging to eat them(unfortunately he couldn't, we're making them for a birthday) and i caught him several times sneaking licks of the batter! However, this recipe only got 4 stars because I'm a bit of a health freak, and when i took a peek at the nutrition facts, I was blown away! Also, these do need a pinch or two of baking powder to help them rise. Other than that, a fabulous recipe!

My 3 yr old daughter was playing with her playdough and said she was making "PUP-Cakes".  I asked if she'd like to make REAL ones. She said, "REAL??? ones???? - oh YES!" 
 We came here found this recipe - she helped measure and stir. She really enjoyed this recipe - EASY!!!
 Then said she had to go to the computer to get more recipes!

these are amazing. every time i have made them over the past year they have always been the best brownie-cupcake thing ever. sometimes i substitute the chocolate chips for broken up milk chocolate or hershey's chocolate syrup even, they both work wonders, especially if you like them super rich and gooey. thanks so much for this treasure! -tris

We enjoyed these cupcakes because they aren't extremely rich. If that is the type of chocolate craving you have then this is your cupcake.. If you want something dripping with chocolate pick a different recipe - or pour on some frosting on top of these!

OMG these were so good. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and about 1/4 cup cocoa. I baked them in miniature cupcake tins. They were crispy outside and chewy on the inside. Sooo good!

My husband came to me wanting some brownies. I had no store bought mix so I came to the Allrecipes.com site to look for a recipe for brownies. I just finished them and I must say that these are the best from scratch brownies I have ever made. My husband loves them. I did use self rising flour though because I had no all purpose as it calls for in the recipe. And I used block chocolate instead of chocolate chips. But they turned out really good. Have saved this recipe and will use it from now on when we want brownies.

This recipe is really good!I didn't have chocolate chips so I had to take peices out of a chocolate bar.But it still worked out pretty well.It's a little dry.I think the part that worked out the best was the top.I made them for my mom on mothers day and she loved them!She usually doesnt like chocolate but she said the cupcakes were just perfect in sweetness.I had one too and they tasted like brownies!Especially the top.Im 11 years old and I have never made a cupcake but this was really simple for me to make!

These taste great, but when I made them they sort of caved in, so presentation was a little less than what I wanted.  They taste like really good brownies!

Tried these on my picky husband and he liked them. Good flavor but I may try adding some  cocoa powder next time. Not chocolately enough for my taste, but that's just me. Good for packing in lunches or for a sweet treat to pick you up while doing housework

Great! I added about 3 tbsp of cocoa, and 1 tsp of baking soda (not sure if the baking soda helped though, I think I should’ve put more in) some turned out fluffy and some flat, but very simple and yummy!

This recipe was so easy to make and quick!  And it taste so good!  We followed the directions to the T, except when it came to the temp of the oven, we had it at 350 Degree's F instead of 300.  They never fell and were chewy and very yummy.  Even the batter was delicious.  This is for sure is a keeper.

I don't get what I did wrong. I've tried this recipe a couple different times, but the top always caves in the last 5 minutes of baking. It tastes great though, so if anyone has any suggestions on how to stop them from caving, I would definately try it again.

These were ok. If you are craving chocolate and have no other options, than make these, but throw them out the next day because they dont taste good unless they are right out of the oven.

I loved this recipe. Not only is it easy, but it extremely tastey! =) To solve the problem of them not rising, simply add two tiny pinches of baking soda.

That helped mine.

This recipe was awful. I filled the muffih pans as was instructed and it overflowed and set off my fire alarm. Finally after extra cooking time the top was burned and the bottom was uncooked. I will not try this recipe again.

I made these on a whim and since I was on the phone to Mum at the time she whipped up a batch too. The cupcakes turned out perfectly in muffin sized pattycases and had a nice fluffy texture when warm.  We did agree, however that the amount of sugar called for totally dominated the flavour and the pale brown colouring of the cakes told us long before we tasted that these cakes do not taste of chocolate at all.

The next batch recieved a healthy dose of cocoa in addition to the chocolate, they turned out firmer but at least they had flavour.

ehh... this was alright. I used Hersey's milk chocolate candy bar and reduced the amount of sugar. The recipe called for too much eggs, which is why i recieved a chewy texture. Not favorable on cupcakes. Wouldn't waste my ingredients on this one again, when theres better recipes about.

These were okay.  The flavor was very good, like a brownie only lighter and softer texture.  I had a problem with the muffins not having a bottom, they rose out of the paper! I wonder if its because I used  mini muffin tins.  I'll be making these again in regular cupcake pans.

Yuck. these turned out awful. not very chocolate-y and the egg taste was overpowering.  and very greasy. when i removed them from the muffin pan, butter had gone through the liner and onto the pan. i guess if i wanted to improve the recipe, i would add more chocolate chips. maybe even some cocoa powder. and less butter.

My cupcakes didn’t rise and had giant holes in the center. I even followed the modification and beat the eggs in the mixer for a couple minutes first. Taste was okay but the look was not great at all.

Made twice. Dense the first time so second time I added 1.5 tsp of baking soda and about 1 TB cocoa powder. It fell and cracked in the top. More like a brownie than cake.

The other comments said they weren't chocolatey enough so I added some Cocoa powder to the mixture (I had just 1 cup of chocolate chips) and they came out great. They are much more like a brownie than a cupcake but great for when I don’t have and frosting on hand.

Thanks Sandy, I made these with my 4 year old daughter and they were delicious. I followed one of the reviewers suggestion and ensured the eggs and sugar was mixed well prior to adding the flour and vanilla in step 3. Also I didn’t have any chocolate chips so I melted a dark chocolate bar I had in the cupboard.

These were delicious!  Be sure to not overfill the cupcake liners.  Foil liners work much better than paper!

I thought they were delicious, the chocolate is not dark, but more of a sweet milk chocolate taste. I really love that you can eat them almost as soon as they come out of the oven. A pan of brownies cuts better after it's cooled, so quickly servable is a real bonus.

I didn't really like this. They turned out extremely flat and were VERY VERY eggy tasting. Also they seemed to be a bit greasy. They stuck to the bottom of the pan too. I would recomend not using as much butter and more cocoa. I wouldn't make these unless you have very UN-picky eaters which in my house I don't.
