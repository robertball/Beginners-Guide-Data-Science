1.5tsp is WAY too much salt for this recipe at least with British condensed soup and British cheddar cheese. MAYbe.5tsp... but this was inedible.

While salty I didn't have a problem with that. My problem was using the condenced soup as a short cut there is no brand specification which can lead this recipe well astray from it's intent. Also I don't believe a real souffle can make up for the lack of real skill going into it with a condenced soup as a replacement for eggs and cream. I also seriously suggest adding another spice or veggie into this recipe to lighten it a bit. How about some dry mustard or paprika? Also some shallots and/or minced onions added to the butter to saute fits well. Also about 1 cup sifted flour to this mixture helps firm and set up the souffle and add a slight crust.

I think this recipe would be better with less salt. I found it almost to salty to eat

We altered the salt as suggested but after an hour it was still runny and not set. Will not make again.
