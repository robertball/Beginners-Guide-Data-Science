I made two small changes; I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil (I made fried chicken today, I didn't have enough oil for the cake) and I subtracted two teaspoons of water and added a teaspoon each of pure vanilla extract and almond extract. I baked this cake in a glass 9x13 baking pan--my cake was done at 32 minutes. This is one of the BEST cakes I've ever made. The texture of this cake is almost like a lighter version of a pound cake. My husband said this reminds him of Snickerdoodles. Absolutely DELICIOUS. This recipe's a keeper.

I normally don't try recipes without a large number of reviews.  I tried this one because I had all the ingredients on hand and was in a pinch.  I followed the recipe exactly as it is written, and it is fantastic!  The cake turns out dense and very moist; it looks, smells, and tastes like a honeybun. I served this as an after dinner dessert, but it could easily work with breakfast as well. Very simple recipe that I will make over and over again.

So delicious and the icing really does make it taste like a honeybun.  I made this in 2 – 8x8 pans so that I could give one away.  The other family enjoyed this as much as my family did.  The recipe calls for a (18.25 oz.) boxed cake mix.  The boxes now days are (16.5 oz.) so I added 1/3 cup white flour to the mix to make up the difference.  It did not alter the taste of the cake, but made up the difference in the (1.75 oz.) that are now missing from store bought cake mixes. I’ve tried this method with other cakes and have always had good luck in doing so.  Thanks Michelle for sharing your cake recipe, it is a keeper.

This cake was awesome. My guys devoured this in two days.  It's so yummy. 5 star recipe!! One thing to note it's not the same texture as a honeybun which is good for me.

Wow.  I had a box of yellow butter recipe cake mix I needed to use and came across this recipe.  I did not have high hopes since it was the butter recipe kind of mix and i only had fat free sour cream.  Also, it just doens't look like a very exciting cake.  I tried a piece shortly after I poured the icing on- it was not very good at all so I put it in the fridge thinking it might be better cold.  A few hours later I tried a small piece and could not stop!  Hubs even LOVED it and he is usually a strict peanut butter/chocolate dessert lover.  Took some to my parents and they also loved it.  Even my 6 year old said "oh my, this cake is delicious!"  Will definitley make again- maybe with a bit extra cinnamon and I might bake at 325 since I use a non-stick pan.  Awesome.  You won't be sorry for trying this- except for when your pants don't fit anymore from eating it all!

I've made this recipe two times.  The first time I followed the recipe.  As a result the middle fell &  it was way too sweet, ended up throwing it out. The second time, I added 1/4 cup flour to the dry mixture, (high altitude),  decreased the brown sugar to less than 1/4 cup, just enough brown sugar  for a light little sprinkle in the middle.  I also didn't measure the cinnamon, just sprinkled it over the brown sugar, put pecans on top of that.  SOOOO much better the second time.  This recipe is very similar to another recipe I make from Duncan Hines, that one is sock it to me cake.

This is too sweet for me!  What I did differently:  I used two eggs and two egg whites instead of 4 whole eggs.  I put the batter in cupcake tins instead of a 9 x 13 pan.  (The batter rises very little.) I only used about half of the brown sugar mixture and it was still very, very sweet.

I went exactly by the recipe, and, the instructions were very easy to follow.  This cake was a huge hit!  The filling was simple, and, perfect amount.  Topping was delicious.  This is a great cake to serve for a crowd...cut small pieces because it is sweet.  This recipe will go in my "favorites" box!  Highly recommend!

Delicious. The only thing I had to change was adding a bit more milk to the icing so I could stir it. Also I'm not a big fan of icing, so I would have only needed about half the mix. Otherwise a great tasting, moist cake.

I could not stop eating this and neither could the rest of my family. One of the best desserts ever. Only changes I made was added 2tsp vanilla (removed 2tsp of water). Increased cinnamon to 3/4tsp. Greased glass baking dish and baked at 350 for 39 min. Poored icing over immediately. It actually gets better the next day. This is a keeper for me.

I made this recipe into cupcakes and used a cream cheese frosting to top them with! they turned out absolutely delicious! I baked them for about 24 min and tested them with a toothpick before taking them out of the oven.

Yum. I have only had a tiny piece out of the corner can't wait to have a bigger one later! Very moist. I was worried that it was going to be too sweet with all the sugar it called for, but it's not.

I did not put nuts in mine since I was baking it for my 90 year young Mother's birthday!  I also used applesauce versus oil!

Whoola!  Aluishas!  Delish!  It was so deliciously easy, I'm contemplating baking it again this weekend!

This one's a keeper!  I used a Cinnamon Bun flavored cake mix instead of yellow.  FANTASTIC FLAVOR!  I also added a cream cheese flavor bakery emulsion to the icing.  It was pure heaven!

Didn't change a thing and it's WONDERFUL! Tastes like the very best honeybun in the world.  I'm trying not to eat the whole thing before the kids get home.  Mine only took 30 minutes to bake.  It's perfect.

This was great! It is really sweet, but a small piece was perfect with coffee. I made no changes to the recipe and I would definitely make again.

I made this recipe today for the first time. I didn't have sour cream so I used plain Greek yogurt and I added 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract to the batter. After the pan went in the oven, I notice a measuring cup with 1/2 cup of water on my counter. OH NO, I didn't add it to the batter!!! Now what??? Now nothing, the oohs and aaahs were endless. I'm not sure what the 1/2 cup of water was going to do but I can tell you that if you forget to add it, the results will still be delicious. Due to dietary restrictions, I am unable to eat this wonderful desert but I was told the cake was soft. I was afraid it would be dry because of the water but nope, not dry! I'm a from-scratch baker so I was skeptical about using a boxed mix but these were a real hit and so very easy. That  they can (and maybe should?) be served warm, made this last-minute decision of what to bake for a ladies breakfast a wonderful go-to recipe. Two thumbs up! Thank you for a wonderful recipe. I made this recipe again (very next day) exactly how I did yesterday but this time I remembered the 1/2 cup of water! The result, a "cakier" honey bun. It rose higher and wasn't as dense. Both ways were a great success!

Has potential but VERY oily. Not sure if you can reduce the amount of oil, but if you can then try it! Otherwise it was good.

I followed the suggestion of another cook and substituted some of the water for vanilla. This cake is moist and delicious! It is perfect for giving as a gift to new neighbors or serving for breakfast when out of town guests are visiting. It looks like it was so complicated and took lots of time, but it didn't! Everyone will be so fooled!

Decent recipe, not sure if I would make it again. I spilt the batter and made to 8x8 pans one will go to my sister. I had a little cake mix left over from a dump cake I made I used that 1/3 cup of that since the cake box wasn't as big as the recipe called for. I also used almond milk.

I was looking for recipe that involved 'yellow cake mix' when I came across what has become my absolute favorite cake recipe. Turned out perfect without altering anything. I have made this many times in the past 3 months. My new 'carry in' dinner favorite.

I made this and I really wanted to like this cake -- but I'm afraid it is too sickly sweet for my tastes. I will stick to a coffee cake made by scratch without using a cake mix. I think a cake mix already contains too much sugar to withstand this recipe.

Have always loved this cake and I always add more cinnamon. Yes it's sweet but I wouldn't expect anything less from a "HONEY BUN" cake. Lol you don't have to make it on a daily basis or eat the whole cake, but sometimes you just need a little bit of home.

I really didn't care for this, but my son liked it. It became kind of soggy in texture the next day.  There was something about the flavor that I didn't like.  Thank you for letting us try your recipe.

Excellent cake for breakfast or dessert! Goes great with coffee and tea.  I didn't purposely change anything but accidentally omitted the water and it still turned out wonderful.

I made this cake for my family for Christmas and they loved it!!! I made no changes to the recipe and it came out perfect!! I have had to make this cake every week since Christmas so it's safe to say this had been added to our regular rotation of snacks!!

This was a super easy and most delicious recipe. I added chopped walnuts as a topping to the glazed icing. What a hit!

My family has been making this one for a while, and it is always a hit. Try cutting into 2" squares and stacking on a platter. It is so rich and sweet you won't want big pieces. I garnish with a few cinnamon sticks and a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

Very tasty cake. Simple enough to make but doesn't seem like just a box cake mix. I too had the smaller cake mix and took the advice of Molly to use the additional 1/3c of flour and my cake turned our perfectly and most importantly the center didn't cave. Thanks for the yummy cake!

My mom used to make this for me for my birthday when I was a kid.  I was my favorite.  It improves with age and tastes best at about 2 days old.

Needed something simple for a group of workers at my house and came across this recipe.  It was a big hit and I've made it several time since and have never had leftovers!  Followed the recipe as written with the exception of not using all the glaze.  Thanks Michelle.

Hmmm...this is really sweet, and that's coming from a person with a strong sweet tooth.  I think though that I didn't really like the texture of the cake.  Surprising, but there it is!

I made this cake for my family reunion.  To be honest, I didn't get to taste it for myself.  Based on all of the cake being gone and my nephew going back for 6 slices...I must say it was delicious. I rate 5 for family, ease,  as well as it looking just like an iced honey bun.

Oh so good!  I used one stick of butter instead of oil and upped the cinnamon to 1 t.

OMG! There are no words for how good this cake is. If you are a lover of honey buns, you will not be disappointed. I did not change a thing, and it was one of the easiest recipes to make I had ever encountered. By the time I realized I should have submitted a picture of it, my family and I had almost eaten it up, but I saved a few slices for my grandson who was away at the time, and I can't wait for him to return, because he is a honey bun fanatic.
