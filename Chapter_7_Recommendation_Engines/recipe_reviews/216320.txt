I have made this recipe so many times and have received so many compliments BUT I have to adjust a few things.  First off- no no no processed cheese!  I use 2 cups or Sharp Cheddar Cheese.  Then I use 1 can Cream of Chicken Soup and 1 can Cream of Mushroom.  Believe me- with these changes this is a 5 star recipe.

I made this Christmas day when all stores were closed & had no Cheez Whiz on hand, but I did have Velveeta. It turned out to be a great substitute!

I really liked this!  I made just a couple changes.  Instead of cheese whiz, I used queso dip (only about 3/4 of the jar because it was a 15 oz. jar) to add a little spice to it.  I also added a can of chicken.  I really liked the chicken in it.  It made the dish a meal of its own instead of a side dish only.  I'll keep this recipe around and share it with other people.

My oven was occupied so I threw this into the crockpot (with the onions and rice already made) on High for about 3 hours and it came out delicious! I also put in a few extra scoops of Cheez Whiz

I chose the recipe based on the rating and found it disappointing.   The large onion overwhelmed the recipe.  And, I didn't like the Cheez-Wiz.  If I try it again, I will use a small onion, broccoli stalks instead of chopped and real, shredded cheddar cheese.

I made this as a side for a pork tenderloin roast and it was great! I had to make a few substitutions, but it still tasted great. Instead of using cream of chicken soup, I had to use cream of broccoli... and also instead of cheez whiz, I used Campbell's condensed cheese sauce( canned ). I also added a few handfuls of shredded cheese into the rice and also as a topping. The cheese browned very nicely on top and make the dish even more delicious!

I made this for a Thanksgiving side dish and it was perfect.  I put it together early in the day, then it went from fridge to oven to table and it tasted great.  A new addition to the holiday menu!

Thanks so much for this recipe it was so good. I made it for Thankgiving. My husband's mother passed away a couple years ago and broccoli rice casserole was one of my husbands favorite thing she made. I have been trying to find a recipe like hers and this was it. Thanks again for posting.

I didn't follow the recipie exactly so I can't rate it lower than a 5- I feel thats unfair. The casserole was dry, so I am going to follow the recipe exactly next time & update =)

Pretty good.  I would experiment with some different cheeses/spices, but good basic recipe.  I thought it was funny reading the reviews.  One person said " I followed the directions to a tee!  But, the rice wasn't even cooked". Haha!  It calls for cooked rice! good times!

I added sour cream, and it was still very bland. Could definitely use some salt and pepper and something else to dress it up a little!

I made this tonight for dinner, with a few changes that I've read through the comments.  I don't keep processed cheese like cheez whiz in the house, but I did have a can of Campbell's Broccoli & Cheddar soup, so I subbed that in for the cheez whiz.  I also added in some chicken, and minced garlic when I was sautéing the onions in butter.  I also doubled the amount of rice, so 3 cups of cooked rice total, and added some salt and pepper.

It turned out fantastic with those changes.  I couldn't imagine this recipe with half the amount of rice in it.  I think it might end up a bit on the runny side.  Overall, I'd make it again!

This is a really great recipe that you can easily customize to suit your own taste. Although, I do agree with some of the other reviewers when they say that it is a little bland as is, and really REALLY creamy! I ended up using half Velveeta and half sharp cheddar for that extra tangy-ness, about 1 tsp. salt, and using almost double the amount of rice. Since it was just adults eating this, I added a lot of fresh ground pepper. Next time I may try adding some salsa or some diced tomatoes. It makes a lot, but you will be surprised how quickly it is gone!

love this recipe and have made for daughter's bday party in Oct and Thanksgiving 2011.  Great dish for my husband that is Gluten Free and also used GF soup for this recipe.  I have also used Velvetta if Cheez Whiz is not on sale.

My aunt always made this for Thanksgiving, but she added a crunchy topping. After you pour into a baking dish, melt a small amount of butter in the skillet and add a stack of crunched up crackers. Stir until crakcers are coated, then add to the top of the casserol before baking. Makes a yummy crust!

The recipe is good with the following changes... No onion, that's just gross.. I also added some diced up jalapeños (pickled) and jalapeño juice to give it a kick of spice. Also, I used Cream of Mushroom instead... All that combined came out pretty good!

This turned out great! Very quick and easy to make & so yummy. I had to make a few modifications b/c I didn't have some ingredients (ex: I used onion powder, velveeta and mozzarella cheese).

Great recipe! I added a clove of garlic for flavor. I also cooked chicken coated in paprika and cavenders Greek seasoning. I chopped up cooked chicken and added to recipe. I topped it off with paprika and I used 3 quarters of a pack of velveta cheese instead of the other!!! Delicious!!!

This is the best broccoli rice casserole I have found. I didnt use the onion (husband hates them) and used fresh broccoli. I chopped it up and blanched it for 30 seconds. I also used one can of fiesta cheddar soup and one cheese soup from Campbell's instead of the chicken one. I didn't have any on hand. I sprinkled french onions on top and covered . I cooked for 25 minutes then 5 minutes uncovered. Awesome. Just awesome.

Good comfort food!!  Changed it up a little to fit what I had on hand.  Omitted the butter and onion totally (don't like onions) and just mixed cooked white rice, fresh broccoli, soup, milk & cheese (Velveeta) in casserole dish and baked.  I also threw in some smoked turkey sausage that needed to be used up.  Yummy!  Perfect for an easy dinner and easy to adapt.

I wanted to make something different with broccoli and had a can of Cream of Chicken soup. I decided on this recipe based on the good reviews.  What a disappointment. It was so overdone and mushy and sorry, almost inedible. 30 minutes of baking on ingredients already done is too much.  I won't be making this again.

I've tried most of the other recipes for Broccoli Rice Casserole on this site, and this is the one that gets the best reviews from my family.  Always the biggest star on the table during the holidays.

It's a great side dish recipe, but since I have to be gluten free I can't use the Campbell's soup.  I make a homemade version of the condensed soup that is gluten free and it works just as well in this recipe.  The only thing I had to add was salt and pepper since the soup that I make has not added salt.  Just a minor change though and it turned out wonderfully.

I have made this recipe for years. Rather than use a skillet, I cook my broccoli as directed on the box/package. I also use minute rice and cook it as directed. No butter used at all.  Then I toss everything into the casserole dish and mix together.  I used dried chopped onion sprinkled into the mix and then pop it into the oven.  About 1/2 way through the baking I use a spoon to stir everything to get an even mix. I like to use a deeper dish rather than a shallow pan. This keeps the mixture creamier. I find it is dry when baked in a shallow dish. But that is just personal preference.  If you use a deeper dish be sure to stir the mixture so it heats all the way through.

This was easy and tasted good; however, it really didn't have anything special about it. I did like the ease of preparation though, and the ability to lighten it up calorie/fat wise.

I've been making a variation of this recipe for over 30 years.  Instead of Cheez Whiz, I use a can of cheddar cheese soup and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. Then, I top the casserole with breadcrumbs before baking.

Nothing against this particular recipe itself, I think my oven just HATE broccoli rice casserole. The last 2 times I've made it 2 different ways and it still ended up bland and too runny. Last time I also had a can of cream of mushroom, this time I only had the cream of chicken, I even left out the milk and it still ended badly. Maybe I'll try again when I live somewhere else w/ a different oven. I had even more than doubled the bake time. It just burned the edges and bottom. Never thickened the ingredients.

This dish was great! I don't like onions so I made it without. Instead of using cheese whiz I used velvetta. I served  with a side of buttery flaky biscuits and this was very filling ! I would suggest this to anyone.

I made several changes to this recipe and I give it a three because it gave me the general idea of what to do.  I think 1/2 cup of butter is WAY too much and I don't see the need for adding milk.  I also used cheddar cheese soup instead of the cheese whiz because I have never liked cheese whiz.  It turned out pretty awesome.  I do agree that it needs some kind of crunch -- I will be adding water chestnuts tonight when I make it again.  
I added: two cloves of garlic, more broccoli, I used brown rice instead of white and I also added in some shredded cheddar cheese!

This rating is based on a few changes. I used shredded cheddar cheese as one reviewer suggested.  And because I wasn't paying attention, I accidentally used a can of cream of celery soup instead of the chicken.  I used 2 cups of rice and added in some shredded chicken.  With these changes, I would probably make again.

My husband said "mmm, comfort food".  Took my time cooking the onions down so they were a nice golden color, added some chopped garlic in with the broccoli and used Cream of Mushroom soup and Velveeta as it's what I had on hand.

This was good. I tweaked the recipe to what I had on hand and added a few spices to it. It was a really good base recipe to start with. Since I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I can't judge this recipe. Instead of processed cheese whiz, I used a can of Campbells cheese soup. For the cream of chicken soup I used cream of celery. I also added 13 dashes of salt, and about 8 dashes of black pepper. What I made following this base recipe was excellant and I will be making it again, my way, using this as a base recipe.

Normally I use melted Velveeta when I do not have Cheez Wiz on hand, and I have also made this dish as a Chicken Broccoli Rice casserole. Everything was exactly the same but with 2 grilled and cubed chicken breasts added. It makes an excellent main dish when not a lot of fuss or a lot of clean up are wanted.  This recipe as is makes a great side dish alternative to most meats and is a family favorite.

I made this GFCF by making my own cream of chicken soup, using Daiya Cheese, Almond Milk and I also added diced chicken, olive oil, minced onion and minced garlic. I also used brown rice. The kids LOVED it and there were NO left-overs.

I wonder if I made it with grated cheddar and half a block of cream cheese and a can of Rotel-if it would add to the flavor many say is "bland". Definitely trying this recipe, with some additions, for our Thanksgiving get together.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving last year. Everyone in my house hates green bean casserole, so I decided to try this as an alternative. It was so good I also made it as a side dish at Christmas and Easter.  I use Cream of Celery Soup instead of Chicken, 1 cup of sour cream and a combination of cheddar and velveeta for the cheese.  After I pour in the casserole dish, I make a crunchy topping out of one (1) sleeve of crushed ritz crackers mixed with 1 stick of melted butter. My whole family loves this, even my picky 11 year old.  Great basic recipe that you can make your own!!! I will be making this again for the holidays this year.

perfect recipe with ingredients on hand! i added celery, before i realized my only cream soup was celery -- so ours had a big celery flavor, but we still loved (including pregnant lady and 15 month old).  i used a big bunch of fresh broccoli and a 8 oz chunk of velveeta -- came out wonderful with easy-toddler-feeding leftovers for the rest of the week.

I added a can of crm of mushroom soup, used 16oz jar of cheez whiz, 4cups rice, and added chicken and it made it a meal casserole, as opposed to a side dish.  It was pretty yummy.  Will probably make again.

One of the best Broccoli Casserole I have ever tasted.  The only problem I had was the rice wasn't fully cook.  I will just cook it longer next time.  Keeper!

This seemed much cheesier than the Casserole I was used to eating.  Everyone said it was fantastc.  I followed directions exactly and used some leftover jasmine rice I happened to have in the fridge.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it turned out well.  Everyone complimented me about the dish.  I omitted the butter & onion (just don't like), steamed the broccoli on the stove and used basmati rice cause I had that on hand.  But kept everything else the same.  I had to add some salt & pepper at the end cause it was kinda bland.  But the salt brought the flavors out and everyone liked it & asked me to make it next year.

Another person suggested using cream of mushroom and cream of chicken and two cups of sharp cheddar instead of the cheese wiz. It turned out amazing. I brought it to a family gathering and it was a hit! Thank you!

This is a great starter recipe.  I substitute about 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese for the processed cheese sauce.  Using real cheese, you'll need to up the milk too.  To easily make this a main course I add either cooked chopped ham or chicken.  I also add some garlic powder to add a little extra flavor.

It had an off putting taste. I think it was the soup considering I'm not a big meat eater. I would make this again but use cream of broccoli and cheese soup instead. Also I added extra salt before eating and added some pepper too since it was a little bland.

I love this recipe, but I change mine up a little. I also add a can of cream of mushroom soup and a can of Rotel. ( Make sure not to get the Hot if your not ready for the heat) it's a hit no matter the time of year made.

I'm so happy to find this recipe!  This Is the closest to the original Campbell Soup Back-of-Label recipe that I've made for decades and want to share with my DIL.  It's amazing to see what folks have done to the basic recipe.  Many thanks for saving it!!

I used 8 oz. velveeta instead of cheese whiz, doubled the amount of rice and only did 1/2 of a large onion.   I think I will use less cheese next time b/c it was too cheesy for me but if you like velveeta it would be great.

This recipe is not bad, but there is one serious mistake in it. I found that there was almost no rice in it. It took me a while to realize why. The recipe states "1 1/2 cups cooked regular long-grain white rice." I took that to mean exactly what it said: 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice. Apparently, it means 1 1/2 cups rice, cooked. That would be 4 1/2 cups of cooked rice. I did make a few modifications. I added the other can of soup, but I used the new cream of bacon, not cream of mushroom. I made my own cheese sauce and topped the casserole with cheddar cheese and a topping I made with part of the butter called for in the recipe and bread crumbs. The flavor is excellent, but I will definitely increase the rice next time. Someone should fix that error.

Instead of the processed cheese, I used Velvetta shredded cheese.  I also used non fat cream of chicken soup.  Very yummy

I added more broccoli, rice, & cheez whiz, some crushed red pepper, salt and pepper.  
Next time I will use “real “ cheese.

Delicious.  This is a great go to side dish.  With a little chicken or ground beef it's a full meal.

So I missed the part where it said cooked rice.  So the dish was ruined because of crunchy rice but it still tasted really good and I will be making it again.  I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom.  I added 3 chopped chicken thighs as well, seasoned with salt and pepper. I used shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of processed cheese.

I made this recipe on Christmas Day. It was a slight variation from my usual recipe as this one included rice. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make this more in the future.

Based on other comments I made a few changes; I added a can of chicken and added it while softening the onions in the butter, used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of mushroom, used 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese and 1 cup of Dubliner cheese (because I had it on hand), and I used however much rice I had cooked from one cup dry rice.  I topped the casserole with additional cheddar and Dubliner.  It filled a 9x13 pan.  I baked about 25 minutes and broiled a few minutes to brown the cheese.  It was delicious and turned out to be a very filling and easy meal.

Recipe came out fantastic! I added 2 1/2 cups of chicken and topped it with breadcrumbs for crunch. I also substituted the cheese the recipe used for shredded kolby jack cheese. YUM! Family is asking for me to make it again already!

I really liked this recipe. I made a few changes.
1. I used 1 cup of mild shredded cheddar
2. 1 can of cream of broccoli
3. 1 1/2 tsp of minced garlic
4. and topped the casserole with 1/2 sleeve of crushed ritz crackers. Will make again. Possibly will increase milk to 3/4 cup.

This dish is easy to make. I substituted cream of broccoli soup for the cream of chicken soup. Instead of Cheeze Whiz, I used 1 can of cheddar cheese soup and one cup of grated extra sharp cheddar cheese.  It was a delicious side dish.

Yum!! Didn't have Cheese Whiz on hand so used processed cheese slices instead and just fine. Recipe calls for 1 onion but seems like a lot so I only used 1/2 onion (1/4 would have been plenty too). To clarify, the rice amount called for is 1-1/2 cup of rice that's been cooked, not 1-1/2 of dry rice.

I was craving cheesy broccoli rice casserole and after reading the reviews I gave this one a try. Hit the spot and was easy! I gave 4 stars because I made some tweaks. I used 2.5 cups of shredded cheddar cheese instead of processed cheese. I also didn't want to pre-cook the rice and used raw rice. To make up for the raw rice I had to add more liquid so I used two cans of soup instead of one - you can choose any two,  I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of broccoli. Then I also mixed in about 8 oz of chicken broth. Then baked for 45-50 minutes. So good and easy to customize to your family!

You can use instant rice, and you don't have to precook anything, just mix it all together and cover it and bake it. That's how my mother in law does it and its perfect every time. Definitely florets instead of chopped. Oh, and use condensed milk instead. She taught me to ALWAYS have that on hand!

This was so good, even my 3 picky children all liked it!!!  I simplified the steps and combined the cheese whiz, cream of chicken soup, milk and 2 cups uncooked rice together and added in a can of chicken broth. I steamed the broccoli (used 2 bags instead of 1) in the microwave for a couple of minutes (don't know if this was necessary but wanted to make sure it was tender in the end) and then added it along with some shredded chicken to the soup mixture. I added a little shredded cheddar cheese (because we like ours cheesy) and a little salt, pepper and garlic powder for flavoring. Put it all in a casserole dish and sliced about 1/2 a stick of  butter and spread it out on top.  Baked in the oven covered for about 45 minutes and then took the foil off for the last 15 minutes.  Let it set for a while to cool- it will be very hot. Wonderful dish you can make ahead and then just pop in the oven for days you don't have much time, and if you add some meat it's a complete meal!

Creativity goes a long way with this recipe! I knew when I read the recipe that I would use real cheese instead of cheese whiz(yuck). I used a blend of white and sharp cheddar with a little colby as well. About a cup and a half. Also, I used my common sense to realize that 1/3 cup of milk was not gonna cook all that rice. Follow the directions on the can of soup (1 can of soup plus one can of water) If you're making the dish in a large casserole dish like I did, just add a little more rice and cheese to feed up to 8 people. I also had some roast chicken leftover so I added that as well and topped it off with some cheese. It was delicious. Entire meal in one dish.  *Be careful with your seasonings.*

Probably the best brocoli caserole I have had.  Made a few changes based off other comments. First I used velvet cheese instead of the cheese whiz. Used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup as well as the cream of chicken. And finally out my own personal preference used wild rice instead of white.  It was fantastic!!

Instead of processed cheese added 2 cups cheddar cheese and then put cheddar cheese and bread crumbs on top and my family LOVED it. So much they ask me to make it all the time now.

I haven't made this yet,  although I do plan on it as it looks and sounds delicious!  The only thing is that why would you have to bake it once you've done everything already on the stove and everything is already hot? Seems ridiculous to me.

I modified this a bit and used 8 oz of freshly shredded cheese and 1 lb of fresh broccoli. I also added a light dusting of bread crumbs to the top before baking. The dish turned out delicious but the amount of butter the recipe called for was way too much. Next time I'll probably use half as much butter. Just seeing the excess butter run off of the food on my plate was gross. I would also add salt and pepper to taste.

Turned out great. Used regular shredded cheese and next time not adding the milk which I don't think is necessary since it had plenty of sauce.

This recipe has now become a regular dish in my house! Even my picky 2 year old loved it! I add chicken and sneak in some spinach to make  sure my little dude gets enough protein and iron. I have also tried with frozen mixed vegetables when i did not have broccoli. it was alright but not as tasty as with the broccoli.

This is absolutely one of my favorite side dishes! I make it every Thanksgiving and my family looks forward to it every year.  I sautee onion and celery together and I add garlic salt and pepper and instead of the whole jar of cheez whiz I only use half of it.  I also add a small can of evaporated milk.  It's perfect! I also don't mix it all together.  In a casserole dish I put the rice in,  pat it down and just pour the sauce mixture on top and bake until bubbly.....it's absolutely delicious! :)

CHANGE THE RECIPE AND USE FRESH BROCCOLI!!This recipe is an altered version of a recipe my grandmother gave to me that was her most famous dish EVER.  I'm giving five stars to the POTENTIAL recipe it could be.   The problem with the way the recipe is on this website is that it uses cream of chicken soup and frozen broccoli.  For those of you who didn't give it five stars, if you want to push it to that level, you need to use cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken, exchange the large onion for a small one, add a small can of sliced mushrooms.  MOST IMPORTANTLY: Trash the frozen broccoli!  Use FRESH broccoli but DO NOT use the entire plant.  Cut off just the very edges of the florets, getting NO stem in it.  ... and I mean SHAVE it off and get as little stem as you can possibly get into the casserole.  Yes, you will have much waste, and you will need a couple of bunches of broccoli to get the job done, but I promise, it will change your life!  You can always dice and freeze the excess and use later, but for the super special holidays, you will want only the shavings of the florets.

I used about 4oz of shredded cheddar instead of process cheese and cream of mushroom soup .  To give it a bit of a bite add about 1/2 tsp or more of dry mustard and pinch of cayenne pepper.   You can skip the pepper  but definitely try the mustard.  I think  this could take 2 cups of  cooked rice  if you add little more milk .

This recipe is hands down the best broccoli casserole I've ever made. My whole family loves it and there are never any leftovers. It's so creamy and cheesy! I add about 2 cups of shredded cheddar cjeese into the ingredients and put crushed Ritz crackers over the top for a topping/crust. It's fabulous and my go-to side dish!!!

I love this basic recipe but as with many others I make a some changes. I use chicken broth to cook my rice. I use a can of cream of broccoli soup and a can of either cream of mushroom or cheddar cheese soup. I add large chunks of cooked chicken and portable mushrooms sliced  and sauteed in butter with only about a third of the onion. I use any kind of real cheese I have on hand from cheddar to colby  never processed cheese product.  Top off with panko bread crumbs in a little melted butter. With the addition of the chicken and mushrooms this becomes a main dish not just a side and we love it!

I only used half an onion and substituted the Cheese Whiz for Velveta cheese that I just cut into small pieces so it would melt fast. I also had to prepare it and then put it in the refrigerator until several hours later so I turned up the temp to 400 and left it in the oven until it started to boil which was longer than the original time.  It was a hit at Christmas dinner!!

Not my favorite. Cheese gave it a funny smell.  I used it for a catering job to feed 75 and the servings were more than adequate.  If you like cheese whiz you will probably like this. Was looking for a higher quality for our banquet.

This is a quick and easy recipe. I made some changes in that I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, per my daughter's recommendation. I used 3 bunches and steamed them a little before putting all ingredients together. I also omitted the Chez Whiz, and used 2 cups of sharp cheddar instead. Next time I will use the extra sharp cheddar for more flavor. I really good dish. I will definitely make it again.

My grandmother used to make this for Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas every year. Now that I've been and adult for awhile it's been passed on to me to make this. We use slightly less onion and don't use the milk. One of our favorite sides for holidays!

One of our favorite side dishes! I've made this several times and it turns out great. I use whatever cheese I have on hand (fresh grated, bagged etc) and add a little extra butter or milk if needed. Yum!!

I made this with a few changes.  I used frozen broccoli florets, real sharp cheddar cheese and cream of celery soup.  I followed the recipe directions.  I took it to a work party.  My husband wanted me to leave some but I assured him that there would be leftovers.  There weren't.  I got so many compliments on it.  It really is addicting.

I have made this twice. my husband really enjoyed as did I. I changed a few small things. 
1) I added a little more cheese 
2) I added fresh spinach 
3) I added chicken seasoning and a little garlic salt and pepper 
it gave it a little more flavor. this will definitely bring going in the keep pile.

This is a great starter recpie. I just modified a few things. I added chicken to make it a meal. Instead of cheese whiz I used cheddard cheese soup mixed with the cream of chicken soup. Added salt,pepper and garlic. I also put crushed cheese it on top for a crunchy topper! I also put real cheese in side as well. Over all amazing. My husband loves it!!

After 3 attempts over time I have finally made this perfect in my family's opinion.  I used 12 ounces of fresh broccoli chopped up pretty darn small.  I used 6 oz of shredded medium cheddar cheese and I used 2 cups of cooked rice.  The only deviation I made from the actual cooking of the recipe was to cover the pan after I put the broccoli in to help soften the broccoli, as we like it soft in this dish.

Absolutely no need for the canned soup, makes it way too saucy plus dilutes the cheese flavor. Leave out the soup and the recipe is delicious. Made it today for Christmas dinner, the family loved it, minus the soup.  PS, 2 T butter is more tha enough to saute the onion. Half a cup of butter is overkill. 4 stars due to the changes I had to make.

I remember my grandma making a version of this growing up and I loved it! My biggest problem was the rice/cheese sauce ratio. It was way too saucy. If I try to make a broccoli rice casserole again I would use this as a base recipe and at least double the rice so it's a thicker dish. Don't cut back on the onion; it needs the whole onion for flavor. I think some garlic would help boost the flavor as well.

This recipe is a good start.  I thought the flavor of the condensed soup was very overpowering (maybe I didn't cook it down enough??).  I don't like Cheez Whiz, so I substituted shredded Colby Jack (but I'm sure you can use whatever you have on hand).  I do plan on making this again because it keeps well and lasted me through the week, but I will add a little half/half to the condensed soup mixture to bring the flavor down a bit and possibly add some shredded rotisserie chicken...we'll see. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe with a few changes. I only used 1/2 a small onion. I used cream of chicken and broccoli cheese soup 
(Campbells) and I put sharp cheddar cheese on the top. This was delicious. I will definitely be making this again. Next time I may add a buttery crisp topping with crushed ritz crackers and melted butter. Thank you

I made this spur of the moment. My husband totally loved in the pan and not in the oven yet. I did not leave in the oven for the full 30 minutes I think it would have been dry. I will try on my kids. Definitely making again.

I tripled the rice, doubled the broccoli, added a pound of cooked chicken and only added about 2-3 extra ounces of chez whiz.  That cut down on the amount of not-so-good for you sauce, and added a lot more good-for-you food to this meal.  It was also enough to feed about 10 people! I used a couple tablespoons of dried onion rather than the fresh onion.  It was awesome, very creamy, cheesy...a real comfort meal.  Perfect for serving a crowd too!

I am only giving this recipe 4 stars because CheezWhiz is not an ingredient- it is a condiment. A really, really unhealthy condiment. We used a cheese base of butter, flour, milk, and shredded cheddar, then added the condensed chicken soup and more milk. We threw in the cooked chicken, thawed broccoli, and rice, then baked for 30 min. Came out great with minor modifications!

I wasn't expecting this recipe to be so good. I chose to try it because it looked very quick and easy and I didn't have much time. Changes? I substituted Cream of Mushroom soup for the Cream of Chicken because one of our guests was vegetarian, and to add a little texture, I added crushed croutons to the top of the casserole before baking. All in all, it was fantastic.

I made this on Christmas Day as an extra side.  I didn't have Cheese Whiz or Velveeta, but followed the instructions as written and added 2 1/2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese (instead of the Cheese Whiz or Velveeta).  It was excellent and was the first dish to be finshed. It will become a regular in our house and in the future I'll be sure to have the CW before making it!

This has become a family favorite during the holidays!  I use brown rice in my recipe, I think it has more flavor than white rice.  I also use mushroom soup instead of chicken soup.  I love the browned edges of this delicious side! I will continue to make this amazing dish!

Added chopped cooked turkey, substituted the white rice for brown, used real cheddar cheese so I also had to use another can of cream of chicken soup. Added 1 clove of garlic as well! Couldn't get enough to make it extra special I topped it off with cheddar cheese and some panko breadcrumbs to make an awesome crunchy topping!

VERY GOOD DISH!!! However I did make a few changes. I used half cream of mushroom(b/c I LOVE MUSHROOMS) and half a can of cream of chicken. I also cut the butter use in half to brown the onion(which I also cut in half). I let the butter cook almost completely out & used water to steam the broccoli. Baked it with shredded chedder on top. I'm sure I will cook this one again. Thanks for the recipe :)

I used velvetta instead of cheeze wiz. Also, if you are in a hurry, make regular rice while making the sauce (step two) and just put the rice in after you are done. It's just as good!
