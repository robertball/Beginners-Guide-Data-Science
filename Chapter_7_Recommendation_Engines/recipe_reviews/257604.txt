8.19.18  Never tasted anything quite like this muffin, and I’m still puzzled how the “cornbread” flavor kicks in…but it does.  That flavor may be subtle, but you still taste it.  If you’re looking for a cornbread muffin, this isn’t it, but if you want to step outside-the-box and try something new that has a hint of cornbread, this IS it.  My diet just would not allow 7 eggs for 12 muffins, so the only substitution I made was using Egg Beaters® which worked well. The texture is not cornbread-like, more like a cake, very light. Love the contrast between the spicy jalapeños and the tart cranberries, and there is just the right amount of sweetness.  Never cooked with coconut flour before, but I was able to buy just a cup from the bulk food sections at Sprouts to give this recipe a try, and I’m so glad I did.  Not sure how to describe this interesting muffin because it’s neither savory nor sweet, but it is SIMPLY GOOD!  Super moist and tender, a hit in this house.
