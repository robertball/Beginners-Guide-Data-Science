When I took this out of the oven, my 11 year old turned up her nose at it, but after trying it, she went back for seconds! It was very tasty, and I even forgot to put in the oregano, which I definitely will do next time. It took the full 15 minutes to bake. Next time I won't bother inverting the fritatta, I'll just serve it from the pan to save plates, but it did look nice on the plate if you want to be less casual. I got this recipe from cooknik, and served it with the roasted potatoes and winter fruit salad as suggested and it was a perfect sunday night meal.

Delicious combination, I substituted drained canned spinach and since I did not have goat cheese used swiss, cheddar, and parmesean.  Made a wonderful late night meal.

This was very yummy - even as leftovers.  It isn't as spinachy as the picture - the recipe calls for only 1/2 of a 10 ounce box of spinach.  The goat cheese made it nice and creamy.  Give it some time.  I think mine took more than 15 minutes.  This will definitely be added to the rotation!

This was easy and good.  I used feta instead of goat cheese.  Since I do not have an oven safe skillet, I fried the tomatoes and garlic, transferred to a quiche disk and poured the egg/spinach mixture over it.  Baking time was approximately double.

I really liked this, but was too much spinach for fiance's taste. Next time, I will cut back on the spinach and maybe add more egg. The flavor was delicious.

This is my go-to for 'breakfast club', I just double the recipe. The last time I made it, I diced the tomatoes and used a used a cupcake pan to make individual servings. I put a bit of the sauteed tomato/garlic in the bottom of each well, then filled to almost the top with the egg mixture and baked for about 15 minutes. Gone in 60 seconds!

delicious and simple.  I used a goat gouda from Trader Joe's that really made the dish special.

This recipe was great.  I cooked the frittata about 5 minutes longer than listed.

This recipe is great an alternative to meat dishes. I omitted the salt, it did not need it and added more spinach. Great main dish. Definetly try this one.

Good recipe. I added some bell pepper and onion to this. I didn't have any goat cheese, so I just used parmesan. Also, in place of the frozen spinach, I used some fresh and it turned out great. Mine took longer to bake, more like 17-18 minutes, but it was probably due to the variations I made on the recipe. Really easy and tasty!

This was so fast! I made the frittata in about 20 minutes, nice and easy for a super busy night. I used feta cheese, which made it nice and creamy. I completely forgot the Parmesan cheese, and it still tasted good, but the Parmesan would have given it a nice touch. husband said it was "all right."

I thought this was a little too bland.  I should have added some chopped onion.
