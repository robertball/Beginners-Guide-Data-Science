We have eaten very extravagantly this weekend & I thought this light, healthy dessert would be refreshing & it was. I used 3 small mangoes & only half a banana but I think I could have added the rest of the banana w/ good success. I'm pretty sure that this is not a recipe to use up those overripe bananas in...I think that would make the banana flavor predominant. I used vanilla yogurt but the finished product still seemed to be missing something so I added a tsp. or so of dried ginger. I served this in vintage boopie glasses & garnished w/ chopped candied ginger & a tiny sprig of mint. The presentation of it helped this simple dessert achieve a more elegant stature.

I loved it! Much better when frozen. I made it because I love mangos, and will make again because it tasted so great!

I can't eat dairy, so I used a package of soft Mori-Nu silken tofu, and blended it with a package of frozen mango and 2 bananas. Added a bit of cinnamon and it was done. Sweet enough and very good.

I think coconut(extract) brings a nice balance to the mango and banana(which can be over powering)...Plus 1packet of Splenda gives it the sweetness that i like :0(

Excellent flavor and healthy dessert! I think it tastes even better if kept in the freezer for a couple of hours. Thanks Robyn!

This is NOT a smoothie.  If you let this rest for 3 hours, it will be an awesome pudding/mousse concoction.  I used a 6 oz package of low fat vanilla yogurt, and it was great!

The strong flavor & texture of a banana in this  recipe complete overpowers the wonderful taste of the Mangos. Very disappointing!

Loved this recipe, as a smoothie and frozen. Used coconut extract as a change to vanilla as one user suggested. Great, light dessert - thanks!

I made this recipe as written to try it, but I think I would add some of the suggestions of other reviewers to improve it the next time. Like some others, mine was more of a smoothie, definitely not mousse-like; maybe freezing it would have given it a thicker consistency.  The one banana was more than enough; its flavor was more apparent than the mangos. While I did like the flavor, I think it would have helped with some of the ingredients other reviewers suggested, like ginger or cinnamon.  With a bit of modification of the original recipe, I would make it again.

It was watery.  Both mangos and bananas vary in size.  The consistency might have been better if I had used larger fruit.
