I have been making this biscotti for 6 years. I give it away to family and friends at Christmas time. I just finished making a recipe for 40 cookies last night. I went to my local resaurant to get a quick dinner and mentioned that I had been baking all day and I did not feel like making dinner. I told them I make biscotti and cookies. The owner asked if I sell the biscotti and I told her no, I give it away to family and friends. She asked me to bring some in today and if shel liked it she want me to make her some for an up coming party. She called me back about 15 minutes and said she would pay me $50.00 if I made her two dozen. I gladly accepted her proposel and I will have them done tomorrow. Just goes to show this is an excellent recipe. By the way she is Italian from Italy. Everyone should be so lucky to make and share this recipe with everyone! Bon Apetit!

There is something wrong with this recipe.  I'm no biscotti idiot as I've made many times before, however, this recipe is much too dry to even form a loaf.  I think butter was left out !!

Good recipe for those of us trying to eat healthy. Note that this recipe will be dry unless you add 2 tablespoos not teaspoons of whiskey, flavoring or another liquid.

I really like these as coffee dunkers!!
Before making them, I read the reviews and changed the recipe by melting one cup of the choc.chips and stirring them in with the egg mixture,and I melted 1/4 cup  
of butter and stirred this into the same mixture. I also toasted the almonds.
Also, I spread half of the biscotti with
melted chocolate (only one end) and half of those I sprinkled with toasted finely chopped almonds.   I left the rest plain 
and have been dunking these in my coffee.
I plan to take them to relatives we are staying with over Thanksgiving,, we can 
have them with coffee on Friday,,,if there are any left to take!  Next time I will try to make them a little longer and wider.  However, they break easily, so maybe I will add more butter and more melted chocolate to make them even more rich and chocolaty, not so crisp.  I love experimenting,,,

Loved these! This was my first time making biscotti...everyone loved this and I was quite impressed. I substituted a tsp almond extract for the whisky. The dough may seem to dry at first...just make sure your hands are wet and really just mold and form the dough into a log. It may take time..almost like you are sculpting the form. It will quickly become moist. Also, I used a very sharp knife for cutting. Sawing didn't work for me...it was breaking the cookies and making a mess. Just a quick cut straigt down w/ a sharp knife worked great.

Made Biscotti for the first time using this recipe and they turned out perfect! I left out the chocolate chips and added apricot flavored brandy in place of the whiskey.  I've seen this recipe referred to as to dry several times... it does say to wet your hands before you work with dough to shape it.. that worked for me.  And i always use a bit more extract vanilla and in this case almond when i cook.  My Biscotti are great (i ate WAY to many yesterday)  and THANK YOU for posting this great recipe!

This made a wonderful crunchy biscotti that I plan to use when my family comes for the holidays. I didn't have whiskey so I added another egg for the extra moisture. I also had sliced almonds rather than whole ones. I toasted the sliced almonds, omitted the step using the food processor, and just added all the sliced almonds to the dry ingredients. With all the almonds and chocolate chips, the biscotti look as good as they taste. I got about 50 slices from the recipe.

The end result of these was excellent.  However, I added 3 or 4 tablespoons of water to the dough to get it together.  I don't carry whiskey at my house either, so I left it out.  The only other minor change I made was a substitution of dried cranberries for the chocolate chips.  Consequently, I didn't have any problems with the chocolate smearing, and the cookies were beautiful in the end.  They taste delicious, and I wish I could give it another 1/2 star because this is a pretty authentic recipe.

I thought this recipe was great except I just needed to add about 1/4 cup water for it not to be so dry. It went over great and now I am making for Christmas presents.

These turned out delicious.  I added 1/4 cup of butter after noticing many other recipes also included oil or butter and had no problem with it being crumbly or too dry to work with. Subbed butterscotch schnapps for the whiskey.     After cooling I dipped the ends in melted chocolate and coated in chopped almonds. Tasted and looked great!

I used Amaretto instead of whiskey and took the suggestion to add 1 teaspoon almond extract in addition to the vanilla. For a little variety, I used white chocolate chips. These biscotti came out great! The dough was easy to handle, with wet hands, and the balance of white chocolate with almonds was perfect. I bought already slivered & toasted almonds at Trader Joe's, which eliminated step 1, making this recipe easy to do. Also, rather than get the food processor dirty, I just chopped the nuts myself and whisked the dry ingredients together---very easy.

They practically melted in my mouth!! I made some changes, added 1/2 cup water (per other's suggestions), used rum instead of whiskey and added 1/4 whole flaxseed.  These are great and I will definitely make again!

SOOO Good!  I do, however, have some tips for newbies (I myself was one when trying this recipe)  1. Have faith that the biscotti will harden when it cools... it also cuts better when cool. 2. Like the other suggestions, chop half the chocolate chips up in food processor with half the almonds... it gives nice color!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome recipe!  The dough was a little difficult to work with but the final result was worth it.  I wasn't a big fan of biscotti until I made this.

This is a very good recipe. I used a combination of whole almonds and sliced almonds. I also added almond extract in addition to the vanilla and whiskey the recipe calls for. I found that just by keeping my hands wet, I could get the dough to hold together, although it is a dry dough. 
I think these are delicious biscotti...and super easy to make!

Great biscotti!  I did add a couple of tablespoons of water other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and the resulting biscotti has an excellent texture and taste.

This was great.  I followed suggestions and added some almond extract.  Other than that, it was super easy.  Just wet your hands when "rolling" it out and it won't be too dry.  Much much better than store bought.  Time consuming, but very easy too.  Hold up really well dunked in your favorite hot drink.

I used this recipe for my first biscotti attempt and I was extremely pleased.  The only changes I made were to omit the chocolate chips; I had whole dry roasted almonds and I chopped them til I had about 1 1/2 cups; and I don't have any whiskey so I used Bailey's Irish Creme.  YUM!  My boyfriend and I are very excited to try these w/ our coffee tomorrow morning!

BISCOTTI FAIL.  I followed the advice of the people below and they all said to add more water because dough was not wet enough.  The biscotti still turns out with imperfections.    Find another recipe because I doubt you want to waste the money and time I did tonight.

I dunno about this one. I had to blanch the almonds, then toast them and then start making this. Then, it was a super dry "dough" (can I even call it that?) that was hard to get to stick together - I even added an extra 1T of canola oil and liberally wet it with my hands and it was still problematic. Then when I pulled it out after baking round #1, sure enough it pretty much crumbled everywhere and ultimatel ended up more like a pile of crumbs than biscotti. The taste is good - but really, isn't this just a dried out chocolate chip cookie? - which is why I gave 2 stars, but the texture needs help, and for the amount of time this took I could have walked 3 mi. to the grocery store and bought some decent biscotti. For me, the effort was not worth the result; homemade biscotti isn't any better than what you'd get at a local coffee shop. I won't be making this again.

Overall a good recipie, but dry and dificult to work with. Adding 6 tlbs of butter made a world of difference in managing the dough and making the cookies easier to slice (not so crumbly!)  I also highly recommend using parchment paper instead of foil!

This was a big hit with my family & friends who tried it by itself and with coffee for dunking.  I will definitely make it again, only this time, I will roll it out in 4" and slice diagnally for longer biscotti. Loved it!

I made biscotti using this recipe two days in a row.  At my first trial (and it's my first time ever to make any biscotti), I pretty much followed the recipe except that I left out the almonds as I didn't have any and used orange vodka instead of whisky.  The dough came out really dry even as I kept wetting my hands.  The biscotti came out tasting alright but didn't look that great.  Also, I found that there were way too many chocoloate chips.

Determined to make some better biscotti, I adjusted the recipe by:
- using 3 eggs instead of 2
- cutting the amount of choc chips in half
- using sliced almonds
- adding some orange zest

The end result is a batch of much better looking biscotti with just the right amount of sweetness.  I still find that it doesn't have the "smooth" look as most of the store-available biscotti.  I think it's because there's no butter/oil used at all.  However, I think it's a reasonable tradeoff of keeping this as a healthy snack.

There were way too many almonds and chocolate chips, and not nearly enough "binder" to hold it together. It was impossible to slice without crumbling, was VERY dry and almost impossible to shape into a loaf...we had to add quite a bit more moisture.  / We used Splenda in place of sugar.  Perhaps that affected the texture?  Not sure...but I can't imagine anyone rating this more than 2 stars!

If you have never made Biscotti, DON'T try this recipe!  2 Cups of choc chips way too much!  My cookies do not look like the picture!  Tasty but ugly! haha  Recommend try a basic biscotti before trying this recipe.

I'm no biscotti master, but this recipe was definitely missing an ingredient!  The dough was so dry you couldn't form it into anything... I added butter to compensate. Would not recommend this recipe for novice biscotti makers.

This was an easy recipe to follow.  I substituted almaretto for the whiskey and the flavour comes through nicely.  I did find it a bit more difficult to work with as it's drier but still very tasty in the end.

This was the first biscotti I ever made, so good! I thought I'd have trouble with the dry dough, there being no oil. But all you really need to do is mix it and the liquid eventually moistens up the whole batter. Had no whisky in the house, substituted brandy extract. Also added in 2T orange rind, and juice of a fresh orange. Still turned out great.

Dough was difficult to work with -- too dry, which made for a very rustic-looking cookie.  Taste was very good however, and I drizzled white chocolate on the biscotti.

Excellent! Being Italian, I know my biscotti. I lost my grandmothers recipe and was looking for something similar to hers. This was very flavorful. I did a few variations on this recipe but the original does stand alone. Since I like a longer cookie, I made 2 large, wide loaves.

I've made this recipe several times and my husband and co-workers think it's the best they have had.  It's certainly better than store-bought biscotti.

Outstanding.  Especially if you like chocolate.  There's a lot of it.  Used sliced almond, toasted, then coarsely chopped half of them.  First bake was too brown almost crisp.  Should lower temp or shorten bake time.

The mixture was really dry so I added a bit of milk and that worked. I also dipped them in melted chocolate and toffee bits after they cooled. They turned out delish!

This was pretty good, flavor-wise. I did not have whisky, so I subbed 1 tablespoon almond extract  and added an extra small egg. This dough was very hard to work with, way too dry. I added tiny bits of water as I combined liquid to dry just until it was pulled together. Wet hands were a must, but it made the dough sticky. Also reduced chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups because 2 seemed too much, and even reduced as well as being a chocoholic, there was way too much chocolate. 1 cup probably sufficient. This is also a dense biscotti, did not absorb coffee quickly when dunking. Because flavor was good, will try again, but try to adjust a bit for lighter texture.

This was my first time making biscotti and it was yummy. I added two tablespoons vanilla instead of whiskey (since I didn't have any). We also had a bag of mixed nuts (brazil nuts, hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts) that I used instead. A great recipe!

This recipe is so yummy!! I've made lots and lots of biscotti, and what I've read is the biscotti is more authentic when no oil/butter is used. I had about a cup + of ground almonds that also I added whiskey to that I had in the fridge marinating for whiskey balls, but decited not to make. So I used the ground whiskey infused almonds, about 2 Tbs of water, and everything eles the same. So so good!!!! Oh ya, I used white choc chips instead of regular. Thx so much!!

Overall a good recipe.  I omitted the whiskey (don't have it on hand) and added 1 tsp almond extract.  Next time I will use parchment paper instead of foil.  During the first bake, the bottoms got too browned and i had to toss a fourth of each loaf.  With some minor adjustments, this will be a recipe I make often.

I love this recipe.  Had to alter it a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips, 1 1/2 cups slivered almonds, 1/2 cup sunflowers seeds. Also, instead of 2 Tbsp of whiskey I used 1 tsp almond extract and 1 1/2 Tbsp water.  The dough looked very dry and I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  But it turned out great!

I have made biscotti many times before, but have never made a chocolate variety. I tried this recipe and discovered that while the resulting cookies ARE very tasty, they have a rough appearance (I think the dough is too dry) and are not suitable for gift presentation. The other problem is that even when they cool after the first baking for the prescribed time, the chocolate chips are too melted and smear across the cookie surface as they are cut. The really dry dough makes for a craggy surface during the first baking, and the result is so crumbly, that one must cut the cookies too thickly for an attractive-looking cookie. To "punch up" the flavor, I added a tablespoon of fresh orange zest - they were very delicious.

My first try at biscotti and it turned out excellent.  I also added another egg and then it seemed to have enough moisture to hold together.  I also chopped all the almonds, instead of leaving some of them whole.  I got about 40 pieces because I like my logs a little larger.  Biscotti is full of flavor and not hard as a brick.

The dough seemed very dry. After these came out of the oven and cooled, they fell apart while cutting them. I just about needed a saw as they were so hard and crumbly. I just don't see how you can "cut" these nicely without ruining them. I suggest chopping up ALL the almonds because trying to saw through whole almonds is a pain. They taste good but don't look good enough to bring to a party or give as a gift.

This Biscotti was fabulous.  I had never made Biscotti before and was nervous as I brought it to a dinner party.  People were fighting over the leftovers to bring home.  They really were wonderful.  I even froze some and served at another dinner and they were still great.  I made two logs instead of 4 so the pieces were bigger and there was plenty.  I also used peach Shchapps as I didn't have whiskey and it was still great. Thanks
