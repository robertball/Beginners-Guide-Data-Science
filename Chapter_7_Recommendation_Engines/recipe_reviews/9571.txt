Wow, truly an amazing, authentic shortbread recipe.  It's very buttery, moist, dense and MELT-IN-YOUR-MOUTH delicious.  I agree w/ the other reviewers by needing a bit more sugar, so I added 1 extra tablespoon white sugar and dusted it with powder sugar immediately out of the oven.  (No need for sugar on top b4 baking) I also added 1 tablespoon milk since it was a bit dry and made the dough nice n' moist.  I've also used almond extract instead of vanilla the second time  and it was VERY good. I cut mine into 1" x 2" inch mini bars and have it with a hot cup of English Breakfast tea in the morning or when I have company and it's HEAVENLY.  Keep it in an airtight container and it tastes just like the first day.

What a hit! Thanks Kay!

Having said that - I have made the following modifications with great results: 

4 tablespoons white sugar instead of 2 (not quite sweet enough for us the first time I made this recipe) Once pressed into baking dish/pan and before I put it in the oven, I sprinkle with about a tablespoon of white sugar so that it makes a wonderful sweet-crunchy top on the shortbread!

We have Myer Lemons growing in the yard here in Florida so I have also now come up with a lemon shortbread version of this recipe:

Add the juice of half a medium lemon and two teaspoons of grated lemon peel and toss in an extra tablespoon or so of flour to compensate for wetness of the lemon juice - we love this version, I have made this lemon version two times now!

I made 2 batches of this recipe, one hand mixed, and one using my KitchenAid mixer. The hand mixed one came out the way it is supposed to be, in a soft dough form, and it baked out nice and crispy. The other one came out nicely done too, but the dough was too runny, sort of batter-like. I think hand mixing is the way to go. Delicious.

These were very tasty but only after I made a couple of modifications (as suggested by other reviewers).  When I followed the recipe exactly, the shortbread came out terribly dry and not sweet enough for my tastes.  So I added 1/4 cup  more confectioner's sugar, and 1/4 cup milk to soften the shortbread.  With those modifications, it was delicious!  Thank you for a simple, yummy recipe.

I came on here to find a shortbread recipe because my mother told me to take shortbread dough, make two balls, wrap & freeze it, and then take 1/2 grate it, sprinkle on your baking dish (I  use a pizza pan), lightly spoon your favorite jelly on it, take the other 1/2 and grate that on top. Bake @ 350 for 20-25 minutes.  
This is a great base for tarts!  Cream chz & fruit. 
Tomorrow I'll be making this with a 3x berry filling, fingers crossed.

For the love of GOD, don't melt the butter... make sure it's softened, NOT MELTED... mine didn't bake up right but I'm still giving it five stars because the taste is so wonderful, even if you ruin the batter!  Will make again, and next time I'll follow the instructions!

My first time making shortbread and this turned out great! Taking others' advice I added extra sugar and a bit of milk to soften (actually, I added cream). Also added a touch of almond extract. My husband is Scottish and he said these are nearly perfect. ;-)

Absolutely the best shortbread hands down.  Iv'e made it for birthday parties and the kids love it.  Its not too sweet like most cookies and so much more can be added.  I cut the dough in two and made them into rolls.  You can roll them in sliced almonds or poppyseeds, crushed peppermints for the holidays, then slice them and place them onto the cookie trays for cooking.  Fantastic!

Wowee!!! These are waaaaay too good, and I could get very fat on them. I usually add 1/4 cup more powdered sugar per batch and only use 1 TBSP granulated on top. I've made it both ways and people said it wasn't sweet enough as is. Also, I followed someone else's suggestion on here. I made a batch and rolled the dough into two balls, then froze them. Grate one ball into the bottom of your cake pan, spoon with jam (I used blackberry) and then grate the other ball on top. Fantastic!! Only, don't bake as long in that version, 25 - 30 minute tops. Thanks for a keeper!!

FANTASTIC!  This is such an easy recipe... great for kids who want to get their hands dirty.  And the result is decadent authentic shortbread.  I will not have to spend my money on Walker's anymore to get a taste of real buttery shortbread.  
The first time I made it I used the round cake pan as suggested.  That was a disaster, at least for me.  The triangles fell apart on the cooling rack.  The next time I used a square brownie pan and it worked great.  It's also easier for me to cut into squares.  One more tip -- you absolutely must cut the shortbread while it is still hot when it 'cuts like butter' as they say.  Otherwise it is simply impossible to cut the shortbread after it has cooled off, unless you just want to have one really big piece of shortbread. ;-)

First time making shortbread, I used 3/4 cup powdered sugar and 1 tbsp milk.  I underbaked these a bit in a 8x8 glass pan and they came out a little to dense on the inside and didn't crumble like the outside did.  They were a light golden brown and maybe waiting a few more minutes could have made the difference.

This is a fantastic recipe--they're so delicate and delicious.  I actually roll out the dough and use cutters with it.  I've shaped them into "fingers", dipped them in caramel and chocolate and made homemade Twix bars.  They were amazing.

Easy & delicious! This has become a Christmas tradition.  It always come out perfectly, I am not sure if it's the recipe or the shortbread pan I have, but it seems foolproof.    It's important to cut it right away while it is still hot, otherwise it gets brittle and the cuts will be jagged.  I flip it right onto a firm cutting board and cut it immediately then transfer the slices to a cooling rack. I sprinkle it with red and green colored sugar before baking. I always use my kitchenaid mixer and have never had a problem.  The dough looks like pie crust dough does before you add water, very crumbly, I then press it firmly into my shortbread pan, and I have never had a problem.

For anyone finding this recipe "crumbly and hard to manage" you're not mixing the butter and sugar enough.  Mix, mix, mix - a lesson my mother taught me long ago.  This recipe is delicious!  I used an 8x8" pan as I wanted them thicker than the 9x9" pie plate or pan would have been.  I never made any changes except to leave off the sugar on the top of the cookie which I felt was unnecessary. This is definitly a keeper!

These are very very good. I really mixed my butter & sugar well as another reviewer suggested and had no trouble with dryness. I did add the extra 1/4 cup of pwred sugar...but I'm not sure it really needed it. I think it may take away from the buttery taste. I divided the recipe into two cake pans and my cookies were a little more crisp, how I like them. Remember mixing well may be the secret.  Also start with your butter at room temp.  Thanks

I mucked this up and used caster suger instead of confectioner's suger by mistake. I didn't want to waste the ingredients, yet when I mixed it all up, the dough wouldn't come together. So I added about 1/2 tin of condensed milk, which worked perfectly. Rolled it out and cut it into star shapes, and they made the most delicious cookies I've had in a while! All the taste of shortbread, yet nice and moist and chewy!
Sorry - This is probably one of the most unhelpful reviews, yet if anyone else makes the same mistake, they should give it a go! I know I'll be making this 'mistake' again.

I wish I could give this 10 stars.... This is the absolute best... I've searched and tried them all, but this is the winner hands down.  Easy to make and people just RAVE RAVE about it.  It makes a great gift.  I put coarse sugar on top and it's just beautiful.  If you're a shortbread lover in search of the perfect recipe.  Stop here, you've found it...
Easy to make and mouthwatering....

I have made these cookies tons of times and I have used many different flavors of extracts, turned them into thumbprint cookies and filled them with different jams and preserves, etc. and they are always delicious. I always mix them by hand and they are quick and easy! This is my go to shortbread recipe for sure!

I added more sugar like other reviewers said. I added part milk and part cream as well, and split the extract in half, part vanilla and part coconut. It turned out great! I'm definitely going to make this again, probably putting it with some preserves this time.

hmm. I wasn't too "head over heels" for this one. Although it cut perfectly, and didn't crumble a bit, it was rather heavy--condensed. Surprisingly, this was the first recipe I'd followed to a T on here! Not sweet enough either, but I should of known that with the amount of salt it called for, hehe.

I have made this shortbread several times now and it turns out great every time!! I have made this around the holidays and sprinkled it with red and green sugar.  I shipped it to family, and they have requested that I make it again.

Just what I was craving! Rich and buttery, not too sweet.  For those complaining it isn't sweet enough, true shortbread isn't supposed to be very sweet.  I thought this recipe was perfect and the confectioners sugar makes it melt in your mouth!

This has an excellent texture, very flaky and buttery and crisp!  I give it 4 stars only because it was not sweet enough for our family.  I added a total of 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and took another reviewer's advice and divided the dough into 2 sections and made "logs".  I then rolled the logs in various things - green and red sugar, Christmas sprinkles, and one with Heath Bites. I cut logs into 1.5" circles, then baked on parchment lined cookie sheet.  15 minutes at 350.  Spectacular with these modifications!

Made this recipe last year at Christmas--loved it.  Per other reviewers, I did add an extra 1/4 C powdered sugar to the batter (also used the full 2T of sugar on the top).  Highly recommended.

These were wonderful, tasted even better the next day. I baked in a square glass pan, flipped out the shortbread and cut into small squares, then cooled.

I rolled out the dough and cut out cookies. It made about 50 heart shaped 2-inch cookies that baked for 14  minutes. They came out light, crispy, held their shape, and are delicious! I used high quality salted butter so I did not add any additional salt.

I have a lot of really pretty Christmas cookie stamps and I've been looking for a recipe to use them with.  This worked great.  Instead of baking one large round, I rolled pieces of dough into balls and then pressed down with the stamps.  They held the pattern perfectly and turned out beautifully.  And because of the powdered sugar, they were melt in your mouth soft and delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Only reason I did not give this a 5 rating is because it really does not need baking powder.   Have many many different recipes for shortbread and each gives a slightly different texture.   The texture of this is perfect and please only SOFTEN the butter because if you melt it you will be disappointed.

I'm not a huge fan of shortbread, but my husband and daughter gave this recipe an enthusiastic five stars.
A very easy recipe, and it had a lovely texture.  This seems like it could be a good base for a lot of desserts, actually.

Great shortbread cookie recipe and SO easy!  I added a tablespoon of milk and used 2 tablespoons of vanilla (love vanilla lol) and it was awesome!  I like it even better after it's cooled for a while.

I read reviews and substituted 1/4tsp almond extract, the remaining 3/4 tsp vanilla.  Next time I'll follow the recipe, the texture was fantastic.  I baked it in a 9x9 pan since I didn't want the wedge shape, came out great.  I will be making this again and again, the family loved it.

Excellent recipe! I dipped the ends with chocolate and they were a hit with everyone!

Edited: I've used this recipe for many years and discovered the following modifications for my preference. Cream softened butter and sugar until incorporated before adding other ingredients. I used 1/2 teaspoon salt for more flavors. Don't over mix. Press the dough into a 9x9 square pan. Bake at 300F for 40 mins or until golden brown. Using low heat and longer baking time dries out the dough to get the sandy texture that I like in my shortbread. I find that the dough is under cooked when baking at 350F until golden brown and that gives it a dense doughy texture in the middle. It is essential to use 2 tablespoons of sugar or the shortbread tastes bland.

The shortbread was good, but I won't say it was great.  Next time, I'll add a little more sugar, 1/4 cup.

This recipe turned out fabulous.. I had tried some other recipes on this site for shortbread that turned out terrible. With this one, I did make some minor changes and I loved the results. I used brown sugar instead of white, and only 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I also added a dab of milk to moisten the dough. I didn't use round, but a regular rectangle non-stick cake pan. I wanted to cut out cookie squares, so it worked out wonderfully. I added almond slivers, halved cherries for each little square, and powdered sugar on top. Sooooo yummy! thank you...

These were so incredible, I've never found a shortbread recipe that tastes like the expensive ones you buy, but these are it, thanks Kay!  Instead of wedges I did it in a square pan and cut into bars, they were amazing!

I have baked this recipe about 8 times now. This is such a fine recipe!  Easy and Delicious!  I do sprinkle some of the short bread cookies with powdered sugar as soon as they come out of the oven.  It makes for a sand tart like cookie, very delicious.  Very fine during holiday time with mulled hot cider.  THANKYOU!

I made three batches, each topped with either jam or nutella and they were delicious! A little more crumbly than I was looking for (the apricot ones fell apart a bit) but spot on otherwise.

Pop and Bill liked this one a lot. It was just OK to me.  I added chopped pecans and 1/4 C powdered sugar and 1/4 C milk.  Next time try it rolled into a log and cut into cookies instead of pressed into a pan.

I followed this recipe to the tee with the exception of adding 2 TBS additional sugar based on reviews. I also refrigerated the dough for 24 hours (mostly because I had to attend to a fussy baby). The next day I rolled the dough out and used cookie cutters (smaller cutters work better). They are delicious, crumbily, flakey goodness. Gonna have to hide them from DH :)

great i added the extra powered sugar and also some almond extract as recommended by others. I just formed my shortbread in the 9 in pan and baked it on a cookie sheet. To facilitate this process i placed a large piece of parchment paper in the 9 in pan, formed the dough then lifted it out, finessed the edges and baked. Really easy process and really easy clean up.

This is just an incredible recipe! I told my sister-in-law, "I think I finally found the shortbread cookie recipe that is even tastier than Panera's!" YUM! I made it in a glass 9x9 pan and they came out perfect. Then, a few days later I tried using a cookie press. I think I may have to add more flour to the dough for the press (or chill it) but both came out delicious. My husband gobbled them up pretty quickly. Thanks, Kay for sharing this one. It's a keeper!

This recipe was wonderful! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the white sugar... I was also generous with the 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar.  I shaped the dough into one inch balls and flatted slightly with two fingers, then sprinkled red and green sugar on either side. I then baked for 10 minutes... They were wonderful!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!  Also, if anyone is up in the air between Kay's shortbread and the other highly rated shortbread recipe on this website... Kay's is hands down the best.

Delicious! Crumbly and not too sweet, which is authentic. Can be sweetened more if you like. Could be used for a lot of variations - I look forward to making a lavender version!

Just as shortbread should be.  I followed recipe except I did not have vanilla extract and used lemon extract instead.  I must say I think I like it better.

Very, very good. Followed other recommendations and made sure the dough was well mixed. Added 3/4 cup powdered sugar (in lieu of 1/2 cup). Otherwise, followed the directions. Made a very simple, very tasty, flakey shortbread. Great with tea or coffee. Thanks for a delicious recipe.

This was my first time making shortbread so the disappointing results may be my fault.  I wasn't sure how to mix the butter in so I first tried to cut it in with a fork (kind of like a pie crust).  Then I gave up and mixed it with my fingers and that worked fairly well.  I doubled the recipe and pressed the dough into a rectangle and cut it into bars. I did get 35 bars that were about 1x3 inches and about 1/2 inch thick.  I baked for 20 minutes and that was just enough.  I did forget to add the white sugar to the top and I definitely missed it.  This was only my first attempt so I will definitely try again sometime.

I agree with Kayla, who noted how simple this recipe and its ingredients are.  It is a great sweet-tooth fix when you don't have any special ingredients in the house.  You could easily top it with some berries or cooked apples and whipped cream for a fancier dessert.  But in our house, it went quickly just cut into plain wedges.  We will be doing this again!

This gets 5 stars because it was super easy to make, and I ate the whole thing up like a fiend.  My husband ate half of one, declaring them too rich for his blood.  Cook at your own risk. I used a touch more sugar than called for.   I've only had out of the box shortbread before and they were blown away by these.  I cooked mine in a cast iron pan.  Fantastic.

These were deliciously light and buttery. I chilled the dough and hand-rolled these into cookies. I substituted about 3 tbsp of flour for cornflour, and added green tea powder (matcha) for a Green Tea Shortbread. I also dusted abit of green tea powder on it before baking.It's a gift for my Mom, and I know she'll love it! Thank you (:

Very good.  I followed the recipe exactly. These are not very sweet at all, but melt in your mouth ( isn't that what shortbread is all about?).  The other reviewer is right - MIX,MIX,MIX. It will finally all come together.

An excellent, rich and heavy shortbread.  I added 1 tablespoon of cornflour to add richness as well as a few drops of almond essence for a more nutty flavour.  I baked it in a rectangular pan and cut squares.  It was a huge hit!

oh my goodness!  when reading this recipe i really didn't get how it was going to work,having never made shortbread before... well, mine just got finished and a little tiny bit stuck to the pan (just a bit, nothing serious) so i popped it into my mouth... it is the best thing i have ever eaten!  practically melts in your mouth!  i will make this again and again (maybe even another batch today, i might eat this one before the family gets home!)

I followed the recipe as shown with just a couple changes. In addition to the teas vanilla, I added a 1/4 teas of lemon extract and one tablespoon heavy cream. Instead of using granulated sugar for the topping, I sprinkled a small amount of turbine raw sugar. It gave the sweetness without using a lot of sugar. I served these cookies with fresh berries.

I thought this recipe turned out great, although next time I will add a bit more sugar. Other than that, the cookies were awesome and cut perfectly. I think this deserves four stars.

Very good!  I thought these needed a tad more sugar.  I melted some white chocolate chips and drizzled it over the individual pieces and topped with crushed peppermint candies then drizzled a little more on top to help keep the candies from falling off.  Delicious!

This is much better than even the Land 'O Lakes butter recipe for shortbread.  Easy to work with, holds together well even though it is a typical dryish shortbread.  Flavor is wonderful!  I bake at 4600 ft. above sea level; did not change a thing and got perfect results.

Unfortunately, THESE ARE AMAZING!!!!! :-) So good. so easy. Only thing I did differently was to line my round pan with an oversized piece of parchment paper. That way, when they came out of the oven, I could lift them out of the pan and onto my cooling rack instead of trying to flip them out or whatever. Made it very easy to transfer to the cool rack and cut, also cut down on mess in my pan. LOVE THIS RECIPE. Definite keeper.

This recipe makes amazing shortbread!  I have made it a number of times, in a pie plate, cut out cookies, all with the same results...delicious!  The texture is what makes it the best, so delicate and flaky.  We LOVE it instead of shortcake for our strawberries, try it, you'll see, it is the best!!!

This to me is not a short bread cookie. I did add some extra sugar on top, but it still tastes like dough. Just dough with a bit of sweetness.

Shortbread cookies are my all time favorite and I am soo pleased at the result of this simple recipe... Buttery and sweet and great texture!! I added 4 tbls instead of 2 because i like em a little sweeter... and I only had an 8" pan so i cooked it for an additional 10 min bc of the extra thickness!!

Great Recipe!!!! I've made this shortbread several times with the intention of giving to some friends to enjoy with tea but, My family devours it. Even my Mom who doesn't care for shortbread.

Very yummy.  I cut up some strawberries with sugar to eat along with the shortbread.  My grandfather's comment was that this recipe was "good to the last crumb".  De-licious!  It does seem to use a ridiculous amount of butter for the amount of flour...but it sure makes it tasty!  Well done.  Will most definitely be making this recipe again. :)

I thought for sure I couldn't make anything on this site..I went from party girl 24/7 to step mother of two and wife. I ran acrossed allrecipes.com and decided to sign up.. I am tryed your shortbread. It was awesome. I added a couple things to it when it came out of the oven and cooled. I made a banana-strawberry puree dipped one side in them and layered strawberrys and bananas on them. HUGE hit! family loves them... Thank you very very much Kay.

This was a really good recipe, though, I did modify a little. I added a splash of milk to the dough as to other's suggestion. I also made them into cookies instead of putting in a pie pan. I sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar and they were delicious.

To make cookies from this recipe you have to lower the oven temp to 325F otherwise they burn.  Also used 2/3 cup confectioners sugar, a few teaspoons water, and green tea emptied from tea bags.  They were fantastic!!!

It's been years since I made shortbread. So glad I chose this recipe because it was delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I didn't do was sprinkle white sugar on top (although I bet it would be great with it) and instead of making it in a pan, I chilled the dough and rolled it into balls, pressed them down a little bit, and baked them as cookies. Same temp of 350F, and I took them out when they were golden. This makes a great buttery shortbread! I didn't run into any problems, and as someone else mentioned, be sure to mix well so that all the butter is incorporated. Making this my Christmas shortbread for sure!

We opted for this recipe for "Heritage Day" for my son to proffer for England over a basic recipe provide by Grandma that had rice flour that we didn't have. It was so well-received that there wasn't a crumb left after the first hour and anyone who knew my son asked that I relay the recipe to them. This may not be the classic Eng/Scot shortbread recipe but it is the one that pleases the masses. Make it and enjoy!

Fairly tasty shortbread although I think next time I might make the following variations:  add a small bit more XXX sugar to the mix, divide dough in half, and make a large sandwich cookie with two 9" pans.  I found it to be a little too thick for one giant cookie.  Additionally, I found the 2 T sugar on top to be too much--but that might just be because I frosted the thing with buttercream frosting.  All and all, a good recipe.

This was really good.  The dough looks a lot different than other shortbread I've made, but it turned out great.  Took a bit longer than 30 mins, but that was probably my oven.  I'll be making this again.

I baked these cookies for my boyfriend for Valentines - they're delish!! I didn't have all the ingredients, so I substituted the vanilla extract for 2 tsp of vanilla nesquick (milkshake mix) and it worked just as well!
For an added Valentines touch, I sprinkled the cookies with pink jelly crystals and moulded them into heart shapes :).
These cookies are so yum that I had to force myself not to eat all the batter!!
The only complaint I have is the high fat content - but they're great for a treat! :)

I will definately bake these again.

This shortbread was very good and very easy. I had to make it twice - the first time it was not done but, the second time I baked it for about 50-55 minutes and it was perfect. Very good!

This is delicious! Unfortunately--and I suspected this would happen--it's not solid enough in wedge-shape for me to hope to freeze the finished cookies and use later. I think I will try shaping them in the bottoms of muffin or minimuffin tins for a solid, less breakable cookie next time.

This recipe was very easy, and very good!
My 14 year old daughter and I really love shortbread cookies.
I didn't have a 9" cake pan, so I just used a 9" springfor pan.
It turned out just fine.
I will definitely be making it again.

Very good cookies, even with light margarine.  Next time I will try real butter because I am sure they are even more sinfully delicious then!

Wonderful!  I made the dough, wrapped in wax paper, and refrigerated over night.  Next morning, sliced and baked for 14 minutes at 350 degrees.  Perfect!  Very tender and not too sweet.

Simply delicious! I rolled out the dough and cut out Christmas shapes before baking and dipping in chocolate. This recipe is quick and easily duplicated.

Excellent!  These are so easy to make. Wonderful, they do melt in your mouth.  I added a bit of Cinnamon to the sugar that I sprinkled over the top.  That worked really well.  Tasted great too.  You don't even need the whole 2 tablespoons.

This is perfect.  If you're looking for something sweeter, then look up a sugar cookie recipe.  This is what shortbread is SUPPOSED to taste like.

I have already reviewed this recipe and usually never say a word about any variation from the original recipe. I used 11/2 teaspoons of pure lemon extract instead of the vanilla and all i can say is wow! If you like lemon cookies as much as i do this is a real addition!

Ok, what did I do wrong??  As soon as I took this out of the oven and went to put it on a cutting board to cut it, it fell apart.  The taste is there, it just crumbled.  Can someone give me some advice?  Thanks!

I loved this Shortbread. I did make a few changes. I was out of vanilla and used almond extract. Add 1 extra Tbsp. of granulated sugar - mixed the granulated sugar into the dough instead of sprinkling on top. Cut the butter into the flour before adding the other ingredients, and baked in a round cake pan, baked a little longer than the recipe says. Cut the Shortbread in pie shaped wedges and cooled on a wire rack. Delish. Very buttery and crumbly.

This is lovely shortbread -- crisp and flaky, and the vanilla gives it a bit more flavor than a traditional, 3-ingredient shortbread.  I read the reviews suggesting the addition of more sugar, but I found this recipe to be just sweet enough as is.

This was a last minute decision before company and so glad I did. My dough never stiffened with stirring. I had to press the crumbly mix with my hands into a square baking dish. Delicious.

I always check reviews first but I try not to make many changes. I added 1 Tbsp white sugar and 1 Tbsp milk. Also added a tsp cinnamon.  Dough came out beautifully. I baked in 9x9 pan and cut into small squares. Next time, I will add lemon/lime zest for a different taste.

Great easy recipe. Made in the stand mixer, only mixed ingredients until incorporated. It was still very crumbly until pressed into pan. Didn't measure sugar just sprinkled it on and baked. Also made a lemon coconut glaze for on top and they were delicious! (Lemon juice, shredded coconut, confectioners sugar)

Quick and easy to make. I used a 9 x 9 pan and cut into squares. Made it twice and prefer to sprinkle the sugar on right after it has baked rather than baking it with the sugar on the top.

It is very good! Like many reviews, I added a little more sugar and milk. I cut the cooking time to 20 minutes in the oven, maybe because I rolled the dough into a log and cool it down, then I cut it into small a rounds so it did not need to take so much time for cooking. 
I will definitely make it again.

I made this using some of the modifications based on other reviews I read. I used 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 1 T. milk, and sprinkled extra sugar on top. Just after I took the shortbread out of the oven, I flipped it onto a cutting board, and used pumpkin cookie cutters to cut out pumpkin shaped cookies since it's almost Halloween. After cutting out the shapes, I could tell the middle of the cookies weren't done baking all the way, so I put the cookie shapes on a flat baking sheet and baked them for about another three or four minutes. Then I put them on a cooling rack to finish cooling. The things I'll do differently next time is not use more sugar on top than the recipe calls for, and I think I'll try rolling the dough out and cutting them with cookie cutters into shapes before baking them. Other than that, I think this recipe is very good.

I used  3/4 cup powdered sugar because others stated that more sugar was needed. Good buttery taste. I was pleased!  I give this 4 stars.

I love the simplicity of the recipe and the flavor. I have made this recipe several times.  Sometimes I will add chopped lavender; however, this recipe is also delicious as is. I top my turbonado sugar.

Although this is a good cookie recipe it's not Scottish shortbread.  True shortbread only has three ingredients...flour, butter and sugar.  Kay's recipe is heavier.  Shortbread should be a little crumblier and simply melts in your mouth.

I made two batches. I used 3T extra powdered sugar, added a bit of milk to the first batch and forgot to add it to the second batch. The second batch was noticeably drier than the first one.

this was a very flavorful cookie.  using the pie pan method, the cookies fell apart (tips fell off) when I moved them to cooling rack, so next time I will try rolling it out and using cutters.

Oh my, this recipe is DELISH!!! The shortbread is so soft and flaky, buttery, melt in your mouth! I ate a quarter of it before my family had some then ate another quarter, not good for a carb addict but I simply could not stop myself!!! I WILL be making this again and again!
I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top, YUM!

Delish! We read some of the other comments and add 3 tbs milk. We rolled it into balls like cookie dough and spread it with jam after we baked it. Everyone loved it! Thanks for this recipe.

Excellent shortbread recipe!  I added about 2 tablespoons of whipping cream after reading the other reviews.  This was so easy to make and the cookies were gone before I knew it.  They are very buttery with just the right amount of salt. I will be making these again!

It is the day before grocery day, my daughter wanted to make cookies, but I had no eggs. I found this recipe and read the reviews. It seemed simple and easy enough for a 4 yr. old to help with and not be too frustrating for me.  I only had a cup of all purpose flour, so I used that and a cup of self rising flour.  I added the 1/4 cup extra powdered sugar like others suggested. I should not have added the salt. I only had a tiny bit of vanilla extract left. I just dumped it in.  I doubt it was a full tsp. Also, I only a 1/2cup of butter so I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter instead.   Since 4yr olds are impatient (just like moms with a sweet tooth) I decided to spoon the dough onto cookie sheets and had my daughter press them out with a fork (like peanut butter cookes). 10 min at 350* and we were in business! Even with all of the substitution, these were so delicious. Very light and melt in your mouth. I will never buy store short bread cookies again.

I made these cookies following the recipe exactly and they were amazing.  I ended up mixing the butter in by hand because the dough wasn't coming together, but I may have just been impatient.  I left half plain and spread Nutella on the other half and topped with crushed pretzels.  My husband declared them the best cookies he has ever had!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Melts in your mouth.  The confectioners sugar gives it a smooth texture and the edges have a golden, buttery taste.  A new staple in my recipe box.  Thanks Kay.

I changed the recipe slightly, turns out, without really meaning to, and it still turned out great! I only did 1 cup of flour in the dough, but then added probably about another 1/2 cup when rolling out the dough to keep it from sticking. It might have even been 3/4 cup; in any case, it needed more than 1 cup of flour, but I'm glad I didn't do 2 full cups since I was making thin cookies. They turned out crispy, but not lacking flavor. Instead of putting it in a baking dish and cutting it, I rolled it out to 1/4 thickness and used small cookie cutters. It worked beautifully and tasted delicious!

This is a keeper for sure! I've tweaked it a few times and loved every result! The one change I make every time is adding an additional 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Have also used brown sugar instead of white and it too is great! Thank you!

Love this recipe! The shortbread really melts in your mouth like it ought to do. The only thing is that it's a bit light so I would add the teaspoon of milk like everybody else. I would also advise baking it for a little less so the inside remains moist, otherwise it's stunning!

I've been looking for a good shortbread recipe for awhile now. This one is simple and pretty good. A little bland but drizzle a little chocolate on top and they're perfect! Next time I may add chocolate chips to the dough.

It's really good receipe, but for some reason it was a bit hard,not soft enough:(( (I put additional butter as was recommended.) Maybe I did something wrong or it was baking too long.

This shortbread was amazing. My mom was craving shortbread and i was also baking something else so i gave these a go. They were not a disapointment. I gave them a four thought because i felt like they were too salty and i am not a huge fan of shortbread anyways. Thanks!

Great recipe! Very simple to follow with delicious results. I added dbl the sugar on accident and they still turned out wonderful. Best thing is that these are rich and buttery dense and just a wee bit sweet.  served with strawberries and whipped cream and shaved chocolate in a shallow dish of cold milk. win!

use larger pan - 1/4 cup more confectioners sugar - 1/2tsp more vanilla - 1-2 Tbs cream.  Steve likes more on the well-done side

Very good. First time making shortbread.  Used to cut out cookies. I had to set the oven at 325 for 20 min.  added a bit of milk and some extra sugar.  Great cookies!

Very good shortbread. I think shortbread is a little plain by itself, so I drizzled it with a little caramel sauce, and that made it fantastic!

This is the most authentic and absolutely delicious shortbread! I’ve tried other recipes but this is he bomb!! I didn’t add the frosting showed on the picture as to not adulterate the simple bitter, sugar and flour yumminess. I did add1 tsp-almond extract to the vanilla. Perfection!!

Yummy! Mine were super-crumbly--don't know if I cooked too short a time (I added another 7 mins. to baketime) or if something else was a bit off. Great taste, though!

this is really delicious shortbread and some of the easiest to make. I would however recomend adding some whole milk to the recipe to make it moist and coating the top with milk before dusting with sugar as well.

I must have done something wrong, because even in a 9x9 square dish, this turned out way too thick and way to dry. I'm not sure I've ever had shortbread before (surely I have?) but it just wasn't for me. My three star rating is actually a bit high, but I think my reaction to it was mostly just personal taste. You mileage may vary.

I've never made shortbread before.  Is it supposed to taste like pie crust?  Regardless, it WAS delicious.  I made a glaze with lemon juice and powdered sugar and poured on top for icing.  Yummy!  I think I overmeasured the flour thus it was a little floury-tasting so next time I'll go a little under 2 cups.

I have tried many shortbread recipe's and having grown up with my Mum's recipe many pale in comparison and I have been making her recipe for many years to great acclaim!  (We are from Scotland).  This was quite tasty, a little too floury and if you never had it before it would do nicely.  Thanks for the recipe Kay, but I guess when you have a good one you should just stick to it!

So very easy & absolutely delicious! I followed the suggestion of a few previous reviewers and added a bit more confectioners sugar than called for. I also only lightly sprinkled the top with the white sugar. The sweetness of the cookies were perfect... Not extremely sweet but also not bland. And the ingredients are so basic, that you are most likely to have everything on hand already! No more store bought shortbread for us!

This was SO good! I used the shortbread as a base to add apples and cream and make a bread pudding like dessert. I was surprised that my shortbread turned out ok, because I had to cook it on the top of the grill in foil; my oven was dead. Thanks Kay!

GREAT RECIPE! I followed exactly and it turned out perfect! Next time I might try using 2 pans and putting half the dough in each for a cookie that is not as thick.  This recipe make great holiday cookies with some red or green sugar crystals sprinkled on top instead of the white sugar!

I just finished a batch...It is melt in your mouth delicious. I only sprinkled with 1Tbls of sugar which was just enough. I can't wait to make them as another reviewer had suggested by shredding the dough and layering with strawberry preserves.
