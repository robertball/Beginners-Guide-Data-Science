I love the flavors of this dish!  After reading the reviews of this recipe, I brainstormed a little and came up with my own method of cooking this dish.  A lot of reviewers had trouble with the crumb topping not sticking.  So, I dipped the salmon in a beaten egg then covered ALL sides with the crumb mixture.  Half a recipe of the crumb mixture was plenty to cover 4 salmon filets.  I got the sauce started simmering (didn't change a thing there).  Then I heated 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a separate skillet on medium-high heat and browned the salmon, flipping so all sides were brown.  Then I placed the browned salmon in the sauce to finish cooking for about 15 minutes.  I served it over brown rice with a side of mixed veggies.  I was questioning the use of teriyaki sauce, but I put it in and it was delicious!

The parmesan crust was absolutely amazing!  I left out the teriyaki sauce because it just didn't sound like it would complement the other ingredients. The only thing I recommend is marinating your salmon ahead of time, to give it more flavor.  I suggest using a very simple marinade of white wine and minced garlic.

This recipe was very good and easy to make. To make the parmesan side crusty I cooked it in butter in another pan instead of flipping it over to cook in the terk/wine sauce. I also saved the sauce and put on top of salmon, it was delicious! My fiance told me I had "out done myself."

This was a terrific salmon recipe!  The sauce had great flavor, but wasn't too overwhelming.  The parmesan crust didn't get crusty though.  I also marinated the salmon in teriyaki sauce for an hour before cooking.  i will use it again.

I prepared this for my wife's birthday on New Year's Eve.  My wife and our guests raved that it was the best salmon recipe that they had ever tasted.  We added fettucine with a garlic butter suace and fresh sugar snap peas to complete the meal.  Save this recipe after you try it!

I switched up the recipe by marinating the salmon in the wine and garlic mixture for 2 hours first.  Then dregged the salmon through an egg wash and then proceded to coat it with the parmesean crust.    This allowed the crust to stay "affixed" to the salmon as well as still providing the flavor of the white wine to permeate through.

This salmon was delicious. I didn't cook it in the sauce because the parmesan crust would have been soggy. Instead, I dipped the salmon in egg, then the parmesan topping and then quickly browned it in oil and baked it in the oven. After baking I poured the sauce over it. Yummy

I like other reviewers had trouble keeping the "Parm crust" on the fish.  Other than that...the taste was amazing.  I liked it and hubby said it was excellent.  The only complaint was the presentation, it did look a little messed up with part of the crust on the fish and the rest of it stuck to the pan and the spatula.  Thanks for the post...might try baking next time (and broiling at the end).

The parmesan crust is amazing but I have to agree with others, I just couldn't bring myself to add teriyaki to this dish.  I used someone else's suggestion and just marinated the salmon in a garlic/white wine first and it was fantastic!

Another recipe good enough to serve company!  I cooked the salmon in the wine sauce for 10 minutes before flipping.  However, when I flipped, the cheese/breadcrumb filling fell off into the sauce.  Next time I may cook for 5 minutes, flip, then sprinkle the cheese topping on the cooked side, cooking for an additional 5 minutes.  And if you use Veri Teryaki Sauce, you get the added benefit of sesame seeds in the sauce!  Yum

This recipe is great.  My kids loved the Salmon too, and they usually don't care for it.  I did need to run two pans of the reduction to fit all the salmon at once.        There was a lot of crust mix left over so I would probably cut it in half next time.  I'm also going to use fresh herbs to really spike the flavor. I don't know if i would use a Riesling for cooking it, might be too sweet, but I'd pour some with my meal!      As far as wine reductions go, this is a very flavorful sauce.  I found that if I moved the onions out of the way for the flip, the crust got very crunchy as it was directly on the pan.

Taking the advice of other reviewers, I browned the crusted side in a separate pan and it was amazing. Hubby actually asked if I'd put it on the weekly menu--and he doesn't care for fish. (not unless it's the bland, fried stuff available at certain fast-serve seafood joints, lol)

Very tasty! I loved this. However next time I would marinade the salmon in the wet ingredients ahead of time, and then roll in the dry ingredients, wrap in foil and bake. The pan frying was messy and like others said, you lose the parmesan breading. With a few tweaks, this one's a keeper!

Okay well this recipie does not work for me at all!  This was the third time doing it and my boyfriend and I CANNOT get the parmesean to stick.  Once we flip the salmon, the crust either (A) sticks to our spatula; (B) comes off or (C) just does not stay crusty....besides the Parmesean crusted part of the recipie, the salmon tastes very good! I follow the recipie and just cannot get the parmesean crust part of the recipie- after three times I'm done trying unelss anyone can point me in a better direction

I am going to wrap and bake the salmon the next time I prepare this meal rather than pan fry it.  It left a big mess in the pan that was very hard to clean up.  I also found it difficult to flip the salmon without loosing the crust.   I think by reducing the heat and cooking a few minutes longer would help keep the crust and keep the pan clean up less difficult.  However, since the crust was lost in this first time experience of cooking this recipe, I believe the teriyaki sauce is what gave the salmon it's flavor.  Which was a very good flavor.

mmmm....pretty good but idea, I will use it as a guide if I ever make a crusted fish again. I thought it was a lot of work for what I got. I just love fish any way you cook it.

Excellent. A very good recipe. I did use a second skillett with butter when I flipped them. Consider using Pam and broiling instead of flipping.

Yup, should have read the reviews before making this. Like many others have noted, the cheesy crust stuck to the pan, and for that I'm going to have to ding it one star. That was really disappointing. The wine/teriyaki reduction was really delicious though - not terribly pretty to look at it, but the flavor was amazing. It would pair well with chicken, I think. Nice recipe. Thanks, Chef Dave!

This was tasty but dry. I took half of the salmon out of the pan at 10 min and broiled it for 5 min. It came out a brown, but dry crust. The other half I left in the pan and flipped over. There wasn't any sauce left in the pan, so I had to add some olive oil for moisture. This one came out much better. If I make this dish again I will add an egg to the bread crumbs, or possibly some oil. I would also make more of the sauce. My guy liked it more than I did.

great recipe...family loved it.  I took another reviewer's advice and did not flip the salmon.  Instead I put the salmon in the oven on broil for the last 5 minutes.  It dirtied another dish but the crusty salmon was worth it.

Great flavor.  I had a problem with the crust. I like a crispy crust, and with the wine and other ingredients in the saucepan, the crust wouldn't crisp up enough.  Overall, the recipe was very good.

This recipe was great! I'm not the best cook and this was easy and came out very tasty. The flavors are amazing...made this with white rice on the side. My husband and I will make this again soon! (Also used fillets instead of steaks and came out perfectly)

Oh so good. I couldn't believe how moist and tender the salmon was. I used salmon filets, and I was afraid that this wouldn't work, but it did. I would like to have more of a crust on the salmon, and I will lower the heat next time, but will definately make this again and again.

I really liked the flavor and texture of this recipe.  However I found that it was very easy to burn, because of all the sugar in the sauce.  I will probably make it again and keep it on a lower heat, however I worry that the crust won't form in that case.

All I can say is WOW!! If you want a 5 star restaurant main course, you've just found it! The flavors of the seasoning blend so perfectly it's hard to imagine anything better! And the salmon doesn't taste at all "salmony" or "fishy," just has a perfectly tender, mild texture, which when you mix it with the seasoning comes out delicious. This will become my favorite salmon recipe, definitely going on top of the recipe box!

This just didn't do it for me. The bread crumb mixture was WAY too much-what a waste. I would half or even quarter it to fit 4 salmon steaks. Then the salmon cooked but the liquid didn't go away-which is what leads to the mushy crust. And the sauce was kind of sweet and bitter all at once. It was an interesting idea, but I didn't enjoy it at all.

This dish was delish!  I forgot to get the dill weed and accidentially got fresh tarragon but I cooked this recipe exactly as it says.  The only problem I encountered was that I did 2 servings and the liquid evaporated very quickly in the sauce pan.  An easy fix of adding more wine, water, and a little bit of teryiaki to the sauce pan and it was still delish.  I plan to pass this recipe along to many friends.

I would make again but instead of flipping the fish I would fry it in a oven proof pan and then I will put it in the oven to broil.  Also, I will add some brown sugar to bread crumbs.  It may not sound good to you, as I thought when I first heard about it, but I have sprinkled it own salmon before broiling  along with white wine and herbs and butter and it tastes great.

This is a wonderful alternative to poached salmon and so easy.   The reduction of liquids gives a delightful taste to the salmon.  I used Panko instead of Italian bread crumbs.  This is a keeper.

I've never made salmon before and was a little hesitant to try since I'm not a very experienced cook.  I tried it though and it was amazing.  The family loved it!  I left out the tarragon & dill weed since I didn't have any.  I also substitued soy sauce instead of teriyaki since I didn't have that either.  
It was still fantastic and I would definitely recommend trying it out!

Flavors were great, but the recipe called for way too much of the "crust". I would cut the ingredients in half to ensure you aren't wasting anything and if you need more you can make it as needed. Also, The recipe calls to cook the salmon on medium high heat - I ended up burning up all the sauce way too early and almost charred one side and there wasn't enough sauce left to make the crust crispy. I'd try cooking on medium instead of medium high. Again, Loved the flavors, but some elements of the recipe seemed a bit off.

This is a great recipe!  I doubled the white wine (using Riesling) and used panko crumbs with fresh basil and parmesan on top.  Also, I broiled the salmon like a previous reviewer instead of flipping and the crust was extremely toasty.  A very nice contrasting texture to the tender salmon.  Pairing this dish with whole wheat pasta and an arugula pesto made for a perfect meal.

I like this recipe b/c I was able to mess with it a bit.  My husband can't have soy so  I turned this into an Italian style dish.  I sub. balsamic vinegar for the t. sauce and then I added some lemon zest to the bread crumbs.  We topped it with a fresh tomato, basil and bread crumb salad.

I thought this dish was absolutely delicious!  I used a Teriyaki with Wasabi to give it an extra tang.  I also used previous reviewer’s advice by using a separate pan with butter when I flipped the patties on the cheese/bread crumb side.  I also sprayed the cheese/bread topping with Pam before flipping.  Absolutely wonderful!  Thanks!

Based on other reviews I pan-fried the crust side in a seperate pan with melted butter so it wouldn't stick. I thought this worked well and the salmon looked great!

This dish has a nice taste but I think next time I would cut down the wine-it was a bit overpowering. Also, I was only making 2 salmon steaks so I cut back on the bread crumbs to less than 1/2 a cup and added a sprinkle of sesame seeds. I too found that its difficult to flip the salmon and not loose the crust. Family thought it was ok and would eat again but not a huge hit.

Living in the middle of beef country (Kansas) I will admit I do not know a lot about Salmon.  But this is a good recipe.  Dipping in egg first is a must, though.   But the crust got done way before I thought the inside was done, so I put the whole thing in the 350 oven for about 10-15 minutes.  My husband and I both loved it.  Only reason for the 4 star it the lack of egg in order to glue the cruse on.

The flavor was SUPERB!  I did it a little differently, though, as I prefer baked fish.  

I combined all the ingredients except the grated cheese (I use Romano instead of Parmesan) and the bread crumbs.  I mixed everything in a bowl then spread it on the fish with a brush.  Then I sprinkled it with grated cheese and bread crumbs.  

I baked it, uncovered, for 25 minutes at 375-degrees, then dropped the oven temp to 350 and baked for another 15 minutes.  

I served with rice and butternut squash.  My husband and I loved it!

Very yummy! The recipe says to bread  just one side of the salmon, but I did both sides. I also added a dash of lemon juice after it was finished.

The only thing I did different from the recipe was I made an egg wash to make the Parmesan mixture stick. And instead of flipping the salmon in the skillet, I took them out and broiled them on high in a glass dish with aluminum foil in it (shiny side up) until top was the desired golden brown. (About 10-15 min)

Very tasty.  I agree with some of the reviews that you should dip the salmon in a beaten egg before dipping in the crumbs.  I also made a side of "Orzo with Parmesean and Basil."  It was a great pairing! My husband is telling me that this will be a permanent meal in our house :-)

I subsituted the teriyaki sauce with VH Orange & Ginger stirfry sauce.  I also followed the suggestion of dredging salmon in egg prior to crumbing and frying in butter before adding the sauce.  It turned out to be quite delicious.  This is a keeper.

Wow, I'm with the person that didn't care for it. My crust all came off an it definetly was not crunchy. I just don't know what I did wrong. I'm bummed cause i spent like 15$ for the salmon:(
