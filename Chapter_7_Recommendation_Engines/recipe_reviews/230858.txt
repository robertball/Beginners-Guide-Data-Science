This had way too much Italian seasoning for us and I even cut it way back.  Also, I would cook the mushrooms and onions in a separate pan and then just fold them into the eggs with the cheese at the end.  The mushrooms scrambled with the eggs gave the eggs a muddy color.

Eight oz. of mushrooms for 5 eggs?  A whole onion?  Even more startling, 1-1/2 TABLESPOONS of Italian seasoning?  For 5 eggs?  Especially regarding the seasoning, one could reasonably assume this has to be a typo!  That said, if I were to rate this recipe according to these measurements, I would assign it one star, and according to AR’s guidelines, that means inedible.  If I were to rate this, however, on more sensible measurements, I would rate this 5 stars.  Not only did I not use 1-1/2 T. of Italian seasoning, I used none at all – because I don’t use “Italian” seasoning.  But if I was to use it, I’d use a more reasonable 1/4-1/2 tsp. – “to taste” if you will.  Besides, garlic and herb Boursin has quite a lot of flavor on its own and because of it you’d be pushing it with extra seasoning.  I did, however, add some chopped fresh chives to compensate for omitting the “Italian” seasoning.  As for the mushrooms and onions, I added what looked right to me, and it was far less than what the recipe directed.  The Boursin added a pleasant, subtle, herby creaminess, and while the mozzarella didn’t contribute much flavor, it added a decadent gooiness.  So in the final analysis, made as directed with at least one possible typo (the amount of Italian seasoning) this would be 1-star inedible.  With more conservative amounts of everything, we loved it, 5 stars.  In fairness, I’ll rate it midway in between at 3 stars, which assumes the reader takes into account these considerations.

I cut the italian seasoning back to a half teaspoon and added in one more egg. I also used one package of Laughing Cow cheese because I did not have Boursin. I liked this more than the kids did. I would make this again, just for myself.

I thought this was barely OK. I made it exactly as written. I'd never bought the Boursin before, but it was kind of nice itself. But overall, this wasn't really a breakfast kind of dish to me. I probably won't be making it again.

We added goat cheese instead of Boursin, and it was delicious.  We will add fresh spinach next time.

This was so good as well as being easy to make.  I also served it on toast and it was enjoyed.  I will make again!

I did not read the reviews prior to making this but find some of the comments appropriate.  As I worked through the recipe I only used half the Italian Seasoning, particularly since we used garlic and herb Boursin cheese. Next time I will also use a separate pan for the eggs and fold in the Mushroom and Onion mixture, primarily because the eggs started to cook too fast in the very hot pan I was already using.  I served with Rye toast.  Thanks for sharing Boonu,  this was very good.

I made this almost as written I never had the herb & garlic cheese so I used a laughing cow cheese instead .  Husband and son both loved it , my son said it was that good he never even used ketchup,  A keeper fot sure.
