This recipe is soooooo yummy! But beware it is also very very rich. The only changes I made to the recipe was to bake the brownies for 30 minutes instead of 20. When I went to take them out of the oven at 20 minutes they were still liquidy...so definitely add the extra 10 minutes to the baking time. Also, I added mini chocolate chips to the cookie dough part. These were a HUGE hit at our family night out! Thanks for the recipe!

These were a hit at my party! They almost didn't make it out of my house because my friend and fam bam all wanted me to reserve them a slice. Used box brownie mix instead cuz I was too lazy to prepare all the ingredients. However, I'm sure this recipe's brownie would have been fine because to me, I don't care the texture if it tastes like a brownie it's a brownie. Added in a bag of mini chocolate chips in the cookie dough. A reviewer said they had problems with the dough sticking to the brownie. Well, I fixed that by adding the dough BEFORE the brownie cooled all the way, sent it to the freezer for 30 min and after adding the glaze they fused together perfectly. Will make another for my family next. Thanks for sharing!

Overall, good recipe but I found the brownies to be too cake-y for my taste.  I prefer a more fudge-y brownie.  Also, don't refrigerate these for too long or else the chocolate on top completely hardens - makes it harder to cut.

I only rated this a 4 because i used my own brownie base so i could use an 8x8 pan, but we really enjoyed these!  I def would put mini chips into the cookie dough batter next time.  I let the chocolate chips slightly harden, then scored them in 1" squares, and then let them finish hardening.  It made it pretty easy to cut.  I had a slight problem with the cookie dough separating from the brownies, but this may have been because of the small size i cut them.  These are really rich but very good if you like raw cookie dough!

These were ok.  I had trouble with the topping coming off very easily.  They were not really worth the work.

Good idea but, i found that the cookie dough wasn't very good. I would recommend using your own eggless cookie dough

There is something missing in the cookie dough part of this, even with the choc chips in it. It almost tastes like chocolate chip cookie dough but not quite. Lack of eggs may be the difference. But, my family still liked them and they were easy to make. The dough layer adhered fine to the brownies but I had a little trouble with the chocolate layer not adhering. Could be because I put them in the freezer as another reviewer recommended.

You can use pasteurized eggs in this recipe and it will taste like real cookie dough and it will still be safe and healthy. You can buy pasteurized eggs at your local grocer.

These brownies were a hit with everyone! The only thing I changed is I used a mix for the brownie base the 1st time and they were great (2 boxes Duncan Hines fudge brownies). Lots of friends asked for the recipe and I sent them to the site.
