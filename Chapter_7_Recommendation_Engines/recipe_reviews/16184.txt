This is REALLY good but very spicey.  Not for the kids or sensitive taste buds.

I just made the basting portion of the recipe.  Didn't have time to marinate.  Very good! Just put evoo, salt/pepper grilled for 10 min. turned and basted with sauce.  Then repeated.  Turned out great.

Yum.  These have become a summer standard at our house.  I don't put quite as much spice on the chops as the recipe calls for.  In fact, I just mix up a batch of the rub and keep it in jar in my pantry so I always have some on hand.  Also, I just use whatever mustards I have on hand, but the honey and horseradish are a must.

I make these chops all the time..yummy. However I only use 3 tablespoons on black pepper to cut back on the spiciness of this dish. I also cook them in the oven in foil so they come out juicy and tender.

Ok, I can't even begin to imagine how spicy these would have been had I followed the recipe exactly.  I cut the spice down by at least half if not more and they still had kick.  I also just mixed all the ingredients together and let them marinade overnight.  There is another recipe on this site for honey mustard pork chops that I prefer, so I doubt I'll be making this one again.  Sorry just way too much spice for us.

Delicious!  I was out of cayenne, but I followed the rub  ingredients exactly besides that.  I put it all in a bag like Shake N Bake to make the cleanup process a little easier.  The brown sugar in the rub made the chops brown quickly - I'd probably use a little less next time.  I waited to baste the chops with the honey the last few minutes so they wouldn't burn.  Very tasty!

These were simply awesome. There is no doubt I will be making these again. Despite what others said I kept the ingredients as indicated in the recipe and the chops were not too spicy for us or my children. They loved them...but I must admit my kids love spicy foods (smile). I did adjust the recipe just a little bit, I didn't have horseradish mustard on hand so I omitted it and I used spicy brown mustard instead of regular brown mustard. I also added Honey Champagne Mustard and this gave the mustard mix a nice sweet flavor. These are awesome chops!

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!! Beware though, they are VERY spicy.  I made half w/ the spice and the other half w/ minor spice.
I've made it twice.  The first time, I burned the chops very bad on the grill, so I put them in the oven the 2nd, which was better!!

Hmmm...this is a hard one for me to rate. I used some beautiful center cut thick boneless chops. They were so moist and delicious. As for the ingredients, they were spicy, just like I like my it.  I think I would have enjoyed this better if I had used a tad more of the honey like another reviewer suggested. I liked these ok, but my husband did not. He likes another rub I use for chops. He kept suggesting that I try these again using my rub and the other ingredients, and a little more honey, which I may do. I like the mustards and horseradish. The flavor is very unique. Thank you so much for sharing this with us!

My family loved these chops..... The only thing I will do different next time is not put as much cayenne pepper....It made them a little bit to spicey for my younger kids

The flavors were good but HOT next time I am going to cut the cayenne pepper in 1/2. The mustard sauce was good but I don't think I got my grill hot enough so I didn't get the crust on it I should have.

I did the rub and grilled the pork.  I then used another recipe for honey mustard for dipping after it was cooked, instead of while on the grill.  It was VERY good!

I didn't really "follow" the recipe. I used all the ingredients and amounts, but I just threw it all in a bowl and marinated 30 minutes and dumped all the marinade over the chops while broiling for 7 min one side, 5 the other. 
They were sooo delicious, juicy and not too spicy!

YUM!  If you don't like a little spice, you won't like this recipe but we LOVED it.  I made only one change and substituted pure maple syrup for the honey.  Thank you for sharing this one!

Okay, so this one will make your taste buds tingle, or maybe even burn.  But it was good.  The honey was a nice touch and if I make it again, I may use more.  The sweet helped tame the fire.

These are incredibly delicious but I recommend cutting down the cayenne pepper (red pepper). I adjusted the recipe the first time and it was delicious. I made it full force the second time and the Heat overpowered the flavor. I absolutely recommend this recipe though!
