Couldn't be simpler, and full of flavor. In  my opinion does'nt need much else to shine.  I did add more garlic, but then I always do.  Sort of an automatic pilot thing, as I love my garlic.  A little thin for a sandwich spread, but that's easily adjusted by putting in less vinegar and oil.  Still, it's about the consistency of a marinara so it still works.  I love the flavor and think I'll pair with feta and turkey on bread tonight, then warm it in the oven for a warm sandwich.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good as a salad dressing! I added a little bit of dried oregano.

Great recipe and super simple and quick. My favorite use is to serve it as a dipping sauce for arancini balls (risotto balls), yum!! For super easy risotto, see slow cooker risotto by Lady7Fire. Couldn't be easier but cook it 2-2 1/2 hours.
