This was a good and hearty meal, but not really what I was expecting. When I first mixed the sauce, it tasted very tangy, but at serving time it had lost a lot of its zing. Basically it tasted like sloppy joes made with a roast instead of ground beef. Not bad, but not what I was looking for. I think I'll stick to my Italian beef recipe, thanks anyway.

After reading reviews of being bland, I added chili powder.  I also threw in a can of kidney beans and diced tomatoes.   Was awesome over egg noodles.

This was very easy to prepare.  It tasted good, however, I think the next time I'll add a little more spice (peppers) as this seemed just a little bland.

This was definitely easy to put together and had few ingredients, but I can't imagine it as anything other than a filling for sandwiches.  Adding the green pepper as mentioned in the recipe description makes the flavor better.    I'm not sure I would make this again but to be fair, due to the ease and economy-friendliness of this recipe, it would make a good dinner if you want a meatier texture in your sloppy joe.

This was an easy dish but my family wasn't fond of the flavor.

Very tasty.  Great over rice.  Add a little extra garlic and it's a wonderful red pasta sauce.

This is getting 4 stars from my family. We did add garlic and chili pepper but I think it needed something eles (citrus or something).

Very easy and tasty.  I only had 4 hours to let it cook, but it was still quite good, even though the meat wasn't as tender as it might have been.  We ate it over spaghetti noodles, as that was all I had on hand.  Will definitely serve again.

This recipe was really tasty. I was liberal with the hot sauce and added some chopped jalepino. Next time, I'll tenderize the beef before adding it to the crock pot. You really want the beef to fall apart when it's done.
