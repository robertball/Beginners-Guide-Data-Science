I loved this pie, as did my husband. Don't be intimidated by it- 8 tablespoons is really just half a cup, so 9 is half a cup plus 1 TBS. As for the double boiler method, I always use a makeshift with my biggest metal bowl over a pan that I fill about 1/3 full of hot water. It just sets in there so that your custard isn't directly over the heat. I did whisk it occasionally, but you don't have to stir constantly like you would if it was directly over heat. I did follow the suggestion to use coconut milk (and I just threw in the whole can, because what am I going to do with another half cup of coconut milk?) and some flaked coconut, and it was really delicious. The ice cream in the custard adds a nice effect, and once it was really chilled and set, my husband found it reminiscent of a coconut marshmallow (or maybe that's the gelatin that makes it marshmallow like). Anyway, the extra couple of minutes it takes to make this recipe are worth it, for sure.

Outstanding vanilla cream pie!  Perfect texture, it was down right silky!  I cheated and put it in a chocolate crust....OH MY GOODNESS!!!
This would be incredible with anything on it, I think any fresh fruit, husband was going for carmel.  I think I could eat the entire thing myself! HAHAHA  I did not remember to put the remaining whipped cream on top.  Need to mention the chocolate crust again -- it was incredible!!!!

I used this recipe as the base for a coconut cream pie. I used coconut milk instead of regular milk and folded in coconut. It was so much lighter than a traditional cream pie. Everyone loved it.

This was fabulous, right up until I folded in the whipped cream which killed the flavor. It ended up tasting the same as if you'd just taken a swig of cream right out of the carton. I notice that most of the other reviewers added something to it, guess I should have tried that because I can see how it might make a nice base.

This pie needs to be discovered by other users!  I made this two year ago and we absolutely loved it.  I finally dug the recipe out again to make for Easter.  My husband, who doesn't go for vanilla normally, loved it too.  We used more sugar than it called for and it was fun to use chocolate graham crackers for the crust.

I won't use quite as much gelatin next time.  It was too "set" for me, maybe use 1 pkg next time.  Other than that it was delicious. 
Made one also with and bananas to my boyfriend's half and  chocolate shavings to mine, all on a chocolate crust. Delicious also.
