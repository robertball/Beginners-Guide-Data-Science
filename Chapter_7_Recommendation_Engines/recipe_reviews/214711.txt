I have been making this for years but didn't know it was Russian.  I personally like it. I do use pickled beets and or pickled eggs because I like the zing from the vinegar, it gives it more taste. If you like beets you will like it. Thanks for sharing.

I've lived in Costa Rica for 7 years and this is my favorite salad. We call it Ensalada Rusa. Great recipe.

A unique potato salad.  As one reviewer suggested, I used pickled beets which really had a nice flavor.  I think regular beets would be too bland.  Tasty, interesting to try, but I prefer a more traditional potato salad.

Any recipe that has beets in it, is good in my opinion. I add 3 cooked chopped hard boiled eggs and a small can of peas and a little mustard and vinegar. Great recipe!

This is truly a delicious and unique potato salad.  I make as is with the exception of the beets - I buy pickled beets as it definitely kicks up the flavor.  You don't need to add too much to this recipe, likely just a bit more mayo than it calls for (my preference).  I also chop the eggs as I prefer that texture to diced.

Really good recipe if you want a change from the usual potato salad, especially if you like beets. I used fresh beets that I diced and and boiled for a while until they were fork soft. Separately boiled the potatoes as well as the eggs. Moth my kids love beets, so they loved this salad! I do not care for beets, so I can't comment...I did add a squeeze of mustard to give it a bit of tang, and it works pretty well! Thanks for sharing :)

I used the option of adding peas, and cooked fresh beets instead of using the canned variety.  This is delicious and easy to assemble.  I've already been asked to make this again!

This is a delicious salad when you add one more ingredient--dill pickle relish, with lots of dill pickle juice.  Excellent as well when you substitute low fat mayo for real mayo.  Try it!

It is perfect as written.  Don't change a thing.  My Dad had nothing to say but that it was "very good"...which is high praise indeed!
