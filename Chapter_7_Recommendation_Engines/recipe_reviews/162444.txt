Good base recipe. Because of the prior comments regarding dry chicken I added a cup of chicken broth and cooked on low for 5 hours. I also added a sprinkle of salt pepper and garlic powder to each piece of chicken. I didn't have peas on hand but we love spinach so I added a bag of fresh spinach during the last half hour of cooking.

We thought this was pretty tasty. I did what another user suggested and added a can of tomato soup (only b/c I had one in the pantry and we like alot of sauce). We served this with pasta and the hubby and kids all enjoyed it.

After seven hours the chicken was dry and over cooked. It completely fell apart and was a shredded dinner. I thought the combination of ingredients would make for a good taste. I will try again with a shorter cook time to keep the moisture and the flavor.

I am so happy to have found this recipe because it is a good base to be creative and use up the remaining cans of tomatoes I had in the pantry. I used 5 chicken breasts 3 cloves of garlic 2 T soy sauce 2-14oz cans of Stewed Tomatoes with Basil and Oregano 1-14oz can of tomato sauce and 1-14 oz can of chicken broth. Placed frozen chicken breasts in the pot and poured all the other ingredients on top of it. Let it cook for 9 hours. On the 10th hour I added frozen peas and carrots. This version will be a little brothier (just how I like it) so reduce the chicken broth if you are using frozen chicken.

i really liked this! I liked that it is pretty healthy and doesn't use canned creamed soup. (i use enough of that!) I did add a can of tomato soup to make more sauce (there's no MSG in tomato soup yay!) and i used a little less than 2 tbsp of the soy sauce. I was hesitant to try this b/c of the soy sauce (i'm just not a fan!) but my husband loves soy sauce so I gave it a try and wow i really loved it! So fast and so easy. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly and my husband and I thought it was just ok. It was not bad but definitely not great. We thought it was on the bland side and probably won't be making it again. But on the plus side we both agreed that it was rather healthy.

This was delicious! We are learning to eat better so I am learning a new way to cook. I did add the can of tomatoe soup as suggested by others and only had regular diced tomatoes to I had to add my own basil (guessed at the amount). When it was done we put it atop a bed of rice. My fiancee who is 10x the cook I am even raved! We will definitely have this again!

For me too it turned out flavorless. The chicken was tender but the sauce could use a lot more. It was missing something crunchy on the tongue so I added some sauteed onions and would have added a green pepper if I had it at the time too. The next day while reheating I ended up adding quite a bit of tomato and basil mix along with chili powder to give it more zest. The final result turned out not bad but I won't be making this dish again.

This is not bad. The chicken was somewhat dry and falling apart but I think it's bc I cooked it too long--I wasn't able to turn it off when I meant to. I added tomato soup to the crock pot in addition to the other ingredients and so there was plenty of liquid. I think that it just needs the peas added a bit earlier and turned off within 7 or 8 hours and it'll be fine. Thanks for the recipe!

Will never make again. Even with the tomato soup the chicken was very dry.

I did what a lot of others did and used this recipe as a jumping off point. I put FROZEN chicken into the crockpot to keep it from over cooking. I did scatter a few dashes of salt pepper and garlic powder over the chicken before pouring the soup mixture over it. I did add a can of Campbell's Tomato Soup as well as some extra garlic. Cooked 7 hours shredded chicken and served over pasta. (left the peas out). We LOVED it.

This recipe is a great one if you use bone in chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. I have a 6 quart slow cooker and I used 12 chicken thighs and quadrupled the sauce to go over them. Even after 12 hours on low the thighs were melt-in-your-mouth moist!

I would give this 4-stars for potential maybe even 5. But unfortunately I failed to read the reviews (first time and it bites me!) so I didn't realize 7 hours was too long and that maybe it needed a bit more liquid. I don't know about the additional liquid but for sure 7 hours was too long. I stopped it at 6 and it was a bit dry. BUT I see where it would be really good - next time I just won't cook it as long!

I made this last night for my family. We loved it! My 4 year old said it was the best ever and had seconds. I did add tomato soup to it so it didn't dry out. Also since I work all day I couldn't add the peas. I just served it with veggies and mashed potatoes on the side. I will make this again and again!

This was a super easy and delicious way to cook chicken. My husband loved it. I served it with quinoa and the tomato/pea combo was great over the quinoa. Could have used more peas but we like peas. Definitely a keeper!

This is a great recipe for chicken! I read the other reviews and added a can of tomato soup but that left a lot of liquid in my cooker - maybe next time I'll just add half a can. I also added half a white onion for some extra taste and texture. Maybe more garlic next time as well. Combined with mashed potatoes or rice this will make a comforting meal on a cold winter night.

Not great-the ingredients didn t give the chicken much flavor. It s as though the tomato and seasoning floated around chicken but didn t flavor it.

I had fresh tomatoes from the garden so chopped two big ones instead of canned, used 1/2 c of chick broth as some suggested. Served with zucchini chips with Parmesan. Great meal! Hubby said we should make again so it’s a keeper and an easy one at that.

I enjoyed how easy and healthy this recipe was. Unfortunately my husband and I both felt it lacked flavor. I tried to add other spices as suggested in other reviews but it didn't seem to help. I might make it again and play around with more spices to get more flavor.
