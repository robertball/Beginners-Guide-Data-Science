it was spot on with the timing however i did add sliced onions. it was TOO salty for my liking but im not sure if it was the onions or the actual sauce or the garlic salt. i will do it again but omit the garlic salt and just use regular garlic powder.

I used garlic POWDER , like I always do.  Like one other reviewer said....you MUST use Yoshida teriyaki sauce, it is NOT salty. The other good one is Soy Vey. Both of these are excellent or you can make your own and adjust the salt or just leave it out. Soy sauce is naturally salty. I also used a cast iron pan.

I've made this recipe twice with two different brands of teriyaki sauce. If you're not using Mr. Yoshidas teriyaki sauce, then don't waste your time and money. 

Yoshidas teriyaki sauce will make or break this recipe.

Best pork chops I have ever made...and that's my son who said it! I only needed 10 minutes on each side, and I used pretty thick pork chop. Just keep an eye on the. But definitely a new staple in our house!

Pretty good followed the recipe exact but used a little more teriyaki sauce than the recipe. It was a little salty but not to bad.

I made this tonight for dinner, very salty and I substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt. 15 minutes is far to long to cook these pork chops, they came out dry and tough. The teriyaki over powered the pork....

I'll have to make it again to be sure I like it or not. My family seemed to enjoy it. I will have to experiment with it more. Overall, not bad...

Wanted to try something different with pork chops and this fit the bill.  I left out the garlic salt since most reviews said it was too salty...it needed salt.  Then again, I used 1" thick pork chops so just need modify to taste.  If using thick cuts, try cutting in halves or thirds for a more consistent flavor.  Served this with steamed rice and mixed veggies (corn, peas, string beans).

a bit too salty for my taste.  If I do this again, I'll swap garlic powder for the garlic salt, and maybe add some honey or orange juice to the marinade to make it slightly sweeter.
