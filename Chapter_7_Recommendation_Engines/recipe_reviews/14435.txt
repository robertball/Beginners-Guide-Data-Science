I loved this salad! My family liked it. The salad has a lot of flavor. I made it as a side dish to a quiche. My daughter thought the  tastes of the two dishes were too strong, for they didn't compliment. I put two small cans of Mandarin oranges in the salad, which gave it a nice sweet touch. Thanks for the recipe!

This is absolutely delicious, and I now make it every week or two!  The first time I brought it to work, people thought I had gotten it at a fancy deli.  They kept saying, "Wow, it looks beautiful!"  They were impressed with the fennel too; a few of them had never seen the bulb before.  The flavor was wonderful.  I also threw in some dried cranberries, which really added to the presentation.  If you really wanted to be fancy, you could throw some toasted chopped pecans on there.  Awesome recipe!

I found the fennel flavor to be a bit too overwhelming. My grocer had both large and small fennel bulbs. I used the larger and if I were to make this again I would use a smaller bulb or just use part of a larger bulb. However, the oranges do pair well with the fennel and tone that fennel flavor down.
I also used baby spinach instead of arugala. I do not recommend this. Arugala has more flavor than baby spinach.
However, this does make for a very pretty dish!

This salad is a very nice change from more traditional lettuce salads.  Fennel has a mild anise flavor- don't be afraid to try it!

We thought this was a nice change.  Very summery tasting.  Next time I would chop the fennell and oranges into smaller bite size pieces.  I made it the night before serving, next time I would make it two nights before.  It was much better today for lunch.  Less vinegar taseting.

I used tinned mandarin oranges, and I didn't have red wine vinegar (I thought I did when I went to make this), so I substituted cider vinegar.  It was the first time I have used fennel and was pleasantly surprised at the mild flavor of it.  It was a nice change for a salad, and I will probably make this again.

i just made this for thanksgiving and once the family got passed "what is fennel?" they seemed to really like it.  The presentation is phenomenal (i added cranberries as someone suggested) and the colors were great.  It was a great, healthy light salad that I'm sure I'll be making alot this summer.

Very good, easy to make - I used two small ruby red grapefruits and really enjoyed it.  I liked the mix of the tangy grapefruit and the nuttiness of the arugula, and the flavor of the fennel.

A good change from the usual green salad! I did make a few changes to the recipe: I added sliced red onion, sliced toasted almonds (instead of poppy seeds) and served it over baby spinach (instead of arugula.) I didn’t get as much fennel flavor as I had hoped… but, the salad was still quite tasty. I think I’ll make it again, with a few additional changes. Thanks, Barrett!

This was the first time I had ever made anything with fennel.  The fennel was a bit chewy so I roasted it in some oil and honey.  I thought the dish was delicious, but it wasn't as big a hit as I would have thought with my guests.

I love fresh fennel, and I really enjoyed this salad!  To make it work best, just make sure that you have the freshest fennel and oranges available, since they are essentially the basis of the recipe.  The poppy seads are a great touch!  The only change that I made was to double the amount of vinegar since the red wine vinegar that I had on hand was relatively mild.  This is a wonderful salad!

I think I kept my fennel in the veggie crisper too long as I think it lost it's flavor.  I will buy some more and use it right away.  I was so bummed it just didn't have the PUNCH I wanted it to have.  I'll re-review when I make it again.

This just didn't work for me.  It wasn't awful but it wasn't great either.  No one else in my family would eat it after the first bite.

I asked my family what they thought of the salad and they said it was ok but not all that great.  I liked it though.  I thought the oranges and fennel went well together.  I peeled the oranges before slicing them.

Loved the dressing with the fennel and orange.  Very refreshing and a great change to regular tomato cuke salads.

This salad was good but we thought it could use a bit of sweetness.  We added pomegranate seeds and drizzled a touch of honey over it and it was superb!  Will definitely make it again.

I just made this and was impressed. I added dried cranberries per suggestion, and used 1/2 bulb fennel (only white part) plus one carrot, but everything else as written. I put it on a bed of raw kale rather than arugula. The only thing I might think about is whether an herb could tie the flavors together. As is, the flavor was light with the vinegar and juice from the oranges, but I thought it could use something else. Letting it meld for a while before eating might fix this.

This was a refreshing change for a salad.  I added of a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds and substituted baby romaine for arugula.  My husband and I are interested in healthy recipes and both enjoyed it.  No leftovers!  Will definitely be making again.
