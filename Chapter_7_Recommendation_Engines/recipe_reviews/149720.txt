Quite unexpectedly good for a vegan recipe. I made this to top some vegan chocolate cupcakes for some friends of mine that don't consume animal products. My only critique would be that it seemed a little oily/greasy, so perhaps cutting the margarine content to less than 1/2 cup would yield a better consistency. Taste is excellent, however, the texture is the only problem I am having. Also, I am refrigerating the frosting to see if it yields a less greasy result after cooling completely.

I made this to go along with a vegan chocolate cake for a vegan coworker's birthday. I had a little trouble following the first part of the recipe and the consistency was a little off at first, but I added a small amount more soy milk and it was slightly better.

If I could swear on here about how good this was, I would.  My partner really assumed it would be no good because it was vegan--then she tried it.  Now we're engaged!  Actually, it wasn't because of this recipe, but it is really good, and we look forward to serving it to guests.

This was good and the only thing I did different was use all vegan butter, no shortening. It was a really nice compliment to my spice cupcakes (also vegan), but like any caramel buttercream, it's really really sweet. Too sweet for some. Hard to get around that - you really do need all the powdered sugar for consistency, that is if you want to actually frost and not drizzle. Overall very good though, and no one other than the actual vegans knew it was vegan!

I needed a frosting and as luck would have it, found one in need of a face. Only 4 stars, I used Real butter! The flavor was YUMMY!! The texture was a bit wonky, so I added a little more milk and that smoothed it right out! I used this to top Pumpkin Ginger cupcakes, but made a sheet cake instead.  Thank you  LenoreR.

WOW! Super easy to make and extremely good! I couldn't stop licking the bowl.  I think I use this to dip my apples in as well.
