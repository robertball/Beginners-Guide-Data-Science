Okay Ya'll, I've made these muffins a few times now, and I think I've got my final version.  First, when you soften the cream cheese, do not beat until creamy.  It should still be fairly stiff when you add the remaining ingredients.  Also, don't mix it thoroughly.  If you still have little "globs" of cream cheese floating around, it's perfect.  It should be the consistency of a thick sour cream.  The first time I made it, I beat it thoroughly smooth and ended up with soup! 
 On the actual muffins, if you use white sugar, you get a lighter muffin, brown sugar makes a heavier muffin (go with what you like best).  I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon. The batter is thick, but it works if you only fill the muffin cups 2/3 full.  I always get at least 24 muffins with this recipe. Last, the cream cheese mixture makes a cheesecake topping on the muffin, not a filling. I liked this recipe alot better once I realized that!  (Especially since I really like cheesecake) Make sure you put in indent with a teaspoon on top of muffin batter before you top it with cream cheese mixture. You end up with cheesecake spread evenly over the top! This recipe is very good, the cream cheese mixture was the only thing I had difficulty with.  But now, it's all goooooood.

Yummy!
I made a few changes.  I substituted 2 tbsp. of brown sugar for the 5 tbsp. called for in the stuesel topping, and I didn't use pecans, because my husband doesn't like them.  I added 1 tsp. of ground cloves and 1 tsp. of nutmeg to the muffin batter.
I had enough muffin batter for 24 regular size muffins -- I did not have enough cream cheese topping for all 24 -- but that was okay, the muffins were divine without it.
Also, I used vegetable oil, instead of olive oil.

Great recipe!  Muffins are "to die for".  Will make perfect gifs this fall. Thanks a bunch for posting this recipe.  It is a new family favorite!

I'm a 20-yr-old college student home for the holidays, and I just used this recipe to make a birthday cake for my pumpkin-loving mother (who usually requests a pumpkin pie on her birthday, when everyone has had their fill of pie).  It worked out great!
I skipped the crumb topping, cooked the batter in two round cake pans and then used the rosting (raw) to frost the cake.  There wasn't enough to completely cover the cake, but I frosted the top of one, than placed the other on top and frosted the top of that one.  It looked like a big sandwich cookie and after a while, the frosting starts to ooze down the sides, making it look like an old-fashioned confection (very pretty).  
I used nonfat cream cheese and was worried about its ability to stand up to refrigeration, but it made it great!  I also used applesauce instead of any shortening-- no one was the wiser.  Thanks a bunch!

My best friend and I used to work together . . . right across from a Starbucks.  We loved getting their Pumpking Cream Cheese Muffins in the fall.  When they stopped serving them, I found this recipe and made it right before my friend came over one night.  We both loved them.  She has since moved to another state and always asks me to make them when she comes to visit!  My husband, who grudgingly tried these because he hates pumkin pie, also loves them.  I did make a few variations.  I make double the cream cheese mixture (and I've never had a problem when the cream cheese touches the paper cup).  I leave out the pecans, and I add some pumpkin pie spice.  I also substitute canola oil for the olive oil.

Please read the one, two and three star reviews - I found my experience with these muffins to be the same! While I wouldn't call them a failure, they didn't deliver the exceptional results I was expecting from them either. To address a few issues: olive oil is very well-suited for this recipe, so it is not a mistake or something weird. Extra-virgin olive oil, however, is generally NOT suitable for baking because its flavor is too strong. "Pure" or "light" olive oil should be used here. In addition to the cinnamon I also added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice but it did little to give these the flavor boost I had hoped for. As for the "filling," which really is a topping, I increased the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and was glad I did. Similar recipes call for 1/3-1/2 cup sugar as opposed to this recipe's mere 3 T. But the "filling" was a disappointment, not making the statement I had hoped for or expected. Summing it up, these were a fairly flavorless muffin with a barely noticeable cream cheese topping. The recipe made 24 acceptable, but not outstanding muffins.

This is basically the first thing I've ever baked successfully! Haha.  I even got the cream cheese filling to work for the most part by trying it a different way for every group of six muffins(it wasn't a very BIG filling, but there was still a definite area that was just cream cheese).  To do this, all I did was add a little bit of batter to the bottom of a muffin cup, then used a spoon to make a sort of raised wall around one side.  I snuggled the filling against that wall and then added batter to the other sides of the muffin cup and over the top of the filling.  Most of them came out with no cream cheese on top but with a nice little section beneath the surface that tasted very good.

I didn't use pecans and I added 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice to the streusel topping (which I made a double dose of so I could pack it on, mmm hahaha).  The muffins turned out VERY good! =D I will definitely make these again, especially come Fall!

These were very nice muffins (as my co-workers who just happily gobbled down a bunch can attest!)  I'd make them again, but here's how I'd fine-tune the recipe: In the streusel, I'd use a little less flour, a bit more butter, and a bit of brown sugar.  Would also kick up the muffin's spiciness by adding some nutmeg to the batter.  And, I didn't like the idea of using olive oil, so I used vegetable oil and the texture was great - very tender.  Finally, these muffins are really not "cream cheese FILLED."  Instead, the thin cheesecake-like topping sits atop the muffin underneath the streusel.  Next time I may try adding a touch of flour to the cheese mixture and put more than 1 T. of the mixture in each muffin (Got leftover cheese mixture?  Use it to make an individual-sized cheesecake "tart."  I did and it was yummy and very cute!)

Yummy! The house smelled fantastic while these were cooking! I followed the recipe closely. I added a little extra vanilla to the batter, and I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon in the topping. It sounds like a lot of people are having issues with the filling being more of a topping. Put the cream cheese filling in a sandwich size ziploc bag and cut off the tip. Stick the tip of the bag about 3/4 of the way into the pumpkin batter (once in the muffin tin) and squeeze. Your muffins will have perfect cream cheese centers. Thanks for the recipe!

These muffins are the best! They are moist and very delicious....My husband thought they could win a prize for not only tasting great but looking so good as well! As others mentioned, I used veg. oil instead of olive oil. I highly recommend these muffins!!

I followed the recipe to a "T" except I didn't use a muffin pan. I used 9x13 pan. I didn't have time to fill each cupcake holder then cream cheese mixture then topping. It turned out great! The cream cheese mixture made it more dense  and moist but it made the pumpkin less in flavor. Next time I make this I'll add more pumpkin and allspice and cloves. My family and I really enjoyed this as a cake. Goes great with a cup of coffee!

Just a tip on how to keep the cream cheese mixture as a filling. Put just enough muffin batter in the tins to cover the bottom. Then, put 1 T. of the cream cheese mixture on top of the batter. Next, cover the cream cheese with remaining batter. This will keep the cream cheese as a filling.

I read all the reviews and  baked them ( they are so good), and here is my final "tweeking". The cream cheese filling is too runny, so I simply left out the egg & it turned out with a much better consistencey , more like the cheese cake centre I was looking for.I use white sugar for the cream cheese filling. For the topping I use brown sugar. I also used vegtable oil, not olive oil. I use nutmeg also in the batter, or sometimes I use the pumpkin  pie filling which has spices in it for that extra spice.I use paper liners in my muffin tins, put some batter in, then some cheese mixture, more batter & finally the topping and the cream cheese stays in the centre.I bake at 350 degrees also.  These are expensive to make , so I hope this helps all of you make perfect muffins!

these muffins were really good.  I did add nutmeg and ginger to spice them up a little.  The only thing I did not like was that the cream cheese was very loose and it just sat on top.  I would of liked a cream cheese surpise in the middle.  I would make them again though.

These were yummy!  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I know, from experience, that cinnamon wasn't going to be enough to spice a pumpkin flavored baked good.  Pumpkin is bland and generally needs more spice.  I added nutmeg, ginger and cloves.  The cream cheese mixture was runny, even after chilling.  I tried to keep it from touching the paper cups, but it ran no matter what I did.  I gave up and just put the cream cheese on top without worrying.  Didn't cause any problems with the baking or the removal of the muffin from the paper cup.  We have nut allergies in the home so instead of pecans, I used coconut and little nutmeg in the topping.  Will be saving this recipe and making it again!

Very tasty! The only change I made was to add a 1/4 tsp of cloves, nutmeg & allspice. It's a very easy recipe, definately a keeper. It makes your whole house smell like the holidays.  My husband and kids gobbled them up. ONE QUICK TIP: Put the C.cheese mixture in a storage bag, cut the tip, insert the tip into muffin mixture in the cups and squeeze a dallop. It keeps the cream cheese from rising to the top while baking.

Dry, not good at all.  I want to try it again because so many have liked it.  I wonder if I left something out. They were very cake-like.  And I could not taste the cream cheese filling at all.

I followed the recipe for everything except I added more spices (clove, fresh nutmeg, ginger). When making the batter, I accidentally dumped half of my container of cinnamon into the bowl. I tried to retrieve as much as I could but I should have just left it! [And then I should have added even more of the extra spices I put in!] The muffin is bland even with the extra spice. Every single one of them burned a bit on the bottom, even though I baked at 350 instead of 375 for 20 minutes. And yes, I have an oven thermometer, so I know the oven is accurate. Had no problems with the cream cheese part, however it was bland as well. The strudel part (which is usually my fave part) was also lackluster. I cut the bottom 2/3 off and kept the very top of the muffin. Honestly, I don't think even those will get eaten though. I would not make these again - I feel like I wasted my time and my money.

BEST MUFFINS I'VE EVER HAD!! (nevermind ever made). These are fantastic! I don't even really like pumpkin but these are so good.  Only changes were to add a few pinches of nutmeg to the batter,  melt the butter and add it to the dry ingredients for the topping and to use an additional tablespoon of flour and brown sugar in the crumble topping. I cooked them at 375 for 21 minutes. I brought some into work and am getting tons of compliments.  Next I'm going to try a blueberry cream cheese and maybe a carrot cake cream cheese muffin.  I would think all I have to do is substitute a blueberry muffin or carrot cake muffin batter for the pumpkin batter.  Also, it isn't too time consuming if you get three bowls out, get all of your dry ingredients measured out and then go down the line, adding wet ingredients and mixing up each one.  Couldn't have taken me more than 15 minutes to put together.

After reading several of the reviews, I decided to modify these a little bit.  I increased the cinnamon in the muffin batter to a full tablespoon and added a teaspoon of nutmeg and a teaspoon of ground cloves.  I also added an extra 1/3 cup of pumpkin for moisture.  I found the solution to the "soupy" cream cheese problem.  Use only the egg white instead of the whole egg and don't over-mix it and it turns out perfect.  I followed the advice of several reviewers and put a little batter, then some cream cheese, then a little more batter in the paper liners.  I didn't have any pecans, so I used quick cooking oats instead.  With these modifications, the muffins were exquisite!

needed more flavor - added cinnamon & allspice, but still needed more.  easy recipe that went over well, but putzy to prepare (batter up sides, cream cheese in middle, batter on top, etc.).  i will make them again with added spice and time on hands.

Delicious and SO moist! A perfect treat for Autumn. Here are a few things I would suggest:
-Triple the streusel topping and use brown sugar instead of white sugar
-Refrigerate topping and cream cheese mixture after preparing them until ready to use. This keeps the butter pieces firm and the cream cheese from getting too runny.
-Use a 2 Tbs. scoop to get the perfect amount of batter in each muffin cup. Also makes for an easy release of the batter into the cups without making a mess. (Makes 24 muffins)
-I did them at 375 for 18 min and they were a little too brown on the bottom, but still very moist. I will try turning down the heat to 350 next time.

These were very good after a few changes (thanks everyone for the suggestions!). I used part brown and part white sugar in the muffins to improve the moisture, added some extra sugar to the cream cheese (wished I would've used powdered sugar in that), and added extra cinnamon, some nutmeg, and cloves to the batter. I put a little batter on the bottom of my muffin cups, used a scoop to drop in a large dollop of cream cheese, covered that with the rest of the batter, then finished with the streusel. There was no problem with the cream cheese staying in the center. I also baked them at 350 degrees. I had just enough cheese mixture and topping for 19 muffins, so I made two plain (I obviously got 21 muffins out of this recipe). They rose very high and did not overflow even though the cups were pretty full. They look great and are very moist. I have noticed with pumpkin bread that the flavor improves after a day, so I am interested if these will taste better tomorrow. I shared these and everyone thought they were great. Thanks.

There were good BUT the cream cheese filing is definitely more of a cheese cake topping...

Love the idea of cream cheese pumpkin muffins.  That said, these aren't what I'm looking for.  All I can really seem to taste is the salt/baking powder.  I barely added any salt, so I'm assuming it's the baking powder.  Strange.  I was out of pumpkin pie spice, but I would add that if I made these again.  Also, the cream cheese filling needs to be covered by the pumpkin, otherwise it tastes weird and it gets kind of crusty.

I used a plastic bag with one corner cut off to pipe the cream cheese filling into the center of each muffin.  These were quick and easy to make, but look very fancy and impressive.  They are a favorite of my guests and coworkers!

These are delicious and an exercize in "getting everything even".  I made the cream cheese layer exactly, I used brown sugar, more spices and more pecans in the streussel layer. I subbed one cup ap flour with 1 cup white whole wheat, 1 c. sugar for brown sugar and used Healthy Balance instead of olive oil. I got 24 regular muffins but was short on the cheese layer and had some muffin batter left over. Next time I'll use the whole can of pumpkin and adust the other ingredients, and plan for a few mini's. . . and there will be a next time. I've eaten two and I quickly rushed 12 to my neighbors. Thanks for sharing!

These were awesome.  I added a pinch of nutmeg, allspice and clove. I did not do the strusel topping.  The key with these is to fill each muffin cup 2/3 of the way with the pumpkin batter than pipe the cream cheese batter into the middle.  I just used a ziploc bag and cut the tip off.  It worked perfect! Tasted and looked just like the ones at Starbucks!  This recipe made 12 Pumpkin cream cheese muffins and 20 plain pumpkin mini muffins.  Thanks. I will make these every year!

I give this recipe four stars, as I heavily modified it. In the batter, I used half whole wheat flour, half all purpose flour, 1.5 cups instead of 2 cups of white sugar, used a whole can of pumpkin instead of 1 1/3 cups, and added 1/4 t. nutmeg, 1/8 t. ginger, 1/2 t. extra cinnamon and 1/8 t. cloves. I also used 2 egg substitutes (1/4 c. applesauce plus 1/4 t. baking soda for lightness per egg) and 1/4 cup of apple sauce plus 1 T. of oil of canola oil. I made HUGE muffins, so this recipe gave me 12 REALLY BIG muffins. For the streusel topping, I melted the butter instead of just adding it in, did not use nuts (as I did not have any), and used brown sugar instead of white sugar. The muffins are great!

For the cream cheese filling, I did not use an egg, as I did not want it to be soupy. And be sure not to beat it until it is creamy. A few lumps are what you want. In the cream cheese filling, I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I made my muffins by layering them. Some batter on the bottom, then cream cheese, some more batter, then the streusel topping. I also did not have any muffin cups, so I just greased and floured my pan REALLY well (be sure to grease and flour them heavily, otherwise they will stick). I baked my muffins at 350 degrees for 30 minutes or so. I'm not totally sure though, as I pulled them out of the oven when they looked cooked. Next time, I would double the cream cheese filling and the streusel topping.

These muffins turned out perfect!  I made sure my cream cheese mixture was stiff and I made a well in each muffin for the cream cheese so that it could not run to the sides.  I used grape seed oil instead of olive oil and I omitted the pecans.  I also lightly pressed the streusel topping into the muffin.  My muffins looked so beautiful and tasted fabulous!  I got several requests for the recipe!

Awesome..If you want to know how to make these perfect: DON'T be afraid to use olive oil! It makes them good.I used about 1/4 cup less than the recipe calls for.If you think the batter is too thick it's not! Just keep scraping the bottom of the bowl to mix well. Also I used PUMPKIN PIE SPICE,(1 to 2 tsp) in the struesel and also the batter, PLUS a few shakes of cinnamon! ADD some brown sugar in place of white in the batter. I only had a 6-muffin tray and baked for about 25 minutes, so you may have to adjust baking time.Trust me, these changes make them perfect!!

Well, I wanted to add a review to all the others, since I read so many conflicting ones.  I gave this recipe a 4 because I did have to add extra spices (as I heeded the suggestions in the reviews ), but it was great with those slight changes.  And I did use one cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of brown and added a little bit of milk (it really was so thick like I also read).  I am not sure how it would have tasted with cinnamon alone.  I did forget to add the butter to my streusel topping, but they were fine without it (and less those fat and calories).  That was just a silly oversight as I am not a novice baker, but I found the recipe a little hard to follow.  They should give each set of ingredients headings because when you print it out, they are all listed together and you really have to be careful you don't miss anything (like I did)!  Overall, I was pleased with them.  I did eat one when warm, and I know the flavor will really come out after cooling.  Oh, and I also omitted the egg in the filling.  Kudos to all the ladies who write in, as I find all the reviews quite helpful.  I never make a recipe without reading them first!  Happy cooking and baking!

These were not moist or fluffy. They were also lacking in flavor. They sounded so good, but alas, they were tough and unflavorful.

these were vey good and easy to make. I tried to make a well in the muffin to put the filling in but it would close up before I could get the filling there. Still it made a very nice layer on the top under the crunchy topping.

The recipe called from canned pumpkin and I used frozen pumpkin from our freezer. Instead of using cinnamon, I used pumpkin pie spice.  I used my cookie scoop and placed two scoops of batter  in each liner. Then, I placed one scoop of cream cheese filling in the center of each muffin.  I sprinkled the streusel topping on top.  I ran out of topping and left six muffins plain.  The six plain ones were much better and I would rate them 5 star.  Those six  tasted like pumpkin bread with cream cheese.  The streusel topping added too much sweetness.  I used regular sized muffin tins with paper liners and my yield was 30 muffins. They looked bakery made!

Goodness! How wonderful these muffins were! Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. Second batch I changed things up slightly: filled muffins cups about 1/4 C with batter, indenting it slightly for the filling. Added a heaping tablespoon of filling. Then filled the rest of the muffin cup with the batter and skipped the streusel topping (though these are also excellent with the topping, too!). Made muffins with canola oil instead of olive oil. Added more cinnamon. Ate more than I should've!

I wanted these to be like Starbuck's pumpkin cream cheese muffins and they aren't. The cream cheese becomes a crusty coating rather than a tunnel of cream. The olive oil is an odd addition but doesn't add olive flavor. They are moist and pale though in comparison to the deep rich orange color of Starbuck's. I probably wouldn't make them again but try another recipe.

I left the eggs out of the cream cheese and used it as a filling, rather than a topping. The muffins came out really nice with the cream cheese inside and the crumbs on top, I don't think I'd make it any other way if I make these again.

Loved it! I made a few changes. Only had 1 cup of pumpkin left so made up the difference with crushed pineapple. Also, used a Splenda/Sugar mix.
They turned out wonderfully. I think the key with the cream cheese staying in tact, is to use the real deal. Philadelphia is the best, the generic stuff is fine for spreads, etc. But when baking, I've found the generics just do not hold their shape like the Kraft brand. So that's my main suggestion, spend the buck or so extra, get Kraft Phildelphia, and you'll get a more solidified cream cheese center.
These are super, you wont be sorry!

oh wow... pretty tasty :)My boyfriend loves them and so do I... They take some effort, but if you follow the directions, they turn out great. I kept my cream cheese mixture in the freezer until I needed it, and it spread just perfectly and wasnt runny at all. If you leave the egg out of the cream cheese mix, it will not be able to set up properly. To make my "wells" i wet my finger just slightly and hollowed out a small hole. I did add some extra spice, and they had a really good pumpkin flavor. These are better than the ones at starbucks!! They are also pretty enough to give as gifts, or serve to company!

These muffins are OUTSTANDING!!! I made them twice, once with the olive oil for my boyfriend and once with applesauce in its place for myself. Both times, they turned out great, light and moist. They are also great with a buttercream icing with some of the pumpkin mixed in.

As written the recipe really only deserves a 3 star, but gave it a 4 because the "bones" really are great and lend themselves to many variations.  

Not really fond of the muffins, but when I ran out of topping I did this with the leftover batter and LOVED it!!!

-Poured leftover batter into a loaf pan, about 1 in deep.
 - Made two little wells long way down the loaf, filled them with a generous amount of the cheese mixture and gently marbled the top.  
 - Grabbed a big handful of brown sugar and sprinkled over the top, then sprinkled on some pecans, and drizzled (ok, poured - I love butter) over the top before baking.
 - Once cooled a little, slice into bars and they are delish!  Liked the topping this way MUCH better.

Thoughts:
1) Batter and cream cheese mixture is plenty to make 24 muffins, but you would need to double the topping.  
2) Don't use extra virgin olive oil, too strong.  Use light olive oil or vegetable oil or applesauce.
3) These are VERY bland if you don't add more spice than the recipe calls for...at least double the cinnamon and/or add additional spice.
4) As others have noted, thoroughly creaming the cheese mixture is not such a good idea...it gets too runny with not such a great texture.  Use cold cheese and mix it just enough.  
5) Also, this makes a TOPPING of baked cheese rather than a filling.  Even making a well it ended up baking into a topping.  If you can get your pumpkin batter thicker, then perhaps you can slightly bury the cheese in it.

This is a good recipe.  I used a few different ingredients and my muffins came out moist and delicious.  I used 2/3 cups of turbinado sugar.  I used 2 1/2 cups of organic pastry flour.  I used 1 teaspon of ginger.  3/4 teaspon of nutmeg.  I also added pecans to the batter.  I reduced sugar alot. I did use eggs or oil.  I used 1/3 cup of applesauce instead of oil.

I made these as written and thought they were just okay. They were a bit too dry and I could barely taste the pumpkin flavor. I was hoping for a yummy moist pumpkin muffin and these were not even close. If I ever made these again, I would add the whole can of pumpkin and a bit more oil, add some pumpkin pie spice, and add white sugar to the cream cheese mixture instead of the brown sugar. I wanted to see the nice color contrast of the cheese with the pumpkin color and there was none with the brown sugar added mixture. The recipe says to try and not let it hit the muffin liner, but I say just load it on because the more cheese you add, the better the taste.

These are a good base.  I made them straight off the recipe and they were, OK.  The cream cheese filling is awful.  I don't know how anyone got it in the middle, ever.  Next time I plan on using a different recipe for that involving freezing and putting a cube in the batter.  Anyways, the dough is heavy, needs something more than cinnamon, otherwise it's OK.  I will make it again, doctored up.

This was good but not great.  I think these are very labor intensive as muffins.  Made one pan and than pulled out a loaf pan and made the rest of the batter in there.  The muffins came out dry and not very flavorful.  The loaf on the other hand, came out very moist and was hands down the winner.  Not sure I'll make this again.  I have a number of pumpkin recipes I like better.

Great recipe I used pumpkin pie filling instead of purée and it was fantastic. I did cut down on the sugar a bit to compinsate. Made baby muffins too and cooked for about fifteen min.

We really liked this muffin but for some reason i had quite a bit of left over batter after filling the 18 cupcake liners, but wouldn't  have had enough of the cream cheese filling for more.

I made these on a whim and OH MY GOSH! I have people asking me for both the recipe and more muffins every time. My fiance LOVES these.
One note: Make sure to put a legitimate crater inside the center of the muffin for the cream cheese--didn't do it one time and the muffins were significantly altered.

By far, one of my favorite muffins. Every time I make them, my husband won't stop raving about them and he'll start handing them out to anybody who stops by. The kids love them too and ALWAYS ask for more. They are amazing and even more so the next day when the cream cheese ages.

Pretty good muffin. The cream cheese mixture does not necessary bake down into the muffin but rather thins out and stays on top with not a very noticable cream cheese taste.  I yielded 24 muffins.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I love this recipe!  I make it bariatric friendly and use fat free or reduced fat cream cheese. I cut the sugar in half and make up the difference with Splenda. I up the pumpkin a bit to add flavor. You couldn't tell the difference!

Very very tasty!  Though I ran out of the cream cheese mixture , but I think that is because I didn't fill the first batch up far enough with the pumpkin batter.

Two days prior, I made pumpkin muffins from a recipe I found online from the Gourmet November 2006 issue, which came out fantastic, however this recipe with the cream cheese "filling" was drawing me to make this one. I just made these and will not be adding this one to my collection - they were too sweet, too dense, and the filling that I had pictured oozing out of the middle when I ate them was the biggest disappointment. It was more like a thin topping that got lost under a sugar coating. I suppose I could tweak the recipe like the other reviewers had, but why bother when there are better recipes out there!

Not sure what I did wrong. The cream cheese and egg mixture ended up like scrambled eggs or a mini quiche in the middle of my muffin.

While these were very nice in terms of crumb and texture, the cream cheese mixture was way too thin to manage.  Next time, I'll just use the yolk as it was far too runny to place in the batter.  I thought they had enough flavor when a bit of pumpkin pie spice was added - not sure it needed the topping, it made them almost too sweet.  I almost cut it out and added some golden raisins.  I did cut back on the brown sugar by half and replaced it with molasses, which made the cakes more flavorful.  Next time I will use this as a 9 x 9 cake and frost it with a cream cheese frosting.

Delicious Muffin, not real spicy, but still very good.  I didn't want part of a can of pumpkin left over, so I scaled the recipe for 27 muffins. (which  calls for 2 cups of pumpkin.) Since I baked 12 first, I followed the recipe, putting the cream cheese on top, then the streusel. I ate one before filling the second pan. It was wonderful, but just to experiment, for the 2nd pan, I put a small amount of batter in the muffin cup, topped it with the cream cheese, more batter on top, ending with the streusel. Now that the 2nd pan is done, I think I like it better with the cream cheese on top as the recipe calls for: the cream cheese bakes a little drier and looks prettier.  These look like gourmet bakery muffins. I will put at least a dozen in the freezer to pull out this weekend when we'll have company.  The next time I make them I will add about 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp each allspice, cloves, and nutmeg to  make them a bit spicier. These will be Wonderful this Fall!

3 words. To. Die. For. Ok, 4. Delicious. These have got to be hands down the prettiest muffins I have ever made. They taste just as good as they look. Such a brilliant idea. I followed the recipe save for swapping out 1/4 cup of the flour with wheat germ and lowering the sugar in the muffin batter by 1/2 cup. They were just fine with those changes. I didn't and wouldn't change another thing. Moist, flavorful, and the topping was literally the 'icing on the cake'. If you like pumpkin muffins, get to the kitchen with this recipe in hand! Quick! **Just an update: these muffins keep very well, loosely covered on the counter or covered and refrigerated ~ reheated on low in the microwave, I think they might even be better as the topping caramelizes, the flavor intensifies and they are still so moist. This has become my new favorite recipe.

excellent muffins, subbed apples for oil, used 3/4c w sugar and 3/4c brown sugar and added 1/2 cup wheat germ and 1/2c ground flax-trying to eat healthy and all. I followed a review stating cream cheese mixture is a toppin not an insert into muffins. Great recipe thank you, will make again

Wonderful muffins!  I made many of the recommended changes.  I added more spices to the batter (1/2t allspice, cloves, 1 t nutmeg, 1/4 t ginger).  It would have been bland without these.  I used 15 oz of pumpkin, and substituted canola oil.  Somehow I messed up the streusel.  I may oats to it next time.

The cream cheese didn't work out for me at all, but I would make them again without it for sure! I might add brown sugar instead of white to the batter next time.

So so pretty! A bit of work though. And my cream cheese was runny, with chunks, and didn't look right, so I added a half a box more cheese. I dolloped it right on top just like the recipe says, and it came out perfect, just like those famous Starbucks ones. I also skipped the nuts and stirred a bag of dried cranberries right into the batter. I used veggie oil instead of olive oil, and added pumpkin pie spice, since I was low on cinnamon. I wish they were a little bit more pumpkiney tasting, but I think, short of pumpkin extract, it would be hard to achieve. My whole family loved these, and I sent a big batch to the fire house with my husband too! This recipe makes about 36 muffins, twice what I expected, which was awesome!

AMAZING!!  I made only a few changes, the biggest being that I used pumpkin pie filling insted of just canned pumpkin. With the cream cheese mixture I didn't beat it until it was smooth for fear that it would be to runny, there were still small lumps of cream cheese left when I was done mixing. I also add a few dashes of nutmeg to both the batter and the topping... gave it amazing flavor! I baked them just over 20 mins and they came out extreamly moist! I can't wait until my husband comes home and gets to try these... he is going to love them!

I thought these muffins had a great texture, but were too sweet for my personal taste. I like my muffins for breakfast and like more of a "flavorful" muffin- these, to me, tasted kind of bland... with an overpowering sweetness. I couldn't taste much of the pumpkin flavor and I thought it needed more spices added to the recipe...ie: nutmeg, etc. In all fairness though, I didn't use the cream cheese mixture- I just made the plain pumpkin muffins. If I try them again, I will leave off the streusel topping, and add more pumpkin and spices.

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems. I did start with refrigerator cold cream cheese though, and just used the beaters on it briefly before adding the egg and vanilla. I then beat until just mixed, then added the brown sugar and beat again until just mixed. After that I put it in the freezer until I needed it. I filled the muffin cups 3/4 full instead of half and I made a resevior in each and added a spoonful of the stiff cream cheese mixture. I sprinkeled on the topping and patted it down a little. I ended up with 12 large beautiful muffins that have a definate cream cheese layer on top. Delicious! I did bake 28 minutes instead of 25. I will make these again for sure. A lot of steps but relatively easy.

I made these yesterday and I thought they came out very good.  I followed someone else suggestion and left the cream cheese mixture a little lumpy and then put in in the refrigerator until needed . Also I made a few changes that others suggested and added a pinch of nutmeg and pinch of cloves. I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil. and I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I used fresh pumpkin puree. I think they are better after cooled and the streusel topping is a must.

Delicious!  But the quantities were a little heavy and light:  The recipe made 24 Big cupcakes (filled 3/4 full), and I ran out of streusel topping. I would increase the topping amts. to 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 6 Tbsp butter, 1/2 cup nuts, and add 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg.

YUM!! These muffins are very good and very pumpkiny. The topping was more pasty than crumbly, but still very good. I didn't use paper cups either, just buttered and floured the muffin pan. I found that if you cover the cream cheese with some of the batter, you get the desired filling effect instead of an icing. The dough is very sticky, but it makes it easy to mold and form a well for the cream cheese filling. Definately a keeper.

This totally exceeded my expectations.  Not being a big fan of pumpkin I was worried it might taste too much like pumpkin pie.  Boy, was I wrong.  The texture was light and airy and they baked up so nicely.  I felt they were a little time consuming to make, so next time I am going to make it as a loaf. I have a lot of company coming in for Thanksgiving and I plan on making several loafs to serve for a quick and yummy breakfast.

Fantastic muffins!  I used vegetable oil rather than olive, and I added nutmeg to the batter.  The cream cheese mixture didnt sink, it made a nice little cream cheese layer at the top.  Delicious, I'll make these again for sure.

These are great. I made with Neufchatel cheese  (1/3 of the fat instead of the cream cheese) and I cut the sugar totally in half.. and they were still yum! I only baked them for 20 mins. They came out so moist and delicious. I also omitted the pecans from the streusel topping and adding brown sugar instead. Delicious.

This is a super delicious recipie! I don't even normally like pumpkin very much but I was craving something pumpkiny and cream cheesy and so I tried these and they were top notch! I made half into a coffeecake and half into muffins. I got the cream cheese in the middle by filling my muffin pan half full, making a little "well", spooning in the cream cheese and then filling it with batter. For the coffeecake I just dropped it in blobs on top and ran a knife through it! I got rave reviews!! Will definitly make again!!

A huge hit every time!  I like to use fresh pumpkin for a less-intense pumpkin taste.  I also will sometimes double the cream cheese & streusel topping!

These muffins are amazing!!  They turned out so well.  They are a little labor intensive, but not really too bad.  I had fun making them and all the people that I shared them with, thought they were delicious too.  I brought a few to work the next day and all my coworkers raved about them.  A few even asked for the recipe.  Will definitely use this recipe for years to come.

These were great...I used vegetable oil, added a little extra pumpkin and added extra spices after reading some of the reviews.  They were moist and flavorful. Thank you! :)

This was an amazing muffin - my husband and coworkers snatched them all up so fast!  The things I did were: 
mixed the cream cheese with other ingredients while the cheese was still cold. this came out very lumpy but well mixed. I then put this into another bowl and kept it in the fridge while I made the other two layers. Important b/c my kitchen was getting warm and it would have been soupy if I kept it out.  
Then mixed the topping, used walnuts and brown sugar b/c that's what I had - amazing!! 
Nothing special for the muffin batter except I used my kitchenaid and the paddle attachment, mixed until just incorporated then stopped it and finished with a hand spatula, do not want to overmix!  I also ran out of AP flour and used bread flour, it came out fine!  Used Vegetable oil instead of Olive oil (I only had EVOO).  In addition I took some others' advice and added more spices. Maybe 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, then an extra dash of nutmeg and cloves, sooo good!!  

I used an ice cream scoop about half full and the muffin batter perfectly half-filled 24 muffin cups, then used my fingers to make a small indent in each. used my melon baller to put a dab of the cream cheese mixture in the middle of each and then sprinkled with the topping. They came out perfect and amazing in 20minutes!!  Will definitely make again. thank you!! A new fall favorite.

EXCELLENT! So Moist!!! (I only baked about 17 minutes though) I cut the corner off of a plastic baggie to use as a pastry bag for the cream cheese filling, worked great to keep it wear you want it. Brought these to work and everyone loved them! I never bake (because i havent had the best of luck with baking...) but these I will definately make again! Probably for the holidays :) 5 Stars!

Yum!  I really like these muffins.  I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie, but I love pumpkin in breads or other desserts, so this was right up my alley.  Although a bit time consuming, these are worth it.  They could use more spices like allspice and nutmeg, I suppose, but I still like them as is.  Good thing, since I got 24 muffins out of this.  We had company over today and they ate some, and I'll take some to work, but we still will have some to gobble up ourselves.  I really like the combo of pumpkin, cheesecake, and streusal topping.  Thanks for the recipe!

yum, yum, yum, yum, YUM! these muffins were absolutely TO DIE FOR!! They were very moist and just soooooo delicious. My family loved them so much; they finished all the muffins that i made in one day, and then insisted that i make more! i made these again to take to a potluck, and everyone was asking me for the recipe! i skipped the topping and instead of the filling, i iced them with the cream cheese frosting II recipe on this website. i also added a little bit more cinnamon, but that's about all i changed. this is a GREAT recipe, thanks for sharing!!

Delicious!! The flavors went together excellently, the batter was perfect and easy to work with, and they baked exactly like the recipe said. The only thing I would do differently is add more spices next time, but even without extra the muffins were wonderful. And btw, they are phenomenal when they're hot, fresh out of the oven! :) Thanks for the great recipe.

mmmm these are so good! The only things I changed were using 1c. brown sugar and 1c. white sugar in the muffin batter. My crumble topping didn't turn out due to my butter being too warm so I only placed halved pecans on top and it was to die for! To make the cream cheese into a filling instead of an icing I layered a spoonful of muffin batter on the bottom, followed by a tbsp of cream cheese, and topped with another spoonful of muffin batter.

Wow!  These turned out great!  After reading the reviews I experimented.  With the first batch, I tried to make sure the filling was surrounded/hidden in the batter, to make sure it come out as "filling".  The second batch, I created a little "well" in the middle of the batter & put in a dollop of filling, so it was still visible.  Then I sprinkled the crumb topping on top of that.  This latter batch was so much better.  The cream cheese was not "filling", but a layer of cream cheese all over the top of the muffin  (with the crumb topping on top of that.  It made the cream cheese much more enjoyable, almost like frosting to a cupcake.  I wish I had done them all like that.  The recipe, as is, made 21 muffins, but I did fall short on crumb topping.  I'd double that next time.  I will definitely do this recipe again.  This was awesome!

I made a few changes to this recipe after reading the reviews.  In addition to cinnamon, I added ground cloves, nutmeg, all spice and ginger spice (about 1 teaspoon each).  This added pleasantly to the flavour but, I'd actually double the amounts next time for even more flavour.  Also used cream cheese icing on top instead of the filing.  Good recipe overall but, definitely needs some tweeking!

The muffins are delicious! I expected them to by dry, but not at all. I've made them twice and both times I made a couple of minor changes. I used canola oil instead of olive oil and I added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg to the muffin batter. I liked the extra kick it added. I chose to make a double batch of the streusel because I ran out of it the first time around and I piped the filling on instead of spooning it on. Will definately make it again!

YUM! These are the perfect treat for Autumn time. I really liked how easy these are to make and how moist they are. I found that the cake part is more of a cupcake than a muffin, but that is no problem with me. In the batter I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and just used 1 1/2 cups of sugar. For the topping made my own up here's what I did....1/3 cup flour, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 3 tbsp. chopped pecans, and 3 tbsp. melted butter. Thanks for the great recipe I will be making these for many years to come!

These were tasty, in a regular size muffin cup it didn't seem like I could get enough cream cheese in the middle. I would like to try them as jumbo muffins. The recipe is the exact amount of all 3 items for 23-24 muffins.

Very Good Muffins. I up-ed the pumpkin to 1 1/2 cups for a more moist muffin, but it still turned out a little on the dry side. I might have slightly over mixed though, so I might have to make another batch to see. If you fill each standard-sized muffin tin with about 1/8 cup of the pumpkin filling, then cover that with about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture, then spread another 2 tablespoons of the pumpkin mixture over that you will have an actual cream cheese filled muffin. I went without the streusel topping and they were great.

I did not care for this recipe.  The muffins are very dense, way too sweet and the mixing method makes them unpalatable.  I did not like the consistency.

These are ok, but they were kind of plain.  I thought there would be more of a pumpkin flavor, but it wasn't very strong.  We liked the streusal, though, so will probably use that on top of my standard pumpkin muffin.

These were pretty good, except that I could taste the baking powder in the finished product and it took away from the yumminess quotient.I would HALVE THE BAKING POWDER next time for sure.

These came out perfectly. I did add a little bit (about 1/2 tsp) of pumpkin pie spice. I filled the muffin cup up about 1/3 of the way, then put a dolip of the cream cheese mixture, and then a little more batter and they were perfect. I will absolutly make these again!

These are good but not my favorite pumpkin muffin/bread recipe. My favorite is still the Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread, it just has really great pumpkin flavor.  I do like the cream cheese filling idea though. I made 4 muffins and a loaf of bread with this recipe. I "filled" the muffins as the recipe said, but for the bread I ladeled in to about 1/3 the loaf pan. Then took a spoon and smoothed a "long ditch" down the center of the batter. Spooned in the cream cheese filling, then spooned in batter on the sides of the cream cheese filling to create walls to hold the filling in. Then I ladeled the batter over the top and added the crumb topping. It turned out very pretty when sliced. I will be posting a picture soon. Next time I make pumpkin bread I will be going back to the Downeast recipe and maybe I'll fill it with the cream cheese filling from this one!

simply fantastic!  I saw that a lot of people found that the cream cheese baked out to be a topping instead of a filling...but I used two pastry bags to move things along in a neat way. First put a little of the pumpkin mix....then a dab of the cream cheese filling (there will be pleanty left over so you can go heavy on it...it makes the muffin super moist) and then when you put more pumpkin mix on top its okay if it doesn't cover the filling completely, it'll bake out just fine.  I doubled up on the recipie and gave it out as a warming fall gift to family and friends...they're begging for more!

Holy Pumpkin, Cream cheese goodness! I used a ziploc bag w/ the corner cut off to get the filling into the middle of the muffins. They were gone in 2 days!

Great recipe.  I used white sugar instead of brown sugar in the cream cheese and I also added about a teaspoon of pumpkin spice to it.  To get the cream cheese in the middle not just on top, I took a condiment container and put the cheese mix in it.  Then I just squeezed a bit into the center of the muffin.  It worked great.

We LOVED these. I did modify them a bit though. I used splenda instead of sugar, margarine instead of butter and nearly fat free cream cheese instead of regular. You would think they would be bland and tasteless with these modifications- but they were still great (and much healthier). I also used fresh pumpkin and steamed and mashed it (they don't sell canned where I live in Australia). I used about 2 cups of pumpkin and I think that is why they came out a lot more dense and gooey rather than fluffy like a muffin. People actually said that the dense gooey texture is what they really liked- so I think when I make these again, I'll stick to the extra pumpkin! I also made them in a mini muffin pan so they were perfect little sized muffins to eat with a cup of tea.

I just finished making these and had one - really delicious and different, but I made a lot of changes.  It seemed more like a cupcake than a muffin with all the sugar, so I wanted to make it more like a cupcake/dessert rather than a muffin/breakfast.  (1) For the filling, I left out the egg and added nutmeg.  I love cheesecake, but based on the reviews, I really wanted a cream cheese FILLING, not a cheesecake topping. I had more than enough filling.  (2) To the crumbly topping, I added chopped crystallized ginger in place of the pecans.  A yummy addition, but it doesn't add crunch if that's what you're looking for.  I would make more crumbly topping since I ran out & it's really hard to mix up a tad bit more crumbly topping for 2-3 more cupcakes... (3) For the CUPCAKE part, I reduced the flour to 2 cups, reduced the sugar to about 1.5 cups - it was plenty sweet, added baking powder AND soda (about 2 tsp of each), and instead of cinnamon, I used pumpkin pie spice.  (4) To make the cupcakes, I filled each liner about 2/3 full, then I put a dollop of the cream cheese on top and using my finger, shoved it into the batter until only a bit of it was showing on top.  Then I spooned some crumbly topping on the middle.  You don't need too much and no need to spread it all around - when it bakes, it will expand and spread out on its own.  Wait for it to cool completely before trying to remove from the liners!  I couldn't wait and it was a tiny bit stuck.

Oh my gosh! These are AWESOME!!!! I followed the recipe, and after reading other reviews decided to pipe in the cream cheese with a tip cut off a plastic baggie, just pipped it into the middle of the pumpkin batter and then topped with the topping.  Worked like a charm.  These are now my most favorite muffin ever!

I used this recipe to make a 9x13 layer coffee cake rather than muffins and it turned out wonderful!  I love cream cheese and would probably increase the cream cheese layer by 1.5 next time.

I did not have a good experience with these.  First of all, I think it's odd that it calls for white sugar and not brown sugar in a pumpkin dessert recipe.  Also, olive oil in a dessert??  I did substitute 1/2 c brown sugar for 1 c of the white sugar.  I filled the cupcake papers 1/2 full with batter (alarmingly thick!) made an indentation for the cream cheese filling, then put a dollop of batter on top of the cream cheese.  They looked great when they came out, but it took about 20 extra minutes to bake them, and then I found they burned on the bottom and were almost rock hard.  I, like another reviewer, ended up just pulling off the top 1/4 of the muffin w/ the cream cheese and streusel.  Also, from what I could taste these were quite bland.  If I were to make these again I would use more brown sugar than white, use only brown sugar in the streusel topping, add some more spices and use vegetable or canola oil instead of olive oil.

I was dissappointed with the muffins.  I took them to a Halloween party and there were quite a few of them left.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The muffins were good, but were not worth the effort.  For a novice cook like myself, I found them to be somewhat difficult to make.

Wonderful muffins...loved by the entire family...the batter made 12 muffins, not 18 but about half of the cream cheese filling was left...would double the batter and topping to make 24 muffins and still have enough filling as the filling recipe is written

This is a great recipient if you know what your doing and carefully read the recipie. Its absolutely delish, but poorly written!

This has both a topping and a filling  to go on and in the batter- the filling calls for 1 egg while the batter calls for 2.

The 5 tbs of white sugar is for the streusel topping while the 2 cups is for the main batter.

I added subbed pumpkin spice for the cinnamon,  and added a tsp of pumpkin spice to both the filling and topping.  I also used brown sugar in both the filling and topping amd used 1/2 brown sugar foe the batter.  AMAZING!

Great recipe!  I made it a bit healthier by cutting sugar down by 60% and adding one dropperful of liquid stevia, replaced oil with a bit extra pumpkin and unsweetened applesauce (although I did add 2 tablespoons of canola), replaced half the flour with whole wheat pastry flour, and cut down butter in topping by 1/3.  Also used whole wheat pastry flour in topping.   Added a tablespoon of whole wheat pastry flour to cream cheese mixture to reduce runnyness.  Added some ground cloves and pumpkin pie spice.  Baked at 365 for 20 minutes.   Came out very moist, flavorful and delicious.  This one's a keeper.  Next time I' ll substitute egg beaters for 1/2 the eggs.

I made this recipe going heavy on the spices (for full pumpkin pie flavor) and went with gluten-free flour for a family member.  Came out delicious;  after freezing, they hold up well, only a little dry in the bottom section.  Great for breakfast with coffee.

These are LOVELY!  Made a few changes based on reviews...put the cream cheese mixture in the middle muffin.  I used muffin liners and I'm glad I did...the cream cheese kind of went to the outside of the muffin instead of staying in the middle (which is no biggie) though I might just try it on top like the recipe says next time.  Added a teaspoon of pumpkin spice (in addition to the cinnamon) to the batter.  And lastly, I used the whole can of pumpkin.  I almost skipped the topping (to avoid washing another dish), but I'm SURE glad I didn't.  It was delicious!

Too much work. They tasted good but took me an hour and a half to prepare. And where't all that great. Don't get me wrong they tasted good just not good enough to put that much work into.

I enjoyed this recipe and would make it again. However, next time I  would cut back on the flour in the struesel topping, add more cinnamon and perhaps some nutmeg, and add more pumpkin to the batter. The muffins were good but not as spiced and pumpkin-y as I was hoping.

These turned out great.  A very pretty muffin that looks hard to make but was very easy.  It was moist and delicious.  A definite keeper for Fall.

Excellent muffin! I made half the recipe and was able to get 10 muffins.  I used canola oil instead of olive oil, and fresh pumpkin. I also substituted 1/2 cup of white wheat flour. They look gorgeous! :)

I just made these and ate one warm. They taste good but not great. I made 12 in regular muffin pan with cupcake papers and 24 mini muffins without paper liners. Just took them out so don't know how well they will come out of the pan. The cream cheese is part of the topping and kind of disappears which was disappointing to me. I had a lot of the cheese mixture leftover and ended up throwing it out. I might try these again but with some tweaking. I should have made indentation in batter before adding cheese mixture like someone said in another review. I think my biggest mistake was not reading all the reviews before I started.

My new favorite recipe!!  As stated previously, the cream cheese is not a filling, but a topping. I even tried one batch with the cream cheese (mixed with nutella) layered under an extra layer of pumpkin mix, still not a filling. Place a pinch of Struesel smack on top of the muffin.  It melts and spreads perfectly on top.  Absolutely amazing!

These are awesome muffins.  I didn't taste the cream cheese part very much (maybe because I ate two of them just out of the oven...I imagine it will have more flavor after they've sat overnight or a few hours at least!).  But they are DELICIOUS!  Very moist, and the crunchy topping is perfect.  Made them just as the recipe stated and wouldn't change a thing.

These are wonderful! My husband also loves these. This recipe made 24 muffins and  I ended up making twice the streusel topping and using brown sugar.  I also used reduced fat cream cheese and chopped walnuts instead of pecans. I kept them in the oven about another 5 minutes too.  Would definitely make these again, delicious!

This is a great recipe for some really good cupcakes/muffins. The only thing i added was a little more pumpkin pie spice and some more ground cloves and cinnamon. These are pretty easy to make and taste so good. If you can get the cream cheese inside the muffin, it turns out a little better than just using it as a topping.

Pretty good.  I was trying to copy the Whole Foods muffin.  Not quite as good, but still good.  I made the following changes:  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, "pumpkin pie mix" instead of pumpkin (by mistake), more spices, no topping, doubled amount of filling, canola instead of olive oil, 1/2 dark brown sugar instead of all white sugar.  The filling was runny on top despite chilling it. Muffin part would not well, it was too runny.  Flavor was great.  I wonder if filling would be better with no egg.

The pumpkin is really prominent, and I didn't get any of the cream cheese flavor. I added my usual combination of spices that I put in a pumpkin pie in the muffin batter - 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, 1/2 tsp ground cloves - but the flavor was still lacking. I didn't have any pecans, so I toasted walnut for the topping, which added a lot of texture and flavor to the topping. This recipe makes a dense muffin, but I wanted something a bit lighter and more cake-like.

This was good but we didn't really taste the cream cheese. Don't overbeat the cream cheese mixture b/c it will get too soupy. I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour & applesauce instead of olive oil... wanted to make the recipe a lil bit healthier. The jumbo muffin pan (6 muffins in a pan) took 30 mins to cook & I made 12 jumbo muffins.

I followed the recipe exactly, made half the muffins and found them seriously lacking in spice. I added some nutmeg and cloves to the second half and that helped.

Well! Delicious recipe - thank you! I did make the changes with spices that other reviewers suggested - 1tsp of cloves and 1tsp of nutmeg - GREAT addition. I improvised a bit with the topping, 3 tbsp of brown sugar instead of white, turned out great for me! Gorgeous product as well :)

Pretty good.  I used fresh pumpkin that may have a different flavor than canned unseasoned pumpkin as I found these kind of blah.  I did add the recommended pumpkin pie spice (1 tsp), used 2 tsp brown sugar for the streudel and veg oil instead of olive oil.  Definitely would consider making these again, though maybe w/canned pumpkin.

I was pretty disappointed with these muffins as they tasted nothing like pumpkin. The cream cheese filling had a very wattery consistency and once dropped into the muffin batter it spread over the top leaking onto the sides. The muffins were moist but because of the lack of pumpkin flavor I was not thrilled with the outcome.

These were pretty easy to make.. Which I love! The only thing they were lacking for me was sweetness. I love super sweet muffins, and the batter needs a little more sugar for my taste. Everyone else in my house liked them though! Overall good recipe though!

Delicious!  I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg & 1/2 tsp ginger.  Next time I will try it with some cloves added as well.  I used a Pampered Chef mini tart pan, and that needed only 10-12 minutes in the oven.  I also used a Wilton mini muffin pan, and that needed 15 minutes in the oven (the muffin cups are slightly bigger in than the Pampered Chef pan).

As-is, these muffins are only okay. I followed the recipe exactly, and while they aren't bad, they're nothing great, either. It's not that they're totally bland, just that they could do with a little MORE flavor. Even my sweet-loving niece wasn't very enthusiastic about these. They bake well, are moist, don't stick to the pan, and look pretty - they just need a little more flavor.

I love pumpkin anything, so I thought I'd really like these. They were kind of dry and didn't have enough spice for my liking. I will probably not make them again.

I made these this weekend, and they were an absolute HIT with my hubby (who thinks he doesn't like pumpkin) and coworkers (who demanded I bring more to work tomorrow). The only thing I changed was to add 1-2 Tbsp of brown sugar to the strusel topping because it seemed strange that there wasn't any, and next time I might add more. Delicious!

These are awesome warm from the oven but sooo much better a few days later! They just get better as time goes. I wasn't sure how important the cream cheese mixture would be until I tasted one of these totally yummy muffins. It gives it such a great creamy texture that's somewhat reminiscent of icing..but not. I did cut out 1/2 cup of the sugar b/c I knew it would suite our taste better but I changed nothing else. Love it!!

I made these muffins last night and they were a hit this morning when I brought them to work! I followed the recipe 99.9%, I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil, and these are so moist and flavorful!!! The combination of pumpkin cake/muffin and cream cheese is absolutely AMAZING!!!! The stuesel topping is really good. The batter is really sweet but the finished product is perfect! I noticed that a lot of people added nutmeg, allspice, cloves, etc I love the recipe the way it is but I will try it with all the different spices next time. This is a perfect way to begin the fall. Thanks so much for sharing!

These are incredible. I ate 3 last night which I immediately regretted, but they're that good. I used a piping bag with the tip cut off to fill the muffins with the cream cheese so it would be an actual filling. I made 19 muffins and wish I had made just a tad more struesel topping. Although, had I not omitted the pecans (which I'll probably include next time) it might have been close to enough. I added some pumpkin pie spice and subbed a 1/2 cup of brown sugar for white. Also, I used canola oil instead of olive, mainly because I buy expensive olive oil and didn't want to use that much in muffin batter! 20 minutes was just right for my oven. I will make these again and again and again. They're amazing!

These are very good, although I think they have to be warmed up in the microwave to be truly enjoyed.  I followed the recipe, with the one addition of some pumpkin pie spice to the muffin batter.  I put it together as the recipe states and also tried hiding the cream cheese in the middle.  I think I like it the way it was written the best.

These muffins were wonderful!  I used a 15oz can of pumpkin just b/c I didn't want to discard the rest so I added about a 1/2 cup more flour and 1/4 cup more sugar.  I wouldn't add the extra sugar next time b/c I don't think it really needed it.  I also added pumpkin pie spice and ground cloves as others had suggested and it turned out perfectly!  I used canola oil instead of olive oil.  Mine made 24 muffins and I doubled the topping as others had suggested and it was the perfect amount for 24 the muffins.  I made them in the evening and had to stop myself from eating more than one!!  I've already had one this morning and can't wait for the next one!

I made these for some "Happy Friday" treats for the teachers I work with, and they were AWESOME. I'd been wanting to use a can of pumpkin I had in my pantry forever, and these were the perfect match. I didn't change anything about the recipe except I cut the sugar down by half a cup. I would maybe cut it down even more next time. I appreciated that it made so many. Thanks SO much for sharing!!

Delicious!! I woke up early to make these for my kids breakfast. And they were out 10 minutes before they got up. Yummy Yummy. The only opps factor was, I put in vegetable oil in and noticed after the fact it was olive oil and was out of pecans so I just used walnuts. But it was still delicious. My husband does not like pumpkin pie at all, never liked the flavor, but when I put these muffins in front of him, he couldn't help but eat a few of them, and when I said SURPRISE!!! They were pumpkin he dropped his jaw. Because he was shocked that pumpkin could taste sooo good, in another form besides pie. My muffins were light, fluffy and soo tenderly moist. Will make again in the near future. Thanks

I really enjoyed these, I only gave 3 stars because I did not use the recipe as stated, I made some suggested changes from other users and some of my own. I used half white flour and half wheat,, sustituted applesause for oil and splenda for some of the sugar...so I made it mush healthier!

Absolutely love this recipe! I used this recipe to make a cake and it turned out rather tasty. I poured the muffin batter into a greased and floured 9x13 pan. I poured the cream cheese mixture on top of that (making sure it didn't touch the edges of the pan). Then, doubled the recipe for the crumble, and sprinkled that on top. Baked until toothpick came out clean (30 -35 minutes) Will use this recipe again! THANKS!
Oh yes, I used the full 14 oz. can of pumpkin, didn't want to waste the little extra that was left.

These were good but they were so much work that I'm not sure they were worth it. They didn't get rave reviews although no one had anything bad to say about them, they just weren't great. Probably will not make these again.

Very very tasty but wish they tasted more pumpkin-y.  Next time, I'll go with the suggestion of adding the pumpkin pie spices to the batter.  I think I may go for the brown sugar topping suggestion also.

I served this one in my cupcake boutique and the customers went crazy for it. I did add 1/8 of a teaspoon of allspice the second time I made these. The customers tell me the allspice made these muffins sheer perfection. They're moist and flavorful.

Fantastic muffin and the first time my 2 toddlers have eaten anything pumpkin!! Used canned pumpkin pie - as it was all I had.  Also used brown sugar in the struedel...used my cookie scoop and placed a full scoop in bottom of muffin liner, used pastry bag to pipe cream cheese mix into middle, then covered with another scoop...used butter knife to spread it around and worked perfectly!  Had a nice cream cheese center...Thanks so much for sharing - will definitely make again!!

So tasty but I will try a full half cup less flour next time as they tasted a bit too much of flour and were too dense and heavy. The flavor is there though, I am just hoping to perfect it :)

These came out perfectly. Great, Great recipe! I had exactly enough of all three bowls of mixes to make 24 muffins. I also always keep all but one of these ingredients stocked in my house. Cream cheese was al I had to buy. They are pretty too. My cream cheese was runny and therefore ran to the paper liners but it made no difference...they are still awesome and delicious. Really good job on this!

These were certainly delicious, but I had to jazz it up a little to my own tastes.  Like other reviewers have noted, the "filling" mixture as written is soupy and impossible to work with; mine was also a very unappetizing shade of brown from all of the added vanilla.  I added 4 ounces (half a package) extra of cream cheese, and then whisked it together; there were a few lumps, but the filling didn't run all over the place.  I didn't have any pecans, so I had to improvise: the only nuts I had on hand were macadamia nuts, and truthfully, I think they were more awesome!  Great compliment to the pumpkin.  As for the pumpkin base itself, I used an entire 16 ounce can of pumpkin, since I didn't want to stick the remaining 1/3 cup in a tupperware container.  The pumpkin was spot on, but I doubled the cinnamon and added ginger, allspice and nutmeg to make it spicier, and it was great.  With these extras, my second batch of of muffins were outstanding, but without them (more cream cheese, more pumpkin, more spices), it was slightly bland.  A great base recipe.

I LOVE these muffins.  I did make a few changes and have a few notes.  1. For the streusel, I used an extra tbsp of butter.  2. For the muffin batter, I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar (sifted).  In addition to the 2 tsp ground cinnamon, I added 2 tsp pumpkin spice.  I thought the muffins themselves were a little bland.  I also used a whole can of pumpkin- 15 oz.  Instead of a 1/3 cup olive oil, I used 1/6 cup olive oil and 1/6 cup apple sauce.  3. The filling mixture SHOULD be a bit chunky.  If you over beat it, it ends up too runny.  4. When you spoon in the filling, dip the spoon into the center of the muffin.  This will let some of it seep into the muffin.  I absolutely love these and they do not last long in my household!

The muffins are beautiful. I did make a minor change I put half the muffin mix in the paper holder dropped the cream cheese filling and then added more muffin mix on top and then the streusel also I added nutmeg and a bit of cloves.  I will make these often.

Okay, ya'll.  You can't compare these to the St****ck's muffins.  Why not?  Because these muffins are made with ingredients you can PRONOUNCE.  No fake stuff here.  These are delicious muffins.  Sure, many of us AR cooks tweak things.  That should go without saying.  But please don't compare a perfectly lovely, though basic, recipe to some plastic, $2.95 chain-sold "ideal."

I used fresh pumpkin, which seemed a little dry so I added about 1/3 c. applesauce.  These turned out great!  I got 24 muffins from this recipe.  They freeze well.

I made these pumpkin muffins as mini muffins and they turned out so cute!  I baked for about 11 minutes.  Only change I would make is next time I will add more nuts to the topping.

Loved these and so did my husband who doesn't like pumpkin.  I didn't do much altering, just used veg oil b/c I didn't have olive oil, and left out the nuts.  The cream cheese filling was sooo good - kinda like a cream cheese kolache consistency.  I put a little batter in, then a spoon of cream cheese mixture, then more batter, then topped it off with the topping. The muffin was also great, not too spicy.  I also used fresh pumpkin.  These are very pretty too. This is a regular for us now.  Thanks!

These were just okay.  Way too labor intensive for what you get. Also, I easily got 24 muffins, well over the 18 listed on the recipe. I did as other reviewers suggested and doubled the filling and topping.  I don't think doubling the filling is necessary, but it's a good idea for the topping.

My friends can't stop raving about these & they never stay around for more than a day! I always fill my cups 1/3 full, then spoon a little filling, top it with more pumpkin batter, and sprinkle with the topping. I also add a 1/2 teaspoon of ginger to the batter. Delicious!

Nice and easy recipe. Keeping in mind the changes that others noted-I wanted to see if I'd like it as written. I did...BUT...Next time I will use less cinnamon. I will double the cream cheese mixture- it seemed to disappear into the muffin. I will use brown sugar in place of all the white sugar. I will use LESS sugar. I will use a bit more pumpkin. I will try pumpkin pie spice in place or in addition to cinnamon.

Not sure what I did wrong but after all the work, these turned out horrible.  They had no taste at all and while the cream cheese filling was good, the crumble on top was not. I think next time I try this I will substitute other sweeteners for the large amount of white sugar that is used.

I have to rate the right down the middle.  The recipe is a wonderful concept - but, it is VERY time consuming and difficult to tell if they are done. The first batch was underdone and the second was a bit better.  Used pumpkin pie spice.  Husband ate them all up...

I would rate this recipe 3.5 stars if given the option. Since I couldn't I let my 4 year old be the tie breaker. :o) I followed the recipe with just a few changes. I used "egg replacer" instead of eggs to keep it heart healthy. I used organic raw sugar in place of the white sugar. Finally, I used reduced fat cream cheese.
Now the cream cheese filling was AWESOME. I would rate it alone 5 stars. I made that part first and stuck it in the fridge until it was needed. As much as I LOVED the filling I HATED the topping. It did not do it for me at all. The muffin part wasn't very sweet or flavorful - aside from a STRONG rather bland pumkin taste. What REALLY upset me was the muffins STUCK TO THE PAPER! No, the filling did not touch the wrappers. My muffins never stick so I was REALLY disappointed. I made them for a new neighbor but would NEVER share muffins that stick. So BOO to whatever caused that.
I'd make them again only if requested by my Hubby.

These were good - a bit fussy to make.  One plus is that if the cream cheese filling touches the muffin pan, it doesn't seem to hurt it any.

However, the pumpkin muffin part on the bottom ended up a bit dry for me.  I had a hard time telling when it was done so it may have overcooked a bit.  Since you can't actually see the muffin part, which is the part that needs to bake, it's hard to tell for sure when to take it out of the oven.

It was quite fussy having to add the cream cheese filling and the streusel on top to each muffin, so maybe in the future I would try a small loaf instead of muffins and add the filling and streusel all at once.

Overall this is a good recipe, just a bit hard to make and takes a long time and a lot of bowls.  I would probably only do this for special occasions.

awesome!  i halved the recipe since i only had one egg, and i scrambled it & split it between the 2 parts of the recipe that called for it.  also, i put the cream cheese mixture in the freezer (i used it straight out of the fridge) whil ei made the other parts.  not sure if it made a difference, but these were great!

I tried what one reviewer suggested and put the creamed cheese on top to resemble cheesecake. Still my family thought that it was the basic muffin itself that was the problem. This recipe just rated a reluctant "OK" from one and all at our house. This is not a keeper for us.

This muffin recipe had many steps and many ingredients so I was expecting them to be fabulous.  They were just OK according to my family.  I also had the problem of the cream cheese just sitting on top of the thick pumpkin batter.  They were moist, but rather bland for our taste.

This was a great recipe as many have mentioned.  I added more lots more spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, dash ginger and allspice).  I also added pecans and currants into the batter.  Adding the currants made it sweeter without adding more sugar.  I would change the recipe a bit by spooning batter then cream cheese mixture then more batter (and skip the struesel topping).  But be careful - don't put more than 1/2 cup total into the muffin cup.  Yummy and Thanks Barb!

Excellant....I am not a fan of pumpkin but this recipe was really good.  I received several comments on them.  After I put the pumpkin mixture into the cupcake tin I used the back of a spoon to create a small hole or "well" in the pumpkin mixture then added the cream cheese mixture.  It made it a little easier to keep it from the sides of the muffin.

This was wonderful!!!!!!  I actually left out the pecans and they were still incredible. A huge hit at church for breakfast. I also used canola instead of olive oil. I've never baked with olive oil before so I thought that was a little strange...And start watching the muffins after about 15 minutes, then set your timer in 5-7 minute intervals and continue to check on them. I've found it's easy to burn muffins.

These muffins were very good.  I took them to a church breakfast and was asked by many ladies for the recipe. I read all the reviews before baking them and made the following changes as others suggested.  I used canola oil rather than olive oil and added 1 tsp. nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. ground cloves and 1/4 tsp. ground ginger in addition to the cinnamon called for in the recipe. I had a large can of pumpkin rather than a small can so I used 1/2 of the large can which was 1 3/4 cups. I thought the cream cheese filling was more of a frosting on the muffins rather than a filling.  A very tasty recipe which I will make again.  Thanks Barb.

I didn't like the way thr cream cheese sat on top of the muffin.  I will make them again, but I will not add egg to the cream cheese mixture, so hopefully the mixture will "sink down" into the mufin.  Other than that, they were good.  I also plan on adding cinnamon chocolate chips to the cream cheese mixture next time.

These muffins are pretty good. They came out great. Like some others I added more brown sugar and a few other things. As long as you know what you are doing they should taste great.

My daughter made these muffins and they were superb. Tey are very moist and flavorful. The only thing is we added a little nutmeg and allspice to the batter along with some brown sugar which made it even more flavorful. WE also added a little allspice to the topping. The cream cheese is not mushy it makes it nice and moist. Great Fall muffin!!

First of all, I'm not sure how the five star folks got a good muffin out of this recipe without heavily doctoring it with spices. I had to add quite a bit of pumpkin pie spices - cloves, more cinnamon, ginger, all-spice - to get any kind of flavor into these. Secondly, I made the "cream cheese filling" exactly as the recipe states. As most of the other three to one star reviewers found, it became basically like a cream cheese glaze once it melted into the strudel topping. I did make one alteration: I added toasted pumpkin seeds to the strudel topping (pre-packaged, David brand because I didn't have any fresh ones on hand yet) and they gave the topping a salty-sweetness that I really liked. The muffins are dense and, once properly spiced, are definitely great. Make sure you absolutely do not overfill the muffin cups; the batter is thick and you'll run out if you overfill them. All in all, a good recipe with heavy modifications.

These were pretty good! I was sad when Starbucks pulled their pumpkin cream cheese muffins, so I gave it a try.  I used sunflower oil instead of olive oil because it adds an aftertaste in baked or heated dishes that I didn't want.  I also used pumpkin seeds on top instead of streusel or pecans because I wanted them to be just like the Bucks!  They were good and everyone loved them. Next time I will probably add another egg since they were a little dense and I would like them to be more cake-like, I also want to suggest to layer half of your muffin in the mold, then spoon on the cream cheese, then top with the other half of the muffin mixture. It was difficult to get the cream cheese in the middle because the batter was so dense.

Mine turned out amazing!  Like one or two others, these have become my new "signature" muffin for all gatherings and occasions.  I didn't find any difficulty in the process.  I fill mine a little more than half full and get jumbo sized results.  I did add a spoon of batter on top of the cream cheese before adding the streusel topping and find that they hold together just fine and allow the cheesecake flavour to come through longer!  Love this recipe.

Definitely needs more flavour.  I even added 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the batter. When filling my muffin liners I put a medium scoop of batter then 1tbsp of my soupy cream cheese 'filling'.It spread out all over the batter.  Then i added 1 more tbsp of muffin batter on top of the cream cheese.  They baked up ok. the filling kind of disappeared. I think i'll try a different muffin recipe next time.

These are incredibly moist and wonderful!  My daughter picked this recipe out among a few I'd found on allrecipes.com, and it's definitely a winner. The first time I made them I made them just as the recipe states.  They were awesome!  Then I made them as mini-muffins.  I suggest that you use a frosting bag and pipe the cream cheese filling into them instead of trying to put it on the mini-muffins by hand.  I did add a few more spices (cardomom, cloves, allspice, ginger and extra cinnamon) but that's just me.  Other changes I've enjoyed is putting more cream cheese filling in/on them - it's like a little cheesecake on top.  Do NOT overbake.  To make it easier, spray a little oil in the muffin papers to make the paper easier to remove when you're eating them. Since then, I've made these multiple times, and sometimes there's even some left to give to others!

These are great. The only thing I would do is cut back on the oil. When I removed the muffins from the pan, I noticed a small pool of oil?  Would def. try this again.  Maybe with veg. oil.

Darn good muffins - wish I could stop eating them! I doubled the cream cheese topping portion, left out the pecans, and added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the muffin batter. Nice, light taste, and really good warm from the oven or cold from the refrigerator. Thanks!

These are wonderful!! They are fairly easy to make, and are delicious! They only thing I did differently was used vegetable oil instead of olive oil and they still turned out very moist. Also for the cream cheese I put it in a ziploc bag, cut the corner and squeezed it into the batter and it worked very well. It turns out to be more at the top instead of a filling, but it still is great!! One thing I would do differently next time is to make twice as much of the streusel because it definitely makes the muffin!

I changed this recipe a bit, and I actually used the recipe for the batter from : 

"Cream Cheese Filled Pumpkin MUffins from 'withcywoman' 

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cream-cheese-filled-pumpkin-muffins/detail.aspx

This batter tasted better because it had more spices.. But I totally used the streusel topping.  I liked having the cream cheese on TOP of the muffin instead of inside.  

As for smaller changes: I used the whole can of pumpkin, and used vegetable oil instead of olive oil. Came out really moist.  I'm sure the original recipe would've been fine, but I liked it better with my additions! :)

These were okay. I followed the recipe, but they didn't taste much like pumpkin.  The cheesecake and streusel topping were great!  I will try this again adding more pumpkin and also pumpkin pie spice like some other reviewers suggested.

I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand for this recipe and a craving for pumpkin muffins. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used grapeseed oil in place of olive and a mixture of white and whole wheat flour. They turned out really well, very nice looking and tasty. Next time I will make 2 small changes: I would add a little pumpkin pie spice as other reviewers have suggested, and make a small indent in the batter for the cream cheese to sit in. I used a scoop to fill my liners and they were a bit roundy on top which made the cream cheese melt over the top instead of pool in the middle. However, they looked beautiful this way too, especially with the streusel topping. Great recipe! Oh, and I made 24 because I had 2x12 cup tins and there was just enough. 20 mins was perfect.

Use more cinnamon and add allspice.
Piped cream cheese mixture on top instead of in the middle.  Left out the topping.

These are very addicting. I followed the recipe, except i added some nutmeg and allspice to each part. and left out the pecans, since i dont like them, and i didnt have any. I tried a couple of ways to "fill" the muffins. some i filled with batter about 1/2 way, and then put cream cheese on them and then a little more batter around it. a few i filled about 1/4 way, then dropped the cream cheese on, and used another spoonful of batter on top of it. (they turned out just fine) The one thing i dont like, is that the cream cheese mix turned out more like eggy custard than "filling" like i was expecting. I will make again, maybe without the cream cheese maybe with. The muffins themselves were fantastic!

I've made these muffins for a couple of years now. I use fresh pumpkin because they come out even better. The last few times I've made them I feel like I've found my final recipe. Instead of 2 cups of sugar for the muffin mixture I do a cup of brown sugar and a cup of white sugar. I made a batch, bagged up a handful for the girls at work, a few for family, and the rest disappeared by the next afternoon. I even have a friend whose not a big pumpkin person but she LOVED it with the cream cheese mixture :]

I've read everyone's reviews....and I think these are GREAT. The only thing I will agree is that the cream cheese is runny for sure! however, the final product turned out delish! My hubby and neighbors loved it. I will add more pecans next time though.

So good!  Add a bit more cream cheese so filling isn't so runny, and beat well.  I make wells in the muffin batter too to help the cream cheese mixture.  So yummy!

These were really yummy but I wish I hadn't put all the batter in the muffin tins before adding the cream cheese filling.  Next time I would add only a spoonful of batter to each tin and then add the filling and then add the rest of the batter.

These were very yummy!  just what I was looking for. I didn't have any pecans but they were delicious without.  I only added 1/2 the sugar and I thought the sweetness was perfect. I used whole wheat flour and added some pumpkin spice too.

Made these muffins for my coworkers and they were gone in a flash!  Not overly pumpkin taste.  I could have reduced cream cheese by a bit though as I had some of that mixture left over AND I added double amount of cinnamon because I love it.  Almost everyone asked for the recipe.  And I'm NOT a baker.  I'll definately make again.

These muffins are fantastic! I made them for my husband and I and took the rest to work.  They were devoured and everyone raved about how much they loved them.

These muffins are great! I've made them 3 times following the recipe to the letter and never once had a problem with the cream cheese like other reviewers seemed to have. Everyone raves about these!

These were really good.  I thought the muffin was dense and moist and pumpkin-y.  I liked the cream cheese, but I had trouble keeping the mixture from running off to the edges, and it made my cupcakes stick to the wrappers.  The streusel topping was yummy.

These are moist and look BEAUTIFUL! I think the only "fault" I can find is that I prefer a little more spice with my pumpkin so next time (and there will be a next time) I'll add pumpkin pie spice to the muffin batter. Otherwise this is lovely!

Absolutely awesome!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I pretty much adhered to the recipe; my only changes were cutting down on the white sugar (I used 1 1/2 cups) and chopping up CANDIED pecans for the streusel topping (they make it that much more decadent).  I also topped each muffin's center with a whole candied pecan -- they looked gorgeous.  I was also able to get 24 muffins out of this recipe, so just be aware that you might need to have a few extra paper liners handy.    Definitely a keeper.  Thanks again!

If I could give this 3 1/2 I would. I LOVE pumpkin, and cream cheese, and even more so together, but this recipe didnt do it for me.  I DID make some changes, however; I put the filling in the middle like a filling, but I doubt this altered the taste. These muffins were good, but not great, the filling was too eggy and salty, and i found it to be not worth the work. Will not likely make again, but enjoyed the combination of flavours.

Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I really liked these muffins. Too many added spices would hide the great pumpkin taste. The cinnamon was enough. They were especially good right out of the oven, and they were one of those things even better the next day. I wouldn't change a thing.

Absolutely to die for.  Second time around I added a dash of ginger and cloves to both the topping and the muffin.  I think it made it even better.

These were very tasty and very pretty!  Very moist and had nice flavor.  I halved the recipe.  I used milk instead of an egg in the filling.  The filling could use some spices.  I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil.  I added 1/2 tsp each of cloves, nutmeg, and allspice to the batter.  I only used 1/2 can of pumpkin.  This made 10 muffins, baked for 20 mins.

We looooooooooved these! My boyfriend and I made them and we followed the recipe exactly! I was a little concerned because the cream cheese mixture did seem a little runny but they baked absolutely beautifully and they were delicious! I personally love the taste of pumpkin but I think this would be good for people who normally dont even enjoy things like pumpkin pie because the pumpkin flavor isn't overwhelming at all, its just enough. We will definitely be making these for Thanksgiving.

I made these as the recipe was written. Delicious! Really really good. Next time though I might make more of the cream cheese filling and either pipe it into the center or layer it with the batter (muffin, cream, muffin). That's all I would change though. Wonderful! Thanks!

Yummmmy! I made these for a bake sale and had a hard time eating only one during my taste test. Like a few others, I used canola oil instead of olive oil (the muffins were moist and tender). I also added nutmeg and ground ginger (1/4 tsp each) to the batter, and a pinch of each to the cream cheese mixture. Some mentioned having problems with the cream cheese mixture...I used a small spatula to push some batter up against the sides to create a well, then topped with about a tbsp of cream cheese mixture. I had enough batter and filling to make 24 muffins. I'm usually not a big fan of streusel toppings, but oh my - it really pulled everything together. Thanks for a great recipe, Barb!

AMAZING! Never have I made such delicious muffins. The key that I found is to "sandwich" the cream cheese "filling" between the batter, I put a little batter on bottom, some cream cheese filling then more batter on top then the streusel...absolutely delicious! mmmm Following recipe to a T

As my husband said... "really good".  That's good in this house.  I used the exact recipe but layered them.  First using small scoop of batter then wet finger and pushed around the bottom of liner.  then add scoop of filling, then another scoop of batter and topped with the strusel topping.  Excellent!

My advice is definitely ramp up the flavour factor...add nutmeg, cloves, maybe some cardamom...3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon alone is inadequate. Otherwise a nice muffin, but didn't  blow me away.

Oh so wonderful!! I was looking for a muffin I could give my children for a quick breakfast or snack after school and I found it in this recipe. While getting the ingredients together for these I found that my oldest son had gotten into the cream cheese and used half of it (for his bagels). So I made them without the cream cheese filling. The recipe made exactly 18 muffins. The only tweaking I did was add 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves and about 1/4 tsp of freshly grated nutmeg. These were pleasing to the eye as well as the taste buds. Without a doubt I will make these again and again.

Came out beautifully! I added more cinnamon, cloves, and ginger to the batter recipe... Also used pumpkin butter instead of canned pumpkin, but that's because the grocery store was out of canned pumpkin!   Added some flour to the cream cheese mix, as well as another half package of cream cheese. Piped the filling into the muffins with a plastic ziplock bag, and everything stayed in place... they had a real cream cheese filling!   Delicious and pretty!  Will be going off for gifts!

I can't even begin to describe how much I adore these muffins... they are the best I've ever had! I made 12 jumbo muffins, baking them an extra 10 minutes. I also added a little nutmeg and clove since I love using those spices when I bake anything pumpkin. I might try incorporating some pumpkin seeds next time. Thank you so much for this recipe Barb! This is definitely a favourite and I will be making them over and over and over! :D

I made this as a cake in one of those oversized cupcake things. I would not recommend doing so, nor would I recommend using the filling recipe provided here. Something is off about it, although I can't quite place what. Smells great, but it's been 5 days, and it's barely half eaten; usually in my house anything with pumpkin in it disappears in about a day. Find a better recipe.

I love pumpkin nut bread, and wanted to give these a try.   The changes i made were to add about 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a dash or 2 of allspice to the batter and i used vegetable oil instead of olive oil.  This made 20 muffins, generously sized.  If i make these again, i would double the streusel and leave out the cream cheese all together.  The cream cheese was different and pretty, but not enough of an improvement to leave in.  I loved the topping on these and didn't feel like i had as much as i needed for all of the muffins.

These are delish!  I am in agreement with so many others in terms of the spices.  I added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice and cloves for extra flavor.  Will definitely be making these again.

This was amazing! I used white sugar (as it calls for) in the actual muffins, and canola oil instead of the olive oil. It made 21 muffins with the cream cheese filling. Definitely don't fill the muffin tins more than 1/2 way with the pumpkin mixture.  I did as another reviewer recommended and was careful to leave small bits of cream cheese in the filling mixture, not over mixing. I also used a spoon to create a small hole in the pumpkin mixture before adding the spoonful of cream cheese filling, as someone recommended, and this definitely helped! Next time I would double the streusel topping, because this didn't make enough to cover each muffin.  Everyone LOVED them and asked for my recipe!

I've made this a few times now, and these have to be my favourite muffins! As mentioned many times, the filling is a 2nd topping, under the streusel. I swap out some of the sugar for black strap molasses, which makes them even more moist and adds a hint of old school flavour.

These muffins are good but they need way more spice.  I put in extra cinnamon, added nutmeg and cloves.  Trust me....use extra spice or will be way too bland.  I also used an extra 1/3 cup pumpkin.  I used just the egg white also, for the cream cheese filling....turned out good, but I would use another 1/3 batch of filling because there was not enough to say m-m-m.  Overall good but not great recipe!

These are GREAT! To make it healthy I substituted honey for sugar in the cake part, used whole wheat flout, and applesauce instead of the oil. I cooked them in silicone so I didn't have to mess with liners.

These muffins turned out great.  The only thing I would have changed was the seasonings.  To me it could have used a little more spice, but overall no complaints.

These are wonderful and so very pretty.  I took the advice in earlier comments and I doubled the cream cheese mixture for these.  My only caution: Do *not* use dark muffin cups for these or the bottoms of your muffins will be overcooked. My second batch, made in shiny muffin tins, were absotively perfect.

All my favorite flavours are in this muffin! My changes:  Where the recipe calls for cinnamon, I also added a dash of nutmeg. For the strudel topping, I doubled the quantities; used cooking oats (50/50 ratio) and omitted the nuts. For the muffin batter, I used canola oil instead of olive oil. I "piped" the cream cheese mixture into the batter using a ziplock back with a corner cut out. Final result: Yummy! The cream cheese kinda oozes and mixes nicely with the other layers. I found more topping adds a nice crunch and makes this muffin "to die for".

If you want a lot of streusel topping then you need to double it.  Next time I think I will add nutmeg to the muffin batter.  Also there were a few reviews that said their cream cheese was more like a cheesecake topping.  If you want to keep the cream cheese in the middle you may want to try using a piping utensil.  Overall it was a great recipe! I love pumpkin anything!!

These were really good.  Hubby and our houseguest loved them.  Even the dog loved them.  I made 18 muffins and some of them did not have a definite cream cheese layer but were still good.  I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil.   I also used almonds in the topping since thats what i had on hand.  Seems like they took forever to mix up and get ready to go in the oven, but maybe it was just too early in the morning for me.  Not enough coffee yet.  Hubby said these were a keeper.

i made 2 batches; 1 as it's been written - cream chheese mixture on top of the batter, and sprinkle the streusel topping. 2 as somebody commented - batter, cream cheese mixture, BATTER again before the streusel topping, and me & my bf definitely loved the latter. I didn't put the cream cheese in the middle but tried to cover it up with maybe 1 tbs batter. I also think, this muffins would be good without the cream cheese mixture. It just gives the variety from others who's been eating pumpkin streusel muffins, alwlays. I liked the fact this recipe called for olive oil. This was my first time to bake muffins with olive oil and i think it came out LIGHTER (not dense) i like!

These are great! Very moist and all the flavors go together so well making one yummy muffin! I omitted the pecans, I usually don't like nuts in my baked goods, and substituted vegetable oil for the olive oil, but other than that didn't change a thing. I manged to get 21 muffins out of this recipe. Hubby really enjoyed these and so did I. Will definitely make again.

Excellent muffins - very rich & filling.  For the muffins I did half white sugar and half brown sugar, and I found the consistency to be perfect.  I also couldn't get the cream cheese to be a filling (it just ended up on top) but it was very good.  I added a half teaspoon of cloves to the batter - yummy.  The recipe can definitely be stretched to make 24 muffins, but I divided the batter among the 18 muffins and ended up with full, big muffins.  A definite repeat!

I really liked these muffins but made some changes.  I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned.  I cut a fresh pumpkin in half, cleaned it out, roasted it with 2tbsp butter and 3 tbsp brown sugar per side.  I scooped out the pulp and juice and used that instead.  I halved the sugar (b/c of the sugar in the pumpkin) and omitted the olive oil (again b/c of the butter added to the pumpkin).  I added more seasoning, ginger, allspice, nutmeg and more cinnamon.  I did not bake with cream cheese inside.  Instead I used the icing from the "Clone of a Cinnabon" recipe from this site and piped it into the center of the muffins after they cooled a bit.  Also found the bake temp and time too high.  So I baked at 300 for 18 min.  Over all DELICIOUS!

The first time I made them, I let the cc mixture form a layer on the top.  But the second time, I put the filling in a ziploc bag and squeezed it into the middle of the muffin to make a filling.  OH MY!  I was out of oil the second time I made them and just used extra pumpkin in place of the oil and it was just fine.  I will be making these again and again.  And I did add another teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, a dash of ginger and a dash of nutmeg.  But I like things spicy.

Oh my goodness; I am in muffin heaven. These are fabulous. After reading a bunch of the comments, I did add some additional spices to the batter, just eyeballed in some cloves, allspice and a tiny bit of ginger. I use Pampered Chef scoops, so I used the medium sized one to put the batter in the cup. Then I used the small one to put in the cream cheese filling, and another medium sized scoop of batter on top of that. It baked up fine, with the filling right in the middle. For the streusel topping, I used half white and half brown sugar. They baked perfectly in exactly 20 minutes, and it made 21 muffins for me. My daughter and I can't keep our hands off them! This recipe is a keeper.

I make a dessert twice a month for my husbands lodge meetings. Last week I told him I was making Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffins for the next meeting and he turned his nose up. After eating them that night he's changed his view of pumpkin. I've had to make a whole batch just for him and he's already requesting them again! Great recipe! These muffins will change anyones thought of "Eww pumpkin?".

These muffins are WONDERFUL!  The only thing I added was a pinch of cloves, some fresh grated nutmeg, and a pinch of ginger as I like my pumpkin recipes on the spicy side.  My batch did yield 24 muffins and I had to double the crumb topping.  Well worth the effort...these will definetly be in my gift baskets to everyone for the up coming holiday season!

Moist and delicious!  Loved the cream cheese and pecan topping.  I used real pumpkin and added 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice as others had suggested.  Wonderful recipe!

This recipe yielded 64 mini muffins for me (baked 16-16:30 minutes).  Based on other reviews I added 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice to the batter, and I would probably add 1 tsp next time.  I used nonstick coated mini muffins pans and didn't need to oil and flour them.  The only other change I made was to use canola oil in place of the olive oil.  Very pretty and delicious.

I made the recipe as written. In the future I will add more spices to the muffin batter. The muffin was a little bland but was still tasty. I had no problem with the cream cheese topping being too runny. I will make again with a few adjustments to the muffin batter.

I love these!!!  I have made them a dozen or so times. I always have to add a bit more cream cheese (like half a brick).  So the filling isn't too runny.  and I use canola instead of olive oil.  But man these are yummy!

I made 90 muffins to feed an army (literally) and they were a hit!  I made four different kinds of muffins and while all were received with hungry appreciation, these were the ones that disappeared the fastest!  Great recipe exactly as written.

I loved these muffins- they were a hit today, I had to give out the recipe 4 times, so good job Barb! I didn't warm the cream cheese and it set nicely.  I didn't have pecans, but they were still lovely and had a nice texture.

These muffins are fantastic!  Our daughters' friends are sleeping over, and of all the things I have baked for them, they specially requested these.  I make them with whole wheat pastry flour, and sweeten them with Agave (cutting back on the other liquid just a bit), and they turn out fantastic!  The kids have no idea they are eating healthy.

I had some trouble with these. The cream cheese filling came out nice, the muffins looked pretty decent (a bit on the shallower side, but fine). The color contrast was neat-- very orange from the pumpkin versus very white from the cream cheese mixture. I skipped the crumble topping to save calories.   However, that said... the filling didn't touch the muffin cups [simple, basic paper ones] yet the muffins are totally stuck to them. I tried waiting for them to cool and trying to pop them out-- no luck. I tried using a knife to edge around- nope- they are just coming apart in globby chunks. I have them in the fridge now- we'll see what happens when I microwave one tomorrow.  The main substitution I did was using applesauce in place of the olive oil, but it seems that other reviewers have done that with success. I also used splenda in place of sugar, and substituted some of the flour with whole wheat (perhaps this was the issue-- it may have made them more dense?). Flavor-wise, I wish I'd used some ginger or nutmeg (apple pie spice? pumpkin pie spice?) to amp these up. I doubled the cinnamon.

I thought these muffins were very tasty. The best part of the muffin is definitely the topping. Next time I make them, I will decrease cook time to 22 minutes exactly and add more topping.

These turned out well. Super moist. One batch made about 20 muffins for me and I made a little more of the streusel topping because I loved it so much. I liked these and I'm not a fan of pumpkin.

As an avid muffinmaker this recipe was GREAT on taste. However, my muffins ALL burned... and they cooked at the minimum time. The made 15 large muffins with plenty of cream cheese leftovers. A big thank you to the reviewers who spoke of the cream cheese not being baked in We live in the mile high city and it will take awhile for me to adjust this recipe...One more thing - I did follow other reviewers and add some spices - dashes of mace, nutmeg, and all spice.

These turned out very pretty but the taste wasn't quite what I was hoping.  I followed the recipe to a tee.  They seem a little bit to sweet.  Maybe next time I will use applesauce instead of so much sugar.

I found these muffins to be very bland the first time I made them, so I use 2 tsp of cinnamon and also add nutmeg, ginger, and cloves.  I had the same issue as other readers with the cream cheese. I tried freezing small lumps of the filling and then pushing them into the batter while it's in the cups, and this works quite well.

I sub'd apple sauce for the olive oil
Added Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and a little bit of ginger to the batter (or pumpkin pie spice would have worked)
And used Oatmeal instead of nuts for the topping
I had trouble getting the cream cheese mix to thicken but pulled out the stand mixer and it thickened up very quickly I did use powdered sugar instead of brown sugar for the cream cheese mix
Turned out Delicious!!!  Made 2 Dozen...5 for taste but 4 because of the changes that so many people have suggested.

These were pretty good, a little drier than I was hoping for. I omitted the streusel topping, they were perfectly sweet enough without. I used canola rather than olive oil because I can't justify olive oil in baking. Used homemade pumkin puree from a pumkin from my garden. The cream cheese center is fabulous. This recipe makes a lot so I froze most of them and took them out for a quick weekday breakfast on the way to school.

I made these muffins for a family get-to-gether, following the recipe as shown. I didn't worry about the cream cheese being in the center of the muffin. I just scooped it on top of the batter, then added the topping. Doing it this way didn't exactly make them "cream cheese filled," but it made a very tasty top to the muffins. I also took chocolate muffins, using the same idea for the cream cheese. Although one would think that the chocolate muffins would be eaten first (because everyone loves chocolate), the pumpkin muffins were gone before anyone tried the chocolate ones. Everyone loved them.

Excellent muffins!!  I told my husband that I would try to put the cream cheese mix between two layers of the batter (so that it's more like a filling instead of a topping) but he said he loved them as is.  Thanks for sharing.  Will make again.

Great recipe! I substituted pumpkin pie spice for some of the cinnamon in the batter.
The idea of the ziploc bag for the cream cheese filling is a winner!  Thanks to all who share their ideas.

I have found my new favorite muffins. I made a batch of these along with banana and bran muffins for my co-workers and these were the first to go. The only thing I changed was substituting vegetable oil for olive oil. I followed the advice of another reviewer and was sure not to over-mix the filling. They weren't completely filled, as alot of the filling ended up sort of coating the top of the muffins, but there was a definite little bit of filling in the center of each one. Delicious!

This was one of the better recipes for the actual pumpkin batter. Similar to other members, I also had a hard time with the cream cheese filling. I added 1/2 teaspoon of guar gum to help thicken it up. I also added 1 tsp of ground ginger to the batter and 1/2 tsp to the topping. I substituted 1 cup of splenda for baking for 1 cup of the sugar. I also added 1/3 cup of apple sauce and only 1 tablespoon of olive oil to reduce the fat in the recipe. To make the cream cheese more of a filling than a topping, I filled the muffin cups, poked a hole in the center, and then added the filling.

I should have read the reviews first.  Disappointed in the lack of a cream cheese filling, and they were a little too sweet - needed more spice.  They did however, come out very moist and they looked beautiful.  Just needs a little tweeking.  A good tip for adding the cream cheese; use a small melon baller sprayed with cooking spray to make a nice well.

I added 1 tsp. ginger and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the batter mixture.  I didn't have enough muffin liners, so I made 12 muffins and one loaf like another reviewer suggested.  I also left off the streusal topping.  I think the muffins would be better with the topping, will try it next time.  Very good!

Three & A Half stars.  I'm gonna tink with these to make 'em better... Following suggestions, I left out the egg in the filling.  I think it (the filling) could use more sweet - like powdered sugar or something.  For the topping, I doubled it and used walnuts instead (what I had).  The topping is fabulous!  As for the actual muffin part:  Reduced sugar to 1.5 cups, extra cinnamon, nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice,  Used the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin.  And, Wesson's "Best Blend" in place of the olive oil. I thought these were a bit dry (use more oil next time), and flour'y (reduce by at least 1/2 cup).  I don't think it necessary to double the Cream Cheese mix - if you follow the reviewer who suggested to plop it on top, and push it in with your finger.  (If you leave it lumpier, this works beauty).

These were good, but they weren't "pumpkin-y" enough. I'd add more pumpkin and spice to liven it up a little. Next time, I'll also swirl in the cream cheese filling. Great recipe though.

My whole family loves this recipe. I did listen to other reviewers and changed a couple of things. For the cream cheese topping: it seems to be a little soupy, but will bake in nicely. If you want to taste the cream cheese there needs to be lots of little globbys of it in the soup. Most importantly DOUBLE BOTH THE CREAM CHEESE AND STRUDEL TOPPING. If you use a cupcake size muffin pan, and put one heaping teaspoon of batter in, one tablespoon of cc topping,and one tablespoon of strudel (pat down with the back of your spoon, so the strudel sticks into the muffin) then you can make as many as 36 muffins. This size bakes for exactly 21 min. I also made costco sized muffins that were a full meal all by themselves. But they need at least 34 to 36 min. to bake. Feel free to add as much nutmeg, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice as you want. It takes ALOT of spice to be too overpowering.

These get just three stars because I don't think the finished product was worth all of the effort.  I did everything according to the directions except for the olive oil (that concerned me in a baking recipe) so I substituted veggie oil.  Not the healthiest choice; but please, they are pumpkin cream cheese muffins!  :)  I think you can get great flavor with less fuss with the Pumpkin Cheese Bread II from this site.  Just make the topping from this recipe.

These are quite good muffins, but the recipe makes WAY more than 18.  I was faced with having probably 30 muffins for my family of 3, so I decided to make the first 18 with the batter, filling, batter, topping.  Baked them for 25 minutes and they came out great.  I had enough batter left for 4 more made as written with batter, filling, topping, and I did like it that way better (baked 20 min)!  So just keep in mind this really does make A LOT!  I did add 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp cloves to the batter and used buttermilk instead of oil.  I would have needed to double the filling (which is really mild) and triple the topping (which is not crumbly) to have enough of each to spread out for all that batter when it's made as written.  Loved the spongy consistancy and they came of of the muffin cups perfectly!

I added 1 tsp of pumpkin spice, used brown sugar and used crumb topping from  banana crumb muffins rec (we do not care for nuts and didnt know how would the topping worked out without nuts). However I cant say we loved this rec. We did not taste pumpkin flavor at all. The cream cheese topping was great, just the muffin by itself wasnt what I expected. I think I will try to find more flavorfull pumpkin muffins.

Wow these turned out great!!! You definately need to double the cream cheese mixture & it doesn't matter if it touches the paper. I substituted Pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon, & that worked out really well. Great recipe. A bit time consuming but worth it!

I was anxious to try this recipe and was disappointed in the results.  They took over an hour to prepare and the result just wasn't equal to either the time required or the ingredients.  I followed the directions exactly.  I won't be making these again.  I am having a hard time giving these away to the men working in my yard.

After looking over this recipe and finding many reviews have problems with the cream cheese part- I substituted Mascarpone cheese(more expensive but has more body, and the flavor...YUMMM)And rather then using the Oil, I used buttermilk. I added pumpkin spice o the streusel topping as well.  The muffins definitely were moist and wonderful with a great filling that was to die for! I will definitely keep this recipe on hand,   everyone loved them!

I had some trouble getting the cream cheese mixture to thicken up; just be aware of this and tweek the mixture when making, maybe add powdered sugar.  Otherwise the cream cheese middle gets lost in the pumpkin batter.  I subbed hazelnuts for the pecans because it's what I had; turned out nicely.

AWESOME! I had some trouble with the cream cheese too. But I figured out that the trick was to use a mixer and make sure the cream cheese was still cold. Not straight from the frig, but not room temp either. I beat it until it just a little lumpy then I put it in the frig while I made the streusel and muffin batter. By that time it was firm enough to spoon onto the muffin batter without it sliding all over the place. As per other reviews, I added Pumpkin spice and some Nutmeg. They turned out GREAT!!!

First let me say that the taste of these muffins was fabulous.  Yum, yum, yum.  However, I had a little trouble.  The cream cheese mixture ended up very runny and the pumpkin batter was very thick.  As a result, the cream cheese just ran over the top and never sunk in when cooking.  Oh well, it still tasted awesome, it just didn't look picture worthy.  This recipe made 24 muffins for me.  Thanks!

I really don't understand why this recipe was rated so high.  My muffins came out very heavy and tasteless, so I just ate the cream cheese off the top.  Maybe I did something wrong.  However, another person reported the same thing.

I was disappointed in these muffins.  I followed the recipe as written.  The batter for these muffins seemed quite thick and the finished product was very heavy.  I wonder if you could just go ahead and use the whole can of pumpkin. I didn't think they had the greatest flavor either.  It seemed like a lot of trouble for a so-so result.  I probably would not use again.  Thanks for submitting anyway.

Excellent!  Changes I made:  Doubled cream cheese mixture. Added 6 tbl spoons pecans, instead of 2 cups white sugar, used 1 cup white, 1 cup brown, added 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger, used regular oil instead of olive oil.  Baked for 20 minutes.

I made these for an office potluck and they were a huge hit.  The only changes I made were to double the cream cheese filling which I placed in the center of each muffin rather than on top and I made the muffins "Texas" size. 

Will definetly make again and again.

This is the absolute best muffin recipe ever. Moist, tasty, delicious.  A little time consuming but well worth the effort. I used canola oil instead of the olive oil and omitted the pecans.

Very good.  Did not use the egg for the filling and they still turned out great.  Topping was not real crumbly but still tasted good.  My secretary at work raved about them!

I had almonds instead of pecans, but it quite worked.

Excellent muffins, even with my alterations to make them more healthy (using whole wheat flour and Splenda instead of sugar throughout).  I took other reviewers' advice and added more cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg to spice them up a little, but will add even more spices next time (perhaps some ground ginger and ground cloves).  Cream cheese does not sink into muffins but forms a nice cheesecake-like layer at the top.  Very pretty and delicious.

I made the recipe as written for our office bake sale today.  I ended up with 24 muffins and lots of leftover cream cheese filling.  They tasted good and people went out of their way to tell me how good they were.  However, when I make this again I will definitely add some pie spice for extra flavor as I found them a little bland (when I eat a pumpkin cake, pie, etc. I want to taste the spices).  They look very nice to present as gifts or for a bake sale.  I wonder if you were to top the cream cheese filling with more batter then put on the struesel, would the cream cheese then be a filling rather than like a frosting?  I think I will try that next time.

I added 1/8 tsp of both nutmeg and ground cloves. I used half white and half brown sugar for the muffin. I also used 2 cups of "fresh" pumpkin and canola oil instead of olive oil.
I used a disposable icing bag to fill the muffins. Next time I make it I don't think I'll soften the cream the cream cheese as long it was very loose to try to fill the muffins.
Overall the muffins have a good flavor and are very moist.

This is a great recipe with one change. My recommendation is to use vegetable oil NOT olive oil.  Thankfully I had enough ingredients and started over because the olive oil overpowered the batter flavor. Use vegetable oil!

They really expand. The cream cheese filling kind of "explodes" out and becomes a topping. It is a bit hard to work with the cream cheese filling (was very runny). In hind sight I would've tried to stiffen it up somehow. I filled each muffin about 3/4 full with batter, which was too much. It might even be a good idea to try to sandwich the filling. The strudel really helps the whole thing come together and look nice.

I managed to get 22 muffins. It seemed little lacking in flavor. I added pumpkin pie spice to the pumpkin mixture. Candied the pecans with brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and butter prior to making the streusel.  I think next time i might substitute applesauce for the olive oil.  Definitely would make again with a few tweaks!

First time with these muffins and I wasn't super impressed. The cream cheese filling was watery and didn't fill the middle of muffin like it should have. I'll move on and find a better recipe.

This muffins are quite yummier! I did change a few things since I have been baking a few years I have learned things I like and things I don't like.   Using olive oil in non-savory baked goods is never a good idea we should use softened butter then use a handheld beaters just until pumpkin batter is nicely blended.  And earlier someone wrote not to over blend the cream cheese mixture. It needs to be fork blended so that it's a stiffer constancy.

Made the recipe as written.  The batter was a bit thick and difficult to control, so  making a dent in it for the cream cheese mixture wasn’t completely aesthetically pleasing.  Delicious anyway.  Will make again.

I doubled this recipes and it made just around 40-42 regular size muffins.  I only slightly beat the cream cheese before adding the other ingredients for the filling, which left is slightly chunky, as advised by another reviewer.  I didn't have any pecans, so I eliminated those for the topping.  I think next time I'll triple the topping ingredients when doubling the recipe, as I didn't have enough.  For the muffin batter, I used canola oil instead of vegetable  oil and added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice with the cinnamon.  They were pretty yummy!

I made these and followed the directions exactly as stated and they were horrible and had no flavor. My kids said the topping was the best part of the muffin. I would give it a zero, but there is no zero area. Don't waste your time or money.

These were so delicious! I got 24 small-medium sized muffins. I took the advice I had read on here and didn’t over mix the cream cheese mixture. Cooked for 20min exactly and they were perfectly moist! Probably could use a little extra pecans for the streusel. Will definitely make again!

Very frustrating to figure out how much flour, sugar, cinnamon and other ingredients go into each bowl when they are all in one long list as here. The recipe ingredients need to be sorted by batter, filler and topping.  Not a favorite.

Pumpkin is always a fall favorite and these muffins are the perfect match. These were a hit with my  visitors. In fact, they requested the recipe. I hate throwing out small amounts of unused ingredients so I used the whole 14 oz can of pumpkin. That resulted in a densely moist muffin. I definitely will be making these again.

I used cooked mashed pie pumpkin and I made the same mistake in overworkingthe cream cheese and got soup. It wasn't really a problem as I just pushed the spoonful into the batter and unloaded it with my finger. I followed the receipe except I reduced the sugar in  the batter  from 2 cups to 1 2/3. It was still plenty sweet enough. I would increase the nuts as we really like the crunch they afforded. These baked up beautifully . I got 18 and they needed an extra few minutes to be perfectly done. Very nice looking and tasty muffin. Will make them again.

All in all, this recipe is meh. I was looking for a recipe on the sweeter side to really scratch my fall pumpkin muffin itch. This didn't satisfy. They filled my apartment with a beautiful scent while baking, but I found the muffins dry and bland as other reviews said. I will keep looking for a go-to sweet pumpkin muffin recipe.

Changes I made: I read in other reviews that the cream cheese was not as sweet as it could have been, so I borrowed a tablespoon of sugar from the crumb topping and put it in the cream cheese mixture. I also added an extra 2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter and omitted the nuts. I wanted the cream cheese to be more of a filling, so I filled the liners 1/2 with batter, added a dollop of the cream cheese mixture, and then topped with another spoonful of batter. Baked fine, just didn't taste very good.

These weren't bad, but based on the rating I expected them to be marvelous, and they fell way short of that. I thought the pumpkin muffin itself was fairly bland and the cream cheese topping was so bland you almost wouldn't even know it was there. I was expecting something more decadent. I sometimes make the Betty Crocker recipe for Dalmatian cupcakes, and I was expecting the filling to be more like the rich, flavorful cream cheese filling from that, minus the chocolate chips. I did love the inclusion of pecans in the streusel topping, and I’m thinking I might add some chopped pecans to the batter next time I make pumpkin muffins or pumpkin bread.

This recipe was a terrible waste of time and ingredients. Overall, the flavor is one-dimensional; the only flavorings called for are vanilla and cinnamon. The muffin batter had a dominant  flavor of flour, and I'm wondering if baking soda should have been specified instead of baking powder. The cream cheese "topping" (it's not a filling) didn't add any flavor. It's primary purpose seems to be to help the streusel stick to the muffin, which it doesn't very well. My muffins took about 10 minutes longer to cook than specified.  I get the impression that this recipe was a tweak of some other recipe and not thoroughly tested. (Reviewers, you really should rate a recipe as written and not based on major changes you might have made.)

I made these but heres the deal, put your batter in a piping bag, your filling also, for assembling them. Fill the muffin tins only 1/4 of the way full, pipe your filling on , then put more batter on top. Then add the struesal topping. Or do it the way that is suggested, but the filling does not sink into the batter, and just rests on top, and they rise big time, so dont overfill, or your struesal will be all over the edges and not on top. Have not tasted yet as they just came out, but they look good. Lots and lots of work to make these, not very simple at all.

the flavor was great, I guess i would add to the recipe to let cream cheese warm up to room temperature first, I didn't do that and it was super lumpy...also I substituted almond slices for the pecans since that's what I hand in my pantry, and last I had a hard time with the streusel topping, it wasn't light and grainy like yours looked it become clumped together...maybe my butter wasn't cold enough? I will try again since it still tasted great!

Everyone loved these but I've made them twice now and have found that I always end up with double the amount of cream cheese filling that I need (using standard muffin tins.) I would either double the batter recipe or half the cream cheese mixture unless you are using big tins that can accommodate all of the cream cheese filling.

Not sure I could even say I made this recipe because I made so many changes... 
- mini muffin tins
- no streusel
- half cream cheese
- extra brown sugar in the topping
- part white sugar, part brown in the batter (I ran out of white)
- added some pumpkin spice and nutmeg to the batter
- cook time decreased to 15 minutes

I followed a lot of the changes that were suggested by others, such as adding a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the muffin batter and not beating the cream cheese filling smooth before adding it on top. I got 24 muffins out of this recipe and it turned out pretty well. I don't know that I was amazed by the flavour, but it was good nevertheless. The muffins were moist and the cream cheese filling complimented the muffins and topping well. With the changes made to the recipe I would probably make these again.

These are amazing.  I can tell you if your filling is to runny it's because you didn't mix it long enough. I put it in my mixer with the wire whisk and put it on high for about five minutes and it's a nice thick consistency. I fill muffin just under a third of the way, put a plop of filling and then some more of the pumpkin batter and then the topping.  Absolute perfection.

My family loved them; they are yummy.  However the batter was thick, so it was tricky to get very much cream cheese filling in and also to put batter on top..so the cream cheese filling moreso baked into the batter not giving the 'filling' effect that I thought would occur.. Its really tricky to not have the filling come out and also put enough in there..

Followed the recipe the most part, I did add more spice like ginger, clove, nutmeg and more cinnamon to the dry muffin ingredients. I used more pumpkin purée than called for, about 1/3 cup and I used brown sugar and stevia sugar, 1/2 & 1/2. In the batter. I'd definitely suggest adding more spice. But the outcome after these minor adjustments to my liking, was delicious. These are definitely an indulgent "muffin" :)

I followed the recipe as is, and my cream cheese “topping” (because it does NOT go inside the muffin) was a bit runny. The muffin was pretty good but I could not taste the cream cheese at all. I was really disappointed in the overall flavor because of this. It made 24 muffins. I might make these again if there were some way to beef up the cream cheese topping.

Delightful! They are a lot of work, so allow plenty of time. I did have a little trouble getting enough of the cream cheese mixture on them, so may need to come up with a better method for doing that. However, will definitely make again.

This recipe worked out really well, although I did make a few changes. Following other reviewers, I agree that additional spice is needed. Instead of the 2 tsp of cinnamon called for in the pumpkin batter I used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon. For the streusel, I used 5 tbsp brown sugar rather than white sugar, which I found made for a much better streusel texture and flavour. Further, I agree that the cream cheese filling is more of a topping and followed the advice that it should be barely beaten and lumpy. I also made an indent in each muffin to put the cream cheese filling into. I also made additional streusel topping, which worked out well, and involved adding about an extra tbsp butter, an extra tbsp flour, and 2 tbsp rolled outs. This allowed me to have enough streusel to generously cover all 20 muffins that this recipe made. They were more like cupcakes and my husband loved them! I froze them and he takes two to work every morning.

Batter was so thick, it turned to concrete  when baked. Even cooked at 350 rather than 375 and for less time. Won't make again.

Tasted good, but cream cheese absorbed into cake, so not what I expected.

A bit of a disaster and I bake a lot,  as mentioned by other reviewers cream cheese filling was like soup. The suggestion that it not touch the side was impossible.  I even added icing sugar to try to thicken it but no good.  Maybe without the egg.....

I have made these twice. I liked this round much better! I added brown sugar to the topping recipe and added a 1/2 teaspoon more cinnamon and also about 1/4 teaspoon of allspice. I think for me it added some additional depth to the muffins. I also added about 1/4 cup more pumpkin. I only made 12 large muffins. I also cut out the additional 1/4 cup of sugar. I always reduce the sugar while baking and everything tastes much better and is a bit healthier. I find most recipes call for an outlandish amount of sugar and I don't think it is necessary.

I made these to take to a house concert last night & they were all eaten.  I used canola oil (that's what I had) and added 1/4 teaspoon cloves & 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice to the batter as per the suggestion of other reviews.  I baked a 5 pound sweetie pumpkin (cut in half) for 1 hr & 20 minutes at 350 degrees then skinned it and put it thru the food processor.  I may have over beaten the cream cheese filling  as I expected to "see" it when done baking but it seemed more like it blended in.  I did put a dent in the batter  and then placed a hefty teaspoonful of cream cheese & topped with the streusel.  I baked the muffins 25 minutes.  The recipe made 24 muffins.  I will be making these again & will beat the cream cheese less.  Yummy recipe!

A-MA-ZING!!!! My husband, who loves Sbux version, actually said he likes these even better. That made me happy. And trust me, he is a truth-teller. My tip is to just use a piping bag to put the filling in properly, or do like I did, and just cut the corner of a ziploc - turning it into a piping bag for the filling. Just press down in the center of each muffin batter filled tin, keeping slight downward pressure while lifting the bag up and out. The muffins are done when the "cheesecake" middle is done.

This recipe was amazing! There wasn't enough of the cream cheese mixture for the amount of batter it made, but they were still delicious :) I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone who loves to bake.  I could even see the cream cheese working with other flavors and types of muffins, not just pumpkin.

These are so good.  My family raved about them. First I always ask Jesus to cook with me. I ask Him to make them taste good.  

In the cream cheese mix, I doubled the recipe and added white sugar and more vanilla for my flavor palette. Then I put it in the fridge while I mixed the other ingredients.  I did not just want a little tad. I wanted those who eat them to have a big middle surprise.

In the Streusal, I used brown sugar and walnuts.  I also doubled this. Then put it in the fridge to harden. It is easier to handle.

The muffins themselves... I did make a few changes.  I used  plain can pumpkin and added my own pumpkin spices. I used fresh ground ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and ground cloves.  I add these to the pumpkin with the sugar until it taste like pumpkin pie.  Then I add the vanilla, eggs and I used veggie oil.  I mixed this well then poured it into the dry ingredients and them mix that well.  The batter should be very thick.

I used paper for my muffins. I used a large metal spoon. I spooned half the pumpkin into the paper, the I put the cream cheese mix into a baggie and cut one of the bottom corners.  I put part of the tip into the pumpkin mix and lifted as I squirted the mix in. It was in the middle of that layer and some on top. Then I added pumpkin mix on top to cover the white. 

I then put a lot of streusal on top and baked.  At about 20 minutes these were done.  They truly are so good...Thank you for the recipe!!!!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I have over half the streusal topping left. Are the measurement correct? I kept looking at the recipe to make sure and I thought I had used the correct amounts. I used about 2 tablespoons on 24 muffins and could probably do another batch with what I have remaining.

I cut the sugar in half and added nutmeg, as well as subbing coconut oil for olive oil. I also omitted the streussel topping and the pecans due to a nut allergy.  The result was 12 (not 24) delicious, smooth muffins with a cream cheese filling/top. Loved it.  Not overly sweet, and very flavorful.

Freaking Amazing! I made it with fresh pumpkin since I had it on hand. The cream cheese seemed to melt in to the muffin. I thought it was great but apparently that's not what was supposed to happen! Lol Still the best flavour and texture I've seen in a long time!

I followed the recipe to the letter and they turned out AMAZING. Super moist and decadent. I had some leftover cream cheese filling and filled a plastic sandwich bag with it, snipped the corner, and drizzled it over the muffins. Definitely will make again.

I used a stick of butter instead of the 1/3 cup olive oil.  I kept everything else the same.  They were moist and tasty - not overly flavorful, but certainly not bland.  They tasted like pumpkin.  lol  The cheese filling was subtle, but I don't know that I would have wanted it overwhelming.  The 4 rating means I liked it, and while I wouldn't say it was the best muffin I've ever had, I more than liked it.

These were very good! I doubled the cream cheese topping because just one block is not nearly enough if you want to actually be able to taste the cream cheese. Also, another reviewer said to add 1/3 cup sugar vs 3 tbsp for the topping but it's unnecessary because the pumpkin muffin itself is already sweet enough. If anything the sugar in the muffin batter could be taken down a bit. For the streusel I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and doubled the amount of pecans because my family is big on pecans (I might even add some to the batter too next time). And it may just have been because my oven was preheated for a long time but I found that the muffins were slightly too browned at the bottom (though cooked perfectly in the middle) so you may want to consider baking at 350 for a longer period of time. Would make again.

AWESOME!  Instead of pumpkin, I used Annie's Fruit Salsa from this website (pureed in food processor) because I was looking to use it up.  The muffins were moist and delicious!!  I eliminated the streusel topping and it was still decadent.  Love this recipe and will definitely make again.  Thanks!

So here is my take on these muffins... They are pretty good if you make them as directed, but I made some changes that I think made them excellent!  I like to eat muffins for breakfast, so I wanted to be able to at least pretend that they were healthy for me.  

I made the cream cheese filling as directed (with reduced fat cream cheese!), but skipped the streusel and ended up just sprinkling the tops with chopped pecans prior to baking.  I also reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  This boosted the flavor and they still ended up plenty sweet.  I also substituted half the oil for apple sauce.

I encountered problems when trying to cover the filling with more batter.  The filling ended up a bit runny, and the batter a bit thick.  I solved this problem by deciding to swirl the filling with the top layer of batter.  They looked a little messy prior to baking, but came out with a lovely marbled/swirl look.  They taste wonderful too!

Soft and moist but if I make them again, I'll A) use less canola oil! It's all I can taste! and B) put in more cinnamon or perhaps some pumpkin spice.

Loved this recipe!! things i did differently was add 1 cup of white sugar and then 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 2 cups of all white sugar. I put the cream cheese filling in a ziplock bag and stuck the tip in the batter and it turned out nicely. I also filled all the muffins to the brim of the tray, so when they cooked they would be giant and exploding out of the tray. They looked wonderful. I would have added pumpkin spice and nutmeg to the recipe as well but I didnt have that at the time myself. They are very moist and dense and delicious

This was my first time making these and I won't make them again. I'm not a beginner baker so I didn't mess up the recipe or anything I was just disappointed with the final flavor. They were a little bland . I'll try a different recipe next time.

Maybe the best muffin I ever made.They completley dissapeared.A few small changes.First I halved the sugar & replaced it with stevia.Cuts about 60 calories per muffin.Used 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon & 1 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice for muffin batter.As outhers have said the cream cheese mixture becomes more like a topping instead of a filling.Next time I will expermint a little more to make a thicker cream cheese.

This recipe was far too much work and lacked the zing of cream cheese. I wouldn't make it again.

I thought it was excellent. I have always been off whenever I measure my ingredients, and the good part was that there was lax with how much you could skimp/splurge on the ingredients without totally ruining the recipe. Great since I am a relatively beginner baker. I will definitely make again. C:

I was surprised this got such high reviews.  I followed the recipe perfectly and they came out exactly like they were supposed to.  Pretty moist, not TOO dense but just nothing to rave about.  I would not make this same recipe again.

These are wonderful muffins.  Made them exactly like the recipe the first time and the filling was really runny.  Next time I added 2 Tbsp of flour to the filling mixture. Also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 1/2 cups white flour.  Increased baking powder to 1 Tbsp and used 1 1/2 c pumpkin.  These are GREAT!

Very good recipe. Fairly time consuming to make but quite good. I won't be making them regularly because of the time involved but will definitely keep the recipe. I followed recipe exactly as written. Next time I may experiment with the spices a bit and substitute brown sugar for the white in the batter.

Very disappointing.  Not enough flavor, but the worst part is they are heavy and thick and did not round at the top but stayed in poor shape.  Luckily i had enough pumpkin to try another recipe (other website) which was perfect.

My family loved these muffins.  After reading the reviews of not enough pumpkin taste or not enough spices I decide to use a box cake mix that I had in the pantry. Though some may cringe at what I did.  I used 1 box of Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Spice cake mix added 1/2 of a large can of pumpkin puree and mixed it together.  The batter was very thick because I did not add any other ingredients.  I then followed the recipe for the cream cheese placing them in wells I had made in the batter and placed the streusel topping and cooked until just done.  The result was a very moist, very yummy muffin.  Every one devoured them.  Try the cake mix.  I promise you will not be disappointed.

So disappointed with the bread part of this muffin.  They were so dry and the texture was horrible.  I was a bit confused with the olive oil.  I have never used olive oil in a sweet muffin before.

I absolutely loved this recipe, but the only thing I'd change about it is that I was wishing as I was eating that it tasted a bit more like pumpkin. Next time I plan on adding some pumpkin pie spice to it, instead of just cinnamon. Otherwise, LOVE!!

I was expecting more from these muffins. They didn't taste much different from the blueberry muffins you bake from a Pillsbury package (minus the blueberries) or bland Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal... that said, they were kind of tasteless. 

The last "Cream cheese-filled pumpkin muffins recipe" I used turned out great, with the exception that the cream cheese "filling" was nothing more than scooping in a glob of cream cheese into the center of the muffin. It didn't taste bad, but I was looking for more of a smooth "filling" like in Starbucks's Cream Cheese-Filling Pumpkin Muffins. 

I thought this recipe might have the solution for this "filling" I was trying to replicate, but no. Instead, the cream cheese "filling" in this recipe got baked in with the rest of the muffin, so there really wasn't any filling present in the muffins after they came out of the oven. I suspected that was going to happen when I saw how soupy the filling became after mixing in all the ingredients. 

Even though the other recipe I tried had me eating a muffin that in it had a block of cream cheese, I liked it a lot better than this one.

The only spice this recipe calls for is cinnamon, while the other recipe I tried calls for cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ground cloves, pumpkin pie spice, and ginger. Talk about a big difference...

I like the streusel topping in this recipe, but that's about it.

I thought this recipe was fabulous!  I made these for a community fish fry dessert and got rave reviews from people of all ages.  I did add 1 teaspoon of ginger and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to the pumpkin mixture.  I also used a few suggestions that worked very well.  1. I "dug" a little well in the pumpkin mixture in the cupcake pan.  2. I put the cream cheese mixture in a bag and cut the corner to make that part easier.  They were REALLY good right out of the oven, still good after they cooled, but if you have the opportunity, warm it slightly before serving them (microwave only about 15 seconds).  I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

This wasn't what I was looking for and I'm not sure it even exists. The cream cheese part of the muffin is missing something and I cannot pinpoint what it is. Maybe it's not sweet enough. I wanted a cream cheese muffin and a pumpkin muffin mixed. The cream cheese part stayed sticky moist and not cakey. The pumpkin mix was great.

Really good.  Cooked for exactly 20 minutes. Super moist. I don't measure things exactly, of course.  Didn't have vanilla so I used almond extract.  Added a lot more seasoning-pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon liberally in the topping and the batter.  Didn't have enough olive oil so added melted butter.  The cream cheese was perfect consistency, I used it right out of the fridge and then blended it. Made about 28 muffins.

SO YUMMY! They smell great while baking and taste best fresh from the oven. I followed the recipe as is except I added pumpkin pie spice to both the topping and the batter per another users suggestion. This are really great comfort food.

Wonderful results!  I left the topping off because we enjoy the taste of the cream cheese and pumpkin flavors alone.  I've made other recipes including my own versions but I'd liked this one better.

These muffins are fabulous! I only had 4 oz of cream cheese, so I made half of the filling recipe and the whole muffin and topping recipe. I filled half the muffins and left the other half unfilled. Both we awesome, though I preferred the filled muffins. My kids could not get enough. The only other change I made was that I left out the nuts because the kids don't like them. I also added 1/2 tsp chinese five-spice powder. Sounds weird, but I add it to all my pumpkin recipes. You should try it! Next time I think I will double the topping recipe just to up the recipe even more. These were better than any bakery muffin.

Very dense muffins, they might be better as mini-muffins.  They tasted good and looked very pretty too, great for a brunch or tea.

This is the first time I have ever given one star to anything. Just like another reviewer suggested read the 2,3,4 star reviews before wasting your time and money on this recipe. I am not a novice to baking by any means  and I will not make this again. What a shame I was making them to serve at Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow but instead I will have to make something else. How did this recipe end up with so many great reviews is beyond me.

Delicious! I used canned pumpkin pie mix instead of pumpkin puree and it came out great. It may have added to the flavor, also. Added sugar all round and subbed walnuts for pecans.

For as much sugar as these contain they do not have much flavor. But I got MANY compliments on them...Yumm

It was ok but the olive oil makes the muffins to tough. the cream cheese needs a bit more sugar.

Tastes just like a yummy, pumpkin coffee cake.  Super good.  I would cut back on the streusel topping (I just don't like the topping as much) and definitely don't skim on the cream cheese!

Best Pumpkin Cream Cheese Streusel Muffins ever!!  I used dark brown sugar, gave a little extra character.  Didn't have pecans, used walnuts instead.  Anxious to make them again w/ pecans.

I ve made these a few times and following the recipe they where yummy, though this last batch I put half the batter in another bowl and added 3 tablespoons chocolate powder. When I filled the papers I put one spoon full normal batter and then one spoonfull chocolate batter and topped with the crumb topping. I didnt have cream cheese so I skipped that part and it still turned out wonderfull.

This was my first time baking these. Granted I am farely new at baking/cooking but these muffins to me and my family were very very dense. I threw half the batch away as they just weren't good. I added the spices commented from other reviews and used applesauce instead of the oil. My filling also was more like a soup and was hard to pipe into the center. I might give theses another try as I might have our mixed or the oven was too hot but still they just didn't make the cut this time. the only good thing i can say is i love the cream cheese filling. I had to beat my husband away from that bowl with a stick :)

Excellent.  The only change I made was to add almost double how much cinnamon I added to the mix.  The temperature and time was right on.  People said they tasted better than starbuck's muffins!  I will definitely make them again.

More like a muffin than a cupcake.   Too dense for a cupcake...  However, they do taste good.  Used a piping bag to add the filling.

Yummy!  I will double the cream cheese topping recipe next time and put 2 tbsp. on each muffin.  As the recipe is now I ran out of topping just using 1 tbsp.

This is an excellent recipe.  I baked mine for 20 mins. exactly and they were super moist.  I did add 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice (not sure if that made a difference).  I also used the tip of a spatula to make an indentation for the filling.  The next time I might try adding 1/4 cup batter, then a dollop of filling, then another 1/4 cup batter.  This recipe is a keeper!

These were very good, and beautiful muffins. I added some ground ginger, nutmeg, and a pinch of allspice. I followed the recipe, and I thought the results were great. The only comment is that the muffin was quite dense. I didn't over mix it, but it came out pretty heavy in texture. I will make again, maybe playing around with the texture. Thanks for a good recipe!

These are good! followed exactly. except that the cream cheese filling just covered the top of the muffin and didn't stay in the middle. next time i will try to pipe the cream cheese mixture directly into the middle, or layer the batter, cream cheese, and more batter

this was the most amazing muffin recipe I have ever made. I ended up with 24 and I wasn't going to be able to eat them all.. (although, if you dared me, I could) So i brought them to my boyfriends restaurant while he was working and shared them with him and his co-workers who all loved them! my only change to the recipe was adding 1 cup of fresh blueberries my boyfriends dad picked at their lake house in New Hampshire.  I will make these again, no doubt.

These came out well, even though I did make a couple alterations and one almost fatal mistake. My mistake: I started with the cream cheese at room temp, and in rereading the recipe, I don't see it saying to do that. I know why now, next time it will be cold. I added a couple tablespoons of flour to try to thicken it up and put it in the fridge while I made the streusel and the muffins.  I added a bit of nutmeg and cloves to the muffin mix, and used brown sugar in the streusel topping. I omitted the chopped pecans (I didn't have any.)  Olive oil became vegetable oil. I used jumbo muffin cups and the muffins turned out tender and flavourful.  (And large enough for a meal and a half. Those jumbo muffin cups sure make a huge muffin.)

Great recipe. I did it exactly as indicated here. I was worried it would be too sweet with all the sugar, but I think it was perfect - the cream cheese part was sweeter than the pumpkin batter so it balanced out well. These are a huge hit with my coworkers!

These were very good, however we made some minor changes. For all the amounts of cinnamon in the recipe we used half as a much and replaced the remainder with a combination of ground allspice, nutmeg and cloves. This gave the muffins that "autumn" taste I'm already longing for, and summer has barely begun! We decided to use canola oil instead of the olive variety as we only have EVOO, and having previously used it in a dessert recipe calling for olive oil with not-too-great results taste-wise we felt this was the safest way to go. We had some difficulty placing the filling onto the muffins while indenting them at the same time as the batter was very sticky. We gave up and just poured a teaspoon of filling on each, rather than a tablespoon. In any case, we still got the even layer of filling on top of each muffin. The pumpkin flavour, however, barely came through if at all. My hubby-to-be hates pumpkin, but said these tasted like a carrot muffin so he liked them. I was definitely hoping for a stronger pumpkin flavour. Maybe increasing the pumpkin to two cups would help with taste and moisture? They were a little dry. Streusel amount was perfect, not sure why other reviewers said to double it... A little goes along way considering the richness of this muffin. Our batch made 16 good-size muffins.

While these muffins tasted very very yummy, they were not what I expected.  The cream cheese "filling" was more like a cream cheese, custardy topping, and the amount of struesel was not enough for all the muffins I got out of the batter (which was about 24, not 18).  Next time, I will probably double the streusel.  Although i would make some changes to the muffins, they were VERY good.  I made them for a friend for her birthday and she said that between her and her family, they were gone in a day!  These muffins are also extremely moist and have a nice pumpkin flavor.  I will definitely be making these again(with my minor changes) in the fall perhaps for gifts during the holidays!

These are great! Made them for playgroup, the kids and moms loved them. I did follow the recipe and I like it as is. They are a little time consuming to make, measuring everything is a little annoying, but they do taste good. Thanks.

These are good. A couple things that would make it a 5 star is some spice in the muffin, and maybe not so much sugar in the cream cheese filling. Family loved them!

These muffins were super fabulous! The cream cheese filling/topping really added a special flavour to the muffins, goes super well with the pumpkin. I adjusted the recipe to what the other reviewers suggested, and they turned out perfect! Will definitely make it again, except maybe leave out the cream cheese, just to try it out! All in all, great recipe!

I never liked pumpkin until these muffins.  The flavor is mild though.  I follow the directions exactly and use the streusel topping for other muffins as well.

These were dry and too much work to not be able to taste the cream cheese mixture (which was very runny prior to baking and not all all a "filling").  The pumpkin part was dry and dense.  My kids devoured them, however.  That's why I give the recipe 2 stars and not one.

I thought that these were REALLY good! However I don't think that I put enough cream cheese in the middle and thought that it needed more (I ended up throwing some out) . Next time I will use all of it! Also I did add 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the muffin batter and also used brown sugar in the streudel mix. I loved it!

These were very delicious. The streusel topping really sets them apart. I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but my cream cheese filling was very runny didn't really just set on top like I thought it should... but it was still delcious. I did as another reviewer said and put a tiny amount of the batter in the cup, then the cream cheese mixture, then a little more batter, this worked nicely, or doing it the way the recipe calls for is good also. Yum!

These heavenly muffins were a smash hit at this year's Halloween party. Not to be confused with cupcakes, these little beauties have a muffin-like density and are super moist. The streusel topping is nice, but I was more conservative with that and added my own whipped topping with nutmeg. Delish!

Fantastic muffins! Definitely the best I've ever made (and I hope to make them again sometime soon).   As for the cream cheese-- I realized, after putting the batter into two of the cups, that the cream cheese would be on top at the end of baking.  So, I just dolloped the cream cheese in a little before they were half full, and then put the rest of the muffin batter for that muffin on top. Tada-a delicious pumpkin muffin with streusel topping and cream cheese center as described.  As I tried them both ways, I preferred the latter. They were a little bit stickier than I thought they would be, but I really liked them that way. I'm going to chalk the stickiness up to FL humidity and my lack of baking prowess.

We made substitutions to make these low-fat, low-sugar and they were amazing and decadent!!!  Used applesauce for the oil and splenda for the white sugar.  Also used light cream cheese!  Highly recommend!!

We used this recipe for bread too and we think that turned out even better than our muffins.  Skip the topping and use butter to change it up a bit.

very good. I think it would be even more amazing if I used a ziploc bag and piped it in the middle. The cream cheese just sat on top, and though it wasn't bad, I would like to switch it up. I didn't have pecans, so didn't use them.

These are the muffins to make when you're aiming to impress.  They look like they came straight from the bakery.  Awesome.  Unless you're working with jumbo muffin tins, even 1  tablespoon of filling was a little too much to fit in there.  I made this with whole wheat flour, but in retrospect, would increase the white to WW ratio.  I also used reduced-fat cream cheese and it worked great.  Love that crumbly topping!

These are good but I think they would be better with more spices. I would like to try adding ginger, cloves, and nutmeg to the pumpkin batter. This recipe made 24 muffins when I made it. I wasn't able to keep the cream cheese filling from touching the sides because it was somewhat runny, I think from the egg. But they turned out fine anyway. I left the nuts out of the topping because I didn't have any. It was good without, but I'm sure they'd made a nice addition.

The basic batter was very, very good - I had three people ask me for the recipe. I did use the cream cheese bit, but it just seemed too watery. When I make these again, I'll leave it out. I didn't bother with the streusel in the first place.

Really good, although next time I would omit the egg from the cream cheese mixture.  I did add more cinnamon and some nutmeg and cloves.

This was great way to start my Halloween Week! Be careful, they are addicting!  Also once they have been cooled, warm them up in the microwave just before eating and the cream cheese will melt in your mouth and hit every spot!!

THESE MADE MY HUBBY SAY 'OH WOW!!!!' ONCE HE FINALLY TOOK A BREATH! I can't believe it has taken me so long to rate this recipe. I have been using it for over a year IT IS FAB!!! With a few minor changes... first omit the egg in the cream cheese filling it makes it way too runny. I drop a Tablespoon of the cream cheese mixture into the muffin and cover the top of it. Also, I never used the olive oil (I never thought it would taste good) I use Veg Oil. Also I add a nice amount of Pumpkin Pie Spice, a dash of ginger and dash of nutmeg ( I cook by feel sorry) Also I use the whole large can of the Pumpkin. I am going to try this in a large square pan like a coffee cake this week instead of muffins. I'll update how it turns out!

I followed the recipe exactly as written (minus the nuts) While I think it's good, I would probably add some nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice to the batter. It came out a little more dry and not as moist as I would have liked. But overall it's pretty tasty and hit the spot for a fall afternoon treat!

I did as others and added an additional 1/2 block of cream cheese, I also added pumpkin spice to the batter, put small amount of batter in muffin pan, added cream cheese mixture then another layer batter, topped with the pecan brown sugar mixture, YUMMY, my picky hubby would not even taste them because he saw the recipe and when he read "Pumpkin" he refused to try them.  Everyone else who had them said they are great.  A little extra work, but worth it, I ended up with 24 cupcakes.

Oh my goodness! These are amazing.   My mouth was watering the 25 min they were in the oven! I omitted the pecans since some people in my family don't like them, but they were still amazing.  I put some of the muffin mix on the bottom, then the filling, then the mix again.  They came out great this way.  Dunkin Donuts has a delicious pumpkin muffin, but its seasonal.  I am always dying for October to come.  Now I will be making these all year round.  Thanks!  By the way.  They sell canned pumpkin with the pumpkin spice mix already in.  Not sure if they have it all over, but it worked great for me.

I love pumpkin and these are great.  Husband requested something with cream cheese instead just plain pumpkin bread.  Cream cheese mixture was runny and I could not get the cream cheese to sit in the middle of filling.  It ran to the edges. Didn't matter in the least.  They are awesome.  I made the batter recipe again with the extra pumpkin from the large can and just put the batter in loaf pans.  Will make again for sure!

These were absolutely delicious.  They looked a bit of a hot mess when I put them in the oven, but they came out looking completely amazing and tasting even better.  I finished the batch I made in an embarrassingly short amount of time.

These muffins were delicious! I did a few subs though.  Instead of olive oil I used a lite canola oil and in the struesel I used 3 1/2 Tbsp of brown sugar instead of the white sugar. I also had no pecans in the house and went with walnuts. Everyone who tried them loved them; a new house favorite. A great way to welcome fall!

These muffins are AWESOME!!! I cut the recipe in half and made it in mini muffin tins...I got 18 mini muffins when I did this. The only problem I had was that they had a distinct olive oil taste and smell...it wasn't quite unpleasant, but certainly unexpected. I did use extra virgin olive oil, though...next time, I will use a less potent oil! Other than that, I made the recipe as stated, no changes. These are perfect just as they are! They are wonderful, and aren't all that bad for you, either! The pumpkin replaces most of the oil in this recipe, making the muffins tender and adding flavor without adding tons of fat. Thanks so much for sharing this one! It is awesome!

These are so good!  The only "change" I made was to put in the entire can of pumpkin (about 1 3/4 cup as opposed to the 1 1/3 cup called for in the recipe) but other than that I followed the recipe just as written and they came out perfect!  How can you go wrong with cheesecake on top of a pumpkin muffin?  They are outstanding!

These turned out ok.  I used fresh baked pumpkin in place of canned pumpkin. The batter was still dry when I combined the wet and dry ingredients, so I added a bit of milk.  Had to be the fresh pumpkin.  I was worried they wouldn't rise since I had to do that extra mixing, but they rose well.     I only gave 3 stars because it needed more spice (I added 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice), because the cream cheese "filling" just sat on top (even though I followed another reviewer's tip to burrow it down in the batter), and because the batter had entirely too much sugar.  I think 1c would've been plenty.  If I make these again I would omit the sugar topping, cut the sugar in 1/2, and either swirl the cream cheese with the muffin batter when I add it to the cups or spread it evenly on top, but I think all the extras take away from the pumpkin flavor.

Excellently yummy! Nice variety of textures and flavors and they are nice looking too. I also added cloves and nutmeg, but didn't change anything else. They are moist but light. I made them for work and they disappeared! I will surely make these again, perhaps even adding more than the 1/4 tsp of cloves and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Thanks for sharing!

I used 15 oz. of pumpkins and cooked for about 24 minutes.  Delicious.  I couldn't get enough of the filling in, so it was just a hint of the cream cheese taste - I would have liked more, but oh well. Co-workers LOVED these.  They are very moist and fairly quick to make.

These muffins are incredible, I made 2 different sizes and the larger ones went before the smaller ones. Everytime I looked up, another one was missing....LOL oh yeah, I am a cook at a deli and I am looking for new recipes all the time.  This one is a KEEPER.

I have made these a few times and they always turn out great! Mine always end up with a cream cheese topping, instead of a filling, but that's what I like most about these muffins.

Very tastey and easy to make , depsite the multiple steps. I was not careful at all when putting on the cream cheese topping, and had no trouble with it sticking to the paper muffin cups. Next time I too will add some nutmeg to the muffin batter - it could use a little 'umph', but I'm glad I made it as written first, so I could figure out what it needed to make them 5-star for my family. Thanks for the recipe!

*UPDATE* After making these the second time, I did make 24 muffins. I did make a little more of the cream cheese topping and more of the streusal topping to make up for the extra muffins. Fantastic and the best pumpkin muffins I've ever had.

I have made a lot of muffins and this one is my kids absolute favorite, their friends at school all ask for them and willing to trade anything. They are moist and full of flavour. I do like to serve them slightly warmed.

These are delicious!! I substituted fat free cream cheese, and vanilla yogurt in place of the oil to make myself believe that they were actually ok to have for breakfast and they came out fantastic. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were very good! Interesting how the cream cheese mixture goes on top instead of hidden inside... a big hit here, but the muffin tops were definitely tastier than the bottoms!

These muffins did turn out very pretty. I didn't give them 5 stars because the muffin itself is a little bland. I would make again with some alterations. The topping adds some sweetness.

Very tasty. Cream cheese mixture was very runny. It was hard to make some type of indent in the pumpkin mixture to get the cream cheese mixture to stay in the middle and essentially it didn't. Tasted great!

Cream cheese layer is a really nice addition.  I think it looked best when I added a small amount of muffin mix over the cream cheese mix, and then topped with streusel topping.  I added some brown sugar into the streusel topping and I think next time I will skip the white sugar all together.

This is a great recipe, especially for some of that canned pumpkin leftover from Christmas. I didn't change much but added more vanilla where called (can't go wrong with that) and I added some cloves, allspice, and nutmeg to the batter. For the streusel, the trick is to use softened butter, mush together with your hands then cut with a fork. Place the streusel in the freezer until you are ready to use it. It is much easier to work with then. Thanks for the recipe!

Need to double the cream cheese filling and the topping.  Keep the cream cheese firm to help pipe it into the muffin.  Slightly press the topping into the batter.

Delish- Looks and tastes much more difficult than they really are to make. Did not change a thing. Like other posts, it is a 'topping' not a filling.

Based on reading the reviews I made several changes to the recipe.

I left the egg out of the cream cheese mixture, subbed brown sugar for the white in the topping and doubled the amount I made of the topping.

I also used canola instead of olive oil.

I didn't make as muffins, simply spread 2/3rds of the batter in a pan, dolloped the cream cheese on that, finished with the rest of the batter and then sprinkled on the topping.  

It turned out very moist, great flavor, co-workers LOVED it!  No leftovers.  :)

These were very good, but the work involved wasn't worth it. Also, there wasn't enough of the cream cheese mixture, and my streusel topping didn't turn out- it was like sugar paste. Maybe skip the topping and increase the cream cheese.

This was the VERY First time I have made these. I usually never bake anything from scratch, I want to get into doing this much more. I LOVE fall, and anything pumpkin. So I gave it a try, they turned out good, my husband loved them & co-workers. I was worried about one thing, the Cream cheese filling. This tuned out very soupy, I still topped it off and placed the stousel ontop. Basically the cream cheese glazed the top, I'm not sure if that was suppose to happen. From what I am reading here and seeing pictures, it should have been more like a cheese cake consistancy.  =)=) Otherwise, they turned out great, very pumpkiney!!

YUM-MY!!  had no problems with the cream cheese filling touching the paper cups. i refrigerated the cream cheese until i was ready to fill the muffins. then i took it out and made the filling. a little eggy, but it's really good. i've never tasted anything pupkin that is sweet, and i'll definitely be making more of this pumkin muffin!

**i used 1/2 cup chopped walnuts instead of pecans, and they turned out just great

This was my first successful muffin recipe!  These turned out very well! And I would agree with comments made by a couple of the other reviewers that it is best not to beat the cream cheese completely smooth.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and they turned out fantastic. We loved them. The batter was very stiff and made a wonderful moist muffin. We loved the way the cream cheese puffed up into the streusel topping making it very beautiful and inviting. Everyone loved them. Great flavor, great appearance, this one is a keeper! 5 stars from our family.

These were fantastic.  I didn't have any oil in the house and used Milled Flax Seed in it's place and while it was a little heavier and had to make sure not to overbake, they were fantastic.  One of these fills up my hungry little guys, they think they are getting a treat, I know they are getting something good for them.  I'll be make alot more of these!  YUM YUM!

These muffins are awesome! Just the right amount of sweetness and the cream cheese is a perfect touch! I'll be making these for Thanksgiving!

These were great! I will definitely double my cream cheese mixture next time and add more spice. Some nutmeg would be great. The cream cheese mixture is really good but I found I didn't have enough to add a whole tablespoon to each muffin.

i rated this recipe 4 out of 5 for only one reason.  I had to play with the creame cheese filling to get it right.  I should have read the first persons review on this because if you beat the heck out of the creame cheese, it turns into soup.  I found it was okay to have it a lil' thick.  It tastes so yummy that way.  Also, i got a little worried when i seen that the muffin mixture was a little bit thick and i was thinking, "Oh my god i messed it up" but it's supposed to be that way.  So don't worry. lol  I wish someone would have wrote that so i wouldn't have stressed.  I'm so glad i found this recipe because these muffins tasts so good and yummy.

Great recipe for the fall when people start thinking about pumpkin pie. Doubling both the cream cheese mixture and the streusel topping gives you more "yum" to work with. I would also suggest adding a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the batter like others have suggested.

These muffins turned out GREAT! The only changes I used were I only had pumpkin pie filling so I decreased the cinnamon a little.  The texture and flavor were perfect and these were a big hit for my party!

I made these for a bake sale at my husband's work, and they were wonderful!!!! I especially like the way the cream cheese mix puffs up through the topping--very pretty.

The batter made enough for 24 muffins, but I had to make extra topping because I used enough to completely cover each muffin.

I also added an extra block of cream cheese to that mixture because it seemed very watery with just one. The extra cheese yielded enough cream cheese mix to put a generous dollop on each muffin. I'm not sure I would have had enough for all 24 otherwise.

Other than the extra cream cheese, I didn't change a thing because I don't think it's fair to do so and then rate the original recipe. Even without making changes suggested by other users, these were yummy!!! They will definitely be a fall staple in our house.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.. the only thing i had a problem with was the streusel topping. Because the filling wasnt exactly a filling and kind of sat on top.. the streusel slid off the top of the cream cheese and puddled around the rim of the muffin. I'll probably make these again  but next time i would use less butter with the steusel topping and add a little more spice to the muffins (nutmeg/ginger)

These were really good. I used almonds instead of pecans since that was what I had and it turned out nicely. Next time I may add some wheat flour. The edges were chewy (which some people prefer) but I think that next time I'll make it in a bread pan so that there's less of the edge. The cream cheese layer reminds me of a danish.

The only thing -- the cream cheese part was my favorite, I think I want to double that next time!

Very Very good!  This made 12 regular sized muffins and 9 mini muffins.  I made the mini muffins with no cheesecake mixture or topping and they were very good too!  In fact, they were not as sweet and were a good snack in the afternoon.

I was really craving Starbucks cream cheese pumpkin muffins, so I thought I'd give these a whirl. Unfortunately, I couldn't even taste the cream cheese part, and I thought that the pumpkin was a little bland. I think that it needs more spice...maybe nutmeg, allspice or cloves. The recipe also made way  more than 18 muffins...so I made 12 muffins and one loaf. My kids gobbled them up.

I'm a pretty competent baker so I was very disappointed with the results of these muffins.  The batter was extremely stiff and the filling was very runny.  Consequently, I didn't get a nice round dollop of filling in the middle of the muffin but rather a thin layer of cream cheese mixture running through the muffin.  Even after extra time in the oven, the bottom of the muffins still seemed to be on the raw side.  The pumpkin taste was really lost with all the other things going on (filling, streusel topping).  I'm glad others have had good results but these aren't what I was looking for.  I'm giving three stars simply because they still satisfied my sweet tooth and that's always a good thing.

Fantastic recipe!  I followed a few suggestions of other reviewers and used half white sugar half brown, and used a whole 15 ounce can of pumpkin.  Really tasty!

OH!! These are delicious.  I make a lot of muffins and these are by far the best.  I made them by the recipe except I doubled the topping.  Because of previous reviews, I was a little concerned about the cream cheese filling being "soupy".  However, mine was not soupy at all.  I got 18 muffins and they cooked 25 minutes on 375.  Oh, I can't wait until tomorrow to eat one, or maybe TWO with my coffee.  My daughter and I have already had 1 1/2 each and they have barely had time to cool.  This is a keeper recipe for sure!!

These are awsome! Even my husband who doesn't like cream cheese, really likes these. The only thing I changed was doubling the struesel topping ingredients. I like my muffins with a lot of crumbly struesel. 
Update: For Christmas, I made a couple dozen of these and took one to each of my co-workers and handed out a copy of the recipe. Everyone raved about them.

Good recipe, but even after following the advice of GR8SCOTT, my cream cheese filling still looked like soup.  Next time I will beat the egg, vanilla, and brown sugar.  Then I will lightly mix in *double* the cream cheese for a thicker consistency.

Another option to the "cheesecake topping" result, would be to layer the muffin cup with batter, cream cheese filling, batter, then streusel topping.

As far as the streusel topping...I like lots!  Next time I will double the recipe for the topping.

I love this recipe.  We don't even get to day 3 with these in the house.  They are amazing and everyone loves them.
We think it's the cream cheese topping that makes these soo yummy!

I made these for my Sunday school class and they loved them. One lady told me I could not come to Sunday school if I did not make them again.
The muffins were super moist. The cream cheese does add some excitement to the mix. I did not have a problem when I let the cream cheese touch the liner. (I could not figure out how to get it not to.)It was fairly easy and straight forward to make.

Super delish!! My kids, even my 2-yr-old, love these.  I just put the whole can of pumpkin in and got a couple of extra muffins.  It's a good thing, too, because they disappeared quickly!

Try adding more pecans and brown sugar to topping.  Also the cream cheese mixture isn't really a filling, it is more like a topping.  Try making a bit of a hole by using 2 butter knives to separate the pumpkin dough.  Other reviews suggested using pumpkin pie spice or nutmeg.  It makes 24 muffins.  Also fill up the liner about 2/3 full of pumpkin mixture.

Wow the whole family loved them.  The crumb did not come out crumby at all it came out like a dough, but I put a little bit of the crumb dough on the top of the cream chesses mix, and it came out very nice.  These muffins were delectable.

I made this recipe today exactly as stated (except for a pinch of nutmeg in the muffin mix) and I loved them.  My husband thinks they are kind of gooey, but I loved them.  I didn't have any trouble with the filling sticking to the paper muffin cups either.  Will probably make these again.

I didn't really change anything in this recipe except using some pumpkin pie seasoning as well as cinnamon.  All components were used up equally.  I would probably make more cream cheese mixture if I make again.    

This recipe is a little time consuming with mixing 3 different things and adding the 3 different mixes to the muffin pan.
BUT it was fun and they turned out really great.  
I wasn't at home when my husband tasted them and he had to call me to tell me how awesome they were.
He also emailed me the next morning to say "they may be the best muffins in the world ever".

These are wonderful!  I would make a little more of the cream cheese mixture and for the pumpkin, I would add pumpkin spices; nevertheless, this recipe really delivered.  My friend tried one and asked if she could have another- the mark of a good recipe.

Perfect muffin consistency but I do have a few comments.  I used whole wheat flour and added brown sugar to the crumble topping.  I wasn't too crazy about the cream cheese filling but my husband loved them.  Said they were even better the next day.

This was very good.  Does timing play a factor on how moist it can get?  Anyone baked these more than once and know how to make it more moist??

When I made these, I was worried no one would like them...and then my fiance ate 12 of them before the night was out!

I can get 24 muffins out of one recipe.  My only complaint is that I, personally, am having a hard time getting the cream cheese to stay in the middle of the muffin.  It gets pushed out to the edges as the muffins bake.

Fantastic recipe.  I think I'll try more of the cream cheese mix next time.

Good taste, but the cream cheese filling didn't work well, very soupy and diffilcult to apply. I tried to make a well to have it in the middle instead of the top but the batter was too moist to do that.

These had a good flavor, but the texture left something to be desired.  They were very dense and I did not enjoy that the cream cheese just melted on top.  I took these into work, usually things get snatched up immediately, but with this recipe there were plenty left at the end of the day.  :(

These muffins were delicious. Quite a bit of work though. I, like others found the cream cheese mixture to be very runny. I followed advice of others and  didn't mix all the lumps out. I put it back in the fridge for a couple of hours but it didn't thicken up much. Like one person said, it's more of a topping than a filling. I wish there was some way to turn it into a filling. I think that would be a nice surprise since they are covered with streusel. Maybe a bit of flour added to the cream cheese? Very good flavor though.

I tried this today (the first time I attempted to bake from scratch) and they turned out FABULOUS! I just loved them to death and my family did, too.  Next time I think I will be using a little less sugar though, maybe a third less than the recipe calls for.  And when I was using the cream cheese filling, I sort of sandwiched it between to globs of batter.  Thanks for the great recipe, I'll definitely be doingthis again!

These are wonderful muffins!  I did make some minor alterations though.  My son hates nuts so I left out the pecans.  I also added coconut to the pumpkin batter...both my sons ate several(I think at last count I ate 5...lol)

As far as muffins go, these muffins were just ok.  I was dissapointed in the cream cheese was absorbed by the muffin mix when baking.  There was no sign of the cream cheese when they got out of the oven.  Next time, I would leave out the egg in the cream cheese mix and perhaps top it off with a dollop of batter.

I was super excited to make these muffins based on the reviews.   However, there was a lot of work and the filling just seemed so runny when I added it. It seemed pointless because the filling just baked in with the muffin.  I followed the filling and muffin recipe to a tee, too. Maybe if you omit the egg with the cream cheese, it would not be as runny.  A note too the batter was really thick which scared me.  I did double the streusel ---YUM!!  The muffins turned out to be delicious.  I will make them again without the filling, however.

Too much filling if you follow their instructions, however I think you could make 12 nice muffins with batter, filling (more than 1 tbsp), more batter, then streusal. The muffins I made that way were more attractive. I also added a lot more spices than just cinnamon. Finally, I ate several when they were still warm out of the oven and that didn't do them justice! They are actually better cool and getting better as they sit. More like little cakes than muffins. Oh I also subbed out 1c flour for whole wheat flour and while I taste it ever so slightly they're still very good.

Very good!  Followed the directions exactly.  Made some with the chopped pecans and some without for the kids and everyone gobbled them up.  Thanks Barb.  I can honestly say that these are my favorite out of all the muffin recipes that I have made and tried so far!

OH MY GOD! These are the best muffins I have ever made. I followed the recipe except for the streusel topping, I added a little brown sugar and a little more flour because it was a tad to moist. They turned out excellent and I will defenatly be making these again so!

Oh wow! These are good! I almost followed the recipe to a tee. I added a little more cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I substituted veggie oil for the olive oil; and I replaced half of the white sugar with brown. Next time, I'll follow the advice of others and double the cream cheese mixture. Thanks for submitting the perfect recipe for Fall!

These were okay. I made them according to the recipe and they were not very flavorful. I would recommend adding some other spices as others have suggested. It's kind of hard to find any creme cheese after the muffins are baked. In my opinion, they're not worth the effort and dirty dishes.

I loved this recipe and had a horrible time trying to find it to review it!  I had to put in the submitter's name to find it.  I searched breads, muffins, and cake and no recipe.  Anyway, I ran out of cream cheese for the top and even without the cream cheese, they were still delicious.

I made these muffins for my job and they loved it. I did make a couple of changes. I added 1/4 cup of fat free half and half, 1 teaspoon of ground ginger, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and a 1/2 teaspoon of allspice, and 1/2 teaspoon of black walnut extract.  DID THAT EVER TASTE GOOD. I did like the way the cream cheese covered the muffin, and adding the spices and the half and half did not make it as dense and it added a lot of flavor to the muffins. TRUST ME!! I also used walnuts instead of pecans since i did not have pecans. That worked fine. I think next time I will add some chopped walnuts to the muffin batter. That would be really yummy!! THANKS BARB. THIS RECIPE IS A WINNER!!!!!!!!!!! and great with a nice cup of Joe!! :O)

I had high hopes for this one, and they were met!  This is very good!  The only change I made was to increase the amount of pecans in the topping.  Also, I used a spoon to make a well in the pumpkin batter so the cream cheese filling would not run over.  Yum!

These are awesome. My family and co-workers loved them. Next time I would add more pecans to the struttle mix.

These muffins were absolutely delicious.  However, I did substitute the eggs with egg beaters, used Splenda in place of the granulated sugar, and used the reduced fat cream cheese, all in trying to make them a little bit healthier.

These muffins are great.  They are not too sweet, have just the right amount of cream cheese, and are nice and filling.  I'm always searching for different muffin recipes for breakfast, and I'll definitely make these again.

This recipe was great.  My husband is a  Marine Corps Drill Instructor and His fellow drill instructors even asked for the recipe so their wives could make it.  When a man askes for a recipe that tells me that they enjoyed it.  I did skip the egg in the cream cheese mixture so it would stay creamy and added nutmeg, ground cloves, and 1/2 cup of extra sugar in the muffin mixture.

I made these as a test for my in home daycare I will be starting. I am on the great muffin hunt. My 19 month old loved them. My 17 yr old cousin loved them. My 60 yr old dad loved them. 
I tried the cream cheese with out the egg and it made more like a cream cheese middle. I pushed it down inside some.

I did add the extra seasonings and it worked I like the idea of a loaf will have to try that.

More pumpkin flavour would be nice, but my children loved them. I did not use pecans (family doesn't like them) and I used canola oil instead of olive oil. As always, I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. and I replaced cinnamon (in the batter and and topping) with "cake spice" from Penzeys...it's almost like pumpkin pie spice only better. When working with a 3 and 5 year old it's hard to follow directions exactly, but they turned out great anyway. Even my picky 5 year old liked them.

I was disappointed in these muffins. I was really looking forward to making them.  They sounded delicious, we love dense heavy cake, and most of the reviews were glowing.  Unfortunately I found them to be without much taste, even though I took one reviewers advice and added some nutmeg.  Won't be making them again.

We'll stick with the Pumpkin Chip Muffins from this site.  My 8 year old loves them!

Interesting side note - Since I wasn't wild about these and my mom was looking for items for a friend's bake sale, I donated them.  They all sold and two people asked for the recipe, so I guess its just personal preference!

These are delicious muffins - the cream cheese cooks right into the muffin batter though.  It's ok by me - they still taste great!  They do look nice when done - I arranged them in a basket and photographed them.  They are dense muffins and pretty heavy - which make them a perfect, filling snack!
