Excellent! I made this with the wild raspberries that grow in my yard. Red and Black. It is easy and delish! I gave it as gifts and have been asked for the recipe over and over.

I made a small version of this the other day and let it sit in the fridge until today, and then I mixed it with Red Raspberry Wine Vinaigrette Dressing from this site.  In all reality I think the vinegar could have been just fine on its own without any other ingredients.  Someone is asking why there is sugar in this recipe, and that's because I think it offsets the tartness/acidity of the vinegar and fruit in nice style. I do believe that tomorrow with my salad I'll just mix this with lemon olive oil and be just fine with that. I would definitely make this again!  Thank you, sal!

because raspberries are tart and vinegar is tangy. the sugar adds the "hint of sweetness" desired in any berry vinaigrette.

This is simple and most delicious. I will certainly make it again. I've found it to be very good on salad, blended with a little Balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

Easy peasy.  Tastes great on spinach and cranberry salad.
