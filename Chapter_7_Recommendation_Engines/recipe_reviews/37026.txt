I browned the ribs after marinading and then threw the whole mess...ribs and marinade in a crock pot.  It was fabulous and received many many compliments and requests for the recipe.

Yum!  This was such a nice change from the typical ketchupy bbq ribs.  The only change I made was in cooking method, because I don't have an outdoor grill.  I put the ribs in a dish, poured the remaining marinade over them, covered them and baked at 350 for 1 hour.  They were fall off the bone tender.  Thanks for the recipe!

FYI- Jack Daniels isn't a bourbon. It's a Tennessee sipping whiskey. I suggest either Jim Beam or Maker's Mark. Both are fine choices.

My family -- and especially the children, loved this.  I have made it with bourbon and tequila for a twist.  After grilling the ribs, I then placed them with the marinade into a disposable pan in the grill on the opposite side as the heat (I have a left and right burner).  I continued to cook/bake them until the sauce was thickened and the ribs were falling apart.  The flavor is easy to adjust with a variety of spices.

We eat Jack Daniels ribs at TGI Fridays so that's what I had in mind when I made these.  I ended up being a little dissapointed.  I was expecting a thicker sauce.  They were OK, but just not what I had expected.  I probably won't make them again.

YUM! Marinated with little less soy sauce and added some black and red pepper. Put all of it in the oven - 350 for an hour. Thickened the sauce with some cornstarch and it was fantastico! I used the country style boneless ribs. OH and FYI Jack Daniels and any other sipping whiskey is bourbon.

This recipe was good but I was hoping the sauce would taste a little more like the Cajun bourbon chicken sauce in the mall fast food places.

This was wonderful!!  I made a double batch and marinated my ribs overnight, and for dinner tonight I used the marinade on chicken breasts.  I marinated them for about an hour, then grilled them on my outdoor gas grill.  I basted them several times with the left over sauce.  They were some of the best grilled chicken breasts I have had!!!

I didn't have bourbon, so I improvised and used Southern Comfort and marinated the ribs overnight.  I reduced the remaining marinade and used it as a glaze to brush on the ribs while they were grilling.  Needless to say they were amazing!  What a great recipe, thank you!

This marinade has a great flavor. I used less soy sauce because I did not have light, and I did not want it to be too salty.

Bourbon, like Jack Daniels, are both  sour mash liquors.  What makes Jack Daniels NOT a bourbon, is the fact that it is produced in TN.  Only sour mash liquors made in KY can be classified as bourbons. 
I have yet to try this recipe, and surely will.  I just noticed a lot of confusion regarding bourbon.  It's all about where it comes from, not what it is made of, or how it is aged.

Just to kick things up a bit I threw in a heaping teaspoon of crushed red pepper. 
While the ribs were on the grill I reduced the marinade on the stove.

I went according to the recipe except for I used 4 lbs. of ribs and was I also poured some of the marinadeover the ribs before baking at 350 for 1 hour and these ribs came out perfect. The extra marinade was plenty for sauce over my side items. Thank you for the recipe, will definently make again.

I followed another reviewers suggestion and made the ribs in the oven rather than on the grill. They were very tasty, but they basically just boiled in the sauce. There was no consistency to the mixture like you would expect with a BBQ sauce, just liquid. As I said, the flavor was good, but if I try the recipe again, I will do it on the grill and see how it turns out that way.

I baked my pork ribs then browned them on the BBQ. I used the cooked marinate, added some cornstarch to thicken, and used it as a thick glaze while on the BBQ. The family practically licked the platter clean!

Easy recipe and I used a very good bourbon, but I just don’t think it tasted very good. I cooked them in the oven so grilling might improve the flavor.

I made this and loved it. I did use Noah's Mill Bourbon, it's a good Bourbon but maybe a cheaper one next time. JD is not a bourbon but it would be ok. Don't forget to oil your grill it will be easier to clean.

Super delicious. And quite humorous reading the reviews from people arguing about whether or not Jack Daniel's is bourbon.

Made this exactly as listed. Easy, and very tasty! A nice switch-up from the usual "ribs with barbecue sauce". One warning: if you don't care for bourbon, you're not going to like this one. Fortunately for us, that's not a problem in our house, ;-)

Meat was sweet and perfectly edible, but not a lot more than that. I felt I could have put the bourbon to better use.

A simple and tasty marinade for most any meat! We enjoyed it with boneless ribs, which I baked in a 350 oven for about an hour.
Very good result, though next time I would love to try them grilled, with some extra sauce almost burnt on at the end.

Okay, as a marinade, this recipe was perfect, however, as afficiionados of the low and slow method of cooking, we made a change... After soaking in the bourbon mix for a couple of hours, we put the ribs on indirect heat for an hour at lower temps. We then wrapped them in foil and added some of the leftover marinade to the foil to let them steep for a while, (another 45 minutes or so). Final step, pour over the last remnants of the marinade on the ribs, put on direct heat for a few minutes per side to add sizzle. They will fall off the bone and melt in your mouth...

Very good with a tender rib result. Only had 1/4 cup of soy sauce on hand, so mixed in 3/4 cup of worchestershire sauce for the difference. You can still taste the bourbon a bit and a mildly sweet overall flavor. We marinated for 4 1/2 hours and grilled on a charcoal grill for 20 minutes on each side.

Really good recipe!! Added some maple syrup and liquid smoke to it, turned out great! Crock pot on low for about 8 hrs.
