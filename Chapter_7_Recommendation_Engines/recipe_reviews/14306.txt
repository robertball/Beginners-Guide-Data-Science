I make this all the time, but I thought I would share my modifications. I'm told I make the best! Lol!  First finely chop your broccoli. I think that is what makes people love my salad. Instead of or in addition to grapes, you can use raisins, or for the holidays dried cranberries! I use red onions (more color) and green onions.  I put the crumbled bacon in a side dish to garnish.  I use the sugar and mayo (use low fat - very delicious) in the same ratio, but add 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar. Everyone wants this recipe and you will get compliment after compliment for it, plus it is very healthy.

I liked this recipe a lot.  The dressing was a little sweet, but good overall.

The dressing is very good with lime instead of vinegar, and I used jerked chicken instead of bacon.  It's becoming a favorite!

Very good recipe. I do not like salads too sweet hence I reduced the quantity of sugar. As I am a vegetarian, I used soy bacon. Thanks for the recipe.

I changed it up a bit.  I had eaten a similar one at a party and changed acording to that recipe.  I used regular bacon, red onion and almonds instead of sunflowers.  My husband begs me to make it weekly and everyone wants the recipe.  It is a keeper!

This is almost identical to a very popular broccoli salad I use to make for a restaurant I worked at. I was craving it and found this recipe, which is super close! I like to use apple cider vinegar and omit the bacon as it gets mushy and chewy.

Delicious!!  Like everyone, I made a few changes. Only 1/2 C sunflower seeds, about 2 T. Real Bacon bits, and Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine.  Will definitely save this one.

I thought this was wonderful! Very fast and easy, and it tasted out of this world. I tried a salad very similar to this, and lucked out finding this recipe. YUMMY!

Very good! Doesn't seem like enough sauce, but is. Decrease onion!! Used slivered almonds instead of seeds...fine, seeds just would've tasted better I think.
