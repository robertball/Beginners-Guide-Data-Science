Pretty tasty but I have to say I did not use 1/4 Cup olive oil.  Even though it is a good for you fat, it still packs a punch in calories.

This is a very fresh tasting sauce and the meatballs are good. Before adding the meatballs, crush any whole tomatoes that have not broken down.

I made the recipe as instructed except used one and a half teaspoon salt and one half teaspoon sugar. I used 90% lean beef for the meatballs and doubled the meatballs recipe. When I tried to roll the meatballs, though; I was unable to obtain the right texture. Even though I used half the meatballs in the sauce,  the meatballs took much longer than 30 minutes to cook through. Next time I will make a few changes: less olive oil, ground meat that is not so lean, italian seasoning for meatballs, and oregano for the sauce, and continue to use less sugar. The extra serving of meatballs I baked and saved for appetizers and sandwiches.

This recipe is terrible. The meat balls don't hold together in the sauce. After an hour and a half of cooking there is not any sauce left . I needed a lot of modification to make it possible

The only thing I did different with this recipe is I didn't have plain breadcrumbs so I used Italian breadcrumbs.  I have tried & failed several times in the past to make meatballs that pass the muster of my picky husband & son.  This recipe is a hit & makes me happy that I can finally make meatballs that the whole family enjoys.  Thanks!!

Made this for my roommates and had rave reviews! The only thing I did differently was to add about 1/2 as much tomato paste as I prefer a thinner sauce.

This is very close to my favorite sauce recipe except I use no-salt tomatoes and paste and add garlic and onion powder and Italian seasoning to taste-absolutely yummy!

I only used the spaghetti sauce part of the recipe and it was easy and delicious.
