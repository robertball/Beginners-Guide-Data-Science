Excellent dish on a cold Fall day.  I made only a few changes.  I seasoned the pheasant with lemon pepper instead of just plain pepper.  I also used 2 cups of beef broth and no water.  
The pheasant was very tender and moist.  Hubby loved it too!  Served with mashed potatoes.

Overall very good!!!  Next time I make this dish I will increase the lemon juice to 1/2 cup.  I used chicken broth instead of beef as that is what I had on hand.  I will also use a little more garlic and pepper as well...but my husband and I loved it.  Very tender with no gamey flavor...and it did NOT taste like chicken...much better!

Great and simple way to serve pheasant. Tastes good - no gamey flavor. Used about 1/3 cup of lemon juice (2 small lemons), 3 large cloves of garlic, and 1 1/2 cups of organic beef broth out of the box. Most of the liquid had evaporated after about 1 hour. Could maybe use more liquid next time.

I am not a huge fan of pheasant but this is really good.  Definately the best pheasant recipe I have come across.  Meat was tender, not gamely, and had a nice lemon garlic flavor.

I made this recipe the other night for my husband and I - he had gotten two pheasants that morning and it was wonderful! No gamey flavor at all - I used an entire fresh lemon and paired it with baby red garlic mashed potatoes. Great recipe - perfect for people just beginning with game recipes too.

This was magnificent. I prepared the full recipe of the liquid (using 1/2 cup lemon juice) but for 1 pheasant. I also added about 1 tsp rosemary and used 2 garlic cloves. The sauce made great gravy once cooked down and thickened with a little corn starch.

Turned out great I used Lemon Pepper and Chicken Broth.  Also Toward the end of the hour cooking I turned the heat up and let the juice cook off and thicken once all the juice was gone and the meat browned more I turned the heat off and served

i was really scared to eat this since i had never had pheasant before. someone gave the bird to my husband, so i made him cook it!...anyway, it was pretty good. we used white wine and a little of the beef broth. we also added some diced bacon to the pan as the meat was simmering. the flavor came out very nice! i cant say that i will ever ask for pheasant again, but it didnt kill me like i thought it would : )

WONDERFUL!!!  I seasoned the pheasant with salt & lemon pepper and added just a bit more lemon juice.  I also simmered "uncovered" for last 30 minutes to allow juices to thicken into a sauce.  Served over egg noodles.  A great recipe & the boys told me I have to make this one again.

Wow, this recipe really tastes great.  I can't rave enough about it!  I did as other people advised and added 1/2 cup lemon juice to the batch and it came out splendid.  There was no game taste or leftovers!  A definite repeat in our household with pheasant or chicken.

Very, very good!  When my husband cleans pheasants, he does not leave them whole, so I had boneless pieces of pheasant. I don't think it really made a difference, other than it was a shorter cooking time.  I followed the recipe as is, except I used chicken broth as that is what I had and sort of thought it would go better with the pheasant.  This did not disappoint!!  I cooked this in my cast-iron skillet and every last morsel was devoured.  I'm always looking for new ways to try pheasant and this was certainly well worth the try; easy and delicious!!  Thank you!

Pheasant is a very gamey meat, and this recipe definitely helped counter that.  Very tender.

I made this recipe with either chukar, grouse or pheasant, I'm not sure which.  I made one significant change.  Instead of using beef broth I used some left over white wine.  It was delicious!  My children said it was the best recipe yet for the birds Dad brings home.

Was in a last minute search for a new pheasant recipe. I was unfamiliar as to how to cook pheasant other than in the slower cooker. I had onions and mushrooms on hand so I sauteed those first in the butter. Then I added the garlic which I minced and crushed with fresh sage and lemon zest.  Only had chicken stock on hand and it worked perfectly as a replacement. This was a FANTASTIC pheasant recipe. Absolutely delicious and great Fall weather comfort food. Can't wait to make it the next time exactly as the recipe calls. Although the more lemon juice, the better if you love lemon. Thanks so much bmatheson!

excellent recipe!  it's really nice to have an alternative way with pheasant.  I took everyone's advice & added extra lemon juice, and I also included extra garlic (my usual).  can't wait to try this with chicken, as suggested by another commenter.

Very simple and easy to follow!  Pheasant came out tender and did not have that 'gamey' flavor.

Next time, I would skip the flour, add 1/3 - 1/2 cup of lemon juice, and add straight broth (no water) and then it would be 5 stars .... otherwise great recipe!!!

Absolutely wonderful!  This was my first time cooking with pheasant, and I used 6 pheasant breasts instead of 2 whole.  Increased the lemon juice to half cup, and used all beef broth instead of water.  This recipe is definately a keeper!

This was delicious with grouse instead of pheasant. Very tender and easy with a lot of flavor!  I used the recipe as is except for using lemon pepper in the seasoning as well.

Yes very nice. This person has got it right on how to cook Pheasant. I used more lemon and a touch of Merlot. Overall it's a very nice dish. I did use a Pheasant from the freezer and didn't take a photo. I have posted a few comments about Pheasant. However I did actually do it this way. It's good. It was browned as well and so didn't look anemic. Shallots would work too. Whole ones that would have fallen apart, just an idea.After completing the flavour left can be used for a sauce. By adding more Merlot, then reduce. I poured it away then thought I shouldn't have. Thicken with gravy granules and a teaspoon of redcurrant jelly. I will next time.

I made this for a wild game dinner and it was a hit.  My friends asked to take the leftovers home.  Next time they came back they asked if I had any more.   I did use chicken broth instead of beef and white wine instead of water.  It came out perfect in the slow cooker.

This was the 1st time I had pheasant and this was AWESOME! The lemon was a perfect touch. The only thing I did different was I used lemon pepper seasoning before dredging in flour.

Due to allergy restrictions I made some pretty big ingredient swaps, ie-no flour, butter or garlic, but I did use oil and rice flour.  My whole family loved the pheasant, it was flavorful and so tender.  It was delicious and I will certainly make it again!

I made this for my husband (I don't do pheasant) and he said it would get 4 stars because "It was good."

FANTASTIC!!!  My husband & I enjoyed it so much last night that I made it again tonight with chicken!!!  I love lemons, so, I too, used a 1/2 cup lemon juice (actually, I used all the juice in one of those plastic lemons (you know the ones), which has a little bit more than a 1/2 cup.  DELICIOUS over rice!!!  I also love that it's so easy to prepare & I'm not stuck washing a million pots & pans after dinner.  Will absolutely make again...maybe tomorrow...HA_HA!!!
