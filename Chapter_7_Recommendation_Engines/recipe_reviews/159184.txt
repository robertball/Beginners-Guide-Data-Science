I really liked this one. I only made a few changes. First, I traded the cumin for Oregano. Oregano goes well with Feta so that was a no-brainer. Second, I added Bacon. but only one strip more for flavor than anything else. third I left out the green chilies. the last thing i did was sub the frozen spinach for fresh.

The cumin is very overpowering.  I reduced the paprika from 1 TBSP to 1 tsp but even then the flavor seemed off.  While I liked the fact that it was crustless and had a good texture, nobody in my family said they'd eat it again.

Great recipe for south beach.  Adjustments I made,  I used an rectangular glass pan, lined the bottom with 1 layer of sliced swiss cheese from the deli for crust.  I made it with 1 1/2 cups chopped asparagus that i microwaved for 2 min.  I ommited tomatoe, spinach,  green chilies, and used 2 tsp of  Penzys paris spice in place of cumin.  I sauted the onions before adding and left out garlic powder, and paprica.  We ate for breakfast and late night snack!

I thought I had feta cheese in the fridge, but I didn't, so I left it out and just added some more cheddar & parmesan. I also threw in about 5 sliced mushrooms that were hanging out in the fridge, waiting to be used up. This made for a nice, light lunch - served with a side salad and a piece of focaccia bread.

Way salty.  I would try it again with much less feta and swiss instead of cheddar.  It was overpoweringly cheesy, something I never thought I would say as a cheese lover, I think switching the cheeses as I plan to on the next try would solve that.  Very easy to make though, and will try again with some tweaks

Delicious!  I made the recipe basically as written except I swapped out the cumin for oregano as someone else recommended. I went easy on the cayenne.  I had some mushrooms in the fridge, so I threw some of those in.  And I added an additional egg because I was cooking it in a 9x11 rectangular dish. Delicious!!!! The feta and chopped green chiles amp up the flavor and keep it from tasting too "rich", if that makes sense.  And there are so much veggies in it, it doesn't taste "eggy" at all.  Love it!

My family loves this quiche!
I double the ingredients and add half a lb of turkey bacon, fried and chopped.
Put it in a 9x13 pan for 1 1/2- 2 hours . it's a main dish. easy, yummy. 
I don't like cumin, so didn't use it.
salt pepper and some cayenne pepper.

Pretty good! I had to work with what I had on hand, which means no cayenne, no cumin, and I used Mexican cheese blend instead of Parmesan and feta. The result was tasty, but pretty heavy on the sour cream. I think I'll try it next time with a crust-it needed a crunch. My 8 month old LOVED it, my two year old, not so much

Too hot for my palette and to serve to guests without knowing if *hot* is of their liking. Will halve the cayenne next time. 
Also, used shredded zucchini instead of spinach and was yummy.
