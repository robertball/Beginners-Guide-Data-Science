Very nice and simple recipe. The skin was crispy and the lemon complimented the seasoning well. The recipe doesn't say, but I baked skin side up, uncovered.

I have been making this for years.  This is a family favorite.  I also add potatoes cut into wedges with the chicken to cook.  Make a nice salad to complete the meal.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Juicy and Flavorful are the first 2 words I can use to describe this dish! You may think from looking at the ingredients like I did that 1 lemon per chicken is too much, but please do yourself a favor and just try the recipe all the way through you just can't be disappointed. Only thing is i used sea salt because chicken can be bland and a little of cayenne pepper for some added spiciness! And every 30 minutes I opened the oven and based the chicken with the juices that was at the bottom of my glass dish to keep the chicken moist and flavorful.

I have made a similar dish for years but thought I'd try this one. I used a total of 15 drumsticks and approximately 10 thighs (I have a big eating family and we LOVE leftovers)! I just rubbed a little olive oil over each piece of chicken then seasoned with kosher salt and some black pepper.  Mixed approx.. 1/3 cup each of basil and oregano, a bit of garlic powder since I added approx.. 10 cloves of fresh garlic over chicken before baking. Added just a bit of salt and pepper to the spice mix and a bit of adobe over chicken pieces.  Cut approx.. 5 lemons in quarters, squeezed over chicken in my roasting pan which was coated with a pad of melted butter and threw the remainder of the lemons in the pan.  Placed roasting pan in oven at 350 degrees for approx.. 1 hr. And then added about 8 potatoes cut in wedges which were dredged in remainder of spice mix and lemon. Since I had so much chicken and potatoes, I baked for approximately 1 more hour basting occasionally and re-positioning chicken/potatoes so everything got browned and crispy.  Served with steamed brussel sprouts and my entire family from 10-55 years LOVED IT!  Most of them had 3 helpings!  Thanks so much for the recipe it was FABULOUS!  Next time I will add some Portobello mushrooms. Bon Appétit

I have never left a rating for any recipe before but after making this recipe every week for a couple months I felt I should share my experience. You see, I have six children ages 6-16 and after all my years of cooking for them, this is literally the only recipe that EVERY one of them love and ask for often. I usually have to make two different chicken recipes simultaneously to please both camps of tastes but this one is perfect and quick! don't change anything in the recipe other than using refrigerated lemon juice instead of fresh lemons, oh, and quadrupling the recipe!

I made this with only chicken legs and omitted the olive oil (the cooking time was only about 45 minutes).  It made the most delicious sauce that I spooned over pilaf. My young boys ate 4 pieces each.  Delicious, SO easy and healthy.

Made this last night and I loved it. The chicken came out so moist and I loved the taste of the skin with all the spices. (It wasn't spicy, just a nice blend with nice flavor.) I didn't have real lemons (my husband don't like lemon) so I wasn't able to bake it with the lemons but I did put lemon juice on it before I put the spices on. Next time I think I will add a tad bit more garlic and maybe try onion as well. To me this craves to be made and served with mash potatoes and veggie of your choice. (Unfortunately my husband wasn't feeling well and he couldn't taste anything but he did comment on how moist they were.) It was a huge hit with me!

This flavor combination is worth 10 stars!  Use the seasoning and lemon to taste and this will be one of your favorite ways to cook chicken.  For 12 chicken legs, I lightly coat with olive oil and use half the amount of seasoning and lemon called for, which makes it perfect for us.  When I have no lemons, bottled lemon juice works well. I tried it with potatoes, but much prefer to cook the potatoes and chicken separately in shallow baking pans and baste the potatoes with some of the drippings each time I baste the chicken. One time I  had to leave these in the oven for an extra hour after they had reached temp, so I turned the oven to 180 and let them sit and they were so good, I do it this way whenever I have the time.

I loved this recipe! Very simple and easy. I only had 6 legs so I only used 2 lemons, 3 teaspoons of everything that called for 4 teaspoons except the salt because I only had garlic salt instead of garlic powder, so I only add 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and about 1/2 teaspoon cajun pepper....I baked them for about an hour in a half uncovered flipping them and basting every 20 minutes! They were very juicy and fall off the bone amazing! Will definitely do this one again.

This is the first Greek dish I've ever eaten, and it just may be the most delicious chicken I've ever had in my life! I didn't have lemons so subbed 2T lemon juice for each lemon. I had five leg quarters so upped all ingredients to 5. I cut back the salt and pepper by 1 tsp each. There was way too much of the spice mixture even after heavily coating both sides of the chicken. With all that lemon juice, there were a LOT of drippings, which prevented the skin from getting crispy. But we don't eat the skin anyway, so it wasn't a problem. I scraped the spices off the skin, then dipped the chicken in them. I served it with the Greek green beans from this site (also Ahhh-mazing!) and used 1 tsp of the leftover spices from this recipe in that dish. There's still 2-3 tsp left. Will DEFINATELY make again. It was a bit salty, but not unpleasantly so. I will cut back on the salt a bit more next time.

This is very good and easy to make.  Enjoyed it very much.  Did as reviews suggested and used less of the spices altogether.  Love the taste of this chicken, I used quarters.

We have had this twice now.  Delicious!  I tried it with skin on and skin off.  I prefer skin on baked skin side up so that the skin can be removed if that is your preference after cooking.  I also used an italian herb mix instead of having to go and buy all those herbs separately ( I don't have a large spice collection). Also, one lemon is sufficient. The meat turned out a bit more tender and juicy when cooked with skin on.  My kids love this chicken.  Never any leftovers.

Seriously delicious chicken that the entire family loved, and that's saying something!  Sprinkled some lemon zest on top to give it a final kick of flavour.  Served with roasted potato wedges and steamed broccoli.  A perfect Sunday dinner.

Good recipe for chicken legs.  Baked 6 legs and they were done in 45 minutes.  Good sauce for rice.

This was very easy to make. I didn't change anything in the recipe (because thou shalt not review a recipe when you've changed it!), but I did end up having to put it under the broiler at the end to brown it up. Then I let it go a minute too long and poof, blackened herbs and spices. Oh well, we ate it anyway--with some baked red potato wedges which were also basted with the juices from the chicken--and it was pretty good. I think next time I might add a little red wine vinegar for a little extra bite and more Greek-y flavor. I will probably also use my fail-safe, go-to method of cooking moist juicy chicken with a nice brown top--put in at 500 uncovered for 10-15 minutes or whenever it is browned to your liking, then cover with foil, reduce to 325 and cook for 1-2 more hours.

I used chicken legs instead because that's what I had on hand. The seasoning makes the house smell great and the lemon adds an extra  flavor to the chicken. i boiled red potatoes for about ten minutes then added them to the pan of chicken and sprinkled with the seasoning, amazing side dish addition to this plate! Will be making this again!

I used chicken legs with the thigh attached and since I didn't have lemons, I used lemon juice. After I finished cooking the chicken, I placed steamed potatoes in the pan. They soaked up some of that delicious lemony goodness and really tied the dish together. The recipe was easy and incredibly tasty.

Yum. I made 3 quarters and adjusted all the seasons. I only used one lemon (only had one) and thought it was plenty of lemon flavor at the end. I thought it was a bit too much black pepper but overall it was great. Lots of seasoning, I could probably fully coat 4 quarters when doing 1 tbsp of all the ingredients. I would make this again

Kids and adults at my house all loved this flavorful and juicy recipe! Wait, I'm back to say that 4 tsp. salt can't be correct for 4 servings! I think I used about 1 tsp. salt. I have to remove a point, but this is otherwise a great recipe.

It was a little bit salty, so I would cut down on the salt. Also, when I pulled it out of the over after an hour and 15 minutes it was cooked through but the skin wasn't crispy, so I tossed it under the broiler for 10 minutes which really helped it get nice and crispy. Would definitely recommend- it was a hit!

Delicious! I added Potatoes to the pan and used a little more olive oil then the amount stated on the recipe. I also sprinkled some of the herb mix and squeezed just a little lemon on the potatoes too. It came out so good! Will definitely make it again!

I am not a fan of chicken, but this recipe was awesome  and liked by almost everyone in my family!  I followed the recipe exactly  but used chicken legs instead of thighs  because that is what I had on hand. Next time I will take the skin off first... One less thing to do while eating and enjoying it!

I love the way the skin comes out nice and crisp.  Mine was a little too lemony, but my lemons were very large.  I will use less lemon.  My family loved this.

First dish I made from this website and it did not disappoint. Family loved it, even my brother who has an opinion on everything had only good things to say about it. I was worried about the seasoning at first thinking it might be a little much but it was great as is. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe and will be making it again!

Good flavor - only had 5 legs so I used 2 boneless/skinless chicken as well - those dried out too much .... Next time I'll use leg quarters

This is a super easy and delicious recipe. It took less time to prep the chicken than preheat the oven. I've made it twice now and everyone loves it..even the picky one! I didn't need to add or delete anything.

Great recipe!  I substituted 2 cloves of garlic for the garlic powder and a little sea salt instead of regular salt.  I also basted the chicken a few times during cooking with the pan drippings. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  This recipe is so easy and uses ingredients I already keep in the pantry.  My new go-to easy chicken recipe!  The chicken was moist and flavorful -- and a big hit with the kids.

I altered the recipe a lititle due to only having 12 legs - I also added 2 large sized zucchini cut in 4 inch chunks.  I did the chicken first then used the left over oil for my zucchini.   Last alteration used 1 lemon and 2 tsp garlic.

Fantastic and simple chicken recipe!  I had cucumber yogurt but I had no basil. So I improvised by using thyme.  Also, reduced salt to 2 tsp.  Turned chicken once to baste it. Chicken came out delicious, skin was so crispy and tasty too. It was so good, my husband asked to add it to the 'make it' list for dinner.  Complimented chicken and yogurt with burnt butter rice.

I liked the seasoning on this, but I cut the salt and pepper back. I only had 1 lb of chicken breasts, so I didnt make the full recipe. I found the chicken sort of dry. I am going to re-try it with bone in skin on chicken and edit my review.

Good recipe.  Just added one thing that will take it over the top!  About 10-15 before taking out of oven, I added crumbled feta cheese,  Definitely something to consider when you make this dish again.

Great chicken recipe!   I have made this for years and was taught by my Italian grandmother.  No olives, no mint, no fennel, no thyme?   Greek and Italian foods have similar flavor palettes.  To differentiate, I would add green olives, capers, rosemary, fennel, fresh garlic.  Perfect recipe!

Wow, what a flavor burst on the taste pallets. I've used only 1.5 tea spoons of black pepper & I'm getting a lot for my taste, so maybe reducing the pepper to only 1 teaspoon will make it more tasty!
I've also added some vegetables to it; carrots, onions & potatoes and they cooked well & taste awesome.
Overall, I'll add it to my favs.

Loved this take on roasted chicken legs! I did cut the seasoning mix in half, which still left plenty to generously coat. Roasted for an hour and they were juicy and flavorful. Served over brown rice, with sliced cherry tomatoes on the side as an accent.

Guess we were the exception - dish was a bit to lemony for our taste and had too many herbs. Chicken was moist but overpowered by flavors. If I made again I would cut lemons back  to one and cut spices in half. Might also cook on rack.

Made it for the first time as close to this as I could, just to test out the recipe. Turned out amazing! May have been a little undercooked, but turned out extremely tender inside and tasty outside. Served with some jasmine rice cooked in water, butter, and apple cider vinegar. 

My rating: 10/10. Would definitely make this again - honestly seems like a great food to have at a gathering if you make a lot of them.

Next time I also may try a couple new herbs and potentially use something other than chicken legs.

Quick and simple , great for a weeknight dinner when you don't have a lot of time for the kitchen.  The only changes I made were 1) real garlic versus garlic powder, 2) I used boneless chicken breasts because that was what I had.  I cut the temp down to 325 and the cooking time.  

I didn't need a knife to cut the breasts.

I made the recipe with chicken legs only, and I added two potatoes cut into small wedges.  I covered the potatoes with the same seasonings, lemon, and olive oil.  My family loved it.

My husband and I have been making our own individual versions of this for years. For the sake of trying something new, I tried this recipe exactly as written. We found it delicious and flavorful, as well as quick to prepare. My husband commented on how good it was, twice - once when I originally prepared it, and again when we had leftovers. Wish I had taken a photo, but I will on the next occasion I make this dish. Great recipe as is, and as a base for  variations!

Excellent chicken recipe!  The only other ingredient I added was a sprinkling of paprika.  Cooked covered in aluminum foil for the first hour then uncovered for the remaining 30 minutes.  Fall off the bone moist!  My picky eaters LOVED this!

This  had the potential to be 5 stars but was way too salty. Next time I will cut back the salt to 1 tsp. There was also a lot more pepper than our family liked. I had cut that back to 2 tsp already so I'll try 1 tsp next time as well.

I don't know what i did wrong but really didn't care for this recipe . Skin does not get crispy and flavor was ok. I will admit chicken was moist but maybe I just dont like legs anymore 
I have moved onto breast of the chicken  guess over the years.  Just wasn't very appetizing.

Delicious!  I brushed EVOO on both side of the chicken legs, sprinkled bottled lemon juice on both sides and then did the same with the spices, sprinking each spice individually instead of mixing them up in a bowl.  Baked uncovered.

Followed the recipe exactly as written which I always do first time out. Turned out pretty good. Definitely can cut back on the spice mixture as I had a lot left over after liberally coating 4 large legs. Will probably make it again.

This was delicious, and I would definitely make it again.  It was tender and very flavorful.  Great with lemon potatoes and a cucumber, tomato, and feta salad.   The only change... it was ready in about 45 - 50 minutes at 350 degrees.

Delicious and so easy! I mix on the seasonings first in a bowl then add as needed. Depending on how much chicken you have, it may be too much so this way helps.

I did this exactly as written except for adding cubed potatoes. Nice and juicy chicken but we found it was a bit heavy on the amount of salt and pepper called for. Going to cut that amount to half next time I make this.

It doesn't get any easier than this! I I didn't have any lemon, but I did everything else the same. Delicious! Next time I'll throw some carrots and potatoes in there for a complete one-pan meal, because I will definitely be making this again.

I had 8 chicken legs that I needed to cook and found this recipe to try.  I will say that they did come out very juicy and flavorful.  I stuck to the recipe except for 1 exception.  I only used 1 1/2 lemons, due to them being larger and lemon not being one of my favorite taste.  I too also basted the chicken  every 20 mins but even though I cooked 1 1/2 hrs I still didn't get crispy skin so I had to broil for a few minutes after cooking.  By the way, I had this with some homemade mashed potatoes and the gravy in the dish was very tasty over them. Yum

We liked the flavors in this dish a lot.  I only had a whole chicken so I used that.  In addition to the lemon juice, I also added the  zest 2 of them to my FRESH herbs from my garden.  I also added some fresh herbs and 2 lemon halves (juiced) into the cavity of the chicken. I put the chicken in a roasting pan with a v roasting rack inside.  The result was a very crispy skinned chicken!  Very moist!  Will make again!

My family and I loved this recipe. I made it how it is written with the exception of adding a couple of splashes of red wine vinegar to the chicken (and to the potatoes I seasoned I cut and seasoned similar to the chicken). The chicken legs were some of the most moist chicken legs I've ever had. Will definitely be making again.

This was really nice. I made it with a greek pasta salad and was happy with the pairing. My only complaint is that there was a little too much lemon and a not quite enough salt. I would cut back to 3 lemons. Instead of rubbing down the chicken and then applying the "marinade" I put it all in a large mixing bowl and stirred to coat well.

My family loved this, although I used balsamic vinegar instead of lemon and made it with 8 chicken quarters. It came out great!
