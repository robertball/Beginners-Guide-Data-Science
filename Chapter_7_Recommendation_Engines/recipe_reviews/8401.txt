I have made this recipe twice already, and everyone absolutely loves it!!  I like it for the fact that there is not one bit of citron/candied fruit in it. Everything is "natural", and the added applesauce gives the cake an excellent moist texture and taste to it. I'm not a big "cloves" or "allspice" person, so I added a "pinch" more of cinnamon, and it still came out great. I also can't eat walnuts, but added more dates, raisins and cherries to the mix, and you couldn't even notice the nuts weren't in the cake.   I plan on making this cake for Christmas, and the best part is that whatever is left (which there usually isn't any) I can wrap in plastic wrap and freeze!  
This recipe is definitely something worth trying!!  I love it!!

I always made the fruitcake with the mincemeat and sweetened condensed milk; but this year I decided to try this, because I had a lot of applesauce leftover from something else. It is wonderfully moist with the right balance of spices. This is my new tradition!

Delicious! Moist and spicy. I didn't use cherries or nuts, and I think I like it that way. Yum, yum!

I made this exactly as written - I made this for a Fundraising Bake sale - I cut in to 6 BIG wedges and it sold fast ! It also freezes nicely and will serve 20-24 people.

Very simple recipe.  The applesauce makes it moist.  I added dried cranberries too.
