Fabulous recipe.  The second time I used fresh herbs (rosemary, basil, and oregano) and sprinkled the top with a bit of chopped rosemary near the end.  Disappeared in a flash.

I have tried to make home made bread in the past and every time it came out terrible.  This is a very easy recipe and the bread came out perfect!  I listened to other reviewers and increased the amount of spices and I added parsley and onion powder; it tastes great.

rather tasty, and quite simple. i would add 1/8-1/4 teaspoon of additional spices to the melted butter and brush over the cooked bread, well, maybe some finely grated parmesean also.

Tasty, chewy, satisfying bread.  Perfect companion to soup.  The herb flavor was mild but not too mild.  I made the recipe as it was written, using my Kitchenaid stand mixer.  The dry ingredients went in the mixing bowl and I stirred the wet ingredients in by hand.  After that I used the dough hook on "2" and the pouring shield to add the remaining flour until the dough no was a solid ball and did not stick to the sides or bottom.  I ended up using nearly all 4 1/2 cups of flour.   After baking and brushing with butter as directed I sprinkled with crushed sea salt - yum! It was a beautiful bread and was fairly easy to make.  I'll definitely make it again!

This was yummy!  I made one loaf, and forgot to cover it with aluminum foil.  Since I was making it for a bridal tea, and it was a little too brown, my husband and I ate it...all of it.  So good.  The second one was even better.  Everyone loved it.

I've made this recipe many times and it's delicious.  My family always request that I make this bread for every Thanksgiving dinner because it goes so well with it, or any dinner for that matter.  Smother the bread with butter when freshly out of the oven and it's marvelous!

This is great bread.  I used it for a final project at baking school and everyone loved it! I got an A.  It is the best served warm right after it is baked.  It is still very good the next day or so. Check out the yeast you buy in the grocery store.  Mine only sold the rapid rise.  So it proofed quickly 20 mins.  If you read the back of the yeast package it tells you the conversions.  This recipe calls for instant yeast but it won't rise in the amount of time specified...only with the rapid rise kind. You can use your oven as a "proof box" instead if your home is cool or drafty.  Turn your oven on to 200 degrees and set a pan of hot water at the bottom rack.  Take the rack you plan on putting your bread on out of the oven.  When it reaches 200 turn it off. Put the rack back in and the bread.  You are looking for the bread to double in size!  That's the key.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

SHORTCUT!! Use your bread machine set on manual. I have a little trouble with my hands, the machine does all the kneading, I get the credit :-)

This is the only kneaded bread I have ever made and it turned out great!  I made it for a dinner party and then again for Thanksgiving.  I used fresh rosemary instead of dried.

I have never made bread by hand before trying this recipe and it worked beautifully.  The braid is not terribly difficult and makes the loaf look like something out of a cooking book.  Definitely a crowd-pleaser.

Excellent bread Theresa! I skipped the thyme and used some dry seasonings that came with my bread dipping kit. Tying the knot in the middle made it look different than a Challah bread. So pretty! Family loved it!!!!

We eat a lot of home made bread, and this one has been the best out of them all. It's quick and easy to make as far as breads go, and it was delicious! I will make it again, for sure! What I liked about it is that the herbs are not TOO strong of a taste. It's just right!

This bread was pretty tasty, but I was sort of disappointed because I was expecting something spectacular.  I put in 1 1/2 times the herbs and some parmesan cheese, but the flavor was still pretty mild. Also, I was hoping for a crusty bread, but it ended up being very soft.  It just reminded me of packaged white bread with some herbs in it.  My favorite part of this bread was the appearance.  I'll probably use this braiding technique with a different recipe.

This bread was phenomenal on all levels: great texture, great taste, great appearance. I found the knot impossible so I instead just braided and coiled into a round, which came out looking amazing and had the same effect as intended in the directions. Thanks to the reviewer who mentioned lengthening the rising time for use with regular yeast. I gave each rise 1 hour and that seemed just right. A helpful hint: If you don't have a warm place to let the dough rise, preheat the oven to 170 degrees (or whatever is lowest) and then turn off the oven when it reaches the temp. Next, open the door and allow it to cool off for about 5 minutes, lay a towel on the oven rack and put your dough in the warm oven to rise, leaving the door ajar. Works like a charm!

I LOVE this bread!!!  I've made it on several occasions and it has always been the first thing to go!!!  Everyone loves it!  I have also found that the herbs can be substituted with 1 Tbsp. of McCormick's Herb Chicken Seasoning.  It sounds odd, but it turns out wonderfully!!!

First time I made bread and it was perfect!  I even burn toast [Seriously] and this was simple to make.  I used fresh thyme, dry basil, and Mrs. Dash tomato basil garlic seasoning since I didn't have the right ingredients & it still tastes great.  I also used a tablespoon and 1/2 of parmesan cheese in the dough.  The last few minutes I brushed on some egg yolk/milk wash & sprinkled some extra herbs and cheddar cheese on top for the last few minutes of baking.  I did leave it in the oven for too long though and it is a little browner than planned but it looks & tastes great! Thanks for the recipe!  Even great for beginners   :)

This is by far my favorite bread recipe!  It tastes just like a bread from my favorite italian restaraunt.  It's easy and would go great with just about any dinner.  I would highly recommend this recipe for any level bread baker.

I've made this bread dozens of times for years now and always get asked for the recipe. When right out of the oven, I smother it in butter and add parmesan cheese on top and it never lasts long! Its a favorite in our house! I've also noticed it cooks faster and more thoroughly if you braid it and leave it in a long loaf rather than a round.

This bread is so yummy and it looks beautiful.  I use fresh herbs and it turns out great.  (one T instead of 1 t.)
I have even made this in the dough cycle of my bread machine, adjusting the temperature of the liquids.  At the end of the cycle I proceed with rolling out the ropes.  I've also used 100% white whole wheat flour by adding vital wheat gluten.  And this recipe even works when you cut it all in half.  You get a smaller bread but it is still beautiful. (adjust cooking time).

This bread is super easy and turns out perfect.  I didn't have marjoram and so only used thyme and rosemary.  It was still delicious, but didn't have a overly strong herb taste.

OK, normally I try to be quite modest about my cooking but today, I couldnt help raving about this bread that I made.  First, it was so quick and easy to make.  I didnt bother with tying the bread in the middle and so I just connected the two ends of the braid and it looked sooo impressive.  Second, I ran out of sugar and had to put half honey and it was still excellent.  It smelled amazing and tasted even better.  This is only my second attempt making bread and I'm not sure I can move on to another recipe!!!

Very Yummy!  I used fresh rosemary, thyme and oregano and added the herbs after I divided the dough into three parts, one herb in each part. I used one Tbsp of each. Then I braided the ropes and baked that way.  It took less baking time and was beautiful.  Will definetly do again!

This recipe was amazing!  This was the first time I've ever made bread completely from scratch and it came out beautifully!  The presentation is lovely and my family immediately demanded more, after it was gobbled up in less than an hour!  This has very quickly become a family favorite.  Thanks so much!

All the ages loved this. The kids enjoyed the braiding and shaping. Excellent soft, chewy interior with firm crust. I used fresh, chopped herbs (1 Tb. each), substituting fresh oregano for marjoram (the herbs are related, I think). Substituted about a cup of whole wheat flour. Excellent with the 12 Minute Pasta Toss recipe on this site. Oh--I'd like to vary the herbs in the future, and try half of the yeast. NOTE: This is a FAST recipe, especially for the rising, but if you want to prepare the dough in advance, as I did, you'll have to punch it down several times! (Less yeast=allow more time for rising).

I had a hard time putting a knot in the center so next time I will do like the other reviews.  Another problem I had was my husband - I had the bread in direct sun by the door and it looked beautiful - until he closed the door!!!!  The flavors in this bread remind me of a bread served at a popular NYC restaurant.  I couldn't stop eating it and everyone raved about it - even though it was a little flat.  I can't wait to make it again - minus the husband involved.  Great recipe - a real keeper - thank you!!!

This bread is fantastic and easy. After reading other reviews, I also braided the bread in a ring rather than mess with a knot. I've made the bread 6 times in the past few weeks to serve at holiday parties, to give as gifts, and to eat at home. Try it--you'll love it.

This is an OUTSTANDING herb loaf recipe. Although I used a tad more herbs though. Have made it many times and my friends would beg me to bring a loaf at every dinner party! I have used a bread machine to make it before too and turns out beautifully!

This is the first bread I've ever made. It was easy, and turned out great! Per recommendations here, I doubled the herbs, but that turned out a little too strong. I might do 1.5 times as much next time.

I used my bread machine's dough cycle to save myself some time, still came out great.  I can only give 4 stars though because I was really disappointed with this bread.  It smelled wonderful and was beautiful but it was not delicious.  I do not plan to make again, I believe that this is just my personal taste though; my mother and other dinner guests enjoyed.

this is the best tasting herb bread iv ever made! i had a bit of trouble knotting it after i braided it but it looked ok. i melted the butter and mixed in thyme, rosemary and marjom, then brushed it over the top of the bread. it was so soft and delicious i cant stop eating it!

Bread flour gives this a more doughy texture than all-purpose flour.
LOVE this recipe!  Quick, and you don't need a bread machine.

I can't really say any different than what the other reviewers already have.  It was my first time making bread, outside of a bread machine.  It was easy. It really wasnt very time consuming (the longest part was waiting for it to rise), and it looks beautiful and tastes wonderful.

Great recipe. Came out nice and soft on the inside. Not too dense. Went perfect with pasta. I didn't have all of the necessary spices on hand, so I substituted my own instead. Rosemary, Oregano, and Basil.

this was an amazing, wonderful bread.  I made it for a party and it was beautiful, easy to make, and had a wonderful sweet italian flavor.  I recommend it to all my friends.  The braiding sounded difficult but it was actually very easy

Excellent Excellent recipe.  One of the best breads I have eaten.  Even better than the breads you get in fine italian restaurants.  I added a bit more rosemary and left out the thyme and marjoram.  Instead I threw in half a teaspoon of oregano and basil. I glazed the bread with butter and coated it quite well with sea salt and stuck it in the oven during the last ten minutes.

Excellent!  I doubled the spices and added basil and oregano and left out the thyme.  It was pretty easy and even though it's a challenge to braid and knot the bread it looked as amazing as it tasted.  HUGE hit with my boyfriend.  Definitely a keeper.

Yum!! This is a keeper.  It is quick, moist and down right beautiful and the aroma alone lured them in.  I mixed it up in my Kitchen Aid then kneaded it by hand for 4 min.  I make bread on a regular basis but have never braided it. It looked so professional.  Served it with the Twelve Minute Pasta Toss from this site. It was a beautiful presentation.  Thanks for the recipe Theresa. :-)

Sucks that I have to give this recipe such a low rating, but I followed it exact and it's really doughy and I cooked it for longer then receipe said to try to un-dough the texture. My oven is not off at all so that has nothign to do with it. Another thing, and this is monor as it's strictly are looks is it's impossible to tie a knot with the dough! No matter how firm the dough is it would not tie! I justbraided the darned thing and formed a circle. Won't make again.

For once in my life, I followed a recipe to a "T." This turned out great. I made this for three of my aunts, my mom and dad, my sister, my niece, and my husband (big dinner gathering) and *everyone* loved it.

I made this bread for dinner tonight, I served it with our traditional spaghetti dinner.  Instead of adding salt I added garlic salt and chopped parsley.  My family LOVED it!  They liked better than the regular garlic bread I would serve with spaghetti.  My youngest son showed while it was still baking and he said the house smelled heavenly.  He stayed for dinner and took what little of the bread was left home to eat with his morning scrambled egg breakfast.

We’ve had this one in the family recipe binder for years. To make it bake faster without burning the outside, we’ve divided the dough into 2 separate mini-loaves.

This was my first 'win' with homemade bread. It was so easy and turned out amazing. After reading the reviews, I doubled the herbs and added garlic powder, onion powder, and parsley. All of which I used the same measurements and doubled as well. After it was done, I brushed with butter and sprinkled garlic powder and parsley. Seriously, thank you for this recipe!

A friend made this for our church's breaking of bread and we LOVED it. I could eat an entire loaf just by myself! She said that instead of following the recipe exactly, she used whatever herbs she had around (oregano and basil), and it turned out GREAT. Definitively worth a try.

Great recipe! Made this to go with beef and potato soup and it was delicious. The only change I made to the recipe was to add heaping teaspoons of the herbs. I also made it in the bread maker and it turned out well.

Superb bread! This is my second attempt working with dough, but it's my first bread, and it was excellent!! I followed the recipe exactly, except for the topping (I did double the herbs in the dough): 1/4 stick melted butter, 1 tsp each of the herbs, 2-3T parmesan cheese, 1 1/2 tsp garlic powder - brush with half this mixture during baking and the remainder after removing the loaf to cool. Sprinkle top with a bit of sea salt and voila! Crispy exterior, soft center. Excellent bread!

Sweet, salty, crispy on the outside and fluffy/chewy on the inside. This bread is SO delicious, and I can easily switch the herbs to match whatever I'm feeling like making! I usually use about twice as much rosemary as what the recipe calls for. So good!

Yummy addition to our Turkey Day feast! Very simple recipe that ends up soooo pretty. I used my convection oven at 350 and it was done in about 20 minutes...I didn't tent with foil but did let it rest in the upper oven while everything else finished up in the lower one. Thank you Theresa Malone for sharing your recipe!

I made it for lunch and it was fluffy, moist and perfect with a good pumpkin or carrot soup.

Delicious and easy!  I cooked it for 30 minutes and the very middle was not cooked through, but that is my fault.  The balance of spices here is LOVELY, the bread so soft and thick.  Can't wait to make this again!

This bread is pretty good, but it tastes a little sweet.  I think I will cut down on the sugar if I make it again.  (Note: Only mod this first time was to replace two cups of AP flour with white whole wheat flour.)

I thought this was delicious. I pretty much stayed with what the recipe said... just changed up the herbs a little. Good tasting bread, only thing was that mine was a little doughy in the middle of loaf. Will definetly make again.

So yummy! This was my first attempt at making bread and it was a huge success. This bread was great warm with butter but also good then next day for dipping as it was nice and crumbly. Already passed on the recipe to friends and family.

Very easy to make and so yummy!! I added different herbs to it, a dash of garlic salt, onion powder and general italian seasoning still great. I'm going to try and use bread flour next time and see the difference.

We love this bread!! I've made it round and also just a long braid (easier to cut) It comes out beautiful and yummy either way.  I agree that fresh herbs make the difference.  ENJOY!!

I made this bread yesterday and we were really happy with the end result.  I followed the method exactly, but I did swap out the marjoram for some fresh dill (thought I had some and did not).  The bread is pretty dense and is both sweet and savory at the same time.  I'm looking forward to trying it toasted!!

This bread was delicious! I used 1 T of fresh herbs instead of dry and left out the marjoram.  It's a bit time consuming but not difficult to make.

The dough was impossible to braid, very sticky. So i sortof formed it into a loaf and it went all flat while rising. It still gets 5 stars cause i have never EVER been able to make bread as good as this. My husband is not a bread eater at all, but he kept requesting it. I also doubled the amount of spices with some other italian spices. The texture was just awesome. I also tried it with the chickenspices like some1 suggested. Used a tablespoon (probably depends on which brand you use) insted of the other spices. Will use 1 1/2 next time. Very nice. I think you can make all kinds of bread with this.

Ok i have to say I think I am a pretty good cook but when it comes to baking i have things to learn. New bakers dont be afraid of this one it was a great bread and not as hard as I thought it would have been.  The only thing i could have done is cook it mayve 5 minutes longer, but it was great and it got eaten up in minutes!  The smell of this bread just made the house smell like a bakery!!

This bread was okay, not great. I altered it by using 1 TB each of rosemary, thyme, oregano, and basil. It still seemed kind of bland somehow. It may have been the texture, which was uniformly soft and not very interesting in the mouth, in my opinion. I formed the braid in a circle rather than a knot, and I got comments on what a pretty loaf it was, but nobody had anything else to say about it. We will finish eating it, but I don't think I'll make it again.

Excellent bread! I made it with garden fresh herbs. I also divided it into six "bun" shaped pieces, baked on a pizza stone and used them as  home-made buns! Just a tad on the dry side, but perfect with burger fixin's!

This was fantastic.  It was easy to make, and it was delicious dipped in olive oil with roasted garlic squeezed on the slices.  I used 1/2 TB of each herb, since we like a lot of seasonings.  The day before I made this, my husband was complaining about the time I spend making bread, saying, "Bread just isn't all that wonderful."  After he tasted this, he couldn't stop talking about how great it was.

I usually prefer crustier breads, but this is a nice one when you want something chewy.

This bread was incredible!  I divided it into 2 separate loaves which I braided.  One in the freezer (unbaked) and one cooked right away.
Delicious!
