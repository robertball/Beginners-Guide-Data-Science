Very tasty. I made them exactly as stated in the recipe. Next time I will make some Devonshire cream for them.

I forgot to add the brown sugar, so added it after all other ingredients were already mixed. i liked how it gave a bit of a brown sugar glazed edge is spots, so next time, I will mix in 1/4 cup with the dry ingredients at the right time, but then add and mix in 1/4 cup of brown sugar after the fact.
