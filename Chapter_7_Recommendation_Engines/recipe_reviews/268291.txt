My family LOVED this.  It was quick & easy - but really good.  
don't be nervous if, after sauteeing the chicken, pieces stick to the bottom.  They released during the pressure cook and became a wonderful part of the sauce.  We forgot to add the cornstarch before pressure cooking, so added it after and it thickened up just fine.  I added more lemon juice than it called for and a bit of white wine.  We served it over noodles and used fresh bread to mop up the sauce. 
Other enhancements we didn't try but will at some point:  add capers, parsley, and a bit more garlic to make it closer to a picatta.  
This will definitely be on our "make again" list (again and again and again!!).

Prep technique, instructions, and ingredient quantities are perfect for this. I will make it again, such a time saver for me to make a meat & potatoes kind of meal without a lot of time left in the day. We do NOT like the adding of Italian seasoning. It was way too heavy and don't feel it belongs in a chicken dish like this. Hubby was not too impressed so next time I will omit that entirely. He's pretty easy to please so I know it wasn't to his liking when he doesn't go back for seconds and picks at it.. but I didn't care for it either. Leftovers we were hoping for got tossed out this time around. I feel the consistency and ease of making this was wonderful, but it would have been 5-star perfect if I would have omitted the Italian seasoning. Leave that for the tomato based/spaghetti or pizza recipes.

I cooked it exactly as directed but I would have liked a bigger pop of lemon. The garlic was a good level but the lemon was a little too mild for a recipe maned Lemon Garlic chicken.

I’d make it again as was tasty, but it was a bit gluggy. Was actually heaps better the next day! I think the frying steps in the multi cooker would work better in a frying pan as my chicken just ended up broiling in its own juices rather than browning. I know that means more to clean, but I’m willing to give this a go next time.

We had this tonight, and it was delicious.  I was on a time crunch so I used frozen chicken. I also doubled the sauce ingredients. I took all the ingredients you add before turning on the pot and  just dumped them in. I cooked it on high 18 minutes. Then followed the recipe from there. We had rice and asparagus with it. Everyone liked putting the sauce on everything.

Delicious sauce- not too lemony. This is a keeper.
