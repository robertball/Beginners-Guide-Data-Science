yum!! i have a recipe very similar to this and it is FANTASTIC & has been requested by many! in mine, you use 1/4 c "sweet & tangy" honey mustard (good for a dipping sauce too!), and a lot more french-fried onions - i got a big can and used about 2/3 of it - you smash the onion rings up as much as you can so they'll stick better.  i cut my chicken breasts into 3-4 pieces each, just b/c i don't like big thick pieces of chicken.  i baked at 400 for 25 mins.  it is so delicious-looking & tasting!  so crispy!  i also found that getting it dipped/coated then refrigerating it for a 1/2 hour or so makes the coating stick better when finished.  it ties with chicken marsala I (on this site) as the best chicken dish i've ever made!

This was good! I skinned my chicken pieces and seasoned the dijon mustard I used, with cayenne, garlic and onion powders and a little olive oil. I cooked the chicken on a rack to keep the bottom crispier. Quick and easy Juliet!

I left the skin on the chicken and seasoned it with a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder before coating with honey dijon mustard. This recipe was so delicious. My Mom and I really enjoyed it. The crispness of the onion coating was great. Served this with a salad and mashed potatoes. I will be making this one again.

This is one of those recipes that looks too simple to be any good, but it's delicious!  My 2 year old kept asking for more chicken, my mom loved it, and my husband said he'd like to eat this at least every month!  I crumbled the onions so they would stick better and be easier to eat, and I used chicken cutlets so they only needed to bake for about 25 minutes at 375.  I served this with brown rice and green beans.  Great meal!

French-fried onions like to hide in the grocery store.  You can usually find them in the aisle with the canned green beans.

For a cheap and EASY recipe I think it is great. I served with a salad and biscuits and fed my family for $1.50/person. would definately make again since it is just pantry staple items. Can't beat that. I did season the chicken with s&p before dredging and then once on the baking sheet I got a little nervous about the simplicity of it all and sprinkled the chicken with seasoned salt, paprika and garlic powder. It didn't have an overwhelming mustard flavor like I expected-which was nice. My crew was pleasantly surprised by this dish!

Very good!!!  Something different to add to our same old dishes.  I have also tried this recipe with BBQ sauce, rather than mustard and it is very good as well.

This was really good! I put season salt on the chicken breast and then mixed half brown and half honey mustard and sprinkled it with paprika and season salt. I crushed the crispy onions and then sprinkled over top the chicken in the pan. Cooked it on 300 with tin foil to hold in the moisture and then raised the temp a little and took the foil off so the onions would crisp up again. Only had a little problem with the onions that weren't on the chicken burning a bit. This was delicious and easy easy easy!

So I couldn't find the french-fried onions ANYWHERE in the grocery store!! I walked down every aisle about 5 times before I gave up. But I was hell bent on making this, so I substituted the onions with crushed up Special K cereal. It came out really great! I used cutlets instead of breasts. (like others I seasoned the chicken before coating it in the mustard) My boyfriend loved it and couldn't get enough!

I made this using a "mild and creamy " dijon mustard and the flavor was great!  Next time I'll pat the chicken (I used tenderloins) dry before dredging in the mustard to help it stick better.  Also, I think I'll crunch the onions a bit more before coating the chicken in them so they're more of a breading.  I served with rice and brussels sprouts and my husband has requested that I make it again!

This was very good! I mixed 1/2c brown mustard with 1/2 yellow mustard. I also noticed that the onions didn't really stick to the bottom of the breasts. I think next time I'll mix an egg with the mustard to see if it helps.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted fantastic.  I used honey mustard and the regular french fried onions (not cheddar).  Also, I used chicken breast cutlets and baked for 45 min at 375 degrees. I served it with green beans and sweet potatoes and it was a big hit!

REALLY yummy!  Hard to believe something so simple could be so great!~  I mixed Guldens Spicy with Emerils Dijon. I also put them in the oven on a cookie cooling rack over a broiler pan.  Good crunch to it..... Perfect!

Used chicken tenders to cut down on cook time and Cheddar French fried onions.  It tasted like a healthier version of fried chicken.  So good.

This was fantastic. I made two baches. One with a spicy mustard and one with regular mustard and added fresh honey. I also added one egg to the mustard. I also crushed the onion. Very easy dish to make. I will be making this one again.

A very similar method is listed right on the back of the French's french fried onion can (without the mustard).  It has always been a family favorite.  I look forward to trying it with mustard.  Wanted to mention that the recipe on the French's can does call for crushing the onion rings first before coating the chicken.  It helps them to adhere.

Very easy and very good! Even my stepson who "doesn't like chicken" had 2 pieces! Used a mixture of 3 different mustards and sprinkled with garlic salt before baking. Cut large breasts in half and it cut the baking time down by 20 minutes. Definitely a keeper.

I just moved to DC, and I've been looking for cheap recipes.    This has become my go-to recipe for cheap and easy.  I usually use honey mustard, and I serve it with a baked potato.  Well done, Juliet.  Well done!

It's good even though I'm not a big yellow mustard fan.....I prefer to add a spice blend to washed and dried S/B chicken breast then dredge it in EVOO then dredge in panko and bake at 350 for about 50 minutes...comes out AWESOME!!!

So easy and simple. It doesnt usually take 50 min for mine to cook, maybe 35. The only thing I do is switch it up sometimes with dijon mustard. or half and half with regular mustard. Its always delicious regardless. thank you!

I can't believe how simple and yummy this is.  I almost felt guilty.  My family raved about it and it was the easiest thing I'd made all week and my husband can even take it cold for his lunch!

Very tasty...cut my chicken into tenders, used honey Dijon mustard. I did use the tip of putting a cookie rack under the chicken and they were a bit crispier on the bottom...but it was a mess to clean up. I think if I made these again, I'd skip the cookie rack and use a stone cooking pan and just turn half way through cooking. Chicken was very tender.

Fabulous!  My 12 year old daughter made this (with supervision of course) exactly to recipe (almost) and it was delicious.  She used 6 bonesless skinless chicken breasts and added 2 tablespoons of spicy brown mustard to the yellow mustard and baked as directed.  The cooking time was exactly right.  The chicken was tender and juicy and simply amazing.  This will be one of our regular chicken recipes for now on.

Raves from friends and family has prompted me to play with this recipe!  First round, I blended all the leftover mustards in my fridge (we love all kinds of mustard) - mix was mostly Dijons - results were outstanding.  Second round, last minute dinner guests and pitiful supplies had me cutting up each partially frozen chicken breast into 3 nice hunks, then dredging them in a mixture of yellow mustard, little bit of dijon, sweetened up a bit with agave nectar and then rolling them in crunched up FUNYUNS snack rings (7-11 doesn't stock french fried onions!) resulting in a tangy, crunchy chicken....smells wonderful baking.  I was worried but ultimately pleased with the results!  I'm looking forward to playing with all my favorite mustard - we plan to try finely dicing onions with corn flakes next!  This is a great recipe - thank you so much Juliet!!!

While it was easy (few ingredients), I would say that it is just ok.  Make sure that you leave plenty of room between the pieces of chicken or you will have problems "crisping" the coating.  Were I to make it again, I would put them on a cookie sheet, further apart and possibly on a rack so that thte juices would not create a soggy bottom.  Also, I may have made a mistake by using plain, old yellow mustard.  It might be better with dijon or a more hearty mustard.  I did like the idea of using the french-fried onions though.  Next time will try dredging in butter then the onions and bake...I think that would be fabulous as the onion taste is excellent.

I can only rate the mustard and onion topping because I used this on fish instead of chicken. It was delicious on cod. I made up the recipe for just two pieces of cod for my husband and I, so I didn't use nearly the amounts called for in the recipe. My husband, who doesn't really care of mustard, said to make it again. Not gourmet eating, but does everything have to take five hours to fix for a light supper?

Soooo moist and flavorful! There just needs to be a better method for keeping the onions on the chicken.  Next time I'll either try a rack or refrigerating them, as some comments have suggested.

My husband and I both loved this recipe!  I was looking for a new way to make chicken and this recipe is so easy.  Next time I will buy a larger can of onions as I ran out and had to improvise for the last piece of chicken.  I made the leftovers into chicken enchiladas and the mustard coating added a nice zing to the dish.

I used Dijon Mustard but I didn't taste the mustard.  I thought the receipe was easy and very good.  I crushed the FF onions a little and added some Parmesan cheese.  Yummy, quick and easy.

If you like a mustard flavor on your chicken then this is a great idea.  I added a tsp of salt to the mustard along with some roasted garlic vinegar.  I put the french fried onions in a chopper.  It turned out really great.

Loved it!  You can really mix it up with what kind of mustard you use, too.  I've made it with a spicy southwest style mustard, and a sweeter honey mustard, and they were both wonderful, but rather different!  If you have leftovers, the onion flavor gets stronger on reheating, but not unpleasantly so.

I got caught up in the rave reviews instead of trusting my own judgment  It tastes like it sounds - mustard & onions on chicken.  :l  I'm still on a mustard "kick," but I'll pass on this one.

I thought this chicken was very bland and WAY overcooked.  I'm a novice and as such, I followed the directions to a "T".  I wish I had cooked it about half as long.

Thanks for the wonderful, easy recipe!  I pounded out the chicken breasts prior to dredging them.  Also as advised by other reviewers, I used honey mustard and crushed-up cheddar french-fried onions.        The chicken came out very moist and delicious this way.

I used the blsl chicken tenders on this recipe, I had a big package (probably 15 - 18 tenders), and I just eyeballed the mustard..I also used regular yellow, honey dijon, and regular dijon, mixed all up.  I let the chicken "marinate" in that for an hour or two, then crushed the onions up, I didn't have quite enough to cover them all, so I used some panko with the onions on the last few, and I think I liked them better.  Baked at 375 for 20 minutes, and they were perfect.  The BF even ate them leftover a couple of days later, warmed in the oven, and dipped in ranch, he said they were still good.  Will make again!

Delicious.  I used horseradish mustard and also cooked on a rack to keep the underside crispier.  Leftovers were excellent cold with a green salad.

Made for the second time tonight with modifications that made it even better. I only had 1/2 cup of mustard and half a can of onions so I added 1/4 cup of honey to the mustard and sprinkled the onions on top.  I also sliced up an onion and put it at the bottom of the dish to make sure the onion flavor was there.  It turned out really really yummy and the 2 yo even ate it.  I prefer the french fried onions only on the top because when you coat the chicken in it, they get soggy at the bottom and I don't like that texture.

My family loved this recipe - even the picky one! I did use dijon mustard and added some bread crumbs to the onions just to have them go a little further. Next time I would use a bigger can of onions. Thanks for sharing.

Great Recipe!!! I made this and Cowboy Mashed Potatoes with a side of salad...We loved it! I just took suggestions from other reviewers and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, paprika,cayenne, onion and garlic powder. I also used bone-in chicken breasts and took the skin off....Will definitely be using this again!!! Thank you!

For those that thought it turned out dry, the recommended cooking time of appox 55 min is way too long.  Pounded to an even thickness and baked 40 min leaves this chicken very moist. Just use your favorite mustard and a little garlic pwr and you have a real tasty meal. Cooking any boneless skinless chicken has a small margin of error before it is over cooked.

I made this for dinner last night for my husband and he LOVED IT! I used a large can of French-fried onions and I sprayed the top with Pam to brown the top up a bit.  I also broiled the chicken the last two minutes.  Left overs were great too!  Thanks for this great recipe:)

didn't like this! (sorry, Juliet)  I tried it with both plain ol' yellow mustard and with a grainy, dijon/honey-mustard.  STILL too mustard-y and the French-Fried onions were too Onion-y too!  The coating fell off, too!  ~
Preparation was simple, but I prefer dipping chicken breasts (or pork chops) in egg bath, then coating with buttery-round (Ritz) crackers and spraying with olive oil and baking!

I am very stingy with my stars, but this deserves the top! As another reviewer suggested, I used honey-mustard mixed with regular mustard, and glad I did, as it gave a nice sweet flavor, but not over-powering. First I pounded the chicken breasts to an even thickness. Used the food processor to finely crush the french-fried onion rings, but I will warn you that the large can of rings will only coat just over two chicken breasts. Perhaps it's because I pounded them out, so more meat to coat, but it SO helps to cook them evenly, and they don't need to cook as long, so are more juicy and tender. Truly an excellent flavor; my son-in-law asked me to give the recipe to HIS mother; the highest compliment out there, I think!

DELICIOUS! And so easy to make!!! I used Dijon mustard and put some fresh pepper and Italian herbs on the chicken prior to coating them. Otherwise, I followed the directions. As I was eating it, I kept waiting for the mustard to be overpowering, but it wasn't. And like other reviews said, the crispy onions were amazing. I highly recommend!

A very tasty recipe. I cut down on the salt by making own french-fried onion rings and seasoned them with died herbs of choice. Another take is using homemade bread crumbs.

Just loved this recipe.  I have done this before and it has alway been a hit.  The only change I made was just bonelss chicken legs and breast then I did the following.  In my roasting pan I spread out 1 cup of long grain rice.  I placed the Mustard Chicken on top and carefully added 2 cups of water.  Covered and baked in a 350 oven for about 1 hour. The flavours from the recipe was absorbed by the rice.  Work great.

This is very, very good. And almost too easy. I did use 1/2 cup of regular mustard and 1/2 cup of a honey mustard dipping sauce. Also I took advice of from a couple other reviews and marinated the chicken in the mustard for about an hour before baking. I cut my chicken breasts into 2, so only had to bake for 40 minutes.

This was very good. I used the suggestions of others and put the paprika, garlic salt and salt on one side. I used Honey Mustard. I didn't have any problems with getting the fried onions to stick. After I pounded the chicken breasts I put them in a zip lock bag and poured the mustard in and let them sit for about 15 minutes. I then put the fried onions in a different zip lock bag to crush them. Poured the crushed fried onions in a pie dish and then put the mustard covered chicken in the pie dish to coat. Came out beautifully. Because I only used 2 breasts that were pounded, I only had to cook them for 40 minutes and they came out done and juicy! This is definately on my rotation and will be trying it out with different mustards. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!  :)

This is a surefire winner! It couldn't be easier. I used honey mustard instead of plain, and minced the dried onion rings as fine as I could for generously covering the chicken. It was just so good! I also added paprika, garlic powder and salt to one side of the chicken before rolling in mustard and onion rings, at the suggestion of other reviewers. The whole family loved it. This will become a part of our regular menu from now on. Thanks, Juliet!

My husband really enjoyed this meal. He said it tasted like honey mustard and onion pretzels he buys at the store. I thought it was just okay. I may try some of the suggestions others made. Update: this recipe has really grown on me. I love how easy it is. I do add a little seasoning salt. This has become a twice a month meal!

Tastes good but messy as hell to make. Try putting the onions/bread crumbs in a ziplock bag along with the chicken and shaking it will help some.

I made this last night for 3 fussy eaters!  Wow!  They really liked it!  It was time for a change with the "chicken."  We took a few other suggestions, mixed a few different mustards and I even added a honey mustard mayo!  I mixed panko and ff onions together!  Very good!  Pounded the chicken, baked on a broil pan w/ foil @ 350 for just about 25 minutes!  A keeper for  sure!  Very moist and crunchy, too!  I also added a canadian chicken seasoning!  Clean up was a breeze!  Thanks!

If you pound out the chicken breasts and cut into approx. 2x4 pieces and cook at 450 degrees for 20 minutes, it will be much more tender. I always add a little of Mrs Dash Salt Free Onion and Herb Seasoning to the mix and Dijon Mustard.

My family LOVES this chicken!  We call it "Everyone's Favorite Chicken"!  I use boneless, skinless tenderloins and either spicy or dijon mustard, whichever I have on hand.  Only takes about 20 minutes in the oven. Yum, yum!

My family LOVES this recipe!!!!!
Couple of notes... be sure you pound chicken to a somewhat even thickness   I as others did, put the onions in a plastic bag and take the meat hammer to it so it's more like crumbs.  This allows it to adhere a bit better to the chicken. And just for complete coverage, I cover one side of chicken with mustard and press into onions and place down on baking dish.  then  spoon mustard on exposed side and cover with remaining onions.  Be generous, they crisp up wonderfully!!!  Thanks for such an easy yet awesomely delicious dish!!!!

This is a great recipe as is. My wife doesn't like mustard, but she asks me to make this often. I make it as written but it is simple enough to make some changes to as well. I sometimes add a couple of tablespoons of honey, or blend two different mustard's, or use a different mustard altogether. I get wows no matter how it's made. GREAT RECIPE THANKS!

Very Very Yummy! I used a mix of dijon mustard and honey on the chicken.  I crushed up th onions as much as possible, and I didn't really have a problem with them sticking. I also used chicken legs and broke them into thighs and drumsticks and baked on a baking rack for about 50 mins. This came out much tastier than any breaded chicken I've ever had!!

It was good, but not great.  My spouse made it with thighs, so that might be the issue, but it was VERY mustardy and, well, fine.

I didn't think my 16 yr old son was going to like it because he HATES onions, so I just told him I made a new chicken recipe that was a little spicy and kind of like fried chicken but it was baked. He was like "huh?" and I just told him he'd have to wait and see. Both my husband & son LOVED it. The only change I made to the recipe was the kind of mustard I used. Kroger grocery stores have one called Sweet Hot Mustard. I put the chicken in a gallon sized bag, squirted the mustard in and let it marinate for a couple hours. Then I put the fried onions into a bowl, coated them and put them on a broiling pan and baked. I lowered the temp to 350 because the fried onions were starting to get too dark but even so, it turned out delicious!

I have also made this recipe using crushed corn flakes or crushed crisped rice cereal. It cuts down the fat and tastes a bit sweeter. I would also add onion and garlic powders to the crushed cereals, and maybe some cayenne as well.

I cut the chicken into "strips" and did them with BBQ instead of mustard.  I also mixed some bread crumbs, paprika, and garlic powder in with the fried onions!  In addition to the chicken strips, I did two full breasts with a sweet and spicy mustard that were also very good.  Baked at 400 for 25-30 minutes.  So quick and easy!

Next time I think I'd bake them on a rack like someone suggested so the breasts might crisp all around instead of just on top.  My husband also thought that pounding out the chicken to make it flatter and using them, breaded, on a sandwich sounds good, as well!

Good enough for a repeat...with a couple of adjustments: I found both mustard and french-fried onions a bit overpowering, so I made the following changes: I dredged the chicken in egg to which I had added a scant teaspoon of Dijon mustard; then in a mixture of Panko breadcrumbs lightly browned in a tablespoon of butter to which 2 tablespoons of crushed french-fried onions were added. It worked for me!

EASY EASY EASY and DELICIOUS too!

Followed recipe ...except that as suggested by others, I seasoned the chicken first (i used Cajun seasoning). I used half sweet mustard and half plain yellow.  I crushed fried onions... 

As others mentioned, the fried onions on the bottom get soggy.  (The only reason i am rating it 4 instead of 5 stars) I think next time, i will only dip the top of the chicken in the fried onions.  

Three ingredients...and couldn’t be more simple -I will definitely be making this again.

Awesome & easy.  I mix 3 kinds of mustard:   Yellow, Dijon and Honey Mustard.  In addition to crushed onion rings, I mix in panko crumbs and shredded parmesan.  I bake it on a rack to keep it crisp.  We have this every week.

I end up using more mustard and fried onions because I love how it comes out with the onions & mustard on the bottom of the chicken.  It's such a lovely crispy, goopy concoction.  I also use Dijon mustard for an added kick.  My husband requests this every time I ask him what he wants for dinner.

Husband didn't like mustard but now he goes crazy when I make this. Maybe it's the onions on top. ;-)

We liked this recipe. I used boneless chicken tenderloins instead. The cooking time was much shorter.

I don't know how so many people gave this high reviews.  It's ok.  It's bland and boring and the chicken is dry and flavorless.  It tastes like mustard and fried onions and dry chicken breast.  Delish?  Ummmm no.

This was outstanding. So simple and fast. My husband is just beginning an interest in cooking simple things and said "I could even do that" so maybe he will make it next time. I made it exactly as written except I halved the breasts so they would cook faster. Made it with biscuits (as one other reviewer suggested) and a spinach salad. Fast, easy, delicious dinner for all (adults and 4 yr and 6 yr).

Since I don't eat chicken, I made with tilapia instead. 5 stars for simplicity, 4 stars for taste.

I made this dish and everyone went back for seconds! It was super easy to make, and instead of using boneless breasts, I used skinless, boneless thighs. If you use the boneless skinless thighs, you can decrease the cook time to about 30-40 minutes.

Awesome! I used half dijon and half yellow mustard, besides that, followed the recipe exactly.
