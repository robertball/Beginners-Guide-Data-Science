I made three small changes. I did not use the whole amount of salt (just enough to flavor it without going overboard), I added some fresh ground pepper and because I wanted to skip the cornstarch, I cut back on the milk. I used fat free evaporated milk which is a little thick on it's own. I used just enough to give it a creamy flavor, really no more than a third of a cup. For us, we didn't really care for the cloves in this soup recipe. I think I'd like to try this again without it. Then it would be just right for our family. This was crazy simple.

I LOVE this recipe. I am a huge fan of tomato soup, but I don't like store-bought because of all the sodium. When our garden started producing more tomatoes than we could eat, I decided to cook and freeze this soup. I follow the recipe almost exactly, except I use less salt and more sugar. Instead of 2 C chicken broth, I use 1 C tomato sauce and 1 C broth.   Great and healthy recipe!

I followed the recipe loosely.  Very loosely.  “Eight tomatoes” was too vague for me.  Eight large tomatoes?  Eight medium or eight small tomatoes?  When I brought in a big bowl of tomatoes from my garden today, they ranged in size from teeny to behemoth.  (I grow several different varieties) The size of the tomatoes used for the recipe would definitely affect the outcome.  So I kind of winged it, but weighed  what I used for purposes of this review – I used just a tad over three pounds and ran them all through a food mill before proceeding with the recipe.  I found the directions to cook the peppers “until slightly charred” a little confusing.  I’m not sure how you’d do that with them chopped, in a pot, with a teaspoon of butter.  When I think of charred I think broiled or roasted, in the oven or over a flame.  Suffice it to say I sweated out the peppers and onions and added the garlic during the last 30 seconds or so before adding the tomato puree and the chicken broth.  I used no sugar, cloves, oregano, basil or cornstarch – I wanted nothing other than the rich, sweet, red-ripe tomato flavor enhanced by that of the bell peppers. When it came time to add the milk, I used a combination of milk and heavy cream for extra creaminess and richness.  Upon serving I gave each bowl a small dollop of pesto, which complemented the tomato like brown mustard does a brat.  This soup, along with BLTs, was homegrown tomato nirvana.

My husband is not a big tomato fan, never cared much for tomato soup, but this one is so good, he had two bowls and wants me to make it again.  A definite keeper!

Wonderful recipe!  Gave me something to do with all the tomatoes in our back yard!  I only made two changes--I added 1 1/2 c grilled corn (shaved off the cobb), and I used only one can of chicken stock.  Very nice!  The corn gave the soup a sweet crunch.  I also grilled the tomatoes (to get the skin off) and bell peppers.  It was a bit messy, but certainly came out great!  Served this with Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site--yummy!

I've used this recipe several times, doubling and tripling the recipe so I can not only have dinner, but freeze some for the future.  Wonderful use for all those extra garden tomatoes.  Family loves this soup!

I didn't know how good tomato soup could be! I cut off the tops of the tomatoes and scooped out the pulp instead of peeling, and that was easy.

This hearty and chunky tomato soup exudes freshness to the max...the charred red peppers done in a small amount of butter are the secret flavor here.  I would cut the ground cloves from 1/4 tsp to a pinch...they are a great addition to the mysterious charred red peppers but too strong. I cheated and used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and an immersion blender at the end cutting down on cleanup and prep time. Add a touch of red wine and you have an almost creamy tomato soup that is bursting with fresh flavors and qualifies in my book as "light"!

This was excellent though I did tweak it a bit to suit our taste and to streamline the prep. I used 1 red pepper because that is what I had on hand.I only used a pinch of cloves to tone that flavor down. I mixed the cornstarch into cold evaporated milk and I stirred it in with my immersion blender.The cornstarch cooked and thickened right in the hot soup.  I also blended the whole thing with my immersion blender because I like a smooth tomato soup. Wonderful results and very nice on a cold winter day. Thanks for sharing!

I converted it to a crockpot recipe and it turned out great! Sauteed the veggies and added to them to the crockpot with the other ingredients.  I changed the milk to heavy cream and it in at the last.  Everyone raved!!! This recipe will be keeping me warm all winter!

The soup was wonderful, BUT bt the time you heat water to be able to peel tomatoes, peel tomatos,chop or mince all of the vegtables,who ever did that in 15 minutes must be Super woman, it took me about 1 hour.  I told my husband that the next time we had it, it would be a join effort.  Added grilled cheese sandwich, and called it supper.

My 4 year old said this is his new favorite soup!  I doubled the recipe, used fresh instead of dried basil, used low-sodium broth and added only a pinch of salt, and finally added about 2 cups of chopped spinach.  YUMMY!!

I made this exactly following recipe states, and it is good.  I did use the milk and cornstarch to thicken, and used immersion blender on entire pot.  This is a healthy, and low calorie soup.  The cloves do give it a little more of a  “roasted” tomato flavor, which is still very good.

This soup is fantastic! I added some carrots, jalapeños, and celery when I made it. We loved it so much that we decided to can a large batch but skipped step #2 because my Grandma always told us that milk doesn’t can well.

Follow most of the recipe only used 6 large tomatoes and a can of Italian peeled tomatoes, omitted cloves (which I hate), otherwise I used a mix of butter and olive oil.  It was simply delicious, it'll be my "go-to" tomato soup from now.  Very easy to make.  Ah...forgot to mention I added the rest of the cream I had in the fridge which made it a bit richer but totally not needed if you only add the thickener (( did) milk and corn starch.

That was delicious.  The only change we made was to use plain yogurt in place of milk and cornstarch.  (And the second day we put rice in the leftovers to make them stretch.)  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

But my husband says 5 stars. Also "the best tomato soup I've ever tasted".  I followed the recipe except for adding about  a 1/2 cup of my homemade spaghetti sauce.  (It had some capers and black olive pieces in it.)  It was a very nice recipe.  I never thought about putting some ground cloves in with the tomatoes, but I think it gave a nice completed finish.

I made only a couple of changes the second time I made this that made it, in my opinion, even better! After sautéing the red pepper, I added a little more butter to the pan and sautéed the onions until translucent, added the garlic and sautéed one more minute. Then I added the tomatoes and spices (excluding cloves based on many other reviews), and cooked as directed. I didn't want to use the corn starch so added a

My husband raved about this soup!  I cut back on the salt to 1 teaspoon and added a smidge more sugar. Also, I omitted the cloves.  Instead of straining 1/2 the veggies to a blender I used my immersion wand.  I will definitely make this again!!

This soup is fantastic. I made 2 changes I used veggie broth instead of chicken and I added zucchini because I had a bunch. This is so much better than regular tomato soup! Thanks for sharing!

Very rich tomato flavour with a lovely chunky texture.  I added a pinch of sugar because it was a little tart, and put in a can of evaporated milk to boost the creaminess.

Best Tomato soup I have  ever made or have eaten. 
I used half the salt and used a immersion blender (be careful when hot)  to smooth it out a bit.

This soup was excellent!  I used a pinch of cloves but overall made the suggested recipe.  I froze a good portion and look forward to enjoying it this winter.

Best way to screw up Tomato Soup is to add disgusting stinky Bell Peppers!

I read the reviews before I made this the first time (tonight) and decided to cut the salt in half and double the sugar. Other than those two changes, I made it exactly to the recipe. It was very tasty. My husband and I both love it and will definitely be making it again and again.

I omitted the oregano, added a couple sprigs of fresh thyme, left out the sugar, and threw in about 20 leaves of julienne fresh basil. Didn't need the sugar, as my tomatoes were plenty ripe. Also scaled back to 1 teaspoon salt and amped up the black pepper a bit. I used an immersion blender and it tasted perfect, so I didn't even add the milk or corn starch. Tried a bit with a splash of milk, and it was good, but I just went ahead and left it simple and healthy (which is a rarity for me. I almost always opt for the richer version when given a choice.)

With a few changes i found this very yummy, better than anything bought from a shop! I added half a parsnip at the same time as the peppers. I missed out the clove and basil and used a bay leaf instead. I also used fresh oregano instead of dried just because its what i had. But very yummy witha piece of baguette and butter!

This is not your everyday Tomato soup. Tomato soup elevated to a gourmet level.   Made ours from fresh garden tomatoes. Lots of flavor.  And don't be put off by the ground cloves at all. Just adds to the flavor complexity.
I am going to also consider this for the base of my spaghetti sauce. Definitely one of my new favorites.

Let me preface this as saying we are not big fans of tomato soup but we had tons of tomatoes from our garden that needed used. This soup is amazing! So much so that we have made it twice in the last 2 weeks now.  We used cream instead of milk and only used about half the recommended cloves but my family absolutely LOVED it. This recipe is a keeper.

This is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I usually make in fall and winter. We believe if we had a restaurant that folks would line up around the block for it! DIDN'T change a THING about the ingredients. However, I have an electric range, and so I cannot properly bring the veggies to a true char, such as flame can. It doesn't affect the way the finished dish turns out for us. We absolutely love it. I like to store 2 servings in the freezer for quick dinner in a pinch, otherwise it doesn't last here. I make a special trip to my favorite roadside farmer's market stand to buy large beefsteak type tomatoes. While there I buy fresh yellow and red bell peppers, as well. Paired with my own version of a grilled macaroni and cheese sandwich, it is a supper fit for a king! When blending the soup I use blender stick and do the entire pot until smooth.

YUM!!  Made this with my fresh garden tomatoes and a red bell pepper.  (Didn't have a yellow one.)  I also added about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper just because I love just a hint of heat in soup.  Absolutely loved this soup and the fact that it's very low calorie only made it better!  Made a wonderful lunch!  Will certainly make again!

Had a bunch of tomatoes to be used. Found this recipe. I have only one word to describe it. AWESOME!!!! My family loved it.
