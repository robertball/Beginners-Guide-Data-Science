Perfect cheesecake. Now I have made a lot of cheesecakes but this is not only simple but probably one of the creamiest I've ever made. This is my suggestion for baking because 400 is going to give you a burned cake... No water bath as water baths often end up with a soggy crust and soggy crust is worse than a crack any day... Just simply bake the cake at 400 for 10min, then without opening the oven door reduce the temp to 200 than continue to bake for about 45 min, until it's almost completely set. Then I turn the oven off and just let it set in there til the oven is cool. Usually about an hour and a half to two hours. Then refrigerate it overnight. I'm telling you this is the best way to do it. There will be no crack and it will look a creamy off white. There ya have it. Oh and I also beat my ingredients with a mixer for close to 10 min. I have found it also makes a difference. Thanks.

Not a bad recipe.  I've been making cheese cakes for years.  However a good cheese cake must be silky smooth and creamy all the way through.  NOT lightly brown around the sides!  The only way this can be done is in a water bath.  Don't worry about soggy crust.  Double wrap your pan with 18" heavy foil and I guarantee your crust will not get soggy.  When center wobbles, turn oven off, crack the door open and let cool for about an hour.  Also do not over mix (10 min. is far to long as suggested by another reviewer)  Generally, after adding each primary ingredient, mix for only a min. on mid. high and then scrape down the bowl.  This usually means only a total of 4 to 5 min.  It should be smooth NOT whipped for a perfect cheese cake.  Follow these rules and your cheese cakes will be soft, creamy through and through and will always be crack free.

My future daughter-in-law wanted me to make cheesecake for her wedding cake.  After trying several recipes - this one was the unanimous winner.  I ended up making 7 total for the reception.  Two months later I'm still receiving compliments about how it was the best they've ever had and how creamy it was.  The only thing I did different was to adjust the baking time and temperature as was suggested by others.  Actually - I ended up doubling the recipe to have a taller cheesecake.  **Once you put the cheesecake in the oven - DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR UNTIL COMPLETELY COOLED** I baked them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, then dropped the temperature to 200 degrees for 45 minutes, then turned off the oven let it set for approximately 5 hours.  You must also let it refrigerate overnight to set.  Every single cheesecake came out perfect.  I tied sheer ribbon around the cheesecakes for the presentation and sprinkled rose petals on top.  Thanks Mary for posting this recipe!

This recipe is ok, but not the best. The best New York Cheesecake recipe I've every made is from Cook's Illustrated Magazine. They baked over 200 cheesecakes to find the perfect formula. New York Cheesecake is supposed to have a deep nut brown crust on the top, no pale cheesecakes qualify for the New Yorker, and you can't get the brown crust in a water bath. The best baking temp and time according to Cook's Ilustrated is: 500 degrees for 10 minutes then 200 degrees for at least 90 minutes, until the center of the cheesecake reaches 150 degrees (yes, use a themometer for this). If it goes beyond 160, it will be overcooked and it will crack. A brown crust on top is what you want on a New York Cheesecake

This is MY LATE MOTHERS ReCIPE AND POST. I was so honored to find it here 3 months after her passing. I am incredibly thankful for all of you that are taking this recipe and bringing it into your life in your own ways. This would make her incredibly happy and humbled and delights me as it makes me feel that part of her is still with this world, still extending her love and generosity. She was and is a great person and mother and always put us well before herself sadly. She was my favorite cook of course. I've noted that many use a water bath and I know my mom would support this. She told me if I was ever worried about cracks to use a bath and let it cool gently. It may make a difference in the door ajar or not in that she was using an older electric oven that was definitely not as good as what they make now in any way. She was amazing with what she could do with that thing though. So times may have changed the recipe a bit due to differences in equipment since the 60's. She always told me she dreamed of a gas oven/ stove. :) I think that she would love to know all the different things, variations, and events you are making our little family cheesecake for. I was so happy when someone used to at a wedding wow!! Thank you. 


Prior post(I just wanted to say that this is my Mom's recipe and I didn't know she was posting on here. She is an excellent cook as every one says and it means even more than I just found this RANDOMLY as she has just recently past away unexpectedly.)

I made this recipe for my husband's birthday and the guests went crazy! It was the best cheesecake I've ever made. We couldn't get enough of it. I made a strawberry glaze for the top and served it with fresh strawberries and cream but any berry would be great! I am definitely making it for the next birthday!!!

Very easy.  Very, very good!  No, heavenly!  I made and baked it exactly the first time.  Delicious, moist, and set throughout, but sides and surface were very dark.  Second time I baked at 350 for 1 hour, and left in closed oven for 3 more hours.  This resulted a much more blonde color.

This cheesecake was great to make! I made a cheesecake for the first time using this recipe as the basis for my food finals project. I made two just incase and they both came out perfectly! No crack on any of them. I followed the advice that CDPEFFER gave as well. All my classmates and the taste testers ate all the cheesecake before i was able to have a piece for myself. They were all raving about it, so i guess that means that it tasted great :] Thanks for the recipe!

I made this cheesecake for my daughter's 9th birthday.  I covered it with whipped topping, adding some candy decorations and a candle. We served sliced fresh strawberries on the side.  Everyone loved it.  I did change the crust, using vanilla wafer crumbs instead of graham cracker.  A tip would be to blend in the eggs, then the cornstarch, and then the vanilla.  If you do it all at once, the cornstarch can get lumpy.  Also, I covered loosely with foil the last 10 minutes as the top was getting very brown.  I will definitely make it again!

I served this at Mothers Day this year, and my husband's stepfather is enamored with it.  He is a hard man to please, so you know its a good recipe!  I also followed the directions from CDPEPPER, and it is the best advice I've ever taken regarding cheesecakes.  Thanks!

I made this a couple of weeks ago with some of the changes suggested, and made an additional change as well.  I made it in a 13x9 pan, added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the graham cracker crumbs for the crust (I always do, makes the crust a bit more interesting).  I also used 1 cup sugar (generous cup), 3 large eggs and five 8-oz packs of cream cheese.  I baked it as the others stated, 10 minutes at 400, turning the temp down to 200 for 45 minutes, turning off the oven and letting the cake cool.  I liked making it in the 13x9 pan, makes cutting it and serving it much easier.  This recipe freezes well too, by the way.  I also added some fresh lemon juice to the batter, which enhanced the flavor, in my opinion.  A keeper recipe..thanks a bunch.

I followed the directions that CDPEFFER posted below. I added one egg at a time and I only used 1 3/4 tbsp of cornstarch. Bake at 400 for 10 minutes then without opening the oven, reduce to 200 for 45 min. Turn oven off and let it sit in oven for 1-2 hours until oven is cool. I leave my cheesecake in the springform pan overnight in the fridge so it's easier to maneuver around. It's also easier to remove from the springform pan the next day. This recipe is great. This is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten!!!! I make it for ALL of our family events!! Everyone loves it!!!

Awesome recipe. My huband's co-workers ask if I brought cheesecake everytime i stop by his station. Many have even admitted it was better than their wives but would never admit to them! :) I followed CDPEFFER's recommendation of 10mins at 400 then 45 mins at 200 and leave in oven for 2+ hours until cool (don't open oven!) i've tried this about 5+ times and comes out perfect each and every time. no cracks and tastes devine! this recipe makes cheesecake making very easy!!!

I am absolutely shocked with this recipe. I read about 50~ reviews and thought this would be a good recipe to make, but unfortunately it wasn't. The top burned after 20 minutes of baking and as soon as I stopped the 45 minutes of baking and opened the door to cool down, the cake dropped about 2 inches!!! And the worst thing is, I was trying this out for my friends, family and coworkers and I managed to scrape most of the burned-ness off but it was wayy too creamy and tasted like butter!!  I'm sorry, but I'm not impressed with this recipe whatsoever!!!

This is a wonderful recipe. I was a bit scared because of the reviews and the many recipe variations/changes that the members here posted, but I did everything by the recipe except I baked at 400 for 10 minutes and then at 200 for 45 minutes and it turned out awesome!

Great recipe! Just be sure to not over beat the batter as that can cause cracks on top. I made three of these for a mother/daughter banquet and they all came out perfectly!

Delicious - served it at a party and had lots of requests for the recipe. Used some else's advice and baked it at 400 for 10 minutes, then 200 for 45 minutes and let it stay in the oven until cool. Worked very well.

Best cheesecake I have ever made - appearance, texture-wise and taste! Followed others suggestions and baked 10 minutes at 400 degrees, then 50 minutes at 200. Left the cheesecake in the oven for 2 hours with the door ajar until cooled down. I used crushed Nilla Vanilla wafers instead of graham crackers and added 3/4 of a cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup to the cheese mixture (wasn't sweet enough, probably due to the sour cream, when I made it the first time).

Delicious!! Came out perfect the first time I made it.  It has the perfect consistency and there wasn't a piece left!! I changed the amount of cracker crumbs to 2 cups and butter to 8 tbs because I used the 10 inch springform and like a little more crust.  I baked at 350* for 1 hour in a water bath and it came out perfect.  My niece loves cheesecake and says this one is her favorite!!  thank you for sharing this recipe.

I was disappointed that this didn't provide enough filling for a 10 inch springform pan, resulting in a thin "whimpy" cheesecake instead of a thick and robust one. That being said - the flavor was tremendous! Next time I'll make a bit more filling than the recipe called for,

I was a little unsure about this recipe- leaving it in the ajar oven- but it has turned out to be a favorite with everyone I serve it to- I have at times used lite cream cheese and sour cream and splenda and it turned out just as well.

Yum! This cheesecake is great! Took a while to settle - much better after a night in the fridge. Delicious! (I also baked 10 min. at 400, then 50 at 200)

Great cheesecake.  Very creamy, and not to sweet.  I did find that the top did get a little burnt, but the taste was not affected at all.

MY MOST FAVORITE CHEESECAKE EVERRRRRRRR!!!I have been making cheesecake for many years now and it was passed down by my Mom who is a queen at cheesecake and still makes them to give at Christmas time and New Year's to everyone as a gift of love with actual presents. Ssshh don't tell my Mom I said this is better than her's and that is saying A LOT!! I didn't use a spring form pan but a Keebler graham pie crust pan and changed is I used only 1/2 cup of sour cream and next time I will only use 1/4 cup to see if the taste is more sweeter, I also took the CDPEPPER proven true advice and baked it  400 degrees for 10 minutes then the remaining 45 minutes at 200 degrees, turned off oven and didn't open the door while I left it in there for an additional 1 1/2 before putting in the fridge overnight. What a difference. I had no cracks!!! Oh I didn't beat ingredients  together for 10 minutes though just the normal 1-3 minutes. MHARMAN486 I wish I can shake your hand in person for such an excellent recipe that has changed the way I now do cheesecakes.

I have made this twice with excellent results. I did follow other reviewers suggestions and baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, then turned down the oven to 250 degrees for about 35 minutes. I let it cool almost completely in the oven with the door closed. This is a good tasting and very creamy cheesecake. Will be my go-to cheesecake recipe.

Great, Easy recipe. Although the crust was kinda soggy.  It was very tasty.  Added a 1/2 tsp of almond flavor as well as the vanilla.  Followed another readers baking hints. Bake at 400 for 10min.  Then without opening open door decrease temp to 200 for 45min. Then leave in oven for 2 hours.  Cake did not crack.  Looks picture perfect.

Great recipe with advice taken from CDPEFFER to bake 10 min at 400 degrees, then 45 min at 200,  and leave in oven to cool about an hour with temp off. The second time i made it i used the wrong reviewers tip and it came out burned. Trust me use this baking time and it should come out perfect.

This recipe is wonderful! We had our neighbors over for dinner and everyone raved over this cheesecake. My husband actually said he would have thought I bought it if he hadn't seen me making it! We followed another reviewers recommendation regarding the cooking time; 400 degrees for 15 mins and then 200 degrees for 45. This is one is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

Yum! This recipe is wonderful. It is by far the best that I've ever made, with a velvet texture and store bought looking topping. No cracks at all and only slightly more coloured on top, that looks like a light glazing - perfect. (no bain-marie required or pan of water below) As we don't have Graham Crackers in NZ - I used roundwine biscuits which are sweet - and didn't add the sugar to the base. I also added cinnamon to the base, which made it more interesting and tasted great. 
To lower the calories, I used low fat Philadelphia cream cheese, lite sour cream and Splenda (a sugar substitute) instead of sugar. 
As my partner is a big fam of lime cheesecakes - instead of vanilla, I substituted the zest and juice of 4 small limes and added a bit of extra Splenda to make the sweet/sour combination perfect. I also followed another members suggestion of baking it at 400 for 10min then 200 for 45min followed by leaving it in the oven for 3.5 hours then chilling it. We couldn't resist having a taste while it was still warm - it looked and tasted out of this world and was even better the next morning. Thank you for a recipe that will be a definate favourite from now on.

Excellent Cheesecake!  We did make a few changes....We could not find our springform pan so we doubled the batch and made it in a 9 x 13 glass pan.  We baked it at 400 for 10 minutes then turned down the temp to 200 at baked an additional 60 minutes.  We then left it in the oven without opening the door for an extra 4 hours (until the oven was cool).  We refrigerated it overnight then served it the next day.  Absolutley delicious!!!

Not a bad cheesecake, pretty close to the same recipe we use were I work. I used a vanilla bean in my mix because the flavour is more intense and I find the vanilla bean seeds add to the attactivness of the dessert. I also crushed up some shortbread in a food processor and used it as my base. Served with fresh sliced peaches.

Wow did I impress a lot of people with this recipe. A mighty big thank you to CDPEFFER as well for the excellent instructions. Only change is I added 1cup of sugar instead of 3/4cup.

I will definitely make this again!

I thought this was a very easy recipe to follow, as it was the first time I made a real cheesecake.  I didn't have a springform pan, so I used two round 8 inch aluminum cake pans and it was just the right amount.  I'm not an expert on cheesecakes, but I thought this tasted excellent and others agreed!  I did use a cup of sugar and drizzled chocolate syrup on top to make it look and taste scrumptious!  I will definitely make this again!

I didn't think this was sweet enough, and I used the bath to bake it and even tho I did wrap tin foil around the pan the crust was still a bit soggy. I baked it on 400 for 10 mins then turned it down to about 300 after that, it didn't split in the center and texture was very nice. I think if I do this again I will add a wee bit more sugar.
But hubby thought it was great...

I followed many of the tips given by other users like baking at 350 deg., adding vanilla and adding 1/4 c sugar to make it sweeter. The cheese cake was perfect except where is the flavor in this cheesecake??? I topped it with cherries and that helped but this otherwide perfect cheesecake lacks flavor. I would love to try it again but somehow jazz up the flavor.

I baked this cake for the office and it was a huge hit - thank you Mary! I do not have a pan large enough to do a water bath so the top was brown, but the cake was so good, I didn't care. My oven tends to run hot, so I lowered the temp and checked for doneness at 35 and 40 minutes, thought I ended up using the entire 45 minutes. This is a great, rich cheesecake - slivers are all you can eat. Be prepared to WOW your family and friends!

This cheesecake turned out PERFECT!  The only change I made was to cook it at 325 degrees and in a water bath.  The top turned out a perfect color - just lightly browned around the edges. I think 400 is too hot for a cheescake.  Served it with fresh rasberry sauce

I made this for Bernie on Valentines Day.  My first ever attempt  and it was a triumph!  I was worried we would have to freeze some because it was a lot. Worried for nothing because we ate all of it and it didn't take long.  I did add vanilla and left out the 2 extra yolks. Thanks everyone for the very helpful tips.

This recipe was the most fabulous cheesecake I've ever made and, I've made plenty!  I didn't make any changes in the ingredients but I did in the preparation.  I lightly rubbed the sides of the pan with oil.  I double foiled the bottom of the pan and put it in a water bath.  When the center wobbled, I turned the oven off and opened the door and let it cool for 1 or 2 hours.  Other hints are to NOT overmix.  10 min. is too long.  I would mix on med. high just to blend in each ingredient - then 4 to 5 minutes to finish blending it. You do not want it "whipped", you want smooth.

Super easy and tasted great!! This was the first time my cheesecake didn't crack!! It came out perfectly. I made a pecan crust to make it gluten free for my hubby and I served it with homemade strawberry syrup. It was an absolute hit and every bit of it was gone almost in an instant!! This will be my go to recipe from now on!

LOVED this cheesecake recipe! I followed the recipe to a  tee and it turned out perfectly. This was our Easter dinner dessert and everyone raved about it :) It is thick, dense and not too sweet.
This recipe is SO versatile...I made ours a gluten-free one and it was delicious. Next time, I will add berries as a topping or...maybe a sweet chocolate  ganache. Mmmm...
Anyhow...this is a great must-try recipe!

This recipe is amazing. I followed the instructions of CDPEFFER after reading the comments of another baker. I was worried it wouldn't set up, but it did. My husband is picky about sweets, I mean really picky. I saw his face when he took his first bite and knew this recipe was a keeper. The filling is creamy, smooth and just perfect! I used almond flavoring for a change, but will use the recipe as is and just swap out flavorings to suit the occasion. (Made it for Christmas dessert at my step-daugther's Christmas Day Dinner.) Don't be afraid to try this recipe for a special occasion without testing it first. It's absolutely amazing!

I've used this recipe so many times. It's a winner with everyone who's tried it, and I use it as a base to experiment with. I've made Baileys cheesecake, chocolate cheesecake, peanut butter cup cheesecake... all turned out tasty! My suggestion if it cracks... smother it in whipped cream!

I've been looking for a new NY cheesecake recipe and this is it!
It was so creamy and yummy and done. 
The only changes to make are (as with other reviews): 400 degrees for 10 minutes then change to 200 degrees without opening oven and bake for 45-55 more minutes.
It's not quite flavorful enough to stand on it's own. Using vanilla bean or some lemon zest would probably take it to the right level, but if you're planning on a topping then it's just right.

Absolutely excellent recipe. I started it at 400 degrees for the first 10 min then w/ out opening oven door turnd it down to 225 for 45 minutes.  Then left it in the oven for about 1.5 hours. No crack, just rich and creamy, I loved it- everyone in my family did!

Awesome recipe, i used some of the reviews and made some changes.  I zested an orange right over the mixing bowl and it gave it a great fresh taste.  And i also baked it in a water bath, my only problem was that i didnt have more cheesecake!

Great chessecake.  Found it better to bake at 350 degrees for 50-55 minutes and leave it in the oven only an hour after baking.  After removing from the oven, I put the cheesecake in the oven and chilled it prior to serving.  Has received excellent raves from almost everyone who has tried it.

Two attempts, 2 perfect cheesecakes! I also followed CDPEFFER'S suggestions and mixed in my Bosch for 10 minutes and then baked at 400 for 10 minutes, turned the oven down to 200 for 45 minutes and left it in the oven until it was (almost) cool. (It was late so I took it out still a bit warm, covered it with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge - fortunately it was not affected.) YUM!

I followed this recipe to the letter. What a waste of time and ingredients. Batter didn't fill 10" springform pan. After sitting in the oven with the heat off for a 1hr. it developed a too brown crust and shrunk. I had to know that 2 lg eggs just wasn't enough. It's more like 5eggs and use a 1/4 c of flour not 2 tbls. of cornstarch. Better yet use the water bath method. :(

I did not care for the uneven browning on the top layer of my cheesecake when cooked with these directions. My flavors turned out great, but the presenation lacked. Thankfully my blueberry compote hid the top layer.

I made this for my husbands birthday and everyone loved it. It was different than other cheesecakes that I have made in that it was more like the kind you get when you go out to a restaurant.  I modified it a little by adding about a tsp lemon peel and 1 1/2 tsp orange peel for a nice citrus flavor, and I lined the springform pan with foil, then used 1 cup graham cracker crumbs and 1/2 cup ground walnuts and 5 Tbsp butter instead of the 6 and it turned out good. I also took the suggestion about the 400 degrees-I did it for 20 min, then turned the oven to 250 for the rest of the time and no prob with cracking. I am filing this to make again for sure.

This is very similar to the cheesecake recipe I received from a friend in 1981, written on the back on an envelope! Th only thing I do differently -- and not instructed by my friend -- is to separate the eggs and beat the whites until stiff. The yolks go in with the rest of the filling. I then fold the whites in until incorporated. A very light and fluffy cheesecake!

Hubby said, "Best Cheese Cake that he has ever ate!"  He said it was lite and fluffy and not all sweet tasting.  I decorated the top with a dark chocolate and had strawberry topping to put over it.  Son ate it with with no topping and liked it.  Daughter said it was good, but I could flavor it better (she's a tough critic).  I personally thought it was easy to make and very tasty!

I just made this yesterday and my family just ate the last piece.  Although it did crack in the middle, i covered it up with strawberrys.  Also my crust was a little overdone.  I did achieve the blonde color i wanted.

This cheesecake is amazing. Cheesecake is my favorite desert as well as my sisters. One night I decided I would make this since my sister and her husband were coming over for dinner. One thing you should know is my sister is VERY picky, and she LOVED the cheesecake. I had alot left over and brought it into work and everyone is asking me for the recipe! I plan to make this again!

Outstanding!!! This is a basic recipe and it was very easy to follow.  Very creamy, which is why you must let it set for 24 hours.  I cheated and ate a tiny slice so I can taste it, it was devine.  If you like a dense cake this one is not for you, but you have to try it.  I added a little lemon zest to give it a little kick but other than that it rocks.

A very good basic cheesecake. I added lemon & orange zest and juice because I love a citrus flavor and bakes @ 425 for 20 minutes, then 200 for 40 and left in the oven overnight. Another day in the fridge and the texure was PERFECT. I did get a crack, but it was tiny, and I'm not willing to risk soggy crust with a water bath.

Following other suggestions, baked at 400 for about 15 minutes, 200 for 45; then let sit in oven a couple hours while oven cooled. Served with a rasberry sauce made simply by crushing raspberries, pressing through a strainer to remove seeds, adding a little sugar as desired. Received rave reviews at Thanksgiving dinner I brought it to.

My 8 year old made this cheesecake and it turned out great!  We used a traditional pie crust vs. true NY style, but it still came out perfectly.  Easy to make and a treat to eat.

I too am shocked with this recipe. It was the worst cheesecake I have ever made, or ever had at that matter – even if you throw the box mixes into the category. The crust burned, even on the bottom and the flavor of the cheesecake part was off. I strongly suggest trying a different cheesecake recipe, whoever finds this good hasn’t had good cheesecake.

This was the best cheesecake I have ever made - that is from my husband.  I made a couple little changes to the recipe based on some of the comments...I used Amaretto instead of vanilla - that was WONDERFUL!  I baked the cheesecake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 10 minutes, turned down to 200 for 45 minutes and left it in the oven until cool.  Then I put it in the refrigerator until after dinner.  The only thing I would do differently, is bake it the night before and have it in the fridge over night and the whole next day.  It was better the next day.  But oh this was sinfully good!  THANK YOU!!!

This was my first attempt at making a cheesecake and it was PERFECT! After creaming the sugar and cream cheese with the mixer, I incorporated all the other ingredients by hand. I was planning on baking in a water bath until I realized I did not have any aluminum foil. So I baked it according to CDPEFFER's suggestion and it turned out GREAT! No crack, nice and creamy white on top and just a little "tan" on the sides. I also buttered my springform pan before pressing the crust in. All in all a great recipe! My husband loved it!! Said he would eat it plain (so would I, even though I usually like a berry on top) and he said it was better than what you would buy in the grocery store deli. I plan on keeping this recipe and making it for my mom! Thank you!!!!

Yum, yum, yum!! This was my first cheesecake try, and I'm so glad I came across this recipe! It's very good. The crust came out excellent! Followed the tips from previous reviewers about adding cinnamon to the graham crackers, adding a little fresh squeezed lemon juice, and breaking up the baking time (400 deg. for 10-15 min, 200 deg. for 45 min).  Left all the ingredients out overnight to come to room temp, then whipped up the cream cheese first before adding anything to it at all. Didn't open the oven door at all till the oven cooled down completely, about 2 hours or so. Refrigerated the first one for a few hours, and will leave the second one in the fridge overnight.  Absolutely perfect. No cracks, no air bubbles, so smooth and velvety. Yay! I can make cheesecake!!!

I made this because it had the least amoung of eggs and was the 'healthiest' one I found on this site.  I also used the 1/3 lite cream cheese.  YUM!!!!!  We baked it for 10 mins on 400 and then 45 mins at 250 and left it in the oven for about 2 hours.  YUM!!!!!  We decorated the top with sliced strawberries and blueberries with a little bit of splenda and it was a HIT at the party!  Thanks for making cheesecake an easy and successful experience!!!!!!!!  YUM!!!!!!!

This cheesecake is amazing!! So rich and creamy, not pasty. I used all neufchatel cheese to cut down on fat and baked it at 400 degrees for 10 min. and 200 for 45 min. as previously suggested. I removed it when my oven was cool and refrigerated a few hours before serving. Definitely a keeper!!

I made this cheesecake as directed although I took the advice to lower the temp to 350.  It was good - depending on what you are looking for.  I thought it was really, really creamy which was good but it lacked a little flavor and I used REAL vanilla.  I also did the water bath.  I covered the bottom with foil but I'm beginning to think I'd rather have a cracked top than a soggy crust.  You don't have to have a hole in your foil to get a soggy crust, it just creates a lot of condensation in there.  It was good if you like creamy versus dry.

Instead of making my crust, I used the prepacked graham cracker crusts. I doubled the vanilla, used three 8 oz packages of cream cheese (2 full fat, 1 low-fat), added more sugar, one more egg, and little bit more sour cream. As I had enough mix for two cheesecakes, my coworkers got to love it, and so did my boyfriend's parents.

I have an electric range, and had the cheesecakes in for 35 minutes, and the tops were way too brown. Still edible, but not very pleasing to the eye. I'll probably decrease the cook time and the temperature per the other reviews next time. I also put a pan of water on the bottom tray of the oven, and I still got cracks in the cheesecake. I'll probably use a pan with more surface area next time. Great recipe, and I will try it again!

Very good recipe!  Next time, however, I think I will add a full cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup.  The filling mixture wasn't quite sweet enough for my family which made the cream cheese taste a bit too overpowering.  Will also try previous suggestions on altering the baking time as the cheesecake does indeed get very brown when baked at 400.  Definitely a keeper though and worth making again!

The exact kind of cheesecake I searched for days for! Thick and creamy, with a mild bite. Luxurous dessert indeed! Elegant as a stand-alone pie, thinly sliced - too intense for large portions. Begs for add-ins and/or toppings! 
Watch the "water bath" technique recommended in the cheesecake suggestions on the site. What they DON'T mention is the steam will catch in the the folded-over foil sides and saturate the pie's bottom thru the springform. Didn't even occur to me :o/ Fold foil OUTWARDLY.

Perfect!!! The only changes I made was to the crust.  I wanted a chocolate crust so I crushed a pkg. of oreo cookies and put into the bottom of gressed pan.  Also served with cherrys on top!  This is a great "base" for all of your cheesecake needs. Thanks for sharing.

I’ve made this 2 times.  My wife loves it.  I’m not a cheese cake fan but because she likes it so much, well, “ Happy wife, Happy life!”  I just follow the recipe.  I do do one thing that is not in the recipe.  I mix the cheese cake filling for about 10 minutes.  It makes the cheese cake very smooth.

I have made this twice so far this week. After the first one, my wife asked me to make one for her Christmas party at work so I made this one today. No cracks and I did not let it brown by baking it at 400 all day long. I took the written advice in the comments and baked it at 400 for 10 minutes, turned it down to 200 for 45 minutes and then let it sit in the oven for 2 hours without ever opening the door. I also had it in a water bath.  We love the flavor of this cheesecake and I have another one scheduled to be made tomorrow.

This has to be the best cheesecake I’ve ever made!  I started the oven at 400 then stepped it down to 200 after 10 minutes. I will extend that bake time to 15 minutes next time as the cake was a little wet.   After turning the oven down, bake for an additional 45 minutes Then, I turned the oven off. leaving the door closed I let the cake sit for about 2 hours before refrigerating.

This is an excellent cheesecake recipe. I've made it a few times and it has turned out great every time. A few general tips: After pouring the cheesecake filling into the pan, jiggle the pan to even it out. This will prevent cracks on the sides of the cheesecake. I always do a water bath. I know that some reviews love it and others hate it but I have always placed a 13x9 pan with 1 in of water under the cheesecake in the oven and it has never cracked. Not once. I cook the cheesecake on 400 for 15 minutes. Then bump the temp down to 250 for another 45 minutes. Then I turn the oven off completely and let the cheesecake sit in there cooling. Then I crack the oven with a wooden spoon for another hour. Lastly I take it out and set it on the counter to complete cooling. It is ready to be put in the fridge when the bottom of the pan has no warmth to it any more. Hope that it helpful to someone!

Baked for 10 mins on 400 and then reduced to 300 for 45 mins and then let it sit in the oven with the door closed. Turned out perfect. Will make again for sure!  Everybody loved it.

this recipe sucks! I should have read and heeded the reviews. Baked at 325 for 45 minutes and then left in oven to cool for an hour. Completely burnt on bottom.  I usually make Italian style with ricotta but chose this one without because I made lasagna and didn't want  to serve that much ricotta!

So, this is now my favourite cheesecake recipe. Instead of using white sugar I used confectioners' sugar because i just had a lot that nobody was using. I think the taste turns out the same, but it's a bit creamier. And i also don't put it in the oven for as long bcuz i spilt the batch into two cakes.

I have found this to be the best cheesecake recipe.  I use CDPEFFER's  baking tips for a perfect cake with no cracks.  I also double the crust and press it up the sides of the pan because who doesn't love more crust?

My gosh, I thought I was in Miami Beach again in the 70's munching on a slice of Adler's cheesecake.  Easiest recipe I have ever used for cheesecake.  I used CDPEFFER's advice on preparing by mixing for 10 minutes then baking at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and then turning down the temp to 200 degrees for 45 minutes.  Then allow to sit in oven till oven cools, never opening door from insertion til removing.  Absolutely perfect.  My neighbors and family are so happy weather is getting cool again so I am back to baking goodies like this.  Tam ganeydn!!!!!!!

This was so very easy!   It is a shame how much $ I have spent on buying a secondary product.  This was my first attempt. Easy ladies go for it.  Creamy,,,,,I used a cookie for the base after I realized I did not have any Grahms.  It was delicious.  Have fun baking.  Yum

This was my first time making cheesecake. It was a hit! Everyone loved it. Next time, I will leave it for less time though because the crust was a bit burnt. I also added a little bit of cinnamon to give it a  slightly different taste. It was especially good after the 2nd and 3rd day in the fridge.

This was amazing.  I have never made a cheesecake before, so I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but it was soooooo good.  Side note, if you've never used a springform pan before, you need to put foil under it so stuff doesn't leak to the bottom of your oven and make a smoky mess the next time you use it.  Oops, lesson learned.

I selected this recipe because of the listed items I thought would be great! It turned out great! I would leave some of the strawberries whole to give some texture.  Tip to make sure you leave it in over night before adding strawberries.

Absolutely the best Cheesecake recipe ever. This is a family and crowd favorite! I have made this recipe several times, and it always turn out perfect. Follow the reviews though, cook at 400 degrees for 10 mins and then turn down to 200 degrees for 45 mins. Never cracks and comes out amazing everytime!!

This was very easy. Cheesecake has always intimidated me but this was very manageable. I made it with CDPEFFER oven /cooling recommendations. I like my cheesecake a little sweeter though. I think the next time i will add another 1/4 of sugar to cream the sour cream mix. I had to double the recipe to cover a 9' spring pan for the crust  and it was still very thin once the cake was done. Next time I will do a double layer for the crust.  I covered with a  strawberry topping and it all worked out (even with a  crack;). Definitely keeping this one.

I made this for Thanksgiving, the first cheesecake I ever made. My daughter in law was highly impressed, which is tough to do, considering our neighborhoods have awesome Italian bakeries with awesome cheesecakes. I've got one in the oven now in preparation for Christmas.

The cheesecake was heavenly, the only thing I changed was the baking temp. and time as suggested in  previous  reviews. I baked the cake at 400° for 15 minutes, turned the oven down to 200° and let it bake for another 45 minutes, then I turned the oven off and left the door shut letting the cake rest in there for approximately three hours or until the oven was cool.

Best cheesecake I've ever made! Dense, creamy, beautiful to look at and tasted like a dream. I made this for my husband's birthday and it was a hit! I substituted an Oreo crust and took many reviewers' advice to bake at 425 for 15 minutes, then lowered the oven temp to 200 for 45 minutes, then turned off the heat altogether and let it stay in the oven slowly cooling for another 3 to 4 hours. This is the first cheesecake I've make in a long time that didn't crack and remained intact for a beautiful presentation. The use of the sour cream keeps it lightly tart and not overly sweet. This wonderful recipe will be my go-to cheesecake from now on! Try it -- it will not disappoint.

Loved it! So did my entire family! SO GOOD! SMOOTH AND CREAMY. We got cherry filling for it and hot fudge, caramel, and pecans for turtle. Amazing!

I have made So many variations of NY Style Cheesecake recipes that I stopped counting.  This one has my top vote. It comes out creamy, the crust is delicious and it never makes a second day of existence in the refridgerator.

I love cheesecake. I did exactly what the recipe said but the top of my cheesecake burned a bit and my crust too and that was at 35 min. Took me two try's :/ to get it but it was so good going to try other baking methods soon.  I also made little cheesecake bites dipped in chocolate.

I made this and it turned out great. Putting a pot of water under it does prevent it from cracking.  Will be making this again real soon. Thanks for the recipe.

I will never use another recipe, EVER!  This is perfect.  I have used it as a base to create my own flavors and it never goes wrong.  I have tried different tips on the time/temp of baking; however, I believe I will try a water bath to see if that helps at all.  This is WAY better than Cheesecake factory!

This was my first ever cheesecake. I am not a baker (you have to measure stuff) so I read a few posts before trying it. I was careful to not over mix and left it in the oven until cool... WOW what a great cake! My husband and I really enjoyed. This will not be the last time I make it.

I made this exactly as directed except I baked at 425 degrees F for 10 minutes, then 250 degrees F for 45 minutes and then turned off the oven and let the cake sit in the oven for 4 hours.  I tasted it before refrigerating and wasn't very impressed.  But after 48 hours in the refrigerator, it was AMAZING, the best cheesecake I've EVER eaten.  Topped with homemade strawberry sauce.

This is a great recipe.  You can use it as a basis for other cheesecakes as well.  I melt 6 blocks of semi-sweet chocolate and add it before adding the sour cream for a great Chocolate Cheese Cake.

This recipe is outstanding.  I baked Fourth of July cheesecakes for two separate parties this weekend and received rave reviews.  I changed the recipe slightly by using 1/3 less fat cream cheese and 1/3 less fat sour cream to lessen the calories somewhat, and these changes also produced a lighter texture, which I loved.  Additionally, I added one drop of almond extract, and the grated rind of 1/2 orange and 1/2 lemon.  In order to make it festive for the holiday, I mixed 1/4 cup of the 1/3 less fat sour cream with 2 tbsp. of powdered sugar and spread that over the top of the cooled cake.  I then added a circle of fresh blueberries to the center, and decorated the edges with fresh strawberries.

I have made this recipe several times, each time is perfect! this is a fool proof recipe! This is also a great recipe to make additions to, one time i melted some orange marmalade and poured it over the chilled cheese cake, another time i added the Zest of 4 meyer lemons, Both time they came out great!

Great recipe.  My husband says it's the best cheesecake he ever had.  Not too sweet and very very easy.  I love the trick of freezing the crust.  (I cut the crust recipe in half.)

I've made this cheesecake several times for family get togethers and everyone raves about it.  I don't change a thing.  The worst part is that you have to let it sit in the oven so long and can't use the oven.  But it's so worth it.

I love cheesecakes and enjoy baking them.  I've baked a few in my day but my problem was all tasted good but all of them cracked not matter what I did.  I decided to give this one a try after reading reviews of women who said to bake at 400 degrees for 10 mins, than turn oven down to 200 degrees for 45 mins, and than without opening the dor to oven shut the oven off and leave in oven for a couple hours.  I did this and for once I had a cheesecake that looked beautifull without a crack and tasted amazing.  I drizzled caramel and chocolate over the top with a glass of cabernet wine, and thought I died and gone to heaven.  Everyone said this was the best cheesecake yet.  Baking it slow is the key to no cracks.  No water bath needed for this cheesecake.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  My son requested it and it has been 15 years since I baked a cheesecake.  I could not find my recipe and this one seemed the closest. It was a little bit to creamy, I like a firmer cheesecake.  I think i use to large of pan.  I followed the directions but I feel it needed to cook on a little longer.  I also let it set overnight in the oven.  My son love it...

Wonderful recipe. I've tried making cheesecakes before but none have come out this well. I had people over for Thanksgiving dinner and they all loved it!! I took the advise in some of the other reviews like cooking it at 400 degrees for only 15 minutes and the remaining time at 200 degrees. Geat recipe!!!

This is the first time I had ever baked a cheesecake and it turned out pretty good! I followed the variation directions and it turned out just as those directions said it would, however i didn't leave it in the fridge for a full 24 hours..but it was pretty much set by 16 hours.  Will make again!

This one really brings a lot of yum-yum noises with every bite. Many women have promised to marry me because of this recipe. I usually wait a full day before serving the cheesecake. It goes very well with a strawberry topping, or at least that's what the fans like. :)

Nice, easy cheesecake. The sour cream adds a pleasant tangy taste.

The recipe was great and easy to make for a first time cheesecake maker. My only suggestion is to turn down the temperature  b/c mine got a little too brown on top the first time I made it. The 2nd time I cooked it at 275 for about an hour.

Great recipe...very simple!  This was my first cheescake and I was a little nervous, had heard cheesecakes can be tricky, but this was easy to make and very smooth and creamy.  Thanks so much!

Great, simple recipe!  I wanted to make a key lime ginger cheesecake, so at the end I add 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, a tablespoon or so of grated lime peel, and 2 tablespoons or so of fresh grated ginger.  I wil certainly make this recipe again!

A friend of mine, who never cooks, wanted me to give him a cheesecake lesson. We used this recipe and it turned out beautifully. Easy and delicious. It was best the next day after being refrigerated.

This was my first attempt at cheesecake.  It came out great!  I used the tips for making cheesecake off of this site.  I let the cream cheese come to room temperature and then I whipped it separately before I added the other ingredients.  I used the recipe "graham crackers" off of this site for the crust which came out perfectly.  We don't have to go to the Cheesecake Factory anymore to enjoy rich, delicious cheesecake. Thank you!

The very first time I made this I was so nervous because cheesecake intimidates me.  However, this recipe came out PERFECT.  My boyfriend absolutely loved it!  I have made this over and over and every one loves it. The consistency is so smooth and creamy, it is wonderful, I can't say enough good about it.

Delicious!  Great flavor, not too sweet, so excellent with a pie filling on top.  I baked at 350 for an hour, then let it cool with oven ajar.  Delicious with a Nilla Wafer crust!

Wow! Made this for Mother's Day and it was a hit. Everyone wanted the recipe before they went home. I fancied it up by topping it off with drizzled chocolate and toasted macadamia nuts. This one's going in my recipe book!!

I even burned the  thing and it still tasted awesome!!
My oven is hotter and cooked it faster than the 45 recommended so put your timer at 10 minutes shorter to start checking it.

This cheesecake was "da bomb"!!  My family absolutely loved it!  The only problem was that the entire top of the cheesecake turned brown, even though I under cooked it about 10 minutes (I was afraid to burn it!).  But, nevertheless, it turned out to be just fabulous!  I made a strawberry glaze to pour over top when served.  TWO THUMBS UP!!  Definitely a keeper.

Made 2 cheesecakes in my first attempt, this one, and a turtle cheesecake from this site.  What a hit!  I don't know what was more impressive, the taste of the cheesecake, or the fact that I made it!  Very good recipe.  Recommended.

I substituted 1/4 c. pecan crumbs for 1/4 c. graham cracker crumbs in the crust. Everyone liked the variation to the crust.

This was a wonderful cheesecake, nice and firm without that pudding "no-bake" texture.  It was easy to make, and after it chilled it tasted exactly like cheescake you'd order at a nice restaurant.  The top did get VERY brown when I left it in the oven for the recommended time, maybe it was the altitude where we live.  Definately a "do again"!!
