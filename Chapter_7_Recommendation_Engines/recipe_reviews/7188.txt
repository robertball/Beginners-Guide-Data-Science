This bread is sweet and satisfying, delicious.  BUT I have made it twice and both times the bottoms stuck in the pans.  The first time I did not grease the pan because the recipe does not say to do so.  There is 1 cup of oil in the bread and I thought that would provide sufficient release.  It didn't.  The second time I sprayed the bottom with a release baking spray.  The bottoms stuck again.  Has this happened to anyone else?  Any suggestions?

I had lost my favorite recipe for zucchini bread and found this similar one.  My old recipe also had the crushed pineapple in it and it always made it so moist.  This was a wonderful bread to make.  The modifications I made were using 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla, 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. nutmeg.  I then added mini choc. chips and raisins.  With the pineapple well drained, the batter is thick and none of the raisins or choc. chips sunk to the bottom.  This recipe made 3 mini loafs (baked for 35 min) and 1 8x5 loaf. After running around the edge with a knife, they all just slid out of the pan.  No sticking!  This is my new recipe for zucchini bread.  I won't bother cont. the search for my old one.

Thought this was very tasty but a bit on the sweet side.  I used 1/2 cup apple sauce in place of 1/2 cup of oil.  Found shredding the zucchini was easiest in a food processor.  Also added pecans and coconut based on another suggestion.  Next time (and there will be a next time), I will cut down the sugar (use 1 1/2 cups) and omit 1 egg yolk (to cut down on fat).  Also noticed my bread took an extra 20 minutes to bake.

This recipe makes 2 9x5 loafs, or 2 8x8 pans, or a 9x13 pan, or about 30 muffins.  Just change the baking time accordingly.  Last night I made a 9x13.  It was done right at an hour.  I substituted splenda granular for half of the sugar and unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil.  To draw out the water in the zucchini, I grated it, measured it and then froze it overnight.  The next day I thawed it, drained it and added it to this recipe.  Thanks, everybody, for the high reviews.

This is almost the same recipe that's been in my family for several years, with the omission of the pecans and by increasing the pineapple to 2 cups. This is a very moist, almost cake-like bread. Half of the oil can be replaced by applesauce without and changes in the taste or texture of the bread, and I've gotten away with replacing the 3 eggs with 6 egg whites.

I was after a pineapple zucchini muffin and when I chose this recipe it was because it had no spices and that intrigued me. I expected a good muffin, but I also expected it to be ordinary.  Zucchini contributes moisture of course, but it's basically tasteless! What I got was anything BUT ordinary.   Rather than the moist but bland muffin I expected, I was treated to a pleasantly sweet, richly pineapple flavored muffin!  I've made pineapple-zucchini bread for years and years but always with spices, which left the pineapple barely noticeable.  This was remarkably otherwise! Other than using half a recipe to make 12 (gorgeous) muffins, I followed the recipe exactly, right down to the nuts and raisins.  To pump up the pineapple flavor even further I drizzled them with a simple glaze of 1 c. powdered sugar, a dribble of corn syrup for sheen and some of the drained pineapple juice I had set aside.  Delicious and unexpected in its uniqueness.  I wish I had tried this recipe a long time ago.

Delicious!! I did egg substitute for my allergy kids, and did 1/2 cup applesauce, and 1/2 cup oil. I decreased the sugar to about 1 1/2 cups. I increased the raisins to 3/4 cup, (next time even more) omitted pecans, and added about 1/2 cup coconut. I read in other reviews that it needed spices, and I took the spice amounts from other zuke bread recipes-- I did 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. nutmeg. Wonderful, definite keeper.

I made this bread twice, with some changes the 2nd time around & it turned out excellent. the bread tends to stick to the bottom of the pan, so put a little parchment paper on the bottom to help you remove it after baking without breaking. only added 1-1/2 cups of sugar, instead of the full amount (otherwise, its super, hurt-your-teeth sweet)& used half cup oil/half cup applesauce.  you can't tell the difference & it just lightens it up a little. definitley try this one.

This is the most wonderful bread I have ever eaten. Even my husband who hates anything green ate it. I gave some to my neighbor, who also, wanted the recipe. You can freeze leftover zucchini and use it for future loafs, (which I did, but make sure you drain it good) and I would recommend spraying the pans. One of my loafs did not want to come out.

Nice texture.  I made 8 small muffins and one large loaf.  I thought it would be sweeter-especially since I subbed 1/2 of the oil with homemade apple butter.  Thanks for a new twist on zucchini bread!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  It's healthy (more veggies and fruit than flour or sugar!!) And its so light and tasty. I made 35 muffins out of this recipe and they came out perfect! I will make this again and again!!    Also, I don't eat nuts so I substituted chocolate chips for nuts and it came out great... next time Ill try mixing and matching other ingredients-Because I cant stop making this! And coming from a baking amateur, ANYONE can make these delicious treats taste AMAZING!!

Very yummy and moist.  I used WW flour, cut the sugar to 1 1/4 c brown sugar, substituted applesauce/pineapple juice for 3/4 c oil so used only 1/4 c oil, added 1/2 c each shredded coconut and chocolate chips and 3/4 c raisins.  I used pineapple tidbits instead of crushed pineapple.  My two-year-old did all the mixing - what an easy recipe! I forgot to add the suggested spices (by other reviewers) but will try next time. This is a keeper.  I greased and floured the pan and the bread slipped out easily.

I made 2 different recipes for zuchinni bread and this one really got rave reviews from my co-workers.  It turned out very moist and a great texture.  I used walnuts in stead of pecans and omitted the raisins.    Next time I might try adding a pinch of cinnamon. Might be good with dried cranberries instead of raisins?  I think you could be pretty creative with this recipe.

Yum!  I used fresh pineapple, a little bit of coconut and no nuts.  I also used a bit of brown sugar in place of a part of the white sugar.  The bread fell apart a little when I took it out of the pan but I think it was just too hot.  It is tasty though and I will make again.

This turned out delicious.  One of my loaves stuck to the pan, but I realized this was because I did not let it cool down enough. Let the loaves stand for about 15 minutes, release the sides and nudge the bottom of each loaf with a butter knife then invert.  The bread was a big hit - even the kids could see past the veggies.

Good bread recipe but have to reduce sugar for our tastes and also add some cinnamon. For those who had trouble with it sticking the simple soution is to line your loaf pans with bakers paper  - or even aluminum foil that has been greased with either shortening (not oil) or Pam.

This was excellent.  I omitted the raisins, and it was still marvelous.
Thanks so much !  I greased the pan with Pam for baking, and that worked great.

Everyone loved this. They said that it was the best they ever had! After reading the reviews by others, I too added extra ingredients, such as; 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, coconut, slivered almonds, 3/4 cup applesauce and only 1/4 cup oil, pineapple tidbits instead of crushed and gumdrops. Before baking, I sprayed the pan with Pam and dusted with sugar. Thanks for the recipe.

I did not drain the pineapple and decreased the oil to 1/2 c.  I was concerned that there weren't any spices in the bread, so I added 1/2 tsp cardamom.  This was delicious for breakfast - moist, but not soggy.

i picked zucchini out of the garden and made this recipe..my first time making it.  i don't care for it as a "vegetable" but loved this, and so did my friends.  i made if for a birthday cake in a larger, shallower pan and topped it with cream cheese icing and some blueberries (from my garden)  it was a big hit.. and i'm getting ready to make two more, freeze them while the vegie is still growing and fresh, and use eat them later.  i used whole wheat flour instead of white.

I tried this about a week ago, since I needed to use up some zucchini.  This bread tasted okay, but I wasn't very impressed with it.  It needs some more flavor, like maybe cinnamon or nutmeg.  I'll try it again later and add some spices, then rate this again.  Thanks anyway.

This is a great bread! I used 1 cup of brown sugar and only a 1/2 cup of white sugar and added an extra cup of zucchinni. Used pecans and pineapple but left out the raisins. Freezes very well if you vacuum pack it.

Mine turned out to be not done after the 60 min baking time.  Cooked 10 min. more and still was not done.  Cooked 10 more minutes and it ended up sort of drier than I expected. My mother-in-law made this and it was fabulous.

Great Recipie!!! I found that the 15 or 15 3/4 oz new wt. can of crushed pineapple is just a little over a cup so I used the whole can. Walnuts work well as a substitute for pecans.  I always have walnuts on hand.  Think next time I just might try adding a handful of coconut too. A delicious not too sweet dessert or snack.

I've been disappointed by so many zucchini quick breads but I keep on trying new recipes hoping to find a good one.  This one is the best I've had so far, very moist and full of flavors.  I substituted half of the oil with apple sauce and cut down the sugar to 1.5 cup.  Very nice bread.

First of all, I definitely wouldn't make it again!  I love baking and this was clunky, or heavy.  I tasted the batter because I thought was blah so I added a tsp of cinnamon, but if I were you, find another recipe on this site.  This is not memorable.  I made it for Mother's day brunch, but will not use it.

Eat one loaf now, freeze one for later!  This recipe is very similar to an old family recipe that I have used for years.  As long as the zucchini and pineapple are well-drained, it is perfectly moist, and delicious.  I do grease & flour the pan (the old-fashioned way with butter & flour) every time, and have never had a problem with the bread sticking.  It is also a good base recipe, and it freezes very well.  I like to make the batter up fresh in summer with our home grown zucchini, split it into two bowls, then add some cinnamon and nutmeg to one bowl.  Then cook each in its own loaf pan.  We like to eat the un-spiced loaf in summer, but come Autumn the loaf baked with the cinnamon and nutmeg is impossible to resist.  (To freeze, I wrap the loaf in plastic wrap, then foil, and it keeps for 3-4 months).

Good, REAL Good!
I changed it up ever so slightly to try and make it a little healthier for you. I used half applesauce and half oil. I used walnuts instead of pecans because that is what I had. I used 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of 2 and I am glad I did, it was VERY sweet even with the cut down of sugar. Next time I might push it down a little more but there will be a next time for sure. I may even try putting some coconut in it like a few other reviewers suggested on the site. My hubby loved it and my snob against zucchini kid both loved it immensely. It was incredibly moist and tasty.

I did change the recipe a bunch so not sure how it is as written but to be fair I stuck with 5 stars.  I read lots of reviews for this bread and other zuc/pin bread recipes so I based my changes off of those.  I was really trying to make a healthier snack so I used 2 eggs and 2 egg whites, 1 cup applesauce in place of the oil, splenda in place of the sugar and whole wheat flour.  I used extra zucchini (from the food processor for ease), extra pineapple and about 1 cup raisins.  I added 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon and 3/4 tsp nutmeg and increased the baking soda to 1-1/2 tsp.  I baked in 3 loaf pans (they were 8X4X2 roughly) and it took almost 2 hours for them to be done.  I wasn't so sure they were done even then b/c they were so moist, almost gooey.  The end result was pretty great tasting.  Next time I will use just a little extra zucchini and pineapple to cut the gooey-ness a bit but I will do everything the same.  The kids LOVED this!  I was going to give a loaf away but we ended up eating all of it!

Made the recipe exactly as written, except ommitted the walnuts. I refrigerated it overnight and brought it into work the next day. It is very moist and definitely taste the pineapple, but it was a bit bland to me and honestly, not sure what would zip it up a bit...maybe some cinnamon or cloves. Most of my co-workers raved about it though, but I think its because they rarely get home made things!

Not your average zucchini bread!  This recipe halves easily (just one egg).  I added chinese five spice powder and cinnamon for fun, and used walnuts instead of pecans.  Bakes well in my trusty glass bread dish.  Would be a nice addition for holiday meals.

This is an awesome variation to zucchini bread.  We are going to a luau and everyone must bring a hawaiian style food.  I thought this would be a good one to bring.  We have so many zucchini's from the garden and this is a delicious bread to make with them.  Very easy to make and everyone will enjoy it.

pineapple is light but refreshing. no changes, other than omitted the nuts; and subbed some apple sauce for oil. added more than cup of zucchini, but recipe is very forgiving. made in big muffin tins.

This bread was delicious!  A kind neighbor gave me 12 garden fresh zucchini.  Been trying out lots of recipes.  This was perfect.  Made 2 beautiful loaves. I added 1/2 cup coconut..Otherwise, I followed the recipe.

I'll use less sugar next time. I used butter instead of oil. Should have buttered the pan instead of used oil. I tasted the oil and I just think the oil taste makes it less good.

I sprayed and floured the bottom of the pan let cool for 15 minutes they  came out of the pan and on the cooling rack. I didn't make any recipe changes and it is delicious and very moist. I will most likely make this one many times over.

I baked this bread in a bread pan made out of silicone (never any sticking) I added some apple pie spice (1tsp). I also used half apple sauce and half sour cream for the oil. (less fat) I also used half brown sugar and craisins instead of raisins . It turned out wonderful. I gave my girlfriend some to take home and she said it was so good and unique tasting with the pineapple in it. Thanks I make it at least 2 times a year!

Other than using white whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 cups of brown sugar, I made this bread and it was very tasty! Just made another batch tonight, using chocolate chips instead of raisins. Great recipe..for sharing!!

I substituted 1 cup brown sugar for white.  I used 1/2 cup applesauce for half of oil.  I used half whole wheat flour.  I greased and floured the tins and lines them with parchment paper.  It worked good, no sticking, like someone else said.  This receipe was good, I think I would add some spice next time.

This is the first time I have made zucchini bread with pineapple and now I don't think I will ever make it without! This is a very easy and delicious recipe. I omitted the raisins and used walnuts instead of pecans. Very good!

A little on the sweet side, I will reduce the sugar next time. I made this with whole wheat flour instead of white and used half brown sugar and half white (probably why it was a little sweet). A very tasty way to get my kids to eat raisins!

This is outstanding. Great flavor.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg, and used pineapple tidbits, as that was all I had on hand. It was great to taste chunks of pineapple in there.  Will probably reduce the amount of oil to 1/2 cup next time.

I've made this many times and it's been great.  Sometimes I omit the raisins and add chocolate chips, and I vary the nuts that I use.  I use whatever I have on hand.  It's a very moist bread.
