Realy good...but i had to make some changes used toasted wheat bran instead of cereal  added extra 1/4 cup milk and 2 table spoons of sugar  and used parkay in place of Crisco. then topped with a strusell topping all and all its good i might add a little more sugar still to take out the bite of the bran  or swap out half the bran for some oats.

These are okay.  I needed to use up a couple of bananas and love bran.  With butter spread these are good.  A little bland otherwise.  However, if I had to use up the same ingredients that I needed to, I would make these again but with allspice or cinnamon or something.

I didn't have All-Bran cereal but I did have Raisin Bran. I used it instead. I didn't thinly slice the banana, I cut it into bits. My kids liked these okay. I think I might add a little more banana next time and perhaps some cinnamon or nutmeg.
