We use ground turkey instead.  I usually add a tsp of chili powder, 2 cloves of garlic, a tsp of cayenne and 2 tsps. of cumin to give it some extra flavor.  Also, try browning the ground turkey with olive oil and garlic powder.  This is a fave.  There is rarely enough for a meal by the time it is finished cooking because one of us always has a spoon in it.

This recipe is a great chili alternative for people who don't eat red meat. None of the flavor is sacrificed, and it was just hot enough for me (the heat level can easily be adjusted). Best of all, this is an easy, no-fuss recipe. The leftovers taste great too! When I made it, I used a pound of ground fresh turkey rather than canned turkey. Cheap and healthy!

Corwynn, once again, I am pleased with the results of a recipe submitted by you.  I used ground turkey, (because I had a pound of it taking up freezer space) but I bet it would be just as good with the canned.  Upon my first taste, I was like "I don't know about this one" but after an hour of simmering and the seasonings blending = good eats!  By the way, I used the "chili seasoning II" from this site which worked great.  Thanks again!

This is an excellent recipe, and I've made it several times with a few changes depending on the crowd.  First off, I use fresh ground turkey, add a chopped bell pepper, a can of rotel, and a couple of tbs of sugar - ALWAYS.  For my spicier friends, I substitute half the kidney beans with hot chili beans (this is my favorite way to have it).  For those who prefer a milder chili, I leave out the chopped chilies, and use the mild chili beans.
Regardless of the crowd, this chili always gets rave reviews!

I have been making this for a long time, and I use fresh ground turkey meat. I brown the meat first, and I eliminate the chili peppers, since I do not like it that spicy.

I make it often, since it is a fave recipe of mine.

I halved this recipe for a 1.5 Quart Slow Cooker.  I substituted the canned Turkey for one diced Chicken Breast (uncooked) and turned it into "Spicy Chicken Chili" and it was fabulous.

I made this on football sunday for my in-laws. They loved it! I used ground turkey and browned it before adding to the other ingredients in the slow cooker. With an hour left I added 1/4 cup of water mixed with 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken the mixture up a little. It was perfect on a cool afternoon! Thanks!

This is the perfect chili recipe.  It is great with left over turkey from Thanksgiving.  It is also a quick, filling meal.  Great with cornbread or crusty rolls.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was ok but it certainly wasn't spicy at all.  I would add hot sauce or cumin or something to make it a bit more flavorful, but it was super easy and healthy.

Made this  last night for the first time.  I ended up cooking on low for 2.5 hr and turned it to high for another 2 hours.  I should have just had on high for 4 hours to begin with.  I did follow another suggestion of adding the cumin, garlic, and crushed red pepper.  For those that like spicey chili, I highly suggest this...it had great flavor, and even better left overs for lunch today.

I have been using this recipe for a few years now. I do a few things differently, I use diced tomatoes instead of stewed and I use chicken breast or ground beef instead of canned turkey. I have won awards with this chili so THANK YOU for putting it on allrecipes

Used canned chicken but any cooked chicken or poultry will do. Didn't see canned turkey at the store. Canned chicken is tender & convenient.  I thought it could use maybe twice as much meat.  Anyway, it is good, if you like things spicy and real tomato-y.  It is spicy but not real "hot."  We added cooked macaroni to tone it down a bit, but it was a good, easy chili.  Instead of slow cooking it, I brought to a boil and simmered covered real low for a couple of hours. Thanks, from Susie

For how easy it is...this recipe is awesome!  I used ground turkey and first cooked it in the skillet with garlic powder.  Made everything else as is and was excellent.  It makes a lot!  
Thanks,
Brittany

Very good chili, but wasn't spicey enough for me. Will add jalapenos next time. I used ground turkey instead of the canned stuff. Browned it first, then cooked it all for about 8 hours on a low setting. Even better the next day!

This was pretty good chili, and very easy.    I used low-sodium versions of everything I could find, since the sodium content in the recipe is kind of frightening.   I also used steak because the store I was at didn't have ground turkey, and I'm not a fan of canned meat.  Next time I'll be sure to find some ground turkey for it.  It was incredibly easy to make and tasted really good, so thanks for the recipe.

My boyfriend and I LOVE this chili.  I do make a few modifications.  I prefer to use ground turkey, so I mix everything else together while browning the turkey.  I also add some extra chili powder and a little cajun seasoning to give it an extra kick.

Really great recipe!!!  I've made this a couple of times and wouldn't change a thing.  If you're not keen on the beer, just remove it from the recipe, there is plenty of liquid from the tomato products.

When I first started cooking I made this recipe and really liked it; however, I made this again a few years later and I did not care for it at all.  Not sure if I did something different this time around or my cooking skills have improved thus changing my expectations, but I won't be keeping this in my recipe book.

This is so easy to make -- I pop the ingredients in my crock pot in the morning and by evening, it is a delicious meal. I brown the turkey first, adding garlic powder and italian seasoning. And because I like things extra spicy, I put in extra chili powder on top of the chili seasoning mix. A box of Jiffy corn bread goes great on the side. :)

Quick, easy, and tasty!  

(After making this last night I threw my trusty but labor-intensive stovetop chili recipe away).  

This one is perfect for the slow cooker!

Amazing chili!!! I used 1 lb of ground turkey instead of the canned turkey.  I also browned it with some Worchestire sauce prior to putting it in the crock pot.  It was awesome and is definitely a go to meal for the future in our home! :-)

This was great!!  But where do you find cubed turkey??  I ended up using canned cubed chicken because that was all I could find, in 3 different grocery stores.  And I don't live in a small town.  I could have browned the ground turkey like many of you, but I like the chunkier texture the cubed meat provides.  Flavor was great!!

Fantastic recipe!  I have to admit - I used it as a starting point and made a lot of additions!  I omitted the water / used canned, diced tomatoes / added 1/2 can pumpkin / added 1/2 brick cream cheese / also - I only had one can of kidney beans and one can of black beans.

It came out fantastic and I took the other reviewers' suggestion and used ground turkey (1 lb.) browned with the onion.

Thanks for the recipe/idea!!!!

I used ground turkey and browned it the day before.  Made this the day before and threw it in the crock pot the next morning.  I added about 1/4 cup jalapenos and cooked for about 11 hours while I was at work.  Served this over mashed pototoes. Good Recipe

i'm a huge chili lover and the taste was just really off.I wouldn't add the canned green chilies at all -i'd use diced green peppers and only one pkg chili seasoning .Then add a 1/4 cup chili powder-1/4 teas. red pepper flakes, 1 heaping TBL of cummin, and 1 bay leaf..flovor will be alot better.I also just cooked it on stove top and used ground turkey.

Canned meat kind of freaks me out so I used ground turkey. I seasoned it with chili powder and quite a bit of red pepper flakes because we like it hot! I also cut up two jalepenos to add the the crock pot. This recipe is called "spicy" but I'm not sure how it could have possibly been spicy with out my jalepeno and red pepper flakes added in. I used rotel with geen chillies instead of stewed tomatoes because I don't care for stewed tomatoes. I also used pinto beans along with the kidney beans. I didnt add any water either. It was GREAT! I gave it threee stars because I chagned most of the recipe.

I thought this recipe was just OK - so after the rave reviews it has recieved by others, I guess I was expecting more.  It was easy.  It was edible, but I probably will not make again.

I cooked this for almost 24 hours on 'warm' and it was indcredible easy.  I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of canellini beans.  It was good but the chilli seasoning was a little overpowering but it could have been the brand I used.

This was delicious and my husband loved it too. I did change some things... 1 lb ground turkey which I browned with chopped  onions and garlic. I used 2 cans stewed tomatoes, 2 cans diced tomatoes and 2 small cans tomato sauce. 1 can green chillies. 1 lg can kidney beans and 1 lg can red beans. I used 1 packet of taco seasoning mix bc I didn't have chili seasoning mix. I think the taco seasoning gave it a really good flavor. I added minced garlic and chili powder probably about a tbsp and a dash of cayenne pepper. We added shredded cheese and wrapped it in heated tortillas. Delicious!!  Next time I might make it with about 1 1/2 lbs ground turkey meat.

Spicy Turkey Chili Haiku: "Not sure about this. 'Twas a good, basic chili. But not that 'spicy.'" I guess the submitted expected one to use a certain kind of "chili seasoning mix", b/c, really, that's the only thing that would make this as spicy as she says it to be. I halved the recipe, using 3/4 lb. of ground turkey that I browned w/ the onion, but followed the recipe faithfully, only tossing in a near-empty bag of frozen corn. This is the kind of chili that would work really well on top of french fries, a baked potato, hot dog, or hashbrowns, as it's not really remarkable standing on its own, but it's, by all means, not bad. Bonus points for it being super-easy to make, but definitely not a chili for wow'ing a crowd.

I had some leftover chicken, so I chopped it up and used it instead of the turkey.  Plus, I also made one of the chili seasoning recipes from this website, and everything worked out wonderfully!  Pleasantly spicy and perfect with some cornbread muffins.  I'll certainly make this again!

My husband actually looks forward to this recipe!  He doesn't like anything I make and a friend of ours told me my husband had actually praised this recipe!  I do add a few more spices and change a few things, but overall, this I have gotten great accalades for this!

My husband and I loved this dish. For us, it wasnt very spicy so we added some hot sauce in the crockpot and also on the dish right before we served it. We also put a dollop of sour cream on top. Delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!

I will definitely make this again. I added Rotel because I love tomatoes in my chili.  Love the little bit of kick the green chilies provide.

Was skeptical about canned turkey meat (didn't even know that existed!), but it was fine.  Recipe could use 3 cans and spicy chili seasoning. I mixed dark and light red kidney beans.

Great stuff and easy to make.  I usually use two onions and toss in some jalapenos for some extra spice! As a bachelor, I live on this stuff!

This one is a great recipe! It tastes good and very convenient to cook if you have a busy schedule.  Just make it at night before you go to bed, and it is ready in the morning.
