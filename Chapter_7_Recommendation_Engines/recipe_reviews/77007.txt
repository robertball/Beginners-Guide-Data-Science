This was excellent!  I used my own red sauce, but the chicken came out great.  I marinated the chicken in buttermilk, garlic powder and an egg for several hours first.  I added a bit of flour, parmesan and salt to the breadcrumbs and didn't need the egg as my chicken was wet from the buttermilk.  Pounded flat, dipped in breadcrumbs, back in buttermilk and again in breadcrumbs. Sauteed in olive oil, topped with cheese on a rack and broiled for a few minutes.  Yummy!  To the previous reviewer, if you pounded your chicken breasts to the recommended thickness they should only take a few minutes per side!

For the sauce I added a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes and omitted the oregano.  For the chicken I coated it in flour before the egg and used Panko for the bread crumbs.  After the chicken fried I topped each with a 1/4 C of the sauce and 3 T of a mozzarella/provolone blend and a T of parmesan and baked it for about 8 minutes at 450 degrees.

I thought this was a great simple recipe. The sauce was real good. I made  Mozzarella sticks ( http://appetizer.allrecipes.com/az/FridMzzrllChsSticks.asp ) with this dish, and the sauce went great with them. The only things I plan on changing next time I make this is I will put sauce on the chicken before I put the cheeze on it. Also If your chicken is to thick butterfly it. Thick chicken in my opinion is no good for this recipe. I had thick chicken, and just pounded the  out of it, and I felt it was still a bit to thick. 1 1/4 inchs thick is really pushing it. I think 3/4 - 1 inch would have been perfect. If you can get the chicken down to 3/4 - 1 inch by beating it that would be better, but if you have to just butterfly it. Buy butterfly I mean slice it in half like a __________________Top of chicken
  _ _ _ _ _cut here^ so the top half flaps over.
  __________________bottom of chicken

It will look like a butterfly when you are done.

We cheated and used our favorite jarred sauce, but this was wonderful and really easy.  The hardest part was just juggling the steps.  The kids loved it, my husband enjoyed it, I loved it.  It was that nice balance between something we have frequently (spaghetti) with enough of a twist to make it different but not so different that it scared everyone off.  Highly recommend this!

This reciepe as written is over-complicated.. I skipped making pasta sauce and just bought a jar from the store.  Cut one ckn breast in half and smashed the halves. Dipped in egg/bread crumbs twice, cooked in skillet for a bit, then topped with cheese and cooked under broiler for a couple mins. Turned out great, topped with the pasta sauce and parm. EZ mode!

This was a great recipe. My husband really liked the sauce as it was simple. I used to always have a problem with my breading on my meat falling off and found the tip to put on a wire rack is super great! Thanks.

Simple and nice.  It helped that I had leftover sauce from the night before and shredded mozzarella. Added some garlic salt to the bread crumb mixture as well. Used my big skillet and placed the chicken in as it was dipped rather then placing on wire rack first.  Saved on some cleaning up. Will, absolutley  make again! I LOVE simple and tasty meals!

This was excellent the first time that I made this. The second time, I added wheat germ and ground flax seed to the bread crumbs, and the flavor was even better! I highly recommend this recipe.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion of marinating the chicken ahead of time in buttermilk (made with lowfat milk with vinegar).  Followed the cooking instructions and the results were crispy on outside, moist inside.  My kids loved this...

This was a huge hit with my family! I followed the recipe exactly, including making my own sauce, which by the way we used all of! There wasn't a drop to spare so next time I would probably double the sauce. I don't know how you are supposed to have any left for another meal! lol! It was easy to do, and so delicious!  This is a keeper!!

So good! Whole family loved it! The note says that it makes twice as much sauce as is needed, but I let it simmer while I did the chicken and it reduced and got thicker and was just enough. I doubled the oregano and basil and added a bit more sugar, as per our family's taste. Word to the wise: the breading on the chicken burns fairly easily at med-hi heat, so a medium heat would be better. I am already excited to make this again!

Very good....who doesnt love chicken parm! Doubled the recipe and used red wine instead of the sugar for the sauce. Also used whole wheat seasoned crumbs to coat the chicken. Served with whole grain angle hair pasta and a ceasar salad. Yummy Sunday dinner. Thanks.

I am only reviewing the sauce, since I used another recipe for the parmesan chicken portion. This sauce is so simple, yet tastes so good! Followed the recipe except added 3x the amount of garlic, as I am a garlicoholic!!! Great simple dish for a weeknight! The family loved it! I will NEVER buy jarred sauce again, since this is so quick to make and I always have all ingredients on hand.

This is delicious and easy. To make it even easier on myself, I buy ready made sauce. Just heat up on the stove, and pour it on the chicken and pasta.

My family loved this!  It was easy and delicious.  My son is autistic and a very picky eater.  He ate this dish without the sauce but loved the chicken.  I also didn't have time to make the homemade sauce and bought store but.  Will definetly make this meal again.  Thanks!

DELICIOUS! But I wouldn't call it "simple" at all! It's a long process, but it is definitely worth it! I added more salt to the sauce, but otherwise, I will certainly make this sauce - and probably the whole dish, when I have more time - again!

This is so good this is our second time this week making it.  The entire family (7 of us) loves it... I never thought the chicken would be completely cooked in 5 minutes but it was.  A new favorite!

I've made this two times now.  Once as is, and once with a few modifications.  It was good as the recipe was written, but could definitely use a little oomph! Sauce:  I added some red pepper flakes and doubled all the seasonings except for the sugar, then, i thickened it with a little roux. Breading:  I used Panko bread crumbs, flour, parmesan, flour, basil leaves, oregano and a little pepper.  The chicken is good enough to eat by itself!

I'm not sure what happened, but when I was frying the chicken all the breading came off.  It was still good, but I think next time I will just stick with baking in the oven.  I used mozzarella cheese instead of jack due to personal preference.

This was very good.  I made a few modifications to suit my family's taste, and it was well liked.  Thanks!

Delicious!  Made the sauce as per recipe and it was fabulous, no need to change anything.  The only thing I did differently with the chicken was that when I used regular bread crumbs, I double breaded it for a crunchier coating (and I didn't want to waste the leftover egg and crumbs!), however when I used Japanese bread crumbs I found that one coating was enough (but I needed more crumbs since they're much less fine).  Fabulous!

Yummy, I added fresh mushrooms, fresh oregano, and a splash of burg wine to deepen the sauce's flavor. A huge hit for dinner this evening. :)

As other reviewers have pointed out, this isn't the simplest recipe - but it's probably what I'll be making the next time we have people over!  I adjusted a little: petite diced instead of crushed tomatoes with an extra clove of garlic and brown sugar for the sauce, threw some shredded parm into the breadcrumbs, and a slice of light provolone on top instead of shredded mozzarella.  Tossed the leftover sauce with noodles the next day and it was even better than the first time around.  Start your pasta water first and don't wait until the sauce is done to start the chicken - give it about five minutes to get going and then start heating the frying oil.  It took me about half an hour from prep to plate doing it that way.

I cheated and used canned spaghetti sauce. I sauteed the onions and garlic in olive oil before adding to the sauce. The chicken does tend to cook fast in an electric skillet, so keep flipping. This is the closest recipe to my favorite dish served at the Olive Garden.

I would have given this 5 stars as the meal was EXCELLENT! However, I have to deduct one for false advertising... This is definitely NOT a simple recipe, nor would it be a good one for having kids help (too many icky or dangerous things like raw chicken, pan frying, and the broiler). Also on the "not so simple" recipe bent, I dirtied at least half of the dishes in the kitchen, used 3 of my 4 burners simultaneously PLUS had the broiler on too (definitely not a recipe for warm days!). I'm a very experienced cook, and it took me nearly 2 hours to make dinner! The results were absolutely worth the time and effort, and my whole family FLIPPED for it, but like I said, I have to deduct one star for false adverting. Rename the recipe and sell it on the outstanding flavor, and you'll get 5 from me!

Very good!  The sauce was especially easy and tasty.  I used the leftover the next day for a calzone and it was super, so I think I'll be using this as a pizza sauce, too.  Thanks!

This recipe is great. Instead of cooking the chicken that way, I dipped it in egg and then in bread crumbs. I then browned it on an electric frying pan. Then I put a little bit of sauce on the bottom of a pan, and then the chicken, more sauce, then mozzarella & parmesan cheese and put it in the oven!

Such an easy, but, great recipe!!!! My husband said "Now this is good eating," when he took a bite. The only thing I did different was used a bottle of the jarred sauce. I know it's prolly not 1/2 as great as homemade sauce but I was in a hurry and had a jar in the cabinet, lol.

This was awesome! I didn't know an exact time I could serve dinner due to our schedule so instead of broiling this, I put it in a baking dish, covered it with the sauce and baked it @ 300 degrees for an hour. When serving it I put thin spaghetti on the plate and put one breast with sauce on top. It was so tender and the flavors baked in. My family loved it!

I thought this was great as did husband and two of the kids.  The other two kids did not like it.  We used jarred sauce for convenience.  I followed the instructions otherwise except for: (1) marinated the chicken first in buttermilk (2) After sauteeing step, I skipped the wire rack step and just put it in a greased baking dish in a 450 oven for 5 minutes and (3) my way to get the chicken thin enough was to slice it when it was still partly frozen - it was very easy to slice 1/2" thick or less when still half frozen.  I found that to be much easier than pounding it or than butterflying it when thawed.

Wow my family LOVED this recipe! When me and my mom find a recipe we all agree on (My mom, dad, brother, and I) we add it to the short list of a whole family pleasers, instead of me and my brother have chicken tenders and mom and dad having bean soup. This is going right onto the list! I cheated and used Creamy Vodka sauce (Its amazing, you gotta try it!). Everyone ate until they were stuffed. Next time i'll be using a new brand of bread crumbs... I didn't like them so much. Thanks for the AMAZING recipe :)!

First I pounded the breasts to make them thinner. (I used a rolling pin and had the chicken between two sheets of wax paper).  Then I dredged the chicken in seasoned flour, then in the egg and then in the seasoned bread crumbs. I also topped it with Prego because I was lazy. This also re-heated very well.

I thought the breading sounded dull so I added extra seasonings (fresh basil, garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes. The chicken stays tender. Make sure to sautee them on low.

Not bad, but not the best I've ever had. Followed the recipe exactly. Neither hubby or any of the three kids commented positively or negatively. In my book, that means I'll keep looking for another Chicken Parm recipe until I find the one with the "wow" factor.

I made this last night and it was absolutely delicious!!! I didn't make the sauce recipe, but used Emeril's marinara sauce in the jar. The chicken was so moist and flavorful! I will definitely be making this recipe again soon!

This recipe turned out delicious. I did, however, borrow a couple of things from tomato chicken parmesan recipe (also on this sight).  I used 3 chicken cutlets. I put some pepper, adobo, and 1/3 parmesan cheese in my bread crumbs. You can totally taste the cheese!  So good!!  Also seasoned my chicken a little before rolling in bread crumbs, placed chicken in fridge so crumbs wld stick as per suggestion. After cooking cutlets, put it in oven to broil for 7-8 min after topping with sauce and mozzerella cheese. Served with salad and spaghetti.  Sooo Good!!!!!!

Excellent.  I added red pepper flakes & extra garlic to the sauce, and red pepper flakes to the bread crumb mixture.  Also used shredded mozzarella & Parmesan, rather than grated.

I thought this was great!  I just used Italian style tomatoes and added a little more Italian seasoning to save time.

Sauteing and broiling makes the chicken crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.

This is a keeper!  The sauce is wonderful and I will use it in other recipes as well.  The chicken turned out great, but next time I will put some sauce on the chicken before the cheese.  Served with sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers - YUM!

This was a very easy, very tasty recipe.  I think the next time I make this I'll definitely add some parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.  I did cheat and use store bought sauce.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Great basic chicken parm recipe! My only suggestion: use  San Marzano tomatoes and eliminate the sugar - they are sweet enough as they are. Imported from Italy and easy to find in most groceries. I use Cento brand.

This really was super simple! I've never made chicken parmesan before outside of having it at a restaurant and was very surprised at how good this was.
I was missing dried basil however so I used some Italian Seasoning for the tomato sauce which worked great!

I pretty much followed the recipe, I used fresh, frozen tomatoes instead of canned, but the spices really gave the sauce a great flavor.  I used chicken thighs because that's what I had available, the next time I will try it with chicken breast.  Overall a very good Chicken Parmesan dish.  There was extra sauce, which we used for spaghetti.

The preparation method for the chicken has been a game-changer for us! I use store-bought sauce, but really like the way the chicken is pan-fried then broiled with cheeses - it keeps it the exact right combo of juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I use garlic herb bread crumbs, otherwise the bread crumb coating is a little bland. Thanks for a regular addition to our rotation!

First time making it. It was a little tough to get the breadcrumbs to stick but maybe that’s because I didn’t use flour. Will try flour next time.  Family loved it tho!

It was ok.  Very labor intensive!  My clean up crew (my husband) asked that I refrain from using the wire rack, especially in the oven on Broil.  Using the rack twice contributed to a lot of clean up.  I added the crushed garlic to both the sauce and the olive oil sauté of the chicken.  Can’t have enough garlic! I used Marinara for the sauce and added the recommended spices.  I believe baking the chicken instead of sautéing in a pan and broiling would produce a better result.  That said, I tried it and learned a lot!  Thank you.

I cut the recipe in half, except for the sauce, since I was only making it for me. It turned out well, but not perfect. I love the taste of the marinara sauce, but it's very watery. I plan to add tomato paste to it while keeping the same flavor. I also want to make it without the breading, to cut the carbs, because I'm diabetic.

I followed this recipe (almost) to the letter, unusual for me. About the only changes I made were that I added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the marinara sauce to give it a little heat, and I left out the sugar because I don't like extra sweetness in savory dishes, and the crushed tomatoes I used were sweet enough on their own. Since I'm a beginning/intermediate cook, I particularly liked the little hints such as putting the breaded chicken cutlets on a rack to help the bread crumbs stay put. 
In any case my strictest critic (wife) said it was delicious, and that's all that matters :).  I'll definitely make it again.
I've posted a picture, which also includes a "zoodle" (zucchini noodle) warm salad that I got from another source.

This was sooooo delicious. Of course I seasoned my meat with extra seasoning,  and let refrigerate  for at least 7 hours then i cooked my meat. The chicken breast was sooo juicy and tender.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The only mistake I made was broiling the chicken for too long on high (5 min).  Next time I will keep an eye on it.  Really tasty.

I made it according to the recipe and I wasn't too happy with the results.   I probably won't make it again for awhile.

This is the 2nd time making this.  It is a new family favorite. The changes I made:  Sautéed breaded chicken in butter and I made the sauce with hot sausage, garlic,  and herbs from my garden.  I served over zucchini zoodles. So very good.

Added Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs.  I also used tomato sauce with diced tomatoes for the sauce.  My husband LOVED this dish.

It was good but could have been better, especially with all of the steps involved. I would increase the amount of mozzarella cheese on the chicken and season the tomato sauce with more salt, garlic and onion powder, and double the basil.

Excellent recipe. Best I have tried for this dish. So often on AR the posted recipe is bare-bones and you have to read the reviews to get the technique. So I really appreciate the OP giving directions and timing. It's not complex. It's through. SO I followed the directions exactly- only change was seasoning the bread crumbs. It's really important to pound the chicken flat and let the breaded breasts rest on the rack for a few minutes. The breading actually stayed on during frying (for once) and cooked evenly. Don't mess w the chicken. Only turn it once. Line your baking sheet w foil. I placed the chicken directly from the frying pan into the clean rack- drained fine- then broiled as directed. Chicken came out juicy and nice and crispy- not at all soggy, which is my biggest complaint w chic parm. My whole family, including grandma and a picky 4 yr old, loved this. (Kids say it was "delicious"). My husband's only complaint was "babe, you didn't make enough chicken!" (LOL There IS a small amount of leftovers, but next time I will increase it so we get 2 full meals out of it. It was that good.) I served this w EZ Drop Biscuits from AR. Thanks for a "keeper"!!

This meal came out great. The whole family was pleased! I did add extra seasonings to the sauce, such as onion powder, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. I used Italian  bread crumbs for extra flavor instead of plain with the chicken. It was sort of a messy meal to make, but I enjoyed making it. I have added this to my favorites and I will be making it again down the road.

A good, basic chicken parmesan recipe. I prefer to use Italian style bread crumbs, and add either some Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino cheese to the bread crumbs, along with a bit of garlic powder, just to pump up the flavor a bit. It's true, though, that kids never complain when chicken parm  is served - which is a huge plus in our home.

This was my first attempt at Chicken Parmesan. The note is right, there are a lot of steps but definitely some good flavor in this recipe. I think I needed to use thinner chicken breasts because it took a while to cook it thru and the coating was starting to get too dark. Will try this again with pre-butchered thin breasts. I actually use the tomato sauce recipe just as-is over pasta. I think it's delicious and it's super easy to make!

This was fabulous. I only had sauce on-hand, which was perfectly fine, and ended up eyeballing the seasoning, as the recipe goes a little light in that regard. My husband and I have been traumatized by a bad chicken parm recipe to the point we haven't made it in a number of years. I decided to go for it tonight and he absolutely raved over it, and I thought it was excellent myself. Miracle of miracles - our faith in a chicken Parmesan recipe has been restored!

Felt like it lacked flavor. I think if you add seasoning to the chicken it might make it more flavorful. Just an opinion it looks great though!

Great recipe and love how simple it is!!Hate to be one of those people who changes the recipe, however, I used Italian seasoned Panko crumbs on my chicken which gave it a nice crunch that regular bread crumbs can't do. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was fabulous. My kids devoured it and were wondering where the leftovers were the next day....I told them there weren't any because they ate it all. :). Great recipe and so simple!!!

It was good! I left the chicken whole which might have been a mistake and I used too much olive oil for frying! I think I prefer an oven baked version of this recipe which I'm gonna try next time.

Food came out great, although I feel like the directions are a little confusing for those less experienced in the kitchen. FYI: Heat the oil on medium and wait til after you coat the chicken to do so if your not hot oil savvy.  Just a small plug!

Absolutely wonderful! This was my first time making chicken parm, and i am not that great in the kitchen (but im learning) and i completed this with ease! It was a little scary cooking the chicken with the oil spitting, however it all came out wonderfully. The sauce tasted amazing, as did the chicken. It has now been deemed a household favorite in my home :)

A very good recipe to start with. After using this recipe a couple of times I did make a few changes; Such as prepared spaghetti sauce and I will use any type of cheese that I have on hand.

We love this recipe.  I filet the breasts so they are thin - we like them crispier.  I also use jarred marinara and then spice it up myself.

Delicious. I also soaked my chicken breasts in buttermilk and spices overnight and used panko. Didn't bother with the noodles, the chicken is so filling on its own.

This is a fairly easy recipe and has wonderful results. Make sure to absolutely use crushed tomatoes and not diced or anything else so that the marinara's consistentcy turns out well. Also, I dont use plain bread crumbs either; I use seasoned stuffing that I crushed up with a bowl and plate. Other than that, I made no changes and everyone loved it.

I am giving it a 5 star before I even try it...I am going to try this recipe tonight! I love panko crumbs because I like the crunch.  I also have some frozen homemade hot italian sausage spaghetti sauce so I can't wait to try that on top!

This Parm was great!  I pounded the chicken and breaded it in egg and bread crumbs, then pan fried and transferred to a wire rack over a cookie sheet, topped each with cheese and baked at 350 for about 15 minutes (only because the broil setting on my oven sets off my smoke detector!)  I used jarred sauce because it's what was on hand.
I served it with spaghetti squash topped with the same store-bought sauce and more cheese.
My boyfriend raved, which is rare!

Excellent recipe. The sauce was awesome and the chicken very moist and tender. Delicious! Hubby says it is a keeper. Will make it often.

This dish was delicious and easy.  My family loved it.  The only change Ii made was to add fresh herbs to the sauce as it was simmering and I also added some fresh herbs to the breadcrumbs.  I will be making this dish often.

My sauce didn't taste good, hence the 3 star rating. I used Hunts tomatoes, so that may have been the "problem" with the taste (author says tomato quality varies by brand). The chicken was very tender (I used cutlets so I didn't have to pound them; they cooked quickly). If the chicken were separate from the rest of the recipe, I would've given 4 stars. Next time I'll use my favorite jar sauce.

Very Good Recipe! I paired it with alfredo sauce over linguine and it was delish! This will be a family favorite! **If you have a electric stove the chicken cooks better on med temp.

Very good and easy! I burned the cheese a little bit, but still tasted good. I also used diced tomatoes instead of crushed since that I what I had on hand. The sauce wasn't very thick, so I'll try it again with crushed. Thanks!

I made this recipe tonight.  I had to doctor the sauce a bit - it was too tomato-y for me.  I added onion powder (you could also saute onions with the garlic), more oregano, garlic powder (or just saute more garlic), more basil, more sugar, 6oz. tomato paste and 8 oz. tomato sauce.  While I don't think this recipe was particularly difficult, its definitely not "simple".  I was able to get dinner prepared in about 45 minutes and it did dirty a lot of dishes.  It tasted great - I would definitely make us again!

This is SO easy -- but not at all "simple" IMO.  There are just too many steps.
Not a knock to the recipe -- just to the title!  LOL!
I've made this about 4 times, and it's been fabulous every time.  The sauce is good -- but I always add a bit more spices now.  Also, I HAVE noticed that the higher quality tomatoes taste better.  I think my favorite is the Organic Hunts Crushed tomatoes.
My favorite is using Italian Bread crumbs.  That adds a bit more depth to the flavor.  Be absolutely sure to pound your chicken.  Nothing worse than undercooked white meat.

The flavor was okay.  A bit bland, but still very good.  I made this for a dinner party I had.  I wouldn't exactly call this recipe "simple" but it's okay.  The sauce turned out pretty good...I had to add a good 1/4 cup of brown sugar because it's pretty tart without it.  Next time I make it, I will probably buy thin sliced chicken breasts.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit--yeah! I added some evaporated milk to the egg. I dipped chicken into breadcrumbs, then into the milk/egg mixture, and back into breadcrumbs. This gives it a nice coating that doesn't come off during cooking. My husband loved the sauce, but the kids and I prefer a bit sweeter sauce. Next time I plan to tweek the sauce a little :) I served this with angel hair pasta. Thanks for sharing!

delicious! I only used a pinch of sugar in the sauce as I don't like sauces sweet.  I also added diced tomatoes for a slightly chunkier sauce.  Added garlic powder to breadcrumb mix as well.  One of my boyfriends favorite recipes I have made!

I have a brother who HATES spaghetti bolgnaise... so i knew it was a risk when i decided to cook this! But... not only did he eat it but he asked for more...i did not change anything in the recipe other than using fresh herbs rather than dried. It was fantastic! This will be made again and again in our house:)

I made this for my husband, who really likes Chicken Parm. We liked the flavor of everything; he thinks that it doesn't need to be served with noodles - just the chicken and a nice side salad. Also, he said he'd rather just have canned sauce, since it doesn't have the "chunks" of crushed tomatoes. I really liked the flavor of this sauce though. All in all, we'll probably have this again.

This recipe is so yummy!  I used Progresso Italian Style bread crumbs on the chicken and an additional clove of garlic for the sauce.  The overall flavor was great! A+
