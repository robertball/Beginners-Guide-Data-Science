Tried this recipe at a family reunion.  It was a hit.  It was the first dessert gone.  Simple and easy, now that's my kind of cooking.  You probably have all the ingredients on hand. 
GO FOR IT!!!!

I tried this recipe on my girlfriends at our monthly card game. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  One friends son e-mailed me and said this was a must have for his mom.

I just have one suggestion....make sure you add 2 boxes of pudding mix!! I thought that one box is more than enough because the pie crust looked shallow...but I was wrong! I had to compensate by adding more whipped topping and it came out very sweet and runny, it didn't hold it's shape at all! Otherwise, it still tasted great and my roommates didn't complain!

Too sweet. Might uses less candy next time. Was okay though.

Two of the three of us liked it a lot - I was on the cusp - I insisted we use 'cooked' pudding versus instant and that may be part of the problem. It just really didn't do much for me. I think 'if' we try it again we will use choc pudding instead of vanilla - and maybe a different candy bar - or more pieces or something. It was a dessert but not hugely special - doesn't hold together well nor get better overnight.

I really didn't think this pie was that great.  I love chocolate, and I still thought this was way too sweet. I used even less kit-kat bars than the recipe called for and I still didn't like it. Good recipe if you really are pressed for time, i guess.

This was a very good and easy recipe.  I had my students make it for a Thanksgiving Lunch and it was a big hit.  We made 2 pies.  One with KitKat bars and one with Reese Sticks.

This is a nice recipe if you are in a hurry, but it's not a favorite.

DEEElicious and so easy! My boyfriend did not believe I had just made it after I brought the dinner dishes into the kitchen & came back out with it! I used lite whipped toping to cut down on fat & it worked perfectly fine. YUM! Thank you!

This recipe was very good, but on the rich side.  People either loved it or hated it.  MY husband who likes chocolate more than I do raved about it.  Definently will make this again.

This is an excellent recipe!  My husband said this was the best pie I've ever made!  I'll be making this one again for sure!
