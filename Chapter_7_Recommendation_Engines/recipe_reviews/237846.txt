Another winner from Chef John! This soup is easy and delicious. But just as important is the detailed nutrition information. I urge you to check it out. My husband is a diabetic so the carb count is very important. With 9g of carb and 4g of fiber this soup totals only 5 carb grams. (Every g of fiber reduces the carbs by 1 g). And it's packed with vitamins and minerals. This soup is a real bang for your nutrition buck. It tastes like it has cream in it, but it doesn't, so you can freeze this. I made this exactly as written except I didn't have the nasturtium for the garnish. Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe is really easy and delicious. It is surprisingly comforting with very few calories. I used shallots in addition to the garlic per the Cook's notes. There was some fibrous material but I think that's unavoidable unless you strain the soup. It didn't bother me.

Delicious - cauliflower and asparagus flavors go great together. I used veg broth instead of chic. I also cooked down some onion and shallot before adding garlic, because I always like onion in my blended soups. I would recommend adding asparagus after only 10 minutes (rather than 15), because it needs a while to cook. I did add a bit of cream cheese after blending, but only b/c I had some I needed to use up - soup would be just as good without it. Not sure where to get the nasturtiums, but I would try to find them if I wanted a nice presentation.

Oh Chef John, How I love your recipes.  I was looking for a few green soups that were puree, creamy, yet dairy free.  This was more than a hit, it was a home run.  I was too lazy to pick up the flowers at the gourmet food store, but otherwise followed this recipe to a tee.  Perfection!  Even my husband, who is not a fan of cauliflower or asparagus could not get enough.  Thanks again!

This is one of the best soups I have ever had. I didn't have any nasturtiums but I chopped up the asparagus tips I had saved and put them on top of the soup. It was so good! Thank you for this recips. I will use it again and again:

This soup is delicious!  It  was great because I had some cauliflower I needed to use up.  I did sauté some onion in with the garlic and I only had a little more than 1 lb. of asparagus so only used 4 cups of chicken broth.  I put mine in a blender to get a smooth texture.  It was so easy and the cayenne gives it a little kick.

Oh yummy! Low calorie, low carbohydrate and low fat but still delicious, filling and satisfying. I didn't have the nasturtium leaves on hand  (ha ha) so I used the asparagus tips and some small diced red pepper for garnish. Looked lovely when I served it. Thank you for sharing the recipe...I'll be making it often.

As others have said, this is a surprisingly satisfying soup and simple to prepare.  I used white pepper and I garnished with sliced green onions, but I think Chef John's garnish is much better.  The green onions actually took away from the soup in my opinion.  I wish I had read the Cook's notes on this before I started, as I would probably have added a chopped onion to the saute.  I almost did anyway.

I was a little skeptical about this soup, but it turned out wonderfully. Chef John never steers me wrong. I accidentally used to much broth so I allowed it to simmer on low for a little while so it could reduce. Worked like a charm.  The cayenne pepper is a great addition.  
This is also a great recipe to modify to personal tastes (I added onion and a little Aleppo chili).  Will absolutely make this again.

One of the nicest soup recipes I have tried in a long time. Check out the nutritional value and the Low Low caloric count. My husband loved it too. The only differences I made was that I doubled the garlic cloves, but I frequently do that.
I also added 2 more cups of chicken broth. Chef John suggested that one does not do this, but I did after i had started pureeing the soup. I liked this texture better. Anyway,you must try it. Superb!!!

Just what I was looking for. A creamy vegetable soup without the calories. Satisfyingly thick  without  the addition of cream and so yummy. I’m about to make my second batch.

I added half a small onion, plus I used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. Also used one-fourth tsp of cayenne pepper.  I only used one- eighth of tsp of salt.

Delicious. I omitted the flowers and asparagus tips garnish because I made this to take to work for lunch. I normally eat in my car, so this needs to be drinkable out of a mug. I think I put a whole teaspoon of cayenne because I didn't realize how hot it is. Don't do that. It's still good, just too spicy that way. I always swap out the olive oil for avacado oil because I hate the taste of olive oil, and if you ask me, it's a great way to ruin a dish. Overall a super healthy and fast, simple, tasty soup that I'll be making regularly!

Soothing and filling.  No dairy is a big plus.  It is hard to find a creamy soup without dairy

Amazingly good and creamy, especially for being so good for you.  I used my high-powered blender and it came out very smooth and velvety.

I did put Italian seasoning it. No flower but will try to add it next time also carrots I think. Overall this is a fantastic dish may just need a little seasoning. ??

Absolutely FANTASTIC.  5 + stars.  I didn't think it would be so 'creamy' but it was.  I used vegetable broth and garnished with asparagus tips and sliced hard boiled eggs.  I used the same recipe with broccoli with approx 2 parts broccoli to 1 part cauliflower.  This was just as wonderful.

I loved this soup.  I left out the flowers and added finely diced red bell pepper for color instead.  I also added one diced brown onion that was sauteed before the garlic was added.  Lastly, I made a mistake and added too much cayenne so I added a dollop of sour cream on top.  However, even without technically following instructions, it still was terrific.  Thanks Chef John.  Lunch for a week!

Very yummy.  Asparagus was $1.47 at the supermarket so I gave this a try.  Per the cook's note, I added some diced onion.  I made a couple of minor changes.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and I added about a teaspoon of sugar.

As always, Chef John's recipes are always a winner.  This soup tasted delicious and was healthy to boot!  I'm a vegetarian, so I substituted with vegetable broth instead.  So easy to make!  Thanks, Chef John!

So easy and so good!   I didn't garnish the soup, but followed the recipe (I don't measure - so not sure if I got exactly 6 cups of bone broth, etc.).   I used about a t. of cayenne and I think that was too much - my husband's head was sweating.   But he loved it and I'll make it again!   Couldn't believe how creamy it was without adding heavy cream - or any dairy for that matter.   Thanks for a great recipe!

I omitted the cayenne and nasturtium ,and used Lowery's Seasoning Salt to taste.
Also added about ¼ cup of Orzo to soup with the cauliflower to make it creamier.
I blended got it to tiny bead sized vegetables in the soup.
Did not garnish.
Delicious taste of the cauliflower and asparagas came through.

The only thing I left out were the petals, but who needs 'em?!  Absolutely delicious, however, do NOT overcook your asparagus or you'll be picking strings out of your teeth.  Just enough spice, very creamy.

With my husband being on a low cholesterol and gout diet he has not been able to have any  of his beloved creamed soups and then tonight I came upon this recipe and tried it out for myself while he was at work and gotta say I am impressed and know he will to really enjoy this. I didn't use chicken broth so used a low sodium vegetable broth and added our own Himalayan salt and upped the amount of garlic and I also didn't have any nasturtium petals. I didn't see the Chef's notes until after I had already cooked it but next time will be incorporating the onion.

Very good! I halved it.  I used half pound asparagus-it was headed south-and a whole califlour head. No cayenne but added a blop of sour cream and a pinch of crushed red pepper on serving.   Served with pita chips and fruit.  Very filling!  Oh and tried immersion blender but ended up pouring in the standard blender, easier to me.  Comes out more even texture.

Added shredded carrots to the asparagus &  cauliflower; all Veges were cooked and puréed. Heavy cream was a great addition!!  It made the soup rich & smooth. FYI: Add heavy cream to the purée at the end.  Also, per other reader recommendations, I added sautéed chopped onion, lemon zest (dried) and white pepper (to taste). Warning: ONLY add a pinch of cayenne or your soup will be ruined!

I diced some red onions and cooked them in olive oil with the garlic. I also used water instead of any vegetable broth or chicken broth. I added dashes of cayenne pepper to spice it up and sea salt for flavor. I even added garlic salt to try to give it more taste after it still seemed to be missing something. It wasn't until I tried sprinkling rice noodles on top of the soup that it actually tasted better.

This was yummy! I made it for a main course, so I used homemade shrimp stock instead of chicken and added roasted shrimp and frico crisps prior to serving.

We had this soup with Chef John's Beer Batter Bread.  It would be very good as a first course, but is not hearty enough for a meal.  It was easy and tasty.  We didn't have nasturtium -- but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.

This was ok for me, it tasted better the next day like most soups do. I sauteed  1/4 of an onion with the garlic. After tasting the finished product, I added some lemon zest and some non-dairy yogurt for more flavor. I'm glad I halved the recipe-it makes a lot of soup.
