This was a quick and easy meal, however I recommend not cooking for longer than time requested. It became a bit mushy because I cooked all day on low while at work.

When made as directed, this recipe is awful - came out as fish-flavored starchy mush.  It's also huge, so be prepared to have massive quantities of leftovers that no one wants.  The saving grace was that I decided to fry a patty of the leftover mush in some olive oil with garlic and sage and top it with tabasco sauce, pepperjack cheese, and an overeasy egg.  That was decent.  Planning to deep-fry the remainder - its very dough-like and could be shaped around pickles or mushrooms perhaps.  Saw that someone tried it with fresh salmon, I would recommend giving that a shot since the mushiness seemed more like the canned salmon just disintegrated into the rice.

You have to cook it twice as long as the receipe calls for. At the 3hr mark the rice was still hard so we cooked on high for another 2hrs and now it actually taste good and the rice is done. I didn't eat it until the next day but hubby ate that night and likeday it.

I followed the exact recipe including Basmati rice.  The rice was not cooked (crunchy inside, mushy on outside) after 3 hours as recipe requires.  The amount of salmon?  We had to hunt to find it amongst all the rice and peas.  Sorry for the bad review, but that said, I will not make this dish again.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because the flavor was good, but the instructions were bad. I followed them to the "T" and ended up cooking it almost twice as long and my rice was half soggy and half crunchy still.
