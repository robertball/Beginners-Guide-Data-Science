The recipe is quick and good.  I suggest boiling the diced potatoes in a pot while you saute the onions.  That way all the vegetables are cooked and just need to be seasoned with the onions.  Plus you can use some of the reserved water from the potatoes in the mixture instead of the plain water to keep from sticking.

We love Indian food, particularly the vegetarian dishes.  Unfortunately, this recipe fell short.  We found it completely bland.  However, we managed to save the dish by adding 1/4 cup of salsa, a pat of butter, extra salt & black pepper to it.  We didn't have any in our pantry, but I assume canned tomatoes would've worked just as well as the salsa.

If you're a curry fan, you're probably going to find this bland. I upped the spices called for but also browned some cumin seeds in the hot oil before adding the onion. I also added some Madras curry powder for heat/flavor. I made this with leftover peas and baked potato from last night's dinner, and used steamed cauliflower instead of carrots (I LOVE curried cauli). I rolled it up in a paratha with a drizzle of garlic chutney. Nice lunch. Thanks!

This was a great accompinament to my favorite Indian Chicken Curry and basmati rice dinner. The spices were just right and did not overpower my main dish at all. This dish would also stand alone as a great Indian Vegetarian Entree!

We cooked this for 45 minutes and the potatoes never cooked all the way through.  Like others have said, the spices were okay, but it needed a little more something.  Maybe boil the diced potatoes in chicken stock first to cook them and add extra flavor at the same time?  It would also add moistness, which would be a good thing since this was a little too dry for my taste.  We'll keep working on this one.

This mild dish was great for my family, because I love Indian food, but my kids don't.  I did add a little bit of butter mid-way through cooking to help with the tendency to stick to the pan.  This was mild enough for them to eat, and I just doctored mine with Sriracha chili sauce to spice it up more to my liking.  I'll probably do this again and tinker with variations of the blend of spices, because I really would like it to be a little more flavorful, but it was a very fine start, and a simple recipe to make.

Good, but next time I make it I will add more chili powder and some diced chiles to give it a bit more kick.

I thought this was a little bland, but my husband loved it!  He added hot sauce to it  as well, so that may have influenced his taste.

Nice flavor but a bit bland. It needed more salt. All I could taste was frozen peas though even though my veggies were a good mix of potatoes, carrots, and peas. This went well with spiced rice and an indian style meatball in an onion raisin sauce. I'd fix it again adding a little more spice or something to it as it was okay but needed a little doctoring to make it better.

Thanks MTORRES3.  Quick and Easy!  I halved it. This goes great with a plain baked chicken or turkey.  Cook this to add something to spice up the a normal plain meal.   Increase/decrease the spice to match your families taste.  I served this to my wife and guests they all loved it.

Good and not too powerful of flavor.  I was afraid the chili powder was going to be too much so I added half first but by the end of the dish, I ended up adding more than the 1 tsp. called for.  It does need a bit more something but I could not figure out what since I do not usually cook with Indian flavors.  My husband and I did like this.

Great receipe.  I made it to go with baked chicken wings and it was a big hit. Unfortunately I didn't have any carrots in the house so I substituted frozen corn. It actually worked well.  Everyone who ate it wanted to know how I found this receipe.  Thanks for sharing with us.

Easy dish to make, and was a lifesaver because it turned the final ingredients left in my fridge into a healthy, filling dish. Like other commenters suggested, it was missing some flavor for my personal taste (raised with a middle eastern palate). These were my modifications:

-I boiled the potatoes while the onions were frying.
-For the spices, I additionally threw in a teaspoon of cinnamon, black pepper and cayenne to taste, and more chili powder and salt to taste.
-I added 3 cloves of minced garlic after frying the onions.
-Once all the veggies were in (peas, carrots, potatoes, and spinach for the heck of it), I substituted 1/2 cup vegetable broth for water, threw in some leftover arrabbiata sauce (about 4 tablespoons; tomato paste probably would have worked, too), and about a tablespoon of butter. Turned out delicious, and saved me and my boyfriend from hunger before our next grocery shopping trip.

Like others said, this was a little bland.  I added some curry, extra coriander, white pepper and a dash of garlic Tabasco for a kick.  It came out great! The perfect side for my spicy Indian grilled chicken. I will definitely make this again!

I prepares this last night.  I changed a couple of things: I used 4 red potatoes and 3.5 T of oil.  Also, I used canned pea/carrot, and the carrots tore apart, but it still looked good and tasted great.  thanks!

i made this to complement the honey/mustard curry chicken. it was pretty good. i wanted it to be more creamy, so while it was cooking, i added some milk, water, flour and butter. i put majorim, coriander, chile powder, a little curry powder, cumin, garlic powder - since one review warned it would be bland. the flour and water helped thicken it, and i added some cheese (cheddar, italian cheeses) in the final phase. it took so long for the potatoes to cook, that i eventually dumped all the stuff from the skillet into a pot, covered it and cooked it for another ten minutes. thats the only way i could get the potatoes to soften up! the vvegetables ended up being really good, but i had to do a lot of things to alter the recipe to make it that way. i would make it again - my way.

Delicious and simple.  Served with baked"Tanoor style" chicken it was a wonderful dinner.  I used chicken stock to loosen the vegetables a bit---needed close to 1/2 cup and everything was nice and tender.  I make a lot of Indian food, but I will admit this was a little bland.  I'm going to take some blame for that and replace my spices (which are quite old).  I will try the dish with fresh spices and see if that livens it up a bit.

I used a 1.5 lb. bag of  fingerling potatoes, cutting larger fingerlings into fourths, and it worked fine.  The potatoes were completely cooked in about 20 minutes.  Delicious and full of flavor.

Recipe is easy to prepare and very good.  I did a taste test while cooking and added more of the spices (all of them).  Cook the potatoes first before adding.  My family enjoyed this over rice.

Fantastic! I noticed the comments about the potatoes not cooking so I cut them a pretty small and cooked them for a while before adding the other veggies. It worked out perfectly. This is one dish I would expect to see at a restaurant and I was very impressed with how it turned out!

This dish was quick and easy to make. Great for walking away and doing other things while it cooks. I've cooked it twice, once with Lima beans since I didn't have any peas and the second tims time with peas. I prefer the Lima beans. I served it over tahdig rice.

Easy and good recipe.

a couple of notes.

not remotely spicy...1 on a scale of 1 to 10.  maybe the chili powder is the variable?

I'm not sure why the recipe calls for "chili powder" and not curry powder but curry is more "authentically" an Indian spice.  You can also add a little ginger and that adds another dimension as well.

Bland and a little boring.  I should have waited to add peas at the end since they go puce colored and over cooked.  Spices are a tad boring.

Enjoyed this simple recipe as a side dish. Added chicken broth to moisten, and the second time I made it I upped the spices by 50% a definite Improvement!

Try using 1.5 Tbsp of Curry seasoning mix (I like Trader Joe's best) instead of measuring out the individual spices - and butter instead of oil - very good stuff :)

Wonderfully delicate and simple recipe with a nice balance of savory and sweet. I do not agree with the other reviews about this being bland. However, I do think that the recipe needs a point of clarification and one alteration. The chili powder referred to in the recipe should be Indian chili powder and not American. BIG difference as far as spice level is concerned. Indian chili powder most closely resembles cayenne pepper if you you don't have any.  My alteration was adding a lot more water- After adding the veggies and coating with the spice sauté I filled the pot with water until it was about an inch below the top of the veggies. Then after the potatoes were cooked I smashed about half of them with a wooden spoon to create a thick velvety consistency to the dish. Soo yummy!

5 stars with the changes I made.  I added about 1/3 more of all the spices and an unmeasured amount of salt to taste... maybe an extra 1/3-1/2 teaspoon.  We don't eat a lot of Indian food (will be trying more)... and everyone loved it, including children.  Thanks for a wonderful and easy recipe.

By the way my potato dice was about 1/3" square and it cooked in the allotted time perfectly.  Next time I will decrease potatoes and use more peas and carrots for more color and nutrition.  : )

My rating is with additions, mostly incidental and because I had them.  Included Anaheim chili pepper, diced, three raw carrots, sliced, more cumin and turmeric, some cabbage, plus a little Tabasco and some Louisiana "dressing" with the second and third bowl.  That is a little like boudin sausage, for what it is worth.  I put the carrots in the pan, followed by the chopped onion and added diced red potatoes and one white potato with skins on right afterward, followed by the chili pepper.  Cooked about 25 minutes and proceeded to wonder about the reviews about the potatoes not cooking.  This is great, readily modified and pretty close to what I got used to while living there.  Potato cube size didn't seem to be important. Frozen peas cooked separately and added at the end.  Cabbage was added because it seemed a bit dry, and the cabbage was there.  Great thing about these recipes:  like a good pair of boots, they will take you anywhere you want to go.

So easy and so yummy.
I followed the tip to slightly cook the potatoes before adding to the rest of the ingredients and it was indeed a good thing to do.

This was a pretty good dish for our family. I enjoy Indian food and my wife and daughter are much more picky. It was easy to make and tasted well--as noted in other reviews, take the time to cook the potatoes all the way through. It was a bit longer than what the recipe called for, but my potato cuts might have been a bit larger than suggested.

I made this the other night and it was good. But we don't like anything spicy so I altered the spices to onions and garlic and seasoning such as that. The peas and carrots and potatoes blend so well together.

This was disappointing. It had hardly any flavor. I had to add a lot of garam masala and some Goya Sazon seasoning to make it have flavor, and even then it was bland. Also, i accidentally burnt it a bit, but it didnt taste very bad from that. Had a very good taste with cucumber raita. I will make this again, because it seems like it has a lot of potential to be a good recipe.It kinda tasted like home fries.....
