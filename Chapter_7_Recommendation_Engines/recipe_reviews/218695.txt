I made these this morning and they are FANTASTIC! I baked half, turning part way through to get some colour on each side. With the other half, I deep fried. Needless to say, they taste best fried, but are great baked as well. I dunked the warm doughnuts into the glaze, placed them onto a wire rack, then sprinkled a cinnamon-sugar mix on top. Also, I don't buy the packages of yeast; 1 package of yeast is equal to 2 1/4 teaspoons from a jar of quick rise yeast. Yum! Will definitely make these again!

I only used this recipe for the doughnut, not the apple cider glaze, but the doughnut was wonderful! The texture was very soft, a bit stretchy, and oh so good. I would love to make them again with a variety of different glaze flavors.

These are amazing!  The recipe is easy to follow and I followed it exactly. This is my first time making doughnuts and everything was so easy.  My 3-year old helped me knead the dough which is very easy to work with.  He also helped roll it out and cut out the doughnuts.  I used a deep fryer which I set to the exact temperature.  I dipped the doughnuts in the apple cider mix before setting them onto a wire rack.  My son absolutely inhaled his and half of mine!  Excellent, Excellent.  THANKS!  Will be making these again!

These are the most amazing light weight doughnuts!  Grumpy said they were the best doughnuts I have ever made :0)  I got about 2 dozen doughnuts and ran out of glaze before I was done so I mixed a tablespoon of butter with 1/2 cup powdered sugar and about 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup and frosted the last 6.  YUMMY!  Definite keeper.

These were good and I even used the apple cider glaze but I don't think I let the apple cider reduce long enough so the glaze never dried. I used them in my donut hole baker and they came out good. Thanks for the recipe

After I made these once, my kids keep asking for them.  The neighbors kids are asking too! I used my daughters cake pop maker and made munchkins - definitely a keeper!  I tossed them in a bag full of cinnamon and sugar instead of the glaze the second time around.... excellent

My daughter and I made these together with no changes, except that we rolled the holes in cinnamon-sugar. These were awesome and all the girls at our Halloween sleepover loved these for breakfast in the morning.
This will become one of our regular donut recipes.

These were really easy to make. They came out really good! The glaze was very sweet. My kids loved them as well and would like me to make them every Sunday. I will be asking for a doughnut cutter for Christmas so I can make these again. :) Thank you for a great recipe!!!

Instead of cinnamon,  I  used apple spice. They turned  out good! Maybe  I'll  add a tad bit more of sugar for my tasting and some fresh  Granny Smith apples....yum!

Nice, easy recipe. More like expected when I doubled the sugar. I used a hot apple cider drink packet and a little water, and the cider flavor in the frosting  was much bolder than a reduction, although you could do both. I also had to reduce the flour a bit so keep an eye on that.

The donuts vey good, but clean up wasn't. What a mess ;-)). I cooked the glaze down for quite a while but I guess not long enough; it was very thin so I "double dunked" them.  Still not very Apple Cider tasting.  I might try making them as baked as others suggested and without the glaze.  Skimming off a few calories couldn't be a bad idea.

These are absolutely fantastic!  I got 20 donuts from the recipe, using a 3-inch drinking glass as a cutter and a tulip-shaped small cutter for the middle.  Dipped the donuts in the glaze then sprinkled a cinnamon and sugar mixture over them.  Had a lot of left-over glaze so could use less next time.  YUM!

I tried this recipe and, while it was tasty, the doughnut was incredibly heavy. I mean just one probably weighed close to 3 pounds, and they had the typical 4-5 inches in diameter. I'm going to try this again, but this time I think I'll allow the dough to rise overnight...
