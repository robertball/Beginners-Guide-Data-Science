Read the reviews first, so made these changes:  added chicken and potatoes to pan along with about 1c broth, italian seasoning and 1Tbsp Seasoned salt, then butter. Covered with foil and baked 20 min at 400, then added fresh broccoli florets and mushrooms cut in half.  Reduced temp to 350, baked for 20 min covered. Uncovered and stirred, baked 20 min more. Served over noodles tossed  with butter and Parmesan and baguette.

This is what i did! i used fresh broccoli, fresh carrots, fresh onion. Red potatoes, baby carrots, olive oil, chicken, and a roasted garlic and rosemary seasoning pack! Cut it all up except the carrots, put it in a gallon bag along with the olive oil and the season pack, shake it all good, put it in the oven at 365 for 45 minutes covered with aluminum foil and let me tell you! I've never tasted anything so good! and with me being on a diet, it was perfect!

Baked Italian Chicken Dinner: "Added chopped onions, did the rest as it's written. Didn't bake even." I had a back-up pot of water poised to boil for making rice in case this dish didn't work out, and I'm glad that I did b/c the potatoes were still too hard, the chicken getting dry and over-done, and the broccoli scorching after an hour. I didn't change anything as the recipe was written other than to add some chopped onion. So we picked out the potatoes and ate the chicken, broccoli and onions, and agreed that I should've just steamed broccoli, and made baked potatoes and chicken, rather than this mixey-uppey method. On the plus side, it was easy to put together, and once I plucked out the potatoes, I pureed the broccoli and chicken to make baby food for LO and she seemed to really dig it!

Many comments suggested that the recipe was dry, I used dry seasoning followed by Italian dressing on the top. covered with foil for about half the baking time and it was perfect!!

This dish was very tasty, but only after some changes I made, which I thought were necessary in order to make it more appealing to my family.  In Step #2:  I mixed in some seasoning salt, cracked black pepper, and garlic powder.  I then tightly covered the dish with aluminum foil before I baked it, so that it wouldn't dry out.  It turned out beautifully!  BTW, I used Yukon Gold potatoes.  I like to use them, because I just scrub 'em, and I don't have to peel them.  They're terrific!

So delicious!  I added a can of green beans (no broccoli in the house), 1/4 cup italian dressing and 1 cup of broth.  I cooked the sweet potatoes that I had cut up in the micro for 5 minutes before I put them in.  1 hour at 350 degrees.  It was so moist and a perfect friday night meal.

very good recipe.  I did add fresh broccoli (slightly steamed, still crunchy) though and next time we will add some fresh collard greens or spinach!  I pre cooked the chicken and par boiled the potatoes to quicken the process, baking about 20 minutes...really really good!

Like someone else mentioned, the 1/4 cup of butter was just not enough liquid in this dish for me. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup of Italian dressing to the mix. Because of other reviews, I chopped up my potatoes into smaller piece so they would cook better and that seemed to be fine. I let it cook for a good 60 minutes. The broccoli was a little mushy but not so bad that I wouldn't make this dish again. I may try fresh broccoli next time. My partner and I added some fresh grated Parmesan to finish things off.

Very easy!  I broiled it for 5 min. At the end to make it a little crispy.  The only thing I would add next time is salt and pepper and onion. My family all ate it so to me , that means I'll be making it again!

I'm pretty let down with this recipe. Even after reading the comments on this I knew I needed to slice the potatoes very thin but they still did not cook. The chicken on the other hand was very good. The broccoli turned to a burnt mush.

I followed the advice of others and added onion and garlic powder and my husband and I thought it was pretty tasty. I didn't have quite enough butter so added a little chicken broth and thought that helped too. Without those additions, I think it might have been bland. We thought the frozen broccoli got dried out so will try fresh or a different veggie with it next time or maybe  just steam some broccoli. The dish was easy to put together and I'll definitely make it again.

Nothing special about this dish. Plain with little flavor & MUCH TOO DRY. I knew 1/4 cup of butter was not enough fluid to keep this dish moist, but tried the recipe as was except for the addition of mushrooms, red peppers, a chili pepper & onion. Even with the moisture from the added veggies was still much too dry. Had to go back & add a cup of chicken broth.

I read all reviews first and made some recommended changes, so I can't give it 5 stars.  I added sliced fresh carrots and quartered onions and used fresh broccoli.    I put everything in a gallon-sized bag with EVOO instead of butter and the seasoning.   I added some garlic salt and liquid Italian dressing as well.   Even tho I had been warned, it took longer to bake than I expected, and the broccoli was a little overcooked.   So I will make some more adjustments next time, because there will definitely be a next time!    This is an excellent starter recipe that can easily be adjusted to suit the needs and tastes of your family.

This was pretty easy, I added garlic powder, cauliflower and carrots, also boiled cubed potatoes for just a few minutes to save some time. Made wt a side of broccoli rice, my 15yo son left his plate spotless, and that says a lot. :)

Delicious!  The only change I made was microwaving the potatoes for about 5 minutes prior to baking. It took about an hour to fully cook.

I can't give this 5 stars because I altered the recipe. The way I made it was delicious. I doubled the recipe. I didn't use potatoes. I added 2 eight oz packages of fresh sliced mushrooms and a chopped medium onion. I cooked it for 45 mins and it was cooked perfectly. I added salt and pepper, to my likening.

Excellent and soooo easy.  I nuked the potatoes a couple of minutes and covered the whole thing with foil. Everything else was the same.  In 60 minutes it was perfect and delicious.

The only thing I would change about this recipe is cooking it on a sheet pan instead of in the 9×13 pan. The chicken and broccoli came out beautifully but my potatoes were unevenly cooked, some were still hard (but edible) and others were cooked perfectly

This is by far the best dish I have made from allrecipes  and I make a LOT of stuff.  The only thing I changed was adding a med onion, the picture with the recipe shows onion but the recipe did not call for it.  My wife and I could eat this 2-3 times a week.  We travel a lot in our 40' diesel coach (RV), this dish is so easy to put together its the perfect one dish, dish.  10 Stars

Yum! My family loved this. I made it as written, except for the Italian seasoning packet (didn’t have) and added some chopped onion. I found a recipe on this site for homemade dry Italian dressing mix and used that instead. It was so good that we’ll definitely be having it again and again!

I made this last night and my family really liked it.  I didn't use potatoes because my 6 year old son wanted pasta with it.  I substituted 1 medium zucchini and 1C carrots, sliced, and used olive oil instead of butter.  My husband liked it because the dish itself was lo carb, and he is trying to lose weight.  Kids ate it up, green veggies and all.  I made spaghetti noodles with olive oil, parsley and roasted garlic (which I cooked in the oven with the chicken dish) to go along with it.  Perfect as a side or right in the bowl.  I love the idea of using the packet dressing mix which is what inspired my ultimate creation. Thanks!

This is an all-in-one dinner recipe!  I enjoyed it and will try again.  I substituted fresh broccoli instead of frozen.  I decided to toss the broccoli with a little olive oil with seasoning prior to adding on top.   In the future, I  may try this recipe substituting olive oil (for dietary reasons) and toss everything before roasting.  But the butter flavor was nice, even though added fat.

This did not work for us at all!  I followed the directions exactly.  Potatoes were still hard after cooking it nearly 90 minutes.  It was a slop dish...watery and gross.  The ingredients were simple and good, but the temperature was not accurate.  I would not make this again.  Thanks.

This recipe needs to be fixed, most of the comments are spot on.  Cover it with foil, pre-cook the potatoes, use more liquid.  Took way longer than 45-60 minutes.

This is very good. The only change I made was adding chopped onion. I will precook the potatoes a bit next time. They weren’t quite soft enough.

Added a little garlic.  Used baby potatoes--no need to peel.  Baked at 350 for 30 min.  Delicious.  It had so much flavor.  Hubby couldn't quit saying how tasty it was.  Next time I'[ll add some onions.

I needed an easy recipe using chicken thighs. This is a great basic recipe. I had to make changes as I had few ingredients at home. I used the chicken and potatoes, plus a carrot, onion and celery. I used hidden valley ranch dressing in place of italian dressing mix. This is a great way to make a versitle easy meal. Don't be afraid to use what you have on hand. Btw it took 55 minutes for the taters and carrots to be soft enough.

Fairly tasty, and an easy dish to make.   I suggest pounding the chicken thin, rather than cutting it, but making sure your potatoes are cut very small--the recipe says diced, and that should be taken literally.  Also, cover with foil in the last 15 minutes or so to prevent overbrowning on the broccoli.

I used fresh broccoli along with fresh carrots, lots of garlic I doubled it, i seasoned the chicken with a little turmeric, onion powder and garlic powder and a little Adobe. I used olive oil instead of butter and added some water to baking dish.  Added dried Italian seasoning, oregano, basil and rosemary as well. Served with organic white rice.

I followed the recipe but did couple of changes like adding garlic, more olive oil, adding carrots and covering it with foil. Chicken was dry I almost choked on it, and needed more flavor. I have lots of left over some I will add better sauce tomorrow.

I made this as in the recipe except I added some chicken broth, garlic powder and pepper.  The potatoes took forever to cook and this seemed to make the chicken dry out.  There wasn't enough flavor even after I added the other spices.  Not a favorite.

This basic recipe was good, but we found it surprisingly sweet. I added one red pepper, one yellow onion, and a couple cloves of garlic to the recipe. Per other reviews I added a little chicken broth and covered the baking dish with foil. It was definitely not dry. I was worried that with the Italian dressing seasoning the end result might be overly salty, but again that was not the case. If anything I would add a little salt to the recipe next time. Very simple, took about 90 minutes in our oven, and with a couple small adjustments I would make it again.

I finally found a foolproof, easy but delish recipe!! The only change I would make would be to sprinkle 1/2 of the seasoning directly on the chicken , before putting the broccoli or potato on it.  Or even better would be garlic salt or Mrs. dash on the chicken.  Awesome recipe!

Very Yummy. Kids loved it. I seasoned chicken with a bit of the seasoning and a little garlic powder and pepper before adding other ingredients. Then added the remainder to the top like instructed.

Loved this! Per other reviews, I did add a little more butter and the potatoes and chicken were nicely cooked and moist by the end, and the broccoli was just perfect. Instead of leaving the ingredients in layers, I mixed them up in the baking dish prior to cooking, and like others, broiled for about 5 minutes at the end - cooking time was 1 hour. I'll definitely be making it again.

Tasted ok, but the potatoes didn't get soft. I added onions for taste.

This is a great recipe! I used truffle olive oil instead of butter and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, parley and basil. Super easy and quick. I served it with a salad. Both my husband and gluten free daughter loved it!

I would recommend adding garlic and onions. You should also prepare rice or pasta on the side. By itself (as followed by the recipe) it's missing something.
