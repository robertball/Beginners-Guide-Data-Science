This has become one of my fast weeknight recipes.  My husband loves it!  I often substitute canned diced tomatoes and sometimes forget the green onions and it is still great.  I usually serve it with diced fresh mexican cheese and tortillas and turn it into a taco/burrito of sorts.  Great to add cooked chicken or beans as well.  Don't skimp on the cayenne!

I made this rice without the frozen vegetables and I added some more tomatoes.  I served it with Mexican Chicken Kiev, Mexican Corn (submitted by Karen Baldridge) and some sauteed peppers . . . My guests loved the entire meal.  The leftover rice was great with eggs too.

This is a very good rice recipe.  I did make the following adjustments.  I used Garlic Powder instead of the Cayenne Pepper, I used canned stewed tomatoes (drain the liquid into a measuring cup and add stock to the required mark for the recipe. I also used cilantro instead of the parsley.  This is a great side dish.  My new favorite mexican rice..thanks for a great recipe!!

This was great! Very fresh tasting, and is best served hot. I used fresh veggies, omitted the garlic, and used water for the vegetable stock. I had this with yogurt for a lovely lunch.

Nice, simple, understated Mexican rice side dish to support and complement a bolder, spicier main dish.  In deference to Hubs’ sensitive innards I skipped the cayenne pepper.  In deference to my dislike of carrots, I skipped them too.  Chicken broth was a flavorful substitute for the vegetable broth.  Quiet but pleasant flavor, pretty and colorful too.

I used fresh carrots and broccoli which I added at the same time as the stock, and also added a little more cayenne pepper than instructed and the result was amazing. Excellent recipe! Also very good to fry some chicken and add it at the same time as the tomatoes.

My husband really liked this.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable and I used fresh sliced carrots (par-cooked) and frozen peas.  It went very well with the Southwestern stuffed chicken brests and cornbread.

Good, not "wow", not blah, but good.  Basic rice with veges added.  Went really good with fish, easy enough to make again, but using canned Mexican diced tomatoes for more of a flair.  Thanks Michelle!

This was delicious. I served it for 80 people at a party and I had to tell everyone where to get the recipe. I used a bag of mixed vegetables and change the vegies every once in a while. Someone told me to had scrambled eggs and chinese vegetables and it would be as good as a restaurant.

I served this alongside the " slow cooker guisade verde" recipe from this site for my Cinco de Mayo party.  Every one enjoyed it. I used canned diced tomatoes and cilantro instead of parsley.  Next time I make it I will experiment with other veg and spices.  Can't mess this one up.  Thanks Michelle!

We enjoyed the flavor of this very much.  I didn't have enough long grain white so mixed with basmati and brown, which was a wrong move, but still very tasty recipe.  Thanks.

Loved this and so did my guest. Rice seemed a little over cooked, but I'll tweak that next time and should be perfect!

Weird, my review of this disappeared... I made this with fresh peas and carrots. I also threw in a lot of cumin, paprika, and some tomato paste because, as written, it was quite bland. I served it with 'Chipotle Chicken' from this site. It was very tasty, and I would make it again. Thanks!

Quick and easy to make and super delicious. The flavor is similar to a dish I get at our favorite Mexican place. I have been trying and trying to make it here at home. This is the closest I've gotten. I have been playing around with it ever since. The last time I made it, I did 2 1/2 cups of chicken stock to the rice and 1/2 cup jalapeno juice. Threw in an extra dash of the cayenne pepper and added 1/4 tsp onion powder. Next time I plan to melt in some Mexican cheeses. We'll see how that goes. Overall, this recipe is very tasty as is without any modifications, but also a great dish to get creative with.

I tweaked it.  Cut the cayenne in half, added 1tbls cumin, and sautéed diced yellow, red, and orange peppers.  Did not add the mixed peas/carrots.  Strained 1 16oz can of diced tomatoes.  2 cups black beans.  Topped with a scoop of Greek yogurt and avocado. Delicious!! 5 stars now!

Excellent rice recipe. I used a tablespoon of paprika with and red pepper flakes instead of cayenne pepper; also I used the suggestion to omit vegetables and double the tomato and the garlic. I will put a little something extra in next time - like garlic powder and maybe chilie powder.

I made a few revisions that didn't quite work so well. I omitted the tomatoes and substituted corn for carrots because I had neither tomatoes nor carrots. It turned out okay but I think the tomato  would have increased the flavor. Regular frozen corn did not seem to fit well with this recipe (although I think grilled corn would have worked)  Great overall flavor with the rest of the ingredients  thus the high rating. I plan to make it again with the suggested ingredients!

We added extra garlic, several shakes of LA Gold (hot sauce) & a full 15oz. can of chili seasoned diced tomatoes.  Like others, we used fresh vegetables (mushrooms) along w/ the frozen peas.  Without several seasoning adjustments, the rice would be quite bland.

Tasty. I soaked my 2 cups rice for 20min to ensure all the starch was rinsed off before putting into my rice cooker for fluffy rice. Used 1TBS coconut oil, 1tsp garlic salt, 1 10oz can undrained diced tomatoes with chiles, 1tsp coriander, 1tsp cumin, used the cayenne, substituted 1tsp fresh cilantro for the parsley. I chopped up 2 skinny carrots. I dissolved a vegetable bullion cube in 1 cup water but wasnt able to use it all to get to the #2 line in the rice cooker. Once the rice was done I tossed in 1/2 c thawed peas & 1/2 small can chopped chiles (left over from chili rellenos casserole) Everyone said this was their favorite! No onions cuz someone here doesnt like them.

This made a pretty good rice side for a Mexican dinner. I cut out the peas because the BF doesn't like them too much but added diced hot peppers with the onion because we like heat. It was very colorful with the thin slices of carrot and diced tomato! Thank you for sharing!

i wanted this to be better than just okay but it left me feeling like it needed something more.. i used less cayenne b/c i didn't want it to overpower everything else.. used half the salt.. i added it when combining everything and felt it was plenty given the fact that i cooked the rice in chicken bouillon.. used frozen peas and fresh carrots that i stir fried a bit before adding.. loved the addition of the fresh tomato.. and wondered why you would add parsley and not cilantro to a mexican dish (i used cilantro).. added chili powder, cumin, and a splash of bottled lemon juice and it was much better.. ty for the start of something we enjoyed

Very versatile dish.  I sauteed some sliced carrots in with the shallot and garlic, and also included frozen peas at the end per directions.  Used chicken broth instead of veg stock and left out tomatoes, parsley and green onion.  Here's the thing with the cayenne, it can be VERY spicy if you serve at that proportion immediately.  Also, if you cook it down the full 20 min plus with the rice, it should be less powerful.  My rice cooked much faster, not giving the cayenne time to absorb.  That said, if you are not a fan of spicy, definitely cut back on the cayenne, or simmer for at least 20 minutes.

This is the best rice dish I've ever had.  The cayenne pepper adds a kick, but not too spicy.  I made the 3 serving version using instant white rice.  I used 1 cup of instant white rice and 1 cup of vegetable stock.  I did not saute the rice beforehand.  All else I did the same.  I served with Delicious Black Bean Burritos off allrecipes.
