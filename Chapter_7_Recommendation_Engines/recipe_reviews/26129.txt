Nice dough, easy to work with and keeps its shape well during baking.  Unfortunately, these were way too sweet for my taste, even before I glazed them. Be sure to eat these with a tall glass of milk, reduce the sugar a bit, or simply move on to another recipe that is not as sweet.

I was very excited about this recipe, but after trying it, I'm afraid all I can give it is 3 stars and I'm only giving it that because ,with some tinkering it can be fixed.
I followed it to a tee. but got a very flat, greasy cookie. I think it needs either less shortening or more flour. I thought with the amount of baking powder called for it would be a "puffier" cookie.
Also my oven is right on as far as temperature goes and I had to add at least 5 more minutes to the cooking time in order to get cookies that were even remotely done.
On the positive side, the large amount of extract makes the cookies very flavorable.
As I said, with some adjustments this recipe have good potential.

These were great.  Very basic, very simple to make and easy to eat.  I used vanilla, but will try almond and maybe maple soon.  These are a good no frills cookie jar everyday cookie, and so simple to get done there is no reason they should not be a staple.  Husband and kids all loved them. Thank you!

This is a great, easy recipe. I just made these with my 2 yr old and they turned out fabulous. I scaled the recipe in half and followed all directions exactly. They are sweet, but I don't think too sweet. You could always cut back on the sugar if you want. I would add 1/4 cup more flour next time since I live at high altitude. They would be great with different extracts. I would love to try lemon or orange. I used a tablespoon sized scoop and had to cook them about 12 minutes. I do think these cookies would be too sweet with a glaze on top, using the sugar or sprinkles was perfect for me. I can't stop eating them! EDITED 6 hrs after initial review to change from 4 to 5 stars. I can't stop eating these, they really are very, very good. I will have to make them again in a few days.

Because I was running short on time, I was looking for a sugar cookie that I didn't have to roll out. So instead of my usual recipe, I decided to try this one. Besides, my children said they preferred a softer cookie. My daughter took one bite and said 'Now this is what a sugar cookie should taste like'. Instead of rolling them into balls, I used a scoop which wasn't as messy as having to roll them by hand and much quicker. I also used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract. The only other change I would make is to decrease the sugar. Even my kids agreed it was too sweet.

Quick, easy & versatile recipe.  Scaled recipe down by half, and opted not to wait the 1 hour for the dough to chill.  Instead, I did drop cookies.  Had to bake them for about 12-13 minutes though - my advice is just keep an eye out for them to turn just barely golden brown on top.  I opted not to roll the cookies in sugar, instead I sprinkled either cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice over the top as they came out of the oven.  Turned out perfect.  Will definitely be making again, and I plan on trying the recipe with different extracts or spices.

Very good! No need for frosting, they are VERY sweet if you roll them in sugar like it says to do. I also rolled half of mine in a cinnamon-sugar mix and that added a nice touch. Nice and soft if you don't bake them too long.

Good basic recipe that was easy and the kids loved 'em.  The dough made nowhere near 5.5 dozen for me, but I wasn't concerned about making them uniformly sized or shaped so it didn't matter.  I used 2 sticks of butter because I didn't have shortening, and omitted the salt.

These cookies are quite good, I used 1/2 butter and vanilla and almond extracts and they tasted wonderful right out of the oven. A word of warning put them right into a container after they cool. I decided to wash my cookie jar so I left them out overnight(I made them at 8pm)they were pretty hard in the morning.

These are sweet and they turned out a little less soft than I expected.  I used butter flavored Crisco for the shortening and they wound up with a buttery flavor that didn't quite fit the taste of the cookie.I might make these again using regular shortening, and baking them slightly less.

I needed to make something quick using the limited ingredients I had in the house and this served me very well.  I used salted butter instead of shortening (because that's what I had) and reduced salt to 1/4 tsp.  They turned out crispy on the bottom, chewy on top, and a bit gooey in the middle, which I like.  Since I used butter they also tasted very buttery and extremely rich.  It was easy and it turned out well.  I recommend this recipe.

I made these without the extra sugar...For adult tastes-not too sweet.  I also used butter.  I made these cookies 2 ways, as the top of the recipe says it takes 24 hours.  I made the dough and left it sit in the fridge overnight, about 16 hours.  The dough was SO stiff, it was really hard on my wrist to scoop it out.    The next day I made another batch using orange extract, but only left the dough in the fridge for 1 hr 15 minutes.  Doing it that way was a breeze to scoop for balls.  To make up for it not being as cold, once I had rolled it in balls I put the cookie sheets in the fridge to get nice and cold for about 15 minutes.  No matter what I did, these were never cooked in 8-9 minutes, it took closer to 20 minutes...the bottom rack in a regular oven did not brown, so I would take the top rack cookies out first, then switch the cookies on bottom rack to the top rack for 2 minutes and they browned nicely.  TIP:  for cookie "marathons" (I always make several cookie batches the same day as I hate getting the mixer, pans etc dirty over and over) use parchment paper to make your cookies, and cut the parchment paper to fit exactly into the pan you are using.  (I use heavy duty aluminum pans).  You can use the parchment paper over and over (I have done this as many as 10 times with the same paper)...I used to hate making cookies until I discovered that you can use the parchment paper over and over and it makes cleanup a breeze.    Great recipe! Cake like texture.

I made these as a gift for a friend and she loved them.  She kept asking me what the secret was beacause she said they were sooo tender and light.  I was suprised, because it's a pretty straightforward recipe.  I did refrigerate the dough for 24 hrs before rolling and baking the cookies.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.

These were good.  My kids wanted to help make them so I rolled them out and used cookie cutters. They were dry and crispy  thin but still tasted great.  Next time I will try drop cookies and hopefully they will be softer but my whole family loved them!  5 stars!

Great cookies but a little too sweet. I picked this recipe because others said it was sweet and I liked that but honestly a little too sweet! Even for me and my family! Cut down on the sugar or don't roll them in the sugar before baking and you'll be okay.

This was so easy and quick. I wanted a really quick sugar cookie recipe that didn't have to be rolled out, and this worked out great. I agree with some of the reviews that said it was a little sweet, but that was just what I was looking for! I am an awful baker, so this recipe would be great for a beginner.

I made these because I didn't have butter. They were great! I used butter flavored shortening and shaved off a tablespoon due to the flat/greasy reviews. I didn't wait for them to chill or roll them in sugar. I also added a 1/2 tsp of lemon extract. They were not at ALL flat and very tender.

My family loved these. By mistake I mis read and used only 1/2 cup of shortening. They still turned out very good.  A little chewy but we liked them that way. I also used almond extract. And will soon just try vanilla and see how that taste.

Easy to make. Very good cookie! Soft, delicate, yummy! I rolled mine in cinnamon and sugar before baking! They held their shape when cooking! Thanks for the recipe! Love it! I did not find that they were too sweet! They were perfect.

after tasting my original batch I realized that this recipe need some assistance. First of all 1 additional tsp of vanilla extract is needed.  Secondly 1 cup of shortening is way too much the cookies taste too much like shortening use half butter or margarine and half shortening. Otherwise the cookies were indeed soft and stayed that way overnight. 

Of course I always use my stay soft cookie trick which is put them in ziplock freezer bags while still warm. It holds the moisture and the cookies remain soft.

I'm giving this three stars because the cookies were easy to make and they come out looking beautiful. But there is too much shortening in the reci; all I can taste is shortening and sugar. I think using butter instead and using a bit less would work much better. If I use this recipe again, it'll have to be tweaked.

I loved this recipe- very easy. I used 4 different coloured sugars and they were a hit at the party! For Christmas I am using red and green sugars.

I was looking for an easy sugar drop cookie recipe for my  cookie craving and these fit the bill. They are very easy to throw together and taste amazing! They have a great texture, nice and soft on the inside, not chewy. I made the dough and got sick (morning sickness... so fun) so I ended up putting the dough in the fridge for a couple of days. When I pulled it out, it was very easy to scoop out with my dough scooper; it is a  very workable dough.
The only change I made is that I only used 1 cup of sugar, I don't like really sweet cookies. I also didn't roll it in sugar as I planned on frosting them, however, they didn't last long enough to frost! 
This recipe is very versatile and you could adjust it to your needs by changing the extracts, frosting them, rolling in sprinkles, ect. A great cookie recipe and definately a keeper for me! I have a feeling that I'll be making these again real soon! Thanks Lesa for the amazing recipe!

Very easy to make. I didn't have a mixer so I mixed everything by hand and used lemon extract in place of the vanilla extract and butter in place of shortening. It made wonderful and easy lemon sugar cookies.

I don't care for store bought sugar cookies... the taste and the texture just don't appease my taste buds. This is the first homemade sugar cookie I have ever made and I wasn't prepared to be delighted. I love the slight crisp on the outside with the soft fluffiness inside. These practically melted in my mouth! I rolled a dozen of them in sugar and cinnamon and can't wait to eat them (possibly all 12) with my coffee in the morning. Thank you for posting!

A very good basic cookie.  They spread a lot so give space.  I had a whole baking sheet with cookie.  Still yummy, but less pretty.

I doubled the recipe and seeing that many people said they were too sweet, I decreased the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 c. I then divided the dough in half and rolled one half in Saran Wrap, rolled it and put in the fridge. The other half, I added 
1/2 tsp. Cinnamon
1/4 tsp ginger
1/4  tsp allspice
I then rolled it also in Saran Wrap and refrigerated it.
Took the roll out after an hour and just sliced and baked!
Keep in mind, I had a few rolls of dough...
After baking for 9 minutes, I sprinkled a cinnamon/ sugar on top. With Christmas near, someone told me they tasted like “Christmas in her mouth”
I’ve been looking for an old fashioned sugar cookie like mom used to bake...I think I just found it! I also love that I can use it as a base for other flavours.

The cookies are sweet enough for my tastes, and very soft(for me at least). I rolled each cookie into differently colored sugars, and even cinnamon-sugar. They came out delicious! Hopefully my grandma and dad will like them, because I sure do.

Very good cookie. I did not need to chill the dough, but did need to bake about 12 minutes. Instead of rolling in sugar, I topped them with white sanding sugar. My son and I loved them. I will be filing this with my favorites.

These are delish and I will keep as my go to sugar cookie.  Instead of butter or margarine I always use butter flavor Crisco and it worked well in this recipe.   Kept dough in fridge over-night then rolled into balls, dipped in sugar and flattened with bottom of a glass. Husband doesn't like sugar cookies but he is eating these.

What can I say,these cookies are absolutely going on the Holiday cookie list!!(or the we need a quick snack list!) 
 The recipe was very simple and easy to just whip up and cook!(I am not one of those let chill kind of cooks) I did, however, add 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp Allspice, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, and 1 tsp cinnamon. They gave these cookies that special Autumn feel! 
 I will be making these again very soon!! *oh I forgot to mention that I split the recipe in half as this was a trial run!*

I really dont like giving a bad review This recipe did NOT turn out for me at all! I made them again using butter added an extra cup of flour and they turned out much better! I prefer cookies with butter

These were tasty and turned out lovely. I used butter flavor shortening and that seemed to tame the sweet down a bit.

These cookies are really good! Having an old oven, however, I have a few tips.

If you have an old oven (earlier than year 2000), set the temperature to 400 degrees. When shaping the cookies, roll the ball, flatten it a bit, then dip one side in sugar. Then bake for about 10-13 minutes. They'll be crunchy on the edge and soft in the middle.

The cookies are a bit dry (you'll get pretty thirsty) but that's expected. I gave the recipe 4 stars because of prep time (creaming the sugar/shortening takes a LONG time) and the difficulties experienced trying to cook them correctly.

Made this today for a neighbor who cannot have milk products and they were great. Easy to make and delicious flavor. I added just less than the sugar called for in the cookies and frosted them instead of doing the sugar sprinkled on top. Thanks for a good recipe!

This is a great basic sugar cookie recipe.  The only thing I had to change was using a cup of butter instead of shortening because I did not have any on hand.

This is a good recipe to start with, but like another reviewer mentioned, these are a little too sweet for my taste, I didn't even use the glaze. Plus I don't know where I went wrong, but my cookies stuck to the cookie sheet even with the use of non-stick spray. :( None-the-less, I will try this recipe again, only with half the sugar.

This was quick and so easy!! Loved it. Instead of one cup of shortening I did half a cup of shortening and half a cup of butter and I put in all most 4 tsp of vanilla.I left them in the fridge for about a hour to an hour and a half. I rolled half in sugar and half sugar/cinn. Baked for 12 mins and they came out perfect! Gave some to my neighbors and when I came back my hubby and son had them all most all gone! I will be making these again in a few weeks for my son's class and then again around the new year. This is a keeper!!

I loved these! Simple and tasty.  Only change I made was because I didn't have enough shortening.  I did half shortening and half butter.  They were great!  I will definitely use again!
