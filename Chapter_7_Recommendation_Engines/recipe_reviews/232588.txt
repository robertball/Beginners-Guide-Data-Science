This is a great use for the stale Italian bread you have on hand.  It worked out beautifully, however the general consensus was it was slightly dry, so Iâ€™d add extra olive oil or butter the next time.

I will make this again since it was quiet at the dinner table.  The recipe says cooked shrimp but you are cooking raw shrimp.

I made it, but found the noodles to be very bland, so I squeezed a lemon slice on top of everything and it tasted great.
