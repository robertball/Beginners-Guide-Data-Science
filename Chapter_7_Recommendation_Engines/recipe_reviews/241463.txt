Good flavors, I added mushrooms, donâ€™t be stingy with the lemon & use good fresh sustainable shrimp! I served with/over orzo with more veggies!

This is a wonderful shrimp recipe that is so quick to make and has great flavor.  I used only red peppers (personal preference) and served it over risotto.  Thanks for sharing!
