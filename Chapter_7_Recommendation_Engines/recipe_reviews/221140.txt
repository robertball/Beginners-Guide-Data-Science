OK, I could've totally ate this entire thing, lol...YES, IT'S THAT GOOD! Just be prepared...this took more time (and broth) than called for, which was no problem for me b/c I had the extra time, and this is soooo worth it, just wanting to let others know! Great flavor and method...I used 'Barilla Cut Spaghetti', instead of breaking my own, just b/c I had it. I will be making this over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Even though I have loved every single one of Chef John's recipes I have tried thus far, this one seemed too simple to be really "all that good" and the few negative reviews had me thinking I would have had to spice this up quite a bit. I was WRONG!! I only had linguine so I broke those up and other than that I didn't change a thing. This was SO very good. I didn't even had to add salt!!! I just kept adding a little broth at a time until it cooked down to the way I liked it. I sprinkled the red pepper flakes and freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano on top and voila!! If you think you can get away with putting the fake cheap stuff on top, nope! It sure won't be the same. This was great. I can see it being served at any Italian restaurant with some chicken and veggies on the side. I had it by itself because I'm "carbing up" for a long run tomorrow ;o)

Oh Yes Chef John!! This was delicious!! You can find a product called Fideo in the Latin section, which is small packages (8 oz.) of broken spaghetti, if you don't want the mess of breaking spaghetti into pieces. You can also add some chopped onion when browning the pasta, and a can of diced tomatoes with the broth to get a totally different flavor. Either way, you will be tempted to eat the whole pan yourself!! Thanks!!

I've been making home-made type "Rice-A-Roni" dishes for years.  It started out simple because I didn't have any when my kids asked for it.  Using the box technique of browning the spaghetti & rice in butter, adding stock, seasonings, covering and simmering.  The kids never knew the difference.  As yrs have gone by, this is my go to for a quick and easy scampi dish.  Adding rice, lemon, shrimp, lots of garlic, red pepper flake etc.  You can make this dish into just about anything for either a side or main dish.  Serving with cooked chicken breasts (any way, think lemon chicken for one) on top with an array of seasoning options, fresh parsley...the possibilities are endless.  To give this a poor rating just means you have to broaden your imagination and not be afraid to try as written and experiment.  Excellent recipe to put out there...Thank you for sharing with others Chef John!

This dish was simple, but not as tasty as I had hoped. It was bland, so I ended up adding mushrooms, bacon, and pesto. I did enjoy the nutty flavor that was achieved from toasting the noodles. I will not be making this again.

Outstanding! I used 8 Oz. whole wheat spaghetti and 2 cans chix broth, and lots more garlic. We think that this could masquerade as wild rice!

I'm a big fan of Chef John's, but this fell short of his usually excellent recipes. It was bland, bland, bland. Instead of trying to figure out how to fix it, I'll just start by choosing a different recipe next time. Keep them coming anyway, Chef John!

What a great side dish!  Yes, I added more chicken broth and cooked it longer than the recipe stated, but it turned out so flavorful!   I didn't have fresh parsley.  Just used the dried stuff.  I also used a little wheat pasta mixed in with the regular. Fantastic!  Will be making again and again!

I'm Italian and (if allowed) I would eat pasta everyday. But, I do find myself looking for different "sauces" instead of the normal red sauce once in a while, and this recipe fits the bill for something different. It is sooooo good, I agree with the one reviewer who said they could eat it all. I loved how it came out "creamy" and the flavor, wonderful. So happy to have found this. Thank you Chef John!

My daughter and I have made this wonderful recipe several times now and it's always delicious.  The first time we made it exactly as written and loved it.  Since then we've added different ingredients to see how it turned out and one of our favorites is fresh sliced mushrooms that we saut√©ed with onions in a little olive oil.  The cheese at the end brings it all together.  We use whole grain spaghetti.  So so good!  Thanks for sharing Chef John!

Well, I liked the idea of this and we‚Äôve enjoyed other recipes that call for toasting pasta.  Instead of spaghetti, I made this using orzo pasta.  The orzo toasted beautifully, but when it came to adding the broth, it evaporated far too quickly.  Even after adding more broth than called for, the pasta still was not done.  Rather than continuing to add more broth, I added water to complete the cooking process.  In the end, this turned out well, but I doubt I‚Äôll use this method again.  I think there are easier ways to cook this with equally good results.

Although not overly difficult to make, I guess I was expecting more of a Risotto consistency. Some of the pasta was a little crunchy stuff (mainly due to the toasting maybe?) Anyway, it was worth a try, cool spices. I followed it as is with no modifications, I guess it just wasn't what I hoped it would be. I still recommend it, since it's worth a try  - but I don't know if I'd make this again. Happy cooking!

I have prepared this a couple of times, first following the directions and then ‚Äúfree styling it‚Äù a bit.  The first time tasted very nice.  I used angel hair pasta, as that was all I had.
Then, the second time I added some of the Ladolemono to the pan while browning the broken pasta.  Even better.
Then, I cooked a thinly sliced onion in a separate pan until soft, added some shrimp while browning the pasta, adding in chopped sweet peppers in the final moments.  I also used the Ladolemono into the vegetables and shrimp. Combined the finished pasta to the shrimp mixture and MDH and I dove in. 
I know, making revisions and then rating is not looked upon with favor, but let me say my rating on this recipe is for the recipe as written.  It is a 4 star.  It is one of those recipes that makes a cook wonder, ‚ÄùIf I add ??, how will that taste?  The additions of Ladolemono, onions peppers and shrimp made a lovely, lemony dish.  
Oh, someone made the suggestion to break the pasta inside a zip bag.  Brilliant, as MDH was getting very exasperated with broken bits of pasta flying around the kitchen during my earlier cooking efforts. A muttering husband in the background while cooking is not conducive to cooking genius.
So, original recipe is a 4 star.  My free styling recipe is up to you how you rate it.  But, please enjoy and thanks for sharing all the recipes.

This was the weirdest method for using spaghetti but turned out really good!  I did not have Parmigiano-Reggiano and used plain Parmesan instead.  I also added some Italian style turkey meatballs and used both chicken and beef broth.   A little seasoned salt, pepper and red pepper flake and this was surprisingly really tasty.  I have a high pressure job so easy during the week is better and this was about perfect.  The recipe timing is a little off so just go with it and test your pasta.  Like Arborio rice, the pasta does slowly absorb the liquid so only use 1.5 cups at a time.

Very good; very flavorful, as written. Took 3+ cups of stock and about 30 minutes to reach al dente. 

My advice for making this kid friendly: cut out the red pepper flakes entirely (I reduced it, but it was still a bit hot for my very little ones); reduce the garlic to 1 clove or leave it in larger pieces that can be removed (again, to reduce the heat for the very little ones); don't think you can get away with the cheap, "green can" cheese because you're serving this to kids (go for the good stuff -- it makes a difference here). 

No, this isn't blue box mac 'n cheese. It's way, way better. Give your kids a chance to love it.

YUM!! Quick and easy.  Old school rustic comfort food.  The only change I made was to use butter instead of olive oil, I just prefer butter.

I tried this recipe today. For me it took about twice the amount of broth but I had it so that was not a problem. I loved it, my husband liked it. I also used Barilla cut spaghetti. I will definitely make it again and may try adding shrimp or possibly leftover chicken and vegetables some time. Thanks Chef John.

I found the chili flakes to be WAY too spicy.  Next time I make this recipe I'll only add a pinch.  Other than that, thought, this was DELICIOUS!!  I also made it with fake chicken stock (I'm a vegetarian), and it was still really good. (not that I have anything to compare it to....)

I was skeptical at first about this recipe but it tasted awesome!. It took longer to cook than the recipe said it would and I ended up using more chicken stock than stated and I added some peas and carrots from the can toward the end. It tasted great!!

I will be making this again! It ended up taking 1 and 1/2 cans of broth and closer to 30 minutes to make but it was easy and delicious. I added a little extra red pepper flakes and cheese, and served with grilled chicken. For the cheese I used the Kraft shredded parmesean, Romano, and asiago cheese from the refrigerated pasta section and it was delish. I definitely recommend.

Splendid. Good as a side dish, better as a springboard for one-dish dinners. The method is clearly written and easy to follow. My Mexican neighbor put this dish in my head years ago. She made it a meal with chorizo and black beans, called it "Fried Spaghetti". The review from pvpba on July 15th made me try shrimp. Like pvpba, I would say: stay away from the green shaker-can of parmesan cheese... use a good, sharp Reggiano or Romano from the deli. Adjust the liquid, adjust the garlic, but it's definitely a five-star recipe.

We LOVED this. I used Aldi gluten free brown rice pasta. That actually makes it better for you with the whole grain , although I have no choice. It takes quite a bit more broth. I kept adding more. Otherwise I made it as the recipe calls for. I will definitely make this again. I don‚Äôt know how wheat pasta is with this, but mine was very creamy with the starch left in and not drained off as with other pasta dishes.   Thank you for the recipe!!!

This turned out very well in spite of me. I over-browned my spaghetti, which somehow didn't detract from the overall flavor that I could tell. Also, I didn't measure exactly the amount of spaghetti so I needed a lot more liquid than the recipe called for. Other than that, though, it's great to have the recipe on hand in a pinch, but it's quicker & easier to use something like Rice a Roni. It's still going in my recipe box, though! Thanks, Chef John!

This was very easy and quick. I made this just as written but adjusted for 3 people.  I found cut fideo in my local market so I used that instead of breaking spaghetti.  I needed about 3 1/2 cups of broth to get the pasta al dente for 3 servings. Once it was done I tasted it and it was good as is but it tasted flat. I used homemade chicken broth so the dish needed more salt - about 1 tsp. It still tasted too lean for a main dish so I stirred in 2 tablespoons of butter.  With the addition of more parm at serving it was very tasty.   Next time I think I will add the salt with the broth so the pasta absorbs the salt for more flavor throughout.   Will definitely make again with my changes.

Yum! I used a big pan - 12" nonstick - reduced the oil to 1/2 T, and probably could have skipped oil all together if not for the garlic. I needed a full 2 C of liquid. When I was tasting it from the pan, it wasn't anything special, but after adding butter and lemon - yum!

This recipe is great!  So easy and delicious  And ingredients mostly on hand.  My  local neighborhood   Wal-Mart had spaghetti already broken.   After you make it once you won't need the recipe.    I am cooking for one so usually have too much left over.    Had no trouble finishing this off in two sittings.  Second time I added shrimp and mushrooms. Will make again!

My changes were  to use whole grain spaghetti (which made it a bit difficult to see when it was brown).  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried, & I added an 8oz pkg of baby bella mushrooms with the garlic.  It was FANTASTIC.  I had everything already in the pantry so this was like a "free" meal.  Super tasty!

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of adding a ton of fresh basil from my garden.  YUM!!

Oh and I kept adding 1/2 cup of chicken broth as it was absorbed until the pasta was just cooked and not crunchy.

It is a good easy recipe . The next time I will add a little more broth as I added too many noodles. This would be good with chicken or pork mixed in it.

I used vegetable broth instead and it tasted a bit bland but was still good. Snap all of the pasta before turning on stove or else some pasta ends up burned

Well, this was a waste of both my time and my homemade stock. The broth would have been better if heated when added and increased to 2 cups and not the 1 1/2c. 

As I have no patience for a proper risotto,  I do not recommend this recipe

I used a specialty pasta, smoked Portobello, and it was fabulous. Made my own broth. Added a bunch of fresh spinach and cooked that just enough to wilt it.

I used brown rice noodles, so a bit longer/harder to make (rice spaghetti is challenging for me - but have to use it for dietary restrictions).  I also added other spices, was boring without it.

In a word, AWESOME.  I made this for dinner last evening as a side dish with some greek baked chicken breasts and a green salad for some colour.  This is very easy and I normally would make a recipe without changes first time around but, as I always read reviews first, another reviewer said they added mushrooms and onions.  I added some sliced fresh mushrooms because they needed to be used and a sliced onion.  I sauteed them first and set them aside while I followed the recipe then put them back in at the end to reheat.  As other reviewers have said, it does take a little longer to cook than the stated time, maybe 10 minutes.  This is a very delicious dish and I will make it again with or without the additions.  I love it when I am a hero in the kitchen!

I really liked this as a side dish but did find it needed a little punch of something at the end.   Be prepared to just add chicken broth as needed (I used way more than 1.5 cups).   Probably depends on the thickness of your broken spaghetti.   I loved the nutty/buttery flavor of browning the pasta, but wanted a little more interest.   This is a great base for putting just about anything.   I added some pine nuts and chopped green onions and it was definitely a keeper.

Enjoyed the nutty flavor.  I didn't measure out the chicken stock, had some leftover and used what was in the container.  Didn't have quite enough so I added a little water near the end of the cooking till the pasta was done.  Its a little more work then watching water boil, but worth the effort.  Good on its own or as a side dish.  Lots of  possibilities for different pasta dishes with a deeper flavor.

I made this a couple nights ago and thought it was really good! Anyone who says it has no flavor probably did not put any red pepper flakes into theirs! I will say that I think the half teaspoon called for was a bit much and I really love spicy foods! Next time, I might add some mushrooms to it and maybe some shallot would add some nice flavor as well! Thanks Chef John!

I made it, but tossed in some chopped sweet red and orange peppers for color, a tbsp of chopped scallions, and then added some diced grilled chicken breast which I cooked up while the spaghetti was softening in the broth, and this made for a colorful and delicious all-in-one meal.

This was really good, I don't care what it's called! I used 4 ounces of thin spaghetti and the rest of the ingredients for 1 person. I did add 1/2 a diced shallot with the chopped spaghetti and pretty much everything as written. This was an easy dish and a nice change from potatoes or rice (which we also love). Thanks Chef John. We'll be having this often.

This recipe is definitely a keeper...it was FABULOUS!  The nutty flavor with the freshly grated cheese kicked it over the top.  I made this following the recipe (just added a bit more broth).  It ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù quickly; and I mean EVERY morsel.  Thanks so much.

Very nice, but as mentioned before you will need more stock than is asked for.  I can definitely see myself eating the entire pot! 
I made it without cheese as my son is anaphylactic to it, and just put cheese on the side for the rest of my family.
Works out great!

I've not made this recipe, but I have a similar one that is from Christmas with Southern Living Cookbook -- 1997  entitled Noodle-Rice Casserole.  It was delicious the first time I made it and it was when I made it earlier this week.

Made exactly as the recipe here requires, it's very bland and boring.  You really need fresh homemade broth (as shown in the video) and it takes it to a whole new yummy level.  I also have added more cheese, because I happen to luv cheese!

Just made this, pretty tasty and easy to make, with a good comfort food sort of taste. The recipe definitely needs more broth, at least 1/2 to 1 full cup extra, to get the pasta to the right consistency. The 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes made it a little too spicy, so I would recommend using less unless you really like them.

Quick and easy to prepare.  Took more time breaking up the pasta, I think  :D  Flavor was very good.  Made a great side dish.  Next time I`m going to add mushrooms.  I just have a feeling it would be even better with mushrooms. :)

I liked this more than expected. I did have to add an extra round of chicken broth to have the noodles cook to al dente.

This was just ok. If I made it again I'd use half butter and half olive oil to add more flavor, and add some onion as other reviewers have mentioned. I used 2 cups of broth and could have used more.

This was really good. Simple to make and fairly plain but yummy and a great pairing with many things like grilled vegetables and meats. I didn't have fresh Parmesan which would have made it better. I bet it would be great with Mizithra cheese which I'd like to try soon.

Fit the bill! I was looking for a recipe I had all the ingredients for & that I didn't need to use the oven (it was a hot day). I doubled it up and added broccoli and it was great! Definitely a keeper!

I added a diced tomato close to the end, and added about 1/4 cup of cream cheese.  Will make it again! Would be good with chicken and more veggies too.

This is a great recipe, unfortunately, I only eat  whole grain pasta, and it does not work well  with that type of pasta. For some reason whole grain pastas do not absorb flavors as well as regular pasta, they need a thick sauce for their flavoring, like a marsala, picata  bolognese, or marinara !

Easy and tasty way to get my Spaghetti fix! I added authentic Italian Prosciutto and result was a creamy pasta dish. Will make often for myself as husband won't eat pasta but I could live on it! Thank you Chef John.

This dish is amazing as is. But, I prefer to make a few changes and turn it into a lovely entree. I chop about half of a medium onion, slice some mushrooms, an additional clove or two of garlic and slice a chicken breast into cubes. Cook the onion in two tablespoons of olive oil until it starts to soften. Add some of the garlic and let cook for a minute or so, then add the chicken. When the chicken is about halfway cooked, add the mushrooms and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. Let this all cook together, stirring occasionally until the chicken is cooked through. Remove this mixture from the pan and set aside. I then prepare the pasta exactly as described in this recipe. When the pasta is almost done, add the chicken mixture back to the pan. Throw in a handful of pine nuts and cook until the noodles are at your desired texture. Remove from heat, sprinkle with parsley and cheese and serve. I have served this to many guests and received rave reviews. Another awesome Chef John recipe!

A bit time consuming as you have to stir constantly while adding broth.  It is worth the effort, I also add a few extra like slivered carrots/ mushrooms...almost anything

This was pretty good, but not a huge hit with my family. It took more broth, and more time, for the spaghetti to soften. It does make a nice side dish.

I loved this! I wanted more even after I was full, it was hard to resist eating more than I should! We followed the recipe, except for the fact that we added bacon. I treated my parents to this, and they loved it as well!

Loved this recipe! I added a lot more garlic because we love it. And a little more parm, can never have enough cheese. I also added frozen peas and mushrooms near the end, turned out great!

Very quick and easy, I made it exactly as directed except I added some sliced button mushrooms.  I have to say the red pepper flakes made it spicier than I would have liked.  Next time I prepare it I will cut back on the red pepper flakes somewhat.  Overall this tasted really nice, and I will prepare it again.

Simple and delicious! I ended up squeezing some lemon slices (about 3-4) for this dish, which added a very lemony fragrance and taste‚Äîit was wonderful! Also added some shrimp (and a total of five garlic) into the recipe. In the chicken broth, I used regular stock with added onions. I don't know how the original tastes, but I like my tweaked version. Would definitely make it again! ;}

I changed this a bit by using arborio rice instead of the spaghetti, and I added basil.  I also increased the liquid a bit because it seemed to dry out before the arborio was cooked.  My husband and I loved this, however it was a bit dry. I will definitely cook it again.

I changed it up a little. I needed to take this from a side dish to a main dish.  I made the recipe as writen while I saut√©ed mushrooms, onions and carrots separately.  At the end of the cooking time, I added them and some frozen peas.   I also added saut√©ed garlic lime shrimp.  YUMMY

I used this recipe as a side dish with grilled chicken breasts and roasted zucchini and onions.  It was simple to make and tasted good.  The only things I did differently were to add more chicken stock, use freshly shredded Parmesan cheese and put in double the red peppers, because I usually like it spicier than written (bad call on my part).

I gave 4 stars because it was good (although a tad dry) and I enjoyed it but I didn't love it (probably because of my mistakes).  I will definitely make this again for my family so I get their opinions also!  Thanks for expanding my repratorie Chef John.  

By the way what is the difference between Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and just Parmesan cheese?  I could not find the Parm-Regg kind and I would really like to know.  Kathy

Other than using gluten-free brown rice noodles and lemon pepper and tarragon in place of the red pepper flakes, I followed it to a "T" and LOVED it!

It isn't even 7:00 in the morning yet, and I can't wait until dinnertime to try this recipe.  I know we'll love it - it's similar to rice recipes, of course, but I LOVE angel hair pasta, so that's what I'll use.  Thanks for all the good recipes!

It was way too bland but too much trouble to make. I would not make this again!

I discovered something about me and my family. We don't like toasted pasta. The method was easy enough and it looked pretty but we couldn't get over the toasted flavor. It was edible but not good for us. I did like the freshness of the parsley. I didn't want to throw it out so I squeezed the juice of one lemon on it. That freshened it up a bit but I won't be making this again.

This was a super easy side dish to make.  I probably overdid it on the red pepper , so be careful.  I did find that I needed to add more liquid than suggested, or the noodles would have been a little bit hard.  But that should be common sense ;0)  The kids and hubby enjoyed this, and I will make it again for sure (minus a shake of red pepper flakes).

This recipe was OK.  It lacked flavor.  I would add lemon juice or lemon pepper.  I did try to make it with extra chichen broth, ground chicken and some diced bacon.   It definately needs some tweaking to taste.

This is a fun new way to cook pasta.  The flavor that is imparted by the chicken stock is unbelievable.  We took leftovers and ate them with pasta sauce and it was delicious.
I'm wondering is you could use other types of pasta.  My only complaint was the actual breaking of the pasta was time consuming and messy.
Will definitely make again!

This is DELICIOUS! Primo! You do have to use more chick broth, I used 2 1/2 cans and it took atleast 30 mins but my gosh was it worth it!

If you're a beginner cook, don't try this, even if you've tried other recipes of Chef John's that turned out. It was hard and even after all the work, it was bland and other things needed to be added... not entirely impressed, I might try it again later though.

Chef John.  Great recipe, but when you describe the origin of this type of recipe, it most likely tastes and resembles Paella from Barcelona, Spain... It is more like Rice-a-Roni noodles... Will make this again..
