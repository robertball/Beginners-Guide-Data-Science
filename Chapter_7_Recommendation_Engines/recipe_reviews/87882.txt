I made this twice before rating it, because although I didn't love it the first time, I thought it had potential with some slight tweaks. I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and it was just too sweet for my taste. The second time, I reduced the carrots to 1.5 cups, increased the bean sprouts to 1 cup, left out the sweetener, doubled the coconut, added more cilantro, and increased the mustard seed to 1 tb. It was much more flavorful and less carroty-sweet. Next time, I'll add just a little bit more mustard seed--it's the one ingredient that really gives this recipe its unique flavor and shouldn't be left out. I'll definitely keep this one with the mods. It's a beautiful salad, too.

Different and Delicious!  I used splenda and olive oil (what I had on hand).  Followed others and tripled the mustard seed amount as well as the coconut amount.  Great flavor combonations.  Felt like it was great right after making it, but after a few hours it lost it's jazz and then the next day was just a sweet mess.  Used the pre-jullienne carrots in the bag and fresh bean sprouts from the farmers market.  Great!

Wanted to try this as I love bean sprouts.  I did modify - adding 1 cup sprouts and 1 cup carrots and left out sugar.   Also doubled mustard seed.    Unfortunately I think I left too much of the sweet out so I will add a little sugar and let marinade more.   But my husband loved the spice of the mustard seed.  A little bite

Thought this was interesting and like having uses for extra bean sprouts. More coconut and mustard seed improves.  Will try rice wine vinegar next time.

Easy recipe to follow!  We grew our own bean sprouts and learned how to get into a fresh coconut to make this! The combination of ingredients has a fantastic taste!  We'll be making this again!

I added a garnish of roasted coconut, plus I shredded, rather than grated, the carrots, to save time. I would say this recipe is not a  keeper because the flavors just seemed to add up to not much and it was lacking in a certain "oomph."

A nice alternative to coleslaw.  I added a little cabbage.  A sweet carrot side dish that went well with the Spicy Indian Dahl recipe from this website.

I love bean sprouts in Thai and Vietnamese food and was looking for another way to use them when I get a big bag.  This was a great solution.  I did burn the mustard seed the first time by accident, so reccomend that you watch that carefully, but otherwise really enjoyed this recipe!
