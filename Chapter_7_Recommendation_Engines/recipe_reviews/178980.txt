This recipe is okay.  It's fast, so that is nice, but the flavor isn't particularly strong.  If you are looking for a recipe that will cover the taste of the fish, this is probably not for you.    I broiled it instead of grilling it (10ish minutes in a hot oven, without flipping) and it worked fine.

Made this recipe as written.  I thought it was pretty bland.  Next time I will increase the amount of dijon mustard and perhaps add a drop or two of hot sauce.

This is good, maybe next time we will try adding lemon pepper for more taste.  Quick and easy, excellent for a light and tasty meal.
