very good - the kids all gobbled them up and asked for more. VERY easy to make. If yours got hard, it's because you let the sugar/syrup boil too long. Once it comes to a boil, take it off of the heat (the peanut butter still mixes nicely). My nephew said this is better than a Butterfinger. I might like a little more cornflake in it - I will use more cornflakes next time to test. Fun, easy, and good.

These are awesome!!  I made 2 batches.  The first one, I went by the recipe, the second, I used 1/3 cup of the corn syrup and 2/3 cup of powdered sugar with just a dash of vanilla.  They came out deliciously, chewy, oowie good!

These were easy to make, but you gotta love peanut butter.  They didn't really taste like Butterfingers to me and did not go over well with my six and four year olds.

These are good and chewy - a little too sweet. I had some melted chocolate I wanted to use and an open box of corn flakes that was getting neglected when I found this recipe. I was worried that they would taste 'cornflakey,' but they are just totally peanut buttery. I put a little more chocolate on the top than called for to use what I had. You'll want to cut them smallish, as they are very rich and sweet - and addictive. Thanks for the recipe! :)

these are great and easy to make! Love peanut buttery flavor. make sure you eat them at room temp to be able to chew them. Some people seem confused on the name--they are called peanut butter fingers not peanut butterfingers. I don't think the recipe writer thought they were like the candy bars at all. :) just a thought.

Couldn't be easier and delicious, too!  These went like hotcakes.  I crushed the cornflakes down a bit (not pulverized) and measured my 3 cus that way.  Also used creamy peanut butter - Great!

Very easy, and very similar to eating a butterfinger candy bar. I made these up quick while dinner was cooking which was good because I didn't have any space in the oven. First bite I didn't feel like it tasted like butterfinger, but once you start chewing it does. Yum! I ate many and usually can control myself when I make tasty treats, but not with this one :).

These were very good. I followed other suggestions and turned off the heat on the sugar mixture as soon as it came to a boil. I also replaced 1/2 cup of the milk chocolate with semisweet chocolate chips.

I probably would have given these 3 star but hubs liked them a lot so 4 stars it is.  I used creamy PB as that is what we prefer.  I also used half dark choc chips and half semi sweet choc chips.  They were really easy and quick.  The key must be to remove the pan from heat right after the syrup starts to boil to avoid rock-hard bars.  Anyway, I might make these again since they are fast and easy but would definitely stick to a more traditional PB bar made with powdered sugar for sharing.

Yum!  These are extremely sweet but still very good.  I took a plate of about 2/3 a pan to a friend's house for a dinner party.  I took a completely empty plate home and two of the women asked for the recipe.  Very much a hit!--I think I could've taken the entire pan with me!  The only recipe deviation I did was to use frosted flakes instead of cornflakes, which still works just fine.  I made them late last night and just left them in the fridge--definitely bring them back to room temp before trying to cut them, or you'll have a huge struggle on your hands!  Thanks for the recipe.

We all loved this! This reminded me of a recipe I have tried before however it was not bars- it was more like clusters. So I mixed all of the ingredients together and made them like the clusters. Then I cooled it in the fridge on wax paper. Fun alternative way!- Just like I remembered!

Absolute hit with my family! I am glad that I read the reviews before making this recipe. I took it off the stove as soon as it came to a boil. I crushed the corn flakes and added about 1/2 cup more flakes. I didn't have crunchy peanut butter, so i used creamy instead. Turned out perfect.

I make this quite often only I use Special K cereal and one cup of chocolate chips and one cup of butterscotch chips.  This is a great dish to make in the summer, as you don't have to turn the oven on.

I was skeptical about this recipe, but it turned out so good! hasn't lasted very long. This is definitely something I'll be making again! I used creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy (though I'm sure crunchy would be good) and I used Honey Bunches of Oats for the flake cereal.

Very yummy, nice and chewy and just sweet enough. I used natural peanut butter which I think cut down on the sweetness a few reviewers commented on.

These are so good. It's like eating a Butterfinger candy bar. I made this with homemade peanut butter and 7 grain wheat flake cereal. If you want to reduce the sugars, only reduce the granulated sugar. You need the corn syrup for the added moisture to be able to spread the mixture into the pan. Instead of using chocolate chips, I used 2 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 c. Smart Balance, 1/4 c. cocoa and 1 tsp. milk. One other hint: cut these before putting them into the fridge. My family loves these. Try them.

This recipe was great. They were hard when they were done chilling, as to be expected. We let them sit out for a bit, and gobbled them up. This will be a new fav. in our house. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!!

These are sooo good. I made these twice and they were gone fast both times. The second time I used double the chips because I personally think they needed more chocolate. The second time I overcooked the corn syrup and they were a little hard. The first time I had let the sugar and corn syrup just come to a boil and become clear then I removed it from the heat and added the peanut butter. They were perfect. I think I may have added in 3/4 sugar and 3/4 corn syrup by accident and they were a little better. If you like peanut butter and chocolate, give these a try. The hardest part is waiting for them to cool!

Excellent and rich!! Didn't really taste like a butterfinger to me.......maybe it's because I used smooth peanut butter, but I'm not in any way disappointed with the outcome. I was just looking for a recipe to use up some of my cornflakes! Glad I stumbled upon this recipe!

Wow.  These bars really DO taste just like Butterfingers.  And it's easy to make; the only slow part of the process is boiling the sugar and corn starch.

I'm going to have to disagree with everyone else and say these aren't really all that good, very strong peanut butter taste and very sweet, they were easy and turned out fine, looks wise, but the taste didn't agree with me at all. I didn't think they tasted anything like butterfinger candy bars.

Loved teh recipe as did my kids!  We area vegetarian chocoholic family, so we eats lots of peanut butter to add protein toour diet, plus it is one of the healthiest fats you can eat.  Yeah!  I used Total corn flakes which are jam packed with nutrients too, so I didn't really feel guilty serving these for dessert even though they taste sinfully good!!   Joan

These are very good, especially considering how easy they are to make. They're perfect when you want a very sweet treat. The peanut butter layer is deliciously chewy. I thought the chocolate layer was a little thick. Next time I might add an extra half recipe of peanut butter mixture but keep the amount of chocolate the same. I don't normally like chunky peanut butter but I'm glad I got it for this recipe. I don't usually like treats like this but I thought they were really good. My 2 1/2 year old took one bite and said "These are good!". But she wouldn't eat any more. Though she likes peanut butter and chocolate, they were just too rich for her. The person I made them for likes really sweet treats. I'm pretty sure he's going to REALLY like them. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

This bar does live up to the claim that it is quick and easy.  I was surprised how quick it was done. I wasn't sure if the cornflakes were supposed to be a crust or be mixed in with the peanut butter mixture.  So i kind of halfway mixed them.  I also took them out of the pan to cut them since they are hard when refridgerated.  I would equate them a little bit with scotcheroos with more peanut butter and more crunch.  They are pretty sweet so cut the bars small.

I followed the recipe as given and give it 4 stars for easy-to-make bars & okay results. I didn't have time to read through reviews before I made them. The bars were missing something... it just didn't have a "wow" flavor or texture for us.

First time I made this recipe as written, but found it a little bland. I added 1/2 tsp salt and a teaspoon of vanilla with the peanutbutter and substituted semi-sweet for the milk chocolate chips. Made a much better bar, and now it's my husband's second favorite sweet. It doesn't taste like butterfingers, but neither did the original recipe!

yummmm! Easy and quick.  I didn't melt the chocolate chips first, just layered them on top and let them melt on the warm mixture, then spread them out.

I don't think this tasted so much like a butterfinger as it did a really good pnb bar, it really didn't even need the chocolate on top because it was so good on it's own! YUMMY!

little fingers then dipped them. In this house one batch is not enough. They have become a family favorite already.
