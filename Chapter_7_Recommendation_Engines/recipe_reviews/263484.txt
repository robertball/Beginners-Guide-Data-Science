This was so easy. I made it exactly how the chef said and it came out fabulous. I also made it using whole wheat flour and it was amazing. I have made it multiple times and will continue to do so. Thanks a million

The Croissants are super! Some of the instructions of this recipe are unclear, an accompanying video with real instructions would be great. Using dark chocolate is also good for the recipe, they won't be as sweet, but I think that's a good change nowadays where most of our foods are loaded with calories. Shaping the croissants perfectly is kind of hard, so now don't look perfect, but I guess they taste just as well. I also left the rough in the fridge a day because it takes very long to make this recipe, but I guess that's fine too. 

Conclusion: Great Croissants!

These are so grand! I had to watch the video for the laminating (so very easy, just not easy to initially comprehend from instructions- that’s on me, not the instructions). They are so very very very flaky. And, I know you said we had to wait for them to cool. We just haven’t been able to wait yet. They smell soooo good coming out of the oven. Thanks for making this so easy and so incredibly good. Made exactly as written the first time. The second I had to adjust for 7000 ft  altitude (added 1 T water, reduced sugar by 1/2 T) because first batch was slightly dry dough, though they baked oh so well!

Thank you! Family enjoyed these. To be honest, for my part, they mostly served to fill an empty space in a relatively satisfactory way. I suspect the problem (apart from my inexperience) was the 8 by 8 inch butter slab (and corresponding dough rectangle) in this recipe. Really seemed to roll out pretty slim compared to other laminates I've experimented with. Butter was almost a smear! After baking these, I read your croissant recipe and noticed the measurements of butter and dough rectangles are identical to those in this recipe but with twice the amounts of each to work with. Was this intentional? I think I'll try your croissant recipe tomorrow and I suspect with a slab of butter twice the thickness to start with, the result will be improved. Appreciate the humor in your videos. My wife and I chuckle over just about any of them we watch :)

I have made these twice so far.  First time I was making the regular croissants (also very good) and saved half the dough in the freezer.  I did not think I would like Chocolate Croissants as much.  I was wrong.  The ratio in this recipe is perfect!  The first time I rolled the dough with the butter slab I panicked with the butter started to squirt out the sides, and a few croissants kept trying to unroll themselves as they continued to rise on the sheet.  The end product was still delicious and (I think) reasonably attractive.  I took them to a winery for a picnic.  Thanks Chef John!  I wanted to try to make croissants for a while but was scared off until I saw your video.
