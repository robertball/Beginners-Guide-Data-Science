Not sure if the original is worth a 5, but I altered the recipe which is why I'm giving it a 5.
I used 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast, 1/2 tsp sugar 1/2 cup warm water, 1 cup plus 4 Tbsp flour, 1 Tbsp Oil, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp oregano 1/2 tsp basil, and 2 Tbsp Parmesan cheese.  All I can say is YUM YUM...straight from the lips and onto the hips!!!

These were good, easy rolls... nothing spectacular, but definitely a good recipe to have around when you want to whip up some quick rolls for dinner.  I added parmesan cheese to the batter, which was very good.  I just want to know-- in what world does this recipe make 8 rolls???  I made 12, & I filled the muffin cups almost to the top!!

This is the only bread recipe that I can do with awesome results.  It is the easiest and the quality of the rolls are great, especially during the holidays. I have also made more than the recipe calls for.  I suggest using a 12 muffin tin.  I have used different herbs that I like such as thyme, and rosemary when I make them with a roasted chicken. Experiment with the recipe.  And make sure to place this one in your recipe box, because people will be asking for the recipe.

These were very good rolls, and I gratefully extend my thanks to the author. However, there are a few pointers I'd like to share which may help other readers:  1) You may need to add more herbs, they could've used a "kick"  2) I used my 6-muffin jumbo tin and it worked well;I would not have have enough batter for the 12-muffin tin, unless I made these super small, and if you do that, what's the point? 3) Don't drop them by spoonfuls into the tins - wet your hand and grab blobfuls, it's much easier!  This recipe is a keeper and we enjoyed them last night with spaghetti & meatballs.

Surprisingly good.  I'm used to garlic herbed rolls and these were on the sweeter, lighter side.  A nice change from the typical herbed roll.  Be prepared for very gooey batter but they rose well and baked sooner than the time allotted for.  I only needed to spray cooking oil (Pam) in the muffin pan and they didn't stick at all.  Everyone loved it and they were very quick.  I love how it didn't require kneading and only used one bowl.

These are very easy to make. Cross between a biscuit and a hearty dinner muffin. It went well with the Italian Sausage Soup on this site. I did 'tweek' it a bit on the spices, I added parmesan cheese (from the can), Italian seasoning and garlic powder instead of sage, tarrogon, and nutmeg due to having an Italian dinner. But the basis of this recipe IS a keeper! I'm sure with different meals, your mind could go wild and the list could be endless.

There is no doubt that this is one of the best rolls recipes I have ever had.  My husband almost prefered the rolls over the main course.  This recipe will definately be used again and again.  Thank you for the recipe, I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!

These were easy to make considering it was my first experience with a yeast rising bread. In fact my eleven yr. old daughter helped me make them. The texture of the rolls were very good, almost a cross between a biscuit and a roll. I think I'll try a different combo of spices next time as the sage, nutmeg flavor wasn't my favorite. Will try with rosemary or maybe dill.

I tried this recipe and made some changes like using basil, chives and dill. They were yummy the first day but the second day they just don't seem as moist and they were in a sealed container.

I can't imagine any easier roll recipe, and this is easy and good enough to whip up for guests.  I didn't have sage and substituted Italian seasoning.  I would imagine this recipe is a good jumping off place for many herb combinations.  I got 9 rolls out of the recipe, but I would try for 12 next time because I thought they were a little too big.

I wanted to make some rolls to go with "Penne with Shrimp" also found here (great recipe BTW), and came across these little gems. I also knew I wanted batter rolls but I've been advised by my doctor to add more whole wheat breads to my diet so I proceeded to alter these rolls accordingly. (BTW I decided to change the flavor profile to match the dinner I was having!) Just so you know I increased the serving size to 12, therefore the following amounts correspond to that number: used a ratio of 1-1/4 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup AP flour, added 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese, added 1 Tbsp. Italian seas. and 1 tsp. garlic powder, used 1 tsp. reg. salt and 1/2 tsp. onion salt, used required amount but sub'd light margarine for butter, used 6 Tbsp. liquid egg substitute for 1-1/2 eggs, used only 2 Tbsp. sugar and omitted the nutmeg, sage and tarragon. I ended up getting 24 medium-sized rolls. They didn't rise very much so next time I might add back that other Tbsp. of sugar, but otherwise they turned out great. I'm sure I'll be making them again soon. Thanks for the recipe and the inspiration.

I really love nutmeg. It's my favorite spice. But it didn't taste very good in these at all. These rose nice and had a good texture, but I'll omit the nutmeg next time.

I would give these a 3.5 if I could. They had good flavor and were super easy, but the texture was a little strange for a dinner roll. Good base recipe...you can definitely change this one around to suit your own tastes and if you're looking for something quick this is it.

VERY easy to make, and a wonderful herby flavor.  I knocked one star off only b/c the texture to me wasn't like a roll or biscuit.  It was almost more like bread - very airy and fluffy.  The lack of density is what I missed.  But the taste is outstanding.  My family loved them.

I would give it 5 stars, but I just don't feel I am an expert on breads or rolls yet. 

Here's the scoop. I've recently been the lucky recipient of a beautiful stand mixer (gift from the hubby). We started (desperately trying) to make bread, and no success!!

So, I said to my BORED 14 year old son..."why don't you show us how it's done?". I suggested he puts his parents bread making efforts to shame.

The first batch (yes he made two batches the same day) he asked me a couple of questions. Do I just crack the egg in the bowl, is this smooth and how long should it rise? 

He made the first batch 97% on his own. 

The recipe says to scoop into 8 muffin cups. THEY WERE HUGE!

The 3 kids and I chomped them down! But wait, dad didn't get any yet! 

So my son moved on to a second batch. 100% on his own. It made 11 this time. (I think 10 makes them the perfect size)

They are delish to us! The flavor is great. I think mom will try them next time and expirement with a little fresh grated parm cheese & herbs on top.

Oh, one more thing, about 1/2 way through cooking we brushed them with melted (real butter)

ENJOY!

I loved these! They were moist... I loved the herbs. I didn't change the recipe at all and left it the way it was. I don't think I would do anything differently. The cooking time was more like 12-13 minutes on my end. And even then they turned out a little more brown then I would have liked. But they were still so good!

I made these rolls for dinner one night. They were good, but they weren't the best dinner rolls I've ever tried.  My family liked them they smelt really good while baking. Super easy to make!! I'll probably make them again because they were so easy.

My children all loved these! Excellent base recipe for rolls. I did add garlic powder, rosemary and parmesan. These would also be super with cheddar cheese inside. Could use a bit more salt and tiny bit less sugar. But they were delicious. The kids liked the muffin shape, My husband did not (he usually hates sweets--I think there was a connection he made)

These came out just lovely. But, of course, I wouldn't be an Allrecipes reviewer if I didn't have to admit to changing a few things. I used a tablespoon of italian seasoning instead of the recommended seasoning, 1/2 a tablespoon of garlic powder (and next time plan to use real minced garlic, just to experiment), and about an ounce of fresh grated parm reggiano. The rolls came out perfect and delicious, nice and herb-y. I am very pleased.

Good base for great rolls, would go good with soup or stew. Gonna try to sub the herbs for parm cheese and garlic powder and italian seasoning. Very tasty, smell up the kitchen pretty good. Plus easy and you have most of the ingredients in your pantry...

I made these rolls last night for a family Christmas celebration.  They had a good flavor, but they seemed to be a little heavy.  I prefer a lighter yeast roll.  For the amount of time they take though, they are worth the effort.  Good recipe.

These were way too soupy I made them in a  bread machine and had to add almost twice as much flour . . . trust me, I thought I checked closely, but guess not.  Once the extra flour was added, there was not enough seasoning to flavor the rolls.  Too much work for lackluster flavor.  Gave it a three because the error was possibly my fault.

These are awesome! My whole family gobbles them down. I however omit the sage, terragon and nutmeg and add different spices such as sun dried tomato & herb,  dill, onion etc based on what I am serving them with. The basic recipe is perfect for any type of bun or bread. The only other thing I change is to use bread flour instead of all purpose flour. I have also used it to make a loaf for garlic bread. This one is definitely staying in my recipe box!

We didn't like these at all.  Extremely heavy and dense, a cross between a biscuit and a muffin.  Flavor wasn't that hot either.  Won't make them again, sorry.

These were delicious.  I realized half way into baking that I had no eggs so I just added a tbs. of baking soda.  I also added some spinach and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.  They smelled wonderful and were not very dense at all.  4 stars only because the original recipe would probably be too bland for me.

My second time working with yeast. I got a little nervous because the dough really never rose but I went ahead and put the dough into a 6 jumbo muffin tin kept them on top of the stove covered while the oven preheated and they finally GREW. I guess they needed more warmth. Put them in the oven and they came out beautiful. Nice and golden and delicious. Tarragon is my favorite herb so I will definitely keep this recipe in my recipe collection. Thankyou.

These were really good like another reviewer noted they are like a cross between a dinner roll and a muffin but they are delicious. Can't wait to make them again with other spices.

I did make changes - omitted the nutmeg, used Italian  seasoning (dried herb mix), dried onion, garlic powder instead of the herbs in the recipe. I didn't like reading that the texture was muffin-like so increased yeast to 1 and 1/2 Tbsp to make texture lighter. I will definitely make this again.

Great rolls! Next time I will change up the seasoning a bit, but the rolls had a very good texture.

I love the fact that this recipe does not require kneading the dough but...I didn't care for the texture.  I wanted more of a fluffy roll.  This was more like a biscuit.
