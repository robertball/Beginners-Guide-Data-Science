This is really an excellent recipe.  I've had split pea soup before, but have never really loved it.  I bought some kielbasa on special this week and was looking for a good recipe to try.  This was perfect!  My husband and I both agree we will never have "regular" split pea soup again.  Here is what I changed in the recipe: used chicken broth instead of beef, and used turkey kielbasa instead of regular.  It was fantastic.  I did have to add a fair amount of water; the recipe didn't say to cover the pot while simmering so some of the liquid boiled off.  Next time, I'll be sure to cover it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really enjoyed this version of split pea soup. My mom always made it with ham
hocks when I was growing up, but I was trying to find something with more meat
flavor in it. This was perfect! My family loved it, including my 17-month-old son.
I plan to stick with this recipe whenever I make split pea soup in the future. Yum!

We started the peas cooking on their own, then browned the sausage and onion, with a clove of garlic, and drained the grease.  Judging by the amount of fat we poured off, I'm glad we did, or the soup would have been too greasy.  Then we poured the peas in and finished them cooking with everything and pureed everything pretty smooth in the food processor at the end.  Delicious!

This soup had great flavor, but (I don't know what I did wrong...) I could not get a good consistency. I followed the recipe as directed and got the last instruction that said "simmer until peas are soft but NOT mushy." I had never made split pea soup before, so I did not expect that it would take 2 HOURS for the peas to get soft. The liquid kept evaporating so I added more water periodically (make sure you cover with a lid), but I was never quite sure what the "soft but not mushy" consistency was supposed to be. When I have eaten split pea soup before it was very smooth, but was this supposed to be a little chunky? I cooked until I thought the peas were done but was very frustrated by the unexpected length of time it took (we ate a late dinner last night). The taste was enjoyable and we liked the kielbasa sausage flavor, but we did not like the consistency of the soup. Perhaps I did something wrong, but I wanted to write this in case anyone else comes across this problem.

Used 3 cans of low sodium beef broth and 1 cup of water.  Left out the bay leaf. Did not puree meat at beginning, just blended everything at the end with the stick blender.  Did not need to add extra salt.  Served with Double Quick dinner rolls from this site. Very good.

Delicious, nutritious, economical, easy!  My substitutions: two Knorr bouillon cubes and 4 cups water in place of broth, Summer sausage in place of kielbasa sausage, 16 oz yellow split peas, omitted bay leaf and salt.  I also added extra water to thin soup, it was very thick.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch.  Thanks R. Austin!

A lot of good flavor considering how simple this recipe is. I used yellow split peas and a 32 ounce box of chicken broth, but otherwise followed the recipe. I found I did not need to add salt. I recommend no extra salt until the soup is cooked and you can taste for seasoning.

This was a very good recipe. I gave it only 4 stars for a couple of reasons. First, the amount of broth needed to be almost tripled to make it soup consistency. Also, the puree of sausage and broth was rather gross looking. We also found that if we put the soup in the food processor after it was all done, that we liked it better. It is a low fat - low calorie split pea soup which is a good alternative to those soups with cream or potato added. We will make this again with the changes noted.

Great comfort food and easy on the budget.  I soaked the peas covered in water overnight.  Just left it on the counter and then rinsed them in the morning.  Like others, I also used chicken stock and omitted the salt.

This was exceptionally good soup. I will cut down on the sausage next time I make it, though. But very, very good.

This recipe is simply amazing! I LOVE the use of the sausage over the ham... such a neat variation! We couldn't eat enough of this! I've made it several times, twice in a normal pot and once in the pressure cooker, and all were perfect. I liked the idea of making it with kielbasa so much I also tried it with lentils rather than split peas and added some spinach and diced tomatoes. 6 Minutes on high pressure in the pressure cooker and it was amazing! Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was fantastic. My kids even liked it. I use low sodium broth. I never add salt to this recipe. The sausage and chicken broth is already plenty salty. If I use regular broth then it becomes to salty.

I used chicken broth instead of beef and added 2 stalks of chopped celery with the carrot.  Also pureed about a half cup of frozen spinach with the sausage and broth.  Added a few dashes of crushed red pepper to add a little spice.  Really good.  The sausage (I used turkey sausage) added a nice flavor, I liked it better than the normal ham flavor.  Will try adding some potato next time.

Loved using the sausage vs ham hocks.  I cut back a little on amount of sausage but was still very flavorful.  Didn't need to add salt at all!  So simple, won't ever go back to the ham and hocks recipe. JR

I was a little impatient with this recipe. It took quite a while for the peas to cook.  It tasted really good though and smelled even better. It's just not my favorite. I didn't puree the sausage or anything. It did taste good though.

This is the first time I've tried Split Pea Soup. I didn't have any beef broth so I made it with chicken broth. It still came out great. I enjoyed it and will make it again.

This turned out really good.  I did not make the puree, and I ended up having to add more liquid to this at the end.  But that is probably because my bag of split peas was 16 oz.  And I added a dash of garlic to it.  Really good, and we will make this again.

Very tasty. I used chicken broth instead of beef. Added a few more spices, such as parsley, garlic, thyme, and oregano. Would have been 5 stars if the consistency was better. I followed the recipe and made the adjustments other people said and this was not a thick and creamy soup at all. Next time I will stick with the crock pot version.

Made this recipe and it turned out awesome.  I used a Jalapeno Cheddar Elk Kielbasa my dad's friend that was fairly crumbly, and added a bit of red curry powder instead of salt and pepper.

I personally don't like split pea soup but I made this for my husband who does. He loved it! Almost convinced me to try it! Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely be making it again. Oh, and I used chicken broth instead of beef and left out the carrots.

There is a review from 2001 which means this recipe is at least 18 years old. I left the ingredients as is but decided give the cooking method an update. After reading all of the reviews carefully, the two biggest complaints were not enough liquid  and long cook time. My solution to both of these was to use the Instant Pot. All of the broth would be sealed in and not evaporate while the peas cooked and the peas would also cook much faster. Instead of 2 14 ounce cans of beef broth, I did use a 32 ounce carton but that was the only change I made to start with. I didn't want to puree the sausage but I did and it worked. I used the saute setting to brown the sausage and onions and then added everything else to the pot including the pureed sausage and closed and locked the lid. I did high pressure for 35 minutes and then let the pressure release naturally. The consistency was definitely not soup like and I ended up adding 3-4 cups of water to get it there. So, the soup does need more liquid than the recipe calls for. I also thought it could have used more carrots. Another thing I will mention is the leftovers. The peas keep absorbing the liquid in the fridge overnight and I ended up having to add even more water the next day. Thankfully the sausage puree gave it enough flavor that the taste wasn't affected by all of the added water.  Overall good recipe but plan on needing more liquid than the recipe calls for.

Liked this a lot! Nice twist to your split pea soup. But I mixed some of the steps up: I started with the carrots, onion in the broth and brought to a boil. i skipped the purée step altogether and just cut the kielbasa up in small pieces. I the added it to the boiling broth, and added the split peas.  Still got mushy and wasn't the most pretty of dishes but I have yet to see a "pretty" split pea soup recipe.  Taste was great and would make again.

I didn’t have all the stuff so I used chicken broth and a couple of potatoes. I guess it was split pea potato soup with kielbasa. Very good and easy to put together

I tried this recipe in the slow-cooker today and it was wonderful! I chopped the onions and sauteed them in a skillet until tender, then added my sliced smoked sausage to the skillet to brown it a little before adding about a quarter of that mixture to the blender with some of the broth (I used chicken broth instead of beef). Then I just added all the ingredients to the slow-cooker and cooked on low for 6 hours. The peas DID turn out mushy, but that's just how I like it. If you prefer yours to be more firm, you could just cut the cooking time a bit. I made cornbread to go with it and my husband and 6-year-old daughter devoured everything! I will definitely be making this again. I will probably try it with homemade chicken broth next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was super tasty! I made a few modifications like everyone else. I combined this recipe with the recipe that was on the back of the bag of split green peas I used to make this soup. I used 1lb of split green peas, 1 cup diced frozen carrots, 3 small potatoes, ½ cup fresh celery. I also threw in 15oz of bush’s baked beans, and 1.5 cups of 2% milk. I added in 2 little cubes of chicken flavored bullion in the beginning to a boiling 4-5 cups of water. I also added in 1 smoked chicken sausage and a can of ready-made split pea soup to thicken the soup up along with 1 tsp of salt.

I went by the recipe. I only added water to the consistency that I wanted. The best I have ever made. Family loved it! And it was exactly perfect for brutally cold night. Don't forget your favorite bread!

This recipe was delicious. The only difference is I used Mustard Greens instead of Spinach and Chicken Broth instead of Water. I cooked it on top of the stove also. It was incredible!!!
