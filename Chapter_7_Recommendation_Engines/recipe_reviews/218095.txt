AWESOME! I don't usually go back and review but I had to for this recipe.  I made the recipe for 1 serving so just halfed the ingredients, but I used fat free cream cheese, egg substitute, and added some splenda.  I got 3 great size pancakes out of it, and I added mini chocolate chips to one, banana to another, and blueberries to the 3rd. YUMMY.  All for 125 calories!!  Thanks so much for the recipe idea.  I can't wait to make it again!!

This was a welcome relief from having eggs and bacon for breakfast on my low carb diet.  I inadvertently poured all the egg into the cream cheese but using a whisk took care of the lumps. I do agree with another reviewer though and really like the lumps in the mixture (nothing like having a nice bite of cream cheese in this lovely recipe).   I held the butter (used Pam in the frying pan).  Then used the butter for topping and some Splenda instead of a sugar-free syrup since I didn't have any in the house.  Tasted like french toast with the Splenda added.  Great alternative to bacon and eggs, thank you!

********Edited to add that I made this again but made one large crepe, covered the pan so it would cook through on med heat.  When done, I added 1/2 cup of fresh crushed blueberries mixed with some Splenda and rolled it into a crepe and topped it with sugar free cool whip.  A great low carb Blueberry Crepe dessert!  Any low carb fresh berry would work for filing, strawberries, blackberries, etc.  What a wonderful treat to have.  ..................Also last night I was looking to make something a tad different and used 2 tablespoons of sugar free Orange Marmalade (sweetened with Splenda).  When the crepe was halfway through cooking, I dropped the marmalade on top.  As it heats, it does spread some.  Rolled it up, dotted with the butter and topped with sugar free Cool Whip, a nice change of pace with a nice light taste.

Wow, just got done eating them and they tasted wonderful!  I didn't have time to wait for the cream cheese to soften which did give me some lumps but I kind of like seeing the lumps of cream cheese in my pancake crepe.  I used an electric hand mixer to mix all ingredients and it worked great!  With low carbing I get sick of eggs and typical egg breakfast dishes so I was really excited to try this and I was not disappointed.  Thank you!
Note: I have now discovered that putting the ingredients in a small blender to blend works great and takes care of any problems with lumps.  It mixes it up into a smooth batter.

My husband has been craving enchiladas so I turned this recipe into a savory tortilla.  Added salt, pepper and oregano.  Then mixed cooked pork meat, cheese, small amounts of green chilis and onion, and heated it through.  Then rolled up two tablespoons on top of 1 "tortilla" and topped it with a small amount of sour cream.  We both loved it.

Simple to make and delicious.  I used strawberry cream cheese and didn't add the cinnamon or sweetener.  The first one I made was a standard crepe size, then I did tablespoons, then 1/8th cup measures.  The crepe size was a beautiful thing to behold, but I really didn't want to struggle with getting another one out of the pan, hence the experiments.  The 1/8th cup measured crepes were easy to manage out of the pan and the size looked nice on a plate.  You could fold these in half over fruit or jam and they would be a welcoming sight.  Next time I'll add a photo; but this time they're all gone!  :-)  Thanks for sharing!

These were delicious. I filled them with a cottage cheese, vanilla and sweetener mixture along with fresh strawberries. I did not have syrup for the crepe, so I just used sweetener. I also made a savory one, like a tortilla by omitting the syrup and cinnamon, then I filled it with cheese for a quesadilla. YUM!

I joined just to review this! These were FABULOUS, and I'm a major crepe and pancake snob! This hits the low-carb spot when you're aching for some pancakes. I didn't use any sugar substitute and they came out yummy and savory. If you want sweet without the sugar substitutes you can spread some preserves or jam, or have them with cheese. The only bad part was when they were finished!

These are great but I have a tip that I couldn't keep to myself! if you put a tight fitting lid on during the cooking process,the mixture "puffs" up a little!

these are amazing! instead of using sugar free syrup, i added splenda brown sugar into the batter and also topped it with a little bit. i didn't want to wait for the cream cheese to soften to try this, so i also wound up with chunks, but i think it made it taste even better. i'm new to low-carb so this was a lifesaver!

I've cut the bread, pasta and rice which leaves me with limited options. I'm so happy to say that this recipe is a five star keeper with no modifications needed! The great thing about this recipe is you can change the flavor profile for variety. You could add flavored cream cheese/syrup for a change of pace. Omit the cinnamon and add in savory herbs, spread with hummus, or avocado, add in turkey & fillings to make a lunch wrap. (be gentle though because it can be rather fragile). Also, I find that Walden Farms makes a huge variety & the best tasting sugar-free syrup, which can be found in any health-food store.
UPDATE: Made these for the hubs & daughter & they loved it! He HATES yolks- scrambled eggs (egg whites only), mayonnaise, aioli, hollandaise, etc. But he LOVED the crepes. I coated a 12" pan with the batter, once cooked on one side slid it onto a plate and flipped it back into the pan to maintain a pretty & perfect large, but thin crepe. I cooked it through then let it cool a tad. I added sugar-free cool whip and wrapped it, then drizzled Walden Farms sugar-free blueberry syrup. YUM!

Great recipe base. I substituted cream cheese with NF Cottage Cheese. Added Stevia, Vanilla and a scoop of Protein Powder. Blended everything in my Vitamix and viola...yummy high protein, no carb crepes!

delicious...even when I am not doing low carb, I think I will stick to this recipe.  It's was very easy. I softened the cream cheese in the microwave, added all of it plus the eggs to my kitchen aid and let it do the work. I then added the cinnamon and a tbl of splenda instead of the syrup.  I doubled the recipe and it was plenty for my husband and I to be full from breakfast and my son had one too!

I followed the recipe exactly.  Microwaved a half bag of unsweetened mixed berries for a minute until the berries were thawed and juicy, stirred in a teaspoon of Splenda and poured the berries and juice over the crepes.  If you are low carbing, this does satisfy those Sunday morning pancake cravings! Very good. One tip--use small omelet pan and learn to do the pancake flip without using a spatula!  They will hold their shape better!

Just made these this morning. I didn't have cinnamon & I didn't have sugar free syrup. I had to improvise... I doubled the recipe (which makes way more than you'd think!) and substituted a teaspoon of vanilla & a packet of Splenda for my missing cinnamon & syrup. I'm happy I had to! They were so delicious! Nice alternative on my low carb diet. Using the extra crepes later filled with shredded chicken for dinner

I am so picky about trying new recipes. I am trying to learn new low carb recipes and trust me, this one is excellent! Easy ingredients, easy to make, and delicious! I couldn't believe it!  Thanks so much for sharing! I would love to modify this to create a wrap or taco shells or something!

Such a great recipe! I made a few modifications but overall this was surprisingly delicious and perfect for my low-carb diet.

I used 4 oz cream cheese (softened in the microwave), mixed in 2 eggs, pumpkin pie spice, and 1 packet of splenda. I topped it with a scoop of ricotta cheese, a sprinkle of cinnamon, and fresh berries. (see photo)

Next time I will try adding vanilla and maybe another packet of splenda since it could have been a little bit sweeter for my taste.

Thanks for the recipe! Will absolutely make again and again!

Fantastic!!!!  I made it exactly as directed except I mixed it all with my Kitchenaid and I softened the cream cheese a bit in the microwave.  I topped mine with warmed suger free jam and whipped cream.  They do no roll very well witout breaking so I stacked mine one on top of the other.

From the first bite of this I was hooked! I've tried several different variances of this recipe and they've all turned out great. When I was in a hurry, I would use whipped cream cheese and it would blend really smoothly. When I wanted a lower calorie meal, I'd substitute the normal cream cheese for fat free cream cheese and use egg whites with no butter. And lastly, this makes a yummy savory meal if you decide to add meat and salsa to it. Very versatile and extremely easy!! Thanks so much for sharing this, chazmataz!

These came a lot closer to tasting like real pancakes than I expected. I just dumped everything in the blender and the batter came out silky smooth. They cooked up just like pancakes too, flip them over when the bubbles form on the surface. The yield was a little small, I ate the entire recipe (a bit over 600 calories) by myself. A big guy or hungry teen could put down a double recipe no problem, so adjust as necessary when serving a crowd.

As a type 1 diabetic who also has celiac disease and can't eat flour, these low-carb crepes completely rock my world! To keep them even more low-carb and to add even more to the already-amazing flavor, we've been substituting Davinci toasted marshmallow sugar free syrup for the 'regular' sugar free syrup (which is still loaded with carbs). I am not sure I can put in words how amazing these crepes are! With a bit of peanut butter and whipped topping, they sort of make you want to melt into happy oblivion...

Since I avoid all breads while "low-carbing", this recipe was quite handy. I omitted the sugar-free syrup and cinnamon though and stuffed the crepe with sausage, cheese, and a dash of hotsauce for a "Breakfast Taco".

I make these almost every morning! So good...I don't make them like crepes, just like pancakes...and they are super good...I usually use equal amounts of cream cheese and eggs....as well as add a packet of Splenda to the mix with the cinnamon.  Very very good!

These were AMAZING!  I have been missing bread on this low carb diet so these crepes hit the spot.  I made them without the syrup or cinnamon.  I like them better plain.  I just put butter on them and scarfed them down.  They are tricky to flip...be sure there is some butter or oil on the pan for each one.  I plan to use them for chicken crepes also.

These crepes are fantastic!  I enjoyed them with fresh cucumbers for a tasty low carb breakfast. Make sure your cream cheese is really soft before you start so that it is easier to mix into the egg.

Whipped these bad boys up in the Vitamix to avoid the lumps. I'm amazed that cream cheese and eggs make pancakes! Delish!

I'm doing the Atkins diet and having to find food that makes my mouth happy again. This was amazing!!! I went to add vanilla extract, but it was almond extract! Tastey accident!! I also added a packet of Splenda to the batter and put the syrup on top instead of in it. This will be my fallback sweet treat!!

Delicious and filling.  Made with a single egg used whipped cream cheese (may have made mixing easier)  also used splenda brown sugar as a sweetener added blueberries before folding topped with whipped cream. Added to my recipe box.  Soooo good!
THANK YOU

I tried this recipe because we are eating wheat-free. I made these exactly as stated the first time and they were quite thin and hard for me to flip, but they were tasty. I have been looking for more of a traditional type pancake, (higher carbs using oats), because my kids really wanted something that tasted like the old pancakes they loved. 2nd time, (feeding 3 hungry teens/girls), I used 6 eggs, 4 oz. cream cheese, 3/4 cup quick oats (ground), 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 2 tablespoons maple syrup. I mixed cheese and eggs first, then remaining ingredients and let it set up for 10-15 min. It got thick like pancake batter. Off the griddle, I added fresh fruit with a little more syrup and they were amazing!! I wanted to try freezing them, but there were none left! Like other posters, I can't wait to omit the sweet stuff and experiement with other spices using them as a wrap or tortilla for chicken, etc. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I am a dietitian who has eats low-carb.  My husband and I LOVED these!  I mixed 4 oz ricotta cheese, 2 oz sour cream, 2 oz cream cheese and 2 T whipping cream for a filling, then tossed a few blueberries inside.  Heaven on a plate!

We really miss pancakes, being low carb, so I tried these. We loved them yes they are eggy but they have eggs in them so I guess you'll taste that. They were good with sugar free maple syrup and also as a crepe. Filled with low carb filling I think, they are great. I will experiment by adding some diced onion to the batter for the savory crepe.

I am impressed more by the fact that I can have 'pancakes' without completely blowing my diet.  I used lite syrup and whipped cream cheese as that is what I had.  I used egg beaters to save a few more calories.  I omitted the butter and used Pam instead.  I made a couple with mini semi sweet choc chips folded in the middle and a cople with strawberry preserves.  I loved the choc chips and the kiddos loved the preserves ones.  Will mae again with fat free cream cheese.  Don't expect actual pancakes here- more like crepes as the title suggests- but still delicious.  I think I will try some with splenda brown sugar in addition to the cinnamon next time.

simply delicious! I followed the directions the same, except I used fat free cream cheese. These smell and taste just like french toast when you add the cinnamon and the syrup. I will definitely be making these more often!

LOVE THESE "PANCREPES"! I would definitely say these are crepe-like pancakes, hence my naming of them. They have the consistency of a crepe but are sweeter like a pancake, and delightful! I used my emulsion blender to incorporate the cream cheese and it worked like a charm. I made regular pancakes for my husband and kids and these for myself. Although they all tried mine and actually really liked them! 
I also must recommend my absolute favorite sugar & carb free syrup- Walden Farms Pancake Syrup. It's so good I have no idea what they do but it has no aftertaste and is perfectly sweet!  On top of these "pancrepes" it was absolute perfection.

I made it with what I had on hand.  I used regular Phili cream cheese in the tub and maple syrup in the mix.  I ate them without any topping and they were delicious.  I will definitely make them again.

I had to modify this recipe slightly but they were absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any cinnamon so substituted a generous pinch each of cloves and nutmeg.  I also didn't have any of the syrup so improvised using a teaspoon of honey...result? = YUMALICIOUS!  I kept the plate warm in the oven and added the pancakes as I was making them but in retrospect it would have been better to eat them as they were made.  Totally brilliant for a Sunday brunch but too time consuming I think for weekday breakfasts, even so these are my new favourite thing to eat at the weekends.

I can see now why this is called a "pancake crepe" instead of just a crepe. Mine puffed up light and fluffy, not at all the taste or texture of a crepe, but rather just a cheese omelet. I omitted the sugar syrup to keep the carbs down.

As many of you have commented, the egg routine was getting old! I tried this and absolutely loved it.  Made it exactly as called for but eliminated the syrup until it was cooked. Since I did not have sugar free syrup, I drizzled a few drops of maple syrup and it was delicious!  Will make it part of my low carb breakfasts!

If you have been missing out on pancakes this is the recipe to use. A keeper for sure. I recommend cream cheese at room temperature before mixing with eggs. If you want it a little sweeter add half teaspoon more of syrup. Thanks for the recipe

They're OK. Still very "eggie." I ate them plain, so they'd be much better with jam, but then they wouldn't be low card.

Made this with ricotta cheese instead of cream cheese. very good. I suggest make silver dollar sized cakes as they tend to break apart easy when flipping. Definetly a keeper. next time I'm trying it with Marscapone. MMMMM

Very good....I used a hand blender to mix the ingredients, which worked very well to remove cream cheese clumps.   Excellent results.

It's quite good - not quite like with wheat flour, but then it's very low carb.  I like crepes with berries, cottage cheese and (sugar-free) syrup; these work very well with that combo.  I've made them twice; the second time I added just a bit of buckwheat flour, and I don't think it improved them, so I'd stick with the basic recipe.  I find that they need a reasonably hot pan to cook well.  They come out thin enough to fold around the cottage cheese, which is nice.

These were so good! I didn't have syrup so I subbed 1 tsp light brown sugar and topped them with strawberries. I also snuck in some ground flax seed to add fiber. I was able to get 4 crepes out of this recipe

pretty good flavor for a low-carb, nearly sugar free, crepe/pancake. The consistency is kind of weird though, especially if you are expecting it to be like a crepe.

Overall, I would make it again.

These were good, but not as good as I expected from reading the reviews. I did follow the recipe exactly except for subbing a packet of Splenda for the syrup because it is all I had. I put  a few fresh blueberries on top of them before flipping and that added a lot to the flavor. They did taste a little eggy, and that was my main complaint. Still they were good enough to make again sometime and tinker with the recipe a little bit and see if I can improve them. It did end my sugar craving for the night, so thanks for that!

I don't know how this works. I don't know why this works. But, Oh, momma. These were wonderful and made in about 10 minutes. I threw the cream cheese into my food processor straight from the fridge, 1/3 cup liquid egg whites, threw in cinnamon & 1 tsp Splenda. Used cooking spray in skillet. Saved the butter, sugar free syrup for on top of pancakes, added 1/2 cup mixed fresh berries (blue/rasp/black). Oh my goodness. To the person who thought this was too eggie--I don't like that either, and the egg whites only made them very light and not at all eggie. Or eggy. Your choice. :)

Thanks for this delicious recipe! I made it exactly as written and it was the perfect fix for my pancake craving. I  topped with sugar free syrup and plan to try other variances as other reviewers have suggested. So happy to have found a low carb alternative to breads.

I thought these were really good....I topped with fresh blueberries, mashed with a fork and heated.  Tasted like blueberry crepes.  It was a wonderful change from my normally bland, low carb diet.

This is my first review although I've used this site for around 8 years.  I've been trying  low carb recipes, but never care for the way they turn out. The best recipes are regular recipes that I adapt to low carb. These "pancakes", however, are delicious. I made them exactly as directed  and was pleasantly surprised. It didn't taste eggy.  I'm so happy I tried this.

These were very tasty, but hard to flip over. Mine broke into several pieces. I topped mine with frozen blueberries that I heated in the microwave for a few seconds with a tiny bit of honey and lemon juice to make a syrup. My daughter said it tasted similar to french toast.

DELICIOUS!! This is one of the best low carb breakfast options I've ever tried.  I get tired of eggs and bacon.  This makes me feel like I'm eating a decadent meal every time I make it all while getting my protein.  Even if I wasn't doing low carb, I would still make this.

I made this just as described.   my husband who is a very picky eater loved them.  his words were "they were perfect.  more filling than regular pancakes, please make them again"    I am the one dieting and he is not so for him I took a bit of heavy cream and strawberry cream cheese as a spead.   for me I used a bit if heavy cream blue berries.  this may very well become the new special breakfast in our house.

Began my low carb diet with daughter who came for breakfast and made this dish.  If you're tired of looking at scrambled eggs, boiled eggs and want something different AND delicious...try this.  She asked me to take the cream cheese out of the fridge to soften overnight which made the mixing process very easy.  We topped it with blueberries and sugarless syrup over a sweetened cream cheese with a touch of vanilla flavoring.  Loved it!!

These are great!  I've been craving something sweet and something that resembles "real" food for a while now. This recipe hit the spot. Subtle sweetness, low carb, gluten free.  Thank you.

These are very good. But, They are really difficult to work with. They fall apart when you attempt to flip them. They taste great though!

I was amazed at how tummy these pancakes turned out. To get the mix well blended I used my stick blender and it turned out very smooth and pourable. Also, I have made it with 1/3 less fat cream cheese and egg product (it's all I had around) and it turned out great. The most important step is to butter your pan or they will stick, even in a non-stick pan.

I've made just a few small tweaks to this  recipe, but it's a keeper!
For us low-carbers and paleos out there, this is a real treat that comes mighty close to that familiar ol' sensation of eating a real pancake - only healthier for us, and  full of protein, too!  
To make it even healthier yet, I used only one egg plus 1/4 C egg whites, then stirred in 1 Tbsp. of ground flaxseed  to the mix, allowing it to sit a few minutes to thicken.  
You might also like to toss in a shake of nutmeg and a dash of vanilla extract too, as I did, for added flavor depth.  I didn't even bother to use the syrup, tossing in 2 packets of Splenda instead, to make up for its sweetness, and they came out great.
I enjoyed mine with a little shmear of sugar-free jam spread on top, and the tiniest (...well, ok, kinda small anyway...) dab of whipped cream.  I was in heaven!

This was a much needed change from my normal low carb breakfast of eggs and bacon. While I'll admit my crepe flipping skills need work, nutritionally this was right on target: 478 calories (altered recipe slightly and ate all as one serving) 4 net carbs and 19 grams of protein. I used a teaspoon of sugar free preserves (blueberry and strawberry with fiber*) mixed with an additional teaspoon on cream cheese as the topping and it was pretty darn good. Oh and I didn't have sugar free syrup so I substituted 
a tablespoon of splenda. Good stuff!

A great recipe if you are on low carb! Tastes just like a crepe - I agree with others - leave the cream cheese lumpy. I also added a dash of orange extract (I add this to my regular pancakes) and it was delicious!

This tasted just like crepes to me! Thank you so much for this recipe!!! Perfect for my low carb diet. I know my family will enjoy this one. I used sugar-free blueberry syrup for the topping and next time will top with sugar-free cool whip!

I love these!  Easy to make and very light and tasty!  I used egg beaters and Truvia sweetener instead of the syrup, and I filled them with a little sugar free jelly, and topped with sugar free whipped topping!  Delish!!!  Next time I'll try using fat free cream cheese.

I have made this several times now.  Instead of syrup, I add some splenda.  Then, we top with some fat free whipped topping and strawberries.  If we don't have fresh strawberries, we use sugar free strawberry jam.  Wonderful!!

What a treat!  Great as written and also with the following tweaks:

Left out the cinnamon; made savory wraps.  Filled with warmed up left-over shredded beef from a pot roast I had made earlier and rolled it up in the crepe with a slice of pepper jack cheese.

Also, added a packet of Splenda to the batter & rolled strawberry greek yogurt up in it, topped with a little whipped cream.  YUM!

Really great! Yes, slightly eggier taste than traditional crepes, but it is a low carb substitute, so allowances must be made. I used an electric whisk to combine ingredients, seemed to work well. I made a simple topping of lemon juice and liquid sweetner shaken together.

YESSS!!!!!! thank u so much for posting this, for a carb addict on a mission to lose some weight, this helps SO much. I use eggbeaters & laughing cow cheese & sugarfree syrup for minimal calories. I put a little more of the laughing cow cheese spread on top along with the syrup. This satisfies my morning carb cravings to go along with plain eggs.

I actually substitued almond extract and nutmeg for the cinnamon.  WOW!  I also put blueberries in the mix and fried them up.  Yum!  I then added a spoonful of whipped topping.  These are amazing.

I have never rated a recipe before, but I have to say that this one is awesome.  I have been craving carbs since starting my low carb diet.  This hit the spot.  I followed the recipe as written, but used whipped cream cheese.

These looked really good but they had an omelette texture and the cream cheese flavour overpowered the toppings. I tried one sweet with cinnamon, and one unsweetened with cheese. I might try these again with some tweaking.
