This is very good. Don't skip the glaze step or you're losing a lot of the lemon flavor! I bake for 45 minutes, remove loaf and brush the top with glaze, return it to the oven for 5 minuets, remove again and brush with glaze and return to the oven for 5 more minutes. That way the top isn't as wet from the glaze.

WOW.  This was my first time baking a loaf, and I am sooo happy with the results!  Taking some other reviewers' advice, I took the bread out at 45 min. to glaze and then returned it to the oven for the last 5 or so minutes.  I also altered the glaze- I used one tablespoon sugar and one tablespoon honey to make the flaor more interesting.  In the batter, I zested an entire lemon, so there was no shortage of lemony flavor.  In addition, I cut the sugar to half a cup, used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour just for kicks, replaced the milk with the same amount of pureed orange (more citrus, yum!) and replaced all the butter with applesauce.  With so many alterations I was a little unsure when I popped it into the oven, but boy was I wrong to doubt.  This recipe is excellent, thank you so much.

This is a great bread, moist and full of flavor. Poppy seeds could be used in place of walnuts.

Delicious recipe. I tried this one evening as a dessert.. I actually was out of milk, but I had just enough coconut milk...worked just fine. Didn't use the walnuts.. this reminds me of one of my mum's recipies.. I also substituted finely grated orange rind instead of lemon, but I would recommend actually cooking the orange/lemon rind in the glaze mixture before adding it to the batter. Orange can be a bit bitter. Still, its a great recipe with a few simple ingredients. Love it!

This recipe is very similar to one my friend and I have made over the years -unfortunately, I don't have the recipe.  

I eliminated the nuts -nuts and lemon?  c'mon.
Anyway, cut out the nuts.  

Also, I  mix up a double batch of the sugar and lemon juice in a sauce pan and heat it on low to create a syrup.  Drizzle on loaf/loaves when cooled.

This was absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was I used 4 individual sized bundt pans instead of the standard pan.  These would be great with a hot cup of tea!  I gave one to my neighbor and my kids ate the rest.  This would be a wonderful food gift.

I will make this loaf often.My husband loves lemon and the lemon glaze poured over this one gives it that much more flavor.I doubled the recipe to make two loaves and instead of 4 teaspoons of lemon rind I used 6.I just didnt think 4 would give it enough zing.Thank you Lisa!

This was a nice loaf (and freezes well) but needed to be spread with butter to be really enjoyed.  I would make it again.

I made this without nuts and added a few squeezes of fresh lemon juice to the batter.  I had no problems with dryness as other reviewers have noted and I loved this bread.

I used this recipe to make lemon muffins. They were very moist and not too sweet. The recipe made nine beautiful muffins! Like the other reviewers, I used 4 teaspoons of lemon juice for the glaze, which wasn't still enough! Thanks for the recipe.

My family loves this lemon loaf.  It is eaten up so quickly...it never lasts longer than a day! Very easy and wonderful flavor! I make this quite often! I omitted the nuts and I made a simple lemon juice and sugar glaze that i poured over the loaf when it first came out of the over. The juice soaks into the bread and adds a wonderful flavour!

A few words for this bread: Beyond Delectable. This is the first time I've ever made a bread loaf and it was so easy, it was hard to believe it would be so delicious. I can't think of enough adjectives to describe it! Moist and packed full of flavor. I omitted the walnuts, so next time I might put them, but without them this bread is still beyond five stars. I will make this again very very soon. Excellent!!

I added poppy seeds instead of nuts.  I also put in a couple of teaspoons of lemon extract instead of the glaze.  It is very good, but next time I might put the glaze on it.

This is a great bread, good texture, not too oily and not too sweet. We had some fresh lemons friend gave us from the trees on her farm and I didn't know with them so I looked for a bread recipe; I'm glad I found this one.

I didn't want to make a glaze so, to give it more lemon flavor, I used 1/4 C of lemon juice and reduced the milk to 1/2 C. To compensate, I reduced the baking powder to 1 1/2tsp and added 1/2 tsp soda. So delicious -- this is a keeper.

This one was really delicious! I made a different glaze than the one for the recipe, I used powdered sugar, lemon juice and orange juice. After the bread was cooled I poured it over, it came out really beautiful. Also I baked it for about 45 min. any longer and it would have burned, thanks a lot for the recipe!

Incredibly easy and tasty recipe. I like to add a bit more lemon peel than recommended and it's fine w/o the walnuts if you have kids with nut allergies.

While it did have a nice flavour and texture overall, what made it a lemon bread was really the glaze. The bread doesn't have much of the lemon flavour. Mine also turned out slightly dry and rather crumbly, 55 minutes might have been a little too long. For a lemon bread that doesn't taste like one without a glaze, I don't think I will be making this again.

I made this for my fiance and he loved it so much he said it could be sold at a bakery! (I bake a fair amount but haven't gotten this response before!) 

It was ridiculously good...moist...yummy....goodness. Like a wonderful pound cake.

Slightly dry, but with the glaze and some butter, this recipe becomes moist and is very good. I recommended increasing the glaze by 50% to 100%.  I increased the glaze by 50% and felt I could have used even more.  My wife thought it was great.

I made this into muffins, omitted the walnuts, and used poppy seeds instead.  The first day, these were excellent.  But, because of the glaze, the tops became gooey after that.  I would suggest if making muffins, only glazing the ones that will be eaten right away.  Or maybe making a thicker glaze with powdered sugar.  Overall, the lemon flavor was terrific and perfect with the addition of the poppy seeds.  Will for sure make again, probably trying as written, as a bread.

I liked this, but it needed the glaze for sure.  I added about 2 tbsp poppy seeds instead of the nuts, and added 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice, which not only adds flavor but also the acidity helps activate the baking powder, resulting in a very fluffy bread.  My baking time was different because I used one of those "Perfect Brownie Pans" to make little squares, probably about the equivalent of a mini-muffin, and baked for 25 minutes.  The bread really isn't that sweet, and has a pretty mild flavor, and I found it to be extremely moist.  Not sure if it's due to my changes, but I can't see this being a slicing bread, however the texture is perfect for mini-muffins or something like what I did.

this was so easy, i thought it couldn't turn out very well.  this was my first attempt at bread, and it was WONDERFUL.  i just replaced one cup of the flour to 1/4 cup of Red Mill Almond Meal/Flour (to make it healthier) and increased the lemon peel to 3 tsp. (to make it more lemony).  I also made a glaze from lemon juice, lemon peel, and confectioner's sugar.  EXTRA lemony!  will DEFINITELY make again.

I was surprised at how this bread only had a very slight lemon taste (because of the lemon syrup at the end). To get the lemon flavor I was going for, I had to add another two lemons worth of juice with sugar to make a glaze.  The texture is also very dense, which I suppose a bread would be - I was hoping for a lighter texture.  I would make this again, but add two lemons worth of juice to the batter & then do another lemon glaze on top as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy bread recipe, especially if you only have lemons and want to make a treat.  I did use powdered sugar for the glaze and avoided the issues with the grainy texture other reviewers mentioned.

Kind of dry and not very lemony, even though I doubled the glaze.

My husband and I found this bread to be too dry. Maybe I was expecting it to be more cake like. Spreading some butter on a slice helped. I won't be making it again.

great flavor, but a warning to gluten-free bakers: DO NOT USE COCONUT FLOUR FOR THIS!!! i tried that but it had a bad texture and i had to add a bunch of ingredients and eventually  ruined the loaf. ):  after baking it, it just fell apart. i will make this again, though, with different four!!! (;

Tasty bread with subtle lemon taste. Most of the lemon is in the glaze.  As other reviewers recommended, I added the glaze after baking the bread for 40 minutes, then baked for 5 more minutes. Walnuts add a nutty flavor that goes well.

Very good recipe.... It's not too sweet which I really really like and the lemon flavor is just right ! its so soft and moist. You must make sure you really cream your butter and sugar properly just like the recipe says b4 adding the eggs to achieve the softness of the bread. Definitely going to my favourite recipe box...  Ty!!

The recipe has good bones, texture was nice and preparation was easy. I used the zest of two whole lemons and their juice and still found the lemon flavor too subtle. Going to try lemon extract along with the zest and juice next time and see what happens.

I make this bread often and send to my grandma since she loves it so much! She especially enjoys it with her afternoon coffee. I think I will try to make muffins next time...
