wow, this was really good! i used chicken flavored ramen, and added splashes of sesame oil and and some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit. i also froze the tofu, which i always do when i buy tofu, then defrosted it the night before in the fridge, as another reviewer suggested. i think it gives it a "meatier" texture. also, be sure to drain the tofu REALLY well, or it won't brown up quite as nicely. what i do is just squeeze out all the water by hand, after slicing it into strips. just wash your hands, grap a strip, and qive it a quick squeeze over the sink! it makes a world of difference rather than just squashing it between paper towels. will definitely experiment with other ramen flavors, other veggies, and other spices. thanks for the easy and versatile recipe!!!!

This was VERY good for a fast supper.  My pantry was bare, I didn't have any frozen stir-fry veggies but I had carrots, celery, mushrooms and onions.  It turned out VERY tasty & my whole family of six, plus a baby, polished off an 8 serving meal.  I baked my tofu in soy, garlic, ginger and a bit of honey, instead of frying it because I needed to fry up some ground chicken @ the same time (I only had one box of tofu!).  I never had tofu taste great! Frying it would have gotten the same results.  Satifying and FAST!

This was very quick and easy to make, and was delicious too!  I did just a couple things differently that I thought I would share.  First, don't drain the noodles.  I think that would make them too dry.  Once the noodles are getting soft and breaking apart, remove them from the heat, give them a stir, and cover.  The steam should finish cooking them.  The noodles should soak up the little bit of excess water while you finish cooking your tofu and veggies.  In addition to the seasoning, I also added a little ground ginger and some basil.  I will definitely make this one again!

This came out so yummy! I used packaged fried tofu instead because it has a nicer consistency.  I also cooked it in sesame oil with about 2 cloves of chopped garlic.  I then added chopped mushrooms, carrots, bok choy and a 1/4 cup of water to steam the bok choy.  I used two ramen packages but only one spice packet because of the high sodium factor, but I did add a splash of low-sodium soy sauce.  When it was almost finished I threw in some green onions. SO good!

This is a good recipe base.  I've made many changes to it after trying it as written - I use fresh vegetables and boil them with the ramen.  I don't use the seasoning packet - I use minced garlic, minced ginger, low sodium soy sauce and sriracha or pepper flakes.  I also lightly coat the tofu (I use Japanese style firm tofu) in cornstarch and saute it in peanut oil and sesame oil until lightly crisp and golden.  Then, I baste it with the soy sauce and spices mixture and cook briefly, flipping the tofu twice while basting.

I used spiced organic tofu with regular spagetti, because I did not have ramen noodles. I had to do couple of adjustment, but it was good and even my 4 year old liked it except of veggies :( Will probably make it again.

This was great!  I had dinner cooked and on the table in 20 minutes.  My two youngsters cleared their plates, too.  I bought pre-diced firm tofu and added some sesame oil at the end.  Fabulous!

The things I liked most about this recipe was the convenience.  I fixed it for my family after a long day at work and it only took 17 minutes.  It was very good, and like other reviewers said, it tasted even better the next day.  The ingredients was easily substitutable.  Instead of tofu, I used 1 pound of shrimp and instead of oriental flavored noodles, I used shrimp flavor.

This is so good.  I make it a lot.  I sometime use sesame oil in place of the olive oil.  Just as good warmed up the next day for lunch.

I had some tofu in the fridge and didn't really know what to do with it.  I found this recipe and it was an instant hit with my husband and myself.  That was over two years ago and I continue to make this recipe.  The only thing that I do differently is that I marinate the tofu before I cook it up.  I use minced garlic and either teriyaki or soy sauce to give it some added flavor.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

this was yummy!  it comes out a little dry so i keep a little water from the ramen.  youve gotta like packaged ramen though, cause its basically that without the water.  play around with the vegetables...sometimes i just add some peas and leftover chicken and its great.  suuper fast too.

Super easy and cheap to make (perfect for my single self). I only use the Oriental flavored ramen, because I think it tastes better (tried beef, spicy, and chicken). I can whip it out in 10 min (since I only fry the tofu), and all 3 are cooking at the same time: Noodles in a small pot, veggies in a bowl covered with seran wrap & in the microwave for about 3.5 min, and the tofu in a pan. I drain the noodles and toss everything in the pan with the tofu and flavor with the seasoning packet. Super easy and cheap (veggies cost about $1.80 and last for 3 meals, tofu $1 and last for 2, and ramen? really 6 for a buck at the 99cent store X-D). Minus one star because as good as it is, its sodium heavy.

This is a great starting-point recipe, thanks for sharing! :) I used only 1 packet of ramen but that's 'cause I like lots of tofu and less noodles. :) Tasted good! I added about 2 tsp. garlic and thought that really added to the flavor, and used sesame oil to fry the tofu - YUM! I will be playing around with this and adding coconut milk, curry paste and some peanut butter to see how it turns out. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe has it all.  Fast, easy, tasty, cheap, versatile.  I can make this once a week and not hear gripes, because I just use whatever vegetables I have on hand, whatever meat I have on hand, and whatever noodles I want to switch things up.  The recipe as-is is fine.  The man of the house doesn't care for tofu (he says it makes his teeth hurt) so I can switch in any other protein.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  One of those 'why didn't I think of that' moments.

Oh my goodness - THANK YOU! I don't even like ramen noodle soup and am asian food cooking impaired and this came out great! I had to use what was on hand, so I am going to share what I did:

First I poured teriyaki type sauce on the cubed tofu and baked it for 15 minutes in the oven
Next, I had leftover cucumbers, tomatoes and cabbage with cilantro that had been soaking for two days in a balsamic vinegar and sugar mixture. 

It was a cucumber tomato salad recipe gone wrong. I drained the balsamic off...Found a handful of matchbox sliced carrots, and some frozen corn and started sauteeing in some sesame oil. I food processed a whole onion and clove of garlic and added that in. 

I started the noodles as suggested in the recipe. I then took the tofu out of the oven, added that in with the vegetables and used the seasoning packets. I added the drained noodles and YUM! My kids love it, I love it and we are all going to make this a go to regular meal when the mood strikes for some asian inspired grub. 
Thank you so much for posting this!

I registered on all recipes just to review this dish:  A few problems: (1) Insanely large quantities - this recipe cooks a commercial soup kitchen sized amount.  It uses 16 ounces (1 POUND) of Tofu.  That's enough by itself to fill a medium-large skillet.  THEN you have to add 16 ounces of Vegetables or a complete bag.  Now you have a completely full skillet with 2 pounds of vegetable-tofu with barely any room to stir as it fries to your pan.  Reminder: Makes 32 oz of food BEFORE THE NOODLES are added!  Overwhelmed my dedicated pasta bowl. (2) No Sauce -  Two tablespoons of oil for 2 pounds of vegetable & tofu & a full package of pasta.  That seems normal, until you realize that's basically the only sauce or liquid of any sort for that matter that goes into this recipe.  Forget adding soy sauce "to taste" - I would need half a bottle to coat everything. This recipe has like four ingredients how can anything have gone so wrong.

Tastes just like what you'd get at a Chinese restaurant! I used one pack or Oriental and one pack of shrimp flavored ramen. Added some sesame oil, oyster sauce and baby shrimp instead of tofu. LOVED IT!

I swear I reviewed this at one point!  This is a recipe I've been making for the past 5 years.  It's very good- better than you would expect from looking at the very basic ingredients.  Ramen isn't something I enjoy very much (overindulged in my younger years!) but I really like this recipe and so does my husband.  It's actually one of the first things I cooked for him when we were dating and he was very skeptical of the tofu but it won him over!  I like to use 2 T of soy sauce and add 1/2 T sesame oil at the end.  I suggest using the Oriental noodles because the spice packet adds a lot of flavor.  We like to eat this with edamame :)

A great weeknight supper!  When the noodles were nearly done, I threw a handful of fresh green beans in the pot, boiled for a few more minutes, drained, and added to my tofu.  Draining the tofu really well prior to frying is crucial.

This was my first experience with tofu and I was really surprised--I've been missing out!  I used fresh broccoli, carrots and mushrooms in place of the stir-fry vegetables.  This is a keeper!

Excellent use of tofu!  I've never been a big fan of the bean curd, but this recipe has given me a reason to buy it! :)  I recommend breaking the noodles before putting them in water or you'll have a mass of noodles that's hard to seperate.  TASTY! My 3yo & 1.5yo ate it which is a feat in my house! :)

The seared tofu came out awesome.  I used udon noodles because they are a bit firmer than traditional ramen noodles.

I didn't use tofu- I substituted watermelon rind (without the green skin, of course) instead. Cooked, this has a texture similar to zucchini and adds a light sweetness to this dish. Instead of the seasoning packets (I bought a large pack (1kg) of plain noodles from the Dollarama that doesn't come with those MSG-laden things) I used a combination of jarred minced ginger, garlic powder, a little onion salt and pepper to taste. In addition to the soy sauce I used "Mama Sita's BBQ Marinade and Sauce" in an equal amount. I still need to adjust the seasonings, but it tasted great. You could easily add some protein if you wanted to.

For the ease of this recipe, I give it  4 stars! This is a great dish to whip up for the family when I'm low on time and not much is in the fridge. It definitely tastes like Top Ramen soup, but still good.

It is fast and it is easy and for that, I did rate it 5 stars.  It's not super fantastic but pretty darn okay considering just how "fast and easy" it is.  Didn't do a lot for my attempt at ridding my household of high-sodium, processed foods but for an occasional quick and easy meal, I'd make it again....in a couple of weeks.

This was really fast to make, super easy, and tasty overall. The only thing that I'm going to change next time is adding garlic to the tofu as it sautes, as my husband and I found the tofu a little bland.

This was quite tasty and cheap! I used fresh veggies instead of frozen. But please do not use only one and a half cups of water for the ramen! I had to add more. Also added a little water to the stir fry when I added the veggies to moisten it a little which ended up being a good idea as it got very dry.

Meets my criteria for 5 stars: Fast, inexpensive and tastes really good.  Have to admit that I used some medium shrimp instead of tofu (I thought only Hippies ate that stuff - just kidding) and did not have any pepper flakes.  Thanks for this keeper.

Easy & Awesome.  This recipe was very easy and reminded us of a local restaurant's lo-mein.  Instead of tofu we added baked seasoned pork chops and also added water chestnuts.  Once the pork chops were baked/cooked the rest of the recipe took about 5 minutes to cook. This is definitely going at the top of my recipe box - for a busy family this is an easy, inexpensive, and delicious meal to make.

This is a family favorite favorite. I normally stiry fry in fresh spinach and fresh red bell peppers not frozen veggies. The spinach can be added directly, but I need to season & saute red peppers first. Can't believe the kids like tofu!

I really enjoyed this dish.  It was easy to make.  I would have never thought of using Ramen.  I had tofu issues (as I usually do when I make tofu... it sticks to the pan), but my own tofu issues didn't take away from the dish.  The localy owned and operated Chinese restaurant has 5 star lo mein, so I gave this recipe 4 stars as I really enjoyed it and I do plan to make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

It was my first time cooking ever and I thought WOAH I love Lo Mein and Tofu and it's very simple (I'm going to college soon), so I chose this recipe. It was very easy, quick, did not need fancy shtuff, and it tasted great. The one thing about it is that I felt there was some flavor or something missing... I put 4tsp of Soy Sauce and it still didn't have a strong flavor. Also the noodles and the other ingredients didn't mix well for whatever reason, it could just be that I suck at cooking. It was more like noodles+side dish. Overall I am def making this a regular. 

[Side note, *cook your noodles for a very short time!* I let the noodles cook a little too much, so when I went to stir fry, they went pretty limp on me.)

I thought this was great! Although I did press the tofu for about 45 minutes using plates and a soup can to drain out as much water as possible rather than just squeezing it out with paper towels alone as the recipe calls for. I also used a good bit of soy sauce for some extra flavor, but I think overall this is a fantastic and very easy dish. I will definitely be making it again!

Me & the hubby LOVED this! I used fresh veggies, not frozen - 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks, half a green pepper and onion, a handful of broccoli spears, & some mushrooms. I had bought cubed tofu and put it in a colander to drain for a good hour before hand and then sauteed it w/ red pepper flake and a couple splashes of soy. Also, I used a combo of beef & spicy chili ramen pkgs. SO good!

Easy to make and the whole family enjoys. If you don't want the fat and sodium associated with ramen noodles, try using angel hair pasta and five spice powder to taste.

I put the veggies in the microwave with 2 tablespoons of butter for 10 minutes before throwing them in the skillet.  Cuts down on cooking time and adds more flavor.  Very good and easy dish. I used beef flavored ramen noodles.  Would be an easy dish to change up.  Definitely a repeat!

Personally, I thought it was much tastier than using those special stir fry seasoning packets, or buying the frozen stir fry kits. My husband told me I could make this every week, and I probably will! It's SO easy to prepare, and easy to customize to suit your tastes (or use up whatever you happen to have on hand). I happened to have chicken breast, frozen green bean/wax bean/carrot blend, and chicken-flavor ramen noodles, so that's what I used. I followed the cooking directions as stated, and did not find the noodles to be too dry at all. Rather, they were the perfect texture once I added them to the veggies/chicken mixture. Because the chicken flavor ramen tends to be less zesty than the Oriental flavor, I did add some extra seasoning (a dash of white pepper, Chinese 5-spice blend, and Bangkok blend [Penzey's Spices]. Had I had the Oriental flavor noodles, it would not have needed the extra kick.  I'm thinking of trying beef flavor noodles and stir frying some steak next time... maybe add a little OJ for orange beef? Thanks for a great recipe, Dasibelle!

This is a very fast and easy meal! It's tasty and easy. So far I've made it twice, once with Spicy Chicken flavour noodles and once with Vegetable flavour noodles. I tried frying the tofu in sesame oil instead of olive oil the second time and like it better. Either way, it's good and fast if you're in a bind! Thanks for the recipe!

Super good and couldn't get any easier! Followed recipe exactly with the exception of using 3 ramen noodles instead of 2. Great fast, easy weeknight meal. Thanks!

This truly is an easy recipe that can be served to my family in a short amount of time. I have doubled it because it goes very fast once it hits the table! I have used Ramen noodles with different flavor packets, different types of frozen stirfry veggies - and it's always a huge hit.

We fried the tofu in olive oil with a splash of chili sesame oil and then added some soy sauce once the tofu started turning brown. We also only used one packet of ramen noodle seasoning to cut the sodium a bit. We added Sriracha hot sauce to our individual dishes. Very tasty and easy!

This was great.  Even my tofu-hating-husband liked it.  I used fresh veggies (I had them on hand) and added pineapple, garlic, and ginger.

I really wanted to like this recipe but it really was a waste of tofu. I had my tofu nicely browned and crispy and put in the veggies and seasoning packets and it was quite dry and was hard to mix  together, so I tried adding some pasta water and my tofu got soggy :~( then I mixed in the drained sticky noodles and it was even drier. All that aside it's also awfully unhealthy. Too bad!!

First off lol @ the people saying "This tastes like ramen with vegetables!"  that's ... what it is. XD  The meal isn't going to magically turn into something else, I mean what? 

I actually tried this with shrimp flavored ramen, and shrimp instead of tofu.  It was a good flavor and very easy and quick to make.  I think it is missing something though.  I did add a little garlic and hot pepper flakes as well.  I will definitely experiment with this again. Thanks.

My family liked this more than I did.  I personally didn't think it was saucy enough to be called lo-mein, but it had a great flavor.  I think I'd use double the sauce packets if Ramen didn't have so much salt.  I used red pepper, mushrooms and broccoli, with a mixture of the frozen vegetables I bought.

This was absolutely delicious!  However, I thought it needed a little more soy sauce than what the recipe called for.  I also used a packet of stir fry seasoning instead of the ramen seasoning.  Overall, it is a great recipe and I will definitely be making this again!

Perfect quickly made dish!  Flavorful and easy!  As suggested, I let the noodles soak up more water and just took the noodles out without draining and also added some sesame oil and hot sauce.    Loved it.  Thank you!

It was ok-I'm sorry, it was a little dry for my taste. But the funny part was, my guests liked it. They did note that it could have a little more soy sauce and maybe use different noodles. Thank you for sharing.

I actually made something very similar to this, then found this recipe.  I'm new to cooking with tofu and thought this tasted great!  I used chicken flavored ramen noodles and fresh onions, celery & scallions instead of frozen veggies.  Next time I'll try substituting whole wheat spaghetti for the ramen and just add a little chicken seasoning in place of the seasoning packets.  I've discovered that I like the tofu cubed fairly small or else I'm not fond of the texture.  Simple and tasty.

My husband loved this even though it had tofu in it. The only trouble I had was mixing the noodles with the veggies. I noticed that the tofu had a really nice texture when it was cooked at a higher temp so I wouldn't be afraid to turn your burner up to brown it.

Eh, my husband really enjoyed this.  I did not.  It was really dry (don't fry the tofu for too long...and use more water when cooking the ramen and then DON'T strain it!) and without the soy sauce was rather bland.  I did use a bag of "Fiesta Mix" which was veggies (broccoli, carrots, peppers, etc) and beans.  Next time I would definitely use a stir-fry mix instead, but I don't like onions, which those mixes always have, which is why I tried the other instead.  The beans definitely don't help with the dryness though.  Not sure I'd make it again, although changing it up some has potential.

My husband and I love this!  My tofu had expired so I used a couple of thin sliced chicken breasts instead.  It turned out great.  I also added crushed red pepper and soy sauce to the chicken and veggies while they were sauteing.  We will definately have this again!

Soo good and such a good idea, duh I should have thought of this.  I used chicken rather than tofu and marinated it.  I also added Chili garlic sauce for some heat and it was delicious! a new favorite and pretty inexpensive! I will be making this again numerous times throughout the rest of my life.

Super quick & easy & cheap!  You mix any kind of meat instead of tofu if you like & throw in whatever veggies you have on hand.  Yum!

When I first read this recipe,I was a bit skeptical about this actually tasting like Lo-Mein.  What a pleasant surprise!  I took the advice of a few others and used sesame oil and chicken ramen (it was all I had on hand). I cut the recipe in half and had to use more water to ge the noodles to cook.  I did not have oriental veggies on hand, so I used fresh mushrooms and frozen pea pods.  I also added quite a bit of onion when I was browning the tofu.  My intention was to save half for another meal, but there was no way I could stop eating it.  Wonderful recipe!

I ended up with regular kind of tofu (not extra firm) and although I tried to get a lot of the water off, it ended up not staying in chunks. But it tasted great anyway! We enjoyed this dish.

My daughter (who was very tofu skeptical) loves this.  It's cheap, its easy, its fast.  My only suggestion (if you have time) is to freeze and then thaw the tofu...alot of water will come off it and it will be more firm and meatlike.

This had good flavor for a vegetarian meal with tofu. I followed the directions to cube, freeze, then pour on hot water for the tofu.

Fantastic, my MeatandPotatoes kind of Husband loves this. So easy, and cheap to make! I used TOASTED sesame oil instead of olive oil, and threw in some garlic while "frying" the tofu. FANTASTIC!!!

I was just expecting vegetables on Ramen noodles but it was so much more! I used Pork Ramen (do it, it adds GREAT flavor) and bought Chinese Spiced Firm Tofu (again, DO IT! Especially, if you like ginger) and USED Sugar Snap Stir Fry Veggies (sugar snap peas, corn, mushrooms and onions) and it came out delicious! Left out the soy sauce because it was so flavorful without it. I tried to drain the excess water from the tofu by patting it with paper towels, cubed it, squeezd water out and then patted the cubes again but there was still a ton of water while frying. If you find that the tofu isn't frying, drain the oil out and pour in fresh oil. Trust me, it's a little more work but the tofu will be perfectly fried. Will definitely make again.

Three stars for taste, four for ease of preparation. I just wasn't that impressed... it's esentially frozen vegetables over ramen noodles. But I wasn't expecting to be wowed. Good for a "what can I make with virtually nothing?" type recipe.

i thought this was ok. i gave it 4 stars for its convenience factor. i thought the tofu tasted a little bland. i decided to spice it up by finishing this with a few splashes of ponzu sauce. i served it with egg drop soup II. it was a good, fast meal.

Excellant and fast recipe! I thought it might taste "cheap" using packaged 10 cent ramen noodles but it did not! Instead of using frozen stir fry veggies, I added a sliced green bell pepper and red bell pepper along with some thinly sliced cabbage. I did used the spice packets that came with the ramen along with a tiny bit of ground ginger and some red pepper flakes (use very few they're spicy!). I also had some japanese yakisoba sauce on hand and added that at the end. YUMMM! Me and hubby ate the whole thing. I'll make this often.

This was very good and very quick. I used one oriental and one chicken flavored noodle soup mix. Added a bit of water when heating everything together in the pan. I did freeze and thaw the tofu before use. I also used peanut oil and chopped garlic when browning the tofu. YUMMY !!!

Well, when I made this recipe I improvised at little bit, I'm sure, but I'm going back and trying to rate all of the really good recipes I have tried, so..yeah, it might not be EXACTLY how I did it.

I did the whole oriental noodles thing just like it said. Cooked up some tofu in another skillet and then combined them together. I also chopped in a ton of onions and probably a little garlic (just because I can't make anything without either of them.) Put on a bunch of soy sauce and also some of the sauce that came with my oriental noodles (not exactly sure what it was called) and it was VERY delicious and flavorful and just good. I combined everything in a huge skillet and added a little more soy sauce, random oriental sauce from the noodles, and when I dished it up on the plate I added a little sweet and sour sauce. YUM! 

Oh yeah, I forgot to add that I did not use any of the ramen seasonings (I'm a vegetarian and obviously can't have any of the beef or chicken, pretty sure I saw some kind of beef product on the label for oriental..) But, let me tell you, it didn't need it. 

I am probably forgetting something, but this is getting long enough. Whoops!

I loved this!  I used less sodium soy sauce, though.  Ramen already has so much sodium.  It was fast and easy all right, but tasted excellent also.

Very good for how easy it was.  I LOVE a dinner that can be made this quickly and isn't all about canned soups etc.  This one is reasonably healthy.  I took the tips from some other reviewers and did the following: marinated the tofu pieces in an Asian Ginger dressing before cooking.  Used fresh veggies (Trader Joe's sells an Asian veggie stir fry mix).  Used just one seasoning packet from the ramen and then supplemented with low sodium soy sauce to taste.  Will definitely make again.

Very easy, quick recipe for last minute meal!  If you use fresh veg you will need to add some liquid - like another reviewer added rice vinegar.  It can all be adapted to your taste but the base is a great start.  Not guest worthy but the family enjoyed it.

This was very good, and fairly quick to make.  I thought that it needed more soy sauce, it seemed just slightly dry, so I will definitley add more soy sauce the next time I make this.

This is delicious!  I used fresh broccoli, mushrooms, green pepper, and carrots for the veggies, and cooked them separately from the tofu.  I also used Hot and Spicy Ramen Noodles which is my husband's favorite.  He was hesitant to try this because of the tofu, but loved it.

9/13/2016 - quick, easy and delicious with a bag of frozen stir fry veggies, tofu and a can of mushrooms.

Sure, it's not fancy. But it's fast, cheap, and good, all at the same time, which never happens. I was a big fan of this one, especially on a 90 degree day when I didn't want to spend more than 15 minutes in the kitchen.

This was ok. I used pieces of omelet instead of noodles. Defrosted tofu and marinated it in soy sauce, ginger, garlic powder, honey and water. Added soy sauce, ginger and garlic powder to the meal as well with salt and pepper. Would make it again, next time with noodles. And maybe a little stronger marinade. Thank you for the inspiration!

I bought ramen noodles just to try this recipe.. But no way I was going to use that 30 ingredient seasoning packets with all that sodium and chemicals !! I kept everything else the same but made a sauce with about 1/2 cup soy sauce, some garlic powder, ginger, cayenne and little bit of honey and poured that over the noodles, veggies and tofu. It made a pretty tasty stir fry dish for our dinner and everyone cleaned their plate.

It was okay. I guess. We used the veggies we had in the fridge instead of frozen ones. The taste was there, but following the recipe made the ramen super mushy and over cooked. I suggest that you cook the ramen at the very end before mixing everything together.

I might try it again in a different way....

This has become our go-to when I'm looking for a quick and easy meal that everyone will like, and it's a great bonus that it's cheap. I tend to use a spicy chicken ramen flavour since we're not strict vegetarians, and sometimes we use firm or medium tofu. The real trick is to press it very well for a long time to get as much water out as possible, and brown it well. I add fresh garlic and ginger to the oil when the tofu is cooking to add flavour, toss in maybe a hit of sriracha if we want it more spicy. Easily customizable and always delicious.

The hubby and I were very surprised that we liked this basic dish. I think I'll skip the tofu next time as we felt it didn't add much to the final product except the protein element. We aren't vegetarians so tofu was a first for us when it came to cooking it at home. I added a dash of garlic to the tofu and am glad I did. Everything else was followed to a t. I'm excited to see what else I can do with this recipe. Thanks for sharing.

My husband loved this recipe.  It was the first stir fry type recipe that he enjoyed.  My biggest complaint was that it was difficult to get the tofu to brown instead of just stick to the bottom of the pan even with a  decent amount of drying and oil.

Great! Will make again for sure. I only had beef ramen so I should have cooked the noodles in beef broth. That would have given it more flavor because I went heavy on the veggies.

This recipe is great and super flexible - I added eggs, scallions, carrots...whatever I had!  I also added minced ginger, vegetable oil and 1tb sesame oil to the soy sauce, then stir fried the noodles in it.  I drizzled sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds before serving.

Not sure if I did something wrong, but my tofu soaked up all the oil and tasted very oily.  I did freeze my tofu, thawed and got rid of water.  I'll try baking them next time.  The noodles, stir-fry and seasoning tasted good though.

Loved this. 2 tablespoons of olive oil was not enough though. the tofu stuck to the pan almost immediately on medium high. I added another tbsp of olive oil, red pepper flakes, garlic power,  and then a little water when I added the frozen veggies. Super easy and tasted great.

The main ingredients cost less than $5. I am so full after eating this. Recipe turned out perfect (see my picture). This was the first time I had ever cooked tofu. Instead of using oil, I used 2 tbsp of butter and let it melt. Browned the tofu till it was slightly crips on all fours. I used japanese stir fry mix from the grocers freezer and it already had its own soy sauce in it. Ohhh and while the tofu fried, I had lightly seasoned it. My noodles came out perfect and the liquid consistency couldnt have been better. You gotta cook the noodles longer than 2 minutes or else it will taste dry like cardboard. Again perfect and cheap and excellent for a beginner. Cant wait to try more recipes.

My picky husband particularly loves this stuff. In fact, I couldn't find the recipe after the first time I made it and he was heartbroken. Kind of silly for such a simple recipe, but he loves it. I leave out the tofu.

this cost me under $5 to make! only change i made was using 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and topping off with sriracha sauce. next time i will use 3 pkgs of ramen noodles as there was lots of tofu and veggies but not enough noodles. tasted better after some minor tweaks.

Pretty good! Had to make a substitution for the noodles (used spinach pasta and added a bit of water/chicken bouillon after I drained it). Didn't need any soy sauce! It was delicious and I'll definitely make it again!

This was delicious!  I modified it a little by using a stir fry seasoning packet and egg noodles instead of the ramen noodles - already had it in my kitchen.  Quick, easy and yummy!

I have to say I was a skeptic since I don't normally eat tofu, but I have been determined to find a recipe with tofu that my family and I would like.  This recipe fit the bill.  I am very pleased!  Even my super picky 16 month old likes this.  I followed the directions almost exactly.  Instead of 1 TBS soy sauce, I added 3 TBS.  Next time, I would like to use sesame oil instead of olive and marinate the tofu in something, I'm not sure what yet.  Also, I did have to cook the noodles in batches because the 1 1/2 cups of water was not enough to cover the noodles.  The 2 minute time was perfect.    I'm very pleased with out easy and good tasting this is.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I really liked this basic recipe. Beside some random vegetables, I also added onions, a handful of bean sprouts and fresh cilantro to give it a more thai kind a taste.

I tried this recipe and it was really good.  I made it as directed and it turned out well.  I think I may add some crushed red pepper flakes next time and experiment with other spices and flavors.  I did as some others suggested and froze the tofu, used my hands to squeeze out the water, baked the tofu for a few minutes, then cooked it on the stovetop.  It all worked because it was so meaty and delicious.  I am making it again.  Sooooo easy!!  Thanks!!!

Pretty good although I didn't really stick to the recipe. I used sesame oil vs. olive oil. Intead of the seasoning packet I used soy sauce (3 T), ginger (3 T), garlic (2 cloves), rice wine vinegar (2 T), honey (3 T), and green onions. Made a very yummy sweet sauce.

We didn't enjoy this very much.  I'm not sure what the problem was, but I will not make it again.  It was a bit salty too.  Sorry. :(

I thought this was pretty good with couple of changes hence, three stars.  I added some cayenne pepper to spice it up a little and hardly used any of the ramen season packets.  I also added couple of teaspoon of sesame oil.  Veges I used were red pepper, onion, snap peas and celery and it turned out pretty good.

Wow, yummy! Tried this recipe because my Mother-in-law is vegan and they're visiting soon. Wanted to test drive it before they were here and was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The Tofu does need seasoning while frying though, was a smidge bland.  Will also add a little red pepper since my In-Laws are Indian and like spice.

It was fast.  It was easy.  What the title of this neglected to mention was that it is DELICIOUS.  A definite keeper for those low-ingredient "oh god i'm starving" nights.

I made this twice, the first time I made it exactly as the directions say and it was okay, the next time I marinaded the tofu in napa cabbage salad dressing #2 from allrecipes and it was great. Cheap easy and tasty. Thanks for the creation.

this was SO incredibly EASY and for the quality of ingredients used, it tastes wonderful! You can change the spices, types of oil or veggies all as you feel like, and the recipe would still taste good. I'm broke and I was able to pull this off with the stuff in my kitchen. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who doesnt mind Tofu.

This was my first time eating tofu. I read that tofu absorbs the flavor of whatever you cook it with so I added one packet of Ramen seasoning directly to the tofu while I fried it. I followed the rest of the recipe as directed, but it didn't really make me say WOW! I may try tofu again using this recipe as a base.

This recipe is so versatile and so tasty! Inredibly easy to make and the flavors are awesome.  We add a dash of Soy sauce to each individual serving as we eat it, rather then to the whole meal at once.  It seems fresher that way.  Thanks for a killer tasting recipe

Absolutely delicious!  This recipe is so easy, and for those who don't like tofu, you can barely tell it's there.  It is for precisely this recipe that I make sure I always have stir fry veggies and ramen, so all I need to buy is the tofu!

Making this recipe was my first time using and tasting tofu and I couldn't have been more pleased!  The tofu absorbs the flavors so well, it was DELISH!  :)  This recipe was basically foolproof.  I first made it with frozen edemame (b/c I didn't have frozen veggies on hand).  Last couple times I've made it without any veggies and it's still great; I haven't even needed to season it with soy sauce - it tastes great!  Even my husband loves it and he swore up and down he wouldn't like tofu :)

This was awesome!  I'm not the best cook and my husband usually tweaks my final product (which I'm fine with) but he thought this was perfect.  I did add some sesame seeds.  Otherwise followed the recipe.  We will definitely make again!

This was just ok. It was very easy, but the end result is a product of what you put into it... in this case... 3 packaged foods. 

Maybe it would be better with some additional ingredients? I added garlic which probably helped a little bit... I probably wouldn't make this again unless I was desperate. I'd rather have a sandwich or spaghetti for the same price.

It as OK. I did not find mine too salty as some other reviewers did. I used low sodium soy sauce so maybe that helped. I cooked my tofu about 30 mins. to get the texture I wanted. Easy and cheap to make. I think if I make it again I will make it for lunch. It was very light.

What a great recipe! Easy, fast and cheap! I added minced garlic and extra chopped onion and 1 green pepper that needed to be used... other than that I stuck to the recipe as written. The whole family loved this. I know I'll make it often. Thanks for a keeper!

A delicious, filling meal!  I usually try to stay away from the "open three packages" approach, but this was so easy I couldn't help myself.  I added more veggies and used peanut oil; next time I'd definitely save some water to add in.  And it was my first successful tofu cooking!  A great substitute for chinese/thai take-out, and for only about $2 a serving.

Great recipe to use as a baseline!  I read a few of the reviews and made some changes.  Here's what I did...I added mushrooms and bok choy and vegetable stir-fry w/ the tofu and added some low salt soy sauce and peanut sauce!  I also used "authentic" lo mein (found in the international aisle of the grocer).  I used this lo-mein instead of the ramen because of the salt.  I sprinkled red pepper flakes to add some spice!  A definite winner!!

I almost laughed when I read the ingredients on this one. Decided to try anyway, I was surprised! This was really good! Where was this 13 years ago when Ramen was a staple item in my house? Under current dollars, I made this for about $3.50. Great dish. Will make again!

Made it again, it is fast and easy, but so basic. There are better ideas in the ramen world that truly deserve 5 stars. 9/5/08 For the fast and easiness factor I would definetly rate this recipe a 5, doesn't get much easier than this. Next time I am not going to use a flavor packet.

This was delicious! I added garlic to the oil and sauteed that before adding the tofu. I also added garlic salt when adding the soy sauce---it was amazing! Everyone in my family (even though they don't eat tofu) loved it! I'll definitely be making it again--for all of us!!!

This was so simple to make the only problem I had was cooking the Tofu,  it kept crumbling on me in the pan.  Hubby still didn't like it, he has texture issues.  My 10yr old however loved it and was so proud of himself for liking Tofu.  I can't wait to eat it for lunch.

Made this today and it was really tasty. I think next time I will leave a little of the water from the ramen noodles in the mixture. It was a little dry. I was really happy with the way it tasted and my husband who is pretty picky liked it as well. I will definately try different ramen noodle packets next time. It goes really well with a little sweet chili sauce on the side! Yum!

Very yummy.  My boyfriend who is a very picky vegetarian really loved it.  The only problem we encountered was the ramen noodles were very sticky not like lo mein.  Next time I may try using real lo mein noodles.

Thanks for a great recipe!

The recipe is excellent if you want a good meal on a budget. Be wary that the ramen noodles have a natural tenancy to be dry. So make sure there is plenty of moisture in the stir fry, and don't cook the noodles too far in advance.
Anyways, it's going in my recipe box.

Great meal- very easy to make.

I recommend not using the whole amount of the seasoning packet and reduced sodium soy sauce for more flavoring.  I also added in an extra package of the ramen noodles only (no seasoning) to make the meal more filling.

This is the first time I have ever made tofu! The kids had fun trying to guess what it was! I did add some cayenne pepper to give it that kick, and I also added some soy sauce, sesame oil and a little chinese five spice as well. Everybody loved it, even my very picky 10yr old!

Awesome quick meal.  I wrap the tofu in kitchen towels for an hour to absorb the moister.  When frying the tofu I added the red peppers.  When it was all combined added brown sauce, sesame oil and soy sauce.

My kids ate it up!  Even our one year old loved it.  :)  Enjoy.

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I finally got my husband to accept Tofu as a food and this is beyond easy to make. We love it. I've also made it using leftover chicken breast instead of Tofu and that was also really good.

The tofu is a great substitute for meat in this recipe.  I used beef flavored noodles.  This made a healthy and delicious main course.

This was fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly, save the fact that instead of soy sauce I used the sauce packet that came with the stir fry vegetables.  I think this would also be good with eggs substituted for the tofu if you don't have tofu handy.  I plan on trying that next time. This is definitely a keeper for us!

This was very easy and tasted great.  (I froze my tofu and thawed it before cooking it and that helped immensely with the texture of it.  I prefer a "meatier" tofu.)  I might only use one ramen seasoning pack next time though, to cut down the sodium.

for some reason, i was expecting something really amazing... but like someone else said, it's just ramen without the water. in fact, if i make this again i would probably keep it as a soup and change the kind of ramen. i personally enjoy beef, so maybe that'll be a better base next time. i wouldn't make this for dinner though...

I am a terrible cook, but this recipe is so easy that anyone can make it and it tastes so good! Lots of flavor. It took me about an hour, but it was only the second time I had ever worked with tofu, so I am sure it will take others like 20 minutes. As another reviewer suggested, I fried the tofu with minced garlic and it gave it a little more kick.

yum, yum, ,loved it. Used an Indian brand Maggi masala noodles instead of ramen as I am vegetarian and love maggi. Could have eaten the whole thing by myself but my husband loved it too. Thanks a lot for this wonderful recipe.

To mke this a truely low cal recipe I subbed Shirataki (noodle shaped tofu)for the ramen noodles. At 40 calories for 8 oz. it is a much healthier alternative.  I still use the ramen flavor packets, then either throw the noodles out (they are so cheap it doesnt matter) or serve them to my 1 year old with some low sodium soy sauce on them.  I still add the tofu on top but you could easily use chicken or shrimp if you don't want to risk a tofu overload.

This was a very easy fast lunch, will make again. I used oriental ramen, but I think chicken or hot & spicy would be better (personal preference). I added a little sesame oil for flavor.

This is such an easy meal to make and always turns out tasty and satisfying.  I sometimes make this vegetarian (no tofu) and even with chicken rather than tofu...always a winner.

The tofu wasn't changing color at all and I didn't want to wait 15 minutes or more, so I cooked it for 5-10 minutes. I don't think it hurt the results at all. We all enjoyed it and I think it will become part of our regular meal rotation. Next time I'm going to double the recipe because it was practically inhaled by my teenager!

Quick and easy!!! Very tasty. I bought the tofu already cut up and made it even easier.  Don't boil the noodles too long or they'll get soggy.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I will make this at least once a month.

Great recipe!  I added a few generous splashes of Mirin (rice wine) and a couple tiny splashes of rice vinegar to avoid dryness; it turned out great!

This was SO easy and very quick. You could do so much with recipe. This will definitely be in the regular rotation.

This was pretty good.  I cut up my own veggies instead of frozen.  It was very easy and I will make it again.

This was really good.  I like a little more sauce, though so next time will probably try adding a brown sauce to it.  Great flavor!

This really is quick, easy, and delicious!  I left out the tofu since it's not something I have on hand.  I added a drizzle of sesame oil and a bit of oyster sauce (which, of course, makes it a non-vege dish).  I really liked the flavor.  Thanks for this recipe!

Very easy to make and clean up after.  For a different texture, try freezing the tofu first, then defrost and fry.  I also added in some teriyaki sauce for an extra zing!
