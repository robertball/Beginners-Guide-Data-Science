This was ok. I think maybe I should have used a really good quality wine. I used run-of-the-mill plonk, and the flavor suffered as a result. Also, the carrots were a little strange. I probably won't make this again, but thanks anyway.

I should have noted that I use Kame fish sauce.  It is 27% salt instead of 50% for the others.  Just the right amount in a 140 ml. bottle.

I used a whole head of garlic instead of one clove. Also, added shallots. Use half the amount of cream - they are still creamy and delicious, just not so heavy. And some diced tomatoes tossed on top as a garnish is nice.

This was really good! I served it over linguini for our anniversary dinner which worked well, but the pasta wasn't really necessary.  A definite keeper.

The sauce was okay. Mine turned out a bit watery for a creamy broth, although I did use a good wine. 

I also probably won't try this one again either.

Tried it to night for my husband's birthday dinner.  It was yummy served over pasta.   I added a touch of red pepper to kick it up a knotch.
