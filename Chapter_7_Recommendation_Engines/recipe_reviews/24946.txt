YUM, YUM, YUM and a few more YUMs!  I will probably leave the apple right out next time because I like rhubarb so much.  Eat it hot!  Not that I have to tell you that, it will be gone before it is cold.

I'll definitely make it again, it's not too sweet, just right.  When I warmed up a serving the next day I added craisins. I would increase the  bread and add raisins or craisins.

I had extra brioche and used that for the bread. I used a can of prepared apple pie mix for the apple and rhubarb. Everything else was the same. Tasted pretty good.

Lovely flavours - I loved it. We had it with custard and it was delicious :)
