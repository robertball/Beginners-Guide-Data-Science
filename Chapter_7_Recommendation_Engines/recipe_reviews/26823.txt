This is always a huge hit at our cookouts.  I do make the following revisions: add 2tbsp sour cream, 1/2 tsp cumin, omit the cilantro, add parsley, and add shredded cheddar half way through baking.

Perfect dip. I always double the recipe and add 1/2 tsp of cumin to it. No need to add cheese for color, the dip is wonderful by itself. Oh, and to keep the dip hot, I just throw everything into a crock pot and set it on high for 1 hour and it's ready. I don't even bother baking it in the oven. My co-workers go crazy over it every time!

Super easy and fast.  I added a little cayenne pepper for an extra zing.  Some cheddar on top for a little extra color. Made this for a party,  they were scraping the bowel.  I recieved three calls the next day asking for the recipe!

Changed a few things:
1. Added 1 fresh jalepeno, chopped
2. Added 1/2 c. or so of shredded cheddar
3. Cooked it longer than stated in recipe
4. Ate w/ Fritos scoops and tortilla chips

I loved this.  I baked it in an 8x8 dish after mixing all ing. in a bowl.  I baked it probably 45 mins or more; the middle wasn't bubbling.  My husband and I sat down to eat it and before we knew it the entire thing was gone!

This is addictive!  I cut the diced tomatoes in 1/2 and added southwestern style salsa for more kick.  Very good.

This recipe is so easy to make and tastes great.  My husband keeps requesting it!  I've started adding crushed red peppers to kick it up a bit, makes it even better!

Wow, I just loved this recipe! I did cut everything in half as it was just my husband and me, so I only used one can of yellow corn. I thought it tasted great that way, so I imagine with the white corn it's even better. I didn't soften the cream cheese, but did dice it and stirred halfway throught the cooking time. I have to say the dip got better with every bite. I will definitely make it again, thanks for posting!

Delish!  make sure to drain corns, tomatoes WELL!  I added about a tsp of cumin and adobo seasoning and 2 tsp. chili powder.  Next time I'm adding some green onion and melting some jalapeno jack cheese on top.  Easy and quick!!!  :)

Wow. This was DELICIOUS! 

Honestly, I clicked on the link expecting to find something gross, but was surprised when it sounded good. And it WAS.

Next time, I think I might throw it in the crock pot (minus the cheese) while I'm at work. Then stir in the cheese later.

I made this recipe without any changes because the other reviews varied so much I thought it best to taste it as is before making changes. First of all, I love cilantro, but it is what's known as a "soft herb" and heat kills the taste. If you like cilantro, adding it close to the end of or after baking will increase the flavor. As far as the difference of opinion on rotel vs. salsa and hot or mild, that's simply a matter of taste. My mother would love this recipe as is, I thought it a little bland. Over all, I think it's a decent basic recipe that could be tweaked to your own taste. I will make it again, but next time, I will take other reviewers advice about adding cumin, spicy salsa, garlic and cheddar cheese to make it more flavorful.

I must have missed something!!!  Well, I didn't think to drain the Rotel, so it is no wonder that the end product was runny.  Cream cheese didn't do what I had hoped, and if I was ever to make this again, I would definitely put in some shredded cheese - cheddar, mozzarella, etc.  I am repurposing the entire mess, as there is too much good stuff in there to not do that.  I am SO glad I did not prepare this, as I had planned, as MY contribution to a holiday gathering!

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe as written and found it very bland.  I decided to try it again, making a few changes.  I added 1/8 cup finely diced onions, a little more than half of a package of taco seasoning (in place of the chili powder), 1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese, and half a can of black beans (drained and rinsed).

I usually use two cans of yellow corn - sometimes the white corn is hard to find.  I also just microwave it for about 2-3 minutes instead of bake - it's a big time saver.  It's a favorite!

Was kind of disappointed, but still gave it 4 stars. We used Rotel because that has more umph to it, used the garlic & chili powder also, but it didn't have much kick. Will make again, but try Rotel tomatoes again & double the chili powder.

I love this dip. It is a good mix up from your typical salsa. I just mix everything up and throw it in the microwave. Sometimes I add a little shredded cheese into the mixture.

This is easy and yummy!  It was a big hit at the bbq party I took it to.  The only change I made was to leave out the cilantro.  Make sure to drain the tomatoes really well.

This was pretty good.  I used a can of mexicorn instead of white because it is what I had on hand.  I also added 1/2 cup of pico de gallo, 1/2 tsp of cumin, and 1 tsp of Mexican spice blend instead of the chili and garlic powder separately.

Disappointed in this, especially after all the good reviews.  Glad I only made 1/2 of the recipe.  ~~~  UPDATE:  the day after the party, I microwaved the uneaten dip and tried it again.  Must say I have a much higher opinion of it today.  I think there was too much competition last night.  I'm raising the rating based on a second tasting.  ;-)

This is habit forming. I creamed the cream cheese (room temperature is best) with the spices (except the cilantro) before I added everything else. I've made it with and without the cilantro...best with it!! I also top with a little cheddar/jack cheese before baking. Great addition!

I made this for a cook out we had at my new job,no pressure to make something delicious right? This turned out great! I did add some taco seasoning for extra flavor. Personally, I think it could have used a little heat,but I didn't want to set my new co-worker's mouths on fire.

I served this today for the first time and was disappointed, I did leave out cilantro and subsituted green onions because I do not like cilantro, but even with chili powder the dip was very bland,, maybe make it one more time with bacon for extra flavor,, and some frenches onions on top to add some crunch,,

This was good just not my favorite. It seemed to be missing something to me. I would have liked it spicier so next time i will add some chopped pickled jalapeno and maybe some shredded cheese.

This was a hit with some lady friends. I added shredded Chicken to it and they all loved it. I'm going to make it again for our family Christmas gathering for my husbands family this time I'm gonna use Chorizo. I hope they like it.

No need to make any changes to the original recipe...at least in my opinion. I forgot to add the garlic powder and I used fat-free cream cheese; it was a hit with the guys! I made the mixture hours earlier than needed and put it in the fridge. Then I put it in the oven, but it was taking longer than I wanted so I just popped it in the microwave and served. I didn't add any other cheese either. Very tasty and a great choice for a different type of dip. Didn't have any leftovers!

I used frozen corn and it worked very well.  I changed up the spices a bit and added green onions which were a nice addition.  It was pretty good, but not amazing. UPDATE:  used fresh corn that I grilled, a fresh tomato and a fresh jalapeño instead of the canned. SO so so good. I then used Hidden  Valley Ranch fiesta mix  instead of the other seasonings. It's so good.

Made it for a girls weekend and it was gone in no time.  Added black beans as some had suggested and also 1/2 of a 4 oz can of chopped jalapeno's.  Served with scoops.  Will definately make again.

Everyone loved this!  I doubled the recipe and threw it in the crock pot to serve at a fall party.  I have been asked to bring it again this year.

It took me less than 10 minutes to throw this together, and I baked it for 35 minutes.  I added 1 teaspoon of cumin and a heaping tablespoon of mayo (the kind with olive oil) to the recipe.  I brought it to a cook-out, and I had one request for the recipe, and many comments on how yummy it is.  I can see many variations...adding cheese, or bits of green onion, salsa instead of the tomatoes.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I really enjoyed this. However, I did not use this as a dip; instead, I used it as a filler, along with leftover chicken, for burritos. Yummy!

This is a delicious dip, not to mention easy. Whenever I need a potluck recipe I always use this one. I also have to double it because half of it is always gone before I can even get it out the door.

Terrific!  Great flavor.  Made this for a potluck.  I should have made a double batch because it does not make a lot but it was delicious and I will make this again.  I omitted the cilantro since I am not a fan.  Thank you for the recipe!

Made it as directed, and it was pretty darned good.  I thought it was only worthy of 4 stars, but my guests raved about it and made me promise to give it 5 stars.  So, 5 it is.

Excellent recipe! I cut this in half and between two of us we ate over half the dish. I used dried cilantro. I added a couple of spoonfuls of chopped jalapeno from the jar because the diced tomato-chiles by itself is rather mild and needs a little kick. This was a wonderful side dish. Thanks, the hubs raved over this.

I love this recipe!! Everyone always ask me to make this.  I cook it in a slow cooker and it is great for any party or potluck.  The only thing I do different is I use a cajun spice instead of the chili powder.

A girl brought this to a tennis match and it was a huge hit! It was gone long before we finished our match.  So, I made it for my husband and he couldn't stop eating it either.  I added some sour cream and a little red peper to give it some spice.  It may not be "pretty" but it is very addictive and delicious!!!

Simple to make, inexpensive and YUMMY! I followed the recipe exactly. I like more of a kick, but since we had company, I didn't want to chance it. I think I may add some picked jalapenos next time. This is definitely a keeper!

Doubled the recipe, did not use cilanto, used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and made it in the slow cooker. YUM! This dip was a hit...All of it was gone by the end of a 3 hour pool party. I had several people ask for the recipe. Because of the bang for the buck, the ease of the recipe, the amount it can feed, and the great taste (nothing compromised), this will be part of my regular party dip rotation.

I made this for a 4th of July party and got rave reviews from everyone.  It is unbelievably easy to prepare - took about 10 minutes.  I did have to bake it for about 40 minutes to get it very hot.  Loved it!  Next time I will try it using Ro-tel with habeneros for a spicier version.

I ended up mixing this recipe with another corn dip recipe from this site.  Maybe mix in some shredded cheddar but don't coat the top of the dip with it before baking.  You'll end up with a sheath of cheese that's hard to cut into with a chip.  Add some cayanne to this to pick up the zing!

Yes, it is unappetizing looking, but once you get past it, it tastes great.  I added a little cheese and used Rotel.  Yum!

I'm one of the few who doesn't care for this, and I'm a fan of both corn AND cream cheese. I even tried adding tabasco to it. It's not terrible, but I won't make it again.

This was pretty good but not fabulous, and I don't get people thinking it needed more spice -  mine was dang hot!  I must have had a really hot can of tomatoes and chilies or something.  Anyway, it was really easy and good for spicy dip lovers, great Super Bowl snack.

I made this for our monthly Bunko gathering - we were having a Mexican Fiesta theme - and it was a huge hit!  Everybody wanted to know what was in it - there definitely wasn't another appetizer like it there!  The only thing I changed was to add about a 1/2 to 3/4 cup of Kraft Mexican Style Four Cheese blend.  Yummy!

Everyone was scraping the bowl! I added the cumin. And I mistakingly bought white creamed style corn and didn’t have time to go back to the store so I made it with that and it still turned out great! I wonder if the one can of creamed corn just made it a bit creamier. I’ll try make it the correct way next time. Big hit, will make again!

I made it and it seemed runny and not much flavor. I sprinkled some cheese on top to thicken it up but it still wasn't very good.

Great dip! I have made this for several occasions since finding this on here in the last 2 mos.  I have switched up the type of tomatoes I add...some with chili's some with roasted salsa style and it's a nice twist.  Use what you have and it will be great!  Thank you for posting :)

I made this for a fall birthday party and served with sloppy Joes, Fritos on the side.  I accidentally added 2 cream chesses (the recipe calls for 1) along with 2 tablespoons of sour cream.  I also got risky and made it in my small slow cooker, melting the cream cheese and sour cream before adding the corn and the tomatoes with green chilies. (I used the mild Rotel.) It simmered for approximately 2 hours and was a HUGE hit!  Not a morsel left, everyone wanting the recipe.  The slow cooker made it a nice way to serve and keep it warm as the evening went on. I had 17 people, and decided next time I have a crowd that size I'm going to have to get the larger crock pot out and double the recipe.  Very yummy!

I make this every year for our annual Cinco de Mayo party and it's a huge hit.  The warm creamy mixture with the pop of the corn is fantastic and the spices are just right.

Outstanding dip  I added about a cup of shreddedjack/cheddar to the mix along with some cumin, chili powder and cayenne. Used just a bit of each for a slight kick, not overwhelmingly hot. Got rave reviews and will definitely make again!!

This will be a regular in our house!I made this for a company potluck today and it was a huge hit! Smelled delicious cooking. Everyone wanted the recipe. I think this can easily be prepared in a crockpot. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Next time I will add some diced fresh jalapenos and cumin. Highly recommended.

This is delicious!  Made it Christmas Eve.  Took other reviewers advice and added about 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, 1/2 teaspoon of cumin.  Put  more cheese on top right before it was done.  A big hit with tortilla chips!

brought it as a "first run" dip to work- we were all pleasantly surprised- EVERYONE loved it!
Used Mexican Rotel (has lime and cilantro in it).. drain everything- served with Tostitos Scoops- it is excellent!  Everyone wanted the recipe- and IT WAS SOOO EASY!

Naturally, I had to change this a bit -- but that's what's so great about this recipe, small changes don't impact its pleasure.  I made a lesser amount - 10 ounce cans of the corn and I didn't have fresh cilantro. With over 100 degrees outside, we didn't want to use the oven, so it was cooked in a two-quart crockpot. Yes, the response was overwhelming! The recipe requested, compliments given and only a taste remained. This one's a keeper.

This has been a staple for parties or get togethers in our home. I also add a small can of green chilis, omit the cilantro, add some shredded cheddar cheese and smoky tabasco sauce. If there's ever any leftovers, which is rare, its a good addition to a burrito the next day.

This is so good I can't stop eating it! I did add some leftover rice pilaf after baking, just to add some bulk (and justify eating more of it myself :-). It's DELICIOUS! I'm eating it with Spicy Sweet-flavored corn chips. Must. Stop. Eating. This. Now. (or it will be all gone).

This is one of the best dips I've ever made.  The first time I made it I used the mild Rotel tomatoes/chillies, but it lacked zip.  I've finally decided the hot Rotel is just right on the zip scale.  Chopped green onion adds a little color and flavor.  I do like to sprinkle a little cheddar/monterrey jack cheese on the top, but it's wonderful without it.

Thank you for posting.

Easy to make and a real crowd pleaser.  At the end of baking, I give it a good stir and top it with shredded cheddar.  Then I pop it back in the oven until the cheese melts.

What a great dip! I made this last night for our small group and it was gone almost instantly! I only had yellow corn on hand and I added 1/2 tsp of cumin like others suggested. I also added shredded Colby Jack cheese on top and broiled it the last 4 minutes. I will definitely be making this again soon!

Made this for a cookout and everyone loved it.  It was gone in seconds.  I did add a good sprinkling of cumin, some dried cilantro, and chopped up some pickled jalepenos to throw in, but I think next time I'd add even more flavoring, as I still felt it was a bit bland...but with great potential!  I think I'll add a small can of diced jalepenos and may use fresh cilantro as the recipe calls for next time to give that a taste.  I also did top it with some shredded cheddar half way through and loved that addition for both presentation and taste.

This was quite good..  I had originally set out to make a cold corn dip but once I realized I was out of mayo I had to search for something else.  I am SO glad I came across this.  I think I actually like it better than the cold corn dip recipes.  :)  Only change I made was using 2 cans of mexicorn and one white corn with chipotle peppers, so I had about 3 oz more corn in mine than the recipe called for.  Looking forward to making again!!

This was a hit at last night's weenie roast. Great with Frito's Scoops, but we also tried adding it to the chili as a mix in--great!! I did add the cumin as suggested but would want more spice next time. Great easy recipe!

I really liked the taste of this dip and I followed the directions exactly.  However, my guests that I served it to didn't find the look of it very appealing so it didn't really get eaten.  I wouldn't choose to make this again since no one else liked the look of it.

I absolutely love this dip and have made it now on several occasions.  I usually add some salsa to it as well to spice it up a little bit and omit the cilantro (only because I'm not a big fan of it).

I liked it, but I feel like it could have used a little more flavor. Maybe next time I will use salsa instead of tomatos or maybe add some seasoned meat.

I put this in the crockpot on high for 1 hour, and then put it on low. It is definitely a dip that needs to be kept warm. This is a very good dip, and it makes a good amount.

FABULOUS!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!  It got RAVE reviews with all of ourparty guests this weekend, and I was asked for the recipe a couple of times.  We really love this, and will be making it again-so simple and delicious!.  I think next time we will make it a *bit* spicier, but just as is, this one is definitely a WINNER!!  Make it for your next party-you'll be glad you did!!!

easy and very tasty, don't bother using extra cheese as suggested, it doesn't need it, use low fat cream cheese - fantastic, I served it with turkish bread that I had sliced thinly and browned in the oven

If you really like corn you may just like this recipe. It is simple to make with mostly pantry items. The flavor though is perhaps is an acquired one.

Loved it!  Just enough zip to be interesting. I took it out of the oven about 10 minutes before it was done to give it a few turns and to be sure the cubes of cream cheese were well blended. This was delicious served with Fritos scoops. Thanks for such a quick and easy recipe!

Very good, but we put it in a crockpot and had to end up putting in some veleveeta cheese because it got a little bit too dryed out.

This is a great recipe.  The only thing I change is to add jalepenos (my sister's idea) and add cheddar cheese.  It is very good.

I took this to dip to work for Super Bowl Friday.  At first, I had some strange comments.  Corn? Dip? What is this?  But, after they tried it with the Fritos Scoops  my coworkers were fans.  It's really delicious and something different.  I did add a little sour cream to make it a little creamier and also added some chili spice since I didn't have any cumin.  I have to bring the recipe into work on Monday.  I had several request.  I'll definately make again!

Good but not outstanding ~ made for Christmas day appetizer & served with tortilla chips.  Tasted like a creamy chunky salsa & didn't have great eye-appeal.  Recipe as written ended up having a rather mild flavor ... I added cumin (yummy), a bit more chili powder, and some red pepper flakes. VERY easy to prepare ~ will make again but play around with the spices a bit more & probably add more cheese to make it more dip-like, rather than salsa-like.

I did not think that this dip looked too appitizing, or even sounded appealing.  I made it for a Christmas dip, and everyone raved about it!  I almost followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding a little shredded cheddar cheese and dried cilantro.  Make sure to serve with Scoops Fritos- when they ran out, the tostitos just werent the same....  Will make again and again!  SO EASY that my husband made it!

I was hesitant to try this...I've been disappointed by other readers "rave review recipes" but this does not disappoint!  It was a HUGE hit at our Christmas Party.  I've made it three times in three days!  Thanks for a great new recipe that is now on our list of "must haves."

Excellent - took to a pot luck pitch-in and got great reviews!  Needs the melted cheese on top - I used the Mexican blend packaged shredded cheese.  Serve hot.  Serve with Tostitos scoops.  Very tasty and as a couple people said - very different!

Oh my Goodness!! I had to tear myself away from the half of the bowl I had already eaten (by myself) to save some to bring to work. The rest was gone in under 5 minutes by 6 hungry co-workers. I will MOST DEFINATELY make again - and often!! Thank you for the recipe!!

This is a great party dip.  I did used one can gold/white corn and added a can of black beans.  I also use Rotel diced tomatoes with peppers and cilantro. Everybody loves it.

This was very good served with tortilla chips.  The trick here is to make sure the cream cheese is room temperature and cut into really small pieces so it melts evenly with the other ingredients.

Everyone loves this dip.  I've had to double the recipe just to take care of my guests cravings.  I too have added some red pepper flakes for a little extra heat.  I love how easy it is to make and how great it is to eat.  Thanks for the recipe!!

My guests were a little skeptical at first because of all of the corn, but it was so addictive!  It needs a little 'kick,' so next time I may add hot sauce and maybe some sharp cheddar cheese.

Good, not great. was a little too thin, not thick as I'd  hoped (and I did drain everything well.) There are better corn dip recipes out there. Update: I added shredded Monterey jack cheese to the leftovers but that didn't improve it much.

I make this quite frequently for my Bible study girls.  They LOVE it.  I just throw it all in the crockpot 2 hours in advance, stir it a few times and it's delicious!  Yes, make sure you drain the ingredients.  I usually drain them in my colander just to make sure I get all the liquid out.  :)

Everyone loved this! I would have wanted a little
More flavor to this. Next time maybe I'll add taco seasoning or something . I also added shredded cheese to the recipe and put more on top . It was a hit

I liked this and it has great potential.  I added sour cream, avocado, red pepper flakes and pepper jack cheese.  I still felt like it needed something more.  I didn't care for the white corn for some reason, next time i will leave it out.

This disappeared quickly, just as other reviews have stated. I added:  2 TBSP sour cream, 1/2 tsp. cumin, shredded Mexican cheese, cayenne, a fresh jalapeno, diced onion, garlic, and increased the chili powder to 1 tsp. I added the cilantro near the end, as others suggested.Used 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  I did make it in the crock pot, but  if you do that, you should monitor closely. It seemed like it was starting to burn after 45 minutes. Next time, I will bake it as the recipe recommends. Delicious! Will definitely be making this again!

I made this tonight for my brother in laws 50th birthday party. It went over really well. I forgot to purchase the white corn so all I had was the yellow on hand. Also instead of putting this in the oven I put it in my crock pot on high for 1 hr and then turned it on low for another 2. Served with tortilla chips and it was a hit.

Very good, added 1/2 tsp cumin as others suggested. I thought it could have used a bit more heat, next time I might try adding some cayenne or jalapeno.

Delicious! I've made it many times and have varied it a little.
I prefer to use reduced fat cream cheese and add a 1/4 cup of cheddar. I also add 1/2 tsp. cumin and increased the chili powder to 3/4 tsp. I also use dried cilantro.
For another variation, reduce the corn by about 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup of black beans.

As written it had little flavor to us.  After adding lime juice, extra seasoning, 3 oz. diced green chilies and cheddar cheese my teenage boy liked it but my husband and our 15 guests didn't care much for it.  Will not make it again.

I love this dip!  I didn't have cilantro to add but next time I'll make sure it's included. I thought it was a little too much corn but my husband thought it was perfect. You definitely need to drain all the liquid from both the corn and the rotel tomatoes.  I don't think I drained my tomatoes enough so there was some separation.

This was good, but kind of bland.  There was a little heat from the Rotel, but I just kinda wanted to eat it as a side dish than as a dip.  Just needs some more zing for me.

Fantastic! I cooked this in a cast iron skillet and it only took about 10 minutes. I topped it with some cheddar cheese and put it under the broiler to melt/brown the cheese. I also used frozen white/yellow corn kernels and garnished with some tomatoes, cilantro, and green onions. I also cut the recipe down by half, but even if I had made the whole thing, I'm certain it wouldn't have lasted long. It was a big hit!! Thanks!

This is now my go-to dip for pot lucks and parties. Everyone loves it and it's so easy yet tastes complex. There isn't anything I normally change except I buy the caned corn that has the yellow and white in the same can with green chilies already inside, it just gives a little more kick.
GREAT recipe!

Added: (Drained)"Mild" Rotel with chile peppers, 1/3 small can of diced chile peppers (Drained), 1 C sour cream, 1 can Black Beans (Drained), 1/2 Tsp. Cumin, 1 C cheddar cheese - loved it - add more diced chile peppers and "Hot" Rotel if you like it hot and spicy - always drain Rotel, Peppers and Black Beans.

This was a delicious dip.  I had to use about twice the amount of cream cheese called for to give it a good dip consistency.

We thought this was really average.  Next time I will add chicken, cut the amount of corn in half, and add cheese.  I still don't think it'll be amazing, but it's such an easy recipe that I want it to work out.

Made as written and took others suggestions to add cheese to the top and bake.  Couldn't get enough!  Nice to serve with chips or as a side dish.  We even put some in our burrittos!  A keeper!

Made this twice so far.  Second time was far better because I learned from a few modifications that were suggested here.  Preferred this dip with a bit more of a "bite" too it - just touch of spiciness.  Added 1 can of seasoned pinto beans (not black beans as I tried the first time - this turned the dip an unpleasant purply/brown color).  Increased the chili powder to 3/4 tsp and increased cream cheese to 12 oz to compensate for the extra volume with the beans.  Added in about 1/2 cup chopped jalapenos.  Mixed in some grated cheddar and pepper jack and topped with little bit of grated cheese too.  Served with Fritos Scoops vs. tortilla chips this time and worked much better.  This will be a new favorite for our family!!  Delicious.

Wonderful dip! I never had corn dip before and thought I would give this a try. It was a definate winner. I didn't add any cilantro because I don't like it. I just dumped everything into my mini crockpot and stirred it occasionally until creamy and heated through. We truely could not stop eating it. I served it with frito scoops. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for posting. :)

My husband ate it like a casserole.  When we went to the store, he asked if I was going to get the ingrediants to make it again.  I only made the first one 3 days ago!

This was a hit at the party--everyone devoured it!  I changed the diced tomatoes to salsa and topped it with shredded cheese, baking an additional 10 min to melt.  It was really wonderful!

The only thing I liked about this recipe was the corn. I made it because it seemed like a variation of another corn dip recipe I make, but it didn't even compare. I won't be making this again. It lacked flavor (spice) and the texture wasn't to my liking. I'll continue making my old corn dip recipe.

Really good dip, everyone at work ate it up!!! I made mine in a crockpot with a few adjustments.  First I added 1/4 cup sour cream, added green chilis and 10 pickled jalapenos diced, also added 1 tbsp taco seasoning, added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and some salt and pepper to taste.  really good served with Fritos.

I make this every summer. It's great for barbeques. I double it for company and add taco seasoning- about 1/2 packet. It needs the extra kick. Seems to taste better baked than cold. Everyone loves it.

This had way to much cream cheese.  The appearance was not appealing, and lots of friends asked what it was and what was in it.  Although it tasted good, I would not make it again.  From all the other reviews it sounded good and I thought it would be a great pick for a dip at a Christmas party.  However, it was not much to look at.

Great Recipe--Made for a "girls night" gathering, and it was a huge hit. I made 2 minor changes. I added 1 can of well drained black beans for color and protien, and used frozen corn instead of canned. Everyone wanted the recipe. This is also great served on toasted french bread slices.

Before making this I took some reviewers advice and added half a teaspoon of cumin.  I also substituted paprika for chili powder because I didn't have any on hand.  I doubled the amount of garlic, and I also added half a teaspoon of cayenne as well.  After all of the modifications, I still believed that it was lacking something.  My sister and I both agreed that 1/4-1/2 a minced jalapeno, 1.5 teaspoons of garlic powder, a whole teaspoon of cumin, half a teaspoon of cayenne, paprika for chili, 15 ounces of tomatoes (salsa), shredded cheddar cheese, and some green onions would make this a solid 5 star recipe and put some depth into it.  Without all of the modifications, I would rate this recipe as written is a 3.  However, with the small modifications that I did add to it, I'd say it's a 4 for now.

I really was not impressed with this recipe at all. It lacked in flavor a lot even with my addition of cayenne pepper to make it more spicy. I just thought it was very bland. It needs something more than just corn. Maybe some shredded chicken or something. I won't be making this again.

This was very good, and simple!  I added a bit more spices because when I tasted it before I baked it - I thought it tasted flat.  It ended up being a little on the spicy side for me so the flavors must really come out when it's baked.  Next time I'll make it as the recipe is stated!

This had good flavor, but something was missing for me. It didn't seem to have enough liquid in it. I did add 1/2 tsp cumin and a bit of shredded chedar as others recommended. I will try the recipe again when I can think of what I can add for more liquid.

Excellent.  I only used one can of regular yellow corn though- so it wasn't runny at all.  Tons of raves.  Great flavor.

This was terrific and easy.  I used the HOT tomatoes and it was not too spicy. I would suggest stirring half way through cooking. Drain all veggies well. I got lots of requests for the recipe.

It was good but I wasn't wowed. Probably won't make again. I will say that the cilantro made is smell dee-lish before baking but the taste wasn't as memorable.

This dip was very yummy and it was eaten up quickly!  I used one can of corn and one can of mexi-corn.  I also topped with sharp cheddar cheese.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  My only complaint is that is tastes sweet; I found that saltier tortilla chips are much better with this dip than less salty tortilla chips!

It was very tasty, and everyone enjoyed it.  however, I would add more peppers or chili powder next time.  I also plan to use cheddar cheese in addition to cream chesse.

Delicious recipe!  I only had 1 can of regular corn so I used that along with a can of mexicorn (with diced red and green pepper). I also added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese to make it extra cheesy!  I will definitely make it again and may try adding black beans.  Thank you!

This is a great recipe to make.  You can put it together quickly and with little effort.  I've made it a few times and my guests loved it!  The last time I prepared the dip I added fresh onion and fresh jalapenos (minus the seeds) for more of a kick.  I added shredded cheese on top and the dish almost looked as good as it tasted!!

This tasted good.  I followed the recipe exactly with the addition of red pepper flakes and sharp cheddar.  It wasn't quite right...something was missing.  If I make this again, I may try adding some monterey jack cheese and replace the canned tomatoes with salsa.

This was ok. I made it as written but was not wow-ed. For my tastes, I think I would replace the chili powder with curry which works really well with corn.

Made this for a work food day with many vegetarians present.  Most of them enjoyed it very much.  Next time I'll kick up the spices, perhaps cayenne pepper.  Feels like it should have been spicier than it turned out.

I LOVED IT! I had a big party at my house so I decided to double the recipe. I was shocked at how much dip I had made and made the comment that "no one was going to eat all this and I would have so much leftover"....Well....I had NONE leftover! The next night I made more just so my boyfriend and I could eat more! I used HOT Rotel the second time just because I like my food spicy. I'm from Louisiana!!!

Made this exactly as written except used a pinch of dried cilantro as that is what I had on hand.  Very tasty and spicy...picky husband liked it so that is always good.  Will make again, probably for Thanksgiving.

This came out good, although very runny.  I messed up and didn't drain the tomatoes...oops....I cooked in a little longer without the lid on in the toaster oven, and that seemed to help.  This was a different type of appy for me, I might make again.  I also forgot to add the cilantro.  I think that would have really put it over the top for me.

Very good but needs some salt.  I used fresh corn, just boiled 4 ears until tender and then cut them off the cob.  Maybe that's why it needed salt since it wasn't a canned product with added sodium.  Will make again and bf really, really liked it!

This was pretty good but a little bland for me.  Next time I would add some chipotle seasoning or something to give it a little kick.

It tastes good, but it's not pretty.  My hungry friends ate it and liked it.

I wanted something quick, easy and delicious to bring to a Pot Luck. This recipe covered all 3 and it's not one I would have ever thought to make. It's DELICIOUS!

This was delicious - I made it again right away!  I think it has just the right amount of spicy kick - my husband heats his up a little with tobasco.  Great with those baked pita chips (Naked Chips, they're called).

I accidentally dumped a can of cream corn in this instead of the white corn. It was a little runny , so I added 1/3 cup of monterey jack cheese. It was a hit. I'm making it again this weekend per the original instructions.

This was gooooood! I was making this as a last resort for something to bring to Christmas and I didn't have any diced tomatoes with chiles. So I used Pace Picante salsa instead. Very Very good. Next time I will add a med or Hot salsa since it was a little too mild for me but it was really easy and good. Thanks!

I made this for a party and it was a great hit.  Spent a lot of time writing this repice down for others!  I used Hot Rotel to add some heat.  I have also put this in a crock pot for a party and it did well with the exception that it dried out and I had to add a bit of water occasionally.  UPDATED:  Every time I make this, I get lots of compliments as it's not the same old dip

This is a really good dip- especially when you change it up to suit your own tastes. O.k., I admit- I'm one of those annoying people who doesn't usually follow a recipe to a T. Here's the changes I made to appeal to our personal tastes and available ingredients: I used our home grown corn cut off the cob and frozen this summer (30 oz), added about 1/2-1 Cup of shredded Monterey Jack cheese, 1/2 t of dried cumin, and roasted chili peppers for lots of spice. All in all, this is an unexpected, great tasting dip recipe-jazz it up to your own tastes and ingredients and it is a true winner!

This is a great recipe!  It's very hot & spicy and easy to make.  I added a little shredded cheddar cheese on top of mine.  It turned out great.
