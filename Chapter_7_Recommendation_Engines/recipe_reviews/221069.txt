crazy good. I forgot to add the fish sauce, skipped jalapeno and used on hand fresh vegetables ( celery carrots onion broccoli ) sauce is fantastic. orange zest is mandatory. Don't skip. Thanks for sharing

This was very welcome for dinner here.  It was a tad sweet for me - but I am the odd-ball, everyone else loved it.  I followed the recipe and method with the exception of finely chopping the jalapeno pepper.  I did this is a heavy duty wok - really high heat and didn't have to spoon off any extra liquid from the chicken.  I didn't need half of the marinade either.  I used a large spoon and spooned a couple of spoonfulls of the marinade around the edge of the very hot wok  - so the liquid would immediately come to a boil and thicken quickly.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Enjoy!

A lighter, healthier version of American Chinese orange chicken. We made this as written except for omitting the cilantro garnish. For us, it’s hard to beat orange chicken when well prepared by a fine Chinese restaurant as the flavor of the sauce is absorbed and clings to the battered fried chicken. This dish eliminates the batter and oil for cooking the chicken which reduces some fat and calories. We were very pleased with the outcome and thought this dish delivered a savory balance of sweet and spicy flavors. We will make this again.

For a healthy version of this dish, the recipe is excellent. I did do a couple somethings slightly different. I used a splash of sesame oil to grease my pan and I marinated the chicken over-night instead of 1 hour. The end product was sweet, juicy, and flavorful! Definitely will make again.

Followed all directions and the ingredients except: 1) used 1 habanero pepper instead of jalapeno, 2) did not use the green onions, 3)used green peas instead of snap peas 4) chicken breast instead of thighs, because the above were the ones we had on hand.  I will use the habanero again for this recipe, I think it is a more flavorful heat than jalapeno. Will get green onions next time for more texture/flavor. It tastes like Chinese take-out orange chicken minus the calorific batter around the chicken and it is truly non-greasy!!! Loved it!!! But I am taking 1 star off because the recommended length of cooking the chicken made it dry and overcooked. But I will make it again when I have a hankering for Chinese food without the extra calories.

Kids thought it tasted to much like sweet and sour chicken with the peppers added.  I tend to agree.

I made the recipe exactly as presented but used boneless chicken breast. I thought the amount of ginger overpowered the orange flavor, so I would cut the amount at least in half. I also think I would cut down slightly on the brown sugar. And I thought the sauce was too thin, so next time I would thicken it slightly with a little cornstarch dissolved in a little water. I think the recipe has potential to be a four with these changes.

My husband and I loved this recipe but next time I'll make a few changes.

First, I don't know how large a jalapeno Chef John used, but this was SPICY!!! I'm a little bit of a wuss, but my husband isn't, and even he found it hot enough, which he usually doesn't. Next time I'll use 1/2 the jalapenos, take my portion out of the pan, add the other 1/2 and give it to Mr. I can eat anything. 

The other thing is the cooking times are all a bit long. Use your judgment.

Finally, sorry Chef John, but I don't like to add my snow pea pods that early. I added them with the jalapenos at the end. I like them quite crispy and just heated through.

My version came out a bit darker than in the video, but it was delicious and a definite keeper.

I really liked this - just the kind of preparation and food that my family likes. I omitted all of the spicy ingredients since I was feeding a 2 and 4 year old - still very tasty!

we loved it and didn't find it to be super spicy like some reviewers claimed it to be.. bf even said it could have used more jalapenos.. we doubled the orange juice, garlic, jalapeno, and the bell pepper (we used green), omitted the sugar snap peas and fish sauce, used dried ginger instead of fresh, halved the brown sugar, added mushrooms, quadrupled the soy sauce.. we were trying to make it more brothy.. served this over quinoa and it was super delicious.. ty for the recipe

Great recipe!  I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I improvised a little.  Instead of pea's and cilantro, I used fresh spinach and basil leaves.  I don't have that special zest knife, so I used a potato peeler (which sort of worked--definitely going to get me one of those special zest knives!).  The potato peeler didn't work quite so well (made some funky orange chunks), so it wasn't as orangey overall as I would have liked, but that's really the only point of improvement!  I also let the chicken marinade for 24 hours (we had a quick change of dinner plans), but that was not an issue at all.  Absolutely delish!  My husband was shocked (yes, he really was because I'm one of those who used to burn toast) at how good it was and said it was "professional"!  WOW!  :-)

The flavor was beautiful on this. I couldn't find fish sauce in my immediate neighborhood so I left it out. I do wonder if it may have had more body. My husband made a jasmine rice with coconut milk to accompany and the flavors were great together. I love a saucy stir, so I reduced all the marinade. wasn't overwhelming. I will make this again, with fish sauce.

We loved this! I used the veggies I had on-hand (sugar snap peas, orange bell pepper, celery cabbage, water chestnuts), used apple cider vinegar (didn't have rice vinegar), and left out the spicy stuff (yes, I'm a wimp!). I used the recipe more for technique than ingredients, but I really think it was the vinegar in the marinade that made it shine. Thanks for another great one in my recipe box, Chef John!

I make this about once a month. It's easy, inexpensive and fairly healthy, not to mention delicious. You can marinate the chicken in the morning and have this ready at night by the time the rice is cooked. I do add a little sesame oil to the marinade and a few toasted sesame seeds on top. Usually, I reduce the amount of chicken to 1 1/4 pounds or thereabouts and increase both the bell pepper and the snap peas. I also use all of the marinade thickened.  Thanks Chef John (who has greatly improved my culinary skills).

I experimented with the chicken part of this recipe today to use in a new dish that I made up!  I marinated four cubed chicken breasts in the mixture exactly as listed, but I did not flour it or do the caramelizing process like the video suggested.  I then cooked the chicken and added a green onion bunch, a red pepper, 20 fresh mushrooms, a can of pineapple chunks, two garlic cloves and a package of yakisoba noodles.  YUM!  My husband added some sweet chili sauce to his portion, along with some sesame seeds.  We are thinking about making this again soon, but we'd leave out the noodles and instead add a few cashews and serve it over rice.  The chicken was very flavorful and I anticipate using this recipe quite often from now on.  Also, it provided me with a chance to purchase and cook with rice vinegar and fish sauce for the first time in my life!  Thanks for broadening my horizons, Chef John!!

For as long as I can remember, I've never liked orange chicken. I initially made this just for my husband, but I got a bite in the end only to discover I LOVE ORANGE CHICKEN! (So long as I do it myself) It wasn't that overwhelmingly sweet, overly sticky and dyed stuff you find at buffets. This was awesome! I got lots of compliments. ;) I didn't prepare it spicy though. I can't handle heat to save my life, but I was definitely the Charles Dickens of my orange chickens. Hahaha. Thanks for the recipe! Will be making this the next time we have Asian night. :D

Great recipe, easy to experiment with. After cutting the amount of orange juice (freshly squeezed) I let the chicken sit in the marinade and then I coated it in flour and fried it. Immediately after frying I put about a quarter of a white onion (nixing the green onion and Jalepanoes), grated the garlic, and then added all of that with the fried chicken in another skillet. Then I poured the whole rest of the marinade in about a minute later, added the red pepper and the peas to that and continuously mixed that all together for about 4.5 mins. End result served over white rice was delicious.

The first time I made this, I used chicken, and my husband and I enjoyed it. The second time, I used shrimp instead, and now it is his favorite dish. I substitute mini sweet peppers for the red bell pepper. Fantastic flavors. Thanks, Chef John!

I'm a pretty good cook and check out this site for new ideas - this had such rave reviews I thought "why not". I followed the recipe perfectly and after 2 hours of marinating the chicken had no flavor and even worse, with the cooking times the chicken ended up rubbery.

Wow! This recipe is amazing. I didn't have a jalapeño pepper, but I don't think it needed it. My red pepper was pretty small so I also added an orange pepper. It turned out colourful and delicious!

Everyone loved this.  I reduced all of the marinade instead of half of it, and I'm glad I did.  It was the right amount of sauce to have with it.  Next time I'll use double the amount of onion and bell pepper and quadruple the amount of peas.

We loved this! A fresh tasting MUCH healthier version of a Chinese food restaurant classic. I told my boyfriend what I was cooking and he was expecting something like you'd get from the take out place, and it's nothing like that. But, he loved it anyway! The only thing I changed was not adding fish sauce...forgot to buy it and I read another reviewer say they left it out and the dish was still great. Will definitely be making this again!!

We really enjoyed the spicy orange flavor this dish promised. I did leave out the ginger and cilantro (just personal perference) and to cut calories I left the meat whole and served the veggies on the side without the rice.

Excellent. Made as, served with coconut rice. Cooked w a timer at each step. Used all the marinade. The red pepper flakes made it spicy so if you don't like spice use 1/2 or none. But we loved it.

I went ahead and added 2 tsp of cornstarch  at the end since I had quite a bit of the delicious marinade left and wow, was it a hit with my husband.  He loved spooning it on his rice like “gravy”.  It was the perfect uncomplicated weekday dinner.  His words, “Yum, I would eat this again, and again!”

I tried this version of orange chicken because I enjoy spicy foods.  Since I had 3 pounds of  boneless chicken breasts,( instead of the 2 called for) (which I prefer to the legs) I used the handy recipe adjustment calculator to adjust the ingredients.   It called for 1.5 jalapeno peppers. I used the whole 2 I had. Perhaps that was too much, because while it gave the dish a nice kick , the spice over powered the orange sweetness. So, if you want to enjoy both flavors easy does it on the heat.
I also marinated the meat for several hours instead of the called for 1.
In any event Spicy Orange Chicken was a tasty change. The next time I will scale back the peppers.

Made 9 servings instead of 6 for a bigger group of people.  Next time would use a little less ginger and rice vinegar and a little more orange juice to balance out the acidity.  We all enjoyed it very much.

I didn't use quite as much jalapeno and regretted it. It was actually a bit bland for us. I also used 1 Tbs. of fish sauce instead of 2 and regretted that as well. Added water chestnuts and mushrooms to mine. I should have totally followed the recipe the first time! (Sorry about that, Chef John!) It was still very good, though, so I plan to make it again. It was much healthier than the restaurant-type orange chicken!

Meh.  I like some of Chef John's other recipes, but not impressed with the one.  'Kinda reminded me of a frozen dinner, but I like the Lean Cuisine more.  It's possible I'm just not a fan of orange chicken.

This was good, but next time I would do more to enhance the "orange" part of the recipe name.  It was definitely spicy, but I couldn't taste orange at all.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was very tasty! I did cook it in the crockpot instead of on the stove and omitted the orange zest(for my taste). I was pretty leary about the fish sauce but in the end I didn't get the strong taste or smell from it. I would have given 5 stars if it had lived up to the "spicy" factor.

It was good, next time though I think I'll have a saucepan reducing the marinade so it thickens up. The red pepper takes a bit longer to cook then suggested.

I made this with shrimp, cooking the veggies a bit before adding the shrimp.  I added the marinade, brought it a boil, then took out the solids and reduced the sauce.  It's very orangey, good flavors.  I reduced the garlic to 3 cloves and it was plenty.  Next time I'd marinate the shrimp no more than 15 minutes because they started to "cook" like ceviche.  Will  definitely try it with chicken and beef.

This was really good. I used a tablespoon of thai kitchen's roasted red chili paste in the marinade in place of the fish sauce and about half the brown sugar.  Later in the recipe I decided to use all of the marinade for a sauce instead of half. I would definitely make this again.

Didn't have any fish sauce or jalapenos, so used 2 tbsp of soy sauce and a green chilli pepper instead. Also ended up using the whole of the marinade and breast instead of thigh meat. Worked a treat and will be making again for sure!

Will definitely make this one again. My partner stated it was by far one of the best dinners I have made for her. Followed the recipe except for the snap peas I forgot to buy. 
Squeeze fresh Orange juice as it makes this dish does have a strong Orange flavour however its one of the things that makes this so good

Did not use cilantro as we don't like it. Didn't have brown sugar so I substituted white sugar and a little bit of molasses. Otherwise followed recipe. Found it to be very bland.  We all added soy sauce to our portions.   None  of the flavors  in the marinade seemed to come through. And I love Chef John so I had high hopes.  Won't make again.

Oh, my, this was a tasty lunch!  I swapped snow peas for the sugar snap peas, due to personal preference, and I believe it was a great thing to do.  Snow peas add crunch and flavor, but not as much sweetness as sugar snap peas.  Other than that, I used the indicated ingredients, and we were pleased with the outcome.  Since I do not have a wok, my only change to the cooking method was to pour the marinade into a saucepan and let it reduce to half, while the chicken was cooking.  The spice level was about a 1.5 out of 5--comfortably warm in the complex sauce.  I will DEFINITELY make again!

The first time I made this, I made it exactly (can't really review a recipe if you don't use their recipe, right?!) -- and it's worth SIX stars.  That said, it was too spicy for the kids -- so although we LOVE the heat, this time we eliminated the jalapeno and cut the red pepper flakes in half.  Still has a kick, and it's STILL five-star worthy.  I definitely agree with another reviewer that the orange zest is a must -- it really adds to the flavor.  Don't skip that! :)  You can also easily add fresh veggies that you have on hand, or those you love most in orange chicken.  If you add carrots, I definitely recommend adding those with the first batch of veggies so they have an extra few minutes to cook.  This truly tastes and looks like something out of a high-end restaurant, and it was so much easier than I thought it would be.  It's become an instant family favorite!!

Ok, all of my 6 kids at this without complaining. That in itself makes this a keeper recipe. I left the jalapeno out, reduced the red pepper flakes to make a mild, kid-friendly version, and used ALL of the reserved marinade, thickened with a little cornstarch, to make the meal more 'saucy'. Hubby and I enjoyed it too!

Followed directions almost exactly.  1.  Added more orange zest than called for.  2.  Careful of Jalapino, I used two (love things hot).  3.  Made in a wok w/splash of sesame oil.  Served over jasmine rice (made with chicken broth, not water).  Great orange flavor, looking forward to trying it with beef.  It's a keeper for sure.

I really enjoy this recipe as it's pretty easy to make and very flavorful. The only thing I changed is that I add in orange marmalade to increase the orange flavor. It's a healthier version of normal restaurant-style orange chicken and I love it since I really dislike breaded foods. Yum!

Used chicken breast, thought the recipe was darn good :D the only thing I would change is add more brown sugar to get a sweeter, better glaze.

I used fried tofu instead of chicken, white onion (opposed to green), extra soy sauce instead of fish sauce, threw in a bunch more vegetables, and used flour to thicken. the amount of spice is great, I could've actually used a bit more orange flavour, probably zest. Cost me all of 12€ for all of the ingredients and I will have food to last me all week. Will definitely make again!

Very good, needed additional soy sauce when done. Since I didn't follow it exactly I gave it five stars, but it was only a four star as I prepared it. I didn't have orange zest, and I used shredded carrots instead of sweet pea pods. Also my wife is adverse to spicy meals so I left out the jalapenos. I ate it with brown rice and ended up enjoying it very well. Couldn't get the chicken to caramelize though.

I wanted to eat it all!! Only thing I did differently was add some regular onion because I was low on green onion. I guess also I added cornstarch towards the end to thicken but that shouldn't affect taste. Next time I would consider adding all the marinade instead of half. Very yummy though!

This was REALLY SPICY!!! I didn't seed the jalapeno, which I will do next time, and perhaps only use half or 3/4. Also the cooking time was way off. On med-hi it took me about 3-4 min to caramelize the chicken. I've found that with many of Chef John's recipes I have to turn the temp down, so maybe it's just his stove it's as hot as mine.

Awesome!This was as good or better than anything we have had from a take-out restaurant. Served it on a bed of rice.This is something I will make many times over.Thanks chef John! Love the way it thickens without the use of starch.

Looking for a recipe for lemon chicken.

This recipe works.  It's not the best flavor ever, though it has a good head start.  I had to add quite a few more flavors to the mix to enjoy (sesame oil, lime, more ginger & garlic etc). I don't really enjoy take out orange chicken, I prefer authentic Asian....maybe this is why I didn't enjoy it? Thank you for the recipe!

Maybe my expectations were too high based on all the reviews, and the fact that I usually like Chef John's recipes, but I did not like this chicken! I did follow the recipe exactly. Don't get me wrong, the stir fry tasted alright, but it was nothing like any Chinese take out. I will not try this again.

I did not use the jalepeno (felt weird in an asian dish), used chicken breast instead of thighs, and added very thinly sliced broccoli instead of the peppers and peas. I also shortened the cooking time on the chicken and added a bit more of the marinade when I added the broccoli. It is really good. Really, really good. I think the only thing I'm craving is more sauce, so next time I'm going to boil the rest of the marinade to add on top. Thank you!!

This was good. We found it similar to Chef John's Caramel Chicken, which we love. Really enjoyed  the crunch of the veggies in this recipe and will add more next time. Good way to use up sugar snap peas that are kind of boring on a good day. Will make this again.

This is soooo de-lish!!  I've made it several times, as is, except left out cilantro which I love but not in this dish.
Shared the recipe with my daughter & sister.  They loved it too after they made it. My sis made it for her grown family at Easter & it was a big hit.

Healthier version of a Chinese favorite.  Both my husband and I loved it.  My daughter wasn't so crazy about it because she insisted that she didn't like the vegetables.  (News to us.)  A keeper!

Just finished licking my plate!  Delisous recipe and will make again.  Only change was my grocery store did not have rice vinegar so I used a splash of white vinegar.   Next time I think I will cut back on jalapenos a bit.  Really really good!
