Based on comments here, I made some substitutions and I think this is the best lentil soup I've had in a long time. I added another 2 carrots, I doubled all the spices. I added 1/8 tsp. red pepper flakes, I bought a can of 28oz. crushed tomatoes. I added the 14.5 oz. that the recipe called for, then used the rest mixed with 4 cups of broth and water to make the 8 cups of "water". I used 1 cup brown and 1 cup red lentils, I used 3 T. of lemon juice instead of vinegar, and I added about 3 Tablespoons of port. I guess that's a lot of changes, but trust me, people can't stop eating it. It's really great.

This is a phenomenal recipe. Having lived in Spain and enjoyed true lentil soup, I thought I'd never again appreciate an american version. Boy was I wrong. My adaptations to this great recipe include: 4 carrots, 2 bay leaves, 4 garlic cloves, 8 cups chicken broth instead of water. In the last 30 minutes I add 4 cups spinach, three potatos, and smoked sausage. I blend half and then add back for a really nice texture. This is served great with parmesean cheese and garlic/ mozerella bread.

This is great lentil soup.  My husband said that it was better than any he had had.  I added extra garlic and spinach and omitted the olive oil to cut fat. Also, have tried wine vinegar and balsamic, balsamic is best.  Very "meaty" and tasty, I would definitely recommend.

This soup is the bizzomb. My family ate this up like vultures on a carcass. The only thing I added was the four beers that I drank while cooking.

This lentil soup is excellent!  Definately one of the best I have found, although I did have to make some changes to suit my tastes.  I used 4 garlic cloves instead of 2, added 1 teaspoon each of cumin and curry powder and used 2 cups chicken broth and 6 cups water.  Turned out very good and flavorful.  I also did not see any reason to use so much oil, so I cut that back to 1 tablespoon and that was plenty to saute the vegetables.  The addition of spinach is wonderful and the use of balsamic vinegar really makes a differance. Wonderful soup recipe that I will keep on using!

This is my second review of this recipe (after making my third batch of soup).   I neglected to mention in my first review that I used Stewed Tomatoes (more flavor).  Because of this, I did not add salt.  Also, I used 1/2 of a frozen package of spinach.  I saved the rest for another batch.  We served the last batch over thin spaghetti and found it to be a complete, filling lunch/dinner.  Also, sprinkling with parmesan cheese as noted in other reviews was very good.   I notice that my first review got eliminated.  The point I made there was to use Herb Ox Low Sodiumn Powder Bouillon rather than the regular bouillon (5 grams of sodiuim as opposed to over 1000).  I also put in a couple of dashes of hot chili sauce for a little extra flavor and oomph!!!
Also, I have a Vita Mix and chopped all of the vegetables in it -- quite a time saver.

Very good. I did decrease the oil to 1 tblsp. and added about 1/2 tsp. cumin. It made about 10 cups of soup. Weight Watchers: (with 1 tblsp. oil) this works out to be 2.5 points per cup in my calculations.

I made this recipe and scaled it for 42 since it was going to be a main dish for our school's teacherstaff appreciation lunch. I used stewed tomatoes and vegetable broth which made it vegetarian so those teachers and staff who are vegetarians could enjoy it too. It was well liked, (I loved it!) although I noticed something a few days later. With the leftovers, the spinach was quite yucky and the color became uniform, so it did not look as appealing. I thought it still tasted good, although the flavors all blended a little too much by then making it less flavorful. But if I was making it again and knew ahead of time there would be leftovers I would simply take out the extra BEFORE adding the spinach and fridge it.

this soup is going to be a staple in my winter kitchen. i added my own variations, incorporating some of the other suggestions:

two jalapenos diced (some seeds,)
two zucchini diced,
4 cloves garlic minced,
vegetable stock,
28 oz can of crushed tomatoes (not 15 oz),
tablespoon of ginger (store bought grated),
balsamic vinegar (not white),
& i pureed half of the recipe in a blender to thicken it up a bit.

YUM!

I rarely take time to review recipes, which is really hypocritical since I rely so heavily on others' reviews ... but this soup was DELICIOUS.  My children, ages 4, 6, 8 and 18 absolutely INHALED this soup.  I printed off some other reviews *planning* to modify the recipe as they suggested but I got distracted and completely forgot to do so --- which means I followed the recipe AS written.   I cannot imagine how one could possibly improve on this.  So no offense to the kind folks who offered improvements: I'm so completely impressed by this recipe that I see no need to mess with it one iota.  Really, really fantastic recipe.  Thank you!

This is a fabulous base recipe -- you can take this and add or delete to your own tastes and it comes out great.  I used canned beef and chicken broth (about 5 cups) and the rest water, I also added potatoes (about 1 1/2 cups of diced yukon gold) at the same time that I added the lentils.  I also added more garlic (person preference!).  I didn't add the vinegar or spinach, and tinkered with the spices (added salt, pepper and some more garlic).  I'm bringing it for lunch all week!

Delicious soup. Very easy to make and delicious to eat. This recipe makes a big batch so be prepared with freezer bags if you have a small family.

GREAT soup! I preferred this to a food network recipe I tried last time. This doesn't need many changes at all, but I did read many of the reviews before I prepared it and here are my notes in response: I agree with those who added cumin, and those who upped the amounts of the spices; I also put in a few pinches of red pepper flakes for kick (doesn't affect flavor in such a big batch); I disagree with those that upped the amount of tomatoes - a 14.5oz can is the right amount I think; and I agree with those that went half broth/half water for the 8 cups of liquid. Half broth adds good flavor; if you go all broth, you are just wasting money and getting unnecessary salt (even with the low sodium brands - unless of course you make your own at home). I don't think you need to puree a portion and add it back in as some people did. I guess the size of lentils can vary, though, so that's a good tip to keep in mind if the texture comes out a little thick for your taste. Finally, if you're a spinach fan, the soup will "take" a lot more than half a cup once wilted, so feel free to use up whatever you bought. Again, kudos to Marie! I feel like I "know" how to make lentil soup now thanks to this great base recipe.

How anyone could give this a high rating is a mystery to me. I followed the recipe completely, and it had almost no flavor--kind of like highly diluted salt-free ketchup. I added a scoop of beef Better than Bouillon, which helped a little. A bunch of seasoned croutons on top made it edible but still not good. My wife and I managed to eat one bowl apiece.

This was really good. I used 8 cups organic vegetable stock and 1 1/2-2 cups water as the lentils absorb much of the liquid during cooking. If you use the stock you don't need to add the salt, and only 1 can of tomatoes is sufficient. Also I added about 6 cloves of garlic and sauteed vegggies in about 3/4 Tbsp coconut oil instead of olive. After 45 mins I added chopped kale instead of spinach and fresh cut corn off the cob-2 ears for a flavor and texture addition. Do use the balsamic vinegar as others suggested and I topped mine with nutritional yeast instead of cheese for a healthy and delicious soup!

This has turned out to be my all-time favorite soup. First of all, I have taken to browning a few links of spicy Italian sausage first. Cut into slices, and drain the grease. Double the amount of carrots, garlic and bay leaf. Add 1/4 tsp. thyme. Use chicken broth as opposed to water. Use a high end Balsamic vinegar. And serve with buttered farfellini (tiny bow ties) topped with freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Ooh, my mouth is watering right now! Thanks for this recipe submission, Marie!

This is one of my family's favorites!!! I make it at least once/month in the cold months. I use one large red onion.  I add one box of frozen chopped spinach instead of the fresh spinach. I add it at the end and usually just put the whole block in. I usually increase all ingredients and freeze some, but without the vinegar. I add balsamic vinegar before serving. This is truly awesome!! Oh, my goodness!
One more thing, the difference between this soup being good and unbelievable is the liquid that you add. DO NOT use water. I always save my veggie scraps in a freezer bag until I have enough to make broth. Strain and freeze until you need it or use it right away. You will not regret it.

I really enjoyed this soup.  I've made it twice now, both times I use a mixture of the red and green lentils, but once I used a can of crushed tomatoes, and the next time I used a can of diced tomatoes.  I have to say I enjoyed the batch that used the diced tomatoes more, I found the crushed tomatoes tended to overpower everything, while the diced tomatoes nicely complemented all the other flavors. Just my personal preference, either way the recipe is still really tasty.  Thank you for sharing it! :)

This was first attempt at making lentil soup. Actualy, my first time even eating lentil soup. I had heard from many people that lentil soup was good, so I decided to give it a try. I picked this recipe because of the ratings and because it looked to be both healthy, inexpensive, and easy to make. I did make a few changes. I ommited the oil altogether and cooked my veggies in pam to cut the fat. I also added knorr chicken boulion to the water and 1 small (8 oz) can of tomato sauce, keeping the liquid to 8 C. I used lemon juice rather than vinegar and used frozen spinach. (aprox 1 C) I had to add a little more water about halfway through the simmering time as the lentils seemed to be soaking up all of the liquid. All in all, this was very good soup. Very filling! Hubby liked it as well, so I will be making this one again. I am on the the Slimming World program and this soup, minus the oil, counts as a free food, which is great! I can eat as much as I like with no guit. Fabulous!

I'm 68 years old and have never had lentils, I just thought I wouldn't like them and didn't know how to prepare them.  When I found your recipe and all of the 5 star reviews I thought I'd give it a try, I do love soups.  Well, I have found a new favorite, healthy soup to enjoy.  I too made a couple of changes to the basic recipe.  I used stewed tomatoes and mostly chicken broth and less water, only 2 tablespoons of Smart Balance Omega oil in place of olive oil, no bay leaf, a little extra oregano and thyme since I didn't have basil.  WOW!!!! this is a great soup, I'm sure I will make often.  I enjoy a cup of hot soup for breakfast on cold days, yum!  I will double the recipe next time, soup doesn't last long around me.

This recipe is so easy and sooo delicious!  As per suggestions from other reviewers, I used chicken broth instead of water, doubled the garlic and used balsamic vinegar rather than plain white vinegar.  Also, I used an entire bunch of spinach rather than just a 1/2 cup.  Wow!  I am going to make this over and over again!!

I don't want to stop eating this even though I am stuffed! I doubled all the veggies and spices/vinegar, used a frozen box of spinach and it is amazing!!! FYI don't add the tomatoes until the end: using tomatoes, stock, or salt while cooking legumes  makes them tough and takes longer to cook (only takes 35 minutes without salt). So I swirled a T of Better than Bullion in when I added the tomatoes. Fantastic recipe!

Wonderful! This is a rich, hearty, full-flavored soup that's really a meal in a bowl. Following others' suggestions, I doubled the spices and used 4 c. each of low-sod chicken stock and veg stock. I also added 1 tsp cumin, 1 TB smoked paprika, and 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes. Finally, instead of plain vinegar, I used 1 TB balsamic, which made a big difference, pulling together and smoothing out all the flavors. This is healthy fare with lots of pizazz.

This soup was absolutely delicious. I have to admit that I made a few slight changes. I threw in some chopped red bell pepper that I had on hand and a chopped chorizo link. I also used 6 cups of chicken broth in place of some of the water. I did not have celery on hand, so I used celery seeds. I also threw in two small potatoes that I had peeled and cubed. I did not add spinach as I had none on hand.   I ate the soup over some cornbread--the golden sweet cornbread recipe from this site--with a dollop of sour cream. This was sooo tasty and filling. I will be making this often this fall and winter.

Next time, listen to the reviews saying to replace two cups of water w/ chicken broth. Also, next time, don't add more water without tasting it first - it ended up dilluting the flavor and I had to add more spices/salt to give it flavor again. Note to self (2 hours later): even after adding a lot more water, this soup really does thicken over time. It's like a sponge that continually sucks up any extra water you put in it. Which means that unless you add water and then eat immediately, this is a really hearty, filling soup. Yum!

Prior to starting I prepared 2 quarts vegetable broth to use instead of regular water.  I liked this recipe, but would suggest using more liquid (either water or vegetable broth) to make it more soupy -- mine came out more as a stew than a soup.  I added a little tomato sauce to make it more watery towards the end.  Overall a good lentil soup recipe.

I couldn't rightfully follow a soup recipe with that much water, so I'm generally used to adding vegetable broth in its place.  But there is one huge flaw here: an hour is not quite enough cooking time for dried lentils.  I cooked them for about 1.5 hrs, and still they were too al dente for me.  The directions don't say to soak, which I would imgine would help, but my yellow lentils were crying for more squishiness!!  

Anyway, all of the 4 and 5 star reviews are that way because there were serious alterations.  If you had to add a hamhock, sausage, or double everything, you're not really saying that THIS recipe is at all any good!  But I love to cook, and I appreciate adding and subbing all kinds of fun stuff to tailor the recipe to your liking.  But far too many people commented they  LOVED this, and I think it was mediocre, at best (even with my stock substitution for the broth).  Yeah, a tiny little change is not adding a hamhock and chicken broth!  But the vinegar and spinach additions were really fun.

Delicious. I read a bunch of reviews and made the following changes: double everything from carrots to basil, use broth instead of water, and use balsamic vinegar for the vinegar. Also added more spinach.

This is a really yummy soup! I really made very few changes toi this recipe, and the ones I made were very basic: I added two extra cloves of garlic and an extra carrot, and used chicken broth instead of water. I also used more spinach than was called for. Other than that, I kept this the same. I really like the touch the vinegar gave to this soup; it made a huge difference flavor wise! I'll definitely be making this again; thanks for sharing the recipe!

As written, this soup is extremely average.  After making it per recipe, I read some of the reviews and found that the most enthusiastic ratings seem to be based on significant changes.  So I added some hot sauce, more carrots and spinach, lemon juice, cumin and curry powder.  It is much tastier with the additions.

This is an absolute GEM of a recipe! I love the way it looks, smells, and tastes. I followed the recipe making a few variations: I added some dried cilantro, one dice potato, some red chile flakes, one chicken flavored bouillon cube and I cooked down and deboned two ham hocks chopping the meat into bite size pieces and used the broth to cook the lentils in. Yummmy!!! Two thumbs up!!!

This was AWESOME! just what I was looking for. One problem I had was with the cook time. 1 hour was not enough. the lentils were too hard still. I think 2 hours would be best. Also, lentils tend to soak up the water so unless you want it to be a stew like consistency, you will need to add about 2 cups more. (I used about 8 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of water) I also omitted the spinach since I didn't have any on hand. Other then that I loved it! A keeper for these upcoming winter months!!

Lovely, quite lovely! Used chicken broth instead of water for extra body, doubled the carrots and celery and put a lot more spinach in at the end. Oh, and also tossed in some tomato paste along with crushed tomatoes. Family couldn't have enough!

Sorry, nowhere near enough flavor.  The problem is that using water makes it very weak.  I ended up adding 4 cups of chicken stock to try to fix it after cooking it down a bit.

This was great. I DID NOT use 1/4 of olive oil and did not miss it either. I used just enough to get the onions and carrots going. I used all vegetable broth in this instead of using chicken to keep this a vegetarian meal. I loved how easy it was to throw this together. I will be making this again, I think next time I will be adding some zucchini, squash and bell pepper.

This is a staple at my house. I can make a huge pot and freeze the leftovers.   Tweeks I've made: I always leave out the celery and spinach. And I use 2 tsp of generic Italian Seasoning instead of the oregano and basil because I always have that on hand. I also use Italian seasoned diced tomatoes which adds a lot to the recipe. I just throw in a whole bag of lentils I have no idea it's two cups or not. Easily the biggest change - I use a LOT of balsamic vinegar. I don't know how much I throw in the pot but it's quite a bit and I always add extra to the bowl that I eat out of. The balsamic vinegar makes this soup really outstanding. Without it, it's just so-so.

My family enjoyed this soup, and I added some roasted garlic chicken sausage to make it a bit heartier.  The vinegar at the end gives a nice flavor (I used balsamic), but it seemed like it needed something else.  Since my husband likes it, I'll make it again, but might try adding some cumin or something else to give it some oomph.

It's not like this is something different than what everyone else said, but: this soup is absolutely magic.  It is amazingly delicious, quickly very filling, and you feel healthy eating it.  I used a lot of the suggestions from other reviewers (mainly based on what we had in the house)... I think I doubled the spices, I know I added in at least one and possibly two cans of stewed tomatoes (I love tomatoes) and a can of diced, along with spinach, potatoes, a little lemon juice, and more garlic.  Oh! and I didn't add a bay leaf.  Oh, and even if you get to be almost done and look at the vinegar and pull a face, don't worry: it's just right.  I was crushed when we ran out.  Edit: Months later, still craving this soup, overjoyed that we're nearing the not-quite-so-hot weather and I can fix this again.

The base recipe is very good. My minor changes were omitting spinach and vinegar as I had neither on hand. I also added a couple cubes of beef broth cubes and 1/8 of homemade chili powder. I always add a little chili powder to my soups. TFS...I've always wanted to make lentil soup.

Remarkably flavorful and satisfying! My husband and I just did a juice fast and were looking for some veggie-based dinner ideas.  I followed the recipe using the ingredients as listed with the exception of spinach.  I had none on hand so I had to use kale.  Like others, I did adjust the ratios a little to suit our taste, i.e. more garlic and more veggies.  For me, one hour was not quite long enough; it had to simmer about 1 1/2 hours.  But I expect that from soup.  It's not an exact science.    I think this recipe is very versatile and forgiving.  We can each adjust it easily to suit our personal preferences.  Overall we were pleasantly surprised at how good this soup tastes and agree with other reviewers who said that balsamic vinegar really makes the difference.  I tasted the soup before the vinegar - it was good, but after - Wow, really good! We both went back for seconds. This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing, Marie:-)

Following some other reviews I used 1/4 cup port and broth instead of water--I used beef broth rather than the chicken broth others suggested because I feel like beef is a better complement to lentils. I used a fig balsamic vinegar, kale instead of spinach, and fresh tomatoes since I didn't have any canned (plus tomatoes are in season right now!). I used a mix of lentils: black beluga lentils, green, orange, and brown; it looks rather festive for the start of autumn. Took the suggestion of adding parmesan and serving with garlic bread. Turned out fantastic.

I made this soup yesterday on a cold and snowy Michigan day, and it immediately filled my home with a rich and aromatic aroma. The soup itself is so hearty and filling, and has a wonderful flavor. I made some minor changes to the recipe. I added chicken stock and beef stock to the recipe, along with water. I also increased the garlic to 5 cloves (my family loves garlic), added two fresh vine-ripened tomatoes and one 14.5 ounce can of unseasoned diced tomatoes. I increased the bay leaves to two, added extra carrots and celery, and added baby spinach by hand, probably over a 1/2 cup. I would definitely make this recipe again.

I was a little taken back by the vinegar when I read the ingredients but trust me...make sure you put it in.  I used balsamic vinegar and I can't believe what a great flavor it added.  I followed the recipe exactly otherwise but added some chicken bullion for a little more flavor.  I can't wait to try it tomorrow after it's had a chance to sit overnight.  Great, hearty soup.

I added probably a little more spinach than called for and omited the salt. I used balsamic vinegar instead of regular. I pureed about 1/2-2/3 of the soup to make it extra creamy. Also, I have used a mix of water and whatever extra chicken or vegetable broth I have around. Overall, I thought it was pretty good, but what really made it stand out is when I added parmesan cheese to my bowl.

I found this soup to be very bland.  If you're thinking about making it, definitely add a lot of flavor enhancers.

OH YEAH!!!!! This is good stuff! I just made this and just the smell to start with was worth making this soup.  I adjusted the serving size for 9 and only added 10 cups of water instead of the suggested 12.  I like my soups a bit thick and not so watery.  I added about a teaspoon of powdered onion in addition to the fresh, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, and some more basil and oregano.  I like a lot of flavor and this worked!  I also added three small red potato's, it lacked something and that was it.  Great soup, absolute best lentil soup i've had yet!

I will definitely make this over and over and over. I didn't have celery but it still tasted great. I like to add my spinach after the heat's been turned off so as not to overcook the spinach leaves.

Wonderful soup! Used a clove or two extra of garlic and heaping teaspoons of oregano and basil and upped the bay leaves to 2. Used chicken broth in place of the water and added extra water as necessary. Used a 3T of Rioja (red wine)  in place of the vinegar and just forgot the spinach -- delish!

Got some mixed reviews but overall pretty good.  Nice winter staple.  I've never eaten or made lentil soup before so I made as directed.  This recipe is easily adaptable to suit your own tastes.  Will be making lentil soup again and again.

This is really good and super easy to make.  I did use balsamic vinegar as suggested and loved the change of flavor.  This has been added to the make again in the very near future.

This was my first experience cooking lentils and it was very positive.  I took the advice of others and doubled the herbs, added crushed red pepper flakes, and added diced turkey kielbasa.  I omitted the spinach (not a fan) and the celery (didn't have any), and I also doubled the crushed tomatoes b/c I had the bigger can on hand.  This is an excellent dish, filling and very healthy.  Thank you!

I found this recipe because I was just looking for a way to use the lentils my husband had purcahsed. This recipe was so well loved by my whole family that lentils will be a regular item on this winters shopping list so I can make this soup again & again! I alomst added more vinegar, but am glad that I didn't. The amount suggested is a very nice amount.

Seriously tasty!  I found it a bit bland at first but quickly changed my mind after adding a couple of vegetable boullion cubes.  This dish can't be beat served over brown rice.

DELISH!!! I made this yesterday and just had my first bowl and WOW...so yummy and hearty! 

I made the recipe pretty much as is.  I didn't have Oregano (thought I did) and added a small amount of pre-cooked Italian Sausage the last 30 minutes.  I didn't add the Spinach because I simply forgot to add it before heating up bowl today.  I will throw some in next time just to see what that does for the recipe.  As it is, living alone, I'll eat on it a couple of days then freeze the rest for re-heating later.  

Next time, I'm going to cut way down on the Olive Oil to reduce the fat and will probably omit the sausage for the same reason.

Excellent, Outstanding!  This one is going to be in my permanent rotation!

Very good with changes...Used 4 carrots and 6 celery hearts, 4 cloves garlic, 2 bay leaves and doubled rest of spices also per other review I added 1 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp curry.   Also used diced tomatoes not crushed and 3 cups of water and 3 cups of chicken broth.  Didn't realize till later that it called for 8 cups total of water.  But it was very thick and delicious.  Left out spinach and vinegar.  I did try spinach and balsamic vinegar and didn't like...Family enjoyed very much...thanks for recipe.

This is a great soup! I did feel that it needed a little more "oomph" so I replaced the water with chicken stock and that did the trick! We also used balsalmic vinegar like another reviewer mentioned and left it out on the table so each person could add to it to their own taste. It was fantastic! Thanks!!

Absolutely WONDERFUL!!!  My husband and I both LOVED this soup!!  Very hearty and delicious...the perfect ending to a snowy day!  I added some diced ham, which I browned with some olive oil before adding the veggies at the beginning.  Also, used 8 cups of vegetable broth instead of 8 cups of water.  Also added about a tablespoon of ground cumin with the other spices, and used balsamic for the vinegar at the end.  Served with some shredded parmesan on top of each bowl, and some homemade cornbread on the side!  Will definitely become part of my "winter menus", and will enjoy leftovers tomorrow night!  This is a MUST try if you enjoy hearty, flavorful soups in the winter months.

Yummy. Gave only 4 stars because I followed reviewer Blankin's suggestions using 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, double carrots,  double spices, pinch of crushed red pepper, 1 can of chicken broth (water to make up rest of liquid needed in recipe), lemon juice and port.  Those changes make it a 5 star.  Added shredded parmesan cheese on top of each bowl.

I followed others reviews and used 3 large carrots, 3 celery stalks, 26 oz diced tomatoes, 7 cups of home made chicken stock in place of water, balsamic vinegar,scaled down the olive oil, and added cumin and ground cayenne pepper, and with all my soups I splash a dry white wine in as well.  I also pureed probably 1/2 of it and it blended all the flavors together!  AMAZING.  I am just adding a handful of frozen spinach to each bowl when I have it as to not get it all slimy.  My five year old daughter is taking bites and saying "yum" with every bite.  Then you know it's good!

I thought this was great! Easy, healthy, and very tasty. Per some other reviews, I doubled all the spices and the garlic and used chicken broth instead of water. I also increased the carrots - probably just about doubled them. Definitely delicious with parmesan sprinkled on top. Next time I make it, I'll probably add some sort of meat - probably sausage - at the request of my husband.

Wonderful! I used 5 cups water and 3 vegetarian broth, carrots, onion and potatoes per recommendations from others with garlic, pepper and seasonings.  I had it on low in the crockpot overnight, amazing!  Thanks for sharing! :)

Really great Lentil Soup!! Just added and changed a few things. Instead of 8 cups of water I did 4 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water. I added more garlic, a sweet potato, sweet Italian turkey, 2 bay leaves, and kale instead of spinach. Just great!

I made exactly as directed. My husband loved it. I just thought it was okay, but I don't care for lentils so my opinion on this particular recipe doesn't really count.

This is a wonderful recipe.  My picky kids who usually are -meat and potatoes with nothing touching eachother kids- they liked it!  MUST substitute water for VEGGIE broth.

Very tastey. I did change the recipe a bit. I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 1 cube of chicken bouillon. I used Zuchini instead of celery, cilantro instead of celery, italian seasoned stewed tomatoes instead of crushed. YUM! I'm a meat eater and got full with a bowl of lentil soup. I will definitely use this in our rotation.

This is the best lentil soup I've ever had!  I used half stock/half water, a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes, and doubled the garlic and herbs.  Adding spinach at the end really sends the soup over the top (I only had frozen but it was fine).  I used balsamic vinegar and cut it down to one tablespoon so as not to be overpowering. It was perfect!  I tasted just a hint of it in the soup and it was sooo good. I served the soup with some biscuits. I will definitely be making this again!!

This was an easy recipe and a very good soup.  Pretty much followed the recipe the first time through.  Would like to change up the spices for more of an Indian flare next time.  It was easy and delicious so there will definitely be a next time!!  Thanks for the recipe Marie!

Made exactly as stated, I felt it was 3 star in flavor. But, it easily can be improved by using (like many that rated higher stars, did) broth instead of water, or bouillion granules, and more spices. I also added diced tomatoes, leeks,and turkey sausage, and turned it into a pilaf, because that then made it too hearty, for just a soup.

I haven't tried a lot of lentil dishes, but this one is amazing.  I'm always in a constant push toward more healthy eating/macrobiotic-ish diets, and I tried this one because I liked the ingredient list.  So clean and nutritious!  I found it perfect as is, just using diced tomatoes instead of crushed, and specifically using balsamic vinegar, and cutting the olive oil to 1 tbsp to saute the vegetables.  I also save my vegetable clippings (leeks, tomatoes, mushroom stems, celery ends, carrot ends, old garlic cloves, onions, peppers, etc.) to make a large pot of vegetable stock which I used as the liquid in place of water.  I ate every last drop, and this has become a staple in my fridge.  Thanks for the recipe I was looking for!

A great soup to add whatever fresh vegetables you have on hand to. My sister enjoyed it so much that she took my left-overs home with her! Stayed good for a week and the recipe was simple...I wouldn't change a thing!

I made this soup almost exactly as stated and I thought it turned out great. I did add tumeric in addition to the original spices. I think this made at least 8 servings and I thought there was just enough liquid as is.

Great base recipe. As most here, I have adjusted the spices and added more vegetables. Anyone who knows how to cook knows that you are going to need about 1 1/2 Tablespoons of salt. For anyone new to making soup, this is an excellent decription of how to make soup in general- saute crunchy veggies, then spices, then simmer, then more spices. To me, soup is something that is difficult to give a hard and dry "this is the recipe follow it exactly" recipe.  So many variables- strength & freshness of spices, how much reduction is taking place while cooking etc. This is definitely worth a try and I didn't even mention how visually stunning it is when you use the fresh spinach. I KNOW this will be made many times in my kitchen:)

I made this soup as written, except that I omitted the spinach and added four diced potatoes.  Also, you should know that the type of vinegar you use is crucial.  USE BALSAMIC.  It makes the soup phenomenal.  I know it sounds silly to think that two tablespoons of vinegar could make or break an entire pot of soup, but its true.  Taste the soup right before you add the balsamic and you'll see what I mean.  It takes the soup from standard to extraordinary.

This was very good hearty soup. However, I did some major adjustments, thanks to the help of other reviewers, particularly Leigh from Virginia.  I used vegetable broth instead of water to give it more flavor (next time I will use more broth, as even with 12 cups of broth it still tasted more like a stew than a soup).  Also I sauteed the onions and garlic together in about 2 tbsp. of olive oil (1/4 cup seemed excessive).  Then I doubled the amount of oregano and basil, added 2 more bay leaves, as well as cumin and crushed red pepper flakes.  I also added 1/2 lb of macaroni pasta.  I omitted the tomatoes (because I didn't have any) and I didn't add the spinach and vinegar when I served it (I don't like wilted spinach and I think the vinegar would have made it taste too tart).  So like the other reviewers said, once you "doctor it up" with more flavor this soup is a keeper!

A very good lentil soup!  After eating the canned kind, this tastes 100x better and fresher.  Like other reviewers, I used balsamic vinegar, which is unexpected but pleasant.  Next time I would definitely cut down to 1 cup lentils - 2 cups soaked up almost all the broth.  Delicious!

This soup is perfect for fall!  I used fresh local celery, carrots and spinach.  I substituted 4 cups of the water for veggie broth. I used Italian crushed tomatoes in place of the canned tomatoes because they have more flavor and are sweeter.  This soup was so good and so cheap.  It made a lot, which is great for the freezer.  The most expensive ingredient I used was my 15 year old balsamic vinegar (so worth it as it complimented the soup fabulously).

My husband discovered this recipe and enjoys making this for us.  It is the best soup I've ever had and so healthy!  Doesn't get any better than that!  Definately need to cut the oil to about a tablespoon. Don't worry!  It won't cut down the flavor drastically and it will make it a heck of a lot better for you.

Soup was very good.  My husband loved it. I did not use vinegar and added a little red pepper.  I used a can of tomato sauce and beef broth instead of water. I would definately make this soup again it's a winner.

This was a great soup!  I adapted it a bit; I omitted the basil & oregano, but added thyme and an extra bay leaf. Also, since I was making it the crockpot, I increased the liquid to 10 cups of veggie broth.  I used frozen spinach (half of a bag) and since I'm pregnant and still have some weird food aversions, I didn't even saute the veggies.  I just added it all to the crockpot, except for the spinach, and cooked it on low all day.  When I got home, I turned it to high, and added the spinach.  Yummy!

This soup was amazing.  I remember a friend of my mums making a fantastic lentil soup ages ago, and any atempt by my mother never seemed to match.  But this was soo good.  I added potatoes and served it with bacon, and my boyfriend loved it. Despite being a dedicated meat eater, he didn't want to have the bacon as it spoilt it!!

The best lentil soup I ever had!  I added 2 peeled, diced potatoes to the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

Simply awesome...I added a potato, 2 beef bouillon cubes.  This was the first time I made lentil soup, and I can assure, it won't be the last time I use this recipe.

I really enjoyed this soup, it was very flavorful and it's vegetarain! I used one large red and one large yellow onion; I also added 3 red potatos cubed, 1/4 tsp ground cumin, 1/4 tsp onion powder and skipped the spinach. I pureed it a little and it was awesome. Even my boyfriend had seconds and it's hard to get him to eat vegetables. Thanks Marie!

I made this recipe twice in the last two weeks and will continue to make it.  It is the best soup I ever tasted.  My husband loved it also.  It is vegetarian and gluten free and healthy.  I did not have a bay leaf, so I omitted it.  I used balsamic vinegar.  I also subbed frozen spinach for fresh.  When I first made this recipe, I thought what is vinegar doing in soup, but it made all the flavors come together.  Delicious.

Great recipe! Although I changed a couple of things around. I added a bit more of the spices than listed. Replaced plain vinegar with balsamic vinegar, added in squash, half vegetable stock half water, didn't add the bay leaf . Served with a side of white rice and added mozzarella and Parmesan cheese to my bowl. Wish I would've added another small can of tomato chunks though, or tomato sauce but the recipe was still great !

I've made lentil soup many times and it has always been "good."  This recipe is "amazing!"  I did add spicy Italian sausage for additional protein and flavor, but this recipe would be excellent without it, too.  The vinegar (I used Balsamic) at the end is the secret ingredient that makes good lentil soup into amazing lentil soup, so don't leave it out!

Wow, This is a great recipe! I did make a few adjustments. Doubled the carrots & celery, Doubled the garlic, used half chicken stock and half water & added diced sweet potatoes in the last 15 mins. Also instead of adding the spinach to the soup I placed the spinach in the serving bowl and let the heat of the soup wilt the spinach. Served with toasted garlic bread. Even my husband who is a meat eater loved it!

Very easy to make. I read a few things about lentils after trying to make this soup. I read that using salt or acidic ingredients with the lentils before they are cooked can make them tough or mealy. So what I did was used 8 cups of no salt beef broth and I omitted the tomatoes and I used sun dried tomatoes diced up and put them in at the same time as the garlic. I added two small sweet potatoes diced with the onions and carrots. I made up some mini meatballs of beef and spicy Italian sausage(casing removed)..The best spices I found to pair up for making the meatballs was cumin seed, dried thyme, oregano and basil...dried chilies are a great add in too and chili powder is good added to the soup itself before the broth goes in also just a tsp is enough to change it up. This is a great base recipe so there is lots of ways you can flavour it to your liking adding curry or Thai flavours like lemon grass would be fun too instead of the Italian tomatoey flavour. This is my favourite soup recipe on this site, thanks for sharing it.

Big hit with the family.  Did not add the spinach or the vinegar.  Still a big hit and the great news is that I have leftovers!

This is a comforting healthy soup for a winter day! I made a few changes to the recipe. I increased the ratio to 5 carrots, 3 celery stalks and 5 cloves of garlic. I used 4 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water.  I also added 1/4 tsp of cumin. Right before the hour of simmering was complete I added 1 9oz bag of spinach chopped. The added veggies really helped to balance the amount of lentils. Advice: make sure to use balsamic vinegar as it gives the soup tang!

Fantastic soup.  It's delicious just as it is or can be modified with more vegetables and/or additional spices.  Just make sure you add enough salt!

In all honesty, I had never made soup or anything from a recipe until I followed these simple directions. I was married for 10 years and my wife did all the cooking. We divorced and in bachelorhood, most of my meals were either pan fried, or came out of the microwave. I have always loved lentil soup, but even that was canned; I never had it home made. All I can say is wow! Not only did making the soup from this recipe give me a sense of accomplishment, it was delicious! I substituted a small splash of Tabasco sauce for the ground black pepper and it really enhanced the flavor.  I can’t believe that I made it ( with this great recipe of course). There is nothing like a hot bowl of soup on a cold winter day. I would definitely recommend it.

VERY DELISH! I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and cut back on the water and I didn't have any spinach. I blended the soup to make it more cream-like and froze some for lunches.  Very easy, healthy and delicious! Even my picky husband likes it so that says a lot right there!

The soup itself was very tasty, but there are FAAAR too many lentils in it. IF I ever made it again (doubtful), I would at least halve the lentils. My kids did not care for it, though they are kids, and it is more of a grown-up taste (unless they eat lots of lentils).

I made the Northern India version by adding 1 TBS of the seasoning, Masala in place of oregano, bay leaf and basil. As suggested by others, i used less oil and more carrot, celery and garlic. It came out like a thick stew rather than a soup.

This is such a delicious and heartwarming food for a rainy night. i served it over white rice but brown rice would probably have been good as well.

This is my first attempt at making lentil soup, and I'm quite happy with it.  I did alter the recipe as suggested by so many of the other reviews.  I more than doubled the spices, garlic, and spinach.  I even added a teaspoon of curry.  I used 6 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water.  I pureed half the soup amount to add texture.  I used little olive oil.  I enjoyed it greatly...made a lot more than 6 servings...but I froze half (didn't add the spinach to that portion), so no prob.  Great, simple and healthy recipe.

This recipe is simple and delicious. It's tastier than any lentil soup I've had in a restaurant. I added 3 large carrots and 3 celery stalks, 4 garlic cloves and a little more oregano and basil. I used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of water which eliminated the need to salt. I also added much more spinach and smoked turkey sausage. This is definitely a keeper.

This is one of my favorite recipes, by far. I personally like the consistency of pureed lentil soups, so that's how I prefer to eat this. If you don't mind adding in a little more fat, using bacon and its own grease for frying the vegetables at the beginning is great, as is going half/half with water and chicken stock. Worcestershire sauce is also a good substitute for vinegar if you prefer. Lots of options to modify to your own personal tastes, but this recipe is also great just as it is. Thank you so much for posting it!

Made as written.  Pretty good, very "Italian" tasting (not necessarily a bad thing!)  I think would be five stars with beef.

I am eating this soup as I type this review.  I have made a lot of lentil soup recipes, but this is the best basic recipe I've found.  I tweaked it similar as others did, by tripling the herbs;  I also cut the liquid by 2 cups using 2 cans chicken broth and 1 cup water, and I used 1 c red lentils and 1 c green lentils.  When dished in the bowl, I added 1/4 tsp salt and a good squirt of sriracha to add my beloved heat.  After these, it was excellent.  I believe I would have found the recipe "as is" very bland.  Hope this helps.

I have been making this lentil soup for yearsand it's always a favorite!  I have a hard time finding a 14 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  I substitute a can of petite diced and add it in with its liquid.  I also double or triple the spinach, depending on how much I have on hand.  Using 4 C veg broth and 4 C water gives it a little added flavor.

This is so good!!! I added sausage and a little more of the veggies. I cut the oil in half (probably don't even need it) and only used 6 cups of water cause I love thicker soups. Added a touch of cumin, rosemary, and dried parsley. I didn't have bay whole bay leaves, so I didn't add any.

We thought it was just okay.  It didn't have as much flavor as I had expected.  My husband didn't care for it...I think it is the texture of the lentils that he dislikes in particular.  Most of the soup went to waste.

My main comment is that this soup does NOT make 6 servings, more like 12. I made this for my roommate and I (using all of the suggestions listed, definitely add the sausage - yum!) and while it was a good soup, not our favorite, but definitely good, it made way too much for us.   Maybe instead of increasing all of the spices etc, only use half of the water/broth if you want 6 servings.

I used a lg can of crushed tomatoes and a box of frozen spinach.  Added about a tablespoon and a half of vegetable soup base, and probably 1 1/2 tsp of basil and oregano.  Also, 3 or 4 cloves garlic and a generous 3 T of Balsamic Vinegar.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Delicious!

This recipe made as written is pretty bland. Only after using chicken broth, doubling the spices, and adding cumin and red pepper flakes did it seem to come together. The vinegar at the end is a great touch that I never would have thought of though.

this is the best! Use Mexican stewed tomatoes for a really nice taste. I added about a T. of Tuscan balsamic vinegar at the end of cooking time.

I subbed more crushed tomatoes + chicken broth instead of the water and I also added some bacon for taste....all in all it was a decent recipe that I'm sure I'll use again.  It's very versatile and easy to make your own depending on your personal tastes.  I did add the vinegar but I'm not sure why...what does it do?

Delish! This recipe was very cheap and easy to make!  Based on the reviews I changed it up a bit. I used 4 carrots and replaced the celery with a drained can of green beans. I used 4 cloves of garlic, added a tsp of cumin and a tsp of curry powder,a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes, 4 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water, a full cup of finely diced spinach and a few dashes of red pepper flakes and paprika.  My husband and I are trying to eat less meat andhe is also very picky, but he ate two big bowls of this soup. My 2 year old son also loved it. There were plenty of leftovers so I froze some and tossed the rest in the freezer. It makes about 3 meals for my family of 3. I will be making this at least once a week!

This was an enormous hit with my family (including children ages 8, 5, and 2)! Of course, I added a bunch more spices, etc. because that's how I roll, but I believe this would stand as is just fine!

Very delicious! As other commenter mentioned, I used 4 cups water & 4 cups broth. I also used balsamic vinegar, which really did add something special. I doubled the carrots & celery as well as adding 1 chopped zucchini near the end of cooking.  I used frozen spinach, which I just tossed in near the end and I pulsed the whole thing with my immersion blender, which made the consistency a little thicker, which was nice.  A great success for my first attempt at making lentil soup!

My husband loves lentils. That leaves me trying to find ways to use them quite often. I made this recipe for him and he LOVED it. My 3 kids loved it as well. I did use 2 bay leaves, but my husband said it was too powerful and to just use the one that the recipe calls for next time. This is a definite keeper in our house. We will be making this again and again.

Great tasting!  I made this during a snowstorm.  so I substituted VERY freely, using whatever vegetables I had on hand but keeping the seasoning the same.  (Fortunately, I did have lentils!)  Instead of onion, carrots, celery, & spinach, I used two leeks and the bok choy I found in the fridge; the canned tomatoes were diced, not crushed, & contained mild chili peppers.  Since I had an open container of chicken broth that needed to be used up, I substituted that (minus the container) for some of the water.  My only change that was not dictated by circumstances was my substitution of lemon juice for vinegar. The soup I ended up with was delicious.  We tried adding shredded cheese on top & liked it even better.  If I had had access to a grocery store, I still couldn't have used carrots & celery because my husband is allergic to them.   But if I had no limitations imposed by snow or allergies, I think I'd keep the diced tomatoes with chili peppers and the lemon juice, just to add a little more character.

I really wanted to be a fan of lentils, but this recipe was just ok. Its a nice healthy meal that is just lacking a little in the flavor department. I'll tinker with the leftovers so maybe my opinion will change soon...

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written and it was excellent.  It was a very "lentily" lentil soup.  Next time I think I will add a full can of tomatoes.  Other than that it is perfect. I tried both vinegar and lemon at the end with a small amount of the soup and preferred the lemon.  I have made this twice and used green lentils once and black the next.  Prefer green.

I decided to try this recipe because it seemed like a lentil minestrone, and while my husband isn't fond of more typical lentil soups, I thought he might go for this one.  I was right.  He even promises to help eat the leftovers.  I made the recipe almost as written, only substituting vegetable broth for water, increasing the quantities of garlic and spinach, and adding macaroni to increase the resemblance to minestrone.  I will almost certainly make this again when I have my husband to feed and am in the mood for lentils.

I made this in the crockpot and it turned out just great! I cooked it for 6 hrs. on low.  I used 3 cups of water, 3 cups of chicken broth, and 2 cups of V-8 juice in place of the water, and substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the crushed tomatoes. As someone else suggested, I added a bit of smoked sausage ( which I thinly sliced and browned before I added the last hr.. the men in my family think they need meat) Not only was it good tasting, it was a gorgeous looking soup. I'll make it again.

Very good! With the suggestions from others it came out with a lot of flavor.  *I used 8 cups of low salt chicken broth instead of water. *1 Tablespoon of Balsamic vinegar was enough. *Added 4 slices of cooked, crumbled lower salt bacon.

Very nice and versatile.  Even my kids love this one.  I add 2 cans of tomatoes instead of 1 and no vinegar.  I also use chicken broth in place of water.  You could really do anything to this and it would be yummy.  I add cut up low fat turkey keilbasa and that works great.

Great savory, easy, and healthy recipe! And room to customize!  I went with several other recommendations to double the spices, and double the carrots.  I had some fresh tomatoes that I chopped into medium pieces instead of using canned.  You might find you like it more "soupy" and want to add a couple cups of water during the cooking process.  And finally, instead of using balsamic vinegar, I used about half a can (about 3 oz) of tomato paste (not a huge fan of vinegar).  Be sure to add salt after the beans have cooked!  Followed another reviewer's lead and put some cut up spicy sausage in my BF's bowl. Served with some garlic bread to dunk with, delicious and healthy!!!

Very Good - I am home on this rainy cold day with my son who has the flu.  I made this recipe with what I had on hand and it was great.  I think with the addition of the spinach and celery that the recipe calls for it would be nearly perfect!! My changes....  Home-made tomato sauce to replace diced.  Left out the spinach/celery because I didn't have any.  I did add some celery seed.  I also took some other reviewers advice and used veg broth in place of the water.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious! This reminded me of the lentil soup my mom made when I was growing up. I followed the recipe for the most part, but added fresh mushrooms, omitted the onions, used stewed tomatoes instead of crushed, and threw in more spinach than called for. I also added some crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat and used lemon juice instead of vinegar at the end. Really tasty and perfect on this cold, rainy day. I will make this again, thank you :)

This was a great base for lentil soup.  I did use chicken stock instead of water, and added a tad of cumin and one large potato cut in chunks. I also cut the other veggies into chunks as well.  If you cut them too small they practically disappear by the time the lentils are finished cooking which was one and a half hours.  Used balsamic vinegar because that's all I had. Served with cornbread---very hearty meal on a cold, rainy night.

This is a fairly good recipe:) I would say that it makes 10-12 servings rather than just 6. I did not add spinach as I don't like it, but felt that it was missing cumin, so I added about 2 tsp of cumin and that did the trick. It's a really nice easy recipe.

I like to try a posters recipe first, no additions.  I mean, their creation, they're sharing it for a reason, so try it.  When it says salt and pepper to taste, you usually think, a tsp here, a dab there, you'll find the right flavor. I had to pour salt and pepper in, then went for the strongly flavored adobo to save the soup.  There's a reason so many people here put several changes on this recipe, it's really just a bland base.    That dissapointed me since I really like to try what the poster wants to share.  If I do this one again I'm definitely going with the chickstock WITH salt instead of water.  I wish there was no water listed in the recipe, definitely a problem that'll result in you trying to make up for it later.

This Lentil Soup recipe is about as good as it gets, use vegatable or chicken both as a base (6-7 cups maximum if you like a thicker soup)...add 1 tsp ground cumin, 3/4 tsp curry powder, 1 extra carrot, 4-5 cloves of garlic, no salt, stewed tomatoes, basalmic vinegar, 2 bay leaves, if you like meat add 1/4 lb of pre-cooked chicken 15 minutes into cooking for more flavor. Serve with a crusty bread & salad and you have a satisfying meal...enjoy!

I have had this recipe for 8 years now and have been a fan of it ever since.I had never reviewed it and since I made it tonight I wanted to add my stars worth. I always get floods of compliments and never a drop is spared. While I have done several of the variations indicated by other reviewers, I think what I really appreciate about this recipe is that it is easy, tastes delicious  as listed, and  the varied suggestions are really good and just add different dimensions depending on your audience. Excellent!!!

This was great, however, it needs to be made with broth rather than water. I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed. I also used only 1 T of oil to saute the veggies and added 1 tsp of cumin. Next time I'd like to add a little curry as well. My kids all ate it and some friends loved it too!

Excellent recipe!  I used balsamic vinegar, as recommended, as well as added some zucchini.  I've never made lentil soup before and I dare say, it's the best I've ever had.

Great recipe.  I slightly modified and made it for my boyfriend and I.  I used a pound of Italian sausage uncased and browned, a can of stewed tomatoes which I chopped up and omitted the spinach.  I also added extra garlic, a couple beef bullion cubes and 3 Tbs balsamic vinegar for extra flavor.

This was pretty good. I used water because I didn't have broth on hand, so I doubled the spices and vinegar. I used half balsamic and half red wine vinegars. I also added a dash of crushed red pepper and generous amounts of black pepper. I went easy on the salt. The lentils cooked through in about 45 minutes. It was good right away, but the leftovers are better now that the flavors have had a chance to blend.

This is good if you play around with it to suite your tastes.  I used veggie broth and a lot more than called for as I wanted it soupier.  I doubled the spices like many have suggested and used balsamic vinegar (a little less than called for, it's a bit overpowering to my tastes).  I added extra spinach as it really cooks down and the whole 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  Much better than canned lentil soups, but I did feel it was missing something.

Great, healthy soup! I made a few changes based on the other reviews which is why I gave this 4 stars. I doubled the recipe so I would have a lot left over for the week. Based on that, I added an extra tsp each of basil and oregano. Even though I doubled the recipe, I still only used 2 cups of lentils because I like it brothy. I actually used 20 cups of water in all. I added 4 vegetable bouillon cubes, some crushed red pepper, and a little lemon juice. Fabulous!

Wow- after all the good reviews, I thought this would be a shoe-in. Instead, it was a bland lentil soup. If we try this again, I will sub veggie broth for water. I was underimpressed. Adding some fat free sour cream on top at the end helped a little.

Very good.  We never have celery around so I just added more onion/carrot and it was still great. Balsamic vinegar makes ALL the difference in the world.  

This recipe makes a TON - we kind of got sick of leftovers (there are just 2 of us)!  Next time I'll plan on freezing half so we don't get lentil burnout.

There is nothing exceptional about this soup, but it is a very solid traditional lentil soup, which is excactly what I was looking for. The only 'hole' in the recipe is the variety of vinegar. I tried several (rice, wine, balsalmic, and sherry) and found balsalmic to be the best - it adds a depth that is definitely needed. I also added some bacon (3-4 slices) which had little effect on the flavor. Don't bother with the pork, this recipe does all it needs to do without meat.

Delicious tasty and comforting.  I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2 and 6c chicken broth and 2c water instead of all water.  It makes a lot of soup!  The vinegar and spinach really set this one apart.  Thank you for such an easy and healthy recipe!

This is a great starter recipe. I substituted chicken broth once and vegetable broth the other time. I felt there weren't enough spices added so I greatly increased the current measurements plus added some garam masala. When done cooking I pureed half of the soup in a blender then added back into pot. WONDERUL! Served with some fresh homemade bread this is perfect for a cold day.

I would reduce the amount of vinegar, it seemed to overpower the soup.  
Otherwise - very comforting soup.

Good soup.  I used a lot of the earlier suggestions.  I decreased the olive oil, added more carrots, 4 cloves of garlic, more spinach, chicken stock instead of water, added a potato, pureed 1/2 to 2/3 of the soup, added some parsley and used white basalmic vinegar.  Still needed a bit more of something that I can't put my finger on.  But it is good and does freeze well.

I recently joined Weight Watchers.  By lowering the amount of olive oil used from 1/4 cup to 1/8 cup, the point count was only 6 points for this delicious, rib-sticking main dish soup.

My husband and I enjoyed it but we added an extra can of chicken broth, more fresh garlic, a cup of diced ham for even greater flavor.  Don't forget some parmesan cheese on top when serving.  Good soup for a cold winter day.

This is hands down the BEST lentil soup I've ever had and everyone who tastes it loves it too! I add 4 cloves of garlic to give it a bit more spice, then about a half hour before serving, I add cubed red potatoes. I usually serve it with corn bread and smoked sausage.
Thanks for sharing Marie!

Here is a very yummy lentil soup recipe (see below for my modifications).  I was worried it would be heavy and not nice with this hot weather, but it is *great* chilled and very tasty.  The vinegar adds a nice "coolness" to the soup...
My modifications: removed celery, removed bay leaf; subbed 29 oz can of stewed tomatoes for crushed tomatoes; subbed veggie stock for water; subbed canned lentils for dry lentils (so only cooked soup for 30 minutes, and added lentils in before spinach); added 2 potatoes. 
Simply divine!! It has been feeding me for a week - lots of soup.

Yum!!!  I used chicken broth instead of water, added pepper flakes, extra garlic, and liberally used italian seasoning instead of oregano & basil.  I also skipped the vinegar & spinach at the end because it was already so good.  Thank you!

I liked this more than my husband which is why I only gave it 3 stars.  I think my husband would have liked less basil.  Anyway, I added some vinegar to some of the soup when reheating it & I liked the batch without the vinegar better.  The spinach is a nice touch.  You need to be sure to add enough salt (& pepper) for flavoring.  One other thing-I had to add more cups of water as the water evaporated during cooking.  I added more water when I reheated portions too as it was just too thick.

This is a wonderful lentil soup recipe.  I made it exactly as directed (I am a garlic lover, so I added extra) and the only thing I will do differently next time is add just a bit more water, for a "soupier" soup.  Lentil soup is not only delicious, but so low in fat and calories while chock full of protein.  This recipe is just about perfect!

This is a really good soup, although quite similar to the Moosewood Cookbook's lentil soup.
I'm not sure if I like it better with the oregano or without it, but either way, it's ideal for a winter evening.

I took earlier reviewer's advice and substituted 1/4 of total water with burgandy and another 1/4 of water w/chicken stock.  I also (apologies to vegans) added a ham hock.  This was delicious.  The flavor and smell of this soup is enough to send you into "ever-ever" land!

Luscious Lentils!  Cooked in the pressure cooker for 20 min at pressure, then a little pureeing.  I added cumin, dash of curry, and increased all the spices and spinach for a more flavorful soup.  It's hearty and very healthful!

THis is lentil soup as it should be!

Don't know why we have to cook it for at least one hour.

The spinach is a healthy addition and adds good colour.

I am trying to think of how to give it a bit of pazazz. Maybe a shot of chilli sauce?

Great dish

The spinach adds some much needed colour.  Try topping with shredded swiss.  An excellent recipe for leftovers.

I could give this 4 stars but I had to adjust it some because I figured the way it was written it looked pretty bland. 
Like a lot of reviewers, I used chicken broth/stock instead of water. I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes and also a small batch of chopped tomatoes I had frozen from my garden at the end of summer. I forgot to add basil and I used thyme instead. I also added worcestershire sauce and a little cayenne pepper.  I used a whole 16 oz bag of lentils and I had about 1/2 cup of red lentils so I threw those in. I also had a lot of cauliflower sitting in the fridge so I chopped some of that up in real small pieces and put that in the soup. You really can't even tell it's in there but it was a good way to use it up and add more vegetables. A half cup of spinach?? Come on, that is nothing when it wilts. I used almost half of a bag.
I had to use granulated garlic because after everything was in the pot to simmer I realized I forgot to add fresh garlic.
And I added a hefty splash of balsamic vinegar.
With these modifications I would give it 4 stars.

Super simple and very delicious! I have a hard time getting my kids to eat their lentils but this recipe made it easy. Only changes I made were after reading other reviews. I added a few potatoes, a few more carrots, used some vegetable broth instead of all water and used fresh squeezed lime juice instead of vinegar. I also added a tiny pinch of red chile flakes.

THIS recipe is perfect the way it is! I did add some sausage but could have done without it. This was much better than the lentil & sausage soup also on this website. I love that this came out thicker & heartier!

It came out perfect!!  I used all ingredients except no vinegar and  not as much chicken broth, due to my very low sodium diet. I actually added only 1 cup of chicken broth. My family loved it. I love All Recipes...it’s my go to place for almost anything I want to make or learn how!

This was the best tasting lentil soup I've ever had. It's a great recipe but  I wanted to experiment with a few things, so I did make some changes. First, because I use a lot of Chef John's recipes, I also checked out his recipe for Black Lentil Soup and liked the idea of adding the 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin he uses in that recipe to this one. I omitted the vinegar, and stirred in 3 tablespoons Better Than Bouillon(TM) Vegetarian No Chicken Base. For me, that omits the need to add salt. It got my whole family's two-thumbs up stamp of approval, so it's a keeper. Thanks Marie for a wonderful recipe.

This soup, with few tweaks, was delicious. Half the olive oil, double the carrots, garlic and spinach, half the water replaced with chicken broth. Also, at the end of cooking , I took couple of cups of the soup, blended and returned to the pot. That binds the  broth and the rest of the ingredients together. As a final touch, some chopped parsley right before serving.

I've never made a lentil soup before but this was awesome and I had several requests for the recipe.  Following other reviewers' suggestions, I made these 4 changes... 1) doubled the amount of all Spices, Carrots, and Spinach, 2) used low-sodium chicken broth instead of water, 3) used Balsamic Vinegar at the end instead of normal white vinegar, 4) used San Marzano crushed tomatoes instead of no-name crushed tomatoes.  Served with whole wheat, Clean Cornbread + Salad. YUM!

This is a great recipe, but having said that I have made lentil soup for years and am always up for new additions, suggestions.  I always soak my lentils the night before to speed the cooking process.  This time I used 1 pkg of orange lentils I had on had.  These cook much faster than green lentils.  I always start with a base of 3 stalks finely chopped celery, 1 finely chopped onion, 3 cloves minced garlic, 3 bay leaves, (during last hour I add: 5 small diced carrots and 1 large diced potato.)  I heat some olive oil in a 6 quart dutch oven, sautee onion and celery on high heat, then add garlic and lower heat.  This time I added 1-1 1/2 tspn. cumin, 1/2 tspn. coriander, salt & pepper and the juice of 1 lemon versus the vinegar.  Added lentils to pot, 6 cups chicken stock with 2 cups water. 1 12oz. can tomato puree.  I let this simmer for 4-5 hours until the lentils break apart.  I placed in a separate bowl 1/4 of the lentils and pureed until smooth, then poured back in pot.  This makes for a nice combination of smooth and whole lentils which I love.  I have to say the cumin, coriander and lemon juice made this lentil soup outstanding!!!!  Very nice earthiness especially with the orange lentils which are more 'nutty' in flavor but in a subtle way.  Keep adding these spices until you like the flavor...I always taste as I go when cooking.  I was sooo impressed with these spices, the soup was very warming and the lemon juice gave it a great depth of flavor.  This was delicious!!!

I love this recipe...I did change a few things for my tastes. I grated my carrots, used homemade chicken broth for half of the liquid, added chili powder and crushed red pepper to make it spicy. Instead of tomatoes I added one can of tomato sauce and one can of tomato paste. I eat it all week long for lunch with cottage cheese...keeps me energized throughout the afternoon to hit the gym!

I really like this recipe, although like others who have tried and commented, I find this to be more of a baseline recipe that allows one to add their own flair and style to the dish to really make it extra flavorful. It is very versatile and I have tried multiple variations now such as Italian and spicy/curry. 

Only things I think the base recipe needs to change are Chicken (or veggie, etc.) broth instead of water, and the herbs should be added at the end of cooking (with exception of the bay leaves) so they don't lose their flavor.

My kids actually BEG me to make this for them.  Even my husband, a devout carnivore, likes it.  One bowl is never enough.  Double or triple the recipe - it's that good!  I use homemade chicken broth in place of about 1/2 of the water for extra flavor, but it's okay with just water too.

Pretty easy recipe. I have tried it a couple times and if you follow the directions exactly it's a little bland. Like many reviewers I find it tastiest to make some modifications. I use veggie stock instead of water, double the oregano, basil and garlic. I also pulled about 1/4th of the soup out near the end of the cooking process, pureed it, and put it back in for thicker soup texture. Also, in typical hipster fashion I used kale leaves torn into small pieces instead of spinach. Add it at the very end so it just blanches slightly and it will turn a really nice bright green color. Yum Yum!

This lentil soup was so tasty!  I did make some substitutions, mostly to use what I had on hand.  I used fresh broccoli instead off spinach, 1 can of spicy red pepper stewed tomatoes, 4 cups of vegetable broth for half the water and lemon instead of vinegar.  I added no extra salt except a little in my bowl when I ate it.  It was perfect!  Best lentil soup I ever had!

The flavor of this soup is good but I would not call it a soup. It's more like a thick stew. The lentils soaked up a lot of the water so next time I'll just halve the lentils.  I added Chicken Better than Bouillon to it and also more vinegar and spinach. Next  time, I'll add more veggies in general to it.

This recipe gave me a lot to work with. I was not completely satisfied with the original product, but without it, I wouldn't have been able to achieve what I did on my second attempt, which was exactly what I was looking for. These are my notes:

First, make your own crushed tomatoes. Buy five ripe on the vine tomatoes. Cut a large plus onto their bottoms. Blanche them in boiling water for thirty seconds. Shock them in ice water. Peel off their skin. Cut them in half. Remove their seeds into a small bowl by pushing them out with your finger. Remove green and white parts of tomato and discard. Strain the tomato juice out of the seeds back into the peeled and seeded tomatoes. Crush with hands. Whisk with fork.

Cook with smiling cover for one hour and forty minutes, stirring every twenty minutes.

Add an extra cup of water.

Use five cloves of garlic instead of two cloves of garlic.

Use one half teaspoon of oregano instead of one teaspoon.

Use one-and-a-half teaspoons of basil instead of one teaspoon.

Use half of a tablespoon of vinegar instead of two tablespoons of vinegar.

Salt over top of pot in a zig-zag, twice with sea salt (preferably iodized)

Pepper with a grinder to taste.

T thought this recipe was awesome.  I had my own chicken broth made and used that instead of water.  I had 10 cups of broth and wanted to use it up, so I added two extra carrots, 1 cup of spinach, doubled the spices and used balsamic vinegar.  I used the same amount of lentils.  It was delicious.

I doubled the garlic and spices since I like flavor and those who doubled didn't have any complaints.  I added a couple of extra carrots and replaced 6 cups of water with chicken broth.  BTW, 2 cups of lentils happens to be a 16 oz bag.  I changed the plain vinegar to balsamic because I love it and couldn't resist adding the 3 tablespoons of port wine because I love it too!  My salt and pepper to taste ended up being a tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper.  I didn't add spinach because I was planning to have leftovers and didn't think it would hold up well.  I used a hand held wand to puree about half of the soup to make it thicker.  I think this soup is much better the next day, so I highly recommend making it the day before.  It just barely fit in a 4 qt pot, so you might want to set your sights on something bigger!

I used this recipe as a base for making a more flavorful soup. I recommend substituting vegetable or chicken broth for 1/2 of the water and at least doubling the herbs. I also put in an entire bag of baby spinach and made a few other adjustments.

I thought this was a great, simple recipe. When reading reviews some said they made it vegetarian style or did something to reduce sodium. There's no meat in this recipe and its says salt to taste! WTH

Great recipe! I modified though; scaled down the 1/4 cup oil to 2-3 Tbl., used 2 cups of vegetable broth and 6 cups water, and substituted the spinach for a bunch of kale.

I found this recipe because my nutrition report on the My Fitness Pal app showed that I was deficient in a variety of categories. I did a search on the Internet and learned that lentils would bolster my deficiencies. So, I found this recipe and I think it's great for its taste and nutrition.

This was a big hit. I added some sausage and substituted chicken broth for half of the water. I added more water as it simmered as well--about three cups over the course of an hour.

Great soup! Easy to make. I didn't add the spinach but threw a diced fresh jalapeño pepper with the onion and carrots to give it a kick. I garnished it with cilantro.

After reading other reviews, I made the following modifications: decreased the olive oil to 1 tbsp, omitted the bay leaf and celery (doubled carrots), used 1.5 tsp each oregano AND basil, used chicken broth instead of water, and used a 10 oz package of frozen (thawed, squeezed) spinach instead of fresh. I also rinsed the lentils, though it doesn't say to in the recipe. This is so easy to make, and is healthy and delicious. Thank you for sharing!

This is an excellent soup! I added the whole bag of lentils which ended up being 2 1/2 cups. This was a thick soup. I read other reviewers and doubled the garlic, carrots & celery. I used a whole medium red onion. Added two bay leaves, 1 1/2 tsp Oregano & Basil. Because I used diced tomatoes with oregano and basil. I also added 1/4 tsp of ginger & 1/2 tsp cumin & paprika, 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes. I used four cups chicken broth & because I had a little pork roast leftover with it's broth, I shredded the pork and added water to equal the remaining four cups. The house smelled awesome while this soup simmered. I added more spinach than the recipe called for and topped my bowl with parmesan and declare it GREAT!!

Very good.  Upped the garlic and spices; used half broth instead of all water; frozen spinach; balsamic vinegar; and added some chicken sausage toward the end since my husband loves sausage.  Also added some lemon juice to brighten the flavor a bit and some sugar to balance the tartness.

I like this recipe.... This is the first time I made lentil soup and I'm pretty pleased with the results. I read one review of a person who hated how individuals changed/added to the recipe, but that is one of the things I really enjoy about Allrecipes.com (the reviews that help make a recipe better). For me, I added more onions and garlic (because I'm a huge fan), sugar (because my mama always said to add a little sugar to a recipe with canned tomatoes due to the bitterness), cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, and a little bit of Italians seasoning. I also added a strip of thick cut bacon for more flavor. I think the recipe really needed that extra boast. I didn't have any spinach so I used frozen kale instead. Lastly, and probably most importantly,  I substituted chicken stock in place of the water. The soup is pretty good. I think I will add another bacon strip the next time I make it. Overall, I highly recommend this recipe...

Added 1/2-1 cup red merlot, didn't use vinegar, and was absolutely wonderful.  Will add two more cups of veggie stock for next round, it's more like a stew and leftovers will be dry.  FANTASTIC.

I made this as is and the water makes it very watery tasting and adding vinegar didn't help only made it taste watery with a vinegar aftertaste. 
I think if you are going to make it with water you need some kind of meat flavor, maybe some ham would help. Or maybe broth instead of water?

I put all the ingredients except the spinach in the crock pot and it turned out perfect! I added the spinach only for the last half hour or so. I served it over rice for a heartier meal. Left overs went a long way for lunches.

Easy to make and turned out delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I forgot to add the spinach at the last minute, but i can always add it later.  I froze half of the recipe for future lunches or dinners.  Great recipe!

This is a great soup! I make a bunch of it and freeze it for later consumption :). Only thing I do differently is substitute 2-3 cups of the water for some low sodium veggie broth. It gives it a lot more flavor.

Great recipe.  Even fussy husband who hates spinach loved it!  I used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of crushed and upped the spices.  I used red lentils which worked well too.  It was ready after only 45 minutes of simmering.  Husband asked me to throw in some cauliflower next time I make it.  It was really good!

Spinach is so easily wilted that you don't need to add it to the soup pot.  Just chop it and serve it as a condiment at the table to add to your bowl and stir it in.  It will wilt perfectly.  Spinach tends to get black and stringy in leftover soup and makes it muddy looking, so it's best to let individuals add it (or not!) at the table.

This was absolutely delicious.  I was a little skeptical at first because most of the water cooked out and the lentils seemed gummy.  I fixed this by adding an additional two cups of water.  I used a little salt and lots of black pepper and the end result was great.  I will make this often as it is easy, tasty and super nutritious.

Good the first time.  Better the next time after time in the freezer and with Tabasco Sauce splashed on top.  Yummy! Served with toasted slices of fresh rye bread.  Easy to make.  Will go onto our regular rotation list.  Thanks Marie for posting your recipe.

This was exceptionally good, however, I didn't make it as it was written although I made only a few changes.
I used 4 carrots, about 4tbl garlic, 8 cups veg. broth, 2 cans of diced tomatoes with basil and about a tbl spoon of cumin. I also saw no need for the amount of oil used so cut that down to about a tablespoon full to saute the onion, carrots and celery. After the onion was nicely soft I added the tomatoes and cooked that up for a min or so. I then added the veg broth, salt, pepper and cumin, brought it to a boil then simmered with lid on for at least an hour. I did not add the vinegar, nor the spinach. This was SO tasty and hearty on a freezing night and very quick to whip up.

I make a lot of changes - but they all pay off such that this is one of the dishes I'm "known for" these days.  First: I double ALL the vegetables (four carrots, four or five stalks of celery, two onions, four cloves of garlic and closer to 2 cups of spinach), then I double all the spices.  I use someone else's recommendation of using 28 oz of tomatos and then making the rest of the "water" a combination of water and vegetable broth (less the extra 13.5 oz tomatoes).  Lastly, instead of regular vinegar, I use balsamic vinegar to taste and it is PHENOMENAL. One of my winter favorites and my friends can't get enough!

Really liked this soup, kept everthing the the same except for the spinach which I added 4 cups, instead of the half cup. A good healthy meal.

Very tasty!  I did add some more spices, but the bay leaf was a good addition.  My three-year-old at her whole bowl.  A nice and easy way to get lots of veggies in a meal.

I have made this soup a few times, and absolutely love it. I tend to add potatoes if I have them on hand. Lentil soup is one of my favorites, and this is the best I have had, hands down.

This recipe is a nice base for a curry lentil soup! I omitted the oregano and basil, as well as the spinach (because I didn't have any), and sometimes the vinegar, and it was still delicious! I double the onion, carrots, and celery because it makes it a little heartier and creamier when I handblend about half it--makes it easier to eat with some whole wheat wraps, too. I was inspired by the ethiopian lentil soup I had, eaten with chapati.  It's great with a twist of lemon before serving, gives it a nice, fresh balance of flavor, and a dollop of plain greek yogurt if you want to go all out, as a creme fraiche substiitute. This recipe calls for about 2 tbsps of indian curry powder.

Thought this was great! I also used 2 cans of tomatoes and 4 cups vegetable broth with 3 cups of water instead of 8 cups of water. It was so delicious even my 3 year olds liked it.

This is by far my favorite lentil soup recipe.  I substituted chicken broth for the water, 3T of lemon juice for the vinegar, added crushed red pepper flakes, and used 1 C chopped green kale instead of the spinach.  Oh, and I used 1T of chopped FRESH oregano and 2T of chopped FRESH basil. Also used red lentils, which tend to dissolve into the soup without having to puree.  Very delicious, great depth of flavor, and healthy to boot!

Thank you for this excellent soup recipe! Hearty, delicious and so quick and easy to prepare! Only changes I made were: I used  generous measurements of basil and oregano (about one and a half times what's called for) and I served over a bed of fresh spinach leaves. (great way to get those greens while adding more texture, without having the spinach turn mushy). Served soup with a crisp green salad and some whole grain bread. Perfect for a chilly, late winter evening!

Really 4 1/2 stars.  Next time I make this I will use a variety of lentil other than red.  The red ones turned too much to mush.  Used kale instead of spinach.

This soup was delicious.  It could not have been easier!  I cooked mine about 3 hours, and it thickened up nicely.  I sliced the carrots thickly, and family loved them.  I added a 28 ounce can of tomatoes instead of a 14.5 ounce can.  I added 2 cups of chicken broth and 6 cups of water to equal the 8 cups.  I also added balsamic vinegar after reading other reviewers' suggestions, and more than 2 tablespoons.  Next time I will add more garlic because I like alot of garlic.  Other than that, I will plan to make it the same as this time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Literally eating this right now. I decided to toss everything into my slow cooker. I made a few changes to the recipe based on what i had in my kitchen. I put a hand full of baby carrots in and home made tomato sauce (about 1/2 cup) then added some cherry tomatos in. The vinegar really adds a great flavor so after a few hours I added a bit more. I also did about 6 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water. I am in love with this soup and wish I had packed more for lunch!

Thoroughly enjoyed this recipe! Followed it as is.  Left the lid of and simmered a while longer to thicken.  Really a meal within itself, but would add ditallini for even more substance!

Good base recipe that can be changed according to your own personal taste with ease. I added roasted ground cumin, coriander, oregano & madras curry powder, in addition to the basil & bay leaf. I also swapped the water for 1/2 chicken stock & half V8 vegeatable juice, adding a little extra because I prefer a brothy soup. Thanks for the recipe!

So good and filling!  This is the first lentil soup that I have ever tasted, much less made (I have made it several times now).  I followed the suggestions to double the veggies and also added a large can of the crushed tomatoes, instead of the smaller can.  Additionally, I used low-sodium vegetable stock instead of water.  Delicious!

This was great. However, I had to add a bit of salt (I am obsessed) and I only used 7 cups water instead of 8. I used bouillon cubes instead of just water as well. I put Parmesan on top but next time I will have fresh shredded Parm instead. Also, I plan on adding potatoes and bell peppers, with fresh Cuban bread on the side in the future. I used bouillon cubes too. I don't know if it was one of the best soups I've had, but with some tweaks it could be a lot more suited for me. It's all about personal tastes. It is a good base soup however.

Literally have made this soup 3x in last month.  It's fantastic.  Hearty and healthy, I did the math and it's 8 points plus for those on weight watchers - but that's for a 2 ladle serving.  It's so hearty and filling you really only need 1/2 a serving to feel satisfied.  YUMMY both my husband and daughter love it and have made dinner and lunches for following day.  Great recipe.

This was yummmmoo! I made this with only a few changes.  I used a 28oz can of tomatoes and a 1 lb bag of lentis. Sauteed some bacon in the pot before hand and used the bacon grease instead of the oil. I added extra chicken broth to account for the additional lentils and used kale instead of spinach.  I also added a tsp of cumin and a tsp of curry.  Topped with bacon and parmesan cheese. I gave it four stars because I think if it were prepared as written it would have been pretty bland, but with a few alterations to suit my own tastes it was wonderful! This made a ton of soup and I can't wait to eat the leftovers this week!

this recipe is absolutely delicious...best thing about this is that i use it to lose weight. just eliminate the canned ingredients because  the preservatives takes longer to digest in your system and u don't get any results. i usually make a big pot and keep it in the fridge and eat it a few times during the day. it's still delicious without the tomatoes.

I made this on a sick day with the leftover liquid from a collard greens experiment and chicken stock. Really good! I liked it with the balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese. Worked well as a meal with biscuits on the side. I'll be freezing lots of leftovers too!

I made this tonight for my family. We've never had lentil soup, but I decided to give it a try. I knew my kids would whine and complain when they saw it, and they did. When they actually tried it 5 of the 6 LOVED it. I made a batch of rolls to serve with it. This was absolutely awesome. Next time I will omit the vinegar. I took a taste before I added the vinegar and I liked that flavor better. The vinegar gave it a slight tart, vinegar (I used balsamic like others suggested) taste, but it was still amazing.

I used green lentils, and a lot more liquid...28oz crushed tomatoes, 2 cans chicken broth and probably 6 cups of water. I added cumin and curry, one teaspoon each, as was suggested by another reviewer.  Added three potatoes and turkey sausage one half hour before it was done. Emulsified it a bit with my in pot thing...very delicious! And certainly a meal.

Simple and delicious. I combined red and green lentils and did not make any changes to the recipe. On day two the flavor improved and this is one of the best soups I have ever made.

This is the best recipe yet.  I didn't even modify except for fresh herbs instead of dry and it was perfect.  It was easy, fast, and tasty with little clean up.

Love this recipe!!  It's wonderful on cold rainy fall days or any time you want something hearty.  I have made it twice - once I used the Italian stewed tomatoes as one reviewer suggested and that was delicious.  This time I followed the recipe as is but added some cubed up left over ham and it was fantastic!!  You can play with this recipe, or make it as is, either way it will come out great!

I only used half an onion and every veggie besides that and the celery was frozen. Added corn, green beans and peas, red pepper flakes, paprika, thyme instead of the bay leaf, half and half chicken broth and water. I put too many lentils in and wish I could've put half red and white, but didn't have any red. It tasted good and was filling, but still kinda bland. My hubby put lemon pepper in it and said it tasted great.

Honestly, by itself, this is a two star recipe. It's bland and watery. However, if you change a bunch of stuff, use stock instead of water, up the spices, add a ton of cayenne, cumin, paprika, chile, and even some curry powder, then it's very good.

YUM, we loved it--DH does not even usually like lentils! Pureed a few cups in blender, used double garlic & herbs, chicken broth for half of water, forgot the spinach & left out vinegar(would be good with those too, though, recipe is very forgiving as soups usually are!)

Oh my goodness!  So yummy!  This was my first time cooking with lentils, and this was good - even when I accidentally put in split peas instead of lentils!  :)  I was able to scoop about abut a cup of the peas and replaced them with the lentils.  The "Pea and Lentil" soup was delicious!  Makes a lot, so plenty of leftovers for us!  Yum!

honestly. this is one of the best soup recipes ever. i've made it over 5 times and every time it turns out wonderful and doesn't last long. i find it's also a great base to add your own personal touches--like so many others have done here. personally, i add extra garlic, carrots; and instead of 8 cups water, i use a mix of vegetable juice (eg. V8) and vegetable stock. you won't be disappointed with this recipe!

With some alterations this made a very good soup. I only had about 1 1/2 c. lentils. I doubled all the vegetables and spices and added 2 carrots and some chopped cabbage. Then I added about 12 oz. of broth reserved from a corned beef roast, and 2 cubes of beef bouillon. Very delicious! I served with foccacia bread from this site.

Fantastic recipe, I didn't even know I liked lentils this much until I made them this way!
I followed the suggestions and doubled the spices, added a few dashes of red pepper flakes, used only a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, 3 cups vegetable broth and 4 cups chicken broth, 1 cup water. I also had a leftover smoked ham hock in my freezer, so I threw it in there too, YUM YUM YUM!!!

Very delicious, very easy. I did as some others suggested and doubled the oregano and basil, while also adding a teaspoon each of cumin and curry powder. I used balsamic vinegar (though I might add a bit less next time) and used vegetable stock instead of water for the liquid. Tasty and filling.

I'm rating this so that I know what NOT to do next time.  I took the advice of BLANKEN and added 28 oz more tomatoes and doubled the spices.  It was waaaaay to tomatoey for me.  The spices were okay, but next time I make this I will follow the recipe exactly and update my rating.  Thanks Marie for the recipe!

I would reduce the oil to one tablespoon, use chicken stock instead of water and fresh tomatoes pureed in a blender instead of canned tomatoes(the taste makes a world of difference). 
To turn this to a spicey lentil soup replace oregano with two teaspoons each ground cumin and corriander, a teaspoon of ground ginger and some chili or cayenne pepper.

delish! very versatile in that you can add or omit many of the ingredients. I used a 28oz can stewed tomatoes and reduced the water by 1 cup. Next time I would use vegetable broth for more flavor.

We loved this soup! I substituted 4 cups of veg broth in place of the water and balsamic for regular vinegar. I cut way down on the olive oil and added a potato, sweet potato, mushrooms (basically whatever I had sitting in the fridge) 1 t cayenne pepper and 1 t tumeric.   It was delicious! Half of my family has recently gone vegan and it's a challenge to find recipes that both the herbivores and carnivores like. This soup satisfied everyone. I will definitely make it again!

Easy, tasty, healthy -- such a wonderful combination for a recipe!  I've made this three times now and it's come out great each time.  I used balsamic vinegar and it gives it a delightful hearty taste.  This is a new comfort food.

This recipe is a little bland as is.  I added a few things to please my taste buds: cumin, curry powder, crushed cayenne pepper, and beef bouillon.  It turned out pretty good.  Next time, I will use vegetable broth instead of water.  However, after cooking this soup, I topped slices of organic, multigrain bread with the vegetable mixture, and it was delicious!!!!

Somewhat plain. I doubled the recommended spices (including garlic) and I added cumin. The cumin was what made me decide this was worth making again.

What an amazing recipe! Due to what I could find and what I had on hand, here are the changes I made:  -Added a bit of spicy sausage -2 cans of crushed tomatoes -Doubled the spices -Added a chicken bouillon cube (couldn't find chicken broth)  Delicious! As others have said, it's a forgiving recipe that you can add what you have on hand.

I used lemon juice instead of vinegar.  I also added cumin.  I can't imagine lentil soup without cumin!  I put extra onions and garlic.  One onion and 2 cloves of garlic is not nearly enough for a big pot of soup.  I also added rice.  I used my own homemade vegetable broth instead of water... and voila...

Delicious!!! I nixed the celery because I hate it... used 6ish cups of chicken broth instead of water, no spinach, added some cumin, used balsamic vinegar, and doubled the other spiced. And I did a little secret trick that my aunt recommended: I made some bacon and put 2 tbs of the bacon grease in the pot at the beginning and sauteed the onions in that! You can also add the bacon in... but I was so hungry that I ate the bacon :) Then I added a few tbs of oil later, but not 1/4 cup. Result? Absolutely delicious!

Delicious! Didn't have tomatoes but otherwise followed the recipe more or less. I increased the spices and added some cayenne but only used about a cup of lentils. It was very good and I will definitely make it again! Love the mix of spinach, carrots, potatoes and onions. I used balsamic vinegar, which was a GREAT addition.

One of the best lentil soups I have ever made.  I didn't make any special modifications except I did add a small can of tomato sauce and used 4 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water.  Excellent!!!

LOVE the flavors going on here. I used red wine vinegar and I loved it. I also used half chicken broth instead of just all water. I doubled all the spices and you can add as many carrots and celery stalks as you would like - I did 3 each. I also added northern white beans a small potato for some extra texture and flavor. I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed - use what you have in your cupboard!! Love it!!!

YUMMMMMMM! This soup turn out to be one of the most delicious soups I've ever made. Thanks for the lemon substitute (instead of vinegar). I added 4 cups of vegetable stock and the rest with water.  I also added frozen spinach as a slight modification. Everything turned out great. I'll have to try the balsamic vinegar next time...

This soup was delicious, but I am giving it three stars because it calls for way, way too much water.  I thought 8 sounded like too much so I added only 6 cups, and still had to spend lots of time reducing it to get it to have any kind of body.  If you like a lentil soup that has a lot of broth, keep the recipe the way it is.  If you like a thick lentil soup, start with 4 or 5 cups and add more if necessary.

I have tried many many lentil soup recipes. I love lentils and I have got to say this recipe is the best I have tried so far. I will be making this again and again definitely a staple in my household now. I didnt have bay leaf so I omitted it. Cant wait to try it with that extra flavor. I did like many other reviewers double celery and carrots. Just perfect!

I have never had lentil soup before now, and I wasn't too crazy about the lentils but because there are so many other vegetables in it, it made the lentil soup delicious.   I made a quadruple batch, added  3 medium potatoes cubed (per batch) like another user suggested. I added extra garlic and 1/2lb of ground beef per batch broken up into little tiny pieces. I also added an extra 1/2 can of crushed tomatoes and a small can of diced tomatoes for a stronger tomato base flavor. I added 1:1 chicken broth and water. I doubled the spinach also.   It is a very hearty delicious soup that even if you are not too crazy about lentils, there is enough of other stuff that it should still delicious!

I was planning to serve this for dinner and cooked it for about 5 hours on high in the crock pot but the lentils were still tough to the bite.  I ended up leaving it on high and forgetting about it and going to bed.  I woke up at 2am and turned off the crock pot.  In the end, it cooked for 12 hours on high and it was perfect!  I used a lot more spinach than called for, and I didn't slice it -- just tossed in baby spinach leaves whole.  And I used balsamic vinegar as other reviewers suggested.

Very good!! I followed others feedback.. added 28 oz can crushed tomatoes, doubled the spices and added 2 potatoes. I also sprinkled parmesan cheese over the soup when done. Yummy!! Thank you for a great base recipe that stands on it's own, and can be modified to individual tastes and preferences! A Keeper.  This recipe does make a very large batch. :)

Nice and hearty. Next time I would only use 1 1/2 cups of lentils. I also added green beans and frozen spinach during the last 15 minutes of cooking. I also used balsamic vinegar- it makes the soup.

This was a very good recipe. I made some changes: I added 2 onions, 4 carrots, 4 stalks of celery, 6 garlic cloves. I doubled all of the spices and added a dash of hot sauce for a little extra flavor. I also tripled the amount of vinegar. I did need to add extra water as the soup cooked otherwise it would have been too thick. Next time I would use vegetable stock in addition to the water. My family & I enjoyed this very much.

I made this recipe a couple of nights ago and I loved it. I dice the carrots in small pieces though since i don't like the round pieces. Next time i will try to puree it so the kids eat - they will eat fresh carrots and celery, but not in soup. :) In pureed soup everything looks the same :) For sure will be making it again, thanks!

As written, this soup tastes good, but it doesn't have enough flavour for me. As others say, it is a good base recipe. I replace most of the water with broth, add more carrots, celery, onion and garlic then called for (probably double really) and I also add some cumin, which goes great with lentills. I add a parmesan on top when serving. With the changes, it is very good.

My family liked this soup a lot. I did follow other recommendations. More carrots, more celery and I used chicken broth instead of water. I rinsed the lentils and cooked them in the chicken stock right away while I chopped the veggies and sauteed in just a little olive oil. When they were starting to get soft, added a little water, then spices were put in and cooked about three more minutes. Added to already cooking lentils with the tomatoes. This saved about 1/2 hour cooking time. Followed other suggestions and pureed about half of the soup and added it back in for thickness. My previous recipe for lentil soup called for puree all of the soup, but I like the idea of just half. I forgot the vinegar and will put in next time. Was delish with a dollop of sour cream on top.

This is a great recipe but per a recommendation, we used balsalmic vinegar which I don't think matched the flavor of the soup.  It now tastes like great lentil soup with balsalmic vinegar in it.  It's not bad, but the balsalmic flavor stands out rather than blending in to enhance the flavor as a whole.  Next time, I'll probably use red wine or apple cider vinegar.

This was very easy and delicious. I enjoyed it while I was on a diet - it's very healthy. I added some chopped eggplant because I had it on hand. Not so traditional, I know but it was good. I plan on making this again soon as the weather is getting cooler.

I have made this recipe many, many times, and it's always delicious.  I usually add random vegetables I happen to have on hand, and it's always good.  I sometimes use vegetable stock for more flavor.  The spinach and vinegar (usually red wine vinegar) really complete this dish.  I usually serve it with homemade pita chips on the side.  Delicious.

Excellent base lentil soup recipe!  This recipe is great exactly as it is written, but like most people I have made changes over time.  If you have never made lentil soup before, use this recipe, then the next time you make it start to get creative.    I add cumin, marjoram, smoked sausage (a must for me), and a whole lot more spinach.

My daughter and I truly enjoyed this, but my husband did say it still had "to lentilly" of flavor, and he just doesn't care for lentils.  I did put in chicken bullion (in the water) and I did not add the spinach.  I also used lemon juice instead of vinegar.  I needed to add about an extra cup of water to the pot because the water cooked out, and it was beginning to stick. Overall, if you like lentils, this is great.  We also fried some sausage (just regular breakfast saugsage) to have on the side for whoever wanted to add it to the soup.  It was great.  We had Monterrey Jack cheese instead of the suggested (reviews) parmesean.  The cheese was a good addition.

This soup was very tasty, however I ran into a few problems.  I followed the suggestions of others to double all of the spices, and I'm glad I did.  Also, I didn't realize that the recipe would make so much!!!!  I think half of this recipe would have fit nicely into my biggest soup pot.

Great Soup! I'll add 1 cup lentils next time to make it more soup than side dish. I added Sweet Red Curry Paste 2 oz jar, along with doubling the spices, and adding Curry Powder 1 tsp, which gave it an exotic flavor. Yum!

I have never worked with lentils before and I LOVED this!!  I added more tomatoes and more liquid.  It is more like a stew than a soup.  But is so so good.  I will definitley be making this again, again, and again!!

I made this recipe according to the recipe given and it was very good soup. The salt-to-taste is the key here. Using stocks or seasonings that are based on salt do the same thing. This would be great with a vegetable stock, but this recipe gave me the hearty, rich lentil soup I was looking for. Thank you!

I made quite a few changes, so I deducted 2 stars for that, but the end result was healthy, but still tasty, so I added a star for that. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used 4 large cloves of garlic.  The recipe really needed about 10 cups of water and it was still stew-like. I used about 1/2 cup marsala and used chicken bouillon to make the water broth.  Also, I threw in some red pepper flakes and almost doubled the spices.  I didn't have spinach or celery, but I don't think I'll add them in the future--maybe zucchini? Overall, this was a very tasty and healthy dish, I'll make it again.  Oh, and adding a bit of red wine vinegar to the bowl right before serving makes such a difference!

I have made several lentil soups I have liked, but this one I--and my husband (who is not usually thrilled about a vegetarian meal)--love.  Following some of other readers' suggestions, I used a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, 8 c. veg stock instead of water, a tsp. of cumin and balsamic vinegar at the end. It came out more like a stew, which made for a hearty main dish.

I made this soup last night. I used the suggestion of one of the previous reviewers and added 3 potatoes,4 carrots, 4 cloves of garlic, balsamic vinegar, and used chicken broth instead of water. My husband who is Mr. Picky loved it and went for seconds. I shared some with a neighbor and they LOVED it.  This was very hearty and sooooooo good!  Will definitely make again.

Awesome recipe. Followed it pretty much to the letter (other than using chicken broth instead of water) and got great compliments:

"10 out of 10!!"
"This is the best soup you ever made!"

Wow. This is the best lentil soup recipe I've ever tried! I had to make a couple of substitutions based on my kitchen's content (red onion, white balsamic vinegar of which I added 2 xtra T!) but that was it! This is a terrific starter recipe and I'm excited to see how creative I can be with this. Next time I might try adding some different root veggies. This is a winner without cheese added to it!

Great recipe. Wouldn't change a thing. The only thing was I made this during the afternoon so I did not put the spinach in and while I had every intention on adding it in before serving for dinner, my family was so hungry and thought it smelled soooo good they didn't want to wait for the spinach. I did add the Vinegar (Balsamic) and it was delish. Will absolutely make this again!

Followed the recipe exactly.  I love lentil soup, I would have given this one 5 stars had I left out the vinegar.  That ruined it.  I didn't make my kids eat it and we threw out the whole pot.  I had to add a lot of hot sauce just to mask the vinegar flavor to be able to eat it.  If I make again I will leave out the vinegar.

I made this today for the first time - Holy cow! was it good! No kids at home this week, so didn't feel like cooking a full meal - and I had a bag of dried lentils sitting around.  
I left out the celery, which I don't like, and the oregano and spinach, which I was out of.  

I also didn't have any canned tomatoes.  So I peeled and de-seeded 4 tomatoes, chopped in large pcs and threw that in.  I also added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste at the end of cooking to give it a bit more heartiness.  

ALSO - I sliced up chorizo that I had in 1/2 slices and sauteed that up with the onions and carrots. 

My husband was suspicious of it when he came home from work, but when I served it up over a big bowl of rice, he loved it. I think even the kids will eat it up.  I'll most definitely be making this again.

Great soup.  I didn't add the spinach and used chicken broth in place of the water and sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on top when serving.  Very hearty soup.

I made a half batch and there was still a lot left to freeze and have for lunch the next day. It was even better with age! I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used fresh cherry tomatoes smashed up and a dab of tomato paste. The only other alteration was to add some Tabasco sauce and a shake of Tony Chachere's. If you love lentils, try the "Lentils and Rice with Fried Onions (Mujadarrah)" also on this site. They're both really great recipes.

This is very good lentil soup (which I've never eaten before but I was curious and hubby has to eat a high fibre diet).  The only changes I made was to use less lentils as I like a soupy soup and I used chicken broth instead of water. I'll make this again for sure.

This is one of my favorite soup recipes. I like to leave out the onion and add a few more bay leaves. Liquid levels could be adjusted for texture - as is delivers a more stew-like dish. Served with some crusty bread, this soup is a filling meal.

I made this soup for my mom and she said it is the best lentil soup she had ever had. The only changes I made were to increase the garlic, oregano and basil, use 2 bay leaves, subbed some of the water with veg stock, upped the liqiud to 10 cups and added extra tomatoes.

We absolutely loved this recipe.  I made a few changes because of what I had on hand.  Instead of a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes, I added 16 oz. of tomato juice.  Instead of 8 cups of water, I did 16 cups of chicken broth due to people's comments that it wasn't soupy enough.  This was the perfect "soup" consistency, I think.  I did not add the spinach because I didn't have any.  I'm sure it would be delicious with it.  I added only 1 T of balsamic vinegar.    It was really yummy!  I will be making it again this week.

Great soup!!  I added more garlic, 2 cans of vegetable stock, and 1/2 lb of macaroni pasta.  I then topped each bowl with shredded parmesan cheese and a thick slice of whole wheat bread. This is going to be a new staple in our house!  I'm a vegetarian and I ate this with three meat eaters.  They all loved it and none of them even missed having meat for dinner.

I've made this a few times with the same modifications - I cook about 1/2 lb. of chopped smoked sausage with the vegetables, omit the bay leaf (I never have any), use red lentils, 28 oz of crushed tomatoes, and use half water and half chicken stock.  I chop the spinach and put it raw in the bottom of the bowl (so it is optional) and pour the soup over top - it doesn't take long to wilt it.  Instead of adding the vinegar, I drizzle Balsamic vinegar over each serving - delish!!  We love this soup when the temperature dips outside, and we need a hearty soup.

This is a great healthy recipe. I did make some minor adjustments due to what was @ hand.  I used chicken broth in place of water.  Used fire roasted tomatoes, a couple shakes of red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch :)  Didn't have fresh so used frozen chopped spinach & added 2 precooked chicken sausages for some extra tooth appeal.  I also added 3 smallish potatoes but would not add them again ~ don't think they are needed. Delicious! My husband who never really cared for lentil soup loved it and ate 2 nice bowlfuls & gave me a 5 star rating.

This was one of the best soup recipes I've tried on this site.  It was absolutely delicious and will probably taste even better the next day.  Even seems like it would freeze well.  I used a lb. of crumbled sweet sausage (taken out of it's casing) for extra flavor, and one large and one small can of chicken broth instead of water. I browned the sausage, removed to a dish then sauteed the veggies, garlic and seasonings in a little olive oil, added sausage back to pot and cooked for 15 minutes, then added the lentils, broth and tomatoes, (I used the fired roasted w/garlic tomatoes as another reviewer suggested and they were great for this soup) and let it simmer for 2 hours.  Stirred spinach in about 1/2 hour before I was going to turn off the heat. Never even added the balsamic vinegar as it was already so good that I didn't want to take a chance on changing the flavor.  This is a keeper. Having the rest today and I already can't wait to make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved it!  I added more carrots and celery, cut the lentils to 1 1/2 cups and added more vinegar.  It is even better leftover! Thanks for the great and healthy recipe.

It's odd.  I made a soup last night that was a little bland looking and "tweaked" it a bit and was trying to review it today.  When I clicked on this, this was almost the exact recipe I used last night except I added a potato and a little cabbage shredded finely (just because it was in my veggie keeper) and switched to veggie stock.  I also did not see this recipe or would have tried the vinegar.  I reviewed this recipe because I will just make this next time.  It is an excellent lentil soup recipe.  I will also add some turkey or chicken sausage next time for the meat eaters in the family.  My daughter, who is a vegetarian, absolutely loved this soup.

Absolutely delicious! I followed some of the other suggestions (less olive oil, balsamic vinegar) and it turned out wonderfully. This is definitely a keeper!

wonderful! I was very happy with the flavor and the whole family loved it. I added artichoke-mozzarella chicken sausages from our local Sam's Club and that completed the meal. This one is a keeper. Used red wine vinegar since the recipe did not specify.

This soup was very good but we felt it needed a little more flavor.  It was on the bland side.  After reading some of the reviews I will try chicken broth instead of water.  On the good side it was very hearty, healthy and nutritious and loaded with fiber.

My family loved this hearty, thick soup! Due to what I had on hand, I used 8 C. veg broth in place of water, 15 oz. can diced tomatoes instead of crushed, 1 TB balsamic vinegar, and no spinach. It was wonderful, flavorful, filling, and low-fat! A keeper for sure!

Absolutely scrumptious!! Prep for me took awhile chopping all the veggies up, but it was soo worth it! Instead of water, I used chicken broth and omitted adding any salt. I also added balsamic vinegar as others suggested, but I found that the base flavor was good enough on its own so only put 1/2 a tablespoon.
Next time, I may even add some green beans and more broth as I do like it to be less thick.

I used vegetable stock instead of water, doubled the garlic and used balsamic vinegar.  I added a big extra handful of spinach.  My husband really wanted me to add some meat to it, so I took out a bit for myself and then browned some ground beef and threw it in with some cumin.  Both were absolutely delicious.  I'll make this one again and again!

So good! I kicked it up with red pepper flakes and ground ginger, and I subbed chicken broth for water, but left everything else the same. It was so easy and yielded quite a bit. To serve, I topped with shredded parmesan. Great hearty soup!

Very good recipe.  It was however, much better the next day.  I used no-chicken stock (vegetarian) instead of chicken stock or water.  The vinegar is very important in this recipe.  Be sure to add a little extra as well as some extra salt and garlic, to make up for the lack of chicken stock.  This recipe with some tweaking, will be a staple for me.

This was great.  I loved it and my husband loved it.  I've tried other recipes that called for pototes and they were just too heavy - this was great. Oh and I have to add my husband wanted meat with his so I baked some sausages seperately and cut them up and put them in his bowl.

This was very, very good.  It made a TON of food, for very little cost.  It's filling, healthy and everyone in my family from baby to hubby loved it.  I made a few substitutions:

I had no carrots, so I used 1/2 cup of frozen peas and carrots.
I used heated frozen spinach.
I used balsamic vinegar.
I used a sprinkling of celery salt in lieu of celery.

YUM!! I made this soup and fell in love! I just HAD to make it for a yearly soup exchange (50 servings!).  I also subsituted the water for chicken broth for more flavor.  I also add a little more garlic.  DELISH!  Thanks for sharing!

This soup is very mediocre. It tastes healthy, but it is really lacking. I used half vegetable broth and half water. I would definitely recommend all broth. I had even doubled the veggies. I think it needs a lot more spices. I will be looking for another recipe to try. This was not the one for me.

Hmmm, this wasn't fabulous.  Tasted like a variation on split pea soup to me.  Pretty easy to make, though, and healthy.  I did add lemon juice instead of vinegar, because the lentil soup I've had and loved in restaurants had a hint of lemon and I thought maybe that is what the poster was going for with the vinegar.

This was fine and made for a quick lunch during the week, but I didn't think it was great. It was pretty easy to make, but seemed to be lacking something. I wasn't crazy about the vinegar flavor in soup (even though I like vinegar in other things). It was fun to try but I probably won't make again.

Best lentil soup I've made. Everyone in the family loved it. Forgot to add celery, still was great. Doubled the garlic and used balsamic vinegar instead. Increased the spinach. Very easy recipe to follow and a great result at the end. I found it was too salty - but that can be adjusted.

My family and I love this soup.  I make it several times a month.  It is super tasty and super healthy.  I add a few more things to it though.  I always add green pepper, chopped butternut squash, quartered new potatoes and sometimes turkey kielbasa.  Mostly I leave it veggie, I found that the kielbasa makes it a lot more greasy and prefer it more healthy.  I have also used Organic French Green Lentils and it is wonderful. Highly recommended. My husband loves it!

This is awesome.  I replaced some water with broth.  Also, don't skimp on the cooking time; the difference between 45 min. and an hour is really noticable in the texture.

A great soup!  I added some barley and vegetable bouillon.  I also added some plain yogurt to the final dish (sour cream can also be used).  Delicious!

Really yummy, and my little kids liked it, too. I used beef broth, tomato paste, and frozen spinach, as other users suggested. I used fresh basil and oregano, and I forgot the vinegar. I will add that before we eat the leftovers!

I reviewed this 2 years ago, and I need to update my comments... This is my 4-year old's favorite meal; he asks for it constantly. Even over the summer when it was 95 degrees, he asked me to make it. Finally the weather is cooler, and so we are having it tonight. He is soooo happy! Now, I am upgrading it from 4 to 5.

Have to give this 5 stars now. Everyone who's tasted it loves it. I've doubled the recipe & iso of 4 cups of lentils use 3 & 1 cup of brown rice & more veggies.

Marie, thanks so much for posting this awesome recipe.  We had it for dinner.  I changed a few things tho = I used a little less olive oil, 4 carrots and 4 stalks of celery instead of 2. I used frozen chopped onions because my hands break out if I touch fresh onion. I didn't have a 14.5 can of crushed tomatoes so I used a 14.5 can of whole tomatoes and crushed them myself.  Also, in place of the water I used 4 14.5 cans of low sodium chicken broth.  I used 1/2 cup of escarole instead of the spinach. I didn't have regular vinegar so I used balsamic.  It was the best lentil soup I have ever tasted/made.  Thanks again for sharing this with us.

Hearty and thick.  A tiny bit bland, but very filling and satisfying.  Will definitely make again and experiment with spices.

My family loved it! It's especially good with a crusty bread. I used fresh herbs instead of dried because I had them, and added a little rosemary. I'm currently making a second batch and plan to add in some turkey kielbasa.

excellent! used 6 cups of veggie stock instead of 8 cups of water to make it more of a stew, and tossed in some curry and ground cloves to taste. easy, healthy and delicious.

This soup is awesome!!! My boyfriend is a vegetarian and he absolutely loved it--I didn't even know I liked lentils.... I made a few changes though: I used 2 cans of vegetable broth and 4 cups of water instead of 8 cups of water. I also used a package of Italian style frozen vegetables and half a can of chopped spinach instead of fresh, and it still tasted fabulous and very flavorful. Will be making this one again.

I really liked this recipe. I had a left over ham bone that I used to give it more flavor,I also added a  little ham too. I didn't use the tomatoes, spinach or the vinegar, and instead of water I used chicken broth. Everyone loved this recipe. I will be making this again. Thanks Marie

Great recipe! I added more spices, whole garlic and vinegar. Blended portions and mixed back in to pot. Very tasty - my vegetarian relatives loved it. For those of you not used to cooking vegetarian, it does take getting used to. I kept wanting to add a ham bone or bacon to the recipe but held myself back so the veggies would have something to eat at dinner.

This was great, it thickened up like a hearty stew which hit the spot on our first cold Autumn night.  I added two yukon gold potatoes as another reviewer suggested and served it over brown rice for a healthy, hearty meal that my hubby really enjoyed!

This is a very good soup. I added 2 diced bell peppers, which was yummy. I also cut down the oil to about 2 Tbls. + about 2 Tbls. bacon grease. (I just happened to have some left over from lunch.) I didn't put spinach or vinegar in, but I'm sure it would be good that way. I sprinkled the top with some grated parmesan cheese after it was served. It was very good. My husband and I both had 3 bowls for dinner!

I also added 3 peeled red potatoes and the additional seasoning recommended by another reviewer and added 2 fresh chopped tomatoes instead of the canned and 1/3 cup barley.  
It was a big hit!  My husband and the kids really liked it.  This is going into my permanent recipe box for sure!

Loved this soup!.  I added a half teaspoon of smoked paprika.
Also some beef broth for part of the water, and left out the salt.

Have made it twice so far.  It will be my standard lentil recipe.

Nice texture in this soup. I took the advice of another reviewer and used a 28 ounce  can of tomatoes; I used San Marzano from Italy for maximum flavour. I reduced the amount of water as per the other reviewer, but ended up needing to add more in! I also doubled the carrots. Could use peas instead of spinach and then don’t have to worry about discolouration on the re-heat.

Everyone in my family will eat this meal, which is shocking considering how many vegetables it has. I make it in the Instant Pot with 25 minutes under high pressure. Here are some additions/swaps I make. I add a pound of Kiolbassa mesquite beef sausage (our favorite sausage!), I sub a quart of chicken broth for 4 of the cups of water, and I use chana dal for the lentils. I usually use a larger can of crushed tomatoes too, and it still works. I love this meal, and I feel great about how healthy it is for my family.

I have never made lentil soup before but wanted to branch out.  This recipe sounded great and quite straightforward which it turned out to be.  My wife loved it, my adult daughter and her boyfriend (who is more of a vegetarian) both loved it and, by the way, so did I!  I followed the recipe without changing anything.  Next time I may add some sausage (I’m not a vegetarian) and a little more spinach.  There is arecip

Lovely soup. Based on others’ suggestions, I decreased the amount of oil used to saute the vegees, increased the garlic, substituted chicken broth for water, and used balsamic vinegar. Also, I’m grateful to Heddy66 for mentioning that the spinach seemed a little mushy in her leftover soup. Because of that, I slice up my spinach (more than the recipe calls for) and just stir it into each individual serving bowl at serving time. That way, it wilts nicely with the heat of the soup but doesn’t lose its taste or texture.

This was my first time ever making lentil soup and with the help of this recipe it came out pretty good I think. It took a lot longer though to cook, like, 3 hours. I do use dry lentils. 
Good recipe!

I made this exactly as written and ended up with a big pot of tasteless mush. I used the orange colored lentils which must be a faster cooking variety, but the recipe didnt specify which color to use and Ive never made lentils so this was very disappointing. People submitting  these recipes need to be more specific when writing out the ingredients.  This was a complete waste of my morning.  : (

This was really good! I did substitute eight cups of chicken bouillon for the water and didn't salt it later, and added more spinach since it's good for you and cooks down to nothing. Rave reviews from the family.

It was SO good. I'm new to veganism, and this was my first home-cooked vegan meal! I am a college kid, and therefore on budget, and this was an extremely budget-friendly, delicious meal! It made a HUGE amount of food too! The changes I made are that I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, and thyme instead of a bay leaf. It was delicious!

This exceeded my expectations.  I doubled the spice, added 1/2 tsp. Red pepper flakes, used chicken broth instead of water, and added diced potato and diced smoked sausage the last 30 minutes.  I Cooked it for 90 min.  The potato starch thickened it nicely.  No need to puree.  Highly recommended.

I've been making this recipe for years in my crock pot.  LOVE it so much!  I use a 1 lb bag of lentils and double the carrots, celery and garlic.  ALWAYS use some kind of broth - chicken or vegetable.  I just dump everything in and start it.  I skip the olive oil in the beginning because my ALL TIME FAVORITE ADDITION is a very small drizzle of truffle oil in my bowl when I'm serving.  Holy smokes!  I'm going to have to make a batch now.  With crusty bread... Also, I think smoked paprika gives it almost a hammy flavor, which I love.

It was too watery and little taste with 8 cups of water so we added some broth.  I would like to know what the serving size is.  I'm diabetic so the 48.2 grams of carbs is on the high end for me so I need to know if I'm eating 1/2 cup, 3/4 cup or 1 cup.

This soup was hearty and delicious.  I may have used a little more onion and garlic than the recipe called for.  I also added a packet of Sazon (without annatto) and I cooked a ham steak and cut it up in cubes.  I have to admit I was skeptical of adding the vinegar and almost skipped it but decided to go ahead and it really added to the flavor.  You do not taste the vinegar at all but it made a difference in the flavor.

I think what's really amazing about this recipe is how simple and streamlined it is. You can dial in whatever amount of customization you want without worrying too much about the fine details. I barely even followed the directions once I got going; I could basically sum up my process as:

- sautee some onions, celery, carrots, potatoes and garlic in oil for a few minutes, adding in generous amounts of oregano, basil, bay leaf, salt, pepper and other spices
- combine two boxes of vegetable broth and 2+ cups lentils (I used 75% brown, 25% red to thicken up the soup) in the pot; boil, then bring down to a simmer for an hour or so

It's so imprecise—you can use your intuition to amazing effect. And it's great with rice, bread, naan or even tortilla chips! The best compromise of health and flavor I've ever tasted in an easy meal.

Delicious. I used chicken stock and doubled veggies included. Also added a touch of red pepper flakes but would probably leave out next time. And used balsamic vinegar as others had suggested. Was really good.

Great soup! I cut back on the lentils a bit, but not sure I would have had to. I had lots of tomatoes from my garden so added extras of those. I did not have spinach, but had frozen my own swiss chard and that worked great!

A few minor changes:  doubled the carrots.  Small diced tomatoes instead of stewed and finely chopped kale instead of spinach.  Only because these are the ingredients I had on hand.
Fabulous, hearty, heart warming soup.. Will definitely make again.

The touch of vinegar at the end is so important. I made it in an Instapot on slow cook and when I checked it it wasn't quite done enough so I 
 switched to pressure cooker mode for 10 minutes and it was great.

My family loved it! I wish i had the stuff to make corn bread with it. WE used balsamic vinaigrette and it gave it such a nice kick. Added more veggies. More garlic and a tad bit more salt. And used vegetable broth instead of water. It was perfect. Also i only had tomato sauce. So we used that and had a spoon full of yellow rice at the bottom of each bowl.

This was delicious! I used one cup of green and one cup of red lentils as the recipe didn’t say which to use, but couldn’t tell the difference between them once they were cooked. The only change I made to the recipe was using cumin instead of basil (because I didn’t have any). I added the vinegar to my bowl and it actually made it better! I will definitely make this again.

My family enjoyed this. My hubby said he would be happy to put it into our “frequent rotation.” The kids wanted seconds. I have made lentil soup many times, but always end up adding chicken stock for flavor. I wanted to try this recipe and keep it vegetarian. I was AMAZED at how the vinegar added flavor. I used apple cider.

I used cilantro instead of spinach because I like the taste of fresh cilantro. I used green chilis from the garden because I didn’t want them to go bad. I used fresh tomatoes chopped in a chopper instead of canned because I had them so why not. Doubled up on the spices and garlic. Used 1 1/2 tablespoons of apple vinegar because I got scared of it. Used half split peas and half lentils. Turned out really well. Spicy and herbal because of the cilantro. I will definitely make it again.

This was terrible. I even followed people's suggestions to make it better (adding broth, extra tomato sauce, doubling the spices), but in the end my husband and I both couldn't even finish a bowl, and the kids only ate theirs with massive bribes. It's somewhere between completely bland and just straight tomato flavored. So bad!

No broth and only teaspoons of herbs did made me know it would be bland so I use a big pinch of home-blended spice mix that has basil plus the oregano, a couple nice pinces of S&P (before simmering), but less than a quarter cup of oil, and add a  nice glug of vinegar to each serving. Tastes great to my wife and I both times I've made it. I'll probably use a box of low sodium chicken broth next time just for comparison.

I sautéed the carrots, celery, and onion on the stove, added the seasoning and some portabella mushrooms, and then married everything in the crockpot over night. I woke up to an amazing soup that only needed a few finishing dashes of salt and pepper and spinach. I added mushrooms (cause I love them in just about everything) and peppercorns but other than that followed the recipe. This is a very hearty, tasty soup that I will certainly be making again.

I forgot the vinegar, but it was still delicious. I followed the recipe pretty much as written--except I didn't measure the spices/herbs and I forgot about the vinegar at the end. Oh, and I did add some Better than Bullion soup base with the water. 

My 11 mo and 2 year old gobbled it up. The 5 yo had to be bribed with a piece of Halloween candy, but he ate his whole bowl. Now that he has the candy, he says the soup was good. I think it's delicious and I'm adding it to my winter soup rotation!

Great basic recipe for simple lentil soup. Literally takes 10 min to prep. After first try I doubled everything except for the water and lentils. Recommended if you like a heartier, more flavorful like we do.

I'll def make again. Was looking for a lentil soup. Lentils have the most folate of any veg. I have a condition that I can't metabolize enough (vitamin b9) or folate/folic acid into its final form: methyl folate. It's common. Called mthfr gene mutation.  At least 20% of pop has it. 
  There's a medicine for it called L-methyl folate. 
   Since I'm not taking the Med yet. I was looking for a lentil soup bc lentils have the most folate of any vegetable. 
   When I eat them I feel better in mood and more energized. Try it  and see if that happens to you.

I added parnips and sweet potato's with the skin on.  The parsnips were a great addition but I would probably leave the sweet potato out next time.  It made the soup textural a  little mealy.  I used 4 cups low sodium vegetable broth and 4 cups water.  I would highly recommend this for added flavor.  I didn't add any other salt besides the broth but still used oregano, sage and even fennel.

Did 4 carrots and doubled the spices. Turned out pretty good, but not delicious. A nice healthy and cheap meal that makes a lot. Tastes great with cornbread. Would be even better with ritz crackers or something similar. Was not a fan of parmesan cheese in the soup though.

I thought it was bland but I live here in New Orleans where flavor is amazing. Definitely follow some of the tips to give this dish some flavor. However, it is a hearty dish and could be a great comfort food with some tweaking.

I've made this a few times and it always turns out amazing! I usually make a few substitutions: I use organic kale instead of spinach (stays heartier and crunchier throughout the duration of the soup), and if I'm craving I spicy version I add Trader Joe's spicy soy chorizo. Still a hearty vegan-friendly soup, but adds an amazing, flavorful kick!

It was very bland. Good basic recipe to get started but not flavorful enough. Had to add ingredients and it seems that several other people in the reviews are also adding ingredients.   I used low-sodium chicken broth and next time will use 2-4 cups regular chicken broth to see if that adds flavor. To add flavor, I had to add several seasonings I had on hand including sofrito, red pepper and alot of salt, and grated cheese - it was actually very tasty when I was done with it.

This was really good! The first time I made it, it seemed like it had too much lentils in it and I had to add broth to each individual bowl. The second time, I just used 1 1/2 cups of dry lentils. I also left out the onion both times and used chicken broth.

I always read the reviews  before trying a new recipe and am very glad I read the one about adding Balsamic Vinegar.  That made the soup very tasty. In fact I put in 3 Tablespoons of Balsamic and it was just right.  Also added an extra carrot and 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and just 6.5 cups of water.  Next time I will do four carrots and four garlic.  However, the soup was very good, and my picky son ate four bowls of it.

I thought this was okay as far as texture went, but I think the flavoring could use a little kick. Someone suggested red pepper flakes, maybe that would do the trick. But it's fine if your family prefers somewhat bland food. It's a good bit of work but nice after it cooks.

I used extra carrots with russet potatoes peel on and cubed with fresh whole garlic chopped fine.  I'll probably make it again.  Great recipe thanks Marie.  I didn't use the cornbread but still loved it.

Excellent recipe! First time making this very simple and quick recipe. I used coconut oil (preference), one can of tomato soup (didn't have tomatoes on hand), excluded the spinach and added 1 tsp red chili flakes at end.  This will definitely be one of my go-to recipes from here on out. So yummy!

I'm rating this as written, not with my changes. As written, I felt this was bland and lacked any flavor. I would not have considered it "hearty" and even with changes, I'm not blown away. I swapped out half the water with broth and a can of stewed tomatoes, and still feel it's pretty watery. With changes, I'd give it 4-4.5 stars. Here are my changes, if interested: Doubled all spices, added two extra carrots and about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, added an extra can of stewed tomatoes, used vegetarian "chicken broth" in place of 4 c. of the water, and added about 1/4 cup dry red wine. I also used about 2 tbs. lemon juice in place of the vinegar. Overall, a good base recipe, but needs a lot of adjustment.

I was a little worried that I couldn't make this since I didn't have crushed tomatoes, but decided to try it anyway. I substituted some cut up sun dried tomatoes instead and it worked fine! I also added some cumin and zucchini like some other reviews suggested. I topped it off with balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese. Delicious!

This soup was absolutely delicious! Like other reviewers, I did double the spices and garlic, plus added cumin. I threw in some smoked sausage during the last 30 minutes of cook time. THEN I did the thing that ruined it all for me - I added frozen spinach instead of fresh, because it was what I had on hand and other reviewers who had used frozen really enjoyed their soup. It was sooooo much better before I put that in!! Ick!! Next time I will be sure to use fresh or leave it out altogether!

Great recipe! Only changes I made were to use 4 cups chicken broth and 4 cups water instead of 8 cups water. And I added a smoked ham shank at the beginning of the boil. Very tasty!

It was good.m but could use more spice or kick even with me doubling the spices and adding cumin. I did do as some others and used lemon juice instead of vinegar and chicken broth for some of the water.

Easy to make and quite delicious. I made this soup for my father who had thyroid surgery and couldn’t swallow very well.  He raves about the flavor and vegetables. I did add a little bit of chicken and chayote which are his favorites. This recipe was wonderful and very easy for a quick and delicious dinner.

This soup was pretty darn good. I did make some changes, but since they weren't major, I figured it would've been great as is (so 5 stars). My changes: 1) used extra celery, carrot & garlic for chunkiness and extra flavor, 2) only 3/4 onion b/c that's what I had ready, 3) started with 5 cups of water and then added about 1 more cup during cooking process.. basically to my liking, 4) used Italian seasoning instead of basil & oregano b/c that's what I had [I eyeballed], 5) used one fresh Roma tomato b/c I had none canned, 6) added cumin and red pepper flakes - I like the rustic/earthy taste and kick of spice  - and culantro [a cultural herb], 7) halved the vinegar b/c I was scared of ruining it, lol, 8) and of course salt (both seasoned & plain) and pepper to taste. Seems like a lot, but it really wasn't. Just a few minor things due to scarcity of product and/or personal preference. Oh yeah, ALMOST FORGOT -- 2 more things: 1) I tasted the soup before adding the vinegar, and it tasted just fine without it. I didn't notice a difference. 2) Of the 6 or so cups of fluid, there was one can of chicken broth included in it. I just poured the broth in the measuring cup and then filled it up with water to the 4-cups line. Added 1 cup when I saw how low it was in the pot. And then added another cup after the first 30 mins.

I planned on making this for dinner one night but got caught up at work so my husband who is a novice cook made it!  followed the directions almost exactly ( I wasn't there).  It was fantastic!!  Definitely choose a good ground sausage because your broth will draw it's flavor from it!  We will definitely be making this again when it gets colder out! :-)   Thanks for sharing!

It was good but  like most people, double up or add more spices. Very bland without doing so.

I don't know if I'm reading this wrong, but how is there 350 calories per serving? 

Calories in 2 cups of lentils are 460.  1 can of tomatoes 105 calories. We all know water has no calories and the veggies might equal 60 call together.  Olive oil 480 calories.
 All together maybe...1110.  Divide that with 6 servings and you get  185 calories per serving..
This is if you don't add anything.
What am I reading wrong.

Recipe needs a lot of altering. If you don't season like crazzy you are left with a bland soup.

Tad bit disappointed, soup was just okay.
I did make some changes based on other reviews.. I used stewed tomatoes instead of crushed, added 3 potatoes, cilli powder, cumin & one chicken cube (Still soup lacked flavor). I put everything in the slow cooker on low for 8 hrs. Last 10 mins I added the spinach. Maybe it will taste better next day when flavors mend together.  Soup is very filling!

Delicious and SO easy to make with the ingredients being cheap to buy. I will definitely be making this again.
Next time I will be more experimental and throw more veggies in!

Makes A TON!!!  Doubled the herb/spices.  Added 1 teaspoon salt.  Only simmered 30 minutes and lentils were soft.  Used broth instead of water.  Good but not excellent.

I'm happy with this recipe and soup.  I did adjust the recipe according to other reviews: 3 carrots, 2.5 celery, thyme instead of oregano, lemon juice instead of vinegar.  My daughter is against tomatoes, so for her, I omitted the tomatoes.  Lastly, I used veg broth instead of water.  

I would make this recipe again.  I love the smell in the home while it's cooking.

I read the reviews, and took the advice of another chief. I doubled all the spices and carrots. I even used frozen spinach instead of fresh and added it in with about 15 minutes left of the simmering.
I add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes when serving. 
Delicious!

I substituted chicken broth for half of the water, added a diced pepper ( I've made with yellow and red on separate occasions). But I think the biggest impact was adding generous amounts of cumin to taste.  Finally, I let it boil uncovered for a bit before lowering to simmer so it's not as... soupy.  Yummy and a big hit with my family and friends. I've served with crusty bread, alone and over rice.

I made this based on reviewer Blankin's modifications (but I used the vinegar instead of lemon juice and didn't use he pepper flakes or port). It was delicious! Don't skip the I hear at the end, it adds a nice kick. I've been looking for good vegan recipes and this is a winner! I will definitely make it again.

Super good!!  I used 1 carton of chicken broth and 4 cups of water.  I used balsamic vinegar and 1 can of petite diced tomatoes.  After I ladled my soup into my bowl, I grabbed a handful of 50/50 salad greens and placed them on top and stirred them in.  Perfection!

I highly modified this recipe to make it edible. When I'd gotten to a half hour cook time, I tasted it and it lacked any and all flavour, and that was after adding veggie stock cubes!

So, I made some changes. I threw in more basil, then added about 2 tsp cumin, half a teaspoon cinnamon, and a teaspoon ground coriander. I let it cook for another half an hour and added in spinach, again using more than was called for. I totally left out the vinegar. It was lovely, and I highly enjoyed it, but definitely wouldn't have if I'd gone with the recipe as written.

Since I'm vegetarian and didn't have any vegetable broth with me, I had to stick with the original recipe I almost had to triple up the amount of spices. I did add a tiny bit of curry and a lot of red chili flakes to kick up the flavor a little bit. It was very easy and ended up tasting great!

I took users suggestions and used half vegetable stock and half water. I also used canned lentils and just added them to the soup later so they wouldn't become to soft because that was all I had on hand.  Frozen spinach works fine in this recipe as well. Turned out really good! Planning to freeze the left overs :)

I made this once and really liked it. This time it turned out terrible. Not sure what went wrong, but my lentils turned to mush and I didn't even simmer for the whole hour. Too much to throw away, guess I'll have to eat it somehow but wish I knew what the heck happened...

Very disappointed with this soup. Something is off about the spices. I think oregano and basil are the wrong spices for lentil soup. Plus there are too many tomatoes. I don't get what people are raving about.

I made this soup yesterday afternoon. It is a tradition in Italy in the province where my family is from to eat lentils on New Year’s Day to ensure wealth and prosperity all year long.  Slight modifications:  I used 3 medium carrots diced (about 1 heavy cup), 3 hearts of celery stalks diced (about ½ cup) and 2 cloves of garlic minced.  I also used vegetable broth (2 cartons) instead of the water.  This really deepens the flavor.  It is important to sauté the vegetables in the olive oil to soften and add richness to the soup; also, adding in the spices and continuing to sauté is a must.  You do not need to double the spices.   While it is tempting to put all the ingredients in the pot at once, don’t – the layering process improves the flavors quite a bit adding a depth and richness that you don’t get otherwise.  Sometimes we add macaroni at the end (ditalini, small shells or spaghetti broken into 1” pieces).  Cook the pasta separately according to package directions and add with a bit of the cooking water to the pot as needed so the soup is as thick or thin as you want. Enjoy! and have a prosperous New Year!

I loved that my family loved it...all of them.... believe me that's hard to do. Did make a few changes, added leeks and the core section of broccoli stems so as not to waste them and added some left over ham cubed just before serving. I did cook the lentils longer than suggested so it was a thick creamy flavourful soup. Great recipe!

A great family staple!  Good with or without vinegar at the end.  I alternate.  Occasionally I add various types of sausage to the dish.  Sometimes spicy, sometimes just savory.  I think the biggest issue with comments about lack of taste is the amount of salt and pepper you add.  The lentils really absorb salt so you need to add accordingly.  I can also advise using several dashes of Maggi.  Maggi seasonings (either liquid or powders) add an entire level of flavor to all dishes! You can add this at any time too.

Easy and quick!! If you want make it healthy(the world's should stop adding sodium to their foods) make it as it says.  High sodium retains fluids so if you wake up a few pounds heavier it's probably because you had a high sodium dinner and didn't drink 1liter between after dinner and waking up the next day.(  I keep a Fiji water next to me everywhere I go around the house and drink if I wake up from my sleep.  This helps me wake up.  Anyways back to the recipe, I Switched  out the can tomatoes for fresh tomatoes. I topped baked plantain chunks and it gives it a great sweet salty taste! Or try roasting sweet potato chunks and topping the soup off.  The semi sweet taste keeps your guest guessing where all these well combined flavors come from!!!

Using just water it is totally flavorless.  I made it two other times, once with chicken stock and the next time with stock I made with a ham bone.  Much much better. Not sure how anyone can eat this just using water, it's terrible.

My mom was going to be coming home late from work, It was my first meal completely on my own so I chose lentil soup, because it was easy and fast to whip up, and one of my mom's favorite soups. I was nervous because my grandma makes the best soups EVER :) and I thought my mom would be disappointed because I knew I had to screw at least three things up. I doctored it up a little bit, with some spices from the cupboard -- don't ask me which ones, I couldn't remember for my life --  and my family loved it, mom said it was just as good as Grammy's. Yay!! Definitely making this again!

I absolutely love this recipe! I keep the original vegetable ingredients the same, but add 2 small to medium cubed russet potatoes, as well as cubed ham steak, roughly 1 - 1 1/2 cups. I omit the spinach at the end because I typically do not have it on hand as readily as the other ingredients.  This is a tried and true recipe for me, and it freezes well for later use.

How to make this soup better: 1.) Replace water with broth. 2.) double the amount of spices, carrots, and garlic.
3.) add a teaspoon of curry powder and a little over a teaspoon of cumin. 3.) add a pinch of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes.

I left out the vinegar because I tried it with the soup in a separate bowl and wasn't too thrilled by it.

The original recipe sounds awful but with modifications it turned out great!

Fabulous, fabulous recipe. Absolutely delicious. I took several suggestions from previous users: used a lot more of the spices, used ½ chicken broth and ½ water, both red and brown lentils, added in three potatoes in the last 30 minutes of cooking, added several cups of spinach at the end, used balsamic vinegar. I actually kind of liked the stock better without the vinegar so I had to add some garlic salt to balance out the flavor. But overall it's excellent. I think it's great this recipe lends itself easily to so many variations depending on your tastes. Absolutely will make again.

The reviewers were right.  If you double the spices, use vegetable broth and balsamic vinegar, it is very good.  I also added a little spicy Italian sausage, and we thought it tasted similar to Carrabba's wonderful Lentil Sausage Soup.  Only 4 stars because it needed more seasoning.

Very good!  I used 4 cups chicken broth and 4 cups water.  I did not have basil or oregano on hand, so I used 2 tsp of Italian seasonings instead.  Also added 1 tsp more of garlic ( I used bottled crushed garlic) Definitely make again!

With the additional comments by Blankin & others, this was wonderful soup!!! I added extra carrots, doubled the spices, added some red pepper flakes, a couple shakes. Added some meat I had in the freezer & used home-made chicken stock, but not the extra crushed tomato. I used a dry soup mix of lentils, rice and barley that I had in the house and don't remember if I added any vinegar at the end. I blended about 1/2 of it.  I LOVED it! My hubby thought it a little spicy (Mr. Bland), my older kids would've preferred it without the spinach, but my 20-month old gobbled it up and asked for more, more, more!

I used 6C. chicken broth, not water, and i added sweet Italian sausage to give it more body.  The sausage also added greatly to the flavor.  I had a package of Trader Joes cooked lentils so used them instead of dry.  Just added them a bit later.  Be careful not to over salt!

This was a filling and yummy soup. I added cilantro and potato cubes about halfway through the cooking along with the spinach. Both times I made it I halved the recipe but kept the spices at the amount as if I was making the full recipe - that's worked out perfect. I also add some red pepper flakes for added flavor.

I doubled all the spices and I still was not a fan . I used four cups water & four cups vegetable broth and it became way too thick to be considered a soup. It could be that I may not like lentils.

Enjoyed it.  Will make again.  Added some chicken base and baby kale, but otherwise followed.  Would probably be good not matter what you wish to add.  Never heard of adding vinegar before.  Used balsamic as suggested.  Nice touch.

This is a great lentil soup.  I add homemade chicken broth for more flavor and I just add the amount of ingredients in the recipe to my liking (which for me is more spinach and more seasonings).

Just made this for dinner and really enjoyed it.  I added 1tsp of Lemmon juice since I am allergic to vinegar and it worked well as a substitute!

Great recipe. I omitted salt and used 5 tsp. chicken bullion to give it more flavor. Also added extra pepper and used Apple cider vinegar. Instead of spinach I used "super greens" from Safeway which included baby spinach, kale, and chard. Delicious!

I agree with many of the reviewers - double the spices, veggies and even the tomatoes, add a pinch of red pepper flakes and use balsamic vinegar.  I used half red lentils and half green lentils and pureed some of the soup when it was done to make it thicker.  Add the spinach as you eat it so you don't get slimy leftovers!    Still giving it 5 stars, because it's very good as written - just better with a little modification.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: At first I wasn't sure if I liked this soup.  I occasionally eat fish, but no other meat, and this has a very "meaty" taste!  However, after a few bites I was hooked.  This soup is really good as written, but excellent when following the suggestions of other reviewers.  I use "not so chick'n" bouillon cubes to make 8 cups of broth rather than using water.  Very forgiving and easy to modify. This is one of the best recipes I've tried in a long time. Even meat eaters will like it!

Awesome!!
I added 1lb Italian sausage and a little orzo because I was short on lentils. I also used 4 cups veg broth and 4 cups water. I had to add a little more later because it got too thick.

Outstanding!  I made a few changes that another review (JPMARYLAND) suggested and this made all the difference. Low sodioum chicken broth instead of water for the 8 cups, plus I added another 2 cups of water.  4 carrots, 4 stalks of celery chopped up, 4 cloves garlic, 2 bay leaf, 2 tsp. basil, 4 cups thin sliced baby spinach.  Double the oregano if you like oregano, I stayed with the 1 tsp. I used Balsamic vinegar and added 3 tabelspoons, this gave it a really nice flavor.  I also added two medium size russet potatoes cut up in cubes.  Add the cut up potato the last 30 mins.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  This was a hearty meal.  You can add a ham bone or cut up hamsteak too if you like meat in your soup.

Really excellent as written. I have made this many times. I do now however add spicy Italian sausage for my husband and also substitute kale for spinach once in awhile. I also rinse and soak the lentils so they cook quicker.

I have never had lentils before and I really loved this soup.  It is very flavorful and filling.  I've learned that lentils are a great source of protein which is an added bonus.  I made the recipe as is, but I did simmer for 1.5 hours instead of just an hour.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Use Basalmic vinegar instead of white vinegar.  Use veggie broth instead of water.  Add a few shakes of hot sauce.  Great!

I made this according to the recipe exactly. I  use broth vs water. My family thought it was good. No one had seconds or anything but both kids cleaned their bowls and agreed it was tasty. It's a very nourishing dish so perhaps these folks who say it's inedible are used to more commercial flavors. We joke that we are kale and quinoa people even tho we eat meat and dairy. So there is no accounting for preferences. Give it a try as written and you can always Dr it up later. It's a very inexpensive dish to make so what have you got to lose. I used my dutch oven with a lid while cooking and needed no water added. 4 of us ate and we had 4 or 5 cups left over. I froze it for a Sunday lunch.

I used butter instead of olive oil,  chicken broth instead of water, and kale instead of spinach. I also used fresh herbs instead of dried (triple the amount of herbs called for when using fresh instead of dried). It was delicious! If broth is not used, I would add at least a teaspoon of salt with the water. Otherwise it will be incredibly bland. I still needed additional salt to taste at the end using chicken broth. With my changes, I will make again!

Added barley in place of lentils, because I was thinking barley when I read lentils. Go figure. : /  Used some chicken broth I had in the freezer, along with 2 cans of beef broth. Added chicken bouillion, and just a little red pepper flakes, fennel, saffron, and sage. If you're out of lentils, give barley a try. It was mooey delicioso!

The star rating of 3 is based on the recipe as-is. I followed it quite closely, just using a larger can of crushed tomatoes than it calls for and a touch less water. As-is, I felt it was bland. I added curry and cumin to taste, and a teaspoon of beef bouillon. Also I used an immersion blender for just a few seconds to create a thicker texture. I thought this relatively small change made the dish much more flavorful and a little spicy... like a good, hearty vegetarian chili. I have been taking it to work and adding a little water to each serving before heating it up as the lentils really soak up the liquid. A coworker had a helping and commented more than once it was delicious so I think I will keep the recipe with these modifications, which I felt bumped the rating up to an "I Loved It".

Terrific with changes that others suggested.  Double the spices, use 4 cups broth, 4 cups water.  I added a little sherry early on, balsamic vinegar and spinach towards the end.  I used a large can of blended tomatoes instead of the 15 oz can.  Also, I cut up some smoked turkey sausage early on, which added nice flavor.  Will definitely make again!  Delicious!  And healthy!

This recipe was very delicious.  The soup required a bit more seasoning than the recipe calls for, but otherwise it was good.  I added a bit of garlic powder, and onion powder as well as a bit more salt and pepper both.  The recipe makes more servings than it says too, but we didn't mind the leftovers at all.  Add a bit of extra water and re-heat, it's easy and tasty!

I followed the recipe and it turned out absolutely tasteless.  I added some beef broth and more vinegar so it would have some flavor.  I was really trying to go vegetarian.  I think it would be a good base with some ham.

I suppose for a lentil soup, it might be 4 or 5 star but really it doesn't seem like anything special even with additions suggested by others such as more carrots,  potatoes, more tomatoes, etc. Could be lentil soups just don't get any better than this. If so, I'll look for another use for the lentils. I revised my opinion after letting it meld for a day and adding some Better Than Chicken Bouillon. Made all the difference and it was delicious. The broth is key.  Of course, I reduced the oil to 1 tsp. (forgot the vinegar-maybe next time)

Excellent soup. Like an earlier review, I doubled the spice and carrots.  Also added more celery. Hearty and comforting for winter nights.

OMG!!!! All I can say is this is so delicious and hearty! I really like lentil soup but sadly all I have ever tried was canned lentil soup. So sad I never made homemade lentil soup as it doesn't even compare to or come close to homemade. At first I was hesitant about the vinegar but I can see that this really helps bring all the flavor together. I used balsamic vinegar and it was so good! Even my picky 3 year old liked it! I will be keeping this recipe and telling my friends and family about it! Mmmmm mmm!

This is my second attempt at a lentil soup recipe that had a high rating. Maybe I'm just not that into it, but this soup tasted like someone just put vegetables in water. It smelled great, but had no flavor. I tried extra vinegar as suggested, but it didn't help enough to give this a good rating.

Very good. I used chicken broth instead of water & 2 more carrots just because we love carrots. Topped it with fresh grated parmesan cheese. Yum!

This soup was awesome.  I used 4 carrots and added chicken bullion for more flavor.  Omitted the spinach just because I thought it tasted better without.  This was a very good and easy soup to make and we enjoyed it, even though it was 100 degrees outside!  Tasted even better the next day with some left over rice added in.  Thanks, I'll be making this often.

This is hearty and flavorful. It doesn't scream "lentil soup". (Not that there's anything wrong with that!). I used 11/2 Knorr concentrated beef stock in the little tubs in 8 cups of water, doubled the herbs and garlic, used 2 cups baby spinach and tossed in a smoked Parmesan rind for delicious depth. I used very little vinegar. I will make this again and again!

Might as well add my glowing review to the pile!  Like others, I have made some tweaks to suit our taste.  We use green lentils and soak them for 10 minutes or so in boiling water before adding them to the veggies.  I use all low-sodium broth, either chicken or veggie depending on what I have on hand.  I skip the canned tomatoes and just use a tbsp of tomato paste, it's a texture thing for me.  I use just enough oil to cook the veggies, not 1/4 cup. Finally, we use balsamic vinegar at the end and serve with parmesan bread.
Thanks for a fantastic recipe that's very versatile!

This soup is OK with modifications.  I took many other peoples suggestions and added more veggies and used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  I also used vegetable broth instead of water.  I still found this to be just ok.

I made this (doubled) on the stove top once before with some adjustments but never made a note of what I did. It was great. But, today I wanted to make it with a lazy approach in the crock pot. I pretty much doubled the recipe Into two  crockpots (6 quarts each) . To estimate per crockpot I used 1 16oz bag of dried lentils, I large onion, 4 cloves of garlic, 6 stalks of celery and 2 large carrots, 2 teaspoons oregano and basil, 1 teaspoon cumin, curry, and crushed red pepper, 2 bay leafs, 2 cans of crushed/diced/stewed/or the equivalent of fresh tomatoes (depends on how you like your tomatoes, you can't go wrong), some ground black pepper. Then I used all low sodium chicken broth to fill up the crock pot about an inch above everything else (the lentils will get some water from the vegetables while their cooking), but you can add more. I cooked on high for 6-7 hours and then puréed a little with my hand mixer afterwards. Added 2 tablespoons balsamic and presto!  This recipe really opened me up to lentil soup, it is awesome!

I added potatoes at 30 minutes and spinach at the end and needed 2 cups more liquid.  Used mostly chicken stock.  Felt like I was a eating a bowl full of healthy but wanted a little more taste.  My kids liked it though.  It was good.

This soup is delicious! I added mild Italian sausage to mine cause I am a carnivore. I eyeballed everything except the lentils and chicken broth. In my opinion, 2 cups of lentils was way to much. I will only use one cup next time.

Made changes due to what I had on hand...used shallots instead of onion, used homemade turkey stock rather than water, and used a blend of kale, chard, and spinach finely chopped so my picky daughter would eat it.

It was the best lentil soup I've ever made.  Try it.  You'll love it.  Thanks for the recipe, Marie!

Delicious!!  We made a few changes: use white balsamic vinegar instead of regular vinegar; use 4 carrots instead of 2; use 4 cups veggie broth and 4 cups water.  I especially think the white balsamic gave the soup a really nice flavor.

Amazing recipe. Also added some hot chicken sausage (removed the casing first and sauteed the ground meat before adding it to the soup). The soup was delicious. One of the best soups I've had in recent memory.

How anyone can say this soup doesn't have flavor is beyond me.    Mine will be done in 30 minutes and already tastes awesome!        I added a hambone I had left over from Thanksgiving.     Thats the only change I made.     Great recipe!      Thanks for sharing!

Very good and healthy too!  Changes made were very small: 

Tomato Sauce rather than crushed tomatoes
1 cup small golden lentils rather than 2 cups
lemon juice rather than vinegar 
extra spinach 
plus cayenne pepper to taste for a kick.

It was wonderful and addictive w/ warm french bread yummy thank you :)

Good. Went with only a couple changes. A veg broth cube added as well as a tsp of cumin and half the vinegar which was balsamic. Oh and double the garlic. Two tsp of salt seemed like a lot but tasted perfect.

This was absolutely delicious, and not at all hard to make. I didn't use any water, but instead used vegetable broth and a large can of diced tomatoes. I slivered the spinach because my husband says he doesn't like cooked spinach, and that worked well to combat the sometimes slimy character of spinach in soup. I used brown lentils because those were the first ones I found when I looked in the pantry, and I liked their firm character.  I used red wine vinegar in the finish and this added a lovely tang without tasting acidy. Thanks so much.

I altered by using all chicken broth and adding a bay leave along with extra oregano and basil. The Organic TruRoots Sprouted Green Lentils take about 1/2 hour to cook so I simmered the delicious dish a total of 2 hours. YUMMY

The soup was really good and hearty but I made a few adjustments. I added 4 cloves of garlic and used vegetable stock. I also used balsamic vinegar and added potato. Although it was delicious I found that after the suggested hour we ate dinner but I let it simmer a while longer, about 30 min, and in that time the liquid was gone!

Really good soup! I read several reviews and as such made some changes. I used no salt added vegetable broth in place of water, doubled carrots, celery, garlic and spinach. I added a tsp of cumin, and a dash of chicken base, also added a pinch of red pepper flakes and decreased the oil to 1 tbsp. it seemed too thick at the end of cooking so I added some more water. It was delicious!

This was good, but I thought it needed a little something more.  So I doubled the oregano and basil, and added about a tablespoon of creole seasoning and a little red pepper.

Love it! As suggested, I added 2 extra carrots and more spices. I also tossed in an extra celery stick, a couple dashes of cayenne pepper and about a teaspoon of chilli powder. I wound up using 2/3 cup green lentils because that was all I had the remaining 1 1/3 cups red lentils. It came delicious and I actually prefer the texture of the red lentils to the green. The chilli/cayenne pepper definitely gives it a subtle kick, but is still far from being spicy. I'd never made soup before and although it's not difficult, I'm quite proud that I was able to pull off such a delicious concoction!

Delicious soup!  The one substitution that I highly recommend, if you do nothing else, is to use kale instead of spinach.  It holds up much better, so you can throw it in at the beginning of the cooking cycle and reheat leftovers without it falling apart like spinach.  Like others, I added spicy Italian sausage, used chicken broth instead of water, and added an extra can of diced tomatoes, which makes this recipe spicy and amazing.  I prefer tarragon over basil, so I made that substitution too, but that's just personal preference.

I loved this recipe! So easy and yummy. I took some advise and added cumin, curry and red pepper flakes. Some broth to substitute water and I didn't have spinach on hand so I used kale. I also added balsamic to each bowl at serving. Wonderful!! Thank you for the recipe.

I loved this receipe!! I used fresh and organic products and it was the best lentil soup i have ever had, will never buy lentil soup from a can ever again. Really took my time finely chopping the onions, carrots and celery but used the 20 minutes of chop time to let the lentils sit in hot water since i like my lentils well cooked and soft. The veggies add a nice crunch, i let them simmer w the spices for 5-7 minutes so they would absorb the wonderful flavors! Otherwise followed the recipe to the word and the result was phenomenal! Highly recommend if you have time to whip up this soup!

Hearty and healthy tasting but a bit "unfinished" to my tastebuds.  I added 1 tsp of both ground Cumin and Garam Masala.  That helped a little.  I then added about 2 Tbsp of Curry powder.  Yum!

Excellent! I made this recipe tonight and WOW it is terrific. Of course, I did do a couple of tweaks of my own. I used the best canned tomatoes in the world...one 28 oz can of San Marzano brand whole tomatoes (chopped them up in the can and poured the whole thing into the pot) AND instead of the water the recipe calls for, I replaced it with Swanson's organic chicken broth (reduced sodium). I served it with warm French bread with an extra crispy thick crust and butter (yes, butter). Deeeee-lish!

my first attempt at making lentil soup, a sucess! very close to my italian mothers recipie- i think it just needs a little parm! i omitted the spiniach because we dont like the cooked texture of it, increased the garlic to 6 tsp as a preferance, only a couple tsp of olive oil will do and also added a little cumin and red pepper flakes for a kick! i did 5 cups water and 3 cups chicken/vegetable bullion stock. Still simmering so not sure how the balsamic vinager will do, but this recipe is deffinatly a keeper.

Like everyone else I modified slightly. We used 2tbl of olive oil. 5 cloves of garlic and two teaspoons of the basil and oregano. We also substitued two 16 oz cans of fire roasted tomatoes tex mex style for the stewed tomatoes (this adds tons of flavor to the broth). And doubled the spinach as well.
We loved it.

Yum!  This will warm you up this time of year...extra points for being a healthy dish!  As written the recipe is a touch bland, hence 4 stars, but once I subbed the water for low-sodium vegetable broth and used fresh herbs and tomatoes, I was a happy camper! Thanks for sharing your recipe Marie!

My husband made this for me last night, and it turned out great! He used diced tomatoes and kale instead of crushed toms and spinach, and I know he used slightly different seasoning (we don't have bay leaf). It was perfect, and a nice surprise after a long day :-) He said it was really easy to make too. Glad to have a good lentil soup recipe.

This is a great base recipe. It gave me the proper amount of water to lentils and a clear idea of seasonings and quantities needed. That being said, this is definitely a recipe you need to modify. 

Add seasoning or stock (I used beef) as needed once you have the basic stew going and you'll have a winner. Mine included bits of chopped smoked bacon, extra garlic and shallots instead of regular onions. I added Worcestershire sauce and extra spices as well. 

4 stars because it's exactly what I was looking for, but not quite perfect in itself.

We loved this recipe (family of 5). I used balsamic vinegar instead (maybe s 1/8 C) and extra salt and pepper. Skipped the spinach only because I didn't have any. Added 2 diced potatoes like another reader suggested (along with carrots etc). Used 5-6 cloves of garlic just because I like it. I had the time so after doing the carrots, onion etc I tossed it in the crockpot with all the other ingredients. When I came home the house smelled amazing! Also - I pureed the whole batch and served with plain greek yogurt. Yum! A keeper for our family!

i made this recipe with BLANKIN's changes and this came out alright, not too over the top.. it made me think of having some kind of an italian pasta dish.. i topped it off with mozz and parm.. i simmered the lentils for well over 2 hours and they were barely starting to get tender.. without doubling all the spices and adding the red pepper i think the original recipe would have been pretty bland.. ty for the recipe and the suggestions

Very very good.  However I would skip the vinager next time I make.  I don't think it needs it.  I will for sure make again :)

SO GOOD!  I make huge batches of this in the crockpot and freeze small portions for lunch.  Still delicious, even after freezing.  I only make a few minor tweaks... I omit the oil, use an entire bag of lentils that I soaked overnight in the fridge in cold water (then drained before using), add 4 vegetable bouillon cubes with the water (start with only 4 cups), and I realized I've been using the large 28oz cans of tomato, I also use a bag of frozen spinach for convenience.  The seasoning is perfect though, don't mess with that (ok, maybe a little extra garlic), and ABSOLUTELY be sure to add apple cider vinegar on top when serving - THAT is what makes it outstanding.  A little parm also makes it extra yummy, but unnecessary.

This is good, but I recommend making with vegetable broth rather than water. With just water, it was very bland, even with the salt, so I added a few crushed veggie bouillon cubes afterwards and it was great.

This is wonderful!! I read some reviews and added extra garlic, cumin (love spicy), red pepper flakes. I wanted extra hardy for dinner so I put potatoes and corn in it too. I'm so excited about this recipe, you don't even know!!

Great recipe, but I took liberties with it and used the recipe as a base. Used a lot more carrots, onions, and spinach then called for. Also, served with tortilla chips and ricotta cheese. Delicious!

I love, love, love this recipe!  Whenever I make this for people they make me give them the recipe.  So healthy and so delicious.  The only changes I make to this are to increase the garlic to 1 tablespoon and I do not add any of the vinegar, spinach or salt/pepper.  It's great just with all of the natural flavors!  I'll continue to make this on a regular basis.

This also makes for awesome baby food if you puree it.  I gave it to my daughter when she was ready for Stage 3 foods and she would gobble it down!

This is a great base lentil soup recipe open for variation. Before adding the carrots, and celery sautee some chopped bacon (1/2" slices), but just cook till browned. Add rest of ingredients, I include fresh thyme and oregano instead of dried if possible. I also use stock instead of water for the liquid. 
I use a firm chopped kale for the greens. You can also add a couple cups of dry red wine for added flavor .

What a great recipe!  I too used 28oz of tomatoes, added more water and added 1/2 cup of pot barley.  It was wonderful and the hubby couldn't get enough.  Everyone loved it; thanks for sharing!

I really love this soup. The only changes I make is using 3 or 4 green onions, leaves and all instead of a whole white or yellow onion and  I use only one tablespoon of pomegranate balsamic vinegar.  Mmmm, so delicious! Thanks for sharing it!

Loved this soup!  I used more garlic, doubled the spices, 28 oz diced tomatoes, 1/2 veggie broth 1/2 water and subbed kale for the spinach and way more than called for.  Also, added a parm-regg rind as it was simmering.  Sooo, good!  I know, alot of changes but I really only used the recipe as a starting point.  Thanks so much!

I didn't follow the measurements exactly
but I took the advice and added pepper flakes, and substituted sausage and chicken broth with veggie bacon with some chicken bullion. 
...I'm on my third bowl.  Enough said. Super easy, and takes about 1.5 hours with minimal attending.

Very good.  Following other reviewer's tips, I used balsamic vinegar instead of regular and I didn't have port but I put in about 1/4 C red wine.  I also used chicken broth instead of just water--I would think it would be bland without the broth.  We added tabasco to our own for a little heat, sopped it up with bread and it was fantastic!

Great soup!  I added about 3-4 Tbsp cumin, which absolutely MADE the soup!  I also pureed about 1/2 of the soup in my food processor and returned it to the pot, which made the soup much more creamy.  I left out the spinach on this round, but will probably add it next time.  We added some sour cream individually at the dinner table, and my kids ate it up!  Make sure to get enough salt added too.  Oh, and I only used about 2 Tbsp oil.  Yum!

Healthy and delicious! I loved the spinach as an addition. I had made lentil soup many times before, but never with spinach. I had left overs the next day...and to stretch it I added some mini bow tie pasta and extra chicken broth and spinach. It was also delicious and cheap to make.

This turned out fantastic. I admit that I made a lot of changes, but I think the base is excellent and the changes just enhanced it. I cut out the olive oil and added half a package of sliced Basque chorizo, sauteing the aromatics with it. I added a teaspoon each of cayenne, smoked paprika, fresh parsley and an extra bay leaf, and increased the veggies (doubled the tomatoes, celery and garlic, quadrupled the spinach); I also used 2 cans each of veg and chicken stock, omitting the water and salt as a result. I used red wine vinegar. I will definitely make this again and again.

delicious and easy! Lasted my bf and I a whole week. Tastes good re-heated. I used partial vegetable stock instead of all water. Doubled the herbs and used a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes. You can never have too many tomatoes. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made many of the suggestions listed by other users.  If I were to make this again, I would leave out the vinegar.  For me the combination of tomatoes and vinegar gave the soup a brine like flavor which I didn't care for.  To off set it, I added a lot more water and a chopped sweet potato.

This is so good. I have made Lentil soup in the past, but this one is the winner.
I did add more carrots and a diced potato, and some ham I had in the freezer.
The end product is a delicious hearty soup.

Took some others' suggestions, I used more carrots (5 I think), no celery (don't tolerate it well), more garlic (probably 4-ish cloves), less oil (just enough to coat the bottom of my pot), 1 26 oz boxed chopped tomatoes (bpa-free!), doubled the basil and oregano, added a tsp of cumin, added extra veggies (couple each potato and sm. zucchini), used bouillon enough for one of the quarts of water, and added 4 tsp of balsamic vinegar at the end. Excellent!

Yummy!!!! Absolutely delicious! I love lentils and was on the mood for soup so I decided to make this one. I didn't have carrots or celery so I went with what I had on hand: one zuchinni, two small potatoes and celery flakes. Everything else was the same. I threw everything together in the slow cooker. This is one good soup!

Great! BUT what I would do different: add at least double of the carrots and celery. A large can of tomato. Double garlic and herbs. Other than that, amazing!!!

Might as well, throw some chopped potatos as well;)

This recipe was so simple and came out fantastic. I too substituted chicken broth for the water and added extra garlic. I would have given it 5 stars, but I felt like it was missing something to top it off. Reading the other reviews, cumin and curry might be the way to go for me as well, or adding a meat component. For such a relatively healthy meal, it really was satisfying.

Great healthy soup... very hearty tasting.  Any dices, crushed, or stewed tomatoes will do.  This makes a full pot of soup.  Plan on freezing half or eating for several days.  Very satisfying.

I altered a bit as others suggested:
doubled spices & added 2 tsp curry, carrots, garlic;
replaced broth for water;
used 4 tbsp balsalmic vinegar;
added 1 cup rice & 1 cup h2o;
blended 1/3 of soup in vitamix & added back for creaminess;
even my kids liked it!  Very hardy with great flavor!
topped with shredded creamy cheese

Made this in the crockpot and it came out great!  Followed someone else's suggestions to double the spices and carrots, use chicken broth/stock instead of water, added 2 red potatoes, and blended half of the soup and added it back to give it a thicker consistency. I just put all of the ingredients (except the spinach and vinegar) in the crockpot together and cooked on high for about 5-6 hours. Pureed half of the soup about an hour before we ate it; added in back and cooked for another hour; then added spinach at the very end. Served with grated parmesan cheese...yummy!

I used green, yellow, and red peppers along with potatoes just to use up some produce in the house. I also used 5 cups of chicken broth + 3 cups of water. Use balsamic vinegar. I omitted spinach and it was still tasty! Will make lotso' times more.

I love this soup, though I normally follow a recipe strictly the first time I use it, this one I didn't since I want spinach- I like to make a lot of soup one time and freeze the rest and didn't want gross looking spinach in the soup. Instead of vinegar I use lemon juice, but I followed everything else and all I can say is that I love it!

This was very hearty and pretty easy. It takes a long time, but it's worth the wait. I agree with the other reviewers that doubled the spices and added cumin/other additional spices. I also used balsamic vinegar, and it turned out very good. I will defiantly be making this again on cold winter nights, when I'm too stubborn to turn the heat on.

Our favourite soup - I make it all the time.  No need to change anything.  I did once add some cherry tomatoes just to use them up.  Delicious!  I always blend it because that's how I prefer my soups and then freeze it in individual portions.

Delicious. Of course, I changed things to suit my taste. I browned Italian sausage in the pot, sauteed the celery and onion until the juices were running then strained them out (I don't like to see either in my food). I used 4 carrots instead of two, and added a medium sized zucchini. Used 2 cups of vegetable brother instead of all water. Fresh oregano and basil, dry thyme, coriander, red chili flakes, and cumin. I forgot to add the spinach at the end but definitely will with my leftovers. A little bit of fresh grated Parmesan added a salty, savory kick.

This is a lovely soup and I was very excited to try it. I think the ingredient list is great and blends well together. The only problem I have is that this soup is EXTREMELY bland. It's... to the point of not really being very tasty bland... what am I doing wrong? Followed the recipe exactly. Ack!

WOW! This recipe is so awesome because you can alter it to your taste without screwing it up. I added lots of cayenne pepper, 2 sweet potatoes, parsley and a minced jalapeno. I also substituted diced tomatoes, doubled (maybe tripled) the garlic and used one can of veggie broth with less water. I was looking for a recipe that encompassed a lot of veggies so the ones in my fridge wouldn't go bad. I happened to have everything on hand and added whatever sounded good. The result: an economical, highly aromatic, hearty, healthy and absolutely DELICIOUS "stoup" that will feed a lot or serve as leftovers for days. I bet it would freeze well too. Thank you for posting such an inspiring recipe!

Super delicious!  My first try making lentil soup and I loved it!  I added my own touch on this by adding fire roasted diced tomatoes as well as the previous suggestions.

As I'm eating this soup my opinion of it keeps improving.  I used broth instead of water and just used a mixed italian seasoning.  I used red lentils and found the soup to be too gritty for me to tolerate.  Maybe this is because I've only eaten lentils a couple of times.  I ended up pureeing the entire pot of soup with my immersion blender and it is now delicious!  I highly recommend pureeing this soup, ours would have ended up in the trash if we had not done this.

Very nice, I used 4 cups of chicken stock, 4 cups of water. Double the garlic and added some chopped fresh asparagus spears when I added the spinach. Tasty one pot dinner.

This soup turned out really yummy! I did not add the vinegar and added kale instead of spinach.  oh and i added 2 chicken bouillon cubes to the water.  i think this soup would be good with more veggies too think i will try zucchini and squash next time.

I used sunflower oil instead of olive oil, forgot to add bay leaf, added more celery, omitted spinach and instead of water used chicken broth. Results = best...lentil soup...EVER!

I only made half of this recipe, but added 1 extra cup of water (instead of 2).  I left out the tomatoes and kept seasonings as it was for the full recipe.  I didn't have any spinach, so that was omitted and I added a pack of ham flavored seasonings. It came out delicious. I will make again but use chicken broth or bouillon for better seasoning.

Delicious!  I am a new convert to the soup bandwagon.  I found this recipe and liked it right away because it had ingredients that I have in my pantry.  I read the reviews and made some of the suggested changes.  Only 1/8 cup olive oil, finely chopped to almost pureed carrots, no celery, 4 cloves of garlic, doubled the oregano and the basil, included 1 tsp cumin, 1/8 tsp crushed red pepper, used Muir Glen fire-roasted crushed tomatoes for a nice smokey flavor, chicken broth instead of plain water, 1 cup chopped fresh spinach and spicy Italian sausage that I had left-over in the frig.  I forgot the vinegar but will try the balsamic as others have suggested. My family loved it and there was plenty left over for lunch the next day as well as some to freeze.  Obviously more than 6 servings.  A keeper!!

Delicious soup/stew! On it's second appearance as leftovers for us, I added some pecorino romano to it and served garlic bread on the side. It was almost a different meal. We will definitely make this one again--even my picky husband agrees!

With a few changes, this recipe is a keeper in our family. I add a couple of links of chopped smoked sausage, and I use balsamic vinegar instead of regular. I also added some chicken bouillon to make the water a bit more seasoned. I found that this soup tends to absorb a lot of liquid, so I add more as needed. Yummy!

this is a great recipe for lentil soup lovers! i am one of those people who pick out the carrots so i decided not to put them in. i also used less oil, stewed tomatoes, and 2 cups of beef broth. i also didn't put any spinach because i didn't have any. regardless, my modified version still came out great. i will be making more of this in the future!

Very flavorful soup - used diced tomatoes instead of crushed, but otherwise followed to the letter. Used balsamic vinegar as the vinegar and it was wonderful. Gave it a nice deep flavor.  I will definitely be adding this to our soup rotation!

This recipe was great! I left out the celery because I didn't have any on hand and added a can of corn (drained) instead. The result was delicious, healthy, and VERY filling.  Be careful though--this recipe makes a LOT of soup. Next time, I'll probably cut it in half.

This was very good with the tweaking the majority of people recommend. I also doubled the garlic and spices, added 1 tsp cumin, another 14oz can of tomatoes and 2 cups of chicken stock. I only had green french lentils on hand and would advise NOT to use them as they stay firm and never soften in soup like the brown or red lentils would-they are best for salads I think. However, the flavor was great and I'll try again with different lentils!

This was a fabulous recipe! Like many said, you can easily tweak the spices, but the base soup is fantastic. I used 4 heaping tsp of the minced garlic in the jar, 1 tsp curry, and added 4 tbsp of apple cider vinegar in the end. So tasty! Spoon over your favorite type of rice for a complete protein serving, and a delicious full meal (not just in the winter, but any time of year!)

I have made this twice now. The only changes that I have made are to add another carrot, a lot of garlic (I love garlic),  2 tbs apple cider vinegar. I add a dollop of plain Greek yogurt on top before serving. Super healthy, filling and really delicious. Even my boyfriend who does not like soup or vegetarian meals will eat this. Thank you for your recipe!

Was hesitant about adding the vinegar, but it did not make the soup taste acidic or vinegar-like at all. Somehow it did improve the flavor, though. Very good, basic recipe.

This is a good recipe, but after making it, I found that it's almost identical to the way I've always made my lentil soup, so for me, it was a repeat of something I've always made. .

I made this last night and it was excellent! It tasted even better today when I had it again for lunch. The only things I changed were a) cut out the olive oil (I only used 2 tablespoons) b) because I couldn't hold of tinned crushed tomato, I added four diced tomatoes and added several tablespoons of tomato paste for extra flavour.  Yum!

This recipe is very forgiving (easy to modify with substitutions) and always tastes amazing. The vinegar ties it all together--I use white distilled and prefer it to balsamic in this recipe. Try it with homemade bread and butter!

This soup turned out great! I followed some of the modifications other reviewers suggested (definitely double the spices and add cumin to taste).   Used 4 cups veggie broth and 4 cups water for the base.   I'll be eating this all week and making more when its done.   Thanks for sharing this recipe with the rest of us, Marie.

Excellent recipe!  The only changes I made was adding some red wine and I doubled the spices.  Healthy without sacrificing taste!

Delish and easy! I added some cumin and doubled the basil/oregano as well as the celery and carrots. I also added two yellow zucchinis for more veggies and put in 7 oz. of canned tomato sauce to flavor/thicken the broth. I also only used a tbs of oil to cut down on fat and ommitted the vinegar (because i forgot!) it was really good.

This was just ok.  I did add a lot of seasonings to the broth because I found it to be pretty bland as is.  No one in my family liked it much and it sat unloved in the fridge for a few days.  I would not make again, but I think it is decent base for those who love lentil soup.

Fantastic soup! Loved the flavour and of course I changed it to fit what I had on hand. Instead of water I used vegetable stock and instead of crushed tomatoes, I used diced.  White Balsamic vinegar was the acid of choice for this soup and it definitely makes the soup! Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was delicious, especially with crusty bread!  I used about 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2,  and I followed other reviewers' suggestions by using vegetable broth for half of the water called for.  However, if you like your lentil soup on the thicker side, you will not need all 8 cups of water/broth mixture.

Very satisfying soup!  If you want your soup to have texture, use brown or green lentils (also known as masoor lentils). Red and yellow lentils fall apart without any effort.

I found the flavor of this soup a bit dull. I should have read the suggestions about altering the flavor before I made it. However, it would be hard to beat this soup in terms of nutrition, especially for a vegetarian!

This is a great base recipe for lentil soup.  I used half vegetable broth and half water, doubled the spices, and added cumin, paprika, and some hot sauce.  I also used double the veggies.  It's really easy to add your own flair to this soup.  Also freezes well.

Great basic recipe! I added a few ingredients and it was. I added pancetta (Italian bacon), fresh tomatoes, crushed chile peppers, and used parsley instead of basil. I find that the parsley works better with lemon (used lemon instead of vinegar). This is definitely going in my favorites.

Excellent Soup.  I increased the celery, carrots and garlic to almost double.  Also used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes.  Substituted 4 cups of chicken broth for 4 cups of the water.  Added 4 links of smoked sausage cubed into half inch pieces and sautéed until brown.  Used fresh basil instead because I was out of the dried.

I've never eaten lentil soup before so I was unsure of how this would turn out. It was great! I followed the recipe for the most part. . . I used balsamic vinegar and I upped the spinach quite a bit, maybe 1.5 cups? Half a cup of fresh spinach didn't seem like very much after it was in the soup. I also added a few pieces of crumbled bacon because, as a Texan, it's almost unheard of to make a bean dish without some kind of pork ;)  I'm sure the recipe is great as-written though!

Tastes great!    I blended half of the soup and added it back to create better texture    Used fresh tomatoes to make it fresher - still tastes great!    Will need more than the recommended amount of vinegar (I used balsalmic) and I also added cilantro and tobasco sauce, which made it taste amazzzzinnngggg

Excellent soup, probably the best we've ever had!  Had to freeze the rest because there was so much leftover.    Here is what I did: Bag of pre-sliced thin carrots, 1 whole onion, 1/2 tsp marjoram, 1/2 tsp oregano, 3 garlic cloves, fresh basil (4 sprigs), 1 bay leaf dried and added 4 tbsp vinegar at the end.  Could have added more onions and carrots.  Cooked for 1 hr 5 minutes on 2 1/2 setting -- It was very thick (almost TOO thick) so added 1 cup of warm water in the end when adding the spinach and it was PERFECTION!   Next time, I would cook on the LOW setting on the stove for 1 hr, or on 2 1/2 setting on the stove for 50 minutes (without adding more water).  Hope this is helpful!

This is very good recipe. I made a few changes to make it more to my taste. I used half low fat chicken broth and half water for more flavor. I used 8 oz. of tomato sauce in stead of crushed tomatoes and two teaspoons of lemon juice instead of vinegar.The biggest change was adding one teaspoon of curry powder and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon that made this soup so delicious.

Excellent lentil soup recipe.  I followed a few of the recommended alterations: 4 carrots, 4 cloves garlic, 2 bay leaves, 8 cups of chicken broth instead of water, and balsamic vinegar.  Once the soup was finished, I put half of it in a blender than added back to the pot.  Perfect consistency and DELICIOUS.

I LOVED this after I made suggested changes!! I needed to use up zucchini so I added it, and it was great. I doubled the spices and the amount of carrots, but other than that it was the same! This almost tasted like a meaty stew!

This is an excellent dish for you to make if you're looking to work with cheap and readily available ingredients.  I've made it several times it's turned out well, but it seemed to be missing something.  I decided to replace 3/4 of the water with chicken stock and replace the can of crushed tomatoes with a small can of tomato paste.  I meant to add the paste in the with the veggies while they were  cooking in the oil, but I forgot and ended up adding it after I'd added the liquid.  It turned out amazing.  I accidentally omitted the balsalmic vinegar as well.

This soup is wonderful!  My husband thought it was the best lentil soup I'd ever made (and I've tried a few!!).  I added one chicken buillion cube and used 4 cups of water and 4 cups of low-salt chicken broth instead of all water because in my experience lentil soup can be a little flavorless.  Can't wait to make it again!  Thank you for sharing, Marie.

Yummy hearty healthy soup. Added 2 extra carrots, doubled the herbs, put in a pinch of red pepper flakes, added an extra cup of red lentils to the 2 cups of green lentils, used frozen spinach and replaced the vinegar with lemon juice. Would make again.

This was very tasty.  I took others' recommendations and doubled the oregano and basil.  I used 28 oz of crushed tomatoes and added 6 cubes of boullion to heated water.  I cooked on high in a crockpot for 5 hours, then turned it to low until we were ready to eat.  Topping with parm cheese is such a great addition!

A good, hearty soup. Make sure you remember the vinegar (I used balsamic) because it's what REALLY makes the soup worthwhile!

This is a great recipe I changed it a little I added a lot more fresh garlic and a large28oz can of crushed tomato plus a can of chicken broth in place of some of the water.  I also served it with parmesean cheese and Italian bread  It is delicious I can't stop eating it.

I doubled the spices and garlic cloves and the soup was still kind of bland.  A great base, but it just needs a bit of tweaking to make it more flavorful.

This soup was great!  I was out of Oregano so I used Thyme instead and I threw in a couple of vegetable boullion cubes and I forgot to put in the vinegar, but everyone loved it.

Absolutely Delicious!  Did change the recipe a bit...followed others directions and only used 1 T of olive oil.  Didn't have a bay leaf, spinach nor crushed tomatoes, so we threw in a can of Rotel with Green Chiles.  Had some left over ham, so chopped up a cup and added it to the pot.  My family loved it and has already asked when we're having it again!

This is a great standard lentil soup. The only thing I did different was use balsamic vinegar instead of regular vinegar and it was great. The spinach is a great addition. Easy, healthy, delicious...what more can you ask for from a recipe?

Awesome soup.  The only things I changed were to add the meat from 1 smoked ham shank, added about 1/2 tsp ground cumin, and 4 bouillon cubes.  The bouillon cubes brought the salt level to just about perfect without additional salt.

I LOVED it.....my hubby didn't care much for the lentils (at no fault of the soup!).  The flavor had a slight sweetness to it and tasted very fresh!  I will make this again, only next time perhaps throw in some ham so that hubby has something other than lentils to sink his teeth into!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I would say 4 1/2 stars. I did make some changes, used 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken stock. Added some crushed red pepper, and omitted the vinegar and spinich. My daughter has celiac and so we are always looking for something good and easy that is gluten free. With the GF stock, this was a great dish completely gluten free and lots of protein and fiber from the lentils.  I used my immersion blender and blended the soup at the end. Reserved about 1/2 of the lentils for texture--could have pulled out more for a chunkier soup.  All in all a great soup, needed a little more doctoring but my entire family enjoyed it very much! Healthy and great tasting! Thanks

This soup was so good!  I was looking for a a low calorie soup because I'm watching my weight and came across this one.  Very easy to make.  I only used 1 cup of lentils (thought I had more in my pantry) and the soup still thickened.  I substituted dried thyme for the basil and oregano, and omitted the spinach and it turned out great.  I served it with  garlic bread my husband enjoyed it.

I am making this now and the broth tastes fantastic – I used the low sodium vegetable broth – it’s supposed to be ½ cube for every cup of water, I used 6 cubes for 8 cups of water.  I also added extra garlic and used Italian Seasoning when sautéing the veggies (instead of the oregano, bay leaf and basil seperately).  I added a lot of cumin and some smoked paprika, then I used an orange chiptle seasoning… both of which are smoky (since I’m not putting ham in these beans, it gives it a nice flavor).  I used no salt added basil and oregano diced tomatoes.  The beans are a mix of mung beans, lentils, black beans and adzuki beans.  I think it’s going to come out really well… I put the soaked beans, sautéed veggies and extra Orange Chipotle  and cumin in the crock pot for the next four hours.  I think I’ll make some jalepeno cornbread to go with it.  With the addition of my spices I did not add additional salt and pepper, nor did I add vinegar.  OH, and I used leeks in lieu of onions and will add fresh chopped green onions and spinach to the beans before serving thereby eliminated the "yucky spinach for leftovers" some reviewers complained about -- also fresh veggies will give it nice flavor and texture.

I altered this recipe a bit, but it was great!  I omitted vinegar, and omitted the oil except for about a teaspoon to saute the carrots/onion.  I doubled the amount of carrots, used a lot more spinach, added some diced tomatoes, and substituted a mix of chicken broth and vegetable broth for half of the water.   And I added a little diced ham because my husband always wants some sort of meat. It was awesome, and my husband thought so too.  My kids weren't home that weekend so they didn't get to try it, but I will be making this again, soon! UPDATE:  My eldest requests this, she absolutely loves this soup.  My youngest still hates soup.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. I use 1/2 water and 1/2 broth. The balsamic vinegar at the end really gives it a great finish. I've also made it with 1 cup barley and 4 cups broth, increasing seasoning by 50%.

Yummy, can use a bit more spice though. If you use SPLIT lentils, it takes about 30 minutes, 40 start-finish. No modifications req'd except to up spices; I added bell peppers, don't do that except when you add the spinach, if you add them early like I did they just become soggy mush.

WOW! this soup was amazingly good! I did as others suggested and used 8 cups of beef stock instead of water. I also browned up some chorizo sausage and added that for a little extra kick.... my husband and i loved it. Will definitley become a winter staple around my house.

I have made this several times and it is always well received by my family.  I usually omit the vinegar (the husband is not a fan).  I have made it with leftover ham after the holidays and it is delicious!

Very tasty! I also made substitutions based on Blankin's comments. I added 1 extra stick of celery, 2 more carrots, 2 cans of tinned tomatoes, 1 chicken oxo cube, 1 veg oxo cube, some chilli flakes, another clove of garlic, and just before serving 3 tablespoons of port and juice of 1 lemon, then blended the whole lot! Yummy!

Wow this recipe is amazing! The flavor exceeds my expectation. I adjusted the ingredients a little bit and it came out great. I eliminated spinach and vinegar, added 48 oz (5 cups) chicken broth plus 2-3 cups water, used 4 carrots instead of 2, and added 1/2 cube vegetable bouillon for rich flavor. My guests said this soup is amazing! One of the best soups I ever made! Thank you.

Awesome soup.  I made a few very minor changes because I didn't have everything in the list of ingredients.  I added about 2 cups of cut up ham from a spiral ham I made a few days ago and simmered the soup with the ham bone too.  I used baby carrots and jarred crushed garlic. I didn't have any spinach so I left that and the vinegar out.  It was superb! Thanks for sharing!

LOOOVE this recipe! I have made it numerous times and occasionally tinkered a bit with the ingredients (added sausage, more spinach/and or garlic, 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes)... all variations were very tasty and satisfying. I do prefer to substitute chicken broth for the water ... this recipe is a winner.

I LOVE this recipe. Yes, you can add more tomatoes or choose whatever lentils, but the basic recipe is fab! For those who try and eat the most greens possible, I don't even wilt the spinich. I just pour the soup right over the spinich and eat. So healthy and delicious! Thanks for sharing!

this was pretty delicious-- i followed the recipe for the most part but took the suggestion to use lemon juice instead of vinegar (i started with half a lemon, but discovered after a couple bites that I loved the lemon taste and ended up squeezing in an extra lemon or two). I also added some hot italian sausages (mmm!) and used trader joe's "Organic Tomatoes--Diced and Fire roasted with Organic Green Chiles" in place of the canned tomatoes. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe! :)

Very good soup. I changed it up a little and used some suggestions from others. I added more of each spice, plus a generous 1 tsp each of cumin and coriander, 3/4 tsp of curry powder, 4 carrots, 5-6 celery sticks, potatoes, green beans, 4 cups of vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and 4 cups of water. I also added brown rice, barley, a mixed beans to this recipe as well as the lentils. very hearty and nutritious. And I only used about 2 tbsp of the oil instead of 1/4 cup. Will definitely make again!

This was pretty good lentil soup, although not the best. I did substitute water with chicken stock and add extra veggies as well as cumin. I was missing basil though, so maybe that does the trick. I'll try making it again. I froze a ziplock bag of it in the freezer and I hope it stays well.

Best lentil soup I have ever made, but I tweaked it. I used a can of chicken broth and only 4 cups of water. I used garlic seasonings instead of fresh garlic. I did use a large onion, and let it cook with the garlic seasonings and 5 chopped carrots, then added the lentils AND a can of garbonzo beans AND can of diced tomatoes. It is absolutely delicious. Check out other lentil soup recipes, and have fun adding various ingredients. I usually am creative with every recipe I make. Try some new things, if you don't like what is in the current recipe. Most cases, you will be happily surprised how good things turn out.

This was the best recipe I've tried for lentil soup. I only changed the garlic to 4 cloves and used veggie broth instead of water. People should also keep in mind that olive oil is actually GOOD FAT (please google it) so you really don't need to omit it. Olive oil is good for you all around and it gives the soup a very good flavor. LOVED IT.

Wow! This was absolutely delicious! When I first tasted it right after being cooked I thought it was too bland, but I let it sit a few hours in the pot and when I fixed my bowl it was so tasty. I think the oregano and basil really compliments the lentils. I did make a few changes. I did 2 cups vegetable broth, 6 cups water, the consistency was perfect. I added a half a teaspoon more oregano and basil, another garlic clove and another bay leaf, I left out the spinach and vinegar. My daughter and I got seconds, I almost went back for thirds!

I love this recipe, but have made a few changes: I think 8 cups of water is kind of bland so I use a 28 oz can crushed tomatos, 4 cups veg. stock and about 1/2 cup water for the liquid.  I double all the spices and carrots, i skip the spinach, but always finish the bowl off with baslamic vinegar. I also add a couple of potatos diced and put in when there is about 1/2 left to cook.  Throw in green beans if i have them.  Oh, and I use Green/Brown Lentils (not red) This makes excellent leftovers too :)

A friend made this. Found it to be ok, but slightly on the bland side. I tried making it with substitutions: Added some madiera port (forget the vinegar, the port has the same softening affect), extra onions, and used kale. Roasted my plum toms before adding to the pot and added a scant tsp. of brown sugar. Next time I'll try it with napa, or perhaps savoy cabbage; will bump up the herbs a bit, too.

I substituted chicken broth for the water and added a little extra garlic and it was fabulous. I made it twice and the second time cut the oil in half and it was just as good.

Great, but I do make some changes.  I use chicken stock in place of water, and I leave out the vinegar.  My 3-year-old picky eater loves this soup, and it's one of my hubby's favorites, plus it's really heathy and cheap.

Very Good! Changed the recipe a bit...started by boiling the lentils and herbs, then simmered for about 1 1/2 hours. Added 1/3 cup chunky garden pasta sauce and simmered for 10 more minutes. Recipe is for 2 servings.

Great recipe - Didn't change a thing and love it!  The soup is very filling and a serving can be your whole meal.  I freeze it and bring it to work for lunch - tastes just as good when it is thawed in the microwave.

Great soup!  I didn't add the spinach (because I didn't have any) and added a 28oz can of tomatoes on accident.  Still came out great!  Using a dash of balsamic vinegar in each bowl really makes it!

Great,simple,and delicious!Cooking time is bit long but well worth it. I would recommend to add potatoes for texture.Also, it seems like it may need more than 8 cups of water, so instead i added 10 and the results were more than perfect.

Wonderful recipe.  My husband ate 3 bowls and took the leftovers to work the next day. I added just a little more salt and pepper.  I took the tip of using balsamic vinegar and that really boosted the flavor. It was excellent with cornbread.

This soup is delicious, although I did make a few changes.  I used 4 cups beef broth and 4 cups water and used balsamic vinegar along with adding a piece of romano cheese to the soup while simmering.

Lentils are so under-rated. They are fabulous in this soup. Even my picky 6 year old asked for some and ate it up. Added some cumin as another reviewer suggested. Cumin and lentils go great together.

I love how healthy this recipe is. I gave it a 4 because the recipe does need made with chicken stock and must have cumin in it- otherwise it is a little bland.  Great, easy recipe overall though.

This was excellent, although I did make a number of changes. I omitted the spinach since I didn't think my kids would appreciate it, but threw in two zucchinis instead - they fell apart and no one knew they were there. I also left out the crushed tomatoes, I feel like so much of our food is drowned in tomato flavor, why not enjoy the lentils taste unmasked. I added 1 tsp. cumin and 1 chicken soup bullion. What  great soup!

Awesome and easy recipe.  I changed it up a little. I added beef stock, upped the veg and added lean group beef. It feed the family for two days and was a wam welcome to the wintery weather New England is starting to see. Oh we added a bit of parm cheese when served.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is awesome! I followed the advice of JPMARYLAND and I put 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2, 4 carrots instead of 2 and chicken broth instead of water and it was delicious!! Being pregnant I think it's perfect too because of all the veggies.

Thanks!!

Absolutely great! We doubled the recipe to share with friends and had leftovers for a week.  Perfect for a chilly fall day or for tailgating.  We tried shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top and found that to be delicious as well. Excellent value for the money!

Excellent.  I used one onion, half a package of celery including leaves, 4 carrots and sauteed with the spices and a couple of bay leaves.  I threw in some additional dried italian seasoning and some additional garlic and salt and pepper with sautee, added lentils to coat and then added the tomatos, veg. broth and let it go for about 75 mins.  Added spinich and balsamic vinegar and I have to say it is one of the best "meaty" lentil soups I've had.  I would highly recommend.

Excellent soup Marie!  I used chicken stock instead of water and only 7 cups, not 8 as I like my soup with a little less broth.  I also used a lot more spinach than called for.  Once in the bowl I added a sprinkle of Parm and a teaspoon more vinegar.  Add some french bread and you have a delicious and healthy meal here.

I am giving only 4 stars because based on what I changed, I would have probably thought the recipe as-is would be bland. I doubled the spices, including garlic, and it was perfect for me. I also used double the carrots and grated them. I used half olive oil and half coconut oil, and let me tell you, what a wonderful flavor that gives to this soup. I would encourage people to try the coconut oil in this. I wouldn't necessarily buy it just for this recipe, but I had it since it's a widely used ingredient in vegan cooking. It just goes so well with this dish. Subtle, but there. I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomato, 8 cups of veg broth, and some extra water later when it seemed too thick. I put lemon juice in individual servings right before eating since the flavor disappears when stored. I did not have spinach so I skipped that. I used an immersion blender a few quick times, to give it thickness. This is delicious - I am finishing some right now. I also recommend sweet potatoes with it. I threw some leftover sp fries into my container with the soup to bring to lunch and it goes great together!

This is a perfect base recipe, even without personal touches.

I prefer a tomato-less lentil soup, which is an easy change, and I like to use broth (such as boxed low-sodium free-range chicken, or vegetable broth) instead of water.

I have used soy "meat" such as "sausage" added near the end (because soy "meats" can fall apart with long cooking), and I have also used real meat (meaty bacon or a piece of no-chemical Beeler's Hog Wild ham) added early on to infuse the vegetables with extra flavor.

I like a big handful of fresh flat-leaf parsley added at the end, and I like both the partly-blended version as well as the 100%-chunky version.

I have used red lentils to make the soup and stirred in a half to a whole cup of COOKED du puys or Beluga lentils at the end.  This makes a lovely speckled soup without the dark lentils blending with the red ones and creating a muddy color.

This soup is great served with a dollop of low-fat sour cream or a thick plain yogurt on top, too.

Good comfort food type lentil soup which is great in cold weather.   Refer to this as heart warming and should be eaten in front of an open  fire!   For our taste buds, after trying the original recipe, I added some hot pepper flakes and more tomatoes.   I do not rate a recipe until I have tried it in it's original state because this is not fair to the submitter.   Thanks for a very good recipe.

Good stuff! Added more garlic as always (chunks,mmmm), 4.5c water, 4.5c ckn bullion and cooked a little longer. I am not a big sausage fan, but just love it in lentil soup & can't resist adding it - adds so much - first thing in the pot for 3-4 mins! Also added a teaspoon of parsley.  Near end, added some dashes of worcestershire and red tobasco sauce for flava!(and omitted the vinegar). Took much less time than I thought. Oh, and lentil soup is always better the next day. :-)

We really liked this recipe. We made it almost exactly as written, except for using one large fresh tomato (needed to use it before it went bad) instead of the canned tomatoes. We tried to eat after one hour, and was not ready yet, so I recommend cooking it for 2 hours. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that my boyfriend prefers to eat all soups cold, and this soup was not very good cold.

Wow this turned out MUCH better than I expected.  I followed the recipe closely except I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed (that was all I had) and accidently forgot to add the spinach at the end.  The soup tasted great and everyone in my family raved, so I will definitely be making this again.

I love this recipe- it's simple, healthy and delicious. I usually leave out the celery because I never finish the bunch. It's great with a dollop of sour cream on top, and is great as a leftover.

This soup is great, I've made it three times and every time was delicious.  I replace a cup or two of water with vegetable or chicken broth for more flavor.

I made some changes that had to be made to make it better.  I added turkey sausage crumbled into pieces.  Also I cut the amount of Lentils by a third.  The first time I made it there were way to many.  Also I switched the reg vinegar  for balsamic.

Good stuff! A lot like my own lentil soup recipe, but I really liked the addition of spinach. When I make this, I omit the vinegar in favor of a couple generous Tbs sherry at the end (obviously letting the booze cook off). Also, lots of people put ham or bacon in lentil soup -- to keep it veg, I add a small amount of liquid smoke early on in the cooking. Oh, and don't just add celery stalks -- the celery tops are a must, since they contain all the flavor.

I added extra garlic, basil, oregano, and tomatoes. It was still pretty bland after all that but improved a lot after adding a bunch of salt.

Like most other reviewers, I really had to kick up the spices on this.  At least twice the garlic, oregano, and basil.  I also added a dash of parsley and some cumin.  I used a combination of tomato juice and water for the broth; I also used a 28-ounce can of tomatoes and more than the called-for vegetables.  Didn't want onions, so left those out, and added some green peas as well.  The overall flavor is REALLY nice (hence the four stars), but until I added the tomato juice to the broth, it tasted basically like water.  So I recommend that addition.  I will make this again, but will either leave out the spinach or add it sooner, because it wound up very flat and flavorless and chewy.  I may also remove the lentil skin; I love lentils, but the skin's texture doesn't blend with the soup too well.

this is a great soup. i did however add and subtract from the recipe. i did not add the spinach and vin. i did add a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes insted of a smaller one it gave it more flavor and i added more salt and pepper. i used italian seasoning and little pasta tubes at the end. NOTE: lentils need a few hours to cook till tender. this soup was wonderful and simple.

I liked this soup!  There is just something missing and I can't put my finger on it.  I just made it today so I'm going to eat more tomorrow and see if it gets better as it sits.  I did cut down the oil to 1 tablespoon.  It is very healthy so that is great!

Fantastic recipe!
After recently returning to a vegetarian lifestyle, I've been searching for filling and nutritious recipes I can make on Sundays that'll last me as leftovers all week. This one is a definite keeper for my recipe book. Changes I made (based on the many reviews I read): Firstly, I browned the onions and garlic together in the olive oil to really bring out the garlic flavor. I used 11 cups of water, and 6 veg. boullion cubes, 1 & 1/2 teaspoons of both oregano and basil. I also added garlic salt, 3 bay leaves and some extra crushed tomatoes. I like my soup a bit more brothy, so if you do, too- definitely add more water/stock. It makes a difference.

All in all, wonderful.

I have made this soup both exactly as listed and with substitutions. The second time, I had a lentil starter box (with dry lentils, peas, carrots, etc...)  beef bouillon, cumin, red wine instead of vinegar,and sausage. (So I guess the second time really wasn't this recipe!) Both ways are absolutely delicious. I didn't think I liked lentil soup! An economical, easy way to get your veggies in.

Awesome lentil soup. Only changes I made were to use red wine instead of vinegar. I used about 1/4 cup of red wine. Gives the soup a really rich taste. Also used 4 cups water and 4 cups chicken stock. Definitely a keeper.

Really delicious soup!! I was a bit skeptical at first plus only had canned lentils but it still turned out great.  Added the liquid from the lentils plus another cup of water and also added some vegetable bouillon.  Used baby spinach and balsamic vinegar at the end. 
Super flavour, hearty texture and healthy to boot!  Thanks for a great recipe

Not bad, except if you're using vinegar, use balsamic like other reviewers suggest.  I didn't have any and used apple cider vinegar, and that flavor was just too pronounced.  It's still not bad soup, but I imagine it could be a lot better.

This was really good and so comforting in the cold weather.  I used canned diced tomatoes and a veggie bouillion cube, and I increased the spices a little, but other than that followed the recipe.  This is a great basic lentil soup.  Will definitely make again.

Overall a fine, basic, and easy to prepare recipe. I added Italian sausage & diced ham to mine, and substituted chicken broth for half of the water. I also used 6 cups of baby spinach, but that is only because I love spinach (and it really cooks down). That added a nice color accent. The end result was delicious, and I even made it on a weeknight!

This soup turned out great!!!!  My son hasn't been eating vegetables lately, this was a good way to get him to eat them.  I made this recipe, and added french bread and a nice salad with creamy italian dressing...  It was a hit!!! There were noooooo left overs.  My son made what he called soupwiches with the bread and the soup.  I'd say this onw is a winner!

YUM.  This works *very* well in a slow cooker - I sautéed the veggies as specified, only I doubled the spices and garlic.  Then I put the veggies, lentils and 8 cups of chicken broth (water seemed too bland a choice) into a slow cooker and set it for high heat for 6 hours. Best lentil soup ever!

I added 2 c. water and 1 Tbsp. vinegar once the soup cooled (for leftovers).  It freezes really well too!

Nice soup.  Used chicken stock instead of the water, added red pepper flakes, and parm. cheese on top before serving.

I used chicken broth instead of water (not vegetarian), and a splash of red wine - making it a little more flavorful. It was very tasty and would make it again. My taste-tester husband thought it was a little thick but to each their own!

The recipe did not have much flavor.  I should have read the reviews before I  made it for extra suggestions.  I had to add a bunch of salt and my fiance didn't eat much of it.  I think adding sausage or using some kind of stock instead of water would have been a better choice.

I just made this soup last night.  Absolutely delicious.  I added some fully cooked diced smoked turkey breast during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  
Thank you for a healthy hearty recipe!

This was okay.  Mine did not have much flavor despite all the herbs and garlic.  And the lentils were still not totally soft after cooking for almost an hour and a half.  Sorry, I don't think we'll make this again.

I used vegetable broth instead of water.  Also, used frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh just because I had it.  Added some sea salt and some tamari (soy sauce) to make this soup excellent and cleansing. Ha! Ha!

My first experience with lentils.  I nixed the spinach and celery, and used apple cider vinegar instead of plain distilled.  Delicious and healthy.

This soup was fairly easy to make. I found it took quite a while for the lentils to soften up, and the soup never really got as thick as the picture. Pretty yummy. I forgot the vinegar, so maybe next time that will add a little more flavor to it. I will make this one again.

Honestly, we couldn't even eat this! We like lentil soup but this one was very bland.
The only reason I gave it three stars is under the assumption that it could be improved with additional seasoning.

This is my favorite lentil soup so far - other recipes I have tried turned out very bland, but this one really tastes nice. I used homemade chicken broth instead of water, doubled the spices called for in the recipe, and added red wine at the end instead of vinegar.  The result was delicious.

This was incredible! I thought my mom's lentil soup was good but wow!! I added diced ham, substituted 2 cans of chicken stock and the rest of the stock as vegetable bouillion, didn't use the vinegar (already enough flavor). This will be a winter keeper.

I made this soup and it was quite good, but not the best ever. Of course I made a few changes. I put in hot italian sausage that I'd crumbled and browned. And I used low-sodium chicken broth instead of water. It took more than eight cups of liquid as the soup simmered and the liquid evaporated, so I added in two more cups of water to get the soup to the right consistency.

It was good the next day. It heated up well and I froze the leftovers and those have bene great, too.

Wow, this was definitely missing some flavor.  The ingredients are fine, but needs some spices.  I added 3 packets of Goya seasoning and a lot of tomato paste to give it some taste.

This is an easy soup recipe to play with (as other reviewers have had success doing).  Our family likes it when I add a pound of chunked-up spicy turkey sausage (Italian-style, casings removed).  It adds just the right amount of spice and nice meaty texture.

This lentil soup was good. It certainly was not the best I've ever had. I also added 3 cloves garlic and 5 cups beef broth, and 3 cups water. I fried up 1 lb pork breakfast sausage and added it towards the end of the cooking cycle. I'm not sure if I'll make this again. I really was not impressed and the 245 recipe reviews was very deterring from the actual result. I would love to try some serious renditions of this recipe.

Absolutely delicious. Whole family loved it! Only change I made was to use leftover chicken broth and veggie broth, from other meals. Will definitely make again.

Awesome.  I made this for myself, but my husband decided to taste it and after he did so, he ended up eating 2 bowls!  This is a keeper.  Smells awesome!

Fantastic!  Tastes great with a hearty bread or brown rice.  I used chicken broth and a little less vinegar.  It also helps to soak the lentils for a few minutes so they cook faster.

I give this four stars if you use broth instead of water. Only 3 stars if you use water - it needs a lot more help in the seasoning department than the recipe indicates if you use water.

Yum, yum, yum!!!  I made it for a Lenten Friday night dinner, I added Knorr vegetable bouillon cubes to the  water (to keep it meatless).  When I was ready to serve, no one was hungry.  So I popped it into the fridge and the next night DH & DS wanted some!  Each had two huge bowls and loved it!  And, to be honest, I forgot to put the spinach and vinegar in and I/we all loved it.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I found this to lack flavor.  I added a lot of balsamic vinegar.  I also had mushrooms on hand and threw some in, and I found that I had too much water, so I put some spiral pasta in as well.  It was good, but I'm going to try it with vegetable broth instead of water next time.

This soup is fantastic.  The first time I made it, I didn't have any spinach on hand and I passed on the vinegar.  Instead, I drizzled a little bit of good, extra virgin olive oil on the top.  It was great.  After reading the reviews, next time I'll try with a splash of balsamic vinegar.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Solid recipe--the first thing I've ever cooked that involves steps, incredibly simple. I used an extra cup of water and about 6 extra oz of crushed tomatoes as well as chili powder, and it turned out great.

By FAR the best Lentil Soup I've ever made - thanks Marie!!!!!
I added a few ounces of chopped Kielbasa sausage to up the protein level a bit.  Trouble is, I ate so MUCH of the soup that I don't think I'll ever need to eat again!

Family loved this.  We are not vegetarians though so I browned sausage with the veggies and used beef broth instead of plain water.  I was not too sure about adding all the vinegar so I added in small quantities.  I ended up using the full 2 tablespoons.  I think the vinegar is the secret ingredient.  Gives the soup a nice tang and enhances the flavor.  Thanks.

A great recipe, just what lentil soup should be.  I made a few changes - I replaced half the water with chicken broth, threw in a ham bone that I had left over while it was cooking, doubled the veggies and spices, and left out the spinach since I was all out.  Also, I used white wine vinegar instead.  Next time I will double the tomatoes too.  Just perfect with a hearty bread for a cold winter night.  One of my new favorite comfort foods.

Very good! I cooked the lentils in a crockpot. I didn't use any oil. I substituted  3 cans of beef consumme for p   art of the water. Don't leave out spinach! I used balsamic vinegar and red pepper flakes.

This soup is so good that my kids have asked me to make it again.  I used beef broth instead of water, and added spinach only to my portion.  But husband and kids all gave it a thumbs up.  I'll make this dish often in the cold months ahead.  It's satisfying and healthy to boot!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recipe as written, except I did not have any spinach.  I added some salt.  It is a delicious, comforting soup, not so salty like the canned soups.  It does make a LOT, more than the 6 servings the recipe claims.  I live alone, so maybe I will halve the recipe the next time I make it.  Good stuff!

Great recipe. First time I've ever made lentil soup. My husband who is not a big soup person, really liked it. I added some smoked sausage in the last 30 minutes to add a little flavor. Added a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, and used chicken broth instead of water - added and extra 2 cups of broth to make up for so much crushed tomatoes. We like tomatoes, and it came out great. Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good! It helps to have a "chopper" when dicing all of the vegetables. I put a few baby spinach leaves on the bottom of the bowl and let the heat from the soup wilt the spinach. The aroma when the veggies were cooking was wonderful and even my picky daughter enjoyed it!

We thought this was okay.  It was bland and needed a little kick.  I could see using it as a starter soup and then adding other ingredients to jazz it up, but as it is, I don't think I'd want to bother with it again.

This is a fantastic soup.  I haven't had to make any substitutes and I make this often.  It's a big hit at my potluck dinners, especially with vegetarians.  I find it great even made with water, although I often cook it longer than an hour.  That helps the lentils breakdown and make it thicker.  I could live on this soup!

I used stock instead of water, added a little hot sauce and skipped the spinach (for the kids).  I would leave the spinach in if they weren't here.  Double it for leftovers, but use a huge pot.

Easy to make and was pretty good.  But it could use a little something else to give it some kick.  My husband liked it with some tabasco.

EXCELLENT!  I omitted the spinach, used chicken broth instead of water and added about 1 tablespoon of curry powder.  I did have to add more water since the lentils soaked up most of the broth.  A wonderful, filling meal!

Good soup -- but be prepared to inject some creative kick! I added a lot more balsamic vinegar and then when served, parmesan cheese on my husband's bowl, and sour cream in mine. We preferred his, but mine was good too. The addition of potatoes was a good idea. I blended half of of the soup and then added that back to the original, which resulted in a very nice texture; I will do this every time. Leftovers, of which there were TONS, was not as good over pasta as expected, but reheated as soup was great.

Delicious and simple - great winter comfort food for us vegetarians. I cut the recipe in half and cooked it in my crock pot. I think for a change, next time, I'll add some curry powder for an Indian flair. YUM!

This is not exactly like what I was looking for, but it was good.  I didn't add the celery or tomatoes and I ran it all through the food processor at the end for the creamy consistency that I know lentil soup to be.  Also I substituted lemon juice for vinegar.

Edit March 2014:  This is now my go to recipe for Ash Wednesday.  I serve it with Jo's Rosemary Bread from this site.  I also cut the oil to 1 Tbsp.  I've also thrown in mushrooms to make it a bit heartier and I still blend it to make it creamy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make this all the time, with a few changes for my kids' palates: instead of crushed tomatoes and vinegar, I add about 1/4 cup of ketchup and omit the spinach. It has a smoother consistency that the kids like (no chunks of tomatoes) and it still tastes excellent. I have made it for lots of people and it is always a hit.

Great recipe! I love that there are no unhealthy or unnatural ingredients... and after simmering for an hour the flavors blend together wonderfully. Honestly it was a little blander than I expected, but I liked it very much. The vinegar adds a nice subtle tanginess to it. Next time I might add a little beef buillion but its not necessary. I ate it with sweet cornbread which was yummy but next time I'll use Italian bread since I'm a dipper. Definitely worth giving a try!

The one thing I like about a soup such as this is you can be as creative as you want.  I added lots of red pepper and used canned spinach, omitted the vinegar and used diced tomatoes.  Added lots of oregano, basil etc.  Next time I will try to use less oil.

This hit the spot on a cold day.  Very heaty and filling.  I added lots of spices because it was kind of bland.  Very good topped with parmesean cheese.  Also used the soup to top pasta.  Will make again.

Just the thing for a cold January night! Nice and hearty and thick. I did add a little Parmesan cheese and crisp, crumbled bacon for a garnish, which also added a little flavour.

This was so easy!  It had a lot more flavor than I thought it would.  Although I love lentil soups with bacon, it can be so messy to prepare.  So, this was a nice change. My husband loved that this was a totally vegan soup. I will definitely be making this again.

I've made this soup three times out of the last four weeks.  I've omitted the vinegar the last two times I've made it because I forgot that it was an ingrediant, and I did not miss it.  This soup is so easy to make that you don't need to refer to the recipe after you make it once.  This is a great base recipe, you can easily alter it to have different flavors without messing it up.  Try it with warmed french bread topped with goat cheese.  My kids eat it too!!

I loved this lentil soup recipe.  It was my first time making lentil soup.  I also added the
potatoes.  I included the tomatoes and the spinach.  Could use a little bit more kick.  I just
loaded it up with pepper though.  Great for a warm winter dish.

This is delicious soup, filling, inexpensive and easy to make.  Lentils are not common in Guatemala, although they are available.   But I had to feed some men working in our fields, and made this.  I pretty much followed the recipe, with, of course, some changes because that is normal for me.  The main  change was to add ham, but I also had no spinach.  Otherwise, we really liked it.  I served it with cream on top, to make it more like a similar dish made here with black beans, and it disappeared.  My hubby, who is not a big fan of soups, really liked it.  I added a bit of ginger to it, and served it with hot sauce available on the side.  I will be making this again.

This was an amazing soup. Super easy and cheap for college students. I did make some changes after reading the comments. I used 4 cups of vegetable broth with 4 cups of water. I also doubled all the spices, and used a 28oz of crushed tomatoes, but I think if I make this again I'll use diced tomatoes. I also used about 1.5 potatoes. I added some chili power and red chili flakes but they didn't make it hot enough for us, so we just added some hot sauce to the end and that made it perfect. Just serve with a couple slices of bread and it's a perfect comfort soup. Will definitely be making again.

Dont cook a lot but wanted to try something with lentils. I used 1-2 cups less water to make more of a meal than a soup and didn't have onion or celery so doubled the spinach and added bell pepper and fresh tomatoes and did add tablespoon of redwine vinegar but also a added a squeeze of quarter of a lemon. This is my kind of meal. Lentils are pretty tasty who knew! Easy recipe and so delicious and satisfying! I added red pepper flakes also for some spice.

Delicious! I make it at least once a month. Like many reviewers I add my own flair every time I make it. But I have basically learned this recipe by heart with my own little twists. I simply season it to my liking. So I add a bit more basil, bay leaves... garlic ..etc. adding to the existing recipe is only a matter of personal preference. What I find amazing about this recipe is that is just as tasty with it without chicken broth. The times I’ve made it with water it has also been just as good if not better. I personally love adding lemon when I serve it. Absolutely family favorite.

I added 1/2 tsp each of cumin and coriander and paprika ... and 1/4 tsp of cayanne pepper. I also doubled the canned tomatoes and doubled/tripled the vinegar. I did not use celery so I added a bit more carrot. It made approximately 8 x 500ml servings.  Great for meal prep or large families/groups.

I would have used 1 cup lentils for 64 oz. of liquid. I chose to use 32 oz. water and 32 oz. organic chicken bone broth (unsalted) for the liquid. I also used 1 whole bunch of chopped spinach (not 1/2). I tossed in some kale and Swiss chard I had in the vegetable drawer. I added these 15 minutes into the simmering cycle.

Seasonings: 
*2+ TBSP. Lee Kum Kee oyster sauce. This is my go-to "salt substitute"....adds great flavor. 
*1 TBSP. molasses
*2 tsp.+ of fresh ground black pepper.

I doubled spices, per the comments, but it didn't need it. I also added an entire 10oz frozen block of spinach leaves at the end and loved it. Will make again. Very tasty.

Delicious!  I have made this soup a few times and it is delicious and satisfying.
I made some similar additions to others:
1/8 tsp red pepper
3 T Port
Frozen chopped spinach
14 oz can of Chopped tomatoes
2 T of APPLE cider vinegar, instead of plain
Homemade chicken broth
Summer sausage cut up very finely
3 drops of liquid smoke

Great recipe! I didn't have carrots so I used extra celery instead. I also used stock instead of water, skipped the spinach, and added some cumin and coriander.

I used this recipe as my basic format but added other ingredients I like that I saw in other lentil soup recipes on Allrecipes.  Specifically, I added 1 pound of mild Italian sausage, basil, thyme, fennel seed, red pepper, and substituted homemade beef bone broth for the water.  It was delicious.

YUM!  I followed others' suggestions and added red pepper flakes, cumin and curry.  Oh and an extra carrot.  I also added the entire 28 ounces of the crushed tomatoes instead of just half the can.  I used low sodium chicken stock instead of water.  Really easy and delicious.  Good balsamic vinegar a plus!

I made this soup but made some changes.  I am happy I used a veggie stock rather then water.  (I took a course with a chef and his mantra was....why do we not use water ... because it has no flavour....he was right...use whatever you have on hand...but not bland water)    I also upped the basil and oregano a bit  and added some extra garlic...loving it.....a great foundation recipe for those of us who will change it to our own tastes...

Almost perfect. I would lower the water by a cup or two to make it thicker as it came out thinner than I like my lentil soup.

You really need to add a lot of other spices to salvage this recipe! And it ends up not actually being the recipe. It’s strange. Definitely don’t put 8 cups of water in. I put 4 cups of vegetable stock and 4 cups of water and it was still extremely bland.

I can only give this recipe three stars because it was ok, wasn't terrible, but I had to add so much to it to give it flavor. It is very bland as is. I was puzzled at the use of water and not broth. It really needs broth. So I tried it as-is first, then i had to doctor it. If I list what my additions were, it would no longer resemble the original recipe. So, with my revisions, I give it 5 stars.

Incredibly bland. Needed way too much salt and pepper to even make it marginally worth my time. I added in an extra clove of garlic, doubled the oregano, and added tablespoon each of cayenne, paprika, and cumin. 

If I were to make it again, I would also double the tomatoes and use less water. 

Giving 2 stars only because I got to use a new ingredient in my cooking.

I made this soup on a dreary winter day,    It was good but I don’t see what people are raving about. Adding the vinegar  made it too tart.     what is the purpose of vinegar??.    I never saw a recipe that calls for vinegar and was just wondering?.

This was delicious. I added a ham hock while cooking for more flavor and about 5 links of  sausage, removed the skins and sautéed until real small crumbled pieces remained. Really delicious.  Also sprinkled feta on top before serving.

Great soup if you make some changes! 
-Way too bland with just water, sub out broth! I used a creamy vegan protein broth I had on hand and it really helped the texture; but any broth will do, really. 
-Added a whole packet  of Goya Sazon (the red kind for beans and stews.)
-Great that you can add or sub any veggies, I had carrots but added zucchini and spinach and it was good. 
-At the end of cooking, I added some parmesan cheese (also great for seasoning because it's pretty salty), a splash of water to loosen it up, and a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten.

Solid recipe. The soup tasted much more flavorful the next day. I had a bowl of it right off the stove, and it was good, but had some the next day and it was so much better. A bit of time really brings the flavors out on this one.

Made this today for my Dad who's recovering from Pancreatitis.  I don't normally eat any bean soups.  But, it has plant protein and all goodies to heal the body.
It was VERY good!  I added 2 parsnips and increased to 2 bay leaves.  I sauteed the veggies and then put it in a crockpot for the day.  at dinner time I took some out & pureed it as another suggested.  Phenomenal, healthy & easy.

Upon looking at this recipe, I knew it would be watery and flavorless, so I looked at the reviews to see if somebody had improvised on it.  Sure enough, someone had overhauled it, and that gave me to make more modifications: 6C of homemade, heavily collagenated beef stock (w/ mirepoix), 1C of Pacific Nautural Foods Ginger-Carrot Cashew Bisque, and 1C water for the liquid. 1/2 in of ginger.  4 C of spinach. 1/2 t of crushed red pepper flakes. 1/2 lb. of smoked sausage.  3 red potatoes. Puree 2/3 of a blender workbowl's volume to thicken.  Now I have outstanding soup.

I love the flavor of this lentil soup.  Made it twice and the second time I made some necessary corrections.  It was too thick with lentils and had little or no flavor.  So, the 2nd time, I reduced the beans to 1 1/2 cups, increased the vegetables to 5 large carrots, 5 celery stalks and the tomato sauce had added salt.  I also used about 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar. It was much improved.

Oh this is such a hearty wonderful soup served with a French Baguette ...I also added some grass fed beef hamburg and used organic beef broth instead of water....Yummy will make again and again.  Very satisfying on a winter night.

I wondered if cooking it for an hour as the recipe states would be too long. Yep. Way too long. Everything was mush. I also liked it much better before adding vinegar. Overall, I really didn't like it.

This was just so easy to make!!!  The reason I give it 4 out of 5 is that it is a little bland.  We took some fellow reviewers advice and added a touch of salt and balsamic vinegar.  Surprisingly, pretty great.  So easy to make and it's enough for our family of 5.

I had some leftover cooked lentils, so I made the recipe with only two cups of water added to the first set of ingredients and then simmered it for an hour, per instructions.

Then I added my lentils, spinach, vinegar and salt and pepper.  It was super flavorful and hearty! I could have added more water ( a total of four cups would have worked) which would have made it more soup-like, whereas mine came out more stew-like.  But we loved it!

Yum, this soup is awesome. I’ve never tried lentils before but wanted to try and I’m glad I went with this recipe! I took the advice of others and added 4 carrots instead of 2 and doubled the spices. For the liquid, I used 28oz of crushed tomatoes, and 1L of chicken broth, then added 2 cups of water to get it to the consistency at the end. I used frozen spinach instead of fresh. Will definitely make again!

I’ve made this at least a dozen times now and it was one of my biggest cravings when I was pregnant with my daughter! I follow a lot of the reviewers suggestions by doubling the spices in addition to using half broth and half water. It’s easy to freeze and reheat - the whole family loves it. 5 stars!

As a Hungarian, I have made lentil soup for the New Year as tradition for several years now. This recipe is a slight variation of what I usually cook. I liked the tomatoes, although I used diced tomatoes because thats what I had on hand. I also added smoked sausage and some ham I had left over. Everybody loved the dish!

I made some adjustments based off what I had avialble at home: replaced carrots with mushrooms, doubled the celery, used 2 cans of crushed tomatoes, and 6 cups water.  Soup was kind of bland, next times will plan to double all seasonings.

This soup was good and will make again, but it wasn’t a 5 star soup.  I did like the vinegar added to the soup  but my husband  did not care for it.  I will say that this soup smelled sooooo good while cooking.  I made in the crock pot.

I thought the recipe was a bit flavorless, so we added Hunts tomato sauce (with basil, oregano and garlic) and a bit more pepper. My family loved it!

Prepared and served the 1st time tonight. Used balsamic vinegar - thanks for that advice!  Spinach was put in the bottom of the bowl and only slightly wilted.  Never add it ahead.  Trick I learned when cooking for a huge group at church.  Little Himalayan salt and Mrs Dash as my husband is on dialysis now.  He loves it.

I loved it. I just didn't add certain ingredients and instead of tomato paste I put my spaghetti sauce with pato sauce to give it a bit of a kick.

I love this recipe!!! This recipe is perfect, as it is really user friendly. If your soup didn’t turn out right, it’s the chef, not the recipe. Just a suggestion but I cooked my soup on low for 4 hours to really blend the flavors. I am trying to sharpen my skills in the kitchen. I’m new to making soups from scratch. They taste so much better homemade. If you like more bold flavors in your seasoning or add different spices increase little by little to what you like!!! I added 3 tablespoons of the balsamic vinegar like others suggested. Both my mother and husband freaked out because I was adding the balsamic vinegar. They both recanted their opinion after tasting the soup and said they couldn’t tasted. They both were in agreement this is one of the best soups I’ve made, SO ADD IT!!! I also substituted turkey broth for the water which is a more flavorful broth. I added a fresh sprig of rosemary and thyme. I added a cup more spinach, lentils and potatoes. Just because I like more hearty type soups and need more protein and iron added to each meal I eat for medical reasons.

I doubled everything in the first step, the vegetables and spices, kept everything else the same. I have only used brown lentils. I've made this three times.  It makes a huge poft  of soup that could easily  feed eight people or more.  We eat this soup a lot and it has definitely helped us to manage our  weight.

I love this recipe. It is my goto recipe for lentil soup and a family favorite. The only variations that I have done is used fresh tomatoes and kale in place of the spinach. Even so, it is a hit every time.

This is a good base recipe.  I found if I added some chilies or a little hot sauce that the whole flavor of the soup perked up. Also I added some beef stock that was good.  But, chicken stock would also have been good.  I added a link of Beef Smoked sausage to make a hearty soup.

Great taste. I didn't add the tomatoes because I didn't have them on hand. I modified it a little by adding a bit of curry powder. Overall it had a wonderful taste. Will definately make again and again!!!

Meh. Pretty bland. I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper at the end. Ended up adding some merlot while still cooking and then when it was all said and done, added some balsamic vinegar at the very end as I put it into my bowl. It's not bad, but needs better deeper flavor. Next time I would add some red wine earlier in the process to deepen the flavors and perhaps a parmesan cheese rind to add a deeper salt flavor.

This was my first time making and eating lentil soup. It was great. I only did use a tbs. of vinegar because I didn’t get why you’d need it so you couldn’t taste it. I used Italian herb seasoning.  And I also added a chicken and a beef bouillon cube. I also did 1/2 the amount and it was enough for dinner for two and to freeze the rest. Very good!  Will make again.

This was my first time cooking lentils, and this recipe turned out great. It only took about 10 minutes of prep, then an hour on the stove. The texture was more of a thick chili, which I liked, so if you want it more like soup just add more water or a little less lentils.

I doubled the spices, used balsamic vinegar instead of white, added another carrot and celery stalk and put quite a bit more than 1/2 c of spinach. Also, I substituted 2 c of the water with veg broth and added some rice. It was addictive!!

I absolutely loved this and so did my husband.  Like everybody else though, I did a few things differently.  I started with a ham bone that had been in my freezer.  Cooked that in water with a carrot, onion, celery and a bay leaf for a few hours.  Threw all but the broth out, picked out about a cup of little bites of ham to throw in and proceeded with the recipe.    I only had 1/2  a bag of lentils but added them, the spices, garlic, the large size can of crushed tomatoes, diced carrots and celery and simmered until vegetables were soft.  I threw in a big handful of fresh baby spinach and two Tablespoons of red wine vinegar.  Delicious!  Can't wait to make it again.

Not a big lentil fan, but this was pretty good. As others suggested, I added 1 teaspoon each of curry and cumin. Rest of family wasn't crazy about it, but my wife and son got the crazy idea to mix sour cream into their bowl, and THEN they liked it.

I like this as a base recipe but I thought it was a little bland.  So I went out and found another, more flavorful version.  I added cumin, tumeric, paprika, and a bay leaf.

I found it to be a little bland. I understand now while a reviewer suggested doubling the spices. I’ll be adding significantly more. 

Next time I’m going to add 4-5 sausages and use beef broth for more flavor.

I have never eaten lentils until last night. I used 58oz of Swanson low sodium chicken broth and 6oz of water. I did not use any bay leaves. Only oregano I had was Mexican style so I rolled with it. I doubled my carrots and celery & added a ham bone with some meat I had in the freezer. My lentils came with a garlic and herb pack that I sprinkled a teaspoon or two in. Other than that I kind of followed the recipe. It was AMAZING!! Will be making this again. This is all that was left of my soup!

Noting the suggestions of others and personal preference, I used red lentils only, half water and half chicken stock. I did not have basil so used 2 tablespoons pesto that I had made from summer's herb harvest (oil, parmesan cheese, fresh basil and walnuts). No spinach on hand but did add 3 potatoes cubed, which added body, making up for the plain tomato sauce I used instead of stewed or crushed tomatoes. Increased bay leaves by 2 and used balsamic vinegar.  Excellent. Smokey flavor. Went back for several helpings.

A good solid, healthy, simple soup.  I doubled the spices, used 1-1/2 onions,  vegetable broth instead of water,  a 28 oz. can of tomatoes, and a glug of red wine. Have made it twice now and will make it again.  I’m happy to have some in the freezer now - a treat for a cold winter day.  Thanks for the recipe, Marie.

It was good. I took other suggestions and doubled all of the veggies and spices. I also added 2 chicken bouillon cubes and about 2 more cups of water as it simmered. The next time I make it, I plan on frying some sausage in a skillet and adding it to the soup. I think this would really enhance the flavor!

Absolutely wonderful base for a delicious lentil soup. I followed the recipe exactly (I didn’t have crushed tomatoes so I used 8 oz. tomato sauce) but it lacked flavor. I added more aromatic spices, thyme, rosemary, and a dash of smoked paprika. I also added more pepper and some Adobo. The taste was phenomenal.  A very delicious non-meat meal.

This is a very hearty and healthy lentil soup.  I halved the oregano and basil adding 1/2 tsp each.  That is more to my family's taste.  Also, I used 1 1/2 cups of  baby spinach at the end  of cooking time.  

I will be making it again as we really enjoyed it.

This was delicious!  I added a scotch bonnet pepper for a bit of kick :). It was the perfect warm heaty dish for a relaxed evening!  I did make corn bread as recommended. That was a great add on

This worked so well. I added half a cup more lentils so it was chunkier and 3oz pancetta. It was totally my new favorite soup.

Yes,I used half CHICKEN broth and half water. I also added some sliced Sausage,quick pan fried, and a bit of escarole along with the spinach. When we serve it we drizzle a little olive oil, sometimes more vinegar, over our portion of soup. To my family, this is LOVE. DON'T  forget the crusty bread for dipping!

Decent flavour. Vegetarian hubby and toddlers liked it well enough. But I found it a little flat even after making the flavour changes suggested by a few other reviewers. I may make it again because it is so healthy, but it wasn't a huge winner.

Super easy recipe! I made it in the instapot with the sauté setting and then slow cooked for 4-6 hours. I added some chicken bouillon for more flavor. And because my men prefer to be carnivores, I added chicken and bacon crumbles. I feel like it made it so much better! More body and flavor!!

I loved this soup. The only thing i did different was add 2 cups of spinach because it cooks down so much, and I added 4 cups of water and 4 cups of vegetable broth. Thanks for this very healthy delicious receipe

This soup is delicious, so easy to make and very economical! The only changes I made were using balsamic vinegar, a little less than double the spices, and a very small can of crushed tomatoes. Instead of 8 cups of water I used 7 cups of water plus 1 cup of low sodium broth(any kind). Sometimes for lunch I add a little chopped up chicken or a sprinkle of . cheese on top I eat it all the time and never tire of it., There are so many things you can add after it’s already made, sometimes I throw in chopped potatoes, it freezes well too. I highly recommend trying it.

Added carrots, potatoes, spinach, sausage, and lemon. It’s very good. My husband and i thought it tasted very much like “texas stew”; could have been the changes we made. Very tasty though.

I will make it again.  I added lemon juice and a little tobacco sauce.  This would be really good with some ham as well.  I was very pleased with it.  Next time supplement some of the water for bone chicken broth.

Absolutely delicious! I added a little chicken bouillon in place of salt to give it some added flavor. I also added fresh cilantro and basil at the end just because I had some and it was yummy. We ate it with baked wheat goldfish.

I like the recipe.  I didn't have any carrots or Garlic cloves,  so I substituted wild rice and garlic powder.  I also added ground beef and one finely diced, dried red pepper, and about 2 T beef bullion. My kids despise lentils, and they had bowls.

For what it is--a healthy, low-fat, low-calorie, water-based soup--this Lentil Soup recipe is excellent. I didn't rate it five stars because the taste isn't rich or spectacular, but for a water-based soup, this recipe deserves some praise. I prepared it as written, but as others have noted, there is plenty of room to tinker for particular preferences. I plan to garnish my next bowl with some Parmesan cheese, as other reviewers have suggested.

I made this soup today because it was rainy and chilly here in NYC  (and it's June).  It came out very well, but  it needs more salt (and I'm one who rarely uses salt, even for cooking.)  Even after adding the full can of tomatoes, it was still bland - but flavorful.  So instead of salt, I added in some low-sodium boullion powder in ratio to the 8 cups of water, and it came out wonderful.  The only other minor changes I made was to add 2tsp of ground turmeric (so good for you, plus adds nice color), and I tossed in a handful of dried whole wheat orzo pasta (or you can use 1/4 C of any tiny pasta) in the last 1/2 hour of cooking.  It gave an already great soup even more texture plus  fiber!  
This soup was good as-is, but can also be a great base for any number of healthy and and creative add-ins.

GREAT base recipe. Also fantastic base for “Garbage Soup,” which is soup you can throw anything in which needs to get used up quickly. Definitely use Balsamic at the end, not just plain white vinegar (gross). And you can sub any hearty greens for spinach. Mustard greens, arugula, lambs quarters, etc.

This is  one of the best lentil recipes I've tried. I followed the directions, but instead, I added balsamic vinegar and some chipotle sauce to add a little kick. I also added some vegetarian crumbles (ground beef substitute) for an added meat-like texture. It was excellent!

Zero taste. This is flavored water. I definitely added my mixed bag of seasonings to resuscitate this recipe. Otherwise NO ONE in my family would finish a single bowl. Extremely bland recipe.

This is an awesome lentil soup to start with. I used vegetable broth instead of water, 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, twice the number of carrots and celery.  I like using red lentils because it it creamier. I add a little miso paste to each bowl.

Yummy. My eye caught a few reviews that suggested doubling the spices. So, I did - right at the start. I won’t lie, most of the way through simmering I tasted it and found it very bland. So, I followed the advice of others, and added some cumin and some red pepper flakes. Even then I wasn’t impressed. But, I wasn’t about to give up - and I’m glad I didn’t. Per the recipe, at the end I added the spinach and vinegar. I think the vinegar made ALL the difference and brought out the flavor. Next time I will just stick to the original recipe and wait until the end before I add anything else. It was delicious this way - but, I suspect the original recipe is just as good. A keeper for sure. *I will, however, use veggie broth instead of water. I don’t think you can go wrong there.

Followed others' suggestions and added 2 carrots, 2 potatoes, doubled all spices, added red pepper flakes, added smoked turkey sausage, substituted lemon juice for the vinegar and added 3 tablespoons red wine. Excellent flavor. My whole family loved it.

Never tried lentils before... this recipe was super easy. I added some smoked paprika and used broth instead of water which I think helped a lot. Overall it was ok but I don’t think lentils are for me :p

Read a few 5 star reviews...most of them tweaked the recipe quite a bit and still gave this 5 stars.   Very important to note...If you cook lentils with tomato sauce the lentils will never get soft!  If you want to add the tomato sauce to this add them AFTER the lentils are as soft as you would like them.

I thickened it by adding cubed, peeled potatoes. Found it to be a little too peppery so I added a little lemon juice. I ‘ll just adjust the spices next time. But , overall, it’s a great recipe for vegans!

I've made this soup before but never got the lentils to the best softness. This time, I brought the water to a boil, added the lentils with half of the chopped onion, 3 cloves of garlic and salt; simmered at a low boil for 25 minutes then removed it from the heat, covered, for an hour. I microwaved the carrots then sauteed them with the other half of the onion and 2 more cloves of garlic. I brought it all back to just below a boil to heat it back up to meld in the spices and spinach and vinegar (latter two added the last 10 minutes). The lentils are perfect and the soup smells REALLY good!

Basic recipe was good starter.  I changed things up and  added a bag of frozen corn, peas, carrots and green beans.  Also doubled the onion, and used 32 oz of chicken stock/32 oz water  and heavy cream.

Delicious. I might cut back the lentils to a cup and a half because my soup is thick, and not "soupy" - but it has great flavor.

I  made this, and it's phenomenal! I did add more of each spice, and added chunks of raw Italian Sausage that cooked in the broth. My hubby even loved it. The freshly grated parmesan really made it so flavorful!

This was good.  I realised that I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes instead.  I cut back on the  water because I used canned lentils which are already soft.  That makes the soup much quicker to make.

Great - if you use all the balsamic vinegar, and then some. And I added about 1 tsp of salt. Also added 2 more cups water as it was too thick.

Made this soup in January and it is excellent.  Added extra spinach, used chicken stock for water and added some sausage.  Served this with warm cornbread (also from this site) and dinner was a hit.  I will make this again and thanks for sharing.

I made it a little different  because I already had lentils cooked ao instead of the 8 cups of water I added 3-4 cups veggie bouillon  cubes dissolved in hot water. I also added 1/2 large sweet potato  and brought to a boil.  Flavor was delicious esp. with the 2 tablespoons of vinegar It cut the simmer time to 30 minutes. Added to my menu!

Wonderful recipe. First time cooking and tasting lentils and I love it. I made a few changes though; added dried split peas, used 21/2 packs of chicken broth so I didn’t need to add salt , didn’t use vinegar at all and crushed tomatoes my self.

Very good soup. I added some shredded pork and red pepper flakes and left out the spinach and vinegar as i didn't have any. Seasoned generously, as some other reviewers have mentioned. I topped with a bit of grated cheese and devoured 2 bowls. Will definitely make again.

I doubled my spices like others and cut back liquid to 6 cups of chicken broth (instead of water). For those not familiar with lentils...I used green. I cooked in my pressure cooker. 20 minutes, high pressure and quick released. At 15 minutes the lentils  were still crunchy. This makes a ton! Might want to cut in half if you are not feeding an army:)

Used chicken broth instead of water & added a lil more garlic and vinegar. The lentils soaked up the soup broth so it wasn’t much of a soup BUT it’s still delicious!!

The final dish turned out well. There are only two of us so I cut the recipe in half. Instead of water I cooked the lentils in chicken broth, and since I didn't have diced tomatoes I used 1/2 can tomato sauce and made sure I put it in with the broth and lentils to allow it to cook long enough to mitigate the canned taste. I didn't have much time so I sautéed the veggies separately while the lentils cooked and then combined them. All in all, it was a good dish and I would definitely make it again.

My family devoured this - with a few changes: instead of water I used chicken broth, I sauteed two chopped up bacon slices with the veggies, used cider vinegar instead of regular, fire roasted crushed tomatoes instead of plain, and added lots more spinach than the recipe calls for.

I love cooking outside the guidelines and sometimes I get rewarded.  I used this as my basic guideline, threw in fragrant herbs in mortar and pestle and crushed it for more flavor.  To make it extra creamy, I took raw cashews, nutritional yeast, lemon zest, salt, and one cup of the cook soup, I blended it and added it back to the soup.  Buy a lot of fresh dill and a bunch on top right as you are serving.  It smells fresh from the garden and the taste is hearty.

Family liked but with alterations and quite a few. Double spices, triple garlic, add red pepper flakes. Instead of water used another can tomatoes and chicken stock. Used 5 carrots but depends on size of them.Added 2 T Merlot- I think I may even add sherry to individual bowls today to see how that tastes. Makes a ton so trying to freeze one container and see if it holds up. First time I did not make original recipe- and then change it the second time-sorry- but felt it needed a few slight modifications. Thanks for a great base healthy recipe

Love this simple recipe as I usually have all ingredients on hand. For a change I soaked the lentils for about 24 hrs. This cut my cooking time way down. Also, I never add the spinach.  For extra flavor you can try adding 1/2 - 1 tsp of cumin. It's a flavorful soup with or without it. Hearty, stick to your ribs kind of soup. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a heaty soup!  I made a few changes after reading multiple reviews.  I increased several ingredients: 4 carrots, 2 bay leaves, 4 tsp minced garlic, and 4 cups of spinach.  I used Balsamic vinegar and 1/2 water, 1/2 chicken broth.  I roughly pureed with my immersion blender to thicken the soup in the end.  I rated it 4 because it was good, but I felt like it lacked something that I can't put my finger on.

I cannot begin to understand how this soup managed to get so many high ratings.  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a very bland, tasteless soup that I now need to adjust so I can eat it.  I really wish I had read some of the reviews before making this, since it looks like very few people made it as written.

Excellent, freeze remainder in Tupperware dishes. Remember to remove from Tupperware dish before microwaving. Even better as left overs.

I cooked this as is. It’s a hearty soup and pairs great with rice however I think using chicken stock could have been a better choice than water because it would’ve tied it all together better than water. I’ll try it the next time and add a few more spices too. I thought it was a bit bland but I’m of Indian descent so we like our food spicy.

I made it and it was delicious! The changes I made included substituting 4 cups of vegetable broth for 4 of the 8 cups of water.  Also. I used a large can of crushed tomatoes with basil.  Some of my family enjoyed this delicious lentil soup. Even better the second day!

I think this recipe is OK. However, I would not add the acidity of the lemon or the vinegar the recipe calls for, because just with the acidity of the crushed tomatoes is enough. I might try adding wine and balsamic vinegar instead as others point out just to try. Also, I think it is good idea to add a bit of Italian parsley which is milder and will not alter the flavor too much. This soup benefits a lot from using broth instead of water. Now, if you are interested Knorr sells tomato bouillon as an alternative for broth. It will add color and also enough salt that you might not need to add more.

This is the best recipe!  Tonight I made it and added  diced smoked turkey, parsnips and zucchini which made almost a stew.  I make this recipe almost weekly and add whatever extra veggies I have that might be good in it.  My husband loves it.  We serve it with a nice slice of homemade sourdough bread.   We both love soup as a meal, especially in winter, so this really hits the spot!

I made this while staying with a friend.  She had the ingredients . . . well, nearly all the ingredients.  I used red lentils and balsamic vinegar,  I substituted a yellow onion (instead of white), a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato paste (instead of one can of crush tomatoes), and chicken stock instead of vegetable stock.  A meaty and substantial soup . . . and healthy to boot!

I cut up and cooked 2 slices of peppered bacon first.  Removed from pan, drained grease. Then added the olive oil and chopped veg, except the garlic. I also diced a red pepper with the other vegetables. When they were slightly softened I added the garlic, oregano, basil and I added about 1/4 tsp coriander. I used vegetable broth, not water and added back the cooked bacon.  We really enjoyed this tasty nourishing soup.

This soup was delicious! I cooked it in an instant pot. I sautéed 1 onion, 3 stalks of celery, green onion,  carrots, and 2 packages turkey sausage for 15 minutes. Towards the end I added 2 bay leaves, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, the basil, oregano, salt and pepper. Then I added the lentils, 4 cups chicken broth and 28 oz can diced tomatoes. I set it on 15 minutes. After that I added some kale.

Because of other comments I doubled the spices and added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes for some heat. I also used 4 cups of broth and 4 cups of water.   It’s yummy and so good with a with a piece of warm crunchy bread.

I am a soup lover and unequivocally state that with this recipe you can make one of the best soups you will ever enjoy. To enhance the flavour, use commercial vegetable or mushroom broth in instead of water.

This is a healthy soup, so I may make it again...I followed reviewers recommendations, which I think made it into a three star soup - it would have been very bland otherwise. As with all recipes on this site, you have to take the ratings with a grain of salt and use your own judgement, but I have no idea how this got so many five star reviews....I really wanted to like it!

I made the recipe exactly as printed, no changes, and I wasn't impressed. It was pretty bland even though I added a lot of salt. Something was missing. Maybe it's all the substitutions others put in the soup that rate it better. As printed, it isn't so good.

I have been making this recipe for years and absolutely love it. The secret ingredient for me is balsamic vinegar. The soup freezes well so I always put some in containers to take for my lunch.

The best lentil soup we've ever had! I make it for everyone since it's so easy to make in bulk and so healthy and tasty! Like many others I use this recipe as a base and add double the spices and veggies and use 6-7 cups of broth (either veggie or chicken) and some bouillon. I use balsamic vinegar and always use more vinegar than called for.  I serve it with French bread when I need a little something extra. Delicious!

This was a very hearty soup and the flavor was a nice departure from normal. I did use balsamic vinegar and broth instead of water. As another reviewer suggested I added potatoes and smoked sausage. Will make again.

It’s a good starter but too plain for me. I read different reviews and added what I liked. Everyone had great ideas. Definitely will make again and try some different recommendations.

Followed this recipe to a “T,” except, like other reviewers, I used Balsamic vinegar.  Well, I did fry up a half pound of Black Forest thick sliced bacon, then chopped it up real good and added it.  That caused me to use bacon grease, rather than olive oil for sautéing the veggies.  Other than that, I only used organic bone broth chicken stock, rather than water.  Except I diced up three or four potatoes, followed by one cup of Silver Queen corn, and added those.  But beyond that, I didn’t change a thing.  Delicious!

I made this the other day and wow was I surprised how good it came out!!  I double the measurements on the baby carrots, celery, basil, oregano & spinach. I used 3 bay leafs. I used a whole garlic bulb and no it wasn't to much. I used 6 cuts water and 4 cups chicken broth. No salt or vinegar.  I left the other measurements alone, onion, lentils, & olive oil. I used one can of stewed tomato with the liquid and I could have used two cans. The only thing I did really different, (and took the healthy out of it), was I used a leftover ham bone with some ham on it and cooked until the bone marrow released, about 1 1/2. I was careful not to stir it too much, as I didn't want the lentils to turn to mush when I added the extra 30 minutes for the cook time. Next time I used the ham bone, will throw the lentils in 30 minutes before it's done. This is now my favorite soup recipe!!

To my surprise, my picky ten year old kid scarfed this down.  I went a little different direction with the seasoning using parsley, sage, rosemary & thyme instead of the oregano, basil, bay combo.  I also added one diced potato, a couple of scoops of chicken bullion, four thick slices of bacon.  I puréed the bacon and a cup or so of the beans at the end to thicken.  I didn’t add a lot of lemon to the pot but add that on when serving as some people in my house don’t care for the acid. Serve with a crusty bread.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe using two different type of lentils. I added 1 cup of nutritional yeast, 1/2 cup bragg's amino liquids instead of salt, and kale instead of spinach. The entire family loved it! Will definitely make again.

Made this exactly as written and this soup is too bland.  I added more spices after realizing it was bland but that still didn't make much of an improvement.   I really wanted to like it.

Even better the next day!
I made it the same as suggested with the following adjustments from some of the reviews I read. 
Reduced oil to 1 tbsp
4 garlic cloves
4 carrots
Tsp of cumin
Tsp of curry powder
4 cups water and 4 cups low sodium veg broth
No spinach as we don’t like cooked spinach and other post said it wasn’t good in the leftovers. 
Forgot to add vinegar or as others suggested balsamic or lemon.

Great recipe! I’ve made it several times. I always use knorr vegetable bouillon - great flavor & it’s less salt-tasting than chicken. Added dried rosemary & oregano too, and instead of spinach, I use a fresh head of cabbage, which I put in a few minutes after the onions & sauté to soften (before adding liquid). All the veggies go in the food processor for me so it is super quick.

Absolutely delicious! I did 4 smaller minced cloves of garlic instead of 2. The next time I make it, I plan on adding crushed red pepper to give it a little kick! Makes plenty of leftovers for me and my husband!

As it reads, this recipe is bland. I even increased the garlic, spices and used half stock/half water. Perhaps it would be better if I increased the other flavours as well as some other reviewers suggested. But then it’s really quite another recipe altogether.

I used chicken broth and water, and a little extra seasoning.    The lentils were perfect - this is the best recipe I've found for lentil soup.   Delicious and will definitely make again.

Added a few different spices to it and no olive oil. Used liquid aminos instead of salt. Was tasty. Made two batches in one week. Will make this again!

I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.
I thickened it with 3 TBSP corn starch.

Happily fed a family of 6 with seconds and then even some leftover.

Delicious! I added butternut squash, and changed the spinach to kale- added it with the broth instead of at the end. And used Balsamic Vinegar. Hearty, healthy, and yummy!

I liked it a whole lot better when I omitted the vinegar and used better than bouillon chicken broth instead of water, added double the recommended spices including two cloves of garlic and three bay leaf.  I used half red and half green lentils because both have a little different nutritional values.  My substitutions or additions made this soup go from a two to four star yummy soup

Pretty good, after reading some reviews.  I did modified it on my first attempt.   Since I'm pregnant, I haven't felt like eating meat proteins and looking for other proteins as a replacement.  I did double the carrots, garlic, and bay leaf.  Add two medium size red potatoes cubed.  I tried the soup without the vinegar before adding it.  I think I prefer without the vinegar.  I will omit it next time around.  I would make it again!

I took the other suggestions and doubled the carrots and spices.  I used chicken broth instead of water, reduced the oil to 2 tablespoons and added smoked turkey sausage.  It was very delicious and filling.  I will definitely make again.

Turned out great and my crew wiped it out, left out  the vinegar and basil, loaded up more on spinach, the flavor began coming to the fore as you simmered longer,  make sure you put enough garlic and season to taste, will be making it again in a few weeks,  not a leftover to be found.   thank you

I loved this soup!!  I made a few changes, but the base was the same.  I cut back on the olive oil & used only a tablespoon, then instead of water I used 4 cups low sodium vegetable broth & 4 cups low sodium chicken broth.  I used 2 cans of  no salt added diced tomatoes as well.  Otherwise, everything else was the same & it was filling & delicious!

Everyone liked the soup, but it was is slightly bland to our tastes. That can be easily remedied with a bit more vinegar and pepper. You may think of other additions to perk up the flavor.

This soup was savory, hardy and my whole family loved it. I eat vegetarian and some of my daughters do as well so I pan fryed a polish sausage for my husband and boys, it went well with the lentils.  I will make this each week this winter! Yum

Very good basic lentil soup . . . I omitted the oregano (I don't care for it), bay leaf and vinegar, and added a bit more basil, double the garlic and extra onion.

This is the best lentil soup! I took some suggestions from some of the reviews and used 2 bay leaves and upped the amount of carrots and spices. The balsamic vinegar really kicks it up a notch. I gave some to my in laws and they are raving about it.

This was very easy and inexpensive to make. I do like it but I feel like there was something missing. I added 1 tbsp of cumin and a couple sprinkles on cayenne pepper and it pretty much did the trick. Not sure I am a fan of the vinegar as it does have an acidic taste to it. Use caution with vinegar.

I was at the cottage when I decided to make this so I had to make some changes based on what was available to me. I swapped the oregano for thyme, left out the celery and spinach, used chicken stock instead of water and added cubes of pea meal bacon during the last 20 minutes of cooking. It was great. I think this is a recipe that won’t fail you, unless maybe you leave out the lentils! Keeping this as one of my staple recipes.

I chose this recipe based on the excellent star rating. I made the recipe precisely to the instructions, and frankly I found it disgusting. First of all, it makes enough soup to feed about 100 people - a gargantuan quantity of soup. It was runny, watery, the tomato component didn't seem to integrate with the water, the lentils were almost disintegrating, and it had no taste. No flavor whatsoever. I was suspicious of this because the recipe calls for no stock, and very minimal seasoning, so of course it has no flavor. Very confused by all the rave reviews. Mine turned out like garbage, which is where it is going.

I replaced the water with chicken broth, doubled the garlic and spices, and used diced tomatoes instead, but it still came out kinda bland. Might have to add more salt or more spices next time, and maybe cook it for longer so the carrots and spinach aren't as tough. Served with garlic croutons, which made it a bit better than by itself.

This came out really well. I used balsamic vinegar as other reviewers suggested, and added a little italian sausage as well. I liked that it has tomatoes init, but isn't a tomato based broth. The balsamic really adds a great flavor.

This was a hit at my house! Only thing I changed was omitted the diced tomatoes because I didn't have any on hand and added cumin, extra garlic, and moose sausage. Definitely adding this recipe to my regular meal plan list.

Only made once and it was a hit. I used a hand mixer in the soup a short while to make the soup a more creamy texture but still have chonks. I will definitely make more of it.

I forgot the vinegar, but I'm not sure it would have made a difference in the flavor.  This soup was pretty bland.  It also didn't have enough vegetables.  If I were to make this again (and, I probably will because it is easy), I would double the celery, garlic, oregano, and basil.  I would also substitute 2 cups of vegetable broth for 2 cups of water.  That way, I wouldn't have to add a lot of salt.
That said, I tried to figure out calories because I am logging my meals, and the best estimate I have is a serving size of 2 cups at 198 calories.

I made this soup according to the recipe, and it was good.  Next time, I will add jalapeno, or another type of pepper to give it a spicy kick and make it great.

So I decided to make this because of the rating. I was not disappointed. My family loved it. I usually am hesitant about lentil soups but this one was by far my favorite. I did add better then bouillon, the vegan vegetable base one and substituted petite diced tomatoes instead of the crushed tomatoes. Like I said I loved it and would do it again in a heart beat!

Made it with some of the suggestions recommend in reviews. I used stock instead of water, less oil and doubled the herbs. Huge, huge hit! The kids love it, hubby wants it every week now. Excellent recipe.

This was yummy. It froze well, and I think I liked it even more after I defrosted it than when it was freshly made! The vegetables weren't mushy and tasted great, and the soup felt both hearty and light at the same time --- it was filling without feeling heavy.

The overall recipe was very bland. I stepped it up a bit by adding 4 cups of broth, and I also doubled the spices. In my opinion if you like blander dishes you definitely should go with this one. If you prefer a more flavorful dish I would recommend my method.

This is really healthy and tasty!  I love the touch of vinegar to add some acidity.  I only cooked the soup for 30-40 minutes because I don't like my lentils mushy.

An excellent recipe! I made a few adjustments. I used half French Green Lentils and half Black Beluga lentils from Timeless Natural Foods. I doubled the spices, used only a tablespoon of olive oil, used 2 cups of vegetable broth along with 6 cups of water. I seasoned with sea salt at the end and next time would probably use only 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar (but that is just a matter of taste). Overall, an outstanding soup!

this is my second time doing this recipe, it’s my favorite soup for when it’s super cold, someone is sick, or i’m just simply craving lentil soup!! i do add some stuff to mine, such as 1-2 med sized potatoes, throw in a bit of broccoli, and sometimes i’ll just add whatever canned veggies i have that might go well with it. both times were GREAT. will do again

Pretty tasty.  I made it just as the recipe asked.  My husband and kids liked it (except for my pickiest kiddo).  One kid took it for lunch to school and my husband asked for it to be in our regular rotation.

Loved this Soup.  I used shredded carrots and used 5 garlic cloves as well as 5 fresh Roma tomatoes.  Also served on an additional handful of spinach in each bowl.  Even my picky 16 year old ate it up!

Really liked the recipes. The spinach and vinegar are a nice twist on what I'm used to. I would definitely recommend using chicken or vegetable stock instead of just water. I also added 10 cups of stock instead of 8. I will make it again

A basic lentil soup. BUT, I changed the water to chicken broth, switched plain for a can of fire roasted, garlic flavored, "diced" tomatoes, doubled carrots, celery and herbs and added 2 chopped mini zucchini's!

I tried this recipe for the first time and followed it exactly as stated, although I didn't measure much like you would for baking. I used my eyes. I gave it to my husband to take to work and he absolutely loves it. He's not one for lentils. This recipe is now my favorite go-to.

Great recipe and filling.  I added a lot more  veggies and more spices...sometimes put in other spices like curry or cajun spice just to change the flavor a bit (I cook a big batch for dinner then put it in little Pyrex bowels to take to work so eat it a lot)

Loved the recipe, tweaked things bit, made it a bit more Mexican. I added two tablespoons of caldo de tomate con pollo seasoning, a bunch of cilantro finely chopped and red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  Probably will add some thinly sliced hotdogs or sausages to make it a meaty soup.

Very good basic recipe to modify to your taste!

I reduced the oil to ~2tbs, tripled the spices,  added 1 tbs of cumin, used potato instead of celery (which I'm not a fan of!), added a bouillon cube to my water (I recommend using stock) and added a bit of adobo/creole seasoning.

I have to say this was the best recipe I've made in 43 years of being married and made a lot of lentil soup in my day......my son in law is not a big soup eater but loved this recipe and my husband is my biggest critic and loved it, the substitutions I made were using chicken stock in stead of water and I had a ham bone from Easter ham and used that with other ingredients.  Delicious! would always make my lentil soup this way!!!!

Made this soup because the recipe looked simple enough even for me. Made it exactly according to recipe. The soup was thoroughly cooked in just over 30 minutes. One hour and it would have been mush. If I try again, I will substitute chicken stock for at least part of the water and probably forego the vinegar. The slightly astrigent taste just isn't my thing.

This so good and easy. I had lots of produce that needed to get used and this was the perfect soup to use all of it before it went bad. I made some changes because I didn't have all ingredients on hand. I used basil, parsley, thyme, and rosemary as the spices because I did not have bay leaves or oregano. I used half of a large, diced tomato instead of canned tomatoes. Then I used half beef broth, half water. I finished it with balsamic vinegar and vinegar pepper sauce. So tasty!

I followed other people's suggestions and doubled the crushed tomatoes and used chicken broth instead of water.

I also made this in the pressure cooker (Instant Pot) set to cook for 4 minutes.

This would also be good with a dried thai chill tossed in to spice it up.

Rated 4 stars because it’s a good base recipe, but, I don’t think it would have tasted like much without changes. I doubled the veggies , garlic, and spices called for, added a teaspoon of cumin, half teaspoon of crushed red pepper, used vegetable stock instead of water, and balsamic vinegar. Turned out great and will definitely make again!

I did make the changes suggested by just about everybody else!  I doubled the carrots, garlic and spinach and added chili flakes.  I also used half water and half broth.  My husband thought it could have used more liquid though, and he suggested corn too.  Next time I'll use red lentils  and maybe add smoked sausage.  Actually you can doctor this as much as you'd like and it would be delicious!  I found it makes 8 servings easily.

Excellent, very tasty soup.  The only change I made was to use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, and unfortunately I  didn't have any spinach on hand.  But excellent and hearty on these cold days!

TRIED TO FOLLOW RECIPE EXACTLY and this was just such a miss. Sometimes these reviews go on all sorts of changes made to a recipe and I just don't know about that. I tried it as is and perhaps it was cooks error but it was just a no for us.

Great dish!!!  My family loved it.  I used Miso Soup Broth and water.  It gave the lentil soup a wonderful favor.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!!!!

I've made and had plenty of lentil soups in the past, but this is by far my favorite! The little hint of vinegar gives a nice kick. It's great as is, but I also like to add mushrooms, 1/2 a cubed kielbasa and replace water with chicken broth.

I made a few changes to the soup. I added a few more carrots, used a can of crushed tomato puree (husband doesn't like the large chunks of tomatoes), added an additional bay leaf, and added some chicken into the pot about halfway thought the "simmer" cycle. As a weight watchers member, this soup was PERFECT. I really enjoyed the flavors of the soup, and my husband even had a second helping! I am calling it a win.

It was good, but it could have used more flavor behind it. If I make it again, I’ll add a little spice to it to help it along.

I have to agree that following the recipe as written, this soup is bland.  I should have read the reviews before I made and I would have substituted veggie or chicken broth and I don't that would have made a big difference.  I added some cumin and that has helped.  Am giving a 2 because it has potential but only with modifications.  Would not make again as is.

Awesome recipe. Very easy and I will make it again. I modified as follows:
double garlic, carrots, celery, crushed tomato
sauté crushed garlic first (2-3 min, almost golden), then add onion/carrots/celery
half low sodium chicken broth substituted for half the water
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper

Everyone loved it! This will be my go to for a hearty healthy soup....I used a bean mix instead of just lentils. I added small frozen meatballs and substituted  8 frozen spinach "cubes" for fresh. I like my beans very soft so if you do, make this early in the day or  even better, the day before. For salt I added beef soup flavouring

This is a very hearty soup, and was my first time making lentils in any capacity.  After reading several reviews and personalizing the recipe to our tastes, I changed a few things.  First, I doubled the recipe, using one bag of red and one bag of brown lentils.  I used 4 cups of vegetable broth and 12 cups of water, instead of 16 cups of water.  I used about a tablespoon each of basil, oregano and cumin (a new addition).  I, too, replaced the vinegar with about 6 T. of fresh lemon juice.  It was very good!

It was just okay. A very healthy option and filling as well. But, even with adding extra cumin, garam masala, garlic, and curry it still seemed to be lacking a depth of flavor.

I made this a few times. My tweak is I use low sodium vegetable broth instead of water. Just a comment, I think most "original" lentil soup recipes are without meat. It is an excellent meal for those that observe  the season of Lent being meatless.

This was really good.  Went with  other  reviews and added more spices and garlic.  Used 4 T of broth base in the water, (might use less next time was a little salty)  Added a little sweet Italian sausage. Would make again.

average soup.  I doubled the carrots, garlic, oregano, bay leaf, basil and tomatoes.  i used chicken broth in place of water.  I had leftover bacon/brussel sprouts from the night before so I threw that in as well.  I also used more spinach.   I used balsamic vinegar.  Note:  I tasted the soup before and after I added the balsamic vinegar and I actually preferred it without the addition of the vinegar

This recipe is forgiving.  throw in what you want to use up.  nice because I typically have everything on hand but there's nothing extraordinary about it.

My family enjoyed this. One suggestion is to use celery salt rather than just plain salt.

The recipe as it stands is very good - I however made a small change - I didn’t have the 14oz can of crushed tomatoes But I did have two 10 oz cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies- it added some great zip to a really good recipe.  I’ll be making it again soon.

I had to make some changes to this and when I did - it was great. I used veggie broth instead of water. Used an entire 24.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes instead of crushed. I also added fresh basil instead of dried. I kept the vinegar and also added about 1/4c. red wine. I was out of carrots, so used zucchini instead. I also doubled the garlic. So yes, great starting point - but needed a few tweaks. I honestly can't imagine making this with just water, it would be so bland.

This is really a good soup.  I've made it loads of time.  Start with the basic recipe and add tidbits here and there, sausage, ham, curry, coconut milk in place of some of the water, fresh parsley, wine in place of vinegar, cumin, 
Great basic lentil soup recipe, take it where you want it to go.  Today I added a few left over sausage, about 1/2 cup of chopped fresh parsley, 1/3 cup in place of vinegar and served over roasted sweet potatoes.

I've made this several times, now, and it really is a favorite soup of ours.  I follow the recipe as written and have used both fresh spinach and frozen chopped spinach.  Today I made it in my Instant Pot...15 minutes cooking time!  Served it with some naan.  Delish!

Very dull.   My daughter is vegetarian, so I'm always trying new recipes for her.   We both took a bite of this and said, well....we won't be making this one again.   It's lacking in so many areas, I don't know where to begin.   Maybe if it had been done with some kind of broth instead of just plain water it would have more of a soup base to start with.      Rather that try and doctor this up, I'll just look for something better.

This was OK, but made as written is extremely bland.  Based on the suggestion of another reviewer, I used fresh lemon juice instead of vinegar.  It was still bland, so I added about 3x the suggested amount of spices.   I added a bunch of sea salt and some chili powder to give it some taste.  I will try curry powder if I make it again.

Excellent!  Listened to the suggestions...added balsamic vinegar 2tbsp instead of plain white,  4 carrots, 4 ribs celery, heaping tsp of each spice and 2 bay leaves. .  I found 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp celery salt and a lite tsp pepper worked perfect.  Use the 28oz crushed tomatoes. If don’t want bread consider a tbsp of sour cream as serving.  Great soup!!

Oh man! I think this could be the best stew I've ever made! I doubled up the spices, added some adobo & a chicken bullion cube. The first day it's pretty "alright", but by the 2nd day it's amazing - just stir a little sour cream in & this stew can't be beat.

I added red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit (in individual bowl) so the kids could still eat it. And added a bit extra salt. I think next time, I'd add vegetable broth and water mixed instead of all water.

This was a big hit for my family with no guilt! I added a teaspoon of ground cumin and more garlic powder in addition to the fresh garlic. I also doubled up on all the veggies!Then served w some steamed white rice or the choice of some quinoa made aside. So good and healthy!!!!

Absolutely the BEST lentil soup I have ever had!  I followed the recipe except used 8 cups of organic vegetable stock in place of water.   No other changes.  My 3 year old son and my husband both raved about it as well.  Excellent soup!  Will make this a part of our regular rotation!

Awesome recipe! This is the first home-made soup I've made and it turned out great. The few things I changed in the recipe that I got from other comments on here was doubled the spices, added more carrots and celery, added half (4 cups) water and half (4 cups) vegetable broth, and doubled the tomatoes. Also let the soup sit warm on the stove for an extra hour to let the flavors blend. Delicious!

I've been making this recipe for about 5 years and it has always been a staple in my fitness journey because it's filling, delicious, and healthy.

The first few years of making it, I didn't do any substitutions or additions (other than double the garlic just because I love garlic). 

Today I made a small addition - added "not chicken" vegetarian bullion and a couple tbsp of parmesan cheese after seeing these recommendations. Those two additions took this over the top! The only vinegar I had was red wine vinegar and it worked fine. 

FYI, if you're the only one who eats this in the house, note that towards the end of the week the spinach will be a bit slimy. I don't personally mind, but if you think that would bother you then just add spinach to a small bit at a time through the week. 

I plan on making this recipe for the rest of my life!

Doubled the veggies and crushed tomatoes because my crushed tomatoes are in 24 oz cans.  Used whole bag of lentils.  I also added 1 lb. diced smoked sausage and I skipped the vinegar as it seemed unnecessary.  My God is it good!

The only change I made was adding a mild italian sausage. The soup was amazing! My husband and 3 little ones loved it!  I just made it 2 days ago and I am going to make more. Such a yummy filling soup! Thank you so much for the recipe!

It was really thick so I added a bit more water and added heinz tomato juice and it turned out AMAZING. The tomato juice added lots of flavour that it was missing. Next time I will also double the veggies.

Didn't add the tomatoes, which may have contributed to the fact that I did not like it. The ratio of lentil to water was not good. I would put one cup or less of lentils  to eight cups of water.

I have never made lentil soup before . This was so delicious. My  greek husband who does not like  soup and always complains whenever  I make soup actually said that it was really good. 
I used  4 cloves garlic and  extra carrot as recommended and also used canned tomatoes.   I also used chicken broth instead of water.

My adaptations to this recipe include: 3 large carrots, 3 potatoes, 3 bay leaves, 1 Tbs basil, 6 cups chicken broth instead of water, I use the 29 oz can of crushed tomatoes, and a package of diced ham. In the last 30 minutes I remove the bay leaves, add the vinegar then add 4 cups spinach.

This was delicious and easy to make.  I also doubled the carrots and replaced the water with chicken broth.  However, the vegans in our house used water and loved it! Thank you for this recipe :)

Wasn't my favorite, but my wife did like it. To me, the lentils tasted cakey and hard textured, even after repeated re-heat cycles. Perhaps it's the budget lentils used. It wasn't until after the soup was cooked that I read that the lentils should have been soaking from 6 hours to all day. Maybe that would have softened them up. I was half hoping I could duplicate Progresso's lentil Soup, but alas, it was not to be.

After reading the reviews, I made a few changes.  I used some chicken broth for some of the water.  I omitted the oil and just got the first ingredients going in the pot with some of the liquid.
I didn't have any spinach so I used zucchini as one other reviewer had mentioned, and I added kielbasa to use up one I had in the fridge.  It was very tasty and enjoyed by my husband and son.

I've been making this for years. My mother always made lentil soup on New Year's Day. A family tradition! I have to say this recipe is even better than hers used to be.
I actually use  low sodium chicken broth instead of water.
I also brown smoked turkey links and add it to the soup. I also add more garlic.
I freeze containers of this for those days when you need a quick and nutritious meal.

This is a pretty good recipe. I have made this soup 4 or more times and the only things I change are adding quartered baby Bella mushrooms and 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2. I use a large onion and 2 large carrots so if my carrots are smaller I may use 3-4. I think the flavor is mild and the lentils really shine through in it. It also freezes really well.  I will make again most likely several more times.

This recipe proves you can have a hearty, satisfying meal w/o using chicken or any other meat stock.  We used a vegetable stock, did not add the vinegar at the end & the soup was delicious.  Thanks, Marie!

After reading some of the comments, I was a little worried about making this, but I am so glad I made a few suggested adjustments.  Instead of all water I did all vegetable stock and added water over time to thin it out a little.  And I did add just a little more on each spice.  It was so yummy that day and the day after for left overs.

This is a very basic lentil soup recipe. Sometimes it is a nice treat to have a hearty bland meal. This way it can appeal to everyone. Also, it's ideal because if offers a great deal of opportunity to add other spices. My background is Macedonian and lentil soup is a weekly staple. And paprika is the main spice used. So, it is nice to have a recipe, such as this one, to spice up.

as written it's a good starting point but I used veggie bullion more vegetables and spices (2x the onion, celery, carrots and spices 4x the leafy green) and subbed in Kale because it one the grocery store had on sale. I picked up divided trays from Amazon and using my pressure cooker it makes 7- 2 cup servings (I drop a rolls worth of bread dough in the 6 oz compartment and some sort of crunchy snack in the 10 oz compartment (it's been everything from chips to veggie sticks)  and it makes a very  nice nutritious lunch complete with a fresh baked roll)

Really good. I added powdered cumin. Then I added spinach right when I served it, did not cook the spinach. I like the texture that gave it with fresh spinach. I used arugula the next time and that was a nice complement. Also mixed in slices of spicy jalapeño (fresh and canned another day), which was a great addition!

This is a delicious soup. I like things spiced up so I doubled up the spices with the exception of the garlic and dissolved chicken bouillon in the water called  for in the recipe. I will definitely make this soup again.

This is a great, thick, cold-day soup, and easy to modify. Definitely use chicken or vegetable stock instead of plain water, and cut the liquid down by half a cup to make it thicker. I've been adding some chopped cooked bacon about halfway through cooking, and using kale in place of spinach. The kale is heartier and doesn't get slimy the way spinach can; it also freezes better.

Very tasteless if you follow this recipe exactly. Definitely need to modify. It's a good basis, though.

This was very good on a snowy day!  Next time I'll use chicken broth instead of water, to give it a fuller flavor.

Excellent soup!  Followed several others suggestions, doubled spices and garlic.  Used 1 can stewed tomatoes and vegetable stock to make 8 cups (vs water).  The vinegar adds dimension!

This soup had way too much tomato flavor compared to North African lentil soup. I would remove the canned tomato products and add fresh, diced tomatoes next time.

a nice hearty comfort food kind of soup considering my boyfriend is against any veggie dish he enjoyed this! I understand what some people are saying about it being watery but I put mine in a slow cooker for a few hours then left it stand over night and the flavour was amazing! So maybe use some stock instead of all that water if you want it make this a bit quick. If not I highly recommend putting it in a slower cooker :)

Great recipe. I made a few changes as I tend to do:
1. Replaced water with chicken stock
2. Added diced ham (leftovers from a baked ham)
3. Replaced lentils with navy beans (and cooked for 4 hours on high in the slower cooker)

Made the recipe as as I'm highly satisfied but if you wanted a thicker should you could always add more carrots. I think a slash of cabernet would go well in this dish.

I thought this was simple and excellent. I used Vegetable Broth/Stock in place of water.  And added some extra seasoning. Otherwise, I kept to the original recipe and found it delish!

I used this recipe to refresh my memory on ingredients only  because I was making the soup at a relative's home  today and didn't have the recipe I have used for more than 40 yrs.  The recipe here is not a 5-star, but with a few changes, it is.  Keep in mind, lentils cook in about 20 min. You can saute the onions and other veggies in olive oil, but the results are no different if you  put the lentils in a 10-qt. kettle,  cover with 8 cups of water and turn the heat on medium. While the lentils are heating, chop and add the raw veggies. (not the tomatos - add those at the end.) You absolutely have to use two medium-large cloves of garlic. No skimping on garlic. One large carrot is enough (1/3-1/2 cup).  1/2 cup celery is also enough, but a bit more is fine. One reviewer said she doubled the spices. Ugh. Don't do that! One tsp of dried oregano and one tsp of dried basil is plenty. Remember dried herbs are concentrated. If you are using fresh oregano and basil from your garden, then more is okay.  To give the soup a rich flavor, you need to add at least two slices of thick bacon. Just chop the raw bacon and add it to the kettle. Alternatively, you could use chopped ham or kielbasi. Use kielbasi only if you can get it from a Polish butcher. Forget about the fake kielbasi made by Hillshire Farms and others like them.  It is going to take you at least 20 min. to wash, chop and add the onions, celery and carrots and chop bacon or ham.  Now, you can add the tomatoes, but you need two

Love the recipe. Tweaked it to my taste. Instead of water I used equal amounts of vegetable stock. Added a cup of dry white wine. Ginger powder  some dried chilli pepper and cayenne pepper. Also, I ommited the vinegar and it was a hit! Thank you!

This was a great soup, but needed some revisions to suit my family's taste. We doubled the veggies and seasonings, doubled the greens (using a mix of spinach, chard, and kale), used Better than Broth vegetable base instead of water, and added a package of kielbasa for flavor and substance. This made it more like a stew than a soup - fantastic! We cut the kielbasa into bite-sized chunks and sautéed it to brown it. Used some of the broth to deglaze the pan (would have used white wine if we'd had it) and added that goodness to the big pot. Big thumbs up from all family members on Christmas Eve, from kids to grandparents.

This is now one of our go-to soups. It makes enough so that we can portion out almost a week's worth of lunches for two people, and that includes the dinner we make it for. We used veg soup stock instead of water to give it some more flavour and the second time we made it we left out the vinegar as neither of us really liked it.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted ok. It was a little boring, but it smelled great. It took an hour and a halfish. It's not worth the time investment to me, so I don't plan on making this again.

Makes a huge amount of soup and very tasty.   Adding the vinegar at the end did not sound appealing so we omitted it.   The two of us likes the consistency and taste.   Will be keeping it on our recipe lists.

I love that we can read reviews and suggestions before making a recipe here!  Have made this several times everyone loves it.  If you think it's bland try vegetable stock instead of broth or water, add curry powder, cumin and I use herbs de provence.  If you want heartier try turkey sausage - spicy Italian or mild or some of each.  I use a little red pepper as well.   I use lemon juice instead of the vinegar and I blend half so it has a nice creamy texture.  My husband says he could eat this every day.

Made this soup for dinner tonight and it was delicious! I rated the recipe based on a few changes I made as suggested by other raters. I used Chicken Stock instead of water, added a dash of cumin, curry powder, Thyme and garlic powder (in addition to 2 large cloves). I also only used a teaspoon of oil to keep it lower fat and used balsamic vinegar. 
Other than that I made it as the recipe called and it was a big hit in our home. My 4 year old gobbled it up! Will definitely be making it again very soon.

I Lao added 4 carrots, used Balsamic vinegar, added Port.
I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth. It turned out great with a rich thick consistency. To add some kick which I think was missing. I just shake in a few drops of Hot Sauce.

With water, this would have been tasteless. I used chicken broth and omitted the salt. I also added some garlic powder and about half a tsp more oregano and basil. This was very good with the changes!

This soup is my favorite part of Winter. I lived in Barcelona,and Sopa de lentejas was a wonderful meal. I do use chicken broth instead of water. My Dad would always add Butifara from Vic,so if you have meat eaters,you could broil up a sausage and add to it. You can also top with a dollip of sour cream. Before serving I take a cup and a half  of the soup and puree it then add it back to the soup. I have also substituted Chard or Kale for the spinach,both work great.

One of the tastiest soups I have made! I did make some minor changes-- I added black beans to make it a fuller soup and added in some cayenne pepper and nutmeg and eyeballed all the spices since it was based on personal preference. I do agree with previous reviews that the balsamic vinegar addition does make a difference. Overall great recipe that I would make again!

Good stuff! Doubled the spices, added 2 jalapeño and some fresh lemon. I also used organic apple cider vinegar instead on white vinegar - I thought it really lighted up the dish. Can't wait to have the left overs tomorrow-  soups/stews always taste better the next day.

It was good but I will double the spices as well as the carrots &  celery next  time when I make it.  The vinegar ingredient  did not specify type so I used  balsamic which seemed like a good choice.

I have followed the most of BLANKIN's suggestions. Used 4 carrots, 4 garlics, 28 oz. tomatoes, increased the spices by 50% and used some cayenne pepper. I also mixed 2 different types of lentils and used lemon juice from a half of lemon instead of the vinegar. Also added 1.5 oz. of white wine. I was cooking for 1.5 hours and added a couple of crushed potatoes 20 min before the end of cooking. Become really great!

I think it's a great recipe. I did makes some of the same modifications that others did. I substituted chicken stock for water and added a healthy chicken sausage for flavor. I tweaked a few other things but it's a great recipe. I complemented it with homemade corn muffins.

I added more salt and 1-1/2 cups of thin-sliced Spinach. The soup was hearty, filling and really delicious (if you like Lentils, that is!)  I wish I'd had the hot Cornbread to go with the soup; maybe "next time!" ;-)

This is a great solid basic deep savory lentil soup. Easy to amend. Other than a few dashes of red pepper for some pizazz I didn't any other herbs to retain the basic herb palette while cooking. I probably doubled the carrots and celery and I happen to use red lentils. I didn't add vinegar, and used maybe a Tablespoon of oil. I also didn't have spinach so I topped with cilantro, shredded manchego and a dollop of yogurt. Impressively good for lentil soup!

Really amazing soup and I'm loving it  during the fall season. However, I've always adjusted it based on other commentor's suggestions, so totally check out their advice. With this basic recipe and people's additions, it's a delicious, hearty, and nutritious soup!

I increased carrots and herbs/spices to make a larger batch but essentially everything else same. Only had 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes and used entire can plus the total amount of water with chicken bouillon cubes for flavor. Served with deviled eggs, green salad and crusty bread to dunk.

After reading several reviews, I did make the following changes 3 carrots, 3 ribs celery and double the spices.
I used no salt beef broth instead of water and added more during cooking.
When making again, I will add more broth sparingly because my soup was too 
"brothy" for my preference.  

This recipe lends itself well to sodium restricted diets.  

The addition of balsamic vinegar to each bowl is a real enhancer.

I will make again.

I didn't read the reviews until half way through cooking time. I tried the broth and it was bland. Maybe if I would have added the vinegar it would have lifted but I was hungry so I started adding more herbs(2x) and 5 cubes of herb-ox chicken to offset the water. I also added a few kumquat to the mix from my tree. Finally I used Bragg Apple Cider vinegar to finish. I think if I would have known the effect of the vinegar I would have waited on the kumquat and added a little less bullion cubes. The result was a bit more acidic then it might have been by following the recipe. Still good though! I served it with tortilla chips. Yum.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be very bland tasting. One of the potential downfalls of reviews is that people make dramatic changes and then review on their finished product, good or bad. This was not a keeper for me.

Excellent recipe!! I made a few changes based on my tastes and reviews. I added 4 chicken bouillon cubes to the 8 cups of water, tsp of Cajun seasoning, and a 14.5 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes. I also added the salt and pepper while cooking the veggies (I've read added the salt and pepper while cooking is the best for enhancing flavor). I also added about a tsp or so (I always go heavy on it) of garlic salt. I will eat as is but my husband prefers meat in his soup so he adds sausage or chicken. Will be saving this to make again!

I made a ton of changes, and I will make it again, my way. Being an experienced cook of almost 60 years, I knew when I read the list of ingredients, it would be absolutely flavorless.  I doubled the amount of garlic, oregano, bay leaves and basil. I added a teaspoon each of cumin and curry powder. For the 8 cups of water called for, I substituted 4 of the cups with chicken stock. I used 3 tab. of balsimic vinegar. I added way more spinach than the recipe called for. 

Next time I may add some Italian sausage, mild, not hot.

Deeeeelicious! I followed the advice of others, and doubled the oregano and basil and garlic. I didn't have celery on hand, but did have a zucchini which I chopped up and added. I didn't have any canned tomatoes so I diced up 2 cups of fresh ones. I added veg soup bouillon to flavour up the water. I added a whole bunch of spinach and kale and other greens. Probably 4 cups worth? I am eating it now even though it's way to hot... just can't wait! So good!

Absolutely fantastic.  Great base.  Like most people, I made a few alterations to this recipe.  I doubled all the spices, including the garlic.  I also sauteed the garlic with the veggies to release more flavor.  I added a pinch of thyme and a 1/2 tsp of turmeric. I used chicken broth instead of water (veggie would work if vegetarian).  I used kale instead of spinach for the texture, and I also used balsamic instead of white vinegar. Overall, this turned out wonderful.  Very flavorful!  Thank you so much!

Pretty good- thought the broth was missing something though. It tasted too watered down.

Directions said to simmer for one hour. It's been simmering for almost two and a half hours and lentils are still hard!

It was kind of bland.  I listened to several of the reviews and used 1/2 broth 1/2 water instead of just water.  It still had very little flavor.  I doubled the amount of spinach as well.  It was a filling meal and I did freeze leftovers for later, but I probably won't be making this soup again.

Following the recipe exactly yields a high quantity of uber bland, brothless lentil mash my toddler thought was porridge. I'll eat it because it's edible and I spent the time and money on it, but will never make it again. It smelled delicious while cooking but the only flavor was in the bites with tomatoes. I will not make this recipe again.

Future recipes I will use significantly more liquid, and use broth or stock instead of water. Maybe that will add flavor and help the veggies and lentils maintain some attractive consistency. It needs WAY more spices or fresh herbs, and maybe something spicy for a kick of interest.

I doubled the spices, added arrowroot powder to thicken.... and used 4 cups of vegetable broth instead of water. It didn't actually need the thickener. It was perfect!  I only added because of other reviews. I also used cumin (about a tsp).

Delicious.  I did a few things to personalize it, not necessarily to alter it.  I added Kielbasa to bulk it up so that it could be a stand alone meal.  There are so many varieties to choose from.  I used Turkey as it was less fattening.  I almost never use water as my base in soups and stews.  Chicken broth, beef or even vegetable broth will deepen the flavor.  Lastly, as I'm plating it for everyone, I squeeze a lemon wedge over the top.  The lemon just does a little something that makes it extra tasty.

I altered the recipe slightly by omitting carrots for zucchini and bell peppers, adding one chicken breast (at the beginning), and putting in sesame leaves with the spinach. I also added a bit of Pampered Chef garlic pepper toward the end. I don't know what kind of vinegar it calls for, but I used apple cider. Yum.
I didn't give it a 5 because I altered it and added salt. I think it would taste differently otherwise.

This is a great recipe! I made a few changes. I used all chicken broth and also added a ham shank for flavor and let that boil  & simmer with everything for an hour.  The flavor was AMAZING! I then cut off the ham meat from that and added it to my soup. I added a whole (smaller size) zucchini to the soup when there was about 20 minutes of cook time left. I put fresh cut up spinach at the bottom of my bowl and added the soup on top so it wilted down perfectly. 

The next time I make this, and I will for sure be making it again, I will use 1/2 the amount of lentils called for. 2 cups is a lot.

This soup was pretty tasty.  In response to other comments, I doubled my spices to add more flavor.  It was a little bit bland still, but overall it had a hearty flavor.

I am giving this recipe a 3star rating but after adding a few things I think it is a 5+
I added 8 chicken bouillon cubes, 4 diced and cooked andouille sausages and 1tsp cayenne pepper.

I will make this again, but there will be some adjustments.  Overall, pretty good starting point for lentil soup.  I could not bring myself to add 1/4 c olive oil so I used a splash instead.  I did add fire roasted tomatoes, a 28 ounce can as that is all I had, I also added vegetable broth instead of water.  At the end I sprinkled red pepper flakes and shaved parmesan on top and it was good!

The recipe was super easy.  I prefer salty to sweet.  So when I make it again, I'll cut the number of carrots in half and add more salt.  My husband and kids added sour cream and cheese.  I did not.

A well rounded recipe. This recipe is good, but a bit bland using just water. I substituted chicken stock for the water. I also think I will take some suggestions from other reviewers to try variations next time.

This was an easy recipe and turned out well. I upped the celery & carrots a bit, added a 14.5oz can of black beans (drained & rinsed) and used diced tomatoes over crushed. I added a scant teaspoon of thyme and used avocado oil instead of olive oil. This worked on its own or over rice.

Delicious! A few changes I made based on comments previously posted. I used 1,  28 oz can of tomatoes and half another. I then added 2  cups of water and replaced the vinegar with lemon juice. We then top it off with with smoked turkey sausages. Love our soups rich and thick.  Thank you for the recipe.

With a few modifications, this recipe was really tasty.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers such as doubling the spices, adding 4cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water. I would make sure to allow the soup to simmer for an hour so the flavors can meld. It does get a bit thick, so you may need to add more liquids. I think you can also take some liberties with the vegetables. I added zucchini and red pepper. Good recipe to build off of! My 5 year old asked for 2nds and begged to have it the next day!

Made as is with  vegetable broth in place of 1/2 the water, and balsamic vinegar....My 12 year old daughter said, "this has no flavor and is bland".   We added  more basil and oregano to make them double the amounts....and added a can of tomato paste.  A really good hearty soup.   Not sure I can give anything with lentils five stars....

I have been making  this recipe for years. I do alter slightly. I add a few chilli flakes when I am cooking the onions and carrots, etc. I like other readers substitute organic chicken broth (or cubes if that is all I have) to the 8 cups of water. Often times I like a little different flavour and I will add different spices and I particularly like Garam Masala (approx. 1+ tsp.). I also remove a scoop or two of the soup and mash and return to the pot...this adds a nice consistency to the soup. It's recipes like these that make life easy.....great recipe but also very easy to alter the recipe to whatever flavour you are feeling like!!

Replaced 14.5 oz tomatoes with 2 c fresh chopped.  No vinegar. Prefer own recipe without the celery and spinach, and easy on the  thyme.

So yummy!!!!! Only changes: added a spoonful of bouillon, fresh basil and fresh oregano, a sprinkle of sugar, 2 more carrots, no celery, and a total of 3 bay leaves. And I forgot the vinegar/lemon juice ~ excellent without.
Superb flavor!!!!!!!

I made this, but some simple changes based on experience and my preferences:

Rather than 8 cups of water, I used 6 cups of chicken broth + 2 water.

Before I add vegatables, I add 2 tablespoons minced garlic and 1/2 lb hot italian  sausage and 1/2 lb sweet italian sausage and brown it.

Before serving, I add a sprinkle of fresh grated romano cheese.

Thats it.. Try it.. you won't be disappointed.

I made this just as the recipe said, and it was okay, but a little bland. I definitely ate it all and it was filling, but I wish I had taken some suggestions from other reviewers to boost up the flavors.

Based on the reviews of others I subbed chicken stock for veg, doubled up on spices and carrots.  I also added thyme, a potato, a splash of white wine and topped with Parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

Yes, this recipe is kind of a flavor blank canvas . Meaning, you can make it your own.  Couple thoughts.  Water sautee instead of using oil.  More healthy. I doubled down on the spices . Used basalmic vinegar. Okay to use other power greens that you may have instead of just spinach. Also, I wanted a seafood flavor , so added dunce flakes at the end. (I'm vegan so no fish)  A little Tabasco, and all is good . Oh, and I like it a little thicker, so I halfed the water . Turned out great.

this is my favourite lentil soup recipe by far.  the flavours are nice and light but it makes a substantial winter soup, especially when paired with biscuits or garlic bread.  very yum.

When I tripled the batch I would recommend to add the lentils as the second to last step. Making sure all the veggies are cooked aldente, when add the 3 pounds of lentils to insure that the veggies are cooked and the lentils are also cook properly tender. I got LOTS of rave reviews on this particular Lentil soup recipe.

Agree with other folks about balsamic vinegar and added cumin as others suggested. Used all chicken broth instead of water. The kicker was bone in chicken thighs. Tasted great and added some chicken flavor.

I used 7 cups chicken stock instead of water, added more crushed tomatoes to make up for the other 1 cup of stock, 2 bay leaves, 4 cloves garlic, balsamic vinegar, added extra carrots, used frozen spinach, and omitted the celery. Was so good! Even the kids loved it.

Simple, fresh and clean ingredients makes for a hearty and delicious soup! My boyfriend and I loved it. The only thing "wrong" was that the recipe stated it made 6 servings; however it yielded a huge vat! It was more like 12-14 servings in my opinion.

Pretty good lentil soup & very easy to make! I substituted avocado oil in place of olive oil & used less (it's what I had on hand). I also added ground turkey Italian sausage. Lastly I replaced the water with chicken broth. I would definitely make this again :)

This was so delicious!  I did use a combination of veggie stock/ chicken stock and mead for the cooking liquid because I had all on hand.  I also had to add 2 cups more of water to the soup.  Thanks for sharing!  This will go in regular rotation for us.

Very hearty and tasty....it was delicious on this very cold Michigan evening!  It was quite thick for my taste so I increased the  broth (I used vegetable stock instead of water,) increased the oregano because I love  it, and added about, eh, a 1/2tsp of crushed red pepper for a little heat, and plenty of freshly cracked black pepper. I did use the vinegar at the end, but before serving and adjusting for salt, I squeezed in the juice of about half a lemon which really added a great flavor.  I made some toasted croutons with cubed sour dough bread I had on hand, tossed with  olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and finely grated pecorino.  Baked this in oven for about 10-15 min until crunchy and golden. I then served the soup topped with a handful of the hot croutons and a little more pecorino sprinkled over the croutons. This was so delicious...the family loved it!

This soup is simply legendary!!! Must be the best soup i've ever made. It's so simple, very filling and so healthy! 
Added cumin, and 3 cubes of chicken stock dissolved with 8 cups of water. 
Worked perfectly!! I can eat this everyday!!

This recipe is very hearty and makes tons. 

I read through all the other reviews and double the spices, did 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water, doubled the carrots, doubled the celery, and also added 2tbs balsamic vinegar instead of plain vinegar.  

My take away:  The soup is better with the chicken broth and double spices, but the balsamic vinegar just doesn't go.  It made the soup very tart and stood out too much from the more subtle, other flavors.  Next time I will also add chili flakes and maybe add some more crushed tomatoes  like some reviews suggested.

Soup is great with a little Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top!

I've been craving lentil soup,  but won't buy at the market because of the sodium. Making this at home, not adding any salt, except what's in the ingredients of tomatoes,  celery, etc makes it soooo much healthier. And, it's good. I did up the amount of veggies, and only add the spinach before I reheat to eat (it's good without,  but better with the spinach) and add the balsamic before serving. Oh, and because my joints are giving me trouble, I add a bit of tumeric too. This is a keeper recipe!

I made this last night for my vegetarian family & they all loved it (I ate brats & tots though).  :)  I added green beans and used a 24 oz can of tomatoes instead.  I also doubled the amount of garlic and went half-again the amount of spices, based on other reviews.  Even though my family is a not-so-spicy group, they were thrilled with the flavor.

I used the whole can of san marzano tomatoes and veggie + chicken broth instead of water.   I ended up really liking it - and it was definitely the balsamic vinegar that made the difference.  Tasted kinda bland once it was done cooking before that addition.  I think I put in more than called for since we seasoned each bowl to taste.

This was one of the best soups I've ever had. Did a little tweaking. Used vegetable broth and no water. Added a can of tomatoes that I puréed and one can of diced tomatoes.  Also used kale instead of spinach.

I added 4 carrots, 4 garlic gloves, and use chicken broth instead of water.  Cooked up low and slow all day.

I always hesitate to review recipes I can't make exactly, but this was really good even without the tomatoes. I can't eat them so left them out. Otherwise I tried to stick as close as possible to the recipe. I also added balsamic to each bowl when serving per another reviewers suggestion instead of white vinegar as that sounded better to me.

I used red lentils.  The only thing I don't like is they turned out too mushy. And they simmered less than 30 minutes. The flavor is great. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and instead of vinegar I used pickled jalapeno juice. Yum.

Love this! And my kids who don't like lentils like it, too! I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and next time will do that but also add some diced fresh! Also used about 30 baby carrots. Used less oil. 8 c stock and 1 1/2-2 c water, 4 cloves garlic, 1 t each oregano, basil and cumin. Added balsamic to each serving individually. Blended about 1/3 of it and then added back for awesome texture!

Great soup as long as you make some modifications. We used chicken stock, rather than water and also doubled - at least - all the herbs/spices. While the lentils are filling enough on their own, and this is a hearty soup, we also made small chicken meatballs and added them in. Delish!

VERY GOOD.  Made it this time with chicken broth.  Doubled the vegetables and the spices.  Did not add spinach, salt, and vinegar.
Also good with 1 onion, 4 celery, no carrots,  4 garlic, double the spices, 16 oz lentil, 2 (14.5) cans of diced tomatoes, 8 oz tomato sauce, and 2 cartons of chicken broth.

This was hearty and delicious for "mostly" vegetarian" soup - I used low-sodium, low-fat chicken broth instead of water.  I also added an additional can of tomatoes, personal preference. Rather than cooking spinach in the soup, we put it in the bottom of the bowls before adding the hot soup.  A squeeze of lime juice (instead of the vinegar) to taste at serving topped this off.

A GREAT lintel soup recipe using some really good spices to amp up the usually bland lentil.  Be generous with your spices.  Safe to say spices could be doubled...... and salt and pepper are a must.  Serve with Sriracha hot sauce and you'll have lots of smiling faces!   I doubled this and canned the leftovers in quart jars for gift giving.

I've made this several times, but I read the comments for pointers and made a couple of changes of my own. I at least double the vegetables and garlic, use 2-3 large bay leaves, and use vegetable broth instead of water. I also add one large diced potato. I wait about a half hour before I add the potato and diced tomatoes, and I add about four little peppers for a little kick. I actually leave out the vinegar (I should try it next time) and I don't add the spinach because they get almost slimy after a while. I have gotten some of the best comments for my soup, and because of all the garlic, onions and other vegetables, this soup is great to make you feel better when you're feeling under the weather!

Great soup but made some changes! I'm used to a more Mexican style lentil soup(hubby is Mexican) but this was really good. Instead of white viniger I used balsamic.  I also added celery salt in addition to the celery already in the soup, can of crushed tomatoes,  and 8 cups of chicken broth instead of the water, and chicken Apple sausage. My hubby added tiger sauce to his for a added kick.

This was a great recipe but I had to make a few adjustments. Used 4 cups of broth instead of water and then doubled the crushed tomato (used Italian seasoned). I also doubled all the spices (as others suggested). I then cooked the veggies in a pan and cooked the lentils in a pot with the broth. Once both were done I transferred to the slow cooker and set on high for a few hours, this  really brought all the flavours together

I was looking for a good luck meal to introduce 8 of my friends to the new year when I found this gem! I did modify a bit though.... I doubled all of the veggies, garlic and used 10 cups of chicken stock. I also added 1.25 lbs. of ground pork for flavor and added additional basil/oregano throughout the summer based on the smell profile. 

Definitely was generous with the salt/pepper/vinegar until I got the flavor I was really looking for and it was a HUGE hit! Everyone LOVED it and we had the best time. Thanks!!

Delicious! Even my kids ate it and that says a lot. I followed some suggestions. Doubled the spices, added some cumin and red pepper flakes. I used chicken broth and vegetable broth instead of water.  I also had leftover rotisserie chicken so I added that as well.

I love having these recipes as a base, but I always add my own creative instinctive touch, combined with what I have on hand in the pantry. So,  with the onion I added    garlic, potatoes, carrots and celery and sauté that for a while and then I added a cup of sliced mushrooms.  The ratio of lentil to tomato seemed wrong so I added another can of crushed tomatoes, also added some Bajarat  seasoning, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar and balsamic.  After it was cooked for an hour I  use the hand blender to break up some of the lentils but not all of them. I'm happy with the way it turned out   ??

I will for sure make this delicious soup again. My children had 3 bowls each! I substituted Italian seasoning in place of the basil as I didn't have any on hand. Also I used canned diced tomatoes with herbs and spices, instead of plain canned diced tomatoes.

Uhhhh...YUM. The recipe may seem technically difficult and lots of people have modified but follow this order regardless of your choices of veggies and spices and you'll be in the money: saute the mirepoix first, then add your garlic, spices and herbs and saute that, then add your lentils (1 minute saute) and then anything with liquids (tomatoes, broth, etc.) and bring to a boil. If you're adding extra veggies such as zucchini or squash, add a half part extra liquid during that step for every 2 parts of veggies. I added 2 cups of chopped zucchini and squash so added 1 cup of extra chicken broth earlier. Also, add those veggies about 30 minutes into your cook time to get them tender without making them mushy. Once you have the formula down, adding different flavors or vegetables is fun. You could play with an Indian version of this by adding cumin, red pepper, coriander and a bit of turmeric or go with  Greek flavors (paprika, lemon juice, cumin, touch of cinnamon), or stick with the recipe which is perfectly flavorful itself! Remember to add your salt and pepper towards the very end to get the true final flavor. This all came together rather easily once I understood the steps and turned out beautifully!

I added crushed red pepper and instant brown rice. It came out spicier and more like a stew than a soup, but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee and it's delicious! I'll be sure to make this again when I'm entertaining vegan friends.

My dissapointment stems from the fact that there are so many positive reviews and my batch fell way flat. I found myself going back time after time dumping spices in it trying to add any flavor.

My additions: 10 cups of chicken stock, 2 medium potatoes, 2 handfuls of spinach, I squeezed a little bit of lemon and omitted the vinegar, 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, AND I added a little over a 1/2 lb of mild italian sausage without the casing (I browned it in a pan separately and than added it). Very hearty and good!

Followed other reviewers advice. Doubled the garlic and spices, and I used double the diced tomato instead of some of the broth. Used broth instead of water. Added a generous amount of salt and pepper, extra spinach, and double the carrots and celery. Used an immersion blender at the end to thicken it up a bit. With all the changes, it was really good!

This was my first time making lentil soup! I made a few changes (inspired by another commenter). I doubled up the spices, I used a cup of spinach, I substituted the vinegar for lime juice, and added 1/2 cup of chicken broth including the 8 cups of H2O. 

This was yummy! We thoroughly enjoyed it.

My third time making this! This time is the recipe I'm going to stick with. I doubled all the spices as in previous comments, I used chicken bouillon and diced tomatoes. I didn't have any bay leaves, so I skipped that. I also didn't have spinach so I substituted kale – which was pretty yummy. I highly recommend the balsamic vinegar. Something I did for the first time was to take 4 cups of soup and purée it and pour it back into the other soup and it was delicious!! I know some people blend the whole thing but I never feel full with puréed soup.

Will definitely make this again. Used low-sodium chicken stock instead of water and added half a kielbasa, sliced and quartered, and sauteed before adding onion. I also used a can of whole plum tomatoes that I mashed up before adding, leaving nice chunks of tomato in the finished soup. This is a very easy recipe and will, I think, lend itself to improvisation.

Made this tonight but made a few substitutes and it came out delicious. My 4.5 yr old raved about it too. First I halfed the recipe and substituted chicken stock vs water and tomato sauce vs crushed tomatoes since I had it on hand. I used 1 whole bay leaf. I also added 1 tsp of cumin. Delicious with plenty of flavor.

I have made this soup twice now.  Once with green lentils, and once with red.  

I do not use tomato products, so I eliminated that.  I used Progresso Vegetable broth, no MSG. And I did use balsamic vinegar when I dished it up.

I used ham in a few bowls and it was very good, and I have also used pieces of roast chicken.

Will definitely make again and keep experimenting with it.  Isn't that what cooking is all about?

Very good recipe.  I recommend subsituting a couple cups of water for chicken broth as other reviewers have suggested. Otherwise it will taste watery.  This recipe did make a hefty amount, even for a family of four.  There was plenty to freeze for later.

I followed a few suggestions from other reviewers (more chicken broth, tomato sauce, veggies and port wine).  I also added a few small diced up turkey/chicken sausage for my personal meat preference and it was delicious.

This lentil soup reminded me of my Moms'. I did make a few changes based on other reviews. I used vegetable and chicken broths instead of water to add more flavor. I added more basil and garlic. I used this recipe as the basis for a childhood favorite. It was awesome!

I have made this soup several times now and my family loves it.  This is a great base recipe to keep and change it up as you like.   I use either chicken broth instead of water, or I add chicken bouillon cubes.  I use canned beans instead of dry and I've used various beans, cannellini or kidney beans.  I've used Kale instead of the spinach.  I also add some cooked hot Italian Sausage, sliced... it gives it so much more flavor.  I serve this over small cooked pasta such as ditalini.

If you add kale and  broccoli at the end, just a two minutes before finish is very delicious

I just finished making this delicious soup.  The changes I made were to double all of the spices just as others have suggested.  This is truly one of the best soup recipes I have ever tasted.  You won't be disappointed!  I will portion the soup into just what we eat tonight and add spinach to that portion only.  Tomorrow night we will eat the remaining soup and I will add the rest of the spinach to that portion.  This way, you won't have soggy soup. Enjoy!

I kept the ingredients basically the same, except that I added 1lb of Italian chicken sausage. I also just used 1.5 teaspoons of Italian seasoning in place of the spices. Very very yummy soup, it was thick and filling.

We saw the recipe, whent to the store, and came home and made the soup. We both loved it. We will make this on the road and make every one in the RV Park wander where the aroma is coming from.

My family often makes this when we have leftover chicken, just add chicken for a little bit of meat!  So good, I always need a second bowl.

This recipe is amazing! I didn't have basil and spinach available at the time so those were skipped. I did make a slightly different version by putting together top 2 reviewers reviewer. I added 4 cups chicken broth and 4 cups water. Then 3 tablespoon of lemon. I then added a cup of potatoes and italian sausages towards the 30min mark. When finished i topped with handful of cilantro and man it was heaven!

My whole family enjoyed this. I added leftover Easter ham so that added some wonderful flavors to the mix. As others have recommended, I added lemon juice in lieu of vinegar.

Very tasty with several changes.  I fried three pieces of bacon in the pot first...took them out and used the bacon grease to soften the leeks, carrots, and celery. I used leeks instead of onions, doubled the spices, doubled the tomatoes, and substituted chicken stock for the water. Yummy!

This makes a wonderful Lenten soup.  However, I had to add another cup of wate, and it should be simmered with the lid on.  I also didn't aadd the vin.
But came out fantastic!

Made changes based on other reviews. Doubled the spices, used 2 cans of diced not crushed tomatoes, used 5 cups of chicken broth and 3 cups of water.  Sautéed veggies and spices for 3-5 minutes then threw it all into the slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Placed cooked spinach, chicken sausage and balsamic on table to add individually...served with oven baked cornbread and my family devoured it. We all agreed it was the best lentil soup we had ever had!!

With changes this is delicious hearty soup.  Even my picky husband loves it!  Use beef or chicken broth for water.  Add a big can of crushed tomatoes and a can of stewed.  Double spices and garlic.  Add a whole bag frozen spinach or use fresh.  Kale would be good also.  Toss in mushrooms if you have them.  Serve with warm rolls.

Wow.  I expected to love this based on all the great reviews.  I've never had lentil soup before, but I love beans/peas/legumes and vegetables so I expected to love this recipe as well.  I followed it exactly, except I subbed balsamic for white vinegar.  It was just okay.

I tried this one today and it turned out great! I made 6 servings, left out the spinach, used homemade tomato sauce, added 4 teaspoons of chicken soup base, substituted vinegar from a jar of pickled jalapenos. I saw other recipes that suggested using a wand blender to thicken the soup if you found it was runny, mine was not runny, but for those who like a thicker soup this might be a way to achieve that. Enjoy!

This reminds me more of a minestrone than traditional lentil soup but it is quite tasty.  I didn't use the amount of oil the recipe called for -  I just used a couple of sprays from my oil mister. I also eliminated the vinegar but hubby and I really like this

I made this recipe tonight and it turned out wonderful. I made a few changes to it, instead of using vinegar I used a chicken stock. I also tripled the amount of vegetables the recipe called for and added some crushed red pepper for a bit of spice. All in all it was an easy meal to make and tastes great on a cold winter day.

Good. Halve the oil. Subs: Celery seed vs celery. Chicken broth vs water. Plum tomatoes vs crushed. Red wine vinegar vs white vinegar. Add: 1/4 tsp thyme and - either cooked sausage, sliced, or leftover chicken. Serve with a sprinkling of Parmesan.

I don't cook often...so I had to substitute or omit some items that I didn't have. I used frozen spinach, canned lentils (bad me), and canned diced (instead of crushed) tomatoes, small can of organic vegetable broth. Also, I love coconut oil, its great for high heat sauteing of onions and it leaves a nice subtle flavor, so that was my oil substitute. I accidentally spilled the salt in it - so I did not add the vinegar in case it was already too salty. It was delicious!  I ate a bowl with my husband's home made bread with melted mozzarella cheese...mmmmmm.

A nice light and tasty soup! Didn't take too long either. I added marjoram and bits of lean chicken and used lemon juice instead of vinegar... and used tomato paste instead.

I added most of a small bag of spinach, summer sausage, about 2 tablespoons of butter, and balsamic vinegar like was mentioned in other comments. It was DELICIOUS! My mother, mother-in-law, and husband, who doesn't normally like soup, was also impressed!

This is a good recipe, I did some changes to it though. I added one red potato, and only used half cup of the lentil beans, one carrot, half an onion, four small white mushrooms sliced and still the same amount of spices and other ingredients. I also replaced the canned tomatoes with one real roma tomato diced, it was perfect amount for two, and just the right amount of sourness to it. Tasted great!

I am so bummed I added the vinegar to the soup!  It tasted great without it, mild flavors but good!  Now all I taste is vinegar and I have a whole pot of it.

I loved this soup . I used a large can of crushed tomatoes and 4 cups of chicken broth .  I omitted bay leaves.
Otherwise it was as the recipe states 
Oh I did add one large potato near the end .  My daughter who is very fussy just happened to stop over and today in Florida its very cool.  Perfect for soup.  She said it smelled good so she tried it and ended up eating two bowls of it!  She sprinkled grated cheese on the top!  Thanks this is a keeper :)

This soup has become a standard recipe in use at our house.  Our neighbors also love it.  In the winter I make it as often as I make chili.  It pairs well with any kind of bread, but cornbread is our favorite.  It's easy to make over an open campfire, so we often make it when we go camping.

This was way better than I expected.  I did double the veggies and used fresh herbs.  Used a big juicy Meyer lemon instead of vinegar.  Threw everything in the crock pot, used no oil.  Very filling and nourishing.  Good recipe.

Delicious and hearty! I omitted the vinegar, doubled the celery and carrots, added a sweet potato, plus more of the spices. Oh, and jarred marinara instead of canned tomatoes - just because that's what I had at home. Sooooo good!

I liked this soup. I followed the original recipe except I used frozen spinach (didn't have any fresh) and I put the tomatoes in the food processor before adding because my Hubby's not crazy about tomatoes chunks in soup. It was very good, but processing the tomatoes made it a more tomatoe base. I won't do that next time. I will definitely make this again! BTW,I used Trader Joe's canned plum tomatoes and did not add salt to the pot, making the sodium less than 200mg for the entire pot. We salted individual bowls to our liking.

Good, but not great - a bit bland. I love veges, so I doubled the carrots, celery, and tomatoes.  I also doubled the garlic & substituted chicken broth for about half of the water.  Next time I will use more chicken broth and try increasing the spices and vinegar.

I absolutely love this soup!! I used organic vegetable broth instead of water and I chopped up 2 Roma tomatoes instead of adding canned tomatoes. I did add the cumin as I love cumin in soups. Totally tasty and good. Also since I didn't have spinach I used kale and a few left over leaves of escarole. It was very tasty especially when I topped it off with the balsamic vinegar and fresh parmesan cheese. Hearty and filling, definitely a keeper for me!

Just made it and it was absolutely tasteless. Thankfully it was saved with 1/2 tbsp. each of cumin and curry powder. Would make again, but only with SIGNIFICANT modifications.

Needed to get rid of the lentils in my pantry and I definitely chose the right recipe for it. I told my husband I was making a vegetable soup and he turned up his nose. In his mind, and soup without meat is lame. He is on his second bowl now! It's a healthy and delicious recipe that's very filling. I added a can of green beans and diced tomatoes for some other texture. I didn't have any carrots on hand and you can't even tell they're missing. I also used chicken broth instead of water and added a can of tomato sauce. I think any adjustments to this soup would work well as long as it's not crazy. Definitely worth making.

I made this just as is and it was ok.  Next time around I'll back off the vinegar a bit and add some stock to the mix.  I'll probably also increase the veges and the liquids as the lentils tend to absorb a lot of the liquid.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but I thought there was something missing. Perhaps next time I'll substitute the water with chicken broth. I did double up in the crushed tomatoes because I had a big can and I probably shouldn't have done that.

This is the first time i made lentil soup. I found according to the recipe it had no flavor. So I looked up the reviews and saw the changes that were made that made this soup awesome!! After I made the additional changes that others used it turned out to be awesome. Not the original recipe though. Thanks to others for there reviews. That really helped!!! My rating was for the original recipe. Not the final recipe...

Really great! I only added half of the vinegar, omitted the black pepper and added 1/4c of heavy cream, 1 1/2c of spinach, and 3 tbsp fresh grated Parmesan. Nice and creamy! Just the right seasoning for my taste. For the health nuts who count calories, my variation came to 344 per serving. Not too bad as these are big servings. This will keep me full all day!

Very plain tasting. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it needed much more flavor. It was a good base recipe so feel free to experiment and add more spices of your own.

This was quite good.  I did add seasonings... extra garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  I didn't have any spinach so I used fresh kale which I think gave the recipe more depth.  Next time I will toss some other kind of beans in too.  Enjoy!

This was my first attempt making soup, and I LOVED this recipe. I like that it was vegetarian, too.  Some modifications: I doubled the amount of garlic, onions, carrots and celery (I did not chop the veggies, I put them through our Oskar, so they were cut into very small pieces - but larger pieces than if they were minced), as well as the seasonings.  I also added granulated garlic during the simmering period.  Since I am a meat eater I felt the soup needed a 'bottom' flavor-wise, so I added 1/4 c. olive oil and Parmesan cheese.  PERFECTO!  My family and friends love it!!

I have made this soup quite a few times, but I use beef broth instead of water. I also add about 6 lincs of Italian hot sausages and sometimes I use kale instead of spinach. It's always a hit.

Delish!   I ended up making it and eating it the next evening so perhaps the sitting made it that much better.  This second day I had to add ~4 cups of additional water.  I followed the recommendations and used 64 oz of veggie stock, 28 oz of crushed tomatoes, 4 carrots and a container (4 cups) of spinach and 4 tablespoons of balsamic.  I also added a tablespoon of tomato paste and 2 tablespoons of butter since I had to add the additional water this second day (needed some depth).  End result - fantastic!  It's a keeper...thanks for the recipe!

It's a good, basic recipe that can be customized for each person's taste, as seen by all the reviews. I used fresh herbs, chicken stock, added chorizo sausage, and then needed 4 cups water for the right consistency.

Absolutely delicious.  I cut the oil dramatically and added a touch or nice red wine instead of the vinegar.  Healthy lunch all week!

I love lentils but in my opinion, this recipe only needs 1 cup of them, otherwise it's way too thick.  The longer you cook it, the more liquid it needs also.  Next time I will make these changes and I'll be much happier with the outcome.

First time I have ever had lentil soup, so I only made half recipe. Substituted a cup of chicken broth for one of the waters, and diced tomatoes. Easy recipe, only the cutting board and knives needed cleaning from the preparation. Both the wife and I will do this recipe again!

Made a few changes. Added cumin, left out basil. More garlic, 4 cups (one carton) vegetable broth and 2 cups water. I love vinegar, but didn't think it added much to the flavor. Great lentil soup!

Double the spices & herbs, more garlic, use Guinness Stout and vegetable stock instead of water, add two more carrots, use stewed tomatoes.  Yum!

This is more of a stew than a soup unless more liquid is added. I followed the directions but increased the amt. of vegetables and spices. I salted the veggies as they were being sautéed and used vegetable stock. This is absolutely delicious as a soup or stew. It was especially good during our Daniel Fast.

As for the picture, it does seem to have sausage added. That should be corrected.

This was a delicious soup!  I did use many of the suggestions mentioned (doubled the garlic, basil, oregano) and used a good white balsamic vinegar at the end.  I didn't have any celery, so substituted red/yellow bell peppers.  I also used 2, 26 oz cartons of chicken stock...no water.  I added another 8 oz. of stock at the end to thin it down.  I added a can of drained corn (it would be better with fire roasted corn),some shredded chicken breast and a few shakes of cumin and smoked paprika too.  Great, hearty dinner!

Excellent dish. I doubled the tomatoes, added more carrots and celery, and used vegetable broth instead of water. I also added some crushed red pepper flakes to give a bit of a kick. Served with cornbread and grated Parmesan on top. Delicious.

My 3 1/2 year old and I loved this!  I did not add celery or spinach.  I made homemade croutons and we added them to the top.  This is light enough where you don't feel like you need a shovel to eat it, and it doesn't leave you feeling weighed down.  I had "dilly bean" juice from my fermented green beans; I added 2 splashes of it at the end of the cook time instead of the vinegar.  I also cut the recipe in half, and between 2 adults, and a child, it will take us a couple of days to eat it up.  I will make this again!

Very good. I had some leftover cooked homegrown tomatos with chorizo  (that I'd had over pasta), and used them instead of canned tomatoes. This is a hearty, heavy soup, and perfect for a cold rainy day!

I LOVE this soup! I didn't change anything with this recipe.  I even made it for my boss, who is vegan and a good cook, and he loved it. This soup is so full of flavor! I've made it 3 times and am sure I will make it again before winter is over. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This recipe pretty much worked for me as published! I did use more garlic (4 cloves), also 4 carrots, used watered chicken stock in lieu of the water called for, and oh yeah, added about a teaspoon of powdered cumin. This is a keeper!

Very yummy.  I added a can of El Pato and red pepper flakes for spice. Good veggie soup but meat such as ham would have made it even better.  Crispy prosciutto on top would have sent this out of this world. In the recipes original form, it is still a very good soup.

Yum! Make sure you use a really high quality vegetable stock or the flavor just won't be the same. I use an organic stock from Trader Joe's and loved it.

Very Good! Substituted Dried Italian seasoning for oregano and bay leaf. Used 1.5 C. pureed (in food processor) fresh tomato instead of canned. Added 2T. chicken base. Omitted vinegar (personal preference). Added aprox. 3 more cups water after 45 min. simmer. Got rave reviews when served as "soup of the day" in my Diner.

I made a lot of changes and like how it turned out. Instead of olive oil I used coconut oil. I used red onion, baby carrots (chopped), orange bell pepper. I used 4 garlic cloves, and a hodge podge of spices including oregano, dill weed, celery salt, curry powder. I used water and green lentils, and substituted a can of garbanzo beans instead of tomatoes (because I had none). Instead of spinach I used kale and a portobello mushroom. I then added balsamic vinegar and Bragg's Amino Acids in place of salt/pepper. Yum. Fine with water.

Great Recipe. I add a bit more spices and do add the salt and pepper to give it a kick. I also freeze it and reheat and its decent. You can also sometimes add dried peas to it for a different texture, takes a bit longer to cook but if you soak them before wouldn't take so long. Solid recipe.

Great recipe.  Added some italian sausage and substituted sauted kale for the spinach and used 4 cups water and 4 cups chicken stock instead of the 8 cups water. Will definately keep this in the recipe box!

I've made it twice and my lentils never come out soft.  Am I supposed to soak them first or something?  I've cooked them and cooked them and they still seem a bit hard.

Pretty good.  Even my Small Child seems to have enjoyed it.  The texture is a tad bit grainy, but if you don't mind that, it's quite enjoyable.

Made exactly as written. Worlds better than the last lentil soup recipe I tried! You cannot neglect the salt and pepper to taste. Four stars because it was good but I wasn't crazy about it. That may be my own fault though... I'm starting to think maybe I don't like lentils as much as I think I do. :)

Delicious! I'm sure it would have been great as written, but I did make some changes based on ingredients I had on hand and personal taste. I cut the olive oil to just a couple tbs. Didn't have celery so added some celery seeds. Used half chicken broth & half water.  Used kale instead of spinach.  Added some diced yams and some hot Italian chicken sausage. Tasted while cooking and it was already so good I didn't see how it could get any better, so I didn't add the vinegar.  I also didn't need to add any salt, I think due to the chicken broth and spicy sausage. I will definitely be making this again, and again!

Made as written but then forgot the spinach and vinegar. Was ok. I also used half red lentils as another reviewer suggested. I needed to add an additional 1c of water and used veggie broth. Would make lentil soup again, but prob not this one.

I like! So... There were substitutions mostly due to using what I had on hand. 4 cloves of garlic, 1qt vegetable broth and 4c water, 1c tomato sauce instead of crushed tomato, kale instead of spinach, apple cider vinegar and the carnivorous being in me forced me to slice 4-6oz smoked ham and toss in as well. Yummy! Note: I would have also sautéed 1tsp red pepper with onions but I was out... Lucky folks bc I loooove spicy! Thanks for sharing Marie! Fall soups begin now ;)

I made this with a few alterations that I found in the other reviews. I added 4 cloves of garlic, 2 bay leaves instead of one, added a tsp of cumin and curry powder, used 2.5 cups broth and 5.5 cups water, and I subbed the spinach for kale as it holds up a bit better in soup and doesn't get all mushy after it's been refrigerated. I gave this 5 stars because it is an excellent base recipe that can easily be modified based on one's personal tastes. Will definitely be making this again!!

Very good. Added extra vegetables, canned black beans and smoked salt. Also substituted canned lentils (with liquid) for dried and decreased water to 6cups.

I really liked this soup although after reviewing the ingredients I realized I forgot the vinegar. Initially it was a bit bland so I added some vegetable broth and more salt to add some flavor. I love the healthy ingredients especially the protein of the lentils. It only took about 30 minutes of simmering before it was done however I only made enough for two servings. I will make this again, next time with the vinegar.

Very very yummy with these modifications:
I doubled the veggies and the spices, used less water and 4 cups of chicken broth.  I also used fresh basil (6 leaves or so), used 2 T of balsamic vinegar, added ~1 T of sugar to cut some bitterness to the tomato/celery ingredients, omitted the spinach (didn't see it on the list and forgot to buy it when I went to the store) and, finally I added 1 lb of browned link sausage, cut into 1/2 inch pieces.  Tonight I served it with slices of fresh mozzarella cheese melting over the top, but I think it would go quite nicely with grated parmesan as well. Not that it needs the cheese, I'd definitely eat it without, but it was a nice addition tonight.

 Overall, it was so good after all those changes!  This was my first attempt at lentil soup and we will definitely be having this again as fall and winter come upon us!

Awesome base!  Hubby got me the cuisinart immersion blender.  Chopped fine half a red onion, a shallot, 3 carrot, two celery stalks, all the leaves of the celery from the bunch, and 4 cloves of garlic....30 minutes with my new toy!  Sautéed in a lot of olive oil, added freeze dried basil and oregano.  Right before the chicken broth...added 1/4 cup of cream sherry.  Then added 10 minute cooked lentils (mix of red and brown...red being the most).  Then decided to add some tomato paste.  Thought what the heck...with my new new toy, preed some stewed tomato with a spoon of rosemary.  This isn't even done but wow already!  I plan to use the immersion blender for 1/3 of the soup.  If the broth is already this amazing (can already taste the earthiness of the lentils, tomorrow...I can tell already this will rock!  If for some reason I need salt and vinegar (shouldn't with the sherry), I will update.  I don't think I will even need heat which is rare for me.

I never leave reviews but seriously...go for it.  Adjust however you want.  Strongly recommend to chop fine all the veggies because I can tell this is a big player.  Remember, fine chopped carrots sautéed is like adding an earthy sugar.  Have fun!  And thanks a million for a great, forgiving recipe.

Delicious! Easy to play around with/use different veggies, etc. I took the advice of some other reviewers and used broth instead of water. Decreased to 6 c. and used a can of undrained tomatoes (the kind that is packed in tomato juice). Also used kale in place of spinach. I forgot to add the vinegar, and I'm sure it would have been a great addition, but I didn't notice at all. Flavorful, savory and healthy! Will definitely make again!

Very good base recipe!  I followed the suggestions of other commenters and added more of the things I liked: 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes with juices, 4 bay leaves, 3 tbsp. balsamic vinegar, 6 cloves garlic, and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce.  My husband loves it.  I didn't have any spinach, but it was still delicious.  I'm excited to try it with Kale!

My kiddo now eats Lentils!!!  I've made 3 times in the past 2 weeks--seriously.
Loved the recipe, but did modify as others suggested.  4 gloves of garlic, 4 celery stalks, 3 large carrots, diced a large tomato, and added a bunch of curry powder and cumin.  I also used a veg broth instead of water and reduced the olive oil to just a swish in the bottom of the pot. Other than those minor changes, followed the recipe as listed. 
I feel good about feeding this to my family!!
Thanks for sharing.

I tried this recipe...it was excellent. I am going to try adding the red pepper flakes for a little added flavour next time, like a previous review had posted. I found it was not spicy enough for my taste buds. I also added kale because i didn't have spinach..i liked it! And added some red kidney beans to the mix too. Will definitely be having this again!  + Add freshly grated romano parmesan cheese on top. I know I changed this recipe a bit...but it is very versatile!

Made this last night was my first time making Lentil Soup. Added more carrots (4 total) only, added 1 tbs of vinegar and added a larger can of tomatoes. Went really well with gluten free sweet cornbread. I will be making this again.

Agree with the majority of other comments-definitely needed additions to make it more palatable.  Veg or chicken stock instead of water, double the spices, add a bit of hot pepper flakes, and use the balsamic vinegar.  I also added about 1/2 cup of diced turkey ham.  Finally got it to a stage where it was hubby-approved, lol!

This is delicious!! 22g of fiber per serving is phenomenal.  I used fresh herbs and topped the soup with fresh basil. Leftovers were froze in individual serving sizes for quick high fiber meals.

This lentil soup rivals my mother's recipe. It turned out amazing. I made few changes: coated my dutch oven w/ coconut oil spray (Trader Joe's) omitting the 1/4c oil. I used 4 cloves garlic (not 2), 2 bay leaves, 2 cans stewed tomatoes, and 3 T balsamic vinegar (it gives a depth of flavor that other vinegars don't). Pureed 2-3 cups of it in Vitamix and added them back for a velvety base. Finished w/ Borsari salt and cracked pepper and green Tabasco. AWESOME!!!!!!!! Some reviewers used chicken broth, but I don't think this needs it. It was full of flavor. Who would believe this is a vegan recipe?........cheap, healthy, and so yummy!!!!! Thanks for posting it!

Fantastic recipe that my whole my family enjoys!  My only permanent substitutions are 8 c. of home made chicken broth instead of the water and lemon juice instead of vinegar... Sometimes I also use half red lentils and half green lentils... and sometimes I sub the spinach with kale... and if I want more protein, I'll brown up some italian sausage with the veggies.  It's a great base recipe!!!  So many possibilities to add on to!

Usually I make a lentil soup with sausage, Italian style, but since my husbands heart attack, I am very careful.  This soup had all the right stuff.  I made some seasoning changes, eliminating the salt and substituting the vinegar for lemon juice and instead of water used a "no salt added" chicken broth.  I cut the veggies into large chunks.  When the soup was cooked, I removed some veggies, blended them and put them back into the soup.  Made it hearty and we liked it a lot.

This is such an amazing soup!  I followed the recipe exactly as described.  The only confusing thing is that almost all the pictures show diced or canned tomatoes when the recipe asks for crushed tomatoes.  I've tried it twice, once with diced and the other with crushed and it was delicious both ways.  Best lentil soup I've ever made, yum!

So flavorful! I used chicken stock in place of water, celery seed b/c my kids don't like celery, 1tsp each of cumin and curry powder, and 2tbsp of red wine vinegar. I also made quinoa separately and added to individual bowls. Delicious!

It's a perfect 'base' recipe.  From New England - I choose to start the EVOO & a slice of herb butter in the pot with smoked Bacon and that adds a LOT of flavour -  also Consume' instead of regular stock and YUM YUUUM !

I followed this recipe exactly and I'm still trying to figure out how this was "the best lentil soup" some folks have had.  It was good but definitely not something to write home about.  It stuck around in our fridge for a few days, which means I will probably not make again.

We had this for dinner tonight and loved it! I had kale in the fridge already, so I used that instead of spinach. I added 1.5 c, but next time will add 3 c. My kids loved it and my husband said it is one of his favorites now! We also sprinkled a little Tony Chachere's creole seasoning on our bowls of soup, we liked that added flavor, but it was really good either way.

very good, but I used chicken broth instead of most of the liquid and at least 5 times the oregano and basil and at least 3 times the garlic.  If you want it to taste like anything - add a lot more spice.

The whole family loved this recipe.  Lots of flavor and the longer it sits in the fridge the better the flavor gets in my opinion.  As others have suggested I used half water and half vegetable broth.  Then substituted balsamic vinegar for plain vinegar. Definitely a keeper!

Chock full of lentils.  I gave it 4 stars because I had to add ALOT of vegetable broth as the beans swelled.  This was just to keep them moist, you can eat this stew with a fork!

This was a really easy and tasty recipe!  I made a few changes based on the previous reviews.  I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  I also didn't use all the recommended oil.  I only used about a tbsp.  Because I used chicken stock I didn't need to add any salt.  I'll definitely make it again!

This recipe is a staple in my kitchen! I make it quite often and it never dissapoints! I tried it for the first time in my crockpot yesterday and I basically threw all the ingredients in the crockpot all together, cooked on low for 4 hours, then switched to high for another 3. The only reason I did that was because I found the water was not absorbing well enough on low. So it would probably best to start it on a high setting for about 4 hours or so depending on your crockpot. It was just as good as when I make it in the pot. Not only is this lentil soup super healthy, but the recipe makes quite a bit so I can have lunch made for the next few days. I add a bit more vinegar than the recipe calls for right at the end because I like the tangy taste of the vinegar in the soup. I also don't bother adding the spinich, but no reason why you can't! Good luck!

This is an amazing recipe.  I have never been a huge fan of lentil soup but now I am!  I added extra garlic, onions, celery, and carrots because our family likes the veggies.  My husband and I ate it everyday for lunch last week and didn't get tired of it!  It's a keeper.

You know what made this recipe great... Instead of olive oil... I diced 1/2 lb of bacon, sauteed, removed the browned bacon from the pot. Kept the bacon fat - then tossed the veggies into that to saute.  Also added 2 jalapenos into the veggies.  Added the bacon back in to simmer. Awesome.  Plenty of room to customize and doctor.

Just made this for dinner tonight and all 4 kids ages 8-12 loved it. Changes made were as follows: I used strained tomatoes, put in 14 oz, added the other 10oz to half broth & half water to make 8 cups,doubled the spices and carrots& added 1tsp of curry powder& balsamic . Didn't have any spinach so I left it out and it was still a hearty soup.Easy to make and easy to change it up to suit your taste.

This soup is a wonderful comfort food .I added chopped kale instead of spinach and it was delicious and i didn not add the vinegar . I also added some chopped thai chilies to spice it up.

This is an absolutely amazing recipe!  I only changed two things (due to what was on hand) of which I'm sure had zero impact on the flavor.  I used dice tomatoes (instead of crushed) and I omitted the spinach.  I did read other reviews but I decided to give to original a try.  My "semi-picky on his lentil soup" husband thought it was marvelous.  Just a note - salt and pepper are a must.

It seemed watery to me so i added 2 T tomato paste! the lentils never got soft and my friend said that they'll do that if they're cooked with acid-y things (like tomatoes!), so i guess i'll cook the lentils first before adding the tomatoes next time! 
I also added golden raisons  and more vinegar because i like a little sweet &  sour with my soup. it was so good, yum.

My family liked it. I give the recipe as is 3 stars as it was written, but 4 stars when we doubled the spices and added veggie broth instead of water. My kids suggested adding potatoes for something to really bite into. 
We served this with rice on the side (I ate this more like a stew while hubby enjoyed it as a soup), baked marinated tofu slices (Terry Hope Romero recipe from Vegan Eat World), vegan banana bread for dessert (Post Punk Kitchen) and sweet tea/chai tea. We'll make this again but not often. It makes a lot, plenty to share with neighbors/friends!

Delicious! I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed, and I started the soup on the stove and finished it off in the crockpot which worked out perfectly. Thanks for sharing, Marie.  I plan to make this often.

Great recipe.  But I always cook with what I have at hand. And that included a big ham bone from Christmas. I made stock with the bone, defatted the broth and used it. The last of the ham pieces went into the soup too. (Eliminate all salt when using ham) Frozen tomatoes from my garden and spinach only in the amount to be eaten, as I do not like the way it gets when overcooked. Yes to the vinegar.  I love the way you can make soup your own with a good basic recipe like this one.

Hearty for sure....but even after adding two chicken bouillon cubes I felt it needed a little more flavor.  Maybe I will add another cube or two next time...as well as some black pepper.  Sure did go well with cornbread!!

Excellent soup- almost as good as my German mother-in-law's lentil soup. I did sub 4 cups of beef broth for half of the water and added about 3/4 cup of chopped ham for a meatier version of the soup.

it was quite good. used "bob's red mill" "vegi soup mix" which contains green split peas, yellow split peas,  different types of lentils, and a vegetable pasta (pastina)and some spices like paprika.  served it with crusty rolls and topped it with shavings of parmesan cheese. other than that did not modify it much other than to put alot more spinach in it. also added two leaks because i had them and I'm trying to eat more leaks.   one more thing, just bought this new choopper and chopped everything in no time.  great gizmo.yummmmmm......

A very hearty and tasty soup. Used about 2 3/4 cup of lentils, soaked & drained. Double the spices as other suggested[dried basil, oregano, bay leaves, thyme,].Used kosher salt -gave it a better flavor. Only used 1 can of crushed/diced tomatoes as I am not that fond of tomatoes.
Boiled 5 chicken breast bones for an hour to use a broth. Added cumin & red pepper flakes & used balsamic vinegar. I had also used the chicken meat off of the bones [just season it with soy sauce, add to individual bowls before scooping soup into it]. Left out the spinach because I did not have any but added 2 diced potatoes during the last 15 minutes of cooking. Also had to had another cup of water the last 1/2 hour - soup was getting too thick. Cooking time approximately a little under 1 1/2 hr.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised with this soup.  I was in a pinch for dinner and had everything on hand, minus the spinach.  I used fresh tomato and half chicken broth half water + 1 more cup of water (didnt want it to thick) I tested balsamic vinegar as others suggested and I tested lime.  The balsamic was much better, different. Didn't have an hour to simmer, so I keep it on med high heat for 30 min and it was wonderful. I don't like to rush soup, but it was getting late. It turned out really nice.

I really liked this soup.  It was a nice change from my simple lentil soup which usually doesn't include crushed tomatoes.  I may try crushing whole peeled tomatoes next time instead just to have a chunkier texture.  I used balsamic vinegar, and it was great. I enjoyed it.

This is definitely a good hearty soup, but I did tweak the recipe and boy was it better! 

I doubled the amount of garlic, oregano, and basil, added about 2tsp of red pepper flakes, used white balsamic vinegar (but only 1 1/2 Tbs), and - this is the BAM - 6 strips of Morningstar "bacon" (cooked first and chopped).

Yup. De-lish.

such an easy recipe first time making it and it is delish. one thing that I did different was brown Italian sausages in before the veggies and since my bf is a big meat eater I chopped the sausage and added it to the soup about half hour into the simmering.

I used chicken stock instead of water and doubled up on the spices. If you want it to remain a soup, you'll need to add more water. I didn't and it was thicker, more like a stew, but still delicious.

I did as other reviewer, doubled the spices and added 4 carrots instead of 2. I added 1 28 oz can crushed tomatoes and 3 cans of chicken broth. 3 cups of water or as needed. I used roasted garlic 4 cloves. Kale in place of spinach. I also added diced cooked chicken and cooked pasta. I used balsamic as others suggested. A great hearty soup

I loved this soup. I had orignally made it for my 9 month old son since he is just starting solids and it is soft but my husband, mom and I ended up eating it too.  I added some zucchini and red hot sauce to add some more flavor.  It was yummy!

I've made this twice now, and I agree with a previous post that it is really bland.  The first time I made it I followed the directions as posted.  Not much flavor, but a good start.  The second time around I substituted chicken stock for the water, and added about 3 Tbs. curry powder and a tsp. red pepper flakes, and dropped the the vinegar.  Came out very flavorful.

Excellent and hearty soup. I was lazy so I put all of the ingredients in a crock pot and omitted sauteing the vegetables. Thinking that it would be plenty wet in the crock pot I added 1 box of chicken broth and 28 oz of crushed tomato. After 8 hours on low it was starting to stick. Next time I will add another 28 oz of tomatoes. I love spinach (!), but it didn't fit with this recipe. My husband suggested cabbage for the next time. Thanks for sharing!

I love this soup.  It is my "go to" recipe whenever I want to make lentil soup.  The only things I do differently are:  1.) I add 4 chicken boullion cubes and 2.) experiment w/the vinegar flavors (white, red, balsamic, etc.).  Such a great recipe.  Thanks, Marie!

I used homemade chicken stock and threw in a peeled sweet potato in addition to the other veggies. I didn't use spinach because I didn't have it, but it still turned out really good. I also added about 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar to the entire pot of soup before serving.  I made it in a crock pot on low and it was ready in about 3 hours.  YUM!

This is so great! I added corn and red kidney beans, and subbed kale for spinach. I also went with another reviewers suggestion and went with balsamic instead of white vinegar and I loved the sweetness it added. Good stuff! I enjoyed this soup very much.

Good soup made according to directions.  The chicken stock would make it off limits to vegetarians, but would improve flavor, I'm sure.  I served it with Honey of an Oatmeal Bread found on this website.

So yummie!  I altered it a little.  I doubled all the spices, did 4 cloves garlic, and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes, and 1/4 tsp hot sauce.  Also, I just used 2 cans of lentils and reduced the water to 1.5 Cups.  I didn't have spinach so I left that out.  Lastly, I put about 1/2 the batch in the blender then added it back to make it extra creamy. YUM!

Easy and delicious recipe. I cut the olive oil down to a teaspoon, omitted celery, cut water down to 7 cups, and added much more vinegar. Also per another reviews' recommendation, doubled all the spices. Tastes much better after refrigerating overnight. Thanks!

Excellent recipe! My first lentil soup and it was SO good. I made my batch in the slow cooker-took 2hrs. I used 4 cups veggie broth and 4 cups water. I added red pepper for color and used a fresh tomato instead of canned. I served it hot over the spinach so I could freeze the leftovers and I never added the vinegar. It is SO good!

I took other reviewers suggestions and subbed 1 can reduced sodium chicken broth for 2 cups water, omitted the celery (didn't have on hand), doubled the spices, garlic and carrots, used diced instead of crushed tomatoes and used 1-2 T olive oil.  I also added 1 tsp cumin.  I added about half a bag of frozen spinach at the end and pureed the whole thing with an emersion blender.  I drizzled balsalmic vinegar on each individual bowl- a definite must substitution.  Delish!  My husband loved it and he's not a big lentil fan.  So glad to find a good, filling low-fat soup!

Good recipe - but not great.
I added barley along with the lentils. Added chicken and spinach towards the end. Added cumin and balsamic vinegar for seasoning.

Love this soup! I've made it several times and it's always a hit :) the variations I've made are to use fresh Roma tomatoes instead of canned and also some cumin to season it a bit more. Yum!!

Very good very healthy soup.  I cooked it longer than suggested to let the flavors blend.  I also added a little heat to the recipe with several dashes of tobasco.

I read many reviews before making this style of Lentil Soup. First I'll start with my changes. I started with 1 cup of lentils and soaked them in 2 cups of water and a teaspoon of malt vinegar for 6 hours. I cut the olive oil down to 2 tablespoons and used one and a half medium onions. In place of the oregano, basil, and can of crushed tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes that were already seasoned with oregano and basil. I left out the spinach but added ham and substituted 2 cups of chicken broth in place of water.


I sauteed the onions in the olive oil and when the onions were almost done I added the garlic. Then I added the lentils and the water they were soaking in, 2 cups of chicken broth, and one cup of water. I also added the carrots, celery, bay leaf, and tomatoes at this time. after about ten minutes I added about one and a half cups of cubed ham, a 1/4 tsp of black pepper, 1/4 tsp of ground mustard, a tsp of malt vinegar, and 1/2 tsp of salt. I let this cook on med heat for about 20 minutes. I used about 3 teaspoons of corn starch to thicken it up and continued to let it cook on med for another 10-15 minutes while stirring it continually. 

I loved it, my wife liked it and my son said it was ok. Both felt it would be better if the tomatoes had been left out. They definitely added an unexpected tang to the soup.

As featured, this recipe needed a lot more flavor.  With a few changes, it was 5 stars.  Used chicken bouillon or stock added to water.  I added a cup of barley and sweet Italian sausage, and used home canned tomates,and used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar...perfect!

Liked this soup alot! I used one cup of leftover chicken broth, but just water for the rest. It was still very flavorful and helped with my goal for a budget meal. And I added 2 extra cups of water to make it more of a soup. I managed to make this pot for just a few dollars. I substituted savory for basil (didn't have any) and added some red pepper flakes. I thought the soup was going to be missing something until I added the vinegar (used red wine vinegar), and that added just the right bite.

This is a really good soup. My question is that the recipe calls for crushed tomatoes which is pretty much a thick sauce...did they mean to put diced tomatoes or whole tomatoes....Not sure if this is a typo or what. Anyway, great soup my turned out very red with no pieces of tomoato. Nothing like the photo.

I just finished texting my husband to tell him this was the best lentil soup recipe. I took JPMARYLAND's advice and used more carrots, bay leaves, and spinach. I also added potatoes and used chicken broth instead of water. I served this with some homemade Irish soda bread and it was just the thing I needed on a cold night!

I just threw this together this morning for such a good lunch! SO DELICIOUS!! Just a few changes though, I didn't have Bay Leaves, Spinach, or regular vinegar. As a substitute I used rice vinegar which turned out quite well, and I also added a bit of garlic powder. Thanks for the recipe! I'll be using this again for sure.

Very nice.  Maybe just a bit watery.  I let it simmer for about 75 minutes.  Maybe it should go longer or use less water? Lentils are also still a bit crunchy. Maybe I'll feel differently after leaving it in the fridge overnight but wanted to try a bowl right away.

My family really liked this recipe.  They had never had lentils before.   I had only had lentil soup once before, and this was better.   I simmered for 1.5 hours and added the cumin and did 6c. water, 2c. chicken broth as other reviewers had done and also used balsamic vinegar, and was happy with these adjustments.  Will definitely make again.  Next time with some nice crusty bread.

I've prepared this recipe three times, I rate it as excellent.
I use vegetable stock instead of water and add @ least 1/3 more vinegar.

Excellent.  Doubled the basil and oregano as I like more robust flavors.

I loooove this recipe!  I make it all the time....sometimes adding more veggies and less when I make it for my boyfriend since he doesn't love carrots.  It can't really go wrong either way.  It's delicious and everyone I've ever made it for loves it too!

This soup is easy to make and as many said, it's a great base that can be tweaked according to your preferences. I added a splash of balsamic, a teaspoon of cumin, and used a vegetable broth base instead of water and doubled the garlic and spinach. I added some water later as I saw the soup thickening. It was very flavorful! My husband prefers lentil soup that has sausage or some meat and said the soup was amazing and the best he has ever had or as good as my grandmother's recipe. She uses chorizo and ham in hers. Next time I'll add potatoes. The best part is that it's inexpensive and easy, and makes enough for leftovers. Loved it!!! Thanks Marie! :)

Great recipe.  I had to add a little sugar because the amount of vinegar called for was a little too much for my taste.  I also add split peas and orzo to the soup.

After reading the recipe I felt as though it was missing something, so I decided to add a package of firm tofu. It turned out very good. The tofu adds something to it, it seems kind of bland without a "main ingredient". It tastes best when it's lukewarm, not hot and not cold.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars partly because my husband was able to fix by adding some butter to counteract the acidity of the balsamic vinegar. I would do this recipe again and either omit or dramatically reduce the vinegar to maybe 2tsp not tblsp and no butter. The amount of vinegar that the recipe calls for, in my opinion, ruins the soup. Also, not all that oil is needed just a tblsp or so to sautee the veggies.

A great tasting and satisfying soup! the I didn't use as much oil and I omitted the oregano and basil ( just not a fan ), used two bay leaves, used two cups of red lentils with 3/4 cup of brown lentils.  This recipe will be a great go to soup for the cold months!  I'm looking forward to trying it with the suggested smoked sausage and whole grain pasta also =)

Very good and satisfying.  It is nice to see a soup made with water as the base instead of chicken or vegetable stock.  It helps reduce the sodium content.
In my opinion this recipe serves 8-10.  It is a very hearty soup.

First time making this and the soup turned out so yum! This is an excellent recipe to use as a base and make changes/additions according to individual tastes and/or to use what you have at home. Instead of spinach I used rainbow swiss chard. I even diced up the tough stems and sauteed them with the onions, celery and carrots. I also substituted fresh basil instead of dried - it gave the soup a fresher flavor. And I also added some fresh chopped tomatoes and baby sweet peppers. Even though this recipe makes a lot of soup, you can freeze individual serving portions and have a fast, healthy and delicious last minute meal.

I LOVE this recipe and have used it MANY times.  However, I have always altered it, following many of the review suggestions because they help make this soup AMAZING.

I always double the spices, carrots, and celery.  I use balsamic vinegar to taste, rather than just vinegar.  I often use maple bacon grease instead of oil to cook the veggies, then top the soup with crumbled maple bacon before eating (President's Choice makes excellent maple bacon).  While I have used potatoes in this recipe many times (as suggested by some reviews), I like freezing the left overs in portion-sized mason jars for lunches and the potatoes just do not freeze well.  I also did not enjoy mixing red and green lentils.  The green just tastes heartier in my opinion.  Hope this helps! :)

Based on other recipes I reviewed, I also added a bit of chicken broth, cumin, corriander & red pepper flakes.  I doubled the garlic and bay leaves.  Unlike the recipe, I soaked the lentils for about an hour before adding them to the pot.  To make this meal more robust, I will add shrimp, sausage or parsnips next time.

Great recipe.  I did double the garlic and carrots and I also used 2 cans of chicken stock and 1 can of beef broth.  I also took about half of the lentils and blended in a blender, then added back into the rest of the soup to give a thicker consistancy.  One more addition, I added a little sausage that I had in the fridge to give a little more flavor.  I have to tell you it was very, very good and I will be making again.  Great tasting, high in protein and high in fiber, what more can you ask for?

I like lentils but this recipe seemed without flavor. Perhaps too much water?  Considering all that was in the recipe it was surprisingly tasteless and bland.  Needs more seasoning or different type of seasoning

This is a great soup! Some changes were 3 bay leaves, 7 1/2 cups of water, replaced the carrots with parsnips, some frank's hot sauce, red pepper flakes, and used 4 cloves of garlic.

Loved this recipe! Rather than water, I used chicken broth. Added a savory flavor that I felt was lacking when just used with water. Doubled the crushed tomatoes too. Also I find that soaking the beans the night before really helps lock in all the different flavors, as well as, decreases gas.

This was delish!  I made it with chicken broth, and left out the spinach (as my hubby hates it), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I served it over Onion Rice (recipe on this site). All of my kids gobbled it up, and my three year old even asked for it the next day for lunch!  Yummy!

This lentil soup is great!! I did change it up a bit, I didn't use as much olive oil, I used 5 garlic cloves, I added a potato, zucchini and a can or corn, and I used a large can (750ml) or crushed tomatoes, and I used 9 cups of water in total, 3 cups was chicken broth. I also added 2 tsp of cumin to make it a bit spicy, and the soup turned out delicious! I am definitely making this soup again :).

Fabulous basic recipe. Only revision was that I used low sodium chicken broth instead of water. It was rich tasting, with everyone taking 2nd helpings. Will definitely make again.

mmmmm.....what a delicious soup.  I made a few changes based on what other reviewers have said and what I had on hand.  I used celery root, added less olive oil, and doubled the garlic, basil, and oregano.  I used more tomatoes, and chicken broth instead of water.   I didn't have any spinach, but the recipe doesn't need it (although I bet it's good).  I wanted to add port, like someone else said, but since I didn't have any I just sweetened some merlot I had on hand and put it in with the balsamic vinegar.  Sooooo good!!

Great recipe! Add ground sausage or beef and this makes a wonderful chili too.  Defintely needs some cumin, even if you aren't going to add meat. I also used part chicken broth and part water instead of all water. I double the veggies and used 28oz of crushed tomatoes. This is a recipe that can be loosely followed, so be creative and make it to your liking.

This recipe is perfect, w/ a few tweaks ;)  I used half water, half cxn broth - added a little more water near the end, it was getting a little thick.  Needs a 3rd garlic clove, make sure you use heaping tsps of spices.  I added a tsp of Better Than Boullion (no MSG). I think two tbsps of balsamic is a little much, the taste of it overpowers the soup, to me.  It also doesn't match the other flavors in the soup. If i even use vinegar again, I'll use red wine, and cut it down to one tbsp. Other than that, this rules and is easy and now a staple for me!

Added smoked turkey sausage, a tsp of curry powder, a tsp of cumin and doubled all spices. Topped with some fresh grated parm and had a loaf of onion herb bread, cheddar slices, a bottle of Shiraz and friends- a perfect fall meal.

Most amazing soup recipe I've ever made! I tweak it a little, using an entire bag of lentils, 24oz can of crushed tomatoes and an extra can of tomato sauce.  Plus I add more water and use an entire 16oz bag of baby carrots diced, as well as use about 3 cups of spinach.  The result is an amazingly tasty tomato-based vegetable/lentil soup, a portion of which can be frozen and enjoyed later.

I love this soup!  It makes enough to share and freezes well.  My variation - added 1 small chopped zuchinni, used a larger can petite diced tomatos.  Also used half vegetable broth & half water.  The zuchinni makes the broth more hearty.

Loved this recipe. I used some other suggestions and added the sausage and potatoes. I think next time I would use a zuccini or another type of squash to give it a little bit more of a crunch.  But this is wonderful.

The family did enjoy the soup.  We are carnivores so a cubed ham steak was added.  We also bumped up to 3 bay leaves.

Thank you 4 sharing this recipe! It turned out sooo much better then I expected! I cut the recipe in half and cut out the vinegar and it was great! I did have to keep adding water though while the soup was cooking because it kept going down and I didn't want it to be more of a stew.

Really tastey!! A great vegetarian dish. i could only give 4 stars because I did make changes; I doubled the spices(oregano, basil, bay leaf and garlic and added a dash of Cumin). like everyone suggested. used just water it was still good. I did soak my lentils for about an hour before putting them in the soup not sure if it was necessary but I had to seperate preparation into 5 minutes snippits so I  just left it in water after I rinsed it because I had to leave. All in all a tastey healthy dish.

Everyone in my family loved this! My picky brother was finally coaxed into tasting a spoonful, and he ended up going to get his own bowl! Wonderful recipe. I omitted the bay leaf because we were out, doubled the garlic, and added about 2 tsp of cayenne pepper for the extra kick. Definitely a keeper :)

Great soup to have on a cold winters night. I was nervous about the balsamic vineger but I am glad that I tried it, it added a nice new flavor to the soup. The only thing I change was using veggie broth. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Awesome lentil soup.  I followed the recipe except used 2 fresh, ripe tomatoes instead of the canned crushed tomatoes, used my homemade chicken stock in place of the 8 cups of water, and sauteed spicy sausage in the pot before adding the onion.  Favorite lentil soup.  So flavorful!

I don't know what it is, but this soup just didn't do it for me.  It seemed to be missing something and just didn't have the taste to draw me in.  A little too dull on flavor for me.

Loved the recipe in general, but as some other reviewers said, it didn't have a lot of flavor, so I ended up adding a lot of my favorite spices. I think the end result was good, so I still gave it 4 stars.

This was such an easy to make soup, and the end result was really good. We are on a low sodium, low calorie diet, so this recipe fit the bill! Because I didn't add any salt, the soup was a bit bland. I looked around my kitchen cupboard and saw curry powder and cumin. Instant fix! It is so good with these additional spices, and still very healthy! Thanks for this one, it's definitely a keeper.

I thought this was a good soup. Tasty and healthy! After awhile I thought the lentils were a little over-powering, so I may try cutting those back a little next time and adding some barley too.

Great basic soup, lots of room for modifications! We swapped out celery for green beans, dried parsley for basil (what we had on hand) and diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes. Ended up using about 9 cups of water as we also added some diced red pepper to the mix. This very forgiving soup makes about 8 servings. I personally think it could benefit from more flavour. Perhaps adding some vegetable broth instead of some of the water? Either way the boyfriend loved it - and he's a meat and potatoes man!

the basis of this soup was spot on...i ended up using 3 fresh roma tomatoes instead of the crushed tomatoes (less sodium & more natural flavor). i also put in some oven baked turkey (last 10 minutes of cooking) from the night before and i added an extra cup of water. my husband and i like a kick in our soup so we added a few sprinkles of hot sauce when we served our individual portions.

Great recipe but I'd recommend adding chicken bouillon if you're not vegetarian to avoid having to add 5 lbs of salt.

Today I am making this recipe for the second time. The first time I made it the whole family loved it! Today I am short on spinach, but have added broccoli, mushrooms and potatoes. It's still simmering on the stove, but I have already done a taste test and it is delicious! Oh yes and I added more garlic, a pinch of cumin and a pinch of chili powder and lots of savory.  Thank you for this recipe. It will be a staple in my kitchen for years to come!

My husband who hates soup loved this soup, ate the leftovers without complaints and even asked for it a third day. I did add a beet with the onions for a little sneaky veggie addition and added kale instead of spinach.

I added some Cauliflower and one small red potato, cut in to small pieces because I had to use both of them up, and I loved it. I also had no crushed tomatoes, so i cut four Roma tomatoes up, heated them in the microwave, and went after them with the potato masher.  :)

A good basic recipe. I thought the spice proportions were fine, but it does need more depth, so using half beef or chicken broth and half water makes a great difference. In the end, I felt it still lacked something, so I read other lentil soup recipes and doctored it up with the following: 1/2 tsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp curry powder, a dash of soy sauce and dash of worcester sauce. Wonderful.

Delicious! I combined this recipe with another from an Italian friend of mine and added 1/2 a pound of Ditalini pasta. I also used 7 cups of broth instead of water and used 1/2 cup of sherry and the juice from the tomatoes for the rest of the liquid. I used ALOT of spinach, the chopped frozen kind. And at the end I added in about 1/4 cup of lemon juice and several Tbsps of Balsamic Vinegar. Served with crusty Artisan bread. Delish!

This is a fantastic recipe to use as a base for peple's own personal preferences. I've made it with very few changes, adapted it to make it spicier, adapted it to make a chicken and lentil soup, and overall, have used this recipe so many times that I could now do it with my eyes closed. Fantastic recipe, and great winter fare.  Much Kudos.

I thought this was just ok....followed the recipe exactly. I should have used chicken or beef broth instead of water for more flavor. I did use the granules but I don't think it helped much.

This recipe was amazing.  Reminded me of my favorite soup from Olive Garden, but I know this one is healthier.  I love that it is meatless, which I am trying to do more of.  You couldn't even tell because it is bursting with flavor!  Made it for my family and they loved it.  Will definitely make this one over and over.  Thanks!

So I wasn't paying attention to the reviews while cooking and added the 14.5 oz of stewed tomatoes, then for the "water" mixture I used a 28 oz can of either stewed or diced (don't remember), 2 cans up chicken broth and 2 cups of water. The soup turned out awesome! However, I think i'm beginning to figure out that i'm not that big of a lentil fan, i'm trying the soup with barley next time. Maybe cutting down on tomatoes, broth, and water to make it more stewy.

This was a great soup. I took many of the suggestions from others. I used veggie stock instead of water, and I had some roasted tomatoes so I used that instead of canned (and thus added more veggie stock to compensate). I also added red wine and pancetta, as well as balsamic. Overall a great, hearty soup and perfect for chilly days.

This soup is good.  It will likely take some tweaking to get the spices right for your family.  My son complained it was too spicy, even though I cut back on spices.  My husband really liked it.

This recipe was so easy and so super delicious! The balsamic vinegar added such a great background taste. I followed the recipe exactly and it was so filling and tasty that I will definitely add it to my recipe box.

I have never made, let alone eaten, lentil soup, but this recipe intrigued me, so one cold rainy day, I decided to make it.  Both my husband and I loved it!  After reading other reviews, I changed it up a bit - instead of water, I used a carton of College Inn Chicken Broth and a carton of College Inn White Wine & Herb Culinary Broth; I also added a 14.5 oz can of Italian style stewed tomatoes and a 14.5 oz can of crushed tomatoes; I added a packet of instant brown rice, and I doubled the seasonings; in addition, I used 4 medium sized carrots instead of 2; I also used frozen spinach instead of fresh and added it the soup during the last few minutes of cooking time.  This is an excellent soup.  You won't be disappointed with this one.

Very Good! I had split lentils on hand and it did take a little less time. I added the spinach individually to the bowl each time I had some to avoid the spinach turning mushy like previous reviewers suggested. This makes a good size pot of soup so prepare for leftovers! Love this soup and will make it a regular on my fall/winter soup rotation!

I cannot rave about this soup recipe enough - it is SO GOOD. It has all the necessary qualities that make a recipe good: healthy, easy, and easy to adapt to one's own tastes. I left out the vinegar since I didn't think it needed it and added lots of extra spinach and it was still terrific. I'll definitely make this one again.

I doubled the spices like people said, used 3 carrots and 3 celery, added a 1/2 tsp of cumin, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, and an extra tbsp of balsamic vinegar.  Delicious!

My meat eating husband really liked it, although he said it would have been a 5 star if I had added meat to it.  My 5 year old gobbled it up. I doubled the diced vegetables and spices and used 4 cans of chicken broth.  I served it with a bit of balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese in each bowl. with corn muffins on the side.  It was very filling.  The recipe makes a lot, there was enough that I now have 2 more dinners ready to go in the freezer for a family of 4.

i made this tonight and feel like it MUST get all 5 stars, especially with the help of some reviewers!! my big change was that i added mild italian sausage - i cooked the sausage in the pot and then pulled it all out and left just the grease and cooked the carrots, celery and onion in it - i also used 4C chicken stock and 2 C water and a full 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes (and then threw the sausage back in) and added about 8 small potatoes as well. i cooked this down for about an hour and a half. i used balsamic vinegar at the end as well -- i know i made a lot of changes (most from other review suggestions) but they are WELL worth it... i will make this all winter!!

Very tasty, but made changes due to what I had.  I used 1 onion, 5 carrots, 1/2 pkg turkey kielbasa sausage, jarred garlic, basil, 2 bay leaves, 4 potatoes, lentils, 2 small cans original Rotel (which gave it just a little heat), 12 cups of water and finally salt & pepper.  It was quite filling & very healthy!  My only complaint was that the carrots were a little too soft for my liking.  Next time I'll add them a little later.  I'll definitely be making this again during the cold winter months!  Thanks!

It was okay. Not enough vegetables and too many lentils, making it bland, in my opinion.  Also I had to add so many spices and salt to make it taste okay. Probably won't be making this again, but it is a decent base recipe.

I added 3 small roma tomatoes as well as some tomato paste prior to simmering.  I also added ~1/3c of slivered basil at the end since I had no spinach.  I like my lentils soft so I simmered it for an extra 20 minutes.  Great soup!

Great, healthy lentil soup! Each time I make it, I tweak it differently. This time I added rosemary instead of oregano, doubled the carrots to make up for not having celery on hand, added 1/2 jalapeno I had in my fridge, doubled the bay leaf, used half veggie broth half water, and all fresh tomatoes. To cut cooking time, after about 30 minutes I used my immersion blender to puree the soup. Then I let it simmer a couple of minutes more before serving. This method speeds it up and blends the flavors together very nicely.

This was really good!  We took another reviewers suggestion and used balsamic vinegar and it really added GREAT flavor.  We live in CO, so it may be the altitude, but I had to keep adding water and then adjusting the seasoning because our lentils weren't cooking as quick as the recipe said they should have, and that was kind of a pain, but like I said, it may be the altitude's fault.  Otherwise, great soup!

I worked in a Syrian reastaurant whan I was in uni, and they had a lentil soup that was far superior than this.  I wished I had learnt how they make it!  I doubled the spices and added two cans of tomatoes, subbed chicken broth for H2O, and used 3T lemon juice instead of vinegar.  The soup wasn't bad, but I won't be making it again.

loved it! A very healthy and delicious recipe. I didn't use all the oil called for and I also added mushrooms to the mix. You do have to season it to your liking. I never measure out seasonings. Just add until it tastes good to me!!

I really enjoyed this soup.  You can add whatever veggies you like.  I did use more stock than water, and lemon juice.  The next day I was staring at a spaghetti squash that I needed to use.  Ended up putting the soup over the "noodles".  Delicious!!

I made additions based on the comments here, and the soup turned out GREAT. I can't stop eating it. I added two Italian peppers (1 red, 1 green) for some heat, about 6 table spoons of red, Tuscan wine and one zucchini. *Non-vegetarians, this recipe is also good with just a little bit of beef stock, but great without, too. Love this soup!

Absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe word by word, did not change a single thing on it. I am from Hungary, we use milk in lentil soup, but I have to say it is so much better without it- and healthier of course. Thank You!!

What a great dish! I added more carrots, garlic, & celery to mine. We like meat so I also browned some spicy Italian sausage with the onion & garlic. I topped ours with parmesan & served with some sourdough bread. It was the best cold weather dinner.

Wonderful recipe.  Didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used a jar of salsa & replaced the water with a combination of vegetable & chicken broth.  It came out perfect!  Thanks, Marie, as this recipe is a keeper.

This was delicious!  I had never had lentils before and this was so good.  I had to use salsa instead of crushed tomatoes because it's all I had.  I left out the spinach because I forgot to buy it and I left out the vinegar because I just forgot to put it in.  Next time I'll definitely add the spinach and vinegar but it was wonderful without.

This recipe is fantastic! I made a couple changes to the recipe. I took out the celery and replaced it with a red bell pepper. I also added some chill pepper for a kick. I can’t wait to make it again!

Great soup!! I made this as first course to a big meal which was a mistake because this soup is a meal in itself. So filling and hearty I can't wait to make it again.

I thought it tasted a little "sweet" - maybe I will omit the carrots next time.  Really good texture and everyone else seemed to really like it.  I did double the spices.

I loved this recipe! I omitted the vinegar and spinach and added just a pinch each chili powder and cumin to give it a lightly spiced flavour. I also sauteed the veggies in bacon fat for an extra little kick. All in all...this recipe was GREAT and it makes SO MUCH!

Delicious and very healthy!  I did add 1 tsp salt at the end, and 1/4 tsp pepper.  It needed both.  For added flavor (and NOT so healthy), I tried omitting the olive oil and sauteing some diced bacon first until the bacon was crisp.  Then I removed the bacon with a slotted spoon and used the grease to saute the veggies.  I proceeded with the recipe as directed, and stirred in the cooked bacon again at the end.  YUM! Oh, and I subbed 4 cups of beef broth for 4 cups of the water too.

This was an excellent soup. Used double the amount of canned tomatoes, and did not use any spinach and it still turned out great.

4 stars because it needed a few extras for flavor.  I doubled the recipe and subbed canned vegetable broth for 1/3 of the water (all I had in the pantry - It could have used more).  I added an extra garlic clove. It also needed quite a bit of salt.  I left out the basil because I didn't have any and used a drained can of spinach.  I added the listed amount of vinegar and couldn't taste it at all. Added parm at the end and it was fabulous. I don't miss the basil.

I made this soup on a cold night, and it was awsome!  I didnt have spinach, so I left it out and the soup was still fab!  I also had 4 chicken thighs on hand, so i salt and peppered them, and put them in the bottom of the pot (after sauteeing the veggies) adn then added the lentils and liquids on top, adn let it simmer for a few hours.  The chicken fell right off the bone and the shredded chicken added a great flavor and texture!!  Highly recommended!!

A good base.  I omitted the oil (instead sweating the vegetables in a tablespoon of water), and the salt, for health reasons.  I substituted half of the water with celery and carrot juice -- it really pumps up the flavor, if you have a juicer!  I also substituted chopped curly kale for the spinach, and cooked it about 15 minutes in the soup.  To the seasonings, I added about a half cup of fresh chopped parsley, and some dried marjoram.  It came out very good, and won't last long!

A note on the salt -- we never thought food would taste good without salt, but your taste buds do adjust, and food tastes as good, if not better, now that we don't use it!

I absolutely loved this soup.  It was refreshing and healthy.  I did make some of the modifications suggested by other reviewers.  I used Balsamic vinegar, added a little lemon juice and doubled the spinach.   I doubled the recipe before I checked to make sure I had enough lentils.  I was short a cup of lentils so I added a can of cannelini beans at the same time I added the spinach and it came out awsome.  I think this would even be good with kielbassi or sausage chopped up in it.  Thanks for this recipe - I will make it again.

This is the first soup I've ever made & luckily it was a success. It was very easy to make & it was delicious. My boyfriend loved it too! A couple of changes I made: 1 tsp cumin, 1 lb chicken breast, balsamic vinegar. I will definitely be making this again & again!

I followed some of the advise from other reviews there, doubling the spices, a 28 ounce can of crushed tomaotoes, vegtable broth in place of water. In place of vinegar, I used half lemon juice, half balsamic vinegar. I added a small amount of fresh parm before serving. It was fantastic. Everyone loved it.

This was great. I made some changes to suit us. I used chicken broth and beer for the liquid and omitted the vinegar and spinach because my husband isn't a fan of greens. I also threw in a can of green beans and cooked some italian sausage with onions on the side for those who wanted meat in the soup. It was quite tasty. 

Next time I might try to give it a middle eastern flavor by adding cumin, curry and garbanzo beans. I really enjoyed this recipe and it was nice and simple.

I read some comments and used everyone's advice.  I added a big can of tomatoes, chicken stock, potatoes, cumin, and garam masala. I served it over coconut rice (fix the rice as usual except you substitute half the amount of water for canned coconut milk). Warm and hearty!!!

I made this on a whim, on a very cold night. I made it exactly as written, except I pressure-cooked it to cut the simmering time to 1/3. I like this recipe because all the ingredients are ordinary pantry staples and the resulting flavor is hearty and rewarding!

I have never eaten, much less made, lentils and this soup was a delicious first try!  I did use chicken stock instead, shiraz instead of vinegar and I used 2 C less liquid (my husband likes his soup more stewy).  For those who like their food extra spicy like we do, I substituted a fresh jalepeno for celery and fire roasted tomatoes for the crushed.  This made it smokey and spicy, just how we like it.  (I didn't add shrooms this time but I will next time.)

EXCELLENT!! The second time I made it, I used turkey stock instead of water and the leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  My family LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it. It was a nice change from a traditional turkey soup.

I have made this recipe twice now and both times it was fantastic.  We added the vinegar once it was in our soup bowls.  As suggested by others, I added chicken broth. It looked just like the picture. I will certainly make this again and again.  thanks.

Very tasty soup. I omitted the olive oil completely as another reader did and sauteed the onions and celery in broth. I didn't have any spinach but will add some next time.  This made a huge pot so I froze some in containers for next week. May try adding some Indian spices next time too.

This was a really tasty soup and I plan to make it again and again. I made a few changes, though. I omitted the olive oil and just cooked the onion and veggies together with the lentils to get rid of the high fat content. I also added a vegetarian vegetable broth bullion cube to up the flavor from the loss of the oil. I increased the lentils by 1/2 cup and used corn instead of the carrot because I was out of carrot. 

Lovely, filling soup that I truly adore. Thank you for posting it!

Great recipes, has to be the best lentil soup i've ever had.  I added a 28 oz. can of tomatoes and omitted the carrots and it was still good and a bit spicy.

Quite delicious, healthy, hearty and simple to make.  I added a bit more carrot and spinach for more veggies.  The vinegar (used balsamic) makes the soup tangy.

I loved this soup. It's a simple yet great recipe with loads of flavor. I added some fresh basil too. I also added a small potato cut into small cubes. And, instead of fresh spinach I used frozen and defrosted under cold water. Delicious!!!

Very hearty soup. Made the recipe as written, liked it. Then I added some personal touches. Some grilled turkey sausage,more fresh spinich, and added the rest of a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes I had opened for the recipe.I also kept adding splashed of red wine vinegar it really made the taste of the soup POP !

Delicious!  I'm not a vegetarian but I have been trying to have a meatless dinner at least once a week.  We really enjoyed this recipe. I used twice as much spinach but other than that didn't change a thing.  I will make this again.

This was very good.  Although, I did follow another commenter's suggestion and added a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, substituting some of the water for tomatoes; I thought this made it a little too tomato-y.  I also doubled the amount of spinach, which turned out well.  Overall, great recipe!

Only change I made was to saute my veggies in some prosciutto drippings and added that to the soup..very good, fast and economical to make. Be sure and serve with some crusty bread and I always top mine with a little cheese..can't go wrong with cheese..LOL

After trying lentil soup at a restaurant and loving it, I had to try to make my own. This was my first attempt making this recipe and I followed it exactly, except I halved everything (I was making it just for myself). It reminds me of chili, nice and hearty with a distinct tomato flavor. Next time I will up the amount of vegetables and spices, especially the cumin, and see how it turns out! Thanks a lot ^^

Very nice; ended up putting some pepperoni and sausages in; as well; give it a little more flavour; and ended up using chicken broth instead of water.  Used about 2 and a half cups lentils (to finish off the bag); and stirred baby spinach leaves into each bowl when I dished the soup out rather than adding it to the soup itself.  To make it a bit richer; I ended up stirring through a teaspoon or so of cream cheese to each bowl; as well.  Will likely make this again...

Very good; I used 2 c diced potatoes instead of the canned tomatoes and forgot the vinegar at the end. I'm sure it would be good with the vinegar.

I second the recommendation to add cumin (I added 1/2 t) and to use soup stock (I used chicken) instead of plain water. Some recommend doubling the spices, but I would only increase them by 50% or not double them. This is a great recipe once tweaked slightly--thanks:)

An excellent recipe for getting more lentils into your diet.  First time I just put all of the ingredients into a crock pot.  While good it was not nearly as good as taking the steps the recipe calls for.  My only let down was that I was expecting soup, but despite adding 2 extra cups of water it was still stew like.  My only other alteration was adding 4 chicken bullion cubes.  The leftovers are great on rice.

I'm not sure what others are seeing in this soup that I'm not. I felt that it was pretty bland and I had to add a lot of salt to make it taste better. I made it exactly according to the recipe but was very unimpressed. I added liquid smoke to some leftovers and that helped a little, but I won't make this one again.

Good soup. I used beef broth instead of water to add more flavor. Didn't have spinach but I did add some red pepper flakes which worked nicely.

Yum.  I substituted low sodium chicken broth for 4 cups of the water and omitted the olive oil.  This makes a LOT of soup!

I'm not crazy about lentil soup, but my boyfriend loved this.  I did leave out the vinegar because he doesn't like it at all.

I added the spinach after I served my daughter's portions (11 and 13) - I knew the floating green leaves would make them biased.  Everyone enjoyed the soup, and ate it all.  So nice to have an extremely healthy soup to serve.

I also added stock instead of water.  It is great...thanks Marie!

I was a little disappointed. I exactly followed the directions and it seemed like it was lacking flavor. I had to add a lot more spices. Now that I'm reading reviews it sounds like a lot of other people had to doctor it up too.

It was good, but nothing that special. 
I added some broth as recommended, and doubled the carrots and celery.
I'll make it again.

This soup is fantastic! It's the first lentil soup i've made and it rocks. I "doctored" it up a little, ie dry chilie peppers, chicken stock, and a splash of white wine and it turned out awsome.

This recipe as-is is great, but with a few adjustments it's amazing. Like many other reviewers, I used more veggies and herbs than called for the second time I made it. I also added about 2 tsp of cumin (I love cumin ;P). Most of the olive oil isn't really necessary, as it's just used to saute the veggies, and they get fully cooked with the lentils anyhow.
Great recipe, made it for family/friends and it's always a hit.

First time using lentils. Previous experiences include canned lentil soup. Let me tell you - there is a big difference. This recipe turned out surprisingly well despite my concerns. I substituted 4 c. vegetable broth instead of the water. A little cumin and extra spinach. I can't wait for tommorrow's leftovers. Thanks a lot for the recipe!!!

This was really good!  I found it was even better the next day, and straying from the vegetarian recipe... simmering the soup with fried bacon pieces was nice.

I've made this twice now, in one week :o)  The first time I thought I didn't like it.  I added extra carrots and celery and left out the tomatos because of a diet I'm doing.  Everything else was the same - used apple cider vinegar.  I was convinced I didn't like it though.  I put it in containers and let it sit over night...and the next day I had some and loved it!  Ate it up fast and had to make another batch.  I'm sure it'll be even better with tomatos, can't wait til I can have them again.  Hubby loved it too.

Oh only thing, I didn't boil it the second time as long as before, I felt the lentils were too mushy.  It was better the second time without mushy lentils.

Fantastic! I love lentil soup and this really hit the spot. I used fat free/low sodium chix broth instead of the water for more flavor. Used 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes with garlic instead of the crushed. Added a a leek with the other veggies that I sauteed in 2 tblspns of evoo. Omitted the spinach and added 1/2 sliced turkey kielbasa. Delicious!

I have never made anything with lentils, but this soup hit the spot tonight on this cold evening.  I did make the changes of only using 1 Tbsp. evoo and used green peppers instead of celery just because I had no celery.  Next time I'll use celery.  Very good, thanks!

This was okay. I made some changes and made some mental notes on how I would change it for next time. Because I am a vegetarian, I substituted the water with veggie broth, added more garlic, used only one tbsp. olive oil, and used one can Italian stewed tomatoes which I chopped up really small, and one can of crushed tomatoes. I used a whole box of frozen spinach since I love it and it is great for you. I also used the balsamic vinegar as others suggested. In the future, I will increase the amount of onions and garlic, as it was somewhat bland, and double the herbs.

Very hearty, healthy and easy to make soup.  I cut down the oil as per earlier reviews and it was just fine. I also added more or less of each kind of veggie according to our tastes.  As said earlier, it makes a very large batch, but was great for leftovers.  Only tiny critique is I would like a bit more flavour, so might fiddle with the spices a bit next time, but otherwise a keeper!

Just OK.  I had to add alot of liquid to keep it "soupy" and found it bland, even after increasing the seasoning.  But I am Cajun, so its probably just personal taste.

Lovely soup on a cold winter nite.  The only thing I did different was use pureed tomatoes instead of chunky ones. I did use a few flakes of chili pepper for a little zing and some fresh minced parsley for a fresh, bright colour.  Very healthy and hearty.

I have this soup in the 'simmer' stage.  Looks and tastes great!  The only mods I made were to use up ingredients on hand:  used a large can (28 oz) of crushed tomatoes; about eight ounces canned tomato sauce; about eight ounces canned beef broth, and then water to equal eight cups.  So my version will be a little more tomato-y than the original...  So easy; so healthy; can't wait!!

This was so yummy. I didn't have any spinach, but I added potatoes because I love them in soup. I also added salt pork for a little more flavor (but I cut off most of the fat) and a teaspoon of cumin. My boyfriend and I ate it for two days. Great with corn bread!

Tastes great! It is so filling because there is a lot of fiber and protein in it, but without all the fat and sodium that is in a meat based soup. Wow this is good. I will make it a lot. I also used balsmic vinegar, as suggested by the last reviewer. Good choice for fall/winter months because it doesn't require and spring/summer vegetables. Awesome for vegetarians, but non-vegetarians should not be afraid to try it just because there is no meat. Tastes great and healthy too. Expand your dinner options. Eat local seasonal food. You can do it!

This soup is very healthy, cheap, and yields plenty of servings! This is a comforting soup to eat during the cooler months of the year. I doubled the garlic because I LOVE garlic. I added 2 tsp. cumin seeds, and added chicken bouillon to the water so the broth wouldn't taste bland. I served this with cornbread.

Very good recipe.  I followed other posters suggestions and used chicken stock instead of water and it turned out great.  I also added shredded left over turkey from Thanksgiving and it was a nice addition.  Will definately make again

4 stars because it is a great basic recipe that could probably be enhanced with a few additional ingredients.  I cut back the oil to 1/8 cup as others had suggested.  And instead of 2 cups of lentils, I used 1 1/2 cup lentils and 1/2 cup pearled barley.  I used 2 tbsps. of balsamic vinegar.  I also added chard instead of spinach since I had some left over.  A little bland, yes, but you could easily remedy that with some extra salt or soy sauce.  My fiance said that it tasted wonderful sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  Or you could add meat.  I liked this simple and vegan, and it was wonderful - I will make it again.  Very filling!

This soup was GREAT! I froze half, but ended up thawing it the same week to eat more! The first night I made it I wasn't crazy about it, but the second day it was fabulous. Will make again and again.

Excellent recipe! We used two garden-fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes, and sprayed the veggies with cooking spray before sauteing to save on fat.  Otherwise followed the recipe verbatim.
Thanks!

I thought this was a fantastic, tasty and healthy meal.  I only used about 2 tbsp of Olive Oil, I don't think you need 1/4 cup.  I also browned two hot italian sausages in a skillet, then sliced and added to the pot along with the lentils to finish cooking.  And as well as many other people, I substituted chicken broth for the water and balsamic vinegar for white.  Brought it into work and had to dish out recipes.  Thanks, this is one for the cookbook!

DELICIOUS! my first attempt at lentil soup and it was a hit! i dissolved 1 chicken bouillon cube while it simmered (no need to add salt if you do this) and i added a dash of crushed red pepper to my individual serving.  this recipe is definitely a keeper!

For a "meat and potatoes" kind of guy this was surprisingly tasty. I added the cumin as others had suggested.  It tasted even better after a day in the fridge.

The vinegar is definatly what makes the soup.  I tasted it before adding it and was not impressed.  I also added chopped ham and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  Served it with cornbread.

We LOVE this soup!!  My husband asks when I am going to make it again!!  The only variations that we do is add more spinach and vinegar.  My husband likes to add hot salt to his for a spicy kick.  We usually eat it with garlic bread sticks.

This soup was easy to make, but lacked something and I'm not sure what should be added. I'm going to reheat it today and maybe add some more spices. It's good and I'll make it again with some additions.

Delicious!  This was my first time making lentil soup and it turned out great.  Everyone commented on how amazing it smelled as it was cooking.  The only alterations I made were adding an extra clove of garlic and ommitting the celery.

Excellent soup!  I wanted something kind of like Progresso's Lentil Soup and this was it.  I didn't have crushed tomatoes, so I used diced instead (could have blended them, but too much work).  Based on other reviews, I used vegetable broth and balsamic vinegar. Forgot to season with salt and pepper- but it didn't need it! My one year old and I loved it!

My husband really liked this recipe and said it could very well be his new favorite food.  Since it's just the two of us I went half on the water, used 4 vegetable bullion cubes, 1 cup of lentils, 3 small chopped up potatoes plus the rest of the ingredients. Over corn bread this a very good thick and hearty soup. The vinegar was defiantly a nice touch to throw in at the end.

This is THE BEST lentil soup recipe I have found. The only thing i did different was use a big can of chicken broth instead of the water... it was a little less than the liquid called for, but I like a thicker soup, so it was perfect for me. FABULOUS!!! Thanks for sharing.

Wow! This soup was fantastic. I made a few adjustments per other reviews. I used broth instead of water, added a 1/2 can of tomato paste, 4 cloves garlic, and 3 cups spinach. Everyone in the family enjoyed it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Meh.  Added lots of salt and one additional tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.

Yummy! I doubled the oregano and basil,  added some hot red pepper flakes and used balsamic vinegar.  It was perfect.  Thanks!

Good, but not super tasty. I opted to not add the spinach b/c I didn't have any on hand, but maybe the spinach is the kicker for this recipe!

I made this for my family who are not the biggest lentil fans...and it was a hit (even with my 16 month old daughter!).  I didn't add the spinach or vinegar and it tasted fine.  I have made it twice now, and the first time it seemed to have much more flavor.  I'm wondering if it is due to the fact that i used a no name brand of crushed tomatos this time?

Excellent!  I added a small tomato paste to it and it was delicious.  I don't know whether it needed it or not.  It probably did not make much difference.

This tasted amazing! It even got the thumbs up from my mother and restored her faith in  my cooking skills :o) One tiny alteration though: I added about 2 cups of chicken broth at then end as it was just a wee bit too thick. Next time I may also add 1cup of spinach instead of 1/2.

This is SO yummy.  I didn't add the spinach (I only had frozen, then I forgot last minute to add it).  It was great, anyhow!  We gave a bunch away, and still had leftovers a few times! YUM!  Great with homemade bread too!

What a wonderful soup!  Didn't add the spinach (didn't have any).  Also, I only added 6 cups of water, and that seemed plenty.  It makes a lot, so I have some put in the freezer for a cold winter's day.

Great recipe!  I decreased the olive oil to 1T, added a bag of frozen peas and carrots (separated and added the peas the last few minutes of cooking), 23.5 ounces of crushed tomatoes, 8 C chicken stock, and corizo sausage cut into 1/2" cubes.  Did not add vinegar or spinich.  It was really good!  After a day in the refrigerator, it became stew-like - all the better.  Thanks so much for an easy, tasty soup.

Good soup.  I would leave out the carrot next time, or possible grate just a small amount of it instead.  I added 1 pound smoked sausage cut into coin sized pieces.  We served this over corn bread.  Keeper.

Easy recipe but I did use chicken stock instead of water and added two red potatoes and some smoked sausage as others have suggested.  My husband would have liked it with pasta and my son wouldn't touch it.  I thought it was good but beware that this recipe makes a lot of soup!

Nice thick soup. Added smoked sausage and potatoes,Old Bay seasoning,28oz tomatoes,and can of beef broth. Instead of vinegar I used some hot sauce. Simmered 3 hrs on low. Can't wait to sit down and eat a bowl of it.

This soup is great with cornbread! I make a pot on Sunday and eat it all week for lunch. My only addition is some hot sauce while I'm eating it, as it is slightly bland. But, very filling and satisfying!

Very good lentil soup.  I put the three garlic cloves into the soup whole and removed them before serving.  I added balsamic vinegar rather than white vinegar and enjoyed the result, but next time I will eliminate the vinegar.  Thanks for a good soup recipe.

A nice, meatless soup that is full of healthy veggies and carbs.  For those not needing a vegetarian soup, I think that replacing some of the water with chicken broth would greatly improve the flavor.  We enjoyed it most with a sprinkling of asiago cheese.

This soup was rediculously good, and easy.  I used 9 cups chicken broth, no carrots (detest those), no spinach, doubled the garlic, and garnished with italian parsley, parmesan, and a bit of balsalmic vinegar.  Wow that was good, and cheap (for those living on a buget...)

Exactly what I was looking for!!!!  My whole family loved this recipe...even my 3 and 1 year old.  I left out the tomatoes and used chicken stock instead of water.  This recipe is definitely a keeper- It was so yummy and really easy to make.

This is great!

Like many reviewers suggested, I used chicken stock instead of water. As well, I added a bit of cumin and dried crushed chilis. I didn't add the spinach and vinager at the end because I liked it the way it was!

Excellent recipe!!  I skipped the vinegar and spinach as it tasted fine already.  I did have to add more water since the lentils soaked up much of the broth.  I added a couple of chicken bouillion cubes and some chopped ham.  Very, very tasty!

Success! My daughter has been vegetarian for 3 months. This is one of her favourites. Didn't change much added a bit of paprika and served it with garlic and herb croutons. Definitely going to be a long serving recipe in my house. Even the meateaters gave it a thumbs up. Thanks Marie
