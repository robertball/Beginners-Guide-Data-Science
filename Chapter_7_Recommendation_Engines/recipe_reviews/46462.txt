First, I live in Texas so our scale of what's hot is different from others.  Hummus is my Spring 2007 perfection recipe (I keep making it until I get the perfect one- and then take it to all the parties and and bask in the compliments).  I was thrilled to find a hummus recipe that added jalapenos (texas, in search of the perfect hummus....).  I love this recipe.  I did add more jalapenos and more lemon juice, double what the recipe called for, but that was due to our regional preferences.  

Big Tip: Make it ahead of time and let it sit in the refrigerator overnight.  That's the secret that makes this recipe go from good to great.  

Thank you Andrew for posting this recipe.  You just proved that any recipe can be made even better by "spicing it up" with the right ingredient.

Best hummus ever.  You can make it with or without the curry - I like it without, my husband likes it with.  Totally outshines all my friends hummus that they have been making for years.  We will never buy hummus again.  
UPDATE: We've beek making this for a while now.  First, you have to add tahini, it's not really hummus without it.  Second, if its too thick, add some of the bean water from the garbanzos.  Third, I still like it better without the curry and don't be stingy with the cumin!  Fourth, I usually make this in batches of 6.  You should too.  It keeps for a while and it's just to die for.  Make it for a party, put out half of it, if that goes put out more, and if you have some left at the end, use it for sandwiches or eat it as a snack with carrot sticks. Fifth, fresh jalapenos are awesome in this.

SOOOOOOOOO good!  I got so many compliments and everyone wanted the recipe!  I didn't use the curry powder since I didn't have any but it was still amazing!  I also added 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley - it looks pretty this way!

This is an awesome recipe.  Since I didn't have tahini, I used toasted sesame seeds..(which is what tahini is made from) and it worked fine..I have a VitaMix, so the sesame seeds were completely ground up.  Also adding a few slices of Red Bell Pepper gives it a nice color.

WOW! I have been making my own hummus for 3 years, ever since I first tried it at a traditional Greek restraunt. This is my first time trying to make a flavoured kind of hummus and it is amazing! I doubled the recipe to make for a party and I can't wait to take it there. I had a hard time not eating all myself just now. I decorated it with crushed pepper flakes and sliced jalapenos on top! Looks great, wonderful creamy consistency and amazing taste! Thank you for this recipe!!

The base recipe is a little bland to our taste, but is a good start.  We did the following to spice it up a bit and feel it could use even more:

1 tsp curry
1 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp salt
4 cloves garlic
4 tbsp lemon juice
1/4 cup fresh cilantro

Super easy to make. Follow the recipe and use canned jalapenos.  We used fresh and the hummus was dry.  About 1 tbs. of olive oil fixed the dryness.

Wonderful and so tasty hummus!  Only addition I made was throwing a handful of chopped cilantro in the food processor.  I absolutely love this!  Glad I doubled the batch!

Really good. I used 1 fresh, seeded jalapeno, which worked out fine. I omitted the curry powder since I didn't have any. The crushed red pepper and cumin are a great finishing touch.

This was very good!  I did not have the tahini, but it tasted great without it.  I will definitely be making this again, but I may add a few less peppers next time, as it was a bit too hot for me!

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have tahini, so I substituted with peanut butter and a small amount of sesame oil.  I also didn't have curry powder, so I used a dash of ginger, dash of cloves, and 4 dashes of turmeric (which also added a nice color).  I used fresh jalapenos from my garden, roasting them in the oven first.  I should have deseeded them...it was HOT!!!  Also, I used lime juice instead of lemon.    Basically, you can make this recipe with what you have at home.  It's easy to follow.  Substitutions work well.   And, it is really, really, really good!!

okay I'm not a supporting member so I can't customize; but this is a great starter for making your own version. I added sun-dried tomatoes, calamata olives, fresh parsley, a dab of habanero sauce. Used fresh jalapeno and a touch of red wine vinegar to moisten. No curry powder. Juice of 1-1/2 lemons, 1 can garbanzos. Had to put a lid on the container, stick it in the fridge and leave the kitchen before I ate it all right on the spot

I love this recipe!  It is so easy to make and full of flavor.  The jalapeno gives it that extra kick that puts this above other hummus recipes.  And yes, if you can't find it you can replace the tahini with peanut butter!  I used 2 tbs of the natural peanut butter (chunky) so it's not extremely sweet and 1 tbs of sesame oil to give it a little of the sesame taste.  It works beautifully!

Everyone loved this at the party that I brought it to.  I put the hummus on top of cucumber slices and topped that with a cherry tomato half.  I would have preferred a little less curry powder.  I also would have preferred a bit smoother texture.  I used a food processor, but next time I will try the blender.

LOVE THIS! I've been getting the Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus from Whole Foods but now I won't have to - homemade is just as good! Followed recipe pretty much as is with 2 exceptions - only used 1 Tbsp of Tahini, added  1Tbsp of Olive Oil to make it more creamy.  Blended and then added extra Jalapeno, Cilantro, Red Pepper Flakes until it was to taste for me.   Thank you for this one!

Yummy indeed!  I used 1/3 cup of fresh jalapenos and 1 Tbsp of the Garbonzo juice to prevent dryness.    What a wonderful spread!

I never follow a recipe exact but look for inspirations instead. This is the best hummus I've had EVER! I do not use the curry and I just play around with the other ingredients in my food processer until I get the results I like. It's always a huge hit at any gathering. Oh, I only use like a tsp of tahini per can. Not as smooth consistency but the flavor is great and lower in calories. Awesome recipe!!!!

My son said this is the best hummus he has ever had. I used one can, which is basically doubling the recipe. I added more garlic and cumin, and put in some roasted red peppers. I didn't use as much Tahini as it called for...I added and tasted until I liked the flavor...I did add a quick dash of sesame oil for extra flavor and topped with crushed red pepper flakes.

This was my first attempt at making hummus.  I've never been pleased with store bought, but I always enjoy restaurant hummus.  This  recipe was great!  Definitely nothing like I've tasted before but I enjoyed it very much.

We didn't really care for this recipe. I used fresh jalapenos, and instead of tahini I drizzled in some dark sesame oil. It was kind of bitter. I think I will stick to traditional hummus.

Great flavor, just a little on the dry side. Perhaps add a touch of olive oil next time to make it more creamy.

As with most recipes I added more garlic. To make it smooth, I added a good bit of olive oil.

So, so awesome. I used a whole can of beans, drained, and about 3 Tbs of lemon juice - just hate to see a good lemon go to waste - and a bit more jalapenos, and omitted the curry powder as i was out. Next time I'll add it in, but hard to imagine it can be any tastier than it is now! Many thanks for posting!

I skipped the tahini (none on hand) and used fresh minced jalapeno from my garden instead of canned. This came out delicious and was gone the next day!

good but VERY hot.  if you can't take the heat then leave out some of the japs or their juice or just use mild japs.  i add about a table spoon or so of olive oil as its blending to give it a creamier texture and it's good.  just like what you get at the store.

Made this but I used dry garbanzo beans that I soaked over night, removed the hulls and cooked to fork tender in a crock pot.  It was a lot of work and recommend using canned for easy cooking.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious

We liked this. Well, my husband did; I don't really eat it. A standard can of garbanzos is 1.5 cups, so you can size the recipe to 12 to use up your whole can. Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty and easy to follow. I was unsure about the jalapenos (still learning how to use them) so I used about half the recommended amount, thinking I could add more to taste. Good call, because at half-power it was still a pretty exciting food (one adult could not bear it). As written, this recipe will be pretty hot, so just keep your audience in mind. :-)

Wow - was this terrific!  It has a great kick and the flavors are so pronounced.  I omitted the curry, as I am not a big fan and  used a little olive oil while blending to help smooth out the consistency.  In addition, I threw in some roughly chopped cilantro and the hummus took on a lovely green color.  So fresh, no preservatives, and healthy!  Superior to anything purchased in a store.  Thanks for a great recipe, Andrew!

Great recipe.  I only added 1/4 cup of jalapenos.  I did not have tahini so I toasted sesamee seeds and blended with a little olive oil.

This is so good! I can't stop eating it! I doubled the recipe and it made about 2 cups. I rinsed the beans. Per other reviews, I added fresh cilantro. I also didn't have curry (and don't care much for it) so I left that out. I love that this doesn't call for olive oil. It's really good the next day when the flavors sit.

This is a great recipe!! I've tried other hummus recipes from this site but this was the best!! I used 2 fresh jalapeños so since I didn't have the juice from the canned peppers I added some olive juice and slowly blended in water from the chickpeas until it was creamy. I also added salt.

This recipe is simple and spicy-good. I used organic garlic which makes a big difference in flavour. I used 1 fresh jalapeno instead of canned. It was quite hot but yummy.

Just made this recipe. Made it as-is, no changes. I've made several hummus recipes previously and have been very disappointed. This most definitely did not disappoint. It was way better than store bought and just as good as any restaurant I've tasted. It didn't make very much so I'm glad I doubled it.

I really liked it, but with modifications: mine needed a tad salt and also there was too much juice in my chiles, and it made it runny. Also, all that curry made it bitter, which I thought could use a little sweet to offset it. Maybe softened dates or raisins? Even honey?

I thought this tasted too much like tahini. Mine was also a little runny, so I would save the juice from the beans and add as needed instead of dumping everything in right away. I like the fact that it is jalapeno flavored, so I will make it again, just with a few adjustments.

I made this for a work party and for friends and it was good. I wanted something more than just the jalapenos flavor the second time I made this, so I added 1/4 c of crushed pineapple. Even better!

My husband was excited to see jalepenos going into the hummus, but after smelling the curry, he wouldn't touch it. I love curry, but I don't think it really belonged here. I may try it again without the curry, I do love the jalepeno.

This is SO good.  I used a fresh jalapeno because that's what I had on hand but soon I'll make another batch with a canned jalapeno and I bet it will be amazing.  I saved the chickpea juice to add a little at the end for perfect consistency, and also added a little olive oil.  YOU SHOULD TRY THIS!!

Absolutely the best hummus!  But make it the night before, I thought it improved tremendously.  I didn't use the crushed red pepper, it was pretty darn hot with the 1/2 c jalapenos. Love this stuff!

One of the best hummus dips I have ever tried.  The subtle hints of curry and cumin mixed in with the jalapeno flavour is fantastic.  Would make a great restaurant menu item!

I used fresh garbanzo beans, replaced the tahini for olive oil and substituted curry powder for chili powder being that I did not have those 2 ingredients at hand.  I made this as an appetizer for my dinner party.  Everyone who liked spicy food said it was delicious! I also took some to my church members who all enjoyed the hummus and asked for the recipe.

Followed the recipe pretty accurately, except I used Thai curry paste instead of dry Indian curry and I probably poured too much pickled jalapeno juice in since the ingredients were getting stuck in the blender, but it was pretty good and very spicy! I made this in the Vitamix and it was very smoothly blended.

This was really good, but it definitely needs a little salt.  I didn't use canned jalapenos because we had a ton in the freezer.  I just measured out the same amount and put them in the blender whole, with a little water in place of the juice, and it worked great!  It was just spicy enough.  My husband loves spicy stuff and I like it, but not quite as spicy as he does, and it was just the right balance so that we were both happy with it.  Also, I was out of curry powder but I had some Thai red curry paste in the fridge and used that instead, but I don't think that made much difference to the recipe.

This is a yummy recipe. Very easy & tasty. ...I doubled the spices because I like lots of flavor & I substituted Lime juice for Lemon. Had to add about 3 tbsp toasted sesame oil because it was too dry.

Very yummy!  Made this without the curry powder, as I didn't have any.  Just added some more jalepnos and juice to amp up the spice factor.  Even my picky husband who isn't a big hummus fan enjoyed this.

This stuff is amazing. Do yourself a favor and make it! I used a little bit of the liquid from the garbanzo bean can and a whole (seeds and all) fresh jalapeno instead of the canned jalapenos. I like things really, really spicy so next time I might add two instead. It is soooo good. I almost ate all of it myself!

I made a few alterations, but overall a super recipe!  Since I had 15oz cans of garbonzo beans I used two cans of garbanzo beans with only 1/2 cup of the juice.  I used 5 tablespoons of lemon juice, 1 tsp curry, 1 tsp cumin, 3 tbls tahini and 1 1/2 jalepenos, 3 cloves of garlic and 1 tsp of sea salt.  I like my hummus spicy.

Wonderful and sooo easy!!!  I used a whole can of garbanzo beans (close to two cups), a little more than a teaspoon of each spice, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, 5 tablespoons tahini, eyeballed the jalapenos and juice (did not need to had red pepper at all) and I always add more garlic than any recipe calls for...most ingredients are always on hand so why bought the store bought?!

OMG, WOW!  This is the best! The only change was I doubled the FIRST batch.  I made 3 batches and frozen in party portion size.  Best part is to wait 24 hours to eat and definitely ADD cilantro. You don't like cilantro, use  parsley.  I made both and everyone loves them each individually.  THANK YOU!

Very nice versatile recipe for hummus that can be modified to suit any taste.  I first made as suggested, but my own personal tastes dictate just a few changes.  No tahini, less lemon juice, addition of a little olive oil for smoothness, a little more cumin and about 50% more jalapenos.  Wonderful.

Delicious and simple recipe.  You'll never feel the need to buy a prepared one again!  I made a couple adjustments that we found matched our preference for hummus.  We used fresh jalapenos and in place of the canned juice, we added olive oil.  I found that I enjoyed the silkiness of the texture.  We too, left out the curry but instead added some cilantro.  That made it epecially delicious if you are a cilantro lover like we are.  Terrific hummus and oh so easy.

Curry + Jalapenos = Pure Awesomeness. I'm not a fan of canned jalapenos, but CRAZY about fresh ones, and always make sure I have at least 20 fresh jalapenos on hand in my kitchen. Seeded and finely chopped up a few for this recipe, and oh man, was it good! Though I only recommend using fresh if you can handle the spiciness; it's a huge difference!

great, easy hummus!  Healthy too, because it doesn't require olive oil.

This is a great recipe - there is only one other thing that makes it better - add cilantro.  Since cilantro can be a bit overpowering start with just a little and go crazy from there to your liking.  Jalepeno's and cilantro are a must do - for a  Yum Yum Triple Yum result.

I'm giving this five starts.  If you make the recipe as is, it's a good "twist" on hummus but still tastes like hummus.  If you are looking for some REAL Jalapeno and Cilantro hummus that doesn't taste like regular hummus, add about a 1/3 cup of fresh cilantro and use any where between 1/2 cup and 2/3 cup of jalapenos.  I did everything else as is, minus the curry powder and it was great!

I must have done something wrong because my initial try was really dry.  My guess is that I didn't add enough jalapeno juice.  So I added olive oil and that fixed the problem.  It was good when it was first mixed but much better when it had sat in the refrigerator for a while.  The flavors really came together.

Excellent! I've been looking for a jalapeno hummus recipe. They were all wimpy. I made this for a party a few weeks ago, stuck a "caution" sign in it, and it was the hit of the evening. I added about 1/3 more jalapenos, a little less tahini and garlic, and I think I will add less curry powder next time. Superb! Thank you for this amazing recipe!

Outstanding hummus recipe. We ended up cutting the recipe down a bit and it came out crazy spicy with basic conversion so we just tossed in a few more chickpeas and awesome flavor explosion ensued. Thanks!

WOW,   this is Superb!! I toasted raw sesame seeds then crushed with mortor & pestle. Couldn't find Tahini.  (this is great in place of.) Use 3 Tbls. of it. I used one 4"long Jalapeno sliced with seeds in. 3 Tablespoons lemon juice. Added a little of the Garbonzo bean juice to the mixture and some olive oil to make the consistency perfect, since I didn't  use canned Jalepenos. Used 1 whole 15.5oz can of the beans...about 11/2C. Followed the rest of the recipe. SOOOO delicious.   Thank you Andrew!

I thought it was just okay. The taste of the curry didn't seem to balance well with the jalapenos, and next time I'll replace the curry with fresh chopped cilantro.

This was my first time making hummus and all I have to say is yum.  What I would suggest is letting the hummus sit for at least a good 4-6 hours, if not over night.  I would also highly suggest mincing the garlic and chopping the garbanzo beans ahead of time to achieve the creamy texture.  I didn't do this the first time and my hummus came out a bit lumpy.  I did add some evoo to help smooth it out though.  I also added some nice kosher salt, fresh cracked peppers, and twice the amount of lemon juice.  Without the last alterations, the recipe would have lacked something.

For my flavor, you need much more jalapeno than this recipe calls for.  We ended up using about 5 garden grown jalapenos to spice it up and it turned out great this way.

The recipe was great..but i think i missed something somewhere because it seemed like it needed salt and i'm not a salt person it was just a little bland.. so i added about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt more cumin and some paprika and it's perfect !!!

It came out a bit runny, may want to reserve some of the juices at first and add them in slowly.

I think next time I'll skip the curry powder. Otherwise this was fine. I used a fresh seeded jalapeno pepper.

I used fresh jalepeno instead, and had to add a little olive oil, but it was great!! let it sit overnight if possible--it really brings out the flavor!

I can't tell you how many times I have fixed this hummus, and it is always a hit.  I just zing everything together in the food processor, so it is super quick to make.  I've started keeping the ingredients on hand, so I'll always have this quick-to-make dip.  It is also good served with carrots and celery sticks.

I used canellini beans because I had them on hand and omitted the tahini because I didn't. Great flavor right away and even better the next day. Great dip for pita chips.

This is my first experience with hummus. I had no idea it was made out of garbanzo beans. For some reason, the word "hummus" made me think of animal intestines. Well, it is far better than any animal intestines could ever be. I did not have any tahini, so I blended sesame seeds with olive oil instead. I also used the whole can of garbanzos. I would not add more canned jalapenos, as the flavor would overpower everything else. My husband, a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy, said, "Yum! What is that?!!! He looked appalled when I replied, "Hummus," but he wanted some more anyway. This would be a great appetizer for any crowd.

This was great! My husband and I decided it tasted better than store bought hummus and is a lot less expensive. I'll be making my own from now on. Thanks for the recipe.

Creamy and delicious!  I made this with pinto beans because that's what I had.  I would have sworn the finished dip was sour cream based, it was that creamy and flavorful.  The dip is great on pretzels, chips, crackers, veggies - everything!

YUMMY!  I'm recently new to the hummus scene...trying to add healthy things to my diet.  I purchased the store bought kind and it was ok, but I thought maybe homemade would be better and boy was I right!  This was so good!  I will make again, for sure!

THE BEST!  I used a whole can of chick peas but followed the rest of the directions to the letter. Our local store stoppped carrying a jalapeno hummus and I looked this up to make it myself.  Better than store bought. Will make again and again.

Very yummy. Made as written with a reduction in jalapeño to 1/4 cup. Have some light weights coming for dinner. Heat level is about a three aka mild, but flavorful. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I have never been a hummus fan but it shows up often on the "Daniel Plan".  This was my first attempt and I was going for flavor.  I used diced jalapeno's rather than sliced.  It was the best I have tried, but it did have a lot of heat.  Cut the peppers down by at least 1/4 if you are not into hot dips.  Bonus!  All ingredients fit in my Magic Bullet mini blender.  So no mess.

I made this as directed, but it didn't have a lot of flavor. Eventually, I doubled the lemon juice, added 1/2 tsp of salt, and then it became average. It was nothing special, and I was really hoping for more.

So very good! I have made it twice thus far! I tried it first with no tahini and olive oil instead -  it’s what I had on hand. The tahini makes it much smoother and it’s very good!

I made the base recipe.  I wasn't sure about the canned jalapeños, but had some, so I used them.  I decided to substitute 1 tbsp of lemon for lime juice.  I added some garlic powder, chili powder, cayenne, and some salt to taste.  It turned out great!  We ate the entire thing in one sitting!

This is good - but not spicy. I think the expectation is that this will be spicy but it's really not. It just has a great flavor and a good texture to it. I'd make this again!

I couldnt find jalapeno hummus in our local grocery stores so decided to make it myself! Easy and excellent. I doubled the recipe and used a 16 ounce can of garbanzo beans, only 5 tablespoons of tahini(since I've never used the spice before)doubled all the other ingredients. Since we like spicy foods added crushed red pepper and jalapenos. So much cheaper than buying it in the store.

3.12.18  I used my homemade pickled jalapenos and didn’t quite have the amount specified in the recipe, so  I just added more crushed red pepper flakes.  I’m a fan of Madras curry powder and I’m out right now, so I used another curry powder I had in the spice cabinet which didn’t quite measure up.  Still, all in all, this is a good hummus recipe,    Hummus is so quick, easy and inexpensive to make I cease to be amazed at the money people pay to buy it.  Served with Perfect Pita Chips also on this site.

This is the recipe that made me a fan of allrecipes.  It is excellent!!! I stopped buying premade hummus once I found this recipe.  The heat is perfect - but not necessary for taste.  You can use less and it will still be tasty.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I used the entire 15 ounce can of garbanzo beans (drained) and all the other ingredients.  I added a dash more curry and cumin and a pinch of salt.  I served the hummus with carrots and pita bread.  Delicious!

Great recipe
Since I had 4 cups of beans, I had to make adjustments, otherwise would have followed.
I omitted the jalapenos only because I'm the only one who prefers heat, and will add later.  For the 4 cups of garbanzos, I used  3 tsp Cumin, 1 tsp Curry and added lemon and tahini ingredients X4 But - I used only 2 X the garlic.
3 Tbsp EVOO smoothed it, since I had tossed the liquid

Because we like salt, I added 1 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp black pepper.

I cooked dried garbanzo beans in chicken broth and roasted 3 fresh jalapeños, then used cooking liquid to reach the correct consistency in the blender.  This came out perfect!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Found husband and daughter inhaling this for breakfast this morning. Hubby tried it when I made it and declared he wasn't sharing it with our 13 and 17 year olds so he hid it in the back of the fridge. Stumbled out of bed this morning (Saturday) to find husband and 13 year old fighting over it. Making more tomorrow.

Wow this was great! I used a whole jalapeno with the seeds, and extra red pepper flakes. I would have used curry but I didn't have it. It was so creamy with the perfect amount of spiciness. Delicious!

Love it.  Up here in Alaska we like to get our heat however we can!  I 'skinned' the chickpeas before they went in the food processor.  Just pick 'em up and pinch--it comes right off. Seems to allow for a creamier consistency.  I didn't have any curry, so I subbed coriander.  Used one fresh jalapeno instead of the pickled ones, used 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3, and 1/4 ground red pepper, as that is what I had.  Also added 1 tbsp chili oil and 1 tbsp of olive oil.  Used about 1/3 of the bean juice, and 1 tspn of balsamic vinegar in addition to the lemon juice.  Came out wonderfully creamy, not gritty, and will 'set up' nicely overnight in the fridge.  Nice light color that easily garnished for serving with whatever suites your fancy.  Thanks for a great one!

Do I hear a harp and tinkling bells?  Am I in Heaven?? Followed the recipe exactly and I'm so glad I didn't leave out the curry, it is absolutely divine. If I could do a back flip I would be doing them right now.

Huge hit with everyone at work today!  I made using all the listed ingredients, but I used two fresh jalapeños in place of the jarred. Although, I did use the juice from the jarred version.  Served it with guacamole tortilla chips and crackers.

Hot - this is super spicy!!  For our family that's fine, but I couldn't serve this to most of our friends. With the curry and cumin, would be great paired with an Indian dish and some naan.  I drained the garbanzo beans and used most of the reserved jalapeno juice.  When first made, we'd give it a 5, but downgraded it to a 3 because it gets too chalky and thick when chilled.

Homemade hummus is so much better than store bought. This is a very good recipe and taste better if given a day or two to "season".

DELICIOUS! I made this for a work potluck, and it was a huge hit. The spice level is perfect, and I love the added layer of flavor from the cumin & curry powder. Wouldn't change a thing - GREAT recipe.

Great hummus.  I used fresh jalapenos, extra garlic, and no curry as we didn't have any.  Instead of tahini I used toasted sesame oil and sunflower seed paste, again because we didn't have any on hand. Oh, the lemon juice was fresh squeezed as well.

This turned out AMAZING! Being my first hummus attempt I was a little worried but it was fantastic. I used a jar of jalapenos as I was a bit lazy to get fresh, I had no tahini so I left it out and leaving it overnight in the fridge is the best thing you could do. I made this for my friends and they went nuts over it... it was declared the best hummus ever, so much in fact that my friend took it off the table and kept it by him. I shall make this again and again :)

I give this a 5 star cause it's very flavorful and really easy to make. One mistake I had, I picked up Chick pea's instead of garbonzo beans and it still turned out wonderful. Might try adding more peppers next time, but that's just a personal prefrence. Thanks for the recipe..it's a keeper.

This was easy to make and delicious! I had a little trouble with my blender chopping the garbanzo beans, but I think it's cuz it's my mom's blender and is older than I am! I added in sliced mushrooms and some cinnamon for a bit more texture to the flavor! SO GOOD!! Definitely recommend this for the spice of the jalapeno is downplayed by the creaminess of everything else!

Very good recipe. Was a little spicier then I like but took it to a gathering and it vanished so fast! I loved it with the chedder triscuits we had, the others preferred the other flavored triscuits, but the flavors kinda added to it.

WOW!  This hummus rocks!  It's got a nice heat that stays with you for a while.  I may have used too much jalapeno juice and I threw the seeds right on in the mix too, but I'm not complaining by any means!  I'm sure it will be even better once it sits overnight.

Excellent!! I doubled the lemon juice, curry and cumin and thought it was delicious. Didn't have any jalapeno's in the house, but will try adding them next time.

This recipe was great.  Very easy to make and everyone loved it at the potluck I took it too.  The second time I made it I used started with dried garbanzo beans and had to add just a little water when blending to get the same creamy consistency.

I'm eating this right now, and it's very good! I decreased the amount of tahini to 2 tablespoons and used a bit less jalapeno, and elminated the curry. This turned out pretty spicy, and I'll definitely make it again!

This is an amazing recipe! I don't think I could go back to eating regular hummus.  It has a kick to it that keeps you wanting more. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves hummus and wants to try something awesome.

Sooooo much better than store-bought hummus! Makes a tasty sandwich spread and adds some fiber too. Pretty spicy as is - in my opinion, would have been too hot with red pepper flakes.

This is by far the best hummus that we have tried!! I've tried others that were O.K., but tasted like they were missing something. This recipe is perfect! I had to sub lime for lemon juice (i was out) and it still turned out delicious (I also used a whole can of chickpeas)! Thanks for sharing such a tasty hummus recipe- we now have a new favorite!!

Great recipe! We thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was very quick and easy. Unless you are a huge fan of curry, you might want to cut the amount of curry in half; maybe even more.

As tempting as it is, this hummus tastes even better after sitting for a little bit to let the flavors get to know each other.

AWESOME!!!  I'm a huge hummus fan and I love it. However, my husband doesn't really like hummus and he loved it as well.  I used more jalepenos b/c we love spice and it surely kicked it up a notch :)

Spicy goodness! I adore hummus and this is great with the added jalapeno kick. The addition of 1/4 teaspoon of salt was my only alteration. I will definitely make this again... thank you for the recipe!
