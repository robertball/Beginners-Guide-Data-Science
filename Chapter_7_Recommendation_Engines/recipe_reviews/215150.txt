So awesome but a little runny. I used strawberries, peaches and apples. If I could make one suggestion it would be to not add any water. Once reduced the fruit has tons of liquid all on it's own.

I divided the recipe in half to fit in my 8x8 baking dish. Instead of graham crackers, I doubled the oats, but ground them up a little bit using a food processor. I only had about 5 very ripe plums, so that's all I used. My boyfriend said it was the perfect amount of crust and fruit, and that he couldn't even tell it was plums! He said it tasted like apples, and asked me to make it again with both plums and apples next time! Delicious...

This is really good.  I use Splenda instead of white sugar though.  It still tastes great.

Very quick and easy to make, I cut back on the sugar and it was still plenty sweet and very good.  Like having an oatmeal cookie on top!
