This recipe will be good by making the following changes: eliminate all the water; just cook the rice in the broth.  Cut amount of peas in half; after rice is cooked mix cheese in throughout.  Sprinkle even more cheese on top with cracker crumbs.  Very easy to make, tastes good, and healthy.

I agree with the last reviewer--what is with all that water??  If I bother to make this again, I would completely eliminate the water and cook the rice in the chicken broth.  Also, there are far to many peas, I would rather a pea and carrot mixture in this.  The cheese needs to be spread through the dish, not just on top.  And I think I would drizzle some melted butter over the crushed crackers.

This recipe sucks and needs some help! 6 cups of water!!! WHAT, well dont use that much unless you want your rice floating. The cheese needs to be inside as well as on top, and 1 can of peas is plenty! Just forget the 6 cups of water and make the rice like you normally would. Just dont follow this recipe or you will be disappointed with the outcome like I was, what a waste of all my ingredients.

What a great rice recipe!  The broth makes the rice almost creamy.  And it's even better the second day.

I only give it 4 stars because of the changes I made.  At the advice of the other reviewers, I omitted the water and cooked the rice in just the broth.  Cut the peas to (1) can and mixed the cheese into the rice before baking.  I also added (1) t. salt and 1/2 t. pepper.  My wife who usually turns her nose up at rice loved it!  It was good the next day too.  Thanks Jessica.

This recipe was not worth the effort. It was essentially rice cooked in broth with some peas thrown in.  I agree with all the previous reviewers when they suggest that you should just cook the rice in the broth-skip the water. We eat alot of rice and I use a rice cooker and I found this recipe more work than it was worth.

We cut back a little bit on the water, and it came out great. My three year old who doesnt even like rice asks for this dish!

This was wonderful....I changed a tiny bit and used velveeta cheese with 1/4 cup milk and used a bag of frozen veggies, it was great! The buttery crackers on the top was a great idea...Thank you for sharing this!

THE RECIPE IS OKAY...IT JUST SEEMS TO BE MISSING SOMETHING.  ALSO, IT WOULDN'T BE BAD IF THE CHEESE WAS SPRINKLED THROUGHOUT INSTEAD OF JUST THE TOP.

This recipe lacks flavor. Too much water as other people have suggested. It needs cheese throughout the rice and I like peas so the amount is fine with me. I also used frozen peas which gives it better flavor and color. It also needs black pepper and even a little more salt. I know there is a lot of sodium in chicken broth but this is very bland. I won't be making it again unless I add other seasonings. Sorry but it wasn't a winner with me. Glad I only made half a recipe.

Great start to a delicious recipe.....cooked the rice in chicken broth (about 5 cups) instead of water.  Didn't have peas so put chopped celery and onions in from the start.  When the rice was nearly cooked I put it in the casserole dish and stirred in the cheese.  Topped it with dry bread crumbs and baked for 30 minutes. Very tasty and only 6 ingredients!  Also very budget friendly!
