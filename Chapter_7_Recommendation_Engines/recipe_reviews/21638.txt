This recipe turned out delicious!  Although my husband didn't like it as well, said the peppers were overpowering.  I loved it, and liked it even better the next day in a pita.  Will definately make again, and again and again....

Loved it! My only comment was that the olive oil was rather unnecessary and added a whole lot of calories. I only used a tablespoon or so and it was still the right texture and tasted excellent. The avocado was hard to notice, if you like avocado I would add a little more. Otherwise I'd substitute the avocado for another vegetable and a little more oil.

I added chili pepper flakes but added more than I thought! Just be careful if/when you add chili pepper, it definitely makes it but its easy to go overboard. I also forgot the cilantro and I didn't notice it.

As a side note, if you've got the time and patience, I'd cut the shrimp into smaller pieces. It makes it easier to eat and allows the aromatics to blend into the meat more quickly.

Fantastic!  Light, fresh, and full of flavor.  I used less olive oil (not sure how much, but probably closer to 3 Tbs), let everything except the avocado marinate all day, then added the avocado and some lemon juice right before serving.  Got rave reviews from my family.  Also wonderful as leftovers piled on warmed pita bread.  The avocado actually didn't turn brown overnight because I had added lemon juice.

This was a really good easy recipe except I tried the fresh Cilantro for the first time ever and it left a really bad taste in my mouth so bad I had to throw it all away. I did some google'ing and found out that indeed some people have a bad "reaction" to cilantro like it tastes like soap. Next time no Cilantro for me and it should be just fine.

This recipe was delicious!  You have to let it sit for several hours before serving so the flavors can blend together.  I skipped the green pepper, but added corn and carrots and served it on a bed of mixed greens.  I gave it 5 stars because my Army hubby loved it and he's not a big fan of salads.

This has become one of our favorite recipes, with a few modifications.  I dislike bell pepper of any kind so I substituted sun dried tomatoes.  Not as much flavor but nice color.  I don't use nearly as much olive oil, 2 T is sufficient.  I serve it on a bed of lettuce drizzled with a little Olive Garden dressing.  We have this every couple of weeks.

I added a bit of diced jalapeno and some smoked paprika.  I also cut the shrimp into smaller pieces.  We loved it!

So easy! I sautéed shredded me in garlic and coconut oil. While was sautéing on one side, I quickly chopped veggies. Tossed shrimp with peppers, onion and cilantro. Held off on the evoo, added red pepper, salt and pepper then sprinkled with fresh squeezed lime juice. Immediately topped on spinach with avocado. Delish!

Sounds good for a hot day. I will use flat leaf parsley in place of the cilantro and add dijon and lemon to the olive oil.
