I soaked the edamame beans in water overnight, boiled them for 5 mins and kept the juice aside. When they were cooled, I took the skins off, added all the ingredients listed except the cilantro and added a few tablespoons of the boiling juice of the beans. ( I guess that's why the color changed) I used sea salt for taste. Really yummy! We are planning on eating them with wasabi chips.
