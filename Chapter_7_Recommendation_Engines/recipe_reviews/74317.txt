This is wonderful. Try substituting 1 of the 4 TBS oil with sesame oil. Combine all 4 TBS and use as the author suggests.  Sesame oil gives a very authentic flavor in my opinion

I LOVE salmon, so I ran right out and bought the ingredients for this dish.  I don't love handling fish, however, so I changed the method some.  I fired up the grill, put the romaine and mango on the serving dish, and stir-fried the remaining ingredients.  Then I topped the romaine with the peas and salmon.  I loved the flavor of this dish!

This was really an excellent dish, though a few changes were made. I used half vegetable oil & half sesame oil, for a nice nutty flavor. Only used 1 - 8oz package of sugar snap peas, and a bit more romaine lettuce.  I also used about 1 & 1/3 lbs. of fish. The dressing was really good and the mango added a great sweetness to the salad. It is a bit of work, but we all liked it, and I'd make it again.

nice photo but I don't see any Romaine, cilantro, or scallions. Are they optional?

This recipe was so good my husband said he couldn't find one better in a restaurant.  He caught 370 lbs. of salmon in Alaska so I am always looking for a new recipe.  This one hit the spot just like it is!!

Outstanding fresh, crisp, authentic ASIAN smell and taste.  However, the photo shown looks very little like the end product (several ingredients are missing).  I made it according to the given recipe (using "seasoned" rice vinegar) and it came out great!  (I wanted to try seseme oil as some other reviewers recommended, but I couldn't find it at my local grocery store.)  Further note:  I used the only readily available brand of frozen sugar snap peas and DID NOT defrost them before cooking at all.  The suggested cooking times are PERFECT.

This was quite good but I found it to be a lot of effort.  Asian salmon (from this site) is equally as good and less effort.  I'm not sure if I will make this again.

MMMMMM!  Wonderful!  Even my two little boys thought it was a keeper.  I did substitute sesame oil for half of the oil required and used seasoned vinegar as others had suggested.  I am not a big cilantro fan, so I left that out.  I used frozen mango, added it to the snap peas while they were still hot, it was thawed perfecly by the time the salmon was cooked.  Worth a try!! Beautiful and delicious!

Great dish and really pretty to look at! My only complaint is that there is too much oil for me. I only used half of the 2Tbs oil, rice vinegar and garlic, and the vegetables were still a bit to oily. Next time, when sauteeing the sugar snap peas, I will use a tsp of oil. Other than that, this was great! I added red bell pepper to the snap peas for a pretty color. I also used a mix of black and white sesame seeds. Nice summer dinner.

This wasn't quite to my taste.  Also, the fish got rather dry - I may have overcooked it to be sure it was done.
