Wonderful crust. I added 1/2 C sour cream after the ice water.
Brushed with egg wash once on top of pie. Tasty and very pretty.

OMG, this is absolutely the best pie crust ever! I halved the recipe because I only needed the bottom crust to make a blueberry pie. It is buttery, sweet and tender, absolutely delish! I'm not the best at rolling the pie crust,  I need more practice since this is only the 2nd time I make a pie crust from scratch. Will be getting a lot of practice since this will be the crust I will be making  for all my sweet pies. Thank you for the recipe!
