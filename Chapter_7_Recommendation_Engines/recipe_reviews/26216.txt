I could not find canned prunes so I bought dried prunes and added 1 cup prune juice for each cup of dried prunes.  It turned out great!! I used the filling to make Kolaches.

I made a half batch of this filling, and used walnuts instead of pecans. I also used dried prunes that I stewed in orange juice with some orange zest (so I ended up using orange juice instead of the lime juice called for in the recipe). This filling is slightly spicy, sweet, citrus-y, and definitely prune flavored (which I love!). I'm going to use it to fill paczki's. Thank you for the recipe!
