Well, it doesn't have to be 5 o'clock for me to enjoy something like this especially since it's so brutally hot here!  These are simply awesome!  I'm not a coffee drinker, but give me iced coffee and I love it. But, give it to me iced with Bailey's and I'm in Heaven!!!  These also make great shooters topped with a bit of whipped cream!

This is a good proportion of cream to coffee. Baileys is my favorite sweet shot to add to coffee, good hot or cold.

Iced Baileys is the Perfect summer after supper dessert drink! It is cool and oh so refreshing:) Sometimes a scoop of ice cream instead of the ice is an excellent source of fun too! keep this one close by, you never know when the mood will strike! Thanks Bailey's:)

This is nice but I also added 1 shot of good brandy.  I think that made it even better.
