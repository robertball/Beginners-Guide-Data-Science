YUMMY! I used 8 egg yolks, 7 cans evaporated milk, 4 cans cream of coconut, 4 cans sweetened condensed milk, no water, 2+ cups Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay Rum (it's Puerto Rican coconut rum...adds a little more coconut flavor to the cream de coco), 1 tsp cloves, 2 tsp cinnamon and 4 tsp vanilla. I didn't use a double boiler, just a large stock pot and warmed it slowly while stirring it almost constantly and using a candy thermometer to see when it got to 160 degrees.  Then I just blended the eggnog in 4 batches, so I added the cloves, cinnamon, vanilla and rum in the measurements stated on the recipe, which would add up to the measurements I gave at the beginning of the review.  I ended up with about a gallon and a half, there was a little more but I had to use that for a couple of taste tests!! This is the first time I have made eggnog and I chose this because my boyfriend is Puerto Rican. He can't wait to get home from work to try it and I can't wait to serve it tomorrow night at our family's Christmas dinner!  This is DEFINITELY a keeper!  THANK YOU, BRANDY!! ... *Update* ...The next morning after it had cooled in the fridge, it was pretty thick.  We tasted it and decided to add more rum (we like drinks strong).  We just added a little at a time until it was the right consistency.  It was a HUGE hit at Christmas dinner!  Even people who don't normally drink eggnog loved it!  12/24/08- Update again.  I made this yesterday for Christmas tomorrow and it's incredible!  I didn'

QUE RICO!! The best coquito i've ever had! I didn't use a double boiler, just cooked the beaten yolks and evap. milk on medium heat until it thickened. 1/2 cup of rum is enough for my taste but i know some of my friends will likely want to add some more to it. Brandy, your recipe is the best and now it is my recipe too. Thank you!

Remember that Rum/alcohol in any drink is always to taste. My sister is a wimp so I reduced the alcohol to suit any taste. U can always add more!!!  I make mine with more rum but not everyone like alcohol like some of us do and therefore the water. Those who think this is sweet should not be searching for eggnog!!!  I am puertorican so don't let my name fool u. Anything other than coconut flavor is NOT coquito :p. This is my recipe and it was changed by all recipes to use a double boiler. You don't need to use a double boiler in my opinion as long as the eggs are fresh. If allergic to eggs, you could ommit them altogether and it won't change the flavor much; if at all. It will be just less thick and of course and eggless eggnog :). Instead of plain water I sometimes use coconut milk if I have it on hand. Coconut water will make it a bit salty and the use of coconut milk instead of coconut water is recommended or just use plain water. You still need the coconut cream for the coquito regardless so don't confuse the two.

Really good recipe.  I use this recipe when I have the time, but I have since found a pre-mixed Coquito called Mi Abuela that is extremely close to homemade. I bought it at Big 3 Wine & Liquor in the Bronx on E. Tremont Ave. If you don't have time to make your own, or want a back up, definitely check it out.  I know this may not be useful info to members of a site like "all recipes", but just wanted to share it just in case!

when making a traditional Coquito, you dont use coconut cream thats a short cut and you can taste the difference at the end product. What you suppose to do is grind the coconut add the evaperate milk and squeeze the coconut milk out the coconut.

I am born and raised in Puerto Rico and this recipe really reminds me of the sweet, creamy coquito that I drank as a child. Gave this to all my friends last year and they all loved it. Mind you they are all from all over the world. This year am even making labels for my bottles and giving them as Christmas presents... This recipe deserves a 10 star rating.

I did a test run as is, then I made it again, tweaking it a bit--since I'm Puerto Rican I had this every Christmas just never had a recipe for it TILL NOW!!
I used Barcardi Gold Rum, 1/4 teaspoon ground clover and 1 c. rum--everything else the same.  I rinse out wine bottles and with a funnel pour it in bottle & cork it, when ready to drink I shake well, pour and ENJOY it!!

This is the perfect coquito! I'm Latina, and this is a huge hit with my husband's Italian and Irish family--never have leftovers.  I get requests for it every holiday.  We don't even bother with eggnog anymore.  I don't make any changes to the recipe, other than cooking it in a regular pot instead of a double broiler.

Made this for New Years with my Costa Rican in-laws.  Everyone but my husband (picky, picky man) loved it.  I used coconut milk instead of cream of coconut (and eliminated the water).  I thought it might not be sweet enough, but it turned out just right for me.  And I also used nutmeg instead of cloves.  I may try the cloves next time.  I made an "unleaded" version for my teetotaller relatives.  They raved too.  Great recipe.

I made this Coquito again this year.  I'm Puerto Rican and it is true to it's name.  Last year I didn't broil this but there is a reason to broil this recipe.  Since it has eggs it is the safest way to make.  I added 1/4 tsp of vanilla and more rum to my taste and it still came out delicious. This is a great recipe.  Thank you for sharing. Jan

Then put cinnamon water in blender w/1 can evap milk, 1 can condensed milk, 1 can coconut milk, 1 tsp vanilla extract and Rum (I use Malibu Rum/coconut flavor).  Serve on the rocks & sprinkle lightly with ground cinnamon on top. Delicious..

Coquito is the best!!!!! I've been a part of the hidden Coquito movement, but is too good to let everyone else drink it ;) so if you don't want to get to this point, make enough for everyone and more!!

Suggestion: Add some crushed almond nougat (turron) and the drink is called "Turroncillo".  Add some chocolate (to taste) and call it "Choquito".

This recipe is exceptional! Real coquito does not contain eggs so I omitted them along with the 1/2 cup of water. I also didn't have any cloves but other than that followed the recipe to a 'T'. So creamy! Very sweet...could be thinned out with some milk if needed. This is not a drink that you would drink all night to get drunk, instead more of a dessert drink to sip on. I am going to bottle this to give as holiday gifts! Thanks so much for sharing!

As I was making this at home, I poured myself a couple glasses for, um, tasting purposes.  I called this my "happy drink" because I certainly was very happy after drinking it.

The only reason I am giving this 5 stars is because allrecipes.com doesn't have the ability to give any recipe SEVEN stars.  I searched multiple sites for a good coquito recipe ever since I tasted what my ex-girlfriend made for me last Xmas (and she wasn't giving up her secret).   I made 4 different recipes and this was by far the best.  I made 3 bottles of coquito and shared it with friends, my boss and co-workers.  

Great, great stuff.  I don't think I'll ever go back to regular eggnog again!

Exactly as Remembered, I made this for my Dad, for Christmas & New Years. It was amazing, the Memories, my dad, said it needed more Rum, even though I add 1/2 cup more Dark Rum. Its was just wonderful and full of Puerto Rican Tradition. 10 Stars, thank for the recipe

Very good!  I am Puerto Rican and my husband who's American (and doesn't like eggnog that much) said that this is fantastic.  He also said that of all the coquitos he has tried this is by far, the best.  I agree.   We added 1/4 cup more rum (less water).

Excellent! I used a pan instead of double-boiler. Instead of ground cloves/cinnamon I boiled whole cloves and cinnamon sticks in 1.5 cups of water till the water turned light brown then added this to the mix. I also used coconut milk instead of the cream, which I think is too sweet and thick.

Make double or triple batches for sure. This recipe is "muy rico."

OMG this recipe was on the money. I am puertorican and I love my coquito during the holidays. I was tired of spending money on bottles of coquito other people made so I decided to try and make it myself. Of course I came to my fave site and found this perfect recipe. My entire family loved it especially my picky hubby and now I don't have to buy it anymore !

I made this last week for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner and followed the recipe precisely. Oh my goodness, it was TOO SWEET! I asked my aunt, who is puertorican and she told me she doesn't add the sweetened condensed milk. I just now finished making another batch for Thanksgiving tomorrow without the condensed milk and it is sweet enough! I would taste the coquito before adding the condensed milk- you may find you don't  need it. I also added the rum to taste. So YUMMY!

This is great!  The only change I made was the name.  I re-named it to "Tropical Eggnog."  I hosted a "Christmas in July" party and this was perfect!

The taste was perfect! Not as thick and heavy as the eggnog I'm used to, but the process I used was far simpler. You don't need a double boiler and blender. Just don't scorch the milk :)

Fantastic! Didn't bother with the double boiler, I made it in a saucepan just like my mother used to and it was great. Tastes just like my mother's.

You dont have to "cook" the eggs, the rum will take care of that. Just dump everything in the blender and make sure you keep it on for at least one minute. I use just one whole egg and a full cup of rum but you can change that depending on your taste. Also, it's a MUST to chill at least overnight! I make my batch in November, although it's very hard to resist! Enjoy!

Coquito has been a traditional Puerto Rican favorite for the holidays (Christmas and especially New Year's) for many years in my family.  It is unbelievable and everyone who tries it loves it.  Traditionally, it is made with raw eggs though and I am leary to try cooking it, but maybe I'll try that if I become pregnant again and concerned about raw eggs.  Generally, if you are not pregnant, you can just make sure that you buy fresh eggs and make it just 2+ hours ahead of time (and chilling it for 1-2 hours before serving).  Thanks for the recipe, I have never seen it with cloves before and may just try adding that to mine next year.  (I'll keep that out this year as usual).

Great recipe. Made it 3 times and my wife drank most of it. You truly have to hide it in the back of the fridge.

This was delicious, but it would have been way oversweet with cream of coconut.  I used one can of coconut milk, and it was perfect.  I also used one cup of rum and no water.  This may be a new Christmas Eve tradition.  Thanks!

this is a great recipe! i added a little bit of ginger also for more flavor, which is not very traditional. however, what makes this recipe more like coquito from puerto rico is DARK rum. makes all the difference! salud!

I have been using this recipe for 3 years now and am just writing a review.  This is the best one around.  No raw eggs makes for a smooth taste and I actually simmer a vanilla bean in with the evaporated milk and yolks.

Also just as delicious with spiced rum.

This is my recipe for Coquito. I only use 3/4th of the condensed milk, all of the evaporated milk and coconut cream and 1 cup of rum or a little more but this is absolutely delicious. It comes out perfect. Next year I want to double it because we drink it so fast! This is absolutely the best recipe and I love that everyone tweaks it to fit their tastes.

I made this per the recipe and it was way too sweet. I tried it again and used 14 oz. of coconut milk instead of the coconut cream. It was perfect that way, just like I remember from my visit to Peurto Rico. Add a little extra run for kick!

Easy and good! Next time I will add a little extra rum as it was a little weak. So everyone just added extra afterwards. I did worry that there would be a strong coconut flavour, but that was not a problem at all. It was very subtle. Thanks!

Yum! It's been a hit at all the parties this year. The taste is just like I remember it growing up! However, after a couple of difficult tries cooking the eggs and milk in the boiling water, I decided to cook them in a medium sauce pan and it was a lot easier. The small change didn't compromise the flavor at all and it seemed to be even creamier. I also made it without water after a couple of tries. I've made a lot of it this holiday season!!! Perfect for gifts to neighbors and friends.

Really good recipe. Have made it 8 times since christmas. All 8 batches I have tweaked by substituting the water for coconut water and boiling the coconut water with the spices. The 1st 5 batches I made a mistake, noticed the mistake on batch 2 and figured why change it. If it ain't broken why fix it, right?! My mistake the 1st 5 times was  that I cooked the eggs with the condensed milk instead of the evaporated milk, it came out delicious, smooth and creamy with a nice coconut taste. The alcohol didn't seem to be in there at first but after a few sips it sneaks up on ya which everyone seemed to like. Did I mention that they loved it?!!! Happy accident, right?! Since my family and friends are all on this coquito kick this holiday season I decided to make 3 more batches in preparation for coquito cupcakes and Cheesecakes Im making this wk for New Years celebration. Figured I cook the eggs with the evaporated milk like the recipe originally called for to see if it made an even better difference. Just tasted the new batches and it's just not the same. It's more of a texture thing, I think? I must add the alcohol is pretty obvious with these new batches unlike my 1st 5 batches. Going forward I'm convinced my happy mistake is a must. For the sake of using the coquito as an ingredient to bake with these new batches will work fine but as for drinking it I will definitely be going back to my happy mistake.:-)

I didn't use rum so added some vanilla soy milk. Overall it was too sweet and thick compared to how my grandma use to make it. My husband really enjoyed it though and he doesn't like trying new things or eggnog. So I think if I made it again I would do some tweaking.

Only because of what I had on hand, I used coconut milk instead of cream and used coconut mailbu rum instead of white rum.  I also used 4 egg yolks istead of 2.  It was delicious!  Thank you for this recipe, it was a hit this holiday season.  I filled cute bottles with the cocquito and gave it as gifts.

This recipe is out of this world...  I wanted to try something different this year and WOW!  This was the greatest addition to the holiday table.  I don't drink so I used less alcohol than the recipe calls for and it turned out just fine.  Next year I'll try it with no alcohol.  Just addicting!!!

Ok, I have to say this is my favorite drink recipe! My husband and I absolutely love it! The only thing I did different was add coconut water instead of plain water and I also added a little nutmeg instead of cloves. Oh, and learn from my mistakes...coconut cream is NOT the same as creamed coconut. Make sure you buy the can of coconut cream and not creamed coconut or your cocoquito will have a weird coconut texture.

I made this for Thanksgiving and I plan on making it for Christmas. This Coquito was awesome! The only thing I tweaked was I added less cloves because I don't like the clovey taste. It's a bit too strong for me. I did add a tad more Cinnamon and Vanilla and I served it chilled. My friends and family loved it! This recipe is a keeper.

Extremely good. This is how coquito is supposed to taste.  I asked my grandmother for her recipe and then I couldn't find it. This one is pretty much the same except mi abuela doesn't cook the eggs AND she puts A LOT more liquor...too much I think. You can add more to this but too much takes away from the wonderful flavors. ENJOY and Merry CHRISTmas!!!

I found this an EXCELLENT recipe and made this drink this year instead of my traditional egg nog and it was a HUGE hit with all my Christmas guests! this will definately be a recipe i will be making over and over again.
i found that it was a bit to spicy for my particular taste...i added a little less than the 1/4 tsp of ground cloves and just a tad less of the ground cinnamon as well...always mix well before pouring into individual cups and if possible place the prepared coquito into clean wine bottles with cork stoppers placed in for much easier and thorough mixing before pouring.

Absolutely fabulous!  I followed the recipe as exactly as I could without all the required equipment.  I don't have a double boiler, so I used a medium saucepan over low heat and stirred constantly (about 15 minutes).  I also could not find my candy thermometer so used a meat thermometer (since I already had it on the stove and couldn't run over to the neighbor's and borrow one).  Just before it reached 160 degrees, the mixture started coating the back of the spoon, just like the recipe describes.  I also used Captain Morgan Parrot Bay rum.  This is a scrumptious egg nog.  Next year, I'll make a double batch!

I love this recipe. I'm Puertorrican and it never fails to please. I have people asking me for coquito all year long. 
Some alterations I've made are eliminating the 1/2 cup of water and simply using a cup of Don Q. 
I add whole cloves, vanilla extract and cinnamon sticks  while the evaporated milk is boiling and strain them out when adding the mixture to the rest in the mixer, and it really brings out those flavors without creating the sediment the ground stuff makes.

It has been a while since I've made this recipe, but it is delicious.  If I make this recipe with alcohol, I use dark Bacardi or Capt. Morgan Spiced Rum, which gives the Coquito the kick that it needs.  As a Caribbean American, I do not use vanilla extract; I use real vanilla.  It can be purchased in any market that sells Caribbean or Latino produce/food.  Tweak the amount of ground cloves and cinnamon according to your liking, and make sure to use Cream of coconut and not coconut milk.  Those are two entirely different items.

My Puerto Rican husband LOVED this.  He was a little skeptical at first, that it would be anywhere near as good as his mom's, but he said this is even better!  He keeps requesting that I make it.  Being leery of the egg yolks, I almost skipped that part, but I am SO glad I didn't!  This is delicious!!!

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe.  I think it may be the sweetened condensed milk.  Something added a strange flavor.  This was my second attempt.  Probably will try a different recipe next time.

Great recipe! I tried the double broiler but it took about 15 mins to reach 100 degrees. So I just put it in a regular pot, med heat, stirred constantly and in 5 mins it reached 160 degrees. This is very simple and it tastes amazing. I did not want to kill the flavor so I stuck with the 1 cup of rum and 1/2 cup water. If any of my guest wants more they can always add it.

This was very tasty, however I got clumps of cloves and cinnamon (the dry ingredients) throughout the drink. Maybe I didn't not mix it long enough.  Also on the bottom of the bottle you can see all of the spices built up.

Not hard at all, and it came out yummy! :)  This is a great substitute for the rest of the year when the grocery stores don't carry edd nog.  Actually, this is better than egg nog since it coconut! I did reduce the alcohol by half because I like my drinks sweet.

If you omit the cloves, eggs and water, double up on the rum (1 cup) - this is the real Puerto Rican coquito.  Great recipe.

This was so good. We left out the rum and added another 1/2c water making 1 cup total.  We also added 1 cup milk to thin it out a tad more.  It was perfect!  This is now a tradition in our family every holiday season.  Kids and adults were raving :)

I was born and raised in Puerto Rico but have been away for much too long. My mother still makes her coquito which we get from an old family cook book. My mother left us for the holidays this year and went to Puerto Rico without any coquito :( So, I decided that it was time to make my own. I found this recipe and started reading the reviews. All I can say is thank you soooo soooo soooo much! This is the best, and I do mean best coquito I've ever had (better than mami's)!!! I did a couple of my improvisations but wow, again THANK YOU!!!!

ABSOLUTLEY A-W-E-S-O-M-E.....This is the best I have ever tasted. We did put coconut rum instead of regular. It really adds more of a carribean flavor. My husband and I kept tasting as we were bottling YUUUMMMM. Our holiday guests wanted more and more...A must try recipe that will be a holiday favorite always!!!!!!!!

DELICIOUS!!!!!  Sooooooooo Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly as given, except for the rum... I substituted clear rum for the Cruzan Rum Cream.  I did my taste test prior to transferring it out of the blender- I agree with everyone else about hiding some for me.  I just sent my husband out to get more of the ingredients to make some more!  A plus at every Christmas function!  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this receipe was great.. It was thick and sweet.I also used a medium saucepan. It didn't seem to make a difference. If you like a stronger taste of rum I suggest a little bit more... Def taste it as you go.. Great Recipe Brandy!!!!

Great Coquito Recipe, I make it every year and always get asked for the recipe. I do alter it to make it less sweet and it comes out delicious! Instead of the 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk, I use half a can. I use a cup of white rum  and  1 cup of water instead of the 1/2 suggested. Instead of ground cloves and cinnamon, I use the sticks and boil the cup of water.  I like to infuse the flavor of cinnamon and cloves in the water and then garnish ground cinnamon when ready to serve. Hope this helps!

This is the way my family in Puerto Rico makes it. There are simpler ways but they just don't end up this creamy and delicious.
**NOTE** Most use a white rum like Bacardi but Captain Morgans is my new preferred rum in coquito. It adds even more flavor.

I have made coquito a million different ways and I have to say this is the best recipe and the one that will continue to use from now on. The only thing I altered was adding a bit more Bacardi white rum. :)

I have been making this recipe for the last 5 years and it has always been a winner.  The creaminess and consistency of the final product is perfect.  Upon request I trade the 1/2 cup water for an extra 1/2 cup of white rum or the opposite for those that do not like alcohol.  A cup of water instead of 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup white rum.  Excellent recipe!

Excellent.  Approved by my Puerto Rican girlfriend!  I may use just a little less rum next time though, because it's very prominent.

Having grown up in Puerto Rico I figured I would make some coquito when I hosted my first holiday party in the states. This was an absolute hit and it vanished immediately. It's a great alternative to eggnog. Everyone who told me they didn't like eggnog went back for seconds of coquito. I will definitely keep this recipe and use it every Christmas.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! However, it is wayyyyy too sweet! I made it with out the sweetened condensed milk and it was sweet enough. Also, I used coconut water instead of plain H2O. My Puerto Rican grandmother loved it. We no longer need to rely on other people to make it for us for the holidays =)

I am Puertorrican, I have been making Coquito for years. This is by far, the best recipe.  I eliminated the water, and added more rum (we like Coquito with a "kick").  I made this for a party and left the event with "orders" for more.  This is awesome!

I hate eggnog, but love love this stuff.  This is my 2nd year making it for Thanksgiving.  I use 3/4 a cup of rum (like it a little stronger).  I also don't have a double-broiler, so I just heat the eggs and milk on the stovetop stirring frequently until it coats the wooden spoon.  Thank you so much for giving me a Thanksgiving staple!

This was absolutely delicious!  I added a 1/2 cup of spiced rum (Captain Morgan) and it brought out the cinnamon and clove flavors.  The store was out of cream of coconut, so I used coconut milk instead and used slightly less water and it turned out great!  Thanks for this excellent recipe!

This coquito recipe is quite tasty. Once you start drinking some it is difficult to put the glass down. 

Though I tripled the amount of rum. I felt as though 1/2 cup of rum is way too weak. I think adding a bit more rum gives it a better flavor.

I made this to bring to Christmas Day dinner at my in-laws and the whole family raved about it! They are all PuertoRican and said it was the best they've had. (It was a great bonding moment for us!!!) The only ajustments I made were I cooked it straight on the stove, I added some nutmeg and i used 1/2 cup of spiced rum as well as the white rum. Thank you so much for the recipe!!

I don't drink, so I made this drink, omitted the alcohol and I loved it. For my husband who is a social drinker, I added 1-2 tsp. of vanilla rum to his glass and man, he drank the rest of the pitcher....lol. After this, I made another batch and he took it to a few of our neighbors to sample it and came back empty handed!!!! This is now our holiday drink of choice and will be for years to come. Thanks so much!

This is the best, the very best drink I have found.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving, and it is a keeper.  Can't wait for the next occasion to make it.

This was my first attempt and first time drinking homemade eggnog. Personally I found there was a little to much cinnamon but other then that it was good. I tried it at different stages too, right when it was done when it was still warm, after being in the fridge for a few hours and over night and I prefer it warm. I didn't add the rum though because I want my 3 and 1yrs old to drink it too. It was good and relatively easy to make using just a regular pan on low but I don't think I will make it again. Pretty costly concidering you can buy a 2L of store eggnog for 2$ and to make this it cost about 5$. It was good though and I enjoyed making it and drinking it, but I'll stick with store bought for now.

Amazing! I have never had real Rican coquito, but my best friend that lives there ALWAYS Raves about it. This is awesome! I made everything on the stove in a pot and added the rum after and put in the fridge. I used Malibu Coconut Rum. THANKS for the Wonderful Recipe!

This is delicious...I followed the directions as stated - I used a double boiler and I didn't have any problem with the eggs - well worth the effort.  I used Capt. Morgan's Parrot Bay Coconut Rum for the alcohol.  The Coquito is sweet, but I think it is the perfect combination of sweet w/ the spices, and it has a very nice consistency.

I only made one batch, however, in the future I will double it, and if I was serving it for Christmas, etc. I would quadruple it -

I made this recipe December of 2007.
I was a big hit...the best coquito that I have ever tasted.
This December 2008 I still had some left over. It was just as good or better than when it was first made.
I think the reason that it kept so well was because I didn't use the eggs raw.
To people who choose to use raw eggs be careful because of salmonella bacteria.
Enjoy the coquito.

This was way too sweet for me but my hubby loved it.  I also had a problem with the mixture getting too thick to pour.  After I got it out I reblended it and it was fine.  I think it's best in small doses.

I typically don't like Coquito but made this recipe for my husband- I loved it! My pan did scorch however (much to my surprise)... but I don't have a double boiler. Oh well- yummy yummy!

Very rich and tasty. My husband loves it. Yes will make it again. Tastes better after it sits in fridge a few days so flavors meld. I didn’t add water but added the extra 1/2 cup of rum.

Great recipe but this is called Ponche. Over the years people have associated egg Ponche with Coquito. Traditional Coquito does not have eggs and uses real coconut. Love both but prefer Ponche just a little because it is thicker. 

Try it also with a real cinnamon stick and leave it whole in the bottle. 

A variation also adds a bit of maraschino cherries and juice to give it a different taste.

Oh.. and these drinks are served in much smaller glasses than in the video. I would say a serving should be 2-3 ounces.

This is a very good and easy recipe.  I have made it several times and my friends and family love it.  This season I tried a couple of changes that I think really made it even easier and quicker to make without changing the quality at all.  I didn’t use the eggs (that cut down significantly on the time), and I used 1 cup of Rum and 1 can of Coconut Milk (instead of water).  The yield is still 2 full 750 ml bottles and it was just as thick and creamy as it was when I used the eggs.

Just made this tonight!  Soooooo good! I couldn't wait to chill it overnight so I put a glass in the freezer and I am drinking it now. I did not change any of the ingredients but I didn't blend it because I don't have a blender. I was worried at first because the condensed milk and eggs didn't get thick for me. I then put that in a mixing bowl and added all of the other ingredients. I just stirred it with a whisk. Now that it has been chilled, it thickened up. I LOVE coquito and I am so glad I can now make it! I will be making it again next week for my family. Thank you so much!

I have been making coquito for years.  As a NY Puerto Rican, I have been enjoying this delicious beverage since I can remember.  This recipe is the real deal.  There is no need to look any further!!  Trust me, I have tried them all and this is the end of the road for me because there is no better recipe, and it's easy to make too!  Just for preferences sake, I add more rum but that's just personal taste!  A++++++ thanks so much for sharing the recipe :)

I’ve never had the real thing so I can’t judge the authenticity.  It was truly delicious though.  I followed the directions pretty much exactly except that I replaced coconut milk for the water.  I used Bacardi Superior and added ice to my container before serving. It didn’t taste watered down at all and the alcohol content was pretty high. Everything raved about it and I thought it was pretty easy to make.  I mixed the eggs and evaporated milk on medium almost constantly.  I used a handheld thermometer to check the temp.

Delicious! 
I did not have a double boiler, so I used a small pot with water and a big pot on top to do so and it wouldn't thicken. So I placed the pot with the eggs and milk onto the burner and cooked it on low-medium (3 on induction), and it thickened right up! 
I did not put the rum into it (so it is really thick), because I will add the rum individually. This recipe made  1 quart.
This was so easy and it tastes delicious.

The best Coquito I’ve tasted yet.  I tweeked a little because the egg yokes thickened it quite a bit, but that was fine I just added more rum?? and let it completely cool in the refrigerator and run it through the blender one more time for about 30 seconds and then bottled it.

Great recipe!  Love that it’s quick. My usual recipe has eggs, but you don’t cook it. It has to sit for 10 days.  So I like that this was quick and easy.

Delicious, very creamy (maybe a little too thick but I think I cooked the egg mixture  bit too much), I doubled the rum and it was perfect :)

Loved it at first, but it’s beyond sweet. The cream of coconut plus the condensed milk is sugar overkill! However I will remake it substituting coconut milk for the cream of coconut and nix the water while adding more rum! Flavors were great though!

Coquito doesn't have eggs in it. Other than that recipe is ok, but seriously, leave out the eggs.

Let me preface that I love sweet and sugar. But this is VERY sweet. It is too sweet. I made this exactly as recipe listed. I had the pleasure of tasting coquito made by my friends Puerto Rican grandmother and I have yet to find a recipe that duplicates how she made it which was phenomenal. Sorry but I won’t be making this again.

Love this simple recipe.  Added  more than 1/2 cup water  to cut the sweetness of an entire can of sweetened condensed milk.  Otherwise it is too rich for our taste because we like more than one shot!

I love this recipe. I think this recipe used to be called Coquito I. I like the eggs in this recipe bc I'm from Honduras and we make something similar with lots of egg yolks. I doubled the rum and used Bacardi dark. Came out yummy.

Best coquito I’ve ever had hands down. I make it every year and my family goes nuts for it. I follow the creator’s recipe and just mix the egg yolks and evaporated milk on the stovetop. It is creamy and sweet and coconut-y. My husband says it’s so addictive he may need coquito rehab after the holidays are over.

I made a double batch of this for a holiday party at work and everyone LOVED it. Even those that said they don’t like eggnog. I followed other reviewers suggestions and simmering on the stovetop and I replaced the water with coconut milk. After a taste test the following day I felt like it was too sweet and did not have enough Bacardi. I topped off the bottles with a lot more rum which helped cut the sweetness just right. For the double batch I used about half of a 750 mL bottle of Bacardi and it definitely tasted boozy without being too strong.  I’m definitely making this again since it was incredibly easy and tasty!

I dont have a double boiler so I just constantly stirred the evaporated milk and egg yolks on a medium heat until it was thick as other reviewers said. I also doubled the amount of rum and left out the water (I like my drinks on the stronger side). After I bottled it to put in the fridge, I put some cinnamon sticks in the bottles.
This by far is the best coquito I've ever tasted! I've bought a bunch from other people over the years, and now that I've found this recipe I'll never buy it from someone again since it's so simple to make! Great recipe!

This came out quite good! I only made one small change: I used Leche de coconut instead of crema de coconut. 

Everyone loved the taste and I will have to make it again and again and again!

We received Coquito as a gift from a neighbor, but no longer live in the neighborhood.   Since the whole family loved it and it was missing from our holiday routine, I decided to try this.  WeI like it.  I added extra rum instead of water.  A dash of nutmeg, and because our gift version had included it,  coconut flakes.  Delish!!!

Wow! This is almost too good. Like eggnog, only better - not as sweet and not as gloopy and heavy. I've never been a fan of cloves, so I only added a sprinkle of them and added some freshly grated ginger and nutmeg. I wasn't quite sure what the recipe meant by coconut cream (Pepe Lopez?), so I used two 5.5 ounce cans of unsweetened coconut cream - the super thick, stiff stuff. I also added about a 1/4 of orange juice to brighten the taste. Excellent!

It might taste good, but authentic Coquito doesn't include eggs, as I remember.  It is not coconut-ish eggnog.  But that is my thing: I don't like to change  traditional recipes, although there are people that make chocolate coquito too.  If I do Irish Cream, I would use Irish Whiskey.

I've made this many times before even have had request to make it for birthdays during the year. This year people have asked for me to make this for them. I don't want to make it at the last minute. How long does it last in fridge after making?

Living in the islands and so close to the spanish culture, I must say that my family and friends raved over this! It was awesome!!!! I used our local coconut cruzian rum for the recipe. It's absolutely the best rum for this recipe! Will make this every Christmas season as I no longer need to buy a bottle and hope the person's recipe is as good as this!

Every Christmas Eve, I make this drink for my coworkers. It is a yearly tradition at work now. I also bring empanadas as well and all my coworkers look forward to them every year. I've found that one can of condensed milk is too sweet, so I cut it down to about 3/4 cup. My daughter loves the non alcoholic kind. Sweet, creamy and delicious. It is not Christmas without it!

This is the second time I made this. I didn't change a thing except doubling up and placing a cinnamon stick in the bottle. I made enough to fill a 1.75l bottle plus 16 ounces. Tastes great with the correct amount of rum. P.s. I bought cheap white rum.

Delicious! I'm half puertorican and followed this recipe completely and found that it tastes just like what I am used to and have drinken while 2 decades in PR. Now that I'm back in the U.S. just had to have it to make it for my hubby who loved iit! Just added a bit more rum but dark (Bacardi Gold)  and 1 can coconut water came out perfect!! Thanks!

Yes Indeed... This Conquito recipe is a hit! Along with this recipe, I followed Shannon's revise, one of the commentaries. Many of my guests from my 2016 New Year's party gravitated to this cocktail and finished it to the last drop.

Well I definitely put my spin on it. I use fat free evaporated milk and fat free condensed milk. You wouldn't know the difference. Then I add 1 cup of white Bacardi rum and 1/2 cup rum chata. No it's not too much alcohol. Truthfully it could've taken another 1/2 of Bacardi. And of course I added all the other stuff. I used all the alcohol and filled 16 of the 24oz jars in the picture. I gave them as gifts.

I followed this recipe almost exactly...I do not like cloves, so I used nutmeg. It was good, but too heavy for me. It also seemed to have too much spice for me. I added extra water and rum to my taste each time I had a glass, and it was good.  I also made the other PR Coquito recipe on here that doesn't have eggs in it, and liked it so much more. Then I tried both with coconut rum and water, and they were delicious!

I love it! I've been in charge of making the family coquito for years, unfortunately I didn't know how! I've used this recipe soooo many time and I didn't have to switch or swap anything! Except this year, that im leaving out the run because we have young kids that want to try it and older people on medications. Other than that 5 stars all around! Best tasting coquito I've ever tried! Buen provecho!

I did not add water.   I added 2 cinnamon sticks to the evaporated milk and heated on low for 10 min. watching closely so not to scorch.  Let cool down completely and use sieve while adding other ingredients.  I also used Don Q Cristal Rum.  Of course use as much rum to taste. Been Approvecho! For a bit more flavor you can also add Caption Morgans which kicks it up a notch.  There are hundreds of variations to Coquito so don't be intimidated into thinking there is one right way to do it.  My great-grandmother from Puerto Rico insisted that you never put egg yolks in.  It is not intended to be Egg Nog. (And always use fresh coconut shredded add evaporated milk, use cheese cloth to squeeze 
out milk.)

Definitely one of the better Coquito recipes out there. =] My family is from Puerto Rico and there is something about my abuela's that I couldn't quite get right. This recipe comes the closest to hers. Now, I did what ShannonS recommended **for the most part**, but I'm not sure how in the world, but mine ended up being about 2 gallons! (Probably used more alcohol xP Yum!) 

I used authentic Caribbean rum (thank you family!) and  for the lighter weights of my friends who aren't too fond of "strong flavors", I used some Malibu in their portion with a shot of the good stuff. (Yay! More for me!)

I deviated and made my own leche condensada, but I didn't boil it down until it was completely thickened, which allowed me to remove the water from the recipe. I also only used about 3/4 of what the recipe called for and found it to be just right. I also boiled a cinnamon stick in with the leche evaporada.

Highly recommend this recipe. Also, play around with it. Tasting as you go is the best part! I'm not too fond of cloves, so them down a bit and upped the cinnamon.

The coquito doesn't need eggs and cloves just  2 cans of cream of coconut 1 can of evaporated milk 1 can of coconut milk vanilla cinnamon coconut rum and you can add a cinnamon stick to the recipient where you will store the coquito plus you need to let it rest in the fridge for at least 2 days so it can gain its consistency   :-)

I really liked this! I used coconut milk because the store I went to didn't seem to have the cream of coconut and I used 6 oz of regular milk when heating the eggs because I forgot to get the evap milk so I just reduced the amount of milk for the recipe. In the end, I added a little more rum and a shot of buttershots!  I will be keeping this recipe for sure!

I made this a 2nd time but for those who don't like alcohol, I omitted the Rum  and substituted the amount with whole milk, then added alcohol per glass for those who wanted it.

I've had this drink before, but made by my latino friends. Searched for a recipe and came across this one. This was my first time making it and it came out grea! Sooo easy. I do not have a double broiler, so I just used a normal pot and carefully eyed it as not to let it stick to the pot while on low to medium heat stirring constantly. It was fine. I used Bacardi Coconut Rum. Deeelishh!

A Puerto Rican friend turned me on to coquitos, but this was the first time I made them myself. As usual, I followed the recipe exactly - something I always do as a baseline. I wouldn't change a thing! 

BUT - I should have gotten enough ingredients to make at least three more batches, because everyone loved them! I let the kids have a sip before I added the rum to the blender and they whined and moaned that they wanted more. So now they'll be getting their own batch on New Year's Eve.

No more egg nog for us - coquitos are the way to go!

Tastes so good! Skipped on the water and cloves (because I personally dislike cloves) and used Malibu coconut rum. I also added an extra egg yolk because my yolks were really small. This is the perfect addition to my Puerto Rican Christmas! Would definitely make again!

Brandy thank you! It taste just like my mother's / grandmother's Coquito!  The recipe is a little  different.  I have their recipe but it's just a list of ingredients and you have to taste and add as you go. No measurements so it doesn't always come out just right or the same every time.  This year it came out just horrible ( I dumped the whole thing)  so I came online and found this one, with all the great reviews I just had to try it.  Your recipe is the exact taste!!! I was shocked especially with condensed milk but I guess that takes the place of all the sugar i would have been adding.  I did not do the double boiler either just a tiny pot with the egg yolk and evap milk with the thermometer. Once i made it I couldn't believe it was our Perfect Family Coquito taste!!! I did use the Coconut milk instead of the Cream of Coconut because that's how we make our Coquito and that's what I had ....this is a Definite Keeper THANK YOU!!!

I tried this for the time on Thanksgiving and my family loved it. I added  1 cup of white rum instead of 1/2 cup. This recipe is perfect.  It didn't taste like it had to much of any one ingredient.

My boss gave me a recipe  but I googled it to make sure it was ok. So I found this one and made this recipe times 2, used only 1.5 cans of condensed milk tho and it's still pretty sweet. I doubled up all the other ingredients and added a bit of nutmeg. This is a winner!! Now I'll make it for every holiday!!!

Excellent recipe!! The only thing I did differently is adding a can of coconut milk, used 4 egg yolks & left out the water.  I made a virgin Coquito for my son as well.  Love it!

I made this recipe for Christmas this year.  My Latin neighbors liked my recipe better than their own.  So, with that said, this recipe is the bomb!  I made a double batch and every drop of it went.  I had other guests...not just my neighbors.  haha  Didn't want you to think they drank it all.  :o)  I will make it again next year for sure!!!

Made the recipe as listed with half light and half dark rum, and it was a bit too thick, and way too sweet for my taste. I added an extra can of evaporated milk, an extra half cup of dark rum, and an extra 1/4c water and it's now fantastic.  I might try to substitute the coconut cream for coconut milk as some others have recommended.  Otherwise, the recipe is definitely a keeper!

Yummy!  I decided to try this for Christmas this year...a friend of mine makes a similar recipe every year, and she suggested I omit the nutmeg, and use coconut milk instead of the water.  It was absolutely delicious!  I'll be making this again, for sure!  Thank you!

Made this for a friend who grew up in Puerto Rico and he loved it, said it reminded him of his childhood. He had another friend who made some for him this year too. She is from Puerto Rico and he said this recipe was better than hers, and so did many others. I give it five stars and two thumbs up for taste and ease of preparing. I made mine in the morning and kept it really cold until about and hour and half before serving.  It really does taste best served at almost room temp and not over ice. I tried both ways and not ice cold is best, all the flavors shine. Remember this is a drink that originated from a time and place where ice was a premium and not readily available. Hope you enjoy as much as we did!!

I had never dared to make coquito because it sounded hard to make. I found this recipe december 2012. I read the ingredients but overlooked the directions. I didn't use water but crushed ice. It was delish. December 2013 I looked up the recipe onve more bevause I wasn't to sure if I remembered all the ingredients.....well I noticed your full instructions :-) but I loved it so much the first time skipping the boiler part and just blending everything together. I did add an extra ingredient of 14.oz can of leche de coco-milk of coconut. I love it even more! And this year I used malibu coconut to get that extra coconut flavor.....mu family, co-workers and friends love it!  Thanks Brandy for sharing such a great recipe!

This is awesome even warm. I doubled the recipe and it barely fit my blender . I did not have cream of coconut so instead I used 2 cups of Malibu coconut rum. It's the light Rum not the dark one. I also added one more teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.

I love this recipe & it is a hit with my guests! Since I am from a Puerto Rican family & as far as I can remember, my dad used to make the coquito, but never cooked the eggs yolks with the evaporated milk. Since I have a very severe allergy to raw eggs, this recipe works perfect for me & everyone loves the coquito (even myself). Thank you so much for sharing All recipe.com! :-)

So good! I cooked the egg yolks and milk in a sauce pan on the stove and it worked fine. I also tasted it before adding the condensed milk like a reviewer suggested and it was too watery. After adding the condensed milk it was PERFECT. My husband loved it and for Christmas I will definitely be making A LOT more to share because I really dont want to part with the batch I made. I also added a little more rum. Like Brandy said the rum is supposed to be added "to taste". GREAT recipe thank you for sharing!!

very good recipe. Didn't change a thing, just added a little more cinnamon and 1/2 cup more of rum as that's the way my husband likes it. My family will enjoy this one on Thanksgiving and Christmas. Happy Holidays... Thanks for the recipe.

I made it for the first time to give it a test. And I must say it is DEELISH! I used Bacardi 151 Rum, used half the water and added more rum to replace the water. I might try it without water all together. Going to gift some bottles for Xmas this year. Great recipe…seriously!

It was very good, but I thought it was missing something, so I added more rum and some fresh grated nutmeg.  That hit the spot.  My bartender friends loved loved it.

Excellent, rave reviews.  Everyone asked for seconds which I didn't have because I only made one recipe-worth.  I used half a can of coconut milk and half a can of coconut cream in place of the entire can of coconut cream.  I would say it was still a little too sweet.  I would probably just use the coconut milk next time and add sugar or simple syrup as needed.  I would imagine the brand of coconut cream makes a difference.  Mine was sweetened with corn syrup, a sweetener that all too easily comes across over-sweet.

Made this recipe without egg, but the cream of coconut still kept tge srink thick. Had to reblend every now and then to keep the cream of coconut from clumping up. Very tasty drink!

i made this recipe 2 years ago when i was visiting family in Florida, last year i was pregnant so my rule was 'if I can't drink coquito, NOBODY can!"  But this year, my inbox is full of requests from my friends that had it 2 years ago . . .  THAT should say something about this recipe!  :D  Thanks Brandi!

I would use less sweetened condensed milk. It took away from the other flavors and add more rum. Otherwise, this was a HIT at our holiday celebration. I also didnt use a double broiler. I just stirred the egg yolk and evap milk constantly.

I made a double batch and made it exactly as written. My problem is that I hate cloves so this kind of made me feel a little queasy. But my husband loved it only after he added a lot more rum. At one point I mixed in some cool whip and it was delicious and extra creamy and took away some of the strong clove taste.

Wonderful!!!  My fiance's mom and stepdad (both from Puerto Rico) loved it and said that it tasted just like they had at home!  I substituted pumpkin pie spice for the ground cloves and also added a little extra rum!

Great recipe and a lot easier than grating and straining real coconut.  The only change I made was to add a pinch of nutmeg and replaced the white rum with spiced rum.  I used the double boiler but I agree that it was not necessary, you just have to be more mindful of the mixture as you're heating it.

Very good, but very sweet - needs some more rum (to taste). Also, it tastes better after sitting for a day or two in the fridge.

Thank you so much! This was a major hit at my work...(probably shouldn't have brought it to work) but everyone loved it! I made another batch for Noche bueno!! I boiled the ev. milk and eggs in a smaller pot over a bigger pot filled with water.  Thank you so much! I love the puerto rican culture!

Absolutely love this stuff! Is a touch on the sweet side too, but still very good. I did do a couple of things differently though. First of all, I couldn’t find any cream of coconut so I substituted a can of the sweetened condensed milk and 1 tsp coconut extract for that. Secondly, I didn’t add any rum because my son may want to drink some. So I may add a bit to a glass I have later. And not just any rum, I will try Malibu coconut rum. After it was done in the blender I put it in some cleaned out wine bottles and set them outside for a couple of hours. They ended up freezing (because it’s 30 below today) but thawed in a short period of time. Will definitely make this again for Christmas!

I made a big batch of this for our christmas party and it was a hit.  I only used three eggs and didn't even cook them.  I beat them with some of the milk and presto!  I mixed it in separate batches in my blender.  I used to have my own recipe for coquito, but I am putting it to rest.  Thank you Brandy for your recipe.

Very good. I don't like it too thick so just in case I used the coconut milk, then I thought it was too thin...that's what I get for changing the original recipe.  Great flavor either way!

My best friend is Puerto Rican, so I have had this on many occasions. This tastes just as good as the first time I had it. It was also a really big hit at Thanksgiving. I used coconut rum instead of regular and coconut milk (out of the asian section of the supermarket) instead of cream of coconut.

I was so disappointed in this recipe!  It was way too sweet and did not have enough rum in it.  I ended up pouring it over ice and diluting it with milk.  I poured some of the finished product into narrow-necked glass bottles and the whole thing congealed into a solid.  I was unable to pur it out and had to heat it to clean the bottles.  Thank God I didn't give it away as a present!!!
