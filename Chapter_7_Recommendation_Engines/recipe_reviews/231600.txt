I noticed a few things when this recipe got edited. I used coconut yogurt not coconut milk yogurt. I didn't know this kind of yogurt existed! But it must be great too. Also in step 4 it says honey a second time and the honey should have already been added with the wet ingredients. Overall I hope everyone enjoys!

This recipe was delicious! I made it exactly as written, using coconut flavored Chobani yogurt.  I topped it with the coconut as described and added a few sliced almonds on top.  My family thought they were the BEST muffins they  ever had.  I will definitely make them again!
