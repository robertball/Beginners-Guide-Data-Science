I made this these last year for Christmas and my husband ever demanded that I make more  Changes I made were semisweet chips and I used evaporated milk,it is more likely to be around the house at the holidays than heavy cream.Also I have nut allergies in the house, still good if you leave it off. Great for gift giving

I have to rate this recipe low as written because of one huge mistake.  One pouch of this specific cookie dough only needes 1/2 c of butter, NOT a whole cup.  I actually ruined my first batch of dough because i figured the recipe, written by betty crocker, knew what they were talking about.  I also used a LOT more chocolate chips than called for and still ended up with a pretty thin layer in the bottom.  I used about 10 in each, next time i will double that.  I used a floured glass to press each ball flat before putting in the tin, which worked pretty well as long as it was floured well before each use.  These were cute and pretty easy to put together, but overall i think they needed more chocolate in them.  I added some mini chips to the top and drizzled some of the other ones to compensate.  My husband devoured them.

Delicious!  They are definitely better after they have set overnight.  Creamy, nutty with a little chocolate.  I used semi-sweet mini morsels because that's what I had on hand, so had to eyeball the amount of chocolate suspect mine are more chocolaty then recommended.  I got about 60 tassies out of 1 pouch of BC sugar cookie mix but my first batch was also a little on the smaller size.  I did use the full amt of butter it calls for and found it came together to regular cookie dough consistency.  I used roughly 1.5/8oz bags of caramels and I used fat free half and half, again because I had it on hand.  Was a little tedious making the little cups and filling all of them with fillings/toppings.  It did help that I have a little muddler type thing to shape the dough to the mini muffin pan.  I also sprayed my muddler with cooking spray and it didn't stick as much to the dough.  They are totally worth all the steps!  I expect to be getting requests to make these again.

These were VERY good, don't get me wrong, but I will never make them again. The boxed sugar cookie dough was so hard to work with and way too sticky to form to the mini muffin cups. Also, there has to be an easier way for the Caramel filling, the carmel had to constantly be stirred, or else it would instantly burn to the bottom of the pan, even when on low-heat. And it made WAY too much for the little cookies. I was stuck with a pot FULL of sticky caramel, so cleanup was NOT fun. I told my friends and boyfriend that even if this was the best cookie theyve ever tried... I'm never making it ever again! Not worth the hassle. With that being said... they were really really good. UGH.

These were so yummy, the only thing that I had against them were that they were very chewy and they got stuck in your teeth. I made them during thanksgiving and they were a great treat!

Overall, I like this recipe. I think they came out tasting very nice. I however think the recipe its self is written incorrectly. I would use 2 packages of cookie mix with the cup of butter and 1 bag of caramels. 
I used milk instead of whipping cream and the caramel came out just fine. I also used the end of a rolling pin to push the dough down. I found that worked really well.
