I'm surprised this recipe doesn't have more rave reviews. This was easy, the ingredients readily available, and delicious! Made it exactly as written for our 4th of July picnic. I used a rolling pin (wrapped in parchment paper to prevent sticking) to ensure even thickness on the baking sheet. I cut it to the size of the Hawaiian bread rolls, using a pizza slicer. I topped it with American cheese and ketchup, pickles optional. I received so many compliments. Thank you for sharing this!

I have never left a review (even though I have read hundreds on this site to help me pick all my favorites).  But I felt it worthy to review this recipe since they are so amazing, so easy, and because there are not many reviews already.  These sliders were so easy to whip together and my very picky husband and children flipped over them.  I did not change a thing.  I will definitely be making these again.  I'm already thinking about how perfect they'll be for the Superbowl party.  Thank You!

Quick, easy, and delicious! They taste just like White Castle sliders (if not better). The recipe worked with just 1lb of 90/10 ground beef. We also sauteed half a diced sweet onion (EVO/salt/pep) and smeared that  on top of the beef after 10m, then layered the whole thing with 'Murican cheese slices and cooked it another 5m. We didn't have pickle slices but relish works just as well. We sliced it w/ a pizza slicer. Yeahhhh boiii.

3.21.18  I grew up in the Midwest, where we called White Castles®  belly bombers, and I ate my share of them!  I mixed up the beef, put half of it in the freezer, and made 12 burgers today.  I took the suggestion of one reviewer and put down a layer of finely chopped onions beneath the big burger patty (would recommend you try this) because that’s how they’re cooked on the grill (no beef broth as was suggested), used a straw to poke ventilation holes in the big patty, and cut them to fit the bun with a pizza cutter.  The one thing that was omitted from this recipe was a dill pickle slice for each burger, it's important;  as I recall, that’s something they always had.  The only thing that would bring this recipe closer to the real deal (other than having that little cardboard box), is to steam the buns, they need to be softer, and I will try that  the next time.  Had some burgers left today which I wrapped up individually in plastic wrap,  then into the freezer to be reheated at a low temp in the microwave.  Please, no American cheese or Dusseldorf mustard, just a plain White Castle®, the way they always were sold (and yes, I remember when they were 12-15¢).  Gotta tell ya, an indulgence for sure, but I totally enjoyed this, it was like a  " blast from the past!"  ***UPDATE 6.2.18:  Today, I  steamed the  finished burger, and OMG, now they’re the real deal!

We are calling them homemade  Krystal burgers. I made them for Girls' Night Out and didn't make it out the door without my husband snagging a few. My friends were surprised to find out I hadn't gotten them at the drive through. That first time I followed the recipe precisely. Changing it too much defeats the purpose anyway, right? The next time  I used ground sirloin instead of chuck to reduce the fat, and nicer rolls.

Do use a larger cookie sheet than called for, and roll the meat all the way to the edges.  If it sticks to the side a little it will reduce shrinkage.  Also, if you can slice the rolls all in one piece, you can put on a slab of meat and top it all with cheese at once. Cutting the rolls apart afterward is easier than making two dozen individual burgers.

@ TWITCH RADIO: The information in your comment comment is completely incorrect. White Castle was the first fast-food hamburger system ever developed, starting in 1921 by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson. Krystal restaurants didn't start until 1932, over 10 years after White Castle, the basic idea being copied from the White Castle system after a visit to a White Castle location by Rody Davenport, Jr., and J. Glenn Sherrill, the founders of Krystal. The two systems are only similar in the certain appearance aspects of the finished hamburger. The cooking methods are entirely different, being that the White Castle hamburger patty is steam cooked on a bed of onions and water, and is never flipped; while the Krystal is fried and flipped halfway through the cooking process. White Castle is THE FIRST AND ORIGINAL fast-food system. The two companies are completely unrelated. May I suggest that you please get your fact straight before you publish erroneous, potentially scurrilous information here that only propagates rumors and muddies the waters for folks who don't know the true story. It is irresponsible comments like yours that further untrue stories about the quality and of fast-food restaurants and other businesses.

OMG so amazing! I used 2 lbs of ground turkey and cooked for 15 minutes. I served on wheat Hawaiian rolls. I have already shared the recipe with many of my co-workers. Thank you so much for sharing.

These were the best.  Easy.  I made the hamburgers up and then steamed them in a fry pan on a rack.  Will make again.  Thank you  for posting.

These were really good. I chopped the pickles with some vadalia onion. I used a kitchen shears to cut up the sheet of burgers to the right size. I made 24 for 5 people and they disappeared. in minutes!  I will be making these again for a crowd....but this time I will make a lot more! Thanks for the recipe!

I'm from MN visiting my mom who is also from MN and she missed white castle so much, the other version they have of it down here just wasn't cutting it for her so I found this recipe. We were so skeptical at first but it turned out AMAZING !! This recipe is even better than white castle!

I'm from NY and moved to VA. We do not have WC here in VA. I often miss my yummy burgers and the frozen ones do not cut it. I changed this recipe up a bit. Cross between this recipe and another but I put chopped onions and some beef broth on the bottom of the pan. Meat on top. Straw holes. Cheese.

These were amazing. I pressed them into a 8 x 10 baking dish for a slightly thicker slider and added caramelized onions and cheese.  Super easy and quick to make.

I have made this 4 times following the recipe as written each time. Then I read a review that suggested smearing fried chopped onions on top!! Well I thought they couldn't get any better but that was the bomb!! Quick and easy to make and delicious to eat!

I'm planning a burger bar at an upcoming holiday party and I made this last night to try.  Super easy and tastes great! I stuck to the recipe but I wound up grinding the onion soup to a powder (for my picky child.)  I also followed another commenter and rolled out the meat between two pieces of parchment paper. That makes it much easier to create a thin, consistent patty.  I used foil on my cookie sheet and placed the meat on a cookie rack on the sheet.  The grease then dripped into the pan.  Worked great and easy to clean up!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these for a weekend lunch meal and my Hubby and picky eater teenager couldn't get enough of them!! They are simple to mix together and lightning quick to bake.  Ready in under a half an hour! I followed the recipe to the letter and served them on Hawaiian Sweet Rolls.  PERFECT!

Loved this recipe.  So easy to make.  Made it on a Friday for my kids after a long week at work.  They loved it as well.  I did find it took way longer then ten minutes to cook but I will try and to cook the meat thinner next time

Ok. I grew up eating White Castle hamburgers, I have one about a hour drive from me and make the trek several times a year just to fulfill my craving. These are _not_ "White Castle" hamburgers, not even close.

They are tasty, and very quick and easy to prepare, but they a far distant cousin to the real thing. Thanks for your recipe though.

Very delicious! I only had Italian bread crumbs, but i don’t think it made a difference. I’ll try to flatten them more next time. Meat shrunk and we had some thick patties. Very good, will make recipe again!

I don’t live too terribly far from a real White Castle restaurant, but far enough that I don’t feel like driving.  I make these and some air fried crinkle fries and my teenagers don’t miss the real thing a bit!

Delicious! Not exactly White Castle but there was a hint of its flavors. You can tell it’s homemade and better than takeout. It gets a “make again good” rating in my house.

Huge hit in our house, especially with my little kiddos. Followed recipe. I did bake it on a baking sheet with foil under. Easier clean up! Will definitely make this again. Great weeknight meal

My family has never experienced White Castle, so we can't do an actual comparison on that. However, everyone loved how these turned out! They were super easy to make and will be added to our regular menu. Yay!!

I will not get White Castle anymore these aren’t close, these are dead on the same taste, just a quick tip, if you take a bun and size the width against the meat then you can use a pizza cutter to cut out perfect size sliders to fit the bun!!!!

I've made these countless times for parties, potlucks, tailgates etc., and they are always a hit.  They taste just like  White Castles, the main difference being the burger patty is a tad thicker.  I follow the recipe exactly.  Spread out and flatten the beef in the pan evenly as best as you can, and don't forget to prick with a fork before putting in the oven.  The meat will shrink when cooking, but you will still get 24 burgers.  Cut them easily and quickly w/a pizza cutter. I use the Kings Hawaiian rolls (original) for the buns, and I put a small piece of Am. Cheese and a pickle on each one.  They fit nicely in a 9x13 pyrex dish, which you can then put in a carry container to keep warm and take to your destination.  Or, you can cover the dish w/foil and keep the burgers in the oven on warm.

I've never had a White Castle but I have had Krystals and this recipe sure took me back to the last time I had one... or four!  I followed the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and put the diced onion underneath the ground beef in the pan.  I also used the Hawaiian rolls thought my husband said he's not completely sure he's a fan of the sweet/savory combo so I'll go with regular dinner rolls next time.  Also I did steam them a bit as I remember Krystal burgers being a bit squishy!  SO GOOD... and easy! Who knew!

Looks easy enough, and I’d like to try it if my Broncos make it back to a Super Bowl!
 But I mainly am writing to point out that White Castles originated in Wichita,KS, not the Chicago, or even Florida areas.
 I buy them in the 16-pack, frozen, in the grocery, because there are no White Castle/Krystal stores in Colorado Springs!

I made them into regular sized hamburgers and barbecued them. Absolutely delicious. I also made Homemade Hamburger Buns by Chef John from this site and they went together perfectly.

I am a Chicago Girl Born and Raised in the greatest city of all and lived there until 2000 when we moved to Belvidere IL and there is no Castles close and it's hard to recover from a night out without them.  I still have my Chicago Accent and talk fast and they don't like that out here, and I made these and they were wonderful,  I can save gas now. I gave some out to people I know and they asked "you really pay for these" suburbanites they don't know good food if it smacked them in the face.  THANK YOU FOR SHARING

Spot on, the family loved them. We’re a mix between the Midwest and the South. They ate theirs as White Castle’s, and I threw some mustard and pickles on mine like Krystal’s. King’s Hawaiian Savory Butter Rolls worked perfectly. Thanks!

Fantastic recipe!!  However, I added some steak seasoning and a little Worcester sauce to the ground beef mixture.  Then I put medium cheddar slices on the ground beef for the last minute or so. HUGE HIT with the family!

Really does taste similar to white castles. You have to spread the meat thin and put just a thin square cheddar to top it off after removing from the oven. Will definitely make again.

This was very good.  It tasted a lot like meatloaf and I used leftovers for a meatloaf sandwich commercial with mashed potatoes and gravy. Yum!

These are a crowd favorite every time!!! One hint- avoid the sweet buns unless that's the flavor you're going for. Also these are really good when steamed in the bag or microwave.

This is as close to a White Castle as you can get without buying the real thing.

I made the recipe as written but the meat shrunk and I was only able to get 15. The boys at happy hour liked it, so they said , I guess it was a success.

It was delicious. I substituted the onion soup for ranch seasoning and dry barbecue rub.

I doubled the recipe and used ground turkey.  The kids LOVED it and were excited there's  enough left over to take to school for lunch.

Super simple and delicious! Can always add a homemade sauce or other condiments. I like to put the sliders in the oven for 2-3 minutes to make them crispy. Overall delicious recipe and super easy!
