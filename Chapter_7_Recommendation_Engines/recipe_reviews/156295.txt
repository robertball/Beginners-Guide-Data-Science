Delicious!  The guests at my party ate this up!  I made this recipe using medium heat spicy sausage and medium salsa.  I also used a hand mixer to combine the sour cream with a block of cream cheese before adding that layer. I made sure to chill this dip in the refrigerator for a few hours before serving to solidify all the of layers.  I suggest serving scoop-shaped tortilla chips with this dip.

This is easy, fast, and tasty. I recommend using a 9x13 instead of the suggested 7x11. The dip is too hearty for a chip to make it through all 7 layers in a 7x11!

Let me start off by saying that I am a terrible cook and therefore struggle when I am asked to bring something to a dinner party. This was SO EASY!!! I took it to a friend's house last night and "My Dip" was a rave of the party!

I made this taco dip for my sons birthday party and everyone loved it!  It was excellent the day of and excellent the day after!!  I made the recipe with low fat/fat free alternatives and it still tasted excellent!  The only recommendation I have is use a HUGE casserole dish, otherwise it's going to overflow (and the recipe does call for a little more olives and green onions than I actually used.  I think I cut the portions of those two in half).

Everyone loved this.  I did use hamburger instead of sausage.  It was perfect in a 9 x 13 dish.  Six adults ate about 1/2 so I'd say it serves 16.

LOVE THIS! I don't use any meat or chilis. I just heat the beans while mixing with taco seasoning, and then add the layers.

Tastes even better if you broil it for 5 minutes or until cheese in melted.  Great dish, cold or hot.

I made this for a party and then later for the kids.  I made a few changes based on taste...skipped the olives and chilies, added lettuce and more cheese.  It's always a big hit.

This was ok.  Nothing really outstanding.  It's like just about any other 7 layer dip.  I'm still looking to find one like my coworkers...

I thought this was OK, I made some last additions because it was a little bland in my opinion. I squeezed lemon on top and some salt. Is it just me, or does this need some guacamole in there?

Made it for superbowl and everyone loved it.  Cooked the sausage and taco seasoning together so the seasoning wasn't crunchy and blended in better. I also added a layer of guacamole (i just mashed avacodo, lemon and lime juice, onion, garlic and touch of salsa together- no salt because the first layer is salty enough).  Anyway, it was really good and I'll make it again

I haven't tried this with the sausage yet and i cut out the tomato layer because i like the salsa better (it's just too much tomato for me with both)and mix a pack of cream cheese with the sour cream.  It is very good and it goes over great at parties.

Eh. The beans came out way too salty and slightly crunchy due to the taco seasoning. It's a lot of can opening for basic ingredients - I would rather put it on a platter for people to pick & choose from, 'cause once the eating starts it can get really messy. Mexican food is prevalent where I live in CA; this recipe seemed mediocre.

Made with turkey sausage and added cheese layer before sour cream so it would melt into the bean mixture.  Makes a huge quantity.

Great dish- However, Im surprised no one has mentioned with the sausage & the tasco seasoning, it makes it very salty.  Will be using ground beef/turkey next time.

This definitely serves more then 8 ppl.

The trick to this recipe to make it absolutely amazing is the variety of ingredients you pick. You can get the regular taco mix, or salsa. But when I made it the second time I had mango salsa and spicy taco seasoning, or spicy refried beans. I don't remember but basically go for ingredients with some added flavors to give it that oomph!

I also never use sausage, but ground beef.

Great recipe! The sausage puts a nice twist on the "original" 7-layer dip.

This was quite good, I think I would have liked it better with ground beef, but thats just a personal opinion. Everyone else loved it!

Very good- always a crowd pleaser! I substitute the regular sausage with mexican chirizo sausage; which gives it an bold, authentic mexican flavor.

This dip is amazing!!!  I made it and within 2-3 hours is was gone between 3 or 4 people.  The only thing I changed was I used jalapenos instead of green chilies.  I can't wait to make this again, its absolutley a hit.

EXCELLENT! We are cheese lovers, so after spreading the sausage/bean mixture in the bottom of that pan we added a ton of cheese and baked it for a bit just to melt the cheese, then added the rest of the ingredients on top. Only 4 of us sharing the dip and we were scraping the dish!

I made a few personal changes (turkey, not sausage, and no black olives) added some things (spicy Guacamole and jalapeno beans for some zing, and a little lettuce on top for color) and it was AMAZING!  Great recipe!

I made this for a work-team potluck and everyone loved it. That's all they want me to take everytime we have a potluck. I made it for my husbands birthday party and it went so, so fast. Love this receipe. We don't have bob evans sausage so I used HEB brand Taco sausage with a package of taco seasoning for added kick and it worked just fine. Yumm!

Excellent!! Everyone always begs me to make it for parties, etc. Sometimes I omit olives, sometimes add guacamole dip layer in. It's gone by the end of the night!
