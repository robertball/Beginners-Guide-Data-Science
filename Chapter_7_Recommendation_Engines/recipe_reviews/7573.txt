I made chocolate mousse (doubled  the recipe) and I had 10 egg whites left over so this recipe was a perfect way to use them.  The cake tasted super.  I didn't have almond extract on hand, so I used only vanilla.  I didn't make the frosting.  I'm thinking about using whipped cream and fresh strawberries to finish off the cake.  I doubled the cake recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!
