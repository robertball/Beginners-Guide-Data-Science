I LOVED THIS STUFF!!  

I served it with polenta, first time mushy in a bowl, but the bulk of the polenta I had poured onto a cookie tray & refrigerated, so I took slices, fried them, warmed up the eggplant mixture and spooned it over it. Yummy both ways! The buttery warm polenta enhances the flavor of the eggplant mixture! That and a salad makes a great dinner.

I just had one eggplant at the time, so I used 1 tomato, 1 pepper (red cuz I don't like green peppers), about 1/2 an onion, about 1/2 the sugar & salt, but I didn't reduce the liquids by much. 

I will be making this often! I have eggplants in my garden but I've never been a big fan. I am so happy to have found a way to cook them that I love so much!

This is an excellent recipe.I am South American , from Uruguay and we also make it , we call it "escabeche''. You can serve it over baked slices of baguette, as an appetizer. To store it , just put it in a glass jar with a tight lid and it lasts a long time in the fridge. We also do use the same recipe but instead of eggplants you can use chicken  .

Krasnoyarsk is a Sister City with my hometown Oneonta, NY, so I had to try this out. Natalia has shared a good one! I found I liked it best shaking a little creole seasoning or a drop of Tabasco as a topping  to my cracker and eggplant. I'm sure that is not a Russian tradition, but it sure tastes good!  ???????!

Wow.  Really good!  I am from the former USSR, and while in the area I lived we make this dish differently, I tried this recipe, and it was so much less work than my usual recipe, and the flavor was so different, even though the ingredients are very similar.  I recommend everyone to try it!  Really good!!! UPDATE!!! I have found that the longer this sits, the better it tastes!!!  In fact, don't bother eating it the day you make it - you will only be disappointed.  Further, when I was in a pinch one time, I have substituted canned plain tomato sauce (not pasta sauce) for the tomatoes, and actually like the tanginess of this version better.  I definitely recommend it.  I have not stopped making my traditional Russian Eggplant Caviars, but this has definitely earned a place on our permanent eggplant rotation.

This was absolutely delicious, and so easy (although chopping all the veggies took some time).  I used balsamic vinegar as I didn't have any red wine vinegar, but I think the color would be more attractive with red wine vinegar.  I ate it with baguette slices toasted in the oven until crunchy.  It tasted even better the next day.  I think this would be a great choice to take for a potluck.

I've made this several times and love it.  Very easy for a quick meal with flavored rice (e.g. Mexican Rice III antoher great recipe) .   I even use the leftovers on top of my salad instead of a dressing.  Very healthy.

Truly delicious!  Husband was very skeptical at first, but he was easily won over.  Had for dinner atop of broiled polenta slices.  Will also try on toasted baguette slices with fresh moz.

I was very disappointed in this recipe and I'm SOOOOO glad I didn't use the original proportions of ingredients, but only wasted one of each of the vegetables. The mixture come out to be a very strange and unappealing flavor and I think it needs A LOT more work to turn in into a decent appetizer.

loved it! made the serving measurements for 10pp because I wanted to try the recipe out first and made just a few minor tweaks to the recipe:

- Used 1/2 lemon instead of red wine vinegar since I didn't have any on hand
- Used 1/4 cup tomato sauce because I was fresh out of tomatoes 
-Added 2 minced garlic cloves to the mixture because I'm a freak like that and could never even consider cooking without garlic! ;)

YUM!

Liked, not loved it. Served with crackers but didn't receive any positive comments. If I'm going through all those steps for an appetizer I prefer 5 stars! My DH thought it was a salsa, I like the red wine vinegar taste.  If you're not sure, make a small batch first.

Very tasty!  I didn't have peppers, so I substituted sliced black olives.  I also added a few shakes of pepper.  I served it over sliced, toasted Italian bread (sprinkled with a tiny bit of olive oil, garlic salt, pepper, basil and rosemary).  I'll bet this would be great over chicken cutlets or pasta.  Very easy to make, will definitely make it again.  Thanks!!

Excellent! Loved it!!! I tried with one eggplant using one tomato, capsicum and chopped onion. I halved the sugar, salt and other ingredients , used balsamic vinegar and also squeezed some blood orange slices that I had. Cooked on high heat until boiling then reduced heat and removed when the syrup reduced. I will definitely keep this in my favourite recipes folder.

So flavorful and so easy to make! Can be consumed warm or cold, as a side with grilled meat, as a dip or in top of a toast. I am so glad I found it!

i had to scale the recipe down due to not having enough egglant, but after tasting the outcome I'll be making more.  We loved it on bread, baked potatoes and mashed potatoes. Great idea to jar to enjoy all year.

Great way to use up an eggplant when you/ve got a big garden crop.  I put it into jars which I plan to keep in the fridge for daily appetizer use.  I added a generous shaking of dried basil and liked the added flavor.  Ate a small extra serving mixed with some leftover rice for a good lunch.
