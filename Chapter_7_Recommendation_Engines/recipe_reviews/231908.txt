I prepared this marinade for flank steak and it was delicious!  Only regret is I marinated for about 8 hours, I would have liked to marinate overnight.  Prepared as written with a good dry sherry, plenty of marinade.  Thanks for "sherry-ing" your recipe Holland House.

I come from a background of Mexican cuisine. Skirt steak is also know as arrachera. This is the best skirt steak I have ever eaten. I used tomato sauce because I didn't have crushed tomatoes and it was delicious. I can't imagine changing a thing after tasting it, and have shared the recipe with family in Mexico. Great reviews. I will make it this way forever.

This one's a keeper. I made it as written with two (one unintended) exceptions. I used cider vinegar because I didn't have any sherry, and I added some oregano. It came out great and was very easy to make. Thanks for the recipe. :)

This was very good. I added a bit of Sazon and it made the flavors really come together. I also added cilantro and a jalapeno. It was really good. I used a skirt steak. I marinated it with my vacuum sealer all day and the flavors really penetrated and were perfect.

Great, simple recipe, I used half the wine and eased up on a few other things. I like this bc you can adjust it to your family's tastes, thanks for sharing!

Mouth-gasm! Made as directed and wouldn't change a thing. Sliced it thin and made burritos. Ah-may-zing!

My husband and I loved this flavoring.  My only slight change was to use a can of diced tomatos with the chipoltle chilis already added into it instead of buying the cans separately and having so many chipoltle chilis left over.  Rotel I think was the brand but not the original Rotel with the green chilis-the can that has chipolte chilis in it.   I also would recommend reserving some of the marinade before pouring over the raw meat to drizzel on before eating if you like a bit more of the sauce.  I used skirt steak and marinated for about 5 hours and it was really tender.

Did not like this.  Soy sauce and vinegar marinades are better.  Was ok on shrimp.  Would not make again.

I used real sherry, two chipotles rather than three, chili powder instead of cumin, and three cloves garlic instead of four. Still the garlic seemed to overpower all other ingredients. High heat needed for cooking or it won't brown. Cooked it med rare. I wasn't impressed.
