We've made this a couple years in a row, and have learned a few things along the way. If you want really crunchy caramel/toffee, then let the butter sugar mixture cook closer to 8 min. If you want a more crumbly texture cook it closer to 5 min. We like it both ways. Apparently, our coworkers wait all year for this stuff. They've dubbed it "Christmas Crack"

I debated about using a candy thermometer when I made this because 5-8 minutes didn't seem long enough to get to a hard crack temp, but decided to just follow the directions.  
So, it didn't end up like toffee, but ended up like caramel. I let it set overnight and it was just a soft, sticky mess.  I was able to break it apart into individual pretzels - and it still tastes good, it's just a mess.  

If I made it again, I'd use a candy thermometer so that the caramel hardens into toffee.  Otherwise, it was good!

Yummy and so easy! I let my butter and sugar mixture boil on medium heat for 8 minutes. After pouring it over the pretzels, I found putting it in the oven for 5 minutes sort of allowed the mixture to spread itself evenly over the pretzel, filling in the gaps! After sprinkling semi-sweet chocolate chips and returning them to the oven as directed, I took a knife and gently spread them on top of the rest. I Let them cool off in the fridge for an hour as instructed and they were the perfect hardness to break them into portions! The don't last very long around here

I made this for Christmas gifts this year. Easy to make and very well received. I used semi-sweet chips as I had a bag open.

I used stale pretzels I was actually going to throw out. So glad I didn't, because this is super yummy! I didn't have quite the full 2 cups of chocolate chips (I was using semi sweet), so I did use a handful of milk chocolate chips to make up the difference. Seriously easy AND tasty?? I'm making this one over and over!

OMG! This was LOVE at first bite! I cooked the caramel the full 8 minutes stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Poured over the pretzels thr best I could and like others ssid, it will spread on its own. Baked 5 minutes, sprinkled chocolate chips, popped back in the oven for one minute then lightly spread the melted chips. I used my sea salt grinder snd lightly salted the muxture. I put the still hot cookie sheet on a towel in the fridge for an hour but the chocolate was still soft so I put it in the freezer for an hour. Absolutely delucious. Thank you for the grest recipe. Note: Use non-stick aluminum foil for essy removal.

I made this recipe last night.  I had regular sized pretzels, so I crumbled them up enough to cover the cookie sheet, without crushing them to crumbs.  I cooked the caramel for 3 minutes (from a different recipe).  The caramel is still a little gooey, so I will definitely cook longer next time.  I tried to spread the caramel before baking, but after taking them out of the oven, realized that was a waste because it bubbles up and spreads on its own.  I used semi-sweet chocolate and spread with silicone spatula after removing from oven after 1 minute.  Then, I forgot the sea salt but didn't really miss it.  The taste is amazing.   Three of my favorites in one treat!!!

Followed the recipe exactly and the candy turned out perfectly. I used flavored salt (almond cardamom and a pink peppercorn and chile salt). Yum!  Easy and inexpensive Christmas gift for neighbors and coworkers.   Making a third batch tomorrow.

This was delicious, quick and easy.  I was looking for a good "bark" recipe.  I followed the directions to the letter and wow!  Delicious!  It takes minutes to make and is a fantastic, easy, and inexpensive gift to give to family and friends.  This will be added to my list of desserts for the holidays.  

I found this recipe (same ingredients) on another site, followed the directions and it came out gooey and horrible.  I ended up throwing the whole thing away.  I then searched on All Recipes (my go-to recipe site) and found this recipe with completely different directions.  I decided to give it one more try and I'm so happy I did. 

It tastes more like toffee than caramel and go easy on the salt.

I make this in variations every year.  This year I sprinkled the toffee layer with Skor bits before I drizzled it with chocolate.  I prefer a chocolate drizzle to putting the chips over top and melting them.  I have also added nuts and coconut to the toffee layer in the past.  Delicious.

Very, very easy and delicious. I used non- stick aluminum foil to line the tray, and put it in the freezer for 15 minutes: no sticky mess.

This is so yummy and easy to make!  I made two batches. The first one I mixed the chocolate to coat everything like the recipe said. The second batch I just let it melt and lightly spread it - I did not mix. I liked the way it looked better without mixing so I will do it that way again. I also put it in the refrigerator before breaking into pieces. Hard not to eat each piece as I broke it all apart!

I deviated from the recipe in that I used semi-sweet choc. chips and omited the salt at the end.  I read MANY reviews for this recipe and others like it and was hesitant  due to the conflicting comments about temperature and whether the toffee would set.  Well, I followed this recipe almost exactly.  The end result was delicious, but not quite  a candy (toffee) consistency b/c it turned out a bit grainy and chewy, but it was not a soft mess.  I was not exatly as firm as I expected it.  And it tastes DELICIOUS!!!  FYI, I have very little experience making candy, but I can follow directions.  In addition, I live in a humid area but made this on a clear cool day.

I used white chocolate, peanuts and on top of the melted chocolate I sprinkled crushed candy canes. ( and a few dried cranberries and kosher salt.) Boiled sugar and butter on med... while stirring for 8 minutes to get the crunchy effect of toffee. Seems like it’s pretty good but not completely  cold yet!

Soggy mess.  Toffee is really misleading.  This is a crumbly mess that is impossible to package in any decent presentation.  Tried it twice.  Waste of expensive ingredients.

Very easy and very tasty. I used large pretzels and crushed them. I actually prefer this to get a more consistent bottom layer.

I rated it a 3 because the end result tasted good but the process was horrible.  First of all never again foil!  I baked it 7 minutes thinking 8 might be too brittle but from other reviews 5 minutes was not enough.  Mine was still very much a Carmel.  I used milk chocolate chips and it would melt almost as soon as I touched it.  It made cutting them up a nightmare.  Between the foil sticking and the chocolate melting I was a mess.  But it tasted so good that I am not giving up on it and may try wax paper over foil.  I also may try the bark chocolate squares in hopes that this would not melt so quickly.  I made sure I also had them in the fridge right before company would arrive.  I am submitting the picture of how soft they were while trying to peel them off of the foil. I

I had such high hopes for this based upon the reviews.  I made it, no changes, and it was “eh.”  I mean, it wasn’t bad per se but it just wasn’t great — it was SO sweet, it wasn’t enjoyable.  It was easy enough and I guess if you like REALLY sweet things, this is right up your alley.

Tastes good, but didn't harden completely (maybe due to humidity where I live?) so it's a mess to eat, and I can't really  package it up to give away.  We'll just have to eat it at home!:^)

Easy to follow recipe with delicious results. I followed the recipe exactly and the caramel came out perfect; soft not brittle like toffee and without being a runny mess as others have described. I think the key is waiting for it to thicken and removing it from heat as soon as it gets thick.

I prefer to keep this in the freezer (& sneak out a piece at a time!). I have made it many times and the butter and sugar don't seem to look like much until about minute 5 or 6.  By minute 8 it is nice and frothy. I lay parchment paper on my cookie sheet.  Freeze overnight before breaking into pieces (then it is easy and not sticky).  I have brought it to many potlucks & it is always super popular. Addictive!

Delicious even if it was kind of a pain to make. You definitely need to cook the brown sugar mixture and keep mixing it for a while and I melted the chocolate then poured it over the pretzel brown sugar mixture and mixed it all up instead of putting it back in the oven.

Oh my chocolatey goodness! My husband and I loved this - especially my husband, who is a chocoholic. We doubled the chocolate chips because it just didn't seem like enough and I couldn't find mini pretzels, so I had to use pretzel sticks - which we broke in halves and thirds. Came out perfect!
