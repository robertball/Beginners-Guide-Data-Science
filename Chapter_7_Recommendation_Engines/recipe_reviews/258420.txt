I love this salad! Sooo yummy, unique, wholesome, sweet, savory, and refreshing. 
The nectarines and dressing really make this special. The more ripe and tasty the the fruit, the better. 
My recipe is slightly different and does not include bell pepper and I use whole can of chickpeas, plus the nectarines are chopped up and stirred into the salad. Also 1/2c finely chopped up fresh spinach (or greens).
