I was born & raised in Japan, I tried this out of curiosity, compared to the traditional sukiyaki it was quite salty. I think i'll stick to the traditional style. thanks anyway!

This was a strange combination of ingredients, I thought.  Not something I will cook again.

This isn't sukiyaki...!  Have you ever even had real sukiyaki before?  Please change the name of this recipe to something like "Asian Beef" or something.

I love this recipe so easy, and it was delicious to my taste. While browning the meat, i added lots of pepper though, i find it gives the meat a bit more flavor and compliments each ingredient. I also added baby corn to my vegetable mix, and added more mushroom because I love mushrooms=) Thanks for this recipe!!!

We made this last night, we loved it.  I do have to say that I've never had Sukiyaki Beef so I am not comparing it to how it is from a restaurant - just how it came out and what we thought of it. I was looking for a recipe to use up certain items before they spoiled, and this recipe worked out perfectly for that. We followed the recipe exactly except I only had frozen spinach to add.  Oh ya and I added garlic.  We will definitely make this again!

Quite good! Very simple. Low-carb. The store was out of spinach (can you believe it?) so I used collard greens and it still turned out very tasty. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 just because the flavor wasn't super outstanding, but it's definitely worth making again. Thanks for posting.

My family and I really enjoyed this meal. I was out of celery so I had to skip that ingredient and next time I fix it I will use a low sodium beef broth, I found it was a bit salty for my taste.

I thought this was a tasty dish.  Fast and easy too.  I used chicken and chicken stock and omitted the celery, and I threw in some cold cooked rice to make it more of a fried rice type dish.  I liked the flavor combination of the spinach and mushrooms.  Very good.  I would make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This stuff was great, and easy to do! I did thicken the beef broth with a little corn starch for a nice texture. and I used the vegetables I had on hand which included zuchinni and bok choy.

Tasty!!  But next time, instead of beef I am going to try chicken or shrimp.  The beef was too tough.
