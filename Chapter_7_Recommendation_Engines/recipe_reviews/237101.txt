I used to go to town with my Mom 50 years ago and we always ate at the S&W Cafeteria in Lynchburg Va.  I always got spoon bread and love it.  This recipe tastes and lloks just like that wonderful Southern spoon bread. Loved it as is.

I tried this recipe to use up light cream I had on hand.  I usually use another recipe that is similar, but with 2% milk.  This had good taste -I like the addition of honey- but was ultimately too heavy for our tastes.
