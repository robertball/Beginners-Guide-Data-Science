Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, using frozen blueberries that I did not defrost prior to adding. I was skeptical about the sugar in the pan, afraid the cake would stick or burn, but voila, it came out easily and the sugar made an amazing crunchy crust.  I took it to work and got rave reviews, people couldn't believe how moist it was, and that the berries had been frozen. I'll make it again and again and again.

This cake was fantastic!! I was a little worried at first because the batter was rather thick but it turned out soo moist.  Instead of using butter to grease the pan, I used nonstick spray and it came out perfect.

Delicious. . . add the juice and rind of one lemon or orange and replace blueberries with cranberries for a nice variation!

I was not happy with this recipe at all until I played with it.  The batter was thick, heavy; more like a buckle than a pound cake.  I didn't like it and wasn't even about to attempt to fold in the blueberries with it like that.  I grabbed the milk from the fridge and just poured as I mixed it in, not measuring, until it looked like a nice, fluffy cake batter - I don't know, maybe 2/3 to 3/4 cup or so.  I skipped the step of coating the blueberries with the flour, and just added that 1/4 cup of flour right away to the batter.  I always found that step of dubious value anyway.  The end result with the cake was terrific - but in my mind, only because I added the milk (or buttermilk, or sour cream, or whipping cream, or extra eggs) that it needed.

UPDATE:  I have now made and "taken" this cake many times.  EVERY TIME, it turns out moist and delicious.  I did make a thin glaze out of powdered sugar and lemon juice last time and I believe this is the favorite!  BETTER THE 2ND DAY.  I made it according to the directions except I baked it in a bundt pan.  I will make one change next time:  Before adding the blueberries, I will spoon some of the "plain" batter into the bottom of the pan.  Some of the blueberries in the very bottom stuck even though my pan was VERY well greased.  I would take this *anywhere*!

I had picked fresh blueberries this weekend and was looking for another way to cook them other than muffins or in pancakes.  I am very particular about the recipies that I choose but this one stuck out as being something different and easy to conjure up.  I was amazed at how precise the directions were.  No need to add any extras to this one and I think fresh blueberries are the best way to go, as it totally brings out the flavor.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, the family enjoyed it.

Yum, yum, YUMMY!  My daughter wanted to make a blueberry cake for her cooking day.  I haven't been successful in this department.  This one was awesome!  Very easy to make and very tasty!  We enjoyed it with custard for our evening dessert.  I used fresh frozen blueberries straight from the freezer, no thawing necessary.  We also baked it in a 9x12 inch pan as I don't have a ring pan.  I can't recall how long it baked on that temp but I think it was around 40-50 minutes.  Awesome cake and will be making it again!

I'm thinking that I must have done something wrong because I didn't really like this!!  It tasted just ok.  I made it for a group and it did not go over well.  I wasn't sure what a tube pan was so I used a bundt pan which was stoneware, that may have taken away from the topping??

Yummy!  This makes a very thick batter, and I was tempted to add milk or something to thin it out.  But I'm glad I didn't--it's excellent--moist and sweet.  I didn't put sugar in the pan after greasing, just greased and floured as I usually do--was afraid the sugar might make it burn too easily.  Really good!!

Super recipe. I baked the cake in a greased and paper lined 9 x 13 inch pan for 60 minutes. I added 2 tsp of vanilla and didn't bother with the sugar, butter thing in the pan. When it was cool I trimmed and sliced. Best blueberry cake I have ever eaten and my husband, who is a no dessert kind of guy, can't get enough of this cake. This kind of cake is better the next day so this is the perfect recipe for making ahead. I have made this 3 times now and each time used blueberries past their prime. Definately a keeper! 

I want to add that I have used this recipe to make super blueberry cupcakes. I added about 1/4 a cup of buttermilk to make the batter slightly thinner and baked at 350 for 23 minutes. Frosted with a blueberry cream cheese frosting. Very pretty.

I'm finally getting around to rating this recipe.  I've used it numerous times, and have always liked it.  Then I noticed another recipe on this site;  Blueberry Sour Cream Pound Cake.  After reading through the ingredients, it's basically this cake with a cup of sour cream added in and different extracts.  So, I added a cup of sour cream, a teaspoon of almond extract, and extra blueberries since I had 2 cups and didn't want to waste any.  Wow, it's noticeably better this way - a combo of the 2 recipes.  YUM.

I thought this turned out really well.  I made it for my mom's birthday and everyone loved it.  Even my dad who hates blueberries!  Next time I think I will grease the pan with a non-stick spray also because mine stuck in the bottom of the pan a little bit.  Other than that very tasty!  Good with cool whip too!

Love this pound cake! New favorite. I did add a TBS lemon juice and about 1 1/2 tsp lemon zest. I think the lemons bring out the blueberry flavor. Soooo good! I also use frozen blueberries. YUMMY!!!

This recipe was just a bit too sweet for my taste, but will definatly try it again. I won't be coating my pan in sugar and I will adjust sugar to 1 1/2 cups. I'd also add a little more blueberries. It took 70 mins to bake in my bundt pan.

Very sweet. Don't know if I would add that much sugar to the pan. I did eat it when it was warm. Very pretty cake, maybe could add a few more blueberries than the 2 cups. I would make this again. I baked this for 75 mins. and it was completely done. Maybe it could use a little citrus flavor, like lemon zest.

This recipe is FABULOUS! I made it for my staff at work and I used blueberries I had picked myself at a blueberry farm. I also mixed a little powdered sugar with a dash of vanilla and a tablespoon of milk and drizzled on top of the cooled cake. It was heavenly and not a crumb was left.

very good and easy, too.  I used about 2 1/2 cups of blueberries and might use more next time.  Simple and delicious.

The second time I made this I increased the vanilla to 2 tsp.

I made a couple of additions to the cake batter of lemon and orange extracts and lemon and orange zest.  Then while the cake was cooling, I made a lemon/orange glaze using butter, powdered sugar, Greek yogurt, lemon and orange juices and zest. Drizzled over the cake while it was cooling and WOW! Came out great. Rich and dense with a great zing in every bite.  I froze half of the cake to make sure the whole thing didn't get eaten in a day and thawed it later the same week.  The frozen half was every bit as moist and rich as the first half. What a great recipe.

Update: i did make this as written and it doesn't get any better than this! So moist and delicious! //// This was wonderful!! I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using strawberries (needed to use them up) and using a bundt pan. I left the berries, cut in smaller pieces on a papertowel to absorb moisture and then followed recipe to toss in flour. Will be making this again with blueberries or other fruits for my husband who loves sweet cakes and breads. He even remarked how much he liked the sugary "crust". I did wrap this in saran as it cooled to keep in the moisture. Thank you!

Excellent recipe!   This turned out very moist and everyone at a work retirement party loved it.   I used frozen berries and it turned out fine.  I used a 12 oz bag which was a bit more than 2 cups but I liked the extra fruit.  I had no problems with using sugar in the pan and liked the little extra crunch it gave.  I will absolutely make this again.  I like to have a good recipe that I don't need a glaze or frosting for but next time I might try a lemon glaze for something different.

Everybody raved about this cake at last night's dinner for 20.
I had only one cup of blueberries, so I added 1 1/2c. raspberries to the mix. You sure have to be very gentle stirring them in but the marbling of colour was very pleasant.  
I, too, poured a lemon juice/icing sugar glaze over the still-hot-from-the-oven cake.  It really does compliment the cake.
I had no problem getting the cake out of the pan - I also followed the butter/sugar directions.  I did let it sit for about 5 minutes first, though.

This cake was delicious!  I took another viewers suggestion and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was plenty sweet (I try to do this in most of my recipes).  Since some people had issues getting the cake out of the pan in one piece after I sugared the pan I sprinkled a little of the fine gravy flour around pan and the cake came out easy and still had the sugary crust which is absolutely yummy!  Another trick I learned years ago was even if you have fresh blueberries freeze them before you put them in the batter.  This stops them from breaking down when you mix them in.  This cake is definitely a keeper!

Oh YUM.  My advice to anyone who makes this cake is to take the 1st piece and make it a big one because this cake will be gone before you know it!!! YUM-MEE!

Yum! This was perfect. I used 3/4 c. oil instead of 1 c. butter, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. A delicious, moist cake. Thanks for sharing.

This came out really nicely and everyone absolutely loved it. Next time I won't coat pan in sugar, though. I found that made it all a bit too sweet. Will definitely make this again.

I like this recipe because it only uses those basic ingredients that one always has around the house. It got rave reviews from friends and family. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a bit of milk to the batter and also made a quick glaze of 10X sugar and light cream. I will be making this one over and over!

This is a very tasty pound cake but a little to sweet.  Next time I bake this cake
I will not sprinkle the pan with 1/4 cup sugar.  Batter is very thick so the blue-
berries do not sink to the bottom, I like that.

Wonderful!  I especially like the part where you sprikle sugar over the butter in the pan.  It makes for a nice sweet top.  I did have a little trouble getting it out of my pan.. A little more butter maybe.  I wouldn't use a non-stick spray.  It had a wonderful taste and the berries made it such a nice summer dessert.  It would even be delicious without the berries!

THE BEST pound cake recipe I have ever eaten or tried!!!! I used fresh picked blueberries and also added a half a cup of low fat yoghurt to make sure it was moist. This cake is soo rich, buttery, and had the perfect amount of blueberries! It was very tender, came out of my pan well, and stayed extremely moist even after leaving it overnight unwrapped cause I forgot! I just baked another one but with raspberries in it for a friend. I got to try a nibble and the raspberry one is also delicious!!!!! It's more tart and tangy but very good. This will forever be my go to recipe. If you're looking for a great pound cake try this one! Also, a helpful note: I didn't have a bundt or tube pan so I reduced the serving size to 10 and baked it in a loaf pan for about an hour. It came out beyond perfect.

Oh man!  I don't think I've ever had a cake come out of a pan so easily before!  I used a Nordic Ware non-stick bundt pan, but I still believe the butter and sugar prep made the difference.  Used a little less than the 1/4 c of sugar, just a light dusting to cling to the butter.  I thought the 2 T of butter was a lot, but I don't dare change that now that I see how it came out.  Holy mother of pearl, this cake is heavenly! I baked it for 80 minutes and it was a lovely golden brown.  Maybe I didn't have as noticeable a sugar crust on the outside, but it was just fine to me.  I put no glaze or powdered sugar on it --  good grief, 2 cups of sugar, 2 sticks of butter, 4 eggs -- it was evil enough as it was! :)  I may even attempt to make muffins from this recipe, using the butter & sugar in the muffin cups. I bought some blueberries on sale ( $1.88 a pint!) and was looking for a recipe to use them in.  I may have to go back and grab another pint!  Once this cake comes out of the oven and cools off, it becomes an ENDANGERED SPECIES. As for those who made it but didn't get to eat much of it, try to make it when no one's home (or up yet) and CLAIM your piece.  The baker of this creation deserves the first piece.  Definitely a keeper, or couldn't you already tell?  I can see why those who brought this to work or other gatherings got requests for the recipe.  Saved in my favorites bar for future use!  Thanks, dcbeck!

Absolutely fantastic. However, I did make some changes. I didn't grease the pan with butter or sprinkle it with sugar. I used 3/4 cup butter and 1 1/2 cup cane sugar. I added 1/4 cup apple sauce and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. 

But MAN, this is delicious. It came out a gorgeous golden brown and just like other reviewers said, I was shocked that it came out so moist and fluffy despite the thickness of the mixture. 5 stars, definitely.

Took this to a potluck dinner- everyone loved it. A nice and different way to use blueberries. Be careful to not over bake pound cakes, I took mine out around 73mins or so, but started checking before then. Thanks for  sharing!

Ok!  This is the best.  I followed directions exactly! Decided to change blueberries the next time to Dried cranberries I soaked in rum and added orange extract instead of vanilla! Apples and cinnamon the next.  Raspberries the next! Mini Chocolate chips next! Mocha -cocoa, instant coffee and chocolate chips will be coming out of the oven in a few minutes!!  Amazing!

flawless cake - I tired it with gluten free flour for my celiac students, and it came out as well as the traditional recipe.  I made and presented both cakes side by side for a taste test and most of the kids preferred the texture of the gluten free recipe.  Flavor is the same.  You need to cool the cake in the pan longer if yo use gluten free flour.

I rarely write a review but I could not help myself on this one. This cake is absolutely one of the best I have ever made. Like others I thought with the batter being so thick the cake would come out bad, but to my delight it did not. I have made this cake at least half a dozen times, and it has never failed to be a crowd pleaser.

Excellent and easy. I have tried it with blueberries and raspberries both were excellent. The sugar crust that forms during the baking process is a nice surprise.  Mine cooks in exactly 70 minutes never fails and never disappoints.

This is a great dense and moist pound cake that I can imagine would work well with other berries (I used frozen blueberries this time.)  I added a few teaspoons of lemon juice to compliment the blueberries, and I think I will add more next time. The sugar lined pan didn't add much if anything -- next time I may leave it out. All in all, a great pound cake and I will be using again!

Wow! Moist, thick, scrumptious pound cake! The fresh blueberries are definitely a good addition, and the thick batter makes the cake super moist (all that butter and sugar - mm). I didn't have to make a single modification to this recipe!

This blueberry pound cake was very good, and everyone who tried it loved it.  I poured a lemon glaze over it.  A new family favorite, and I will make it for all get-togethers in the summer.

Wow was this good!  I used frozen blueberries with a great result.  You will notice that the batter is VERY thick but don't be concerned.  This is a very rich, moist, and flavorful cake.  I topped with a simple powdered sugar glaze after it cooled.

I thought this cake turned out to be terribly bland.  It was moist and the texture was very nice, but I really thought it lacked flavor.  Maybe adding some cinnamon or even a bit of orange zest would help - but it definitely needs a little something extra.  I don't think I'd make it again.

I wish I could give this recipe a 100 stars!!!! I have made this cake 3 times this week because it disappears so quickly. I used fresh blueberries that I had picked, not sure if the frozen would work. I followed the recipe as stated.

this is excellent, did not change a thing, will not change a thing.  to the writer who felt she needed to change this cake because it was "too thick" and "dense" a batter, it's a pound cake...it's supposed to be that a way.  really enjoyed this cake!  ate 3 pieces right away and trouble stopping!  thanks for a new favorite!

I think this might be the best blueberry pound cake I've made. Batter is thick so you can't actually pour it in the pan. Don't think you've done anything wrong, this is ok.  I used some fresh and some freshly frozen berries. Worked fine. Took another reviewers suggestion and put plain batter in the bottom of the pan first to prevent berry explosion at the top when you turn over the bundt but I don't think it was necessary. The berries behaved well in this thicker mixture. Thanks for sharing. I'll make it again for sure

This recipe is very delicious and very easy to make.  I will add 1/2 cup of milk the next time I make it.  This could be a great picnic or potluck go to recipe.

I was looking for a blueberry pound cake recipe and this came out exactly as I had hoped.  Thank you!  Glad I read comments from others about the thickness of the batter, but the cake was a perfect pound cake. Next time I will try it with even more blueberries and maybe not sprinkle sugar insider the greased pan.  It was delicious!

I made this cake for a 4th of July barbecue and it was great! It was really moist the first day and it seemed like it was even more moist 1-2 days later. I made this cake in a bundt pan and cooked it for 50 minutes. (I have noticed that the cake cooking times seem to be a little different here in Las Vegas)  I did reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and I added the juice from one lemon into the wet ingredients before I mixed in the dry.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe as written.

I had a problem getting the cake out of the pan.  I used a bundt pan and greased it with Pam.  When it came time to remove it from the pan I used a knife to loosen up the sides and the middle and when I turned it upside down it completely fell apart.  Took it into work for a birthday celebration.  My coworkers loved the way it tasted.  Just didn't look very good.  Any suggestions on why it might not have come out of the pan?

The cake is a bit on the heavy side, but very tasty. I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh, but it worked very well. Don't get nervous by how think the batter is, it bakes up very nicely.

This is very, very good!  Not necessarily light, but what pound cake is?  I used whole wheat flour and it is just as yummy that way too.  I also used cooking spray instead of butter to grease the pan.

Very delightful!  I didn't have bluberries so I used chocolate chips (not that I need an excuse to use chocolate!)  And I used oil instead of butter and sprayed the pan and then did the sugar.  The batter was very thick so the choc chips didn't sink to the bottom of the bundt pan, and the crunchy crust that formed was very different and yummy.  I've already had requests for the recipe!

Yummy dessert! Although I rated it as 4/5, this could be a 5 star recipe. I had to adapt and use a loaf pan since I didn't have access to a tube pan. As a result, I only needed to cook it for 60 minutes. I may have even left it in a few minutes too long - it was a bit on the dry side. Having said that, I really want to try this recipe again with the proper pan.

I hate to admit it, but anything that has a cup of butter is my kind of recipe.  This was an excellent pound cake with perfect texture and the ideal amount of sweetness.  The only change I made was to use 3 cups of fresh blueberries.

I can't honestly rate this recipe as is because I changed it...but wanted to share what I changed.  I made this recipe the same except I used almond extract instead of vanilla.  I did not use the sugar coating on the pan, instead I made an almond sugar glaze....1 1/2 c powdered sugar, 3/4 tsp almond extract and 6 tsp. water.  I poured that over the top once the cake was cooled and waited 15 minutes for it to set.  It was fantastic!  I have no doubt this recipe would have been great as is though but didn't want to upset anyone by rating the recipe as is when i didn't use it that way.

Well I was really excited to make this because of all the good reviews I saw. I followed the directions but added a little more blueberries (just used all I had). The sugar coating turned out good and didn't stick at all. I might of over baked a tad cause its a little on the dryer side but its ok. My only problem is that its very sweet, I didn't notice any reviews mention this but 2 cups of sugar is too much for me. I will make again but will reduce the sugar by half.

This cake turned out perfectly. The sugared crust is delicious and adds a new texture to the cake. The batter was very thick, but the cake is very light and buttery. Followed the recipe exactly (including fresh blueberries) and added 1 tsp cinnamon.

Great recipe but it was written poorly! Suggestion for those watching their weight and/or looking for alternatives 1. Cut half the sugar or use all natural sugar (raw) or use splenda 2. Egg whites add 2 extra eggs (whites) to recipe 3. Unbleached wheat flour or cut half white flour and half whole wheat 4. Any fruit will do!! So will more vanilla, banana (flavoring too) as well as brown sugar halved with white for sweetness 5. No butter or shortening for pan, use canola/olive oil non stick spray

Delicious! I used a few more berries than the recipe called for because they needed to be used up - and they were not the sweetest berries (thats why I made the cake and didn't just eat them as is!) but the cake was still Yummy. Anyway, delicious batter - could have eaten that with a spoon! May try with peaches or even chocolate chips for something new! Mine did stick to my supposedly nonstick bundt pan using the butter and sugar and cooling just 10 minutes. Might try it with spray next time or maybe let it cool more?  Or maybe just use my straight tube pan as it seemed to get stuck in the flutes of the bundt...

This is a good cake.  I liked how easy it is, and that it is made with ingredients I always have on hand.  Cake is not too sweet and dense as a pound cake is.  My whole family liked this one.  My 10 year is now requesting this as her birthday cake. Also, I don't have a tube pan so I followed others reviews and used a 9X13 pan for 60 minutes.

Made some changes.  1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce.  1 1/2 cup of sugar and half white and white whole wheat flour.   Pound cake was moist but didn't taste like pound cake.  2 year old daughter liked it and husband only liked the crust.  Will not make changes next time I guess...tasted too healthy for me.

This is a keeper!  I have made it a few times in the last few weeks and every time it gets rave reviews (from my family and co-workers) and is eaten very quickly!  It works well with whatever berries you have on hand.  I have used blueberry, raspberry, crow berry (added a bit of lemon juice and a little extra sugar for these as they're a bit tart), and blackberries and it was great every time!

This was a delicious, easy cake to make. It turned out fairly moist but would have been moister had I not dredged the blueberries in extra flour. Next time I'll skip that step & just add the blueberries as is. I used fresh blueberries and almond extract cause I didn't have vanilla. And I also used buttermilk instead of plain old milk. It turned out great and I think I actually prefer the almond extract flavoring. I added a simple powdered sugar glaze of the warm cake and everyone thought it was delicious. Makes a nice cake presentation for a brunch. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

Very tasty and fluffy, especially with a lemon sugar glaze.  Substituted 1/2 cup apple sauce for 1/2 of the butter and baked in 2 loaf pans for about 1 hr.

Excellent cake--flavor and texture perfect, nicely moist. I've made a lot of pound cakes, but this is about the best of all. Since I found this recipe, I've made almost a dozen cakes for family, friends and for my husband to take to work to share with the guys. I've also found you can use other fruits with this cake. I've used peaches, pineapple and pears so far. You can also put different flavored glazes on it, or a fruit sauce, this helps it stay moist longer. This cake has become one of my family's most favorite desserts.

Wow!  This is one absolutely wonderful cake.  Basically a blueberry pound cake with a moist inside and a delightful crunchy crust.  I, too, was concerned about the thickness of the batter, but no fears!  Hope your family and friends enjoy it as much as we do!

This is one of the best pound cakes I've ever eaten.  My husband loves it!!  It comes out perfect every time and I'm not much of a baker. I've used less blueberries before and it was still good.  I do put a lemon glaze on top after I take it out of the oven and it gives it a little extra UMPH!!

Awesome!  Use a bundt pan instead of tube to prevent dripping while baking.  We like the instant frosting (butter/sugar) complete after baking.  A keeper!

This cake is outstanding! I added extra blueberries. My family says they can smell the aroma in the hallway near the elevators. My co-workers ate half the cake within 15 minutes after setting it out. I took some my mother's, let just say, that I'm lucky to bring 1/2 slice home. I will definitely make it again and again.

Made this cake to take for one of the desserts at a friend's Christmas dinner. While mixing the flour I thought it was a little stiff but it tasted good.  The next time I make it I'm going to add 1/2 cup of milk.

I was a little nervous about using the sugar as a coating in the pan but it worked marvelously, the cake fell right out of the pan.  The batter is a little sticky and hard to work with but the results were worth it.  I brought a few pieces to work and people were talking about this cake all day.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this with an 8 year old who loved making it. The batter was very very thick though, so we ended up adding a cup of milk to it. It came out beautifully. I would recommend adding a powdered sugar glaze on top. The consistancy of the cake was very much like a very good blueberry muffin.

Forgot, for those commenting about the thickness of the batter, this is pound cake. it is supposed to be rather thick. For the woman who added milk to thin the batter, that changes this from a pound cake to something else. Most recipes can support tweaking to adjust for individual tastes and dietary needs. Some changes however, change what you made. Maybe a blueberry cake recipe would be more to your expectations.

Wow! this cake was delicious. I used frozen blueberries and drizzled it with a lemon glaze. the batter is very thick and I was nervous while putting it into the pan. Turns out, I had nothing to worry about. It was perfect. This recipe is going to be a staple at our house. Thx!

Yes, the batter is thick. Poundcake usually is. If you are worried about the blueberries getting mushy, put them into the freezer for an hour after coating them with flour and before folding them into the batter. Don't skimp on the butter and sugar coating on the pan. The sugar crust of the cake is really nice.

The family and I are a fan of this recipe. Someone here suggested to add milk to the batter since it comes out too thick to do much with it, so I gradually added about a cup of milk as I was gradually adding flour.

This was a very moist and delicious pound cake! I used a little mayonnaise in mine which I aways add to all of my cakes, it helps make it moist. I used Jersey blueberries which I freeze every summer for my go-to recipes that require blueberries. I also made a blueberry sauce to go over top of it! I will make it again.

Super easy to make, and a great use of wild blueberries. I followed the directions exactly, and it was flawless. The batter is more like a dough, so don't be alarmed when spooning it into the pan.

Delicious!  Made this today and had a slice as soon as it cooled.  Batter is thick but I had no problems with baking.  It rose nicely just slightly above the top of the pan.  I used a tube pan and baked the full 80 minutes. Perfect!  Will definitely make this again and again.

I followed this recipe as is with the exception of using a tube pan and I didn't sugar the pans I did use because I didn't want to pry a cake out of any pan. I used brownie pan and then a cobbler dish. I thought it was delicious. The slightly tart fresh blueberries balanced out the sweetness of the cake. I ate about half of one of the cakes while it was warm with butter. It definitely reminded me of pulling fresh muffins out of the oven and eating them warm. This recipe is worth a try. Make it as the recipe states first and then tweak it to your liking. I did read many "too sweet" comments and am glad I didn't cut the sugar. It was fabulous as is and a great reminder that we all share different flavors and such at different levels.

My husband said this was the best blueberry dessert he ever ate. I made it just like the recipe except I didn't have enough sugar so I had to substitute about 1/4 cup Penzeys vanilla sugar.

Fantastic exactly as written! Very moist, not dry at all.  I wondered about adding the sugar to the pan prior to adding the batter, but it was fine. No burning. Only change was I baked it in a 9x12 pan (didn't have a tube pan).

This was good... I loved the blueberries which I added in frozen. It was pretty dense cake and if it were more moist I would have gave it 5 stars.

I was asked to give a review when I made this . Have tried several times, so here I go again . This will be a update, you see, this is a really good pound cake! Have made it many times, in fact I made it again today to take to a potluck tomorrow. My family loves it, have given recipe to friends. My absolute favorite pound cake. I have read some of the reviews, I don't understand why people change the recipe , if you follow it exactly , it's the best cake! Don't second guess the recipe, it has turned out great every time I've made it, no problems with the recipe .the sugar won't burn in the pan, the batter is thick, sugar amount is fine, not too sweet. If you start changing the recipe, you will have problems!  I have made this so often, never changed anything, no glaze on it either. Where I live we have fresh berries for the summer, & other times you can get blueberries at the store year around. I make this at least 2-4 times a month, we have it in the morning, for dessert, or jus a snack. Hey, don't change the recipe, it's good the way it's written. And thank you for sharing this great recipe !

FANTASTIC!  I followed the directions exactly, except that I used margarine instead of butter.  I used frozen blueberries.  I baked it for 70 minutes, but because I used frozen blueberries and I have a propane oven with very soft heat, it was a little soft towards the middle.  Even though the soft part was particularly yummy, if I was baking it to present to company, I would leave it in for 80 minutes.  My husband thought it was amazing...especially warm!  My oldest son say "This is amazing! Why haven't you made this before?"  I think this one will be repeated often.

Followed the recipe exactly as it was DELICIOUS! my husband who isn't the biggest blueberry fan had three slices. Love the crunchiness the sugar in the pan adds. I thought it would stick but it came out perfectly. Definitely making this again!

made this today and it is simply delicious, my husband ate 2 slices.  I did add 1 cup of no fat sour cream and about 2 teaspoons of lemon zest, and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract.  I did not sprinkle sugar in the pan before baking and the cake came out of the pan perfectly.
will make this again for sure.

Fantastic!!! I made it exactly like the recipe except I added juice and zest of one lemon to the batter and made a lemon, milk and powdered sugar glaze to drizzle on the top. I didn't drizzle a whole lot because I didn't want it to overpower the taste of the cake. It was perfect. It was just enough to have a taste of lemon with the blueberries. Will definitely be making again!!

Delicious! I did everything except dredge the blueberries  and that was because I ran out of flour. I was amazed at how thick the batter was but wasn't concerned.... it is soooooo yummy!

I made this and it always comes out perfect and delicious!  Everyone loved it and had another slice.  The butter and sugar coating in the pan makes it!  Some people complained that the batter was too thick and added milk or sour cream, etc.  don’t do that......it’s supposed to be thick and it comes out perfect every time.  Please don’t change the recipes on here.  Submit your own recipes!

I just made this cake. Followed the recipe exactly. Made in the bundt pan. Had no issues with the cake coming out. The next time I make this I will however change the amount of sugar from 2 cups to 1 1/2 cups of sugar as it is way too sweet for me. Otherwise awesome cake.

This cake was wonderful, so moist.  Everyone loved it.  I didn't have 4 eggs, only 3 so  I added 3 heaping spoonfuls of sour cream.  Also added lemon zest and 1 tbspn of lemon juice.  This is a keeper!

This is one of the best pound cake recipes I've used. I added some lemon zest when I added the eggs, and baked these in 2 round cake pans. I added the sugar to the bottom of one pan, and just butter to the other. The cake with the sugar on the bottom stuck a bit. I would avoid that next time. otherwise, I'll be making this frequently! Thank you

So yummy! We've made this for a couple occasions. Once topped it with chocolate ganache, the other time used whipped cream icing. Both times it was very good, although my favorite was the ganache. :-)

I love this recipe. I've made it over and over. Great flavor, great texture. I use two 9x5 loaf pans instead of a tube pan and it works beautifully. Sometimes I add a simple sugar glaze on top.

Absolutely delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe. I might try making this as muffins next time because the sugary crust was the best part!

Tastes amazing!!!  Was a huge hit with my bible study group.  Only complaint I had was it stuck to the pan (even though I buttered it well) and I had to cover up the crumbles with powered sugar.  But I have 3 loaf pans in the oven now and I hope that turns out better.  Pretty or not, it tastes great!!!

I LOVE this cake!!!  I had purchased fresh blueberries and wanted to do something great with them.  The batter was pretty thick and I was a little worried about that, but it turned out perfectly!  I followed the recipe to the letter and the cake that turned out of the pan was beautiful and tastes wonderful!

Fantastically delicious on my first attempt! Made two loaves instead of the ring and was glad I did. Easier to share with friends! Mostly gone in a day!

I've made this cake a number of times and it never disappoints. It is rich and buttery with a yummy kick of fruit. The sugar sprinkled on initially lends a lovely crunchyness. I use mixed berries because I always have them on hand in the freezer and I reduce the 2 cups of white sugar to 1 3/4. As other reviewers have noted, the batter's really thick and will stick to your spreader, so after I've got it in the pan I wet my fingers and spread it around evenly. I find that it needs at least 75 minutes to cook through because it's quite dense. Finally, it freezes very well if you have any leftovers after a few days (which is unlikely!).

This cake is awesome.  Will use non stick spray next time and only use the sugar in the very bottom center of the pan since it is what made my cake stick so badly but is definitely worth dealing with.

I have made this recipe countless times and it gets rave reviews. I always make it in a Bundt cake pan, though. And I use wild blueberries that I've picked from northern Michigan. Once or twice I've put a confectioners glaze over the Bundt cake. With or without the glaze, this recipe gets 5 stars!!

This is the best blueberry pound cake my family has ever tasted.  I brought it to work and the people loved it.  I make it as often as I can in the summer while the blueberries are in season.  Don't change a thing.  No need to.

I had trouble with sprinkling the sugar in the pan - or perhaps the trouble was someone accidently adjusting the oven temp while cooking supper!! LOL. Anyway, the outside burnt, but the cake itself is SOOO delicious, we just cut the burn-y bits off!  It's moist and flavourfull, and filling - I used the full amount of butter! ;). So not an everyday treat, but a wonderful was to enjoy our fresh-picked blueberries!  Thanks for sharing :)

A nice, dense cake, but that's what I expect from a pound cake!  Good flavour, moist...next time I would skip sprinkling the sugar on the pan before baking, I found it difficult to remove the cake from the pan.

Yum! This was easy and delicious.  I put the cake in a bundt pan, sprayed with a cooking spray and sprinkled the sugar in it.  I was worried it wouldn't come out, but it did!  Used fresh blueberries, and it was a hit.  Loved the sugary crunchy crust on the outside and the moistness on the inside.  Will definitely make again.

I baked this cake exactly as the directions described, and it turned out perfect!  I was hesitant to butter and sugar the pan, but I went ahead and did it and I'm so glad that I did.  The outside of this cake is a little crunchy from the sugar, and the entire cake is one of the best I've ever made.  I combined powdered sugar and freshly squeezed lemon juice for a drizzle over the top.  Definitely adding this one to my favorites!

I would have given the recipe 5 stars, but the cooling time was not accurate. I cooled mine for twice as long and it was still steaming hot so it fell apart when I turned it out, ending what would have been a beautiful blueberry cake.

Great recipe! The batter was very thick, but cake turned out fabulously! I used 4 cups of freshly picked (then frozen) blueberries. I also poured batter into a 9x13 cake pan as that's all I had. Still tastes great though! Will definitely make this again.

I made this to take to work and everyone loved it.  It was quite delicious.  I especially liked the sugar coating (at the bottom of the pan).  I used fresh blueberries and did not make any changes.

This is an awesome recipe.  I added a 1/2 tablespoon lemon zest and 2 tablespoons lemon juice.  I also made this is in muffin pans. I wanted individual cakes for a party.  Filled 2/3 full and baked 35 minutes.  Turned upside down these were beautiful, delicious little cakes.  Makes 2 doz.

Made this recipe for a summer picnic 3 weeks ago.    I did alter the recipe to 2 tsp. vanilla and 3 cups of blueberries.  Delicious flavor. Very moist.  2 people asked for the recipe.  Will definately be making this again.

I am making this cake for our memorial day cookout instead of my famous but overdone red, white and blue angel food cake. The batter is SUPER thick, so I added an extra egg. It's in the oven, I'll let you know how it goes over at the party!

A little high on the butter, but delicious. Using a 9 X 13 cake pan, you only need half the butter and sugar on the pan. It also only cooks for 1 hour.

This recipe is even better than the one I've been using for several years. Since I had a little more than 2 cups of berries I used them all, and the recipe took them all in.  THIS is now my favorite blueberry pound cake recipe!

This recipe was loved by everyone who tasted it!  Will make again and again.  I did use Pam also instead of butter and sugar.  The crust was awesome with a slight thin crisp crust, tender and moist on the inside bursting with fresh blueberries.

This is yummy.  I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of frozen blueberries instead of fresh.  I was concerned about the sugar too, but it turned out fine.  My landlord loved it!  I also used a springform bundt pan, which helped a lot with the disembarkment (ie, taking it out of the pan).  The batter was a bit stiffer than I'm used to and freaked me out a bit, but it turned out fabulously.... ymmmmmmm. (written with blue fingers from the berries!)

This was the simplest, most delicious cake I have ever made.  I could have eaten the entire thing myself!  I used frozen blueberries, but can't wait to try it with fresh when they are in season.  This will become my new go-to recipe for potlucks & family dinners.  THANKS!

I have made this wonderful cake twice, now. It has been a hit both times. It compares to my Grammie's Pound Cake. I have never done the butter and sugar step to grease the pan. I was very impressed with the very thin sugary coat all over the cake.

This cake turned out great!  The only adjustment that I made was to add two BIG tablespoons of lemon curd that I had leftover.  Gave it a nice lemony back-flavor.  It came out of the pan just fine - I used a bundt pan.  Perfect for a 4th of July picnic!  Plans are to serve it with some sliced and sugared strawberries on the side and home made vanilla ice cream.  

Will definately make it again and again

I really liked this recipe! This was my first pound cake, so I wasn't sure if it was something I did wrong, but this was a little more dry than I wanted. 
Was the batter supposed to be pretty thick? I couldn't really "pour" it into the pan, just had to spoon it and spread it.
I also added a dash of cinnamon, and made a glaze out of fresh lemon juice, confectioners sugar, and a bit of cooking oil and poured over the cooled cake. Our family likes lemon a lot!

I will definitely use this recipe again.
I had no trouble getting the cake out of the pan using the 2 T butter and sugar.

I could have sworn I followed the recipe exactly...my cake "flopped"!! I'm laughing instead of being upset. Don't know what happened and have never had that happen to any of my cakes...however, I must say that I'm rating this a 4 because my kids and hubby were ranting and raving over the taste despite the funny look.  They devoured it and even placed some in a bowl with vanilla ice cream.  I will definitely try this again and hopefully it won't flop.  (I always heard about cakes that fall but never thought it was really true.)  Update:  retried the recipe a while back with success...wonderful!

This is a good cake...good, but not a 5 star for me and I love pound cakes. Those other reviews aren't kidding, this is THICK batter.  You practically need a ice cream scoop to get it in the pan.  I did have to bake about 25 minutes longer that the recipe stated.  I used frozen berrier with no problems.

Terrific!  I made this recipe for a Father's Day brunch and it was eaten entirely (and quickly!).  My guests loved it (especially my mom who is a true pound cake lover).  I used frozen unsweetened blueberries (fresh ones are not quite in season).  I measured 2 heaping cups frozen berries and let them thaw and drain in a colander overnight in the fridge.  I dredged them with flour before adding to the cake batter, as it says to do in the recipe instructions.  The batter was thick, but it was not difficult to work with - - I don't think it needs added milk.  Also, I buttered and sugared the pan, as directed, and the cake came out very easily.  I'll definitely make this again.  It's easier than the blueberry muffin recipe that I use and just as good.

Very good and my family loved it.  I made this for the first time over the weekend because I had a craving for blueberry cake.  Followed the recipe exactly except I did have to use frozen blueberries.  My husband can't stop eating it and my 5-year old chose this over a candy bar for dessert last night!  My only complaint is that I haven't gotten much of it.  Oh well.

This was more like shortbread than pound cake.  Flavor was good but very moist, almost too moist.  I probably won't make it again.

Very simple to make. We loved the flavor although the texture was not as fine as other pound cakes I have made in the past. I will keep the recipe and make it again.

I made it exactly like it called for. And like others mine was really thick almost like a biscuit or leaning towards cookie dough I would waste the ingredients again unless someone can tell me where I went wrong Now I live in Colorado and always have to consider high altitude but couldn’t think what to add the recipe called for plenty of flour

I am not good baker, but this cake comes out great every time I make it! Everyone loves it, and it is very simple to make. If you are not a baker like me, this is a tip I can offer: Soften the 2 Tablespoons of butter in a tiny bowl and use a brush to spread the butter in the pan. I've used fresh blueberries and frozen ones. Both are great!

I had a freezer full of blueberries my brother and his girlfriend picked this past summer (46.7 lbs).  I needed to use some and based on the star rating and reviews, choose this recipe and glad I did!  Everyone that has tasted it, said it was fantastic.  I did tweak according to reviewers and added half a cup of milk before folding in the blueberries, resulting in a moist, buttery and blueberry cake that I will be making again and again!  I might even try some other tweaks with the lemon glaze or adding lemon zest and a little juice to the batter.

Brought it to work and came back with an empty container. I used nonstick spray but will try the butter-sugar suggestion next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Second time round I used cranberries I’d picked and frozen last Fall. So good even my 5yr old nephew had a big piece. Not one slice left.

This is a delicious pound cake which has been thoroughly enjoyed by everyone who I serve it to! (I've made it 2 or 3 times now since it is blueberry season) The sugar crunch on the crust adds a nice texture. This is a very sweet cake and next time I  probably will cut back on the sugar in the recipe by about a half a cup.

Loved it!  Made it with fresh blueberries picked the day before.  I was nervous about adding the sugar to the bottom of the pan, fearing it would burn, but it didn't.  The batter was very thick, but I think that helped hold the blueberries in place so they didn't sink to the bottom.  The cake was moist, not dry at all.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This cake was a huge success!  I made the batter but added about 3-4 heaping teaspoons of sour cream!  I also made a lemon juice and sugar glaze on top while it was still warm, about 1/4 cup.  The result was a slightly sticky lemony delight.  I could eat that every Sunday!  Everyone loved it!

This recipe turned out perfectly.  I would not change anything!  The batter does appear to be thick when you put it in the pan, but it cooks up like it should and is very moist.  Take the extra step of buttering and sprinkling the pan with sugar.  It adds a delightful crunchy feel to the outside.

This one's a keeper!

Do yourself a favor and make this cake!  It's absolutely delicious.  I did add the zest of one lemon, which I think elevated the cake to new heights.  Make sure to liberally butter the pan, and do sprinkle it with sugar because it makes a nice crust on the cake.
7/4/19--Won a first place and Reserve Champion at the Salem VA Fair.  This one was without the lemon.

I made this all summer with fresh blueberries and it turned out beautifully every time.   Today I made it and added the zest and juice of one orange and one 12 oz bag of cranberries.   It turned out wonderfully!!!  My favorite recipe!!

Makes a great hospitality bread for church. The bundt shape means slicing a few at a time -- leftover cake stays fresh.

Made this exactly according to the recipe. Have made it four times in the last month. It is truly delicious and beautiful. Always gets rave reviews and requests for me to make it again. Most times I put a lemon glaze on it. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious cake, only problem was it stuck to the pan.   I did exactly what was said in the recipe...2 tablespoons of butter and then sprinkled sugar.   I even spread some batter in the bottom of my bundt pan first and then added the blueberries to the rest of the batter and then added that.   I will try a different pan the next time I make this delicious pound cake.

This was easy and delicious...made according to the recipe except used 2 full pints of fresh blueberries. Other reader had said they would add more than the 2 cups and since my family really loves blueberries I added all of them.  Turned out great.

Excellent recipe and I 2 tablespoons of added lemon juice + 1 tablespoon lemon zest to turn it to lemon blueberry cake

I added 1 tsp of baking powder because I felt that 1 tsp is not enough 

For topping:
Philadelphia cheese+ milk in the blinder
Butter+ powder sugar+ lemon zest +lemon juice
Add them to the cheese mix in the blinder and drizzle

Delicious! I made it as the recipe recommends except using frozen blueberries instead of fresh. I love the extra crisp and crunch that the sugar and butter in the pan make. (I didn’t shake out the extra sugar after coating the pan.) I smashed a bag of thawed frozen strawberries then added fresh sliced strawberries and served with fresh whipped cream. It was beautiful and delicious. Great for 4th of July.

Wonderful! After years of making different cakes for my husband, this is only the second one he’s gone back for seconds and thirds! He’s obsessed! It’s much lighter than a cream cheese or sour cream pound cake.  I made it for 4th of July and used our farm fresh blueberries that we picked and froze earlier this season. I also added a simple lime juice+lime zest+ powdered sugar glaze on top. PERFECT! Thank you!

I made  this cake no changes and have made it 3 times now. It was delicious, not overly sweet which suits us. It would be great with whipped cream and/or ice cream if you are so inclined.

I didn’t make the sugar crust. Just added a bit of fresh lemon to the batter. And the milk glaze  I made for the top. This is a great recipe! Moist and flavorful. It’s a must try !

Turned out great!  I used one cup fresh blueberries and one cup frozen cherries.  I didn’t have a bundt pan so I used a regular 9x12 cake pan and baked for 50 mins.  Was delicious!

I can't say enough about this recipe. The only change I made was adding a little lemon extract. The  cake is moist, perfectly sweet and I love the slightly crunchy "crust" that formed on it. Delicious with sliced, sweetened, fresh strawberries  spooned over the top!I will definitely make it again!

I had a bunch of extra blueberries in the house and company coming for dinner. Looked for a dessert recipe to make with the ingredients I had on hand. I came across this and read the reviews. It was super easy to make and like many reviews said despite a thick batter and fear of being dry, it turned out moist and delicious. I used a bundt pan and was nervous about the amount of sugar in the pan, but it made a delicious crust on the cake.

This is a great pound cake to make any time of the year. It comes out perfectly every time I make it. At the end of blueberry season I make sure I freeze a bunch to use throughout the winter and early spring. Especially to make this pound cake. YUMMY!!

Followed the recipe as is.  Delicious!  The batter was thick but it was okay to fold in the fresh berries - just be careful not to break too many of them.  Baked for 80 minutes and then another 10.  Cake was still very moist to the point of being a tad dense but I think it's my oven, not the recipe.  I would make again definitely and would add extra vanilla.  The kids all loved it.

I didn't even taste this pound cake yet and I KNOW I will never use it again.  I am a new baker, so I follow directions to the 'T'.  I wanted a recipe that added sour cream.  Somehow, I picked this one and it doesn't.  The batter was SO thick I could barely fold in the blueberries.   I KNEW something was wrong.. but what does a 'novice' like me do..??    I plopped it into the bundt pan and am hoping for the best.

Mine turned out beautiful and I followed the recipe except for 1 small thing - I used frozen blueberries and didn't dredge them in flour before adding.  The batter is thick but that's the way it's supposed to be.  Definitely making this again!

Great recipe.  If your cake came out heavy or dry, then you did something wrong!  Extremely moist cake, I substituted almond extract for the vanilla for a bit of a different taste and it was delicious. Love the sugar coating on the pan, great idea.

Stick to the recipe! The finished batter is deceiving. I was super skeptical that because it was so heavy and hard to spread out throughout the pan that it was going to be very dense and not moist and light at all. However, I stuck with it and once we cut into it, we were amazed! So delicious!

Definitely my new go-to recipes.  Easy and delicious!  The sugar on the pan gives the cake a lovely crust!  I was concerned that it would stick, but the cake popped right out of the pan.

This was an outstanding pound cake recipes. The only change I made was to add a little lemon extract and the fresh zest of one lemon. Served it with strawberries and fresh whipped cream. Best of all, the next morning we sliced the leftovers up and made it into french toast with real maple syrup. Rave reviews from the grandkids and big kids alike!

This turned out light and fluffy with a crunchy crust. I didn't add the 1/4 cup of sugar as I baked as muffins. But the taste and texture is amazing. No need for any substitutions.

This recipe calls for 6 eggs and I could actually taste the eggs in it, which I didn't like. Next time I may try only using 4 eggs and change a few of the other measurements and see what happens.

Very good pound cake.   The only thing I added was lemon zest to the batter and I made a glaze with lemon zest.  Do not overcook this cake.  When you test it and you see a few crumbs, take it out.  The cake will continue to bake and it will be perfectly moist.

This is an awesome recipe!  I made it just as it is written twice and it has turned out great both times.  The sugar "crust" is especially tasty.  It is the perfect recipe for my new Nordicware bundt pan.  My family loves this cake and it never lasts for more than 24 hours around here.

Really good, moist cake. I used a bunt pan, greased and sugar coated, didn't change recipe. The only problem I had was the cake sticking to the pan.

I didn't care for this recipe.  I made this cake exactly according to the recipe.   The dough was more like cookie dough than cake batter because there was no liquid other than butter and eggs.  No milk or water is listed in the ingredients.

This was great!  I added maybe a 1/2 c. of sour cream just cause I always do with coffee cakes.  I've used up to 4 cups blueberries and just makes the cake better and better. Even a little lemon zest in the cake and/or glaze works nicely. Will continue to make!

I made this and it always comes out perfect and delicious!  Everyone loved it and had another slice.  The butter and sugar coating in the pan makes it!  Some people complained that the batter was too thick and added milk or sour cream, etc.  don’t do that......it’s supposed to be thick and it comes out perfect every time.  Please don’t change the recipes on here.  Submit your own recipes!

So far I have made this cake  twice. the sugar coat crust is the best part. First time I followed the recipe except I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of two. In my opinion the result was great. But my mom felt the cake is a little too dry. So the second time I added 1/3 cup milk to the mixture. I used cored and chopped cherry since I ran out of blueberries. I still used 1 1/2 cups sugar. I think I over mixed the flour this time. But my mom enjoyed it. I will definitely make it for a future party.

Even using frozen blueberries, this was wonderful. Good any time of the day. And no frosting needed, since the butter and sugar lined pan made a yummy crust.

Loved this recipe as is! I was also worried about how thick the batter was but am so glad that I didn't change anything. The cake was moist and delicious and even better the second day. I did drizzle a powdered sugar/milk/lemon juice glaze over it. Will definitely make again!

This cake was amazing! I made this yesterday for Father's Day. I followed the recipe exactly and found the batter to be almost too thick. I added about 8oz of sour cream before I folded in the blueberries. I also added about 1/2 cup extra berries.  I was concerned about the 1/4 cup of sugar around the cake pan but it made all the difference. Didn't need a glaze or anything on top. It gave it a sweet crunchy crust. I brought some to work and I have already been asked for the recipe. I will make this again!

We tend to eat healthy and organic in our house, but having a spouse with the sweet tooth of a five year old, I try to make the occasional, special treat.  And I figure if you're going to go bad, do it in a big way.  Having made this recipe (for special occasions) I can honestly say it is the best, most versital pound cake recipe I have found.   I have substituted chocolate chips, raspberries and apple/cinnamon with amazing success.  Highly, highly recommeded.

Aside from using frozen berries, I made this recipe exactly as written & it was a huge hit! The batter is really thick, so I was a bit worried in the beginning but it came together beautifully. The sugar lining in the pan is such a nice touch. Thank you!!

I made this using fresh blue berries from my own bushes. Maybe that made it test better!.  Anyway, it was awesome. I didn't change any of the amounts. The only thing I did different--which was a tip from a friend who is a professional cake baker--was separate the eggs and beat up the whites. Then I folded them in after putting  in the flour and put in the blueberries last as the recipe says. It has to be the lightest most moist pound cake I have ever had.  Of course, I do also use duck eggs which make all baked goods better.

This is very tasty, may just be my over but next time I will cook it for longer than the 70 minutes.  Pound cake is my husband's favorite and we both love blueberries, this is definitely a winner in our home.

I made exactly as instructed using a bundt pan.  I let it cool 10 minutes as directed and then tried to take out of pan to cool further.  It was stuck firmly to the top of pan.  I had to work to get it out, and it didn't make it in one piece.  

It tasted exceptionally good, but I was not pleased with it sticking to the pan.  

I would make again but would try it without sugar coating the pan to see if that helps with the sticking issue.

I thought this cake would be way too heavy and therefore played with the recipe to make it a bit "skinnier." I used only 1 stick of butter and combined it with 1/2 cup plain yogurt. I only used 3 eggs. I also did 1 c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar to add moisture. I squeezed a bunch of lemon into the batter, too, because I think lemon and blueberries go well. I baked it for 60 minutes and after cooling, sifted some powdered sugar on top. Turned out great and with less fat!

While this wasn't bad, it wasn't anything special either. The batter is very thick - like cookie dough or a brownie batter.  It didn't rise much - & a bit on the dry side.  I liked the sugar coating though.  Those that added milk, etc probably had the right idea to "fix" it; but I'd just pass on this one & try another if I were you.

I made this bread in my bread maker and it turned out so good! The flavor was great and the texture was wonderful! I would've posted a pic but it got eaten before I had a chance!

Made recipe as written. No need to change anything as other reviewers have mentioned. I baked the cake for 60 minutes in a tube pan and it came out perfect. Also tastes good with strawberries in lieu of blueberries. Will be using again.

Good recipe. I added extra blueberries and thank goodness I did. The cake seemed a little dry, maybe too much flour. I will cut back on that next time or add sour cream. I topped mine with a lemon glaze and the family loved it.

This was AWESOME. Made it for Thanksgiving, it got rave reviews. I didn't have a problem with the sugar around the edge, but I buttered the pan real good. The cake popped right out. Also took suggestions of layering the bottom of the pan with just batter so the blueberries didn't stick, and added a lemon zest topping. Used more blueberries too. It isn't really a pound cake though, more like a huge, tasty blueberry muffin. So good!

Looks Great. Made for a bake sale, might have to buy myself or make another one. Did however take longer to bake then it called for. I did use frozen blueberries I had picked earlier.

I thought this was absolutely fantastic. The only thing I changed was adding the zest of half of a lemon, which gave it just a little extra bright flavor.  I did have one problem, however. I used a loaf pan and I had a ton of batter left over and had to use the rest to make six cupcakes.

The taste of this recipe is DIVINE! The only thing I will note is that I had a REALLY hard time getting it out of the pan. I noticed that where the blueberries were touching the pan it made the cake very soft and it crumbled apart really easily when I tried to take it out. I think the next time I make it I will try to layer the batter and the bluberries to try and avoid that. Also, I made a simple sugar glaze to put over the top.

It was a very nice cake. I would add about a cup extra blueberries next time, but I love things really fruity. You could really taste the butter in this recipe. I served with whipped cream and that tasted great!

I did not put the sugar in the bottom of the pan as it called for (wished I had) and I used less blueberries.  To me this cake is not dense enough for a pound cake.  I think I will use oil instead of butter the next time I make this cake.  Overall good simple cake recipe.  Will make again.

Fantastic flavor but stuck to the pan.  I followed the exact measurements for butter and sugar for preparing the loaf pan; after 10 minutes of cooling the cake, half of my loaf stuck to the pan when I tipped it out to finish cooling.

It's fun to make & kid-friendly. My 4 1/2 yr. old son helped me make this & it was easy to include him. It turned out wonderfully. The batter was thick & it's a pretty dense cake so def use the bundt pan. Everybody loves this. It's our new favorite cake.

This was very easy to make and turned out delicious.  I used frozen berries as the fresh ones are still too expensive.  It was still very good.  I wish there had been more of the "crust" but part of the lack may be due to using a Bundt pan instead of tube pan.

neither my family nor I liked the taste of this cake.  It was a bit dry and the texture was odd.  Won't make it again.
