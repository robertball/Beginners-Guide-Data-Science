This was good, but it needed something more... I cut the recipe down and still used more herbs and onion than called for. This would've been nice w/ a splash of lemon juice added or a nice drizzle of evoo at the end, or both! All in all, it was good for something different. Thanks for sharing. :)

I absolutely loved my own adapted version of "Savino's Herb and Olive Chicken Salad." I tripled the fresh herbs and onion because we like highly-seasoned food in our home. I also used freshly-ground 4-pepper blend. I used olives from the Italian delicatessen in my neighborhood, which happened to be packed with some sun-dried tomatoes and garlic-stuffed green olives, so I threw in some of those too. My own adapted version of this recipe looked really beautiful with flecks of red (sun-dried tomatoes), black (olives), and green (fresh herbs and garlic-stuffed green olives) against a pale beige background (chicken breast). I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you Mel Savino for sharing your recipe.

I really enjoyed "Savino's Herb and Olive Chicken Salad"; however, I did up the seasonings. Thank you Mel Savino for sharing your recipe!

I made this, minus the rosemary because I was out. Used more mayo, chopped sweet onion. I used seasoning salt, and a tsp of cider vinegar in my dressing as well. Used leftover grilled chicken white meat. Also added sweet red pepper, chopped jarred cherry peppers, and grated cheddar cheese, wanted to make it full of veggies and protein. (I would add tomatoes but I was out of those too). Great recipe. The simple seasoning is all it needs.
