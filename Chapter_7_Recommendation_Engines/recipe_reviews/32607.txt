Interesting. I don't know if I like the combination of orange and irish creme. It's good, maybe just not for me.

Not bad at all but not something I would make again. Irish Cream liqueur is heavy and dominated the flavor of this coffee drink. The orange flavor was lost and didn't compliment the Irish Cream as well as some other liquers.

It's very tasty! I didn't add orange zest though. I store the Irish Cream in the frig,
