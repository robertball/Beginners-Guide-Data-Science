As we make this recipe on a regular basis, we are always looking to tweak it.  Since Allrecipes slightly changed my original recipe, from Ribeye or Strip steak they will not allow me to change it.  
Recently, we have been using Tri-Tip steak for it and we think it is much better.  The Tri-Tip can hold up to the longer cook time and is cheaper than our original recipe.  Hope you all enjoy the recipe and the tweak!

I have made this twice.  I didn't have any wine either time, but I did add Â¼ cup of Worcestershire and it turned out great.  Will definitely be making this again!

I am not a cook but since I retired I thought I would try. How hard can it be to follow directions. I set out to make the classic beef stroganoff. At the culmination of this ordeal I poured the beef and gravy over the noodles and was ready to eat when I noticed the bowl of sauteed onions and mushrooms still sitting on the stove. After reading the instructions over and over, I find no mention of adding the onions and mushrooms to the dish.
At this point I did dump some on my plate and the rest into the beef pan.
It was still delicious
Learning,
Paul

I found the quantity hard to work with. My largest pan was filled to overflowing and I transferred it to my Instantpot which handled it just fine. Next time I will cut the recipe in half. Good flavor and a win overall.

I accidently used 2 pounds of mushrooms and I have to say it was a happy accident. I bought a cheap cut of meat and simmered for 30 minutes or until the meat was tender. It was AMAZING!! My husband asked me to make it again so that is a win in my book!

The recipe was a big hit, the Spanish Paprika from Eastern Mrkt in Cleveland, OH put it over the top.

I didn't have beef broth on hand so used Lipton onion soup with water. Worked fine.

I made this and absolutely love it. I did change it just a little. I used Merlot for the wine which is a dry red wine. I used an entire small can of low sodium beef broth. I used Tator Topping instead of sour cream. The flavor was absolutely wonderful. With baked corn on the cob (with garlic butter) the meal was amazing. My husband couldn't stop complementing me on it.

This was so good. I did not have enough sour cream to mix in but there was enough to put a dollop on top of my serving. The sauce was so good by itself that it really did not need the sour cream. I will be replacing my old stroganoff recipe with this one.

This is a great dish and a nearly perfect recipe. There are a few things I would change: one at no point does the recipe list when you should add the onions and mushrooms with the beef. I added it at the beginning of Step 6 and that worked well. Two a large skillet is nowhere near big enough even for just the onions and mushrooms much less the beef. I needed to use a large pot like a medium stock pot. I think if you halve the recipe you should be able to use a large skillet -- and half of the recipe is still a lot: it would be four or more hearty portions! Third next time I will use fewer onions. One and a half onions was quite a bit and took a long time and a lot of crying to mince. I will try using one small to medium onion the next time I make this. All in all this is a wonderful recipe and turned out marvelously. These are just a few small tweaks.

I have to say that this dish was great but I had to make some short cuts with the recipe do to time restrictions. So I left out something s like the ketchup wine I just put the onions mushrooms and garlic in with the stew beef and seasoned it with salt pepper and paprika and let it simmer on a medium heat for 30 minutes then added the beef broth and mixed in the flour and sour cream and simmered it on a low heat until the noodles were done and then served it up. It was so good me and my wife ate 2 helpings of it.

It was easy and different. For some reason mine had a tangy taste to it. Maybe reduce the sour cream.

my family loved this. I never made this before and it turned out wonderfully. I made it in a pressure cooker and it turned out great.

This was great. I used elk round steak and the meat was wonderful. I did salt and pepper the steak before browning and added a little Worcestershire sauce with the ketchup at the end. I will be making it again!

Very very good. I might have rounded up to 5 stars but the directions needed a bit of tweaking. I tasted the gravy 1 minute after adding the flour and it still tasted like raw flour. I cranked it up to a full boil for a couple of minutes & then reduced it to a simmer & it was fine. And while I understand removing the beef so it doesn't toughen up (in fact I only stir fried it for a couple of minutes before doing so) I don't understand removing the onions & mushrooms so I left them in for the entire cooking process. Before re-adding the beef I tasted the gravy again & it still seemed to be lacking a little something so I added a couple of dashes of Tabasco it. I also tossed in a cup of frozen peas just because I didn't want to cook a vegetable separately. And like I said using the listed ingredients (plus a dash of hot sauce) made for a very flavorful meal. But you might want to modify the cooking directions a bit

Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!! I followed it fairly closely. I used a chuck roast cut up and only 2Tbs. ketchup. No wine more beef broth (made from beef base). I cooked the onion and mushrooms first set them aside and then cooked the beef added the broth garlic ketchup and simmered for a half hour or so. I kept about a half cup broth to mix with the flour. Thickened it added in the onions and mushrooms and heated thru. Took it off the heat and added the sour cream. Yummy! This will be made regularly in our home!

I was looking for a way to use up leftover prime rib from Christ as dinner and this hit the spot on a cold evening. As others have written there is no mention of when to add the mushrooms and onions I added them to the beef mixture just before serving. I served steamed carrots with the dish although both of us agreed that parsnips would have been good also. I would make this again.
