Our family loved it—and I didn’t even have all the ingredients, so dried basil and almond milk were my substitutes for fresh basil and coconut cream. Thanks for sharing—I’ve been wanting a DF/GF Campbell’s tomato soup kind of recipe and this worked great.

Super easy to make. I ended up not blending it because the crushed tomatoes I got were basically tomato sauce already. After following the recipe the soup was a little lack luster, so I added a bit of Sherry, some sugar to cut the acidity and some chili powder for a kick. My husband, who doesn't typically like tomato soup, had 2 servings with his smoked Gouda grilled cheese. Will make again!

Very easy recipe tastes great. I made a few adjustments for ingredients I had on hand. in place of maple syrup I used cane sugar 1 tsp. I also added a little tony chachere's creole seasoning. ( I don't like a lot of basil) I used a 29 oz. can of tomato sauce in place of paste ans crushed tomatoes since that is what I had here. Still came out really good just didn't have to run it through the blender

Good but extremely mild flavor — it seemed to need something else.  We used at least as much basil as garnish as went in the soup, which helped some.  UPDATE:  I made it again and added 1/4 tsp of chipotle chile powder, then sprinkled a bit more in after I added the coconut milk.  Five stars definitely with that change.

This was absolutely delicious!!! I used dried basil since I couldn’t get any, and half the amount of lemon juice and maple syrup but still turned out amazing. Thank you for sharing!! :)
Does this soup freeze well by the way? It would be great to save leftovers for lunch!

I don't eat onions, so I omitted these. It was a little too sweet for my liking, so I think I will omit the maple syrup next time as well. It was easy to cook and turned out to be very creamy.
