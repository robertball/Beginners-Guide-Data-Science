These were awesome. The only change I made was I doubled the zest blended with the sugar.  I did not put the dough in the freezer. I popped it into the fridge for about twenty minutes and found that the dough was firm enough to scoop up and roll in the sugar. These cookies stay soft which is how my family likes their cookies. I canâ€™t wait to make these again and next time I will double the recipe.

great crispy edges & chewy middle - easy to make, but a little light on lemon flavor - will need to perk it up a bit - will omit vanilla & double up on lemon juice- maybe add some  extra zest (I have lemon zest powder) to the dough for extra zing, but overall a nice cookie.  definitely do the extra sugar sprinkle on top!

Save yourself some trouble and just go ahead and double this recipe. These cookies are fantastic. I was craving a lemon cookie and these are divine. 
I did omit the vanilla and add more lemon juice in its place because I really wanted the lemon to pop. My husband rated these cookies with one word. "Mmmmmmm"

Love it! These cookies are wonderful.  Will be making them again (my family really enjoyed it).
