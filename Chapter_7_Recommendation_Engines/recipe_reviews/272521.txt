Amazing flavour! I used it on pork and added a little extra garlic, chilli powder and oregano.

This was a really nice mix and worked great for the beef shawarma I made. The recipe submitter mentions this version in lighter on the cloves and indeed it was. That was a huge bonus for us since a little clove flavor goes a long ways. Thanks for sharing!

This is a very nice blend. It has an earthy and woody flavor, giving chicken a smoked flavor.
