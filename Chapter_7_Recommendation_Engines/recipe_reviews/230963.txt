***note, I messed this one up, but it turned out amazing***
Okay, so I was trying to impress a date, and looked around for some unusual, but easy recipes. This one seemed to fit the bill. I gave it a try, but I over cooked the squash. When I tried to brown it, it turned to mush. I was too committed to give up (I didn't have anything else to cook!) so I just went with it, and it was AMAZING!
After I boiled the squash, onions, and dried cranberries, I tired to economize with the upcoming dish duty, so I put the butter and oil in the same pot that I boiled the squash in. After it got hot, I threw the squash/onions/cranberries back in and it all turned to mush when I started to turn the squash. 

At that point, I just turned it into a mashed potato-style dish, and it was tasting pretty good. My date had a sweet tooth, so I turned the tablespoon of brown sugar into 1/4 cup and added a teaspoon of allspice for kicks. When it was done, it looked like mashed sweet potatoes with a parmesan on top (I forgot the almonds b/c I tasted it and didn't want to stop eating it), and it was a huge hit.

Moral of the story... the flavors going into this dish are pretty versatile, so feel free to experiment with it a bit!

This exceeded my expectations.  It had a depth of flavor and textures that was very delicious.  I made a few changes.  I boiled the squash and 1/3 cup cranberries.  I then cooked the onions in in the butter mixture along with 3 tablespoons of brown sugar.  After adding the squash, I added 1/4 cup of almonds and 1/3 cup of parmesan.  Everyone in the family liked it!

I really liked this!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have a red onion so I just used a regular sweet onion that I had on hand. I think a red onion would have made it prettier. I liked the mix of sweet and salty flavors in this dish.  I think this would make a wonderful side dish for the holidays.

Oh boy, did I make a piggy out of myself !!!  This is outstanding!!  I tweaked a little - cooked the squash and cranberries and then reduced liquid a bit.  Browned onion and added remaining ingredients.  Stirred around to coat well with butter.  Topped with twice the amount of parmesan cheese and broiled to brown top.  Delicious.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

DH and I loved this dish tonight! I used Splenda brown sugar blend since DH is diabetic, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The squash was falling apart rather than browning in the skillet before I turned off the heat, but the flavors of savory and sweet mixed together were delicious. Thanks LCyjnx for sharing.

Interesting combination. Not sure I'll make it again, but good enough for a second helping! We followed the directions exactly, except that I had to use yellow onion instead of red.

I made it for my daughter for Thanksgiving and she liked it a lot.  Her diet prevents her from eating certain things and this was a nice substitute.

This was excellent!!!  Next time I will either cut the squash into larger pieces, or not cook it so long.  Just be careful to check the tenderness of the squash so it doesn't get mushy.  I bought sliced almonds and roasted and salted them.   That really made a big contribution to the awesome flavor of this dish.  Perfect for Thanksgiving.

Very good! I also didn't get it to brown but I don't think it made a difference in the taste.

I made this just as written, and it was delicious!  I also couldn't get the squash to brown, but the flavor was excellent anyway.  I might add a little more brown sugar next time,but this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Made it for Christmas dinner. Amazing addition. I only had frozen mashed butternut squash, so we cooked the cranberries and onions in the chicken stock. Then we added the olive oil, butter, and mashed squash to a cast iron pan. Then we mixed in the onions and cranberry mix. YUM!!!!

I made this recipe and just posted a photo as well. Some modifications - I didn't use the Parmesan but instead added cooked bacon bits and some chopped parsley for color. Didn't have orange flavored cranberries but regular dried cranberries worked just fine. This was a delicious side !

I made this recipe yesterday for Thanksgiving. It turned out great! The squash wouldn't brown so I put it under the broiler for a few minutes, and it still wouldn't brown! So I put some additional brown sugar on top and that worked - but you can only leave it under the broiler for a minute or two. It was a nice alternative to sweet potato casserole!

Followed recipe exactly.  Results were good but not outstanding.  Will probably try again but add maybe some cinnamon.  It was a little bland,
