A really reliable standby. I prefer to use 1 cup brown flour & 2 cups white.

Looking over the recipe I saw no need to make any adjustments other than using butter instead of margarine, although I suppose any number of them could be made if you'd want to tinker around with this.  I was intrigued by the lemon juice and wondered if it might contribute a sort of buttermilk or even sourdough tang, but it doesn't.  I wondered why the submitter chose to use both olive oil AND margarine, and milk AND water rather than one or the other.  And why only a half cup of whole wheat flour when most recipes of this type would call for a cup.  Whatever her reasons for her "little bit of this and a little bit of that,"  her recipe turns out a really nice loaf of bread - just a little wheaty (which appeals to me), soft but with a chewy crust (I used the medium crust setting) and just an all around good, everyday bread for toast, sandwiches or the dinner table.  While I did stick to the ingredients list strictly (except for the butter switch) I did not heat the milk and water as the recipe directed. Rather, I stuck to the manufacturer's directions for my bread maker.  This is the kind of recipe you'd return to over and over again when you just want a good, reliable, basic bread.  Very glad I tried it!

I have made this a couple of times and it turned out great each time. Very little adjustments were needed.

Perfect and beautiful. I used Splenda instead of regular sugar, but otherwise... Don't change a thing! Delicious!

I made this without a breadmaker by proofing the yeast then putting all the wet ingredients in my stand mixer, including the butter and added the whole wheat flour.  I mixed this then added the AP  1 cup at a time, mixing well each time.  I didn't need the last 1/2 cup of AP.  I allowed it to rise twice before shaping into a loaf, a final rise and then baking at 350 for 30 minutes.  While it had a lovely texture and perfect crust it still just tasted like white bread.  I suppose I expected the WW to give it more flavor.  Thanks SUNKATTT

Love this recipe. Have tried dozens and this is by far the most moist, delicious, light and fluffy bread I've been able to make!

This is a nice, basic bread.  I can only surmise that the ww is to add some healthiness for those who would bitterly complain about it being added, as you really can't tell there is whole wheat in this bread.  I followed the recipe other than using the dough cycle then baking in the oven--that's almost always my preferred method.  A little chewy and somewhat holey.  Tastes pretty good, and hubs made no comment--always a plus around here.  Thanks for the recipe!
