This recipe is awesome!!! Very delicious! It was kind of hard to spread the cocoa pebbles so I sprayed a piece of wax paper with Pam and it worked great. I also used mini marshmallows on top instead of the large marshmallows. I will definitely make this again!

Good. I thought the cocoa krispie mixutre would be more chocolatey though, so the chocolate drizzle on top is a must. Like the previous reviewer I also reccomend using miniature marshmallows on top. Gently press on the marshmallows and graham crumbs on top right away to ensure they stick to the top.

I thought these were good. I crushed a whole pack of graham crackers ( 8 crackers) and mixed them in 4 TBL melted butter and pressed it to the bottom of the foiled pan. Then spread the melted chocolate, krispie mix  followed by the drizzled chocolate sprinkled with tiny mini marshmallows. I grated a regular size Hershey chocolate bar and sprinkled on top before the drizzled chocolate set. I think they are better heated in the microwave for about 20 seconds, this gives them a real smores effect as it softens the chocolate and marshmallows.
