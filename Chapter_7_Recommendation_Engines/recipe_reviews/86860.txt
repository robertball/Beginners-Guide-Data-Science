This was really good.  It was a little too hot for me, but hubby loved it.  I didn't add the veggies, and it was great served with the "poor man's rice" from this site.  Great dinner...thanks for the post.

OMG this was waaay to salty! I always use low sodium soy and even then this was extremly salty. I guess it would have helped if i used low sodium chicken broth too. Needed more peanut butter and cornstarch to thicken it up a bit at the end. Will not make this again.

This was pretty good.  I used low sodium soy sauce & low sodium chicken broth & left out the pepper flakes because I have small children.  Next time I will use regular chicken broth because it needed a little more salt.  Very quick & easy.

Great dish! The pork was very tasty; I added fresh veggies instead of frozen, powdered ginger instead of fresh ginger, and I left out the cashews. It was still a hit for myself and my husband!

Nice idea - and the final dish was really good - but the sauce as written was WAY too salty for me. I ended up adding quite a bit of coconut milk to it to calm it down. Otherwise, the recipe is good - especially using fresh veggies, but you gotta cut down on the soy. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very tasty. I didn't have chicken broth and used water in it's place. It was a bit salty so I added a little milk at the end to cut the salt and make a more gravy-like sauce and I served it over rice which I did not salt either...it was very good...

Very easy and I used the recipe as a starting point. I didn''t use frozen stir-fry veggies opting for fresh veggies (julienned carrots, celery, snap peas) and used green onion instead of the onion. It's on the salty side, as others have stated, so next time will use low sodium but still will cut back on the soy sauce. Will definitely make it again.

I thought this was pretty good. I don't really know how someone thought it was salty... I kept adding soy so I could taste it! But I use high-quality soy so maybe that is why. I also used peanuts because I didn't have cashews and didn't really want to mix my nuts, anyway. lol. And I didn't add too much red pepper flakes because I wanted my 2 year old to at least try it and not gag. It was different and a nice change of pace for a stir fry!

This is REALLY good.  But I will leave the cashews out next time because I don't really like them and they get soggy when you warm up the leftovers.

I thought this was just OK.  The only changes I made were the low sodium soy sauce and the low sodium chicken broth that every other reviewer had mentioned and I used fresh broccli, carrots, sugar snap peas and red pepper instead of frozen. My husband and I still thought this lacked in flavor.  We were expecting a much more peanuty flavor.

Awesome.  Absolutely use low sodium soy sauce.  Even that way it is borderline too salty.

This was really good. The only thing that I changed was I used fresh vegies(broccoli,water chestnuts,beansprouts, and carrots)and I added more red pepper flakes(we like it hot)!Otherwise it was easy and delicious. Leftovers were great the next day,too!!Thanks.

The sauce was okay, but I did not like the texture or flavor of the pork in this dish.  Perhaps if it was made with chicken it would be better.

I've made this twice now with small alterations and am very pleased with the results. I used peanuts instead of cashews because I had them already and they're cheap; I also used a full cup... personal preference. The first time I made it, it was a little on the salty side but not unpalatable, so next time I swapped half the soy sauce for water. I also used 3/4t of pepper flakes because the heat was imperceptible the first time, and I'm kind of a wuss when it comes to spicy food. Served over fried instant ramen noodles and topped with green onions. Will definitely make again.

I reduced the soy sauce after I read one review that it was way too salty. Even then it was much too salty. Disappointed. Will try to see if coconut milk added to the leftovers will help.

It was just too salty for me. I even used low sodium soy sauce and low sodium chicken broth. The peanut butter I used had salt in it. It had a good taste but the high salt content ruined it for me. I ended up adding about a cup of water in order to make it palatable.

This is a great recipes. I did change a few thing .first i stayed with the original sauce recipe adding the pork marinated in  the peanut sauce I put that in a bowl and back into the frig .i then put the onion garlic and ginger and the cashews with the peanut oil sauteed untill it was almost translucent . I then took it off the heat and put it into a bowl and set it aside.. back to the pork and peanut sauce i dont have a wok so a nice size frying pan work for me cook as described  one thing i had to do to keep it from being to thick was to use the chicken stock to thin it while the pork was cooking mid way through the cooking of the pork i added the sauteed onion garlic ginger and cashews to the mix i all so added  Chestnut and bamboo shoot to the mix for me i like to stem my vegetables i used a vegetable melody broccoli cauliflower snow peas and carrots .For me i put the vegetables on the plate and cover with the goodness of the peanut sauce and all the sautéed yummies

I tried this on a cold,blustery. snowbound afternoon, with what I had on hand...I used powdered ginger, and some fresh veggies I  had left over...(carrots and peas)and slivered almonds rather than the cashews, which I've never liked. 
I served it over leftover fettuccine, and absolutely loved it! 
It was a "make do" day, but this was quick, easy and very flavorful!  
Perfect for the weather!   
I am a chef, and am always looking for something new to experiment with...
This is a keeper!

Too peanut-buttery. I would probably do less peanut butter or cook the sauce off more. Also I ended up adding some coleslaw mixing along with the regular vegetables to help absorb some of the sauce and add some texture to the dish.

My husband is addicted. I used a real chinese soy sauce and it wasn't very salty at all. I also used frozen beans and carrots but it worked really well. Toast the Kashews in peanut butter and use minced onion to shave about 8 min off cooking time

Loved this.  Used low sodium soy sauce and low sodium chicken broth.  Green onion instead of regular.  Delicious.  Added some fresh cilantro for garnish.  Next time I will add a little bit more crushed red pepper flake for spice.

I used natural peanut butter and found the sauce to be one-note so I added a tablespoon of lime juice and a tablespoon of brown sugar. My husband liked it enough that he requested I make it again this week!

Way to salty.  Like other reviewers I added coconut milk and corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I also added more peanut butter and served in noodles.

This was really easy and very good!  I put it over Chineese noodles added some chopped green onion and a little more red pepper then what the recipe called for.  My husband said it was a keeper and he is sooooo picky!

This recipe is easy and very flavorful! of course I tweaked a few things... I made it with pre-cooked, shredded chicken instead of pork, skipped the ginger (didn't have any) used garlic powder instead of fresh (again, didn't have any) and used vegetable bouillion instead of chicken broth. I also skipped the mixed veggies, instead I served it over spinach and rice like in thai restaurants. my only complaint would be that is came out a bit salty, so next time i will use less soy sauce and pay more attention to how much boillion cube i am using... otherwise, I will be making this one again!

This was a very tasty dish. Like a previous reviewer, I used the reduced sodium soy sauce with satisfactory results. I personally thought the recipe could use a bit more red pepper. I used the mostly guilt free Dream Fields Spaghetti to put it on. Very nice.

I used chicken instead of pork for this one. I also left out the veggies, but added mushrooms and went heavier on the garlic (I used the jarred kind) and red pepper than the recipe calls for. I love how fast, easy and adjustable this recipe is. My boyfriend said it was the best dinner yet!

I used a raspberry-lime salsa, and it tasted better than what I'd get in a restaurant, not to mention it was super easy!

I REALLY recommend tasting this sauce before you use it... lest you waste a perfectly good pork loin, like i did.  I am a total salt fiend but this was so salty i wanted to die, and i didnt even add any chicken broth. I don't know what I thought peanut butter sauce should taste like but this just wasn't it for me.  sorry.

I really enjoyed this.  Really quick to make too, even though I chopped fresh veggies instead of using frozen ones.  I used a head of broccoli, half of an orange bell pepper, and a couple handfuls of baby carrots, chopped.  I think it could have used even more veggies.  I lessened the soy sauce & used low sodium soy and low-sodium chicken broth, and natural peanut butter.  I used both peanuts and cashews, and just 1/2 cup total.  I didn't have red pepper flakes so I used a little cayenne.  Added my veggies 5 minutes after adding the pork and just cooked till pork was done and veggies were crisp-tender.  Garnished with fresh cilantro and green onions.  Pork was a tiny bit tough but it could have been the cut (I just used 2 boneless pork chops).  Served over brown jasmine rice.  Very enjoyable- thanks!

The flavor was great, but it was WAY to salty. It was so salty, in fact, that I couldn't eat it and had to remake the sauce. I would recommend low sodium soy sauce, and either low or no sodium chicken broth.

Excellent recipe, very tasty!!!! One suggestion i would make would be to use only 1/4 cup soya sauce and use 1/4 cup water (instead of the recipe's 1/2 cup soya sauce).
