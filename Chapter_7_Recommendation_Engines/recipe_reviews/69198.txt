Nothing special. Very salty due to the French Onion Soup and very time consuming. Won't be making again.

Yum!  I didn't have worcestershire, but it came out ok.  I did one layer of beef, a little cheese, one layer of potatoes, a little cheese, and a layer of veggies.  Cooked.  Then put cheese on top for 5 min.  Delicious!

I think this could be better. I didn't find it overly salty at all and thought the potatoes needed a little sprinkle of salt and pepper as they were layered in. The meat mixture had great taste, but is dry. The 3 layers are very distinct with nothing tying them together. It needs more gravy in my opinion. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good. A tad salty,but you could probably skip the salt and pepper to solve that problem. I used oriental vegetables. Next time I think I'll just use broccoli and mushrooms.

It was pretty good, athough I used cream of cheese soup instead of onion soup. I'll try onion soup next time. Thanks for the recipe.

I am neutral on this one. It was Ok, but not spectacular to me. Now my husband loved it so it may be an inividual taste thing. It just seemed a bit bland.
