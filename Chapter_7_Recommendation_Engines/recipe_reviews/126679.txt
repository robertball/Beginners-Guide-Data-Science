This was a delicious way to incorporate a lot of fresh ingredients into a meal! After reading other reviews I used 6 romas & added a 6oz can of tomato paste (and about 2tbsp water to dilute that). I also added a can of chopped basil & oregano tomatoes just because I had it in the pantry; will try without next time. Served over whole wheat pasta.. DELICIOUS! I am convinced that I'll never buy pasta sauce again because this recipe is a great base to add-on to and make my own healthier and homemade version!

This was very nice over whole wheat pasta.  I did add 2 minced cloves of garlic with the onions to suit our taste, but I think it would still be good without it.  Thanks for sharing an easy, tasty pasta topper.

This recipe was simple and delicious! I added minced garlic and a can of tomato paste, as well as some italian seasoning, and a dash of chili powder. I sometimes make a variation of your recipe with chicken breast strips instead of mushrooms, and we love that too. Thanks for the great idea!

This is excellent, nice and simple but still hearty and delicious. I used a pint of halved cherry tomatoes, because I had them on hand, and dried basil as I had no fresh but it was still really great served over creamy polenta. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I substituted crimini mushrooms and used tomato paste instead of wedges (2tbsps paste+1/2 cup water at high altitude). I put the ragout over baked polenta topped with goat cheese. Delish!

Loved this! The onions cooked down nicely. I did add a smidge of tomato sauce to thicken it a bit more.

Great sauce! I froze it in silicone muffin cups. Just the right size for 1 person. Thanks for sharing!

I tried this and it was AMAZING. I made a few changes I'd seen suggested beforehand and a threw in a few of my own. Because my mother in law has a garden with about a billion more tomatoes than she needs, I added in quite a few more than the recipe called for... about 12 cups! I also added a third cup of mushrooms, a can of tomato sauce, 2 tbs garlic, 3 cups bell peppers, and 4 sliced sausages (since I can't do without meat). Then I let it simmer for 45 mins to let all the flavors blend nicely. It was a hit with my family and even though there was so much sauce, it all got eaten. My husband says he now forbids me to buy any canned spaghetti sauce EVER. Thanks so much!

Added a little garlic and a dash of cayenne for a little heat since I was out of red pepper flakes. Served over egg noodles . So awesome and simple. Thanks for a great recipe.

I was trying to find something to eat quickly. I sauteed some red onion in olive oil. Then I put in processed cherry tomatoes and mushrooms. I was too lazy to chop them up. I put in some ms. Dash too. Not sure if it's good to use that but I like it. Added some salt, parsley and some shredded sharp cheddar. I did this again and added egg and that was good too.
