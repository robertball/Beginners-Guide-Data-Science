I submitted this recipe and wanted to note that I actually boil the potatoes in 2  Tablespoons of salt and 1 Teaspoon of pepper.  I also use 1 teaspoon of dill...or maybe a heaping teaspoon of dill and about 3/4 of a 32 oz. block of Velveeta cheese because I like the soup pretty cheesy.  I have tried adding other vegetables, etc. but for some reason, I think it is the tastiest as is.  I hope you enjoy it!

What can I say that hasn’t been said?  This is a great recipe, with great taste and texture.  M’Lady actually thought that I had added cream to the dish!  This will definitely be made again and again in this household.  We are eager to try this with other cheeses, too.

It's Sunday--my weekly soup making time! I boiled my potatoes in homemade chicken stock and because I only had half the amount of Velveeta called for, I used half Velveeta and half Cracker Barrel 2% extra sharp white cheddar. Nice basic cheddar potato soup that went well with black forest ham grilled cheese. My oldest boy chowed down on this with me. I did add a bit of Frank's Hot Sauce when I ate mine. Next time, I might add a little more cheese. NOTE: Almost all of the ingredients I used in this soup I bought cheaply at my Grocery Outlet. This soup cost next to nothing to make and it doubled real well.

This soup was great! When my very picky family first saw it, they turned their noses up. I told everyone that they had to at least try it, and every single one ended up loving this soup! My potatoes were very large, so I used 9 instead of 12. I also used only 4 cups of milk...I saved the potato liquid and used a cup of that in place of the last cup of milk. I hated to see that flavorful water go to waste, and the soup was very rich, creamy, and yummy without the last cup of milk! This recipe is just what I wanted, cheap, easy, family friendly, and yummy! Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious!  Made it last night and every kid - and hubby - said, "Good soup!"  (and I make a LOT of soup)  Creamy, delicious and very comforting.

WOW!! I've been looking for a simple potato soup recipe and I've found it! Thanks Junebug's Mom! This was very simple and quick to prepare. We loved it and this will now be a regular in our home. I 1/2 the recipe down to 6 servings. The only thing I changed is it called for 1/2 lb of Velvetta and I used the whole pound because we are cheese lovers. The hubby and I both ate leftovers for lunch the next day at work and we both had to reheat in microwaves. Reheated it was still very good and we didn't have to add water like you sometimes have to do with other soups. Nice creamy texture. Next time I may add a little bacon or ham (after the holidays with leftovers), but it is perfectly fine as written. Also be sure to read Junebugs comment about adding salt and pepper while boiling the potatoes and adding extra cheese if you wish. This is also something I can make quickly after getting home from work, so that's a big + in my book! Thanks for an awesome recipe Junebug!! :)

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I put too much milk so I added some instant potatoes to thicken, a bit of garlic powder and my husband requested some bacon bits to put on top.  I didn't have any dill, but if I missed anything, I sure didn't taste it!  First cold day after Summer and yummy hot soup for dinner.  I'll make this again and pass it along as well!

I cut this recipe in half since only 2 of us were eating.  I substituted 8 oz. of extra sharp white cheddar and 12 oz yellow cheddar for the processed cheese.  I grated it and added it to the milk and heated and stirred the milk until it all had melted.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  We enjoyed it and will be making this again over the winter, although I may add a bit more dill and maybe a shake of worstershire.  Thank you JM for a soup that will warm many a cold night at our house.

It's all been said, excellent soup. I added the dill just before it went on the table. This makes the flavor more intense. If you add it as the cheese melts, the flavor mellows as it cooks.

Bring on the comfort food! Woozers, this is good. I don't usually like dill, but I really like it in this recipe. Used a bit less Velveeta & garlic powder for the 2nd addition of salt. I scaled it to 3 potatoes, and mashed them a bit. I also don't peel, I like potato skin. It's so good!

Loved this soup! Made it almost as written, except I used real sharp cheddar cheese & let the milk heat up before adding the grated cheese a handful at a time. I also did not peel the potatoes, because the peel provides fiber & extra nutrients. I decided to toss 1+ tablespoons of flour into the cheese to ensure it didn't clump up - that may not have been necessary because the potatoes do provide a starchy liquid, & because the soup thickened up when I'd put in only about 2/3 lb. of cheese - very thick! Of course it tasted delicious, but I did wind up adding more milk to my desired consistency, & even a little more when I reheated some later. A tad more dill is nice also. Wonderful soup - I will make this again! (I did taste it all along & it was great before & after the changes to milk & dill quantities.)

I love dill so I had to try this soup. However, I figured out too late I only had half the amount of velveeta needed and not quite enough milk. I replaced half of velveeta with cream cheese and used some half and half. I was feeling guilty over all the fat I addded in it so I added a cup of chopped celery. This soup is amazing!

Delicious! I took the advice of a reviewer and added an additional pinch of dill right before I served the soup to make the flavor a little stronger.

Very good soup!  I scaled it down in half and took Kerstin's advice and still used a whole pound of Velveeta.  Really good on a cold night (which we don't have many of in So Fla).  Thanks, Junebug's Mom

I really enjoyed this soup. The dill flavor kind of creeps up on you, not overwhelming in the least. I did double this recipe as I am feeding a dozen people every night. This soup did not thicken up for me though. Not sure why. I thought about attempting to thicken it in a variety of ways (ie: Potato flakes, flour, cornstarch) not sure how it would have affected the taste though. So I opted to keep this recipe as it was this time. Next time I will try on of the thickening agents and see how that comes out. Very delicious soup!

Followed the recipe as written. Excellent potato soup. I thought the dill would overpower this, but it didn't, I added a little at a time just in case. I didn't read the reviews until I had already made this, so the whole tablespoon of pepper went in, then I thought it needed some more, so I added another 1/4 tsp or so, it was definitely peppery, which is fine, we like pepper. No extra pepper next time. Used the velveeta and it didn't overpower the soup as you might think. All in all, a nicely balanced creamy potato soup. Easy to make, no flour, no cream, no broth, not a lot of expense. I served with a nice asiago cheese bread, it was marvelous. Thanks Junebug's Mom!

Tasty soup, but a little watery for me, so I think I'd try a roux next time at the beginning to see if that would help.  I also would recommend trying a roux if you use cheddar, which I did since I didn't have velveeta on hand.  I definitely prefer the taste of cheddar but it does not melt as nicely as velveeta, so beware of that (my cheddar just stuck all togehter!).  I also think I'd like a bit more dill or some additional spices to punch up the flavor a bit; otherwise, a nice fall/winter soup that works well with a sandwich.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was tasty & much quicker to make than roux-based potato-cheese soups. I do prefer the roux based variety, personally. This makes a huuuge pot of soup - I had to omit the last cup of milk because my pot was getting too full! The dill adds a welcome complexity to potato-cheese soup. Thanks for the recipe, Junebug's Mom!

Delicious!  It was like au gratin potatoes in a bowl.  My husband would have liked ham (maybe wild rice too).  Next time we'll add a meat.  I halved the recipe but used the whole 16 oz of cheese.  Saved one cup of the potato water to use instead of 1 cup of milk.  Followed others and used 2 tbsp salt and 1 tbsp pepper in the water with a whole onion. (added a dash of poultry seasoning too). Added the dill at the very end and could have used a little more. My 5 year old loved it too. Great!

I added some extra Velveeta cheese and the only the I added was a tablespoon of dijon mustard, which I add to all cheese soups. This is a great recipe, but I probably use a real cheese next time because I am not a fan of the processed cheese. Regardless of my personal preference, this is an excellent recipe and super easy too.

Yum! This was an awesome recipe. I didn't vary from the recipe except that I did add the extra cheese like Junebug said in another rating. It was so creamy and delicious. And it was super easy also. I would definately make this again.

UH-Mazing! So simple and fast, took me about 30 minutes to complete! It was so tasty too, I fried up some bacon and added it just thought it'd taste good. Everything else i did the same, will be making this often! Thanks for the recipe!

We absolutely LOVED this soup! I used fat free milk cause that's all I buy. I used 1 pound of Velveeta then added about 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar and near 1 cup of shredded pepper jack. It was a little on the thin side, so I dissolved about 1- 1/2 tbsp. corn starch into a little cold water and stirred that it. When it came to a boil it was perfect consistancy. We really loved the bite that the pepper jack gave to this soup. I know I will be making this very often! Thank You Junbug's Mom for such a rich and delicious recipe! :)

We really enjoyed this soup. My potatoes were fairly large so I only used 9. It was the perfect amount. I did use more cheese since the recipe submitter uses more as well. The only thing I did different was that I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth since that is how I was taught to do them for potato soup. Next time I will add more dill. It was a very quick and easy meal great for busy nights. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe as is!!  Made many times.  Sometimes add extra cheese as some people recommended, to make it thicker.   Have also made this using the frozen southern style hash brown potatoes (cubed kind).  Saved time, and still tasted great!

It's pretty good. I like to add cooked, chopped bacon to it. I reduce the pepper, and don't add until after the potatoes have boiled. Also, I use more dill and add in real shredded cheese. Doesn't really matter which kind. I've also added some cornstarch when I haven't wanted to mess with blending some potatoes to make it thicker. Maybe instant potatoes would work too? Either way, it's a pretty easy recipe to adapt to your own tastes.

I used 15 potatoes because mine were pretty small. It does take forever to peel and dice that many potatoes! (Or maybe I'm just slow at it!) I liked the onion flavor, I used 4 small onions. I only used 1 lb of the velveeta, but thought it needed more so added another half pound of it, will def. add 2 lbs next time. Great recipe thanks for sharing.

We loved this! For me, the most time-consuming part was the peeling and dicing the potatoes- if you aren't a very efficient peeler/chopper, it may take you about 35-40 minutes to do that part. But the rest is so easy and overall it comes together quickly without much hassle. I used a 16 oz block of 2% Velveeta and skim milk, which I know isn't ideal but I thought it tasted fine- it was just thinner than it would have been had I used a milk with a higher fat content. Also, I had fresh dill on hand from another recipe so I used about 3T of fresh dill and it was great. Husband approved too! Thanks for sharing!

I guess I was hoping for something different than our family potato soup. It was good though.(love potato soup!) I added more dill and I still didn't taste it. Maybe it's me. DH said he noticed the difference.

This was really good, but I think the pepper should be less at first, or don't add more to it after boiling the potatoes. Otherwise, this is good, my husband and I both enjoyed it! :)

This one totally grew on me as I ate it. It seemed way too simple and different than anything I'd made before so I didn't have too high of expectations, but it was very delicious! I cut this down to a 3 serving size and followed the recipe as written. I used nonfat milk and 2% velveeta. I did add quite a bit more s&p when tasting, and thought it could definitely use more dill (I didn't even really taste it at all). The simple veggies with the perfect cheese flavor was very nice!
