Good recipe. Can be cooked in a covered cast-iron casserole inside the oven (Dutch Oven style). Add a few drops of lemon juice or (sour)clover leaves. (Zuuring in South Africa)

This is a very good recipe.  I added 2 tbsl. of lemon juice,  4 cloves of garlic and I used fingerling potatoes instead.  Turned out very nice.

I enjoy trying foods from other countries, especially when it turns out to be a great recipe.   By American tastes, this tastes just like a simple Swiss steak  only served in a bowl as a hearty stew.   I used venison instead of lamb.   I figured it would be a perfect substitute since lamb is a stronger meat that can come off gamey at times.  The stew wasn’t as thick as I expected, so I removed the lid for the final 20 minutes of cooking and it thickened up just fine.  Hubby and I were pleasantly surprised by the tenderness of the meat since I used a cut that should have been tough.  We also expected a gamey taste, but  it wasn’t gamey at all.  I’m guessing the vinegar, which was also undetectable, had something to do with it.  This one is going in the keep file and one that we will have often this winter.

Being a South African living in New Zealand I was delighted to come across this recipe. Reminds me of the cold winter afternoons spent making this in abundance to freeze for reheating.  Thank you so much for posting this.

My Afrikaner husband hasn't been able to visit home (South Africa) for 4 years. He misses the traditional recipes that he enjoyed as a kid. I decided to surprise him by making this along with some putu pap and melktart. 

I followed this recipe almost to the letter but couldn't restrain myself from adding garlic. The final product was perfection. The meat and potatoes were so tender and silky. The sauce was flavored perfectly. It tasted very traditional, like my mother-n-law made it herself. 

Thank you so much for this recipe! It will be a family favorite for years.

I am a South African living in America and this great recipe is very much like the traditional recipe my mother makes, which has been handed down through generations. Tasty, perfectly flavoured and easy to make- a winner!

Lovely - followed the recipe, and added spinach right at the end. Served with white rice and pumpkin -- South African style. Will make it again.

Actually, made this recipe more than once.   We have good fresh tomatoes and
NZ leg of lamb available here.  Didn't have bay leaf, substituted fresh ground coriander.   After the first steps make sure the heat is low enough not to burn the bottom, then cook for a long time. Delicious!  You will get compliments.

This tasted exactly how I remembered it as a child.  I made it for my Dutch family so it was their first time eating it and they are begging me to make it again. Super tasty, sauce has so much flavour. Make sure to buy quality stewing lamb to make this recipe at its best.

This is filling and delicious.  I didn't have vinegar so I used lemon juice.  I omitted the peppercorns, sugar and instead of frying the meat dredged in cake flour, I browned it without and then added 2 tablespoons of gluten free pancake mix to give the bredie a "roux" like base.  I also added a clove of garlic.  I had the leftovers the next day and simmered an egg in the bredie.  So good!  This is my new winter staple.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe, William R!

My husband & 12 year old son loved this!  I served it over rice.  Instead of lamb or mutton, I used rotisserie chicken that I added after cooking all the rest of the ingredients (45 mins.). I cooked it another 10 mins. or so to heat the chicken completely. Other things I would change are that I would use only 1/2 of an onion, 1/4 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce and 1 1/2 tsp. beef bouillon next time.

Being South African I loved this recipe. Reminds me of my mother's cooking. I did this up in my poitjie pot and of course I added garlic.
