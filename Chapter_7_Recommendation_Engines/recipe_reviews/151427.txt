This recipe's great! i used it for our group project in garde manger class (cold kitchen and my groupmates totally loved it. Everyone asked for the recipe. i made a few alterations though... 

no italian bread crumbs? we just used plain bread crumbs and mixed 1/2 part italian seasoning. we also added a big pinch of salt and pepper. it totally brought out the flavor of the beef. And
Instead of cooking it on the grill, we just seared it on a pan grill to get the beautiful grill marks then finished cooking the burgers in the oven for about 5-8min, it depends on your preferred doneness of the burger. 
instead of putting it on a bun, we wrapped it in tortilla wrap with lettuce, tomato slices and light mayo then put it on a hot dry pan to brown the tortilla and give it a nice crunch. :)

awsome recipe! thanks a bunch.

This was a really, really good recipe!! The only thing that I can say is that the meat  falls apart on the grill if you turn it too much.  My advice is to let it cook to a char or well done on the first side before turning it over.  Also, it is a very rich flavor so have something nice to drink with it.

I'm only giving three stars because I haven't tried this yet, but it sounds good.
The only thing I can say is that these sound more like a Greek style burger, not much of anything "Italian" in it except for the bread crumbs.
Kalamata olives and the feta cheese are used more so in Greek dishes.
Anyways, this sounds really tasty and I'll have to give it a try soon.

I wouldn't exactly call these Italian but they were very tasty. Kalamata as written would have been better but mine had gone bad and I had to sub black olives at the last minute. They still turned out very good and I am looking forward to trying them again with the right olives. Thanks!

These burgers are very good.  However, I found them to be more of a Greek burger than an Italian one, what with the addition of feta cheese.  I would make these for friends.  I am making them next week for my company get together.
