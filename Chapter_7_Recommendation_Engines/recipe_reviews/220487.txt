These are delicious!  The only thing I would do different would be to use salted butter next time!  I made these to crumble over ice cream for friends, but we were just content to eat these by themselves!  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect balance of sugars with cinnamon flavor. I think the butter was just the touch that is missing from the other recipes I've been trying out. I tried it with 1 lb jar of peanuts because their cheaper to test a recipe on and they came out absolutly delightful. Can't wait to try it on pecans now!! A+ you nailed it!

I saw this recipe and read all the 5 star reviews and thought it would be good to try a new recipe. I make roasted pecans twice a year and I have never cooked them with butter in the pan before, it sounded good, so thought I would give it a tryâ€¦.big mistake. After 35 mins, the pecans were BURNED! The oven temp is too high and adding butter to the pan made them burn even faster! All nuts (including Pecans) have oil in them..no need to add more. I'll stick with 250 degree oven and no butter from now on!

Stop what you are going and make this recipe. These are so good! I have tried a couple other pecan recipes, and this is far superior.

I had extra pecans from the holidays so tried this for a card game. Everyone who tried it liked it a lot. I too doubled everything except the pecans as many suggested. Needless to say it is not healthy, but for special occasion very easy and well liked

Mix any kind of nuts it is great for those of us not allergic, if diabetic cut sugars in half and use artificial sweetner sugar twin or something like it.
