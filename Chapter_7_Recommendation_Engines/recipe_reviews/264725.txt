Tastes very good. Next time I will cut the cream cheese smaller. But other than that it was very tasty.

I should really give these 5 stars - they were so good! However, I made a couple changes. I had buttermilk complete pancake mix already on hand, and used 1/2 cup coconut flour (and about 2 Tbsp water) and 1-1/2 cups pancake mix. . Only other change was to omit the strawberry jam - no need for it! Will make again.
