I really messed with this recipe, but it came out very flavorful!  First, I added a whole diced onion and green pepper instead of just the few tablespoons the recipe called for.  I also added one stalk of diced celery, since I had to buy one for the leaves.  Finally, I also added garlic and one, small, grated zucchini in with the veggies because I had a leftover one in the fridge.      When I added the flour, I also added some celery salt.  When I made the dumplings, I added garlic powder.   Dinner was so delicious!  The only complaint I have is that it seems to need another can of tomatoes.  The only liquid is a 28-ounce can, and that's less than 5 ounces a serving!  There's a little bit of liquid for a lot of dumplings.  So, I think I'll double the tomatoes next time, too.

This was a good, simple recipe, but I think the tomato sauce needs a little seasoning and spice.  We doubled the onion, used a red pepper because that's all we had, added 1tbls garlic and 1 tbls dried basil.  Could have used even more seasoning.  Next time i will add other spices and add some oregano or basil to the dumplings themselves.
