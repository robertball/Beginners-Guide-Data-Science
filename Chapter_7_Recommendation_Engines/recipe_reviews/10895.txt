We have updated this recipe to reflect our current style guidelines and we added some foil to the preparation of the pan to help with the sticking problem.

I always line the bottom of my pan with parchament so the bars do not stick and do not use nuts because no one in my family will eat them.  I have also made them using chocolate chips and cinnamon chips and they were fabulous.

This is so sweet and delicious!  I had a terrible time getting the foil off.  I let it sit for about 3 hours and then had better luck.  It is ooey gooey and hard to cut into bars but well worth the effort.  It would be perfect left in the pan-then sit in front of it with a fork and coffee! :)

My husband loves anything with butterscotch chips and this is no exception!  Definitely use parchment paper...no sticking at all!

I followed this exactly except I left out the walnuts. I brought it into work and it was devoured in less than 30 minutes. Everybody kept talking about how good they were.

Very easy recipe, and delicious, but a little too rich, I think. (Too much of a temptation if you're trying to watch your weight!) If I make it again, I'll make half as much, in a loaf pan.

A quick alternative to layer bars.  Graham crumbs and condensed milk are a little bland.  I added a tsp of vanilla.  Next time I'll add a sq of melted chocolate, too.  I sprinkled a little coconut on top and I liked that addition.  This is such a quick dessert and an excellent base for whatever you like to add.  The mix was VERY stiff to 'press' into a pan.  But it was worth it.

variation to this I added some skor bits and substituted pecan pieces for the walnuts. Another variation was changing the graham cracker crumbs to Oreo crumbs and adding coconut.  Both were awesome
I also found it easier baking in a glass pan for trying to get it out.

Excellent dish.  Chocolate crumbly and butterscotch just melted in your mouth.  Divine!!!!!!!  I would have used 3/4 cup of chocolate chips and maybe added a 1/4 cup of butterscotch chips.  Easy for beginners, and easy to change if you are a pro.

These are sooooo easy, and very tasty! Very sweet, I am thinking of adding coconut next time so they are more like 7 layer bars. ( I leave out the nuts though)

Deliciously rich and wonderful! I too used parchment paper and flipped it upside down on a plate while still a little warm.

VERY easy ~ VERY delicious! I used wax paper and had a very hard time removing it (my mistake) - so I definitely would use well greased foil like the recipe says!

This did not turn out for me.  Big problem  with sticking. No one ate them.
