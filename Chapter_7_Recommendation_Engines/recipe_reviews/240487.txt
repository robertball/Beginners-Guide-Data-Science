I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of cabbage on hand, but using the first reviewers suggestion to use less water, I found that just over a cup was more than enough for the double batch.  In addition to adding the vinegar at the start of cooking, I added the same amount and some salt at the end to make the flavor stand out more.  Those adjustments seemed to help make it work better.

I made as written and this was super simple however I feel some of the flavor gets lost in all of the water. Next time I will boil the cabbage in the water and caraway seeds for 20 minutes, drain, and then add the oil and vinegar in the last 10 minutes. This recipe pairs nicely with pork.

I halved the water and used sesame seed since I didn't have any caraway (which I'll buy for my next attempt).  Very good dish and easy to prepare.  My husband liked it also.  Will definitely make again.

I only had half a head so I read the other reviews, took their advice and adjusted amounts. I added half a sliced onion - which I cooked in olive oil for a few minutes before adding the cabbage.
