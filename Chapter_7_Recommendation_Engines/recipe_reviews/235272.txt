350 degrees is too low to cook beets for 45 minutes, especially since your instructions are to place them initially in the roasting foil whole (unsliced).  Even though "double roast" them sliced for another 25 minutes, the temperature is still too low and not enough cooking to cure the initial mistake.  If you want soft, juicy beets that aren't raw then try slicing first and cooking them at 400-425 for about an hour.  After that you can mix in whatever you want and cook them more.

Excellent - need to adjust portions of cheese and walnuts based on size of beet(s).  I used three small beets, a little more than 2 oz cheeze and a little more than 1/2 cup of walnuts.  My beet greens weren'tin good shape and was using for vegetarian dinner so I served beets and cheese over sauteed baby spinach topped with walnuts and drizzled with vinegar. My husband loved it!

Delicious! I doubled the beets because my garden is abundant this year with lots of large, sweet beets.  I didn't double anything else as my beet greens this time of year (Sept. in Colorado) are getting dry.  Actually it took two beets to get enough tender small beet greens to make one cup. I used olive oil, pecans and seasoned rice vinegar; that's what I had on hand. I recommend an 8" X 8" baking dish for this recipe. If you double the beets you'll need a 7" X 11" dish or larger, the beets need to be one layer in dish. Suggestion: toast walnuts and beet the night before so you won't have so many steps and you only have to bake the second day for 15 minutes. Thanks John

This was a very nice, updated way to prepare beets. The flavor combination works great. I would have given it 5 stars if it had somehow made beet-eaters out of my boys and husband, but alas, this recipe does not work miracles.

This was sooooo good!!  I didn't have walnut oil so I used olive oil, and no champagne vinegar so I subbed balsamic.  I can only imagine that those differences would make it better, but this was spectacular anyway!

My family was very unsure when  I brought this to the table, but they loved  it and ate it up! I have made it twice now and it is a favorite. The only change I make is I toast my walnuts in the microwave. It only takes a few minutes on high and doesnâ€™t tie up the oven. Will make again!

Absolutely loved this recipe. Followed as written and no need for changes except my beets took a bit longer to soften. I like the fact that you can do the initial cooking of the beets early and finish the recipe as your company arrives. Thanks Chef John!!

Yum!  I had some goat cheese to use up and found this recipe I wanted to try.  The only trouble was that beets are not in season, so I made it with sliced canned beets.  I can't wait to make it again with fresh beets and beet greens.  The vinegar sprinkled at the end was a nice touch.

I was a little apprehensive about trying this recipe as my experience with beets when I was younger was not pleasant (canned in vinegar).  However, I am trying to achieve a healthier diet and I was not disappointed!  I would not change a thing!

Outstanding recipe, made according to recipe except left out chives. Very tasty and my husband also enjoyed. The video was both entertaining and instructive.

Chef's beet was very small. I too had to crank up the heat and cook the beet twice as long. Recipe was OK but not a favorite.

Fabulous. Next time I would not toast the walnuts so long. The second round in the oven almost burned them.

Delicious! The champagne vinegar is a perfect touch to this very tasty recipe. My kids ate it and my son asked me to make it again. It is easy to make and healthy. I will make this dish for company sometime in the future.

I took some other folks' advice and roasted the beets at 425 for 45 min.  I used 6 small beets, omitted the champagne vinegar because I didn't have any and I used feta cheese because I like it better than goat cheese.  I also omitted chives because I didn't have them.  But even with these small changes, this is a fantastic and beautiful dish!

I quartered the beets first before I roasted the them in the oven with the olive oil and thyme. I used the cooled beets over the fresh greens and all the remaining ingredients. Turned out great. Delicious salad!
