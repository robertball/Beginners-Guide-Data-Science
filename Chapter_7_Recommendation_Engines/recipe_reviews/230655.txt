This was delicious. I made my own crust added seasoning to it and used canned crab instead of imitation. I also used hominy instead of corn since I cannot have corn skins. Really good. I'll make this again

I would now recommend real crab over imitation.

I used Naan as the crust. I had sweet corn in the freezer and that makes everything great! It turned out really good.
