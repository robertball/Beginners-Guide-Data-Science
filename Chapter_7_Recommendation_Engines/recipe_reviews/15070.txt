I made this for my husband's hunting trip to feed a group of hungry men, and they all insist I must make this for every trip now. This is a recipe you can really play with...first off I did cheat a little and used a store bought rotisserie chicken, cut up. I also used a yellow and orange pepper along with the red and green for color. I omitted the ginger and sage completely and opted for poultry seasoning, a little more cumin, and some chipotle red pepper. I always use a bunch of different white beans...Northern, Cannellini, Garbanzo, Navy, and even black-eyed peas (because I LOVE them). I usually will mash one can to get a thicker heartier consistency. Top with a dollop of sour cream and some fresh cut chives and a sprinkle of Cheddar cheese...it is so yummy and very satisfying!

I added a little more chicken broth to make it not quite so thick.  It's the best white chili recipe I've tasted.

Wow, this has great flavor.  I served with some rolls & a salad and it was an very filling meal.  (I didn't even have a roll with mine).  Thanks for a truly wonderful, low fat & good for you meal!  I do the weight watchers point system & each serving of the chili came out to only 3.5 points by browning the chicken in cooking spray instead of oil and using margarine in place of the butter.

Made stove top. Used only 2 jalapenos, forgot the ginger and drained the beans before I realized I shouldn't have.  Substituted corn and a small zucchini for the yellow bell pepper.  No need  for flour or butter since I wanted a brothy, thinner soup.  Sauted everything in olive oil.  I think this is a no fail recipe and can easily be customized to your taste.  Served with sliced avocado on top, rounding out the meal with a tomato salad and warm corn muffins drizzled with honey.

This was great chili but I added 3 cloves of garlic and cilantro and it was even better. My husband and 22 month old daughter loved it.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Tastes great and is very colorful.  I also added more garlic and cumin and served it up with some cornbread.  However, it wasn't spicy to me at all.  I would add some of the jalepano seeds the next time I made it.  I like spicy foods though.

Very, very good.  Be careful with those jalepeno's if you don't like spice!  We served it topped with tortilla chips, shredded cheese and sour cream.  Yum!

Four and a half stars because I needed to tweak some things to get it just right. I used 3 cups of chicken stock for this, or it would have been too thick. I used 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin and added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper as well as 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. This may sound like a lot, but I cut back the jalapenos to two and kept the seeds (easier to change and add to the hotness once the dish was almost done rather than upfront with the jalapenos). I also added a green bell pepper as well as a small chopped yellow onion (in addition to the green onion). One of the biggest things, however, was that I ended up picking out the chicken chunks and shredding them to help the chicken pick up more flavor; otherwise the pieces were tasting rather bland. Served with shredded cheddar on top - really good! Thanks for the recipe.

I used a precooked chicken from the store plus an extra can of white beans, that I pureed in a food processor. This was a huge hit and one I'll surely make to satisfy a hungry crowd. I served it with tortilla chips too.

I had never made White Chili before but had had it from other people. I chose to make this recipe for a friend last night and it turned out AMAZING! I will definitely be making this again. I put this in my crock pot on low while I was at work which worked out great. Due to a lack of time, I ended up using a Rotisery Chicken which was already extremely moist and was so good in the chili. I also put in 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 which was good, but only put in 3 Jalepenos because I was nervous it would be too spicy with 4. I'd add 4 definitely next time because there was no kick with only 3. Definitely worth making!

This recipe took considerable doctoring up from the original one that is posted. I just followed a lot of the other suggestions in the reviews that are already up. One thing that I was very surprised/disappointed about is how little this recipe makes. It says that it serves 6 but honestly makes MAYBE two dinner size bowls. My husband and I are piecing together some other left overs to make a true meal! If you're planning to feed more than one or two people make sure to at least double/triple this recipe!! Also, as others have said, all those jalapenos are just too much! All in all it does taste good though.

I came home to this one night when my daughter and husband decided that they wanted to cook dinner!  It was very filling and tasty.  They didn't change a thing and all of the ingredients we had on hand.  We will definitely make again.  We are just trying to think of a way to make the rue lower fat.....

OMG, this chili is amazing!  We cheated with the chicken and used a already roasted grocery store one instead.  We forgot to buy chicken breasts is all.  My husband and I LOVED it.  It did have a little kick, I added a handful of sliced jalapenos, but we like a little warmth so that's ok.  I wouldn't change a thing!!  We will definitely be making this a few more times, it will help us deal with this long MN winter coming up that's for sure!!  Thank you!

This is a great recipe. I did make a few changes, though. I used one can of cannellini beans instead of a second can of great northern beans, just for variety. I also decided to drain the beans instead of add the liquid, and I'm glad I did. We like a thicker chili, and the chicken broth and flour base was just enough for us. The spice combination was perfect, but I upped the amount on all the spices because we like it spicy. I also added oregano and some cayenne pepper as well, and tossed in some fresh cilantro at the end. Because we like it spicy, I substituted one of the bell peppers for a New Mexico chile and two of the jalapenos with habaneros. To really set it off, squeeze some lime juice over each serving - trust me on this.

Love this! I was looking for a recipe for my leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I looked over a lot of white chili recipes, but this one looked most intriguing the spices. We were NOT disappointed! This dish could almost convince me not to make beef chili again. I also love it because, like another reviewer stated, the recipe is very, very versatile! Thanks so much for sharing this Nancy!

SUPER!!  I used a regular onion as well and left out the ginger.  Otherwise I followed it completely.   Really Good!  Both my husband and step-son loved it.

I love this recipe and my boyfriend requests it all the time. So easy and fast for chili. The changes I make is using more chicken since we're big poultry fans and less butter as it is great with only half a tablespoon or so and so much healthier. We also usually use white or yellow onion in place of the green onions since that's what tends to be in the house. Two thumbs up!

This is really good!  I almost never make anything from this website as per the original instructions (I normally tweak it based on the reviews) but I made this exactly as it said in the instructions and it turned out great!  I don't like things super spicy, but I do like some hotness to it, and 4 seedless jalapenos were just right.  If you like things really hot, you'll want to add something extra though.  I like to serve white chili over fritos (that's how it was served to me the first time I ever had it, and I liked it so much that I have always done it that way!) and I also added some cheese on top (a slice of pepperjack and some shredded cheddar).

Instead of using flour, if you like it thicker, I agree with another reviewer who does what I do...puree a can of white beans & that is your thickener. All over,it was tasty.

Yummy....omitted the jalepenos so my family will eat it and subbed them for 2 small cans of diced mild green chilies. Also added 2 small diced green zucchini, 2 cans of small white beans, and frozen white corn. Topped with sour cream and shredded Mexican blend cheeses and used whole grain tortilla chips for scooping. Delicious!

I loved this just the way the recipe was written... I also used the chicken and spices to make awesome fajitas!! Just leave out the beans and liquid!

Made it many times... take seeds out of jalapeno's, and extra cumin is the key...

We used 2 jalapeños with seeds and it was really spicy, just as we like it! I omitted the sage and doubled the cumin..also added a couple dashes of chili powder and an extra cup of broth. Fabulous! Will make again soon.

I must say I did not like how some of the seasonings came together in this. I have never eaten white chili before (we really only make red beefy chili) and wanted to try new beans. I didn't care for the sage and really could taste the ginger. It felt out of place... I really had no idea what to expect with this chili but I found it to be just OK. I used a rotisserie chicken because I forgot to thaw out my chicken and I dont like nuking them. I don't feel like that was the right move with the chili... I would stick with the recipe and cubed your chicken. It made the chili extremely thick- so thick I ended up putting a lot more broth into it. Which in the end it did not need.

This is definitely an awesome white chicken chili recipe.  I reviewed others' commnents before I made it, and also made my own adjustments.  I added yellow corn for some sweetness and also some vidalia onion along with the green onion - I love onions.  I doubled the cumin, but did not put in sage.  After 4 jalapenos, I certainly felt it was hot enough.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I like the consistency - not too thick, not too soupy.  Just to experiment, I may try it sometime with ground turkey or chicken to really make it reminiscient of chili, but I worry I'll miss the great chunks of white meat.  Great recipe.

Very good recipe - I cooked the chicken in the crock pot and shredded it instead of cubing and sauteing.  I also put all the peppers in my food processor.  This eliminated the need for any oil and made the recipe even healthier.  Next time I'm going to add a packet of Fajita mix for extra spice.

A friend told me about this recipe.  My family really enjoyed this chili.  I doubled the recipe.  We topped it with Jalapeno Jack the first time and then had it the next day with some brown rice.  Very tasty, even better the next day.  This recipe will be made often, even my children liked it.  Thanks!

This was very good.  Easy to prepare
i made it again today and even with the 4 jalapeno's it was not overly spicy. I splashed a little Frank's Red Hot sauce "chili lime" flavor and grated asiago cheese on top and crunched up some tortilla chips and it was perfect.

I made this for my family on a cold and snowy day and it was wonderful...after I made a few changes to the basic recipe! First, I omitted the peppers and replaced with 2 large cans of green chiles and 1 can of rotel.  I also omitted the ginger and sage tThanks to the previous review), and added a little more cumin and some ground chipolte red pepper flakes! Finally I mashed the second can of beans for the thicker consistency and incorportated it all into my crock pot for a yummy hot soup dinner!

Love the flavor but I wanted to reduce the sodium and fat so I made the following changes. Used reduced sodium chicken broth. Drained the beans before adding. To replace the butter & flour I added an additional can of beans that I drained, then pureed.

Delicious!  I used a green bell pepper instead of yellow, because it's what I had, and used 3 large jalapenos + a small can of diced mild fire roasted chiles.  Had a really nice heat to it.  I will definitely make this again.

I renamed it Hot Chicken Chili...I'm the 2nd person on here that won a church chili cookoff with this recipe!  That's why I selected it in the first place.  I doubled the recipe and ended up only using 5 jalepenos (doubling called for 8) and there was still plenty of kick!

I made this for a group of friends and they loved it!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  The only changes I made after reading the other reviews were...I add a couple of cans of beans pureed and did the roux also to get the consistency.  In addition I doubled the spice from 1/2 to 1 tsp and I used 4 tsp of cumin...it was delicious...thanks for the recipe.

This was the first time I made white chili and my guests absolutely raved about this recipe.  I will definitely make this again, as will my lunch guests who insisted on copying the recipe.  I made it without the jalepenos because of the number of people I was serving, but it was still excellent.

Great recipe!  I didn't have any green onions, so I chopped up a yellow onion instead.  Also, we like spice, so I used all the ribs and seeds from the jalapeños and it was just right.

I see this recipe has been revised....the original recipe didn't say whether to seed the jalapeno's or not....and my chili was much
too hot with two unseeded. I'm glad to see that the recipe is now more succinct because it is a good recipe to try.

Great flavor. Made it in the crock pot, cooked on high for 3 to 3.5 hrs.  Left out jalepenos to make it less spicy. Just melted butter and mixed with flour separately, then added to crockpot, and it thickened fine. Added green onions, mozzarella cheese, and a little sour cream when serving.

Mmm! Lots of good veg in here. I cut the chicken breast up while it was still partially frozen. That makes for neater cubes. I left out the roux. Mine was thick enough without it.

This recipe was great! Even better than what I expected. I had tons of bell peppers in the house that needed to be used up so I went searching for recipes that I can make with boneless chicken tenders and luckily I had almost everything to make this!

My substitutions-
While cooking the chicken in the olive oil I added some fresh black pepper, a dash of salt, garlic and onion powder; as some reviewers said the chicken tasted a little bland. 

I also didn't have jalepenos or diced green chilis like others have mentioned, so I subbed for a green pepper with a sprinkle of dried red chilis (a little goes a long way - I didn't put a lot and it gave my chili a big kick!) Along with the other peppers and onion and I added one more clove of garlic. 

When adding in the seasonings, I used fresh ginger and added in a sprinkle of oregano, chili powder and garlic powder (I love my garlic). 

I used dried northern beans which I had to soak and cook first. The conversion for two cans would be around 3 cups of cooked dried beans. I added about 2 cups cooked and another 1.5 cups smashed (per a reviewers suggestion for a thicker base). I didn't add in the water that I cooked the beans in, so I just used one extra cup of chicken broth (which ended up being one full 32 oz carton). I also threw in some frozen white corn. 

I let everything simmer on low in my dutch oven and BOY! Was it was delicious!

Garnish with crushed tortilla chips, fresh cilantro and a dollop of sour cream!

Absolutely delicious. Don't let the jalapeno peppers intimidate you. I didn't get any heat from the peppers, other than that wonderful flavor. I did shred my chicken to accommodate my family.

After making this a second time, the spices are spot on, and again! I Thank You for sharing your recipe.

Please if you need to adjust the recipe for your family, than do so. But at least  ackowledge and thank the submitter
Of the recipe., or submit your own.

Delicious, spicy.  If you cut the jalapeño peppers yourself, protect your skin from contact.

My family doesn't like spicey, so I left out the jalepenos.  It was super delicious!  Going to make a double batch for Bunco this week! :)

We had this for dinner tonight.  We really like this version.  Because we cannot handle really spicey food, I omitted the jalapeno peppers, but added a 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes.  I also didn't have green onions, so I used one of my sweet onions from the garden.  Thats the only changes I made.   I will serve this for dinner again.  Thanks Nancy.

This Chili was gross and that is an understatement. The seasoning was not overpowering like some other people thought. To me it was to salty and it didn't look appetizing. It looked like the mush that is served to inmates. I was just trying something new but I wasted my $20 purchasing the ingredients for the meal. So pissed.

This was the best white chili I've ever had. The only thing I changed was I added green chilies instead of the jalapenos (those were on the side). I want to try this in the crock pot next time.

Absolutely delicious! Was worried that it would be too spicy so only put in 2 jalapenos and it wasn't overly spicy! Great flavor.

Good, not outsanding. Used 3 jalapenos and that was perfect for a medium-hot heat. Used 1 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1 tsp. salt which was definitely needed otherwise it was fairly bland. And I used only 1 can of beans. It was a nice dinner for a change, but I will probably not make it again. I served it with cornbread.

Wow, this is good stuff! It was a lot of chopping, but worth it. I made a double batch for my super bowl party, only used 4 jalapenos, 1 each red, yellow & green bell pepper. Was out of flour so i used cornstarch and chicken broth added to boiling chicken broth and butter to thicken. I also added 1/2 packet chichis taco seasoning for a little extra flavor.

Would not suggest this in the slow cooker as mentioned in the caption.  It was just so-so that way.  I imagine it is much better when done as read, to keep some substance to the bell peppers.  I like my vegetables to have more crunch than just mush.  Also, I used dried beans that I'd soaked overnight which I'd probably do again just because of the savings.  I like a lot of beans.  I used a few different kinds (great northern, navy, and garbanzo).

I add 1/4 tsp of ground clove, 1/2 tsp sweet basil, and  1/2 tsp oregano.  My recipe is just like this with no butter or oil or flour.  I make in crock pot.  I also use a 48 oz northern beans.  Pretty much the same recipe...but, try the extra spices...and I am not stingy with the cummin..I use 1 tsp.

This was a really good recipe!  It wasn't hot enough, so I might try leaving some of the jalapeno seeds or add one more.  Everyone that tried it thought it was really good!

This is really fantastic!  I added 1 cup frozen corn and 1/2 can of Rotel...and used poblano instead of jalepeno chiles.  Also, my second can of beans had to be the light reds (only had one can of the northern).  Very substantial dinner... kids and hubby loved it as well. To keep it a little less fattening,  I chose to put shredded cheese on top with a dollop of light sour cream as I served it.  It really was delicious!

Great Taste! I opted to use more jalapeno, and green chile's instead of red and yellow pepper. It gave it more of a Mexican flair. Cut some whole wheat flour tortilla's into strips and brown them. Put the soup over those add some cheese...yummy!!

Wow!  This was my first time making white chili and this recipe is truly tasty.  I followed the advice of another user and added a can of cream-style corn.  I think it gave it a nice, creamy texture and a nice sweetness.  I didn't use nearly as many jalapenos as it called for, since I'm a wimp, and I added some mushrooms that were about to go bad in my refridgerator.  Also, I used three cloves of garlic, on the advice of others.  Yummy supper and I can't wait to taste the leftovers for lunch.  I topped it with some jack cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and some chives.  Beautiful and delicious!

AMAZINGLY GOOD!My husband and I just made this one for dinner and it turned out fantastic. We followed the recipe in everything,only that we added a can of corn.Nice blend of flavours,great texture and perfect amount of 'spice'.A true keeper, although we will make it again during the winter (we adventured to prepare it in August because we're having a particularly fresh evening in the northwest of Spain today...).Thanks for posting this!

I don't use flour for thickening.. I added a cup or so of rice and it was FANTASTIC I also use a ton more bell peppers then it asks for.  For the chicken flavor i ALWAYS use Goya chicken bouillon.  Perfect if you follow my directions!

After all the preperation done to get this on the table I expected something much better.  I took one bit and couldn't touch any more.  My husband only at 1/2 a bowl, normally he will eat almost anything!  I think it was all the seasonings, just WAY to overpowering!

A friend of mine's Father use to make this, unfortunately he passed away before I could get the recipe from him.  Not only was this recipe delicious, but it also brought back some teenage memories of a man who could not only cook, but was an extrodinary person.

I first made this as written, and it was good.  After reading the reviews, I doubled the spices, and it was awesome. I also, instead of using flour to thicken, added a third can of drained, mashed beans.  Add a little more stock if it gets too thick.  One of our favorites!

The only thing I would change about this recipe next time would be to double it.  Very good!!  Everyone liked it, even those that don’t like peppers.

Huge hit at Super Bowl Party. Added some cayenne and a few red pepper flakes for a little more heat. Also puréed one of the cans of cannelloni beans for thicker consistency.

I found the original recipe to be too light weight and lacking in flavor.   I added 1 can of crème of celery and 1 can of crème of broccoli.  In addition I added steamed zucchini and onion and paprika and cumino and garlic salt instead of garlic.  These changes made it a hit!  Serve over skillet cornbread with cheese!

My whole family loves this chili! We change the recipe quite a bit, but it is good as it is written. I use both ground turkey and ground chicken, more peppers, more jalapenos,  more beans and I season the meat when browning it (cumin, garlic, salt and pepper). We top it with cilantro! Its easy to double and freezes well.

Great chili! I have made it many times for company and always gotten rave reviews. I love that you can tweak it to suit your own taste/what you have on hand and it always turns out great! I usually use canned jalapeño or small can of diced  fire roasted chiles.  A great tip for those that are trying to eliminate the butter/flour roux - I just add part of a package of instant mashed potatoes! Can't taste the potato at all and also makes the chili gluten free. I also use a yellow onion instead or green, add a can of corn, increase the cumin and garlic and I always drain the beans.  I highly recommend leaving in the sage and ginger - it's what makes this chili unique!

This is the best recipe for white chili that I've ever used. The roux really takes this to the next level. I omitted sage (didn't have any), and substituted Italian sausage for the chicken, omitted yellow pepper, added some jalapeno and cannellini beans, and garnished it with chopped tomato, cilantro, sweet onion, green onion, and a mix of Greek yogurt and sour cream.

I prefer a bit more broth, after simmering for awhile it got a bit too thick.  I doubled the liquid (chicken broth-roux mixture) and to avoid diluting flavor, I also doubled the seasoning.    Everyone loved it!

I’ve probably made this 5 or 6 times at least.  I love traditional chili, but we like to mix it up sometimes and go with a white chili.   This is perfect as-is so don’t feel you have to add or remove anything if you don’t want to experiment right out of the gate!   But, I do add an extra 1/2 tsp of cumin and I also add 1 1/2 tsp curry powder...that’s just a me thing.  Now, I also add thick cut bacon because...it’s bacon.

Left the beans out of the mix, added a bit more broth, and left in a good chunk of the jalapeno seeds making it nice and spicy. Finally, served it up with about a quarter of slice avacado and a sprinkling of colby jack cheese. Great recipe for some delicious white chicken chili!

I wanted to add a few things to my review but hit enter by mistake.  So anyway, I was trying not to make this chili so fattening also so I cut the chicken in large chunks and steamed it for only 5 minutes in water seasoned with salt and pepper. Not sure if it is me, or not, but sometimes when I sauté chicken, it can get too tough. Steaming it was quick, juicy and less fattening!  I used the water for my broth and added some condensed chicken broth.  I also shredded the chicken so it would absorb more flavor. I also felt it need more cumin so I used 1 and 1/2 tsps. I did not have sage, but wish I had thought of using dried cilantro, my husband would have liked that. I guess I have said enough for now.  Until the next recipe from Allrecipes.com.  My go to sight for all of my cooking needs!

This was great, boyfriend and I both loved this, it's a nice variation from the typical heavy beef chili (which I'm not a huge fan of). I like the green onions used insted of the regular. The different peppers are beautiful in the chili and the jalepenos are a MUST! They add such a great punch! Oh, and if you dig curry, add a SMIDGE of great real yellow curry powder to this, you'll LOVE it.

Chili was amazing! It was creamier than I had anticipated, it was a nice surprise. The only thing I changed was that I added 5 cloves of garlic.

I just won a chili cook off at work using this recipe!  Everybody loved it.  So easy and so good.  I used poultry seasoning instead of all the other spices.  I also used a white onion instead of the green onions and peruvian beans instead of the great northern beans.  Delicious!!!

We make it vegetarian by using tofu and veggie broth, and it's absolutely delicious.

Excellent recipe.  Not sure I would consider it to be 6 servings though as my husband and have fairly small appetites and can make 2 meals out of 1 batch  (more like 4 servings).  If you're using it as an appetizer or side dish then 6 may be accurate.  Regardless--delicious and satisfying!

My husband and I really enjoyed this hearty chili, adding black beans and serving large portions. My daughter also tried a teacup full, although my son shook his head 'no.' Any ideas of how to make this recipe more kid-friendly?

This was an excellent recipe! I also added one can of yellow corn. The only problem was that I spent the entire night nursing burns on my fingers from chopping jalapenos. Make sure you wear gloves when chopping those jalapenos!

I used this recipe as a guide. Made a few changes, I’d suggest making everything in one large pot. I didn’t make a roux but did add a few pinches of flour to thicken up. It was very good!!

MY HUBBY IS RAVING ABOUT THIS WHITE CHILI!!!!!  OUR LOCAL GROCERY MAKES SOME VERY LEAN POLISH SAUSAGE, I USED THAT INSTEAD OF THE CHICKEN.  bROWNED IT FIRST IN THE PAN AND DRAINED OFF ANY  EXCESS GREASE THEN JUST WENT ON WITH THE RECIPE AS CALLED FOR. HUBBY HAS SAID AT LEAST 50 TIMES HOW GREAT IT IS AND "PLEASE HOLD ON TO THE RECIPE!"  WE HAD IT FOR SUPPER LAST NIGHT AND JUST CLEANED UP THE LAST OF IT FOR LUNCH WITH SOME TOAST.  wONDERFUL RECIPE,  A REAL KEEPER,  THANK YOU!!!!

absolutely scrumptious!!  i altered according to other readers...  added 1 orange pepper, omitted ginger and sage, thus adding 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning and approx 4 tsp. ground cumin.  i also used 5 cans various beans, undrained -- 3 cannenelli and 2 navy beans.   My family loved it!!!   very tasty and easy!

I found this recipe to be very versatile. I'm a vegetarian and have made this recipe twice, once using a faux chicken and once just adding more veggies. It was great both times!

I made this for dinner using a vegetarian soy chicken substitute and veg. broth.  Served it with garlic bread.  Very yummy and nice to have a low-fat white chili option.

I have been looking for a white chicken chili recipe and will keep on looking because I didn't really care for this at all. The chicken broth roux flavor did not mesh well, and the recipe had spice but not depth of flavor, even after simmering longer than called for. Anyone making this should defintely use the pureed beans for thickening, and maybe even a can of creamed corn.

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE BUT THE BASE WASN'T AS MUCH AS I EXPECTED SO I DOUBLED THE FLOUR, BUTTER AND CHICKEN STOCK. I THINK I COULD HAVE EVEN TRIPlED IT. IT WAS AMAZING AND HAD TONS OF FLAVOR! WE LOVED IT!!

We went back and forth between giving this a 4 and a 5.  We added a lot of extra garlic and cumin to give it more of a chili taste.  A very good alternative to traditional chili.  I am sure we will make this a lot this football season.
