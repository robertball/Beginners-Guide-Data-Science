This was fantastic - the taste of the sauce was incredible.  The only issue I had was that the sauce did not thicken up past a watery consistency for me.  I had to use 2 tbsp of corn starch mixed with 2 tbsp of water, stirred in slowly, to get it to thicken up.  Just a heads up that you may want to have some corn starch on hand before you make this!

Alright, I totally played around with this recipe which is most likely great on it's own. My rendition: I braised chicken in chicken stock with my own mixture of hispanic seasonings (added brasing liquid to sauce). I used Poblano chili peppers, although I roast em, then remove seeds/skins. Also, I omitted the crm cheese & used Pepper jack cheese in chicken filling mix. Instead of using all that chili powder in sauce; I used 1tblsp + 1 tblsp of cumin and a small can of salsa verde. Only used 2C of chicken stock as sauce quantity seemed excessive. I had dry cocoa powder so used 1/4 tsp of that. Used immersion blender to puree the sauce after it simmered for awhile. My twist - stuffed peppers & then wrapped in softened corn tortillas. I baked in oven like enchiladas (lightly sauced with Chihauhau cheese on top. OMG, I mean, OMG! Cool way to overhaul your typical chicken enchiladas if you want to try it. Sorry for messing with the original post but...I wanted to play with this one.

Just great!  Easy to make and hard to forget, you will want this again and again.  The peppers I found were about 6 inches and that would have made 6 rather than the stated 4 peppers.  The recipe makes quite a bit of sauce so if you also find smaller peppers I would half the sauce.  And that sauce!!! Just delicious.  Next time I will cut down the pepper a little as I used red chili pepper and I could tell my guests thought it a little too hot. One other thing, I found the recipe a little confusing about the amount of chocolate, but I used 2 squares of Ghiradelli b/s choc which was 1 ounce and it was absolutely perfect.  Will make this again soon, thanks for a wonderul addition to the Mexican collection, Kevin!

Loved all the flavors. Fresh and lighter than restaurant  food. Made a ton of sauce!  Surprised how mild the Anaheims are...smokey flavor with a little kick.   Served with refried beans with meltled cheddar cheese.  Yum!!

I only had green bell peppers that needed to be used, but all of the rest of the ingredients.  I cooked some rice, mixed it with a little bit of the mole sauce recipe, tossed with the chicken and cheeses, stuffed the peppers.  Baked, then poured the sauce over top. Served with black beans.  MMM

Outstanding!  I never in a million years would have thought I could make authentic Mexican, but it turned out really good.  I was reluctant to add the chocolate, so I tried it without first.  Let me tell you, the chocolate makes the sauce.  It does not taste like chocolate, just authentic mole sauce.  I will use this recipe again.  The flavors blended beautifully with spanish rice and cheese dip and chips.

Kids loved the chicken and peppers.  Enchilada sauce was time consuming and not necessary.  Easy directions to follow.

Loved this recipe!  My husband thought it could be a little spicier LOL but I loved it.  The only problem I had was finding nice size Anaheim chili peppers.  I did have left over stuffing because my Anaheims were smaller so I did stuff two smaller red bell peppers from my garden as well.  The red bell peppers were good but the Anaheim had that extra flavor/spice.  I wouldn't change a thing except add a little black or red pepper for my husband.  I didn't find the sauce to be to runny like others - I think you just have to have the patience to let it thicken properly.  Anyway - we loved it!

Amazing recipe. Instead of cooking the chicken in a skillet I cooked the chicken in the oven for 40 minutes then shredded it after it cooled. After I marinated the shredded chicken in the taco seasoning and water for 3 hours.  It was exceptional.

Seriously. We ROLLED AROUND in this sauce. So delicious. We followed the recipe exactly...well, except for not having anaheim peppers...we just used regular bell peppers of varying colors, but honestly, so delicious and perfect for a cold December night. I might have used less chicken broth than intended, but it resulted in a beautiful, rich, deep sauce that would be delicious on dang near anything. This is DEFINITELY a keeper in the Kean household from this day forward...

This recipe is awesome, one of the best meals my husband & I have made.  Only thing we did differently was we used roasted poblano peppers cause the anaheim peppers were very small.  We just put the poblanos in the broiler for a few minutes till they startered to blister, cooled then stuffed.

The recipe is great, but I didn't use cream cheese. If you don't want to use the peppers listed here you can use two green peppers cut in half. If you don't want it as spicy cut down on the chili pepper or increase the chocolate or do both. Overall this is a great dinner and the sauce is amazing.

Our kids LOVED this... ages 3-15.  I halved the chili powder as our chili powder blend is very hot and with small kids, I didn't want it too spicy.  We took another reviewers suggestion and dipped corn tortillas in the sauce and wrapped the chilies in the corn tortillas.  We then put cheese on top and broiled it until the cheese melted.  We will make this again!  It was a good use of our abundance of anaheim chilies from the garden and the kids enjoyed stuffing the chilies.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was wonderful! I baked the chicken instead of frying it in oil to lighten it up. I also Made my own enchilada sauce (not a fan of chocolate based sauce). It was extremely easy to put together and the results were outstanding...will be playing with the filling just for some intereting variations (chili verde perhaps). Thanks for the recipe will be enjoying this one over and over!

Wow!  Great flavors!  I loved the mole sauce.  I used white cheddar cheese because it is what I had on hand.  Not sure how anyone can stuff that much stuffing into an anaheim pepper, so I split them open to stuff them.  The peppers needed to be roasted and not just boiled though.  They were not tender enough.  I roasted mine a bit before splitting them open, which gave them a nice brown skin!

Excellent dish. We loved everything about it. I will probably go with unsweetened chocolate next time and a little more spice in the sauce. For the kids I put the stuffing into con tortillas to make enchiladas and they loved them, already requesting it again.

Fabulous - even my two year old liked it.  My peppers were long but narrow, so I used 8 and still had some extra filling.

Simply wonderful. The sauce takes a lot of time, but it takes the dish from being a good recipe, to being a GREAT recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, only substituting red bell peppers for green. 
Your friends will be talking about this meal long after they have scraped the last bite.

I have made this 3 times and it is by far one of our favorite recipes. It is SO good! A few pointers:
1) I use shredded cooked chicken and just add the taco seasoning (without the water) straight to the chicken/cream cheese mixture. 
2) I recommend microwaving the cream cheese 30-45 seconds to soften it before mixing it with the chicken and cheese. 
3) The sauce definitely makes the recipe, but it makes a TON. I halve the recipe and usually still have a little left over. I never have bittersweet chocolate on hand and so use a combination of semi-sweet chocolate chips and cocoa powder instead. 
4) My anaheim peppers are usually long and skinny, making them very difficult to stuff. I usually cut them in half long ways and just fill them open-face style. Rather than pre-cooking the pepper beforehand, I cover the dish in foil and cook for 20-25 minutes. This heats the chicken mixture all the way through and also cooks the peppers. You can finish it under the broiler if you want to crisp it up a little.

Amazing, but you need way less chicken broth. I made this twice... once following directions and once adding less broth. Tastes best with anaheim peppers, but can make with bell peppers

Fantastic!  The sauce tastes like mole sauce which is one of my favs!  I couldn't find Annaheim peppers so I used Poblanos instead.  The only other change was that I baked the chicken (covered and baked @ 400 for about 25 to 30 min.) in the taco marinade to save some time while I was preparing the reminder of the dish.

These were so delicious.  Served to the adults at my sons 11th b-day party.   We had left over stuffing (peppers in ID must be little) so I used the stuffing the next day to make chicken enchiladas with flour tortillas.  They were the best.  Am definitely making again-both ways.  YUMMMMMMY!!

I have made this several times, and I'm making it tonight.  I would make it more often, but there is nowhere locally that has a very good pepper selection.  Tonights version is going to be with poblano peppers.

Wowza.   Excellent.  Used roasted chx I already had- added some taco seasoning.  used 1/2 amount of chili powder & about 1/2 chx broth & that seemed to be perfect for us.  Kids even loved it.  Tastes like fancy restaurant stuff & wasn't hard to make.

Great recipe and easy preparation. Take the additional time to roast and peel the peppers, it will make the peppers much more palatable.

Phenomenal! I liked this so much better than I even thought I would. I'll never be able to use canned enchilada sauce again. :) I used Better Than Bouillon rather than chicken stock, and used corn starch instead of flour and the sauce was perfect. Everything about this was just wonderful. Thank you so much for sharing your creation.

This is totally worth the time and all of the dirty dishes. Let the sauce reduce for a while, it becomes like velvet. The only change I made was to use 6 big poblanos instead of the Anaheim. Seriously, this is a 6 or 7 star recipe. Just go make it already!

Excellent! I had reservations when I saw packaged taco seasoning as one of the ingredients, but boy was I wrong.  It was  delish!  A little labor intensive, but well worth it and will probably become easier the next time.  I reduced the garlic only because it seemed like too much, but this recipe is a keeper.

I made this for dinner last night for my husband and I.  I did not have plain cream cheese so used the weight watcher's chive I had on hand.  It was amazing!  I did end up with more sauce than chicken and peppers but will use it for something else.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!
