Made as written and these turned out good. The one thing I didn't like was that the asparagus got overdone in 25 minutes. It was overdone at 20 minutes when I checked too but the bacon wasn't nearly brown enough in 20 minutes.  Next time I will pre-cook the bacon some before assembling the bundles.

I made these for the family and they loved it. I followed the directions without making any changes. I will definitely make this again.

Even though I had pretty thin bacon, I slightly cooked it in a cast iron skillet  before I wrapped the asparagus. I removed the pan from the heat, then added the EVOO to the drippings with the garlic and parsley to let them mingle.  Returned the wrapped asparagus to the pan and into the oven. After 25 minutes the bacon was still mostly limp and the asparagus was getting done, so I hit the broiler for a few minutes till crispy. So, for my oven, cook the bacon half way. Was pretty good otherwise.
