Need to comment on this because this is my recipe.  When they edited it, they didn't tell you to add the cheese to the mixture after you add the ground beef. Also, those are not the times i put.  If you are making mini-muffins: cook 17-20 minutes.  If you are making full size muffins cook 25 - 30 minutes.  These muffins don't rise when baking so fill up the  cup. You can always spice these up with some hot peppers and spicy cheese.  I hope you all enjoy these as much as my family does!

I've used this recipe for years. I usually make mini muffins, 425 for 15 to 18 min. I put half of them in the freezer for later. They're not dry at all. You just have to make sure to put cooking spray on the pan.

This simply did not go well at all. We just didn't really enjoy them and they stuck to the muffin papers really bad even after being sprayed.

These are tough for me to rate, as they were really dry (Mr. LTH even commented on how dry they were, which is rare).  They had a nice flavor, but I think they'd be better w/more meat or perhaps the meat cooked in the muffin to add a little moisture.  That being said, I DO think these would be a hit w/kiddos and are quick and easy to throw together.  They took close to 30 minutes in our oven to be set.   THANKS for the recipe (and for the review update; I DID forget the cheese when I was reading directions, even though I'd ready your review...I was able to simply pull the mixture and mix it in before I baked them).

I made the recipe exactly as indicated with the recipe-owner’s modifications even.  But, my family and I did not like this recipe.  They were dry and quite bland. Cooking time should be modified to less than 30 mins otherwise they come out burnt on the bottom. Won’t be making these again.  We threw away most of the muffins.

These are really brilliant. I 1/2 the recipe & ended up doing more mustard than ketchup, the recipe 1/2 called for 1/4 cup & 2 tbsps ketchup I did 1/4 cup mustard & 2 tbsps ketchup. I'd have done a bit more ketchup but I like mustard better & all I had was a couple ketchup packets, I gotta get ketchup just for this recipe. Then it called for 1/2 a tsp  mustard, I did 1/2 tsp hot sauce. Everything else was how the recipe called for it. I can see how they would taste like sliders if I had put enough ketchup in. Next time I make this I will have to put a bit less mustard & more ketchup, I put too much mustard for even my taste, they're still really good, but had me wanting to put ketchup on top of them. Next time I will also put a can or 2 of jalepenos. We love jalepeno cheese burgers & that would be the perfect addition to these, although if I put in jalepenos I might have to keep the ketchup as I did it the first time, Im not big on ketchup, especially not with jalepeno cheese burgers. This is a great base recipe! & first time I've ever heard of such a thing. I look forward to messing around with extra ingredients to zaz it up. I give this 5 stars before any of my alterations. Oh & I almost forgot to write in, I read the review about them being dry, I didn't have any problem with that.
