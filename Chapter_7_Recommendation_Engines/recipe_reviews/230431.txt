Great way to use up left-over ham, and to incorporate more spinach into our diet.  I didn't have any red bell peppers on hand so I just left them out… still delicious, but I think it would have been even better with the peppers.  Other than no peppers, I followed the recipe exactly, but I did have to cook it a lot longer than 7 to 10 minutes to get the center set.  After cooking for 16 minutes on the stove-top the center was still not set, even though the edges (and bottom) were nice and brown.  I would have turned up the flame, but didn't want to burn the bottom, so I just transferred the skillet to the oven and broiled it for 3 minutes, on the top rack, set as close as possible to the heating element, and that finished it nicely.  Cooled for 5 minutes before slicing to allow the whole thing to firm up a bit.  I'm wondering if I didn't get the spinach dry enough, or maybe my skillet was smaller than the ones everyone else used, making the frittata thicker (a little over an inch thick in the center)…  in any case, it came out great, so try finishing under the broiler if yours seems to be taking too long to cook.

Pretty tasty although with the ham already being salty I found it a bit too salty so would probably either not add any additional salt or maybe just half. I'm trying to get my 12 month old to eat more spinach and eggs and she ate a bit of it! I added 2 more eggs as I found it quite spinach dense with only 3. A tasty dish, even better with salsa on top!

My family and I really enoyed this recipe.  I did modify it a bit by : omitting the ham, subing cream cheese for the feta, cheddar instead of mozerella, fresh spinach, cipollini onions, and butter instead of oil. Had to make due with what I had on hand... ;) I doubled the recipe for 4 kids and 2 adults and although we were very full, we all wished for seconds.

Really enjoyed this frittata. Used fresh spinach and lots of it, so had to increase the eggs to 5. We cut the ham into the tiniest pieces. Thanks Stephylouwhoo! This is a keeper.

Very tasty. But it should go into the oven to finish cooking. This will prevent the burned bottom problem. The way a frittata is cooked is what sets it apart from an omelet or other similar dishes. To make a frittata, the eggs are cooked on the stove in a hot skillet, along with the fillings, for a few minutes until the outer edges are set. Then the pan is transferred to the oven where the eggs finish cooking.  I cooked mine on the stove until I saw the edges firm and then transferred it to an oven at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes.  It came out perfect with no burned bottom. Would definitely recommend this to others.

I had a bunch of leftover veggies: an orange bell pepper, fresh baby spinach, some sliced mushrooms, green onions, half a red Spanish onion, and some fresh cilantro. I added all of them and increased my egg mixture to six eggs and a cup of milk. Since I had some frozen pepper jack cheese, I used that instead of the mozzarella and feta. It was delicious! I cooked it in a deep cast iron skillet. I did finish it off under the broiler, but my top got a bit too brown, so next time I’ll bake it at 350 instead, just to finish setting the eggs.

Excellent and quick to whip up. I substituted Jack cheese, prosciutto, and jalapeños for the spinach. My husband loved it!

This was wonderful! I changed up the ingredients a bit - fresh spinach, red onion, broccoli, sun-dried tomato, garlic, salt, pepper & zaatar spice but still used 3 eggs to keep it light.  This was my first time finishing a frittata on the stove-top as opposed to the oven.  Love love love the technique!

Heed the instructions to thaw the spinach. I didn't, and I think that's why the bottom burned before the middle set. Read and heed! Otherwise, a good recipe: easy, tasty, nutritious, and makes a good quick supper.

Made News Years Morning for the wife and I. Came out great only variation was added little poultry seasoning to the egg mixture. A little tip I got years ago that makes eggs taste that much better. Definitely would use a medium size pan not large when making again.

Came out very tasty. I left out the ham (didn’t have any), so came out vegetarian, also skipped mozzarella and added mushrooms instead for a healthier twist.

Perfect Saturday night supper for me and the hubs! I took advice from others and finished off in the oven: 400 degrees for 5 minutes to set it up then sprinkled some mozzarella on top and browned it under the broiler for about a minute. Yum!

I made this with a few changes: fresh spinach, mini sweet red peppers, and added a few zucchini slices.  Yummy!  Great summer veggie and protein breakfast.

Recipe is a very good base. You can add different things, like mushrooms, but make sure whatever you add is cooked before hand so there isn't extra water. I used precooked ham out of a package. If you do that don't add extra salt because it will be too salty like mine was.

This was pretty good—I had to make some changes  based on what I had available. I used turkey bacon instead of ham and a mix of cheddar/Swiss cheeses. I like that the whole recipe is made on the stovetop so I didn’t have to turn on the oven. The only change I would make is to add another egg—the end product was VERY veggie heavy and not so much like a frittata.

Delicious! I had ham leftovers, so I chopped it up and used softened cream cheese and omitted the milk,and used provolone cheese and chedder. I used a salt free seasoning mix,and 1/4 teaspoon of salt because the ham is salty enough as is.I slinkled parmesan cheese on top.I didn't have a big enough lid for my skillet,so I let the eges cook until firm on the stove,and placed the frittata in the oven at 375 for 10 minutes. Next time I make this dish I will be adding some fresh ground nutmeg before cooking,as nutmeg and spinach are a marriage made in heaven. I will make this again for sure!

This was very good, but salty (and I omitted the ham...imagine if I hadn't...).  I used fresh spinach and added about a tablespoon of fresh basil.   Next time I'll omit the salt and use the shaker at the table, if needed.  Very nice--and quick!

Great idea but not enough eggs to make it a true frittata.  The bottom of mine burned while the eggs were cooking.

Loved it! Don't like feta so I substituted freshly grated Parmesan. Used about 4 ounces of fresh baby spinach in lieu of the frozen. Used Orange bell pepper, and turkey ham.  I typically make an egg bake that takes about an hour in the oven. I like the fact that this can be made quickly. Tastes great - even husband raved! Definitely going into my weekend breakfast/brunch rotation! Thanks for sharing!

Decent.  Mixing the cheese into it was a mistake as it burnt the bottom of my pan. I gave it 3 stars because I added some garlic powder, onion powder and paprika to spice it up a bit since it was bland otherwise. It deserves more like 3.5 stars.

We really loved this.  Such a nice blend of flavors.  I used fresh baby spinach and will make it again tonight with Canadian bacon.  I used the three eggs and was able to completely cook this on the stovetop, watching it carefully.  It came out perfect. This is my favorite frittata ever!

Made this with bacon instead of ham and fresh spinach instead of frozen. Also substituted green bell pepper for red bell pepper. Tossed some sun-dried tomatoes on the top and baked it in a casserole dish at 400 for 30 minutes instead of in a skillet. Came out delicious! We will make this again!

I doubled the eggs and milk and that helped. I would also suggest this be baked in the oven, not in a skillet on the stove. The bottom of the frittata burned. May try it again changing the amounts of the ingredients and cooking in the oven.

Needed a quick and easy dinner idea. By the time I was finished using up leftovers I had to cook this in the oven as it was pretty thick. I followed the directions but I added a few things.  6 eggs, a diced tomato, cup of cottage cheese, a bit of cheddar. A little hit of cayenne pepper. A dash of herbs de provence. Baked at 350 for about 15 minutes. So delicious. Tasted even better the second day for breakfast.

This was an easy and delicious way to use up some extra veggies, although rather than cooking them in the skillet, I poured the mixture into a muffin pan to make mini single serving frittatas. I will definitely be making this again!

I liked this, my family did not. I added old bay seasoning along with the salt and pepper. Had green pepper sauteed with the onion, then added eggs and spinach and cheese (used mozzarella). Yummy.
