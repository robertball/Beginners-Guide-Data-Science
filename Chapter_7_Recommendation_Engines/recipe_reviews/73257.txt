I used pre-cooked grilled chicken strips and just used plain honey mustard dressing, and I REALLY liked it.  It was super easy and MUCh tastier than my normal boring vegetable salads!

I think you can make it more 'authentic' as far as making it a Tandoori chicken with the following:

Add some tandoori masala (dry or paste) in the marinating process, and remove the honey mustard. Just marinate with yogurt, spices, a little bit of oil.

I am new to Indian-style cooking, so I can't comment on the authenticity.  I followed the recipe very closely, until assembly.  The marinade is wonderfully fragrant, and the finished chicken would be delicious on its own.  The sweet taste of pineapple and raisins added to the overall exotic quality of the salad.  The dressing is a perked-up version of honey mustard.  I didn't toss everything together as the submitter suggested, and I'm glad I didn't, because now I have some extra of that yummy dressing.  DH has said that he doesn't care for curry, but he certainly scarfed this salad down, as I did.  Thanks for the idea!

I made this using the "honey mustard dressing II" recipe from this site, and used a Tandoori spice blend that I found at the store rather than Garam Masala. I used plain yogurt that I had on hand, but I will try with mango yogurt next time as per the recipe. The mixture of flavors is perfect! This will become a household regular!.

Made my own dressing using Dijon mustard, other than that this is incredible as written.

Ah jeez! I just realized I forgot to serve this with the mint and lemon wedges.  I got rushed to put it on the table tonight and just forgot about the garnishes.  I'm not sure about the honey mustard dressing. I bought honey mustard dipping sauce because I couldn't find anything labeled "dressing". My version turned out really thick so I added some oil before refrigerating and then just before serving, it was really REALLY thick so added some water.  But not sure if it was the type of greens I had (spring mix) or what but the dressing really weighed the greens down and they wilted under the dressing.  However having said that, it tasted WONDERFUL!  I will absolutely make this again and see if I can find the proper honey mustard dressing or make my own.  And maybe use a hardier green like romaine. Hubby actually came close to saying he felt like there was a party in his mouth, that's how much he loved it. Very very flavorful. Thanks for posting this awesome recipe.
