i am a pro baker, have been making this recipe for years. i think they are the best,now a few tips. after you have made them a couple of times, try winging it by feel. you want your dough to feel like a wet sponge, the wetter the more tender. these can either be dropped or cut, if you are cutting,use a.p. flour to roll them out, the self will absorb and change you ratio and become tough. you also can add some chedder cheese, better than red lobsters. another trick add a little sugar and cinnamon, brush top with egg wash sprinkle with sugar, these make great short cakes, when filled with fresh fruit. use these as ideas for other things you can add to these great biscuts,bacondebaker

Easy and YUM!!!!!!!!!!!! These biscuits are awesome.  I did make a substitution, only for health... I don't use heavy cream, so I used nonfat plain yogurt.  These biscuits are just so easy and delicious that I can't get over it.  Oh, I didn't knead/roll, I just dropped them and they came up marvelous.

I made these for Easter dinner, and have made them several times since then. I found the original directions to yield a VERY dry dough, so the second time I started with a 1 cup flour to 1 cup cream ration and added more flour until I had a consistency that was not too sticky but not crumbly. I used my stand mixer with the dough hook. I made them both rolled and cut and as drop biscuits, and we thought they were flufflier and more tender as drop biscuits, probably because the dough was handled less and could be a little wetter and looser. I recommend these highly - easy and delicious.

I admit, I was very skeptical when I saw only 2 ingredients. Thankfully, these are delicious! Very tender. I halved the recipe & it took extra liquid. I did not knead them for the 5 mins. listed. I had always read that you shouldn't over work biscuit dough. I only kneaded mine about 5 times. I will definatley be making these again!

Absolutely the best biscuit recipe ever, and I have searching for the longest time.  I didn't have a biscuit cutter, so I just used a floured drinking glass.  Worked out fantastic. This biscuit recipe will be my one and only. The only thing I will change is to cut in 1/4 cup of butter flavored crisco to the flour before adding the cream. Makes for very tender flaky biscuits that dont dry out the next day.

These biscuits are VERY good. So EZ. Thought I'd be giving a negative review when I was rolling them out. Figured they be tough as hockey pucks but sure surprised me! Yummy! I did add a bit of sugar and they did need more cream. Also only kneaded the dough to get it blended (30 seconds?). Def making again since I doubt there will be any left for breakfast! Thanks for the quick and easy AND tasty recipe >

Wow. These were great. Good taste and good texture. If you like your biscuits sweet, add a tbsp of sugar, but I don't think they need it. Also, mine needed about a tbsp more cream to make it moist enough. Thanks for sharing!

Five stars for easy! I love this recipe. Great results and only two ingredients. Definitely a keeper. Interestingly, I had to add a little flour to my dough to get it stiff enough to use. I guess it depends on your work surface and perhaps the kitchen's humidity. As they say, Your Mileage May Vary.

I've made my share of homemade biscuits, but I will never use another biscuit recipe ever again.  I haven't tried it yet, but I think this would also be good with sugar for strawberry shortcake.

These are quick and easy, so I give them four stars. They turned out pretty flat, but they taste was fine. I had to add a little more cream to the mixture. I just rolled them out and cut them out with a glass.

Easiest recipe ever! So I didn't have heavy cream, but I had fat free half and half....it worked! I used 1 cup self rising flour and 3/4 c fat free half and half...mixed together (didn't even take out of the large measuring cup!) I didn't roll out the dough or anything, just made them like drop cookies, but pushed the dough down a little.  I baked them about 6-8 min at 450.  (this made 9 small biscuits)

If I could rate this recipe more than 5 stars, I would do. Actually, this is the first bread (biscuit) recipe that its result becomes exactly as I wished it to be!
It is so delicious. Many thanks for the recipe, Diane. You made my day :)

This biscuit recipe is quick, easy and delicious. Today I used my left over Christmas turkey to make creamed turkey and biscuits. I made the biscuits according to the recipe and found it to be light tasting and very good with the creamed turkey. I will be keeping this biscuit recipe handy for future recipes.

I REALLY wanted to like this recipe but most of us didn't care for these.  They were bland & I'd only make them again if I was slathering them with some sausage gravy or something.  My brother, on the other hand, really liked them so I'm giving them 2 stars.  Thanks anyway.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out tough. They were more the texture of a roll with the flavor of a bland biscuit. They should only be mixed enough to hold together, which shouldn't take anywhere near 5 min. They would also benefit from a little butter. They were still edible, but I'd never call them biscuits.

rated 5 for simplicity, can't get much easier, did have to add more cream. Also dropped them instead of rolling out. I agree with the post about these would be wonderful for strawberry shortcake. Would probably add a little sugar next time too, or use the honey like another post to sweeten them a bit.

I first made these for Thanksgiving and my son, who is a huge biscuit/roll fan, kept swiping them!  They are pretty good, too, and I like the fact that I don't have to use shortening and they are VERY easy to make!

I have made much more complex things than this that turned out perfectly but this was a big disappointment. They came out flavorless and dry like a cracker. Never again. Waste of perfectly good heavy cream.

Perfect biscuits every time.  My grandma taught me how to laboriously make biscuits when I was 10.  She'd be head over heels with this recipe.  
.
I did not have heavy cream this evening when I started to make them, so I used 3/4 c. milk with 1/3 c. melted butter as a substitute.  The biscuits were flaky and moist, and actually came out even better than with heavy cream.    Thanks Diane for making biscuit baking a breeze!

Quick is the right word, but they are also VERY GOOD.  These are the easiest biscuits I've ever made and I love that you can roll or drop them. Thanks Diane Hixon....You did good. :)

Fast and easy to make.  Recommend you add more heavy cream than the recipe calls for.  Add a little bit at a time while you are mixing so your dough will not be so dry because your going to be adding extra flour as you roll out your dough anyway.  I added sharp cheddar cheese, yummy.

I really want to give this recipe 5 stars just for the fact that it only takes TWO ingredients and is the easiest biscuit recipe I've ever tried. Unfortunately, the biscuits just aren't as good as I had hoped they would be.  They were good but not 5 star good.  I did have to add about 1/3 cup more cream, too.  Still a good recipe when you're in a hurry! :)

My homemade biscuit attempts over the years have usually resulted in substitutes for hockey pucks---not these!  Very tender.  I added a tsp of sugar and a little extra cream as it seemed too dry, also kneaded only five or six times.  Very good.

So easy and so good. Need to add a little more cream so they don't fall apart when you cut them.

Fantastic recipe! So quick, so easy, sooooo gooooood!! I didn't have any self-rising flour so I used all-purpose with a bit of baking powder and salt. They turned out perfect! Thank you so much for the recipe, Diane! :9

5 stars for super-easy. I'm so glad the above reviewer posted that it she thought she was going to give it a bad review because if I hadn't read it I would have thrown the dough away without cooking it. Tasted very good (not as good  as my normal recipe but I will def. be using it again!!) It's just too easy for a good week-night meal.

I tried these last night and while it was easy... they were also dry. I had to butter the tops and bottoms and eventually the insides.  . . .   I recommend following the advice of another reviewer to cut in either crisco (or margerine). Also, while I wanted to follow the recipe to the letter this time, I think next time I will add some sharp cheddar cheese to the mix.  . . .   DO NOT over knead the dough!!! It was like a bunch of little continents when I mixed it together, as the dough was seperated. I did manage to flatten it out by hand and then, with some margerine on the 1 cup measuring cup rim, cut each biscuit out. This made about 7-8 bicuits only. Double the recipe if you have a large crowd. . .   I did cook for more likely 12-15 minutes because when they were cooking, they were still white and I wasn't sure if they were done. . . .   I recommend instead, following the 8 - 10 minute advice, but have a "scrap" biscuit for testing. . .   These were tasty, but they lacked just a hair in flavor (until butter added) and very extremely dry. I will attempt next time to add just a (1/2 cup?) hair more cream than advised.

I made these for breakfast and they turned out perfectly!  I didn't have heavy cream on hand, so I combined 3/4 cup milk with 1/4 cup butter, stirring for 2 minutes and used that instead.  I ended up needing a little more than the 1 cup the recipe called for, but they were awesome!  Normally, I am terrible at cooking biscuits, but these turned out great!  The only thing was that mine didn't brown on top, not sure why but I am assuming I should have buttered the top???  Anyway, great recipe!  Thanks!

These are awesome. I am not a biscuit expert/snob by any means so I'm pretty easy to please, but for me this will be the only recipe I ever use. I mix and drop mine, no rolling/kneading, and in my environment I always need to add more cream. The user review about wanting the dough to feel like a wet sponge guides me to perfect results everytime. I used to "make" those pouches you just add water to but this is almost as easy and much more wholesome. Thank you so much for submitting this staple recipe :)

I have never made biscuits before and to be honest I was sure I would fail at making these. I was so happy when it did work and they tasted great! I don't eat KFC anymore because I think it is digusting, but I always loved their biscuits and these reminded me of KFC's. I served them with 2 kinds of jams and butter. They were gone in minutes. Be careful not to over work the dough, which I am pretty sure I did because I think they could have turned out prettier.

Definitely a keeper!  I didn't have quite enough heavy cream so I added a little sour cream.  Came out light and fluffy.  I used these with the Sausage Gravy III gravy recipe on this site.

I just made these(at 1 A.M.!!) and they're very good but I think next time I'll add a bit of cheddar cheese or herbs to add a bit of flavor to it. I made the recipe with the flour substitution AND evaporated milk instead of heavy cream(as stated on this website as being a substitution for it) and worked out nice!! Will be doing this again!   P.S. I cut and rolled the dough with a tall drinking glass(my grandmother used to do this): about half of an inch and the size and thickness was perfect(exactly like the picture).

Its hard to believe that with such few ingredients that these biscuits could be soooo good!  These are super easy and fast to get on the table!  I make them in my food processor.  I put the dry ingredients in with the dough blade and then turn it on the dough setting.  I pour the cream in as fast as the dry mix will incorporate it.  Once the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl and forms a ball I let it run for 30 seconds.  Then I turn it out onto a cutting board, roll it into a log shape, and slice into biscuits and bake acording to the recipe.  No kneading, no cutting.  I will be baking them often this winter with soups, stews, and slow cooked meals.  Thanks for a great recipe!

the biscuits are not bad at all, but they end up being the most popular recipe around because of the fastness, easiness and simplicity of the whole process. Unexpected guests? last minute whim? no bread anywhere? here you go! I tried plain, with parmesan, with rosemary, onion, parsley, you name it... always good!

These are SO easy and SO good.  Only problem - eating too many.  I find the best way to make these it to keep it simple, I don't kneed the dough - just drop by the spoonfuls after stiring... mmm mmm mmm.  PS - I have used a napkin ring (a metal one) to cut biscuits when I do roll them - especially good for kids size...

I love how easy this is. I did not knead for 5 mins and since I only had all-purpose flour I had to add salt and powder. The dough was a bit dry so i added another tbsp of cream. But I was not precise when measuring my flour so I could have added too much flour. They tasted great, especially with butter and honey. This is my new biscuit recipe. Thanks!

These are fantastic! Took 10 minutes to prepare and they came out perfect. Light and fluffy. I used all-purpose flour and so added the baking soda and salt. I didn't knead for 5 minutes. With just the cup of cream it was still a really dry mixture so I added just a dollop of milk and they worked out perfectly. My husband couldn't believe that all it was was flour and cream. We used the little leftover dough for hot dog wraps and veggie purses to be eaten later. I will definitely be making these babies again!

I made these today.  Like others have said "a little dry mixture" had to add more cream.   Made them again using 1 1/2 c sr rising and 1 c cream. Then I dropped and shaped a little -- OMG--they were awesome!!!  I spread with a little softened butter before baking.  Gave them a nice light salty taste and browned better.  Baked 12 min. Next time gonna add some grated chedder cheese.  Red Lobster won't have anything on us anymore!   Absoluted love the recipe!!!  Thank-you!!!

After searching and trying several biscuit recipes, this is the one I've decided to keep and make again.  I did need a splash more cream but everyone seemed to like these.  I did mine as drop biscuits but patted them into a patty shape by hand because I think the batter would be too sticky to roll.

I'm pleasantly surprised by how these turned out. I didn't have self-rising flour so followed the notes to use regular flour and added baking powder and salt. I followed the advice given by some of you to add in butter flavored crisco (1/4 cup) and it turned out fantastic! I made this with the "Super Sausage Gravy" recipe also found on this site. mMmmm!

I just made these biscuits this morning. I hadn't made biscuits from scratch in a long time, and I needed a refresher on ingredients and method.  I have to say, this recipe was wonderful! The biscuits came out perfect and my family just LOVED them. I did have to make a few changes due to lack of heavy cream. I used 1 cup of 2% milk and added 1/4 cup of sour cream as well.   I mixed everything by hand till it came together then dropped them onto the pan and brushed the tops with some melted butter before baking. They browned beautifully!  I will be making these biscuits again!!

These were great! I used 1 cup of self rising flour and 1 cup of dry oatmeal grated in the blender. When I turned it onto a floured surface I had to add a little more self rising flour so it wouldn't be too sticky and also added 1/4 tsp of baking powder and they were so good. I'll keep playing with it to make them healthier. Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe!  I used these for the chicken and dumplings I made.  It was just as easy as using a pre-made mix, but without any unwanted ingredients! Will definitely make again.

It never occurred to me that heavy cream could be used as a fat but thank goodness someone else thought of it! These are the best biscuits I've ever had. Mine did not turn out particularly light but that is more than ok with me as I like a dense biscuit. These are absolutely delicious.

I love this recipe! It takes hardly any time at all. I read the reviews and decided to add cheese to the mix; yummy. You will need to add extra liquid. I used cream this time but think I will use melted butter next time and buttermilk instead of cream. I do so love a buttery bisquit!!

These were really easy to make, first time I ever made biscuits and they turned out really good. Nothing beats moms though. I added a slice of butter to each before baking and it made them more tasty. These are perfect with sausage gravy and would be good with fried chicken too !

This recipe has been around since the dawn of Self-Rising Flour... My Mom and Grandmother both used it.  I use 1 1/2 cups of liquid for 2 cups of flour.  They turn out perfect!

Great recipe! I was sceptical to start with. After all, using no oil sounded "scary". I used buttermilk with 2 tbls. sugar..Mixed with my hand until nice and creamy and soft, then hand rolled them, just like my grandmother use to do.They were delicious. Tasted like a mix between a roll and a biscuit. Thanks for sharing such a wonderfully easy recipe. This will be the recipe that I use from now on.

Excellent, fast recipe. Didn't have enough of heavy cream, so I used whatever cream I had on hand and did the remaining amount with buttermilk. Did need to add a bit more of the buttermilk, since the dough wasn't soft and pliable. Biscuits turned out very good and everyone enjoyed them.

****UPDATE**** I tried these again as with all the rave reviews I thought I'd give these a second chance. Yeah, even though I said I wouldn't, lol. The dough was really dry and I had to add another couple of T of cream to get all the flour worked in just to get it to form a ball. I had to use my hands to mix it as the dough was too thick for a wooden spoon. I didn't knead these they were too dry already so I just patted it into a rectangle about 1/2 in thick and cut out 15 tea sized biscuits. I'll have to admit they came out fine this time and even my hubby commented how he really liked these biscuits. The biscuit was tender and not dry at all inside after baking. I thought it needed some more flavor, but overall I was pleased with the results this time around. I'm glad I tried these again.
ORIGINAL REVIEW: Sounded too good to be true, and it was. These were okay, but dense, and they were really easy, but I wasn't impressed and won't bother making them again. Thanks anyway for letting me try.

Extremely easy and taste good, I think it would be a bit better with some butter basted on or some cheese baked in... but these are amazing considering it takes 15 minutes to make (including the baking).

Easy. Delicious and sweetness is just right.I actually change the ratio to 1:1. It's simpler. Made this for the kids to bring to school and they love it with some chocolate/ peanut butter dippings. I love them with strawberry jam. Definitely a keeper. Thanks

I was worried about the flavor of these biscuits, but they are very good. I have never made or had biscuits made without shortning, so I too was very skeptical. Very easy to make, even though a little hard to mix. I made no adjustments to the recipe, but I could see that adding a little more cream could be beneficial.

This is a really easy recipe for those who are beginners like myself.  I only kneaded the dough 5 times and not 5 minutes.  I think that may have been a typo.  Read through the reviews and you'll find some helpful tips and slight changes to the recipe even better.

My biscuits turned out pretty plain - then again there were only 2 ingredients. Next time I will add butter to them and perhaps some cheese. Great starter recipe!

I took other reviewers tips and used enough heavy cream to give the dough a "wet sponge" feel. It was over the 1 cup the recipe called for. After 8 minutes I brushed the tops with butter & let cook an additional 4-5 minutes. I ended up with the lightest, fluffiest biscuit's I have ever baked and a very, VERY happy DH!

I can't believe how unbelievable these biscuits were -- no need to look any further!  I brushed the baking sheet with melted butter before baking the biscuits, and brushed the tops of the biscuits with melted butter as they came out of the oven. These remind me of the KFC biscuits minus the artificial ingredients.

Ok so I made these one other time and they were way bad. So I went back and looked at the recipe, thought I might have looked over something, sure enough I didnt read the footnotes. I didnt use the baking powder it called for if you using all purpose flour. After I remade them it was a differnt story than the first time. So so easy I will for sure make these again!!!

I thought they were good, but not excellent.  I am just not good at making biscuits though.  Frozen Mary B are as good or better in my opinion, and a lot less trouble.  But this recipe is one of the easier ones if you need to make them from scratch.

This is a great, quick and easy recipe! Everyone really liked them and I loved how simple it was to prepare. I had to use a bit more cream then called for in the recipe and made them as drop biscuits since the dough is quite sticky. It isn't as flavorful as regular baking powder biscuits but the next time I need a really QUICK quick bread I'll be using this recipe.

Extremely easy, very basic recipe which will be easy to adapt for different meals.  Like a few others, I had to use a bit more cream than the recipe called for.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour (which is all I had in the cupboard) and they turned out great!

This is a good bisciut. As the other reviewers stated,1 c. is not enough cream. The cream amount should be closer to equal parts flour/cream. They are also a bit bland. Maybe some butter, sugar, or butter crisco? Don't know... I did really like the rise and consistency of the biscuit.

Wonderful! Glad you added the tip about adding baking powder & salt if self-rising isn't on hand. Thought I had some and didn't. Made these today for tomorrow's breakfast on a road trip, so I used another's suggestion of cutting in some butter Crisco to keep them from drying out. But I sampled them with the sausage gravy I made to take, and it is some kind of GOOD!!! Way better than the canned stuff!!!

Aha! At last the secret to my grandmother-in-law's biscuit recipe! She told me she only used flour and cream but it wasn't until I saw it here that I realized that I needed SELF-RISING flour. My husband is a happy man;) Once you've made it a few times, this recipe isn't much more difficult than opening a can from the grocery store. Now you can say it's homemade!

Wow! I was skeptical, but very pleasantly surprised with the ease and taste of these biscuits. I have been searching for a long time for a soft, fluffy biscuit recipe. These are the softest and best I've ever had! Thank you so much for sharing!

It's just not possible for something to be this easy and tasty. Didn't change a thing...but I didn't remove when I turned off the oven so they were a bit more crispy/dried out than I would have liked. I also halved the recipe which was a no-no because they were gone too fast. Thanks for a quick, easy and tasty recipe. Will make again and again.

Diane Hixon, you're my hero. These biscuits have made my life and budget so much simpler. My husband is a bread fanatic and we just don't have Bisquick or instant biscuits where I live, THANKS!!!
I made this as a bread topping as is for a casserole and also to accompany soup- just added some sauteed onion and cheese for variety.

This is the first time I ever tried making biscuits like these and frankly speaking, they turned pretty darn well!

I did the 2:1 ratio but I didn't measure the cream (it came in a 250ml packet and 250ml=1cup) but it came out too sticky and promptly destroyed my floured surface so I added more self rising.

I noticed the "knead for 5 minutes or until no longer sticky" option. Chose the latter because more than a decade's experience says nothing goes according to the recipe, and I live in the tropics. (It's starting to flood outside as I finished my last batch so it's really, really humid here)

Didn't rise as much as I thought it would but that's probably from the blunder I made earlier. They came out soft, tender with a little bit of a crust and pretty tasty for a plain biscuit.

Will definitely try again when I don't have a panicking family distracting me.

These may not be the very best tasting biscuit I have ever made but they are so easy, I will definitely make them again! These will be great for camping since there's no shortening mess and I bet they will cook up great in a dutch oven.
I used the substitute for self-rising flour and mine did need more cream do make a nice biscuit dough.

Very good. You have to knead it good so it won't be crumbly after you cook it.

great easy recipe.  I took other reviewers advice and did a 1 to 1 ratio.  I rolled mine out but didn't knead for 5 minutes.  Definitely a keeper.
