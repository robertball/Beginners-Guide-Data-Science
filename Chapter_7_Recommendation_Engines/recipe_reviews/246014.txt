This was wonderful! We subbed zucchini "zoodles" for the egg noddles, just adding them raw at the last 2 minutes to warm up but stay crunchy. It is hearty. It is full of flavor. It is definitely a great soup not to pass up!

See my reviews under another great recipe for "Potato Leek Soup II" by Julie.  I took both recipes and combined them to make one fantabulous soup! I loved both versions, and could not decide which one to make, so I made them both -- together!

Loved this soup. I had to add 1tsp more fresh ginger to the soup as it wasn't strong enough. But overall a good result and very easy to make.

Very tasty, comforting soup, perfect on a cold winter day or if you're feeling under the weather. I followed the recipe exactly, except for using more carrots in place of the celery. Next time I may add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. I'm looking forward to making this again. Thank you for sharing!

Delicious! The ginger and white pepper give this a subtle, pleasing bite and the turmeric provides a rich, beautiful color. Perfect soup if you are a little under the weather. I made two small changes.  I didn't have egg noodles so I prepared one 3 oz package of Ramen noodles (as directed on the package), and added the prepared noodles and broth to the vegetable soup at the end.  I also added 1 tsp of Better than Bouillion to give more depth to the broth.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I decided to simplify a few steps. Once the veggies were sauted, and before the cover and cook step, I added both the water AND broth, along with uncooked noodles.  Then covers and simmered until the noodles were done.  This became a one-pot recipe that turned out fantastic. The veggies weren't over done, and the potatoes took on more of the color from the turmeric.

Very good. I substituted coconut oil for olive oil, fresh turmeric instead of ground, and added parsnips and cashews. I parboiled the carrots, parsnips, and potatoes just because I prefer softer veggies in my soup. When I make this again, I will skip the potatoes and only use parsnips. The parsnips with white pepper were really delicious.

I made this dish accordingly, but it seemed to lack some flavor so I added cumin and that helped the dish out tremendously.  Will make again, but will add cumin again.

I really liked this but the pepper seemed to overtake the broth.  I will definitely make this again but use a little less pepper.  After I sauted the vegetables, I just added the water and broth to the pot and simmered it for 15 minutes, adding the noodles five minutes before it was done.
