Good but needs something to make it more interesting.  Maybe some hot peppers?

This was definitely okay, but rather bland. I used elbow instead of seashell pasta. I used one medium zucchini and one yellow squash, which was plenty enough. I left the zucchini raw and just steamed the yellow squash in the microwave for a few minutes. Boiling them for the 15 minutes called for would be way too soft for me. I added one medium yellow onion for more flavor. I also added extra dressing, garlic salt, pepper, parmesan cheese and some Italian seasoning.
