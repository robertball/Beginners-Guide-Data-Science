I've only made this with chicken and chicken broth, but the flavor is fantastic! I make some basmati rice and serve the soup over it, and it's absolutely fantastic. My local stores don't have the lime leaves or lemongrass stalks, but I have found a lemongrass paste that works quite nicely! Still tastes wonderful to me, thank you for the recipe! It's a keeper!

Amazing! I actually made this to use up a container of baby portobellos rather than turkey, and it was delicious. I hardly ever have seconds, but did with this. I think it would be a good way to use boring leftover rice as well. Definitely a new go-to. Thanks Chef John, for another great recipe,

I am not a big fan of fish, so I halved the fish sauce.  Even so, there was a fairly strong fishy flavor.  Outside of that, the recipe was fabulous.  I used minced lemongrass (and a lot of it!) and significantly more lime juice.   I would make this again, but likely completely omit the fish sauce.

SO GOOD! I didn't follow recipe exactly, just kind of worked with what I had on hand: used chicken broth instead, cut up chicken breast into chunks and let it marinade in thai panang curry paste (has lemongrass) for at least an hour & stirfried it until it just almost cooked through on outside - still bit raw inside & set it aside.  Then in the large pot gently stir fried pepper flakes to bring out spiciness before follow rest of the recipe directions/sequence. Later I'll add chicken to pot & allow soup to complete cooking without overdrying it. - came out tender and flavorful, maybe not let it simmer (chicken) as long next time for more moisture retention.

I'm not a huge ginger fan so I erred on the small side for the amount of ginger - I made sure to slice large enough pieces so that the pieces are easily visibly in the soup to pick out - just want it it for flavor, not gonna eat the root.  I didn't have kaffir lime leaves, green onions, or chili oil so did without those - still came out great but maybe it'd be even better with those missing ingredients! - and cilantro I mostly used chopped up leaves rather than the stems (may add extra unwanted bitterness), and I used regular sugar instead of palm sugar.  Whole full-size lime squeezed was just under the 1/4C needed - perfect.  Oh, and I added leftover rice (~2-3C, cooked) which add more fullness to the soup...almost overfilled pot. UPDATE: Definitely don't put all that rice into the soup because once cooled, it absorbed a

Excellent! This was so simple. I love coconut soup and this tastes just like the kind from the restaurant. I swapped the meat for shrimp and it came out great. Thank you!!

Delicious and easy. Great way to use left over turkey up. I didnâ€™t have the fish sauce but it was really good without it. Love the lime and coconut flavor together.

What a good idea for using up leftover turkey, and I did make the broth with the bones, too.  I used some grated lime rind for the lime leaves.

Very authentic, just like at Thai temple. Once the fish sauce was overpowering but it was the brand I used when I could not find the kind I like. It's worth a trip to an asian market to get the good stuff just be sure it is fresh. I think I picked up an old bottle the time it was not good.

So good! Used enoki mushrooms instead, added red peppers, and bean sprouts, 1/2 cup lime juice, zest of lime and added several tablespoons of Garlic chili sauce and a bit of hot sauce!

Such a great soup! I used shiitake mushrooms and left out the turkey for a meatless meal (except for the chicken broth, of course). I also substituted brown sugar for the palm sugar and the zest of one lime for the kaffir lime leaves. Everything else was the same. Wonderful balance of flavor! Definitely a make again dish.

I used my home made turkey broth and leftover turkey from thanksgiving.  I forgot the mushroom and used lime zest instead of leaves since my area does not sell the leaves.
The son and nephew said it was ok , my hubby said it was ok too but nothing speacil.

so good it should be illegal! I don't even eat meat. I'm a pescatarian/vegetarian. I live in Seattle where we have access to some of the best Asian food in the country and this tom kha ranks right up there with the best. I make it using vegetable broth and tofu or pre-cooked prawns instead of turkey. I also skip the lime leaves because I don't want to drive the two miles down to Whole Foods to pick them up. (Yeah, I know, I know.) This is the best, most authentic recipe I've found. It's nearly impossible to stop eating it.

Just tried this recipe with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and it did a great job masking the old turkey flavor and creating a delicious soup. It has a mild flavor, but is definitely a comfort food style soup with a unique flavor. Thanks Chef John!
