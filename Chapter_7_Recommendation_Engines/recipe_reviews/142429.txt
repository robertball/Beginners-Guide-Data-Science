I've made this recipe 3 times so far and each time it's the first thing gone on the table!  Here are a few things I do different.  First it takes alot longer to caramelize the onions then it says,  I did it low and slow for about 45 min.  I used alot less mayo as I felt it overpowered a little (I used just 1/4 cup instead of half).  I also upped the amount of onions to just about 2 cups and added a few dashes of worchestershire sauce.  You really do have to let it sit overnight to really get the full effect but I'll never buy store dip again,  its a little time consuming but VERY easy and the taste is out of this world

I followed this recipe EXACTLY.  I was very disappointed.  It tasted like mayonnaise, and nothing else.  I made it for my husband, who said it was good, but I'm positive he was just being nice.  I don't know.  He hates mayo, and that's all I could taste in there.

AMAZING!  I changed it up only a little bit.  Instead of powdered garlic I sauteed minced garlic with the white onion.  I added a sprinkle of garlic salt after chilled. YUM YUM YUM.  I will never buy premade dip again.

DO THESE THREE CHANGES, and it will be a hit with everyone!  Half the mayo.  Puree the onion.  Add two tsp of minced garlic along with the garlic powder.  Even people that don't like onion, will love the dip in this way!  Also, less tears because no extensive chopping off the onion: blender/food processor all the way.  I was looking for a knockoff of the one I buy from the store, and the way I made it was even better!

I used cream cheese instead of mayo, was really good, this recipe is not for people who do not like onion very very very oniony.  Also I added green onion for flavor and color.

This recipe was very easy and extremely flavorful. I followed it exactly, and got rave reviews at a picnic to which I brought it. It has a very natural onion flavor, with perfect seasoning balance, vey differant to that of the powder/sour cream taste I had been previously used to. I will not ever do that shortcut again, thanks to this recipe that is now in my permanent box! Thankyou!

This dip is addicting and you need to be careful you aren't left alone with it. It's good on anything including just a spoon. The only things I did differently was to use fresh cracked black pepper instead of white because I prefer it and don't care if the black flecks show. I also substituted bacon fat for the olive oil.

This dip was very tasty.  The onion flavor was rich and savory.  I did add some green onions for color towards the end of the saute process along with a 1/2 tsp of fresh garlic.  Very fast and easy.

This was so yummy and a huge hit at our BBQ. I served it with potato chips and cut up veggies. I made it with cream cheese instead of mayo based on other reviews, and it ended up being really thick and hard to dip into, but it was really creamy. I think next time I'll do have mayo and half cream cheese. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this exactly according to the recipe, and found the mayonnaise a bit too prominent.  Next time, I would halve the mayo and maybe use a little more onion, even.  It went over pretty well at my party, though.

This recipe is a good place to start but I agree with Crowchick it is wat too mayonnaisy. I would only add a 1/2 cup of mayo and 1 1/2 cups of sour cream. That's what I did and it tasted much better then the 1 cup of mayo version. But again a good base recipe. I changed nothing but the mayo and sour cream.

Very easy and delicious!  It did take a little longer than 20 minutes to caramelize the onions, but it was still TOTALLY worth it.  I'm not sure if I can eat store bought again.

This dip was AMMMMAZING! i tweaked the recipe a bit, i only did 1/4 cup of mayo.. im not a mayo person, but i did about a cup and a half of sour cream, i did 1/2 tsp salt total. and i added a bit more onion, when cooking the onion i let them cook for about 45 minutes till they were a nice golden brown then i let them drain and cool until they were nice and crispy, i chopped up some green onion and threw it in fresh and then some on top for garnish with some sun roasted sunflower seeds and it had a really nice presentation that matched the amazing flavor, it was a huge hit at our party

Very, very good. I upped the garlic powder and sprinkled chopped green onions on top. Let this sit overnight and let the flavors meld. I served this with Stacy's Naked Pita Chips and melba toast.

This was really good.  I used 2 large onions because 1.5 cups didn't seem like enough by the time they cooked down.  It was good to serve at our family camping trip.  I think it needed color and I wished I would have put some green onions in there or a little dill.

French Onion Dip From Scratch Haiku: "Holy awesome dip! Loved and devoured with zeal. I'll make it again!" I sauteed my onions (2 c. worth) for around 30 min., up'ed the sour cream to 1 1/2 c. and reduced the mayo to 1/2 c. Served w/ kettle chips, and this dip was a hit - I don't think I'll ever do the packet dip, or canned stuff again, having found this delicious onion dip.

YUM! I've been wanting to make this for some time and am SOOOOOOO glad I finally did!!! Taking time to caramelize the onions REALLY makes a huge difference and is what sets this dip apart from store-bought ones. Admittedly, I did make a few changes that I think made this even better (I'm not sure I would have liked this as much had I not done so...). As others recommended, I decreased the mayo by half and upped the sour cream to 1 1/2 cups worth. I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce / pinch of sugar to my onions as they cooked (and I cooked them in bacon fat, not EVOO) and a couple of sliced green onions to my finished dip, mainly for color. My final change was to up the amount of onions to 2 cups total - but I would add even more next time. NOTE: It took about 25 minutes for my onions to caramelize, but I had to turn my burner to the lowest setting the final 10 minutes to prevent them from scorching. Overall, a VERY good, basic dip that the man in my life loves. Booyah! Thanks for sharing, CCUMMINS. :)

Quick n easy! I keep forgetting to buy onion dip for football watching, so came looking for something simple. I made this even easier by just mixing a spoon of sour cream and a spoon of mayo with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Could not have been easier and just as good as an over-processed store dip. I will try it with caramelized onions next time.

This was very good but as written the taste of mayo was too strong for our tastes.  Next time I will use 1/2 the mayo and increase the sour cream accordingly.

I swear it seemed like every review I read said they will never buy store bought French Onion Dip again. Wow after making this " I will never buy store bought French Onion Dip again". True it takes much longer to caramlize onions and I added chives from the garden. This was a huge hit a a BBQ.

Just made this and its excellent! I used 16oz (2 cups) of sour cream instead of the mayo just because i dont like mayo. used 2 cups of onion, 1 cup yellow onion and 1 cup sweet onion. Caramelized the onions for about 1 1/2 hrs, added in 2 small cloves of garlic at the end of caramelization. After cooling tossed them in a blender and pureed it then mixed it in with the sour cream. added some garlic salt and pepper and even some granulated onion because i didnt think it was onion-y enough but after sitting it tasted great! i'll probably leave the granulated onion out next time cause it definitely gains flavor as it sits! VERY TASTY! Way better then the packeted kind!!

Excellent dip!  I added some beef boullion paste to the onions while they were carmelizing (I didn't add any extra salt).  I also added a small container of onion and chive cream cheese (I only used .25 cups of mayonnaise).  You can easily adapt this recipie to your taste.  It is delicious! Sooo much better than anything you would make from a powdered mix.

Good... base but really missing something. So I added some liquid concentrate beef broth... 2 of those little packets... got rid of the "mayonnaise" others complained of though I use cottage cheese which I do w/ my onion dip anyways... a lot lower in calories... of course the broth ups the sodium... but nothing close to the amount of sodium in the store powder.

I'm not a big dip fan but made this for a family gathering and it was a hit.  I did cut the mayo to 1/2 cup and used 1/2 cup whipped cream cheese along with the 1 cup of sour cream.  Carmelizing the onion took a little while, but I will probably make again when I need a good dip.

This is good.  I don't measure but used almost a medium sized container of sour cream and just a big spoonful or two of mayo.  Also I carmelize the onion in equal parts oil (any kind) and butter.  Can't beat how easy this is.

Excellent!  I quickly threw this dip together a few hours before a BBQ and it turned out great!  I'm not usually a big fan of french onion dips, but this one is fantastic!!

This was delicious. The only things I did differently was add spices, and put only about a 1/2-3/4 cup of mayonnaise. A full cup would have overruled the taste. Overall... Yum!

I love this.  My husband especially loved it!  I changed up a few things, based on our tastes.  First, I used chopped garlic with the onions.  I added the chopped garlic when I had a minute or two left with cooking the onions.  I used maybe a 1/2 T.  I took the advice of others and used 1/2 c of sour cream and 1/2 a block of cream cheese, which made the dip really creamy.  It turned out amazingly well.  I agree with everyone else - this stuff is way better than what you can buy in the store.

Five stars because it really does taste much better than the boxed onion soup mix version! I made this as the recipe states, except used one a half cups sour cream, and half cup mayo.
In just 20 mins the onions were carmelized to perfection. What an easy recipe!  Soooo tasty :)

This dip is fantastic and so much more flavorful and natural tasting than the packaged kind.  If you're having the guys over for football the mix is a-ok, but if you're having a holiday party this is the dip for you!

This is great!  I followed the advice of some other reviews and used cream cheese instead of mayo and it worked perfectly.  I also added two beef bullion cubes to the onions while they sauteed, and left out the kosher salt.  Delicious!

I read the other reviews prior to making, and immediately reduced mayonnaise from 1 cup to 1/4 cup, as I’m not a big mayo fan, and that was the perfect proportion. BUT, the onions do not need to be sautéed for longer them 20 minutes on medium low. Mine were on the verge of burning. Maybe gas vs. electric range top makes a difference? In any case, surprisingly delicious. Being an Italian cook, I love onion & garlic, so I added a dash each of onion & garlic powder after adding caramelized onions & it was yummy!

I made it this multiple times and with my modifications we refer to it as crack dip.  I skip the mayo all together and use 2 cups of high quality sour cream.  I add in some freeze dried chives as well and I sprinkle just a touch of sugar to the onions to help with the caramelizing process.  I no longer buy store bought chip dip. this is also good on baked potatoes.

Made as written and it was way to sweet for my taste. I ended up added Worcestershire and some other spices but it was still sweet. The mayo taste was also a little to prominent.

this was great.  i also used some plain greek yogurt and half the mayo, and added some shredded cheddar cheese w/horseradish.  i had quite a bit leftover because i doubled the recipe, but i just got done making stuffed mushrooms with the leftovers.  i cooked some sausage, added some heat and a little sage.  i love using up what i have!  thanks for the post CCUMMINS!

Delicious!  No need to ever buy the dry mix again.  The one thing I changed was adding less mayo.  I used a total of 1/3 cup mayonnaise.  This was just the right amount for me.

No Mayo!  just sour cream.  I did use Vadalia onions and thought they may be a bit sweet but great flavour.   Also used black pepper and saute the fresh garlic in with the onions.  I will try some cream cheese next time- great idea!

Great dip but it does take longer to carmalize the onions. I also used less Mayo and more sour cream and some yogart; this can be adjusted to your own taste.  Also pleas someone tell me how create a new catagory under the "save receipes"  Thank you

I halved this recipe just to try it.  Used light sour cream and light "real" mayo.  Tried it before our guests arrived on a bavarian pretzel piece.  Good thing I did because it was extremely salty.  I quickly added in more sour cream.  Next time I make this, I will totally eliminate the salt.

I used your recipe for basic ingredients. And mine turned out great! Even though I added a little too much salt by accident! Still, by adding in some mayonnaise, it really helped with the salty taste. NEXT TIME, I will go by your recipe!

I took the suggestion from some of the other reviewers and 1 1/2 cups sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo.  Other than that this was a stock recipe.  I personally did not like the HEAVY olive oil taste that permeated the onions.  It totally overpowered the other ingredients.  I will try it one more time with canola oil and butter.

UPDATE - Nah, I left this overnight to let the flavors marry, and no I will not make this again.  I also downgraded my rating to 2 stars from 3.  This is nasty.

Good.  I added more onion, a minced clove of fresh garlic and used plain greek yogurt in place of mayo.  I strongly suggest making this dip a night in advance. The flavors really came together overnight.  I will make this again.

I gave it four stars because it is never as big a hit as a cheesy onion & bacon dip I always make.  (It's also from this site.)  I love this dip, but my friends don't seem to love it as much as I.

Great recipe.  From prior recommendations, I used 1/2 cup mayo, instead of 1 cup mayo and 1/2 cup cream cheese.  I mixed the mayo, sour cream, and cream cheese in the food processor to ensure a proper mix.  Then added the onions and a little paprika for color and Viola!  The perfect onion dip.  Thanks much!

Really good dip. I used half the mayo and subbed in half a cup of reduced fat cream cheese. So good. I topped it with chopped green onions and chives. I brought it to a midwestern potluck and everyone loved it!

This was really good.  Because I was short on time, I added minced onion and onion powder instead of sauteing the onions.  And because of some other reviews, I reduced the amount of mayo by a 1/4.  Will not buy store bought again.

This was amazing.  I was extremely pleased with the way this turned out.  I even ended up substituting 1/2 cup plain yogurt for some of the sour cream, as I had less than I thought.

Easy to make and yummy. I had never though about making my own onion dip before...I usually buy the powdered mix. This is much better, and got lots of compliments at the cookout I took it to. My house smelled like onions for a few days though.

Everyone at the party LOVED this dip!  You have to really like onions to like it but then, why would you make an onion dip if you are not an onion fan?  I use all sour cream, no mayo.  I just don't like mayo.

Delicious!!! This was so good.  I did use 1 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo as a personal preference.  Added a clove of minced garlic at the end of the saute.  There is just no reason to buy the store bought stuff--there's no comparison!

Okay, it's been in the fridge 2 hours.  I followed the directions except I used 2 cups of onion instead of 1 1/2.  I think next time I will use LESS mayo (1/3 cup instead of 1/2 a cup) because the mayo taste is a little strong.  It also needs more of an onion taste to it.  Maybe onion powder would work, but probably chives would do very well.

Oveall, however, it is a nice tasting dip.

Mmmmmm!
I used vidalia onions with the garlic and 1/2 block (softened) cream cheese and 1/2 C mayo with the 1C sour cream.  The cream cheese gave it a great texture and rich flavor.
So easy and so impressive.
Everyone at 2 different functions raved about it.

I gave this 4* only because I modified the recipe a little.  I added twice the amount of onion and some fresh chopped parsley for color.  I thought chopped fresh thyme would be outstanding but I didn't have any at the time.  I served this at a family BBQ and everyone said it was "highly addictive."  I actually only got one chip w/ dip before the whole thing was gone.

We just didn't care for this, I'm not sure why. It's not the fault of the recipe, I guess it's just not our taste. Thanks for the chance to try something new though!

I loved the onions . I was eating them out of the pot they tasted so good. The dip was ok I added extra sour cream and extra seasoning to help it out. I will try to make it again. Hopefully my family will like it better.

A little time consuming, but worth it. Very bold flavor. I made a double batch for consecutive outdoor parties. There was nothing left to bring home, so I had to make some for myself. It’s better the second day. All the flavors come together well.

I agree about using only half a cup of mayo and adding a tablespoon or so of Worcestershire sauce a couple of minutes before taking the onions out of the pan. You don't get the full flavor until the next day so plan ahead, it's worth it. Everyone always loves it!

It is very easy to make and everyone loved it.  I recommend adjusting the amount of onions based on your love for onions.  There were a few people who commented that it was "too oniony", I thought it was just fine.

Before even reading the comments I decided to use only half a cup mayo and just added the other half as sour cream mainly because it's lower in calories but also because I thought it was too much mayo. I added a couple cloves of garlic instead of powdered. I also added some dill and my power greens (kale spinach and such) chopped really fine and added with the onions when they are just about done.
Its delicious and my husband is obsessed with it.

I'm giving 4 stars just because I think it calls for too much mayo. But switch it up a bit and it's excellent.

I followed the advice from some of the previous reviews and cut the Mayo to half a cup.   I also added half a cup of cottage cheese and green onion.  It was quite good.

My big weakness  WAS store bought French Onion dip.  I could sit and eat a half a bag of potato chips when I have the dip.   I made the mistake of reading the ingredient label and discovered very few "Real" ingredients.  So I decided to look for a home-made version!  This was delicious!  Even my husband ate it, and he usually doesn't touch the store bought version!   I definitely will make again!

So...this recipe is almost exactly the same as Alton Brown's Onion Dip from Scratch. The ingredients are the same, but the proportions for the mayo, sour cream, and seasoning are a little different. I used Alton's proportions (1-1/2 cups sour cream, 3/4 cup mayo, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp ground white pepper, 1/2 tsp salt). It had a lot of great onion flavor thanks to the caramelized onions. It's really thick, though, so I might add some yogurt next time to thin it out a bit.

Fabulous! Just don't rush the caramelization of the onions .  I used Walla Walla sweets, but think I'll try yellow onions next time. My husband really liked it and we ate it with cucumber slices instead of potato chips.

The best onion dip ever! Yes, it takes more time to carmelize the onions and if you keep stirring them, it will take forever. I followed advice and cut down on the mayo and added fresh garlic. This is the bomb!

The mayo ruined it... better to use just sour cream. Then I'd add a little more salt and less garlic powder.

Absolutely amazing! The only change I made was using minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and I only had black pepper so I used that. I minced the onion as small as I could get it and cooked it about 15 minutes on high, stirring frequently. This was the best onion dip I ever tasted! And SO EASY!!! I will never make from dip mix again!

The other reviewers who thought there was too much mayo were dead on accurate. I started with 1 c sour cream and 1/2 c mayo. I ended up adding another 1/4-1/2 c sour cream.

I made this with sweet onions which was all I had on hand. It was good, but milder than I would have liked. I think you really need to use a stronger onion for this recipe -- maybe yellow or spanish.

After tasting, I also doubled up on the garlic powder.

I love this recipe, and it's so much better than purchased dip. The recipe is great on it's own if you just want the straight up onion dip. However, I prefer my dip a little more tangy, so I took other reviews suggestions about halving the mayonnaise (but added more sour cream to get the full 2 cups of creamy yumminess). I also added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and chives for color (or scallions...depends what I have on hand). I used a hand immersion blender to mix it all up. It definitely should me made 4 or more hours before your soiree as it taste better when it has time to let the flavors mingle. 

On a side note, I was making this in the morning and must have been sleepy. I accidentally added a pizza sauce seasoning (from Penzey's/The Spice House in Milwaukee...it's ground fine) thinking it was white pepper. I added the white pepper after I realized it, and it was pretty tasty!

I made two very slight changes. The first was to use garlic infused olive oil. The second was to use a lovely garlic aioli I'd made the previous day instead of mayonnaise.

2.5-3 stars for recipe as is (too much mayo & bland). 5 stars with adaptations suggested by other reviewers: half the mayo, slightly more onions (2 cups), double the garlic powder, and add in a couple crushed garlic cloves. Also, I sprinkled on some cayenne pepper.

I make this recipe but I use minced dry onion to taste instead of fresh onions and half of the mayo. I also do not use as much garlic, if any. It tastes more like the original store bought version without all the additives. Make sure to let it sit in the fridge for at least a couple of hours for the best flavor.

I made it as the recipe stated, and it's true what some people say, you have to carmelize onions slowwwwwww. This brings the flavor to the next level. I had a pan with fresh bacon drippings in it so I browned the onion in that.  Also to those who could only taste mayo, you truly have to let this dip sit in th fridge a good 24 hours for the flavors to marry, and develop. My hubby loves onion dip and this recipe makes it easy to make it for him anytime..thanks!

I have made the recipe 3 times with some modifications. I double the about of onions and a caramelize them for at least an hour until they are golden brown. I also added roasted garlic instead of the garlic powder. It needs at least 24 hours to chill. It is a big difference in flavor. The first time, I just let it chill for a few hours before serving it and it was still better than the dry onion mix, but wasn't fabulous. The next day, it was delicious.

This is the closest dip I've found so far to a French onion dip my mom used to buy when I was a kid. I added fresh minced garlic instead of powder and half a cup more onions. Turned out great, I love this recipe.

This was really good, I may try adding about 4 ounces of cream cheese the next time I make it only because I like my dip to be REALLY thick, but otherwise perfect.  This is going to be a staple snack from now on.

Very good dip!  And easy to put together.  Make sure and make ahead of time so that the flavors can meld together...my husband couldn't wait that long.  But I'm sure the flavors will be more developed tomorrow...hope there will be some dip left over tomorrow!

A great base to start with; however I felt  that it was too mayonaissie. :) However I almost tripled every spice ingredient for some kick. So as is I gave it 3 stars for the recipe, with my  additions, I'll give it 5 stars. I appreciate the recipe because otherwise I wouldn't know where to start.

very good dip.  the onions do require a lot more time to cook than it calls for in order to caramelize.

The only change I might suggest is make it the day before using, the flavor is so much better. 2 hours after making, it still tasted like little more than mayo.

This is delicious.  People raved about how good it was.  I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the onions halfway through carmelizing.  Used 1 1/2 cups sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo.  Perfect!

I've gotten the best feedback from this!  Everybody loved it, and it lasted, at best, a few minutes.  I will definitely triple next time!  Great flavor.  I followed other reviewers and added worchestershire and took my time carmelizing the onions.  Then I left overnight in the fridge for added flavor.

I really liked this dip. I did change a couple things though. I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and only used 1/2 cup mayo. liked the suggestion to try Worcester sauce and use about 1/2tsp.

This was delicious!  Per other reviewers, I cut the mayonnaise down to 1/4 of a cup and used sour cream instead.  I also sautéed two garlic cloves with the onions.  This dip is definitely best if left overnight.

Next time I will cut the mayonnaise down even more, probably to 1/8 of a cup.  I will also try to add a little bit of lemon juice - I think the acidity might be nice.

All in all, FANTASTIC!  Thanks for the recipe - it's a family favourite (with chips OR broccoli).

If you want to make it more homemade, use Chef John's Crème Fraiche recipe in place of store bought sour cream.

I made this according to the directions, only I substituted the sour cream with organic plain yogurt and, like some others did, used less mayo and more yogurt. Super delicious! Hard to  stop eating it!

This dip was fantastic! Everyone raved about how good it was and wanted the recipe. One thing that I did was cut the mayo down to 1/2 cup and added a 1/2 cup more of the sour cream. I also made it the night before just so everything could sit and blend well together. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty bland and salty when done as is.  Saved it with added spices of Cayenne, cumin, extra white or black pepper, and some onion powder.

Overall this was great. I will for sure make this again but just with less onion maybe 25-50% less because the longer you let it sit the stronger the caramelized onion gain intensity.

I make this onion dip for every family gathering and it is always a huge hit. Everyone loves it! I tend experiment with the amount of garlic powder I use and I like to slightly over cook the onions. I also like to through in some celery salt. Basically you can't go wrong if you use this recipe as a starting point and experiment a bit with the ingredients.

I thought this recipe was great!  I did reduce the mayo a bit and replaced it with extra sour cream.  I think the trick is to let it sit for a long time to let the flavors marry.  All of the onion haters in my family loved it!  Will be making this again soon.

I turned it into a low carb/low cal dip.  OMG! This is great!  I'm mad I just found it and have been wasting money on store bought .  I made it over to make it only 170 calories for the entire recipe! I did the following:  subbed coconut oil for the olive, used 1 cup onions instead of 1 1/2 (even though I love onions, seemed to be too much to me), added minced garlic and 1 stalk of scallions to the onions at around minute 15, subbed 1 cup Fage 0% greek yogurt for the sour cream and 1/2 cup Smart Beat non fat mayo for the mayo.  I started eating it warm, it was that good.  Next time I MAY use full fat Fage because the texture is slightly dry but the taste is outstanding.

I made this following the advice of several reviewers and used less mayo.  Don't get me wrong, it was really good - but was it better than onion soup mix onion dip?  Eh.  The jury's out.  I ate a bit and then added some cooked bacon to see if that would up the flavor a little and it didn't.  I'm thinking that this might be a good dip to serve hot.  I'll try it again, but I wasn't wowed.

This was quite good. I let it sit for about 6 hours in the fridge before serving. I added a few dashes of Worcestershire after trying the recipe as written. Worcestershire definitely helped enhance the flavor and color. My husband says it doesn't beat Heluva Good Dip, but it does beat onion soup mix dip.

I've made this recipe a number of times and it's a hit every time.  I follow the recipe as written, using low fat sour cream and mayo.  I think the caramelized onions are what make it taste so good.

I cooked my onions on a lower heat, and longer.  After we let it sit, I found it just a little too mayo tasting so added some sour cream and a dash of worcestershire per another rater.  It was very good and I will make it again.

I love mayo, but this was a little too much like eating mayo on my carrots. However, it did satisfy my prego craving so I will try it again, but with less mayo. I think I'll do as other suggested and put in some cream cheese and green onion as well.

To make this a little healthier, I combined it with another recipe. While caramelizing the onions, add some beef broth to cover them and simmer with 1/2 tbsp of white vinegar until it has mostly evaporated. Allow to cool. Instead of 1 cup of mayo, I split it into 1/2 cup of plain yogurt, and 1/2 cup lite mayo. Refrigerate for an hour. So delicious!

i had a craving for onion dip at 9pm, but no soup mix to be found. I made this in about 10 minutes without mayo or garlic. Had TONs of flavor, tasted just like the mix!

I made this dip exactly as directed and it was amazing!  A huge family favorite for sure!  I love that it tastes similar to the 'onion soup mix' version, but much healthier being from scratch!

FABULOUS.  It was all gone in 1 night.  Made exactly as directed and it was not too mayonaise flavored as some suggested.  I had no problem browning the onion in 20 mins, probably because i did not use a non-stick pan.  I think the non-stick pans don't brown as well as a good non-coated pan.  i had no problem cleaing the pan afterwards either, because i kept stirring the onions and scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spatula.  Definite make again :)

The reason why I gave this a 3 is because I wasn't sure that if I completely add no mayo or sour creme that it would change the taste of the dip. I'm going to try it this time with 1/2 cup of mayo and sour creme. Great recipe though!

I thought that there was too much mayo. This recipe is a replica of a recipe from another website, but with altered portions of sour cream, garlic and mayo. I have tried again with the 1/2 tsp garlic powder from this recipe and mix of 1 1/2 cups sour cream, 3/4 cup of mayo from original recipe. Also added a splash of Worcestershire Sauce instead of the 1/2 tsp of Kosher Salt. Very tasty.

Very YUMMY!  I made this in a rush, put the onions in the freezer to cool and served it asap, very delicious! I used more sour cream than mayo like another reviewer said and used lowfat mayo.  No more boxed stuff!!!

I used 2 1/2 cups of yogurt cheese instead of sour cream. You make it by using a large coffee filter to drain off the whey from plain yogurt. It takes 8-10 hours to make. However it is much better for you than sour cream and tastes the same. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder and 1 teaspoon dried chopped chives. It was great.

Good!  I used leftover roasted onions from a different AR recipe.  This makes about two cups of dip.  Next time I'll reduce the recipe by half as it made too much.

I used Spike, a seasoning salt rather than the kosher salt.  It really takes a few hours for the flavors to develop!  This is better with chips than with veggies.

Awesome recipe.  Much better than store brands.  I will never buy it store brands again after making this. Easy, delicious and I recently made this for a party and it was a favorite.  My sister in law doesnt even like french onion dip but couldnt stop dipping.  recipe is definitely a keeper.

Was absolutely delicious. I minced about five cloves of garlic and sauted with the onions once the onions started to turn transparent instead of using garlic powder.
