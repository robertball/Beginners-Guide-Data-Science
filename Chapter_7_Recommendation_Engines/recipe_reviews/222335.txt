This rating is for the filling as I didn't have any pizza dough.  Because the recipe sounded so good, and time was short, i used a package of tortilla shells, making them burritos.  They turned out great!  Next time I will use pizza dough, which I am sure is fantastic.

Made this for Recipe Group...LOVED IT! I did use a roll of hot Italian sausage, but that was my only change. Very easy to make, though the rolling was a bit challenging due to the sticky dough, lol. Everyone really enjoyed this, and I will definitely be making it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is amazing. I chopped up peppers & onions, cooked them with the sausage. Also split up the cheese (1/3 Monterey, 1/3 Mozzarella, & 1/3 Pepper Jack.) Gives it extra flavor, turned out fantastically!

This was delicious! I added some pizza sauce to the inside so that it wasn't too dry, and we dunked it in extra sauce. My husband LOVED this! Thanks!

Recipe Group Selection:  06, July 2013 ~ Delicious and very simple to put together.  I used hot Italian sausage and pepper jack cheese because my family likes spicy foods.  Browning the sausage took longer than it did to put this together and bake it.  A great fast meal for when you want something home cooked on a busy evening.  Serve with a salad and hot veggies or fruit and your meal is done.  The ingredients are so flexible with this recipe.  Different flavors of sausage and different cheeses will change this meal up.  Great recipe, Veronica, thanks for sharing.

Very good.  Cooked sausage  with onions and garlic  and mixed in a couple tablespoons of pizza sauce before  rolling  it up with cheese.  Excellent taste with not too much for younger palettes.   Did bake it at 375 for 25 minutes to brown and crisp dough to prevent splitting.  Thank you for this one.

Not gourmet, but a huge hit with the family. I used less sausage and added diced cooked onion, green pepper, and some fresh black olives, wrapping it up in one of Pillbury's new whole wheat crusts. We dipped the slices in marinara sauce. Next time I might sprinkle some italian seasonings with salt on top of the olive oil brushed crust before baking.

Excellent, super easy, and my picky 3 and 5 year old ate it and asked for more! I made it ahead, threw it in the refrigerator for a while then baked it when I was ready to make dinner. I will definitely be making this again for dinner and parties!

I love this recipe.  So much easier to make then some of those recipes that call for an egg mixture.  Also, I love it with sharp provolone cheese.

This was okay. Good base recipe to build on. My husband felt it was missing something. Not sure if it was my frozen dough but this seemed underbaked @350. If I do it again I'd try 375. I made a country gravy using the sausage drippings  & 1/5 of the meat and that was excellent on top.

I make this bread.  For a fun twist, I use hot sausage and add maple syrup to the sausage mixture, and I switch the cheese the shredded Mexican cheese.  It makes for a good brunch item.

We make and take this everywhere we go. The only thing I do different is I add a can of Rotel to the sausage and I slice before baking to make it rolls.  Less messy

I made my favorite yeast dough, but that is the only change.  Took this to Church breakfast.   Two little pieces were left.   I was a big success, and pretty easy to make.  This will be a favorite base recipe for me,  with  some experimenting   with some minor additions.   Thanks for  sharing a nice recipe.       MSR

I made do with what I had on hand using typical pizza toppings. I had no shredded mozz so I used 3 sticks of mozzarella string cheese instead, slicing into little disks. Totally worked! This is a keeper, especially given its versatility.

I have made this twice--the first time with Hot Italian sausage which was delicious.  This time, I made it with breakfast sausage and served it with country gravy.  It was a nice change from biscuits and gravy.

This is very filling, especially if using the full 1 lb Italian sausage. We made exactly but did add mushrooms. Having the dipping marinara sauce was ok, but don't know if really necessary. Will make again because you can use such a variety of things to change it up. When making with Italian sausage we'll only use 1/2 lb & mushroom. I'm going to try chicken, bacon with maybe an alfredo sauce, or ranch dressing if I take the easy way out.  Always brush the roll with olive oil for a nice crust. Hubby couldn't roll it over to do the bottom cause it was so full so that stuck to pan. We had used a thin crust pizza dough, so may have to use regular or make from scratch if time permits so it may hold together better.

We're a family of pizza lovers.  This was GREAT and so easy .  Made the recipe exactly as posted and did not find it dry at all.  I warmed pizza sauce for side dipping, but didn't end up needing it.  Lots of room for customization here too!  Looking forward to making it again.

I made a modified version of this recipe for my dad, who hates sausage.

1) used extra lean ground beef instead of sausage.
2) put a thin layer of marinara sauce on the dough before loading the ingredients.
3) added a layer of pepperoni.
4) sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top after the olive oil.
5) marinara sauce to dip.

He tends to like bland foods so I didn't try to spice it up at all. He said it was a keeper!  Thanks for the great recipe! I'll have to make it the original way for myself sometime.

Very tasty!  I used ground turkey sausage and added frozen chopped onions, garlic, and peppers while browning it.  I also used shredded cheddar/jack cheese.  On top, I put olive oil and Italian seasoning.  I ended up baking it for almost 25 minutes, and it never really browned much, but the temperature was where it was supposed to be.  I served it with small bowls of spaghetti sauce for dipping and a mixed green salad.  I will make this again soon!

Thank you Veronica.  I used to make this all the time and wanted to try it with natural chix sausage but couldn't find my recipe.  This is exactly what I was looking for!  Thanks for posting.
