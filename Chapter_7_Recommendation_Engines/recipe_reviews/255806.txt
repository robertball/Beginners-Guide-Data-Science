I personally loved the spices (not so for all my buddies, however!)  I thought it had just the right amount of "kick'" to it, although I used the same amount of spices in the recipe, but with 2 cups of seeds.  I think it would have been way too much for only 1 cup.  I also rinsed and soaked the seeds overnight in water.  I baked them for longer than indicated, until they seemed to be done.   I shared with my Livestrong class and had requests for the recipe.

This is a snack and that is delicious as well as Healthy. I quadrupled the spices and stored  in a container with the instructions on the side. Just add the oil and bake. Thank you!

Awesome! I love the mix of flavors! The only 2 thing I did different was mixing in 2 cups of seeds I had in the fridge soaking in salt water for a few days. So I used 3 cups of seeds for this recipe. There had a sweetness plus saltiness from the soaking seeds. This is a keeper! Especially because of the healing spices...Thank you for sharing!!!

Just a bit of a kick but very addicting! Will be making them again.
