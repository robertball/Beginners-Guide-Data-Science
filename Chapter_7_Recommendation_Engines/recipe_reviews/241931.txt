This recipe yields a very good cookie-a keeper for the recipe book indeed. The texture is not the usual almond flour texture thanks to the coconut flour. It is chewy but not overly. It melts in your mouth but is still crunchy outside. With my first batch the cookies spread out over the baking sheet, cooked in 6 minutes almost burning on the bottom but not the top. This left me with a delicious, very flat, very large cookie even though I put the batter in the fridge for about 10 minutes. I tried a second batch using 25% less butter, freezing the batter about 10 minutes and weighing each cookie before baking to ensure each cookie was the same size (approx. 23 grams before cooking). I added a picture of both to show the difference, but both were very tasty. With batch 2, I had tall cookies that look like muffins-but don't doubt it-these were cookies! Almost like mom used to make if mom had baked with almond flour and coconut flour. They held their shape, cooked in 8 minutes and tasted like heaven. I also turned down the temperature to 165Â° C on the second batch. Thank you Christine Rogers for sharing your recipe.

Tried this twice. Second time hoped for better results. They did not flatten as pictured. Did not cook through even though I baked them longer than stated. I used white chips which was tasty. Not sure why this recipe did not work for me.
