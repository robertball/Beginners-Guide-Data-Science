Good taste!  Cherries make a cute garnish, but you need plenty of ice cubes in the glass for them to rest on because they tend to sink!

Omg, is this ever good!  I will make this again and again and again!  I added a drop of vanilla extract, also.

Good!
 Next time try changing sliced oranges in the place of lemon!

5/3/2016  I cut the recipe down to 2 servings. It seems to me that this is supposed to be served as a hot tea, so that's what I did tonight. But I noticed another reviewer served it iced, so I will check that out tomorrow with the other serving. This would especially be good in the cold wintertime. I was expecting the ginger to be really noticeable, but no one flavor overpowered any other.  5/4/2016  I made 2 servings last night and drank 1 of them hot. Today, I poured the rest of it over ice. It is much better ice cold! I really enjoyed it after my walk around the block outside.

This was suggested to me on the Buzz by Sueb, when I was looking for something to do with a pack of fresh cherries that I had. Perfect for a hot summer day - so refreshing, and pleasing! 
I'd like to try this next time by subbing the sugar for honey to make this even healthier! Thank you for the recipe Kerri, and thanks for the suggestion Sueb!
