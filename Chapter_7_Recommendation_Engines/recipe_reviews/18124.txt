the scones didn't have enough flavor - not enough molasses, not enough spice.  they were also too dry as is; I added more milk... rather a disappointment....

A great scone! I scaled the recipe down to eight (8) and it worked wonderfully. The molasses favor is very subtle and I would almost recommend adding more. Would this change the consistency? This is not a sweet scone, so those looking for more sweetness might want to jazz it up a bit. Overall, the scones are light and fluffy and would be delicious with any preserves. Apricot comes to mind immediately!

These scones are very good. I decreased the cinnamon to 1/4 teaspoon for my fiance and they are still very flavorful. Easy to make- I used my KitchenAid mixer with excellent results. A quick favorite!

These scones were amazing! I made them for some Irish friends and they loved them. Add a bit more spice and molasses and serve them with butter and apricot preserves!

Everyone loved these!  We made them for St. Pat's day.  The only change I made was to add about 4 tbs of sugar.  We wanted it a little sweeter. I will probably start making these instead of biscuits. They were moist and flaky and had a great flavor.

Wow! Three thumbs up! Used soft marg instead of butter and delighted my vegan husband. Quick, easy and tasty. Definitely a keeper!

I just made these for breakfast, they were very good, but you dont really taste the molasses due to all the spices. I would call them Gingerbread scones.My 6yr old and husband loved them. I will make them again but alter the spices, I used my food processor on the pulse setting and they mixed up fast, baked light and fluffy. I used skim milk,and used 2Tbl molasses but halved all other ingred. they are best eaten right away.

Really easy to make and great flavour! I had to add more milk and molasses. Not too sweet at all. Perfect with jam or just butter.

These would be incredible for the holidays! They are not sweet at all, I would use them as the bread with a meal. I am considering using them for Thanksgiving. Really wonderful.

I like the way that if you cover them after baking, they stay soft, while the other ones get crisper.  I used 2 cups whole wheat flour, and 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour instead of what was called for, and I needed just a little more milk.  They rose nicely!  Not sweet, really! Very good!

These were good.  I did not like them warm though, and I did top with honey as they are not sweet.

These were great! Not too sweet and very flakey.  The recipe was easy and mine did rise nicely. I like triangles as well so I rolled the dough out in one big circle that was at least 1 inch thick and cut into 8 triangles. For those of you who like sweet you could add a little brown sugar or some raisins, or both :)

Loved this recipe. I like cooking but when it comes to baking, I'm a bit hesitant but these were easy. The dough was still sticky when all was mixed so added a bit more flour. When all was baked I thought taste was too subtle and would suggest adding more of all the spices and molasses. Next time I will double the spices and molasses. (By the way I used Briar Rabbit Blackstrap Molasses if anyone is interested.)

This was my first real scone recipe to try.  I am thrilled with the results.  The only thing I did that wasn't in the recipe was make a cinnamon glaze to pour on the top for just a little added sweetness.
I didn't think they were heavy but I've only had a scone once before so didn't know what to expect.  

Since the butter I used had softened up quite a bit when I cut it into the dry, I put the mixture into the fridge for a while to chill before I added the milk.

I will def. be making these again.

These were okay. I ate them, but they were very, very dry and not very flavorful. You definitely need something to drink with these.

I went to Ireland a year ago and couldn't stop eating scones.  I've been searching for a really good recipe, and this MAY be it.  I was really excited to see reviews that said "not sweet enough," or "too dry," because I knew people were comparing it to our american scones, which just aren't the same thing at all.  I figured if a lot of people thought they were too sweet, they'd be just right for me.

 I think I might have over kneaded the dough or didn't cut the butter in right, because mine are SUPER dense, but it's okay. I'm going to keep trying at this recipe.  But I'm eating one right now and it's delicious!  I may put some raisins in next time as well.  Thank you!!

I enjoyed these but my kids did not.  Definitely more for adults.  They are not particularly sweet but I didn't find the spice mixture overpowering.  I think they'd be great for a light breakfast.

I made this recipe the first time as written and thought it was a little bland. Then realized if it is an old recipe, it probably would be bland to our more modern palates.
Sugar and especially spices used to be a very expensive commodity in the common kitchen in Great Britain.  
The next time I made it I added three packets of Splenda to the dry ingredients, ramped up the spices to 2 teas. cinnamon, and 1/2 teas. of all the other spices.  I used 3 TBS molasses and 1 egg but I kept the milk the same.  We liked it much better this time around.  Next time my husband has requested a hand full of sultanas.  I think I will also brush the tops with a scant amount of milk and sprinkle on some coarse baking sugar.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these today and used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and omitted the allspice and nutmeg. I used the cloves and ginger and added 1/4 teaspoon of cardamom. I also upped the molasses to 3 tablespoons. Before baking I put sanding sugar on the tops which added a touch of sweetness. I love the flavor of these. They are a bit dry which is to be expected with this type of recipe but I enjoyed the scones.

There's not enough spice in the recipe and they're kinda bland, so the second time I made them I substituted 3 Tsp of Pampered Chef Cinnamon and Spice since that contains everything called for in the recipe. I also used more molasses and added a 1/2 cup of sugar. After that they were much better.
