This is a wonderful quick bread. I took another reviewer's suggestions and made an additional topping for the loaf 1/4 cup sugar, pinch cinnamon and 2 tsp. cold butter and sprinkled it over the top before baking. I made this for a breakfast treat and the whole loaf was devoured. It's one of the best quick breads my family has ever had. Absolutely delicious!

What a beauty this bread is!  I have no criticism whatsoever.  Instead of repeating the layers twice, however, I made three layers of batter and two of cinnamon-sugar.  Then, as I often do with quick breads, I topped it with a mixture of 1/4 cup sugar, 1/8 tsp. cinnamon and 1-1/2 tsp. cold butter, which not only dresses it up but gives the bread a delightful sugar crunch.  I meant to add a teaspoon of vanilla  and forgot, but learned it would just have been a waste of a teaspoon of vanilla anyway as it wasnâ€™t even missed.  Hubs is not generally a quick bread fan, and my intention was to send this to the office with him for his staff.  After one taste (which he pretty much did under protest because he said he was full from supper) he told me to leave it at home.  Whoa.  That speaks volumes as to how good this is!   Like eating a cinnamon roll in quick bread form.  Moist, cinnamony and buttery delicious.  Simply beautiful.

Simply delicious!!!  This is so moist and the buttermilk really does make it fluffy.  It tastes just like a cinnamon roll.  I used 1/3 c. of brown sugar vs. white for the cinnamon-sugar mixture.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter.  I glazed this with Vanilla Glaze by Jamie Langston from this site.  I've made a couple other cinnamon quick breads from this site, but this one is definitely one of the best.

Perfection! The flavors and sweetness is spot-on and reminded us of a cinnamon roll. The texture is wonderful - perfectly moist but not too dense. Followed the recipe with two small changes. I replaced the 1/3 cup of white sugar with light brown sugar in the cinnamon/sugar layer and added the sugar/cinnamon/butter topping that "naples34102" mentioned in her review. That topping is the perfect addition and just adds more wonderful flavor and a little crunch that we loved. My family can't stop eating and talking about this bread. It's addictive! Hubby and I managed to grab the last small piece and hide it to enjoy with our coffee in the morning. This has already been requested as an addition to the upcoming holiday brunch menus. I won't be waiting for the holidays to make this again. Thanks for sharing!

I made this as a request from my father to bake something with walnuts in it.. I'm sure glad I decided to. I did do a few changes: added 1 extra egg for enrichment, and reduced sugar to 3/4 a cup for the loaf, and used the final 1/4 cup for the cinnamon-sugar filling. Added 1/4 cup of walnuts for a nice crunch, raisins should work well too. The color was a beautiful golden brown, and inside the cake was soft, with perfect flavor, while the cinnamon-sugar parts had baked up to a sweet custard-like finish. Spread with cinnamon coffee frosting from this site, ooh it was heavenly. Whole family loved it. This is the only cinnamon loaf recipe I'll use from now on, thanks!!

Just the recipe I was looking for. This is a wonderful change from banana bread. I loved it!! Instead of one large loaf, I made 3 mini loafs with a baking time of 35 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the addition of l/2 tsp of mapleine, only because it was right next to the vanilla I had intended to use.  I thought it would compliment the cinnamon flavor nicely, and it did! The bread is very moist and flavorful! Great addition to my collection! Thanks so much for sharing!

This is probably my new favorite cinnamon quick bread!  It had a light texture and reminded me more of a coffee cake than your usual dense quick bread.  I will definitely be making this again :-)  Thank you!

I have been looking for a good, easy to make cinnamon bread recipe and this is it. This bread is delicious! Even my husband who is picky  loved this bread. The only change I made is to add one teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients just because I love cinnamon. Then I added a streusel topping of brown sugar and cinnamon. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it baked up beautifully. This is a keeper!

Great recipe!  So fast and easy.  I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar in the recipe instead of all white sugar.  This is definitely a family favorite!

This was quite good and I found it didn't need butter or glaze for my taste. Although, serving with a bit of apple butter added a nice fall touch. I made it as written with the exception of using brown sugar instead of white for the swirl portion. After 45 minutes a toothpick came out gooey but before 50 min it was completely done, so that nearly caught me off guard. I layered three times as it said and the top layer of swirl got a little crunchy which was hard to cut without cracking. The next day it had softened and cut easily. The bread was a little more cake-like than I had expected but not too sweet.  A bite of the bread without any swirl tastes a little like plain yellow cake to me. I would probably swirl in the top layer next time just for appearance's sake. I stored on the counter in an airtight dish and it's still moist after two days.1-31-12: I made this with avocado instead of butter and flax/water instead of egg. Still very good but not as moist and a little more dense. But no, it wasn't green :)

yummy! smells delicious while baking. I added 1 tsp vanilla to batter and used half whole wheat flour. In the topping I used brown sugar instead of white. Took 60 minutes to bake in my oven.

This is a great recipe! to make lighter I used Applesauce instead of Butter (the same as the butter, you can do the same thing with oil) and I used Splenda. As a suggestion, you can replace the cinnamon with ginger or powdered juice!

The taste of this was very good but I think if I were to name it I would call it Cinnamon Swirl cake. It was like those cinnamon swirl breakfast muffins. I think I was expecting something that was more like bread. Still VERY good though!

Wow. Ilove cinnamon rolls, but not the work it takes to make them. After trying this recipe I'm not sure I ever will again! I was skeptical about the dough consistency- really thick, but I did my best to follow the instructions and ingredients. I love cinnamon, so added extra to the dough per one suggestion, and also subbed brown sugar for the white in the filling, cutting the sugar in the dough to 3/4 cup.  The dough was much thicker than I expected, really hard to spread and layer, but the end result was fabulous. It reminded me of monkey bread, and cinnamon rolls, but denser. A definite keeper!

Tasted good, but really crumbly.  If I make again I would double the cinnamon  mixture.  This also tasted better the next day.

When this first comes out of the oven, it's okay.  But the next day, it is really dry.  I tried to save it with a vanilla glaze on top, but it's still not that good.  I made mine into 3 mini loaves, and we didn' eat two of them.

This was fantastic! I made it for teacher gifts, using the small ceramic loaf pans you find at craft stores - tweaked the baking time to 35-40 min (and in a few of them, only did one layer of cinn/sugar) - sprayed the pans and dusted with the cinn/sugar mix, as well as added some on top. So easy and so yummy!

The only changes I made to this were to add a splash of vanilla to the batter, and a little brown sugar to the cinnamon layer.  Oh, and I always use heaping teaspoons when I measure out baking powder - I like my baked goods to really puff up.  This was delicious - rave reviews from everyone at the table!

my hubby and kids love this so much. they finished it up before it had chance to cool down. however, my 'sugar-cinnamon swirl lines' are not as definitive as in the picture. may be because i lessen the sugar (new year resolution-healthier food..hahahah). will be making this again tomorrow as it is so easy. note to self- reduce sugar in the batter to 3/4cup (or lesser), do not lessen the quantity of the 'cinnamon-sugar' mixed to get a nice line.

Very good bread. I wasnt sure which cinnamon bread to make a quick one or a yeast bread but this one was so much quicker than a yeast bread and it was delicious out of the oven. I just made one today and there is just a small piece left so i have to go make another loaf so i can have some with my coffee in the morning. My 4 little kids loved it. It did for some reason take a little longer to bake and it was hard to spread into the pan because it was a thick batter.

I have made this two times now...the family loves it.  While it is best fresh out of the oven..it does hold up well, if there are any leftovers.  So quick and easy, for the cinnamon mixture I followed others suggestions and used brown suger instead of white.

This is a wonderful twist of a cinnamon roll/ bread  and it deserves to be next to my coffee as often as humanly possible. *update* Just saw a bread being sold at a large warehouse store for more than $4 (for a single loaf) that looked just like this.   I bet it doesn't taste half as good, though!

I normally wouldn't review a recipe I changed and or didn't try myself - but it smelled soo good and looked so good I know I would have loved it!  Subbed yougurt for buttermilk...and didn't get to try it because the rotten black lab I call my kid snatched it off the counter b4 hubby and I could try it.  SHE, on the other hand, loved it.  GRR!

This was pretty good.  My son loved it, 20 stars from him!  I made these in my square-muffins pan and drizzled glaze on the tops, per his request.  Swapped brown sugar in with the cinnamon (for the swirl) and also went half brown / half white for the sugar in the batter.  I like this best when its warmed a little.  Good recipe to have, thanks!

Delicious!!  Very moist. I love cinnamon so I added some to the batter as well. Also I didn't have any buttermilk so I made some using skim milk and 1TBS of white vinigar and it turned out just fine. This recipe would make good muffins as well.  Will definitely make again.

This bread smelled sooooooo good while it was baking! YUM! I did have to cook mine a little longer than was stated in the recipe because I couldn't get my toothpick to come out clean. Having said that - my bread was a little drier than I think it was supposed to be. I will be trying this again and again because the flavor was just sooooo yummy! I shared with a friend and her family and everyone LOVED it!

This bread it awesome! It was crisp, light, and coffee cake- like. I didn't have any buttermilk so I added a tablespoon of lemon juice (vinegar would work too) to a cup of milk. I also added the butter/sugar/cinnamon topping that some other reviewers suggested and added some cinnamon to the dry ingredients. The bread was done in 49 minutes and  looks like a dainty cake when finished. Don't let the serving size fool you, it only served 6 for me! Delicious, will make this again!

This was just wonderful! I made it last night just to try it. I made it in a 8.5/4.5/2.5 loaf pan and it actually ended up overflowing! Funny as that was it turned out Amazing!  Im making it again tonight, doubling the batch, but I added 3/4 cup more buttermilk because the batter was way too thick compared to last night.  I topped it off with a brown sugar, butter and cinnamon crumble.  
Needless to say, my husband and our room mate devoured the loaf and were begging for more.

This was alright, it was decent flavored...there was just nothing 'wow' about it. It was moist, and went together reasonably easy...but it's nothing special. Thanks for recipe.

Delicious.  I made this in a way to lower calories. I used buckwheat flour and whole wheat pastry flour for the flour mix.  I cut white sugar to 2/3 cup instead of 1c. And the topping/brown sugar was cut to less than 1/3c and it all turned out great.  Less calories, same great taste.

Came out just like the picture.  Next time I will double the recipe.  One loaf is not enough.  The dough is really thick and difficult to spread, but the effort and end result are worth it.  Next time I will try to make the recipe with oil rather than butter to see if it easier to spread the dough.  
I will be making this again and again

I may be in the minority on this, but I found this to be "way to sweet!" Maybe, it was the 1 1/3 cups of sugar. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, with the cinnamon swirl, as others suggested. However, I really wish I did not follow that same reviewers advice and add the sugar coating on top. That just took something already to sweet, in my opinion, and made it that much more sugary. I did not find mine dry though, like some others said. Mine was actually so soft it near fell apart after slicing. I ate one piece but the sweetness was just too much to try another slice even the next day.

This was so delicious.  The only changes I made was substitute brown sugar for white in the cinnamon mixture and I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 tbsp vinegar in milk.  This is my new favorite sweet bread. Thanks for sharing.

Don't let the simplicity of this recipe turn you off (if it would....).  It's fantastic!  It never lasts long at our house, but it always stays moist for its shelf life.  I usually add a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter... it doesn't make a huge difference, but it's what I do.

This is a good basic recipe. I made it exactly as it called for, and it was tasty. However, I don't care for the dry cinnamon layers. I think next time I will add melted butter with the cinnamon sugar and see if that helps.

Sooo good!! I love baking with buttermilk, and the flavor in this bread is unbeatable. No problems with dryness at all, even after a day or two. This disappeared pretty quick, and I already have requests for more! This will be a usual around here. Thank you for sharing this wonderfully easy and fantastic recipe.

This was fantastic!  The batter was very thick so I had a hard time pouring it into the pan in thirds, so I only put the cinnamon swirl in after 1/2 the batter then on top as well.  This was moist and sweet and I got rave reviews.

This was very, very sweet.  If I make it again I would reduce the sugar in the cinnamon-sugar mixture.   The batter surrounding the cinnamon-sugar mixture tastes good.

Made exactly, came out perfectly.  The only thing:  double the recipe and make two loafs!  Also actually, it might be a good idea to try this as muffins to reduce baking time.

Doubled the recipe and filled 2 loaf pans.  The batter spilled out all over the oven and has taken over an hour and still is not done in the middle.  I was going to give this bread as a gift and it looks just horrible.  The house smells wonderful though, so I am attempting one more loaf as a single recipe.  Sure hope this one isn't the disaster that the first two were.

This was very good! I used sucanat sugar for the bread part and used a reviewer's suggestion of sprinkling cinnamon/sugar on top. The only changes I might make next time is to maybe add some nuts or raisins. A good cinnamon quick bread recipe!

This bread is soooo good! I poured the dough in with the cinnamon and sugar, kept it in the fridg over night then baked it in the morning. Also this was a pretty sinple recipe for me but I also have my mom to help me. 
Here's some tips:Make sure the butter and sugar is WELL blended so there is no clumps of butter, and the topping (for me) scrunched up... so that could be modafied.

This was pretty good. I used a brown sugar/cinnamon crumb topping instead of sugar and cinnamon. I also added pecans. I think next time I will try adding a bit of apple sauce and another egg and bake in a 9 x 9 x 13 pan.

I made this for the first time and it is great!  I used Splenda Blend instead of sugar because my dad is diabetic and we try to make some things for him also and it baked up great! This is definitely a keeper!

This was good but I think next time I will just mix the cinnamon into the batter to get the cinnamon flavor through out. I reduced the sugar for a 1/4 and swapped applesauce for butter. Also I think i'll add in raisins next time for extra moisture.

Fantastic!  Buttery and just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar for our sweet tooth tastes.  Had to bake it a little longer than suggested (about 60 minutes) but otherwise followed recipe as posted.  Thank you!

Very good! Just the right amount of moisture and I loved the cinnamon sugar in the middle. I only wish I had made more of the cinnamon sugar mixture, maybe another half. Otherwise, I will definitely make this again.

Enjoyed very much right from the oven as it was still warm.  Tasted like a coffee cake as another reviewer stated but I did not really like the taste the next day and found it a little dry.  Thanks for letting us try
