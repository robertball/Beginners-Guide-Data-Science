This pie has a great, simple flavor, reminding me of a light-textured cheesecake.  I added just a bit of fresh grated nutmeg.  Make sure you use a deep dish pie plate, because the filling is plentiful.  This is an easy pie to make!

This was fabulous!  I cheated and used a frozen pie crust, but this is a great recipe - much lighter than the old traditional italian ricotta pie I'm used to - but delicious and VERY EASY!  A great alternative to cheesecake!

This was my first time making Sweet Pie for Easter and I was really impressed with this recipe! Came out really good! Definitely going to be an annual tradition from now on...i didn't spend the time on making the crust - bought the frozen one and I also topped the pie with fresh strawberries and blueberries. Thanks!

This was delicious. Next time I'll try adding some fruit to the mixture, like chopped pineapple.
