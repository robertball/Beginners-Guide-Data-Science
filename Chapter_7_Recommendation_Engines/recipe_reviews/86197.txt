Tasted very good and different although we eat similar food mostly. One needs to soak the lentils in water half an hour before cooking ( right at the beginning of cooking). I also add all the sour ingredints like chutney, vinegar, tomato, etc. at the last after the lentils have softened. Used crushed sweet mango pickle instead of the chutney. Thanks!!

i used this as a base to use things up in my kitchen. i used three medium potatos, 2 small onions, 5 cloves garlic (more than the usual person!) and browned it in olive oil, then added the curry, then 3 minutes later added 11/2 cups of vegetable stock, 3/4 cup of red lentils, 1x 400 gram of crushed tomatoes, salt and pepper. then simmered for 20 minutes and it was absolutely LOVELY. will use this as a base recipe and will try different vege's and ingredients in the future.

Fabulous!!!  I used frozen cauliflower and diced tomatoes.  Also added one large sweet potato and 4 small potatoes instead of the 1 1/2 lbs of white potatoes.  So delicious and healthy!!  Thank you for any other recipes you may offer.  So easy to make!

I did a recipe search for "red lentils" and chose this recipe because I had MOST of the ingredients on hand. I was unable to find mango chutney and simply didn't have time to make it. I did add some diced, fresh mango in its place. It was such a small amount that it really disappeared into the dish. I think it could easily be left out and wouldn't be missed. I found that the dish took MUCH longer to cook than indicated - almost 50 minutes to cook the potatoes through. I had to add at least an extra cup of vegetable stock during cooking. The result was delicious. I will make this again!

This was very good!  Will definately make again.  I served with Jasmin rice.  One child really enjoyed the cauliflower, the other the potatoes.  Will probably add a bit of cayenne next time.

Used brown lentils as didn't have red lentils...precooked them about 25 minutes...all in all, pretty good.  I'd go out of my way next time to get red lentils though, as they cook softer and I felt the curry needed thickened up a bit as slightly softer lentils would have done.  Might also add some cumin or coriander for a more full-bodied spice flavor.

This looks awful but tastes DIVINE!  I omit the vinegar, serve the chutney as a side rather than cooked inside and I let it simmer for at least 40 minutes to keep the lentils soft.

Absolutely amazing!  I used the mango chutney recipe on this site.  I am so happy to have found such a flavorful and delicious recipe.  My hubby asks for this at least once a week.

wow! this was sooo good. i changed it slightly so i cant give five stars but even if you follow it to the letter, you cant go wrong with this recipe. i soaked the lentils in water while i prepared the other vegetables and i used apricot jam instead of the chutney since i like my curries to be hot, sweet and spicy. i took another reviewers hint and fried a bit of cumin and ground coriander with the ginger and curry powder. other than these minor changes, i followed the recipe. thankyou for submitting such an excellent recipe.

LOVED this recipe!  Husband, 2-year old and 8 month old all loved it too! Flavors are delicious, and it is surprisingly quick and easy to make.  Couldn't find Mango Chutney at the grocery, so I used Mango Salsa instead, worked great!  (I used 3 heaping Tb) Also, I soaked the lentils in the vegetable broth for ~20 mins before adding to the pan.  Can easily add the entire head of cauliflower.  Thanks so much for posting!

Good and I would make it again. I used sweet potato b/c that is what I had on hand -  I added a little ground red pepper for heat along with the sweet.  I recommend making this in a dutch oven - all of the ingredients would not have fit in my largest skillet. I agree with the other posters that it took longer than stated to cook. A nice recipe with lots of room for variation.

This recipe was pretty good.  I made some changes though.  I used a bit of sweet potato along with the taters and doubled all the seasonings.  I'm not vegetarian so I used chicken stock.  The cook time is WAY longer than specified and you need more liquid as well.  Other than that it's a comfortable sweet curry, I think it'd be good with some raisins or apricots, or with some cinnamon or cloves.  I'll experiment with this one.

i may change the rating of this b/c i altered the recipe a bit - i added a can of coconut milk and i pureed it in my food processor and served it like soup - i'm not sure i liked it though... i think it was the lentils - i don't care for the texture - i'd like to try this again without the lentils.

The flavor was fairly good.. though I've made better indian inspired dishes.  It took a lot longer than 20 minutes to cook.  I probably won't make this again.

Excellent recipe.  First attempt at Indian food and it turned out great.  I actually doubled the recipe - it made 6 L and now I have enough for the entire week!  Love the mango chutney - I used Major Grey not the sweet one..

Really good and pretty simple to make. I used frozen cauliflower rather than fresh and it worked fine. I also used garam Marsala rather than curry powder as I don’t like curry powder very much.

Everyone in my family really loved this. I had to make a few subs with ingredients I had on hand.  I used pureed tomatoes instead of the chopped, and subbed one Tbs cider vinegar and one white vinegar for the malt. Will definitely be making this one again!

I don't usually rate recipes but in this case I made an exception - I loved this dish!  The balance of spices is perfect.  I improved it by using half regular potatoes and half sweet potatoes - I much prefer the sweet potatoes in combination with the cauliflower.  I didn't have malt vinegar so substituted regular wine vinegar.  I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious! Did not need to soak the lentils, although I doubled the recipe and it took almost an hour for the potatoes to be tender. Topped it with plain yogurt - fabulous!

Potatoes took longer to cook than the recipe said but the flavors are wonderful.  I like the lentils for some protein.

not super flavorful, but very good.  a mild but satisfying dish.  I added frozen peas, too.  lentils don't need soaking like other legumes.  Just put them in and simmer for an hour.  They were a very nice addition to the vegetables.

Delicious! I went vegan for new years, so I've been seeking out new recipes and this one looked just perfect. I was not disappointed! I followed the recipe but also added extra garlic, cumin, a little cayenne, and coriander. I soaked the lentils for an hour and simmered the dish for about 35 minute. Served over rice. I will definitely be making this many times!

very good, it does take more like 50 min of simmering to cook the potatoes. I ended up adding more of the spices as it seemed it was a little bland. Basically after cooked, just add more spices to taste.

This is a very good recipe.  I did have to make some adjustments for our family.  We are Indian food lovers and like our spicy food - I didn't feel the original amount of curry and ginger was nearly enough.  I more than doubled the amount of both.  I also added a few hefty dashes of cayenne pepper to give it an extra punch.  With these minor adjustments it was great - the family loved it!  A keeper!

I made this tonight and it was OK. I would have like it to be saucier. I added more curry and a little siracha to kick it up. I think that I will continue looking for a recipe with cauliflower and Indian spices. This was not one that I would would try again.

This dish was great! Word from the wise- definitely use red lentils (or else pre-cook other types to an extent), as red lentils will cook at a faster rate than other types of lentils.

Delicious! Spices were just right for me, although I did add cinnamon, just because I love it. I looked for a recipe to use up cauliflower and potatoes. I didn't have mango and also threw in some pumpkin I had on hand. I thought the pumpkin would add color, but it cooked into the sauce, which turned out fine. I pre-soaked the lentils in broth while chopping, as another user suggested. I ended up adding more broth and cooking for longer. Makes enough for an army! I now have lunches for the next week :) Thanks Darkstorm!

Vegan friends were visiting in two hours and the grocery store is 30 minutes one way from my meat and dairy lovers' kitchen, and this was the perfect recipe. The only ingredients I didn't have on hand were the canned tomatoes and the mango chutney. I improvised on the tomatoes by dicing a large fresh tomato from my garden and a can of tomato sauce. I happened to have the fixings to make a small batch of "Mango Chutney" from the recipe on this site (which was perfect in and on as a condiment for this dish). I doubled the recipe to serve 8 and still have lunch for tomorrow, and everybody loved it!! I feel like a winner after what seemed like a hopeless situation only a few hours ago! Thank you!!

I nearly doubled the spice and chutney, but apart from that, it was outstanding and we will definitely make it again.  I used brown lentils, since that's what we had, and they worked well but needed a little longer to cook.

Very tasty and easy for a new vegetarian like me-and I had almost all the ingredients on hand!  I had to substitute brown lentils for red and apple cider vinegar for malt, but next time will try it exactly as the recipe reads.
