This was a hit on Thanksgiving, a nice change of pace.  While I liked it , it was a bit tangy for me as I am not a big fan of citrus zest, but it had a great holiday flavor that my family loved.  Make sure you taste throughout; you may want to add a little more brown sugar.  And, also, I had forgotten that cranberries float...just add enough water until they would be covered if they didn't float.  I don't think you can really mess up this really great recipe, so don't worry too much about that step.  Also, it makes A LOT of sauce.

Oh my goodness, this was incredible!  I've never made cranberry sauce from scratch before... but  no more canned stuff for me.  This stuff was so good I almost felt like eating it like soup!  Got rave review from my family, too, and was plenty for my crowd of 30 people!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This sauce has a very "robust" flavor that was too strong for some of our family - but I enjoyed it.  My only warning is that you need to hold the cranberries down with your hand(s) or something else to determine when you've added enough water.  I forgot that cranberries float and added too much before I realized they were floating which resulted in additional cooking time to get the extra liquid to evaporate.

I'm giving this one star, simply because this is much too long to cook any cranberry sauce. Cranberries become bitter if they are cooked after they pop. I'm guessing that's why the recipe calls for twice as much sugar as any other recipe I've seen for cranberry sauce.  One comment even stated they were planning to add more sugar next time! Save yourself the trouble, and simmer it for no more than 10 minutes after the berries pop. And add 1 cup of sugar instead!

This was my first time making cranberry sauce from scratch.  This turned out fabulous!  It ended up cooking for about 2 hours, but well worth it.  Won't be buying that canned muck again...:)

My mother requested this recipe for Thanksgiving and after a first disasterous attempt in the crockpot (don't cook cranberries in the crockpot!!!!), it came out really well.  My husband loved it as is, but my mom said she would have preferred it without the cinnamon.  I'll be trying it again at Christmas without the cinnamon - overall 4 stars from everyone.  Delicious and easy.

Delicious and a great alternative to canned cranberry sauce. My family was relieved to not see the can-shaped gelationous blob this year. Be careful how much water you put in it, and I like to only put in one cinnamon stick. Other than that, even the cranberry sauce haters went crazy for this recipe. The excess was used on rolls-- I even saw my grandfather put some on the ham.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  Other reviews said it took about 3 hrs to thicken.  It did; however, I think it wouldn't have taken so long if I hadn't lowered it so low.  The recipe said "simmer" so to me, that means, low.  On my stove I put it on "2," but at 3 hrs cooking it still wasn't thick, so I turned it to "5."  It thickened almost immediately.  Next time, I'm only lowering to "5" and I'll bet it doesn't take so long.  It needed a little more sugar than listed as it was rather tart.  Everyone liked it though and it was fun to make.

I've made this for thanksgiving several years in a row.  It is delicious, but also super sweet and tangy. If I make it again this year, I'll probably scale back on the sugar. UPDATE: I made the following changes for thanksgiving 2011: omitted the water, slightly reduced the OJ, used about 1.5c brown sugar, and reduced the simmering time to about 20-25 minutes. SO MUCH BETTER! Because you're starting with less liquid, you don't have to let it cook for so long to thicken up.  I think I could have reduced the brown sugar even further, so maybe that will be something to try next year.

I prepared this several years ago for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. They ask me to prepare it now every year. You'll never buy cranberry sauce from a jar or can again.

I've been making this recipe for a long, long time.  I never use canned.  It is wonderful!  But one year just before Thanksgiving, we ate at a dinner playhouse.  The chef came out at the end and talked to some of us and everyone told him how much they loved his cranberry sauce.  He told us his secret of making this recipe but adding a piece of dark chocolate to the berries as they are cooking.  I tried it and it's as if eating something heavenly.  Try it.  Just a dark chocolate kiss or two along with the the orange...mmmmmmm!

I am used to eating canned cranberry sauce, so this was a real treat. The flavors cannot compare-so rich and warm, with a citrus zing! This recipe made a lot of sauce, but it was quite easy to prepare. I'll never go back to canned!

Great departure from the norm.  This got very good reviews at Thanksgiving and I personally enjoyed it a lot.  The flavors work well together.

Wow!  Doesn't get any quicker or easier. 5 stars from me.  This dish was a hit with everyone and will now become our new 'traditional' cranberry side dish.  I didn't have oranges on hand so omitted the zest.  The only orange juice I had on hand was orange/mango which I used.  Absolutely delicious.  This dish thickens the longer it cooks.  Love it warm or chilled.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe is great!  I've made it three years in a row and always have someone ask for the recipe.  The only addition I make is a little cornstarch to thicken it up...5 Stars all the way!!

best cranberry sauce I've had. I don't like to rate a recipe if I've altered it but this time I just used orange juice to cook the cranberries in and added Manderan oranges and it was great. The people that don't really care for cranberry sauce raved.

I just made this tonight in preparation for the big turkey day. Love it Love it! I have never made homemade cranberry sauce before. I had to step up to the learning curve quick with this recipe. I thought you had to cover it while bring it to a bringing it to a boil. Don't cover it- it ran on to my range top! Okay besides the mess I made, I did add a bit more brown sugar like the recipe and reviewers called for. It took 2 hours to thicken up. The whole downstairs smelled wonderful. It even brought the family downstairs because of the excellent aroma. Thanks for posting! Super recipe!

A huge hit at our Thanksgiving.  I neglected to add water, and just boiled in the juice/brown sugar mixture and the result was FABULOUS!  It set up very nicely.  Was a very nice pot-pourri for my house too ;-)

I've been using this recipe for several holidays now, but neglected to review it.  It's a lovely sauce, perfect ratio of tart-to-sweet, and the citrus flavor is a great addition.  I add a little splash of vanilla, because I think it adds a mellower note, and this year I used my immersion blender, then strained it, to satisfy the "canned" sauce fans in the family. They loved it!

I make cranberry sauce quite often (it is one of my favorite snacks) and this one, by far, takes the cake!  I reduced the brown sugar, using only 2/3 c. as I like a less sweet sauce.  It got rave reviews at Thanksgiving this year and I will be making it several more times for the holidays to come!

Loved it!  Very Easy to make!  My suggestions: the more water the longer you need to simmer.  So watch adding too much water.  Next save 1/4 of berries in reserve until after you start to simmer then add.  It adds to the chunkiness of the recipe.  :-)

This is a great recipe! I zested 1 1/2 oranges and juiced the oranges in lieu of the OJ. I also micro grated 1/4 fresh nutmeg and 1 teaspoon of ground ginger. I cooked this recipe about 1 1/2-1 3/4 hours. I completed this recipe a day ahead of time and it thickened nicely in the fridge. this is definitely a keeper!!!

Very good cranberry sauce.  I've been making my sauce with orange juice and zest for years, but the addition of the brown sugar and cinnamon really make this an unique sauce.  I would probably omit the water second time around and only use the OJ for more of the orange flavor.   Typically I only let my sauce cook for 15 minutes or so, like the previous review mentioned.  This time I let it simmer for over an hour and it was very good, definitely increased the cinnamon flavor.

I look forward to making this every year. It makes the kitchen smell absolutely heavenly! The only change I have ever made to this is to add just a little more sugar at the end. Sometimes cranberries are more tart than others, so just do a quick taste before cooling.

I used about 1/3 less sugar than the recipe called for, and it turned out extremely sweet anyway. I think I may just use half next time. This was a wonderful recipe and I will be using it again and again. I also added ground cinnamon to the sticks of cinnamon.

Have been making this for years and it's always a big hit.  Will NEVER go back to the canned stuff. I usually let it simmer for longer to get a nice thick consistency.

Some of my guests really like this sauce. For myself I thought the cinnamon was too strong.  My mistake most likely 'cuz I stored it overnight with the cinnamon sticks still in it.

I didn't like this at all, and neither did anyone at the table!  The cinnamon flavor was almost overpowering....the whole thing just tasted too strong.

For this Thanksgiving, I've made 3 different cranberry sauce recipes.  This one is definitely the best!  The cinnamon gives it a nice flavor.  I let it thicken up quite a lot, and I think the thicker the better.  Mine turned out a little too sweet, so I think next time I'll add a little bit less sugar.  Otherwise, an excellent recipe!

I lost my cranberry recipe and this is it! This is as close as I can get and I am very happy!! I made this for Thanksgiving and no one noticed the difference. They LOVED it!! I used the left overs to make banana cranberry bread and cranberry sauce chicken, both found on this site. You can't go wrong here!  Thank you so much!!

Super flavorful, will definitely try and make again.  Mine did not set up though.  I think I maybe added too much water?  I don't know.  My first time making something like this.  I had to strain it to remove some of the liquid.  Still enjoyed it very much though and used the left over juice I strained off to heat and serve over waffles the next morning so it worked out great. :)

This is very tasty, but I disagree with the author.  You can TOO overcook this.  I made this twice because the first time, the sauce really burned up and tasted blackened the whole way through.  So the second time, I turned the heat way way down and watched it very closely.  Within just one minute it started to burn.  Thankfully I caught it fast enough to save it.  I don't know what to do about the burning.  Maybe I didn't add enough water, but it's hard to tell how much you need.  You can't "cover" the cranberries because they float!    Anyway, this was very good and I hope to perfect the method someday.

Can't have a Thanksgiving or Christmas now without making this.  It is SO good.
Much prefer the brown sugar in this recipe vs. white sugar in others.  Cinnamon is essential also.  We also add a shot of Grand Marnier (orange cognac).

This recipe turned out really yummy and the color was beautiful.  I think the orange zest made it a little too tart, so next time I will probably only use a small amount of zest, instead of zesting the whole orange.

This recipe beat a ginger cranberry sauce recipe in our family's New Tradition
Cranberry Sauce Contest of 2005*.

It was a close competition. Since winning, this recipe has been served every year.

* With a tradition of no cranberry sauce, the contest was created when a new family member requested cranberry sauce. 

Canned would not do. So, I made two sauces, everyone loved this one most, and it is now part of the traditions.

-- TIP: Also part of the new tradition, this sauce is great stirred into oatmeal the morning after the big day!

I make this recipe every year and it is always a winner.  I adjust the sugar to taste depending on the sweetness of the orange juice and I save a bit of the zest for garnish.  It's awesome and a very nice change from the canned cranberry sauce that used to go untouched on the table.

Very good.  I'm not a cranberry sauce fan but I like this one.  My husband thought the cinnamon was a little much.  Watch how much water you're adding or you'll end up having to cook it forever to get it thickened.

I LOVED this and so did everyone else at the Thanksgiving table.  This was so simple.  I threw everything in the pot and let it simmer.  I didn't turn mine down real low (probably to about medium) so it was still a little bubbly while simmering and it thickened up nicely in about an hour.  We like our cranberries a little tart so I didn't add any extra sugar.  I will definitely make this again.  The house smelled soooo good.

Wonderful! My husband made this for Thanksgiving. It was very tasty served with turkey and on it’s own. We will definitely make it again next year for Thanksgiving… and I’m sure a few times in between. Thanks, Barbara, for a great recipe!

This smelled great while cooking, but just didn't taste too great.  I thought the cinnamon was too weird of a flavor (and I usually love cinnamon).  No one touched it and it is still sitting in the fridge.  It might taste good on something else, but it just doesn't work on turkey.

I cooked this and a standard cranberry sauce with sugar and water.  No one liked this one.  Too spicy for us.  Didn't really taste like cranberry at all.  I guess we are a traditional sauce family.

This is a great Cranberry Sauce.  I did use 1/2 tsp of Cinnamon instead of the Cinnamon Sticks.  That worked just as well.  I did only use about 1/2 of the orange zest.  Yummy.  Another family tradition!!

This is a very excellent homemade cranberry sauce. I do not normally like cranberry sauce, but will make an exception for this! This sauce also works well with about a half teaspoon of cinnamon in place of the sticks. My husband has requested this sauce every holiday since I first made it. He is very particular, so that is quite a compliment.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  What a great alternative to the ho-hum canned cranberry sauce.  I love to make my own cranberry sauce...it's so much better than the can shaped loaf.  This was so tart and tasty and a great addition to my Thanksgiving table.  A keeper in the recipe box.

The combination of cranberries and orange is a great idea in this recipe. However, I made the sauce the day before Thanksgiving (luckily) and both my husband and I found the cinnamon overpowering. So I dumped the first batch, ran out to the grocery store, got some more ingredients and cooked the whole thing again with a fraction of the cinnamon this recipe calls for. I have to add: we both love cinnamon, but it was just too much. The second time around - much better!

This recipe was definitely the highlight of my Thanksgiving.  Anyone who has read my other reviews can probably guess--I used it for my first ever Thanksgiving, which happened to be in the UK with my British friends.  We made this sauce the day before and it infused the house with an incredible smell all day long... really put us in a cooking mood.  I have never tasted a cranberry sauce with such a perfect combination of flavours.  It's easy to make and even easier to make an impression with (I know that sounds cheesy, but it's hard not to in these reviews).  I will definitely make this sauce again.

Start this one early on a holiday morning so it simmers on the back burner all day to "stink" up the house.  Better than air freshner, and stews down to almost a gel.  Also good to prepare a night or two ahead and let set in the fridge. Pretty in a small white casserole dish.  Been using this recipe for two years now and love it.

I thought this cranberry sauce was really yummy, but everyone else leaned toward the traditional sauce that I made. Fine with me...I had plenty leftover to eat myself!!  :P Thanks!!

I am not a real big fan of cranberry sauce, but this is so good. I was eating it right out of the pan. I made it the day before Thanksgiving and I am glad because it took forever to cook. I read the other reviews before hand and I made sure to not add to much water. Even without a lot of water it still took a very long time to cook. It was definetly well worth the wait. Next time I may try not adding any water at all since the cranberrys added quite a bit of liquid by themselves.

My 12-year-old made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  It is the consistency of applesause which was a little different on our Thanksgiving table.  We will definitely be using this recipe again.

Wonderfully easy recipe with tons of flavor.  I used one 12 ounce package of cranberries and halved the rest of the recipe...it only took 20 minutes or so to thicken up.  My husband loved it, and he is not a cranberry sauce fan.

I have been making this every year for the last few years.  It is a delicious old-fashioned recipe with tons of holiday flavor.  I like to slice the orange peel into long strips while the sauce simmers, and when it is as thick as you'd like, remove cinnamon sticks and orange peels.  Yum.

We didn't like it. Cooking cranberries for an hour doesn't sound right. More like 15 minutes, perhaps. Also the amount of cinnamon seems excessive. The sauce ends up being dark and thin (soupy). I've had much better cranberry orange.

Great flavor combo.  I used on ly one bag of cranberries and it was pretty tart.  I can't imagine it with two.   Gels up nicely.  I may jar it and process it next time!

Finally, the Perfect cranberry sauce. Not too sweet or bitter. Texture was perfect, made a good presentation in a glass bowl. Not too many ingredients either. I used frozen OJ, made the Frozen OJ per instructions then added the 1 cup OJ to recipe. Had leftover O.J to mix with my Mixed drinks after dinner!

This is the bomb! I did change it just a bit. The orange that I had zested I finished peeling it then diced it up into the mix. I didn't have any cinnamon sticks so I substituted ground cinnamon. and even after an hour and half it still wasn't as thick as I thought it should be so I added a couple hands full of dried cranberries to it. Let it simmer for about 10 more minutes and it was perfect! This is a really good recipe that I will use again and again!

I never like cranberry sauce until this recipe. The recipe makes way more than you ever need though. Every loved this at thanksgiving and I've given the recipe out to tons of people. Definately try it! it is messy though : )  I love it as a topping on cheesecake. And you really can't over cook it. I think it is best when you cook it as long as you possibly can you just make it more and more delicious with time!

This is awesome!!  I am not a fan of cranberry sauce. I only made it for a party and much to my surprise, I kept on coming back for more! I am gonna make this again for a Christmas party in a few weeks. So good and it makes alot. Two things: after reading reviews, I used only 2 sticks of cinnamon. It was perfect. The other thing was that the fresh cranberries were in an 8oz bag, but I followed the same amount of ingredients and it came out perfect. No need for extra sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out just right. The zest gives you little burst of citrus throughout while the cinnnamon gives it warmth. It wasnt to tart or to sweet.

Wonderful recipe!  I too added too much water and it took 2 hours to boil down but was well worth it and made the whole house smell yummy in the process.  It was so good smelling I mixed some of it in with some squash for dinner and it was really good.  I did add a shot of brandy at the end and that blended the flavors just a bit but it was good before that too!

This was one of the first recipes I found on AR and I've made it ever since.  I've always used light brown sugar, but yesterday made it with dark brown sugar and it was excellent.  Aways use ground cinnamon in this sauce, just adding to taste.

Yeah, so I added too much water.  Next time I'll hold down the cranberries to make sure I don't add too much.  I had to boil it for over 2 hours and then it still didn't seem very gelled - but by the next day it was better.  The taste is fantastic!

Excellent flavor!  I have never liked whole-berry cranberry sauce before--but I sure do now!  I made it exactly as written but did adjust the sugar at the end to suit my palate.  (I ended up using 1 whole box plus 4 Tbl. dark brown sugar) I simmered it for 2 hours in a 3 quart pan, adding one cup of water. It thickened up perfectly after chilling. This was so good I couldn't stop tasting it!  I gave myself heartburn and had to take some Tums!  This would be wonderful as a holiday cheesecake topping or warmed up over vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for posting such a tasty recipe.  (I am taking it to a potluck in two days.  I'll let you know what the reviews are from co-workers). Update: These were such a hit at out party! Many asked for the recipe and wanted to take home the rest (makes a big batch).  I plan on canning this recipe next year to give as holiday gifts.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Great taste-loved the recipe.  But was confused on how to add enough water to cover a pot of cranberries.  They float-right?

This is a great recipe.  It gets lots of compliments.  I love the combination of cranberries, orange and cinnamon.  For this recipe, I left out the zest simply because I don't like it.  With respect to the sugar, I would start with half the amount, then slowly add more.  I usually end up with about 3/4 the amount suggested.  I also don't simmer the sauce very long.  I just let the liquid reduce a bit after the cranberries pop.  It is so good it can be eaten by itself.

I grew up with canned cranberry sauce.  No one in our family has ever been a huge cranberry sauce fan.  I wanted to change that this year...  And I succeeded!  I did add a vanilla bean I had and a splash of bourbon at the end.  The finished product turned out to be a perfect addition to some cranberry quick bread as well.

So DELICIOUS!!!  I did have to simmer for closer to 2 hours,but I think that's because you don't need to add the full 2 cups of water (hold the cranberries down with your hand while pouring the water so that you can really see how much you need).  It was so heavenly...It's now the cranberry sauce of my family's thanksgiving and christmas dinners :)

I like that this recipe is pretty straightforward--wasn't so sure about the brown sugar, but it did end up giving the sauce a great dark and mysterious flavor. ooooohhh. yeah, oh, I ended up putting about 2 inches of ginger in the whole dish while it was coming to a boil--I love that zesty punch. no, I am not a ginger spokesperson, but it is kickin in this dish! try it! oh, and it's totally worth it to juice your own oranges. orange juice! not jug juice! not frozen frosty cylinder juice! I've tried those, and they're just not the same as the sacred naval sacrifice.

OMG!  This was the BEST cranberry sauce I have ever had!  I did two things differently though...I only added the 2 cups of OJ.  No extra water.  And, I did not add the zest--completely forgot.  After the berries burst and cooked down for about 20-30 mins, I transferred them to a bowl and removed the cinnamon sticks.  i could see that if I had left them in much longer, the cionnamon would be a bit overpowering.  Will definately make this again next year!!!!

Very strongly flavoured, so this isn't a great recipe for cranberry sauce purists, but it tasted delicious.  If you find it's too strongly flavoured for your taste, add some water to thin it out during the last few minutes of cooking.

I was excited to try this new recipe for Thanksgiving.  I found it to overpowered by orange flavor and the cranberries reduced to jelly consistency.  I missed the taste & look of whole cranberries in a sauce. I also found it too sweet. I'm sticking to the canned version.

Tasty version. I made the following adjustments for my taste: added 1/2-3/4 cup fresh pomegrante seads and 1/2 c chopped pecans to the mixture after removing from heat. Also substituted one cup of water for oj since the added sugar already sweetens it enough.

Wonderful sauce and you'd never know it was so easy!  I made it last year and everyone's demanding it make an appearance for this holiday season.  My family loves to spread it on fresh gingerbread.  Soooo good!

I just made this sauce for Thanksgiving on Thursday and not only was it incredibly simple, it smells delicious!  I've used it before and always had fantastic results.  I did quarter the recipe (my boyfriend and I are having a small Thanksgiving) and used a smaller amount of ground cinnamon.  The house still smells wonderful and it's hard not to keep going to the fridge to taste the sauce early!

This is very yummy and rich...a little too rich for people who are picky eaters, but I loved it. Definitely can taste the orange/citrusy taste,  and if you leave the cinnamon sticks in the whole time you'll get a lot of cinnamon too. I loved it.

Easy to make, makes the house smell lovely, and tastes wonderful. Cranberry sauce always was a "whatever" kind of side until I made my own with this recipe. Last year I used less brown sugar than the recipe called for and it was too tangy so this year I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.

This recipe rocks! I am not a fan of cranberry sauce but love this. It's got a great mix of flavors and doesn't taste like typical cranberry sauce. Also, it smells amazing when it's cooking, which is always a nice bonus.

Made half the recipe, as this makes a lot! For 1/2 the recipe, I added 1/4 c more sugar (it was tart), 2T brandy, and 1/2t lime juice.  Simmered it only 30 minutes as this seemed enough.  I never cooked my cranberry sauce this long - really good!

The first time I made this it was a little watery but good.  The second time I made this I simmered it for at least 3 hours if not more and it was much much better.  The key is to cook this as long as possible.

I always thought it would be too much work to make my own cranberry sauce, so I just bought the canned.  This year, however, I was adventurous and decided to make it form scratch.  Thank goodness I did.  This sauce was so EASY to make and absolutely divine!  I will never buy canned again!

This was SO good.  The perfect balance of sweet and tart.  However, we had 4 adults and 4 kids for Thanksgiving, and I could have easily made half as much (even for leftovers).  Next time I'll just halve the recipe.

Really good taste and texture.  Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving dinner.  It was so easy, too!  I will never buy the canned junk again. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was very delicious and very easy to make.  I have now been given the job of making the cranberry sauce every year!  As everyone else said, don't add too much water because that will only add to your cooking time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was a great recipe! I didn't have cinnamon sticks so I substituted ground cinnamon to taste. Be patient and give it plenty of time to thicken when you cook the cranberries. My roommate said it tasted a lot better than the old canned stuff. I'll definitely make this again for Thanksgiving!

Good recipe!  Family was amazed you could actually make cranberry sauce from scratch.  I'm all for home cooked food, but I did find resistance from others when trying to get them to eat cranberry sauce that wasn't from a can.

The flavor is rather sharp with the orange juice and cinnamon flavor. It was different, but probably not something I'd do again.

This Recipe was "Fabulous". Everyone preferred this recipe over our "traditional" family cranberry sauce straight from Ireland.  It was zesty, tangy and the aroma - just wonderful! While this simmered - the aroma was heavenly. It was sweetened with Lt. Brown Sugar to taste. We also used a Food Seive to strain out the skins and collect the great pulp and flavors.  Thank You for sharing this recipe - it is definately a winner!!

This recipe is good and I plan to make it again but I will use a little less orange zest.  I thought it was just a tiny bit too tangy.  I also messed up and put too much water in...I think the cranberries had floated and it took about 3 hours to cook.  Overall it was very yummy though

I searched through allrecipes.com for the "perfect" cranberry sauce recipe. I decided on oranged cranberry sauce because it seemed light and easy to make, and I loved the idea of using cinnamon sticks. Well - it was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving! I didn't even have to add additional sugar!

Really nice flavour. I used brown sugar and half the amount. Used fresh squeezed orange juice and some apple juice for liquid. Boiled only 10 min as per cranberry package and let cool. Nice addition to our turkey dinner.

Yes I made it and it took a long time to thicken up but once I got it to the right consistency it was great. I will make it again. Very tasty.

This recipe is seriously AMAZE-BALLS! If you are a fan of homemade cranberry sauce, this may become your favorite recipe. I pretty much followed the recipe to a T, but I didn't have cinnamon sticks so I improvised with the cinnamon spice I had in my cabinet. I can't imagine it changed the final outcome too much. I also added about 1/4 cup of finely chopped pecans. WOW! This is so easy to make. I doubled the recipe because I needed a large batch and it still cooked up very quickly. The original was slightly too tart for me, so I just added a bit more brown sugar to taste. One thing:  If you want this to be a thicker sauce, you need to use a bit less water than the recipe called for. When I decided to double the recipe, I did so without increasing the liquid, and that thickened it up for me, which is how I prefer it. Otherwise, it was perfection. 2 thumbs up!

Ummmm...  Cranberries float so how much water is needed to cover them?  That part was confusing. One hour simmer also was not near enough.

Everyone loved it.  It was the most popular dish on our Thanksgiving table.  Given how unusual that is for cranberry sauce, I don't think it would be right to give it less than 5 stars.

That said, I didn't cook it the full hour.  It was more like 30-45 minutes.

I continue to make this every year. Great recipe!  My added suggestion is to cook in stages.  Thank you for sharing!

Fantastic flavors in this recipe. I added no water at all to the pan. After cooking it down we canned it using hot water bath method. It's good enough to use as jam on English muffins!

2015.10.25 -  This is perfectly tart and excellent.  I have made this a few times, but I never have zest.  Oh well.  It doesn't seem like it is missing anything.  One cup of water should be enough.  You can't "add enough water to cover," as cranberries float.
2015.11.24 - This does foam up like crazy when it boils, so don't use less than a 5-quart pot for the full recipe.

Next time I'll be making a double or triple batch! None of us like traditional cranberry sauce, but we all loved this! I cooked it for about 2 1/2 hours. I wasn't in a hurry because I just had it cooking while I was baking other things. It set up wonderfully in the fridge overnight.

Delicious! It makes enough sauce for about 100 people though so I recommend halfing it. I would still have plenty of leftovers. Also, make sure you "squoosh" your cranberries or there will be bitter bites.

I've got this years Thanksgiving batch simmering on the stove right now! The smell is so lovely on Thanksgiving morning! Love love this stuff! The recipe makes enough for later use and sending a little home for some. Freezes really well too. Happy Turkey Day! Gobble 'till you wobble :-}

My family requests that I make this sauce every year. They absolutely love it, which really says a lot because they are picky with their food and this is the only cranberry sauce my grandmother will eat. Be sure not to put too much water in. If you do you will need to cook it longer and probably add more sugar. Also, if you do accidentally add too much water and you are crunched for time, at the very end, mix a little cornstarch with water to thicken the sauce up. I don't recommend doing that unless you absolutely have to. It does change the flavor slightly.

This is an awesome cranberry sauce! I used 2cups of water and cranberries were floating and it took about 2 yours to cook down. I also added 1 tsp of ground cloves and a little more sugar.  Also I used one 13.5 oz bottle of Simply Orange with Mango Juice. Can't wait to see how everyone at our Church's Thanksgiving Dinner likes it.

Make this every thanksgiving. It does take a few hours for it to cook down, but your house will smell wonderful. You also have to taste and adjust the sugar. Two cups is the minimum.

I halved the recipe but think there is way too much water when you say 'cover with water.'  Simmered it for 2 hours and it still isn't thickened. I'm going to turn it on again and try for another 30 mins, but am worried about comments that cranberries going bitter when they are cooked too long.  It smells and looks great but agree that this seems way too long for a cranberry sauce. Luckily, I have ingredients for another batch which I may try tomorrow w/less water. We'll see what happens with more boiling and refrigerating over night.

Outstanding!  I cooked this about 2 hours as another reviewer. I used 4 ounces more berries than called for in the recipe and dissolved the sugar in water before I added the cranberries and mixed in the other ingredients.  Just before I took the sauce off the stove,  I used a stick blender to dice a few of the berries and thicken up the sauce.  It was good the first day, but this sauce truly shined the second day.  A big hit.  This is not only the best cranberry sauce I have ever made, but the easiest too.

I've made cranberry sauce before but could not find the receipe that I used; this one was very close, so I used this one; the only difference is that I added a peeled granny smith apple and a cup of chopped walnuts. It turned out awesome and I can't wait to serve it tomorrow for Thanksgiving!

I have been making this for about 5 years.  Everyone loves it and requests it each Thanksgiving.  I think it is a vast improvement over canned cranberry and goes great on turkey sandwiches.  It also makes the whole house smell cozy while it cooks.  It does take a long time to cook down to a thickness I like, but I just put it on and let it cook while I do other things.

Follow the directions exactly. Although, I was initially confused by the directions to cover the cranberries with water. I totally added too much water and had to dump most out afterwards. However, I think if I make this again I will probably cut back just a little on the oj. Great flavor though!

I loved this cranberry sauce, but I can only give 4 stars because it was not a hit with everyone. I will make this again, but will add more sugar. It jelled well after cooking down for quite a while. I thought it was worth the wait.

Awesome! This was a huge hit this thanksgiving. It doesn't even compare to that canned junk. It took about two hours to reduce it down to the correct consitency and was way worth it. I have some leftover and I'm making coffee cake with the remaining.

Absolutetly awesome... we add 2 tablespoon of cornstarch to thick the sauce and didn't change the flavor at all.

This was the hit of my Thanksgiving dinner! Toss all the ingredients in the pot and give it an occasional stir, what could be simpler? The only change I made was to add the chopped up orange after making the zest.  It was excellent.

This is the second year in a row that I have prepared this Cranberry Sauce. It was a big hit last year. We love the tangy taste and it is so much better than canned. LOL  We have also tried the Maple Cranberry Sauce and so now we have to have two kinds on the table.

This is very close to a recipe I developed for the CTRC (cranberries are good cancer fighters!)  I also add a good pinch of salt.   An alternative is to also add some adobo sauce from a can of chipotles...  if you are serving a smoked turkey, Texas style!

Very good flavor, I ended up adding a little more sugar near the end as it tasted a little too tart.  I cooked it long enough to gel, everyone liked it.

I started my batch of cranberry sauce first thing in the morning and let it simmer for about 4 hours!!!  It was WONDERFUL.  Note: it was still a little watery when I put it in the freezer for about 15 minutes ... took it out and it was thick and perfect on our turkey and stuffing!  Also, forgot to buy cinnamon sticks so added about 2 1/2 tspn of ground cinnamon.  This recipe is simple, and has excellent flavor ... thanks for sharing.

Made it for Thanksgiving - it was delicious. I was very careful about the water and it still took at least 1 1/2 hours to reduce. I had time to chill it in the frig before dinner - even better the second day!

This is the first cranberry sauce I ever made from scratch and I will never go back! Served this with a turkey on Christmas and everyone really liked it.  I agree with other reviewers that this needed about two hours to cook down -- but I might have added too much water at the beginning -- the cranberries floated, so I wasn't sure how much to add to "cover".  But it was easy to make as long as you budget the extra time for cooking down -- and it tastes really good!

I was looking for an orangey cranberry sauce for my thanksgiving this recipe was perfect!  I don't know how long I cooked it since I just let it simmer on low while I did other things and gave it a stir when I walked through the kitchen, probably about 2 hours overall before I decided that the consistency was right.  It thickens a bit more when it cools as well, so it was perfect, not runny at all on the plate.  Forgot to add the cinnamon sticks so stirred in a bit of ground cinnamon at the end.  It was a hit!

This was a big hit! I skipped the cinnamon, but will try it with it next time. I added a few extra teaspoons of sugar at the end since it tasted a little too tart for our tastes.  From now on, I'll make this for Thanksgiving dinner instead of the recipe on the back of the cranberry bag.

Very good. I used regular cinnamon seasoning, as I didn't have cinnamon sticks. I also added additional brown sugar, as what was called for wasn't enough for my liking. Also took longer than an hour to cook down, but then again that's all preference, as I do prefer my sauce to be a little thicker and less runny.

This recipe was awesome!  And so easy too.  I decided to get away from the traditional "sauce in the shape of a can" this year and tried this.  I will definitely be using it again next year.

This sauce tasted wonderful while I was making it, but after refrigerating for a day (and it DID gel very nicely) I was disappointed.  The flavors weren't "sharp" and it tasted more like jam than a tartly sweet cranberry sauce.  We will use it on the rolls!

Not that great.  I cooked it for over 4 hours and it still was not thick at all.  It was still very soupy.  I put it in the refirgerator in the hopes of it thickening up a bit and no luck.  I guess watch out how much water you add to "cover".  It did make my home smell amazing though!

I got rave reviews both times I've made this.  My only mistake this year was to not make enough of it.  It's very easy and makes a nice presentation.  This is a recipe that will be a permanent part of my family's Thanksgiving tradition.  (And I never like craberries before!)

This was a nice change from the canned versions.  I made it the day before Thanksgiving, and my house smelled wonderful!  I think the cinnamon was a bit much, and I will cut down on the number of cinnamon sticks I use next time.  Will certainly make again though - I think I'm done buying cans of cranberry sauce.  I never thought to make my own.  You know, the cans are quick and convenient.  But now I've learned... there is NO COMPARISION to homemade.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Very nice -- I usually make the recipe on the cranberry bag but this was more flavorful and everyone enjoyed it at dinner. Just make sure you have 3 hours to simmer it so it gets thick enough.

I'm from jamaica and migrated to the states about 14 years ago. I have been celebrating Thanksgiving with my family for all these years and never understood why anyone would eat cranberry sauce on turkey...that was until I tried this receipe. Execellent!

A deliciously different twist on the standard cranberry jell-o salad (with celery and pecans) that our family typically has at Thanksgiving.  This recipe made way more sauce than we could eat, even when we had leftovers.  I also used ground cinnamon instead of the cinnamon sticks, but it still tasted great.

This recipe was a lot of fun to make!  It was my first time every making cranberry sauce, and I loved it.  The orange was a great flavoring!  It was stronger than any other kind of cranberry sauce I've ever had, though, so everyone was taking little, teeny bites.

I made it for Thanksgiving and served the regular cranberry sauce as a back up. I did not need it. I halfed the recipe.

Easy recipe to follow, and everyone loved it.  We had both on Christmas, and this was gone, and the canned was leftover.  I just wish that it would make more of a gel.

I find that if you let it simmer A LOT longer than the recipe says, it does thicken quite nicely.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Made this today to have for Thanksgiving dinner.
I wasn't happy with the consistency and didn't like that the berries were staying whole.   After
cooking about 20 minutes I put it in the microwave on high for about 5 minutes and it turned out perfect.   Very tasty and just the right consistency.

Very very good!  My guests loved it, but don't do it unless you want the orange taste, 'cause it definitely has an orange taste to it as well as the cranberry.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone liked it.  Sweet, but with a nice tang from the citrus.

This sauce was amazing on Thanksgiving spooned over my turkey, and even better the next few days on my leftover-turkey-sandwiches. Plus my house smelled fantastic while it cooked.  A winner - I'll make this every Thanksgiving from now on!!!

This was the most delicious cranberry sauce ever!  It was easy, and the cooking cinnamon sticks made the house smell wonderful.

Excellent flavor!  I had this for Thanksgiving, and it was perfect with the turkey.  I added just a little more brown sugar.  Gave half to a friend and she added applesauce, which was very good, too.  Highly recommend it for holiday dinners.  Smells good while it's cooking, too!

This is a keeper, not too sweet and full of flavor. The cinnamon is a wonderful touch.
