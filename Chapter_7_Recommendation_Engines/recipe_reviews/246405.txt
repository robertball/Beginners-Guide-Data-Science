This turned out PERFECT, I used a course cornmeal and put bacon grease in my cast iron pan that I preheated. When adding the oil / lard I put in 3 level Tablespoons of oil. I also used Saco Pantry cultured buttermilk blend( used for baking) . I omitted the Paprika and salt. Everything was awesome... not a sweet cornbread and very moist... fantastic... thank you??

I made pinto beans the other night and couldn't find my usual recipe for cornbread (I don't make it all the time to remember). I found this and wanted to try cause we don't care for the sweet cornbread. I only had one type of cornmeal so I combined the measurements for that. I also used more oil instead of the lard and I used a second egg. I didn't use the optional items either. The one thing I did do was add a pinch of sugar (at most 1/8 of a teaspoon). I remember Mom always did that and she said it "softens" the taste without making it sweet. The batter was a little thicker than I'm used to so you may want to back down the flour or meal or add a little more buttermilk. I baked it a little longer cause I use a smaller iron skillet, maybe 7-8 inch. Once the top started to Brown I removed it. The bottom didn't burn either. I do have to say the cornbread was one of the best I've had in a long time maybe even ever. It was dense but that was the flour. I am definitely keeping this one.

The only change I made is to omit the lard. I also didn't top it with paprika. Very good! This is true to the Southern style cornbread. Make sure to spread it with lots of fresh butter before eating!

Followed the recipe submitter advice and used veggie oil in place of lard. I don't eat cornbread but my husband said this was great. His only complaint was that it was a bit dense and that might have been due to something I did. I don't know? He liked it and had no problem finishing off half of it at one setting so that is a good sign.

I made this with the addition of a drained small can of corn kernels. The bread baked much faster than expected and it was dry and crumbly. My guests appreciated that it was not sweet though. Iâ€™m at 6700 ft in elevation so maybe that had something to do with it, but I think 450 is just too high.

For a very basic version I used :
2 cups  coarse ground cornmeal
4 Teaspoons baking powder
1 Tsp Salt
1 Cup Buttermilk
1 Large Egg
1/4 Cup Bacon Grease

It makes a medium skillet of cornbread.  If you use a large skillet it will be relatively thin but still tasty.

I think I was a bit heavy handed with the salt, and took it out of the oven a few minutes too soon. Next batch should be better.

Made this last night and it was delicious and moist. I had to add more buttermilk as I had more of a dough than batter. Added just enough buttermilk to make it a thick batter and it worked well. This is a good, basic recipe that I'll use again with some tweaking.

Very good recipe for a non-sweet corn bread, which I had never really had before but liked. However, my cast-iron skillet (a 12 inch one) was much too big--unless I had doubled the recipe. The batter wasn't getting smooth at all--so I added a whole extra 1/4 cup of buttermilk and when that still didn't work, and I still had a crumbly mess, I finally had to start adding water to the batter. Not sure how much water I added, but I finally got it smooth enough to get it into the pan. However, I would hardly call it "pouring," as mentioned in the recipe. And, finally, I baked it an extra five minutes, after which time the color still wasn't golden, but this meant that the hot cast-iron pan had really burned the bottom too much. But, fortunately, it was still edible.
