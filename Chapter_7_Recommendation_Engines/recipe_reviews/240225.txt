Easy.  Tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I must say that the actual cooking time posted was a bit too long for my roast.  I did put a meat thermometer in, but I didn't look at it fast enough!  The meat was already on the well-done side at 25 minutes.  Also, I would recommend doubling the honey, mustard, pepper and pineapple, so you would have more of that yummy sauce!  Thanks!

Made a variation of same the week prior to me making this recipe, here are the changes.  1 - Seasoned the pork loin with generic seasoning salt (~ 2 Tbls).  2 - Instead of crushed pineapple I used sliced pineapple and placed atop the seasoned loin.  3 - Weave wrapped the entire loin including pineapple slices with bacon.  4 - Lined a baking sheet with foil, covered the loin with foil after using ~1/3 cup of the pineapple juices poured over the wrapped loin.  5 - Placed in pre-heated oven at 300 degrees F. for 75 minutes.(monitored internal temp of loin to 145 degrees F. also). 6 - Removed top foil from loin and broiled for 3 - 4 minutes to "crispy up" the bacon.  7 -Allowed meat to "rest" for 5 minutes, uncovered outside oven before carving and serving.

An excellent and easy-to-make dish.  Here are some tips to make it easier and more savory.
1. Use crushed pineapple as previously suggested. This eliminates the blender step.
2. Use more pineapple.  I used the full 8-oz can for a 1-1/2 pound roast.
3. If you have a skillet that can go into the oven, you can both brown and bake in it, eliminating the need for the baking dish.
4. Double the honey/dijon mustard mixture. After removing the roast from the pan, combine some or all of it with the pineapple according to your taste  preference.

This was so simple and delicious! The only difference was I used crushed pineapple, it was still melt in your mouth goodness! Thanks for sharing Pipsy D! Awesome recipe!

So super simple and amazing!!! I did it in the crockpot (being sure to brown off the pork first) and used ginger strum rather than the honey. It was amazing! I shredded the pork and poured the sauce (drippings with with the cooked pineapples blended) over the meat. So juicy and delicious. I served it over Jasmin rice. Definitely will be a go to dish!

It was very tasty, just not what we expected.  We were hoping for more of a pineapple taste, so next time I'm going to cut the dijon down from 1 tablespoon to 1 teaspoon, and the pepper in half as well.  Also, my pork loin was 4 lbs, and very thick, so it needed to bake for about 1 1/2 hours, instead of 45 minutes.  It was tender, used a table knife to cut it.  I spread the honey mustard sauce on the meat before baking, but then blended the rest of the sauce with the pineapple before baking, which worked very well.

So flavorful and moist!! It's summer, so I grilled the tenderloin for about 2 min/side first, then put it in the oven.  I also followed the other suggestion and used fresh rings of pineapple and bacon.  This is one of the best tenderloins I've ever had!  We ran out of time so I just cut up and served as is (didn't puree everything) and it was delicious!  You wouldn't need the bacon, but it was a nice touch.  Will definitely make again!

This looks yummy but it looks like a Pork Tenderloin, it just says Pork loin. People need to specify if its one or the other. There is quite a difference between a Pork Tender Loin and a Pork Loin. I will use the Tenderloin to make mine.

DELICIOUS!!!! This recipe was so easy and so good.  I was a bit hesitant to try it at first since it only had 16 reviews, and seemed too simple to be a hit, but boy am I glad I tried it.  My family loved it.  The sauce is incredible.  The flavor of the dish in its entirety is perfect.  I will be adding this to my regular menu.  I already can't wait to make it again.

This dish was AMAZING!  I doubled the recipe to 12 servings, and bought 2 pork loins.  (They came packaged together and looked like one larger one.)

On the advice of other reviews, I doubled the honey, mustard, pepper and pineapples again to make more sauce.  I am so glad I did!  I blended it in the blender and it was wonderful.

I also found it cooked must faster and was done in approx 25 minutes.  Next time I may try using crushed pineapple to eliminate the need to use the blender.

I followed this recipe as suggested only I put it in my electric pressure cooker for 45 minutes. The meat just fell apart. It was a hit with my entire family, including 2 picky little boys! I will definitely make again!

I doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested.  The sauce is 5 star.  The roast itself was over cooked to my taste.  I served with quinoa, green beans, and a sliced tomato.  The sauce went well with all of it!  I will make it again if only to get the sauce but I will definitely cook it less next time.

Nice and particularly tender.  Will make many more times.  No blending the hot pineapple chunks.  No need.  Fine 'as is'. Good stuff!

I followed the recipe as indicated.  Prepared the sauce using drippings and I personally didn't care for it.  I opted to not use it and sliced the pork and used teriyaki sauce instead.   The pineapple is what attracted me but the Dijon was too strong. However, the pork was extremely tender!

I made it exactly as the recipe except doubled up on the sauce as per other reviewers tips.  Not necessary. The pork was tough.  I used crushed pineapple and stick-blendered it with the juices.  Taste was OK but I didn't care for the texture.  Unfortunately I made it for guests!  I had half left so put it in the slow cooker with the all the left over sauce and enjoyed it today as pulled pork - much better.

My family loved it.  The pork loin came out tender, juicy, and tasty.  I doubled the Dijon mustard and honey mixture just because we like to have extra sauce.  I ended up with more sauce than needed.  I used 2 tablespoons of Lawry's seasoned salt for our 3 pounds porkloin. Not too salty at all for us. Will definitely make it again. Thank you for sharing! :)

Awesome, simple and really tasty. Doubled the sauce as others suggested, added some white pepper to the honey mustard mix for a little kick. Served with jasmine rice & peas. Whole fam enjoyed, even my picky steak & potato only husband!

This recipe is very quick and easy to make and the flavor is delicious.  We enjoyed the pineapple and sauce with the roast. Save yourself an extra dish to clean up though by using your cast iron or another oven safe skillet. I had a 1.5 pound boneless pork loin roast and seared it in my cast iron skillet. Spread the paste on the roast and added the pineapple chunks as directed. I did add double the amount of pineapples because 4 ounces just didn't seem like it would be enough. Covered the cast iron and shoved it in the preheated oven @ 375F.  Removed from the oven when internal temp reached 145F, which was a little sooner than the cook time listed in the recipe and let it rest. My husband stole a slice and put a little of the pan juices on top along with 1-2 pineapple chunks. I think he preferred it this way instead of the blended sauce. Next time, I'd probably use crushed pineapple and skip the blender step. Will definitely make this recipe again as it was quite tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

I browned the loin in a cast iron enamel coated dutch oven so I had to cut it in half.  The cook time and temperature recommended left the loin pink in the center and running clear liquid.  The ends of the loin were delicious, tender and juicy but the centers were still a bit tough.  Next time I will cook to a higher temperature.  The center pieces I saved and fried with eggs for breakfast.

I cut the loin into medallions then browned it in an electric pressure cooker. I doubled the rub and tossed the medallions in it. I also used a fresh pineapple cut to chunks and poured the juice it made right in with it. 30 minutes on roast then pulled the medallions out and pureed what was left with an immersion blender and served it all on a bed of brown rice.

Cooking time is too long as the meat was dry and the "paste" was runny.  It was okay.

I did alter the recipe a little for personal taste. This is by far the best pork dish I have ever eaten and I am a pretty serious foodie.

Delicious, especially if you get the pork just right (which is a little tough without a meat thermometer). Definitely add some chili powder to the sauce, as the sauce was a little too sweet, and season your tenderloin with garlic salt and pepper before searing it.

I made the sauce according to the recipe, using crushed pineapple rather than chunks.  Used this on a center-cut pork roast rather than tenderloin.  My husband and I thought it was delicious.  I added about 1/3 cup of brown sugar to the pineapple sauce before pitting the sauce on our meat slices.  Delicious!   THis is a keeper recipe.

This was good and the roast was tender, but there are many much better pork roast recipes on this site that are done both in the oven or in a crockpot.  Won't be making this again.

My husband & I really enjoyed this. I converted it to Pressure Cooker. I did for 25 mins. & 10 min. self release. I added 1 cup pineapple juice & 1 cup chicken stock only because pressure cookers request about 2 cups liquid  for cooking.

This was an excellent meal!! I had never made pork loin before, but this recipe sounded wonderful so I had to try it. The only changes I made were using crushed pineapples instead of chunks, increased the honey and Dijon to make more of a sauce, and I cooked the entire thing in my skillet rather than transferring to the oven (I hate to dirty extra dishes when it isn't necessary!) I will definitely be making this again!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was really good but next time would follow the suggestions of other reviewers. Browning in the skillet and then transferring to another pan is silly if you have a pan that will do double duty (just more dishes). Save yourself the mess of the blender and just use crushed pineapple. The sauce is delicious so do double up. My hubby liked the idea of bacon on it so maybe I will give him that treat next time.

This was super easy to make.  I didn't blend the pineapple at the end.  I loved leaving the pineapple chunks whole.  I might try crushed pineapple next time just to see what happens, but it turned out well.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I have an oven pan with a glass cover and used that instead of foil. It took about 20 minutes in the oven beside a couple of minutes of browning it on top of the oven. It was delicious.

Made as written using a pork tenderloin, what a disappointment. Pork was good but I've never had a bad tenderloin; however, the sauce was bland and tasteless. There are so many great recipes for pork that I thought this was a waste of a great cut of pork.

This was absolutely delicious, but took about 20 minutes longer to bake than indicated in the recipe.  I used a 1.5 lb boneless pork roast, and otherwise used all the other ingredients as directed.  Also, when the pork was done cooking, I just served it with the chunk pineapple rather than blending the pineapple into a puree.  Much simpler and still very tasty!

Delicious!  So quick and easy!   I doubled the honey/mustard paste and browned the loin in a cast iron pan as suggested by other reviewers.   I followed the directions as given but  baked it on the BBQ, placing the pan over an unlit burner, BBQ lid down.  Although I didn't check the time, I think  the meat was done to recommended temperature close to the time suggested in the recipe.  Will DEFINITELY make this again.  Might try fresh pineapple next time but excellent as is.  Served with Jasmine rice.

There is a difference between a pork loin and a pork tenderloin, if you used a tenderloin, that's where it was over cooked. I haven't made it yet but sure intend to.

So delicious! I realized I didn't have pineapple a bit late in the game so used the meat of one mango instead. Otherwise, I doubled the sauce ingredients since I was serving over rice and it was absolutely yummy, easy and healthy. Can't wait to try pineapple... and maybe apple sauce in the fall...mmm...lots of possibilities. Thanks for posting this great recipe!

Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I read through several comments and used them: browned/baked in my cast iron skillet, didn't use quite as much mustard, and used crushed pineapple. I made baked brown rice to go with this, so both made a very easy meal.

Soooo happy how this came out, I added ginger to the honey mustard mixture and added a fresh whole pineapple. Only thing I would do differently is use more of a glaze and seasoning. I only cooked the pork for 35min, and it was sooo juicy!!!!!!!

very tasty! the only thing I did differently was use crushed pineapple, it was all I had and I made it in a roaster cooking bag. It was very moist and was done in under an hour. When using a cooking bag you have to lower the temp. to 350 degrees, anything higher could cause the bag to burst. Easy cleanup!

Husband loved it. I had only crushed pineapple on hand. Came out great.
