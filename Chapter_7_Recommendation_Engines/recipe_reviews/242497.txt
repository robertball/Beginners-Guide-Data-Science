I grew up in Okinawa Japan where a very favorite dish was called Tako Raisu (Taco Rice)...it genesis'd from WWII and all the Americans on the island after the war was over. This dish reminds me of exactly that one although this one is baked...I am in love with it and it will remain part of our family's go-to meals. I made a few changes/additions: used 1 pouch of Uncle Ben's Natural Whole Grain Brown rice (only one pouch not two as the recipe calls for) and I added black beans and corn. Served with sour cream. LOVE! Thank you Uncle Ben's!

Absolutely family-friendly in taste and speed of preparation. Versatile as a casserole on top of greens rolled up in a tortilla or added to beef broth for a soup. Uncle Ben's pouch rice did not taste chemically or have that weird "processed foods" texture. Now that accolades have been written here's how I view the recipe from my preference. I found that this recipe is nothing more than 10 minute Spanish rice with the sodium content connected to prepackaged foods. That in itself is reason I would not purchase this product but I respect everyone's needs and opinions. If you use this product I suggest "making it your own" by add-ins - veggies olives more distinct spices. Thank you Uncle Ben's Rice for the opportunity to test your recipe and product.

Just not as good as I thought that it would be. It was just okay but I would not make it again.

I enjoyed this dish very much! I would wrap the bake in lettuce wrap as a healthy options and for added crunch. It's not the prettiest dish but quick and easy for a school night!

We thought this was really good! Very quick and easy meal perfect for a busy weeknight! I think if you wanted an even quicker meal you could skip the oven and just melt the cheese in the skillet.

This is so quick easy and absolutely yummy. I did make two small changes. I didn t want to crank up my oven because it was so hot and humid so I simply cooked it on the stovetop. Also I added the tomatoes at the end and not into the meat mixture. I served it as a salad which worked perfectly for us. We loved it.

Turned this into a taco salad by baking a tortilla into a bowl/shell layering it with chopped lettuce and then topping with the rice-beef mixture and garnishes. This certainly came together quickly and I think the recipe itself is good my only disappointment was with the rice itself (which also is very high in sodium). The Garden Vegetable Ready Rice certainly is not inexpensive in relation to cooking your own rice and although it had carrots peas and corn in it I couldn t taste them and visually you really couldn t see them either (we do eat with our eyes). The good taco flavor certainly is there and this is not to say that we didn t enjoy this but I think I d simply use regular Uncle Ben s long grain rice for this recipe and get the sodium under control. But I also have to say that Ready Rice certainly is easy and fast and may just be what many families are looking for.

This went together very quickly and was tasty. I generously scooped the bake onto a salad for a delicious taco salad my husband filled a soft taco shell. Using pre-mix pre-cooked ingredients is not usually how I cook but this will do when a quick meal is needed.

One of my kids devoured this. I made some changes and I would make a couple more before having this again. I didn't have the rice they called for so I just made my own white rice and added a can of corn can of black beans and a can of no-salt added diced tomatoes. I should have increased the seasoning; but I was afraid to over-do it. I also added extra rice and cheese. Since it was a little bland I drizzled taco sauce over the top. I enjoyed it a lot that way. In the future i will increase the taco seasoning and watch that I don't add too much rice.
