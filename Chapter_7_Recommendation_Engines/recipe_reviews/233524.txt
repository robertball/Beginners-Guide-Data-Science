BEST OLD FASHIONED I'VE EVER HAD!  I've been testing OF's at every Supper Clubs and bars for over 20 years--but decided to make my own after receiving a nice bottle of whiskey for my birthday.  I made this recipe (with 1C Sugar and 2C Brown Sugar) and I did mash the orange and cherries prior to steeping.  I used 1 part mix to 1:1 with a splash of Squirt soda... simply delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Of course I'm in Wisconsin so I have to try it with Brandy tomorrow night, but I expect the same excellent result.

Love this! I think the cinnamon adds a nice touch. I strained the mix into jars to give as gifts and included a tag with instructions:

Mix 1 part (or to taste) Old Fashioned Mix with 2 parts bourbon. Serve over ice and garnish with a maraschino cherry and an orange wedge, if desired. Enjoy!

This mix really is good, but the one thing that is completely missing is at least a guideline on how much to use per drink???  Doesn’t have to be exact, I understand that depends on one’s taste, but at least suggest a starting point.  The rating is solely based on taste, as I think there’s a very important part of this recipe missing.

This recipe not only is delicious and easy to make but smells heavenly. I made this I a cold winter night and the house smelled so good! The only question is. .., does it need refrigeration ?

I have tried this recipe and it is better than a name brands.  Although the instructions don't say how to mix it I have found that 1 shot of mix with 1 shot of either Southern Comfort or Brandy works and one shot of Sprite or 7 up.  If you are using a whiskey or bourbon use 3/4 of a shot of bourbon and 1 shot of everything else and enjoy

I made this as is for my nephew's rehearsal dinner.  Couldn't believe the flavor that cam through from steeping the fruit.  Big hit and was asked many times over to send the recipe.  We used a shot of Old Fashioned mix, 1 shot Brandy and filled the rest with Sour or white soda.

Wonderful recipe. I used brown sugar. Taste changes with different bourbons and whiskeys. Resembles apple pie with some original Bushmills Irish Whiskey. Fantastic with Elijah Craig and other bourbons!

I made the recipe just as written. EXCELLENT. Once family and friends tried this, I have been taking orders and making gallons of it. Of  course, we are in Wisconsin...
