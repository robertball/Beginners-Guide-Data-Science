Good inspiration but I heavily altered my version to cut down on the fat and sugar.  I really like how it turned out; the original would have been too intense for me.  I used 1/4 cup of honey instead of corn syrup and 2 cups of marshmallows (not 3).  Plain Rice Krispy cereal (not chocolate). Used 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 3/4 cup of choco chips.  Melted the PB&CC in a double boiler - did not use oil at all.  
*Use wax paper, not foil, to press the cereal mixture down*

Loved these! I warmed the marshmellow mixture and the chocolate in the microwave instead of the stove. I used wax paper instead of aluminum foil to put over the the rice krispie bar part before pressing mixture to dense layer. Super Yummy and very fun to make. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were excellent! I did use candy quick melting chocolate instead of using the chocolate chips. Sent the overseas to my deployed boyfriend, and they shipped well. Big hit, even had people request the recipe.

I am a no-sugar cook, so this was a little challenging for me! But, they were still yummy! Chompo Bars, from Francis Books?

The Chompo Bars get 5 stars for taste, but an overall 4 star rating because of the presentation.  It is very hard to get a "clean cut" once the chocolate has set.  I am going to try these again and cut them before the chocolate has hardened. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Didn't like the combination. too much topping for me and my wife and flavor for whatever reason was just kind of plain and didn't seem to go together very well.

This recipe looked easy and yummy and it was both. I did not use as much of the crisp rice cereal because it was so difficult to mix in. I used about 1 Tbsp more corn syrup, and about 4 1/2 cups crisp rice cereal.  I greased my clean hands with butter to pack down the marshmallow and cereal mixture.  After spreading the chocolate on top, I managed to wait about 20 minutes before cutting a piece. The chocolate wasn't set yet, so it was a little messy, but worth it. I covered the rest with plastic wrap and put the rest back in the refrigerator.  I think I might have one for breakfast.

Like others, I used regular Rice Krispies. I used creamy peanut butter, because I felt crunchy would be too much with the crunch of the cereal. When refrigerated, the chocolate is hard to cut, but I let it sit out for a bit, and it softened nicely! Great, easy recipe!
