My husband is a fan of Tex-Mex and Mexican food, but I am not.  I used ground beef in this recipe, and the mild flavor of the dish makes it a great compromise.  We both really loved it and I will definately make it again!

These had good flavor, the only thing I will do next time is spice the meat up a bit more.  They reheated well, also.

Great flavor.  We really like it although next time I think I will add a little tomato sauce to the meat mixture.  It was a little dry.  I also  doubled the salsa.

Okay, so I didn't follow the recipe very well since my fridge and cupboards are bare but I did the best I could and it came out so very tasty. I used lamb and seasoned it with garlic, s&p and a ton of Greek oregano.  Then I threw in a large handful of chopped kalamata olives, black beans, tomato sauce and salsa.  I only had 6 large tortillas so I rolled them fatty style.  I added feta and shredded mozzarella to each tortilla before rolling.  I topped with more tomato sauce, the leftover meat, salsa and mozzerella.  Oh my goodness it was tasty!!!!!!  I will make this again!!!!

Delicious.  I'm not a fan of lamb mince, but it didn't taste too much of lamb.  The only downside was that the kids would only eat the tortilla wrap and not the filling.
