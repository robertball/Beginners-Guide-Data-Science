Absolutely delicious. I did double the amount of dark chocolate chips in this recipe but besides that, I made no changes or substitutions. The nuts I used were chopped pecans. Out of the whole batch, only a handful remain. This may be our new favorite cookie recipe!

Classic chocolate chip cookie with an updated dark chocolate flavor!  Like others, I found the amount of chocolate chips needed to be increased and opted to leave the nuts out because I was giving these away on a cookie tray.  Overall, very good!

I love the original toll house recipe, I did use only 1 cup of chips and added 2 cups chopped walnuts, that's how we lilke them. I enjoyed making this recipe because I only use dark chips in my cookie recipes :)

Same recipe as the original using the semi-sweet chocolate chips except this uses dark chocolate chips which is wonderful for us dark chocolate fans. Because I did not add nuts (using these for gift tray and not sure who may have a nut allergy) I did add more chocolate chips to fill them up but that's the only reason. The dark chocolate chips are bigger and the bag is a 10 oz. bag instead of a 12 oz. bag. For a thicker cookie that does not spread flat use only 1 stick (1/2 c.) of butter and bake approx. 8 to 9 minutes. The outside is lightly crisp and the inside is somewhat soft and gooey. These are a classic cookie that will never ever get old or tired. I simply love them.

These were fantastic, they had the right mixture of chewy on the inside and crunching on the edges I love! They never got hard or crumbly afterwards, but I keep my cookies in a sealed tin to prevent air from making them hard over a time period. The key is to use softened not melted butter and DON"T overmix. I toss my chocolate chips in with the dry ingredients to ensure even distribution and prevent overmixing. Will definitely make again.

Really good cookies! I doubled the vanilla and chilled the dough to prevent the cookies from spreading too much. I used my smallest cookie scoop. I stirred in the entire bag of dark chocolate chips and then pressed an extra 3/4 cup chips on top of the cookies right out of the oven. The cookies definitely needed extra chocolate chips! (I finally was able to locate the Nestle Dark Chocolate Chips at Target.)

These cookies were good, but not really any different than Nestle's original recipe for chocolate chip cookies.  We still prefer the Best, Big, Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe from this site.  I did enjoy the dark chocolate chips, especially because they are bigger than normal chips.  In the future, I will just use those chips in my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe.

Ohhhhh!!! just fabulous. Make sure to have a very tall glass of milk with these! I haven't made Toll House cookies in quite some time. And these are wonderful. My suggestion is that in between scooping and placing on pans...I keep the bowl of cookie dough in the frig. I also do not grease my baking pans, I prefer parchment for all my cookie baking. I'll make again. The dark chocolate totally made these worth while. Easy recipe, easy stock of ingredients on hand. Super fast to throw together.

The dark chocolate lovers in the family absolutely loved these.  Toll House cookies set the standard by which all other chocolate chip cookies are judged.  These won't disappoint.

Well, if you've made chocolate chip cookies a million times like I have, this recipe is already ingrained in your head.  I cut the sugar in half (you won't even know the difference and it cuts out some calories) and these dark chocolate chips are fabulous!!

This is a great, tried and true recipe. However, I now make them with only ONE stick of butter, and you CANNOT tell the difference! Big savings of calories and (organic) butter!! You can also make them into bars by baking them in  a 9 X 13 glass pan (bake about 20 minutes) using one stick of butter.

The cookie itself was good, but we just aren't huge fans of dark chocolate chips on thier own. I think a mix of milk, dark, and semi sweet would suit our tastes much better.

I really like the Nestle Dark Chocolate Chips, it makes the original toll house chocolate chip cookies taste even better!  I made my cookies too big and they were crunchy on the outside and gooey on inside (but still good) so stick to the smaller size cookie so they bake evenly.

These are as good as the original, but only 4 stars because there aren't enough chips.  I'm not sure if the semi-sweet bag has also been downsized, but I was disappointed to learn when I got the bag home that the dark morsels are only 10 ounces instead of the 12 that normally go into my cookies.  Had I noticed I would have added more chips.  Other than that, they're good!

These cookies are really good the first day, when they are right out of the oven, but then decline in softness the next day, and get dryer and crumblier each day after.  They also are not chewy or gooey unless they are fresh and warm, but they do have good flavor! But, I do not think I will be making this recipe again.

Amazing cookies. My sons are allergic to eggs, so..I used 1/4 cup of applesauce for each egg. In addition to the applesauce, due to their dairy allergy, I used Earth Balance dairy/soy free butter. Lastly, I had to replace the chips for Enjoy Life choco-chunks. My other family members never knew there was a difference. These cookies were amazing! Thanks for this receipe.

Toll House Cookies are the best ever chocolate chip cookies. I made exactly as written. The secret to a perfectly domed cookies is "hand" mixing and NOT overmixing. These are just plain awesome...hot out of the oven with cold, cold milk. YUM and YUM!!!

Good cookie.  I don't usually make these cookies with butter because they spread too much.  But, it was perfect, since I made them in a gingerbread cookie pan.  Very rich and chewy.  Yummo!

I always use Toll House chocolate chips in my cookies! I love walnut chocolate chip cookies! This is a great recipe as is, but I modified it to suit our tastes. I used half the butter, salt and  sugar. I formed them into cookie sticks to match my other Christmas cookies in my cookie platter! I always make these every Christmas!

These are great! I opted for the bar form and followed the lower baking temp and longer baking time listed on the recipe. I'm very happy with how these turned out!

Totally tasty, and I'm not a baker at all!  LOVE the dark chocolate chips because I think anything is better with dark chocolate.  I just dumped in the whole bag instead of measuring :)  I didn't add the nuts and didn't add the extra flour - turned out beautifully.  Taking these to a party tonight...but had to taste a few for "quality assurance."  Hee hee!

These cookies looked nice. They browned up quite a bit. My problem was that I didn't find the dough very flavorful. I have other recipes that I prefer over these. Nothing special...

What's not to like? This is an old classic. We love dark chocolate so the addition of the dark chocolate chips was great. I made them into bars (see instructions at bottom of recipe) and cut them very small to put on Christmas cookie trays.

These were yummy in my tummy! Love the dark chocolate! I did use the full bag of chips (as suggested by others to add more) and I chill my cookie dough at least an hour before baking.

Great chocolate chip cookies!  I like to under bake them by a couple of minutes to keep that chewy soft texture.

These cookies didn't quite turn out how I wanted them to.  I did not add nuts but did add one tablespoon more of flour.  I think this recipe really cried out for nuts--which I would do the next time because the added flour didn't quite make them right for me.  There weren't enough chips in the package to make this recipe work for us, even though I did add a few more.  The Nestle Jumbo Dark Chocolate Cookies were better for us!

Absolutely yummy! The whole family liked them. I made the pan cookie variation because I wanted to cut them squared just to make them look different like the average cookie. Here I am eating one THREE days after I baked them and it is still great! I keep my cookies sealed in a container for freshness. I love the dark chocolate morsels. I saved some of them and some of the nuts to sprinkle on top of the dough so they'd look prettier after baking. Will definitely make again.

It's official! You just can't go wrong with Toll House cookies!  

I made several batches of these cookies for Cookies Across America.  For the first batch, I followed the recipe but did not add nuts.  The second batch, I added nuts but I pounded the nuts until they were very fine - almost a powder.  This is how my husband likes them.  The third batch, I added some Nestle white chocolate chips, and they were a nice contradiction to the dark chocolate.  Rave reviews all around!

Bummer about the chips coming in 10oz bags, not the usual 12oz.  I skipped the nuts because most were being given away.  Added 1/4 C extra flour to replace the nuts and because I think the Tollhouse recipes come out better with a tad more flour.  I chilled the dough for a while because we were baking up a storm and the oven got backed up.  Baked walnut-sized balls on parchment.  These came out great!  Two days later they are still soft and yummy.  Just wish the cookies had those additional 2oz of chips.

Too soft for me, I enjoy crunchy cookies. I agree, the more chocolate chips added the better. I made mine according to the recipe, but after eating one, added several more chocolate chips on top of each cookie. Yum.

I chose to make these in bar form only b/c I can remember as a child, when my mom was baking cookies for Christmas, she would always make these into bars, rather than cookies (that was the only time she would do that, any other time she would make the cookies). When I bit into one of these today, it really took me back to helping my mom in the kitchen baking Christmas treats for her cookie trays while listening to The Carpenter's Christmas tape (yes, a cassette tape, lol)...Good times! Oh, also, I used the whole bag of chips, reserving a few for the top before baking. :)

I used the full 10 oz bag and omitted the nuts since these were made for Christmas trays.  I chilled the dough for about 4 hours before baking and after putting the walnut size balls on the parchment lined cookie tray I put them back in the refrigerator until the oven was ready for that tray.  My cookies did not spread and I loved how the buttery cookie played off the rich, dark chocolate.  More chips would be nice, but not essential.

This is one of my co-workers favorite treats that I bake -- except, I dont have time for the cookies, so i spread the dough in a pan.  Family takes the first (sometimes 2nd row) and work gets the rest!  :)

I've tried two other chocolate chip cookie recipes with poor results so this was my last try at cookies. This recipe turned out good though! I made 4 dozen for a Christmas slumber party for my 9 nieces and nephews, half with dark and white chocolate and half with M&Ms. They were gone within like 3 hours. The only thing I left out were the nuts.

Definitely my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I've tried dozens & this one always turns out great :)  People often ask for my recipe & its no secret!  Nestle has the best :)  3 tips for soft cookies: (1)stoneware baking sheet, (2)don't set them on a cookie sheet - instead place them on the counter to keep the moisture in!, (3)if they turn out a little dry, place a piece of white bread in with the cookies in an air tight container...they soften up very nicely.  Enjoy!   (I skip the nuts & often do 2 cups of chocolate chips)

Haven't tried with the dark chocolate chips. I only use the original toll house chocolate chip cookie recipe with semi-sweet chocolate. I imagine they would be very good!
