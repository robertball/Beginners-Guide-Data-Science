These were absolutely fantastic. I took them to a work Christmas potluck, and everyone loved them. I was a little hesitant to bring them at first, because they look so odd, but everyone commented on how unique they were. They are a lot of work to make, but definitely worth it. Thanks!

Delicios!  I made the pastry by adding 6 oz. cream cheese.  I cooked the dates with orange juice instead of water.  The maple frosting adds a nice touch!  I wonder if my ancestors had something like this due to our connection to Cape Breton, as found by word of mouth in genealogy?

LOVE THEM!!! I use this recipe every year at Christmas for a special treat. I cook the filling in the microwave on high for 6 min (stir at 3). You may need to adjust the time according to your microwave This is a must for your "Try it list". I am sure it will quickly become a favorite.

An excellent recipe. Quite a standard treat in this neck of the woods. I found that if I doubled the pastry recipe, then I can use up all filling and icing. Otherwise would not change a thing! A great Cape Breton treat!

These were raved about. I did read a suggestion and did half orange juice half water and it was delicious. i also used some real maple syrup in the icing and them just a splash of the imitation extract.  I did have a bad time with the pastry,  it was too crumbly, sticky,  didn't work. I used anther pastry recipe and made sure to pike holes with a fork in the bottom so they didn't pop up while cooking.  I'll be making these again.

I was looking for a different tart recipe when I stumbled across this. I made them in 2 inch muffin tins because that's all I had.  I made my own pastry it's a recipe I use for all my pies. I made a double batch, the first batch was just exactly to recipe the second batch I added raisins.  Judging by how fast they disappeared I would have to say a big thumbs up to this recipe.

My Christmas baking isn't complete until I make these tarts. They're so pretty, and everyone just loves them. I use a little wooden dough press dipped in flour to press the dough up the sides of the  cups and it works like a charm. I do the icing a wee bit different: 2/3 cup sifted icing sugar, 2 tbsp maple syrup, and 1 tbsp butter. Divine!
