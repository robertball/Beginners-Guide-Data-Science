learned this as a child , & taught it to mine . The only difference is that we also use 1 cup milk (batter will be thin but thats fine). You can adapt the recipe to fit your pan merely by increasing in equal amts. , but we do not ever use more than 1 stick of butter or margarine . you can use any fruit you choose , but if using canned , drain some of the liquid if there's a lot . My favorite is peach ....I sometimes sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top of that one . This cobbler bakes up into a great cake-like dessert that's wonderful served warm with a scoop of ice cream on top !

Good and EASY cobbler.   I didn't stray from the recipe, but I did think it was a little dry and will add a bit more milk (about a cup) to the batter in the future.  I did sprinkle some turbinado sugar on the top.  We enjoyed this simple recipe.

Ecellent recipe.  Do not skimp on the butter, as it browns and creates a delicious crust on top.  I also use this recipe for a peach cobbler.

This recipe is TOO EASY for something that turns out SO TASTY! It was great the 1st night served warm w/ my husband's homemade vanilla bean ice cream, and just as delicious the next day when I kept stealing bites of it cold from the frig!  Thanks for the recipe...a true keeper!

After a looong day of picking berries this is by far the easiest cobbler recipe to throw together! This is so yummy, we have to pick enough to make two. They just don't last in our house!! I have 3 requests today to make cobbler and this recipe is the one I have used for years and years and people just LOVE it! Mouth watering yummy!

it seems although I followed the recipe to a T my cobbler looks completely different. The blackberries all stayed on top. No other reviews stated same issues......crossing my fingers that it tastes yummy...well sadly this did not turn out to be the case. I am a habitual recipe changer but this time I followed it exactly even though everything inside was saying no!! What went wrong? The mixture ended up being a doughy brick.

Tasted great and easy to make.  I think the reviewers whose didn't turn out right may have failed to use self rising flour.  A little tip, if you don't have self rising flour you can use regular flour if you add 1.5 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt per cup of flour.

I doubled this recipe and it turned out great!  I used fresh picked berries from my Dad's yard and they were so sweet that I only used about 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  Will definitely be making this again!

Mmmm! Excellent!!! Made tonight as a dessert for Breaded Garlic Chicken, Sweet Baby Carrots and Mashed Potatoes on a frankly, freezing winter night. After making all of that I was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy this was. I used only half a cup of white sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and a little cinnamon sprinkled on top. Tasted amazing! Everyone loved it. Five Starts!

Mine did not turn out!!.. Boo Hoo!!!... But I'm sure it's because I did not use the exact ingredients, I used what I had on hand!. I used regular unbleached flour, instead of self rising flour. Also I used soy milk, instead of whole milk! So I will try this again when I have the exact ingredients! I thought I could improvise with what I had, but evidently not!!!

The first time I made it it was ok... The second time I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the berries and let them set over night. When adding  the berries to the mixture the syrup they made adds to the flavor.

It was definitely tasty and easy, but I think it could do with less sugar and less butter. Great quick dessert, though. BTW, I used frozen berries that I partially thawed. The center was still a bit gooey, so maybe that wouldn't happen with thawed/fresh berries.

Following commenters' suggestions, I cut back a bit on the sugar. Used skim milk, only kind I have. Used a rectangular 6-by-10.5 pan, same area as the 8-by-8 in the recipe. Turned out fine and I already had to shoo my wife away from picking at it before dinner.

I used this recipe with peaches instead of blackberries.  I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup because I had ripe, sweet peaches.  I  also added I tsp of cinnamon with the peaches.  It was delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This tasted amazing and was very easy for my kids to help make. We picked fresh blackberries and used them in the cobbler. It was very heavy so if we make it again we would add less sugar and a little less butter. 

We served it hot with vanilla ice cream and it was a favorite all around.

Delicious! I’ll definitely make this again. I adjusted the recipe to match my family’s favorite flavors. The ingredients I adjusted: used 1 cup milk, used half cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. YUM!

This is now my go-to recipe for cobbler and it’s EZ seriously anyone can make this and the taste incredible! My husband volunteered me to make one for his work Bbq and everyone loved it so much it’s becoming expected just sent another with him today! So if your looking for a great cobbler recipe your search is over I don’t know if this can be topped! Speaking of topping, I use #Breyers vanilla bean ice cream to top mine off

Quick and easy to make. Delicious with blackberries. The first time I made it I had 2 peaches that needed to be used so I added them. The blackberries and peaches were a good combination. The second time I used 4 cups of blackberries just because that is the amount that needed to be used. Both versions were very good.

I used the blackberries and had two peaches that needed to be used.  Chopped them up and dropped them on top with the blackberries.  Shook a little cinnamon into the flour before adding milk.  Perfect in 45 minutes.

Delicious! I melted the butter in the pan in the oven as it was preheating; didn’t have self-rising flour so substituted with one cup all-purpose flour, 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder and .5 tsp salt.

I followed the directions completely, I used self rising flour that was fresh... and like another reviewer, my freshly picked berries stayed on the top of the cobbler. Totally bummed right now, I bloodied my legs and arms collecting these berries today to try this recipe, not a happy camper to have it turn out so ugly! We'll still try it tonight for dessert, but I'm not expecting much. :-(

Great recipe. Wow, is this good. I did add 1 cup of milk as others suggested. Turned out great.  I didn't have fresh fruit, but I had frozen blackberries and frozen blueberries in the freezer.  Thawed them and they worked great. While thawing, I tossed them with a little bit of sugar and went from there.  I can't believe how well this turned out, because I was leery if the berries would really sink to the bottom.  They did and I ate most of it in one day.  I know, for shame on me, but.....

Since none of my pans are a standard size, I had to experiment. A doubled recipe (4 cups of berries) fits 3 8"x4" loaf pans. I also cut back the sugar to 2/3 c per 2 c of berries, since my berries are so sweet. I like a little tartness in my berry cobblers! I've also made this with canned prepared cherries, skipping the sugar altogether.
Awesome!!

I made with fresh just picked blackberries and my husband and both thought it was good, but just a little dry.  We didn't have the vanilla icecream with it, but we may try it next time.  I will definitely make this tasty, easy cobbler again.

I think this recipe is fantastic! Be sure to use self rising flour. Also, I used salted butter but will use unsalted butter next time. That's probably the only change I would make. It was just a little too salty. You can add more blackberries than you would expect so don't be shy! Thanks for a great recipe! Delicious.

I have a very similar recipe, but I use 4,not 2, cups of berries for this.  I read the reviews of other Allrecipe raters and thank them for the suggestions to add vanilla to the pastry part and cinnamon to the berries.  Both enhanced suggestions in addition to decreasing the amount of sugar, enhanced my decades old version of this.

I selected this recipe as it seemed quick and easy and I had blackberries to use!   Was taking it to a ladies gathering and hoping it was great..it wasn't.  No clue what went wrong but I made it as written and it was blah.  So disappointed especially when I followed the recipe to a "T".  Oh well...

I made it in a cast iron pan.  I used frozen berries because the local fresh berries were awful this time of year.  Added just a touch of corn starch to help with thickening.  Rave reviews from the family.  Easy to prepare.  Thanks for the Recipe.

This tasted okay,  but the texture was horrible.  It came out super dense, with the hard buttery layer on the bottom. The photo showed batter on the top,  but the instructions don't mention anything about putting batter on the top. There's no way the butter could nicely brown the top like the other reviewer mentioned as  this recipe does not call for any butter on the top. I definitely would not make this again without making some massive alterations like adding baking soda or baking powder or a rising agent to the bottom layer.

This may be the easiest and most delicious dessert (that doesn't involve chocolate) ever.  I've made it twice and came here to get the recipe to make it again.  I've made it with blackberries and with blueberries.  I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter, but that's the only thing I did differently.  Oh, I didn't have self-rising flour, so I made my own:  to one cup of flour add 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  I will make this over and over again!

I agree with Jakalewis. My cobbler looks nothing like this and I followed the instructions exactly.  My guess is that the blackberries I purchased were extremely huge from HEB and I used all purpose flour instead of self rising (at least I didn't see those words on the package).  Maybe the next time I will try smaller berries and make sure that the flour plainly states self rising! We haven't tasted it yet because it is still hot.  But I will let y'all know the outcome.  Recipe was very easy though,  thanks for sharing it.

Regardless of the way it looks, this cobbler is delicious!  And it was the very 1st one that I've ever made.

It wasn't what I am used to for a cobbler. It was more cake than cobbler. The taste was good. I was pretty disappointed though. This is nothing like my mother's cobbler. I probably won't make it again.

Good recipe, I made it in a small dutch oven and it made the edges nice & crispy.  Next time I will add some sugar to the berries but other than that it was simple to make & we really enjoyed it.

This was a winner with me and my family even though we don't typically like blackberries.  The only thing that I changed was that I coated the blackberries with 1/4c sugar before I poured them over the batter.  This was really good served warm  with whipped cream.

It was a total flop for me. The only thing I can think is that the flour wasn't self rising. I had it in a container so don't know if it was or not.

I really really like this recipe. Super easy and quick for all the blackberries I have been picking this summer! My husband really loves it too- he puts it in his oatmeal in the mornings to sweeten a plain breakfast. I added a bit more milk than the recipe called for and threw in a splash of vanilla, it was perfectly moist and delicious!

Amazingly simple and delicious!  I used fresh blackberries because I had some that were about to go bad. This would probably work with any fruit

I made this today and I loved it. Not too runny and not too dry. It was very good. Didn't last long.

Sorry, but this didn't work for me.  I increased the milk to 1 cup (as others suggested), but the crust was kind of gelatinous for some reason.  I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, and it was plenty sweet.  The blackberries rose to the top as someone else mentioned happening.

I like this recipe because it's basic & simple but turns out a great dessert.  Followed as written, it was tasty & plenty sweet enough for any sweet tooth. (I agree with Shari about making changes to the recipe & then scoring it as if you'd made it.) If we make it again, I may increase the amount of berries & substitute some brown sugar for a portion of the white sugar it calls for.
