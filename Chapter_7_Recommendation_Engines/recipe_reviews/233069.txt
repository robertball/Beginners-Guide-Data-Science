Delicious! I scaled this down to make it in six ramekins rather than the 9 x 9 pan (half the flour, half the sugar and half the butter, and left everything else the same - which was the perfect amounts). My son ate two of them for dessert tonight, and then asked when I was going to make it again! This was quick and easy, and is going in the recipe box! Thanks!

Don't get me wrong.  It tasted just fine...pretty good actually...but this was NOT what I was looking for.  When I want cobbler, I want something a little more complex and with a little more depth of flavor.  Maybe using brown sugar and/or vanilla would have helped?  Also disappointing was the consistency of it.  The topping was not crumbly and crunchy, nor breadlike (the two options for good cobbler topping for me).  It just kind of sat there as sweet, cinnamon-tasting mush.

Like I said:  it tastes good, it was easy, and it might work in a pinch; but it was just not what I was looking for.

I made this recipe for a group of friends and WOW!!! Was it a hit!! Everybody came in for some, and came back for more. Yes, as some of the other reviews stated there needs to be an adjustment in the cooking time. I worked with a 7x11 deep glass dish and needed to double the cooking time. But the end result was well worth it!! I will definitely make this again!!

I didn't have any self rising flour on hand, so I followed a recipe here on all recipes, super easy. One of the guys at work asked for Apple cobbler, so I chose this recipe. I'm not a big fan of baked fruit deserts normally, but I really just wanted to eat the whole thing, and not share at all, it was so good! I did share tho, and everyone at work really loved it. I brought it in for breakfast, and the only problem was that there was not enough! Everyone wanted a second helping! I recommend making extra!! I'm making it again this morning and I know everyone will love it! Just don't over mix your batter, and don't use melted butter, just soften it, and you will do great! I love adding my own touches to recipes normally, but don't change a thing on this recipe. So simple, and my first cobbler was a success! Now I'm cobbler queen! Thanks for making me a star at work:))

I did make some adjustments while creating this delicious dessert that I think may have improved the taste and texture. For starters I kind of messed up in the beginning when I mixed the flour, sugar, butter, and cinnamon. I mixed everything together except the sugar and I had to cut it in afterwards. I also added about a tablespoon of chopped pecans to the dough mixture for a but of crunch. I used an 8oz can of fried apples instead of fresh ones which cut down the prep time (but not the cooking time.) I layered the apples and dough mixture &  added a bit of flour as the recipe stated then put it in the oven at 350° for 18minutes.  I'm so impatient i had to peek! And the dough still appeared gooey so I raised the oven temp to 400° for another 18 mins. Then I let the cobbler sit in the oven (turned it off) for another 2-3 minutes before I removed it to cool on the stovetop. I think raising the temp gave the crust a more dense flakey texture than if id left it at 350° and the result was delicious! I used a small Pyrex dish to bake it and the end result served 3-4 people. I even added a couple of oats (oatmeal) on the top because id always wanted to make Apple crisp. The and result was delectable! I guess a small mistake or alteration can make all the difference, and in this case it was a wonderful outcome!

So easy! I actually am going to try baking at a higher temp next time and bake it covered with foil until the last 15 minutes, and then brown it. I like my apples a little more done.

This dish is so easy and delicious! We had some apple trees that produced a LOT of apples this year, so I’ve been searching for yummy apple recipes to use them up. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 glass baking dish and had to cook it for a while longer but other than that the dessert was amazing! I added a few drops of almond extract to the crumble topping to give it a wonderful aroma and a nutty flavor. I was surprised to see that rolled oats weren’t on the recipe list, so I might add them the next time I make this recipe. Definitely a keeper:)

I usually make apple crisp but was out of oats, so I tried this cobbler.  We really liked it!  I used a few more apples, added a dash of allspice and used the recipe on  Allrecipes for self rising flour.  I hadn't to turn up the heat to 375 and bake for about 45 minutes since I added more apples. My recommendation would be next time to use less sugar, maybe 2/3 a cup since this is quite sweet.  Definitely good enough to make again!

A little too sweet for me.  I'd cut down on the sugar next time.  But it was easy enough to give it another try

I made this tonight because I wanted something sweet and I had just bought some granny smith apples. After reading the reviews I decided to bake the cobbler at 400 degrees and covered it with aluminum foil for 20 minutes and then let it bake uncovered for another 20 and the texture and consistency was perfect. It would have went great with some vanilla ice cream but we didn't have any. Will definitely make again.

Very good.  I  used 6 small-medium sized McIntosh apples to get 3 layers,  used 1/2 cup + 2 or 3 tablespoons white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, nutmeg  and cloves and an extra 2 Tablespoons butter  (unsalted) for the crumble. It could have used a little more of the crumble.  I also baked it for 10 to 15 minutes longer to get it to brown.

I made double the amount of crumble because it wasn't enough, and left it in the oven for about twice as long to brown...delicious!!!!! Had it heated with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream, it was a dream...

Very good. But not what I was looking for. I doubled the apples and it turned out great. Everyone went for seconds. I liked the crunchy top, and that's the part I wanted. If I make it again, I'll cut the mixture in half and double the apples again. I'll lightly toss the apples with the flour mixture and sprinkle the rest on top.

Very good! Serve warm with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. I tweaked it a bit. I squeezed lemon juice over cut Gala apples. I used half cup of white and half cup of brown sugar. In addition to cinnamon I added nutmeg and allspice. Mine was not done in 35 mins, needed an additional 20 mins. Family loved it!

I added a little nutmeg, decreased the sugar to 1/2cup,  and increased the baking time to 45 minutes.
This dessert was great and easy!
I will definitely make it again.

This is almost as wonderful as Mom's apple pie. I did cut the cinnamon in half (personal preference) and cut sugar to 3/4 cup. 
I also added raspberries just to make it pretty and that made it especially delicious. 
If possible serve warm with ice cream. Your family and guests will compliment your cooking all night.

This is a great recipe! It had just the right balance of apples and dough. The crust on top does not brown properly though, so I suggest putting it in the broiler for about 2 or 3 minutes to get that crunch on top.

I tried this recipe today because I was looking for a quick dessert for after dinner. This had a delicious taste but was a little doughey even after cooking a little longer than it called for. It wasn't getting brown so I let it cook longer. But all in all good.

This rating is for the topping only. I had a jar of homemade apple pie filling a friend gave me. It was only a pint jar so I added some cut up apples to the mix to have enough to fill a 9x9 pan. I put a layer of topping as a crust, then the apples/pie filling, then the topping. My husband couldn't rave enough about this combo! Definitely a keeper!

I absolutely loved it.  It is light and so good.  I don't understand those who choose the wrong recipe and then give this a low rating.  Just reading the recipe you know it isn't a true cobbler.  It is much better as far as I am concerned and needs its own category.  I will make this over and over.  Thank you for printing it.

So I doubled the recipe because I had a lot of apples to use. It tasted good, but the crumb topping was doughy. I'll try it again without doubling the recipe and see if I get better results

The crumble turned out like soggy cake IMO.  Even the top was soggy, I baked longer and even tried to create a brulee crust with sugar and my hand torch, but no dice.  I won't be making this again.

Deliciously simple! I needed to use up some apples from apple picking and this recipe was perfect. I used an 8x8 glass Pyrex dish, about 7 small apples, and it made about 3 layers of apples, 4 layers of topping. I baked it at 375 to start for 20 mins covered with foil. I took off the foil, turned up the heat to 400 and let it bake for another 20 mins. 10 mins to rest and magnifique!

What a great recipe! Super crumbly and sweet. Put a little more cinnamon in because it wasn’t enough for us in our household. So easy and will be making it again.

I made this and followed the recipe to the letter. Even used a mixer for the ingredients. The flour/sugar/butter turned out with the consistency of cookie dough. I'm adding more flour in an attempt to save it. Would not recommend this recipe.

Such an easy way to use our apples from the tree.  I have 2 granddaughters that are vegan and using vegan butter worked great! They loved it. So nice to have a dessert that the whole family can enjoy. Thank you for this simple great tasting recipe.

super easy. used apples from our tree, so not sure what kind, and I added pecans.  it doesn't bake in 35 minutes, so like others I increased the heat after the first 35 400. I was entertained by how offended people were that it was called a cobbler. Get over it. it's just a good simple fruit dessert. i'm actually making it again - 2 days in a row. I have a ton of apples and now a great way to use them with ingredients on hand.

I am so absolutely mad at this recipe, I made an account specifically to write this review. I should have known better because I've made a true crumble before and for some reason or another  I didn't make the connection. It's a floury mess and has no depth of flavor. Where's the brown sugar? Nutmeg? The crust wasn't a crust. It was just flour. I made the entire recipe to a T and got nothing. My fault for not reading everyone's bad reviews first. Do not make this. If you make it and like it, you probably never had a true crumble or cobbler. There's way better recipes.

Nope. Sadly, this may be my first negative review on allrecipes. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the apple variety and it was a fail. It tasted very flour-y and gummy.  No redos for this one.

Made it following the recipe precisely. it turned into just a mass of overcooked apples and gooey floury stuff in the middle..the top never did ANYTHING but sit there. No juice. no raising. (and yes..I did use self rising flour). Total failure. I ended up putting 1/4cup milk on the top, stirring the whole thing...and after 20 minutes at 400°F, it finally did a sort of crust on the top.

This was delicious. I made it a second time and added more apples since I had a bag that was going bad. I also doubled the ingredients to fill up my 10x6 pan. It was delicious. I didn't have self rising flour so I just added a little baking powder and that seemed to do the trick.

A delicious recipe that I have made a few times & everyone loved!  I had apples from our fall picking & mixed up the types, truly gave it a great flavor.  Also used standard flower and didn’t have any issues.  Enjoy & happy cooking!

Really easy to make and very tasty.  Family liked it better than apple pie. I made a 13 x 9 inch pan and had to cook it for about 50 min.  I kept waiting for it to bubble up, but it did not do that, as it was thicker than I expected. So the only thing I may do next time is use just a little less flour to let it be more juicy, course that may depend on the apples used.  I used a green apple that was similar to ones in the trees near where I grew up; they are a firm slightly tart apple and they tasted great in this recipe.

I know, I know - if you're not going to review like it was written - create your own recipe. However, I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and changed the sugar to 1/2 dark brown and 1/2 white, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and I used gala apples (since that's what I had on hand). I also did have to cook it for about an hour (maybe altitude?). It was amazing! I think the dark brown sugar does give it a bit more depth, but I'm sure it would be just as amazing with all white sugar.

I added extra apple, and I used regular flour instead of self rising since that was all I had. It was still delicious but self rising flour would have made it lighter and fluffier I think.

This is pretty good, I found that the biscuit like topping did NOT turn into a topping i could sprinkle  there is simply too much butter and it creamed together with the dry ingredients. so i sprinkled sugar and flour in the bottom of my pan and i tossed the apples in cinnamon and a little vanilla. then i spread/smeared the mixture over the top best I could. I also used three more apples of different kinds  for a more complex flavor.  also my child is allergic to cinnamon so I made a small crumble as well using fresh nutmeg instead of cinnamon and i think i actually liked it a bit more then the cinnamon (but ill never give up my cinnamon YUM!)   definitely make this its yummy.  I did find it needed a longer cook time (nearly double) to get a nice golden brown crispiness to the top of the crust. i sprinkled with sugar about 15 minutes before pulling out of the oven to give it a little shine and extra crispiness.

I made this as written and it was perfect! It did need an extra 20 minutes in the oven but that was easy enough. Served with vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it.
