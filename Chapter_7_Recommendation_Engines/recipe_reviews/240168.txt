We liked this! I did cut the recipe down and used fresh crab meat that we had from Christmas Eve, which worked great!  I formed mine into a log to make it easier to slice and eat. Everyone enjoyed this...Thanks for sharing. :)

I have made this in the past but recipe was different. So happy to find it again and I think this recipe is better.  Made it for Thanksgiving appetizer and everyone enjoyed. It makes enough to have leftovers for the next day.
