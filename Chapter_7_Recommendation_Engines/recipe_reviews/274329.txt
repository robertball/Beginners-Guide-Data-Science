Delicious. Easy to make up to the point of rolling them out. Even with floured hands the dough was very sticky and stuck to everything. After they were finished baking they looked great but they do fall apart very easily. They do, however, taste very good. I was expecting a more crunchy texture and these came out almost cakey inside. Had I realized this, I might have chosen a different recipe. These are good, just not the hard cookie-type scone I was expecting.

I barely stirred the dough after putting in the liquid and then slightly kneaded it on my cutting board and pressed onto a square about inch thick.  I cut into 24 small triangles and baked for 17 minutes.  This made perfect tea size snack scones.

They were light and rose much better than some others I tried, but 20 minutes at 400 and the bottoms burned. I'd probably try 350-375 next time.

There are wonderful scones. Great texture and flavour. Better than “Cobs”!!

Made with ingredients as listed with the exception of using light cream instead of heavy cream - that was what I had in the fridge. 

And I did not use a food processor- I cut in the butter using a pastry blender. To answer someone else’s question about using a mixer:  this would ruin the texture. 

Will make this again. We love the flavour combo of lemon and blueberry.

I didn't know how to rate these since I haven't yet made them, but they sound yummy.  I do have a question tho - since I don't use a food processor, can this be made successfully by just using a regular mixer?
