I loved this recipe!  But it is much simpler and just as good if you can cut out some steps.  It is so quick and easy!  Instead of processing my own garlic and ginger paste which can be time consuming and messy, I picked up some garlic paste and ginger paste at a local Indian grocer.  I used 1/4 teaspoon garlic paste and 1/8 teaspoon ginger paste (don't use too much ginger paste because the taste can be very overpowering!).  Also, instead of boiling the water for the cashews (cutting out some steps here!), I just crushed up the cashews in a paper towel and put it in after the liquids were poured in and just let it cook.  You can also substitute the cream with low fat coconut milk and it turned out GREAT!!!!!

This dish was as good as any chicken Korma I have had in an Indian restaurant. Two things to note, I used fat free coconut milk in place of half and half. Also, several reviewers mentioned that it was a very mild dish. Well, Indian Chili powder is not the same as Mexican and is, in fact,very hot. It can be purchased at an Indian food store. The brand I use is Rajah. It makes a huge difference to the flavor, but use it sparingly.

Very good.  After the first night, I'd originally intended to give this
recipe 4 stars and write, "Nice complex flavors, but too mild for my
tastes.  Still good, and something I wouldn't be surprised to be served at
a real Indian restaurant."  But the leftovers were even better!  I guess
sitting for a day gave the flavors time to coalesce and assert themselves.

This is a wonderful recipe! It tastes  just like what the restaurants serve. Here are my suggestions: First, I suggest that you season the chicken pieces to taste ( it really doesn’t have to be breast ) with some salt, cilantro, cumin, garam masala and ginger and leave in the fridge for about 4-6 hours. This way the flavor goes right through the meat. Second, add 1.5 times the amount  of spices(except the bay leaf) the recipe calls for when you are ready to fry in the oil This really gives it a nice spicy taste. Thirdly, people complained that the sauce was watery. I don’t understand why! The trick is to simmer the sauce to your liking. The longer you simmer, the thicker the sauce will become. Fourth, add  1 finely chopped jalapeno pepper (with about 1/4of the seeds) to the sauce to give it that extra kick. Finally  serve this rich sauce over saffron jasmine rice

This was good, but nothing spectacular.  It's not as thick and creamy as most kormas.  I would highly NOT recommend crumbling the bay leaves as in the recipe... it would be better to just leave them whole and then remove them later.  As it was we had to keep spitting out these little crunchy pieces.  I used 2.5 tsp garam masala, 1/4 tsp. cayenne, 4 bay leaves, and coconut milk rather than heavy cream (maybe that's why it wasn't as thick as it should be?).

Though it doesn't taste like the traditional Chicken Korma I'm used to ordering at Indian restaurants, it is a very nice curry dish.  I've made it with raw chicken or for a quicker meal I shred roasted chicken from the store and I have even replaced the chicken with potatoes, peas and diced carrots and use vegetable broth for the vegetarian nieces.  Easy to modify the spices for your own tastes - we always throw in a little cayenne.  I do not use the bay leaves, nor process the garlic and ginger but instead brown them with the onion.  Following another raters advice I do occasionally add raisins and they are a nice touch.  To keep the dish light I use 1 cup of plain yogurt and skip the cream.  We also typically serve it over brown rice.

Really delicious and different. I subbed ground ginger and used a garlic press, so there wasn't any need to process them together. I didn't have any bay leaves or turmeric, but I think it was fine without. I also didn't grind up the cashews, just left them chopped. I used fat-free sour cream instead of yogurt, and for the heavy cream, I subbed 1/3 cup skim milk and a few tablspoons of margarine. This probably made it considerably more healthy, and the dish was still very creamy. At the end of the cooktime, I mixed brown basmati rice right into the chicken mixture, and it was delicious. My husband ate the leftovers in tortillas the next day and said it tasted even better after having time to sit. I will make this again.

I tripled the spices for this recipe, but it still didn't have much flavor. Also, it tasted more pakistani than indian to me. It was okay, but wouldn't make it again.

I am a spice person, I want food to burn me when I'm eating it.  And, never being one to follow the rules, I did make some amendments to the spices in this recipe, and added a few extra ingredients to "make it my own".   I used an extra clove of garlic, a bigger piece of ginger, and "heaped" the dry spice measurements.  rather than using chili powder, I used 1/2 heaping tsp of chili powder, and 1 tsp of cayenne pepper to kick up the heat.  I also added some red pepper flakes and about 1 tsp of salt.  In the last 5 minutes, I added whole cashews and raisins - about 1/4 cup of each.  I garnished with fresh chopped cilantro and cashews.  Served this with Basmati rice that had been cooked with whole cloves and a cinnamon stick. My husband said that it was the best curry type dish he's ever eaten.  Great base recipe for someone like me who likes to "tinker". I will DEFINATELY make this again! Thanks!!

Very good and flavorful!  I kept everything the same, except I only did 2 chicken breasts (I just like less meat) and sauteed the bay leaves, then took them out, instead of leaving them in.  I also added a few extra sprinkles of garam masala.  I used low-fat yogurt.  At first, my kids (ages 2 and 4) wouldn't try it, but after a little bit they did, and then they couldn't get enough!!  They loved it!!  My daughter kept saying "I want just a little more of the rice and sauce."  I served with brown basmati rice and steamed broccoli.

This was very good.  I really liked the idea of the ground cashews.  I did make this a low fat version by substituting cream for low fat evaporated milk and low fat yogurt. I did not need the cornflour as the evaporated milk "thickens" with heat - perfect!  Thanks Kira, curry's have never been a strong point for me, maybe my luck is changing.

This is super yummy and not too hard to make!  I used half & half instead of cream.  Very similar to the korma I get at my favorite Indian restaurant.  I really liked how the cashews gave the sauce a nutty flavor/texture.  I will definitely be making this one again soon for me & my roomates.

Just a little note about the cornstarch amounts: you're probably going to want to use close to a tablespoon, not a teaspoon of cornstarch.  Just add enough to achieve your desired thickness.  This IS a very mild dish, so just add cayenne/chili for more oomph... and don't forget to add salt to your taste ( just realized that's not in the recipe!)... otherwise it will be bland.

This is a straight forward, great recipe; and I tried it merely upon it being highly rated. I admit I tweaked it abit and thought that, for what its worth, I'd share what I did to the recipe etc.
I love flavour when it comes to curries! One can certainly get away with being very generous with the ginger, garlic, garam, cumin, turmeric and the coriander!! However, I used cayenne pepper instead of the listed chilli powder (which is splitting hairs). I also added a good amount of cinnamon to the sauce.  If one forgets Bay leaves, don't worry - but like someone else mentioned, don't crush them if you're going to use some.  Instead of cream, I used coconut milk. I also threw in a small pad of butter just to assist with the chicken cooking, plus it adds extra flavour. The 'secret' to any sauce is to allow it to simmer and marinade, which will help it reduce too, therefore thicken on its own; so no real need for the corn starch, imo.
Most curries I've encountered in the US tend to disappoint, but, this one certainly hit the mark and reminded me of being back in the UK.

This is sooo good! I altered the recipe a bit though. I used 1 tbsp of crushed garlic, 1/2 tbsp ground ginger, 4 bay leaves, 2 1/2 tsp garam masala powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp curry powder, and used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. Everything else kept the same. It's sooo yummy and tasty!

By far the best curry I have ever made.  I used ground almonds in place of the cashews, didn't need to thicken with cornstarch, maybe beacause of the almonds.  Served with boiled rice and  Naan bread.
I have made this Korma so often that I keep a jar of the spices all ready mixed.

Very easy and the curry is tasty.  The ease gives it 4 stars.  For some reason, I didn't find the spicy/flavor to catch into the meat itself, but the taste of the curry itself is good.  Used ginger and garlic paste, as we always have it at home.  I also did not soak the cashews and nor use any water.  I also omitted the bay leaf.  Topped with chopped cilantro.  I did not find this curry watery and did not end up using the corn starch.  This was not mild for us, as all our spices come from the Indian store itself and are spicy-full!

This recipe was a great hit. I made it for 110 people. I changed a few things... I substituted 1/2 the volume of heavy cream with 2% milk and added dried coconut to it.  It gives a great texture. Well good job on the recipe. Thanks again.

In my opinion, this is a very good recipe.  To make it better than very good the second time, I added more garam masala and several teaspoons of sugar to it.  I also used fat-free half and half instead of heavy cream and found that the korma was still delicious.

This is a very good recipe, but we did make a few changes to it.  It was definitely a 5 for us after that!  I did not use the bay leaves, and I left out the cumin, coriander, and chili powder, and I used an additional teaspoon of Garam Masala and a pinch of cayenne.  As some other reviewers have done, I used coconut milk in place of the heavy cream, also, and used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  I added some julienned carrots with the onions as they cooked, and about a cup of frozen peas with the cashew mixture.  I served over basmasi rice and sprinkled with chopped cashews.  It tastes as good as the Korma at our favorite Indian restaurant.  This one's a keeper for us!

Good flavour, but a little very mild. Next time will add more spices. Will make again, though.

I have to agree with some previous reviews.  This is currently on my stove simmering and the flavor was "ok" to start with, but now that I've doubled all spices, added just a little bit of salt, and about 1/4 teas of cayenne...It's great.  I also didn't bother crumbling bay leaves and will just remove them.  Double cashews too.  Serving with brown basmati and some Naan from World Market.  Mmm mmm mmm.

I don't know if this is supposed to be Americanized, but it's quite bland.  It tasted fine, it just lacked the flavorfulness of good Indian.  At the very least, I'd add 1/8 tsp of cayenne next time.  It was also too watery.

I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts (we're a dark meat family) and loved the tenderness of the chicken pieces. My kids didn't quite go for the curry flavor, but my husband and I thought it was quite good. . . .especially served up with some homemade naan.

Although I've been eating Indian food for over 30 years, this was my first venture in cooking it. I have to say it was ok. I prefer a bit more spice and thought the recipe lacked the deep flavors of India. Tamarind paste and a rayta would have gone a long way. Also, maybe cloves and whole coriander. That all said, it wasn't bad, just didn't seem authentic.

wow - just finished making this and it is awesome.  it's spicy because i used indian chili powder, but it's not overpowering (at least for us).  i used FF half and half instead of the cream, and following the rest of the recipe to a T. (which is rare for me)  i made this to use with some leftover roasted chicken.  this needed no salt as the cashews were salted.  perfect consistency.  i cannot wait for dinner!  thanks for the post Trina!

My husband has been begging me to make Chicken Korma and I found this recipe. We weren't impressed by the flavor.  It was not spicy at all even though I added a lot of cayenne and extra spices.  It was a good dish though, just didn't taste like korma.  The only things I changed were to add extra amounts of spices and left out the tomato sauce.

Okay recipe, but not so amazing that I'm running out to get the ingredients to make this again. Just expected a lot more flavor from all the delicious aromas that came from this as it was cooking.

I did this in the crock pot (slow cooker) and my partner loved it! Was the closest thing to bought takeaway versions but with the extra kick that I always think bought versions lack. Alterations included: adding roughly chopped cashews in with the spices and onions at the start and cooking on high for an hour until brown before adding the rest of the ingredients, omitting the water and cream but substituting them with light coconut milk. After 4-5 hours the chicken was so tender and yummy!

Great Recipe! I ran out of Vegetable oil so I used olive oil. Added Cayenne Pepper and extra Chili Powder. Used minced Garlic and put the ginger in a garlic press. Did not crumble Bay Leaves as recommended. Added some salt. To make it a little healthier I used Low Fat Evaporated Milk. Those are the few things I changed. It is soupy but over rice it was good. Thank you for the recipe!! Delicious!!! Great Flavor!

I recommend mixing all the spices (plus some cayenne) and seasoning the chicken early in the day.  Let sit in the fridge before cooking, then let the finished product sit for an hour or so to let the spices mingle.  I added half the chicken broth and none of the water from the cashews.  Also, I skipped the cornstarch mix and it was plenty thick.  My husband loved it and said he wouldn't change a thing.  Very restaurant tasting.

I found that it was very good! I did do what the 1st review said and bought my garlic and ginger paste rather than make it. I did not process my cashews. I just threw them in and added raisins. I did not crumble the bay leaves. I also substituted coconut milk for the heavy cream. My sister spent some time in Pune India last year and said that this Korma is the closest recipe she has had since returning. She said it is a very mild dish over there.  I, however, do like mine with a little more flavor so I doubled the spices and added a little cayenne pepper. The dish gets better the longer it sits. I never make it unless I can let it sit at least 8 hours. I just get up in the morning, before my 1 year old wakes, make dinner and then let it sit all day.

Loved this...did as others suggested and cut corners with the steps...definite keeper - making again this weekend..YUM...UPDATE: Made this several times now....(1) Substitute creme fraiche and coconut milk for cream/yoghurt - works just as good and saves a few calories (2) Shred the chicken - really works well (3) Indian chili powder can be hard to get so just add crushed chilli/red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit to your own preference (4) Add raisins - adds a sweet/tang to the dish which works great (5) Add a little more cornflour than suggested to thicken up the sauce  (6) I also add mushrooms just coz I like them....all in all I will be making this again and again and again....we're hooked!!

My husband liked this a lot but it's a little bland for me. I would add more spices to make it more flavourful. I added potatoes, carrots, and peas.

There is no "traditional Indian chicken korma."  For one thing, like many of the Indian dishes we enjoy, it was created for the Western palate. For another, korma is always individualized. It smelled amazing while cooking, but ended up tasting far less flavorful than the scent had me expecting. It was better the second day, but still... didn't really taste like much. I may try marinating the meat next time. All of my spices are new, so I know  that wasn't the issue. If only I could figure out how to make it taste like it smelled...

Great recipe!  I added more cornstarch and a bit of flour to thicken the suace.  Also very good if you save some whole cashews to throw in at the end -and great with some extra red pepper for spice.

One of the best Indian recipes I've tried on All Recipes! I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream and omitted the broth so that I didn't have to add maïzena. Just perfect!

Really good!  I've never cooked Indian food before, I knew I was in love when I got a whiff of the blended fresh garlic and ginger. I didn't have cashews, but did have a packet of the oven roasted almonds, I processed those with fat free half/half and yogurt, worked out great.  Next time, we probably would use a jar of sliced tomatoes, rather than sauce, just to "chunk" it up some.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was not...as was my family were not fans of this. It seems to be missing a 'kick'. The texture was a little off as well. We are not big Indian food fans and maybe this dish just helped to prove that fact.

A little bland, would have been better I think with less  cream/yoghurt to the amount of spice, because it ended up very mild, despite what seems like a lot of spices.

This recipe made a nice curry but it WASN'T chicken korma.  I've had real korma at more indian restraunts than i can count; there are always subtle variations in it but in general, a certain taste that always makes it chicken korma wasn't present in this recipe.  I made a few changes to it that helped, but the end result was a nice Indian inspired curry, not korma.  
I suggest adding a tablespoon of mango chutney stirred in at the end, a 1/4 C of sugar, and a bit more garam masala than called for. 
I probably will not make this recipe again.

I will use 1/2 cup tomato sauce next time and add salt. Also I used coconut cream instead or heavy cream and thickened the sauce with 1 tbsp corn starch instead of 1 tsp.  Also used whole bay leaves and removed at end. Used minced garlic and ginger and added to the pan instead of using the paste.

I've made this recipe several times now, and although the original ingredients produce a wonderful result, I found that, for my own taste and that of my kitchen produce devotees, making a few changes has literally put the "cherry on top" for us!

The changes/additions I made are as follows ...

Instead of cashews I used smashed up flaked almonds (around 2-4mm pieces).

I included around 20g of dessicated coconut per portion (used together with the smashed almonds).

Instead of cornflower, I used pre-cooked, buttered mashed potato to thicken the sauce.

Instead of water I used coconut milk.

I added a tin of chopped tomatoes.

I also allowed enough time to gently brown the onions at the beginning to add another detectable dimension.

Then the secret ingredient ... one generous tablespoon of apricot jam (to add a deep richness, try adding this in while sealing the meat and allow to slightly caramelise, or nearer the end for straightforward sweetness).

That's it, but mind you, I was cooking for 8, so you'll need to scale-up the amount of chicken to suit.

Thanks Trina, you gave me a brilliant head start on a really successful dish.

There is something missing from this recipe, coconut milk perhaps.  It was ok, but nothing like what we get at the local Indian restaurant.  I even added more spices, but still thought it was bland.  I think it needs to sit for a day for the flavors to blend more.

This was wonderful! I followed the recipe to the letter, as I always do the first time I try something. The only thing I will do differently next time is to let it simmer for about 20 minutes more, on the lowest heat setting. I had a second helping 20-30 minutes after it had finished cooking, and the extra time just pushed it right over the top. Still excellent with 15 minutes of simmering though, if you don't have time.

Hubbie said he really liked it.  I thought it just a tad bland when compared to the Vegetarian Korma recipe from this site.  I did add a jalapeno bc i had one I needed to use up and I had to sub arrowroot powder for the corn starch bc I was out.  Think I will use chicken thighs next time.

Absolutely great!
I've cooked this so many times, and it's always beautiful. I don't change anything either.
Works equally well with Vegetables if you don't eat meat.
Really quick and easy, particularly if you have a small blender.

We loved this recipe! I have never eaten chicken Korma though, but my Indian neighbor who cooks from scratch everyday said it was good. :-)

I followed Tiffany's advice and seasoned the meat the night before with some of the the spices listed on the recipe & some salt. 

 I added 1.5 times the amount of spices (except bay leaf & turmeric). Since I don't have Indian chili,  I will add 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper next time. 

I increased the garlic to 5 cloves, the ginger to 1 inch, 1/2 cup of cashews (1/4 ground and 1/4 whole)  and I used 1 cup of coconut milk instead of the heavy cream and yogurt. I added more salt at the end and I didn't bother putting the coconut milk in the food processor. I also didn't crumble the bay leaf.

Thanks to Trina & all the awesome reviewers, this is a keeper!

For those who like a creamy and spicier korma, I would suggest adding more cream and chili pepper. i even put in some sriracha.

OMG this was delicious!  Even my husband really enjoyed it!  I followed the directions exactly and served over cinnamon-scented basmati rice (throw a cin stick in while the rice cooks).  I went back for seconds, which I rarely do at dinner!

I thought this was a great recipe! I had never made Indian food before, but have had it plenty. This was relatively easy and had great results. I doubled the sauce and added carrots and potatoes. I also did a tbs of each spice instead of 2 tsp when doubling as other reviewers said it needed more flavor. Served over brown basmati rice with cilantro in it. I will definitely make this again!

Very good but I would submit that you need to add some salt (I salted the chicken as well as added a little to the sauce.)  Also the recipe calls for 1 tsp of chili powder - in Indian cooking chili powder is very hot (similar to cayenne if not hotter.) If you don't want it spicy don't add the full teaspoon.   Kormas I've had in restaurants are usually not that spicy at all.

This recipe was ok.  It was definitely lacking something and I couldn't place it. Just wasn't as flavorful as the Korma I can find around town.  Followed directions and ingredients to a T.

Overall it is a nice tasty dish. But it has no "kick" to it. It's just nice, not fantastic or mouthwatering like some other Indian food I cook. You need to AT LEAST double the spices except for turmeric (might get bitter). I even had to add some salt. The next time I will make it I will not add any chicken stock a all. I also added 1/4 cup of coconut milk to add a little sweetness.

I served this over brown jasmine rice. Instead of heavy cream, I just used 1 entire cup of plain yougurt. I added a couple dashes of cayenne to give it some spice. Really good... a milder, yet packed with spice, Indian curry. Nice!

Fabulous!  Switched cream to coconut milk.  Added 1tsp cinnamon and 1tsp curry powder.  Added more cashew nuts insetad of corn starch. Really easy if you buy ginger and garlic pastes.  This is very very close to eating out - and so much more affordable!

This recipe did not taste like the chicken korma that I anticipated (that which is served in Indian restaurants). It took me 2 hours to prepare it, start to finish, and I don't consider myself a novice in the kitchen. The flavor overall was just okay. I will not be making this again. (The only variation I made to the recipe was substituting fat free half and half for the heavy cream.)

I give this a 4 star rating ONLY because we made this exactly with exception of cashews. The flavor was good but not very strong. Just enough to notice a slight taste. I just read some other reviews and agree that the spices amount is not enough. Will retry this again though!

Wonderful taste! If you have a Pujabi grocery nearby you can buy the ginger and garlic in a paste form. Use teaspoon of paste and three teaspoons of garlic. I did not use the bay leaf and be careful with the chili powder (mexican chili powder is far weaker, so if you are using indian spices the chili powder is very potent) Went with the recommendation to use coconut milk instead of heavy cream and yogurt and omitted the cornstarch. This was delish and the gravy was pefect with Naan.

Even only making this recipe halfway, it tasted great.  I left out the ginger and the cashew-cream sauce, and merely cooked the chicken in spices, tomato sauce, and broth.  I also added the yogurt in when I was ready to eat, so that I could get a nice contrast of hot and cold.  Very good.  Next time, I would try it with the sauce and sub coconut milk for the cream, as a few reviewers suggest.

I just made this, and we liked it!  I substituted peanuts for the cashews and table cream for the heavy cream, because that's what we had.  Also, we did not have "masala" so I put some "asian spice" along with nutmeg and cinnamon and I feel that it turned out well.

Awesome!  Even my 18 month old scarfed it down!  I used ground ginger, 1/2&1/2,  and didn't have turmeric and it was still mouth watering  (Even better the next day)!

Followed the recipe to the letter and this dish is OK, but lacking any pizazz. I expected a rich flavor with all the spices, but decidedly this dish is just OK. I have children, and they didn't care for it, it looks ugly. My children are age 5, 5, and 8. My 8 yo thought it was OK. Husband said it was OK, nothing to write home about.

It was ok. I've definitely had better. This is a mild version. Not as fragrant or flavorful as some Indian restaurant versions. I wish I knew the secret.

This sauce is absolutely delicious! I've tried many of the Indian recipes on this site, and this is one of my favorites. Next time I will reduce the amount of chicken and add a variety of veggies to give the meal more flavor, texture, and color.

It's ace!  I've never had Korma  before (never seemed to like Indian cousine) but this is brilliant I have used coconut milk instead of cream which has added that extra umpf! Thank's for that recipe!

I'm white with a low tolerance for spice, but I thought it could use more.  I used precooked, seasoned chicken (previously made & frozen) and it was still wonderful.  Used 4-5 deboned chicken thighs, and it was just right for the amount of chicken called for.  Might have used a bit more.  I also ground up the cashews with the ginger/garlic (accidentally) and had an almond/cashew mix.  Boyfriend (who is Indian) really liked it.

This was not a good chicken korma. I wouldn't even call it that. It was very a very bland, marinated chicken dish. It did not have the flavors that I would expect from an Indian dish. My husband thought it was still OK on its own, but I will not be making it again. Too labor-intensive for such a bland, uncharacteristic dish.

This is an O.K. chicken dish.  If you want Indian food, do not make it. It doesn't taste like Chicken korma, and it's a lot of work too. My husband and I were disappointed.

I thought this recipe was quite bland.  I'm not sure if I am so used to spicy Indian food, but it really had no flavor.

This smelled heavenly while simmering, but unfortunately we found it completely bland upon tasting.  I can't figure it out.  Given the amounts and kinds of spices in the recipe, this should have been very flavorful, and I did make it as stated, except for leaving the cashews out due to a nut allergy in the family.  Adding salt at the table helped, but not all that much.

This was a very tasty and easy dish that I will make again. I did make some changes, however. I added 1 cup of diced potatoes and 1 cup of chopped carrots because I wanted a one dish meal. I would have added peas if I had them. I like a lot of sauce so I increased the broth to 2 cups. I used half and half instead of cream and put in 1 cup half and half and 1 cup of yogurt. I served it all over steamed rice. Yummy!

As with all stews/soups, this needs to be made at least a few hours ahead to let the seasonings blend.  I did change things a bit.  I only used 2 tsp. oil (and added 1/4 cup water to replace the oil.)   I simply ground my cashews in a coffee grinder without the water.  (I have one set aside for grinding anything but coffee.) I used fresh ginger paste and a garlic press for the garlic.  Therefore, I didn't have to clean my food processor.  I added 2 1/2 cups more low-sodium chicken broth and 1/4 cup cornstarch to give it more sauce.  I used milk instead of cream fat-free yogurt. I also added golden raisins. I served it atop basmati rice alongside steamed peas.  I garnished it with fresh chopped cilantro & sliced almonds.  Delicious!

Great Indian taste. I sauteed the chicken separately then added the chicken in the end, so the chicken didn't dry out. I doubled the spices including the ginger and garlic. I used milk instead of heavy cream. I found the heavy cream really unnecessary, since the korma was already rich enough.  I didn't bother to crumble the bay leaves; just use whole bay leaves and remove the leaves afterward. The heat of the korma is great on a cold winter night.

We will make this recipe again!  The changes we made (to try to mimic our favorite local Indian restaurant):

- Use coconut milk instead of cream
- 2 tsp sugar (added with liquids)
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (or to taste for heat)
While it was simmering (during the 'fiddle phase', trying to get the perfect flavor), we added about 3 tablespoons cream (for mouth-feel) and used a hand-held blender (irreplaceable in the kitchen!) to puree about 1/3 of the mixture to thicken, and we simmered for closer to 30 mins than 15 for the final stretch.  Half of the recommended cornstarch was used.  Thickness is perfect.

We are letting the mixture sit in the refrigerator overnight - I will give this dish 5 stars if it shines like I think it might.

*Note - for those not wanting to use sugar, try adding 1/2 cup of golden raisins.  That will be our next recipe addition when we try again.

Tried this with tofu and vegetables, which came out with a strong smell of spices yet bland.  Might be better with chicken and cream.

With a few tweaks, this was easily the best chicken Korma I have ever tasted. As written it was too bland for our tastes, and I ended up adding quite a lot more spice (not the chilli powder though - Korma isn't supposed to be spicy). The only other changes I made were to omit the cornstarch - it was plenty thick already. Also, I just roughly chopped the cashews, and threw them in. This was absolutely amazing served over basmati rice with paratha. Thanks, Trina!

The flavor of this Chicken Korma is five stars. My hubby and daughter both raved about it, but we all adore Indian food. I did simplify as others suggested. I didn't put the cashews in water, just chopped them up very fine and stirred them right before I added the yogurt. Instead of pureeing garlic cloves and fresh ginger root, I used jarred minced garlic and ginger paste. I skipped the bay leaves. I sauteed the spices for 1 minute before adding the chicken. I used all plain yogurt rather than the half cup of heavy cream and put in about a tablespoon of Smart Balance at the very end. Also threw in a handful of raisins to help balance the spiciness. Served it over basmati rice. Will make sure I have some naan to go with it next time to soak up all the yummy sauce!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I substituted cayenne pepper since I don't have any Indian chili pepper, and added lots of fresh parsley. Also, I prepared this dish the night before and reheated it the next day. The flavours have time to blend...

I am a huge fan of Korma, and I have been looking for a couple of years now for one that resembles the version I eat at my favorite Indian restaurant back home.  This is the closest I've found... the flavor is incredible, and it's very easy to make!

What a great recipe! It was a huge hit in my house last night. I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream (didn't have any) and 2 heaping tbsp. of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce. I also used powdered ginger since I didn't have fresh on hand. I didn't use the cornstarch at all. I eyeballed all the other ingredients for measurements and ended up with a wonderfully thick creamy dish. Served with any style of Indian rice this is a perfect dish.

This is the best Korma I have ever made. My husband loved it. It was just spot on. I didn't have any yogart so thickened up some milk with cornflour, but apart from that I followed the recipe exactly. I would definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe. I absolutely love Chicken Korma and have spent alot ordering it from different Indian restaurants. I decided to try making it myself. This is a very mild recipe- not as sweet as I have tasted before but it is quite nice- I think all the ingredients were just right and the cooking was very easy. My husband flipped over it!

This was absolutely perfect.  I had all the ingredients on hand, so I did not substitute anything.  I ate it leftover cold the next day. I will definitely make this curry dish again. I may try it with halibut next time.

I loved this recipe.  I added a whole container of yogurt and replaced the cream with lite coconut milk.  I also added some peas and more garam masala.  Other reviewers are right when they say it tastes much like regular chicken curry.  Still tasty though.

My wife loved this and I made it for a popluck with rave reviews.  We made it with chicken the first time then later with lamb finding the lamb dish much better.  Like other reviewers I pressed the garlic but for the ginger I grated it then squeezed out the juice from the grated pulp. This recipe is a keeper.

WOW, this is fantastic! We used boneless skinless thighs. We used 1 1/2 tsp additional garam masala, 2 extra cloves of garlic, and 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper. In the end I used coconut milk to thicken. Served over Jasmine rice. My husband and son just raved! Thanks!

Incredible recipe!  Definitely better if rewarmed, just as a previous reviewer mentioned.  I added about 1/4 cup raisins--if you've never tried these curry/turmeric/masala/etc. dishes with raisins, this authentic Indian twist makes the finished product have a little sweetness that truly marries with the flavor. I served it over brown rice with a pinch of salt and crushed red pepper for the spice lovers.  I will definitely be adding this to my permanent recipe collection.

This is a great recipe, but I added a half teaspoon more of both the garam masala and chili powder. I also added approximately a quarter cup of shredded coconut and 2 teaspoons of sugar to the cream/yogurt/cashew mixture.  Very good, our favorite indian dish!

My only suggestion is a little more cornstarch if you like a thicker sauce.

This was a wonderful recipe!! I just started to cook indian dishes and my husband who is indian (I'm not) said that it was "perfect." I did add more cornstarch than called for and increased the chili powder by 1/8 t.

This was a great recipe.  I've been trying out korma recipes for a while, and this is the best one.  I did add an 1/8 tsp. more chili powder and also about an 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper to make it hotter.  I also added twice as much cornstarch, like another person suggested.  I thought the ginger root was too expensive, so I didn't process the garlic and ginger, but maybe next time I will try that (I used dry ground ginger, about 1/2 tsp.).  I marinated the chicken in 1 tsp. salt, the garlic, and 1 tsp. lemon juice to make it more tender.  I also added some cashews just before serving to make it more like the restaurant we go to.  Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe is nothing special - thought I'd try it over my usual korma recipe which I'll be going back to. Nice but not amazing think I prefer kormas with coconut cream in.

This was a wonderful dish.  I do not have to tweek any of the measurements/ingredients.  This dish has lots of flavor but it is not spicy-hot when followed as-is.  My 3 yr old told me it was delicious too.

Very good! I made this because I had a bottle of Garam Masala from making Indian Butter chicken. This is somewhat similar. I prefer the butter chicken but this was tasty, as well. I served over Jasmine rice.

This recipe came out very watery. Granted, I don't have a food processor. But for me, it's probably not one that I will repeat. It tasted fine but just wasn't like the meal in the photos.

Excellent recipe here.  I added cauliflower and 1/2 cup or so of currant raisins for little splashes of sweetness and served it with Jasmine rice.

Go easy on the chili if using Indian chili powder as it is pretty hot, but I would not substitute with a Tex/Mex style chili powder.  I absolutely loved this over Jasmine rice.

This was a little boring the first night, but after a night had passed, it was amazing! It tastes a lot like a (mild) restaurant chicken korma. I used a cup of coconut milk instead of the yogurt and heavy cream. I might try it with half and half instead next time. I also added a pinch of cayenne pepper and I think I'll add a bit more next time. This recipe is a bit of a pain to make on your own, but it's worth the effort if you have the time.

I really liked this recipe and knew going into it it wasn't going to be just chicken korma. There was going to be cauliflower bits and carrots and the like. So in light of that, I upped everything - esp the spices, bec/ my pot was a lot bigger than the pot in the video. All in all, a great base recipe. Of course I bought almonds instead of cashews, and the almonds are harder, so it lacked the smoothness. Also I was reduced to using half and half; that's just what I have in the house. Thanks Trina!!

This was such a fun recipe to make.  The only change I made was adding some salt because the sauce seemed to need a little something.  I would also add some whole cashews as a garnish, because I love them.  I might also increase the amount of cashews that were ground.  Definitely let the sauce simmer as instructedso the cream and yogurt combination can blend with the spices, tomato sauce, and chicken broth.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This is a family favorite.  I scoured through the reviews and followed many of the suggestions and the recipe came out perfect.  I did not crumble the bay leaves.  I replaced the cream with coconut milk and used Indian chili powder.  I used 1/4 tsp of garlic paste and 1/8 tsp of ginger paste that I acquired from the Indian food store.  I doubled the cashews, coriander, garam masala, cumin, turmeric, coconut milk and yogurt.  I mixed 1 Tbsp cornstarch with 1 Tbsp water.

I've made this three times. The first time I subbed yogurt for the heavy cream. Fail. It was tasty but it wasn't korma.

The 2nd time, I increased all spices by 50%. I used heavy cream per the recipe this time. I added more cornstarch. Much better.

The 3rd time I increased the cashews to 1/2 cup. I also had to add over 3 tablespoons of cornstarch to get it to thicken up.

This recipe is ok, but not quite what I get at the restaurant. That being said, there are no leftovers.

Very, very good. I used a bit of brown sugar instead of corn syrup and I felt it needed salt to taste at the end. But i'm super picky when it comes to Korma. This was very good.

This is one of our staple recipes we continually make. I don't change a thing, except use whole bay leaves. Wonderful flavor! My husband likes his with more heat, so he adds hot curry powder. We serve with lentils, basmati rice, and naan bread.

This was really REALLY  good! It somehow ended up being super-spicy and not at all mild. Luckily, that's just how I like it. I probably put in a bit more garam masala and chili :)

Delish!!  Added a bit more "heat" to the dish, as well as some coconut milk to the dairy at the end.  Very lightly browned the chicken, then put sauce and chicken into crock pot.  Cooked on low for 4 hours.  Stirred in dairy, cooked for 30 more minutes.  Served to my staff for lunch with saffron rice.  It was a HUGE hit.  Will definitely make again.

This was great for my kids who can't take much spice. I  used the Instant Pot to make it go faster. Sautéed the spices (used ginger garlic paste) and onions in the IP, added the chicken and browned a little. Added broth and tomato sauce and pressure cooked on high about six minutes. Then I added cashew paste and yogurt and switched IP to slow cooker mode to simmer. My husband said it was " Indian buffet" good!

This was delicious! The alterations I made were - leaving off the cashews (had none) and replacing the heavy cream with canned coconut cream. I am always generous with my spices - but he blend of spices is scrumptious.

I made this exactly as suggested except I used chopped chicken thighs (my husband doesn't like white meat) and I didn't have masala spice so I used allspice.  I even used an electric wok.  I thought I made enough for the family for two nights but there wasn't enough left over for another dinner, even with brown rice on the side.  I will definitely make it again - but a bigger batch!

This was amazing! The right amount of spice and creaminess. It turned out nice and thick and I didn't have to add the cornstarch at the end. I also  put some cardamom and a few cloves before frying the onions. I will definitely make this again!

I have tried several other Korma recipes that failed. This one is a big hit! It is really good.  I used garlic paste and ginger paste. I  substituted coconut cream for the heavy cream. I used nearly 2 teaspoons red chili powder. It was pretty hot but perfect for my family. Will definitely make this again and again. I served homemade pakora, jasmine rice and naan bread with the Korma. Yummy!

This is really awful. It tastes like tomato soup with chicken. It tastes nothing like chicken korma. The cashews do nothing. This is not a good recipe.

Wow, so delicious!  I mixed my own Garam Masala, from this site.  Replaced yogurt w/ sour cream and chili powder w/ 1/2 tsp Cayenne (what I had on hand).  It still hand plenty of spice for me.

This was an excellent combination of flavors but i made a few changes. I added double the spices, cauliflower and peas, i added the bay leaves (whole) with the other spices but did not cook them special as described in the recipe, removed them at the end. I did not process the nuts as described either, i just sprinkled them on top and did not add cream. Garlic and ginger I threw in with the rest of the spices

This was delicious!  Only thing I changed was that I added a bit more of the seasonings, I did heaping teaspoons instead of teaspoons. I also added some fenugreek leaves as I added the tomato sauce and chicken broth. Very easy and not as time consuming as some other indian recipes.  I served with basmati rice cooked in coconut milk, a cinnamon stick, a green cardamon pod, some tumeric, and a teaspoon of ghee and also some naan bread. I will make this again for sure!

Fabulous dish and my meat-a-saurus of a husband gave it four stars!  Just a few changes; I used ground peanuts instead of cashews because it's what I had on hand, and I added more spices per other reviews and personal taste.  Another dash of spices, garam masala, etc.  Wonderful served with a dollop of greek yogurt and over rice or with a fried egg the next day!

I'd give it a four as it is a great base to start with but not perfect "right out of the box". I stuck to the recipe the first go around with the exception of adding corn starch to achieve a thick gravy, another 1/2c of yogurt and 1.5 times the spices to compensate the additional yogurt. (i just wanted more gravy). However, for the next batch i will be quadrupling the amount of cashews...there was no hint of them at all and I think the cashews are critical to a good Korma. Also needs salt to taste.

I followed the recipe as written, and it was very, very mild with little flavor.  Next time, I will probably add a little hot pepper in with the onions at the beginning and, at a minimum, double all of the spice amounts.

This is a wonderful recipe...I am still overdoing the Chilli powder as I use genuine Indian Spices so my dish was not mild but rather spicy! Love it nevertheless. Added fresh tomatoes and a few cashew nita to give the dish more texture.

Second time making this recipe . Absolutely  lovely. Substituted chicken breast for drumsticks, and left the bay leaf  whole. Added a little salt to the dish. Served with basmati rice and raita . Would do it again. Probably on of my favorite recipes.

This was so delicious. I bet it will even be better the next day. Only thing from keeping me from "loving" it is that it was not spicy at all. I added a little dash of cayenne, but that wasn't enough. Next time I will add a teaspoon to give it that Indian spice!

Everyone loved it, including 4 year old and 7 year old. Added fresh sliced peppers. Used FF half n half instead of heavy cream. Used sour cream instead of yogurt. Used ketchup instead of tomato paste. Don't crumble bay leaves. Maybe try cashew butter next time, cashews were a pain in the food processor.

The dish wasnt too complex to make and came out good. One of the users said he used coconut milk instead of cream, i think i'll try that next time. Flavor was good. Could use more ground cashew (that would also help thicken), I also added rasins and whole cashews towards the end. I added more of all the spices and added more cornstarch slurry to thicken it a little more. I also added a little curry, and toasted all of the spices before adding, that can really bring out the flavor and aroma of the spices. Will experiment a little more with this one and maybe marinate the meat in some of the spices for a night

This was the first indian food I have ever cooked. My family and I LOVED it. The only thing I changed was the cornstarch. I added a 1/4 cup of finely ground cashews as the thickener. (In reading reviews on here someone else suggested it) It really gave the dis the texture I am used to in indian food. I am making it tomorrow for my works christmas party. Thanks for the amazing recipe!!!

This was descent....I doubled all the spices and still found it pretty bland.  I thought Indian food was supposed to have tons of flavor?!?!  Following the directions would have turned out not good!  I used fresh ground garam masala that i got from a friend and left out the pistachios all together b/c my husband hates nuts.

I thought the flavors in this were OK but the sauce came out very thin.  Next time I will leave out the chicken broth and only add it at the end if I need more liquid.  I still gave it a 4, because overall I liked it and it could be that I made a mistake, since I doubled it.  I will try it again.

I've never had chicken korma, so I'm not sure what it was supposed to taste like, but I do know that this is a very good dish. Other reviewers commented that it was a little mild (and the submitter refers to it that way in her description as well) so I doubled all the spices except the turmeric. I also replaced the heavy cream with evaporated milk. I tasted it when it was done and felt it needed a little sweetness so I added a little sugar and a couple of tablespoons of sweeted coconut. Next time I will just use coconut milk in place of the cream.

I've made this recipe a couple of times and as many other reviewers said it is kind of bland when you first serve it, but the leftovers are fantastic. Obviously, the spices need to sit for awhile before the flavor really comes out. I'm going to try making it in the crock pot to let it simmer longer and see if that works. Otherwise just make it a day ahead.

There is a restaurant by my home that makes an incredibly good Chicken Korma, and I keep hoping I'll run across a recipe that repeats it; sadly, this recipe is not it. However, it was quite delicious! It was a lot of work though, and another recipe from this site tastes very similar but is much less work - it is called Curried Coconut Chicken.

Quite good, could use a little more "kick" I think.  I will probably add some more chili or something to it next time, or just use a heavier hand with all the spices.  I added the chicken after the sauce to cook it in the liquid, and it made it SUPER tender.

This was really good. I gave it 4 stars because it's not quite the perfection/same as the restaurant version. Still, it's very good and even my kids ate it. I subbed coconut milk for the heavy cream, but otherwise left it exactly the same. Oh--I didn't have cashews--that may be why it's not the same as the restaurant version.  I'll be making it again for sure.

I really enjoyed this recipe -- and so did my husband and 1 1/2 year-old son.  I followed some suggestions by previous reviewers and kept the bay leaves whole and also by putting the cashews directly in the dish.  It turned out great!  I have a lot of sauce leftover that I am going to use over rice for a quick lunch.  I felt like it could use a touch of salt so I will be adding that the next time I make this.  I served with chapati bread and basmati rice.  Great submission, Trina!

Made this exactly as shown except I added golden raisins.  Once it was "finished" it was too runny so I turned it up and reduced it.  I also had to add salt because it was a little bland before reducing.  Once actually finished, all of my kids liked it a lot.  (One even hates Indian food.) My husband and I would have liked more flavor.  I will make it again, but i may doctor it a little next time.

Last week I ate at a new Indian restaurant in Kent, Washington and had this. Liking it I wanted to make it for myself. 

I followed the recipe for the most part, but used coconut milk. If you don't like it spicy use less of the chili powder. It is spicy, but not too spicy. Ate it over Jasmine rice. It was really good.

Pretty good!  I doubled the amount of onion and also added 3 fresh cloves of garlic (diced) while the tomato sauce simmered in addition to the crushed garlic that's called for in the recipe.  I doubled the amount of veggies - I love using peas because they add such a light sweetness!

I was stationed in Germany and we would always eat at this Indian place.  My husband and I miss that place so much!  We crave it all the time! They had a dish just like this!  I think this tasted exactly like that. The only thing missing was the tea and the nann.

I thought this was pretty bland.For me Indian food is all about the explosion of flavors. I love its depth. Unfortunately, this did not have it. If I make it again I'll probably triple the spices.

This was pretty tasty, but I couldn't get over the appearance!  It looked like, well, I don't know how to put this lightly, the color of baby poop.  There, I said it.  I have had lamb korma at our local Indian resaurant and this didn't taste much like it, but like I said, it was pretty tasty.  I will probably make it again.

Made this for a group who will travel 2 hours round trip to the only Indian restaurant in our area -- I am not experienced in Indian cooking at all -- and this was WONDERFUL!! Only change I would make is to add a few more cashews to the sauce for more of the nutty flavor. Couldn't find garam masala in my small town; found recipe for mixing your with more readily available spices at another Web site. For my taste, I would have added cayenne, but my crowd found some other dishes I made too spicy, so this was just right for them. I will make this again and again!

Very mild, very aromatic dish.  It tasted really good, but I think it could have been a tad sweeter.  Overall, though, the spices were just right and we enjoyed it very much.

I made it EXACTLY according to the instructions.  I would add 2 tsp. of salt at the end.  I would also consider adding 1 cup of petite green peas at the end.  The next time I make it I will try to omit the chicken so i can freeze a bunch of it and reheat it later whereupon I will add chicken or shrimp.

This was just a marvelous dish!  I can't wait to make it again.  I didn't make any changes except I used low fat yogurt instead of full fat and added an extra tsp of garam masala.  It is a bit labor intensive but it is really worth it in the end.

This was just perfect. The only change I made was to add some whole cashews at the end, just for another texture element. It was absolutely delicious and easy, and I didn't have to get all dressed up to have authentic Indian food. Can't beat that! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great starting point for a great taste of a local India food place.

Hubby and I loved this dish.  A warm, spicy, tasty meal on an unusually cold spring day.  And the aroma while cooking was fabulous!

I found this recipe to be very good. I personally added butter and it made a little difference in taste to me.

Not what I was expecting, and I really didn't feel that it compared at all to restaurant quality.  Kind of bland, and I followed the recipe perfectly.  Probably won't make again.
