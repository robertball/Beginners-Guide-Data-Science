The fruit mixture is to be added right before you add the rum. Oops!

Great way to use up ripe apricots! I didn’t have chicken breasts so I used thighs.  The cooking time was significantly increased.  If you are going to use thighs or legs I would recommend grilling the chicken first. Also I didn’t use rum but the sauce tasted great!

We thought this was phenominal! We used Captain Morgan Spiced Rum along with canned apricots because we could not find fresh ones locally this time of year.  We served the dish over Jasmine Rice and the results were really delicious.  I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks so much for making this unique and very enjoyable recipe available!

I loved this recipe- I used mango instead of apricot and used 1 jalapeno for a little hot- and what a great mix with the sweet----------yummie and thanks. Oh and I also used orange marmalade cuz I didn't have fresh orange for zest--------

This recipe was pretty good. Light and refreshing. But it was pretty bland. Needs some more spices.

I thought this recipe was excellent. My husband and I was a little nervous when we started and lit the rum but it was exciting and the chicken was great. I will make this again.

I really enjoyed this- I used chicken tenders because they were on sale, and I think it helped with cooking time anyway. Also, my grocery store did not have any fresh apricots, so I took some dried and plumped them up in about 1/2 c of chicken broth and used that in the recipe. It was great over rice- my husband was skeptical of the consistency but he gobbled it up. Thanks for sharing!

After we carefully lit the match and let the mixture burn as stated in the recipe, we couldn't figure out what to do with the pineapple and apricot mixture.  The recipe never says what to do with that mixture.

This just didn't have the right consistancy for me, even thought the fire was cool, I took 2 bites and didn't eat the rest. It needs to be sweeter next time...

We thought this was good, but it could use a little something else. It could use something crunchy to add a little texture. It was good enough to inspire us to try it again, with a few changes. It reminded us of the food we had in Costa Rica!

Overall, I didn't like this recipe. I thought the sauce was the consistency of baby food which turned me off from the beginning. Texture aside, the flavor was OK, maybe a little too sweet for dinner. I'd leave out the sugar; there's plenty of sweetness in the fruit. I also added some garlic powder. I did cut up the chicken first, then removed it from the pan while I added everything else and brought it up to a simmer, then added it back.

No changes, except that I used chicken thighs, not breasts. Delicious. My wife says "you can keep this one..." :)

Phenomenal. I used canned apricots with the syrup and fresh pineapple. I also browned the chicken in Caribbean jerk seasoning. At the end I added green onions and cilantro when o added the peppers!! Phenomenal meal! Great paired with fried plantains & grilled pineapple!!

I rated this 3 stars, though my spouse said 4.  I used Captain Morgan spiced rum though could not taste any of the rum flavor in the dish.  I wouldn't use the word "bland", but agree that the dish needs a little something else.  I think my orange zest came through more bitter than typical, which may be why I didn't like it as much.  If we make this again, I will certainly use a very fresh orange (or orange juice?) and check these reviews again to see how others have altered the recipe. Oh, and the bell pepper I had was on the larger side, so I felt that one was plenty.
