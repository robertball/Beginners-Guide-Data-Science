A bit mild. I think it needs just a little more spice.

An excellent recipe. I doubled, and ignored the listed spices to add my own. Ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves... just throw a bunch in, you're not going to hurt it.

These were absolutely wonderful!  My 3 kids had a wonderful time decorating them.  They are soft and delicious right out of the oven.  Not too spicy not too sweet!

These were not very good. Needed more flavor. They were pretty dry.
