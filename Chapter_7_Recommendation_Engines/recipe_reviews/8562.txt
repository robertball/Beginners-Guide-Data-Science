THE VERY BEST!!!!  I've made this several times and it is always delicious.  I made it last night for my parents and they couldn't stop raving.  My mom is an awesome cook -- most everything is made from scratch -- and both my mom and dad said this was the BEST SOUP they've EVER had (they are in the 60s-70s).  I think my dad ate four huge bowls and he asked for some to take home!!!!  That is the highest compliment!!  I make a few minor revisions -- I double the onion, butter, carrots, black pepper and bay leaf and add minced garlic.  I also make the Boiled Chicken recipe from this site (using 4 lb. raw chicken) and use all of that chicken PLUS part of that broth instead of all water (probably 2-3 cups of the broth and 9-10 cups water).  I also cook it alot longer -- a couple of hours -- before adding the noodles.  I also use frozen noodles (Reames brand).  These noodles are thick and hearty and really make for a delicious, homemade taste and presentation. Thanks Sherry for an awesome recipe!!!  Now, I'm off to have a bowl for lunch.  I'm glad I didn't give all of the leftovers to my dad to take home!!! ha  ha

Don't need cooked chicken the chicken can and should be cooked with the soup.  Can swap chick broth for cubes and water. I added 4 times the carrots. Excellent and easy!

Not good, but can be easily improved. Saute veggies,or micro or use frozen peas, carrots, etc. Second, don't use bouillon cubes. They're terrible tasting, not healthy (way too much salt, no nutritional value) & make awful broth.  Instead use Swanson's chix broth instead, this is the closest to homemade & it's true. It's worth the extra cost to use "Swanson's", as their broth is nutritional, plus non fat. Per other reviewer, OK to cook the chix w/the broth.  Can substitute noodles w/pastina, alphabet pasta, orzo pasta.

fantastic soup!I used 2 boxes of Swansons Organic Chicken Broth along with 4 cups of chicken stock instead of the chicken boulillon and water. Added a small bag of frozen white corn. also, i used a whole store bought rotisserie chicken instead of just chopping up cooked chicken meat. I placed the whole chicken in to the pot when adding the veggies, spices,and broth and simmered it all for 30 minutes like the recipe says to do. Then removed the whole chicken from the pot and removed the meat from the bird then placed the meat back in to the pot of soup. I've had so many complements on this recipe it is unbelievable. Everyone says it's the BEST chicken soup they have ever had. Thanks so much for this wonderful easy recipe!

This was so good...I sauteed the celery and onions as directed and then threw everything into the crockpot and cooked it on low for about 7 hours.. I didnt have any egg noodles so the last 20 minutes of cooking I broke up pieces of lasagna noodles and threw them in..It was great!!.. I served it with grilled cheese sandwhiches and it took me back to when I was a kid and my grandmother made the same meal for me...

Very tasty!  On my second time around I added twice as many carrots and half the butter so it wasn't as greasy.  I also used boneless chicken thighs.  Excellent!

So easy to make!  My mom has always made homemade chicken noodle soup, but doesn't go by a recipe.  I've been wanting to make it for my fiance and this is pretty close.  My fiance loved it!  He said it was just as good, if not better.

I also made some modifications.  The main one being that I used my crock pot instead. It cooked for about 4 1/2 hours, but could go all day, I'm sure.  I cut the recipe to serve 7 because I only have a small crock pot, and it fit perfectly!

I also boiled 3 boneless/skinless chicken breasts and shredded it with a fork instead of chopping.  And I didn't use the bay leaf or parsley because I didn't have any on hand. :)

Note that the broth may look a little watery--my fiance and I both thought so--but he tried it and it tasted awesome.  (I'm a vegetarian, so I can't taste test :)  But of course, it all depends on your personal taste.

This recipe is delicious and very easy to make. You can substitute left over turkey in place of the chicken for something different. This is a keeper and will be part of my recipe file for a long time. Thank you Sherry!

This soup was SO delicious! It's worth the time to used the boiled chicken recipe on this site. I took the advice of others and cooked the soup for a little longer as well and used almost all chicken broth instead of water, this gives it such a hearty flavor. I also doubled the carrots and celery and I used linguine noodles because that's all I had on hand. I'm sure any noodles would work. Thank you for a delicious chicken noodle soup recipe that I will keep forever!

Great soup!  Added 4x the carrots (1cup) and 2x the onion (1/2cup) and used 1/2 tsp parsley and 1/2 tsp oregano.  Family loved it.

Very wonderfull! I did make some changes such as using chicken broth instead of cubes. I also used 2 cups of celery, 1 1/2 cups of carrots and added 1/2tsp of oregeno and 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning, 1 full medium onion, also used rotisserie chicken and I think it makes a huge contribution to the soup. My brothers son absolutely loved it. He ate 3 bowls of it and he never eats that much of any food that we have ever seen.  I will be making this often! Oh, I did increase the cooking time to roughly 2-2 1/2 hours.

I have made this a number of times and it is great,last night it was for my sick husband. I used 8 cups of swanson reduced sodium chicken broth with 4 cups of water. I also added a can of cream of chicken along with some minced garlic and a little oregano. At the end I used fresh chopped parsley and some sliced green onion. Served along with some bisquick biscuits and he was a happy camper!

If you are looking for a quick and easy but still homemade soup this is it. I have made this soup so many times for family and friends when they are sick that people are actually requesting it! I like to bake the chicken with some Natures Seasoning and also substitute four cups of water w/ two cans of Chicken Broth, then I add some boullion cubes w/ the rest of the water. I give this recipe 5 stars because I have found no one who doesn't enjoy it.

perfect for my Slow-Cooker. here's what I adjusted: I used 6 cups of water instead of 12, and used 6 tsp of Better than Boullion (chicken flavor). I used only half the dried herb and spices (I used the smallest bay leaf I had). I used unsalted butter, and did not have to add any additional salt. I add all of those ingredients to the slow cooker at the beginning, and cooked on low heat for 8 hours. I used Whole Wheat Egg Noodles, which I added at the last 40 minutes of cooking. SOOOO YUMMY! And so simple. I will definitely make this again!!

Delicious!  My intention was to make this for my daughter during a stomach bug.  I used 7 boullion cubes and followed everything else pretty much exactly.  It's not bland but the flavor is delicate and was perfect for a get-well-soon meal!

This soup was amazing.  I made several adjustments after reading a handful of other chicken soup recipes.  I substitued chicken broth for the water and the bouillon cubes.  I doubled the vegetables and noodles which were whole wheat.  I put in some green onions, fresh parsley, whole garlic cloves, and poultry seasoning.  It had great flavor and wonderful consistency.

Um.  Don't know where to begin.  This soup wasn't good.  It tasted like canned chicken noodle soup, and that's not a compliment.  I prefer stock or broth, and even canned/boxed is better than boullion cubes!!  I also cannot believe the butter (why on earth butter I don't know).  Anyway, I was looking for a quick recipe for hubby to make and this was NOT it.  not good!!

This is a great soup. I get everything but the noodles prepared and in my slow cooker before heading to work; then when I get home, I put the egg noodles in for about 10 minutes and we are ready to sit down and enjoy this delicious recipe. It's a keeper that's frequently made for my family.

Very very good.  It was my first time making chicken noodle soup from scratch, and I followed a lot of "StacyB1967"s suggestions, since she raved so much.  I boiled a whole chicken using this website's "Boiled Chicken" recipe by George.  Then I used 3 cups of stock from that boiled chicken, and 9 cups regular water for the soup, as Stacy suggested.  (Next time I'll do about half stock, half water - that stock was good.)  I doubled everything she suggested we double in the recipe, except for the butter.  The amount of butter originally suggested is plenty to saute the celery and onions.  The only thing it needs is a little salt.  I added one teaspoon of salt at the end, and that did the trick.  And then just dash on a bit more everytime you pour yourself a bowl (who doesn't do that?), and it's perfect.  It tastes even better the second and third days!  I think it really helped to nip my cold in the bud, too.  Thank you for the great recipe... and to "StacyB1967" for sharing her suggestions.

I love this soup. I can't help but feel a little annoyed that the most highly rated review starts with "not good". Obviously the use of chicken bouillon is a matter of personal taste. A lot of people don't like it- they think it's too salty too artificial tasting ect.... I'll admit, I felt a bit uneasy about using it.  And I was pleasantly suprised with the result. The butter,veggies,seasonings,chicken and bouillon cubes all meld into a mild and wonderful broth. I've made this several times and the only issue I have when making this is the amount of noodles. I use homemade egg noodles and they tend to absorb a lot of broth. One time I added 12 oz. of noodles. Big mistake. I had chicken and noodles not soup. The called for 8 oz. is plenty and depending on the type of noodles used maybe even too much. Overall this soup is excellent and so quick and easy. Five stars!

I love this soup and so does my family.  Here is what I did a bit differently:  instead of the bouillon and water, I used 2 48 ounce containers of chicken broth (with extra for thinning the soup later), I added one cup of carrots and one cup of chopped onion.  I substituted the egg noodles for one 12 ounce package of Reames frozen Homestyle noodles.  I kept the spices the same except added two bay leaves.  I also added extra pepper.  My college age son is clamoring for me to give him this recipe to take back to college with him....a real sign of approval in my book!

Marjoram!!! I'm giving this 5 stars because it introduced me to marjoram. It is the flavor I've been searching for. I didn't follow this recipe exactly, I added garlic and sauteed it with the onion and left out the bay leaf and used real chicken broth, but the marjoram is the key, and now I add it to many soups... anything with veggies (it's wonderful in split pea, too!). I'm so happy to have finally used this spice!!

I doubled the carrot and onion, added potatoes (why not), and used fresh ground peppercorns instead of ground black pepper. Much better flavor! Since I didn't have marjoram or parsley on hand, I used basil and oregano instead. Also replaced the egg noodles with some mixed wild rice. I ended up with a lovely chicken rice soup! Mmmm.

Wow! I made this two days after Thanksgiving with the leftovers and it was amazing!  I didn't have any butter left, so I used oil and I also didn't have any bay leaf, so I left it out.  I thought there was a little too much chicken, so I doubled the veggies and it was good.  Will make again!

Good soup. I used 1/4 celery salt instead of celery (didn't have any). I also used 1/2 T onion powder instead of an onion. Added 3 C carrots, 3 potatoes, & 3 C turkey (instead of chicken). Added 1 extra chicken bullion cube & 1 extra C water.

This would have been so awesome had it not been so salty! I used 6 bouillon cubes, rather than 9 and it was still toooo salty! Other than that, it was easy. I might make again using less cubes.

So easy and so good! I added 4 cups of chicken stock on top of the 12 cups of water since I doubled the noodles. I also used a cup of carrots instead of 1/4 cup and a little garlic powder. Thanks to the gentleman who suggested the can of cream of chicken soup. It was the perfect addition. Husband and kids loved it! Bravo on this recipe!!!

I was too sick to go to the store so I figured I would try to make my own chicken noodle soup.  I didn't have a clue how but found this recipe.  

Thank you!!!  It was SUPER easy and DELICIOUS!!!  It cured my cold and pleased my friends and family, too.  I will make it again and I have passed the recipe on to many others.  

The only negative I encountered was the lack of spices.  However, I prefer my cooking recipes to be that way.  I feel taste is unique to every individual and therefore, everyone can add their own spices to suit their tastes.

Also, instead of cutting individual vegetables, I used frozen soup-ready vegetables (2 small bags).  It made for an even easier recipe!

This is my FAVORITE chicken noodle soup recipe! I make this every single time one of us gets sick- cold, flu- whatever- and everytime it seems to get us feeling better fast. The only thing I do differently is I cook the chicken in the oven before I throw it in the pot. Don't ask why, I just always have.

I have made this recipe MANY times. It's GREAT when you're feeling under the weather. Only problem is that when YOU'RE sick you only want your own chicken noodle soup and you're too sick to make it! Just some notes: Instead of egg noodles I use stir-fry rice noodles.   I've made it both ways and the family likes the rice noodles MUCH better. For the chicken, the night before I throw boneless chix breast in a crock pot and also a few bone in drums& thighs with chicken broth overnight on low. Next day the meat just falls off the bone. I like the extra flavor of bone-on chicken. You can also make extra batches of this and freeze.  Just be sure to freeze the portions without the noodles in. ENJOY!

Very simple and very delicious. I subbed Swanson chicken broth for all the bouillon cubes and water, it was just easier that way. It still was excellent.

This is a great homemade soup.  I doubled the carrots and celery and also added poultry seasoning which gave it much more flavor!  It hardly compares with canned soup.

This is just the way my mother taught me and I've been making this soup for over 55 years, my only difference is to boil my noodles separately till done then add them to the soup (in the bowl) , it prevents the soup from being cloudy.  If I have left over soup for the next night I again boil the noodles I need, this keeps the left-over soup from becoming overly thick and unappetizing looking.  Remember this is chicken soup not cream of chicken.

Look no further!  This is THE Chicken Noodle Soup Recipe!  Really enjoyed this.  I did however make the mistake of adding too many noodles and they sucked up a lot of the broth, it was still great!!!  Great flavor!  This made a lot.  Next time (unless its for a party) I will try freezing half before adding the noodles, as another reviewer suggested.   I made the recipe as is except for using Swanson's chicken broth instead of the water and bullion cubes.  I think the veggies need doubled also, just my preference.    Great winter recipe!!!!

Oh, this is so good. I used 4 boneless uncooked chicken breasts. I just cubed them and put them in the broth. Omitted the carrots, as I did'nt have any. Also didn't have any marjoram. I think it was great, and will be making it again

The best chicken noodle soup I have ever had! It was extremely easy to make, and I have never made a soup before. My wife and I love to have this Sunday afternoons now that its cold out. I save the rest for my lunch at work, it reheats extremely well! We think it goes great paired with a french baguette.

I have always made my chicken noodle soup from scratch but didn't really have a recipe so it always came out different. I followed this recipe to a "T" except I boiled chicken thighs with the boullion and deboned and chopped it and used the stock as my base. I also added a cut up zuchinni and summer squash. The seasonings were right on the mark. My family REALLY loved it (including my mother-in-law:) This one is a definte keeper!

It was all right.  I made some changes and maybe that's why I thought it wasn't a 5-star recipe.  Or maybe chicken soup is too bland for my palate.

Wonderful recipe.  Next time I will increase the amount of carrots and celery though and maybe add poultry seasons for a bit spicier taste.  But this recipe is definitely a keeper.

I agree that this is a very good soup for beginners:) We eat a TON of homemade soups so this was a little bland for me. Not enough flavoring. Reminded me of a canned chicken and noodle soup.

Great yet simple recipe. I could never get soups right. But this was a great foundation. I made a smaller batch so I only used 2 1/2 Knorr chicken boullon cubes and added cabbage and Goya noodles. Absolutely tasty. Will definitely do again.

Very simple.  Very delicious!  Great for a chilly night such as tonight.  No major varying from the original recipe.  Used a leftover homemade roasted chicken from the night before.  I did double the veggies listed 'cuz we like good 'n' chunky soup, and I also used homemade chicken bone broth instead of water and bouillon cubes.  Bone broth adds loads more nutrients to the mix and far less sodium than bouillon or store bought broths.  I just had to add some garlic tho' 'cuz we're garlic lovers and can't get enough of it.

Made this exactly as printed. Very tasty! Next time I will add the dried parsley closer to the end of cooking time so it stays bright green. Will make again and again.

My daughter loved this soup!  A keeper.  The only thing I changed was I did not have egg noodles in the house so I added cooked pasta.  My daughter does not want me to buy canned chicken soup ever again.

too salty, but if you cut the number of bouillon cubes in half it would be much better... also, next time i will use pulled chicken instead, i'm not a fan of cubed chicken in my soup.

Doubled the recipe. Used rotisserie chicken, dropping the whole chicken into the soup for about 45 minutes before shredding it.  Used 2 boxes of chicken broth and 4 cups of water instead of the bullion. Added 1tsp white pepper, 1/2 tsp chipotle chili pepper, chopped garlic and a bag of frozen peas. Added 16 oz of egg noodles, could have only added half that amount. Very tasty!!

I didn't have any broth in the cupboard and was happy to find this recipe.   A word of warning - the bullion cubes I used had MSG, which ended up giving my partner a headache. I don't mind a bit of MSG in a dish, but this soup ended up having too much.

This is a good base recipe but, like others, I added a few things.  First, I boiled a whole chicken in water and added 2 cans of Swanson's chicken broth (also a little bouillon granules to taste).  I sauted the vegetables with 1-2 cloves of garlic and then added everything to a crock-pot (minus the egg noodles).  About 40 minutes prior to serving, I added Reames Noodles to the crockpot and served with warm multi-grain french bread!!!  Delicious

This is a great recipe.  I increased the amount of vegetables and used low-sodium chicken broth instead of chicken boullions.  Lastly, I used the chicken from a deli rotissere chicken and I feel it really helped give a homemade broth taste.

I thought this was a good recipe.  Nothing particularly special, but still good.  My daughter (4) loved it and asks for it often--she likes to dip bread in the juice while she eats it.  I like to use a couple of rotisserie chickens from Walmart for my chicken.  I just peel the breast meat off and cut it up.

OMG this is soooo good! I switched things up a little though. I took 15 cups of water, added 6 buillon cubes, half an onion, and pepper. Brought that to a boil, and once the chicken was done I removed it and let it cool. Then I skimmed all the "foam" off the top of the pots, added the celery, carrots, onion, and the spices. I did add 3 cloves of garlic though. It came out soo good!!! I had a cold when I made it, and it hit the spot! Thank you for sharing!!

I did not like this at all. I found it way too salty. Maybe if I had used chicken broth instead of the bouillon cubes it would have been better.

OMG!!!!  We love this recipe - I added more noodles than what was asked for, but we're noodle crazy at my home.  Even my husband likes it and that's saying a lot.  I love winter!!  When else can you make something this wonderful.

It was delicious!! I'm not much of a soup eater, but I had two bowls of this and my husband had three! It was a nice treat on a very cold day. I'm giving it four stars b/c it needed a little doctoring up. I will say that for 12 cups of water we used the water we boiled the chicken in . (minus the yucky stuff-we skimmed it out!) We also used 12 oz of noodles, b/c we just felt like 8 wasn't enough. After tasting it we added extra bouillon. Next time we plan to double the carrots. Although we made all these changes it was still a delicious soup to start with!

I have been searching for the perfect chicken noodle soup recipe for years, and with some modifications to this recipe I found it! I doubled the amount of herbs the recipe called for, tripled the amount of veggies, added grilled diced red peppers, used chicken broth instead of bouillon, and added 1.5 teaspoons of ginger.  WONDERFUL!  My husband ranted and raved!  My two toddlers gobbled it up without even noticing the veggies.  A great base recipe - THANK YOU!

Loved it- a truly warm and filling soup when you don't feel well and need a little tlc! I have made this countless times now and have never had a bad batch. I season the chicken very lightly with seasoning salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and Adobo seasoning before frying a pan with 1 TBS of Olive oil until no longer pink. I don't think I have ever actually measured the veggies, I just add them until I think it will be enough! *I use the garlic and herb Chicken broth and you just cannot go wrong!! I have also used the veggie chicken broth and it came out great as well. However if you use these, DO NOT add salt! Definitely a recipe I will contine to use forever!

Very, very good.  I also used the boiled chicken recipe on this site to prepare the chicken before hand and added a few cups of broth from that instead of all water.  I think it added a lot of flavor to the soup.

Super easy.  I served this at an informal lunch and it was so good that I served it for dinner that night!  I gave it 4 stars because I used chicken broth instead of bouillon like others suggested and added garlic.  I also used a rotisserie chicken.  I think it was the marjoram that made the difference though.  It does make a lot!!

This soup came together in a snap.  I used a whole rotisserie chicken from the deli, omitted the marjoram, added a bit of poultry seasoning, and used 1 box of chicken stock and 2 of broth and it was excellent with no-yolk noodles.  It makes a ton of soup, so if you're making it for just a couple people, either scale it down or be prepared to freeze some!

Very simple and delicious! the only thing I changed was boiled a whole chicken cut in pieces in 12c of water after chicken was done I deboned the chicken and continued with the rest of the ingredients without the chicken bouillon or butter, I just put the onion, carrots,& celery in the boiling water.

A very easy and tasty basic meal.  SOUPER on cold wet fall days!  3/4 cup of barley in place of the noodles gives it a heartier substance.  I added some leftover corn to this recipe.  It would easily take many other veggies as well.

This soup came out so good.  I made a few modifications, but nothing major.  I used chicken broth instead of the water/boullion combination.  I also added some spinach to the soup.  It was delicious and I will definitely keep this recipe.

This recipe is excellent!! I made it for our family and a neighbor who was sick and everyone loved it. I increased the carrots to 1/2 cup, but the next time I will add even more.

Excellent all around recipe. The only thing I did different was using canned chicken broth instead of the boullion cubes. I also omitted the celery, mine, having been in the fridge awhile, looked too anemic to use! Thanks.

Great soup!  I used alphabet pasta because my kids were asking for alphabet soup.  I also had some very inexpensive chicken legs so I boiled them and then removed the skin and pulled the meat from the bones and used that.  Very tasty!

I cut some time by just using a pre-roasted chicken from the store(Approx 2.5lbs). Used the whole thing(-bones). Worked great!!

Yummy soup, I make all the time with minor changes-no marjoram, add poultry seasoning instead.  I also add a handfull of frozen peas, and a handfull of frozen corn when adding the noodles.  I also triple the carrots, and use low salt Swanson's broth in the box. Make it whenever someone has a cold......it works!

This was the first time I ventured into making soup myself.  As a 26yr old 
bachelor, I was amazed that I could make it happen.  This recipe made it easy.
And tasty.

This is a simple and good recipe. I don't use as many bouillon cubes as the recipe calls for but it turns out fine anyway. Of course we all add or subtract according to our tastes. For me it's more chicken (I use only breast meat) and no celery. (Can't stand celery unless it's filled with peanut butter!). I also cut the chicken breast into large chunk and cook it in the soup. Think it adds a bit more flavor. Made this tonight and took some over to a 95 year old Swiss neighbor. She hardly eats enough to keep her alive. Tonight she asked me if I had some extra she could have. I gladly ran home and got more for her. She ate two and a half bowls in one sitting! Thanks for this one!

Doubled up the veggie and chicken quantities, used thyme and oregano rather than marjoram and used better than bullion for the stock.


Amazing.
Simply amazing.

The best chicken noodle soup I've ever made.

Very good.. made a few changes like the others. I boiled a whole chicken, let it sit in the fridge overnight. Then took the fat off the top and boiled it again. Then I de-boned the chicken and shredded it and put it aside. Added 2 boxes of organic chicken broth, added poultry seasoning, and the other seasonings mentioned in the recipe and also added a couple of bay leaves. Added carrots, corn, celery, onion and boiled again. Then added the shredded chicken back in and in the last 20 minutes, added the egg noodles. I did not add any butter. My family and picky kids loved it!  Thanks!

Couldn't believe how good this turned out!  It was so simple!  I used leftover rotisserie chicken and followed the recommendation to use 2 boxes of organic chicken broth and 4 cups boxed chicken stock in place of water and bouillon (I ended up adding an additional can of chicken broth to allow for enough liquid to cook the noodles).  I also added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables when I added the noodles.  It was delicious!

Quick and easy with great flavor! I usually make changes to most of the recipes but this one required no changes. I have also added fresh mushrooms when the mood strikes. Simply slice and add them as you saute the celery and onion.

The butter really adds body and flavor to this wonderful soup.  I added a teaspoon of garlic to the butter and onion and doubled the amount of onion.  My husband never cared for my homemade chicken soup before, but he LOVED this!

Awesome soup! Very filling and is like medicine when you're feeling sick. I substituted the bouillon cubes and water for two boxes of Swanson's chicken broth and omitted the bay leaf. The marjoram gave it a lot of flavor. I reduced the amount of celery to 1/2 cup and increased the carrots to 1/2 cup. I put it all in a crock pot and simmered for about four hours. I would recommend sauteing the celery, carrots, and onions first and then adding to the crock pot if cooking this way. Wonderful, home-style recipe!

I was surprised at how good this was for being so simple.  I simmered 2 large thigh/leg pieces in 12 cups of water for about 45 mins then let it cool.  Then I skimmed the excess fat off the surface and removed the meat to a platter.  Then I pulled all the meat off and discarded the skin & bones.  I then proceeded with the recipe as written, using the reserved broth/water instead of plain water.  I will definately make this again.  It was a long process but definately worth the effort!  Using dark meat makes a much more flavorful soup than breast meat and it's less expensive.

This is a great recipe for folks (like me) who are making homemade chicken noodle soup for the first time.  I changed the recipe quite a bit and will continue to tweak this recipe until perfected for my little family.  Thank you for posting this.

A keeper! I used diced 1 lb celery, 1 onion and sauteed in 4 garlic cloves and 1/4 cup butter. I then added 1 lb of chopped carrots, 3 lbs trimmed and cubed chicken breast, 8 cups water, 2 cups chicken broth, 1 pack of bullion cubes, 2 tbs pepper, 2 tbs parsley, 2 bay leaves, and let simmer on the stove top of 3 hours. I used egg noodles and store them separate from the soup. FABULOUS!!

4 cups chopped, cooked chicken meat
2 cups chopped celery
1 cup chopped carrots
1 cup chopped onion
1/2 cup butter
8 ounces egg noodles

I thought this was pretty darned good. As others have suggested, I made it in a crock pot—just dumped everything except the noodles in and left it on high for four hours. I then shredded the chicken and added the noodles to cook. 

A few notes:

1. I started with 10 cups of water rather than 12, and I'm glad I did. You can always add more!

2. I thought this recipe needed a lot more salt, so make sure you test the result before serving.

3. Next time I make this, I'll buy chicken thighs rather than the breasts I used this time. The soup was good, but I thought the broth would taste better with a little more fat, and the breast meat seemed a little dry.

It was great. I, like others, altered slightly. My kids and I love noodles, so we did 16 oz noodles, extra carrots, more pepper, and did a 4 cup water, 5 boullion, 4 cups swanson chicken broth mix. Very yummy!

Oh my. This is the greatest chicken noodle soup I've ever had! For everyone who believes the recipe is too bland, believe me it works out. Instead of any regular old chicken I just so happened to have frozen rotisserie chicken from Costco. So I defrosted and shredded the whole chicken. I also use the stock. While the soup was simmering I added the chicken bones, to help shred off any chicken that was still on the bones and to get extra flavor. I didn't h e any marjoram on hand so I used poultry seasoning thyme garlic powder and fennel seed with fresh black pepper (fennel really adds a kick). Great thing is salt doesn't have to be added the boullion does the trick. 

However, I used 14 cups of water instead of 12, seeing that the pasta just sucked up all my water. Other than that this is an amazig recipe that is definitely a keeper! I served with fresh pugiliese bread from Costco's ovens. 

And don't be fooled by the picture, the "liquid" is packed with flavor and the butter doesn't grease your pallets

I followed the recipe to a T and found the soup to be really bland and lacking depth. It tasted just like a higher quality canned soup. I will not be making this again.

Huge success; easy and versatile. We parboiled the chicken and then used the stock from the parboiling in place of the water. This eliminated the need for the chicken bullion. As others have suggested, the amount of water you use would depend on how thick you like your soup. We added to the stock mentioned above until we had 10 cups liquid. This seemed like a happy medium once we added the noodles. But we did add a little salt (but not nearly as much as would have been in the bullion). We used shell noodles instead of the traditional flat noodles. Took to a pot luck at church & it was totally gone in no time.

I was impressed that this soup was so yummy AND so simple! I think sautéing the veggies in butter added great flavor. I would recommend cooking the noodles separately then adding them close to the time you serve the soup. The first time I made this, I added them to the pot as the recipe called for, but we didn't get to eat the soup until hours later, and the noodles turned to mush. Very delicious recipe!! New cold weather staple in our house! :)

This is the best chicken noodle soup. I made it in my slow cooker. I think sautéing the veggies and using bay leaves is the key. I used chicken broth because I don't use bouillon. I also added potatoes per DH's request. I served with Alabama fire crackers, absolutely wonderful!! If your trying to decide which chicken noodle soup recipe to use.....make this one!!!!

Sooooo good!  Used the Boiled Chicken recipe by George on this site to make the chicken.  I used a 4 lb. whole chicken.  After the meat was done, I removed the meat from the bones and returned the bones to the pot and simmered 1 hour more to make the most wonderful broth.  I used this broth in place of the water in this recipe, adding any additional Swanson's broth as needed to meet the amount required.  I will never use water and bouillon again!  (Also, as others suggested, I used 1 bag of Reames' frozen noodles.) I will definitely be making this again - it's a keeper!

I'm not sure why I thought soup this good would be so hard to make. For some bizarre reason, I added way too much salt, but the flavor on this soup was incredible once my tongue stopped burning. I will definitely make this again and take it easy on the salt. There's really no need for it at all when everything is so fresh and delicious!

This is like the soup my grandma used to make!  I used a whole chicken, which was easy to remove from the pan when it was done cooking.  I do not suggest using canned chicken broth in this recipe because the chicken really makes its own natural homemade broth after cooking in the soup.  I used more marjoram and thyme and followed the suggestions of others to use minced garlic, a little cumin, and increase the carrots to 2 c.  Frozen peas were a nice addition.  Next time when I have a bit more time I'd like to use the "Basic Pasta" recipe by Pat to make homemade noodles - that was a great suggestion by another reviewer!  Thanks for this recipe, and thanks to others for the great reviews/ suggestions.

It was a good chicken noodle soup as is but is a little bland. I ended up adding a little bit of poultry seasoning and that was just the right touch. Don't forget to take out the bay leaf when the soup is done!

I made it chunkier than the recipe called for, which is to say, more vegetables, noodles and chicken. I will probably go one bouillon cube stronger next time, but the rest of the spice was wonderful, and now I have marjoram...for whatever else marjoram is for... :)

This is a really good recipe for basic chicken soup.  I had to omit the celery(didn't have any, so doubled up on the onions)and the marjoram(none to be found, used basil and garlic) and used pasta shells that I had on hand. Everybody ate it, husband was impressed with the "homemade-ness".  I'll definitely try it again when I have the proper ingredients on hand.  Maybe try it when the leftover turkey comes around. Thanks for the easy dinner solution!

I Love this soup! My whole family loves this soup, and  my Mom swears that when she is sick she wants me to bring over a huge pot of it. She swears it is medicinal! Only thing I changed was I omitted the bay leaf but that is just for my taste. I serve it with homemade bread. It is my 12 year olds favorite dish!

Wonderful starter recipe and definitely a great idea.  Like many other reviewers, I boiled my chicken and used the stock from that in addition to some boxed broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes.  This was very flavorful and the soup kept very nicely.  I would personally prefer at least double the amount of carrots and a bit more celery, so I'll be sure to make those changes for the next time.

I made this recipe as written and it was quite bland for our taste so I 'equaled’ the bouillon vs. water using 12 teaspoons of ‘Better Than Bouillon’ paste bouillon which is the best bouillon flavoring I have found.  I also added a couple teaspoons of minced garlic and let it simmer another 30 minutes.  Still needed something so added a teaspoon of Cavender’s Greek Seasoning and with these additions it better suit our taste buds.

My family is a big "soup group" but didn't really enjoy this recipe. They said there wasn't enough flavor to this... and didn't want me to save the leftovers. Normally there AREN'T any leftovers. Might try it with a bunch of doctoring next time...

Great soup. I think the poultry seasoning really makes it. I added chopped zucchini and fresh parsley when i added the noodles.

This is FABULOUS!  I like to boil my boned chicken and use the left over water toward the 12 cups required in the recipe.  I usually don't saute the onion and the celery just add it in with the rest of ingredients to the water and omitted the butter.  My daughter loves this chicken noodle soup and asks for it every winter or when she is sick.

Wonderful flavor! I boiled the chicken and used that as a broth base mixed with boxed chicken broth and 2 tsp chicken bouillon granules. I'm not sure how it would have been if I had just used the fake stuff, but I bet it would not be as tasty. I also added a little lemongrass for added complexity. It was the best chicken noodle soup I have made yet!

I thought this was great.  I did add more carrots and a little more onion and used Penzey's chicken base instead of the bouillon.  Super recipe!

I've made this many times since finding this recipe. I've adjusted it a bit to suit my families preferences. My adjustments #1) *1 1/2* cups of carrots...  #2) *1/2* teaspoon salt...  #3) *1* teaspoon minced garlic... #4) I've tried this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts but it's much more flavorful with meat from a whole chicken.

This soup is delicious! I've made it 3 times, and everyone will eat it willingly. The bouillon cube tastes fine to us, even though I've been worried about it being too salty. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 (even though I'd like to give it a 4 1\2)because there is a lot of broth, and it isn't very thick. To fix this problem, I've added potatoe flakes and leftover gravy. You can also use turkey, I did that after Thansgiving. Thank you for this quick and easy recipe!

What a great chicken noodle soup!  I made this yesterday for my sick husband and 2 toddlers.  They all loved it!  I used the Boiled Chicken recipe from this site for the chicken and then used the stock for my broth.  I added 2 minced garlic cloves when I sauteed the celery and onion, added an extra bay leaf.  Thanks for a great soup!

Simple to make as it gets!  Great taste and worth the time it takes to simmer!  Made this for my hubby and a separate time for my mom when they had the flu.  My kids slurped it up, veggies and all!  Beats the stuff you buy in the can!

This is a very good, quick recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except I added a bit more carrot and a bit less celery and probably a few more noodles.  I will probably do the same next time except I'll likely add more carrots.  I cut the carrots and celery up a bit more than in the picture included with the recipe but I didn't want my 6 year old to pick them out.  I'll make this again!

Nice, easy recipe.  To save a step, you don't need to cook the chicken ahead of time.  Just add uncooked chicken breasts in step 2.  When they're cooked (~10 min), take them out, shred them with 2 forks, then toss the chicken back in the pot.

My family loved this soup....I did tweak it a bit, to suit out tastes.  I upped the carrots and onion to 3/4 of a cup, and added 11 tsps. of boullion granules, a couple of extra dashes of pepper, and used two packages of broken up Ramen noodles in place of egg noodles ( a little of their seasoning too).  There were no leftovers, and I have a family of 4!!  A keeper!!

I chopped up raw chicken and it cooked nicely.  Nice option for using leftover chicken too.  I used low salt chicken broth since I didn't have the cubes.  Good flavor with the spices.  Have made this twice!

I actually just made this last night, and my family loved it!  I made it vegetarian pretty easily too, all that I did was cut out the chicken, added extra celery, pepper, and carrots, and I made the noodles from scratch-just for fun.  I would suggest having a bit more water/vegetable stock if you like a lot of broth with your soup though.

We had this a couple weeks ago. Wow - it is delicious!  I also upped the carrots and onion, used rotissery chicken and chicken broth.  My 9 year old son didn't remember it until I showed him the picture of it on this site.  The he said "Oh, yeah,  that was awesome!"

This was a wonderful soup.  However I didn't make it exactly as written. I didn't use chicken bouillon and water.  Instead I made my own chicken broth using a cut up frying chicken.  I used the Basic Chicken Stock recipe from this site.  I also left the celery out.  (My family are not fond of celery in soup.)  I doubled the amount of carrots.  I also cut the parsley down to 1 tsp.  With these changes it was fantastic.

Great recipe to start with; I always alter recipes to suit my family lifestyle or taste.  I used one 2+lb. garlic rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  I rated this in 2006 as well. I use 4 stalks celery, 1 white onion, and 2 large carrots. I double pepper and add garlic salt to taste. I now I use all chicken broth (about 15 cups), with just a little "better than bouillon" paste for a richer flavor and healthier option overall than water and dried bouillon cubes. I used 10 oz. of wide egg noodles. Next time I'll make broth from the rotisserie chicken that I pick up at the grocery store to make it even more natural and affordable, or will buy a raw chicken and do it all myself!

Good comfort food.  Definitely use stock or broth instead of buillion.  I didn't have marjoram on hand but added some of my favorite herbs instead.  Yummy!

This turned out wonderfully tasty and was a complete hit. I shared leftovers with some relatives that loved it as well. However I did make my own stock as the base instead of using the  buillion.

How I love this recipe. It's what I'm cooking tonight, as a matter of fact. The only changes I've made are the addition of two small, diced potatoes, which help the broth to thicken, and I tweak the spices depending on my mood. I also let the chicken cook with the soup -- this improves the flavor of the broth -- and I use more onion and celery than it calls for -- this is a huge pot of soup and I like lots of onion and celery.  I hate brown chicken so I use only breast, but you could use either or both. You can't go wrong with this recipe.  You could also use canned chicken broth or homemade, frozen stock in place of the bouillion and water.

Very yummy recipe for chicken noodle soup. I do add a lot more carrots and celery than the recipe calls for, since those are key to a good soup. I have made this several times, and freeze leftovers for those "under the weather" days. I was contemplating making this in the crock pot next time, but after letting the soup simmer for a few hours on the stove, the veggies were a little too soft, so I will probably continue (over and over) to make this the traditional way since we like firmer veggies. But, this soup is wonderful!

This is an excellent and easy soup.  I added more veggies like others suggested,(except the onion) and since I don't like bouillon any way shape or form, and sure don't need that added salt, used low sodium chicken broth in place of the water and bouillon.

This was a wonderful soup recipe!  I added a few more cubes of bouillon because the broth seemed weak, but that may have been because I was using generic brand cubes.  But it was absolutely wonderul.  I used 16 oz frozen egg noodles and cooked it for over an hour.

I halved the chicken, added 2 bags of frozen egg noodles.  This was really good! It was really easy to put together too!  I am going to make a few batches and throw them in the freezer. Will be a winter staple.

This was a great recipe.  I tried it at home and then I tried it with my pre kindergarten class.  I scaled the recipe down a little bit.  It was easy to make and the children all had seconds.  We finished the whole pot.

Used a rotisserie chicken from Costco. Removed the meat and then boiled the carcass with celery to get all remaining meat off the bones. Had no marjoram, and I used dehydrated minced onions. Soup was outstanding! My husband came up from the basement to see what was cooking, saying he could smell it downstairs and it smelled soooo good!

This is my go-to soup for a week’s worth of leftovers that I never tire of. The flavor is perfect. I use either canned chicken from Costco or a cut-up rotisserie chicken and typically double the carrots.

I mostly followed the recipe, except I salted the veggies as they were initially cooking, I used 1 teaspoon of dried thyme and 1/4 teaspoon of powdered rosemary instead of marjoram (which I didn't have), and I seasoned it at the end with a little soy sauce (a tip I stole from Cook's Illustrated's recipe). I had leftover cooked chicken which I added with the noodles. It was delicious - exactly what we all wanted. Whole family enjoyed it.

Just for my notes from top reviewer... Here's what I did (and what you should do too): in melted butter, sauté 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 cup chopped onion, 1 cup chopped celery, and 1 cup sliced carrots. Meanwhile, chop 1/2 pound uncooked boneless, skinless chicken breast into bite-size pieces. Add chicken, the broth, basil, oregano, salt, garlic pepper, a dash or two of poultry seasoning, and a pinch or two of dried thyme to the pot of veggies. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes. Meanwhile, cook 3 cups egg noodles according to package directions in a separate pot. Add drained noodles to chicken and veggies, simmer an additional 10 minutes.

I'm sick today, and I've got one home from school with it as well.  We both needed a little chicken noodle soup for the soul.  I was going to pick up the canned stuff, then realized this recipe is just about as easy; I had all the ingredients at home already!  And homemade is always always yummier than what any store could give you.  Easily adaptable: adjust to your liking!  Freezer friendly (portion out a little before adding the noodles). A++++

I made this soup when my boyfriend was really sick. He said he didn't have an appetite, but would try eating a few bites. He ended up eating a big bowl of it and dunking French bread in it. It's the best chicken noodle soup the both of us have ever ate.

This was excellent. I was pressed for time and didn't have the usual hours to cook my soup. I made several changes and they were great. I used 2 rotisserie chickens, about 2.5 lbs per, 12 cups of chicken stock plus 8 cups of water and 8 bullion. I had about 1.5 cup of celery and 1/2 of a medium onion. I added 3 cloves of garlic and probably 1 cup of carrots. I used 1 stick of butter and softened all veggies and garlic in it on medium low. I then added both chickens, whole, dissolved the bullion in water then added to pot, 2 bay leaves, 1tsp of oregano, 1tsp of poultry seasoning, 4tbs of fresh parsley, 1tbs of pepper, 1tsp of salt and 1tsp of basil. I added a small bag of frozen corn as well right here.  I also used 16oz of egg noodles and with all that(which I added later), I probably could have used 1 more cup of chicken broth.  I cooked on medium for 30 minutes to let it boil some then pulled the chicken out and turned the heat to medium high. Drop the egg noodles and then took all of the meat off of the bone. 8 minutes later I added the chicken and turned off the heat. PERFECT!! Thank you.

This was very easy to make with simple ingredients. I used a lemon pepper rotisserie chicken from Publix, just cut the meat right off the bone. A whole chicken makes just the right amount for the recipe. As for the bay leaf, turns out it's optional. I forgot the bay leaf but soup tasted delicious anyway. My suggestion would be to prepare all the chopped ingredients the day or night before you want to cook. Otherwise the chopping will add another 30 minites to prep time.

I make this in the crock pot. I dump all the ingredients except for the noodles in the crock before I leave for work. I add the noodles when I get home and dinner is ready. I use whole boneless skinless chicken breasts from Costco or SAMs and canned broth. Easy easy.

I tried to follow the recipe as written but had to use what I had at home, so less chicken, about 1 cup more carrots because some reviews said it was lacking in vegetables and this is how I get them into my family. After I started cooking I realized I didn't have any marjoram. A quick look at reviews showed that oregano and thyme were good, so I split the amount for marjoram between the two. Very good. Smelled great cooking. Will definitely make again. Oh, I added 3 cloves of garlic but I really didn't notice it so I could have skipped it. My husband loved it too.

Doubled onion and carrots. Sautéed veggies and minced garlic with dried herbs before adding to stock (I used Swanson broth instead of water). Had to skim off the floating onion, celery, and herbs so picky kids would eat. Overall great recipe.

Quick and tasty!  I read a bunch of reviews before making this, and followed some suggested revisions.  I used 1 cup of chopped carrots, rather than 1/4....48 oz of Swanson Natural Goodness Lower Sodium Chicken Broth, rather than 12 c water and bouillon cubes.  Then my own revisions were using unsalted butter, a chopped rotisserie chicken, and 12 oz of Mrs. Miller's old Fashioned wide egg noodles (I didn't boil the noodles ahead of time, I threw them in with the rest of the soup for the last 10 minutes). My first time making 'almost' homemade chicken noodle soup, I immediately added it to my kitchen recipe box.  This one is a keeper, I will be sure to make it lots in the future, and pass it on to my little ones when they get older and have their own kitchens!

Delicious and so easy.  Used leftover Costco rotisserie chicken and the real secret is use Better than Bouillion instead of chicken broth or bouillion cubes.  I like carrots and used a lot more.  You won't be dissappointed!

I have made this several times and it is very forgiving! I do not use butter to sautee, we used EVOO. I also shredded the chicken instead of chunking it up and we liked that much more. We used low sodium no MSG chicken stock instead, as that is the base for any of our chicken soups in this house. We also added double the amount of egg noodles as we wanted a heartier soup. So good the next day and the day after as left overs! This has been made at least a dozen times in the past few months in our house and it always disappears. We did freeze one batch and then re-heated it about three weeks later and it was still very good.

Delicious! I've been fending off a cold, and even though I've never made homemade chicken soup before, I decided I wanted to make some of my own just in case this cold gets the upper hand.  I doubled the carrots, and used low-sodium chicken broth.  I also added a can of green beans to increase my veggie intake.  I've already had two bowls for lunch, and just might make this my dinner as well!  Thanks for the recipe Sherry!

Good chicken noodles soup base. I make this frequently.  I add asparagus with the carrots and rest of ingredients, and use more parsley than called for.  I am not exact with celery and carrot, or chicken amounts, and I used a whole onion.  I also used 6 cubes of bouillon and 12 cups of water.  I think the next time I do this, I will use a little less butter.  I brought everything to a boil and simmered for 30 minutes, then added noodles (about twice as called for) and cooked for another 10 minutes as recipe said.

Love this recipe. I used rotisserie chicken from Costco and Costco's Kirkland chicken stock to keep the sodium low. I make a pot for lunches almost every week.

Absolutely, hands down the best chicken noodle soup I've ever had. As with every recipe I tweaked it, but only slightly. I used a whole onion, 4 cloves of garlic, a dash of sage and thyme, and as for the liquid, I boiled the chicken and used it's liquid and added 3 cups of organic chicken broth. I used NO bouillon. Very flavorful. The key for soups is always to saute the veggies first to bring out their flavor. Great recipe, saved!

This is the first time I have ever made any type of noodle soup and it was easy. My family thought it was incredibly delicious and my youngest son even asked me to pack it for his lunch at school the next day. Since I love soups with lots of veggies, I added 2 cups of carrots, 1 cup of diced onions, 2 cups of diced celery, 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic, and 2 T. marjoram. Instead of bouillon cubes, I made a richer tasting broth by boiling the bones and skin of a store bought rotisserie chicken for about 30 minutes. After removing the bones and skin from the pot of broth, I added the veggies, herbs and shredded rotisserie chicken. Because I was afraid that the uncooked noodles were going to absorb too much of the broth, I boiled the noodles separately in salted water until it was between uncooked and al dente. I had to add another 2 cups of water to the broth because the noodles absorbed more liquid as the soup simmered. I served the soup with warmed butter rolls.

Like other reviewers, I used stock and chicken broth. I put 2 cups carrots and celery and used Reames noodles. I also use a whole chicken. We like a hardy soup. I upped the spices and add a few cloves of garlic as well. This is a great base recipe to tweek to what you and your family like.

This was soooooooo good! I used a rotisserie chicken for convenience and added a can of cream of chicken soup. It was absolutely delicious! Everyone loved it...such a warm comfort food on a snowy winter day! Next time, I'll not add the can of soup so that it'll be more broth like. But either way, it's a 5 star winner!

Great soup! i made the following changes: when i cooked the chicken, i added a 1/4 tsp turmeric and salt and pepper. i just steamed it in it's own water until cooked through. then i removed the chicken from the pot and followed the recipe steps. when i added the chicken back, I included the little water that was remaining from when i cooked the chicken. i didnt have celery on hand so used celery salt instead. i didnt have any marijoram either so left it out. i used 6 chicken stocl cubes for the 6 cups of water. tasted great! I made enough for 4 but my husband and i gulped it down in one night :).

So easy, so good! Put everything in the crockpot, used rotisserie chicken so it was even easier!  Used quinoa instead of noodles and it gave it a nuttier taste and turned out great.

WONDERFUL!! I will NEVER buy canned chicken noodle soup again! I always bust up lasagna noodles to use. I like the thickness and unevenness of them. Best tasting soup ever! My kids inhale it when I make it and are excited when it's for supper!

Oh, wonderful!  Fantastic!  I needed to use up some green onions so I used those instead of regular onion; loved it!

Love this easy recipe. First time making the dish but I know I will make again in the future! I wanted a thicker soup so I added a few tsp of all purpose flour. But not too much because you don't want it to resemble chicken & dumplings too much !

This was my first attempt at soup and it was deee-licious!  The only thing I did different was -- while my chicken was boiling, I boiled the carrots and celery in the water called for on the recipe rather than sautéing them. I also did not add onion as my family doesn't like it.  I then added the rest of the ingredients.  It will definitely be made again!!

I make this often to bring to moms in my playgroup who have had babies, and for my family.  I use rotisserie chicken.  Instead of the water and bouillon, I use 2 cartons of chicken broth and 1 of chicken stock.  If I have them on hand, I sometimes add peas.  Other than that, I follow the recipe to a tee and its always good, always easy.

Love this recipe!! Easy to make! I made some changes. I doubled the carrots, celery and chicken, added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and added an additional cup of water. The soup was extra hearty and the kids loved it!!

I will never buy canned chicken noodle soup again.  This recipe is great.  I made very minor adjustments: used fresh parsley, not dried.  Also used two boxes of chicken broth plus 3 cups water/2 bouillon cubes.  It was delicious and soothed my family's colds.  Thank you for this one!

Absolutely delicious! Best chicken soup, ever. I did not change any of the ingredients, but I did change the way I put it together. I put the butter, onion and celery in the crockpot for about 40 minutes. Then I added the leftover grilled chicken I had and all the other ingredients except the noodles. After about 5 hours I added the thick, homemade style, dried noodles and cooked another hour. So much easier than my old method, and the family liked it better!

This soup was delicious and easy to make. The only things I did different were that I added extra veggies and used a whole bag of egg noodles to make it a little heartier. I also shredded a rotisserie chicken

Loved it!  Made a few minor changes but will definitely make it again. I doubled the bay leaf and black pepper, added 1 can of corn (drained), and 1 clove of minced garlic.  I also found that I needed more broth so I added 2 boxes of Swansons chicken broth 32 oz each. I like the chicken broth better as opposed to the bouillon because it is not as salty!

I thought this was a wonderful, very easy, very quick chicken soup recipe.  I tried another recipe before this that called for the stock to be from scratch (boiling a chicken, etc.) and this recipe was just as good if not better.  I like the spice better on this one too, and it took 1/3 the time!  

I only made a few small changes.  I didn't have marjoram, so I used 1/2 tsp of thyme and 1/4 tsp celery salt.  I also ended up adding half a can of cream of chicken soup, because I like my soup a little thicker and creamier.  But the broth before I added it was delicious, so don't think the soup needed it.  I threw in a few more vegetables that I had on hand as well.  But even without them, the soup would have been flavorful and good.  My husband, who is picky about his chicken soup, ate two bowls and my mother said it was probably the best chicken soup she's ever had!  That's quite a compliment coming from my mother!

Awesome Recipe! I did change a few things. I didn't use water at all I used 3 1/2 boxes of Chicken Broth, I added 2 tablespoons of Garlic Powder, 7 cubes of chicken Bouillon.
      I bought 4 boneless chicken breasts and baked them in the oven at 340 degrees for 35 mins and I made sure to cover each of them in olive oil and pepper. I wanted this soup to be as fresh as possible.

So good.  I think next time I will use broth instead.  I make this and then freeze individual portions to thaw out for quick healthy lunches instead of buying expensive processed canned soups.  Almost better straight out of the freezer.

This soup definitely has the main ingredients right as far as the chicken, carrots, celery and onion goes, but it was very salty the first time around. The next time I made it I used a 49 1/2 ounce can of Swanson's chicken broth and added extra water as needed to my desired amount of broth. I used about a cup of carrots as I wanted this to be hearty. I used 2 bouillon chicken cubes as they are very high in sodium and oregano with a bit of pepper. All in all, pretty decent recipe.

I made this in a large stove pot. Fallowed the general directions but doubled the celery and carrots. Added 1 clove garlic-chopped and chicken broth istead of water and bouillon. The stock ended up only filling 2c so I used canned broth for the other 8c. Xtra salt & pepper for flavor. The egg noodles do a great job soaking up the chicken flavor. Not specified: Cover pot while simmering 3o min, add noodles, turn up heat to Med-High for 5 min, then back down to Med for final 5. Stir. + S&P 2taste!

This is a great recipe.  This was the first soup I ever made.  It didn't come out perfectly, but I think that's because I'm a novice when it comes to cooking with my slow cooker.  I used 1 cup of carrots, skipped the marjoram and parsley because I didn't have it on hand, used 8 oz of penne pasta and chicken base for bouillon.  I undercooked the penne and drained it, but I still managed to get a little too soggy in crockpot.  Also, I have never used chicken base before and didn't realize that it would be that much saltier than boullion.  I am going to make it again, but this time, add the penne uncooked, boil the chicken and shred it and dilute the chicken base more.  I just know it will come out fabulous!

First of all i use 2 48 ounce boxes of Swanson chicken broth, a little over a cup each of carrots and celery,added some minced garlic and used about a cup and a half of Reames frozen egg noodles. I have never had a better chicken noodle soup than this, and my 2 young daughters absolutly love it!!!

This is my go-to chicken noodle soup recipe.  Easy & delicious!  I do add extra seasoning/herbs, but that's due to personal preference.

I have always wanted to make chicken noodle soup and this was the first recipe I found that was so easy I tried it. My family loves it. I add mixed veggies and more then called for. I also double the chicken bouillon cubes. Very delicious. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us it is in my recipe box forever.

This turned out very good. I always adjust recipes to my liking. A french Chef once taught me to use ketchup in soups etc for a deeper taste. I like to add about a tablespoon to my soups, really adds to the flavor. I used a bag of frozen veg mix. & evtras wide egg noodles. Even better the 2nd day.

Great soup, even my picky kids ate it!  Followed another reviewer and added the whole rotisserie chicken to the pot, simmered with everything but the noodles for about 20 minutes.  Added the noodles and took the chicken out and shredded it.  Simmered for another 10 minutes.  Great recipe!

LOVED this soup. Really excellent flavor!! I followed some tweaks from other reviews. I used 2 boxes of chicken broth and 1 box of chicken stock (4 cups). I also doubled the onion, carrots and celery and added some extra chicken because I like a little heartier soup. Next time I think I'm going to try a different type of noodle though, I prefer a softer, more dough-like noodle in my chicken soup. Oh, and I didn't use parsley this time because I did not have any but it tasted great all the same.

Used boneless chicken breast since that's all I had on hand, and was able to make this in under an hour.  Was super tasty and so simple to make.

OMG This was so easy to make and not very time consuming.  If you want an easy recipe use this one.  Although I did add more carrot then it called for, I put in a cup, wished I would have put in a little more though.  Great Recipe.  I will definitely make this over and over again.

Oh my goodness! I've been searching for a chicken noodle soup recipe for a long time. Previous ones never seem to turn out right. I absolutely loved this one. It was simple but so flavorful. I did make a few minor adjustments... I used a lot more carrots than called for. I did use 4 c. swanson chicken broth and 8 c. water with 5 bouillon cubes. I skipped the marjoram, only for a lack of having it on hand. And I did everything in the crock pot. I cooked my chicken in there earlier in the day, then added everything else. I will definitely be making this again and again!

Screwed up and didn't have fresh carrots and had to use frozen.  I also didn't sautee anything.  Threw it all in the pot and let it simmer since I wasn't feeling well.  Hubby isn't a soup person but came back for seconds.  Will probably make again as it was simple but not knock your socks off.

Absolutely delicious.  I made the follow changes:  I used the Boiled Chicken recipe here to prepare chicken (added two chicken bullion cubes to the recipe).  Then used 5 cups of the stock in the soup.  Also used 4 14.5 oz. cans of Swanson chicken broth (low sodium).  Then, eliminated the water and bullion cubes from this chicken soup recipe.  Doubled the butter, pepper, and onion, and added some garlic.  Used one cup of carrots, but next time I will used two cups.  This recipe really screams for more carrots.  I also added one cup of sweet yellow corn.  It all turned out fantastically.  This soup is so smooth and delicious.  Everyone loved it and had seconds.

Deelicious! Great recipe but I tweaked it a bit.  I seasoned 8 frozen chicken tenders with a local season blend called “Slap Ya Mama” and garlic powder. Then I steamed my tenders with the frozen carrots, celery and onion.  I omitted the butter for a low fat version as well as the marjoram and added one more bay leaf.  The stock from my chicken was my base to add more water for a good boil.  Add your noodles and a dash more of “Slap Ya Mama” and parsley.  The taste will be soooo good that your momma, like mine, thought it was store bought chicken noodle soup.

Everybody liked this soup, followed all the ingredients with the exception of using the chicken bouillon because I had none on hand so I used chicken broth instead.

Excellent!  Made it last night and used whole wheat noodles for the first time and couldn't tell difference!  I did substitute chicken base from GFS for the bouillon and used water from boiling my chicken breasts for some of the water called for.  Will make again and again!  Froze leftovers to use for easy brown bag lunches.  Thanks!

This was great and even got a high five from the husband.  I did double the onions, celery and chicken and used a 1/2 cup butter.  Didn't have egg noodles so I used spiral vegetable noodles.

I loved this soup. It was easy to make and most of the ingridients are in stock in my kitchen. I did use spaghetti instead of egg noodles and I added mushrooms. The herbs weren't as strong as I thought they would be. Yummy! Excellent for cold weather!!!! Definitely will make it again the kids loved it.

I made a double batch of this soup, and it still didn't last long in my house.  Very easy to make and flavorful.  I boiled chicken breast to use because that's what I had and used the broth from that in the soup.  Worked out great.

Very good...I used canned chicken breast and it only the changed the flavor of the chicken.  The soup was still very yummy and full of flavor.

This may be the best chicken noodle soup I've ever eaten.  Very simple and flavorful.  I did use the water/bouillon, but the chicken was cooked while making stock in another recipe so it added another layer of flavor.  This didn't seem to have a ton of extra broth as some soups have, but that would be an easy way to stretch this recope for more servings.

This is a great basic recipe. The reason I didn't give it five stars was because I still had to make minor changes. I added a bit more flavor by putting in Different and/or more spices that it called for.

Soup was good.  I used 32 oz of Chicken broth and a few cups of water and the bouillon cubes.  I added a pinch of white pepper, and a few shakes of italian seasoning, oregano, marjoram, salt/pepper, garlic powder, celery seed, bay leaf, dried parsley and dried basil.  I added 1/2 clove of minced garlic. I used rice instead of noodles and I used a precooked lemon/herb chicken from the food store.

Delicious and easy!  I just used a store-bought rotisserie chicken and pulled the meat, and used 3 cups of chicken stock and 5 bouillon cubes instead.  Yummy and great for cold nights!

Excellent, this has become a new staple in our cooking choices. I did use actual chicken broth rather than the bullion cubes so that made a difference, it was a fuller flavor. I also did a little multi-tasking and chopped my veggies and sauteed them while I chopped and cooked the chicken breast. Cooking the chicken took a little longer so to keep the veggies from getting over done I let them begin boiling in the chicken broth and then added the meat when it was ready.

This was excellent!  I added 1T. minced garlic, 1/2c. long grain rice, 3med. potatoes, 1/2t. thyme and only had about 2c. chicken---my 6yr old asked if we could have it again tomorrow and that "we should put this in the "favorites" recipe book!  Very great for all of us with sick ones!

First attempt making this. It was so easy I left out the margorum and bayleaf (don't care for either flavor) but it came out really well I also cut down the amount of stock and used Wyler's bullion crystals. Made for a very pretty soup. Being a single mom in a 2 person household I separated it into canning jars and let cool to store in the fridge for up to a week. I also shared with my best friend. Was perfect for lunch at work, simply pour the amount needed and store the rest for the next day.

This soup is awesome... if you make a few changes.  First, I use a whole rotisserie chicken.  I cut off the breasts and then let the rest of the chicken sit for awhile in the broth.  Also, I use chicken stock and broth (Swanson's) like someone else suggested instead of water and bouillon cubes. Finally, I added extra celery and carrots and added a little fresh garlic when sauteing the celery and onions.

I ended up making this in the crockpot...I did everything as directed and then just cooked on high for 4 hours. It came out deliciously! I ended up omitting the celery (as I had none), using 3 carrots, and 1 chicken hindquarter. I agree with another review that garlic and some salt would really make this soup even better! Mine also kind of "gelled" up after I refrigerated it and heated up some as leftovers, it was still good, but I found it kind of weird that it would do that.

Super yummy.  Cooking the onions and celery in butter is the secret to the great flavor.  Even better with homemade noodles.

Good soup.  I use the "boiled chicken" recipe from this site, replace the water with a mix of the stock from boiling my chicken and canned chicken broth, add a little garlic, and use Reames frozen egg noodles, because they are hearty and taste homemade.  My four year old son loves when I make this!

This recipe adapted very well to a vegetarian version.  I used vegetable bouillon and vegetarian "chik'n" patties, chopped up, for the meat.  I reduced the amount of bouillon somewhat`and added extra celery since I had some I wanted to use up.  My whole family loved this, meat-eaters and vegetarians alike.

Excellent.  Used rice, Alex loved it.  Needed more carrots.  Used chicken breast, uncooked, seasoned it with my usual soy sauce, garlic powder.  Need to cook for at least an hour.

This is a great tasting soup.  I made one change, however.  Since I did not have any parsley,  I added a tablespoon of dried basil. It really did give the soup  a good flavor.  Also 4 ounces of noodles is enough, to me at least.  I will definitely make this again.

Very decent recipe. Am not a fan of the powdered boullion, so I substituted about 10 cups of organic chicken broth for the cubes and water. As well, cut the celery in half as I am not too big of a fan and used herbes en provence instead of the marjoram. Definitely hits the spot for comfort food.

Thanks for the recipe! This one was a little "labor-intensive" for me (I'm a lazy cook) but it was still worth it since it makes so much soup. I tripled the veggies and it still wasn't enough for me, next time I will add even more. I also used the no-yolk egg noodles (12 oz) and thought it tasted great. Also, I only used 6 Knorr's Caldo de Pollo Bouillion cubes, and it was plenty salty for me. Thanks again for the recipe!

My family absolutely loved this recipe! I ended up having to use broth stock instead of the water and bullion and did not have a bay leaf on hand... but this was so wonderfully wamr and definitely made us cozy on a cold night.

I made some changes, mostly of necessity. I did mine in a large crock pot for several hours. I didn't have any celery or bay leaf. The chicken was a left over roasted chicken from the night before. I added chopped chives and a sweet bell pepper along with some garlic. I may have altered the ratios a bit, too, as my batch is considerably larger. My first attempt at making chicken noodle soup and the family gave it great reviews. I'll be doing this again but since I like celery I'll be sure to have some here.

LOVE this recipe. I like to make this recipe the day after I make a large roasted chicken. I roast the chicken in an oven bag, with onions and lots of carrots. Then I use the leftover chicken meat and the carrots in this soup (I toss the carrots in at the end when I throw in the pasta). YUMMY!  My kids LOVE this soup!

Tasted bland, and way too much celery. Unfortunately, canned soups are better than this one.

This was delicious. My husband made this (I don't normally like his soup, but I had 2 bowls!) using the leftover Cornish Game Hens we had for Thanksgiving (Cornish Hens with Garlic and Rosemary from this site). He used the boiled hen broth instead of bouillon but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. It was perfect!

Really good chicken soup recipe. I used one package of raw chicken tenders cut to 1/2" pieces.  Instead of adding 12 cups of water, I added three cans of Swanson's chicken broth and filled two cans with water (total of 28 ounces). I then added a heaping teaspoon of chicken flavored "Better than Bullion" which can be purchased from Walmart. I also added a clove of chopped garlic and about a cup of leftover cooked rice instead of noodles. It was Y-U-M-M-Y !!!

great starter but as others said not enough veggies(I like veggies!)tried some other things as well the celery and chicken soups were a great idea, as was the garlic.  this will be a new soup for lunch instead of the usual caned stuff. just serve with a good roll.

This recipe was pretty darn good--especially for my first attempt at making chicken noodle soup.  However, I'm rating it a 3 because I think that there could have been a little more flavor, and because I like a lot more vegetables in soup, and I didn't think this called for nearly enough.  I put more vegetables in than suggested (and added broccoli in addition to the celery and carrots) and I still thought there could have been more vegetables.  But, it was really thick--and that was great.  All in all, it was a great meal.

This soup is great! I'm not a soup fan but I'm having surgery and will need to live on it for a few days. I substituted alphabet noodles to please my toddler and used Swanson low-sodium broth for 8 of the twelve cups. Then I used 2 cups of water, 1 pack of Herbox chicken broth (w/seasoning), and the juice from the pan I baked my chicken in... YUMMY!

I made this tonight for my family.  I didn't have any boullon so just used the broth off of the chicken that I cooked.  I was also out of marjoram so I used 1/4 tsp of poultry seasoning.  My family loved it.  They voted it a KEEPER.  Will definitely make again soon.

This was very good. Comfort food. I fixed it and the very next day came down with a horrible cold. So this was perfect timing even though I was under the weather.
Thanks for the recipe.

I thought the soup lacked flavor.  Next time I would probably use actual chicken broth instead of the cubes.

My family loved this. My husband and I both had 3 bowls and my 7 year old daughter said mmmm and had 2 bowls. There were no left overs. I only changed a few things. I added cilantro, used green onions and omitted the celery. I will be making this again. It kind of reminded me of my grandmas soup. Thank you for posting.

This soup was REALLY good!!  It wasn't grandma's chicken noodle soup, which is what I was hoping for, but I'm really pleased I found this recipe (I will continue to search for grandma's, but will still make this often!).  The first day I thought the marjoram really overpowered the other flavors, but once it sat in the fridge for a day it had a chance to mellow and was absolutely perfect!!  :)  I doubled the veggies, used meat from a store bought rotisserie, used whole wheat egg noodles, and added 1/2 c frozen peas and 1 tsp minced garlic.  Can't say enough good things!!  :)

This turned out great.  I used the leftover meat from a whole roasted chicken, and homeade broth instead of bouillon and water.  I also left out celery (don't like it) and bay leaf (had none), and added peas.  Very tasty and easy.  My husband couldn't get enough!  Will definitely make again.

This soup was quite easy for my first time.  I left out the marjoram and bay leaf because I was all out.  I just boiled some hearty chicken thighs and followed the directions.  Next time I will add the other ingredients and I am sure it will turn out even better. I definitely would make this again ans it's SO easy!

Delicious, I simmered this for 8 hours and it was wonderful, I used 3 boxes of chicken broth and added extra spices following all the others advice, I also cut the butter to 1 tbsp and it was a lovely soup.

My family LOVES this so much I double my recipe whenever I make it.  Instead of egg noodles though, try it with rice noodles - stir fry style in oriental section.  Sounds crazy but it's gluten-free and we like it better than with the egg noodles.

I am thoroughly impressed with the awesome flavor of this recipe.  It's matched only by the ease of the recipe.  I cooked this for a weeknight dinner and it was just fabulous.  The marjoram is perfect with this soup.  My 4 year old son had 2 bowls.  I will definitely be making this again.

We loved this recipe!  I made it in the crockpot and added the noodles at the end.  The noodles needed longer than I thought though.  I only gave them a few minutes (they were homemade) and they needed at least 15 minutes or so.

Tasty, quick and a great use for leftover rotisserie chicken. I only had 5 bouillon cubes so I used 4 cans of low sodium chicken broth plus 2 cups of water and as another reviewer suggested, I broke up thin spaghetti noodles to substitute for egg noodles. The broth was a tad salty so I'll adjust for that next time but overall, my family loved it! Thanks for sharing!

BEST chicken noodle soup I have ever had! My family was literally licking the bowl when they were done eating! I added chicken thighs and breasts and about 1/2 lb more than the recipe called for (my fam are serious meat eaters) but other than that I followed the recipe just as written.

I was feeling a bit under the weather so made this soup today.  I used leftover rotisserie chicken that I had on hand.  Like some other reviewers I used Reames frozen noodles.  This soup was so good and such a comfort food!  It has good flavor  and I enjoyed it.  Looking forward to another bowl for my lunch tomorrow!

Great soup! I used a 48 oz box of chicken broth, plus two 32 oz boxes of chicken stock (instead of water/cubes). Put in extra carrots too. Will definitely make this again!

my family loved this! I used leftover rotisserie chicken, added extra carrots and celery. I also had about 2 cups of chicken broth that I threw in and it turned out amazing. my husband and i love to top it with crispy fried onions which makes it over the top for us. It gets better every day you eat it and we can typically get 2 to 3 meals out of this.

For our taste I would use less chicken. My half recipe I will cut down to 6oz raw chicken to begin. Also will use less noodles. My dry measure read 12 oz and I will reduce to 8 oz dry. Great taste though.

Was super delicious. Lots of flavor. I did use the suggestion of using a whole already baked chicken. Shredded the meat off and added. I did add about 1 tsp. Of dry garlic pieces. My family aren’t very big on soup, but this one every one wanted seconds. Will be making again

One of the best chicken soup recipes I've ever used. Incredibly flavorful and filling.  I will defiantly use this recipe again.  I added a little salt, but other then that used the recipe just as listed.

Really good! Made this for a friend when she had the flu. I would replace the water and bouillon cubes with chicken broth and then add salt to taste, and definitely more veggies! :)

This recipe is simple...and amazing.
I added a twist
.. used Better Than Bullion and added 2 fresh cloves of garlic.
Try it.

The stock has flavor and the bigger noodles make this soup hearty and a great stand alone meal on a cold autumn day.

By far the best chicken soup I have ever had! Anybody who gave this a horrible review has no clue. Especially if they used the word "chix" instead of "chicken". HA!

I always make the noodles separately, and add them to each serving pre-cooked.  That way, the noodles do not get gloopy in the soup!

My first time making Chicken Soup. It came out wonderful. Mine was a bit thicker as I only made half a batch and used a little more noodles and less water. The seasoning ratio was perfect.

Absolutely delicious flavor. I made the recipe exactly as shown. My noodles were a bit mushy. I suggest making the broth and letting it develop. Add the noodles a few minutes before serving. Very easy to make and wonderful flavor. I served it with French bread.

This recipe is pretty basic and bland. I did use bone broth instead of bouillon cubes which is healthier, more flavorful, and has much less sodium, but the seasonings for this fell short. I'm disappointed in the huge amount of bland soup I have left over, but I'm going to try to jazz it up with more herbs and spices.

I used rotisserie chicken from Costco to make this recipe. In lieu of the bouillon, I opted to make my own bone broth which adds several extra hours of cook time to the recipe. It’s worth it though. Trim off all the meat and set aside. Cook the rotisserie carcass in water salted with sea salt, fresh cracked peppercorns, a few bay leaves, a red onion, carrots, and a few garlic cloves. After simmering for several hours, strain everything off. Then proceeded to make the recipe as suggested. It was very delicious.

My family loved this soup, so yes, I'll be making it again!  I didn't have Marjoram on hand, so I substituted Oregano (use a tad less than what's called for because Oregano has a little stronger taste).  I also didn't have egg noodles so I used, cut spaghetti, which is probably what I'll always use.  Thank you, Sherry, for this great recipe!

I'm not normally a chicken noddle fan unless the broth is made from scratch, but this was the best alternative I've found to date.  

I do increase the carrots, and every time I make it I remember when its done that I should increase the water/bouillon a bit too. It's a hearty soup and needs a little more broth.  

I don't like my noodles mushy so rather than add them to the soup I cook them separate and add them to my bowl when I'm ready to eat.

This was the first time I made chicken soup and it turned out great!! I followed some suggestions to double the veggie portions (except celery), I added peas and corn and minced garlic, i followed the boiled chicken recipe on this site using chicken thighs, and I didnt add the bay leaf bc I didnt have any.  I also used linguini instead of egg noodles. I also used the broth made from the boiled chicken recipe and added more chicken broth. Lots of steps were made, but it was worth it in the end!! Served this with bread and butter :)

I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 boxes broth instead of water and bouillon cubes. I added 1/2 bag frozen peas just because I had some. I didn’t have marjoram but used dry Italian seasonings (first ingredient is marjoram) and happened to have fresh oregano so chopped that finely and threw that in. I did add a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken it slightly. Soup was requested by hubby who woke up sick today and this recipe gets thumbs up from the patient ????

This recipe was easy and great. I used leftover turkey from a roast instead of chicken. Great for a lazy day in when it’s cold out :-)

This was delicious and simple. I only used chicken thighs because that was all I had. I added 4 garlic cloves because I add garlic to everything. I wanted it a bit thicker so I also added 3 tablespoons of flour to thicken it and it was perfect.  My husband came down with the  flu and asked for chicken noodle soup so this is his new favorite.  No more canned soup!

Definitely making this again! Costco sells a 2# package of breast meat. All I had to do was shred it and that reduced the prep time.

I used the water from the pot of boiling chicken breast in place of water or chicken broth. I also used 6 bouillon cubes instead of 9. Next time I make this I will use another pasta since the egg noodles became pretty soft. The night I made this my son was coming down with a cold. I had him eat a couple bowls and he woke up the next morning in perfect health. I stored the leftovers in quart size freezer bags so I can easily pull out an individual serving. When doing that, I add a bit of water to the pot and warm on a very low heat.

I made a half recipe (5 servings), but probably tripled the amount of onion, celery, carrots and bay leaves.  For the broth, I used the 'Roasted Chicken Broth' recipe from this site. I also added some bottled squeeze-type garlic. Tastes better a day or two after made. Delicious on a cold, fall day!

Soup turned out great. The only thing I did different was to season my chicken prior to and marinate it overnight. I also added fresh, chopped parsley at the end.

Made exactly as described.  Really good.  For a little thicker broth I might add a little cream next time but only because I like it that way. Great recipe and easy.

This was not good. It’s a great recipe, but after I made it to the exact instructions it was severely bland. I doubled the seasonings and added some better than bouillon. I also use chicken thighs and a dash of garlic, bay leaf and a touch of love. The remix I made the second time was excellent! If you like spice sometimes i add hot sesame oil to it.

Very good! Will definitely make this again. I used 24 oz. Reames frozen Homestyle Egg Noodles and added more carrots and celery. Using a Rotisserie chicken made it quick and tastey.

Very basic recipe. If you want better flavor you have to put some more work in: 

Use frozen raw chicken back 4 pieces  and whole chicken. Break down and separate bones and meat. Use all the bones for broth. 

Mirepoix should be 50 %onion/25% carrots/25% celery

Add more onion. I cut extra halves onion and throw in pot for sweeter flavor 
Add stalks of fresh parsley and fresh garlic (toss later when ready so serve)

One of the best chicken noodle soups I had! It also makes the house smell amazing! I did cut back on the butter to lesson the greasiness. However, my husband said he liked it both ways. I guess it depends on your preference. This is a keep for our family! :)

The only addition I made was more carrots. We like carrots so I increased it to a cup of carrots. My husband said next time use less celery and even more carrots but I was fine with the celery. 
I also used a rotisserie chicken and feel that made a difference as well. 
I told my daughter that I have to review this soup because it was so yummy! It made enough for us to eat on for a couple of days and we ate every drop.

I used chicken thighs for the cooked chicken meat and this soup was incredible! Used my vacuum sealer to freeze the left overs in bags and I can just drop them in boiling water when I'm ready to reheat.

I’ve made this several times over the past couple years and it’s the best! There’s been a couple times I just ran to the store and used a rotisserie style chicken or  flavored rotisserie chicken! I have not been disappointed at all in this recipe m!

Very delicious and easy to prepare. I took the suggestions of others that previously rated this recipe and cooked it in the Crockpot for six hours. Added the noodles after fours hours and let them cook for two.  Also added one chopped jalapeño and one can of black olives diced. This will become one of my go to meals.

Great recipe, and versatile as well. I followed the instructions for the most part. I did substitute a box of chicken stock for part of the required water. Because I use low sodium stock I added four chicken bouillon to make up some of the sodium lost with the stock. Lastly, I added two small fresh mushrooms chopped finely, and a couple of extra medium carrots. It was delicious!!!

The soup was so easy to make and was delicious.  But the rosemary was overpowering   I would leave it out next time.  I cooked the noodles separately as suggested.  Excellent winter night dinner.

This is very good.  I used 3 32 oz. boxes of chicken broth and the meat from a store bought rotisserie chicken left from the previous nights dinner.  I did increase the carrots and celery.  Yum!

The directions that are written are different than the directions in the video. Next time I will look at both before making. The carrots were hard, likely because the written direction never said to boil only simmer...I should have known better. The flavor is lacking too, not sure what exactly is missing but it tastes bland.

Used homemade noodles and broth instead of bullion. Added extra carrots and didn’t have bay leaves or parsley, so skipped those. Everyone ate it, which is saying something!

This was very good and a perfect fit for a snowy and cold day.  I think I will use more water and broth next time.  I opted to use chicken broth rather than bullion. I was making it for a friend who was sick and she requested double noodles, which is why I probably needed more liquid.  But no complaints...it was fantastic, and easy.

First off, I don't know what happened but this was removed from my favorites & I was devastated! I should know this recipe by heart now, but I always need to make sure. I saved this years ago when I first got married & was just learning my way around the kitchen. Fast forward some 7-8 years later & this is STILL one of my hubby's favs & now my kids too! The seasonings, the bullion... the best!!!! Over the years I've tweaked it a tiny bit, but only by using a whole bag of baby peel carrots & like 5 stalks of celery rather than the 1/4 cup it calls for. I have requests all the time for this soup from friends & family whenever someone is feeling blue or under the weather because it makes you feel the warm fuzzies. Nothing better than some homemade chicken noodle soup & this is by far the best recipe!!

Rotisserie chicken for the win!!! Easy recipe. Sautéed the onions and celery, threw in carrots after adding 7 cups of Swanson chick broth, can of creamy chicken soup, along with the spices. Let it simmer as directed and turned out wonderful!

This soup is a family favorite. I have made it more than five times. I've learned to alter it here and there. Adding chicken stock in addition to cups of water. Changing the vegetables that I added to it as well. All I can say is the best chicken noodle soup ever.

To make it healthier and a little more interesting....  I used 2 cups carrots, 2 cups celery, 2 cups mushrooms, 1 container of kale, and 1/2 tsp minced garlic.  Used reduced-sodium chicken stock instead of the bouillon cubes.  Lastly, used half the suggested amount of noodles.  Turned out great!

Pretty darn good! A basic yummy chicken noodle soup recipe. The broth was very flavorful. I agree with a previous reviewer who said you can put in even more liquid and it won't hurt a thing; also, I just put a couple of frozen chicken breasts in to cook with the rest of the veggies and it all turned out great. Very good and very easy!

I added garlic, olive oil, and black pepper to the sauteed onion. (I didn't have celery.) I partially cooked my chicken separate with pepper, cajun seasoning and lemon juice. Then I added everything with the seasonings/ flavorings, water and rice instead of noodles, let it boil until the chicken was cooked and rice soft. I then added leftover snack veggies and let it simmer. The soup is one of the best I've ever made.

Awesome! I have been making this soup for a long time -  my eight children and my husband love it and frequently request it. I buy a rotisserie chicken that I let the kids have some pickings from before I boil it to get the broth and every ounce of meat off of it. I still add the bouillon for flavor to whatever broth I have, and add water as necessary to get 12 cups. We do add a bit more noodles, but other than that, no changes. Wonderful recipe.

Loved this recipe! I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and it was delicious. I did add some changes: added 1 squash, 1 zucchini, doubled the seasonings and also used chicken stock instead of bouillon cubes. But I will definitely be making this again and maybe with more changes.

I make this soup almost every time after my family has roast chicken. I boil the chicken carcass to make the necessary chicken stock and use the leftover chicken. I reduced the chicken bullion to two cubes, upped the butter to 1/2 cup, use 1 cup of celery and onion, 1 half cup carrots, 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper, 1 tsp nature's seasoning, and leave everything else how the recipe calls, sometimes I'll add corn if there's any left. Kid's love it and it is a great way to reduce leftovers, thanks for the recipe.

very good.  I did make a few changes though. Added a little salt, some garlic salt and a sprinkle of Seasoning Salt to spice it up just a wee little bit.  will definitely make it again.

I would definitely make this again.  I made the slightest of alterations.  I used fresh parsley. Also, I did not add the chicken until the very end and heated through in the soup for about 3 minutes.  Lastly, I used good quality powdered bouillon.  I think this soup could be elevated by a homemade or high quality store bought broth, but my husband thought it was great just the way it was.  I served with French Bread from this site.  Which I also gave 5 stars.

There are not enough stars for this recipe. I'm a huge chicken soup fan and this is by far the best I have tasted. I make this at least every other week now because my family loves it so much. A truly unforgettable taste.

Great recipe. Used low sodium chicken broth and water for a better sodium balance. Added a touch of  sage and extra carrots and fresh mushrooms. It's a keeper!

The soup was very good but if I made it again I would probably only use 7 or 8 bouillon cubes, it was very salty with 9.

Loved this soup!!!! I was looking for a chicken noodle soup recipe to use up leftover high fibre spaghetti noodles. I used the same amount of carrots, onions and celery (about 3/4 cup of each) I added 2 teaspoons of jarred minced garlic and I only had two frozen chicken breasts, but I would use 4 next times.
I only used 8 cups of water and 4 bouillon cubes as my kiddies were sleeping and i had no boxed broth. I simmered it for 20 mins and added the pre-cooked  cut up spaghettini noddles for another 10 mins. AH-MA-ZING!!!! My 3 year gobbled it up and asked for seconds.

This soup cures my hunny's cold every time! I use 12 cups of chicken broth instead of water mixed with chicken bouillon. I also substitute oregano for marjoram because it's what I have on hand.

Just right.  Everyone loved it.  Used uncooked chicken and added it right after sauteing the onions and celery.  Stirred it a few times and then added the rest of the ingredients.  Instead of bullion, I used 1 carton of chicken stock and 8 cups of water (with chicken soup base added).  Also added a couple pinches of lemon thyme.

This soup was great. Gave it four stars because I felt like the veggie quantities were a bit small for so much soup - I halved the liquid and chicken, kept the 1 cup celery, used a whole onion, and chopped 3 carrots, which was perfect (for me - I love veggies in soup). Also smashed and tossed in a couple cloves of garlic. Didn't have marjoram but tossed in a bit of oregano I had in the fridge. 

One note, I also used homemade stock since I had it on hand, but I generally think any kind of stock is better than bullion - maybe just personal preference.

Overall, more veggies and non-bullion stock made this a wonderful soup.

Did not have any chicken breasts so I used boneless thighs which was all I had.  Wow! What great flavor.  Also did not have majoram so substituted small amount of thyme.

I added more seasonings that are suited to my family's taste! I added a drop of Gravymaster to give it a more savory appearance, a can of whole kernel corn, Goya Adobo and some  onion and garlic powder along with some oregano since i did not have marjoram. I also used spaghetti noodles. It came out great and my family loves it!

My husband and mom loved it, but my daughter found the flavor lacking. Needed more salt. That's primarily because, for health reasons, I use No-Salt added broth and bouillon. The recipe however was hearty and easy. Perfect on a cold, winter night. The only real change I made was using broth instead of water and bouillon in a 2:1 ratio.

Amazing! This recipe is so good and doesn't take very long to make at all! I always use the rotisserie chickens you can buy at the store, just remember if you do that, don't add any salt or bouillon!

My grandparents love this recipe, I change a few things to meat with dietary needs like low salt stock. However I beef up flavor by roasting chicken thighs the night before in fresh minced garlic, toasted sesame oil, salt and pepper. Chop them up and use them in the soup. You can also make this in the crockpot so I can start it in the am before work and their house and my grandparents can have a good dinner later.

Great recipe, but it needs a few minor tweaks. I found it extremely salty, so in the future I will reduce the number of bouillon cubes to 6 and use low-sodium ones. More can always be added to taste as you can make it. I also added 1 1/2 cups of celery and 1 1/2 cups of carrots and will do so going forward.

I made this for dinner and it came out great! All of my boys and husband loved it. I did not have was the basil leaf so I added dried oregano, more carrots and onions and 1 yellow squash. Other than that, this is a great dish to whip up with saltines on the side

This recipe is good.  I made a few changes.  I used one part chicken stock to two parts broth and no boullion.  I took 4 chicken breasts, rubbed them with 1 TBLS sumac,  1tsp herbes de provence and olive oil.  Baked at 350 to 155 degrees, poured the broth into the crockpot, cubed the breasts, sauted the onions , celery and garlic in butter and olive oil and threw that in the crockpot.  I added half a tsp each of onion powder and garlic powder, threw in sliced raw carrots and cooked on low in the crockpot for 9 hours.  I added homemade noodles and a bag of frozen peas, simmered another 15 minutes and served with fresh baked baugettes.  This is my new chicken soup recipe.

This recipe was pretty good. I sauted garlic with the celery and onions. I used chicken broth instead of water and didn't add bouillon cubes. I cooked the noodles in a separate pot and added to the soup. Since I used a 12 oz bag of whole wheat egg noodles I added 2 cups more water. The celery wasn't as done as I would have liked so I cooked it on low another hour - yum! My hubby said that he prefers it to be creamier so maybe I will try adding cornstarch . He also said the soup smelled like the base for chicken dumplings so I might try adding those next time instead! This has been saved to my recipebox!

The first time I made this I used cans of chicken broth and had a note saying it was good and easy.  I just made it again using broth that I made from chicken that I roasted the other night and it wasn't as flavorful. I needed to add salt and other seasoning. I will keep trying

I’ve made this soooo many times, for my family just as a meal or for friends who have colds or flu, it’s a winner every time! I make it easy and use a whole cut up rotisserie chicken, and for extra antibiotic kick I add a 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  I prefer the Meullers extra wide home style noodles but I can only ever find them at Kroger and I don’t have one near me. Otherwise it’s Pennsylvania Dutch extra wide egg noodles. This is the absolute best and most requested soup ever!!

This soup is hands down my favorite recipe. I make this and bring it in for lunch every day at work, the original serving size lasts me about a week. once you have the spices for this, the meal becomes even cheaper to make! as a broke college student, that's exactly what I need!! the only thing different I did with this recipe was instead of using 9 bouillon cubes, I used the pack of 6 extra large cubes, I like my food salty. definitely a recipe that will stick around in my family.

This was delicious! It was lacking a little flavor. My wife ,the Queen of soup making, suggested to boil chicken in water and use it as stock adding powdered broth. I did use a cup each of veggies and will add even more carrots next time.  Also put a pinch of powdered cayenne.

Tasted great. I try to always keep veggies handy and cooked chicken in the freezer. I cut the recipe down so I only used two bouillon cubes, 3 cups water, and 2 cups chicken stock I had in the freezer (from when I cooked the chicken). I also substituted thyme for the marjoram, only because I was out.

I added Celery Salt, Sea Salt, used Medium Shell noodles instead of Egg Noodles & substituted Chicken Broth for half of the water and the soup came out perfect!! My daughter was sick today so I decided to make homemade soup for the first time and it was a success!! Thanks Allrecipes!

This was my first time making chicken noodle soup and it turned out great!  I added in garlic and cubed up some chicken breasts and threw it right in the pot (didn't cook it first).  I didn't have egg noodles so I substituted some mini spaghetti.  Finicky young son asked for 2 helpings!!

This recipe is really good!! Will be keeping this for many more times of needed Chicken noodle soup. I did modify the recipe slightly. I added two more cups of water due to it tasting a little bit salty for my liking.I added the water from the chicken that I boiled prior to adding to the soup for more flavor. I also added more egg noddles, probably double and more parsley. Enjoy.

Super yum!!! I boiled my chicken then used the chicken broth. I needed to add a few seasonings: Nature's Seasons, Garlic Salt, bouillon, black pepper, Italian Season, & Cayenne Pepper to pick it up though. I also doubled the celery, onions, & carrots. Wow, yum!! Even my picky children enjoyed it!!

Awesome soup. It disappeared quickly after it was done. Only thing I changed was adding a 1/2 cup of chopped carrots instead of a 1/4 cup.

Easy and yummy!!  I had boneless chicken breast  so that's what I used,  just cubed them up, and after sauteing celery and onion,just threw them in raw!  With everything else, it turned out great, used knorr chicken bulion cubes, and the flavor is great!!

Great recipe and very easy to make.  The only thing I added was a teaspoon of salt and I don't use or like parsley much so I used a 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic instead.

REALLY GOOD AND NOT A LOT OF WORK!!!  I made a batch last week when me my husband and son were all sick at once.  It was so good they wanted me to make it again!

 This week, I used chicken reduced sodium chicken broth in place of the bullion. Last week I used Better Than Bullion.  I couldn't tell the  difference between the two batches.  This was was a big hit!

LOVED it! I ended up adding 1/2 cup carrots and 1/2 cup onions as the veggies seemed on the light side to me. I used Wyler's granules instead of bouillon cubes and increased it a bit to equal 11 cubes for more flavor. It turned out awesome, will definitely make again.

I used the Boiled Chicken recipe by George as suggested by several others, the night before. I had a 3 to 4 pound chicken and got just the right amount for the recipe. I also used Reams frozen egg noodles as suggested. I put everything except the noodles in a 4 qt slow cooker and realized I needed a larger one. So, I transferred everything to my 6 qt slow cooker and cooked on low for about 6 hrs. then added the noodles and cooked for another hour. The soup needed salt, but other than that, it was wonderful. Reheated it the next day by cooking it another 3 to 4 hrs on low in the slow cooker and it was even better. The only thing I will change next time is to add several carrots cut in chunks. They really added something to the soup.

This was excellent! I used some chicken meat that was left over from a supermarket roasting chicken and a can of Tyson chicken meat. I seasoned it as the recipe said. I cut down the butter because thr chicken had a lot of flavoring injected into it. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I used a rotisserie chicken, first boiling it for awhile and then tearing the meat by hand.  That made for some tasty broth and delicious chunky chicken in the soup, which was delish.  I also had some okra to use up, so I threw that in, too, and it was awesome.  I made this for myself when I was sick, and I was not disappointed!

I make this frequently. The only difference is that I use 12 cups of chicken broth instead of of water with bullion. And I usually combine low sodium broth and regular broth so that it’s not too salty.

I made this tonight for a weeknight meal it was good
I had to change it a little I didn't sauté the onions
I put all of the veggies in a crockpot with the seasons
and the chicken broth I didn't add the chicken right away
I used chicken nuggets and deep fried them and added at the
end of the cooking time I cooked my own noodles in saucepan
I don't like soggy noodles but thank you for the recpie

Making Chicken Noodle soup always seemed like a chore to me.   Not this recipe,  and how wonderful the taste was also.  I will make this again.  Actually, I made this for my mother who had been ill and she loved it.  I did increase the carrots to 1/2 of a cup.

My husband is obsessed with chicken soup and often makes his own which entails hours of cooking.  I love this soup because it doesn't take forever to make and it helps with his craving.

I have made chicken noodle soup before but was looking for another recipe so tried this.  I followed another reviewers advice and added a whole rotissori chicken and simmered it for 30 min, then removed and added pieces of chicken.  I didn't like the oily taste the butter gave to this so I mixed 1/4c water with 1/3c cornstarch and slowly added it to the broth stirring constantly.  It reduced the oily taste a bit and gave the soup a nice consistency that reminded me of Chick-fil-A chicken noodle soup.  My kids liked it and it does have a good flavor but I think next time I make it I will leave out the butter and see how it turns out.

My original intent was just to make chicken stock and use the chicken for… something. I already had chicken, celery, carrots, and onions simmering in the pot. At some point, I looked up this recipe. I hadn’t sautéed the onions and celery like the recipe says too, I had just tossed them in. Because of that, there wasn’t a need for butter. For seasoning, I added fresh ground peppercorns (peppercorn medley by McCormick), ground sea salt, dried parsley, chicken granules (same thing as bouillon cubes but not in cubes), and this seasoning by McCormick called Pinch Perfect – Basil and Garlic. (Ingredient list for that says Garlic, Salt, Basil, and Tomato.) I did not add marjoram or a bay leaf. I used 12oz bag of noodles.  I also mixed a little flour (about 2 teaspoons) in cool water and then stirred it to thicken it up a little. I chose to limit the amount of water so that there would be less broth and my little kids wouldn’t make a mess. This recipe was helpful and the directions worked really well. The kids loved it, my husband loved it, and I’m kind of a little sad there aren’t any leftovers.

Used bouillon granules instead of cubes and a 2lb rotisserie chicken.  Next time would add peas for a little more vegetable in the soup

My son loves this recipe. He asks for it every week in the winter.  I did add more carrots and celery than it called for though and didn't cook the chicken prior.  If both my boys will eat it, I am a happy mother!!

It was delicious.  My husband loved it too.  I did substitute chicken stock for the water and chicken bouillon cubes.  I also let it simmer for about an hour and a half total.  This is my new "go to" soup recipe!

This is the very first time I've made soup of any kind since I've always thought it was a lot of work. This simple recipe proved me wrong and made me regret that I hadn't started making homemade soup years ago. This soup is delicious and very easy to make. I made it with one less bouillon cube than the recipe called for since some of the reviews stated that it was too salty. Both I and my husband loved it.

My "go to" soup anytime someone starts sniffling and sneezing.  We have had 3 rounds of colds in this house this winter and I have made it for sick friends, so I have used this recipe many times.   Here are some suggestions below.
Do:
Double the carrots if you like them in soup.
Use 6 Knorr extra large bouillon, it makes a difference

Dont:
Do not add extra noodles.  I did because I thought it looked like there was going to be too much broth.  Everyone loves the broth and my leftovers were dry.  The 8 ounces is perfect.

This recipe is easy and delish and I swear by its ability to kick a cold to the curb!

My family love this soup, best chicken soup ever. I bother to fry the onions and celery, so I can leave out the butter. I just throw everything else into my hotpot and leave it for 4 hours on high, then add the noodles 30 minutes before serving.

outstanding and super easy to make.  I started with raw chicken, so I boiled the chicken in chicken broth first.  I strained the broth afterwards through cheesecloth and then used it for this recipe.  This recipe was delicious.  It will be a staple in this house.

This was GREAT.  I made it for my son, who has the flu, but I made one mistake in making it- I added 16 oz of egg noodles.  It was less of a soup and more of a pasta meal - still delicious~!

Good, but too salty. Maybe use homemade chicken broth or the low sodium kind instead of bullion cubes.

This turned out wonderfully!  I used half broth/half bouillon, but next time it will be all bouillon.  It makes a generous amount, and the leftovers were well appreciated for great comfort-food quick meals.  This recipe easily tweaks:  I added extra chicken and celery for personal preference.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

My husband said this was the best soup he's ever eaten (and when he woke up in the middle of the night he helped himself to another bowl).  I put a half-eaten rotisserie chicken in a slow cooker with the water and boullion for about 4 hours, then strained the broth and separated out the good meat (NOTE: necessary! there were lots of bones and weird bits to take out).  Sauteed the vegetables (used a full onion) and added the rest of the ingredients.  Used frozen noodles, which were well worth spending the extra two bucks on.  My search for the perfect chicken noodle soup recipe ends here!

I did change it up a bit for starters:
1.  I used Reames (Spelling?  I threw the package out) homemade noodles . because they are so much better than egg noodles and I added those later.
2.  I also used a frozen cut up chicken from a whole chicken I'd cooked previously (Just defrosted and added) because they'd been on sale and I had wanted to do homemade chicken noodle soup
3.  I had chicken broth instead of bouillon cube so I used that plus some water so I didn't have to run to the store.
4.  I cooked it longer also because not all the chicken was completely defrosted, so it needed to simmer longer

It turned out great and I will be making this again to freeze for winter so all I have to do is pull out and heat up, but it was great!  Perfect.

I used three cartons of Pacific Chicken Broth (12 cups), I added 2 large, fresh japelano peppers to the vegetable sautee, I used 1.5 onion, I sliced up up one head of cabbage to replace 2 oz worth of egg noodle, and added salt to taste. I actally put in raw chicken for the 30 minute simmer portion. This removes an extra step. It became an extremly hearty soup. It had less sodium, less noodles, and a subtle kick from the japelano. Wonderful dish.

Delicious!  I used meat from roasted chicken.  Chopped up extra carrots, celery, onion and added garlic.  Sauteed with fresh parsley, thyme and bay leaf.  I also used low sodium "Better than Bullion" instead of plain water and bullion cubes.  Simmered for 30 mins, added chicken and brought to a boil once more so I could drop in dumplings instead of noodles.  Fantastic!  Will make again.

Read all reviews...  Used the crock pot, used the swansons chicken broth, and cooked the chicken in the broth.   Had it 4 hrs on high, then low.  Took whole chicken out, put in fridge to cool, then picked the chicken off and put back in soup.  Noodles last 10 min.  Really good and simple overall.

I'm not a huge soup person, but I can definitely crave it from time to time. 
I made a batch and LOVED it! It made alot so I froze most of it. I pulled it out this long weekend when we had our foster kids and they could not get enough.
The only liquid I added was chicken broth and so I didn't add the cubes. My husband hates veggies but even he said it was fantastic. I'm off to make another batch for my freezer.

Fantastic!  It was sooo simple to make...I followed just like it said...except next time I won't make my chicken in such small pieces b/c it almost looked minced...I added extra carrots & celery & it was great...I also used Hakka noodles & it turned out great too...I didn't have any marjoram.  So i googled & found out i could substitute parsley or basil instead, but I didn't have that either so I skipped it all together & my soup was still so yummy!  I can't wait to make this again!

It's not quite as good as a recipe that uses homemade chicken stock, but it's a lot easier and it tastes better than canned soup! I increased the vegetables (particularly the carrots) but otherwise made the recipe as written. I did think it would be nice if the recipe specified what heat setting(s) to use on the stove, for newbies like me who don't automatically know these things.

I liked it and very basic and easy. what i did was the night before I made a whole chicken in the slow cooker for dinner and used the left over chicken for this recipe here. I saved the stock as well and added it to the recipe and used less cubes, only two. I didn't add any celery just cause I hate celery. Very easy recipe. I sauted the onions and carrots. Lots of left overs to freeze or for next days lunch/dinner. Will make again. I don't think I can screw this recipe up.

Use 2 boxes broth and two chicken stock.  Use 2 bags Reames frozen noodles.  Also add way more veggies than what calls for and corn too.

Followed recipe exactly. Next time will use broth in place of bouillon/water and add more carrots. Also maybe try in the crockpot or try cooking the chicken in the soup and then shredding later.

My husband made this soup for me when I was very sick with a cold. I can honestly say that I raved the entire time I ate it that it was "the best soup I've ever had." I think the bullion cubes probably make this soup less healthy and more delicious -- but we will definitely make it again when we need some hot comfort food!

I thought this recipe was delicious!. I used a crock pot. I also doubled the vegetables and used my broth from the chicken which I preboiled. I then only used 5 bouillion cubes. I used thick Amish noodles as well and put them in about 1/2 hour before done. Will make again.

This is such a good basic recipe.  I did as many did and used Swanson broth and some broth I had frozen also the chicken I had cooked and frozen. I did 12 cups with both those. Plus I added 2 cups of water.  I think next time I will add more broth or water.  It's a little thick.  I added extra carrots, celery, and onions as others suggested.  And some garlic.  That all worked out well.  I added the poultry seasoning because I didn't have Marjoram and it has that in it.  I didn't care for it but my hubby who doesn't like my chicken noodle soup usually liked it. Go figure!  I also added an uncooked chicken breast and boiled with the broth and seasonings for 30 minutes that worked great.  I just than cut it up and put it back in.  I think with a little playing around with the herbs to suit your taste this is really good.

Delicious!  I used homemade chicken stock, sauteed the onions and carrots, then followed the recipe, except I also added some frozen peas when I added the noodles.  Needed a little extra salt and pepper, but this was a very tasty soup.

The whole family loved it!!  I cut the butter down to 2 tbs. and doubled or even tripled all the veggies, and had some fresh Italian parsley on hand.   I used one box of Swansons, and the rest chicken base and water.  I didn't have marjoram, but it still had a nice flavor.

Love this recipe! It's so quick & simple. I altered the recipe a bit...used 12 cups of water, but only 3 bullion cubes and I doubled up on the onion, carrots and celery, however I didn't measure anything, I just eyeballed it until it looked like enough. Turned out wonderful!

I followed BUISSE's info on the broth and rotisserie chick simmer for 30min, removed bones, used thyme instead of marjoram (didnt have it on hand), omitted the butter (cutting down on fat), added 1/2 bag of frozen white corn, and also used fettucini style pad thai rice noodles since I need gluten-free. Love, loved it! It was yummy and one of the best chicken soups I made so far... Thanks for the comments and helps!

I have made this twice now, once exactly as the recipe called for and it was good but a tad salty. Today I made it again using Swanson chicken broth as well as 1 packet of Swanson flavor boost. It tasted so yummy my husband asked when we could have it again! This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe came out great, however I made changes, I used two boxes of chicken broth and one can of vegetable broth, I didnt use the bouillon cubes or the bay leaf we dont like bay leaf, I added two cups of water as well. I also added red pepper, chili powder, 7 cloves whole garlic, a lot more carrots and celery, an entire red onion, pollo seasoning a lot more black pepper and thats about it. I like more flavor in the soup so thats why I added those other ingredents, but its a GREAT recipe to start wit. I also did not use cooked chicken, I used 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and cooked it in the soup. I brought it all to a boil, and then simmered for about 4.5 hours. Very good! Thank You!

I halved this recipe because it seemed like alot but when my family devoured it all in one sitting I wished I had made the whole batch. I did cook the chicken in the soup (I didn't have the time to do it first and for chicken soup you don't need to). This has quickly become a family favorite.

This is what chicken noodle soup should taste like to me! So good! I've made this six times since discovering the recipe and can see making this for years to come. One thing I do differently is to boil four chicken thighs in 14 cups of water for 50 minutes, and use that as stock instead of just water. It adds a lot to the flavor! Also, I use 6 extra large bouillon cubes because that's all the stores here seem to sell. But it seems to do the trick and maybe is equivalent to 9 normal sized cubes. One problem I always run into is that the noodles absorb quite a lot of the water content, and leftovers always need additional water added. This next time I think I will put a cup of chicken broth in at the same time as the noodles and see if that makes a difference. I do like a lot of celery in my CNS so I doubled that.

Very tasty soup. I followed the recipe for the most part just added less bouillon cubes about 7 of them and tossed in some potato and Zucchini. I like my soup hearty so the extra veggies was the perfect fix.

Easy recipe and very tasty. I smoked a chicken and used the leftovers for this recipe. This was the best soup I've had in a while. The smoke flavor was perfect.

Used oregano instead of marjoram because i didnt have any but this soup is DELICIOUS! Maybe i cooked it on a too high setting because  a lot of the liquid evaporated but at the end i just added 4 cups of water and its perfect.

I have never made soup before, and I wanted to make some for the guy I am seeing who is sick today. After reading the reviews on this I thought it sounded like a good choice for my first try. I boiled the chicken (recipe found on this site) and sauted the veggies. I don't think I used any measurements for anything other then the herbs though. I used reduced sodium and regular broth plus the liquid from the boiled chicken instead of any water or bouillon. I also used an entire bag off no yolk egg noodles and a ton of the veggies and chicken. I tested the recipe on my 4 kids who are the pickiest eaters ever and THEY LOVED IT!!! They are the one's who gave this a 5 star rating. I did let the soup simmer for about 2 hours though. Great recipe!

The best chicken noodle soup I've ever had, hands down! We made it as specified but used 2 cups of canned chicken since we ran out of chicken breast. Outstanding soup! It's a winner in our household.

This was wonderful!  We doubled the vegetables and used a little less water (that was due to lack of space).  A great easy meal that will last a long time if you're just cooking for two.

Super easy and yummy! Think of all the preservatives you leave out when making this homemade! The only thing I did was sauteed the carrots with the onion and celery b/c otherwise they are too crunchy for me. And, I didn't have marjoram, so I substituted oregano. I've made it with both types of noodles, but prefer the frozen egg noodles in this which takes a little longer, but, overall, wonderful!

I absolutely loved this recipe! It was perfect with the cold i have. I didn't have the egg noodles so i just broke up some spaghetti pasta. I sauteed the pasta for a few minutes with a little oil to keep them from getting too soggy later. Also when i cooked my chicken i kept the broth and added less bouillon cubes.

Very yummy! omitted the dry parsley because I did not have it, but added fresh green onion. Added 12 oz egg noodles because it was a whole package and that was too much! Not much broth was left the next day.

Very easy to make. My only qualm with the recipe as written is that it comes out very, very salty if you use chicken boullion cubes. I cut the chicken boullion amount in half and added some chicken broth instead and it was still quite salty. I think next time I make this (which I will because it's oh-so-good and easy) I will use low-sodium chicken broth in leui of the cubes and taste it at the end and add a little sprinkle of salt if necessary. Otherwise, it was great. I let my soup simmer for about an hour before I dumped in the egg noodles. Very tasty and healthy (sans the salt). Thank you for this recipe!

Easy and delicious soup recipe.  Though I used one half cup of carrots, one half teaspoon of crushed bay leaves instead of whole and one half tablespoon of dried chives to replace the parsley.  It makes a lot and it's very filling.  The entire family loved it - had to email my brother the recipe. :D

my husband and I loved this soup, we used a rotisserie chicken and 2 cups of celery, 1 cup of carrots, and 3/4 cup of onions and double the spices. I also only used swansons chicken broth instead of water and I added 1 t. of minced garlic with the celery and onions, and 1/2 cup of butter. We had it with fresh french bread out of the bread maker and a spinach and egg salad with poppy seed dressing and it was amazing. I'm so glad we made so much its going to make great leftovers for today's rainy day.

Yummy and fast! I used extra carrots, celery and onion and I didn't have marjoram or bay, so I just used some poultry seasoning and it turned out awesome :) Will definitely make again!

Fives stars for flavor and also the ease of making this recipe on a week night. I always believed soup had to cook for hours because that's what my mom did. Not with this recipe! I made exactly as written and it was so good! I won't even try another recipe now - this is it for me. Delicious!!!

A good base. i added a cup of carrots and next time i would wait and serve the noodles by the bowl, they ended up too mushy for leftovers. It needs just a bit more spice for our taste to, so next time i will up the marjoram and pepper a bit.

This recipe was very good.  Only change I made is that I used 10 bouilon cubes, and used maybe a dash of salt....It had very good flavor...I will make again!

Love this recipe.  This was my first time making homemade soup and it was very easy.  I followed the recipe as is.  However, next time, I will add more carrots and I like the idea someone mentioned about adding frozen peas.  Overall, very good recipe and my family loved it.

I have been using this same recipe for a couple years now, and I finally decided to rate it. It is THE BEST chicken noodle soup- even my boyfriend (who is not a huge soup fan) LOVES this! I follow this recipe ingredient by ingredient...the only modification I've done is add mushrooms on occasion. It's so easy. The marjoram gives it such a "grandmaish" flavor-- which is what we all want from our chicken noodle soup!!!

I thought this soup was really good. I sauteed the onions celery and carrots and raw chicken cut up in small pieces together, then added chicken broth and water w bouillon etc, didn't have any egg noodles so i tossed in fettuccine noodles. They worked great.  tasted great!

I cooked chicken breast in the crock pot in chicken broth for several hours and used that meat in the soup.  Next time I will add more carrots, other than that I thought it was prefect!  All my kids loved it (ages 1, 3, 5, & 7).  Super soup - thanks for a great recipe!

I use four large chicken breasts, boiled in low sodium chicken broth with onions and celery, and a good hand full of chopped parsley. Take the chicken out with a slotted spoon and let cool. when cool, take off the skin and put back the meat. Then I put about 2 pounds of sliced carrots. Bring to a boil again with the meat, and boullion cubes, as needed if you want.

Pretty good.  Quite thick and hearty soup.  Only complaint is that it needs more flavor. I added more bouillon powder, seasoning salt and a touch of poulty seasoning.

I saved the water I blanched the chicken in.  Then reduced the amount of bouillon cubes to 9.  Very Yummy!

Fantastic!!! My husband really raved about it. He had it for lunch the next day. He never eats leftovers the next day. DITTO! For me. Instead of marjoram I used thyme, extra of the veggies, vermecille and a little cornstarch to thicken with. My husband has already asked to fix it again next week. Thanks

I made enough of this yummy soup for 30 elementary children, and they loved it! One of the teachers said it was the best chicken noodle soup she has ever tasted! (it was easy to make too)

This is the easist chicken soup to make and so quick! I make it all the time and have given the recipe out to several people. Herb Ox Bouillon cubes are the best brand I've found, try them, they are a little more pricey but you can tell the difference in the flavor!

Yummy.  I was very easy to make and it tasted
very home made.  I will definitely make it again.
