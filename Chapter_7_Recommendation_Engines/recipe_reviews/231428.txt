The muffins are quite delicious! I doubled the recipe based on the reviews of others and ended up with 16 small muffins. I added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and thought it was a nice addition. I did, though, feel as though the muffins were a little sweet. In the future (on a double recipe) I will try cutting the sugar back by 1/4 cup. All in all, a great recipe that my whole family enjoyed!!

Super easy and quick to mix up these babies. These are tasty, moist, and forgiving if you don't always bother to measure like me.  This recipe made 6 muffins which was perfect to slide in the toaster oven. I made these twice once substituting apple sauce for most of the oil and leaving out the sugar and once with less sugar.  Both were delicious.

AWESOME!  This recipe only made 6 muffins for me, not 12, but the taste is fabulous.  The BEST thing is that this recipe can be easily adapted for diabetics by using whole wheat flour and Stevia (2 tbl. plus 2 tsp. Stevia in place of 1/2 cup sugar) and it still tastes great!  Thank you for an excellent recipe!!! :)))

This was a very moist muffin with a nice crunchy top from the sugar in the batter.  I added about 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the batter. Just for personal taste - I would prefer using cinnamon over the nutmeg in the recipe next time.  I also was able to make 8 nice size muffins like a previous reviewer.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely fabulous!! These are a huge hit in my family. 
Since these are going to be used for school snacks, I made one healthy adaption and that was to substitute whole wheat flour for the 3/4 cup all-purpose flour. 
I also tossed in grated carrot, for a little more color and nutrition. My little one didn't even notice! So, he's getting a delicious, healthy snack made from scratch; I froze the whole batch and take out two at time to send with my child to school. 
Last note: I quadrupled the recipe, so indeed, I used a total of 3 cups of whole wheat flour, no problems. (I've heard one part whole wheat to three parts all-purpose...?) And, like I said, I tossed in about one cup of shredded carrots. Also, I added two more eggs, for a total of 6 eggs for the 4x recipe.
All in all, THIS recipe is THE recipe I will be using for zucchini muffins. Simply delicious :) Thank you for sharing.

This was very good! I did modify it for my family. I used gluten free flour and a little less sugar. I doubled the recipe and it made 12 beautiful fluffy moist muffins. Thanks for the recipe! Will make it again!!

these came out very tasty.. as always i used what i had on hand and followed some of the other reviewers suggestions.. i subbed mexican squash for the zucchini and dried cherries for the raisins.. i used more like 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and added a little more than 1/4 tsp of cinnamon as suggested by EricaLovesToCook.. also used her suggestion of cutting back the sugar, using three T's of regular sugar and three T's of brown.. i also added some vanilla extract like happyschmoopies.. my batch made 7 good sized muffins.. i'm sure bf will love taking some with him for breakfast/snack tomorrow.. ty for the recipe

I substituted applesauce for the oil and they were yummy. Lesson learned however - don't use paper muffin liners. They were totally glued to the paper.

Wonderful, easy treat.  Used brown instead of white sugar and applesauce instead of oil.  Moist and delicious. Even my picky 2 yr old LOVED them. Made 12 small (but not mini) muffins. Thanks for recipe. Will be making these often.

So glad I tried this. They are delicious. I followed the recipe & they turned out perfect. On the next batch, I'm going to add some chopped pecans, because I have a lot of them, & cinnamon, because I like it. I will lower the sugar a bit since I use golden raisins & they are sweeter than dark ones. Yes, the recipe yielded 8 medium muffins, because that's the size of my tin. I'm guessing that this recipe yield is for a mini-muffin pan, but all said it's still a great recipe. Has anyone tried freezing them? I'm overwhelmed with zucchini. Thanks Mastrud!

I made it and it made 7 muffins, I think the flour measurement is wrong maybe it should be 1 3/4 Cups.

They aren't very sweet in case that's something you're into. I definitely am, so I added a cinnamon glaze on top and it tastes sooo good. I also double the recipie so I used half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown. These muffins are so flippin moist It's a great recipe!

I made these muffins with only one small change - I substituted dried cherries for the raisins.  These were moist and delicious and I will definitely prepare these again.  My only issue with the recipe as published is that there is no way to get 12 muffins from the amounts listed unless you are making mini muffins.  I doubled the recipe and got 12 full sized muffins.

I made the following changes and muffins/bread came out great! Slightly crispy on the outside and moist inside. 1) I doubled the recipe and had enough to make a loaf and 6 muffins. 2) I cut the sugar amount to about 3/4 cup. When I started mixing in the zucchini, I worries that the sugar reduction was making my batter too runny, so I threw in about a Tbsp of brown sugar. The batter was still quite runny in the end, but the bread turned out well. 3) I put in about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Next time, I would put even less nutmeg and maybe add cloves because we like spicy bread. 4) I used dried blueberries and cherries instead of raisins. Great, versatile recipe that can easily be adapted to many tastes and ingredients!

I doubled the recipe after reading the other reviews. I also didn't use any raisins since I didn't have any or use any nuts since I have a nut allergy.  This was enough for 12 full muffins; I filled the muffin liners about 3/4 full. They baked beautifully in about 27 minutes. I found them to be bland but I really liked the recipe itself. It's quick and easy without needing to use half the pantry to make! Next time I would add some vanilla and some spices such as cinnamon to help give it more flavor.

I doubled the recipe and got 18 medium/average sized muffins. I needed to bake them about 3-5 minutes additional to have a toothpick come out clean. Straight out of the oven I thought they tasted a bit eggy, but the next day they were fantastic. I stored them in a covered container in the fridge, and popped them in the microwave for 20 seconds to reheat. I used raisens, but would also be good with nuts.

This is a pretty good starting point.  
I doubled everything but the sugar and I was out of raisins so I used chopped dates.  My only complaint is that the recipe's author seems to use the scoop from the container then level method of flour,  whereas the proper method is to scoop flour into your measuring cup then level off the flour.  My batter was very runny and my muffins turn out dense and oily.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I used gluten free flour blend and the muffins were a big hit. More recently I used regular all purpose flour and added mini chocolate chips. The second batch was no where near as good as the first. I suspect I used finely shredded zucchini for the first batch

My 3 year old was complaining about how he didn't like zucchini. I convinced him to try a bite of these muffins and he stopped complaining. These are super moist, maybe a bit on the sweet side, but really the spot for the whole family. I used whole spelt flour and dried cranberries but other than that followed the recipe.

Made these muffins exactly as directed and ended up w/ 4 decent sized muffins and 4 runts. The batter just couldn't be extended any further than that. 13MO went wild for these (no big shocker there), but her 8YO sister and myself weren't terribly impressed; perhaps cinnamon or honey would give these a flavor jolt.

These muffins are easy to put together and they taste great. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the other ingredients, which I followed as written. I got 6 jumbo muffins which promptly disappeared, so I immediately baked another batch. One reviewer mentioned the crunchy top as a result of the sugar which I loved as well. I will double the recipe next time, and there will definitely be a next time. The baking time was spot on at 25 minutes. My paper liners came away from the baked muffins just fine, maybe because I followed the recipe and used the oil.

Made them today with zucchini from the garden. Delish! Not filled wiith spices that cover up the taste of the zucchini. Will double the recipe next time.

Very yummy! I omitted the eggs and used ground flax. Doubled the recipe, cut the sugar in half, used applesauce in place of oil and used whole wheat flour. Very moist and kid approved!!

I made this recipe just as except I used egg beater in place of 1 lg. egg plus added 1/8 tsp. of cinnamon. My batch made 9 muffins not 12. Very moist & delicious! It will be a go too for muffins!
