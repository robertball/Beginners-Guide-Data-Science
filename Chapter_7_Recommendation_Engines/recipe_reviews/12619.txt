This is a great pie and only requires a few preparation “must dos” go guarantee it turns out perfect. I think the texture of the sugar (or lack there of) is critical. As other reviewers noted, the pie may have a “grainy” texture if regular sugar is used. You do not have to go out and purchase “extra fine” sugar if you have a food processor.  I put regular sugar in a food processor and let it go for 7-10 minutes and the result is perfect texture sugar. Check the sugar and process it longer if you detect any graininess at all. I agree that the butter and eggs should be at room temp before mixing. I disagree with some reviewers who cut down on the egg mixing time from the recommended 5 minutes per egg.  I believe the 5 minutes is an absolute minimum to obtain that smooth/fluffy texture. I would stretch it to 6 or 7 minutes if you have a hands free mixer. Also, NEVER make this without pasteurized eggs. Even though the chance of salmonella infection by using non-pasteurized eggs is slim, why take the chance?  You may not find pasteurized eggs in most “chain” groceries, but they can usually be found in specialty groceries. Finally, the first time I made this, I used a graham cracker pie crust. Sweet overkill?  Maybe, but you be the judge. Whipped cream is a must to cut the sweet taste a bit. Garnish with fresh mint leaf. UPDATE 12/23/10. I used extra fine sugar AND I put the sugar in a food processor for 2-3 minutes. Kitchen Aid free standing mixer for eggs @ 7 min. each. Perfect!

Undescribably delicious!!!  I could smell my motor burning on my hand mixer after the 2nd egg.  This pie definitely encourages me to buy a Kitchen Aid.  The first time I made this pie, I beat each egg for almost 5 minutes.  I have made this many more times since then and have decreased the time to about 3 minutes with the same results. I didn't have the chocolate baking squares so to equal 4 (1 oz) squares, I mixed 12 Tbls of cocoa powder with 4 Tbls of vegetable oil.  Perfect! I used regular sugar but could see where "superfine" would be better.  I don't mind the little grittines it had because the taste made up for it.  I've never made a creamier or richer chocolate pie and I highly recommend this for those who have a passion for chocolate.  Will definitley make this again.   Many thanks Joan.

Oh, man! Is this pie ever amazing!! I whipped up three of them for a party, and two of them were eaten before DINNER was served!! It is vital that each egg be beaten for at least five minutes... I actually beat mine for closer to 6 minutes because I have a KitchenAid mixer to do it for me. If you have one, use it. I also used Ultra Fine Sugar so that it would be that much creamier... this is a great recipe! Truly!

This is THE BEST chocolate silk pie I’ve ever made and the photo just does not do it justice.  The pie is very firm due to refrigeration, but the texture is as smooth as silk and it melts in your mouth like a rich chocolate truffle.  To avoid a granular texture, you have to devote a little extra time.  First, you need to let the butter come to room temperature (the eggs, too!).  Be sure to whip the butter and sugar really well and then let it set for 5 – 10 minutes.  This will give the sugar extra time to dissolve.  Then whip a second time before adding the vanilla and “warm” melted chocolate.  I used my KA and beat each egg as directed.  I used a standard pie plate and the filling went all the way to the top of the crust making for a thick, mouth watering piece of pie.

This recipe is similar to one I used to use from the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook -- but they stopped publishing it because of the raw egg content.  Of course, I lost the recipe I had!  It's a great recipe.  I use a graham cracker crust instead of the regular pie shell.  And, the more expensive, finer sugar IS better -- otherwise it can be a bit on the grainy side.  Thanks!  :)

So Delicious!  Beating after each egg is essential, it changes the texture completely.  A friend suggested that I use superfine sugar next time to make it even smoother.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars based on the feedback I received from others who ate it, because I personally am not a big chocolate lover.  I made it for a co-worker's birthday who is a chocoholic, and she thought it was delicious.  So did others in our office who love chocolate, and several of them asked for the recipe.  However, when the birthday girl read the recipe, she nearly freaked over the raw eggs.  I made the pie exactly the way the recipe called for except that I did use the extra fine sugar that other reviewers had recommended.  It was very easy to make and turned out perfect, so I could definitely recommend this recipe.

Awesome pie. Granulated sugar can be put in a food proccessor to make super fine sugar, longer the proccssed, the fine the sugar.

I have made this 3 times now and every time it has come out delicious. I would recommend bringing the eggs & butter to room temp first as I have never had a problem with sugar graininess and think that might have something to do with the room temp ingredients. The mixing time is a MUST DO also. I know it's time consuming but it's worth it when this comes out right because my family & friends rave about it. My only other suggestion would be to think about making 1.5 times the recipe because when I make a 9in. pie as is, it's not as thick as I would like - but that could be just me. I have a little bit left over when I do 1.5X but as another user suggested I put it in 2 individual cups for mousse and have a beautifully topped off pie.

This is the most awesome chocolate pie. Followed DIZ's ideas on the review and the pie turned out wonderful. Definately use your stand alone mixer, my Kitchenaid is my friend. Thank you so much for the recipe.

As a chocoholic, I found this too mildly flavored, hence the middling rating. If I were to make it again, I would increase the amount of chocolate and sugar by at least 25%. I used standard granulated sugar and beat 8 minutes after the addition of each egg; there was no hint of graininess - I see no need to buy a special sugar or to process the sugar if one follows the original instructions on beating time. I would also alter the ingredients to specify 50% unsalted butter. A bit of salt accentuates chocolate flavors, but there is too much in a full cup of salted butter. With a stronger chocolate and less salty flavor, I think I'd happily rate it a '5' . . . but not as the recipe is now.

Unbelievable. I made this once 3 months ago and my family has requested it for every party since. So rich. EDIT: I have been making this over 2 years now (20++ pies) and it has never once turned out badly. Given out recipe more than a dozen times. Sooo good.  Better than French Silk from Baker's Square.

I did change the recipe: 1 C sugar, 3/4 C butter (I just thought it looked like too much...) It turned out AWESOME. Everyone RAVED. My hubby wants me to make it for his "birthday cake". Beat 5 min after first two eggs, then add other two together, beat another 5 min-- it saves 5 minutes and comes out the same. Beware: the butter makes it get kind of hard in the fridge; set it out for about twenty minutes before serving or it will be thick and chalky. It tastes the same, but not creamy like it should be unless it's had time.

This pie was absolutely delicious!  I used regular sugar and brought my ingredients to room temperature as suggested by many.  I followed the directions exactly.  The filling was smooth and silky...the pie firms up nicely in fridge.  This will be one of my go-to desserts for guests, but they must love chocolate!

I completely messed this up but it still turned out delicious.  I pre-baked the pie crust but didn't bake it long enough, forgetting for the moment that the pie wasn't going to be baked.  I made the filling, put it in the fridge, and then remembered that the crust wasn't all the way baked.  Not wanting to waste the pie, I decided to bake it with the filling.  I baked it at 375 for about 20 minutes and then chilled it.  Turned out chocolately, creamy, and wonderful.

Wonderful!  Followed the recipe exactly, other than using superfine sugar, since I had it on hand.  My only thought was I might try the graham cracker crust next time ... this definitely needs to be kept refrigerated, and cold pie crust just isn't too appealing.  5 minutes per egg with my hand held mixer does get long, but it IS necessary!   Filling was nice and thick for a deep dish shell, and texture was perfectly smooth.  Great recipe!

This is the richest, sweetest chocolate pie! And SO easy to make. I used margarine instead of butter, because that's all I had on hand. It still turned out light and fluffy! Three of us ate half the pie for dessert!

This was my change.  I bought bittersweet instead of unsweetened.  I couldn't remember what type of chocolate the recipe called for.  Being that it was bittersweet chocolate I cut the sugar from 1.5 cups to just 1 cup.  I used regular organic sugar and did not *extra fine* it.  I beat each egg for 5 minutes.  It was not gritty at all.  My daughter calls this Chocolate Crack Pie.  I had  French Silk Pie from a cookbook I had years ago and it is still my favorite pie.

I wanted this to turn out right so badly, since this is my husband's favorite...I followed the directions precisely, (including the minimum of 5 minutes of beating for each egg), all my ingredients were fresh, sugar ground down finely in food processor, & butter and eggs at room temperature before beginning. I changed nothing from the original recipe. Even so, the batter was soupy going into the shell and was still soupy after refrigeration over night.  If anyone has any insight into what might have gone wrong, I would appreciate hearing it...Until then, my search for the perfect, fluffy chocolate pie goes on.

this pie is amazing!  I couldn't find fine sugar, so I did the food processor trick.  It was still grainy when I put it in the pie crust, but by the next day it was spectacular!  Used a Pillsbury pie crust and did the rest of the recipe exactly as instructed.  This is one of my favorite recipes from this website, thanks for sharing it!

Words cannot describe this pie. My husband has never looked at me the way he did tonight over eating that pie, and shockingly, he says it's the best thing he has put in his mouth so far. I did the recipe as is, used regular STORE BRAND granulated sugar, and there was absolutely NOTHING "grainy" about this pie - perhaps other reviewers aren't mixing long enough. Thank you, THANK YOU for such a wonderful recipe. It is a KEEPER.

My kids made this for me as my "Birthday cake".   It was rich, not too sweet, and apparently easy to make as my 14 and 9 yr olds had no problem tackling it.  Thank you!

I was excited to see this recipe!  My grandma made my dad what she called "English Toffee Pie" for his birthday every year while he was growing up.  I have only made it a few times and lost the recipe.  The changes I make is I use 1 3/4 powdered sugar, 3 oz unsweetened chocolate and put on a crust made from 1/3 cup melted butter, 1 1/2 cups crushed vanilla wafers, and a handful of chopped walnuts.  I press it into a 9" pie plate and hang on to a little bit to sprinkle on top.  Perfect with whipped cream on top!

This is a no-bake pie. It had a granular texture, even with beating egg for five minutes after each egg.

This pie is SO good.... I make this all the time... don't know why Raw eggs get such a bad rap... a raw egg is extremely nutritious, and I've been eating raw eggs for a long time now - as long as the eggs you use are fresh, you should have no problems. I always beat the eggs the full 5 minutes, but never use "fine grain" or food-processed sugar and have never had any grainy texture issues. Could be because the melted chocolate is still warm enough to help dissolve the sugar when I add it. Highly recommend this pie, its always a hit...

I doubled the amount of dark chocolate for the base mixture , and also made a mocha mouse topping with whipped cream, 2 squares of chocolate and instant chocolate coffee.  Can't fit into my jeans anymore but my guests were impressed and loved it!

Absolutely delicious! As other reviewers mentioned - you must beat 5 mins or more after EACH egg. Great texture, amazing chocolate taste! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and easy.  I was not able to find pasteurized eggs in my market, so pasteurized them myself (start with room temp eggs and cold water - slowly heat to 140 F and cook at that temp for 5 min. Then rinse in cold water to bring temp back down quickly.  The eggs are not cooked but any bacteria are killed)
No need to use extra fine sugar or process regular sugar as some mentioned.  I added an extra ounce of chocolate and didn't beat each egg quite as long.   About 2 to 3 minutes after the first 2 eggs, then about 5 minutes each for the remaining  2.  Poured it into a baked Oreo cookie crust and chilled about 7 hours.  
My husband( who is not known to hand out compliments) mentioned the pie the next morning, saying "that dessert last night was really good!"
I will definitely make this again.

This pie was WONDERFUL!  Made it for b'friend's dad's birthday.  It set beautifully, and only had a small amount of filling left after using a store-bought Oreo cookie crust.  Everyone loved it. In fact it was so incredibly rich that I haven't been able to touch the leftovers!  Good thing I have another chocolate pie-lover in the house who's more than grateful for what's left :)  Thanks for a terrific -- and EASY -- recipe!

This has to be the easiest pie ever.  I'd definitely recommend superfine sugar.  I think next time I might put just the smallest hint of a really concentrated instant coffee, but that might just put the recipe over the top as far as richness.  As it is, my husband (who would seriously eat an entire pie in one sitting if I'd let him) can barely finish a single piece.  A big piece, mind you, but still...

The only reason I am giving this four stars, is that a couple times I have made it, and instead of coming out light and fluffy, the filling comes to more a pudding consisitency. The taste is still sinfully rich, but not sure what I did wrong.

I have been looking for this recipe for many years, and I honestly think its even better than I remember. The lady who made this for me as a kid never wrote down her recipes (a true tragedy)and every chocolate pie I made never had that "exact" taste and texture. When this pie was served, I had so many compliments and requests for the recipe I was flabbergasted. I had high school boys asking for this recipe! A true chocolate experience.

This pie is so rich and delicious.  Everyone always raves about it.  A couple hints: eggs at room temperature, make sure you beat as directed.  Margarine at room temperature, for whatever reason butter didn't work well in this recipe for me.

This pie is so easy to make! The first time I made it, everyone went crazy for it and even non-pie-eaters had seconds. Now it's in huge demand for any special occasion, and even a professional chef has requested I make it for him. Be sure to use extra-fine sugar. I've found that if you let the butter and sugar beat for a long time, the pie is even smoother - less graininess from the sugar. Buy pasturized eggs and they should be fine. I can't recommend this pie highly enough!

I followed the directions exactly. Not to hard to make, but it was annoying and time consuming to beat the eggs for so long. The taste was good, but pretty sweet. The texture was like a chocolate whipped cream, very lite. Don’t think I’ll make it again. Oh yeah, I did like somebody else suggested and processed the sugar. Probably would have been grainy if I didn’t.

This turned out amazing!  Tasted like chocolate mousse, very rich.   I'm going to try it with Splenda next time to see if it can be done  low carb.  I used regular sugar and let it sit in the butter after creaming so that it would dissolve the sugar better and also beat each egg at least five minutes.

This is a fabulous pie!, It is however a very sweet pie as others have also commented. I had meant to cut the sugars by 1/3, but then didn’t, so you’d just use only a cup!
 I also wanted it quite chocolatey, so I painted a layer of spreadable chocolate ganache into the unbaked crust AFTER it was baked and briefly cooled.  I used a combination of milk & dark choc, doubling the amount of chocolate listed in the recipe.  My husband also requested it be Bavarian in flavor (thus having a bit of tang to it). I  then whipped in 1 c. of whipped honey-yogurt. This is made from whipping 1/2 c. whipping cream till peaks form, adding in 1 T. powdered sugar, splash of vanilla, and then further whipping in 1/2 c. honey yogurt. Defitely serve it in small portions (as it is extremely rich) and serving it with whipped cream is a must to cut the sweetness.  It satisfies the true chocolate lover!!!

This, easy to make, chocolate pie is amazing. It is wonderfully rich and is complimented perfectly with the whipped cream topping. This definitely goes into the "keeper file." Everyone complimented it and there wasn't a piece left at the end of the day.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY... I did not make a single revision, and it was incredible! So easy and fun to make. Perfect for making ahead of time, even a day or two. I noticed some reviews say they didn’t like the texture... I’m assuming they did not mix each egg for five minutes because after following the directions exactly it was so creamy and silky. This is definitely going in my recipe box and will probably make it on the Thanksgiving menu. Definitely make whipped cream to serve with it. 5 stars!

The only change I made to this recipe was to use superfine sugar.  It turned out beautifully, however my husband and I both found it to be too sweet.

This pie is terrible. It was like eating creamy buttercream frosting in a crust.  I followed others advice of making the sugar more fine and mixed each egg in for a minimum of 5 minutes.  This is not a pie. Complete waste of time.

Absolutely delicious!  I did use an Oreo cookie-based crust to give it a bit more of a chocolate flavor.  My husband just loved it!!!!!!  He said it was the best dessert he ever had.  He even said it was better than sex--so I hit him!

This pie is out of this world.  I didn't change a thing.  I was worried about the sugar making it crunchy so I creamed the sugar for a long time.  No problems what so ever.  I will be keeping this recipe.

This is one of my all time favorite go-to recipes, often demanded when I’m going to potlucks. It’s easy and non-bake. Tricks I got from reviews which make a big difference - the ultra-fine sugar to avoid grainy texture and using fresh eggs but getting them to room temperature before beating in. The ~30 minutes of mixing time is totally worth it!!

My husband and I made this on Thanksgiving and it was the hit of the party :). We have had several requests to make it again. I went out and bought the extra fine sugar, but then forgot to use it, but we did not find it grainy at all! I made a graham cracker crust and it was good, but my husband said it would have been even better with the flaky crust as the recipe suggested because the graham cracker made it a little too sweet, so that is the only change that I will be making next time! Scrumptious!!

Perfect!  I took others advice & put the sugar in the coffee grinder so it was superfine.  I also beat the PASTEURIZED eggs in one at a time for 7mins.
This pie is super dense & chocolaty.  also added 1/8 tsp. of salt.
I love this & will def. make again.

Fantastically delicious, but so very sweet. Definitely not for chocoholics (as advertised). I used extra chocolate but next time I will use unsweetened or bittersweet chocolate and less sugar. It was also great as a mousse. I made tarts and chilled the rest of the filling in shot glasses!

Oh my!!!  This is fantastic.  I made it for Thanksgiving and nobody wanted the pies.  I doubled the recipe to fit in a 13x9 pan.  Eggs and butter at room temperature and definately 5 minutes for each egg.  For crust I used crushed pecan shortbread cookies and butter, found in the Lush Pie recipe on this site.  Very rich and after the big meal, nobody could finish a 3" x 3" piece.  With the shortbread crust, this would work well in individual custard cups also.

This pie recipe couldn't be easier! I did make a few changes, but it's all a matter of taste. I used a spring form pan(like what is used for cheesecakes), and gave it a graham cracker crumb crust. Mixed 1 cup of crumbs with 1/4 cup of sugar and mixed in 1 stick of melted butter. Pack it down with your hands or a spatula. Cook at 350 for 15-20 minutes. Regular sugar dissolved is just fine in the warm melted butter for the pie recipe. The 5 minute rule on the eggs is a must! Hope this helps.

I could NOT get the sugar disolved, even after beating each egg for 5 mins each. I even warmed it up in the microwave for a min. and a half and beat it another 5 mins. I had to trash it. Even my kids wouldn't eat it!

THIS WAS A HIT!!!  VERY AWESOME DESSERT.  EVERYONE LOVED IT AT THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS.  BETTER THAN ANY FRENCH SILK PIE AT ANY RESTURANT.

I made this for a New Year's Eve dinner. I was under a time pressure and it was my first time making this recipe. Everything came out perfectly. The filling is almost like a mouse, very light, but full of flavor. Four of us ate the entire pie that evening. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe did not work for me, when I added the 3rd egg is collapsed.    I was timing each egg addition and went the entire 5 minutes.   I ended up chilling the mixture and rebeating it, but it never reached the volumn I expected -- and barely filled the pie plate.   I did use egg beaters-egg substitute to avoid the raw eggs for small kids and pregnant sister-in-law, but that shouldn't have caused the mixture to fall.   Used cocoa & oil  instead of the unsweetened chocolate.  Not sure if I will try again.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and not only did every crumb get "gobbled" up, but I've had multiple requests to make it again for Christmas dinner. Follow the directions exactly for adding the eggs. This is well worth the time and effort.

I made this pie for my fiance who loves chocolate pie.  He said that it was very good, but would prefer regular chocolate pie.  This is more of a mousse.  However, I took some to my work and they ranted and raved about the pie!  I am not a big pie person, but I thought the chocolate part was great.  Very easy to make also!

The best thing I have ever eaten!  I have access to fresh eggs so they were still warm when I put them in the recipe.  I served it for dinner/game night and about 1 a.m. three people had seconds.  Very rich and right up my alley!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Delicious and easy!!!  the five minutes per egg kind of gets you though!  Reminded me of a chocolate silk pie, but easier to make.

wow. this is amazing.
i used regular sugar and there was not a hint of grittiness, it was very smooth but the second time i made it it was not as smooth, i will use the extra fine sugar next time.
it is a VERY rich pie though and very hard to eat one slice!. chocolate lovers will love it for sure.
so much better than the chocolate pies made with pudding but very different as well.

Oh my!  Absolutely the creamiest and smoothest chocolate pie I've ever had...even from restaraunts.  I did use superfine sugar and there was not a speck of grittiness.  This is  nothing similar to the pudding-made pies.  Kids love it.
