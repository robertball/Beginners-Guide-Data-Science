After reading the reviews, I omitted the cinnamon. Other than that I followed the recipe, using a frozen banana. I like a thicker smoothie and this was very runny. I did not add more ice because it would have watered it down and to me it lackes flavor as is.  Will not make this again.

I didn't love this one. I rate it between a 3-4. I am glad I read the first review about the strong cinnamon taste. As a result, I only did 1/4 tsp. and it still was a dominant flavor. After blending I found this to be more icy then creamy, which I prefer. So, I just left it in my Vitamix until it was smooth and all the ingredients were well incorporated. By that point, it was more like a thick cold chocolate milk with a hint of cinnamon and peanut flavor. Only change I made was subbing peanuts, 2 Tablespoons, for the peanut powder.

I like the fact that this smoothie has fewer calories in it due to the powdered peanut butter and the unsweetened almond milk. I really like the peanut butter and chocolate combo. However, I don't care for the cinnamon flavor in it...and I really like cinnamon, just not in this particular smoothie. I will omit it the next time I make this drink.

I made this one and it tasted awesome and was super easy to make, I would tone down the cinnamon a little though.

I enjoyed this smoothie, it was my first time using peanut butter powder. I used about 1-1/2 frozen bananas. And the cinnamon taste didnâ€™t bother me!

I really liked it. I didn't add any cinnamon or cocoa powder since I used peanut butter powder with hazelnut which is pretty sweet for me. And I also used almond milk instead.

I tried it without the ice first and the frozen banana made it thick enough for me.  I also added about a cup of kale and really liked it!

Very good, healthy recipe. It was a little thin so I added one scoop of chocolate protein powder.  Will definitely make it again.

Made it exactly as listed except only had 1/4 cup of almond milk so I added 1/4 of whole milk. I also used a frozen banana. Refreshing and delicious.
