I grew up in an Italian family and polenta was common. I must confess, however, that I was always disappointed when Mom or Grandma served it because I hated it. (An understatement, for sure) I'm thinking if I had grown up with polenta THIS way I would have had a whole different attitude about it. Even more startling, Hubs hates polenta and he hates Parmesan cheese. I made him eat this anyway - he said I could make this anytime, and exactly as I made it tonight. The combination of water, milk and chicken broth?  Excellent. (For the record, I like my polenta creamy, so I skipped the step of baking it)

This is good, but next time I think I will add more cornmeal.  I like polenta a little drier.  Since that is my personal preference I can't fault the recipe!  I like the idea of the garlic and Parmesan cheese in the recipe!

I love grits and polenta.  This is a fantastic recipe!  So easy and so yummy.  The garlic and parmesan are wonderful additions.  I used 3/4 tsp dried rosemary, and although I do like rosemary, it was still a bit too perfumey, next time I"ll try a little less or as previously suggested, omit all together.  I bet this would be good sliced and fried in some butter the next day too!

One of my favorite recipes to make.  I usually triple the recipe and make one for me, mom and sis..  No wheat for them so this recipe is perfect.. I make exactly as given except I leave it in the oven about 30 minutes more.. then I can cut slices like a cake when it cools.

Based on other posts here I omitted the rosemary.  Instead, I used 1/2 tsp of Italian Seaoning. Wonderful flavor, easy recipe.  I'll make it again.

This is fabulous, the only thing that I changed was I swapped basil for the rosemary just because we don't like rosemary. The first night this was creamy, soft and delicious.  I was originally looking for a firmer, sliceable polenta and after having this in the fridge overnight that is exactly what it was.   Today for lunch I was able to slice it into wedges. Wonderful both ways!   I will make this regularly!

This recipe is great with the garlic, I nix'd the rosemary, added cumin and a touch of smoked paprika while on the stovetop, then tucked shallots into the casserole polenta while baking in the oven. I also drizzled a rich olive oil beneath and over the polenta in the casserole dish. 

I'm shooting for a spoonable polenta, so baking for 30 minutes wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I'm still learning!!! I subbed milk for coconut milk too. Less dairy = better for me.

WOW!  No more frozen Trader Joe's polenta for me!  This was fantastic!  I would like to play around with flavor combos in the future (maybe basil instead of rosemary, or chopped spinach..) but at the same time don't want to mess with the perfection of this recipe :p  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I subbed regular chicken broth and half-n-half instead of milk.  Had it for dinner and then leftovers for breakfast the next day. I love grits and the only thing that will prevent me from making this again is I love to try new grit/polenta recipes.

Made recipe exactly as listed - half of my family loved it - half did not.  But it was a texture issue more than anything.

I didn't have any chicken stock on hand but had a chicken and tomato bullion cube on hand that I decided to try instead. The polenta tasted so good that I actually decided not to add the parm and it didn't need any additional salt or pepper either!

Thought this was delicious. Served it under a short ribs recipe and the presentation was magnifique, haha!  I left out the rosemary and added a little more parmesan and it was a big hit.  Loved that the last 30 minutes were in the oven so many polenta recipes seem to be stove top, serve immediately.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the suggestions to use the basil instead of rosemary, it's our favorite any way. Instead of putting more basil on top I used Italian seasoning. It gave it a bit of contrast as a topping.

I made this tonight and served with grilled sausages which I sliced and laid over the top - we really enjoyed the end result. I cut the recipe in half and it would have served 4 people as a side dish. Although I did use fresh rosemary, I felt like the recipe could have used a bit more. As well, although I did bake it, I feel like this is not a necessary step - it would have been delicious straight out of the pot.

This is a good side. I had cornmeal mix, so I left out the salt and it was perfect. I always forget I have to bake polenta, but it definitely needed it.  I served it with the Braised Pork Ragu and enjoyed it.

I really liked this.  My husband did too! I added some butter and just a bit of cream and olive oil.  Otherwise, directions followed.  I liked the rosemary, and used just a bit more than was called for, but I like that flavor.  It was fantastic with our dinner.  I'll make this again.

Pretty good I guess. I halved the rosemary, which flavor makes it good with a meat side dish (I had it with the balsamic pork recipe from this site). I can see this good with lots of other side dishes if you just switch the seasoning accordingly.

Crazy amazing good. I imagine you can switch out the Parmesan & rosemary for other flavors but we enjoyed as it. Only change was a very little olive oil drizzled over the top before baking

Just fabulous! It tasted perfect as is listed in the recipe. I then added extra garlic, beans, and mushrooms. Beans give it a little more protein. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I love the idea of this, and with basil instead of rosemary the polenta cooking on the stove was delicious, but it most certainly did not bubble and brown in the oven.   Also, it came out grainier than I've had in restaurants, and I wonder if there is a finer cornmeal available (I used Bob's Red Mill).  Next time I might try running it under the broiler, but if it's supposed to boil, it's way too thick and would need to be more liquid when it's put in the oven.

Really don't know how you could rate this less than five stars (especially if you liked it)! Great flavor, served with chicken marsala and got raves.  I actually prefer a thicker polenta but I can find no fault with this.  Really appreciate you posting this, thank you.

This was my first time eating (and making) polenta, so I really wasn't sure what to expect.  I followed the instructions, but used half and half instead of milk.  I liked the polenta better before I baked it; it had an egg-bake like texture after baking, but I may have overcooked it.  After 30 minutes, it still was not bubbling or golden brown, so I gave it another 15 minutes, and it still wasn't golden or bubbly.  I will definitely make this again, but bake for less time, or not at all.  I made this to go with "Pork Chops Italiano," also from this site.

I used a parmesan/asiago cheese blend. Tasted good, but I might change the cheese next time. Served with Italian Style Pork Chops, brussels sprouts, and green beans.
