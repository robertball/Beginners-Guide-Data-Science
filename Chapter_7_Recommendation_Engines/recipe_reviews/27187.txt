I made this the first time using exactly what the recipe called for and it was incredible but the 83 grams of fat (in the entire recipe) bothered me.  I tried it again and used fat free half and half and it was again, incredible.  I honestly could not even tell it was made without the cream.  (I used about 3/4 cup of half and half instead of the full cup since it is thinner than cream.)  My hubby said it was better than anything you can buy from the store.  The fat is incredibly low with only that from the butter.  Try it with the FF half and half--you might be surprised!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Satiny, shiny, chocolate-y, smooth, rich and delicious...but could be thicker. Next time I'll either cook and stir till good and thick, or add less cream.

This is the best fudge sauce I've ever tasted; husband and sons agree with me!! I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate squares on hand so I mixed 12 tablespoons of premium unsweetened cocoa powder with four tablespoons of canola oil and then prepared the rest of the recipe as written. Outstanding!! Never again will there be store-bought chocolate sauce in this house. I can't wait to try this with ice cream cakes and as a topping for brownies. My search for a truly delicious, rich chocolate sauce is now over. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

The flavor is very chocolatey. I think it would appeal to all chocoholics out there. My only concern with this sauce is that it turned a consistency much like tub margarine. A bit on the firmer side. Which means that each time you want to use it you will definately have to reheat it. Guess I was looking for a consistency more like chocolate syrup.But the flavor is incredibly chocolatey.

Delicious!!  I will never buy jarred again.  The recipe is really easy.  I subbed the cream for evaporated milk and, per previous reviews, used much less liquid (probably about 4 ounces total) because I like it really thick.

THis is the best hot fudge sauce.  I used semi sweet chocolate chips (no unsweetened chocolate in the house) and BROWN sugar (out of white sugar- but as you can tell, I was desperate!) and I also used SKIM milk instead of the cream (trying to make up for the fact that I am going to just EAT the entire batch).  I stirred in 1 T flour to make up for the difference in cream and Skim milk.  It was SOOOO GOOD!  YUMMY!

Very easy to make with stuff i had on hand.  I used two dark chocolate bars, the semi sweet kind.  I also subed lite coconut milk for the heavy cream and it tastes scrumptious!!!  I only used 1/3 of the sugar called for because my chocolate was already sweet.  Also I added less "milk" then called for in the recipe because i wanted a thick dark fudge sauce.  This was perfect for me and is just the right consistency now that it is in the fridge. 

THANKS!!!  Try this one and wow some friends.

Absolutely perfect. Mine thickened up nicely. I followed the directions exact EXCEPT using semi-sweet chocolate because that was all I had. We used this fudge sauce to make homemade peanut buster parfaits. What a fun way to end a Friday night!

Although I modified the recipe by using bittersweet chocolate chips, brown sugar, and half & half, it made a smooth, chocolatey, just-thick-enough sauce--perfect for our vanilla bean ice cream. Thanks for sharing your Mom's recipe, Erin, and I'd be interested in your recipe for "Eskimo Pie Delight"!

Excellent. I served this over chocolate brownies & vanilla ice cream. As you only add a little cream at a time you can make it as thick or thin as you like.

WOW!  GREAT!  That being said this is what "I" did for our tastes.  We love DARK chocolate sooooo.......I used the 4 sqrs. of unsweet. chocolate and cut the sugar to 2/3 cups and put in 2 Tablesp. of butter and used Vanilla paste....and my secret ingredient?  Espresso powder (1/2 tsp.)....that's IT.....DARK CHOCOLATE SAUCE.....made an entire jar which is going camping with us next week.  SO.....GREAT RECIPE and excellent suggestions from the other reviewers.  THANKS ALL and THANKS Erin for posting this!   By the way.....yes, I used the fattening cream because if I am having real hot fudge I am having the REAL deal.

Wow! This sauce is soooo GOOD! I used semi sweet chocolate so I only added 1 tbsp of sugar (for a half batch of the sauce). I used half and half to and only added 1/4 cup. The sauce was really thin (possibly due to my modifications?) I added 1 tbsp of cornstarch and cooked it for an additional 10 min. and it was perfect.  Thanks SO mch for the recipe:)

This is a delicious chocolate sauce!  I prefer to make it with 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the full cup--it is still plenty sweet!  I have made this many times!

Just made this, as I realized I had one cup of light cream that was due... 2 days ago, lol.  (It was still good though!)  This is SO delicious!  I probably would have never tried it otherwise, cause I have a go-to hot fudge recipe, but I'm glad I tried this- so good, rich, thick, flavorful.  It's good either hot, or right outta the fridge!

Fantastic fudgey gooey yum. I used it in an ice cream cake as the top layer & it was perfect - remaining a little soft even through freezing.

My husband loves this sauce.  I served it over homemade double chocolate pecan brownies and homemade chocolate velvet ice cream-definitely death by chocolate!  I want to try it in steamed milk with homemade espresso marshmallows.  I added a dash of powdered espresso to the sauce to give it some depth.  I may try some cayenne next.

This is a really yummy recipe; good enough to give as a gift. Besides the exceptional flavor & texture, it is easy to do and requires a minimum of ingredients (Several you could easily have on hand.).

Not sure about those who say this is way too sweet, I used all the called for sugar and still found the taste to be very mild. The texture was somewhat runny and I know that will be fine for pouring over dessert but I do like a thicker topping. This would be a nice complement to whatever it is served with because of its subtle flavor. It is a very simple recipe and as some have mentioned there is no problem with a grainy sugar residue. But,I will continue my search for the perfect hot fudge sauce.

This is a delicious chocolate sauce, but not quite the "fudge" sauce I was looking for. We enjoyed it, nonetheless. I am giving 4 stars because the sugar being called for is way too much! I used half that amount and it was perfect.

mmmmmm  this is fantastic over peppermint stick ice cream! I didn't have cream but I did have fat free half and half which I used and as suggested by another person, I only added about 3/4 cup of the fat free half and half. It was perfect and chocolaty! I was very skeptical as my mom used to use it making one of the canned milk ones. It is really nice to have a chocolate sauce recipe to use tha requires everything (basically) I have on hand!

I used 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. 1/3 cup sugar and 1 cup half and half (had it on hand instead of heavy cream).  This stuff is really good and perfect!  I put everything except vanilla in sauce pan and cooked on low-med heat (number 4 on my stove), until it thickened to desired consistency. Then take off heat and add vanilla.  Definitely, make a double batch of this stuff.  You will go through it quickly! Tastes like the kind you would buy in the grocery store.

Very worthy of 5 stars.  However, it's over the top decadent with 5 ounces unsweetened chocolate bar cubes. Velvety smooth and rich. 2% evaporated milk works well too.

Delicious and fudgy. I substituted skim milk for the cream and it came out perfectly - and saved a lot of fat and calories. To get a good consistency (not too thin and not too thick) it's important to watch your cooking time. Whisk gently but constantly over medium low heat. When the sauce starts to coat the bottom of the pan, it's done.

This recipe was great.  My husband thought the vanilla flavor was a little strong, so I plan to use half the vanilla next time.

What a terrific THICK fudge sauce, easy to make! I doubled the recipe and cut back some on the cream. Both my husband and son are firefighters - I occasionally cook dinner for their crews. They went ga-ga over this warmed sauce used for brownie sundaes...I plan on making this for Christmas gifts this year, thanks for a wonderful recipe

I made this exactly as written specifically to use up some unsweetened chocolate languishing in my pantry and a cup of cream that needed to be used. It got rave reviews from the family!  You could probably get away with less sugar and I'll add some espresso powder next time - that really brings out chocolate flavor.  But this was so easy, I will never buy fudge sauce again.

I made this with unsweetened baker squares and it turned out well.  The key is to put it on LOW so there are the slightest bubbles, and stir stir stir stir stir.  The more you stir, the thicker it will get.  It will separate from the butter oil the more it sits so stir before you pour.  It seizes up on ice cream just like hot fudge should.  I might put more heavy cream in it when I warm it up so it won't be so thick when the cold ice cream hardens it.  Will make again.

Looking for a ice cream parlor type hot fudge recipe I came across this one and it is the best. Tried a few others and this one had the taste and texture I was searching for. I have made this recipe several times and have experimented with different substitutions to reduce fat and sugar. As another reviewer suggested, I substituted the heavy cream for fat free half and half and also substituted the sugar with Truvia baking blend. Thus, the substituted version was nearly fat free and sugar free. Also replaced the butter with Earth Balance switching the saturated fats with good fats. I use between half and 3/4 of the amount of cream as original recipe suggests for a thicker texture. I use on fresh fruit! Fabulous recipe! Guests love it and cannot tell the reduced fat/sugar version from the real thing. Thanks!!!

Yummy!  I used evaporated milk instead of cream.  It is thinner, but the taste is incredible and goes great with vanilla icecream by itself or with hot brownies and icecream on top!

Amazing!! I used 2 squares of bakers chocolate and 2 ounces of semi sweet chocolate chips (about 1/2 cup), and I used half and half instead of cream because that is what I had on hand. Other then that I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! Thank you!

Absolutely delicious! I used 1 cup of evaporated milk instead of cream because we had some left over from a previous recipe. It still came out creamy and thick and chocolatey.

This is the only recipe I use anymore.  Quick, easy and delicious.  I've used it to make hot chocolate too by stirring a couple of spoonsful into a cup of hot milk.  Great to include in a gift basket or bag too.

This is a very good recipe for hot fudge sauce.  I don't think I cooked it long enough, though, because the texture was grainy from the sugar.  I think had I cooked it longer and let the sugar all dissolve, that it would have been just right!  I will definitely try using this recipe again.

Made this last night - Wow. Delicious guilt in a bowl. 

Next day update: I even snuck into the kitchen and just ate some of this with a spoon all by itself.

Man I had really high hope for this!  I used all the ingredients correctly, but I did substitute whole milk for cream.  I used scharffen berger chocolate and i had lumps at the bottom.  I stirred alot so I don't know what went wrong...it was also too thin which may have been because I used whole milk instead cream?  But from the other reviews it looks like thin is the way this sauce comes out until it hits ice cream?

The flavor, however, is perfect.

This was great!  The consistency was perfect.  It didn't puddle at the bottom of the bowl, but it was thin enough to pour.  We put it on a sundae with a brownie, chocolate ice cream and topped with walnuts.

This was yummy.  I did things a little differently.  Instead of melting the chocolate in the microwave I added it to the cream mixture.  I used the whole cup and it was not too thin.

Not grainy at all.  I started stirring b4 adding the cream, added slowly and stirring constantly.  Maybe that's why.  I dunno.  Very good. Thinner than I wanted, but so what.  sort of a high quality hershys syrup, but better.  I really loved it--even cold. loose a star for being a little more chocolate, than fudgy and not as thick.  but more versatile for  those reasons.

This was tasty, if you just dip your finger in it. It didn't have the "hot fudgey" consistency I was looking for though. . It gets thick like fudge in the fridge but doesn't keep the thick consistency when heated. It would probably be pretty good if you topped a brownie with it, though

I have been less that satisfied with other hot fudge recipes I've tried, but this was delicious. I'd just made salted caramel ice cream (cuisinart website recipe...SO good) and wanted to make some hot fudge to go on top. I did make a couple of changes. I used 1/3 cup white and 1/3 cup and melted it down with 1 T butter hoping this would make my sauce smooth and not grainy like they usually turn out. It worked! I only had a litte cocoa powder...1 T and some semisweet chocolate chips and half and half, but it still turned out great. It thickened up well in the fridge overnight. Addictive!

This is good, but way too sweet for me. I could probably cut the sugar in half and be content. I used Saco premium cocoa (with organic coconut oil vs. the vegetable oil they recommend) warming it all up on the stove at once. Then added 3/4 cup 2% milk in place of heavy cream. Less milk would have worked for a thicker fudge, but I was trying to tone down the sweetness! This is a great hot fudge recipe and I am now confident I can make a great homemade hot fudge with a little tweaking and cut the calories by half. Thanks!

I had the in-laws over for dinner and served this over vanilla ice cream for dessert. We all enjoyed it; it is good and very easy to make. I used a bittersweet chocolate and only used 3/4 c. of sugar. I also did not use all the cream, as at 3/4 c. it seemed to be a good consistency. I used premium chocolate and cream so it was not cheap to make and costs the same or more as some fabulous fudge sauces I can get locally, therefore, I'm not sure I'll make again but I'm glad I tried it.

Made this tonight with a few adaptions. I used semisweet chocolate as I didn't have unsweetened. I cut back on the sugar and followed recipe as written. The sauce turned out super yummy! Thanks so much for the delicious recipe as we truly enjoyed it. Will make again.

Followed directions exactly - except used half and half instead of heavy cream. Delicious. Hoping it keeps well - if it does we'll never buy the bottled stuff again.

Make sure you read the instructions...I melted the cocoa with everything in the recipe together, oh no...not good. But if it's done right, it's amazing.

I've stopped buying chocolate fudge and stopped looking for a recipe!  I've substituted half and half and found it is still a superior recipe.

This sauce is fantastic and so easy.  Be sure to use real butter!  I used whole milk in place of the cream and still rate the recipe 5 stars.  Using cream the recipe would be 10 stars!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty!  I just wish it would've stayed creamy/smooth, once it hit the ice cream, it kind of became chewy.  I saved myself the trouble and just melted the chocolate right in the sauce pan.

I've never had a better chocolate sauce.  Just outstanding.  I never use chocolate squares instead I use cocoa powder with coconut oil.  Also, I forgot to put in the vanilla extract so I had a chance to taste test before and after adding vanilla and I actually thought it was richer and more sophisticated without it.  I use real vanilla extract.

The best recipe I've tried for fudge sauce and I've tried many! Perfect hot and just as perfect cold on a spoon out of the jar! I only had one square of Baker's chocolate left, so like a previous reviewer I made up the difference with Dutch-process cocoa powder and canola oil. (Note: I've used natural cocoa powder (i.e., Hershey brand) in other hot fudge recipes, but would recommend the Dutch-process if you can find it. I find it tastes better in this recipe.)

Last night I made "Creamy Vanilla Ice Cream" (from this site)for my boyfriend for his sore throat. I forgot to grab hot fudge from the store so I decided to give this recipe a try. Even better than Smuckers!! And doesn't contain any high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oils!Halved the recipe, used Ghirardelli unsweetened squares and doubled the amount. Even threw in a few Ghirardelli 60% Cocoa chips I had laying around. Excellent. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!!

Changed it a little. I used splenda instead of sugar, FF half-n-half instead of cream and used light butter. Was tasty and the kids loved it on their homemade ice cream!

I have yet to eat this over ice cream but it tastes great by itself.  I did add quite a bit more sugar than the recipe called for because some of my guests don't really like a more bitter chocolate.  So, more or less sugar could be added, depending on your taste. :)

Fantastic taste - very rich and chocolate-y.  However thinner than most fudge sauces.  I made a half-recipe and it turned out fine.  Definitely a keeper...thanks for the post!

This was certainly an acceptable hot fudge sauce but it didn't have the depth of flavor I was expecting.  Maybe I should have added less cream because it seemed to thin to me. I will probably look for another recipe.

A good, in-a-pinch hot fudge sauce. I should've held back on the cream, maybe 1/4 cup, to give it a thicker consistency. True hot fudge sauce uses cocoa for a richer, more intense flavor, but it also take a long time to make and can get grainy when cooled. None of those problems with this recipe, and again this works well if you're pressed for time. Try to use a premium unsweetened chocolate for better flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a perfect recipe; easy, delicious and impressive.  I served it with pound cake and ice cream and garnished with sliced strawberries.  Would also be perfect with cheesecake, brownies, whatever.  Thanks Erin for a recipe that should be in everyone's file!

Turned out great and I made it completely in the microwave.  I didn’t have enough cream so I only used about 2/3 cup of cream. Was just fine.

5 star indeed!  I used 12 T. cocoa powder and a combination of  canola oil and butter (2 T. of each) to substitute for not having unsweetened chocolate squares on hand.  I used all of the sugar and nearly all of the whipping cream, but not quite, probably reserving approx. 2-3 T.  I did add 1 oz. of semi sweet chocolate chips only because I wanted an extra dose of chocolate flavor and I had a bit left in a bag that needed to be used.  The sauce was perfect, no grainy texture, not runny but thick as you would want the sauce to be.  I'm giving it as a gift and it filled a 16 oz. Ball canning jar to the top.  My chocolate-loving sister will be in heaven with this sauce...she'll probably eat it right out of the jar and I wouldn't blame her!

This is great as is . . I seriously hate when people change it then rate it . . ?  Or when something is based on fat and they make it fat free . . Fat free cream . . ?  Really ? Aren't you more scared of the chemicals they are replacing the fat with ? Moderation is the key . This is sauce not soup . . . Hahahaha  look up some of the things they are replacing the fat with.

Excellent flavor and so easy to prepare. I didn't have any unsweetened chocolate so I used cocoa. My ratios:  3/4 cup sugar, 2/3 cup cocoa, dash salt, no butter, 3/4 cup half n half and 1/2 t vanilla. Came out perfect. Apparently this recipe can be customized without fail.  Make it already!!

This is delicious hot fudge sauce.  I did use cocoa instead of unsweetened squares of chocolate.  I served this over an ice cream cake that I made.  I will surely make this again.

Yum! I made this as a dip for fruit, and it was amazing. I've tried other recipes before, and didn't much care for them. This one is a keeper. And so quick and easy to make!
I liked it as is, but for the kids I had to add some more sugar, it was too bitter for them. Next time (and there will be a next time!) I will try semi sweet chocolate, that might work better for the kiddos.
This will be so good over ice cream, I can't wait to try that.

Oh my goodness!!! This was the best chocolate fudge sauce ever! And by the way it serves way more than eight people depending how much sauce you like. I put mine in a cute jar and it is best if you store it in the fridge. Just heat up a little or keep it cool but before you do this give it a nice stir.

This fudge was really good. It was more of a dark chocolate but I had to substitute cocoa powder for the baking chocolate. I think I would like to try it with semi-sweet chips.

I made this to top a homemade pumpkin cheesecake. I used margarine instead of butter & I used 1 cup lite coconut milk instead of the heavy cream. Looks beautiful/shiny. However, not as sweet as I would like by itself. Perfect for sweet desserts. Our 5 & 2 yr old girls LOVE it! Not bad in coffee, either:)

We really enjoy this sauce! I use cocoa powder and canola oil instead of the baking squares and a little less cream. I've also made it with the fat free half and half vs. the cream. It turned out great!

This turned out good. The only changes I made were that I halved the recipe. I poured it on my ice cream while it was still pretty warm and thin, but now that its cooled a little its thickened up a bit, but not as thick as I'd like. Maybe after I refrigerate it. It was still tasty though!

at first i thought it was awfully thin for a hot fudge sauce, but once it cooled onto my ice cream... it was exactly what i wanted. ooey gooey and delicious! i just used baker's chocolate this time but will definitely try it with a better quality chocolate like a scharffen berger. can hardly wait!

I'm a chocoholic, but this was even strong for me.  I knew my husband wouldn't like it so I ended up adding 4 more oz of cream and 1/2 C more sugar and a little extra vanilla.  It was okay with the extra ingredients, but I'll be looking for a different recipe.

definately a keeper!  Made to just have on hand in the fridge!  I bet this would be amazing over the sticky chocolate cake I made yesterday from here. (that was great too, but liked it much better warm than cold).  I used an 85% Lindt chocolate bar and 2oz instead of 1oz, just because....  mmm  thank so much for sharing!  Lorrie

This looked kind of curdled once it cooled but the flavor was good. I subbed fat free evaporated milk for the cream, so this can be a fat free and corn syrup free sauce. My family liked it much better than Hershey's.

yumm. this is very good. I did it a little differently though, using what I had. I used low fat heavy cream, salted butter and semi-sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened. I also used half a cup of sugar instead of a whole cup. The result was perfect, not too sweet. I also served it over brownies and vanilla ice cream. will make this again MANY times

I made this to accompany a Maraschino Cherry Cake on this site.  (Going for the chocolate covered cherries thing.)  Just as things got going, I had to let the dog out (Never fails!), and by the time I returned the sauce had actually boiled briefly.  But not to worry!  It turned out silky and thick and just the right intensity.  Quick, easy, and yummy.

Very easy to make, came together quickly.  It tasted delicious, but was a little on the thin side.  I guess I was looking for a hot fudge sauce that was a little thicker, but I got rave reviews at our Christmas Eve dinner - kids of all ages and the adults loved it.  Will make again.
