I too don't really care for microwave use and already had my oven on so threw these in at 375 degrees for about 50 minutes.  I only used 1 very large baking potato cut into wedges.  Used EVOO in lieu of vegetable oil.  Added salt and pepper to taste with the other 2 spices.  Didn't have parmesan so grated some romano cheese at the end.  My husband liked these very much.  Very simple recipe that can be tweeked w/spices to taste.

These potatoes were really good!  I cooked them about half way in the microwave then put into the oven for about 20 minutes to complete the cooking and "crispy" up the outer edges.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and put everything in a plastic bag and shook it to coat the potato wedges.  Next time will use less oil as it seemed oilier than necessary.  Husband ate 3 servings.  Will definitely make again!

These were really easy and very flavorful.  Because my wedges were done before the rest of the meal, I placed them in the oven to stay warn.  Some of the wedges started to get crispy and they were the best.  Next time I think I will make in the oven so all the wedges are crispy.

I think this recipe is great, except I don't like to microwave food.  I think that it turned out good in the oven 350 degrees for 45 min. adding the cheese near the end.

I didn't measure anything...just sprinkled it on. I used red potatoes & put them in a pyrex baking dish. Sprinkled them w/ the oil & seasoning & nuked them for 7 minutes. Heated the oven up to 425 & finished them off in there for about 10 minutes although I think they could have used 5 minutes more, to crisp them up a bit further. These were perfect w/ a homemade hamburger...thanks!

Loved this recipe.  As a few had suggested, I actually just mixed the spices into the oil and then tossed the wedges around in the oil to coat.  I switched to olive oil and used 1 tsp paprika (my teaspoons are always heaping!), 1 tsp garlic powder, 2 tbsp romano cheese (instead of Parmesan), and 1 tsp. cayenne pepper, along with the salt and pepper.  

Once tossed, I put the potatoe wedges on a baking sheet and baked at 400 degrees for 30-40 min.

Thanks for the great recipe!

Good quick sidedish.  Doesn't heat up the kitchen in the summer and can be served with many things.

This was soooo easy and very delicious.  I am not partial to cooking in the microwave as i tend to use it more for heating things up. I must admit i was pleasantly surprised. I added lots of the called for spices and used garlic salt as well as powder to bring out the flavours.  The paprika really livened up the colouring and made these potatoes look very appetizing.  My 4 year old had thirds, so this is a definate keeper.

These were alright, but I wouldn't serve them to guests. They came out soggy, as expected. If I were to use this recipe again, I would bake the potato wedges in the gas oven instead of microwave. Otherwise, they tasted fine, but just not crunchy on the outside, the way I love my wedges.

deeelicious recipe!! This is proof that a microwave can actually cook food. My tips: (1)As mentioned by another reviewer, shake all the ingredients with the potatoes in a bag (2) I added dried oregano and basil (3)I sprinkled on the cheese only during the last minute of cooking (4)I use only two potatoes and my 700W output microwave takes a total of 5 minutes for this recipe. Adjust the timing to suit yours. (5)Arrange the potatoes along the outer egde of the plate, with the thick sides facing outward.
Happy Eating!!

Did not turn out well in my microwave. I prepared these and microwaved them over twice as long as the recipe calls for and they still were not cooked through.

Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and after microwaving these put them in the oven at 425 for 10 or 15 min to get them crispy. This really cut down on the bake time, which I liked. I will do this more often! Used my own blend of seasonings = Mrs. Dash on these, so good!

I usually don't rate recipes that I've tweeked much, but since this is given as a tweekable recipe, I am.  I used a pizza seasoning mixture from Winco, cooked for 8 minutes in my microwave, sprinkled on the parmesan and then 3 minutes under my broiler in my convection oven.  Absolute perfection!

These were just potato wedges with seasoning.  Good for a weeknight fast meal, but nothing to rave about.

My picky eater daughter said this was the best potatoe wedges she ever had.  With her endorsement and ease and convience of the receipe, it is a keeper.  My micro is 1500 watts. 10 min would have been too long and would have made the potatoes hard and tough.  I found 8 min. to be perfect.

My family loved these. I did follow other reviews and baked these instead of making in the microwave. I bake them at 400 for about 30-35 minutes. I also added a little cayene pepper. Quick and easy recipe for nights when time is short and the people in your life still expect to be fed LOL

These were pretty good, although I did bake them in the oven at 400 for about 35 minutes.  My daughter loved them! They are espically good with dipping sauce! I will definately make these again!

Easy and tasty.  However, mine did take longer than 10 minutes to cook but that could have been because my wedges were too big--I got 8 per potato.  I also thought it would be easier to shake the wedges in a bag with the seasonings and oil for better coverage.  We had these with "fry sauce" (also from this website) and thoroughly enjoyed it.

I put these in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes, then turned it up to 400 for the last 5-10 minutes.  I think the title is a bit misleading - it certainly was not spicy and I was pretty liberal with the paprika.  I brushed EVOO on the wedges and sprinkled the seasonings on.  Will adjust seasonings next time according.

I've been using a variation of this recipe for years with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and 1 tsp paprika. Combine dry ingredients. Coat potato wedges with oil, then add dry ingredients to potatoes. Stir to coat. Pour into microwavable dish (I use a pie plate) and cook for 3 minutes. Stir. Repeat until you've cooked the potatoes for 12 minutes.

very tasty-- nice and soft.  
recommended changes:  * toss the spices and oil with the potatoes.
* do NOT put in the oven, as it dries the potatoes out.

Adding the basil and oregano made a difference as well as oven baking.  I microwaved for a short time to quicken cooking time, then added to oven and the broiler to brown....great side dish

Sweet Potato Alternative - Because I need to reduce sodium & avoid white potato, I roasted olive oil rubbed sweet potatoes sprinkled with thin sliced onions, fresh minced garlic, fresh finely chopped spinach, paprika, cayenne & cracked black pepper - yummy.

Added some chili powder for more spice. Huge hit with my husband. I also really enjoyed these. A keeper for sure.

I couldn't resist the temptation to throw them in my broiler oven for a couple of minutes to crispy them up!!! I also used garlic flavored olive oil in place of the vegetable oil, but, I think 3 tablespoons of any oil would be an overkill! Especially if you are going to use a microwave.

This microwave version could be useful in a hurry but for the best flavor, I baked them in a 400 degree oven, 15 mins and added the cheese the last 5 mins until brown.

I actually took some of the other raters advice and didn't microwave them. I baked them on a broiler pan for 15 mins each sideat 450*. I also used Garlic Powder, Thyme, Parsley, Salt/Pep, and Lemon Pepper. I put all ingridients in a bowl w/ the oil, i used EVOO, and dipped the potatoes in the bowl and just sprinkled a light dusting of the same spices right before i baked them. All in all it was a decent recipe.

These were sooooo good.  I used cooking spray instead of vegetable oil and baked in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes instead of the microwave.  They went grate with my hamburgers that I bbq'd.  I will certainly be making these again. My husband gave his nod of approval also.

These would probably be way better in the oven, they were raw in some spots and overcooked in others (with my ancient microwave!).

I've never actually cooked anything in a microwave except tv dinners and just to reheat leftovers.  I was so pleased to find these turned out very good.

I'd prefer making potato wedges in the oven for the crispiness, but when I don't have a lot of time, this recipe is great.

Very good and easy to make. I always use russets when doing various wedge recipes because they bake best! The seasonings in this recipe go well together!

This was great because I diden't have to use the oven in this hot flordia weather!I would cook them alittle longer though.I also think next time I'll try mixing the seasonings and oil in a bag and coating the potatos first like others suggested.

This was pretty good and very easy.  The potatoes were a little mushy, but I popped them under the broiler for just a few minutes, and that did the trick.  I went a little heavy on the spices, so next time I'll reduce them a little, but I'll definitely experiment with this recipe.  Thanks!

I'm giving these 3 stars just because the cooking method really didn't work for me.  After cooking them for at least 25 minutes, I still had half hard, half soggy potatoes and had to throw them in the oven to salvage them.  The next time I tried them I took the basic recipe, cut the potatoes into cubes, and then bake them for about 30 minutes in the oven.  They were really good this way.

Didn't come out cooked enough and the spices didn't really stay on the potatoes.  A bit mushy.  It tasted a little bit better in a conventional oven.

these were so good! instead of microwaving them I cooked them in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes and I mixed the oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and paprika in a bowl and rolled the wedges in it instead of drizzling it on. After that I took a fork a poked some holes in the wedges and sprinkled some more garlic and paprika on top just to give it a little more flavor and it came out amazing!

I enjoyed the concept of this receipe, but I altered it a fair amount, by frying the potatoes after they have been microwaved. The microwave cooked the wedges quite well & they still remained moist on the inside.

I definitely need to cut them thinner, though, to ensure a crispier exterior. 

I altered it by adding the Olive oil in the frying pan & then added the flavours as I was frying them. Perhaps the flavour will change by covering it before it is microwaved. Something to look into.

These are great, of course I tweaked them with a little more of the herbs I like...and thats the reason we cook so we can have it our way....since this summer has been so hot...I lit only half the gas grill, put them on the unlit side & let them cook outside so I did not heat up the house......works with chicken, meatloaf too...

Okay, but nothing special. It could be because I cooked it in the oven or I'm not very good at doing most spices "to taste". I don't think we'll do this one again.

hmm - i liked these a lot - i used small white potatoes, so they were like mini wedges - and i used about 8 potatoes total. Some people said that they preferred oven baked for crispiness - but i found that when i used the cheese during the last 5 minutes or so - that really helped make them crispy - b/c cheese for that amount of time in the microwave does tend to crisp up (harden) - i didn't use parmesan - i used a shredded pizza cheese mix... very delicious and easy to make - especially when your using the oven for the main entree - then the microwave is useful - and in summer during hot months - you may not want to use the oven.

These are pretty good. I put them in the oven for about 10 more minutes to get them a little crispy. My 5 yr. old loves 'em. Thanks for the recipe.

Great idea & very easy to make!  I sprayed the pieces with olive oil instead of veg. oil.  They were a little on the dry side, but very tasty!  (I probably should have coated them a little better with the oil.)

I made this in the oven after reading previous reviews.  I would like to try a potato or two in the micro sometime, though.  I'm not a fan of skin-on potatoes, so I didn't eat any of these.  My 6 year old thought they were a little too hard around the skin(baked for an hour per another reviewer at 350)  My fiance said they were awesome.  I'll make these again, no fuss, easy.

Fast recipe.  I needed to make a side dish in less than 15 minutes.  I found this on the web and everyone loved the recipe!  I agree to place them in the oven to keep warm as well.

Really good for something SO fast and easy. You can really throw whatever spices you like on them. My husband ate them up!
