Wonderful salad dressing if you like lemon and dill that is....  If you don't then this really isn't for you.  That being said, I cut the recipe in half and used 3/4 cup of Hellman's lite mayo and recplaced the other 1/4 cup with with lite sour cream. If you want to go a little less heavy on the dill you can get away with just 1 Tbsp of that. This is one of those recipes that you can play around with a bit so if you love lemon go with the full 1/4 cup if not go with 2 Tbsp. and use 2 Tbsp. of buttermilk in place of the rest of the lemon juice. I also added 1/4 tsp. of salt. I would not muddy this up with the addition of garlic. This was great over mixed greens. I can also see this as a great veggie dip or dare I be so bold as to say a really simple and tasty potato salad dressing for red skinned potatoes with the addition of some green onion.....I'll have to give it a try some time!

Good basic recipe, but needed just a touch of salt and garlic to really bring it to life.  Great on salads and I also use it as a coating for baking fish.

Great dressing. I used it for a salad at a picnic and got rave comments on my salad. I'll use this one again for sure.

I had a WONDERFUL salad dressing two Christmases ago at the Opryland Hotel and it was a creamy dilly dressing, and this is the closest thing I've found that sounds similar. Cannot WAIT to try it and will let everyone know how it is!!! Thanks "anonymous"

I thought this was great!!  I've been weaning myself off bottled dressings - they taste too artificial to me.  This dressing was nice and fresh.  I used it on chef salads, side salads, and as a dipping sauce for crab cakes and squash fritters.  I will definately make this again.

Good dressing, although the mayo stood out a little too much for my tatse.  (I split the recipe) but, I added a little more buttermilk, some garlic powder, scallions, and a little sour cream.  And I only had fresh dill, I know that dried has a stronger flavor.  I will probably make again if I have extra buttermilk.

Excellent! I was looking for recipes to use up some of my dill gone wild in my herb garden & so I used fresh (lots of it) instead of dried & we loved it.  Thank you!

My husband liked this dressing more than I did.
It was a nice change instead of the usual ranch.
You could really taste the lemon so you have to like it!

The only reason I did not give this recipe a 5-star rating is that I don't care for dill.  However, I needed it to make this recipe for a party I was giving.  I used this recipe for both as a salad dressing and a coating for salmon.  For the salmon, I brushed it on both sides and grilled it.  It came out great from what my guests told me.  As for the dressing, I thinned out the mixture by adding some milk to it.  Everyone loved it too.  Thanks for the recipe.  I just wished I like dill.

Not terrible, but needed added zing of cider vinegar and salt.  Nothing special.

I made this to top some salmon cakes for lunch today and it was perfect!  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I subbed evaporated milk and a little bit of vinegar.  I scaled the servings down to 1 since it was just for my lunch and it was just the right amount for my salmon cakes.  I'll definitely make this again.

I was hoping this dressing would be like the lemon dill dressing at the Roadhouse Steak House. However, it was not. Very acidic. Very bland, and hard to doctor to make palatable.

I tolerated this recipe.  My changes would include remaking the entire recipe so what's the point?  To begin with I found it way too sour. Not sure why everyone else raved about it.

This dressing is simple to make, is the perfect consistency, and tastes very good. It is definitely tangy, but the lemon isn't overpowering. The dill flavor was understated, but definitely there. This was a nice change from  my usual dressing.

This was a very good dressing. I used half sour cream and added some fresh cracked pepper, salt, and a dash of garlic powder. Make sure to make this in advance because it gets better as it sits in the fridge. Was a great dressing for a salad I served with Hungarian Chicken Paprikash and homemade egg noodles.

I was not fond of this as a dressing for lettuce salad as it was a bit too mayo tasting however it was a great veggie dip.   I used the leftovers the next day as the mayo base for tuna salad sandwiches and it was fantastic!

I added garlic salt and pepper as previous reviewers indicated, but I ended up using this as a base for tuna salad, because the mayo came through too strong for me to use it as a dressing.

Add 1/2 cup sour cream and 3 TBS honey and some freshly chopped dill to this and it is PERFECT!  Also, let the dressing sit for a day or two for the dill taste to fully develop.  Love this in a salad over chicken - add some feta cheese too - YUM!
