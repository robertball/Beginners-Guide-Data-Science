This was an absolutely stunning recipe!  Melt in your mouth delicious filet mignon with a cream sauce worthy of this excellent cut of meat.  The crab stuffing was wonderful, not too over powering at all.  I noticed a lot of complaints about prep time and had a few suggestions.  Start by chopping all the ingredients first (the garlic etc) and have that all laid out and ready to go.  For measuring the whiskey, it's convenient to use a medicine measurement.  You know, like the ones that come on Pepto Bismol bottles.  I measured all tsp and tblsp along with ounces in that one cup and it worked out great.  I would definitely start the sauce first.  You don't need to mess with it and it can bubble along and reduse itself while you prepare the other parts.  Cook the bacon for a couple mins in between paper towels in the microwave to minimize mess and effort.  Next and while the bacon cooks, start the stuffing and then get the steaks cooked.  Once those are done, your sauce will be ready for the final touches.  Working in that order, this recipe took less than 40mins start to finish.  5 Stars and thank you so much for sharing!

After reading many of the reviews, I made the following adjustments, made the crab stuffing (doubled) and the sauce the night before because it is time comsuming to waiting for it to reduce.  Also, I like my bacon more crisping than soft so I precooked it to the soft-cooked stage before wrapping the filets.  You might have to use two strips to wrap a filet if you do this because they have shrinked.  The flavor is divine and if you do your prepwork ahead of time, it's worth the effort to put it on the table for company.

I'm giving this recipe 2 stars (for time), flavor deserves 5.  BEWARE!  It takes much longer than 1 1/2 hours to make.  Start it about 3 hours before you plan on serving (2 1/2 if you plan on making nothing to go with it).  Also, not a budget friendly recipe.  Forget about using shrimp stock.  This is an ingredient that you cannot buy at your local grocery store.  The crab stuffing was the easiest part of recipe.  It was very tasty and would advise doubling the mixture if you wish to have "genorously stuffed" mignons.  The peppercorn sauce smells so good while cooking, but takes forever to simmer down.  By the way, if anyone is unsure what constitutes "heavy cream", I asked several people (including dairy manager) & nobody knew for sure.  Some said "whipping cream" and others claimed "half and half".  I found out for sure that it's "whipping cream"!  All in all, very tasty.  Not quite sure it was worth the effort.  Since I was the cook, thrill of eating was gone by the time I was able to sit down.  The people I fed it to, loved it.  I was over it!  LOL!  I served it with fried asparagus, baked red taters & crusty Freedom (french) rolls.  Will not make again unless a VERY special occasion (extremely hot date, in-laws, etc...)  All said, it really is a 5 star recipe (if you have the time).

This is the best recipe I have - I altered it a bit, which reduced the time it takes to prepare and the ingredients.  Crab stuffing - sautee minced onion and red pepper, mix with crab meat, bread crumbs, cajun seasoning to taste, a little lemon juice and mayo (until it's formable).  I make the crab stuffing and stuff the filets the night before and then just pop them in the oven the next day when I'm making the dinner.  

On the sauce - to reduce the sauce to the thickness that is ideal, it will take over 30 minutes (to tell if it's ready, dip spoon in sauce and run your finger down back of the spoon - if the sauce recovers then it's not done).  

I also didn't do any of the bacon, shallots, mushrooms or mustard - kept it simple.  It's great served with asparagus and roasted red potatoes quartered and blanched in olive oil w/ rosemary.

I really wish I could give this 100 stars!  I didn't make the crab stuffing but I'm rating this for the sauce.  It was one of the best things I've ever made from this website.  First, let me say, that it is time consuming, but, oh so worth it.  When my very fussy, picky husband said it tastes like something you get from a 5 star restaurant (and he'd eaten all over the world) then I know I've got a winner.  The method of reducing the sauce takes about 45-50 minutes.  I kept checking it but it looked like it was reducing, but finally, it seems in the last 5 minutes it reduced to the most best flavor, thick sauce.  Then using the crimini mushrooms was so great and the whiskey was perfect.  I will definately be making this again and plan on serving it to guests next time.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

If you want to impress someone make this recipe.  I used pork tenderloin and used bay spice in the stuffing that someone had mentioned.  I broiled the stuffed filets to brown them and then finished baking them.....it probably was the best dinner I ever made.  My guests raved about it all night.

I have been wanting to try this recipe for some time now, but as others have said, you need to be able to allocate enough time to really do it right.

I felt that overall, this dish isn't all that hard to make. It's just a lot of prep work.

The flavors are great, and to reiterate everyone else, the sauce was amazing. It tasted like a steak with a crab cake center, which is all it is essentially.

The only thing i wish i did differently, was that i would have cut slightly deeper pockets. (I was afraid of ripping through the steak)

I highly recommend this recipe. Keep it your arsenal, and whip it out when you need to impress. Like when you're on a date, or the inlaws come over.

I made this for Father's Day, 2005.  Both my father and husband said this was one of the best meals they had ever had. My husband said he wished he could have "Tivoed" the dinner, it was just that good!  I followed the directions exactly except for the mushrooms.  The sauce never thickened for me either, but I simply added some cornstarch to it.  Many reviewers raved about the sauce. The sauce is awesome, but the addition of the crab made it five stars for me!  This recipe is a winner!  Because I was not rushing to prepare the meal, I did not find the prep time to be an issue.  I served it with roasted herb potatoes and asparagus.  We had the spinach strawberry salad (from this website)also! Every plate wwas clean!  If you are looking for a knockout dish, look no further!

5 stars won't do this one justice if my husband had his way with it!  Yes, the sauce does make the recipe, without a doubt.  I think I'll be making this for my next dinner party.  We served it with grill-roasted rosemary potatoes and a field greens salad...My husband will be raving about this one for a while!  We seared the filets on the stove first then grilled.  We had super-thick filets, though, and my husband was worried they would be undercooked, when in fact he overcooked them.  So, our steaks were well done all the way through, but it was still awesome.  He's bringing the leftovers to work tomorrow, and as usual his co-workers will ask what he brought for lunch (we are both near-gourmets)...I think they'll be climbing all over each other for a look at this lunch!

After reading other reviews - decided to skip the crab stuffing. Prepared sauce exactly as directed - poured over grilled ribeye steaks - was fantastic. Didn't want to miss out on the bacon -so fried bacon and crumbled into sauce w/sauteed mushrooms - was a huge hit with my husband - who normally doesn't want any sauce on his steak. Definitely a keeper!

Just a personal taste, but I preferred these without the crab stuffing. Not only does the crab stuffing make this dish shoot way up ($$), but I thought it tasted too rich and added a lot more steps of work! The sauce is great, and so I will make this again w/ just the sauce.

We made this recipe, minus the crab-stuffing, for a small dinner with friends and it was excellent! The sauce was very flavorful, and it tasted just as good as it smelled!! Will definitely be passing this recipe along.

Stunning! Made it for my wedding anniversary and everyone wanted seconds (alas, there were none). I only made two substitutions - user whole green peppercorns for the sauce and wholegrain mustard instead of dijon. Oh, and I flambeed the steaks as well. Turned out excellent, thankyou author!

This was fantastic, however I like my filet mignon a little on the rare side. I didn't like the idea of the crab meat on the inside soaking up all the blood and juces from the raw beef and I knew that the bacon wouldn't cook crispy in the time it takes to cook a rare steak.  I skipped the bacon completely (c'mon, who needs crab stuffing, cream sauce AND bacon??I just can't handle that much giult in one meal!)  instead of stuffing the filets, I seared them on the stove in a hot cast iron pan, then moved them to a foil lined baking sheet, I topped them with the crab meat stuffing, a small pat of butter on top and put them under the broiler until the stuffing browned on top.    It was spectacular

The peppercorn sauce was so easy to make and was absolutely delicious although not the best for you! However, the crab stuffing was way too salty and I like my food well seasoned. I also don't think the crab stuffing really complimented the rest. I would rather have these steaks with the sauce and a crab cake on the side.

Great Sauce!! Made original recipe for entire meal first- Used just sauce recipe for grilled steaks ! What I did was use a lesser pc. of steak in the cast iron skillet to get my yum-yums to deglaze for final steps! I made extra sauce for freezing! Sauce is also good on roast beef!! Thanks- PEACE!

This was by far the best steak I have ever prepared. This recipe must be prepared in stages start your peppercorn sauce at least 3 hrs before your dinner is expected, you can prepare the rest of your meal while you wait for your sauce to thicken follow my steps and you won't go wrong. I started the peppercorn sauce first I let it simmer at a slow roll for about an hour after I added the heavy cream I stirred it frequently until it reduced to a creamy consistency. In a large skillet I sauteed portabello mushrooms, shallots, and onion until tender than added the whiskey, peppercorn sauce and dijon mustard( I added 2 tble spoons ). I allowed 1 to 1 1/2 hrs at a slow roll for this to thicken. It was fabulous! I also made the crab stuffing using 2 6oz cans of crab and 1/2 tsp of creole seasoning 1/2 tsp of old bay seasoning. I prepared the stuffing while the peppercorn sauce was simmering. I placed the stuffing in a small baking dish and refrigerated until I cooked the steaks I cooked in the oven @ 350 for 20 min it was divine!!!! As for the steaks, I seasoned with garlic powder, adobo, and cracked pepper. I did not wrap in bacon However, I cooked 4 thick sliced pieces and cut in large pieces I seared my steaks in a combination of olive oil and bacon grease well done 10 min each side. med 6 min each side. I also sauteed some additional potabello mushroom after the steaks were to my desired doneness I topped with sauteed mushrooms and thick bacon planks and than poured the sauce ov

I am only rating the Peppercorn Sauce, as I served this on boneless pork chops!  The tast was PERFECT and exactly what I was looking for.  The sauce did not thicken and I wish the recipe gave some approximations of time for the sauce to reduce.  Next time I may add cornstarch or something to thicken the sauce a bit.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful sauce recipe!

Is this food or heaven? Holy crud this is good. It's a heavy meal but I loved every single torturous bite of it, nearly rupturing my stomach to finish it all :-)

I'm not crying about it though.

I made this dish for Valentine's dinner and my  boyfriend absolutely LOVED it. He said it was possibly the best steak he had ever had! I don't eat meat so I can only speak from the look on his face and what he told me but DELICIOUS :) I omitted the crab stuffing at the suggestion of a lot of people on here and he didn't seem to miss it. He said it was perfect without it. I will definitely make this again. THANK YOU!

This was absolutely delicious. By far one of the best recipes I've ever made.  The sauce by itself was to die for and deserves 10 stars, it can be used on so many different things.  It's a very pricey meal which is why it sat in my recipe box for over 2 years. We made it on Christmas Eve and even though I made the crab stuffing and began the sauce, as well as stuffed the steaks beforehand, it still took forever. I don't think I'll make this again because after all the time it took and the cost of the meal, we might as well have went out to eat. It was very very good, though and kind of made me feel like a chef :) Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good, I could actually feel myself gaining weight, but that's the point with something like this, and totally worth it.  Very, very, rich, but very, very, satisfying.  I'll be making this again, although prob only about once or twice a year.

Made this spectacular dish for Valentines day with twice baked potato and lobster tail (I submitted the photo).  I followed the advice of a few reviews, prepared the stuffing and sauce reduction the night before.  This recipe was not difficult.  It surprised and pleased the pallets of all my guests!!

Definitely took a long time to prepare the sauce (maybe an hour) but my boyfriend and I loved this. We used Woodford Reserve whiskey and we think it made a big difference. Cooked in the skillet this time but will probably grill the filets next time. Served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. Great for Valentine's Day!

My daughter-in-law and son made this for my birthday celebration (so I can't speak to the ease of prep.) but it was just wonderful!  The crabmeat stuffing was great in the filet and the sauce put it over the top. They served it with a salad and steamed asparagus.  Perfect!

Just the sauce - def takes hours to reduce.  This is very good, but not 5 star.  Very rich.

This recipe is Amazing! I added Shrimp in with the crab mixture as well and used jalapenos instead of bell peppers. The sauce takes forever to make but it is well worth the wait! It would save time to start the sauce ahead of time instead of starting with the crab stuffing. Also, when the meat is finished and you return the sauce, mushrooms & Dijon mustard to the pan, it will take another 20 + minutes to thicken. I just added a little cornstarch! This is an excellent recipe that I will use over and over, when I have extra time! I also added Shrimp in with the crab mixture. Also, I only made two steaks but made the full amount of sauce for 4 steaks....We each had just the right amount of sauce, if you want more, double the sauce recipe.

I stumbled across this and made it for my wife on her birthday.  Home run!  She'll now be dissappointed if I don't make it for her birthday.  I had to leave work early to prepare it, but it was well worth the effort.  Easily our favorite, despite the three hours to prepare it.  Suggestion:  Double the reduction...there never seems to be enough!  Also substitued shittake mushrooms instead of crimi for a more bold flavor...turned out great!

This is a fantastic recipe! It takes a while to make, but it's worth it. I find that using the juice from the canned crab meat works instead of the water or shrimp stock as well. I also use Brandy instead of Whiskey. I'm not much of a whiskey fan, and I find the brandy has wonderful flavor that compiments this sauce well.

This was a great as a Valentine's Day dinner for two, or for any special occasion.  Recommend starting the sauces well in advance for a good reduction.

A great way to prepare filets!  This sauce is absolutely delicious.  Like others I skipped the stuffing and opted to serve on mashed potatos with roasted asparagus.  The sauce worked with everything and there was plenty.  Great recipe to entertain with, you can do the sauce ahead and grill the filets for minimal clean-up.  Terrific!

Very time consuming. If I were to make this again, I would forget about the crab stuffing. Cooked in the skilled and finished on the grill. The sauce was great and would make that again to use on any kind of steak. I think it would also be fine without the mushrooms.

This recipe is spectacularly good.  The flavor in the sauce rivals any I've had at high end steakhouses.  I agree with a number of the other reviewers that you should allow yourself PLENTY of time for this recipe. It took me just under 3 hours.  I think prepping the ingredients the day before for the crab stuffing might help.  Prepare for the cream sauce to cook down slowly; it took over 40 minutes on my stove.  All that aside, fabulous and will definitely make it again!

I agree with the other reviews, awesome, awesome, awesome meal! Restaurant quality, but I am so tired after making this meal. I would buy all the ingredients already minced, and I personally would skip the mushrooms. I also made potatoes and asparagus to go with it. Tasted great! I used J.Daniels for the whiskey.  I was confused about cooking the filet, but I placed it in the skillet and turned it over about three times and then placed it in a 350 degree oven for about ten minutes. Turned out perfectly medium. Put the thick cut bacon in the oven on 450 for about ten minutes, keeps it's shape better in the oven when you cook it what way. My filets were about 3 inches thick, so adjust time accordingly. Great, great recipe, terrible to make on a work night :(

I made this for Valentine's last night and it was amazing! The only thing that didn't go quite right was that my sauce did not thicken as much as I expected it to.  Also, I thought the pepper taste was a little overpowering; maybe next time I wouldn't put any extra pepper on the steaks for seasoning because the sauce adds plenty of flavor. Nevertheless, it was a delicious and very special meal.

Didn't use the crab stuffing.  Made the sauce and an onion and mushroom dish in the morning and brought everything to my daughter's home to cook for her birthday.  Used Glenlivet scotch whiskey and chopped rather than sliced the mushrooms in the sauce.  I seared the steaks in the frying pan then put them in the oven for 14-15 minutes at 350.  Came out perfectly cooked and so tender.  My idea was to put the mushroom/onion over the filet mignon and the sauce on top of that.  Unfortunately, I put the mushroom/onion dish in my 2nd fridge and forgot to bring it to my daughter's.  Oh well, still had the potatoes, salad and bisquits to serve with the steak. My daughter commented that the steak and sauce would be something you found in a 5 star restaurant.  So good!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  Will be making it again.

Tasty- but very rich. If you like to cook- it's really not that time consuming provided you are well organized. Start the sauce first and as you finish up with the sides- the sauce is done. I seared the filets on both sides and then baked them in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes. I substituted portobellos for the crimini mushrooms and it was great. I served this with pan fried sweet potatoes and a nice romaine salad dressed with balsmaic vinigrette and olive oil. I wouldn't double the stuffing- less is definitely more in this case. A great meal and much less than what you would pay for at a restaurant!

This rate is only based on the steak sauce! It is fabulous! I make it for any steak that we have on hand. It makes even the cheaper steaks taste really good!

This is unbelievable.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception that I stuffed sirloin instead of filet.  It was incredibly good.  In fact, the sauce is so amazing that the crabmeat doesn't really add much.  Next time I will leave the crab out.

I used a small skillet in both places where the recipe specifies a large skillet and was happy that I did.

My husband and I both give this recipe 5 stars.  The first time I made it was without mushrooms (I don't like them) and was pretty good.  I just made it a second time, this time with baby bella mushrooms to see which way is better.  It was wonderful.  I did skip the bacon this time because it is rich enough without it.  I loved the stuffing and sauce and can't wait to make it again.  I will never make a filet mignon another way.

This recipe is one of my family's favorites!  We don't bother with the crabmeat stuffing anymore, if I did, I'd probably cut the breadcrumbs by half.  But the whiskey peppercorn sauce is out of this world.  I slice the filets after cooking, and lay them across some rice, and pour the sauce over top.  I love it.

First of all I did not make the crab stuffing part of this recipe. That being said the steak and sauce was phenomenal. I don't ever want to eat steak with out the peppercorn sauce again! You have to be very careful with the sauce I found however because if you cook it for to long it's starts to get very liquidly.

Very Yummy!  I wouldn't omit crab stuffing! The crab gave it a nice sweet taste while the sauce was just perfect - which I double because of other reviews saying is was so good... and they were right. You can use this with any type of boneless steak. What a wonderful birthday dinner for my husband who is a HUGE steak fan. Thanks!

Fantastic!  Maybe I'm more comfortable in a kitchen than some but I couldn't figure out what all the whining was about regarding the prep for this dish.  Sure you have to chop up a bunch of stuff but once that's done, everything goes together easily. I started the sauce while the stuffing was cooking and everything was set when the steaks were ready to be stuffed and sauted. We've even prepared this dish ahead of time (all except cooking the meat) and brought it over to a friend's house and completed it there.  

The stuffing was great and the whikey peppercorn sauce was incredible.  My husband lurked around the kitchen and could not believe there were no mushrooms in the sauce as it was reducing.  It smelled great and tasted even better.

My only advice is to precook the bacon for a few minutes (4-5)in the microwave to prevent it from being soggy if you're cooking the filets to medium rare.

First let me say I rarely give a 5 star.  Second I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I grilled Porterhouse steaks and placed the sauce into the mushroom mix and placed on the steak.  Not bad but a little peppery.  The sauce took right at an hour to reduce and make.  Overall, a pretty nice recipe.  Thanks!

OMG! This is amazing. If making it for a dinner party my advice is start early. Have all ingredients pre-chopped and ready to go. For the crab stuffing I used Old Bay Seasoning. (not the Cajun)  It's a seasoning used for seafood in MD, it's great. For the reduction stage of the sauce - be patient, don't rush it.  I stirred for 1 hr  & 15 min. Grab a book it helps pass the time. The steaks cooked perfectly, and the sauce was delicious. Everyone really enjoyed this dish. Well worth all the work, just wish there wasn't so many calories in it!

DELICIOUS!  This has become an eagerly anticipated semi-annual tradition at our home! It IS time consuming, but a lot of the prep can easily be done in advance.  I prepared it in addition to the "traditional holiday ham" for 22 guests last Christmas - AND EVERYONE LOVED IT!  I also serve it at least once during hunting season.  I've neglected to note that I usually subsitute quality, grain-fed venison tenderloin for the filet mignon, but I realize venison taste and quality varies greatly from one area to another.  When preparing this I use heavy whipping cream (rather than half & half), fresh cracked peppercorns, and quality peppered bacon.  Make sure you use a cajun seasoning you're familiar with - not too salty as with my first try. I too usually finish the filets on the grill (well worth the extra effort)and I always double the sauce - it's so good!

Sorry but this was not liked at my house by 4 people.  I will never again wrap filet mignon in bacon (made it taste like ham instead of steak) This was very expensive too make because I used real crab too (didn't even taste it because the bacon flavor and sauce)  Will not make again.  The stuffing I will though.

Do not, repeat, DO NOT, attempt to make this for the first time BY YOURSELF for a dinner party, especially for your future in-laws.  It really is time-consuming, and unless you have all ingredients on hand and ready to prep, plus about 3 hours to pull it all together, you're going to feel like you've gotten in over your head.
I would have given this 1 star, except for the fact the the sauce was indeed very flavourful.  The sauce, however, was the main thing holding me up (the other reviewers that complained about the reducing time taking so long were right).  I used cornstarch in a feeble attempt to thicken it, but stopped after 2 tbs. because I was afraid of what the taste/texture would be.  
I was too tired to enjoy the meal once it was finally done.  Everyone said that they liked it, but I wasn't sure if they were just feeling sorry for me because they saw what I went through, or if they were really telling the truth.  Bottom line is, make sure you have a friend or significant other helping you with the prep of this dish and anything else that is to accompany it, because there's nothing worse than finally getting it done and thinking, "oh no, I forgot to do a salad and a side dish."  There's no way you're going to be able to keep those steaks warm and tender and not have to serve them with a chainsaw.  Good luck to all who make this...I won't be making it again.

SAUCE ONLY REVIEW: Fantastic! Super-tasty! I never could get the finished sauce to reduce to 1 cup, so I turned up the heat & added about 3T cornstarch to thicken it up. It was GREAT! I also sauteed 8oz of fresh sliced mushrooms in 5T butter & 2t minced onion. When the mushrooms were tender, I added them to the sauce. It was simply fabulous! I topped some steaks with the sauce and my husband loved it. This sauce would be wonderful on fish or chicken too!

The whiskey peppercorn sauce is awesome!  I used what I had on hand - a nice thick sirloin in place of the filets and skipped the crab stuffing and mushroom mixture and it was fantastic!  I used a little corn starch to speed up the thickening of the sauce at the end.  The way I prepared it only took about 30 minutes!  I will make this a regular and will add the mushroom mixture the next time.  Thanks Sue Z. for a wonderful, divine recipe!!

Absolutely amazing. I made it last night, using two 6 oz. filets that I stuffed with the crab mixture. I made the full amount of stuffing, but it was more than I needed for two filets. I'd say it's the perfect amount for three well-filled filets, but you could stretch it to fill four filets. We ate the extra in the bowl. It was that delicious. I started the sauce early, since I read that it takes a while to reduce. So it worked perfectly. The sauce was ready the same time that the filets were done. About 45 minutes from start to finish, but not labor intensive. I made our other dishes while the sauce was reducing. Really delicious with a wonderful sauce.

Wow!  Company worthy and restaurant quality.  We did not do the crab stuffing as we enjoy filet and did not want to detract from the beef.  Yes, the sauce takes a while to make, but there is no need to reduce the broth and pepper over med stirring constantly>>> I boiled it down on high in a minute or 2.  But before you put the cream in let it cool a minute, and that's when you need to take your time.  We enjoy mushrooms with our steak and doubled the mushroom mixture>> can't imagine it would be enuf otherwise!!(used button mushrooms) and surprisingly I did not need to double the sauce.  I'm surprised there were no instructions on actually cooking the filet.  I used a piping hot cast iron skillet it to sear it (same one I did the mushrooms in), reduced heat a little and cooked til desired doneness (a couple we put under the broiler).  Served with asparagus.  Outstanding, will make this again and again.

We had this same recipe last year in Dublin at a Restaurant called the Lobster Pot, being from Maine we skipped the Lobster and went for the steak, having for two weeks indulged ourselves with the finest seafood in the world....bar none, Ireland is tops for all things coming out of the ocean.  
This dish does have a lot of steps and ingredients but if your fixing it for company you can do everything ahead of time and put it in holding pattern.....till it's time to sear the steaks, which really goes fast. This dish may also be fixed with a top-grade sirloin like they do in Ireland, but be aware their restaurant grade sirloin is far superior to ours, so buy the best or stick to a filet mignon tucking a scant teaspoon of frozen butter in with the crabmeat.  This is absolutely my favorite meat dish...decadent!  It is so rich, avoid the temptation of having rich side dishes, herbed/buttered string beans and a pretty salad w/pears/currents/chevre with a dash of Cherry Basalmic....oh my!

This recipe is phenomenal!  I reserve it for special occasions only, as it does take some time.  The crab stuffing is great, but i prefer to put it on top of the steaks and drizzle everything with the sauce before serving.  I also suggest partially cooking the bacon before attaching it to the steaks, it just makes it a bit crisper at the end. The sauce does take a while to simmer down, but if you start it first, and let it go while you do the rest of your cooking and prep work, its not so time consuming.  During the final simmer, just keep your steaks warm and get your vegetable side or salad ready, then it doesn't feel like it took forever. I like to serve it with mashed potatoes to soak up any leftover sauce on the plate! Wonderful dish, I highly recommend it, especially if your trying to impress!

I made this recipe just as Sue wrote it and found it to be perfect! If there was alot of prepping, I never noticed! It was well worth any time I put into making it. I made this as a special dish for my husband for Valentine's Day. It was outstanding! My husband loved it! I will make this again and again. Thank you for a keeper recipe!

Sooooo gooood!  My husband loves this so much.  I don't do seafood so I had my steak without the crab stuffing and it was very good.  It was a very special romantic dinner and I couldn't have chosen a better meal for him.  I will definately be fixing this for him again and again.  I didn't think it was to time consuming to make, but then again, I love to cook.

i have prepared this dish for years.  we have a large family and i cook alot.  my 5 boys can't get enough of this and it always ends up the birthday request meal.  although time consuming - this is more than worth the effort.  since you will be stuck in the kitchen anyway, don't use canned crab.  large chunks of king crab legs make it that much more special and eliminates the salty/fishy flavor some have mentioned.  the sauce - by far - the most outstanding.  make this!

A few things about this recipe, parts of it are delicious but very time consuming. I made this for my husband and I on Valentines day thinking it would be a nice dinner. I think it took 2 1/2 hours to complete. My husband enjoyed it, but I didn't as much. I thought there were too many flavors for this dish. If you decide to make this dish, I recommend skipping the crab stuffing. I LOVED the whiskey sauce reduction, but the crab stuffing overpowered the rest of the delicious flavors (in my opinion.) I also recommend skipping the bacon wrapping, unless your meat isn't as nice of a cut. I feel this was an unnecessary use of calories as the whiskey peppercorn sauce has enough flavor on its own! In any case, just know that it takes more time than it says.

tasteful - next time I wouldn't stuff with the crab though. Maybe just put it on top of the meat unless you like your meat well done. We are rare - medium rare people and the blood just sat on top of the crabmeat.  The sauce was excellent. Would make this one again.

SAUCE REVIEW ONLY: Yes, it takes a long time, but it is not involved. It really is worth it, great sauce! I prepared it for Valentine's Day for my husband and served with a Filet Mignon, Roasted Asparagus, Baked Potato, and Crab Cakes (I opted to make a different Crab Cake recipe to serve verses stuffing the steak with the Crab Stuffing). Next time I will prepare the sauce with a Boneless Ribeye as the Filet Mignon isn't what makes it special. You really should try the sauce recipe, you won't be disappointed. Just allow at least 2 1/2 hours for it to do its thing. And I did heed warnings and used lower sodium Beef Broth. Was a good idea indeed.

amazing! i made this for valentines dinner, and my boyfriend loved it so much he nearly proposed lol.   the only thing i did differently was to deglaze the pan with two parts beef broth, one part whiskey. it gave it a bit more of a nicely salty flavor without overdoing it with the alcohol.   i served it with roasted red potatoes and asparagus. it was sooo good. we about licked the sauce off our plates it was that tasty lol.  def. a keeper.

This was absolutely delicious! The whiskey sauce is to die for! I will however use the author's tip of browning first and then finishing off on the grill the next time. It was hard to tell when they were finished by cooking completely in the pan on the stove. Also next time I will use reduced sodium beef broth as it did seem too salty and use more mushrooms.

YUM!  Not sure where to start with this one really.  It was all great, the sauce is incredible, the crab stuffing was amazing, and put it all together and you end up with one fan-tab-ulous dish!  I would say, as others have noted, that you do not need the crab stuffing to "make" this.  The star really is the sauce.  I did not use bacon, even though I love bacon...just thought it was rich enough and not neccessary.  Did follow one reviewers though on preparing the sauce well in advance and letting it sit to thicken.  As it was doing this, I did add butter to sauce which seemed to add to the richness.  There are a dozen different things to use this sauce for and just as many ways to change around the prep of the dish and how you serve it.  With or without bacon, with or without the crab stuffing, and so on.  Another thing I did, was seared the filet in hot pan then finished off in the oven.  As I said, I made th esauce in advance and in that I left the shallots and mushrooms.  Did not take long to prepare or put on the table and hubby said it was way better than anything we could have ordered out.  ENJOY!!

I read some of the other reviews EVEN BEFORE I made it and I should have heeded. The crab is just overkill for an otherwise perfect dish.  We had steamed broccoli and a parmesan risotto with ours. I will definetly take the time to make this again.  BTW you should double the sauce recipe if you cut out the crab.  Very rich and decadent but fabulous!

This is one of the best steaks I have ever had! All 12 guests have requested the recipe and said that it was the  "best steak they had in years!" Here is what I did different and recommend:  I subtituted lobster for crab. I used two large tails which was plenty for the 12 filets. I also used butter and olive oil to saute the lobster stuffing. The sauce does take forever to reduce and thicken so in the future I will make earlier in the day. I didn't wrap the steaks with bacon since I realized that I didn't have enough on hand and don't feel that it was missed at all. Between the richness of the sauce and the lobster stuffing you don't need the bacon. I also modified the sauce and served it as is at the end of the 2nd step ( I omitted the last step of adding mushrooms,etc. as my husband doesn't like them.)  Instead, I  sauteed an assortment of wild mushrooms in butter, wine and thyme and served this as a sidedish.  It was so fabulous that I am making it again on Christmas Day!!

I first tried this recipe two years ago and it's become a favorite in my house since then. My dad hates anything seafood or pig, so I skipped the crab stuffing and the bacon strips. It never takes me very long without those steps and the taste is absolutely phenomenal - people have eaten it off of the table after spilling. : )

I can't even begin to describe it. Cooked as ordered, but in a little different order for times sake. Maybe an hour total cooking and prep by this order: sauce, stuffing, steak. It takes awhile to reduce the sauce right, but what a difference.  Hands down, this is the best thing I have ever cooked.

for the meat we skipped all of thise prep- we sprinkled Montreal steak seasoning and wrapped in bacon and then BBQed.  Made the crab mixture as described (from fresh crab legs) and served on top with sauce but had to thicken with flour .  Very good -  but it was lots of work

This came out very salty for me. So much so, I couldn't even taste the stuffing in the meat. If I make it again, I will try a low-sodium broth. Thanks.

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  I agree with the last review that a good filet should be able to stand alone without a heavy sauce.  That being said though, if you're looking for a little something extra, this is it!  Worth the extra work and just as good as many of the 5 star restaurant steaks I've eaten! I usually skip the crab stuffing and just make crab cakes with it to accompany the steak or skip that part alltogether.

4.5 stars...  While the crab mixture was tasty, I just don't think it was necessary to stuff the filets with it.  My guests didn't really taste it - I think it would be better on the side or crab cake style.  I cooked the bacon 2 minutes, wrapped around the filet and threw on the grill 8 min. each side.  I doubled the sauce, let it reduce almost 2 hours... it was fantastic.  I think I put a little too much dijon in, but my guests were in awe of it.  Yes, its time consuming... but just start the sauce and while that is reducing, do the rest.  You can pre-stuff the filet, and get all your side dishes done in that waiting period and it really isn't too bad.  Once you make it once, you'll realize you can work around it.  Happy eating!

Fabulous!!  Although I would cut the amount of beef broth by 1/3 and thin later if necessary. But was a wonderful meal. The crab stuffing great I used lump crabmeat NO IMITATION CRAB. I will make again. Be sure filets are good and thick.

My whole family loved this dish! I started the sauce way before hand as suggested which worked out great! I didn't stuff the filets because some people in home do not like seafood of any kind, but I made the stuffing and put it on top of the filets and broiled it for a minute just to heat the crab a little bit more. This dish was the best thing I have ever cooked!! Thank you for sharing it.

This recipe is excellent!  I've made it both with single filet mignon steaks as well as a full filet mignon.  I bake it in the oven instead of the stovetop and it works perfectly everytime.  I let the sauce simmer for close to an hour and it gives me the perfect thickness.  Thanks for sharing!

Recipe is wonderful, but rather than the complicated crab stuffing, I used jumbo lump backfin crab meat placed on top of cooked filet, then the peppercorn sauce, which I made ahead of time and reheated.
I feel keeping the ingredients true to themself enhances any recipe.  Why take wonderful flavors and add bread crumbs?

This is amazing!  My favorite part of it was the peppercorn sauce.  Next time I am going to skip the crab stuffing, and just have the steak with the sauce and lots of good bread to soak it up!!!

Very good recipe.  Took less than 2 hours from start to finish.  Start the sauce first before anything so that it has time to reduce down (took me about an hour).  If I were to make it again, which I'm sure I will for a special night, I will stuff the meat with the crab mixture the day before and keep in the fridge.  That way, all I will need to do is make the sauce and whatever else to go with dinner and not have so much work to do in one night.  Thanks for the great recipe!! Glad I tried it!!!

This was, quite simply, superb. I made the dish for a special occasion, and gave myself plenty of time to complete it, since I had read so many reviews that were critical of the time required. I think if you accept that it's time consuming right from the start, you'll be better able to appreciate it. I substituted shiitake mushrooms for crimini, because the crimini were unavailable, and I followed other suggestions to increase the amount of crab stuffing, using fresh (rather than canned) crab. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. My guests were astonished at the quality of the meal.

I will make this again, when I have the time and a good reason.

Thanks!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!  I love it and so did all my guests.  I did make a few adjustments…I left out the Cajun seasoning because I don’t like spicy ingredients.  I also slightly cooked the bacon before wrapping it around the filets.  I will definitely be making this again!!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he was floored. This recipe truly rivals any four-star restaurant's best offering. I would advise against making the sauce the day before, however. By the time I used it the next day, it had separated a little. Fabulous recipe!

I found this recipe VERY time consuming but it's EXCELLENT. At the end I got bored and added cornstarch to the sauce instead of bringing it down to a cup and I used shrimp instead of crab. I also chopped the mushrooms and used a little extra. My hubby loved it!! I may cook it again if I had a full day to cook.

as a second option add Dijon mustard to taste along with fresh sliced mushrooms,add mushrooms just prior to service,the residual heat will cook the mushrooms perfectly.

I used rum instead of whisky for taste preference, so this likely could have been a 4 star recipe if I had used the whisky instead (taste might have become palatable with cooking - who knows?)

It was quite tasty overall, but not as good as I was expecting. With all the work involved, I probably won't make this recipe again. Perhaps some alterations, such adding the mustard right at the end to keep the flavour sharp, or making a sauce with lump crab meat and serving it on top of steak. And more flavour in the sauce.

Yep.  Well worth it.  Buy the best cut of meat possible.  Sauce was fantastic.  Think I'll forgo the bacon next time.  Crab stuffing was great.  I put it on top instead of stuffing and grilled the filets instead of doing them in the skillet.

Amazing.  The mushroom sauce was unbelievable.  It did take a long time to reduce but it was well worth it.  There was almost too much going on, with the crab stuffing and the bacon wrapped around it.  It would be just as great with a simple steak and the sauce.  I did everything exactly like it is written but I used two 8 oz filets and stuffed them with more of the crab filling.

I hate to give 2 stars..... But.. I followed the recipe as is. The bacon surely needs to be cooked prior to wrapping around the steak (otherwise it won't be cooked at all)... I LOVE steak and seafood... We bought really nice filets and couldn't even taste the flavor of the meat because it was so ovewhlemed with the sauce & stuffing. The stuffing doesn't even have crab taste to it. This was a great idea, but didn't pan out well for a couple who LOVE the flavor of a good steak and fresh crab meat...

The peppercorn sauce is WONDERFUL!! The filet is the sauce delivery device and the stuffing is the icing. I sopped up the last bit of sauce in the pan with a slice of bread it is that yummy!

This took me just less than an hour but it is a recipe for females as you certainly need to be able to multitask. The verdict was ....... gorgeous. All the tastes were divine. I think the pepper sauce was the classiest bit. My first time making a pepper sauce...... so proud!

Wow!!! I made this on Valentine's Day and I'm pretty sure my fiance fell in love with me all over again after taking a bite of this. We're not fans of mushrooms so I didn't include those and also didn't add the bacon. Didn't think it was necessary with such a great cut of meat. Thanks for submitting SUEZINOHIO! You may have very well improved my relationship :-)

My husband and I loved this recipe.  It does take a while to prepare everything but that is to be expected.  I would suggest to start the sauce first to allow time for it to cook down.  I didn't reduce it as much as the recipe suggested, I used cornstarch to thicken it.  We also did not fry the steaks, we grilled them.  This was melt in your mouth delicious!

Excellent dish!  The preparation does take a while so do heed the suggestions from others to get all the ingredients ready before cooking.  This means chop and pour everything you need to and set them aside before you proceed to cooking.  One reviewer said you can do it all in 40 mins.  I found that to be realistically impossible.  Give yourself about 1.5 hours.  I found it useful to start with the pepper corn sauce first, let it simmer while preparing the crab stuffing.  My steaks were thick so after searing for 10-15 min on the cast iron skillet, I placed the skillet containing the steaks  in the oven for another 7-10 min to allow the meat to cook through.  If you the meat medium rare like I do, you'll find some pink blood draining from the meat.  Don't worry about this because it will be masked by the peppercorn sauce.  I served the dish with brussel sprouts and red potatoes lightly stirred fried with a little butter and garlic.  It's an excellent dish and well worth your time!

Made this one for Valentines dinner and it turned out beautifully.  Made it almost exactly as the recipe called for.  I used strip steaks rather than filet mignon.  Some reviews made me think this was going to be really challenging, but it was just involved.  I would recommend doing all your chopping and prep first, then start the sauce.  While the sauce is reducing, make up the crab stuffing.  Also, if you make the sauce in a skillet rather than a saucepan, it will reduce quicker.    If you have to impress someone, this is the recipe to use!

I made this recipe for a very special occasion.  It was worth every minute. I tripled the recipe for 12 filets and didn't waiver a bit on the instructions.  I took into consideration other comments and prepared my kitchen for the task.  With a little multi tasking the meal with 12 baked potatoes, an asparagus side with an appetizer of fresh tomatoes mozzarella topped with balsamic glaze was prepared in under two hours. It is important to start with the sauce first if time is of the essence. Our guest loved it and were delighted to find the crab.

I made this for my hubby as he really enjoyed the crab stuffed steak at Longhorn Steak house. I followed the recipe exactly and cooked the steak partially in the pan and partially on the grill.  We both thought the flavor was great but a little salty (and we normally like salt).  Not sure how to cut it down for next time other than rinsing the crab meat first or cutting the cajun seasoning in half.  I didn't salt and pepper the steaks prior to cooking them since I knew we'd be putting sauce on them!  Not terribly time consuming but was in the kitchen for about 1 hour and 45 min. from start to finish and I cook a lot!!  Definately a make again with a few tweaks to try to eliminate some salt!

Amazing, easily among the best dishes I've made. Took a little over an hour to prep and cook, and I'm somewhat of a novice when it comes to cooking, so ignore the reviewer that claimed it took over 3 hours. Smaller filets work best since this is a super filing dish! Thanks again for posting!

This rating is for the sauce alone, very creamy and complements the streak well. I served it with filet mignon but did not follow this recipe with the crab stuffing, sounds good though.

This was amazing, I made it for my boyfriend on his birthday and he said it was the best meal ever. I used filet mignon which are always good on their own but I didn't end up using the crab stuffing after all, I tasted it before I stuffed the steaks and didn't really like it enough to put into such a nice steak. It wasn't missed because of how delicious the sauce was.

The sauce was the best part of this, my only problem was the garlic cooked too much, next time I'll be really careful with the garlic in the pan..  after you cook the garlic and then add mushrooms, and then the steak, the garlic ended up black before I could deglaze the pan. I think it was my mistake but it happened so fast. I would also recommend to half-cook the bacon before you wrap it around the steak if you like it crisped, it was kind of chewy because it didn't get to cook very long in the pan (I like my steak medium rare to rare, so the cook time was only about 7 minutes)

All in all it was delicious, this recipe is time consuming so I prepared caesar salad and double stuffed baked potatoes earlier in the day, which helped a lot time-wise

Made this for my husband for father's day, and he said it was better than ANY filet mignon he's ever had at any steak restaurant.  It truly was an amazing dish.  You will not be disappointed.  I prepared garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus to go with it.  Also, it may take longer than the 1 hour 30 minutes from start to finish.  It took me 2 hours, but I think it's because I had to cook the steaks a little longer because they were so thick.

AMAZING - but for sure cook the bacon a little before wrapping...even though it shrinks it. It was a little chewy for me...and the stuffing was pretty good, but i'm still rating this a 5 since my crab meat was a couple days old.

This is a spectacular recipe.    I followed the recipe "to the letter" and I was very happy with the result.    The whiskey peppercorn sauce was incredible.   Of course, it is essential to start with a really good cut of filet mignon.    If you can't get a superior cut of meat, don't waste your time with this recipe.  Next time, I will make this without the crab stuffing.    I will cook just the filet mignon (and the bacon) and the whiskey peppercorn sauce.      The crab adds something to the recipe - but not much.    I may even like it better without the crab.

The sauce is wonderful. I thought the crab stuffing was way to salty. Next time I will put a very thin layer in between the steaks.

DH is allergic to crab but we made the sauce and it is amazing. We serve it with beef on a regular basis and get raves from all who partake. Thanks for a simple to make yet very flavorful sauce.

I made this for a Valentine's Day dinner. I didn't do the crab stuffing or wrap it in bacon but this was still amazing! We were only making 2 steaks and with the other things going on didn't bother to cut the amount of sauce to make but we used it all up anyway. And I HATE mushrooms. That alone deserves 5 stars. I will definitely make again for special occasions and will try the crab stuffing next time.

This tasted fine but it was nothing special. It's not as time consuming as other reviewers stated, but still not worth the time.

I wasn't really crazy about this receipe. I made as is, but had a tough time frying the filets to the doneness that my husband likes. Next time, I will prepare the sauce, make crab cakes and cook my steaks like I normally do.

very good.  I left out the crab stuffing.  I seared my filets on the stove then baked at 350 for 15 minutes.  Next time I will bake them alittle less  they came out medium well.  I would have preferred medium.  THe sauce was very good.  I did have to thicken it with corn starch at the end.  I will defintly make this again

As so many others have said - this sauce is to die for, one of the best sauces I've ever had. I did most of the prep the day before so it didn't seem to take so long for the sauce.  The filets turned out perfect and the crab stuffing gave it that restaurant quality. I fixed this for valentines day and could not have asked for a better main course. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is delicious. I used jameson whiskey for the sauce, and it would be great on any cut of steak. The crab stuffing is tasty and would be great as it's own dish, or made with shrimp instead.  I served with roasted red potatoes and lemon spritzed steamed broccoli. Will definitely make this one again!

I know it's been said - but this sauce is to die for!! Yummm! Great dinner for entertaining in the kitchen - I had one prepare the crab stuffing - excellent on it's own! one guest prepped the steaks (I used the eye of ribeye's to save a little $$) and one made the sauce. A wonderful dinner party that took 2 1/2 hours to do - but worth every bite! Thanks for sharing!

Review for sauce and filet:  It was delicious. I doubled the sauce like the other reviews said. Next time I may use a light cream instead of heavy cream. It does take awhile, but I knew that going in so it really didn't bother me.  It's not a budget friendly meal, but the title says it has crab and filet so I prepared myself for that as well.  I did use crab in the dish, but I didn't make the crab stuffing.  I just put chunks of crab directly into the sauce then served the crab and sauce directly on top of the filet. I can't wait to make this dish again!

I have made this recipe twice (Christmas Day) and it turned out fabulous every time. I changed one thing - I made the whiskey peppercorn sauce the day before and reheated. Maybe for some of the experts, this is a no-no but it saved a huge amount of time and I got to enjoy the day much more.

A bit disappointed. Maybe I was expecting to much...considering how time consuming it was. The sauce was very tasty, but it took far to much time waiting for half of it to boil down. My husband loves steak...and whiskey too...but this recipe was not a winner. He said..."A good steak such as a filet (prepared correctly) should not be covered in a sauce." I have to agree.You would be better off buying a NY strip or cheaper steak to make this. This recipe is worth trying at least once. But savor the flavor of a tender filet and don't waste it by covering it up with a heavy sauce.

AMAZING!  Great for impressing someone special!  So much flavor and if you follow some of the other tips on how to make this recipe go a little faster, check out some of the other comments... like start the sauce first.  Those of you out there that are unhappy with prep time on some of these recipes do to all the chopping, you need to get one of those handhelp rotating choppers that are sold by pampered chef.  I have also seen them at bed, bath, and beyond.  Sooooo much quicker than by hand!  Will definatley make this again!

This recipe is all about the sauce... I made this as a special treat for father's day for my husband, Dad and brother.  They all agreed that the sauce was delicious.  I did not really need to add the crab in the middle.  Also, a like others said a cheaper cut of meat would be fine..  Next time I would not add the crab, get a different cut of meat and use a low sodium broth for the sauce because of the salt content.  Overall a great and different recipe... You need to have time to make the peppercorn sauce.

Made for Valentines day. Listened to the reviews and did the prep work ahead of time and started the sauce right at the beginning to let it simmer down. Really great. Will make the sauce again.

Excellent and easy. I halved the recipe and the total time was maybe 45 minutes. Hubby loved it. Only suggestion is use low sodium beef broth, a little too salty, but overall it was awesome.

This is one of the best recipes I've found to date on this website. Everyone simply raved about how good it was. I made a few variations, and for what i was doing with this dish, they worked very well.

Instead of stuffing the filet, I tripled the amount of bread crumbs for the crab stuffing and made crab cakes, instead. 

Didn't wrap the filets in bacon, and left out the mushrooms. I Added around 2 ounces of honey to the sauce, which gave it a very smooth, sweet flavor that went very well with the dish as a whole. (I wasnt as happy with my first batch of sauce, without the honey.)

All in all an amazing recipe!

This was AMAZING!! Thank you so much.
I did skip the bacon because I forgot to thaw it, but I can not imagine it needing anything else. The wiskey sauce I suggest doubling because everyone will want extra.

I had no problems making this sauce. Some of the reviews led me to believe it would be difficult. I would make this again. The only change I made is with the stuffing. I purchased crab cakes and topped the beef with them instead of stuffing. It was so good and a lot less work then assembling this.

Wow, this was so amazing.  I can still taste the sauce as I am writing this.  I noticed other reviewers said that the sauce would never thicken up - so I used Beef Consumme instead of Beef Broth for the sauce.  It is the same thing, it's just already thickened.  This worked perfectly and if you cook the sauce long enough, it does definately thicken up.  I cooked mine for about 40 minutes.  Also, the recipe is very time consuming if you do it all in one shot.  I would recommend stuffing the filets the night before.  I used 2 king crab legs - and it was a perfect amount of crab.  Also microwave your bacon for a couple minutes before putting on the steak so it's completely done.  Wow, I can't wait to have company over so I can make this again.

This is delicious.  We will save this one though for special dinners as it is also expensive.  My family loved the sauce so much they poured it over everything on their plate.  This does take quite a bit of time to prepare, but definitely worth the time and effort

I decided on this recipe for my boyfriends special birthday dinner, I did find it took a bit of time, but I did expect that, and in the end, it was all worth the effort!! I always pre-measure and pre-chop everything, so cook time wasnt too bad, just had to keep popping into the kitchen to stir.My boyfriend said it was the best meal he has ever had!! These steaks definitely top anything we have ever had in any fine dining restaurant. I will definitely make again!!
Revision: June 20/10 - This has become my boyfriends requested meal for special occasions, the revisions I have made in the several times I have made it are as follows... I buy my filets from M&M meat shops, they come in various sizes and are already bacon wrapped. I stuff with straight crab meat, you wont know the difference and it cuts down on the amount of work to do, and lastly I make sure to start the whiskey-peppercorn sauce an hour before I plan on cooking, because the sauce takes a long time to reduce and thicken to the proper consistancy.

I only wanted the Whiskey Peppercorn Sauce. It was delicious. It takes a while to thicken. If you add a tbsp. of corn starch it thickens faster without changing the flavor.

Absolutely wonderful! I make this for special occasions, and it is a huge hit every time. The sauce is to die for!

I do leave out the stock from the stuffing, which helps cut down on the mushiness.

The sauce itself is the real seller here.  If you don't want to spend money on the filets and crab, just make the sauce and serve with less expensive steaks. The whiskey peppercorn sauce really dresses up any cut!

I think this dish is what convinced my now husband to propose to me!!!  I used good lump crab meat, not claw...the sauce was to die for!  This is definitely the perfect meal for a nice romantic dinner...but it does take some time to prepare, but sooooo worth it!

This recipe is absolutely delicious, but save for a special occasion or when you have plenty of time, as this is not a quick-fix recipe. Personally, I think the sauce is the best part, so I might skip the stuffing next time.

This recipe was great for the most part. The whiskey peppercorn sauce was so amazing. I am very new to the kitchen but did not have a hard time getting the sauce to thicken like others complained about. I personally did not care too much for the crab stuffing and thought it was a tedious detail that I will leave out next time. Also, I omitted the mushrooms (because i don't like them) , the bacon (to eliminate some of the fat) and the whiskey (we were out). Will definitely make the sauce again, would be excellent on any steak and many meats.

I recently made this dish for my husband on Valentines day and it was absolutely gorgeous! It took alot longer than an hour and a half but I had planned for that.  Definately a special occation meal as it was time consuming and not very budget friendly, but well worth it for something special. Very tasty.

Huband gives it a 5 I give it a 3, that is why it gets a 4 total.  Peppercorn sauce is good, but still lacks a little, the stuffing is good by itself, a little off with the sauce.

I made this for my partner & I on Valentines day, and i have to say this is the best Steak recipe i have ever tasted, just as good as a top restaurant. It's not something i'd make as an everyday meal - just for special occassions, as it's very time consuming and not practical with 3 children - and 1 on the way. The crab stuffing was gorgeous, melt in the mouth. I used fresh crab, as we live by the sea and is picked fresh everyday. The way the recipe explained how to cook the steak was perfect for my partner, as he likes his steak medium rare, but for me (especially as i'm pregnant) i had to cook mine for longer. I'd give this recipe 10/10 and have kept a copy in my recipe book for another special occasion - maybe i'll get my partner to make it for me for mothers day - that's if he's not too busy at work!!

If 5 stars is all I can give, then 5 stars it is.  2 years ago, at 55, I married my high school sweetheart.  After finding this recipe, I wanted to surprise him with it, but knew it would take two of us to prepare.  (That made it all the more fun!)  The sauce will be excellent on other meats as well.  At $21 a pound for filet mignon, the meat manager at Hy-Vee suggested a thick top surloin.  We seared it a little in a pan, then stuffed it and finished on the grill.  My grandma taught me how to thicken "things" in a hurry with cornstartch; worked like a charm!!!

I did not find the stuffing part tedious but did not feel the the stuffing really added much to the finished steaks.  Like another reviewer I used excellent fliet mignons from Costco.  One of my guests thought that I had stuffed them with cream cheese.  The suace is wonderful and even the "picky" eaters loved the fork-tender steaks and complimneted the sauce!

I tried this recipe last night with filet medallions, omitted the crab stuffing.  My husband does not like onions or mushrooms so I omitted them from the sauce recipe. He raved over this recipe.  Fabulous flavor and perfect for dinner guests.  I will definetly make this again and again.

Sauce review only: We loved this sauce!  I had no problem getting it to thicken.  I chopped the mushrooms as opposed to slicing them.  We had the sauce over ribeye steaks - since that is what I had thawed.  They weren't something that could be stuffed so we had to skip the crab stuffing - which sounds like the stuffing they use to stuff shrimp at one of my favorite places - so we're looking forward to trying that next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

What a great sauce!  I was pressed for time so I skipped the crab stuffing and just made the filets with the Whiskey Peppercorn Sauce.  Make sure to get a loaf off crusty bread to soak every last drip!  This is a definite keeper.  Try it...you’ll love it!

The first time you cook this, it is time consuming but each time after that it is much easier. My 21 yr old son found this recipe and cooked it like a pro. It was simply divine. Using the best cut of steak added to the awesome sauce and stuffing, this will beat most fancy restaurants hands down. He has since made this dish several times all with the same great outcome! We love it...Thanks!

I made this for a dinner party.  To save time, I did not do the crab stuffing.  The sauce was wonderful, however I did have to add some flour to get it to thicken.  I served it with rib eye steaks.

5* ++  This was a fabulous recipe.  Made it for a special Valentine's dinner for my family.  Did not have beef broth on hand, so substituted a Knorr peppercorn gravy mix instead (added the cream, whisky and lots of mushrooms to the base).  It was fantastic.  Really liked the blended flavors of the crab and filet.  A nice combination.  Will add to the "Special" dinner collection.

Wonderful dish!  I made this dish for my parents' 30th anniversary, and they both just raved about how wonderful it was!  They both enjoyed it, which is great because they don't agree much on meat choices.  The sauce was excellent and went wonderfully with the steaks.  It did take quite some time to simmer down the sauce, and the entire dish was time-consuming (about 2 and a half hours total), but it was definitely worth the effort!  We're definitely adding this to our recipe collection.  Thanks for the recipe!

Holy moly! Wow this was probably the best meal I've ever made. My wife asked to make crab stuffed filet thinking I couldn't do it and this recipe blew her pants off. 

Yes it takes some time to reduce the sauce but was completely worth the effort. The rest of the meal was simple to make and only required some mincing and mixing. I opted to make shrimp stock and use it vs. water. (very simple recipe to make the shrimp stock). 

If you want to impress someone this is the meal to cook for that special person. Wow wow wow, it's that good!

This was great. I pretty much followed the recipe except  omitted the green bell pepper and added some potatoes. I didn’t have shrimp stock or clam juice so I substituted a Korean shrimp paste.

Fabulous meal but a ton of work.   I mostly followed the recipe but did make more crab stuffing as others suggested.   I ended up with a bit extra and made a couple small crab cakes out of it for the side.

My only real modification was to cook the filets with a Sous Vide which required some change in the process, and I skipped the bacon.   I cut the pockets into the filet before cooking, then seared them on my grill and put in the (warm) crab stuffing at the end.   Because I didn't cook the filets in the pan, I didn't have the benefit of the glaze in the pan for the sauce.   I added the juices from the bag that I cooked the steak in, but the gravy still turned out lighter in color than shown in the picture.   But, it was still very flavorful.   I used brandy instead of whiskey because I'm not a fan of whisky.

This is definitely a 'do again'.....when I have a lot of time to prepare.

I agree with other reviewers, this was time consuming but very pleased with the results. Made for an excellent valentines dinner for 4. Will absolutely be making again but won’t bother with the stuffing. The whiskey sauce is the star of this recipe - I used Jack Daniels - next time I will double the sauce and skip the stuffing.

My husband and I made it together for our Valentine's Day dinner. It was amazing! Not difficult at all. We made sure to have everything prepped and ready to go. It did take awhile to make, but that was half the fun of it and we'll worth it! Special dinner for a special evening :)

The sauce rocks!! The whole family loved the mushrooms (which I added more than called for), all the seasonings were great. We must be spoiled though, living close to the NW.  We purchased crab that had been processed in a jar  as apposed to fresh, and it was absolutely disgusting. Ruined the tenderloin flavor, and almost the sauce. If your used to "fresh caught" seafood, skip the crab, and just stick to the sauce. Cast iron pan completely makes for a perfect deglazing of the flavors.

This is AMAZING!!!!!  It was very time consuming but  worth every second.  I took others' advice and made the crab stuffing and sauce earlier in the day.  Per their advice, I doubled the crab stuffing, which wasn't really necessary and cost $$.  I had plenty left over and ended up making five crab cakes with it.  I also microwaved the bacon to cook it slightly before wrapping the steaks.  I ended up getting 8 oz. tenderloins and needed more than one slice to wrap around.  If you prep ahead like this, finishing this amazing dish is easy.  The sauce didn't thickened as much so I just added cornstarch to get the right consistency.   I invited eight people for a wine tasting dinner party and the red wine complimented this meal perfectly!!   Everyone raved about it!!!  I fixed it with the  All Recipes butternut squash risotto (fabulous!!!) and served asparagus as well.  It was a HUGE HIT!!!  There are actually three separate recipes in this one which is awesome...the crab stuffing could be used in stuffed mushrooms and they would be incredible.  And the sauce!!  It is, BY FAR, one of the best I've ever tasted and could be used on many types of meat or chicken.  Try this!!!  Your friends will rave about it!!

The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because of the all the prep. There is ALOT of prep before hand. When we made it, we used Knob Creek whiskey which added that wonderful flavor to it. After everything was made and put together, it was kind of messy to eat. Definitely will take another go at this.

I cook my filets in the pan, then broil then for about 10 minutes, depending on thickness. I also use about a cup or so of whiskey.

Tried this recipe this evening and I got thumbs up, all around! It was absolutely delicious, and contrary to the many comments about it being too time consuming, I had it on the table in less than an hour, from start to finish. I served it with whipped potatoes and steamed asparagus and Cherries Jubliee for dessert! Definitely making this again!  I give it 5 stars!!!

Obviously it's a special occasion only kind of dish, but it was so very worth the work. That sauce was one of the best things I've ever tasted. I didn't change a thing, nor would I. This is a delicious, elegant meal, perfect for an anniversary or the birthday of someone you REALLY love.

I made this last night for my grandmas retirement dinner, and let me just say it turned out amazing!!!! The filets that I had were so big, I had to use 2 pieces of bacon to wrap each one. I used cherry wood bacon which had an awesome taste. The steaks I had were about 2 inches thick, so I had plenty of room to stuff crab in them. As far as cooking them, I didn't use a pan. I first put them in the oven on 380° for about 10 minutes. Just enough to get a nice brown on the outside. I set them to the side for a little bit, so I could finish my parmesan risotto and grilled asparagus with a balsamic glaze. After that, I put the steaks on the grill for about 5-10 minutes. By the time they were done, they were nice and red on the inside. They were a beautiful medium rare. Would highly recommend this recipe.

Absolutely Amazing!  I used pretty big sized filets  (toward the .85-1 mark)  so I definitely doubled the crab filling (even though I only made two steaks)   Also- I forgot to add the dijon mayo at the end, and it still turned out great! This is time consuming, so set aside about 2-230 hours to get everything ready  (veggies, potato, etc)

Love, love, loved it!! I purchased the filets at Walmart with the bacon already wrapped on the filets. I think next time I will grill the steaks first and then stuff the crabmeat. I served with roasted red potatoes and fresh asparagus. It does take time to make but well worth it. Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

I cooked this last night and it was wonderful.  The whiskey-peppercorn sauce is a great compliment to the crabmeat stuffed filet. Like others it does take a little longer than 1 1/2 hrs to make.  I did find that the sauce had to be cooked above a simmer to thicken enough for the steaks.  I served with a basic risotto.

Switch number 1 to number two and prepare number 2 first. That helps the length of time the very worthy reviews say make it take too long. i did manage to make everything (including baked asparagus and red potatoes) in the 1 1/2 hour, but i busted butt to do it. It was fantastic and worth every second!!

This recipe was great! I made this for my boyfriend last night, Valentine's Day, and he thought I was the best cook ever. I followed the recipes exactly except for the shallot. It turned out to have great flavor, and took less time then I thought after reading through the reviews. Thanks so much for sharing!

I loved this recipe but I cannot fairly attest to the original. I altered it more due to a lack of items rather than a disagreement with any of the instructions. I didn't have green onion or shallots and I added an extra can of crab meat. Also, I thought that mushrooms would go great in this recipe so I added them as the sauce cooked down before I read that there were actually mushrooms in the recipes that were supposed to be added later. And I forgot I was out of whipping cream so I used half & half. However, the main thing I did differently, was that I used Venison back strap for this recipe, not filet mignon. It was amazing. No game taste, the meat was tender, the flavors worked perfectly. This recipe is delicious and flexible. It is a little time consuming but not difficult and very very worth it. Even my two 4 year old picky girls loved it.

Delicious! Enjoy the cooking process, have some wine, relax and the whole thing is great. I would add more sauce because ours reduced no problem (we used 10% cream). I also pre-cooked the bacon in the oven on a cookie sheet for 8 minutes on 350 to reduce the fat and ensure it was cooked. Obviously not a quick 'work night' meal and neither should it be. I'll repeat for sure but hold the crab in reserve for those 'special nights'.  Thanks for the recipe Suzie!  - Bud

This recipe is okay. The flavor of the sauce is certainly what makes this recipe stand out. However, I found that for such a time consuming recipe; the payoff wasn't nearly worth the taste.

This was incredible! We had to make a few modifications in our house because the only available filet mignon at the store was some small medallions so we couldn't quite stuff them. We made crab cakes on the side instead, and served both with the sauce. I have been hunting for a good peppercorn sauce recipe for quite some time-- this one will be added to my books. Thank you for sharing!

Wow, so this recipe is a good one! HOWEVER, like some of the reviewers said, this DEFINITELY takes longer than an hour and a half!!! I should have known just by looking at the ingredients, but it took about 3 hours or so. And also, EXPENSIVE. I only made this because my grandpa came to town and wanted something fancier- and he bought the groceries (had most of the ingredients already), which were a staggering $80!!!!!! for 4 people...ouch. Either way, he appreciated my effort and both him and my husband were raving until we went to bed. I probably won't make this again unless it's a VERY special occasion and someone else is buying!!! But, all in all, great recipe...this is one of the few recipes I've done that I wouldn't have been able to come up with out of my head, and it was succulent. If you have the time and money, it's worth it.

This recipe was the perfect Valentine's Day dinner! I agree it was a little pricey, but perfect for a special occaision. I agree that it does take longer than 1.5 hours to prepare due to the fact that the sauce does take a while to reduce, but it was worth the effort. My only suggestion would be at the end of cooking when you add the last part of whiskey, would to use less than 1 ounce because I felt the whiskey flavor was a little too strong, especially after reducing for a while. Other than that, great recipe, I will definitely make this again!

My husband really like this recipe! The only thing that confused me was the "stuffing." I changed the recipe to 3 servings, and the amounts it called for were so little I did not think it was enough. I did not stuff my filet as I don't like crab, but my husband said it was good. Also, my sauce looked like the picture until the last steps where you deglaze the skillet and add all the other items.  It ended up very thick and "greasy" looking. I don't know what I did wrong, but it still tasted awesome. I took the suggestions to start the sauce right away, and use consomme, and everything took about 2 hours. Would definitly make again!

This recipe was very good.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for but did  not have enough whisky to deglaze.  It was still very good and I will make this one again.

I gave this recipe a three star rating for several reasons. One was the amount of time it made to take. By the time I got to point in the recipe where I had to wait for the sauce to thicken, I had spent two hours preparing everything else. This was also a very, very expensive meal. I had to purchase nearly every item and I spent $71 in total. I also expected a lot more from the recipe -- the way that it's reviewed, I imagined the most divine thing ever, but what really made the recipe was the cut of the filet mignon. All in all, I may try to make it again but only on a very special occassion.

I made this recipe a few days ago as part of a special Valentine's meal for family.  I omitted the crab stuffing as we had seafood stuffed avacados as a side, but I'll be trying this recipe again w/the crab at some point.  This was the BEST recipe I have tried in quite some time.  The whiskey peppercorn sauce was delicious and I got rave review from all who partook in the dinner.  Thank you for such an elegant and easy dish.

I didn't make the crab stuffing, I used rib-eyes instead of filets mignons & I used sliced buttons for criminis & green onions for shallots because that's what I had.  I only used two rib-eyes so I didn't double the sauce but if I were making any more, I surely would. The sauce was excellent!

I too did not make the stuffing just the sauce, and its good, not great, but good. I don't think I would waste the taste of a filet mignon.

My husband loved this recipe!  The sauce was fantastic, and I had no trouble getting it to thicken.  We may just use the sauce on other recipes sometimes since  this dish did take quite a long time to prepare, but it was well worth the wait!

Even my kids loved this. We used fresh Dungeness crab. We're trying to figure out how to make it on a large scale for an 83rd birthday party.

We marinated the steaks in Rosemary, garlic and olive oil. It turned out Fabulous! 

Just make sure you use thick steaks as opposed to larger thiner steaks. Stuffing the pocket will be difficult if the steak is thin.

I've made this recipe at least 5 times and have never had a problem with the sauce thickening.  My husband likes it so much he invited my entire family over to try it.  If you stuff the steaks a day in advance it's not too time consuming.

The crab stuffing was fabulous... but not in this dish.  I would definitely make it again.  I used sirloin medallions which was better cost than the filet mignon, and tasted magnificent.  Bringing the sauce down to 1 cup took a while,and I added a little bit of flour to thicken it.

My wife and I spent a good part of Valentine's
Day making this dish. [Actually, I did most of
this, and my wife worked on a champagne 
risotto.]  Wow!  Definitely the best
thing that has ever been made in our kitchen, and
better than what I can hope for at even the best
of restaurants.  It was simply ridiculous how good this tasted.

I made this for my boyfriend for his birthday and it was fantastic.  He said it was the best meal he's ever had.  BUT it did take me about 3.5 hours to make.  And the sauce never thickened up.  Finally we got tired of waiting and just put it on the steaks and a soupy glaze.  Nevertheless it was good.

I didn't bother with the crab stuffing. Just made the sauce and steak with the bacon. The results were ok - not great. I found the sauce very salty which could have been because of the stock I used. Also the sauce didn't thicken up as much as I would have liked. Don't think I will try it again.

This recipe had a wonderful flavor, but did take a lot of time. We actually followed the recipe verbatim and if we do it again, we would 86 the crabmeat. The sauce was incredible and worth the time, but the crabmeat a bit much.

I don't know why everyone is complaining about how long it takes.  If you want a good meal you can't just pull it out of a box.  Ofcourse it will take some time, but not 3 hours like everyone is saying.  I was able to finish and enjoy it within an hour and a half.  AWESOME RECIPE!!!  Little spendy but worth it.

Absolutely awesome! I had some venison on hand so I used that instead of Filet Mignon.  My husband said it was better than any steak he's had at Ruth's Chris!  Thanks for the recipe!  I will make it again and again.

THE BEST STEAK SAUCE RECIPE EVER... better than any high end restaurant.  I've never make steak in my life, follow this recipe to bits with the helps of other reviews, it was perfect with a capital 'P'.  Cook it for my father in law and husband, received great compliments.  Excellent.. this has become my trademark now.  thanks.. for the great recipe sue.. really appreciated it.  I even skipped the crab stuffings, still tastes excellent.  i'll rate this 6 out of 5 - highly recommended.

I made this with grilled tri-tip and it was exceptional, the sauce was awesome. Ive been looking for the recipe for this sauce for a long time, my local Hunters steakhouse has this same dish on their menu and it tastes just like it. thank you for posting this recipe.
