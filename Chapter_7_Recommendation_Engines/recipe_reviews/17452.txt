A Would-Be 5-Star Cake (I'll get to the why in a sec.)  First, it's been suggested, but make sure you spend a lot of time creaming the *very* soft butter and the sugar. It's par for the course with pound-type cakes, but worth sharing.  I left the butter out overnight and creamed by hand for 30 minutes. Absolutely worth it. The crumb was perfect. Moist and buttery - almost fluffy - but still dense as a pound cake should be. Kudos to the recipe for the ingredients' proportions. They're dead-on.  Now, onto the dark side.   The cake recipe proportions are perfecto, BUT the filling might be overkill. Also, merely dumping it in the middle of the cake batter, and then pouring batter on top ain't always gonna cut it.   Some technique is required to keep the sugar from seeping to the sides while baking. When that happens, the sugar caramelizes, sticks to your greased pan and dismembers portions of your otherwise perfect cake when you flip that sucker over to remove the cake. Just sayin'.   I suggest going halves on the sugar filling, using a teaspoon to incorporate the stuff only in the very middle of the batter, and then slicing through it with a knife to keep the sugar line in-check and relatively thin.   Enjoy, and thanks for the recipe. It's a good one!

The fact that the cinnamon-sugar mixture turned hard and crunchy is enough to call this recipe a failure in my opinion. The cake itself is beautiful (until you cut into it), moist and delicious and the cinnamon mixture would undoubtedly have worked better had it been cut in half and then swirled into the batter - but that's not what the recipe directs, unfortunately.  The cake could have been salvaged, I suppose,  if it was "just" for family, but since the crunchy middle caused the cake to break apart as you cut it, there was no way I would have Hubs bring this to a business meeting tomorrow as was my intent.  The cake was tossed, which obviously was very disappointing.  This is a case where I wished I would have read the reviews BEFORE I made the recipe. Since the cake is not a success as written, without significant changes, I can only rate it "one star" and caution others before making this cake using the recipe as written. I have to assume that those reviewers who rated this recipe higher and loved it were rating a modified version.

This cake had really good texture and flavor.  I baked mine in a 9x13 inch pan, and instead of layering the cinnamon sugar, I just sprinkled it on top and swirled it around with a knife.  It took about 45 minutes to bake, but the center was not set and the top was getting hard becasue of the cinn/sug mixture.  I usually would set a peice of foil on top until it's done, but I let it cook a few more minutes and turned the oven off and let it sit there a while.  The sides did turn out a little dry but I'm still rating this 4, because had I followed the directions as written, it would have turned out just fine.  This is a good cake Diane.

This butter cake got a lot of praise from my boyfriend and his son.  They just loved it but I think the recipe calls for too much sugar.  I cut it down to about 2.5 cups and still think that's too much!!  I think the next time, I'll try making it with slightly less than 2 cups...

Mmmmoist and Deeelicious! I cut the 1 cup sugar layer in half and I didn't miss a thing! My husband ate half the cake by himself, and thats a big compliment because he usually restrains himself to a 2 slice maximum. Thanks so much for sharing.

Very tasty.  3 cups is a lot of sugar, but it incorporated better than I expected.  The streusel center also came out better than I thought - it looked a little alarming after I was DUMPING all that sugar into the center!  Tastes like a snickerdoodle pound cake.

Great Recipe! I had a piece of the cake this morning and it was so good. I made it last night and let it sit the night...really good. When i was making it i ended up running out of all-purpose flour so i had to use self-rising for the rest of the recipe. The cake still turned out great! I did make an icing, melted butter and powdered suger. It was so yummy! The cake would have been yummy with out it but i like sweets. I'll be making this again!

Definitely a "honey" of a cake that we made for our little honey's 14th birthday celebration yesterday. It was not overly sweet and very moist which we served with coffee chip ice cream on the side. HAPPY BIRTHDAY MISS TYLER!!

This recipe was a buzzkill, to say the least.  The cake was a decent coffee-cake-like base, so I can't complain about that.  However, the filling turned into a rock-hard cinnamon/sugar brick.  Perhaps if you reduce the 1 cup to 1/4 cup it would be better, but I made the mistake of following this recipe exactly.

This recipe tasted great, like a snickerdoodle cake. However it only gets 4 stars because the cinnamon sugar layer turned out hard as a rock.  Next time I'll make it in a 9x13 and mix in the layer a little more.

This cake is delicious.  I am eating a piece of it now, it's still warm. Only used 1-1/2 cup of the sugar and it is sweet enough for me and my husband.  Also didn't use the cinnamon and extra sugar for the inside. Baked it in a 9X13 glass pan for one hour, put some sprinkles on top.  Will definitely make this one again.  Yummy!

this was a really nice starter recipe, easy to follow and make. i did every by the steps except for one: i made it a chai bundt cake, with allspice, ground cloves, ground ginger, and a little black pepper mixed with sugar, instead of just cinnamon. it came out very nicely. :)

This was my first bundt cake and it turned out beautifully. I took some other reviewers advice and used half the amount of sugar and cinnamon, but at the end wished I had stuck to the original recipe.It finished baking after 55 minutes and I  iced it with a simple sugar glaze. It was moist and delicious. *****

Delicious, moist and easy to make.  I used a powdered sugar/milk glaze to decorate it, and flavored the glaze with just a tiny bit of lemon.  I know I'll make this again and again.

Very good recipe. My husband and daughter really enjoyed it with me. I made only one substitution (yogurt because I had no sour cream). I think I added an extra egg by accident but it was yummy. I made it in a 9x13 and when it came out, I poked it with a fork all over and covered it with a butter glaze (powdered sugar, melted butter, vanilla and splash of milk)

I will definitely make it again! I think I'll even use this cake recipe for other treats I make.

I don't have a Bundt pan, so I used a 9x13 pan which was fine except you will need to smooth out the extremely sticky batter. Smooth it out before adding the first cinnamon and sugar layer. Lots of compliments and easy to make!

YUM! I have tried out a ton of coffee cake recipes, and this one is by FAR the best. I added an extra dollop of sour cream to make it extra moist. If it's the first time you've made it, don't be shy pouring in that cinnamon and sugar mixture! You could also add some chopped nuts to the cinnamon mixture if you like. Great recipe!!

Loved this cake! I added Lemon juice and zest and skipped the cinnamon & sugar mixture. Mine came out dense like a pound cake. I frosted it with lemon butter cream frosting.

This cake was amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly.  It's good with cream cheese frosting (from a tub) spread over the top while still warm.  It melts into the cake and makes a nice glaze. But it's just as good without any glaze.

Great cake.  However, for the topping I will use only about 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 cup.  The cake sank in the middle because there was so much sugar.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

Great cake!  When I first saw this recipe I was intrigued because I saw the words honey and butter but it's really just a good coffee cake.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really well and oh so moist.  One thing I hadn't read in other reviews, and this could just be me, is to be sure you add at least half (if not a little more) of the batter to the pan before putting in the cinnamon sugar.  I think mine was a little thin in some places and the hot cinnamon sugar went right through the cake and stuck to the pan.  It wasn't too sweet for me although there is a spike when you bite into the cinnamon sugar part, I just take a sip of strong coffee with it and it doesn't bother me!

Very Good. I replaced the cinnamon with cocoa powder, it turned out excellent. The cake is a little to sweet for me, definitely will reduce the sugar next time.

YUMMY! I just wanted to use up the rest of my sour cream and so I came across this recipe and decided to try it out. I didn't realize it was going to be soooo good! So moist and tasty...i keep going back for more. Don't be shy with the sour cream! I cut back on the sugar/cinnamon mixture in the middle and wish I hadn't now! I'll know for next time because I will be making this again for sure and trying it out with all different types of glazes and frostings...although it's perfect on its own too! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

Excellent. I have made this a couple of times now. The cinnamon sugar mixture is so good. I only use about half cup but I think I will use a little more next time. Delicious, easy and moist. Kids love it too.

I used this recipe to make my "flag cake" for the 4th of July. It was a nice change from the standard white cake that is normally used for a flag cake. I made only slight changes:Used cake flour and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup as I don't like anything too sweet. I think I will try the Splenda for baking next time just to reduce the sugar.
I used the "fluffy boiled icing" as it holds up well for hot,outdoor events...if you make it icing the same day as it is not good kept overnight.
Several people at my party asked for the recipe.
Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

This is a simple yet delicious cake, very tender and moist.  Will reduce the amount of cinnamon sugar next time.  Definitely use a knife to swirl cinnamon sugar on top into batter before baking.  My kids loved this cake. Will make again!

I have learned a very valuable lesson! 
READ ‘the REVIEWS BEFORE you MAKE the CAKE!!!
One person said that they would have swirled the cinnamon sugar mixture through the batter ....I totally agree with that statement and that is what I will do next time.

This cake was awesome.  I was greatly complimented on this cake and it did not last very long.  I would suggest lowering the 1 cup of sugar with the cinnamon to about half a cup.  Very tasty.

This was very good.  I was a little concerned as I was sprinkling or rather scooping the sugar mixture in the middle of the cake.  It seemed like way too much sugar but it actually worked out and blended with the cake really well. I will be making this again!

This cake was DeLish!  It is quite rich and buttery and the cinnamon sugar in the middle can end up tasting like a streudal topping whe it's all gooey.  The only thing that I didn't do was use all the cinnamon and sugar mixture.  For one thing, this batter doesn't "pour".  It's a plop and smoosh sort of opperation that made it quite hard to get half in the pan and then the other half on top of the cinnamon sugar.  At any rate, I only used about half of the mixture and it turned out great.  I can't imagine using all of it.  There is no need for any kind of icing or glaze but next time I might make a kind of fruit syrup for topping.  Something with a little bite like raspberry or rhubarb would be a great complement to the richness of this cake.  I have also thought of using applesauce in place of the sour cream to lower the fat content.  I don't know how that will turn out but this recipe made its way inot my "family" cookbook right away!

I tried this because it was recommended in another review and it wasn't quite what I was hoping for.  It is a coffee cake not a pound cake.  It had a medium light crumb, was not dry but not exactly moist either, and not dense despite the very thick batter...perfect for a coffee cake!  My husband LOVED it as did my toddler.  I like really moist dense cake and this was not it but my husband prefers lighter crumbly cakes and this one fit the bill.  I think there is a little too much cinnamon sugar mixture so I would cut that in half next time. It was quite tastey though and didn't last long in our house :)

This recipe is wonderful and very simple. The only changes I made is used 1cup Splenda, 1 cup sugar for the cake. I didn't use all the cinn/sug mixture and I used egg whites. I also spread a buttercream frosting  on it (got the redipe from this site also).

All I can say is yummy!  I am glad that I decided to follow the directions and use the full amount of sugar and cinnamon mixture.  It looked like a lot but it is the perfect amount for this cake.  My family went crazy over this cake...thanks Diane.  I did watch the time and it only took 50 minutes for it to be done but ovens vary so make sure you keep an eye on it while it is baking.

We like our desserts less sweet, so I followed the other reviews and cut the sugar down by half. I also used only half of the cinnamon/sugar mixture. The cake turned out wonderful--the bottom forms a yummy crust and it was just the right amount of sweetness (it really does taste like snickerdoodle cookies!) Great with coffee! I set my timer at 60 minutes and the cake was a little dry the next day, so next time I'll probably check it at 45 min. This would make yummy cupcakes too!

Great cake!  I took this to work for a coworker's birthday and everyone raved about it!  It's a good brunch cake.  I didn't use the full cup of cinnamon sugar in the middle layer, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was wonderful!  Definitely a keeper.

My mom brought home a recipe close to this many years ago.  It has become my favorite.  However, we a couple tablespoons of sugar with 1 teaspoon of sugar for this cake.  You just need a light sprinkling of this mixture.  We sprinkle half in the bottom of the bundt pan and the other half in the middle.  Just the right amount for us!

Fantastic! Only I changed it a bit. I added a bout 2 teaspoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice, and about 1 tsp. of lemon zest. I also changed the butter, I halfed it and put half a cup of coconut oil. It already had plenty of sugar, rather than the 1 c of sugar w/ cinnamon (not my favorite), I just sprinkled a teaspoon of sugar on the top.  Also, I didn't have a bunt pan, so I just put it in a square cake pan, it needed about 20-25 mins extra. It turned out wonderfully!

Turned out great.   I did not do the cinnamon sugar swirl.  I needed a plain pound cake for use with a chocolate ganache Amaretto whip topping.  As a basic poundcake recipe it was perfect and uses fewer eggs than most pound cake recipes which is a plus for watching cholesterol.  And I was short on eggs too.  Used "light" sour cream. I did half real butter and half Smart Balance omega 3 spread.  Creamed up perfect with the sugar and lowered the sat. fat intake for me.  I cut sugar back to 1 3/4.  2 cups seemed like alot.   Next time I may sub some baking Truvia for part or all of the sugar.   Cook time was an hour & 5 min.   Used a bundt pan.  Good recipe!

I usually rate recipes I have followed exactly, but I must say this is an amazing butter cake! I just rate it 4 stars because I change the flavor. Doing the basic batter I omited the cinamon part and used blueberries and orange zest. Delicious!!!

Very moist, and yummy! I used a cup of milk that I soured with a tablespoon of vinegar, since I had no sour cream - was just throwing together something with what I had in the cupboard - this was perfect!

YUM!  This tastes like a good old homemade cinnamon coffee cake, more pleasing for morning time rather than after dinner dessert.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfectly!  This one's a keeper!

This was an excellent coffee cake. I would definitely not put this in the category of a pound cake. My family loved it and we almost finished it in one day. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe. This is a keeper!

Very good.  It is a good recipe for a coffee cake.  Not what I expected, but it turned out well.  The batter seemed very thick so I was a little concerned.  However, we all cleared our plates!

The flavor was really quite good, but my oven was a mess!  I'm sure that this was more my fault than the recipe since it doesn't seem that overflows have been a common problem.  Also, I wasn't expecting this to be so much like a run-of-the-mill coffeecake...

I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and reduced the sugar/cinnamon mix to 1/2 cup.  I used real butter and large eggs.  I was not as impressed with this cake as I was expecting to be after reading all the great reviews.  It was a very nice cake, but nothing spectacular.  I most likely will not make it again.
