As written, I didn't like this recipe much, but thought it had potential.  So...  I doctored it quite a bit and it turns out to be amazing.  I took it to work today and everyone went wild and requested the recipe.  I put the turkey, broth (I used turkey stock left over from T'giving), onion, a can of black beans, a can of corn, one can of chopped tomatoes, one can of Rotel tomatoes with chilis, FOUR cloves of garlic minced, the juice of one entire lime, and seasonings as written in my crock pot on low.  Eight hours later I returned from work and added about a half cup chopped fresh cilantro, two cups of shredded colby-jack cheese, and a cup of sour cream.  Stirred and let it heat on high for about thirty minutes.  Then I crushed tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl, ladled the soup over, and put more grated cheese on top.  TO DIE FOR!  Tastes like Chipotle in a bowl.  Seriously good.  Doesn't look that pretty but incredibly tasty.  I gave the recipe five stars as written to keep the ratings high so people would experiment with this FABULOUS soup!  Good luck!

I made a couple changes just for what I had on hand. I had four large turkey drumsticks that I bought on the cheap, so I cooked them down and pieced them out and used the broth (that I flavored up with onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, paprika and oregano) that I made in this soup. I didn't have whole peeled tomatoes but I did have fire-roasted tomatoes, so I used that. I upped the spices quite a bit and threw in two chopped red bell pepper when I sauteed the onion and garlic. It's a great way to use turkey on the cheap, which I really appreciate and this soup as a whole is pretty low-cal, if you lighten up on your cheese sprinkling hand. Plus, it's quick, even making my own broth. After I had the broth made, it literally took me less than a half hour to pull this soup together. But, you might need more spice. I like my soups really kickin', so I just spiced away. After taste testing, I think it needs something else. I can't put my finger on it. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Doug. NOTE: And for all of you who are like me and buy turkey drumsticks for the cheap meat, four large is exactly enough for a pot of this soup!

Excellent soup! My family loved it. I added half a can of corn(rinsed) and half a can of pinto beans(rinsed) for that authentic southwestern taste. I topped with extra sharp cheddar and jack and fresh cilantro. Also I had some french bread for Dipping. (My three year old loved doing that) Or you could serve it with crispy tortilla strips. (that's how my husband likes it.Also remember to keep stirring this as some of the solids may stick to the bottom. Good recipe thanks.

I modified a bit because I like more depth in my soup and used chicken instead of turkey (what I had available).  I sauteed the onion and garlic in the oil first before adding stewed tomatoes along with the fresh romas.  I also added corn and black beans.  I must say I enjoyed adding the lime it brightened up the soup but I disliked the chopped avocado, I love avocadoes but the flavors of the soup made them taste a little strange. I prefer topping the soup with Guacamole instead.

I added a can of drained corn and used several tablespoons of minced fresh cilantro, and omitted the avocado.  Children may find it a bit spicy for them. Quick & easy.

This soup was excellent.  I used Mexican style stewed tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomatoes.  I also put all of the ingredients in a crock pot, turned on high and let it cook for three and a half hours.  Warm corn bread was a perfect additon to the soup!  It was so easy!

Wonderful recipe to customize to a family's individual tastes and can't go wrong doing so.  Great way to use up leftover turkey after the holidays especially when there is a nip in the air.  I did slow boil the turkey carcass and used the broth as it gave it more depth of flavor with the seasonings, etc., otherwise followed the directions.  Thanks to alleviating turkey burnout Doug Matthews, aka, Respect the Bird blogger!  :)

This tasted great after previously suggested changes were made to the recipe.  Most important, I would fry the garlic and onion in oil or butter first.  I used 2 cloves of garlic and 1/4 tsp of cayenne and added both black beans and corn. I thickened it with potato flakes and crushed corn chips into it.  The sour cream gave it a strange color, maybe it would work better if it had cooled down a bit.  This tastes even better the next day.

Good.  I added strips of 4 corn tortillas and cooked for an additional 20 minutes.  Didn't have avocado.

Excelente Doug! Fabuloso tambien! :) I have been meaning to try this for quite some time and finally had some leftover turkey to do it with!  The only changes I made were to sub fresh ingredients for canned/dried.  I loathe canned anything, so used 6 fresh, roma tomatoes (peeled and chopped), and used some of my pickled serrano peppers that I made in August (all to eliminate all the needless sodium in canned goods). I did add 2 cups of pinto beans that I had in the freezer (dried beans that I soaked and cooked earlier) and used fresh cilantro instead of dried.  With the addition of the beans, it made it that much more healthier and filling! I topped with fat-free sour cream and low-fat cheese.... I have 2 containers leftover that will be used up in the next few days, this really is an awesome flavoured soup with the ingredients used...and a MUST for this recipe is to use fresh cilantro...dried just doesn't cut it! :) Thank you again Doug for the inspiration in this dish!

Delicious.  I, too, added a can of corn and a can of black beans and used fresh cilantro.
Try topping with a cut up corn tortilla.  Really adds some nice texture.

Very good soup!  The only thing I changed was I added a can of black beans.  We are having leftovers again tonight for supper.

Very Good!!  I did change a few ingredients to use what I had on hand.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole and zucchini instead of avacado and chicken broth instead of vegetable. I added black beans like some of the others suggested, next time, will add more.  My family really enjoyed this soup, it is a nice change from the usual.

This soup was a fantastic way to use up our leftover turkey! I added corn and black beans, as well as half a block of cream cheese, my son and husband loved it.

This was very tasty.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added a can of black beans and some kernel corn.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Added at least double of the garlic, cumin and cayenne, and then also added some chili powder and parsley.  Had fresh cilantro so just put a bit in the soup and then garnished with cilantro, cheese, avocado, sour cream and tortilla chips.  Delicious!

Hmmmm...of all the "southwestern-type" soups that I have made, this was not a favorite. My family is so-so on potentially spicy meals.  One time is too "hot" and one time is two "mild."  Apparently, this classifies as too hot...even with a dollop of sour cream and sharp cheddar cheese to try and cool it off.  I thought it was okay.  Per other recommendations, I added a can of northern beans and a can of corn for both color, taste, and texture. Also, I didn't use the roma tomatoes and no avacado...which may be the reason for the less successful result.  Still a decent and quick dinner and a good way to use up turkey. However, not sure if I will make this again. Worth I try! Thanks Doug.

Instead of vegetable broth and shreaded turkey I would cook down the turkey carcass and use what turkey you get off the bones and the broth as a base for the soup

It's a good base. I think that next time, I'll add more to jazz it up (maybe some beans, corn, and fresh jalapeno).

Giving this a strong 4 ... In my husbands words (who is a solid meat and potato guy) "it's hard to give any soup 5 stars..this was close"  made pretty much to the T!  Thanks Doug!  Will 100% make again!

This soup is awesome. Tweaked it a bit, added black olives, corn and fresh cilantro and leave off the cheese.  Have a pot of it on simmering now made with a rosemary and garlic chicken I baked. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is fabulous! I used 2-14 oz. cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of peeled tomatoes and I only had cheddar cheese on hand to shred. I also added a dollop of sour cream to finish. My husband loved this and so did I!

This is yummy! I did cook it in the slow cooker, which meant the house gave me a super aromatic welcome! Tasted as good as it smelled! Only thing I did different is, I left out the avocado!

Not a very hearty soup, but tasty all the same.  Great if you're trying to be calorie conscious after eating too much at Thanksgiving!

Good way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  Everyone enjoyed this at dinner last night.  I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil prior to adding the remaining ingredients.  Used the stewed tomatoes with celery/onion/garlic and omitted the additional fresh tomatoes since I was adding a can of black beans and a small can of corn.  Left out the avocado and sour cream.  Topped with Mexican blend cheese.

Loved this recipe! I did change some things that others recommended. I added a can of black beans, 1 cup of corn, and I omitted the avocado.  After making the soup, I topped the bowls with sour cream.  It was very good!

This isn't my type of thing, but my roommate can't get enough of it.  He will eat a whole batch in one sitting, it's ridiculous.  I've also made this with chicken and it works just as well, I usually use homemade broth.  I also have one thing that I change, and that is that I don't use avocado, and I add a can of corn and a can of black beans.  Sometimes I add jalapenos at my roommates request for some extra spice.  I usually forget about the cheese, but it's good either way.

Yummy!  My "doesn't like spicy" son even ate it.  I used a can of Rotel for the green chiles and used chicken broth.  We barbeque our turkey with mesquite charcoal, so it has a nice smokey flavor to add to this soup.  Will definitely be making this soup whenever I have leftover turkey.  The cumin adds a necessary taste to this soup - don't skip it.  I used ground chipotle instead of cayenne because that is what I keep on hand.  As others have suggested, I chose to saute the onion and garlic before adding broth and tomatoes, even though I'm sure I would like the soup without doing that.  I put the avocado into the bowls "raw" and poured the soup over - because one of us doesn't like avocado, and the other two love it.  This is a definite keeper and already in my recipe box.

So easy - throw it all in the crock pot, add corn, garlic, thyme, and even some noodles/rice may work too.

This soup was so good that we are having turkey again for Christmas just so we can have leftovers! I didn't add the avocado only because I forgot to get it at the store and it was still wonderful!

WOW!  This is perfect!  A nice "kick" to leftover thanksgiving!  I am not real fond of turkey soup... so this is a great change from the norm. Thanks!  I didn't use avocado, but threw in a can of rinsed black beans!  Served it with quasadillas.

Oh. My. Goodness. This was SOOOOOO good!!! I admit, after reading all of the reviews I wasn't sure this was going to be anything special. I even thought of trying a different recipe altogether - but I'm really glad I didn't! This is absolutely superb AS WRITTEN!!! DO NOT be tempted to make any changes (at least initially). This soup is not bland in the least. Top your soup with cheese, some fresh cilantro / scallion and crushed tortilla chips (or strips) and voila! - a satisfying, warming bowl of awesome deliciousness! Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Doug! I will be making this often, subbing chicken when turkey is not an option.

Very good flavor. I didn't use canned green chills, instead I cut up one jalapeño pepper and it was very tasty with a lot of flavor. I also simmered longer to let the flavor mesh. Even better the next day when the flavors mixed longer. Next time I will added crispy tortilla chips onto and maybe a dollop of sour cream.

delicious way to completely make your left-overs fresh and new. We made it a tortilla soup by adding friend strips or tortilla with about 5 mins left in the cooking process, then topped our individual servings with Sour Cream. Overall the best thing about this recipe is that it doesn't taste at all like Thanksgiving food, so if you're tired of the same old turkey, try this one.

This is such an easy, fantastic recipe. I have made it exactly according to the recipe and have also made it adding corn. Both ways are delicious. It also freezes well. This is my most used soup recipe.

What a different way to use the turkey from T-day! I changed it a bit (as ususal) I sauteed celery w/a bunch of jarred garlic in evoo, then added the turkey, reg.size can of diced tomatoes,(didnt understand using whole canned tomatoes) 32oz box of chix broth, a drained can of black beans, 1/2 a beer I was drinking :),squeeze of lime juice, and about 1/2 cup of creamed corn leftover (I'd recommend a splash of cream/whole milk to thicken and cut the green chili spice if you dont like it spicy) and a tad of frozen corn, another tad of frozen okra, cumin and chili powder, can of green chilis.. then finished it w/ stirring in chopped green onions (either add them early, or late otherwise they just taste wierd) also fresh cilantro last 15 mins. Super Yummy!! I put some cayenne pepper in my bowl only since I was feeding the kids. Shredded the monterey jack atop and served w/ tortilla chips. Everyone totally loved it! Wouldn't have guessed it was leftover Thanksgiving. After all the turkey..stuffing..mshd pots.. this was a great change w/out wasting $$.  Thanks for the awesome post!!

There was something wierd about this recipe.  I haven't figured it out yet, but my daughter has required me to promise I'll make this again and again so I guess it was a success.  This could be thickened into more of a chili by adding refried beans.

OK, did I miss something in the directions? I added my can of whole peeled tomatoes to the pot, and they remained "whole" throughout the cooking process.  I had to scoop them out and dice them up and return them to the pot.
The flavors are very interesting and it's not too spicy.  I thought it would be a bit less chunky.  I will make it again.
I think adding corn to it sounds great, just didn't have any.
Certainly better than the typical turkey rice soup for leftover!

Last month I slightly overcooked a turkey tenderloin that had been marinated in lime and tequila.  I didn't want to serve it to company and I didn't want to throw it out so I wrapped it in foil and threw it in the freezer until I could figure out what to do with it.  Along came this recipe and I knew I had found a home for my poor turkey tenderloin.

Since the turkey had already been marinated in lime, I didn't add the lime, but I added the fresh cilantro, corn and beans as others suggested.  Wow!  

This is a do over, which is high praise in this house.

This recipe is a great starter, to modify to your liking.  I used turkey broth, added black beans, corn and used fresh cilantro.  I put it in the crock pot on high for 4 hours, then low until served.  I'll be making this after every turkey!

I made this soup last night with left over turkey from thanksgiving and we loved it.  I did add corn and black beans.  I also used diced tomatoes with green chiles which I believe may have made the soup a little spicier then I would like.  I will continue to play with this recipe but it definetly is a keeper.

Very Good!  My husband and I both enjoyed this one.  I am a stickler for following a recipe to the letter (the first time anyway!) and can see no reason for the 2 Roma tomatoes.  The next batch I plan to use a green or yellow bell pepper, about 1/2 package of frozen corn and fresh cilantro.  Thank you so much!

Excellent recipe. I started w/ fresh turkey breast and veggie & chicken stock adding just some water for my liquid. Then I further modified it by adding 2 chopped green peppers, omiting the cilantro (because I was out) and cutting the corn off of three ears. It was fantastic! Great with a pan of cornbread! Worked great on helping me recover from my cold!

I used chicken instead of turkey and added corn and fresh cilantro and this soup was delicious.  This soup is like the mexican version of gumbo - a classic.

This soup is delicious.  I cooked a turkey so that I could make this soup.  The only modifications to the recipe were turkey stock, fresh cilantro, a can of Rotel original and some corn.  This soup is a BIG hit in my house.

We thoroughly enjoyed this soup! I was looking for a different recipe to use some of the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and this fit the bill.  Didn't change a thing except I added some fresh chopped parsley for some color.  Today was a cold day and soup was just what we needed.  Thank you, Doug Matthews!

Follwed the recipe pretty closely. I used left over turkeyftom the freezer, left out the cilantro, and added a cup of salsa. I cooked it in the crockpot, adding the salsa just begore serving, and the cheese and guacamole when I served it. This was a wonderful use of left overs.  I am sure we will make it again.

My family and I loved this recipe but I will be using diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes next time. We would also not add sour cream (as suggested in the video), it did give it a weird color and taste. I think the cheese was enough to counter the heat from the spices. I think I will also add corn and beans as some people suggested. Can't wait to make it again with the added changes! Definitely a keeper.

I made as written except that I read the reviews beforehand and decided to add a can of rinsed black beans to the pot after I turned off the heat. I do not think they added much if any flavor and I simply did it to stretch the pot out so it would last me all week at work for lunches. I honestly thought the avocado would lose not only its bright green color but also it's texture after being reheated but it held up wonderfully. This is a great way to use up extra turkey from the holidays. Thanks so much Doug!

I made this with a couple of changes, but nothing I thought was too drastic. I used a package of ground turkey in place of chopped, I used onion powder instead of an onion, I used one drained can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh, I doubled the garlic, I added a can of pinto beans that I drained and rinsed and also some frozen corn kernels.  I served with sharp cheddar cheese and corn bread muffins.  I thought this was a really great soup.  Next time I would probably use more chopped tomatoes in place of the can of whole peeled tomatoes because my family is not a fan of whole tomatoes in their soup.  My husband thought the avocado in the soup was unnecessary but I liked it.

Another recipe in my box for awhile that I finally got to make it. Great way to use up leftover turkey. Glad we got one last cold blast for soup this past week. I pretty much followed the recipe, except threw in a garden jalapeño and poblano pepper, since I like heat. Oh and I put a can of pinto beans for fiber. Thanks Doug!

This was really good!  Bright and fresh tasting, this is a great way to deal with leftovers.  Only two changes:  I used fresh cilantro instead of dried, and I used the avocado as a garnish, just because!  I took your suggestion and served it with cornbread.  Yum, yum!  Thanks, Doug!

Love it!  Easy and delicious!  Added a can of black beans.  I didn't feel the love with avocado, but everything else was perfect!  This recipe would be versatile too, depending on what you have on hand.  Thank you for a new way to use leftover turkey!

I love this recipe. It has so much flavor. I made it with turkey leftovers and love it so much that I make it with chicken as well. I like to add a half cup of sweet corn and half cup of black beans. YUM!

I admit I did not make this as written. Sometimes you use a good beginning and make to your own tastes. I make it with Thanksgiving turkey and homemade turkey broth. I am not a big fan of cayenne pepper or avocados. I omitted them. I love cumin and tripled this. Then I added corn and black beans. Great soup!

Yummy! The last of the turkey leftovers went into this soup. I did have to change it a bit using what I had on hand.  I used Turkey stock instead of vegetable broth, no avocado, I didn't have whole peeled tomatoes so I used crushed, and I didn't really measure the spices just dumped them in and tasted. I also added black beans and some leftover corn. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Followed the recipe but took several suggestions and added the corn and black beans. I didn't have an avocado but put sour cream on top along with cheese and it was great. Used spicey mexican corn and black beans which made it a bit snappy so we toned it down with elbow macaroni! This is on the 'make again' list for sure!

This really WAS an interesting solution for the pile of turkey in the fridge!  I will admit here that I dislike turkey.  Like SERIOUSLY DISKLIKE turkey.  So it is imperative that it is hidden away in something non-Thanksgiving in appearance after the big day. I made the recipe pretty much as directed except I didn't have fresh tomatoes... so I skipped those.  And I didn't have MJ cheese for topping @ the end, but I did have cheddar.  But I DID have an avocado on hand.  Weird, I know.  I sauteed the onions & garlic in a TBSP of olive oil to get a fond going before adding all the liquids/other ingredients... chopped the turkey pretty fine & added about 1/2 a cup extra of (just because I'm desperate to make it go away).  I let it cook down longer (because I forgot about it) so it was much thicker than I thought it would be.  The flavor was GREAT... not "spicy"...but definitely had a kick... and made me forget it was turkey.  BONUS! Put a little sour cream on it also... reminded me of chili soup of some sort.  I would definitely make this again... with or without turkey... maybe left over chicken or beef roast.  Nice that it had no rice, noodles, potatoes or beans... so had a wholesome veggie/lowish carb kind of quality about it. Good stuff.

I give this five stars with the changes I made. I followed CookinMommy1's directions for the most part, though I forgot to add the cilantro and added the cheese and sour cream to individual portions. My son thought the tomato pieces were too big, so next time I will use petite diced tomatoes, I will also use a little less broth next time, as I thought it was a little watery. Maybe just 3 cups. I cooked it in the slow cooker for 6 hours.

I literally just made this and I am loving my first bowl! I make a similiar soup with chicken so I automatically tweaked this recipe to be like this chicken soup my famill loves. I love flavor so I sauteed the onion and garlic first until translucent and then added everything right on top. I used juice of a whole lime. At least a tablespoon of salt, some coarse black pepper and I added a can of black beans. I also added more cumin skipped the cilantro because I had none and I added at least an additional cup of turkey as I wanted to use as much leftover as I could. I left out the avocado all together for my husbands taste. I crushed a handful of tortilla chips into the bottom of the bowl and used pepper-jack cheese with last but not least a generous spoon of sour cream on top. Yum! Next time I plan to add some hominy and maybe some canned or frozen corn.

We love this soup, I make it every time we have a turkey, because there's always leftovers. My husband and kids look forward to it. I always doctor it to our taste. I'll add cooking wine or just keep seasoning it to taste. Always taste your cooking while it's still on the stove and season to your liking, that's the best advice I can give.

This was yummy! I used 48 oz can of chicken broth instead of veggie stock... As suggested by someone else, increased the lime juice and used the juice of the whole lime. I also threw in a can of drained corn and a can of cilantro lime Rotel.  Somehow I was out of cilantro so substituted basil. Pepper jack cheese added a little more spice. Topped with a little sour cream... Mmmm do over for sure!

This was a great way to use up leftover turkey.  It had a wonderfully refreshing flavor - not the same old turkey soup!  My whole family loved it.  Will definitely make this again.  I did make a couple changes, however.  I made my own stock from the leftover turkey bones, rather than using four cups of vegetable broth.  I also added some black beans, celery, sliced olives and peppers for some more color a vegetables.  But I kept all the seasonings and other flavors the same.

WONDERFUL!!!! Unlike many soups, this one has plenty of flavor from day one!  I rarely take time to rate recipes, but this one is a keeper.  A great way to use up the less desirable leftover parts of the turkey.  Like many reviewers, I found the basic recipe easily adaptable to what I had in my kitchen.  (I used chicken broth, extra turkey and spices, 1 can each of fire roasted salsa tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, mild tomatoes w/ green chilis, corn, and a drained, rinsed can black beans-no avacado.) We had it "plain" (brothy) today; will wait a day or two and add sour cream and cheeses to leftovers to make it different.  LOVED IT! Thanks, Doug, for sharing.

I hate rating a recipe when I've done as many changes as I have with this one.  But Doug's basic recipe is a winner as far as I'm concerned, with or without my changes.  For four, I use 3/4 pound uncooked skinless, boneless chicken breast, 2 cups chicken broth, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can black beans (rinsed and drained), 1 chipotle chile (canned in adobo) finely minced, 1/8 cup onion (DH is not fond of cooked onion so you might want to up this), 1 minced clove garlic, 1/2 tablespoon fresh lim juice, 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin, salt and pepper to taste, 2/3 cup frozen corn (no need to thaw), 1/4 teaspoon dried cilantro, 1/4 diced avocado and 2 ounces cheddar cheese.  Cook everything except the avocado and cheese, first on a boil then on simmer for 15-20 minutes.  Add the avocado and simmer another 15-20 minutes until slightly thickened.  Serve with cheese (and other goodies as desired).  I have to agree with other reviewers:  this recipe rates very high stars because it is so very versatile.  You definitely need to try this!

I also doctored this recipe up.  I didn't add whole peeleed tomatoes, 2 roma tomatoes chopped or the avocado.  I added pinto beans, 2 teaspoons chili powder and cumin and 1 teaspoon coriander.  I also had 9 cups of broth.  At the end I added the cilatro to the top.  I also used turkey broth from the turkey carcass I had.  I made the broth which made it great!

I have made this twice and it is a fantastic recipe for leftover turkey!  Use at least double the turkey and only 2 cans of vegetable broth.  There is no need to use the fresh tomatoes. Absolutely use fresh cilantro!  I served it once with Roasted Red Pepper muffins.  Husband requests it over rice the next time.

We didn't really care for this soup. It smelled good while it was cooking but it just didn't taste very good. It might be the combination of turkey and tomatoes that didn't work for me, I'm not sure, but I didn't think it tasted very good. It did help to add crushed tortilla chips to the bowls and put some cheese and a little sour cream on it.

Surprisingly fabulous.  Added black beans.  Grated some pepperjack cheese on it.  Crunched in some Tostios Artisan recipes Roasted Garlic and Black Beans tortilla chips over the top.  Will make again :)

This is a very fresh tasting soup.  Followed the recipe to the T.  I enjoyed it very much.  My 3 and 8 year old boys, however, did not.  I think it was a little acidic for them.  But I will definately make this again for myself and DH.

Absolutely delicious!  I made a couple of changes, but I'm sure the recipe great without them.  Here's what I did: 1) used 1 can petite diced tomatoes & pureed half of it; 2) used 1/2 a yellow onion and 1/2 a red onion; 3) used 2 tsp. fresh chopped cilantro instead of 1/2 tsp dried; 4) added 1 can rinsed & drained black beans; and 5) used about 2 cups shredded chicken (didn't have turkey).  It made about twelve 1.5 cup servings.  And the best part, on top of it being delicious, is that it only has about 210 calories per serving, including the cheese!  I will be making this one again for sure.

This recipe was really good!  I only put in about a pinch of the pepper (I used chipoltle chile pepper) and I added a can of hominy corn.  I also pre-cooked the onion and garlic in a little olive oil.  My husband and kids thought it was fantastic.  It was also VERY easy.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

The soup is so delicious!  Even my husband who is not a soup fan said it's phenomenal.  I made a couple of changes - I substituted leftover homemade turkey stock for the vegetable; can of spicy rotel tomatoes for the roma tomatoes; added chili powder and a chicken bouillon cube as well.  Before mixing the ingredients in the pot I sauteed the onions, garlic and chiles in extra virgin olive oil to carmalize.  Awesome results and we will be making this again soon!

I used 8 cups of turkey broth (but I didn't increase the red pepper and it was plenty spicy)...I did increase the cumin.  I didn't have the fresh tomatoes, but it was fine anyway.

Thought this recipe was a great switch from Turkey ala King. Husband  loved it as I thought he might since he could add Tortilla chips to it. I cooked it in a crock pot about six hours. Used hotter japelenos, black beans and corn, shredded cheddar, it was very good. I've learned two new essentials (including a dressing recipe) for the holidays from this site.

My fiance and I really liked this soup.  Since we like spicy things, I doubled the amount of chiles and cayenne pepper.  We didn't have shredded turkey, so I bought the ground turkey and browned it.  We've made it a few times.  It was really good.

My husband and I loved this soup! It was a terrific change from turkey noodle. I used the leftover broth from boiling the giblets and leftover gravy.  If you double the recipe (I did x4) DO NOT use the recommended amts of spices or jalapenos.  I cut way back and it was still very spicy.  I did not use the avocado.

Excellent!  My husband is a terribly picky eater, and usually refuses to eat leftovers.  Not only did he LOVE this recipe, but ate the leftover soup for two more meals. I'm making this tonight for the third time since Thanksgiving per his request.  Like other reviewers I doctored it by adding a can of corn and a can of black beans. I also use a can of the mexican chopped tomatoes with cilanto versus roma tomatoes.  I usually double the amount of turkey and up the amount of broth as well.  I serve it with sour cream and grated cheese on the side and skip the avocado.

Fabulous!  The only problem was I should have doubled the recipe as everyone went back for seconds.  I did make a few changes however; added corn as suggested, 2 stalks of chopped celery as well as 1/4c of cream.  Thanks very much for a fantastic recipe!

i didn't have much in my pantry but i did need an easy way to use all the turkey leftovers my family gave me. i omitted the roma tomatoes, avocado and cheese since i had none of those and added a bit more shredded turkey than called for. i also used diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes and only used 3 cups of broth. i added some hot sauce to my individual bowl since i like my southwestern soups really spicy and served with saltine crackers. it was absolutely delicious.

I eliminated the roma tomatoes, cut up the whole tomatoes (next time I'll use diced), added leftover cooked corn, and chopped up half a fresh jalapeno pepper. It was spicy..serve lots of water...but de-lish! We garnished with tortilla chip bits (the stuff at the bottom of the bag) and used the monterey jack cheese in grilled cheese sandwiches...thanks for a really different way to use leftover turkey! Will definitely do this one again...

Very versatile recipe. I had fun with it, cowboy style. I used a couple of can that were tomato and chilis already in them. Great Nortern beans instead of avacado ( I will try the avacado next time sounds delicious ) Oh! I also added corn. It was spicy. I add a splash of half and half for my child who doesn't like spicy. It is a wonderful soup and has lots of flavor.

Really easy and good.  I used chicken broth, used rotel and canned corn.  My family really liked the taste of this soup.  I topped it off with cheddar cheese.  I couldn't believe how yummy the avocados were and they didn't turn brown on me!!!!!!

I have made this many, many times!  It is so delicious.  I change it a bit though: we use chicken (don't like turkey), chicken broth instead of vegetable, I use pepper jack cheese rather than plain jack, and I pour the soup over a handful of crushed thick corn tortilla chips over the top just before serving.  We also use fresh cilantro! Then we top it with a hearty dollop of sour cream!  DELICIOUS!

Excellent! I will make this again.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable.  I used the fresh tomato, but the canned would be sufficient. I also used a little more turkey.  Next time I will use two avocado's because love them.  I also used 1/2 the cayenne, because I was afraid it would be too hot for my three and nine year old, but it wasn't.  I also didn't have cheese but it was good without, probably better with it though.  I would also top with sliced olives and sourcream next time - and make corn bread.

Absolutely awesome!  This is the best soup I think I've ever made.  I made a few adjustments to the recipe to fit my taste, such as using 99% fat free ground turkey, and I cooked half an onion, garlic, ground cayenne pepper, diced green and yellow peppers together.  I added this to the vegetable broth and added more garlic, another onion, a can of rinsed black beans and a can of drained white corn along with the spices and tomatoes and allowed it to stew an extra 10 or so minutes.  I also halved the cilantro to 1/4 tsp. (only because my husband has a low tolerance for the taste of cilantro), and I served shredded pepper jack cheese over his bowl.  As another reviewer suggested, I cut up a fresh fat free tortilla shell and topped the soup with it.  This was magnificent!  This is definitely a keeper, and I can't wait until the leftovers tomorrow night!  I reserved the remainder of the can of vegetable broth (this recipe calls for approx. 2 1/3 cans) to add to leftovers to make it soupier.  Try this one, folks.  It's really out of this world!  Thanks for the recipe!

After I started making this I realized I was out of a few things I thought I had so I made numerous substitutions.  I used Red Hot in place of cayenne pepper,chicken broth for vegetable sauce, omitted the garlic and used canned diced tomatoes with garlic in place of canned whole tomatoes.  I also added some garlic salt and mexican seasoning.  The soup had good flavor and just the right amount of "heat".  Next time I might add mexican style corn and some cooked rice.

I have to agree with the other reviews on this...

It was great!  We had some friends over and had this soup and it was gone in no time.  Had it with corn bread muffins.  I also added a few things...cut corn of two ears of white corn and added a can of black beans and probably 2 1/2 cups of turkey (too many left overs!) and it tasted wonderful!  Used a couple of tablespoons of fresh cilantro instead of dried which made the smell incredible!  Try this one out!

This recipe gives great value for the ease of effort in preparation.  It is flexible too! I left out the chiles, avocado, and monterrey, and added the corn and fresh cilantro. There isn't a member of my family who didn't ask for seconds.

It was amazing!! I used fresh cilantro and chilies instead which I think added a little more flavor. I also used garlic salt instead of the fresh garlic. I didn't have Monterrey Jack Cheese so I used parm which worked fine. I added sour cream and some cracked pepper which was also really good!! Super yummy and really really easy to make!!

This is now my son's favorite soup.  I didn't add the cilantro, cheese or avocado, and substituted the vegetable stock with chicken stock.  I also threw in some Mexican style pasole.  I used chicken in the second batch...(yes he wanted it 2 weeks in a row), because I was out of leftover turkey.  It was just as good.

This was delicious.  The only tweaks I made were petite diced instead of whole tomatoes and used guacamole (leftover from the holiday) instead of fresh avocado.  We don't like spicy too much, so I used a chili and lime seasoning and left off the green chili peppers.  I doubled the recipe so there would be lunch leftovers.  Nope, got nothing today.  And there are just 4 of us.  Somebody went back for a third helping...

This was a good base recipe. I made broth with a turkey carcass and then added 2 small cans of crushed tomatoes. I was in a hurry so I didn't add any fresh aromatics but next time I will saute some onion, garlic and jalapeno and add them to the soup. I added 2 limes because I had a lot of broth and I loved the taste of it. Almost like Tom Yam but with a Southwestern flair. The amount of spice called for was not enough so I upped that and added black beans and corn.

Delicious and easy!  And I'm sure it would be just as delish with chicken.  I took others' suggestions and added a can of Rotel tomatoes, a can of black beans, and used a little extra cumin and about a TBSP of chili powder.  I also used diced peeled tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes.  I also sauted the onion with triple the amount of minced garlic.  Cooked it in the slow cooker on high for a couple of hours, then added 1/4 cup fresh chopped cilantro, some sour cream, maybe 1/4 cup, and 1/2 the cheese.  Then we added sour cream, cheese and avocado to suit our individual tastes.  The only thing I'll change next time is to stir the sour cream into a small cup of the soup and then add to the pot.  It seemed to clump a bit when I dumped it straight into the soup mixture.  Thanks, Doug!

This is a great recipe that can be made as written or modified to your own taste. I used a large can of rotel tomatoes
Instead of the can of regular tomatoes and plum tomatoes. I also added a can of Mexican corn and black beans. It was delish. Thanks Doug for a great recipe. Loved it!

Although I didn't follow the recipe as it, I thought it was pretty good! Following some of the past reviews, I sautéed the garlic and onion first, and then added the tomatoes (just used diced, seasoned tomatoes and diced tomatoes with green chile) and turkey and seasoned with cumin and cayenne. Then I added some corn and black beans and simmered 15-20 minutes. It came out very tasty! It was warm and not too spicy. I served tortilla chips, cilantro, mont. jack cheese, and avocado on the side. I'm sure some sour cream would be a good topper as well, but I didn't have any. Mine was a great way to help get rid of some leftover turkey and corn from thanksgiving! The best thing was that it was definitely not boring! Hope this was helpful! Enjoy!!

My husband LOVED this soup! I put two cans of black beans, 4 cloves of garlic, 1/4 tsp paprika instead of cumin and I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Awesome! Garnished with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Oh I also just dumped everything in the crock pot and left it for 6 hours. Never checked it once. Came home served it up and WOW! Delicious and easy! What could be better?!

I followed the intent of this recipe.  My deviations were based on what I had on hand.  My tomatoes were packed with spicy red pepper, I replaced the broth with 12 oz vegetable juice and an equal amount of water and replaced the canned green chilies with a fresh jalapeño sliced. I added some frozen corn just to use it up.  I replaced the shredded Monterey Jack with grated Cojita.  All in all, it was rich and flavorful and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Thanks, Doug!

I followed COOKINMOMMY1's advice but i used chicken stock. I added chopped onion, a can of black beans, a can of corn, one can of stewed tomatoes, a can of green chilies , grape tomatoes, FOUR cloves of garlic minced, the juice of one entire lime, and seasonings, extra cumin and my favorite southwest seasoning. Cooked on the stove for an hour then added about a half cup chopped fresh cilantro 1 1/2 cups of shredded colby-jack cheese, and a cup of sour cream. Stirred and let it simmer for 10 minutes longer. I served mine with sour cream, cheese, chopped green onions, more cilantro, avacado and crushed tortilla chips. Yummmmmm!

Delicious with some changes - I made turkey broth from a smoked turkey carcass instead of using vegetable broth.  (If you don't have a smoker, you could probably use chipotle peppers in place of the chilis.) I also used two tablespoons of fresh cilantro instead of dried.  A definite repeater!

I really loved the tomato, garlic, and onion flavor of the soup. I have never actually cooked the avacado and that was really yummy. I so wish though, that I would have read where it said the soup had a kick. Wow, does it! I was worried about the green chilis and subbed salsa verde. Some other small changes I had to make were using 2 14.5 oz cans of petite diced tomatoes, fresh cilantro for dried, and 1/2 the amount of lemon juice for the lime. I was wondering where the hot kick came from and then realized it might be the cayenne pepper. As I liked the overall fresh flavor, I may make this again and reduce the spices or at least the cayenne. I served it with the cheese suggested and some crushed tortilla chips. Thanks, Doug

Excellent. I sauted the onions, garlic and some bell pepper before following the rest of the recipe. Like many, I used chicken broth instead of veg. Also added some corn. Quick and easy with a very homemade result.

I would have rated this at 4 stars without the toppings, but once the cheese (I used cheddar), tortilla chips, & I saved the avacado's & cilantro for toppings were added, it turned GOOD into GREAT!  This will be my new Post-Thanksgiving Turkey Soup!

Very flavorful soup!  It was too hot for my family so I added 2tsp lemon juice to counteract the cayenne pepper. Also, I added the turkey last so I could strain the chunky veggies out with a slotted spoon after they cooked soft. Then I used my Braun wand mixer to puree them smooth before I added them back to the pot. Then added the turkey and the result was a consistency that was perfect for my picky crew!  Thanks for a great way to use leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.

We LOVED it! Such a great healthy recipe.  We made stock from the rest of the turkey, and it was so good.  I left out the avocado.  I think that tortilla chips with this would be great!

Used 3 15oz cans tomatoes, 5 cloves garlic, minced. Sauteed onions and garlic in broth before adding to crockpot. Used chicken broth and juice of one whole lemon. Cooked in slow cooker on high for 4 hours.

This is a fabulous base recipe...like most of the other reviews, we added a can of black beans and used Rotel instead of plain tomatoes.  Otherwise followed the recipe and it got rave reviews from everyone!  No leftover turkey at this house!

I wouldn't have thought to add the lime juice on my own, but it really brightened the soup.  As others have recommended, I made changes and added red pepper, black beans, corn and used only canned tomatoes (with juice.)  I also added a handful of noodles, but would also love this with rice or tortilla strips.  

I think fresh cilantro atop this soup is key- skip the dried stuff!

How does one go about awarding a GOLD star?! This was a HUGE hit with my husband.  I made the recipe as stated and topped with tortilla salad toppers.  It was wonderful!  What I like the most about this recipe is that you can easily add things to it without compromising the flavor.  Next time I will use chicken breasts and maybe try adding a few black beans and some corn.

This is a really good soup. I varied it a little to use what I had on hand, but the essence was the same. I like that I can vary the heat factor and the recipe is so flexible.

Excellent!!  Perfect for leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I followed other's suggestions of adding a can of drained & washed black beans.  I also added 1/2 cup of fresh salsa and I didn't have the green chile pepper.  Perfect!!  Will definitely make this again after Christmas! TIP: Add turkey at end to avoid it getting dried out.  It is just needs to be reheated, not re-cooked.  I learned this tip from Tyler Florence and he's right!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I did not follow it exactly. I made a few changes, but it turned out great! It was a great way to use leftover turkey from Thanksgiving! I added 1 can of pinto beans, 1 can shoe peg corn. I sauteed the onion with 3 cloves of garlic in EVOO until tender, then I added the broth, beans, roma tomatoes, and corn. I used most of the canned whole tomatoes, but I pureed it before adding it to the soup.  I added a little more than 1/2 tsp of cumin and I also added a little bit of chili powder to taste. I also used fresh cilantro as opposed to dried. I did not add the avocado. I served the soup with sour cream, shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese, and tortilla chips to crumble on the top.  I also made corn bread to serve with the soup.  It was really yummy and it had quite a kick to it!

I made this tonight and want to say that everyone should make this as written!  I did use fresh cilantro because I didn't have dried, and I love lots of cilantro, but other than that I followed the written recipe.  It is great!  It does not need corn or beans, but of course you can add them if you must, but the soup is very tasty and filling as it is.  This is going to be a regular in my house.  Even my picky son loved it!

Awesome and will make again!! I did add the can of black beans as others suggested. I also lessened the cayenne pepper and chilies  but that is just a personal preference.  Wonderful way to use up the left over turkey and not feel like I'm having another meal of turkey leftovers.

I make mine using the turkey carcass to make a stock. Much more flavorful than vegetable broth. I also use fresh chopped jalapeno peppers rather than canned. I sprinkle it with shredded cheddar cheese and tortillas cut into strips like noodles.

This will be a day after Thanksgiving dish for a long time.  It was great!  I substituted the green chilies with jalapenos.  It made it quite spicy (yum) and we topped it with cheese and sour cream.

The photo looks like it has carrots and celery and those aren't mentioned in the recipe. I am going to add to it as in the comments. The soup is on the stove as a work in progress. The photo really should match the recipe, don't you thing?

I also added about a cup of frozen corn and a can of drained black beans. The soup would probably be okay without them, but more like a chunky spicy tomato soup instead of a turkey soup with southwestern flavors. It was amazing with the additions, needed no further alteration. I made it for lunch today, and am going to make it for lunch tomorrow as well. It was quite spicy, but serve it younger diners with sour cream instead of cheese. My 8-year-old son liked it

Made as written this is only spicy tomato soup with a bit of chicken in it. Has some potential, but there are plenty of other soups that provide a a better base.

Loved this soup!  I did, however, make some changes.  I added a can of corn and a can of black beans.  I also used fresh cilantro instead of dried.  Makes a huge difference to use fresh!!  Have also made it with chicken when there was no left over turkey!  Fiance loves it!!

I had some smoked turkey left over and used that I Liked the spices the way they and so did my family. I added more meat and I did add a can of hominey instead of corn and beans to give it that true southwestern/hispanic flavor. It is a simple recipe that is tasty. I didn't have time to make cornbread or even gorditas but I will next time my family has said that this is a keeper recipe and that is a big complement coming from them especally from my son who is studying culinary arts. Remember to always add a little spice to life that is what make it exciting. Thank you Doug Matthews.

I made this soup tonight with my leftover turkey from Christmas.  Boy was this great,easy and fast!  I added a 7oz can of Embassa diced green chiles (a little hotter than normal) and a tablespoon of Chile powder.  I also followed other peoples advice and added a can of black beans rinsed and frozen corn.  I ommitted the roma tomatoes and went with the can of diced.  I served it with a dallop of sour cream and tortilla chips crunched up on top.  My kids even thought it was great.  Thanks Dave this is a keeper and I'll use up all my dark turkey meat this way from now on.

I made some alterations to this one because I'm not huge on tomatoes in my soup. I cut the canned tomatoes in half and omitted the romas. I also used one fresh poblano pepper that I blackened over the open flame of my gas stove rather than the canned peppers. Also, I threw in some ABC pasta at the very end to add some chunkiness.  I cooked this soup in my slow-cooker, and it turned out well--the flavor was just the right amount of spice.

My family enjoyed this soup.  We substituted 2 cups of tomato juice for 2 of the cups of beef broth and fresh cilantro for the dried.  Delicious!

this soup was good but I thought it lacked substance. I think I should have added some rice or some chunky veggies to it to make it more filling. The flavor was good. It was also a little too time consuming for the payoff.

The left over turkey that I was planning on using was thrown out so I had to use chicken instead. I had to use fresh cilantro also because I couldnt find the dried one and I heard the dried version lacks flavor. Over all this was a great recipe. It was full of flavor and the avocado took a little bit of the heat off from the green chiles. It was the perfect balance of flavor and heat. I also added a can of white corn. I loved it and my husband too. He said its worth making again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so easy to make. It's the perfect soup for using up the Thanksgiving turkey. I added black beans and corn. The avacados really make it! It's just so comforting and delicious. I'll always use leftover turkey this way!

This soup was really good.  I made a few minor changes, like used Chicken broth,increased the cumin and used both dried and fresh cilantro.  I also like the posters idea of serving over crushed tortilla chips.  This is definitely a keeper.

Best recipe I've found yet on allrecipies, and I've tried a lot.  I like to add fresh cilantro instead of dried and top with sour cream.  I also like to use chopped instead of whole tomatoes for the canned tomatoes, I think they absorb the flavors faster.  Still a great recipe on it's own though

This soup was awesome! I had to make a few changes because of what I had on hand. I used chicken instead of turkey, chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, omitted the avocado since mine had already gone bad and as so many people suggested, I added a can of rinsed drained black beans and also corn. It was sooo delicious and I think adding the corn and beans made it a much heartier soup. Will definitely make this again. Thanks so much for sharing!

Another great way to use leftover Thanksgiving Turkey. This is a tasty and easy pantry soup. Its a winner with chopped avocado and shredded cheese on top. We all like this soup and considered giving it 5 stars. Its a 4.5 stars recipe for certain!

I used two turkey thighs to make stock and shredded the meat. I added a can of drained black beans. I used several sprigs of fresh cilantro rather than dried.  Did not add avocado or cheese (dietary restrictions). The soup was very good and will definitely make again.

Really enjoyed this soup. I had lots of turkey leftovers so I tripled the recipe. Used bone broth I had made from the turkey carcass. Also used fire roasted diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the whole tomatoes. Added some turmeric also. This recipe is definitely a keeper

Nice way to use up leftover turkey scraps.  I threw it all in a 3qt crockpot, added a can of stewed tomatoes, rinsed and drained black beans, and used turkey  and vegetable broth I had made previously.  Added about 1/4 tspn of chipotle chili powder, and a pinch of cayenne, as I like a little more heat. Set the cooker to low for 8-9 hours.  At 4 hours it started aromatizing the house nicely.

I consider this a soup BASE.  Change: Chicken broth vs veggie.; 3C turkey vs 1 1/2 C; Additions: 15 oz can corn; 15oz southwest style black beans; 1 pack Uncle Ben's Spanish style Ready Rice (Follow instructions and cook for 90 secs prior to adding). Top with cubed avocado and sour cream....NOW it's soup!

I had homemade turkey stock that I used rather than vegetable stock and subbed fire roasted diced tomatoes because I didn’t have whole peeled tomatoes. This recipe is delicious and the family deemed it a keeper. It has just the right amount of spice without being burning hot. Thank you.

I sautéd the onion and garlic first and then added the tomatoes along with the cumin, cayenne and salt and pepper. I also used one whole lime. I thought it was delicious.

It is a great base soup,  I did some modifications for my family's taste:  I had turkey stock.   I used whatever tomatoes I had on hand, dash of chocolate, dash of adobo sauce.  I did not add cheese, but used sour cream, cilantro, and avocado as a garnish.  I put some tortilla slices in near the end of cooking.   Huge hit with the family!!!

I doubled the recipe and added a can of black beans and canned corn (both drained) like suggested. I used fresh cilantro for on top of the soup, as well as tortilla crumbs and other toppings suggested. Because I added extra corn and beans I stripped the lime juice and powdered spices. The family liked it. Doubling was a bit much for 5 people, but we are going to freeze a big container and have leftovers for tomorrow. I suggest mincing the garlic for the crushed chunks was a bit much.

Loved it! Used up the rest of the thanksgiving turkey. I actually froze the batch and brought it to work over the course of a couple of weeks. I wasn’t sure how the avocado would freeze and thaw but it was AMAZING!! A new favorite.

This is delicious!  I put a can of chick peas in it for my vegetarian daughter (we just kept the turkey separate for the meat eaters).  With some warm flour tortillas this meal was perfect!

Great flavors, of course I just use receipts for a guide and made this in a giant crock pot. I used roasted Anaheim's from my garden, celery, and carrots. Cooked down all the left over Turkey Bones from Tday as a start and it helped to use a strainer to get out the bones and such.  No tomato's in mine though, none in the house.  I also put in some wild rice.  Don't limit yourself..

Totally outstanding. The avocado & the cheese make it!  A really nice alternative to traditional turkey soup options & im sure this would be awesome with chicken too.

Spicy, flavorful, and easy to make- unlike a lot of the reviewers, I liked it as is, although I would also consider trying some of the adjustments in future. I feel like it needs a little more of a cooling element to balance out the spiciness, although I did have it with cornbread and that soaked it up really nicely. Maybe just some sour cream on top? Definitely gets my seal of approval!

I followed cookinmommy's suggestions and it turned out great. It's one of those dishes that's better the next day....i found that by day two (and later, as I froze several containers) the flavours greatly intensified.

This is a very good soup, as is.  The avocado, cilantro and lime juice are great garnishes.  So is a dollop of sour cream.

Delicious. I made a couple substitutions however.  I didn't have cilantro or Monterey Jack cheese on hand, so substituted parsley and added a couple dashes of Tapaio sauce for the cayenne pepper, then topped with medium cheddar cheese. 
Mmmmm. This will be my new Thanksgiving turkey left overs recipe.

Seriously delicious. Made a few changes this time (have made as is before). I prefer to use way more garlic, as well as juice of an entire lime or two! We also add a can of black beans and some extra spice. We grow our own spicy peppers and can’t get enough heat. Overall, a great recipe. We make it every year with leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Yum!

This is delicious... my husband loves it! I did take the advice of another reviewer and added corn and pinto beans which I’ll definitely do next time I make this also. I also sprinkled tortilla chips on the top for a little crunch and added a scoop of sour cream.  Yum!

We made this recipie with a few changes and additions because  we didn't have all of the ingredients.  We used turkey broth instead of vegetable broth, diced tomatoes,  Rotel tomatoes with green chilies  because I didn't have a can of green chilie peppers, and  no avocado.  We added left over vegetables and added extra frozen corn to the mix. Simmered until veggies were done.   Topped with a little bit of four cheese Mexican cheese and cilantro.
We would have liked a thicker broth so next time we will add some thickening.  Just a little bit of "bite" very flavorful.  This is a good basic recipie with lots of room to make your own additions and changes.

As is, I think the soup would have been a bit bland.  I added more seasonings, and it was great!  I doubled the garlic and cumin and also added 1 tsp each of oregano and basil,  1/2 tsp of coriander, and about 1 T of dried cilantro.  Also added some frozen corn and 1 can of white beans.  I didn't have canned chilis, so I threw in some crushed red pepper to substitute (probably 1/4 tsp).  We garnished it with avocado chunks, fresh cilantro, lime, and monterrey jack cheese.  The garnishes are what really make this soup taste amazing.  I will definitely make this soup again next year.  It's so good you forget you're having Thanksgiving leftovers.  :-)

I made this twice now since thanksgiving and the first time was pretty much as the recipe went because we didn't have beans and corn to add, and being a foodie, we loved it as written but with hot peppers from our garden added.  It did need more salt but was excellent.  The second time we made it we added the black beans and frozen corn and that added a little depth and more texture. Flavor was excellent both times adding a little here and there.  I was concerned the first time around adding the avocado so early in the cooking but we did and the avocado held up great.  And surprisingly, it held up without coloring for 5 days as we made tons of soup and ate it all week!  It just kept getting better and better!!

Made this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious served with shredded cheese and a little sour cream. This will be a regular to make with leftover turkey. While you could easily add black beans and corn if you wanted more veggies, it was great as is.

This was an unexpected surprise!  I made it to use that leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  It was very good!  My husband really liked it and commented about it several times.  I added a can of black beans and substituted parsley since I didn't have any cilantro.  Will definitely make it again!

This was great and very tasty. I did sauté the garlic and onion first before adding the other things. Also I used fresh cilantro. We crumbled taco chips over with the grated cheese. A great use for leftover turkey.

I thought the soup was great, though I did make some slight changes.  As others have said, I added corn and black beans for more of the Southwestern taste/look.  I also did Rotel tomatoes instead of just the green chilies.   Next time I make it, I'd like to ad Greek yogurt, sour cream, or just a bunch of cheese to make it a little heartier, like a chowder.

Very easy soup to put together, especially with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  Recipe photo shows black beans but they are omitted from actual recipe.  Add one can of drained and rinsed black beans with main ingredients.  Used fresh cilantro.   Mildly spicy with great flavor!

We loved this recipe!  We used the remainder of a turkey breast that my husband smoked on our smoker.  I followed the recipe to a "T" other than using smoked turkey and fresh cilantro instead of dried.   It will definitely be a "do again" for us.

Great recipe! I recommend dicing the whole peeled tomatoes and using 2 cups of turkey, but it's otherwise heavenly!

This is a wonderful recipe and I will make it again. I also added black beans and used fresh rather than dried cilantro. This one is a keeper

I did make some minor changes, but the one big thing I wish I did was cut down on they cayenne.  I like a little spice, but I think 1/2 tsp. of cayenne on top of the chili's is too much for soup.  Next time, I'll try no cayenne and add some from there.

This was absolutely yummy.  I took suggestions from several of the reviewers and added the corn, black beans and fresh cilantro, as well as the dried.  I also used chicken broth.  Put it on a simmer on the back burner, stirred throughout the day and suffered with the delightful aroma until it was ready.  This ended up being a bit of emptying out the freezer and the pantry.  I was easy on the hot spices, since my husband is not a fan of "hot", but he does like spice=flavorful. Thank you original contributor and fellow cooks for the recipe and suggestions.
I will pull out my foodsaver and make up some pouches to go back in the freezer and a couple to go to one of our grandsons to take back to the dorm when he visits.
Thank you so much 
The only drawback is I now have a big pot of delicious soup for just two people.

I had some turkey from Costco and needed to use it up and found this recipe. So glad I did! Am also on a ultra-low carb diet and this worked also.  Sauteed everything in a little olive oil (I did add a zucchini and some spinach, again, cleaning out the fridge) before adding chicken broth (all I had) and then added a small chipotle with a little sauce, perfect heat!  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Made it pretty much to Cookinmommy1's suggestions, turned out great, used one jalapeno and a couple of Anaheim peppers to give a nice bite.  Good one!

After reading some reviews, we added a can of cannellini beans, and a can of corn (both drained).  We chose to top the served soup with chopped cilantro, shredded cheese, and the sliced avocado.  The other ingredients as recommended.  This will now be our go to recipe for leftover turkey.  Could also be very good for an alternative to chili using shredded chicken breasts.  Highly recommend as modified.

My husband does most of the cooking for us, so when I venture into the kitchen, he worries.  When I start by saying, "I found this recipe online . . . " he cringes.  This one, however, restored his faith in me (somewhat).  At first I thought the spices were not enough, but we found the amounts to be very nice to the palate.  I did add black beans and corn, and used chicken instead of turkey.  As my husband is not a fan of avocados, I left that out.  Next time, I may try some tweaks others have suggested here.   This one will definitely be a repeat performance.

After reading the reviews, I decided to make this but also modified the recipe. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable, and chicken instead of turkey. I also added a can of black beans, a can of corn, a can of garbanzo beans, an extra small can of chopped green chillies, extra garlic, and doubled all spices. I also added 2 jalapeños and a small red pepper. I sautéed the chicken with oil, garlic, onion, a bit of the spices, and Tabasco sauce. Omitted the lime due to personal preference. I then made some Spanish rice separately to add to the soup once it was done. Very hearty and yummy!

My husband isn't a big soup eater, so didn't really expect him to love this.   But he did like it!  The changes I made included using chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and I added spinach just because I had a ton of it.  The lime is important and really gives this the brightness it needs.  I, too, put the avocado on top just before serving.  Can't imaging putting it in the soup while it's cooking.  I would like it thicker, like a chili but this was still delicious.  Serve with tortilla or corn chips.

A tasty recipe and awesome use for left-over Thanksgiving turkey!  Would add more veggies next time, corn and zucchini would be delicious. Also, will not cook the avocado next time, came out kind of mushy so would be best just added as a topping along with the cheese.

Just finished eating this recipe and I have to say it turned out awesome. I added the can of black beans and corn as shown in the video and I also added a 6oz can of paste to thicken it up. I will definitely make this again, thank you for sharing the recipe with us!

I made this with a few changes. I did not use fresh tomatoes,cilantro or avocado and I added corn and a can of black beans. It was very good. I recommend using a lot of salt and pepper as it was bland without.

Hubby said that it was very tasty. He is a very picky eater, so this is a big complement. I used Chicken Base, Celery, Corn, and Pinto Beans. I eye-balled it to make a huge batch in the crock pot. Let simmer for several hours (until the onion was tender).

Tried this last night, and it was pretty good.  Had to do some improvising.  I used chicken broth, because that's what was on hand, then diced up a fresh tomato instead of whole canned tomatoes.  Didn't have cilantro or avocado, and eyeballed the spices since I had a lot of turkey to use, and had to increase the broth by about half again the amount.  Then I added some noodles after getting a bit too much cayenne.  Anyway, it made an incredibly tough tasteless turkey breast edible.  In our house it may be known as "Grilled Turkey Disaster Salvage Soup."  :-)  Point is that even with all my substitutions, alterations, and left out ingredients it was still tasty.  Kids ate all of theirs, and DH and I each ate two helpings.

I added 1/2 teaspoon coriander and 1/2 teaspoon dried ancho chile powder. I used my homemade smoked turkey stock and leftover T-day smoked turkey - delicious! If you don't use smoked turkey but want that flavor you could add 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika.

We doubled the recipe and it was a huge hit at a dinner for neighbors after Thanksgiving.  We served with cornbread croutons.  Taste hint, the lime juice is a huge factor in making this a real show stopper.  We poured it on.

Love love love this recipe.   I use it as my go to chicken or turkey soup base.  I've made it exactly to the recipe as well as tweaking it, all are so yummy!    I hate when people review recipes and change it so much and then give it a bad review.....as i said ive made this exactly to recipe and its great as is, but here are a couple  tweaks I recommend.
1.  I've substituted a can of sweet corn for the chili peppers.  I love it spicy but my 9 year old does not.   Tis way she will eat it too!
2.   I fry the onions first.   Caramelizes them nicely.
3.   I've substituted the chilis for diced fresh mushrooms and/ or carrots.
4.   I generally do half chicken no sodium broth and half stock from the chicken or turkey I just made.   Makes it much tastier.    
5.   I chop up the avacado and put it right in there.
6.  I double the chicken or turkey.  I love chunky meaty soups!    
7.  I cook mine in the crock pot.   I do for 8 hours on low and the last half hour on high.

Excellent... I added the black beans and corn and made a big old batch... Everyone in the family loved it, even my rather picky 17 year old.  Going to have to make turkey more often just so we can have this soup!   EXCELLENT ALL AROUND!!!!!

Really enjoyed this with leftover Thanksgiving turkey.
After reading the other reviews I added cannelli beans, had left over butter beans and added a few, if I'd had leftover corn I would have added this too.
The seasonings were perfect.

Very good with a few changes. Used 2 cups of turkey, added black beans and replaced the chiles with a fresh jalapeno. You can also add corn.

superb!  such a nice change from classic "turkey frame soup".  I used a dollop of sour cream rather than the monterey jack cheese and used chopped fresh cilantro - so much better than dried!  This is a keeper. Thanks!

First off, I HAVE to say how grateful I am to find this recipe on here!!  I had more than my feel of turkey sandwiches and sick to death of turkey.  This recipe has the best flavors and my husband loved it.  The only change I made was the whole peeled tomatoes. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead and added a tablespoon of chicken bouillon crystals. Other than that, I followed the recipe down to the cornbread.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!

I made this exactly like the recipe with one exception - I used fresh cilantro.  It WAS FABULOUS!!  The best soup I have ever had.  It was chunky, but it had the best flavor.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Great way to use up every bit of the turkey meat!  I added a can of corn and more onions.  I also used left over vegetables (celery, onions, carrot sticks, a bay leaf) to make own vegetable stock. My family wanted more!

This was good, but I didn't give it 4 stars because without modifications it wouldn't have been as good.  At the halfway point I thought it needed more since it was very tomatoey and brothy and the was about it.  I added some corn (maybe a 1/3 cup) and a can of rinsed black beans.  I also added extra cilantro and cumin.  I was worried about it being too spicy for the kids, so I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon which was plenty.  Topped with cheddar, sour cream, and crushed tortilla chips.

LOVED this soup. I am not a creative cook but I read all the reviews and adjusted the recipe by sauteeing the garlic & onion in olive oil then added the other ingredients...turkey, broth, corn, black beans, seasonings as suggested. I used 1 can of Rotel Mexican flavor and 1 can diced tomatos with green chilis...good and spicy!  I added sour cream after pouring soup into bowls...it was fabulous, next time I will try topping it with guacamole along with the sour cream. My husband loved it as well! It will become a weekly staple during the winter!

Great recipe. A welcome change from cream and gravy based leftover recipes. We like spicy so I used jalapenos in place of the canned chilis.  Will definitely make this again.

This is a great soup and a good way - other than the ordinary - to use that leftover turkey.  I made a few small changes.  Instead of the can of tomatoes and the Roma tomatoes that the recipe called for, I used two cans of original Rotel tomatoes.  Since the Rotel had the chilies already in it, I omitted the green chilies that the recipe called for.   I also used about a tablespoon of fresh cilantro chopped up rather than the dry cilantro.  This was great served with Monterey Jack cheese.  I also used crushed up tortilla chips like crackers.  Will definitely use this recipe again with leftover turkey.

I liked it, didn't LOVE it. I am still trying to figure out yet what exactly it IS I would change to bump it up a notch. After reading the previous reviews I think maybe using chicken or turkey broth would help....and maybe the black beans and cilantro too. I only used 1/4 tsp of the cayenne since hubby doesn't love spicy stuff...but that wasn't really the issue. I have a bunch of leftovers. I think I will try adding the beans and cilanto to them...... 
Update>tried doctoring the leftovers. Much better! Added another tsp of cilantro, a can of black beans, a pkg of creamed corn, and 1/4 tsp each of chili, cumin and coriander. This version was a big hit...

This soup was excellent and a wonderful way to use the turkey leftovers.  I did add one 14.5 oz. can of drained and rinsed black beans, and one 14.5 oz. can of creamed corn.  Instead of vegetable broth I used 4 cups of water with about 2 tbps of chicken soup base but I think either vegetable or chicken broth or fresh chicken or turkey broth would work.  I ladled the soup into crocks and put shredded cheddar on top and melted it for a few minutes in the oven.  I then added the avocados and sour cream.  I will definitely make this again with either leftover chicken or turkey.

Great recipe!!! Wonderful way to use that extra turkey giving it a completely different flavor from Thanksgiving. Did the recipe just as written except added a bit more turkey and a can of black beans. Put the avocado in the individual bowls as some don't like it. The crumbled tortilla chips, Mexican mix cheese and sour cream were perfect on top!! It was fabulous!!! One complaint, I should have doubled the recipe to have more left today =( Oh yea, and I had to use Italian tomatoes as that's all I had in the house and it was still wonderful.

One of my favourite soup recipes! Great to use with leftover turkey or chicken. I don't usually have veg. broth on hand so I always use chicken broth. Super quick and easy to make. Avocado and fresh cilantro make this soup outstanding! Be sure to try this one!!

This soup was excellent!  My husband loved it with just a bit of shredded cheese on top.  I cooled the spice off a bit with some sour cream and cheese - very tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly (almost).  I used homemade turkey broth rather than the vegetable broth because I prefer the flavor.  I also used fresh cilantro.  Other than that - I didn't make any changes.  Next time I will add some black beans just for a bit of variety.  Definitely a keeper - this will be a day after Thanksgiving tradition in our house.

This soup is so incredibly tasty, I have a hard time not going back for third and forth servings.  I didn't have the romas nor the chile peppers to add one time, and found the soup was just as tasty.  It's quick and easy to make too. Thanks, Doug.

I had a bag of cut-up leftover turkey that I had frozen, and this soup was perfect for it! I used chicken broth instead of vegetable, and didn't add the avocado (cuz I personally don't like 'em).  Turned out well!  And I agree with other reviewers... it's great with added beans or corn.  Very good... will definitely make again!

This was really good. A very different taste than my usual turkey soup.  I added a can of black beans as previously suggested.  I couldn't find avacados so I went without it and it was good.

This was fabulous!!  What a great way to use the leftover turkey and turkey carcas from holidays.  I made a few minor changes.  I used fresh cilantro instead of dried, as we love cilantro in my house.  I also added 3 avacados, rather that one.  I did not add the plum tomatoes, and chopped up the whole tomatoes.  I served this with fresh tortilla chips.  I'm going to try it with chicken next, as this is a recipe we'll want to eat again.

I was so excited to make this and didn't love it as much as I thought.  Don't get me wrong it was still very good.  I didn't get a chance to get avocado so maybe that's where I went wrong. I will probably try again.

This soup was awesome!! I didn't have that high of expextations but we were practically licking our bowls clean. I skipped the avacado and used diced tomatoes instead of whole. I also omitted the roma tomatoes (didn't miss 'em) and added some frozen corn. I'm going to have to make another pot for tomorrow as this one is gone!
