You know, I just love this pie. I've made it many times and it always goes before the regularly crusted pumpkin pie. I don't waste my money on biscuit mix, I make my own from 1c. flour, 1/4t. salt, 2t. baking powder, 1/8t. baking soda. Works just fine. It's also my pancake base. 
This is an awesome pie recipe. Somebody described it as a custard this Thanksgiving. I'm making it for a CHRISTmas party tomorrow. We're driving for 2.5 hours and this baby travels well! 
Also, I make mine in a 13x9" cake pan and double the recipe. Forget Libby's this is the best!

This turned out awesome!  I used fresh pumpkin puree, skim milk, 1/2c. splenda, 1/4c. white sugar, 1/2 c. low-fat bisquick mix, a lot of vanilla and pumpkin spice. Light, healthy, and everyone raved about it! :)

This is really good.  A great pie...but without the crust. I've starting making this as a snack for my son. He's a picky eater, but enjoys this with cool-whip on top.  I love old fashioned pumpkin pie but this is a great alternative when your short on time.  Thanks Anita.

The pie was nice and smooth and the crustless aspect was unique but it had WAY too much ground cloves for our family.  I'd reduce it to 1/4 t.

Nice and easy. Here's a tip: I made three pies for Thanksgiving and used aluminium pie pans. They weren't 9" across - they claimed they were 8 and 3/4" but two recipes made three pies. Also they were very flimsy for this recipe so I finally figured out that it cut way down on the mess if I put the tin on the oven rack and THEN poured the batter into the tin.

Easy to make and good.  However, don't expect a crust to appear.

This is the best recipe I've found since I managed to lose my favorite cookbook. The only suggestion I would have is using evaporated milk instead - I've found it's best for pumpkin pies.

I've been using this recipe for years!  I substitute evaporated milk (one 12 oz can) for the regular milk. Put all ingredients in blender - starting with liquid ingredients - and blend on high for a minute.  Easy clean-up!

This is the pumpkin recipe I have been seeking for a long time! Delicious, excellent texture. It really does make its own "crust," if you bake it long enough and allow it to caramelize. It doubles easily, using the 29 oz can of pumpkin puree.  I ommitted the butter, used 2 cups of vanilla soy milk and 1 cup of apple cider (carrot juice works well, too), substituted 3 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 teaspoon ginger for all of the spices listed.  I only used 1 cup of sugar (I don't like it too sweet).  I doubled the other items (eggs, biscuit mix), but kept the 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it whenever I get the pumpkin jones!

I give this 4 stars for ease.  It also tasted good.  However, my husband was sad to see that there was no real crust.

This was a very good pumpkin "pie".  I used all lactose free products since my sister is lactose intolerant.  It didn't really make a crust, but it was wonderful.

This is a very nice tasting recipe if you are looking to solely have pumpkin pie filling.  I thought that the description was misleading in saying that this recipe created its own crust, as it really did not have any crust, hence the 3 star rating.  This would probably be a great recipe for those who are on a low carb diet.  Thanks for sharing.

Great pie!  Didn't even miss the crust.  I made my own bisquick mix as someone recommended.  My husband and I almost ate the whole pie in one day!  I did cut back on the spices the second time I made it.

I cannot eat gluten, so substituted Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free biscuit mix for the standard variety. A 15 oz. can of pumpkin was made one pie. I used 1/2 cup sugar with 1/4 cup brown to round out the flavors. 1/4 teaspoon mace with 1/4 teaspoon cloves in place of the 1 t. allspice and 1 t. cloves softened the spice flavors. My husband liked this impossible pie version better than the family one-crust recipe -- It is now our go-to Pumpkin Pie recipe.

This Pumpkin pie recipe is delicious and healthy!  Crust was really not necessary at all. I found that refrigerating the pie after cooling then the slicing and heating maintained the form of the slices best. Warm pie tastes better!

I followed the recipe as written.  The taste was good.  The addition of bisquick to the traditional recipe did not create a crust and the texture was not very smooth.

I've been using this recipe for about 6 years and it's my favorite pumpkin pie! I wouldn't say it makes it's own crust, but crustless and fantastic! I up the spices because I love clove and all spice but other than that I follow it exactly. I use the biscuit mix substitute suggested by crinklebug and I always make my own puree. This pie is delicious, easy and keeps well if you prefer to make ahead - what's not to like?!?

DELICIOUS! I didn't miss the crust (or extra calories) at all! I used a do-it-yourself version of pancake mix (from another's comment) and it set perfectly and tasted amazing.

This recipe is very good, but just the basic ingredients for all kinds of "Impossible" Pies. Cocoa and choc chips make nice layers of goodness and any kind of fruit added instead of the pumpkin is easy and delish. I throw everything in a blender and pour it into a greased pan. It is my go to recipe when unexpected guests stop by.If you don't have sour cream or yogurt, use a little more milk and an extra egg. I have been using this recipe for 30 years and it never fails.

Yep it's too spicy but I didn't mind! Just cut down on the spices and it is super easy and really good! Not too bad for you either!

as others have said, had too much cloves for my tastes, but it was easy and satisfying -- i'm going to try it again with 1/2tsp cloves, otherwise it was great!
