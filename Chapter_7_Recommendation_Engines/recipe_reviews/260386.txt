Great flavor! Instead of a chili seasoning packet, I used a couple tablespoons of Penzey's Chili 9000 seasoning.   The bacon was a nice addition, however the flavor was almost undetectable, so next time I will add a few more slices. I also recommend using more than just a "pinch" of garlic and onion powder.    More importantly, there is no liquid whatsoever in this recipe, so I recommend not draining the tomatoes (I kept it), and I also added about 1/2 cup of broth. Even still, it could use a bit more liquid so next time I will use 1 cup of broth or tomato sauce.  I didn't have time to wait for my crockpot, so after browning the meat in my InstantPot, I cooked everything on the chili setting for 25 mins. It came out perfectly done! The other thing to mention is that these portions are rather small, so I'd say this makes 6 servings max.

I loved it!!!   I made a mistake and used 3 bell peppers instead of 1 1/2 when reducing the servings to 4--so I upped the tomatoes to a 28 oz can (I used crushed/peeled as it is what I had) didn't add the tomato paste as it was tomato-ey enough.  I'm Keto so I made the Chili Seasoning Mix I instead of the packaged chili mixes as I couldn't find one that didn't have added sugars/starches.  My husband isn't Keto and he enjoyed this as well. !  I also adjusted the cooking instructions a bit--I used the my instant pot on saute for the meat and veggies and then the slow cooker function--with vent closed and on low temp  when I added all of the ingredients to the pot for two hours.

I usually don’t like chili but this is amazing! I’ll admit I did omit the sauces and used a jar of marinara instead but it was still soooo good!

I didn't drain anything and included the grease from the bacon.  Slow simmered it on the stove for about an hour instead of the slow cooker.  Delicious!

I added a pound of sweet  Italian sausage to the recipe and also sliced up 2 jalapeno peppers in addition to the main ingredients!  I used my own chili powder instead of the pre-mixed.

Very hearty and filling. I used ground beef because that is what I had on hand. I also added 2 cups of water because I like it to have a little juice. My children even gobbled this up! I was searching for meals that would be heavier so my husband will not get discouraged on keto and he absolutely loved this too!

Easy and good. Had to adapt for my family's taste - cut the green pepper to one, doubled the diced tomatoes (included the liquid), added a small can of tomato sauce and a cup of low sodium chicken broth - we like saucy chili!  Used low-sodium chili seasoning as well as a heaping 1/2 teaspoon each of onion and garlic powder. Cooked the pork on the stove - drained it and put it in the pot - cooked the bacon - drained it and put it in the pot - sauteed the green peppers and onion in the skillet - added it to the pot. Used my Mealthy pot (similar to an insta-pot) as suggested by another reviewer and cooked it for 25 minutes using the chili setting.  Served it over rice and added a little sour cream (and snacked on it by scooping it up with tortilla chips). Will definitely make again!

Pork tenderloin in cheap, so we ground our own.  Ground some bacon with it, to add some fat. We loved this recipe, and will do it again. May add beer next time.

This is so simple and delicious. I added Parmesan cheese to mine and was able to bring it to work for lunches. Boyfriend is not a fan of chili...but he devoured it. :)

I had lots of ground pork to use up so I decided to try this recipe.  I think it lacks some seasonings though and thus the 4 star rating.   I prefer chili with a mixture of beef and pork sausage.

This recipe is really good! I only made some slight changes. I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced (Im not a fan of chunky tomatoes). I also added a little bit of broth from a recommendation of a reviewer saying that the chili might dry out easily. We loved this chili, and one last recommendation is to use some tapatio hot sauce. That really enhanced the flavor of the dish. Thanks for the recipe!

OMG! This stuff is good!  Especially for no bean chili.  Relatively simple to make. The downside is the 5-6 hours it takes in the crock-pot.  I added a couple more strips of bacon and added slightly more paste and a cup of water to make it a thinner, more tomato tasting sauce. I also added some oregano and put more spices than the recipe says. A "pinch" is not enough for me.  I will definitely make this again!

Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe.  I tweaked the chili somewhat, based on others' reviews.  I used a veggie and chicken broth base, nixed the bacon, decreased the amount of green peppers, onions, hamburger, and tomato paste.  I increased the amount of pork.  I'm sorry for changing your wonderful recipe so much, but I got to cook for my family's taste buds.  The chili turned out amazing.  I am currently hoping for UPS to deliver the keto bread today, so I can enjoy the wonderful chili with keto bread.  Thanks for posting the recipe!

I added ground beef and jalapenos.  Huge hit.  Very hearty and makes a nice addition to our keto recipes.

Very good, I did use a mixture of Jimmy Dean ‘sage’ sausage & ground beef along with the bacon. I also added about a half cup chicken broth. My husband is doing keto, but I’m not, so I scooped out some of the mixture and put into a pan with some pinto beans, then added a little extra seasoning to compensate for the addition of the beans (salt & pepper, garlic & onion powders) Thanks for the recipe!

I added a cup of chicken broth to make sure nothing would burn while I went on a hike. I also subbed bell peppers for a serano chili and used breakfast sausage and spicy  italian sausage instead of regular ground pork. I also added cumin and a bay leaf. When I got back from my hike, it smelled like pizza! I topped it with some cheese. Glad to have it waiting for me.

I have just started Keto so I was excited to make this recipe.  I really liked it.   My personal preference would be to add some more pork or maybe half  port and half hamburger.  That way you won't miss the beans so much.  All in all, it was pretty satisfying.  I will make it again!

I did a 50/50 mix of pork and turkey.  Subbed 2 Cubanelle peppers and a habanero because I dislike bell pepper.  Also added a few diced up stalks of celery.  It's fantastic!

yummy and easy! I was worried about the lack of liquid, so I read some reviews and agreed to add a little broth...this next time, I won't drain the tomatoes - I think it needs it - especially for a slow cooker - but so good!

Easy, healthy and delicious! I am not a chili fan but this seemed really easy to make so I decided to try it and I’m glad I did!
