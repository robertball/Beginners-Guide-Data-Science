This was actully a very tasty cake though the name led me to believe that I might not like it since I don't like gumdrops and the ingredients sounded like they would taste strange together. However this cake was amazing! It tasted similar to my Christmas fruitcakes. All of the people who came for dinner and tried this cake said that they had never eaten anything like it but liked it very much. The only thing I changed was the amount of gum drops. I would add a little less but that is just my personal tastes. Also watch the cake carefully in the oven since its edges brown very quickly! Thanks a bunch Carol!
