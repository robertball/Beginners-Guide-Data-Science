I had no expectations of liking this myself. However I used a habernero flavored tortilla wrap fresh salsa green red and yellow pepper. Had no taco seasoning so I used some Chipotle Chili Powder and a little siracha. Wrapped some in plain tortillas for people who don't like spicy - I announced I had them at work and in less than 30 minutes they were GONE. I loved the habernero wrap gave it just the right kick. Will make these again for a party for certain!

I've made these a few times for pitch-ins and they are always a hit! I also leave out the olives.

Just made these and stuck them in the fridge for tomorrow night. Our 3rd year in a row making them for NYE. Can't say enough good about them! They are a big hit every time.

I omit the olives as I'm not a huge fan of them. I also add a little bit of cayenne pepper.

I made these for a Christmas Eve buffet and they seemed to go over well. I did make them the day before so they would stay together better. I used habernero-lime tortillas and some plain. For personal preference I did make some changes. I subbed salsa for the picante sauce and used red and green chopped peppers in place of the olives. I added some chopped green onions and skipped the green chilies. Thinking it could use a little spice I added a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that was a mistake. I like spicy and that made them too spicy for me. It would have been fine with the just the medium salsa I used. A good recipe that has unlimited options as to what can be added. I wouldn't stray from veggies though.

We substituted some of the ingredients and it was wonderful. I'm doing a cooking class with individuals with intellectual disabilities and this was a great recipe to start with. Everyone loved it.

Quick and easily made with ingredients usually on hand. This time though I didn't have picante sauce. Just chopped a tomato to substitute. A little milder this way -- not that they are that spicy. They were very popular with the kids!

Didn't have garlic powder. Subbed cayenne pepper. It was a hit at my tailgate. Works great to make the night before

These are quite good. Made as-is with more salsa to dip in when serving.

Didn't add the picante sauce instead just dipped in salsa afterwards. Would have tasted great dipped in guacamole too.

I threw in some cilantro just because I had some on hand. Great make ahead for a baby shower in this case. Can't go wrong!

This was good. Made it for myself to have at home but yes like the description says would be suited more as a appetizer for a gathering. I'm tempted to do that. Thanks for the recipe.

Omit the taco seasoning. I found it too overpowering.
