Previous reviewer: Don't ruin a recipe's rating just because it was given a wrong title. MANY families use the terms 'stuffing' and 'dressing' interchangeably. Mine included.

It sounds delicious, tho i haven't made it yet. Off the top of my head  i would probably use Pepperidge Farm white bread for the sweet taste and the heavier texture than most soft breads or a French bread that is a few days old. Otherwise, i can almost taste how good it will be!

Oyster  Dressing  is  a delicious  addition to  any thanksgiving  meal. This  is  a  keeper. I do however make this  using  pepperidge  Farms Seasoned  white  bread  cubes. The  reviewer Bipeman is  incorrect. This is  aptly named. He  may call it  what  he  prefers.. Some  parts  of the  country call this  stuffing  regardless  of the  fact it  is  not stuffed in anything. The  two names  are interchangeable. Rating  it  poorly  because  others  call it  dressing  is  ridiculous. Just  because  someone calls  it  by  a  different  name, does  not  mean  it is  incorrect., or  that  it  diminishes how  good this recipe  is. It is  a definite keeper!

I make this recipe every year for Thanksgiving.  As I do not put it into the bird, it is known as dressing.  I agree with Valorie that the title should not result in a one star rating.  I cut this recipe in half and I use only half of the oysters because of cost factors.  I make this in a crock pot and it is awesome. I do cheat and use stuffing/dressing mix instead of cutting up the bread.
