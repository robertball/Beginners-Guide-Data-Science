As with others, I used basmati rice and added the peas.  One hint for getting the rice to brown: after cooking it (I use a steamer), allow the rice to cool completely before frying it.  I found this technique in another fried rice recipe and it really makes a difference.

One of the best things about fried rice is there is no wrong way of making it. You can pretty much put whatever you want in it. I always use Peas, carrots, and onions for my veggies. And whatever meat i have on hand.. Diced ham is always good, or shrimp. chicken, Or whatever meat you have left over, and eggs of course. It always turns out best if the rice is @ room temp. when cooking.Prevents it from getting mooshy on you. Even letting the rice set overnight.I always use a lil bit of soy sauce and salt as well.I have experimented with diff. grains of rice. I find that the short sticky rice, set at room temp. works the best. Unless you like the "fall apart" type of fried rice, then use long grain. The choice is yours :)Have fun

This fried rice was awesome! I served it with General Tsaos Chicken, so I ommited the chicken and mushrooms. The frying of the rice is an exercise in PATIENCE. It takes quite a while, and you may have to add more butter. Using white rice that has been refridgerated for 24 hours is key! Also, we used 4 eggs, 'cause we like them. I mixed them up in a bowl and poured them directly over the rice during the end of cooking/frying. Perfect! My brother is from NYC and said it was just as good as any take out in the city!!!!!

A perfectly pleasant fried rice dish.  I marinated my chicken for about a hour in a soy sauce mixture (with some other Asian flavorings added in:  garlic, ginger, sesame oil, etc.), which gave the chicken a nice flavor.  Oh, and like other reviewers, I needed substantially more than a tablespoon of soy sauce at the end.

Try making the rice ahead, and refrigerating it - it gets to soft if it isnt chilled first.

After adding real bacon bits, peas,a little freshly grated ginger, a little more soy sauce, and eliminating the mushrooms, this rice was pretty good. Thanks April.

This is a great base recipe. I've made it a few times now and always add something different. I've tried water chestnuts, peas, salad shrimp, even bacon bits. I haven't come up with the perfect fried rice recipe yet but when I do, this recipe will be my base.

I would skip this recipe.  It is very bland, needs a lot of additions.  I added quite a bit of soy sauce, peas, and carrots.  Always make sure the rice is cold before you fry it, otherwise it will be sticky.  Also, the rice didn't fry very well .... it stayed way too soft - not like the restaurants.

This was a pretty good recipe, although we ended up adding more soy sauce than the recipe called for because there wasn't enough flavor. I enjoyed making it, though, and it was very easy.

This is a simple, quick and very good recipe.  Instead of using mushrooms and green onions, I used peas and I sauteed some white onions until they were transparent and browning at the edges. I couldn't get my rice to fry very well, but after adding the chicken and vegetables and the soy sauce, I couldn't tell the difference. My fiance loved it, too!

Had leftover onion rice (long-grain rice cooked with chicken broth and onions) and chicken so I opted to make Chicken Fried Rice for lunch the following day.  This recipe was a fantastic start to my meal.  I added peas and shredded carrots.  I scrambled the eggs using the same pan by just pushing the rice, veggies and chicken to the sides and cooking the eggs in the center.  Made clean up that much easier.  I also added seasoned pepper for a bit of extra flavor.  My boyfriend and I both thought it was wonderful.

Darn Good. Not so hot on presentation (needs veggies to give it more color), but the flavor was perfect. I'd never made fried rice before, and I think I found a good 'first recipe'! Update; made this again and added a can of peas and some carrots. Used brown rice this time too. Turned out excellent!

This dish is in desperate need for some more veggies to make it "prettier" and have more substance. Halfway through browning the rice, I added a thawed pkg of "broccoli stir-fry veggies" (which have broccoli, mushrooms, onions, & red peppers). There are other fried rice recipes I prefer over this but this dish was good for lunch. With my other favorites available, I can't say I'd make this again BUT it was good. Thanks April.

I made this with brown rice, low fat margarine, light soy sauce, and lots of veggies (snow peas, extra mushrooms, sprouts, carrots...etc.), and Eggbeaters.  It was very tasty and healthy!

I am giving this 5 stars not because it was perfect, but because it gave me a simple recipe to start with.  Others just overwhelm me and I end up not even trying them.  This gave me the basics to start with and now I can experiment with all sorts of things!

Made this yesterday.  A fabulous dish, but lacking something I love in my fried rice.  Whether it be Chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, etc. I need at least 2 garlic cloves (8 servings) in my fried rice.  I also cooked my rice 6-8 hours prior to meshing the dish together.  I like my rice a bit sticky but trying to brown it right out of the saucepan is tough for me (moderate experience.)  I like to brown my rice after its been cooked for awhile, no longer steaming is my general rule.  Other than those to slight mods. I give this a 4 star and will be making it again.

I am only giving this 3 stars because I made many of the changes suggested by others.  I did marinate this chicken before cooking in soy sauce, garlic and ginger.  I added an extra egg because 2 didn't look like enough.  I also added peas and diced carrots which I only briefly steamed so they would be crunchy still.  I did let the rice cool after cooking as so many stated and I think it made all the difference-  I've had many unsuccessful attempts with fried rice before.  I had to use way more soy sauce than stated in the recipe, and my husband was still adding more to his helping.  Lastly, I used canola oil instead of butter, which I needed more than stated in recipe, to get rice to brown.  With the changes I made we loved it!

I don't know what makes this recipes SO good (it's just rice and soy sauce flavors!), but it is! Thanks for giving me a recipe that I'll be making over and over using lots of veggies. You won't even need to write this recipe down - do it once and it's a breeze the next time b/c you improvise as you go.

I loved this recipe, my husband loved it and my 4 year old who is very picky loved it.  Thank you so much.  The only thing I did different was brown the chicken in the soy sauce also to give it more flavor. It was perfect.  My husband came home from work the next day and hoped I hadn't eaten the rest for lunch.  He never does that :)  Thanks again, Sabrina

This dish is just begging to have things added.  Like many of the reviewers I added some vegetables and made it a meal.  As stated in a review below, this takes a BIG pan.

It was okay at best.  Very bland, way too much rice, vegetables were way to crunchy...

Super great recipe. Like how fast and easy it is. Just what I was looking for. Changed a few things to make up for a few ingredients I didn't have on hand the first time, still turned out good. Second time, closer to recipe, and even better.

I just prepared this meal tonight and it was a hit! I chilled the rice before frying it so it wouldn't too soft and I added chopped brocolli instead of mushrooms and green onions. It was delicious! Thanks for this wonderful recipe! :)

I reallyyy didn't care for this. If were to try again I would cook teh rice in advance and let sit in the fridge so that when time to cook it, it doesn't clump together in a sticky mush.

I loved this recipe. This is starter for fried rice. Be creative and add other things...carrots, peas, or corn. We added carrots instead of mushrooms and I used egg beaters for the egg and added just a bit of soy sauce! it was so good!! The kids loved it too. Other users were right when saying you have to do it slow. It does take awhile and  using cold pre-cooked rice is key!

A good basic recipe. Double the add-ins. Used cold rice and a rotisserie chicken for ease.

My husband and 2 girls loved this recipe. I used 2 cups of cooked, chopped chicken, and I know this is unhealthy, but I used quite a bit of bacon grease to fry the rice in, as 1 measly tablespoon of butter is not near enough. I fried half the rice, and removed it from my nonstick skillet while frying the other half. If you don't use a nonstick skillet with this recipe, forget about it as the rice will only stick to the  bottom and not brown. When I put in my mushrooms and onion, I nudged all the rice over a bit, and sauteed the veggies in the bacon grease. Lastly, I used 2 Tbsp. soy sauce instead of just 1; use only 1 and your rice will be super bland. Very yummy stuff.

This recipe is definitely a good start, but it needs a lot. 
definitely more soy sauce, i would use at least 2 more tbsp. 
also, when you make the egg, add salt and pepper otherwise it comes out very bland.
when making the rice, i like to add: white pepper, salt, a tiny bit of extra butter,and for anyone who has them, a few dashes of sesame oil, and sesame seeds, to give it a flourish of additional chinese taste.
Definitely the best to use jasmine rice, if you have a rice cooker, then let it cool in there for about an hour. otherwise, it's best you sit rice for a few hours in the fridge before cooking.
I also like adding garlic, chilis, and extra soy to the actual chicken.

Great base recipe for beginners like me, thanks for posting.  I am a flavour and spice junkie, so I tweaked the recipe a little.  I seasoned my rice with white pepper, soya sauce and a dash of sesame oil.  Refigerated day old rice works great.  With the omelette, I flavoured the eggs with white pepper and fish sauce before scrambling.  To make this a one dish meal, I sauteed some frozen vegies in garlic and with a chilli before adding the rice, chicken, eggs and onion back to the pan.

Makes great leftovers and is also a useful recipe for using up whatever is in the fridge!

My husband loved this dish. I gave it four stars because I thought something was missing. I kinda cheated and took a short cut with the rice. I used cold cooked rice and threw it back in the same pan  I cooked the chicken in. Used one more tblspn of soy than it called for and oil instead of butter. My family wants me to make this on a regular basis.

As is, it's 4 stars. It comes out much better if you use steamed jasmine rice (the rice sticks together better). I also added some broccoli and garlic I stir fried. Definitely be a little more generous with the soy sauce. My picky 5 year old loves this.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I made two small changes - I cooked 1 1/2 cups of rice and I cooked it in water boiled with a low-fat chicken bouillion cube. I did use a bit more soy sauce (that's up to what you like, however) and next time I may use half a regular yellow onion instead of a whole one (green onions are difficult to find here). Thanks!

This recipe is pretty good blueprints for fried rice.  Although, my rice was sticking to the pan which I was hoping wouldn't because of refridgerating.  I thought it needed some other spice or herb though. I wanted Basil but they were out at the store. Will make this  again but, will add fresh basil next time.

Sorry but this was awful & bland.  Barely had more flavor than a bowl of plain white rice.  I tried everything I could think of to give it flavor but nothing worked.

The rice must be cooked until there is no liquid left, then fluffed with a fork and allowed to dry in fridge over night, before frying. The basic recipe is great, the technique is somewhat lacking though. I use many fried rice recipe's and fried rice needs to have resting time or it can be clumpy, even though it tastes good. It is a great use of left over rice.

I really cannot believe that there was anyone who didn't like this recipe...it's delicious!! I did add A LOT more soy sauce, and white onions instead of green, but besides that it was truly wonderful!! Try it with brown rice too, it works even better.

I made this last night and it's the first time I've ever made fried rice.  My husband couldn't stop eating it, but as others, I did make some alterations.  First, I used basmati rice and only used 1 cup uncooked (which makes approximately 3 cups cooked).  I stir fried the chicken in olive oil and used yellow peppers, zucchini and red onions for veggies (that's all I had, but what makes fried rice so much fun!).  I also cooled the rice before frying, however, it partially stuck in the fry pan.  I added some chicken broth to keep from sticking and like others have reported, my rice never really browned.  And, for a finishing touch, I sprinkled a very small amount of sesame oil over the dish to add additional Asian flavor.  Thank's April for a great start to many more nights of Fried Rice dishes!

This recipe requires a BIG pan to stir fry it all.  Other than that I thought this recipe was pretty good.  My husband liked it a lot, but I don't think I'll make this again.  It was A LOT of food for just him and I.  (I guess I could split it in half next time)  But all around I gave it a 4.  Thanks!!

This was delicious! I didn't scramble the eggs in a separate skillet. Instead, I scrambled them in with the rice. I also added a lot more soy sauce (low-sodium of course). This would be great with shrimp or just with vegetables for the vegetarian eater. This dish is light on the tummy, not like some restaurant versions!

I used this recipe as a guide for my own. I made a some tweaks; of course fried rice can be made so many different ways. I used 2 chicken breasts fried in butter, 3 cups of white rice, peas, diced yellow onions and carrots, soy to taste, 4 scrambled eggs. I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it. It came out great!

I added two tablespoons of soy sauce and sprinkled a few drops of sesame oil into the pan as I was combining everything, then stir-fried it all for a couple of minutes to blend the flavors. It was delicious - did not need anything else.

This was a hit with the youngest, so I would definitely make it again.  I used leftover basmati rice that had cooled in the fridge overnight and added peas (frozen, but slowly sauteed over medium heat for inclusion).  I also used bottled mushrooms that I had washed, dried and then seared before also adding in the end step.

This recipe was a good base for a spectacular dish. I saute onions, peppers(green, red and yellow) with celery in olive oil. Then I fried the rice and added peas and the eggs. I did not add chicken because I served this recipe with chicken.

This was really easy, and super yummy.  The only modifications I made were to season the chicken with garlic salt and teriyaki sauce, and it came out fabulously.

I've never been any good at fried rice.  I've tried to do it by myself and failed, but this recipe was easy, and what a wonderful result!  Fried rice without a wok.  Love it, thanks for sharing :)

I made this twice, and will probably make it again, but it didn't come out like a restuarant quality fried rice.  It was too moist, both times, and bland.  I used a lot more soy sauce than listed on the recipe.

this fried rice dish took no time at all-i added regular onions and carrots and i even added a little bit of chopped up ham in there, too. i think whatever u have on hand would work for this one.

This rice is the absolute best ever!!  As others suggested I cooked the chicken in the salt and butter and added teriyaki sauce.  I also had to use alot more butter to fry the rice than the recipe called for.  My family doesn't like mushrooms or onions so I left those put, but I did use onion powder.  I had to triple the amount of soy sauce for our tastes.  The only other suggestion I have is to make sure that you use a very large skillet, this is going to make alot of rice.  It also reheats well in the microwave the next day.

I REALLY liked this fried rice!  I made it w/ 7 green onions, 2 large, grated carrots, some frozen peas and carrots, a can of waterchestnuts and I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used 2 cans of mushrooms.  Plus I added a lot more than 1 T. of soysauce.  Very good.

I also marinated my chicken in teriaki as someone else suggested.  This was my first attempt at fried rice and I couldn't get the rice "fried". I'm not sure if I didn't let it cook long enough in the frying pan or what?  I did cook the rice early in the day and let it cool before making the recipe (as someone else suggested!!)  I added some frozen peas and carrots and more soy.  It tasted good, but would have been better if the rice was "fried." This could have been my fault though, and not the recipes.  Nice flavor with the extra soy.  Otherwise too bland for me!

This was the best fried rice I have ever had! My family and friends loved it! 
I did do something a little different....after cubing the chicken, I marinated it for about four hours in teryaki sauce with a couple dashes of soy sauce, using just enough to coat all the chicken. When it was time to cook, I put the chicken into my wok with melted butter, lightly browned, and only had to add a little more soy sauce (less than the recipes calls for) after adding the rice and did not add the salt at all. The result was a nicely seasoned fried rice that was not too salty.

Thanks so much for sharing April...this is a keeper!

Excellent tasting chicken fried rice!  You have to play with this one as it required a bit more butter and oil.  I used butter, oil, and soy sauce while cooking chicken, vegetables, and browning the rice.   When frying it does sap up that 1 tbsp of butter rather quickly, so you have to improvise a bit, and add extra butter, oil, or soy when necessary.  If you do this, it turns out great!  I just sampled it and am about to eat it...it's great!  Have fun with it as you cook it..don't be too parnoid about exact uses of butter or oil or soy, you'll most likely use more...great recipe!

My husand and I love this fried rice.  It takes a little TLC during cooking, but you can add or leave out whatever your heart desires.  I always cook the rice (we use brown rice for a healthier twist) ahead of time and put in the fridge or even freezer to cool.  I tend to cook the chicken in a soy sauce/oil combination to give the chicken extra flavor.  I also add additional light soy sauce while frying the rice.  We love eggs so we always use 3 for this recipe.  Add whatever veggies you like- we've added fresh snow peas during the last couple minutes of cooking the chicken and it was great!  You probably won't need to add the salt if you use soy sauce or your blood pressure will hit the roof!  I'm sure you will love this recipe!  Thanks April for sharing this with us!

I liked this rice better than our favorite Chinese restaurant's!  I cooked the rice ahead and let it chill overnight. I added some chicken broth while browning the rice, threw in a little extra chicken and mushrooms and light soy sauce to taste, 4 eggs instead of two, and added some bean sprouts and this was VERY tasty!

I have made quite a few recipes from allrecipes and this is the first one that turned out badly.  Maybe the directions need to be more precise, as I did follow all the directions and wound up with mushy goopy rice with not a lot of flavor.  The house smells good, but the rice went straight into the sink/garbage disposal.  This was my first fried rice dish, so maybe that is why.

This recipe just didn't work for me. I chilled the rice as others suggested but I couldn't get it to fry. I was using sesame oil in a hot wok. I've done lots of chinese stir frying but never fried rice before. Rice began sticking so I added wine to deglaze and wound up with mushy rice. It was edible, but very bland. Had to add lots of spice to make it taste like anything.

I tossed in some diced carrots and frozen peas and this made a complete meal.  My kids loved it and my husband said it was definitely a keeper.  So easy to make too!

This recipe is so good and easy! You can add any vegetables you want to the rice- i used brocolli and bean sprouts- and you can adjust the soy sauce to your taste! My friend who is Asian, thought it was very authentic and very good!

Pretty good base recipe.  I 86'd the rice and replaced it with frozen peas.  Substituted coconut oil for the butter to make it dairy free.  Pretty tasty!

This was great. I did add more soy sauce than called for. 2 1/2 instead of 1 tbsp but just in general it is a really easy recipe, especially if you stick the rice in the rice cooker first and then just toss it into the skillet with the cooked chicken to mix all together.

Great Recipe. I only made two small changes. I added peas and used Bragg's Liquid Amino's (two tablespoons) instead of soy sauce. The end result had an authentic Chinese flavor and my husband loved it!

Too bland, and the large amount of rice was too much for me to "fry" in my skillet, so I ended up with chicken and steamed rice.

This was my first try at making chicken fried rice. It turned out decent, although it still tasted like it needed some seasoning that was not in the recipe.

I love this recipe, but I use a bit less rice and I cook my rice in beef or chicken broth. It really makes a difference in taste. I also add green peppers.

When I made this I already had chicken marinating in a ginger sauce so I left out the chicken but added water chestnuts. Recently we've had problems finding something our 18 month old daughter would eat and she ate two bowls of this. We will be making this again. Thank you for a good recipe that's easy and tastes delicious.

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!! I sauted the mushroom & onion in the same skillet with the chicken just before removing it from the pan & I did add some extra soy sauce. I will make this again & again, and might try it with shrimp.

I am newly married (and still learning how to cook).  My husband loves this recipe, and wants it at least one a week!  WONDERFUL.  It taste just like House of Japan's fried rice!  I used a little extra soy sauce, and no mushrooms!

My family loved this recipe.  I did leave out the chicken, but that did not hurt the dish.  I also had to add much more soy sauce(2 Tablespoons)to even get flavor, but once I did it tasted like we got it at a restaurant.

Excellent!  I've made fried rice before, but never had the family chow it down like with this recipe.  We used leftover ham instead of the chicken and added finely chopped carrots to the veggies.  I'm looking forward to using the recipe with different meats/seafood and changing up the veggies for variety.  Thanks!

All of the concepts for this dish are great.  The dish turned out tasting great and my family loved it.  However I had to improvize when it came to browning the rice.  2 tbls. of butter just was not enough to fry the rice.

This was my first attempt at fried rice and it turn out quite good. My husband and I ate it all (well, mostly my  husband ate it all!!!). I used left over white Calrose rice (sticky rice), marinated the chicken in soy and ginger for 2 hours prior to cooking and did not add any salt at cooking time,  threw in some pea pods for an additional texture. Took a little longer to "fry" than recipe called for but worth the extra wait. I fried in up in a wok on the stove top with a little less than a tablespoon of peanut oil. Thanks for the recipe, April.

this was really tasty. cooked enough for myself for 1 dinner and 3 lunches at work. cooked the chicken in satay sauce first, forgot to buy green onions but added normal and it was fine. basically I cooked the basic of what I had read and threw in whatever veges were left over in the fridge. A really nice, quick meal that will last me 4 days.

This was a very good recipe.  I have made a different recipe for fried rice but we did not like it.  But this one I will make again.  I did add more soy sauce and pea pods and bean sprouts.  I was not able to get the rice to fry though.  But I will make this again.  VERY GOOD

This was a good recipe. I'd do it again with a few alterations. I used peas and omitted the mushrooms and green onions and opted for white onion instead. I also sauteed the rice in a little sesame oil, and would probably use some more seasonings just to kick it up.

Grilled the chicken, cubed. 
I used 3 cups cooked rice instead.
Sauté garlic and onion then rice.
Used red pepper flakes, ginger in addition to seasoning.
This has a lot of possibilities!

I cut the recipe in half and made a few changes based on what I had and what I like. I used some leftover Key West Chicken from last night and cut it into tiny little pieces. (It's actually better in this recipe than it was last night.) I set it aside. I browned the rice in the butter and very little sesame oil.  Then I added some red pepper, about 4 green onions, and the chicken and stir-fried a few minutes before adding 2 beaten eggs atop the whole thing. I stirred until the eggs were done and added just a very little lite soy sauce. I finished by adding some canned LeSueur green peas. This is my first time making something like this and I love it!

Easy and good. But a little bland. Make it your own, by inserting extra veggies. I choose thawed peas and finely chopped red pepper.  I would suggest adding a 3rd egg based on the volume of rice. I also added more soya sauce, but that may be just my taste.

It was so good and just what I was craving.

A basic fried rice recipe that allows for substitutions. I used broccoli and bean sprouts instead of peas for the veggies. I would recommend this as a quick week night meal.

I too had to put my own spin on this since I rarely follow an exact recipe.  I did cook my rice the day before like others.  I also put about 1/4 cup of frozen mixed vegetables and chopped bell pepper in skillet as the chicken was finishing cooking. We also like more soy sauce.  Like someone else said there is not really a wrong way to cook this.  I had planned to post a picture but my kids had it eat up before I could get one!

I tried this recipe last night.  It's a good basic recipe.  It was very tasty and not too hard to prepare.  Put in as much of the other ingredients with your rice as you like.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone who likes fried rice recipes.  Too make it even easier, I had frozen some pre-cooked chicken breasts.  It eliminated most of step two.  I just cooked them in butter enough to warm them up.

Both yummy and "kinda" bland. Maybe I did not follow instructions very well. My chicken was starting to boil and did not get brown. I managed to take out the liquid and use it later with the soy sauce. Smelled awesome and kid friendly. My older ones can add pepper sauce and more soy sauce to their own serving. Very helpful reviews!

Delicious and everyone raved about it.  I added celery, used Bragg's in place of soy sauce, added a big spoonful of minced garlic, and sprinkled it with Ginger.  Didn't measure any of it...just added to taste.    Overall, this is a great "base" recipe...my favorite kind.

Not bad. Not at all like chinese restaurant fried rice, but not bad for "homemade" chinese.  Healthier that the real stuff since it doesn't have the MSG and oil.

I had some leftover jasmine rice, cooled, so I diced up some chicken breast, seasoned it with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and black pepper, then tossed it in flour and sauteed it in sesame oil. When it was almost done, I put the rice in the skillet with the chicken and sesame oil, threw in a few splashes of low-sodium soy sauce, and fried it up. When it was done, I stirred in a sprinkling of garlic salt. I didn't have any vegetables on hand and I HATE eggs, but next time I think I'll throw in some baby corn and water chestnuts (not a fan of vegetables, as much as I'd like to be). I'd already eaten dinner - hence the leftover rice - so I packed it for lunch today and it reheated great! Good ideas and a good base recipe!

Really good!  I added shredded carrots in lieu of the mushrooms and more soy sauce.  My ULTRA picky 4 yr old ate 2 servings!  Next time I'll add more veggies, maybe zucchini??  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a good, basic chicken fried rice. Very comforting. The eggs really help to hold everything together. Next time I might add bean sprouts or water chestnuts for a little crunch.

This was super easy and very good. This along with the Sesame Beef recipe made a perfect dinner. Thanks for the recipe.

It needs more flavor! We added double the amount of soy sauce, a tbsp of teriakyi, a couple tbsp of orange sauce, grated ginger, ground mustard and five spice. Oh, and reduced the rice by 1/2 cup and it was still WAY too much. I'd reduce it down again. We also added some garlic and milk to the scrambled eggs, and added some baby corn, some sugar snap peas and green onion. 

Overall, not too bad but not my favorite mix.

I don't usually comment if I don't like a recipe, but this was awful!  No flavor, gummy texture.  I had to throw it out and heat up a frozen pizza for dinner.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.

This was very bland. We had one helping and the rest went into the food processor to be made into baby food. My 10 month old ate it. Would not make again, unfortunately.

It didn't have that much flavor to it, somethng was missing. Thought I made it better by using the spices in the envelope sold at the groceries. Think I'll stick to that. Thanks though,

This was an overall good recipe though I found it a bit bland.  I omitted the chicken as I was using it as a side dish instead of a main course...maybe that's why?  Good overall.

This was a tasty meal.  I made the rice early in the afternoon and let it cool in the frig.  I used Teriyaki Marinade & Sauce on the rice while I was frying it in a little butter. I also used more rice and 3 eggs and it turned out great.  My kids loved it! Thanks April!

Definitely needed additional soy sauce, but once extra soy was added, everyone enjoyed it.

This was a great starter recipe!  I added sauted zucchini, onion, and frozen peas, and a little cayenne pepper for just a little slow heat.  I tried sushi for the first time about a week ago so I used calrose rice.  Next time I think I'll use brown though.
