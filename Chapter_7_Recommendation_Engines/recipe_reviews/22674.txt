This fudge was the easiest ,most delicious fudge I ever made.The key to it being creamy is to make sure everything is at room temperature before starting.Add the confectionary sugar a little at a time and beat slowly until it is all incorporated. Then Kick it up a notch, and beat until smooth. I added a little orange food color.I wrapped the pan very tightly in plastic and foil, kept in refridgerator . Stayed as fresh as the day I made it.Everyone loved it. Definately satifies the sweet tooth.

An 8X8 pan is clearly too small for this recipe.Because it is too sweet, add 1 to 2 cups chopped nuts and spread in a jelly roll pan so pieces can be less dense. Then it's outstanding. I made it in a 9X13 pan with nuts but larger pan is best. This review is courtesy of my writers group.

I am giving this recipe 5 stars because it is absolutely delicious! I did tweak the recipe just a little as others suggested by adding orange coloring and macadamia nuts. I also made sure that all ingredients were at room temp. I also did use a 9x13 inch pan rather than an 8x8 because this recipe does make a lot of fudge.  An 8x8 would be way too small. This recipe was easy and turned out delicious. I am keeping this for future use definitely!!

Quick yes! Easy...well a bit hard to just stir. I used my mixer. I wanted the orange color, so I used orange food color, and now it's alot like the orangesickles we used to have as ice cream.
Flavor is very good. 
mine came out grainy, yet creamy...(hard to explain texture)due to the fact that the cream cheese did not say "warm to room temperature" and I think that would have made it very good and creamy. Cold it cooled the chocolate making it a grainy chocolate texture.I will try this again.

This is really easy and very, very good. I warmed the ingredients to room temperature; and used a hand mixer to mix everything well. I also added a few drops of orange food coloring and a cup of chopped macadamia nuts. Definitely a keeper recipe; I'm sure I will make it again.

My fudge did not turn out grainy at all!  I used cold cream cheese it still turned out wonderful!  I also added chopped macadamia nuts which made it super yummy.  And yes, you need a bigger pan.

For anyone who claims this is too sweet...it's fudge.  Hello...fudge.

This recipe was great and easy.I didn't have enough flavoring so I added Grand Marnier and orange peel. It still didn't have enough orange flavor for me but it was still great. My niece's and nephews loved it. I will make sure I have plenty of orange extract the NEXT time I make this. I reccommend to use a 9x13 pan too. This makes a lot of fudge.

Delicious. Very smooth and creamy. I halved the recipe - except for the orange extract, I still used a full tablespoon - and it still fit into a 8x8 pan. I used white almond bark. Would recommend some food coloring. The fudge turns out white.

Sickly sweet. 

Grainy texture.

I would cut down on the sugar -

I will not make this again. It is like eating a handful of hard frosting.

I halved this recipe and still made a 9X9 pan that wasn't skimpy.  Changes I made: before adding orange flavoring (which I used the whole ammount - 1TBS), I scooped out about a 1/3 to 1/4 of the mixture into a bowl and set it aside.  Added the orange flavoring and couple drops of food coloring - enough to make it a pale orange.  Put the "orange mixture" into the bottom of the foil lined 9X9 pan and smoothed out. (Tapping the pan on the table or floor.) Once smoothed, I added the remaining mixture (white) in nine spoonfuls and marbled the top.  It not only turned out BEAUTIFUL, and aslo YUMMY!  Thanks for this recipe!!

I was actually very disappointed with this fudge.  It turned out grainy...that would have been tolerated if I had liked the taste.  It was too "orangey" to taste like those ice creams and that was why I made it.  I probably won't try this again

very easy. Everyone loved it. I used orange chocolate disks and added the orange flavoring to it. spread it in the pan then used white chocolate and added vanilla flavoring and spread that on top. Awesome and looked great. You can also use almond flavoring with white chocolate and then just use milk chocolate and layer them for a chocolate/almond flavor. Definately can mix it up and make different flavors. Chocolate/strawberry, Chocolate/rasberry, plain chocolate or add walnuts.

This was so popular with my family and friends this Christmas that it took top billing over the p-nut butter fudge that is always requested.

this will be my 3rd year making this for the holidays. i have no clue why it would turn out grainy unless you are not using powdered sugar. i make it in a larger pan and cut it in small squares. a little goes a long way.

First, I need to point out that I didn't make this recipe just like it is given here, basically due to the high price of white chocolate.  Instead, I basically halved the recipe by using one 12oz bag of white chocolate chips, one package of cream cheese, and about 2.5 cups of sugar.

All in all it turned out tasty.  However, I would not call this fudge.  The texture is more like a combination of cheesecake and fudge.  This is no doubt due to the cream cheese that is in it.  I eat it with a spoon.

Overall a good recipe, but I'm going to try some other orange fudge recipes as well to see if anything is more fudge like in texture.

I made this exact recipe with cherry extract instead. I have done this twice, and also tried it with pecans and almonds. Both worked out well.
Tomorrow, I plan on shopping again to tweak this recipe a bit. I'm going to try milk chocolate, and vanilla extract

I used a mixture of vanilla and white chocolate instead of all white, so it wouldn't be as sweet. I didn't need all of the powdered sugar, I noticed that it was the consistancy I wanted and I would say I had about a cup or so of leftover sugar in the bowl left. It's wonderful.

This was quick and easy to make. It was super delicious and rich like real fudge should be. Unlike some, mine didn't turn out grainy because I properly melted the chocolate (if you try to do the chocolate too quickly, it will end up grainy, so it's best to melt it slowly so it stays creamy). Next time I'll add some food coloring to give it that orange swirl look. It's definitely one for the recipe book! The 8x8 pan was the perfect size and the fudge didn't come out hard at all (again, probably due to melting the chocolate properly). The next day, it's still semi-soft, as fudge should be.

the cream cheese makes this a bit too creamy for me, like a sloppy fudge but tastes delicious.  I dont know if its because i use fat free cream cheese or what but thats just me.  If thats the reason then theres nothing wrong with this recipe!! lol

Pretty good.  Nice for something different on a tray of goodies. Next time, though, I'll ignore my kids & add nuts for a little more interest.

So I made this over the holidays for the first time this year. I was really excited for the outcome, but it wasn't as flavorable as I'd hoped. I don't think I'd make it again..unless uunder special request. I would add more flovoring and would have to work on its stability- it never fully set.

Where do I start? So, warm melted white chocolate met cool-yet-close-to-room-temperature cream cheese and instantly hardened. Added confectioner's sugar, and tried my best to mix by hand as I don't have a mixer. It was like stirring mashed potatoes made out of wet concrete. Seriously, I injured myself stirring this stuff. Thank goodness I only made half the amount as what I made more than filled the 8x8 pan. The recipe said easy, which is what I was looking for since I'm a beginning fudge maker. I was really, really disappointed. This was for my boyfriend as a special Christmas treat, but he and I both thought it was disgustingly sugary sweet and the creamy/grainy texture was so awful that we threw it out. I'm giving it 1 star because I can't give it negative five stars.

an 8 by 8 pan is a little too small. My first batch didn't really have an orange flavor, so I added 2 tablespoons of orange rind. I also used food coloring to give it an orange color

yummy and easy!  I also added tiny bit of orange rind and as others have said, make sure that cream cheese is at room temperature.

I modified this recipe to make something I couldn't find a recipe for! A while back, my daughter and I stopped at a local farmstand that sold fudge. There was a delicious looking pastel layered fudge called "rainbow sherbet" that we tried, but instead of the yummy fruity-ness we expected, it was flavored with mint. We were disappointed, but I was sure I could find a fruity version somewhere on-line, but found nothing! This recipe was close to what I was looking for, so I worked with it. I cut the powdered sugar to 4 cups, rather than 6 and divided the fudge into quarters. To one quarter, I added about 4 drops of red food coloring and about 2 tsp. raspberry extract, to another green coloring and a tablespoon of Real Lime juice, to the third, both yellow and red coloring and 2 tsp.orange extract, and to the last, yellow coloring and 2 tsp.lemon extract. Because I cut the sugar, the recipe did not fill a 9x13 pan, but would be more than what would fit in an 8x8, so maybe a 9x7 would be perfect.

I first discovered this kind of fudge at an Amish store.  My son loved it.  When we moved and wasn't around that store any longer I decided to look up the recipe and surprise him with his favorite fudge.  Awesome!

Easy and good.  The recipe does make a lot so it is better to use a 9 x 13 pan.

I added a lot more orange extract, since we like a stronger flavor, as well as orange color. For those who have it turn out grainy, I can think of two things. Make sure you do not over melt the white chocolate, or it will get hard when stirring, and grainy. And make sure you add the powdered sugar a little at a time. I add it in 1/2 cup increments, and beat in between each.  It does turn out very soft, but super delicious!

Very good! I used about 5 cups of confectioner sugar and it still turned out great! Almost like an orange creamsicle.

When I made this recipe, the fudge never fully set.  It was still tasty, even though we had to eat it with a spoon.

This was interesting. I put macademia nuts into it (though not enough). It's very sugary and fluffy. It tastes good, but next time I'd make less of it because it really makes a huge batch.
