I almost boiled the cauliflower  in some water beforehand because I honestly didn't expect it to get done enough in the  2-4 minutes in the fryer but I didn't and they came out great  as written. The cauliflower itself is a little bland on its own but excellent once dipped in the sauce. The sauce compliments the cauliflower perfectly and that is coming from someone that is  not a huge mayo fan. I did end up needing more flour to coat but other than that this was perfect as written.
