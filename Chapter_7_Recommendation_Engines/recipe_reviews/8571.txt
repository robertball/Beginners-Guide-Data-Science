I use this all the time and when I make it, I change the serving size to 30 and fill an old spice jar so I have it on hand instead of making it everytime (it wont go bad).  Not sure why the directions tell you to grill then put in the oven, save the time (and the cleaning of a pan) and keep it in the pan.  Take the chicken out of the fridge 20-30 min before cooking (this brings the chicken closer to room temp, chicken will cook faster).  Heat the pan on high for maybe 5 minutes (don't put anything in the pan until you are ready to use it).  I then use spray butter directly on the chicken (to avoid extra smoke) and put it in the pan spray side down.  Let it cook on medium high heat for 5-7 minutes (you will see the sides of the breast turn white).  Spray the uncooked side with spray butter and flip it over.  Cook another 5-7 minutes.  Take it out of the pan and let it sit for atleast 10 minutes.  in short... 3 tips for tender chicken, 1 - take out of the fridge for a few before you cook it.  2 - heat pan to help cook chicken faster, allowing it to sear and seal in juices.  3-  let chicken sit 10 minutes after it is out of the pan for the juices to flow throughout the chicken.  If you cut it too early only the first bite will be juicy the rest will be dry

I made this exactly as the recipes is written and my very picky husband LOVED the chicken from my first attempt.  He's asked me to make it every week for the past month.  While he loved it from the start, I thought the flavor was a bit off, I have since perfected it to our tastes:  I double all spices except halve the thyme.  I also put all the spices in a plastic baggy, cut the chicken into strips, and shake them in the bag, then follow the recipe as written.  I serve over pasta alfredo.

Not exactly my "type" of blackened chicken, though, most will probably find it delicious.  I used real onion (not powdered) and a bit of garlic as well.  Was good, but just not what I was looking for.  I prefer a spicier and crispier blackened chicken and this one was not spicy enough for my tastes and was a bit too moist (sheesh is that possible?).  If you like 'em hot and cripsy, seek a different recipe, if you like 'em moist with a mild tang, you'll like this.  :)

My husband's first word after eating this chicken was "yummy."  I followed the recipe to a T, except that I only allowed the oil to heat up for about 5-7 minutes.  It did create a lot of smoke, so turn on the fan ahead of time.  I also had to cook it in the oven for more than 5-10 minutes - it was probably closer to 20-25.  I don't know why people were saying that this chicken was bland - it was one of the most flavorful recipes I've tried in a long time.  I suspect that it's important to use a cast iron skillet, as it sears the spices into the skin of the chicken.  That might be the difference.  It was actually quite spicy, and I love and can tolerate quite a bit of spice.  I wouldn't change a thing, except that next time I might cook it in the cast iron skillet completely, as I wish it had a hard crust of the spices.

This chicken was the best.  My family loved it.  I cooked the chicken on the grill until done. (I didn't use the frying pan at all.)  I also made up a little extra spice mixture and sprinkled it over the hot coals while the chicken was cooking.  (Garlic added to the coals gives food a nice light smoked garlic flavor as well)

This is a good basic blackening rub, and putting the chicken in the oven kept it so moist and yummy. I've made it twice: 1st time I followed the ingredients exactly & my husband thought it was a little bland. 2nd time, I added 1/2 tsp. rubbed sage & 1/2 tsp garlic powder which definitely added some zip and more flavor. I also coated both sides the second time around. My husband and I dipped the chicken in Blue Cheese dressing which went great with the spices. This is now one of my husband's favorites!

This tastes good and is QUICK!  I tripled the amount of spice rub; put it on both sides of the chicken; pounded the chicken breasts so they wouldn't be so thick; and baked it for about 15 minutes which was just the right amount of time.  Thanks for sharing this one with us, Karena.

The people that reviewed this recipe and commented that it was a "fire hazzard" or the like, DID NOT READ THE DIRECTIONS!!!!!!!!!  You heat the pan for 15 minutes and OIL the chicken!!  It mentions nothing about adding oil to the pan!!!  This recipe tastes great and will not burn down your house!!

This recipe is fabulous.  My husband - who doesn't like blackened anything - loves it.  My suggesion would be to use Olive oil instead of vegetable oil and bake the chicken for 20 minutes instead of 5.  Other than that, this is the best blackened chicken I have ever had.

Great recipe.  I agree that it has to cook longer in the oven than 5-10 minutes.  I also rubbed the spices on both sides and not just one.  Great flavor!  We used Pam canola spray (liberal) in the pan to brown the chicken and didn't have any smoke (and only had to warm it for 6-8 minutes).  Also used chicken cutlets so they were a little thinner than regular chicken breasts.  We will definately make again.  Would be good with thick slice of melted cheese (sharpy cheddar) on top and served on a roll in the summer!

This is a very easy recipe that yields delicious results.  When I think blackened chicken, I think pan fried (not oven baked).  I used a cast iron skillet, let the pan heat up for about 10 minutes (the hotter you can get the pan the better the flavor).  I simply put the chicken in the pan (no butter & no oil, the chicken will stick in the pan at first, but if you just let it cook, it will completely release itself).  The chicken cooked about 7 minutes on each side but this will vary greatly on the thickness of your chicken.  I had beaten my chicken down to about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick.  Also be sure to pull your chicken out of the fridge and allow it to reach room temp before applying the rub.  With no oil and no butter to cook the chicken, this is a full flavored recipe that is incredibly healthy.

Truely a five star!!! And you don't have to use a cast iron skillet...let me tell you how. First I doubled the spices. Then, I had two huge skinless boneless chicken breasts from our local market so I sliced them in half and then cut them lengthwise so they wouldn't be so thick. I took a smaller casserole dish and drizzeled evoo on the bottom. I coated the chicken breasts on both sides w/the spices and placed them in the dish. I put diced onions on top, covered the dish and baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. Then I flipped them, drizzeled some more evoo on top, took the cover off and cooked for another 20 minutes, using a meat thermomitor to make sure they were done. Excellent!!! My husband hates chicken and hates even more breast meat, but he absolutly loved this! It had quite the kick and I searved w/rice and corn. Enjoy!!

Very good, light recipe.  We combined this with our Linguine with Walnut-Sage Pesto recipe and it turned out great.  We will definitely be making this recipe again.

Actually this is a great recipe. I owned a restaurant for many years and we did blackened chicken for many of them. the only difference is we heated the skillet over high heat with no oil. The high heat kept the chicken from sticking. But it must be very hot!!!

FIRE! My son (19) was heating the oil in a cast iron pan with a lid on it. When he took the lid off, the oil flashed! He popped the lid back on right away, which stopped the fire, but that quickly it had melted the hood on the stove. We went out for burgers that night, aired out the house, and just baked the chicken the next day. Be careful, this recipe can be dangerous!

Delicious!  After seeing the reviews about the cooking time, I happened upon a chicken recipe that used the same process (cook in the pan and transfer into the oven).  I used the cooking times from that recipe (cook in the pan turning once for about 3 minutes or until golden brown and then transfer to a 350 degree oven for 12 minutes.)  I also pounded out the breasts to make them an even thickness.  It turned out great!

This was so delicious!  It has a lot of zip to it.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and pan fried it over medium-high heat for about 6 minutes on both sides and let it rest for 10 minutes afterward.  I never put it in the oven at all. It was moist and yummy!  I will definitely make this again.

Great high protein, low carb main dish. I pounded my chicken breasts just enough so they would cook at the same rate. Seared on each side for one minute and then put in oven for 15 min. at 350. They were great, but I might take them out after 12 min. next time. Important!!! Let your chicken rest at least 10 minutes before cutting into them. Keeps them juicy!

This was yummy. I had four thin breast cutlets, so I quadrupled the yield because the original yield did not look like enough. I will definitely make up a big batch and store it in a recycled shaker so that it's that much easier to make in the future. I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I used a nonstick saute pan sprayed with Pam. I served it with the Alfredo Blue recipe from this site.

I made this once and my boyfriend now requests it all the time! I follow the recipe exactly and it's perfect and surprisingly moist. In the summer I thinly slice each chicken breast over a salad with lettuce, corn, sliced dates, crumbled feta, cubed red pepper and a citrus vinegarette. In the winter I serve it with potato wedges, veggies and sour cream.   I also recommend making a big batch of the seasoning mix and storing it in an air-tight jar. I also use it for fajitas, cajun rub for pork tenderloin and cajun spiced steak.

This was pretty good. I had two very small chicken breasts to coat and I thought this recipe would make enough to coat them... but it didn't. It tasted great, I just wished I would have made more!

Absolutely delicious. Two important notes: (1) 5 minutes in the oven wasn't anywhere near enough. It took ~15 minutes at 350 to get the chicken to 165. (2) I swear, the smoke from the searing of the spices nearly killed us. Make sure you have PLENTY of ventilation.

Really easy and delicious if you like spicy.  Yes we love spicy, even my 10 yr old son. I had leftover Emeril Essence, instead of adding the white pepper and cumin to the Essence, I sprinkled both directly on the chicken then sprinkled on the Essence. We served this atop salad greens for make your own sale night. After one round of salad, my son just ate the chicken. Yummy! I too blackened it completely in the cast iron skillet, be sure to open the windows, turn on the vent hood.  Turned out perfectly. We will definitely have  this again.

I didn't measure, I eyeballed the ingredients. I didn't have paprika or cayenne pepper, so I omitted the thyme and added Emeril's Essence which has paprika and thyme in it, and also used chipotle pepper. It was still really good!

Very tasty and very juicy.  I don't own a cast iron skillet, so I used my Le Creuset skillet to brown and then transferred to the baking sheet for the oven.  The level of spiciness always is a matter of taste, but next time, I'll cut back to 1/8 tsp of the cayenne.  Nice chicken entree, really easy and quick to get on the table.

Fantastic recipe ... very easy to prepare. I used frozen chicken breasts and they turned out very juicy. A cast iron skillet is not necessary. A good, heavy teflon pan works as well. I think this recipe could use about 1/2 of the cumin called for.

Made pretty much as written, altered the spices a little bit based on what I had on hand and the fact that I had brined the breasts for a few hours (so I omitted the salt).  

I put the iron skillet on a propane burner on my patio because my apartment has a very sensitive central fire alarm and the FD has already been here three times for other dishes I have tried that produced a lot of smoke in the normal course of cooking.

It took about 15 min. in the oven to finish.  I pulled them out when the internal temp was 160 and they rested and coasted to a little above 165.  (I am very wary of over cooking chicken.)

The seasonings were very nice and the chicken was moist and tender.  I will definitely make again.

Doubled the recipe for our family of 4, and it was great. I put out some cold mild salsa, everyone topped their chicken breast with it, and it was a nice contrast. I also made Honey Roasted Red Potatoes as the side. As others have pointed out, the oven time here must be a typo error. I baked the chicken at 375° for 20-25 min.

This has become my family's favorite chicken recipe. And it's so easy and fast. I took the idea from another reviewer and made my serving size to 30 and put it in a shaker. We use the mix on all kinds of foods, including salmon. It is extra yummy on Salmon!

This recipe is a fire hazard!!  Unless you're cooking outdoors, don't follow these directions.  I smoked up my whole house making this.  :-P  If I hadn't heated the oil for as long as it said it might have turned out okay.

This was great, and a hit with family! I cooked the chicken for about 10 to 15 min longer in the oven.  I also added a creamy alfrado sauce to it, then served it on a bed of pasta.  Very easy to make. It had alot of flavor, for me it could have been alittle hotter.

2 25 14 http://allrecipes.com/recipe/8571/blackened-chicken/ ... This is a good spice combination.  I always reduce thyme because I'm like that.  :/  :?  :D  Other than that, no changes to the spices.  (I halved the thyme.)  My four stars is for the spices.  I combined this with famous butter chicken, which basically is buttery cracker crumbs baked on chicken.  I added the spices, tripled since I had six pieces of chicken, to 1 1/2c cracker & plain bread crumbs (ran out of crackers).  'Got an "I liked that chicken' from 14 yr old female.  Huh!  :D  This was good, but mildly spiced due to the crumbs (duh); but is probably pretty hot as is.  I'll make some "straight" next time.  :)  Two days later :D : This is enough seasoning for one whole chicken: 4t paprika, 2t cayenne & cumin, 1t salt, thyme, onion powder, white pepper.  Mmmm!  I put 1t inside & am thinking reserving 1/2 - 1t for the drippings gravy since the flavor doesn't absorb too well on the meat if using skin-on. 8 5 16 'Finally made "straight" & I'm blaming the chicken.  Huh?!  Well, the seasoning is good; but as the chicken cooked it diluted the flavor.  It was the waytoomuchbrothadded type.  Soooo, I sprinkled on more when it was done & it did the trick.  'Served over linguini with alfredo sauce.

This was okay. Too paprika-y for me. It was edible and my husband liked it but I won't make it again. Somehow even with all the seasonings it was sort of bland.

I used this recipe as a guideline on how to blacken chicken as I was looking for a way to use some Penzey's Cajun Seasoning.  I oiled the chicken breasts with cooking oil, sprinkled on the cajun season and and rubbed it in. I then seared the breasts for about a minute on each side and placed in a parchment lined pan in the oven at the recommended 350 degrees. I'm not sure how thin Karena's chicken breasts were but it took 25 minutes for my chicken to bake as opposed to the recommended 5 minutes.  The chicken was moist, tender and delicious. I served it with brown rice and glazed carrots.

This was really good...even my 15 month old ate some of it. I cut my chicken into thin strips and skipped the baking part.  Mine didn't need it.  I didn't use a cast-iron skillet.  Just a regular non-stick worked great!!  I made a mixture of mayo, horseradish, parmesan cheese, oregano, basil and black pepper to spread over tortillas.  I then placed the chicken on top and made wraps for dinner.  Thanks Karena

Large chicken breasts take 20-30 minutes to cook.  Very strange taste, not your typical blackened flavor.

To only cook this sizable chicken breast 5 minutes in a stovetop pan and 5 minutes more in an oven at 350 degrees sounds to this cook as an order for food poisoning.  Enjoy.

We had this for dinner.  It's excellent.  The instructions are perfect.   I had to increase the oven time by about 4 minutes to account for the thickness of the chicken breast I used.  I mixed the spices but tweaked a bit using half of the cayenne and white pepper.  I would make this again.  Thanks Karena!

Honestly wasn't impressed. I doubled the amount of spices b/c we had 4 halves instead of 2. Followed everything else as written aside from the baking time, which was more like 15-20 minutes. Very juicy but tasted more like a taco seasoning. With that being said, I would use this as seasoning for chicken tacos, but not again for baked chicken.

LOVE IT!  I've used this recipe several times now and it never fails me.  I do double the cayenne and also add garlic powder.  Otherwise is seems a little bland to us but we like it hot and spicy.  I also don't cook the chicken in the skillet or oven.  I put it on the grill at medium temp and pull it at 148 degrees (internal meat temp) letting the meat rest for 10 minutes before cutting or serving.    It's also important to let the chicken come to room temp before you cook it.  About 30 minutes on the counter works for me.  It's perfection every single time.

I had to double the seasonings to have enough to cover the chicken.  I also used chicken thighs which are more moist but fatty, but that's up to your preference.  I'm not sure if my pieces were just too big but I needed about 20 minutes in the oven for the chicken to cook through.

This chicken was fantastic! It was definitely spicy. If you don't like heat you may want to tone down on some of the spices. I will be making this again and again.
Update 7/18/17 Made this for my SIL for a birthday dinner. She loved it. I serve it over Fettuccine Alfredo and it cuts the heat of it a little. Such a great easy recipe!

Excellent!!   I did triple the spices, added 1/2 tsp garlic salt and 1/2 tsp sage (x3). Tossed in ziploc to coat. I pan seared in olive oil and baked in the oven for 20 minutes. I added chicken broth to help retain the moisture. Next time I will serve over fettuccine alfredo.

Great recipe!!!!! Instead of rubbing seasoning on one side I mixed a little virgin olive oil into the mix and rub on both sides of the chicken and left in the fridge for a couple of hours. I also grilled instead of baked. It turned out wonderful and very flavorful.
Thanks! for a wonderful recipe.

Have an outdoor grill???  Yes, it does create a lot of smoke in the kitchen so I fired up my grill and placed my cast iron skillet on the grilling rack.  Cooks the same as on the stove but the smoke's outside.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was wonderful!! I agree with "JemJen24" who said this was a "moist" version of blackened chicken and it isn't very spicy (which can easily be modified with a little more spices) but the taste was FABULOUS! I scaled this to make 3 chicken breasts and my baking times were right on. After 10 min, they were done (but I kept it in the oven for a few more min until my noodles were done). If you have ever had "Blackened Chicken Alfredo" from TGI Fridays, this is a close version.  I made fettucine noodles and alfredo sauce (from this site). I then poured the sauce over the noodles and spinkled some minced green onions and diced pimentos and placed the chicken on top. Presentation was just as good as it tasted. Thanks you. Will make this again!

This was very tasty.  I did not heat my oil 15 minutes, and was missing a few of the ingredients, but I will definitely make this again

I like this a lot when I want some serious spice for dinner without a long wait to bake. I never bother with salt so I left that out. But this is an awesome recipe and goes well with spicy corn

I was skeptical about the amount of spice, but it was actually very good. The chicken was very juicy and had the right amount of kick.  Great with rice and corn.

Love this recipe!!! I follow the recipe exactly with the exception of putting the skillet straight in the oven instead of using a baking sheet. My super picky husband even loves it and that's saying something!

I love this recipe! My boyfriend made this for dinner recently and it was great! very flavorful! We love spice, so he did add more Cayenne pepper (Either 1-2 tsp total). He also added a little bit of brown sugar for a bit of sweetness (About 1 tbsp). We plan to make a large batch and use it over and over. I think it would work well on Salmon as well. Maybe pork? Great mix!

It took about 20min to cook the chicken  at 350 but the spices were a great mix! I doubled the spice mix for three chicken breasts and it still wasn't enough. Next time I will quadruple the measurements and add garlic salt as it was a bit bland for us. Still a good basic recipe.

This was so good! I was definitely not expecting it to be as flavorful as it was, and I was pleasantly surprised. Usually when chicken is simply baked with spices, the flavor remains on the outside of the chicken and the inside seems bland and dry. While this one still had the dryness to it (hence the lack of 5 stars), the spices on the outside more than made up for it. The only thing I changed was that I tripled the spice mixture. This one is definitely a part of the line up!! :-)

Made this last night for dinner.  Thought it was good.  I like really spicy food and thought this was a mild spicy flavor...not TOO hot.  Made according to directions except had to leave in oven for about 20 minutes, but I had 2 thick breasts of chicken.  It went over really well.  Next time I may follow another reviewer's advice and slice up breasts into strips because I really wanted the blackened flavor on every bite.

This is a great rub.  Would definitely make again.  As others have said, I had to cook the chicken in the oven at least 20 or 25 minutes before it was done.  Maybe because the breasts were so large. I was afraid to use my cast iron skillet on my flat top stove so I used a regular metal skillet and it worked fine.  I think this would be great on fish.

This was super yummy! I made this the other night for an impromptu dinner party. Everyone ate it up and requested seconds. I followed the recipe exactly except I coated both sides in the spice rub. It was flavorful and moist. My husband has requested that I make the spices in bulk. I had borrowed a cast iron skillet from my neighbor, but now hubby is on the way to the store to purchase one just for this recipe. =)

Everything about making my own blackening season was great! However, I was just making it for two and when I put 2 in the servings box, it still didnt seem to be enough for 2 chicken breasts. I threw my chicken in the seasoning rather than sprinkling the seasoning ontop.

Followed directions and exactly what I was looking for. Great spice, zesty but not HOT. Takes about 20 minutes in oven to cook breasts after seering as per directions. They were very moist.

Loved this recipe! Read some reviews and modified it a bit by adding twice the cayenne and adding garlic powder. Also added some cajun seasoning. Pan fried it then popped in the oven for 20 minutes and it came out moist and perfect.

Except that I used black pepper instead of white pepper, I followed the recipe exactly.  I wish I had remembered to take a picture of the finished product because it really looked good!  Unfortunately, I will never make this again.  It was just way too hot & spicy for our taste.  The chicken was tender though and I appreciate having tried a new technique for cooking chicken.  It's possible I will try this way of cooking the chicken with a focus on coating it with garlic, salt  & onion spices & see how that tastes.  My family said it was okay, but a little too hot.

Just made this tonight for the first time and thought it was very tasty!  I followed the recipe for the seasoning mix exactly and the flavor of these was honestly just like you get at restaurants.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of five is because, like most other reviewers, I needed to cook my chicken much longer than the stated 5 minutes to achieve a center that was no longer pink.  Other than that great recipe!  I will be making these agin.

I made this recipe basically as described, but after cooking in a cast iron skillet for about 1 minute per side, I put the entire skillet in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes.  Came out perfect.

I have cooked this chicken over and over because my husband now DEMANDS it!  He says that it's the best he's ever had, so KUDOS TO YOU (and me for attempting it) for putting a smile on my hubby's face!! The only thing I did differently was to mix all the spices together in a bowl, adding a dash of olive oil to the spice mixture to make a wet rub instead of a dry rub. It saves time by skipping the step where you coat the chicken with the oil its self.  Not to mention, a wet rub allows the spices to coat the meat more completely as well as efficiently. One thing I have found is that a regular  non stick skillet that is better quality & oven safe works just as good as the cast iron skillet the recipe calls for since I don't own one a this time. MOST EXCELLENT!!!!

Would have been five stars but it took a lot longer to cook than 5 minutes in the oven. Great though, I will make again. Served with a side of broccoli and roasted corn.

My husband LOVES this spice mixture.  He'll actually eat more chicken if I use it.  I did add just a pinch of ground ginger.

Very good... I doubled the spices and rubbed both sides of the chicken, and put on a cast iron grill pan, and it was ready in about 16 minutes.  I also didn't have white pepper and substituted black pepper instead, and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  I served with mashed potatoes and green beans, and it worked well together. Do take the advice of other reviewers and turn your overhead fan on/open windows if possible if you grill indoors, because this gets smoky.

This chicken is great. I use chicken tenders since they cook up quick and then serve them over Fettuccine Alfredo.

this chicken is good, but its not spicy enough to really qualify it as blackened, for what blackened means to me.  also, there is no need for as much oil as the recipe calls for, and no need to heat it for FIFTEEN minutes.  that is dangerous, and i put the chicken on after ten minutes.  i didnt realize how much smoke was filling my apartment, but the entire night after i kept coughing and couldnt take a deep breath.  this recipe should come with a WARNING:  have lots of ventilation and try not to breathe in all the smoke.  i REALLY didnt appreciate not having the warning.  the chicken is good, but it wasnt worth damaging my lungs for.

Very very good! We thought it was the perfect degree of spicy.  Even the kids loved it - I lightly seasoned theirs however.

Why all the fuss over this recipe?  I made it to a "T", which I almost never do with any recipe.  Wasn't hot enough to call "Cajun".  Wasn't flavorful at all.  Basically, a chicken died for no reason at all.

Awesome!!! Just like the the chicken in the famous restaurant's Blackened Chicken Salad, which they took off of the menu in my area. Now I make my own at home. Don't heat oil so long to avoid smoke. Definately pound chicken flat, then coat for more flavor & cooking ease! Thanks for this Easy & Tasty Recipe!

The flavor of this chicken is just awesome!  After cooking the breasts, I sliced them and wrapped them in tortillas with sauteed onions, peppers, salsa and a dollop of sour cream.  Delicious!  I'm certain they'd be fabulous served intact as a main course too.  That's how I'll try them next time.

I made this the other night for dinner.  Made a few changes. 1. I beat the chicken breasts & put seasoning on both sides. Let it sit in the frig for an hour.  2. I used my outdoor burner to heat a cast iron skillet for 5 mins. Then added Peanut Oil, which has a higher flash point.  Cooked the chicken for about a minute on each side.  Covered the pan with a lid & brought it, carefully, inside & put it in the oven.  3. Baked in the oven for 10 mins, but should have only cooked it for 5.  It was a little overdone after 10 mins.  This really cut down on the smoke inside the house.  My husband & I both thought it could have used a little more spice so next time I will experiment.  Overall it was very good & easy to fix.  I will make it again.

We really liked this recipe.  I cut up four boneless chicken breasts into strips.  You will need to double the amount of spices if you cook four chicken breasts.  With the chicken in smaller pieces, the cooking time was right on.  Serve over cooked fettucine noodles with the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce from this site.  And I let the oil heat up for only three minutes.  Worked like a charm.  I highly recommend.

I thought this was good, and something I will  do again. I think I need to work on tweaking the spices so that it suits our tastes. Still, I  am definately going to add it to our recipe box.

Wow! This was an excellent chicken dish.  We eat a lot of chicken and this is a wonderful, new dish to add to the collection.  Unfortunatly, I had not cayenne pepper, but the chicken was great.  Also, it is just 2 of us and we usually just eat the boneless, skinless chicken tenders.  If you do use the chicken tenders, I didn't need to put the chicken in the oven.  I cooked it on the stovetop and it was juicy and wonderful.  I also put the rub on both sides of the chicken to make it more flavorful.  Wonderful

First time trying! I had a craving for this and found this recipe. I didn't have any thyme so I substituted it with oregano. I would recommend that you triple this recipe. It is barely enough to cover both sides of 2 breasts. I took a comment below and melted butter and buttered it onto a breast with a basting brush. Then covered one side of the breast and cooked for 3 minutes each side or a bit longer depending on size of the breast. I then baked it at 350 for 25 minutes. It was wonderful! My picky kids even liked it and hubby asked for more. Will definitely make this again!

I love this.  Since cast iron is the perfect stove top to oven cooking piece, I didn't transfer to a baking sheet to finish, just leave it in the skillet and place in the oven, one less pan to clean!  Thanks for sharing the recipe, it's awesome!

I didn't have dried thyme and onion powder but it still came out delicious. I mixed the spices with olive oil then rubbed it on the chicken. Instead of browning it on stovetop, it went straight to the oven for 15 mins. I cut the fillets in half prior to seasoning. I ate it with a baked potato and some chipotle salad dressing. Great lunch!

Perfect! (I just found it is needed just to sprinkle the spice on meat, not to drop the meat on a plate with spice, because it is simply way too much.)

I liked it, but not so much the cumin.  I tripled the rub, but left the cumin at original amount as cumin does like to take over - otherwise followed recipe/instructions (though cooktime was 17 min in oven, not 5).  I liked the oiling of the chicken vs the pan and the chicken had good flavor with a bit of a bite, but even with less cumin overall - it still took over.  Will do again, but use the more traditional oregano, and add powdered garlic equal to the powdered onion in future batches.  Gave 4 instead of 5 as cumin isn't 'traditional blackened' and for me, completely took it over.

I followed this recipe for half of my first batch.  I felt it needed additional flavor  so for second batch I added some adobe season salt (red top) and a little more cayenne pepper. Also i did not put it in the oven. I instead cooked it 2 min on each side. made it perfect and a lot more juicy. I Also I didn't have a skillet so used my baking pan (the silver kind that always browns over time) used this as a skillet on the stove top and was able to still blacken the chicken perfectly.

I was very disappointed, but I should''ve known better; there was no smell to the seasoning.. There was alot of coughing from the pepper when searing the chicken. Although the chicken looked  pretty,  it was totally bland.  I even added some garlic powder and a little more salt (seasoned). It wasn't even spicy.  One person drowned it in hot sauce. Another used bar-b-Que  sauce. Really disappointed .

Just OK. Could have used double the amount of spice this recipe created for two med/lg breasts. I really liked the Blackened Salmon spice recipe and would use that instead (even on chicken) next time.

This is so good.  I double the ingredients though, makes it blacker & much spicier.  If you do this indoors on a iron skillet, your kitchen will be smokey!!!

Enjoyed the spices,but it needed a little more salt.I grilled the chicken and then left on a plate covered with aluminum foil to rest. The kids enjoyed it served with a side of ranch to dip their chicken.

Very good, although I feel like this didn't make enough spice for 2 servings. Served this over Jalepeno rosemary alfredo from this site, which paired very well together. Thanks for the recipe.

LOVE THIS seasoning! Only made a few changes; I did almost everyting X4. I subtracted the cayenne by 1/4 tsp. Also, I didnt have onion powder, only onion salt, so I used less salt and added 1/8 x 3 of onion salt. Let me tell you how good this is on shrimp and fish!!!! Holy cow me and my son could eat this every day of the week. The shrimp is amazing cold, the next day too. Cant get enough of this....thank you for sharing.:)

Just a side note; I lightly coat the shrimp and fish in cocnut oil, put just a touch in a frying pan too, to blacken. Coconut oil is SO good for you! Much better choice than anything else...

I like this and it was easy to make. I did bake it for 15 minutes instead of 5. I found it a little more spicy than I like, but it was good and simple.

Great flavor!  Quick, easy and fast.  Love it!  To save time, we cooked it completely on the grill and it turned out great.  I served it with lemon juice and that complemented the spicy flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious, what a change from dull baked chicken. I only made a few minor changes, I doubled the amount of spice mix which barely coated two large breasts, I used olive oil to coat the chicken instead of a spray and I put it in the oven still in my iron skillet which gave it a crisp spice crust and kept it very moist. This one will be a new regular for my family!

This was the juiciest chicken I have ever made, but I wasn't a huge fan of the spice combo.  I think next time I'll adjust more to my tastes (for example, I don't like thyme).

Just made this with 2 huge chicken breasts and it was excellent.  Cut the chicken into about 8 pieces since they were so huge and doubled the spice mix.  I did not have onion powder so I substituted about 1/4 tsp of seasoned salt for the salt and onion powder.  All other seasonings were used as indicated.  I also just did on the stove in the pan--did not use the oven.  Sprinkled some EVOO in the pan and then sprayed with butter spray during cooking---removed the pan from the heat to spray!!! Hubby loved this.  nice and spicy cut up on a green salad.  will also use for sandwiches and chix salad.  Really nice flavor!!!

Very good blend of spices for blackened chicken. I double or triple the spices for smaller pieces of chicken, and then no baking time is needed.

Awesome flavor and very tender. Served on a green salad for a group of girlfriends. One friend has celiac disease, and this chicken pleased everyone (hardcore foodies included).

Lots of Kick here. I doubled the amount of spices and used chicken tenderloins and completed the cooking right in the pan. The Mash potatoes is a must have complement to the chicken. The creamy texture of the potatoes makes the dish just wonderful. Thank You for Sharing

I'm confused.... five minutes to bake? No Way!  MUCH MUCH longer.  I followed this recipe to a T, flavors are great but I had to bake it for a good 20 - 25 minutes to cook the inside.

I didn't have measuring spoons so I eyeballed the ingredients. This was my first dish I made for my husband and I'm a vegetarian. He loved it! Next time I'll get the spoons to ensure all the flavors are there. Serve it with penne arrabiatta (trader joes) and a garden salad. Pomegranate lime juice to drink. I used veggie meat for me, spiced it up with the Cajun rub.

3.5 stars.  Nice little kick to it.  Good rub.  Like marinating better as I feel like it helps keep chicken moist, but this totally works when you need chicken quick and didn't plan to marinate.

I made for my family and very picky boyfriend and they all loved it! I doubled on most spices like others suggested, except thyme. Pounded chicken to get a more even cook. And seasoned it inside a back with about 1/4 of olive oil and spices. Seared for about two minutes each side and actually baked it for about 9 minutes( don't know if electric stove makes a difference). It was great great great and will try a little more pepper next time :). Oh and served over Alfredo pasta!

Very good and fast.  Next time I will pound my chicken out so it is the same thickeness throughout.  The middle part was not fully cooked -my fault!

This was very good.  The seasonings were just right and I think using the cast iron skillet made these very tasty.  After cooking and removing the chicken from the pan, I added mashed potatoes to the pan and they picked up some of the seasoning and were a very good addition to the meal.

Good Recipe!  I did use black pepper, because I don't like white, and I didn't have onion powder.  Also next time I'll replace the thyme with oregano because I don't like thyme.

Very good. Followed recipe as stated except added garlic powder and needed more than 5 minutes for baking. It was very spicy, but I liked that.  I was very surprised at the flavor, really close to what I have had in restaurants. Served with a cool leafy salad and macaroni salad.   As others have stated, it differs from some blackened chicken I've had in that it's not very crisp but instead very moist. That isn't a bad thing at all, but I will have to play around with the recipe until I perfect it for my taste. Will definitely make again.

This was so good!  I made it with "To Die For Fettuccine", from this site, to create Blackened Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo.  Everyone in the family loved it.  I cooked the chicken as directed, and then sliced it into bite size pieces and tossed it into the fettuccine.  I will be making this again soon!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was ok, too spicy for me.  I am giving it the benefit of the doubt though, since I pounded the chicken thin and then put the spices on and that was probably what did it!  So be sure to keep the chicken breasts normal thickness instead of pounding them out, because then there's way too much spice!

I thought this was very yummy!!  I didn't have onion powder, so used 1/4 tsp minced onion flakes instead and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  I also increased the salt & ground white pepper to 1/4 tsp each.  Pounded the chicken breasts flat for even cooking & less cooking time.  Heated the skillet w/ 1 tsp shortening in the oven while it preheated to 400.  Took it out to the stovetop set on med-high to sear the breasts.  After searing each side for 1 minute, I just threw the whole skillet into the oven to bake - one less pan to cleanup!  Kept the oven at 400 and it worked out great!  Chicken came out with a perfect, crispy, dark crust.  I love blackened chicken and this is a very tasty recipe!

This is excellent. I added 1/2 tsp. dried onion flakes and 1/4 tsp. garlic pwd to the seasonings. I don't know why you need to transfer this to the oven, I wouldn't even consider it. I let oil heat up in my cast iron skillet while I rubbed the seasoning mix into the chicken breasts. I cooked them about 7 minutes each side. After letting them rest a few minutes, I sliced them and added them to a nice caesar salad. Delicious and enjoyed by all. They were very flavorful but not too spicy and they had a very nice crust on them. I will definitely make these again.

Good recipe but a little too hot for me. Next time I will use less cayenne pepper. I also didn't have any thyme but it still tasted good.

I've never had blackened chicken before so I'm not sure how this measures up to "traditional" examples but I liked this recipe. As written its not very spicy so a variety of pallets can handle it, at the same time the ingredients are easy to alter to any taste. For example, I made 2 pieces of chicken one for myself and one for my husband. My husband's piece got the original spice mix, mine got a little extra cayenne added. Supper easy and we both got flavor and heat level we enjoy. Thanks :)

It was not quite spicy enough for me, nor seared, but a great recipe to start with!  It tasted great!  I used goat cheese on the side to add a different type of flavor.

This was pretty darn good.  I doubled most of the spices, except for Cumin because it has such a strong flavor already.  I also added 1/4 t of garlic powder.  I used olive oil to coat the chicken then rubbed with spice mixture and cooked in heated pan sprayed with butter cooking spray.  I just browned the chicken then placed in oven for 20 minutes.  I let it rest for 10 minutes then served it with pasta and green beans.  Delish!

I love blackened chicken and this was my first attempt. So easy and so good! The only thing I did different was I added extra cayenne pepper and also 1/4 tsp of garlic. I used my cheap cookware and not a cast iron skillet and it turned out fine. Chicken was very moist and tender and I served it over salad. My husband loved it! I will not be spending $ at restaurants anymore for blackened chicken.

This chicken dish was very yummy!  I added some garlic powder and cajun seasoning as well.  I seared my chicken for about 2 minutes per side then put the chicken in the oven for about 30 minutes. (I took the chicken out of the oven after 10 minutes, but it was not  done)  The chicken was SO juicy and well seasoned.  I served this with some cream cheese ranch potatoes (from this site). We will be having this again really soon!

Made a tasty somewhat crispy chicken. Had a good flavor but not spicy at ALL. Wouldn't suggest heating oil for 15 min. and please open your windows and doors when you make this! My smoke detector went off! Made this and put it on a salad. Was tasty but not spicy like I had hoped.

This was exceptional.  I put the spice rub on both sides, used butter spray and cooked on the George Foreman for 3-4 min each side, then baked in the oven for about 5-6 min. They were a tad bit on the spicy side (keep your drink close at hand), but I like it that way. I served this with Cajun Pasta Fresca (also on this site), and it was restaurant quality. This recipe is definitely going in the regular rotation at our house!

I used thighs & legs to be economical, oregano for thyme and added garlic powder too. I got a good result without the cast iron skillet (I SO need to invest in one!), browned pieces well on each side in the oil and then baked in oven for 20 minutes to finish. Bone in pieces will take a bit longer than the BLSL chicken breasts featured in the original recipe.

Didn't like this at all, couldn't put my finger on it but it just blend very well.  Try the blackened chicken recipe under "blackened chicken pizza", it is much better.

This turned out very good.  I cut the chicken breasts into strips and then tossed the strips with the spice mixture.  Also for more heat...I added chili powder to taste.  I cooked them all on top of the stove and skipped the oven step.  When all were cooked, I tossed them into a caesar salad.  HMMMM!!  A definite keeper!!!

I made this for dinner tonight and it came out great. I also seasoned both sides of the chicken after reading the reviews. I did not heat my oil for the full 15 minutes, more like 7 to 8 as my iron skillet is large and my stove eye is very hot on high and the oil started to smoke quite a bit. I transferred the chicken (still in the iron skillet) to the second to top rack of my oven at 450 degrees as I had some potatoes cooking at the same time. The chicken was in the oven for almost 20 minutes and came out very moist and delicious. Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe and have been making it for years.  I double the amount of spices and coat both sides.  I then just fry it in the pan - I don't put it in the oven.  It is great over ceasar salads and alfedo sauce.

We loved it. Chicken was still tender and the combination of spices made the chicken taste more interesting. We had some pasta, salad, and sun-dried tomato pesto potato skins on the side. UPDATE: Just made this again a couple of years later and we still loved it. We didn't bake it in the oven, just pan-fried it with a little olive oil. I did spray it beforehand with cooking spray. Used exactly the amount of spices it calls for with some chicken tenderloins but it barely covered all the chicken, so I would probably up it next time. We had this with mushroom pasta straight from the box (that didn't have MSG) and a beautiful salad. I want to eat this meal every week!

Pretty gOod! Not enough seasoning though and I even doubled it. I will make even more next time so I can cover both sides of the chicken. Not quite spicy (hot) enough for me so I will put waaaay more cayenne in it next time. I only heated my pan about 7 mins like others suggested and it was just fine. It didn't smoke up very much...I thought it would be much worse. My chicken breasts were giant so I pounded them out and put them in the oven for 20 mins...just right! I will change a couple things next time but this recipe is defintely a keeper! ThanXx!!~

I loved this.  Couple of things:  I didn't use a cast-iron pan, and it worked beautifully.  I heated the pan, but not the oil for 15 minutes (then heated the oil) as somebody recommended--it worked beautifully.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

I started not to follow the directions and cook this entirely in the cast iron skillet. I come from a family that we blackened something almost once a week and this was as close to my dad's secret blend as I have ever tasted. I followed the directions and finishing up in the oven really locked in the juices and kept the chicken so moist. I will be making up a jar of this "Gun Powder" (as my dad calls his blend) and will be doing this again and will try on fish as well! Thanks!!!!

I really like this seasoning mix.  I cooked the chicken different by taking a small breast and pounding it out some, heating a small skillet on high for a minute then adding EVVO and 2 T butter and as soon as it got hot and bubbly added the chicken and put the lid on it on almost high heat after about 1 minute you could see the breast turning white, I turned off the heat flipped the chicken put the lid back on on and cooked on the other side for 1-2 minutes then it was done.  I eat low carb and this is very good, I took the pan juices and added 1/2 tsp jarred crushed garlic stirred around for a few seconds then drizzled over some prepared spinach.  MMM I am making a large jar of the to keep on hand.

Excellent recipe Karena!! Took some advice from "KELALAKE" and heated up my cast iron skillet with no oil. I could certainly see how heating up the oil would create a lot of smoke. Just before placing my chicken in the pan I brushed the pan with the oil and let it sit for about ten seconds. I did not have any MAJOR smoke problems at all and the chicken was so incredibly juicey and tender.(yes, with all meat, let it rest so the juices redistribute) I made the rub a bit more spicey because my older teenage daughter has an iron clad mouth, but you can adjust it to your own taste. Again, thanks Karena!

5 stars for flavor. However, I did change the cooking method a bit due to the smoke in the house. Sprayed skillet with Pam and let it heat up for 2-3 minutes, placed large Amish chicken breasts (coated with seasonings) in skillet and seared them on both sides for 1-2 minutes and baked them for 25-30 minutes on baking sheet, sprayed with Pam. Very good, tender and juicy!

I've gotten some great recipes for blackened chicken, so I thought this one would also be good-quick and easy. I had to sear both sides of the chicken for much longer than a minute each, and I had to cook the chicken in the oven for 30 minutes. On top of the extra time, my husband and I thought this was extremely bland. We ended up drenching the chicken in barbeque sauce!

Excellent!  I'll make this again for sure (despite the smokey kitchen it was worth it).  I used peanut oil and heated it for 2-3 minutes instead of 15.  The chicken still got a wonderful deep color even without heating the oil longer.

I doubled the amount of seasoning rub and put it on both sides.  I also pounded the breasts thinner and baking them for 6 minutes resulted in perfect chicken!

This recipe was great!  Five stars for ease and speed of preparation.  The only negative is that the  spice mixture could use a little more zip in my opinion but this is easily solved.

Like others, I DOUBLED ALL THE AMOUNTS in order to RUB BOTH SIDES OF THE CHICKEN.  This spice rub provides an excellent albeit a bit mild (for my tastes) flavor, so I would not recommend seasoning only one side of the chicken.  In addition, I also heated my oil for a mere two minutes prior to using as it gets hot very quickly and I have had one kitchen fire in the past due to overheating!

WOW!  Never had blackened chicken before, so I didn't know what to expect.  It was fantastic!  Now I know why they call it that, it looks burnt, but it's not!  Anyhow, omit the salt, it's not even needed with all the other seasonings included. I served this over mashed potatoes (with the leftover liquid from the pan since I didn't have any gravy) and corn and it was mmm mmm delicious!

This was ok. It is not spicy. I sprayed chicken breasts with cooking spray to ensure the spices stayed on the chicken. After heating on a hot grill pan needs to be in the oven for 30 min.

I love this recipe! The first time I made it I took the advice of some of the reviews and decreased the amount of cayenne pepper. Bad idea, it was no where near spicy enough. The recipe is great the way it is, except I don't heat the oil for 15 minutes and I bake the chicken for longer.

The chicken was good, but I think some oil needs to be added to the cast iron. I added a little bit, but it caused so much smoke all smoke detectors went off. This recipe does not call for oil, which I feel is a problem. I will try to make again but maybe use the grill instead to get the chicken crispy.

Great spices, simple to make. I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet on the grill. No smoke or mess in the house. My wife is not a fan of a lot of spice, so I just put less of the mixture on her portion. Works like a charm.

Great, fast, and easy! My mother has sodium restrictions, so this was perfect. Going forward I'm going to prepare this seasoning mix beforehand and fill an old spice jar to the brim to save on time when I make it again.

I doubled up on the recipe and skipped the cast iron skillet. Cooked each side for a minute or two on a regular skillet, then baked for 15 minutes in a glass casserole dish (at 325 degrees F...always 25 degrees less when using glass). Looked great, smelled great, tasted wonderful. Like the other reviewer said, don't cut into it upon first removing from the oven. Let the juices set for a few minutes. Adding this one to my regular rotation.

EXCELLENT and for those watching their sodium intake not salty at all. In fact the only salt (1/8th of a teaspoon) could have been left out entirely.  Flavor was excellent (even the very very picky wife agreed and said I could do that again.  Did the initial blackening in a smoking hot cast iron skillet as directed for 1 minute on each side.  Chicken came from the oven very moist (took a little longer than the 5 minutes the recipe calls for (probably because of the size of the breasts)) and went great sliced on a salad.

Very easy to make and except for the time in the oven it took only about 10 minutes counting all the measuring of spices and chopping of vegetables for the salad (the latter of which can be done while the chicken is in the oven.

bottom line:  we're both very pleased and will be doing this again.

This "Blackened Chicken" had a really quite a nice blend of spices. I wouldn't hesitate to make it again. I flattened my chicken breasts so they were like schnitzel so more of the surface area of the chicken would be browned and also because I was cooking it in my Le Creuset cast-iron oven dish the same way I cook salmon (See Allrecipes' video on how to cook salmon) (not according the recipe instructions). I also oiled my chicken with olive oil (rather than sprayed it with cooking spray). I think this chicken would be lovely in a "hot chicken salad" if paired with the right mayo-based dressing. I will fill a spice bottle with this mixture for a "convenience food" (perfect busy-day meal). Thank you Karena for sharing your recipe.

So perfectly seasoned !! This will be my new go to. And I love that you only need one dish. I just popped the cast iron right in the oven. I served it over fettuccini. My whole household loved this one . The only change I made was adding some Cajun seasoning for a little more heat. Update i didn't notice the recipe said 5 minutes in to oven. That isn't nearly enough time : ( 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes is more reasonable

Fantastic and easy recipe! My Family loved it! I altered the cayenne pepper to 1/8 tsp to cut down on the heat and added a tad of garlic salt. Definitely a repeat at our house.

Tasty and quick chicken recipe.  Although we had to cook our chicken breast much longer than 5 minutes in the oven - after 5 minutes, it was still raw.  It took probably another 10 minutes or so.  Would definitely make again - good flavors.

The cooking time is underestimated because I took it out of the oven and half the chicken was still pink. Luckily I didn't serve it as is.

Fantastico!  I did not have dried thyme so I used poultry seasoning since thyme is the main ingredient. I think the cumin kicks it up a notch.  My 12 yr old son loved it - told me to "make it again real soon".  It's so quick and easy to throw together.  Can't wait to try on pork chops.

Nothing special. Was quick and easy but definitely needed more flavor.  I added garlic powder, should have been garlic salt.  The spice measurements are not enough for 2 chicken breasts, need to double.

I tried this with fish and it was just as amazing! although, if you can't handle a lot of heat I suggest using only 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper. my mouth was on fire with 1/4 tsp!

Pretty good spice mixture. Double it if you are making the amount of chicken in the recipe. NYPD K9 COP made very good suggestions. However, I would leave the chicken out maybe about a half hour prior to cooking. Using just a little bit of oil helps as well. Sear both sides for about a minute then put a lid on the pan for about 4 minutes each side. Check for done-ness because it depends on the thickness of the chicken.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe. It is a bit spicy, but we put it with mashed potatoes and it was a great combination. When making this dish, make sure you have plenty of ventilation in your kitchen, as we had a lot of smoke rolling all over the house. We definitely will make this again!

I liked this recipe, but didn't love it. I added garlic powder and cooked only on the stove top like others had suggested. They were juicy and spicy, I just felt like they were missing something. I will make these again with a bit more experimentation.

Absolutely delicious.  The spice rub would do for any meat.  Today I had a quail to cook and I roasted it with this rub.  I was right - fantastic.  I used the exact measures, so my bird was well covered.  The spiced oil left in the roasting pan will do nicely to cook other meat.

This was much too spicy for me, but my husband loved it.  Next time, I'll go easy on the spice for my piece.  Other than being just too hot for me it was good.

I wanted some grilled chicken to top a salad for dinner the other night and I selected this recipe for the seasoning blend.  I doubled it as other reviewers mentioned, but I still didn’t have enough for two largish chicken breast halves.  So, next time I will increase the seasonings even further.  I lightly coated my chicken with EVOO, then tossed it in a plastic bag with the seasonings.  I skipped the skillet/oven step and simply grilled these.  They were very tasty atop our entrée salad.  I would definitely make this again.

I followed the directions and after the 5 minutes in the oven the chicken was still half raw... 25 minutes later the chicken was done, and the rest of our meal was cold.  As far as flavor goes, not your traditional blackened chicken. Lacks the kick and tasted rather bland.  Instead of tweaking this recipe to make it work I'm just going to find a new one.

This was great. Make sure you have oppened windows or some sort of venting system. It gets really smokey and hard to see quick!

Simple, easy, great flavor, SPICY and was a nice alternative to ordinary chicken.  I didn't have any onion powder on hand and added a smidge more cayenne, but other than that, I wouldn't have changed a thing and will add in the onion powder next time.  A definite keeper..

Love this recipe.  I did not use as much butter as the recipe required, actually I didn't use any.  I used Olive oil and it turned out great.  THIS IS A KEEPER!

I've made this many times and I like to use boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  A lot more moist.  I make a large amount of the seasoning, which makes it easy and a go-to Cajun seasoning. Really good!

We love this chicken! Just like someone else said I changed the serving size to 20 and keep a jar of this rub on hand. I put it on both sides of the chicken breast, I don't spray the breasts at all, I just rub it in. I sear it on both sides in a Cast Iron Skillett for about 1-1.5 mins on each side and then cook it in the oven for about 20-25 mins. Then I take it out and let it sit for about 5-10 mins and then cut it up and serve it over romaine lettuce with some parmesan cheese and caesar dressing for a Chicken Caesar Salad. It's awesome!!

Wow this is a great quick meal. Put those herbs/spices together/sear/cook/BAM done. Made with the Mexican Rice and they paired real well. I had 2 big huge breasts that I cut in half and I should have doubled the herbs/spices but still came out nice.

Very Spicey! This is my first time making Jerk chicken and my family liked it. I paired it with a salad of baby mixed greens and roasted cauliflower. I had to cook it much longer than 5min in the oven, but I also made more chicken. I cooked 6 chicken breasts for 30 min and they came out just right.

Perfect.  I used the mix for chicken and then we grilled it.  Seared it on both sides and then took it off to the side of the grill (no charcoal) to finish.  My husband could NOT stop eating it.  This morning he even commented again that it was the best blackened chicken he's ever eaten.   Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was so delicious. But I did smoke up my entire apartment, my dad thought I was burning down the house. But I will still make this again. I did only oil the breast but I think I have a cheap cast iron skillet. I also seared the chicken alittle longer and they baked for close to 40 mins at 375. Maybe they were just too thick. I was worried the inside may not have any flavor but that was not the case, this recipe made a flavorful and juicy breast. I think I will try this without the oil next time so this can be extra healthy.

Yummy!  I also use this seasoning on tilapia and it is great.  Instead of baking the fish, I just leave it in the frying pan until it's done.  So yummy!

I made this for dinner tonight - it was great! I used about twice as much spice and added chipotle and a dash of cinnamon. I served it with black beans and rice, and I wish I had made some cornbread too... next time :) I will make this again and again!

My husband loves blackened anything, so I when I found this, I knew I had to try it.  It was spicy enough to please him, but not so spicy I couldn't eat it.  I generally steer clear of blackened meats because they are incredibly salty.  I was very excited to see that the recipe called for so little salt.  I didn't have white pepper on hand, so I used black instead--still delicious.  I didn't bake it, though.  I cooked it in my grill skillet with a touch of canola oil for about 7-10 mins per side.  I served with brown rice and green and hazelnut recipe I found here.  

I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was DELICIOUS!! Only change I've done was cooked the chicken breast longer than 5 minutes within the oven. I cooked it for half an hour w/sweet potatoes, corn, onions and black beans and covered it w/aluminum foil. The chicken came out super moist and tender!!

Well I thought I had all of the ingredients :( I didn't have the paprika so I used Cajun spice in it's place.  I found it a bit on the spicey side but my 11 year old son said this was GOOD and it should be made again!!

I loved this! But I, by mistake, altered some of the spices, but it turned out really GREAT!! I doubled the spices, forgot the paprika, but added curry instead! Boy I'm glad I did! :D. I also added a tsp of olive oil. I didn't have white pepper so I used black. When cooking, it didn't "burn" like I wanted it to, but it ended up being super moist yummy chicken! Can't thank you enough!! I cut it up and added it to a vegetable saute, and served it with curry wild rice, mashed potatoes and sweet corn :).

I did this exactly as described with the exception of cooking method. I just grilled for 6 minutes on each side with the grill at about 400 degrees. Great flavor and the perfect amount of kick!

I liked it, my only 'complaint' would be that it is almost TOO flavorful. I wanted a yummy chicken recipe that I could make and put on my salads, and this was delicious but just overwhelmed the salad. Perhaps it would be good in a mexican type salad, but for chicken caeser it just was too much. However, that said, it was sooo yummy and I recommend it to anyone who likes spicy, flavorful chicken.

Great everyday recipe especially when you want to get dinner on the table fast and you have not marinated anything overnight.  I doubled the seasoning and butterflied the chicken breast. I cooked each side for 4 minutes and skipped the oven. I added a pat of butter to the pan for some moisture towards the end of cooking. Seasoning penetrated well and was balanced. I served with red beans and rice from a box and canned corn. I will make this again.

This was good, but be warned it is SPICY! I love spicy food so this was a hit with me, but the kids couldn't tolerate it. I grilled it instead of baking it and it tasted really good!

need to reduce the cayenne next time (SOOO spicy!), but this was extremely delicious. and everyone is right, double the spice mixture as it barely spreads to all the chicken.

Love this recipe, though I have had to change it up a little.  I times it by 8, but keep the cayenne pepper at 1/4 tsp, and the thyme at 1/4 tsp.  I tried the thyme at the recommended amount once, and it was overpowering, so I backed it down, and then cayenne - well I just can't do THAT much.  Also, when I cook the chicken I just keep it in the pan for the whole cook time.  I found this recipe when the husband kept asking me to make fettuccine alfredo with blackened chicken, as it was one of his favorite dishes, and I finally tried with this recipe and another on this site for alfredo sauce - and I knocked it out of the park.  He said it tasted better than in a restaurant.  It's now one of my favorite dishes to make - and it's so easy!  I love making chicken this way.

I love everything about this recipe. I followed it to a T, and I came out juicy and wonderful.  I heated my oil too hot, though, and I had an oil "fog" in my kitchen for the rest of the night, but my husband and I agreed that it was well worth it!

I turned this dish into chicken kabobs and grilled them.  Added red peppers, onions, pinapples and mushrooms.  Soaked the peppers, onions and mushrooms in soysause before cooking.  The chicken was a good flavor.

So tasty!! I followed the advice of another reviewer and just left in on the stove top for about 4-5 minutes on each side! I used breast filets which are thinner! So yummy on a baked potato with veggies or in salad! I don't mind eating THESE leftovers!!!

This recipe is healthy and yummy!!! The only thing I have to say is the chicken took longer than 5 minutes to cook in the oven. It ended up being about 20 mintues.

I really enjoyed this blackened spice!  I had to change a few things... I used black pepper because i don't have white and I used garlic powder instead of onion powder (because i didn't have any onion powder either)  I thought the garlic added great flavor!  I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was extremely easy and delicious. I followed the cooking directions exactly... my only changes were in accordance with one of the other reviewers - I doubled all the spices but I left the dried (I used ground) thyme at 1/4 teaspoon. After cooking it in a smoking hot pan for 1 minute on each side, I let the chicken cook for 11 minutes in the oven. I probably could've taken it out at 9-10 minutes but I wanted to make sure the chicken was waiting for the juices to run. The chicken was extremely moist and flavorful! I think this would be perfect to serve with corn and roasted or mashed potatoes. This is definitely a recipe I'll be making again and again!

Yummy! I made these into sandwhiches- so tastey! I also cooked them all the way on the stove, it did get a little smokey but it turned out awesome- mosit on the inside charred on the outside. I will be making this often. I paired these sandwiches with "Cajun Style Baked Sweet Potato" from this website- a great meal.

This was just ok.  Made as written but cut in half for just one chicken breast - had barely enough seasoning.  Was only slightly spicy. Just not something I'll make again, most likely.

This was quick, easy and tasty. The chicken came out SO moist and tender, I only needed to bake it for about 10 mins to finish cooking. I love spicy food but the cayenne was a little overpowering to me and blocked out a lot of the other flavors in my opinion so I may try toning it down a bit next time.

This was really good. I did change it a little though.  I doubled the amount of seasonsing though my chicken breast was very large and in 3rds.  I also put the seasonings on chicken a few hours ahdead of time so it could soak in.  I cooked it in the skillet the whole time with a small amount of olive oil.  Just the right amount of spicy and definantly will make it again

This was DELICIOUS! My first attempt at blackened anything, and it was a huge success.  The only problem was that it smoked up the house so much, that my boyfriend had to leave for a bit. I added more cayenne than I should have maybe - and the smoke became kind of toxic (nothing serious!).  But - I'll make it again for sure, and I think I'll take another reviewers advice and use spray butter instead of oil. That might help with the smoke.

I have never made anything like this before. This was the best chicken I have ever made. I put the chicken over salad and my kids could not get enough. This is one that we will use all the time. Thanks.

Tried this tonight, it was FANTASTIC!  A little spicy for my 7 year old, but everyone else loved it.  I doubled it and used thin cut chicken breasts...don't have a cast iron skillet, so I just got a regular nonstick pan super hot, fried four of them together for a minute on each side, then put them on the cookie sheet in the oven for ten minutes.  When I pulled them out of the oven to check them for doneness, they were like BUTTER :)  Served them sliced on a simple salad with fat free ranch dressing....soooo good!

I used this seasoning for Tilapia instead of Chicken.  I also sauteed it in a non-stick pan with olive oil, as I don't have a cast iron skillet.  I have a very happy hubby (sounds like a song title!) sitting next to me, he said "wow that's great fish... what'd you do to it"  :-)   Thanks Karena for a simple tasty seasoning for chicken or fish!

Rather tasty, we might play with it a bit as both my husband and I missed a bit of heat.   It made my whole kitchen very smokey though!

Pretty good. It was spicy but we did 4x what the recipe called for because we had a lot of chicken. This was easy, fast, and low calorie! Smoked up the apartment, but worth it.

This was fantastic, the only problem I had was all of the smoke from blackening it, all of the spices that came up from the smoke, was making me cough for a while.

Mild, great tasting seasoning for chicken! I really enjoyed this rub on beer butt chicken! I will definitely make it again for that. I did add a little sprinkle more salt on the outside of the chicken. Next time, I think I will up the cayenne. It didn't really have any 'kick', but it tasted just like store-bought rotisserie. Thank you very much.

This was very good on the grill.  I tripled the spices and my husband thought double would have been enough, but I liked it.  I didn't have white pepper so I used garlic pepper and served it with a cold ceasar salad.

Really Really Good!  I took the easy route and used Old Bay's Blackening spices.  Then I fried in skillet but baked the chicken for 15 minutes at 250 to really get the chicken nice and moist.  This is a definite do-again!

This was really good. My husband didn't think it looked like enough so made about 3x as much coating & it was really spicy but we had it with coleslaw on top anyway so that helped. Next time will  make it as written.

REALLY good!  Served with a homemade Alfredo sauce & pasta.  I don't have a cast iron skillet, so just put in my regular pan before it went into the oven.  Was in there for more like 30 minutes in order to get cooked.  Very good & will be making again for sure!

I baked the whole thing and just did away with the skillet.  It was easier and baking generally tastes a little lighter to me.  I also used more pepper and substituted oregano for the thyme since I didn't have any on hand.  It was a very taste dish!

This was pretty good.  I'd never had blackened chicken before; the spices were very nice.  It did, however, give the smoke detector quite a workout!

Was not impressed with this recipe. It is quick to fix but the heating of the skillet and oil made a lot of unpleasant aroma in the house, the chicken was moist but not memorable.

Ok, I was looking forward to making this and really wanted it to turn out well.  Unfortunately, we really didn't care for this.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I only heated the pan for 5 minutes, in an effort to reduce the smoke other reviewers complained about, and I added a little garlic powder.  For us, the cumin and paprika really overpowered the chicken and other spices.  It wasn't too spicy, like some complained about, but more overpowering than anything else.

Very moist. I spiced both sides of the chicken and added garlic powder, a must!
Fried right in the pan, not needed to transfer to oven.

Great flavor.  I pounded the chicken to 1/4" thick and served it in a sandwich with harvarti and deli mustard...A nice twist on chicken.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  We like things hot so I increased the cayenne with about 3 times as much as the recipe called for.  I also doubled the other spices and added garlic powder.  The cast iron skillet is the key to this recipe.  It worked great starting it on the stove & transferring to the oven.  Mine was very moist & juicy... perfectly wonderful!

Yum! I never knew how to blacken and this was fabulous. I did not think it was too spicy at all

Tried using both black & white pepper. OUTSTANDING BOTH WAYS! What a great flavor and can't believe how moist it turns out.   I seasoned up some frozen chicken breast(because I could not wait to thaw), fried in a pan for a few minutes. Then cooked the chicken on the gas grill for the remaining time.   All I can say is....WOW!!!  Will definetly use this recipe more often.

YUM!!! I've been using this recipe for several years. I make this in large batches and put in a spice jar. I don't blacken my chicken, but instead I cube my chicken, either throw it in a bag with some spice (unmeasured) and marinate, or sprinkle it over the chicken after it's already in the pan.  I always add Alfredo sauce & serve over pasta.  Thanks for a reliable standby!

Yummy - I doubled the spices, but next time I may even triple or quadruple.  I also added garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and cajun seasoning instead of salt.  I didn't take them out of the skillet, just put it right in the oven to finish.  This is really good on a nice green salad.

We loved this!  My chicken came packaged as 3 breasts.  So I doubled the spice mix, and it was perfect.  I cooked in my pre-heated cast iron skillet (only pre-heated it about 5-7 minutes), used olive oil, and cooked about 5-9 minutes each side, depending on the size of the breast - they weren't all the same size.  I did not cook them in the oven at all.  They were delicious.  My husband and son loved them, and I will be making them again. I served them over the Cajun Pasta Fresca recipe on this site.

Followed the recipe exactly. Didn't care for the spice combination at all. This is not anything like any Cajun style blackened chicken I've ever had - and that's what I expect when I think of blackened chicken. The spices are all wrong. I am giving three stars - because the cooking method is great - and the chicken came out very moist. I took one reviewer's suggestion and let it 'sit' for 10 minutes - so we were able to scrape off the spices and enjoy plain juicy chicken.

Excellent.  I doubled the seasoning and rubbed on both sides of two huge chicken breast I trimmed and butterflied.  I had a smokey kitchen, but I opened the windows and it was well worth it.  Served with homemade baked beans and cornbread.  I loved how flavorful it was with not a lot of salt.  Yum!  Will make again.

This recipe was just "okay". Yes, the chicken was moist, but not very flavourful or spicy.  I followed the recipe exactly, and used premium ingredients. There was almost no "heat", and the chicken was on the bland side.  I get better results with store bought "Montreal Chicken Spice"...sorry.

Excellent flavor! I pounded the chicken breasts flat, had my husband grill these, and served this with cajun-mayo on an onion bun with sliced MJ cheese. Awesome! I added a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and some ground chipotle chile pepper as well. Just the right amount of heat in these.

Delicious flavor! Be careful though with the iron skillet on high heat!  My whole  kitchen was smoky.  Next time I will heat my skillet on medium high. Best ever blackened chicken.  Served with homesteader cornbread!  Thanks

I love cajun chicken pasta and this is by far the closest thing to a restaraunts blackened chicken that you will find.  I cook it on a george foreman and it comes out great everytime.  I also prepare a box of Pasta Roni usually the Angel Hair with Herbs, or Parmesean flavored, cut up the chicken, and serve as my own Homemade Cajun Chicken Pasta, SOOOOO GOOD!!!

I am always making this. For salads, sandwiches, or just as a meal.  The spices are something I made in bulk and use it as a spice for many other things.  Now my bf loves to use it when he cooks. I always use kosher salt and olive oil for this recipe.  Thanks to whoever posted this!

We loved this recipe. I mixed the seasonings with some olive oil and marianted the chicken, as mentioned by another reviewer. We made kabobs and cooked them on the grill. Very moist and tender. It was a hit. Will definitely keep!

This was fantastic. I cooked it fully in the pan, but then covered it in foil and put it on the bottom shelf of the oven to keep warm while other things were cooking. It was lovely! So moist and tasty. Will definately do this again.

This recipe is really good.  I have made it a few times and every time I just season both sides with the mix.  I also use olive oil instead of veg. oil. I also serve this like a salad with fresh spinach.  I made it for my step mom who doesn't usually like much seasoning on anything and she got seconds.

Perfect. Only problem is the smoke in the kitchen. Paired this up with "to die for alfredo pasta". The chicken was the winner of both recipes.

I hate to wreck the otherwise good reviews, but i really wasn't that into this. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with VERY bland tasting chicken breasts that had one spicy, but not really flavorful, side. I've had blackened chicken and loved it before, but this tasted like BLAH chicken with spiciness on it.  no flavor at all, just some spicy.  my bf thought it was pretty blah too.  any suggestions?

Great chicken recipe.  My only problem was that it needed a lot longer in the oven to get completely done.  Next time I will pound the chicken breast flat so that there is more surface area for the blackened seasoning and it will cook faster.

Great chicken recipe.  The juices are seared in so it is very moist.  Another plus is that this recipe is low fat/low cal!  I love things hot and spicy, and this one was great. I seasoned both sides of the chicken instead of just one side, because I really like it hot!

I was surprised how easy this was to make yet how delicious it turned out!  I didn't have white pepper, so I used black pepper instead.  My only suggestion would be to add a little bit more salt. I will definitely make this again (and be sure to keep your windows open!)

This was surprisingly good. When I looked at the list of ingredients, I was expecting a lot of spice but not much flavor. Boy, was I wrong! This was delicious. 

I didn't have any onion powder or white pepper, so I substituted garlic powder  and black pepper instead. The only thing I'll do differently next time is maybe decrease the cayenne pepper a bit, as I had to have a glass of milk handy while I was eating. If you're a person who really likes spice, however, I'd say don't change a thing. My boyfriend LOVED it!

This recipe was so, so easy and good!  I had wanted to find a good blackened chicken recipe forever, and this is it!  Seriously, so yummy.  It does smoke a bit, but as long as you know to turn on your fan ahead of time it doesn't get too bad.  Also, this is a bit spicy, so keep that in mind.  After searing both sides in the frying pan I broiled them to make the cooking go faster.  They came out juicy and deliscious.  I served the breasts chopped over a ceasar salad.  I will definitely make this many more times!

This recipe was absolutly fabulous. Definatly not for the person who is afraid of flavor. I took advice from other readers and did not heat my oil for 15 minutes. And it didn't create smoke like other readers insisted. Although, i did open my window just a crack and took the battery out of the smoke detector. 
Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!! Will DEFINATLY use this again!

GREAT!!! This recipe was absolutely wonderful! I used it to make my own, homemade blackened chicken salad (like the one served in Applebee's). I cooked it stovetop and served it diced over a bed of greens, eggs, tomatoes, carrots, and shredded cheese with hot bacon mustard dressing....YUMMY!!! I don't need to pay $8 for this salad anymore....I can make it whenever I want. YYIIIPPPPEEEE!!! Thanks so much for sharing this one, Karena!

Wow! What a wonderful meal.  I made this recipe for a small gathering, and the entire group LOVED it!  Important to spice and season to taste, whereas I like all my foods with a bit more of a spicy bite.

Upon reading other reviews, I was initally concered about how my chicken would turn out when it didn't set off the smoke alarm, but it ended up turning out wonderful! I would suggest cutting thicker breasts into 2 thinner filets to ensure that cooking is speedy. Totally delightful, I will certainly be making this many more times!

The spices are right on.  I make this recipe and then cut the chicken into cubes and add to fettuccini alfredo.  Found seasoning both sides of chicken when using adds a kick to an already great meal.

This was excellent! Tasty and good for you.  A few notes: I did what other reviewers suggested and pounded the chicken flatter and I'm glad I did as it sped up the process.  Also, there was definitely not enough spice mix this way thought so I'd double it next time.

This was very juicy and tender! My fiance made it and didn't know that he had to heat the oil for 15 minutes before cooking it, so it wasn't all that blackened. It was still very tasty to eat. Served with baked potato and italian bread.

This tasted just like the cajun restaurants make. It took no time at all and was just the right amount of spicyness. However, my kitchen did get VERY smoky with the pan being so hot so I recommend having a fan on so the smoke detector doesn't go off.

Thought this recipe was super.  I have just started cooking....literally just over the past couple of days.  I am out of school on break and my mom insists that I cook while I have nothing to do. :)  It was easy and the reviews really, really helped.  I reduced the cayenne pepper just a bit, added some garlic salt, used pam in the skillet on the stove and only warmed for a couple of minutes.  I also cooked the chicken in the oven for probably 40-45 minutes.  The chicken breasts that I had were pretty large and I also cooked about 8 instead of 2.  This turned out great and everyone loved it.  I served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Thanks for the recipe!

It definitely has a cajun taste to it. I pounded the chicken breasts to make them thinner,rubbed spice on both sides, heated a regular skillet, added the oil, let that get hot, added the chicken - cooked for a min. or two on each side -then put the skillet in the oven and cooked for about 15 min.  A real quick meal.  Will make again.

We love this recipe!  It tasted just like the blackened chicken I order out for $15 a dinner. I didn't have a cast iron skillet and used an electric skillet instead and it still tasted great.  Will make this again and again.

I absolutely love blackened chicken but had never attempted to make it myself using the excuse that it was probably to hard to make. I looked to see if I could find a recipe and found this one. The flavor is the same as what I get at my favorite cajun restaurant. It was very easy to make. My thanks to whoever submitted this wonderful recipe!!

Dear God, this was hot!  I almost couldn't eat it.  I will make it again and drastically decrease, if not eliminate, the cayenne pepper.  I would also add a lot more salt, and maybe some garlic powder.

This is a very good recipe. I added a bit more salt to it, but that was all. My husband says "This recipe is better than Paul Prudhomme's. It has an excellent blend of flavors in the seasoning."

SO GOOD! This was my first time making chicken! I am a broke college student that is on a budget so any food I come across with "reusable ingredients", I go with it! I spent about $15 on the spices TOTAL. I buy once and can use them for 2 years. The chicken wasn't spicy but definitely had some spice to it. Very amazing. I cooked for 2 of my friends and they loved it too. Highly recommend!!

There was not enough seasoning if you are using larger breasts. May be too spicy for some. My family loved it!!! Made it with grilled corn and rice.

Used thin cut chicken breasts. Omit salt and thyme, used Cajun seasoning instead. Added 1/4 tsp garlic powder. Seared in cast iron pan longer and in oven just to keep warm.

This was my first attempt and it was pretty good. Unfortunately I was missing some of the spices, and had to make to do.  

Can't wait to try this again!!

I doubled the spice amounts, which really worked out perfectly. I had regular sized chicken breast halves, which are somewhat thick in spots, so it took much longer than 5 minutes in the oven. Perhaps 5 minutes would work if the breasts were pounded out thin. It ended up being delicious!

Great combo of spices with a little heat. I don't like white pepper, so I substituted that with smokehouse black pepper. I also grilled it instead of the recommended directions. Delicious! I've since filled a shaker with it to have on hand.

Turned out really good. Spicy enough to know it is blackened chicken but not so much that it couldn’t be enjoyed. Everyone liked it and we’ve added this to our favorites. Adjusted the oven time to about 30 minutes as the breasts were fairly large but that was the only change made.

Nice and hot. I cook this regularly.  5 minutes in the oven just won’t do.  More like 12 to 15 minutes at 400. Oops, never thought  about slicing the breast in half sideways. I’ll try that next time. What is this smoking oil others are talking about? The recipe doesn’t call for any oil in the pan other than the oil to spray on the chicken before the rub is applied. It does smoke a bit and the smell could bite your nostril if you bend too much over the pan.

Excellent recipe and directions. Juicy inside and visually pleasant outside. 
It came out to be a much easier way to cook for the week. Sliced for snacks, as an entree or sliced to use in a sandwich instead of cold cuts, cut into cubes for a salad or with pasta.

This is great.  Also it totally fits in with the weight watchers diet.  Next time I will flatten the chicken breasts before putting the spices on...I did double the spice.  Will definitely make it again.

This was so good!  I didn't have onion powder, so I used garlic salt and skipped the table salt.  I also made double the spice.  As others mentioned, it took much longer than 5 minutes in the oven.  But they came out juicy and spicy.  Delicious!

I didn't,  and won't, change a thing.  I'll double it though  - I want it on both sides generously.  I'll be making a container full and taking it to the lake this summer.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

Full disclosure: I didn't measure any quantities of my spices- I eyeballed it. I just used this mix and chicken preparation. I overdid it with the cayenne pepper but otherwise this chicken was DELICIOUS! Already planning to adjust and make it again. Tender, juicy and flavorful. Would go great on its own with a side, or in a salad.

Made this recipe with swordfish instead of chicken. The fish was tender and juicy inside and the outside flavor was delicious.  We cut the cayenne in half since my family doesn’t like really like spicy food.  Also I made a side sauce that combined sour cream with a small amount of sriracha and cumin.

This was very good and easy to make. You can dress it up with side dishes for company, or keep it simple for a week day meal.
To be clear: Nowhere does it say to put the oil directly in the pan.  The oil goes directly on the chicken before the spices.

Other than quadrupling the recipe, we made it as written and everyone (including my teenagers) loved it.  It did take longer than 5 mins in the oven, more like 15-20 and I cut my breasts in half so they are thin.  We served it over fettuccine alfredo.  We all thought it had the perfect heat.  Great recipe.  Easy to make.  Thanks for sharing.

Great! Has a nice spicy kick to it. Now sure how much this changed the flavor, but I just cooked the chicken on the stovetop the whole way through. Served it with yellow rice, it made a good combo.

Super fantastic flavor. I followed others suggestions about doubling the spices, really wouldn't be shy with adding more! Also, instead of using two larger chicken breasts, I used 4 smaller sized ones.  Seared in the pan for about 3-4 mins each side, then baked in the oven for about 10-12 minutes. The chicken came out super juicy and flavorful. Perfect to slice and put on top of my Gorgonzola cream sauce gnocchi.

This is a quick recipe to make and it's very tasty and easy.  Keep this recipe handy for a day when you don't think you have time to cook. It's also calorie friendly.  It would also make a good sandwich..... Great recipe!

Excellent recipe, I did not have Thyme so I substituted Poultry seasoning in its place, I could not tell the difference. My friends who I served this too all asked for the recipe.

This was my first time cooking blackened chicken. I left out the onion only because my husband is allergic to onions. I also cut the breasts in half and pounded them. Then I dredged them in melted butter. Then I rubbed in the spices. I cooked them in the very hot cast iron pan for three minutes on each side. I served them over salad. They were very tender! The spices were great!

First time cooking a chicken breast and it was delicious! My husband loved the cajun taste from the paprika and cayenne pepper. I added garlic powder to this seasoning mix for a little extra flavor. 

My chicken breasts are a little more on the thicker side so I had to cook mine for a total of 15 minutes. 

Paired great on top of caesar salad!

I love to cook though I kinda suck at it.  I found this recipe spicy enough for most.  The only thing I altered is I used oregano instead of thyme because that's all I had on the spice thing.  As far as the 1 review of a "dangerous fire", for one you typically don't cover cast iron, and for two you had it too hot.  Mine turned out perfect but the cooking time always doesn't work out quite right.  I cook way longer that the times stated.  Overall really enjoyed it!  My only question, after its seared in a cast iron pan, why not just put the hot pan in the pre-heated over?  Again, I'm far from a chef but just wondering if it would turn out the same.....

I will definitely make this again BUT...5 minutes in the oven wasn't nearly enough time. If you butterfly the breasts maybe this would be enough time but 15-20 minutes if not butterflied.

Just a clarification...  the breast halves required much more than 5 minutes to cook.  Suggest breast quarters cut quite thin.  Allows spices to taste more and will cook faster.

I only used this recipie for the spices on top of the chicken. I didnt cook it as suggested. I cooked it in the oven in a glass pan only. At 350 for probably 30 minutes. I added a small bit of butter to the pan for moisture.

I found that the best thing to serve with this is Zatarans yellow rice and I add a can of pineapple tidbits in with the rice. The sweet balances out the spices with the chicken.Wonderful!

I doubled the seasoning ingredients and cut my 2 chicken breasts into 3 slices since I had 3 folks to feed. I followed the advice of another reviewer and just cooked these on a really hot skillet. They came out great. Very moist and a little spicy since I double the seasoning.  You really need to serve these over something more bland like rice or Alfredo fettuccine noodles since the chicken is so flavorful. If you don't like it too spicy, just leave the recipe as is and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

Hubby has asked me to make this again 4 times since last night.

Read other reviews, cut down on thyme and added garlic powder. 

Just cooked on cast iron on stove, no need to put in oven.

I found that sprinkling the seasoning on rather than rolling the chicken in it worked better, and used spray on cooking oil and tenderized the chicken breasts. Also made it on a hot grill instead.

This blackened chicken recipe was DELICIOUS !!!  My somewhat picky husband LOVED the taste of this recipe and has asked me to make it again this week !!!!  I followed the directions exactly as Karena had laid out (including brushing the chicken breasts with vegetable oil before sprinkling the seasoning on them), and it turned out PERFECTLY !!!  I did throw in a teaspoon of garlic powder just for add'l flavoring.  I doubled the recipe (based on previous reviews) and it was PERFECT for two large chicken breasts !!!  Also, I seared the chicken breasts in a fry pan for approx 2 1/2 minutes per side before putting them on a tray in the oven for 20 minutes.  (And allowed them to cool for approx 5 minutes after pulling them out of the oven.)  Thanks Karena !!  I will make this dish a "regular" in our home, and highly recommend to others !!!  : )

Tastes  like blackened chicken!  Followed recipe practically as is, except left chicken in pan on stove instead of transferring to the oven.  Turned out perfect, tender on the inside, and full of crisp flavor on the outside.   Quick & healthy.  Oh, I doubled the seasoning blend and used all of it.  I will make a large amount of this seasoning blend to have on hand.

Followed the recipe as written for the great tasting chicken.  i also chopped up a green bell pepper, onion and 2 roma tomatoes. i used the same rub with a little olive oil on the chopped veggies and cooked them in the same iron skillet used for blacking the chicken. Warmed up 4 corn tortillas (placed them on top of the cooking veggies).  Then placed all on warmed plates for an outstanding meal for two.

The spices and overall method is great, however 5 minutes after a 1 minute sear is not enough. I did 7 mins/side for a total of 14 mins at 400 F. Was nice and juicy

This was delicious!  My family loved it, including my two year old.  The only thing I would do different is do a little less cayenne.  Was a little bit spicy.  Leftovers would be great on a salad!

This is an excellent recipe. Like others have said it needs to be cooked for at least 20 minutes. Mine came out raw when cooking only for five minutes in the oven. Also like other reviewers have said I think next time I make this recipe I'm going to double the amount of seasoning as it wasn't enough for two large breasts and I may pound the breasts to make them a bit flatter to cook faster.

It seems like it will taste good when it finally gets out of the oven. HOWEVER,  the cooking time is so off on this that the rest of my meal is ruined. I actually signed up for this site just to write this review, too. 

I cooked it at a higher temp than recommended and twice as long and it was still completely raw in the middle. Seriously??

This recipe was very tasty, but man oh man does it make you sneeze and your nose run! It smokes to high heaven when you are searing it, and I didn't even do it for that long, I just had a lot of chicken.  I tripled the seasonings but halved the thyme, added garlic powder, sage, southwest chipotle, nutmeg, and marjoram along some olive oil and rubbed both sides of the chicken and let sit for about an hour. I then seared it until it had some black on both sides but not totally blackened, then put it in the oven with some onions on top like another suggested at 375 for 35 minutes. Since my breasts were large, they took much longer than the time recommended. I turned them over halfway and after checking them put them in for another ten minutes. I sprinkled some lemon drops on them, then paired them with a salad, rice, corn, and salsa. It was REALLY good, and I look forward to making a taco out of the leftovers!

Very tasty. I used thighs, butter to coat, reduced the cayenne slightly and baked an extra 4 mins. Was very moist and well seasoned for my taste. Next time I'll pound the chicken out for a more even searing. Thanks  for this easy, delicious recipe.

Very easy, and tasty. May be a little too hot for some, but I liked the heat it had. If you do the mixture exactly as the recipe states you will be short on the mixture. I would add a little more of each ingredient than what the recipe calls for.

I cant stress how important it is to have a VERY hot pan when you begin to cook this. I let mine heat up for 3 minutes on high and it wasn't enough to really sear the meat.  I cooked it for more like 2 minutes on each side. Smoking hot was the key to making this great. Otherwise excellent and very easy. 

TIP:  You can check if the chicken is fully cooked through by inserting a fork, and then touching the fork to your upper lip (very sensitive). If it isn't very hot, then it will still be pink inside. I find this better than slicing the meat open.

Made about 4X the recipe amount. Followed the recipe exactly. I had a stopwatch from my phone ready to sear each side for 60 seconds. I have a 14" cast iron frying pan, it gets smoking hot and was perfect. It did not need oil because I oiled the chicken before sprinkling each side equally with spices. I also had the oven ready at 350 and cooked exactly 5 minutes. Before beginnning recipe I cut my fat breasts in half and they cooked perfectly in 5 minutes. I would think that a thick breast would need a couple of extra minutes to get the pink out of the middle.  My family loved it. It was so moist inside, cooked just enough to get out the pink but not dry it out in anyway. Some found the cayenne a bit hot, I would recommend toning it down, a person can always add more heat but if its too hot for a lightweight, they cant take it off.  I liked the heat but it was high on the heat side.

I double everything except for the cayenne pepper. Instead of rubbing the mixture on the breast, I applied a little bit of olive oil and laid the breast down flat on a plate with the ingredients spread out. I put some pressure on the breast in order to get the meat covered well. Did both sides.  I just put it in the frying pan until it was cooked with no pink spots. Turned out fantastic.

I made it strictly by the recipe. We use a good bit of blackened seasoning on fish, chicken and beef,  so I didn't want to be making it up every time I needed so I changed the calculator to make 144 servings which nicely filled a 2 cup glass container.  Now I have it ready whenever I need it, and enough if  cooking for a crowd, and I can share some if a guest wants a sample to try.  (Love the servings adjuster here by the way!).  One piece of advice I would offer is to use it sparingly if using on thin/fileted cuts of meat or fish, and not as a rub.  Using it as a rub puts a LOT of spice on the meat, and if you're not especially fond of spicy foods, you'll find this a little too hot, and the spiciness and heat take over the taste buds.  On thicker cuts, it would be okay as a rub.

Love this recipe! I have made this twice so far and it is by far a new family favorite. I did use olive oil instead of the cooking spray, and found the flavor still good. I also learned that cooking meat on high heat with a cast iron skillet makes the meat not stick to the pan! Double thanks!

This wasn't bad. 
However I do recommend opening some windows too. I have no idea what happened, but mine smoked terribly. I had the fan on max, the windows open, and the doors. My husband now calls it firetruck chicken....because that's who showed up!

Paired it with an Alfredo recipe shock works wonderfully. I left the chicken in for 20 minutes or so instead of 5. It came out tender and juicy, whole family loved it.

I don't have any thyme, but I added garlic powder and Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning to it. Took 20 minutes to cook Regardless, I usually throw the cooked chicken on some Alfredo noodles and steamed veggies for a meal-in-a-bowl. It's pretty tasty stuff.

A strong, spicy flavor, and very moist on the inside. Do make sure to use halves. Thighs work just as well. Be careful making too many, as this recipe can create a lot of smoke.

I made this recipe almost exactly as directed, except I doubled the recipe. (I also added garlic powder to the spice mixture, since I can't live without it!)

I really liked the flavor of the chicken, but I wish that I had thought to pound the breasts thinner because it came out a bit dry due to that it took much longer to cook than the recipe called for. Maybe this was because I didn't have a cast iron pan, not sure. 

All in all, family liked it and I will definitely attempt again with thinner chicken breasts! The blackening spice will be  a staple in my pantry from here on out too.

Loved this and so did my boyfriend. I didn't have dried Thyme on hand so I substituted Poultry seasoning in the same amount. I did have to triple the recipe to make enough seasoning to coat 2 butterflied chicken breasts. Followed the cooking instructions and thee results were excellent.

I made this and everyone loved it...the only problem I have is that it really smoked up the house.  I even put on the ceiling fans and opened the door before putting it on the cast iron skillet.  It's already been requested again!

It was good. It's gluten free and most of all, it was very easy.   It might have made 5 stars if I had seasoned it better, but it was good even on my first try.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Our kids thought it was way to spicy. I needed to double the dry ingredients in order to coat the chicken. I will definitely make this again but with half the cayenne pepper. Thx!

I am doing what I always hate for reviewers to do--I am rating this recipe in a little different form than it was written. I didn't mix up the cajun seasoning in the recipe; I used a cajun seasoning I had in my cupboard. Otherwise, though, I cooked this as written. I'm not really sure how long I baked the chicken. I cooked it until the juices ran clear. It was probably about twenty minutes. I served this chicken with the Cajun Pasta Fresca on this site. It was absolutely amazing! Chicken was juicy and very flavorful. I will have to say that I had to open up my window when sauteing the chicken because of the red pepper in the seasoning, but it was well worth it. Great recipe!

Yummy!  The only thing I did different was use black pepper instead of white and cooked it for longer in the oven.  5 minutes may be enough for a thin breast, but my normal sized ones needed an extra 40 minutes in the oven to cook all the way through.

The portions of seasoning in the recipe were a little light for my taste, so I added a bit more of each. Overall, the chicken was good.

I would definitely cook this again. I changed the recipe to five servings. I didn't have any white pepper so I cut that part out and my family isn't really fond of spiciness so I didn't use the cayenne pepper either I had to cook for ten min but when it came out it was so moist and juicy.

Really liked this recipe. I actually cooked my chicken opposite of what the recipe says because it was still slightly frozen. I baked it in the oven first then in a skillet. The chicken came out nice and juicy! Good Recipe.

I've made this several times now with success. I make minus the cumin, as our family does not like cumin. I x8 the recipe to pretty much fill a spice jar. My favorite use is to make blackened chicken on top of Alfredo pasta, so delicious! Simple but effective rub.

This is SMOKE-LESS (and I have the touchiest smoke detector ever made). If it smoked, you oiled the grill. Directions say to oil the Baking Sheet, and the Chicken.  I'm throwing out all my other chicken recipes. This is THAT good.  I doubled the seasoning, and added 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder per batch.  I pounded the chicken flat - used 3) large breasts cut into thirds before pounding. I sprinkled each side lightly but evenly. I baked them at 350 for the 5 minutes, then TURNED OVER & baked for 5 more minutes. Since the chicken was flat, this was perfect. Juiciest, most flavorful & easiest chicken I've ever made. Beautiful too.

Love this recipe! I tried it out one night, it's so good I'm having friends over and will fix it. I think my chicken was too thick, because it took a lot longer than 5 minutes in the oven. Think I will serve red beans and rice, corn on the cob, a big tossed salad and moon pies (allrecipe dessert recipe) with ice cream.

Pounded the breasts a bit flatter, added 1/3 tsp chipotle chili powder and 1/4 tsp garlic powder as well as reducing the cayenne to 1/8 tsp.  Delicious and still with plenty of kick!  I would cut these into strips and serve them like fajitas next time.  Some cool avocado to balance the heat will be awesome.

Very tasty, excellent recipe. My only comment: double or triple the spices in order to really have enough.

It was OK. I guess I like my chicken with a little crunch or glaze, this just wasn't to my liking.

It was easy, fast and delicious! I was pleasantly surprised by how juicy the chicken breast turned out. Even my 8 & 5 year olds liked it. It was just the right spicy.

the spice mixture was excellent with ingredients i already had on hand. instead of baking i used my smoker at 375 without a pan for 45 min. instead of breasts i used legs. chicken was outstanding and has been moved into one of my specialties.

I made this chicken for my husband tonight and he LOVED it! Better blackened chicken than you can get going out to eat! I rubbed a little olive oil on my chicken and coated it good with the seasoning then grilled it. wonderful flavor!

I really liked this recipe.  I cooked it a little differently as I didn't have a cast iron frying pan and it was too cold to BBQ.  I flattened the chicken breasts a little, added the seasoning and then cooked them on our George Foreman Grill.  They tasted wonderful and were really juicy.

This is a very good rub. I followed the recipe as stated, except I double everything except for the chicken after discovering that the recipe didn't make very much. Next time, I won't double the cayenne if I make it for guests because it was pretty spicy. This would be good barbequed too!

As a general rule, chicken's just not my bag.  I made this rub as stated (even included the white pepper), but chose to grill it instead of using cast iron.  I ate 1/2 of a chicken breast, which is about double what I normally eat when it comes to chicken.  This will be a staple chicken rub in our world. THANKS, Karena!

Okay the chicken was edible but I have to say I was thoroughly disappointed with the flavor. It tasted way too much like cumin to me, despite the fact that I measured out each ingredient. I was craving a blackened chicken that would be similar to the kind you get at restaurants but this absolutely did not deliver. So much for my high hopes. I will not be making this again.

I did not love this recipe. I followed it exactly and I still found it rather bland. Everyone likes and dislikes different things and this is a dish I simply won't be making again. I did however love the amount of calories.

recipe was good after doubling everything (like suggested by another reviewer) except the thyme which i quartered.. didnt have onion powder so used garlic powder instead.. cut the chicken up into chunks.. threw the spices in a baggy and shook the chicken around.. could've been just a tad more peppery-er.. but i still enjoyed it..

The only thing I changed was to use half the amount of cayenne pepper (using 4 servings), but kept the rest the same. I love how juicy and flavorful this chicken is. Even my husband, who groans every time I say we are having chicken, said it was really good.

I made this tonight and it was delicious! I increased the seasoning mix to fully coat my chicken breasts, used organic boneless/skinless chicken breasts & used the highest potency cayenne pepper powder (90.000 HU) and served with sweet peas.  Absolutely tasty!

This recipe was awesome! Not only did it take 10-15 minutes which is great when you have a baby, but it was tasty! I don't particularly enjoy meat that much but my boyfriend only eats meat so we have to meet halfway. I love spicy food and the chicken was juicy! I didn't change anything in the recipe and it worked well!

How easy! This recipe was easy to follow and delicious. I've never thought to spray the breast itself with cooking oil. That technique works like a charm. The breasts cooked up great and were gobbled up fast.

Followed most of 'NYPD K9 COP's suggestions, but followed the ingredients list to a T.  Baked this (in the cast iron skillet) for 20 minutes even though we started with room temperature chicken and it was perfect.  It was spicy, but slicing it thinly and serving over pasta tempered the spice.  Served it with Cajun Pasta Fresca on this site and it was fantastic together.  So easy!

So so so delicious, easy, and quick!  My favorite restaurant makes a blackened chicken breast with melted bleu cheese and this tastes so close.  Now I can have it any time I want for a fraction of the price!
I beat the chicken breast flat then pan fry it and it cooks in a matter of minutes.  But makes sure to turn on a fan or you'll feel like your house has been maced!

I cooked mine on the grill and we really enjoyed it. It is a great basic recipe. Next time I will add a little more cayenne and cumin for extra kick.

This is the perfect blend of spices! I have tried this on baked chicken drumsticks, baked chicken, grilled chicken, pan seared chicken and tilapia (not great on the tilapia).  My favorite is on grilled chicken!  I adjust the amount of cayenne based on the thickness of the meat. I also add a 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder.

I tried this recipe for my first attempt at cooking blackened chicken. The chicken turned out good and I enjoyed it cubed over a salad. I do agree that it's not necessary to transfer the chicken from the pan to a baking sheet; I too put the pan directly in the oven! However, I will play around with the seasonings next time to create a bolder flavor. All in all, this was definitely a good beginning recipe.

This was really good.  I just left the chicken cook in the frying pan with olive oil, and used chicken tenderloins (because they're smaller and cook faster) and it turned out just fine.  It cooked through in about 10 minutes.  The listed measurements didn't quite make the chicken spicy enough, so I'll probably use a lot more next time, but it was really, really good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good and very spicy.  It did smoke up my apartment something severely, but it was well worth it.  I stuck to the recipe (although I did put the pan in the stove instead of transfering to a cookie sheet).  I also added garlic powder.  Delicious.  I think I will play around with the seasoning to make it "party friendly".  Everyone doesn't like TOO spicy.  I also put on my salad which was PERFECT!!!  Thank you for this recipe.

This is one of the easiest, tastiest blackened chicken recipes I have ever found.  I think pan searing it is the way to go but you can grill it with nearly the same results.

Lovely! So simple! I did not use the oven at all but just cooked in the cast iron skillet. Also, I did not have cayenne pepper and substituted half as much red pepper. This will be a go to recipe! Thanks Karena!

I'm still not sure about this. We did reduce the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp because we didn't want the chicken over powered. If we make again we'll use the ingredients, but cook on the grill because it smoked up the kitchen so bad. (stinky).

Great recipe!  I actually made a few changes -- do not like spicy so I did not use cayenne and since I did not have white pepper, I used black pepper.  I also did not use onion powder (since I also did not have) but used garlic salt instead.  I actually melted 1 tablespoon of butter and added 1 tsp. of extra virgin olive oil into a medium skillet on high heat and added my chicken breasts and cooked until there were no longer pink juices running through.  Very tasty!  thank you....

Was alright. Omitted thyme and added garlic powder and a bit of coriander. Cut back on the cayenne pepper cuz my boyfriend doesn't like spicy stuff. I followed the first guy's advice and seared it the whole time (instead of shoving it in the oven), but the chicken breasts came out too black and the center of the chicken took a lot more time to cook through. Next time I'll follow the original instructions; how did he get "most useful" spot?!

Quite good, even with really thick breasts.  I added sage and garlic powder and a little more salt, also a little less pepper!  Be prepared for lots of smoke, but well worth it.

I didnt have a cast iron skillet and wanted to use the oven only so i followed the Becky's review( Dec 05) and also used bone in, skin on breasts because it was the only thing we had in the freezer, although i did take as much skin off as possible. I rinsed the breasts, dipped in melted butter, then in the spice mix (which i pretty much x4 to make enough for 3 huge breasts) also added black pepper and garlic powder. Then place in a baking dish sprayed with Pam containing olive oil, covered and baked for 20 mins. Then flipped, drizzled EVOO over the breasts and placed uncovered back in the oven for another 20 as the review stated but i ended up adding another 10 mins as the breasts were almost still frozen when I seasoned, for a total of 50 mins cooking time. I rated 4 stars because the taste was a little more spicy for our tastes in this house but overall good easy recipe for chicken on a day when your out of ideas. I served with green bean casserole, mac& cheese and garlic bread! Yum

Way too spicey. Too much red pepper for only two breasts. And definitely not enough cooking time, so while I was prepping for 10 minutes in the oven and had all the other food ready to go, it actually took about 22 minutes, and the rest of my food got cold. Please be accurate in listing the time for busy moms who have hungry babies waiting for their dinner. :)  (Not that they ate it anyway...way too spicey for the little ones.)

At 1 minute per side the chicken didn't get blackened  enough.  Maybe 1.5 per side.  Also, double the seasoning amount if you want the chicken covered.

Delicious!  I triple the recipe for 2 chicken breasts and add chilli pepper flakes for my fiance who loves spices!  I also add 2-3 table spoons of bread crumbs.

amazing :)  my husband has already asked for it again.  first time I made it I put it over angel hair with a pomodoro type of sauce.  next time I'm going to try it over a salad with some ranch.  it is kind of spicy if you don't like your food with a kick!

Fabulous recipe! I did what others suggested and baked the chicken longer, about 15 minutes. I also blackened the chicken with a tablespoon of olive oil. The end result was easy and very tasty, and the cold leftovers are also good. Easy for a poor college kid!!

I cooked this for my daughter and myself. We thought the cumin was a little too strong. I will probably look for another recipe sans cumin next time.  Excellent directions and easy to follow.

I used 2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts. The recipe serving size for 2 was not enough to fully coat them, so next time I'd up the spice mixture. I reduced the amount of salt by half because I was serving this chicken with a dressing that had salt in it. As far as cooking method, I heated up an empty cast iron pan, then just before I put the chicken in, I poured in a bit of peanut oil. (Peanut oil has a very high smoke point, meaning it can take really high heat before it burns and smokes.) Then I placed my chicken in and seared both sides, then put the entire pan in a 350 degree oven for 17 minutes. Perfect! I waited about 15 minutes to cut into it, to let the meat rest so it would be juicy :) Next time I will probably add some garlic powder to the spice mixture, and a little brown sugar on the top before it goes in the oven. (Searing sugar WILL burn no matter what.) For the record, I did NOT have a problem with smoke :-)

I thought the chicken was very flavorful. I added probably more spice than it called for. I had to cook my chicken in the pan longer than 1 min per side. Maybe I used bigger pieces of chicken.

WOW, this was really spicy, too much for me and I like spicy.  The worst part was the smoke.  Honestly the strong spices blackening on the iron pan just about killed us.  I am still coughing three hours later.

This is very tasty and I will make the recipe again; however, I would probably cut back on the cayenne pepper.  I love spicy, but this was even a little much for me...and of course my 3 year old wouldn't touch it after the first bite. (too hot!)

Soooo delicious!  My boyfriend likes food with flavor and he highly approved of this meal!    CHANGES: I doubled all the spices except the thyme. The chicken was a wee bit too spicy but tasted perfect dipped in bleu cheese!  If you want less spice, just don't double the cayenne.  I also added 1/4t of garlic salt and a couple grinds of black pepper. I omitted the onion salt because I didn't have any and it certainly wasn't lacking flavor.  I put the chicken right on the Foreman without doing anything else to it and it came out PERFECT! I wouldn't cook it any other way! I now make large batches of this spice mix and make the chicken at least once a week. Is delicious in a salad!

I used my cast iron pan and seared for 2 minutes on each side, then put the pan and all into the oven for about 8 minutes more.  No need to switch to a baking sheet.  I had two large chicken breasts, and I cut them each in half and pounded them out so they'd cook more quickly.  I also didn't have each of the spices, but I used what I had of them, plus garlic powder, and it turned out great!  I'm looking forward to the leftovers over pasta tomorrow!

I needed to double the recipe (had 2 large chicken breasts).  I do not own a cast iron skillet..instead used a standard skillet.  The house immediately filled with smoke (even only searing 1 min each side).  Next time I think I will try to blacken the chicken on the grill.  I did need to cook the chicken longer than recommended due to the size of the breasts.  OVERALL:  EXCELLENT.  Served over ceasar salad...chicken was juicy, not too spicy, perfect!

This was very good - the mix of spices made a great rub for the chicken.  I did double the spice mixture so that I could really coat each piece of chicken.  I loved what searing, and then baking did to the chicken - it was moist and flavorful.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is the best blackened chicken recipe on this site, however, it does not rate up the the blackened chicken that my mom used to make.  I'm trying to find the recipe that my mom used because I can't figure out what isn't right in this one.  It's worth trying and I did like it enough to even make it again, but it's not the best.

I loved this recipe!! The spices mixed well together for a wonderful taste! Beware though, people who do not have a high tolerance for spice would not enjoy this recipe.. But for those who do will probably really enjoy this recipe.  With the left overs, I chopped this up and put it in a salad.... I definatly would recommend this recipe to anyone who is reading this!!

I quadrupled the spice and dredged the chicken in the spice for a dry rub.  My husband loved it, but it was too spicey for me.  I would scale back the cayenne pepper for my portion next time.  I also doubled the cook time for both the stove and oven.

I always look for really quick chicken recipes, and I don't know why I've never come across this one before.  This is the easiest chicken I've ever made that actually has flavor.  I made this on a night that I went out to dinner with a friend, so that my husband would have something to eat.  He is from India and loves food covered with spices, so I thought this would be right up his alley.  It made the house smell so good and I was sorry that I wasn't going to eat it!  I did taste it though, and it was wonderful.  My husband is so picky since I'm American and he really really misses his mom's Indian cooking....which I don't cook much because it's time consuming and we are very busy.  So it was exciting to find something that he really likes.  Thanks for the great and simple recipe!  Oh also, I don't have an iron skillet so I just heated up my t-fal pan really hot and it worked fine.  I had to bake it for 25 minutes though to get it done in the middle, and it was soooo juicy!  I doubled the cayenne pepper too since my husband thinks food tastes better the hotter it is :).

I follow the suggestions of others and it was excellent.  I tripled the spices and skipped the frying pan and just placed it in the oven for 20 minutes.  It was spicy and the chicken was very tender.

I didn't fry it. Just baked. So that may be why it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.

This was an ok recipe. It was a little bland for my taste, but it didn't taste bad. As my husband said, it was just "good," and nothing fabulous.

Very good!  I like the idea that one reviewer had of changing the serving size to 30 & keeping the mix in an empty jar.  I'm definitely going to do that.  I found a blackened salmon recipe on this site that had very similar ingredients.  I'm looking forward to trying this recipe on my salmon.  This is a keeper for sure.

After I got done catching the neighborhood on fire (smile) this was really good!  I let the chicken set for 5 minutes before slicing and popped one piece in my mouth and was terrified it was going to be way too spicy but it really wasn't!  I'm not sure what I did wrong with my cast iron skillet, besides the fact that it was new.  It created so much smoke in the house we had to open all the windows and doors and we all started choking (I quit smoking 2+ years ago and now I remember why...lol)  But you know what, even after all that it was worth it.  Served with some egg noodles boiled in garlic & buttered and some fresh green beans.  Yum!

The seasoning could have used a bit more punch, but otherwise pretty good. Used turkey instead of chicken.  Oven time was about 10-15 minutes.  Drizzled with fresh lemon juice to help keep them from drying out in the oven.

Great recipe! One modification I made was to do the entire cooking process on the George Foreman grill. Just put it on and close the lid for 6 minutes and it comes out very moist.

This was really good.  The blend and amount of spices work really well.  After reading other reviews, I left it in the oven for longer than 5 minutes -- somewhere between 10 and 15.  The chicken was still moist.

This is a great recipe.  It's easy and quick to prepare, and has a wonderful flavor.  I agree that the oven element is not at all necessary; I used a cast iron skillet for about five minutes on each side and the chicken was practically falling apart when I was done.  Also, I made a portion of the chicken completely kid-friendly by removing the paprika and cayenne and replacing it with a bit of chili powder.  Some garlic powder in the mix is a good thing as well.  This is a recipe that we'll be going back to often.

We love this recipe! The spice mixture has real heat and is good on chicken and shrimp. My husband and I put either on salads with a cool lemon / honey dressing. It makes a delicious meal. Our modifications include using chicken cutlets instead of full breasts and sauteeing them in olive oil until cooked through. We love flavor, so we often make extra spice to turn up the heat. Enjoy!

I followed the suggestions of the reviewer who said she didn't use the oven. I didn't bother getting them out of the fridge ahead of time, just cooked 7 minutes on each side and let sit 10 minutes before eating. We dipped it in ranch dressing and ate with buttered corn. Great!

My family truly enjoyed this recipe.  My super picky daughter loved it and requested it for her birthday.  I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces and cooked on the stove top over medium high heat.  We'll be making it again soon I am sure!

Been using this recipe for the past 5 years and it never fails. It's quick and easy for a weeknight meal. I've served this along with fetuccini and it's balances out the creaminess.

I thought it was just a little peppery. I wold probably use a little less Cayenne next time. Also, I added garlic powder but will use garlic salt next time. definitly a good base to modify to your own liking. Would cook again.

Wow that was good. Double on the spices though if you want to coat more than two breasts or cutlets. I grilled it and served with caramelized onions and garlic, along with a grilled baked potato coated with olive oil and basil. Very good meal!

Thank you for this great recipe.
I used black pepper instead of white and just sprayed my cast iron pan with cooking spray instead of using oil to save on fat.It came out delicious!!! Perfect amount of flavor. I put it on salad but it would also make a great sandwich with avacado tomato and lettuce. I think I'll try it like that next.
I also made a bigger batch and put it in a old spice jar so I don't have to make it every time.

This was the first time I ever tried blackening anything.  Was really easy and very good. Just make sure that you double the ingredients if you are planning to have more that 2-3 chicken breasts.  I also added the garlic powder.  My Husband really enjoyed, and will definately have again!

Absolutely wonderful. All my boys and hubby loved it.  I made enough for 8 servings and it was all gone.  I cooked it completely on the skillet and it was still juicy. Not dry at all.

My husband said it tasted like I sprinkled taco seasoning on the chicken and baked it - not the blackened chicken taste I had hoped for. On the plus side, it was very moist.

Tasted like regular chicken to me..nothing special about it.  I probably did it wrong because it looked nothing like the picture and hundreds of reviewers loved it.  Won't make again until I figure out what went wrong.

I can't beleive someone complained about the chicken being too moist!!! It was easy, and I did not mind the two pans. My family thought it was spicy enough, nice and moist, and quick to prepare. I will be making it again!

This was pretty good.  I cut up chicken breasts to nugget-size pieces, rolled in the spice mixture... heated pan, added pam spray and then cooked.  No smoke.  After it "blackened" (more of a reddish color, not quite the blackened consistency i was looking for), i tossed in the oven at 300 while I made some fettucine alfredo.  It was delicious, juicy and moist.. not quite the blackened chicken i was expecting, but delicious none the less.

Fantastic! Don't be fooled by other reviews that claim this is too spicy. It is a very balanced blend of spices you will truly enjoy. My wife is not a fan of spicy food. She loved this chicken. One caution though...make sure you have a great ventilation fan over the stove when heating the oil in the skillet. It can get smoky.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Although, that amount of spices for 2 chicken breast is quite a lot. Next time I will cut the spices in half.

This turned out pretty good. I didn't have any thyme on hand so I used crushed basil leaves instead. I had to make the spice mix twice because there wasn't enough the first time. Next time I will make a big batch of the spice mixture upfront. Overall it was worth making it. Thanks.

Yummy!  My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  Leftovers would be great on top of a salad. I blackened the chicken first for 1 minute on each side, but I baked it in the oven for 30 minutes; not 15-20 minutes. I'm going to do what one of the other reviewers did and make up enough for a batch of 30, since it doesn't go bad or need refrigeration. Thanks!

Delicious! I used chicken tenders, however, instead of the breast halves. I have a hard time finding breast halves and boneless skinless chicken breasts are little large for every night. I will definitely make this again!!!!

This was FANTASTIC! I doubled the spices and rubbed it on both sides, added a bit of chipolte chili powder. I had no problem with the kitchen getting smokey. I also baked mine for longer than the recipe called for. It was tender and juicy on the inside and crispy and deliciously flavored on the outside. My husband raved on and on about this. Thank you for the recipe!

This is the perfect way to use those chicken breasts that I buy and never actually figure out what to do with.  I usually side them with steamed veggies for a healthy alternative.

My stubbornly picky 7 year old loved this chicken! I cut out half the cayenne pepper and the flavor was still amazing. Very easy to do.

Very good recipe.  I usually double the ingredients and coat both side of the chicken to give it an extra flavor boost.

Good flavor...Defninately only coat one side of the chicken unless you want the spices to overpower the taste of the chicken.  I accidentally coated one of the pieces on both sides and it was a bit much, but all the others were good.

YUMMY!!!  WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING EXCEPT WHERE TO COOK IT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND COOKING THIS OUTDOORS ON A GRILL IN A CAST IRON SKILLET IF AT ALL POSSIBLE, EVEN IN THE WINTER. I COUGHED FOR 15 MINUTES AFTER COOKING IT IN THE HOUSE.  AND THAT WAS WITH THE STOVE VENT ON.  OH WELL, IT WAS WORTH IT!  LOVED IT!

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME.  WE LOVED IT.  I DID MAKE IT MY OWN THOUGH.  I EXCLUDED WHITE PEPPER, ADDED 1/4 TSP MORE SALT, ONLY PUT THREE DASHES OF CAYENNE, AND 1/4 TSP OF GARLIC PEPPER.  MY HUSBAND DOSEN'T LIKE NEW FOODS AND ITS ALL HES BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

I used turkey breasts instead of chicken, took about 30 minutes in the oven to get fully cooked. If you just have some poultry and spices, this is an excellent recipe.

delicious and very easy to make.  I used commercial cajun seasoning and cooked the chicken breasts 25 minutes rather than 5 to 10.

I originally rated this recipe 3 stars but tried it again tonight and it turned out wonderful, my boyfriend loved it. The changes I made were I doubled the seasoning which is highly recommended.  I also followed other reviews and seared them for 5-7 mins per side to cook fully rather than messing up dishes to sear and bake. still turned out wonderful and juicy.  This recipe would probably be great over alfredo pasta.

Delicious! Well worth all the smoke. I thought it was pretty spicy, but I chopped it up and put it over a salad and it really balanced it out well.

I am a new cook, and this recipe is amazing. Everyone I have ever made this recipe for has loved it. It is so simple. For one less step I omit the step where you cook it on the stove on both sides. I also coat both sides with seasoning just double the measurements. Loe this recipe!

I didn't like it much, it was spicy, it was blackened, not moist, not flavorful.... I will try it again to see if I did something wrong.

Quick and fabulous. I tweaked the spices to my own personal tastes, like nixing the paprika and thyme and adding dried dill and garlic powder, but other than that I followed as-is and was rewarded with moist, flavorful chicken. I served this with the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce from Dawn Carter over penne - a restaurant-quality meal. Thanks so much for sharing!

I love spicy food and I found this recipe to be fantastic!! I made it almost exact except I estimated my measurements! It was so moist and juicy and I've made it atleast once a week the past month. It was a big hit to my friends who also asked me for the recipe to make themselves! Thanks! :)

This stays moist but doesn't have too much amazing flavor.  A great diet food though.  I liked it, but I think my boyfriend would want more sauce or flavor.

Great blend of spices!!  I used the recipe to make a blackened chicken fettucine alfredo w/ baby artichokes -- perfect blend of spiciness with creaminess.  Will definitely be using this recipe over and over again!

Very good recipe.  I eased up a bit on the cumin and put a little more paprika in.  The second time I made it I added lemon juice and it came out very well.

Thanks for the Great Recipe!  Easy and flavorfull... will definately make again.  Didn't have chicken breast on hand.  I used chicken thighs instead.  Cooked 5 minutes on unseasoned side and baked for 30 minutes but still turned out great.

When I added the chicken to the sizzling cast iron pan, it created a spicy, peppery smoke.  My family's first thought was that I had burned their dinner.  However, one taste had them raving about the delicious flavor.  Even my 11-yr-old daughter was fighting for second helpings.  Better make extras!  I served this with roasted garlic and lemon potatoes.

pretty good.  i did not pound chicken because i had thin cutlets but i definitely would recommend pounding if you have thicker peices.  i like spice so i made up some extra spice mixture to rub on the chicken.  i finished this with bacon and colby jack cheese and ate it on a martin's potato bun.  my husband really loved it.

THis was a great recipe.  Everyone loved it.  My son, the pickiest eater, asked for seconds.  Several people warned about not letting the skillet get too hot, but at the same time make sure your skillet is hot enough or you wont get it blackened.  Very moist and it has to be great for the  calorie conscience person!

I liked this, but didn't LOVE this.  It really didn't have a great flavor, besides "hot" Maybe I didn't cook long enough in the frying pan, because I had to cook in the oven for about 25 min. to get rid of the raw pink center.  I also wish I had flattened it a bit before cooking.

Wonderful!!  I followed the recipe exactly except for making the chicken thinner and heating the oil for only 5 mins. (as suggested by other reviews)  I am not a fan of hot stuff but my husband prefers to have his taste buds burnt off.  This was a perfect compromise.  Tastes great on top of many kinds of pasta dishes.

Yummy! My friend and our children loved this. My friend was busy fanning the smoke detector, lol, so I could only let the oil heat up for about 7 minutes. It blackened a bit but the taste was delicious. I also flattened the breasts a bit as suggested by others and would make them even thinner next time so they don't take so long in the oven. Thanks for sharing!

WOW, I can't believe my smoke detecter didn't go off!!  This was very tasty, which surprised me since it was so easy! I ran out of paprika, so didn't use but added garlic and chili powder.  I pounded the chicken breast a little thinner and had it in the oven for about 12 minutes.  Served with sweet potato.

this is stinkin' spicy-- especially for the older folks I served it to.  But good, anyhow.  Watch closely to not overbake...  I also used a teflon pan--- didn't exactly "blacken" like it might have, but it was dark.  thanks for an easy recipe.

I thought this was great, but my husband thought it was so-so (he doesn't like spicy food at all though).  Open up all the windows in your house becuase it will get smokey!!  I served this with roasted red potatoes and green beans.

Excellent recipe. I added Creole spice, garlic powder and a tad more cayenne pepper. Was a little too warm for us but was delicious and juicy.  Heated oil in iron skillet for 5 min. and baked for 25 min.  Will definately try again, but with less cayenne pepper.

This was good but not great.  I will definitely make this again though and tweak it a little bit more to my liking.  I used chicken breast tenderloins and did not need to bake them.

Both my husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I added a little cajun seasoning and also seasoned both sides of the chicken, lots of flavor.
