Wow, this really does taste like pizza! I used Italian breadcrumbs and tomato sauce which has roasted garlic in it - cause it's all I had on hand and left out all the optional ingredients. I made chicken nuggets and breadsticks to dip into this. It was awesome! Thanks for the recipe.

We weren't real wild about this.  I took it to a football party.  I was very excited about it but it was watery and didn't have a lot of flavor.
