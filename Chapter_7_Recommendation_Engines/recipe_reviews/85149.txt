Very good and impressive for not much work. I found phyllo hard to work with at first, but once you get the hang of it it's a breeze. However, 10 layers is a bit much, there's too much flaky and not enough filling that way. I recommend doing 4.

I made these for a Thanksgiving appetizer. The taste was wonderful. I don't think 10 sheets is necessary. I found that a little much. I would also recommend you go heavy on the butter after you roll them. They dried out a little after cooling and the top layer flaked off. A little time consuming but a nice result.

Rave reviews from everyone who ate these.  I agree with the other reviewers regarding the number of layers of filo dough....less is more.  I used 5 and that seems perfect.

I tried this recipe the other day.  I took some liberties. I don't use my oven much in the summer as I don't have air conditioning in my kitchen.  So, I used wonton wrappers instead of phyllo, and made little triangular pastries.  I fried them in a skillet.  They were delicious!  I can't wait for the weather to cool off so I can try the recipe as it is written.

Made this for a seminar at my husband's office. Doubled the recipe and served in a large chafing dish. It was delicious and very easy. I followed the recipe exactly. The few leftovers were taken home by staff. This is a keeper and I will make this again.

These are good! Was looking for something similar to what I had eaten in Greece, and these were close enough. We always make half a recipe, with a full bunch of green onions, 4oz. of feta, and two eggs, but still divide them into four rolls, because they seem to cook better that way. We just eat them as a meal, my boyfriend loves them.

Five stars for flavor, one star knocked down for how fussy these are to make.  I think I was overly generous on the breadcrumbs & butter as I needed more than the recipe called for, and I was only using 5 sheets of phyllo as others have recommended.  I prepped them on a sheet of foil & used that to help roll it up; waxed paper would probably have been a better choice although the foil worked well enough.  Also, a fresh sheet for each roll-up would be good, as the foil got rather buttery & the outer sheet of phyllo stuck like a suction cup on the second roll-up.  I will probably make these again although it's not going to be an everyday recipe for me.

Wow, what a lot of fussy work. In fact, they were a pain to make.  The outcome was awesome though...5 stars for taste and texture. Next time however, it's off to Costco for me.

Much better than I ever expected it to be.  I'm not a huge spinach fan but I loved the flavor of the dill, feta, and spinach together.  To cut the calories I substituted butter flavored cooking spray for the butter.

Didn't need so much oil to saute the onions, 1/4 cup probably would have been fine. They turned out good though!

I made these on the weekend, and was not impressed.  I only did 5 layers, so only had to used 1 box of philo pastry (20 sheets per box).  I found them tasteless and too flaky and dry (maybe dipping in sour cream would have helped), and I had a lot left over, since my guests did not really like them either.   The amount of oil to saute the onions is ridiculous, they were swimming in oil.  If you decide to make this recipe, you only need a couple of tablespoons of oil. I can't even imagine doing 10 layers of philo, there would have been even less taste!  I would NOT make these again.

This was wonderful!  I also doubled the filling,and cheated on brushing each layer of phyllo with butter by spraying every other layer with canola oil.  I made a ten-serving size to serve with gyros for three people and there wasn't a crumb left over!

I wish I had re-read the reviews before making.  "Tasteless and too flaky and dry" says it all.  Also, maybe I didn't score properly before baking but I found it very hard to separate the servings afterwards, and just not worth the effort, when the traditional forms of this dish that I've seen are so much simpler (flat and cut into squares or folded up in triangles).

These just didn't work well for me. I may try again cause I don't know that it was the recipe. I just found the phyllo pastry hard to work with.

Do not use 10 sheets of dough. 5 is enough.

Very tasty.  I made into individual triangles and served at my daughter's bridal shower.  They were a BIG hit!!!
