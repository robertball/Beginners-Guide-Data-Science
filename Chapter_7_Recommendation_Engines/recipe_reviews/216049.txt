As written the recipe needs a little work but with some minor changes it is easily improved to 4-star status.  First, don't assume 12 minutes in the microwave is accurate for your spaghetti squash!  The recipe doesn't specify the size but given the 6-serving yield and fairly large amounts of the other ingredients, I'm assuming the submitter meant "1 LARGE spaghetti squash." If you use anything smaller, microwaving this for 12 minutes will be far too long and you will not obtain the desirable long strands. For ease in preparation and out of curiosity, this was the first time I cooked spaghetti squash in the microwave and I learned just how quickly it can overcook!  I used sweet red bell pepper, rather than green, and with "primavera" in its title I didn't find feta cheese the best choice - I used fresh Parmigiano-Reggiano. Also in keeping with "primavera," and since I had them available, I used fresh herbs for the dried seasoning.  Finally, it is not necessary to cook the onions separately, before adding the zucchini and peppers. I cooked all three together, but did not OVERcook, then added the garlic, the tomatoes and finally the fresh herbs. Again, if you use a modest-sized spaghetti squash, DO adjust not only the cooking time, but the amounts of the other ingredients, accordingly. (I didn't use nearly close to 1-1/2 cups of chopped tomato, for example)

Quick, easy and healthy! I took some liberties with the recipe based on what I had at hand. I used sliced grape tomatoes, a couple of handfuls of raw spinach, sliced mushrooms, and some marinated artichoke hearts. Also used grated Parmesan instead of the feta. Loved the results!

I've made this twice.  The first time, I cooked the spaghetti squash in the oven (see Spaghetti Squash I on this site) because I already had the oven on for something else.  This time I followed these directions using an average size squash and it was WAY overcooked after only 10 minutes in the microwave.  It was no longer stringy like spaghetti and was very mushy.  I didn't have any green pepper, so I substituted baby bella mushrooms and that worked so well that I'll use them every time.  I also added a bit more seasoning and used only half an onion because we feel like too much onion overpowers the other ingredients.  The flavor of this dish was really good even though the dish lacked eye appeal and lost some texture due to the overcooked spaghetti squash.  Next time, I think I'll cook it for only 8 minutes or in the oven if I have time.  BTW, you can use canned tomatoes (no added sugar! yuk!) and it's as good as fresh winter tomatoes from the grocery and very economical.  (Don't compare with fresh summer tomatoes from the garden or farmer's market, of course.)  Overall, good dish. Just adjust the cooking time in the microwave.

AWESOME recipe!!  I sauteed the onion and garlic in EVOO then set aside.  Put chicken in the pan and seared in a little EVOO and deglazed the pan with some sherry and set that aside.  Then added zucchini and mushrooms and sauteed for a few minutes on high heat added 1/4 cup h2o covered and simmered 2 min.  Uncovered and put all ingredients in pan and added two cans diced tomatoes and chicken broth.  Cooked down and served with parmesean cheese.  AMAZING!!!  Also cooked the squash in the oven.  Cut it in half, seeded it, placed on a cookie sheet face down.  Placed in half inch of water and baked at 375 for an hour.  Was done al dente and perfect!!  Also saved the seeds and roasted like pumpkin seeds, a little bonus with the meal mmmm!

Great recipe. Cooked sqash in the oven instead, and added a little fresh basil and crushed red pepper at the end, and it was super. Very versatile also, would be great with some grilled chx breast tossed in

This is a super tasty, healthy, and quick dinner. It would have gone even faster if my squash had not been stubborn (probably took close to 20 mins total to microwave). For the tomatoes, I had one to dice and then I added about 1/2 cup of leftover pasta sauce to clean out the fridge. I also added a few mushrooms. Yum!

This is delicious! I have always just made spaghetti squash with marinara (boring!) so this was a nice change for me. I didn't have bell peppers or feta (which I imagine would be yummy and I'll use it next time) so I used marinated artichoke (as suggested by another user) and fresh Parmesan. My daughter and I LOVED it.

I roasted my squash in the oven and it came out nicely!  I added some kale, green bell peppers, broccoli, and tomatoes.  I also used parmesan because I was totally out of feta cheese.  This was great for dinner AND the leftovers reheated nicely (while my co-workers curiously asked me what I was eating that smelled so good - ha!) This was a great way to use the veggies in my weekly CSA basket!  THANKS!

This was amazing! My wife and I loved it so much we decided to grow spaghetti squash in our garden next year so we can cook this all the time. It was very easy to make and tastes/smells delicious.

This recipe would have been perfect if the instructions on microwaving the squash had not been so inaccurate. I had no experience w/ squash, I realized when in my final stages of the recipe my meal turned to mush that the cooking time was entirely too long for my size squash; which was on the smaller side. In the future I will take the extra time to oven bake it. As for the ingredients measurements and seasonings...yum! I will try it again w/ my own modifications.

Well, I'll be honest, it's definitely not like pasta -- but I didn't expect it to be.  I tried this recipe for the health benefits of having a low-carb dinner.  And with that being my expectation it was pretty good.  I found that the feta was really the only thing that had flavor and I enjoyed it -- though I'm not sure how I'd change it to give it a more robust flavor.

Super, basic recipe, but if you're a tweaker here's what I did:
~ cook the squash whole in a pressure cooker 14 mins for small, 18-19 for large.  When a knife easily pierces the flesh, it's done.
~ use whatever veg you have on hand, but think crisp tender as the end result
~ add a splash of dry white wine as you saute, maybe a knob of butter
~ toss the strands in at the end
~ use fresh herbs if at all possible, basil and Italian parsley are wonderful
~ finish with parm grated through the pencil eraser sized holes - I like it chunky

Excellent recipe except for the cooking time in the microwave. I used a pretty large squash and 12 minutes turned it to mush. I substituted summer squash for the zucchini and yellow bell pepper for the green pepper because that's what I had on hand. I also added some julienned carrots and an extra clove of garlic. I didn't have any Italian seasoning so I seasoned it with a little chili powder, ground mixed peppercorns, and sea salt. I also added a smidgen of Parmesan along with the feta. Delicious!

This recipe is good, but I suggest baking the squash in the oven. My one and only complaint is the squash was really mushy and I ended up losing almost half of the squash when I scraped the seeds out. As for the rest of the recipe, it was very good and open to personalization. You could add any vegetable that you like or that happens to be in season. I added a little chicken broth and that was a nice little touch. I will definitely make this again for my vegetarian friends, only I will bake my squash next time.

Great for the time challenged.  Tasty and healthy makes it a win for everyone.  I think halving the squash and seeding it before cooking would be easier though.  Maybe, I'd have to try it that way too.

This was very good. I added an extra clove of garlic, used only half of a large sweet onion, cooked the spaghetti squash for 10 min in microwave and added 1 1/2 cups of drained canned diced tomatoes. Served as a side dish to hamburger steak. Don't bother peeling the zucchini. Yummy

I did not like the taste so I added jalapeno peppers and cayenne powder along with low sodium so sauce and it turned into stir fry.  I also nixed the tomatoes and added red bell pepper and asparagus.  My kids loved it and had no idea they were eating squash.

Good basic recipe.  Fairly easy to make.  A little bit of prep time required.  Flavor....ehhhh.  But it is still a nice way to use spaghetti squash, in case you need one.

This was really delicious and surprisingly filling.  Everyone loved it. The feta cheese gives it that little bite and really adds to the overall taste. I also put a little Parmesan into it. Really loved it. I also cut the spaghetti squash in half, scraped out the seeds, put EVO , salt and pepper and then put it on low in the crockpot. Very easy, and didn't heat up the house.

I cooked the spaghetti squash in the regular oven at 375 for 40 min instead of using the microwave.  I would not use this method if I didn't have time to wait for it to cook and cool.

The meal was delicious; even the kids ate it.

Super recipe! DBF, a self-proclaimed squash hater, said it was good and asked what it was :) Then he had seconds! My only alteration was to only nuke the squash for 5 minutes. It stays hot for a long time, and finished cooking on its own while I sautéed the rest of the veggies. Super healthy and satisfying, thank you for the recipe.

This turned out greAt! I made a couple of modifications. I roasted the squash in the oven at 400 for 40 minutes. I also added a boneless chicken breast to the vegetable mix. We loved it!

We got a spaghetti squash from our CSA and immediately looked to allrecipes!  This was so good, totally exceeded our expectations.  We cut it in half since it was just the two of us.  The feta really makes it good. We also threw in some chopped kale (from CSA) as we were trying to use up veggies.  We will definitely make this again.  We do not normally like tomatoes but again had some from our CSA and they were also delicious in this dish.

Love Love LOVE this recipe! We enjoyed it so much! I cooked the squash in the oven though cuz I don't like using a microwave. It worked well still. OMG seriously I could rave on about this recipe. I will be eating more squash now!

This was delicious, I will be making it for the second time tonight. I also changed it up a bit. I added mushrooms and also left out the feta cheese and used parmesan instead. Loved all the veggies and felt very satisfied after this healthy meal.

Kind of boring, but has potential. I didn't like the first taste so I added lemon juice & fresh parsley which helped. Next time I will use all fresh herbs, lots more garlic, and maybe a table spoon of butter. My favorite way to eat spaghetti squash it just tossed with minimal butter & an Italian 4 cheese blend so might sub in the same blend for the feta next time.

This was excellent!  From reading the other reviews, it seems quite versatile as well.  I used a rather large spaghetti squash so it took 17 minutes in the microwave, but it came out perfectly.  I substituted red bell pepper for the green, used a whole small onion, one zucchini and 2 cloves of garlic.  I mixed the garlic with the onion and cooked them together on low for about five minutes while I cut up the bell pepper and zucchini.  I then added those to the pan and let that cook while I chopped 3 Roma tomatoes.  Threw those in, added the seasonings plus fresh basil.  Also added red pepper flakes and Tony Chachere's Original Cajun seasoning.  Left out the cheese but added about 1/2 cup of tomato sauce that I had in the fridge.  OMG, it was DELICIOUS!  I couldn't stop eating it.  Hubby and son loved it too.  Great recipe!

My squash cooked perfectly in 12 minutes.  I had no zucchini, so I added some other veggies from my frig, like carrots, and chopped kale. It’s now my favorite recipe for spaghetti squash!

I cooked the onions for about 20 minutes to caramelize them and then continued on to the other ingredients.  I increased the garlic to 4 cloves.  I was missing zucchini and green pepper so I substituted roasted eggplant and mushrooms that had been tossed in olive oil, salt, and garlic powder then roasted for 30 minutes, to the sauce once it was cooked.

Very flavorful! Subbed in red pepper and Romano cheese as a preference. Also, used fire roasted canned tomatoes since it is off season. Baked the squash since others complained that microwaving made it mushy. Pretty easy and light tasting meal. Will make again.

I was looking for a variation on previous servings of spaghetti squash.  Primavera was a great choice. Be careful not to over-roast the squash.  El dente would be best as it will cook more when assembled.

This is definitely a make again recipe. The only change I made was using parmesan-romano cheese as we are NOT feta fans. I love this type of recipe as it is open to creativity in varying veggies and adding  meat. Thank you!

This is a very good base recipe. Of course I always make a recipe my own by changing it a little. I cooked spaghetti squash in oven not microwave. Just easier to me. I didn’t have zucchini so I added bell peppers and garlic. I also added fresh baby spinach, green onions, shrimp, heavy cream and a little shredded cheddar cheese. I also had to add salt to taste. I added some Tony’s cause you can’t be from the south and not put Tony’s in everything you cook!!!:) Turned out amazing!! Will definitely do this again.

Made this without the feta cheese (vegan) and added a few extra veggies(grape tomatoes and spinach)! Very delicious! Baked the spaghetti squash (how I normally like to do). Even my husband who's usually not very fond of spaghetti squash thought this meal was a winner! Thanks for sharing!

I tweaked the recipe a bit by using red yellow orange bell peppers and a can of fire roasted tomatoes in addition to one tomato. Minus the zucchini and switched the feta to grated mozzarella . Great healthy option instead of pasta!

This was very good. I cooked the squash in the oven, slicing it into 1 inch slices and roasting for 45 min -next time I made this I roasted it for only 30 minutes , much better results--at 400 degrees on a baking sheet with parchment paper. I followed the directions, but felt it needed more liquid. Next time I will add a can of diced tomatoes with the liquid and add mushrooms too. Definitely a great a
Veggie meal. Third time I made this: used a can of diced tomatoes, ½ cup of chicken stock (maybe a bit more), added broccoli, mushrooms and a bit of Parmesan cheese.  Use much less of Italian seasoning next time, maybe use just basil and oregano. It's too overpowering. One of my favorite dishes to have on hand.

this was very tasty when all was said and done.. i deviated a bit based on other reviews and what i had on hand.. used half of a small onion, about 4 oz mushrooms, no zucchini, a combo of red and orange baby bell peppers, a good sized handful of baby spinach and three roma tomatoes.. i used Italian Seasoning I (on this site with my modifications) for the italian herb seasoning.. used just a bit of parm and compensated with salt/garlic salt to cut down on calories.. unlike others i didn't mind that my spaghetti squash was a bit overcooked as i've had problems in the past with cooking it in the microwave.. too soft or too crunchy etc.. this is only for me and bf so i wasn't worried about "points for plating" as he likes to say.. ty for the recipe

Very good. Didn't put in the Italian seasonings (forgot) but used salt and pepper plus lots of garlic. A hearty, healthy meal. Next time, cook the spaghetti squash much earlier, so it has time to really cool off.

I followed the advice of others and only cooked the squash 8 minutes in the microwave.  I was planning to cook it in the oven, but I couldn't get a knife in the raw squash to cut it in half.  8 minutes worked fine.  I added broccoli and mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe as is.

I added white wine and mushrooms for more flavor. I think a can of seasoned diced tomatoes would have helped too.

A bit bland as written but a great base recipe! I added some spinach and some balsamic vinegar at the end to give it that extra something which helps. Also, using fresh herbs if you can always makes a world of difference. thanks for sharing!

Mine did not come out as pretty as the picture but it was yummy. It was loved by my visiting aunt and my kids (5 & 7) both liked it and came back for seconds. I had it, reheated, and it was still yummy. I'll make this again.

Great! I baked the squash for 30 minutes at 450 instead of microwaving. I doubled the italian seasoning and I made the Italian Seasoning I recipe. I also used one can of diced tomatoes. Very versatile. I think I'll add some chicken next time to make it a complete meal.

Absolutely delish!  Dinner party for grandchildren & adults. So easy to make & no hot oven on with house full of people (cooked squash in microwave). Used quartered grape tomatoes.

This was a lot of work.  I baked the squash as everyone seems to suggest it's the better way and I have no issue with that but it did take a long time.  Even an hour in the oven wasn't long enough and I still microwaved it for another 2-4 minutes.  Once the squash was scraped out, the rest of of recipe was pretty quick and easy to prepare.  First couple of tastes were ambivalent but it got better the more we ate.  So I'd say we liked this recipe well enough. As a diabetic who has to eliminate pasta from her diet, this was a pretty good substitute but need to set aside quite a bit of time to prepare.

Very tasty! I only needed to cook my medium sized spaghetti squash for about 8 minutes in the microwave. I added a handful of spinach and little salt and garlic pepper at the end. I also omitted the feta since I'm dairy free, but it tasted very good even without it.

Loved this. My first time using spaghetti squash and wasn't too difficult although will try the baking method next time. I used grape tomatoes cut in half and a little fresh parmesan cheese on top when serving (1 of our sons has a dairy allergy). I also cut the onion to 1/2 of a yellow onion. I served it with chicken & potatoes but really didn't need the potatoes. The whole family liked it so it's a winner in our house.

LOVE this and it is very easy to modify. We left out the zucchini and bell peppers and added olives. This was especially good with lemmon chicken. Super yummy and supper easy! Win-Win!

This is awesome.  We wanted to try spaghetti squash.  I found this recipe and tried it last night. I used canned tomatoes, drained.   Excellent!

Added yellow squash because I had one. I used basil and oregano instead of Italian seasoning. We loved it!

I tried this recipe and did a few variations.  Started with some turkey bacon and baked the spaghetti squash adding salt, pepper, & garlic powder.  Man it was amazing!!  My non veggie eating hubbie loved it.

HELP! I liked the flavor of this, but the texture was just not good. The noodles were crunchy and I was hoping they would be tender. I baked the squash for 30 minutes with some water in the pan. Should I have cooked it longer or is this just how spaghetti squash tastes? I had never tried it before.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  The only big change I made was to follow the advice of others and use freshly grated Parmesan rather than feta.  I also add other veggies if I have them on hand.
