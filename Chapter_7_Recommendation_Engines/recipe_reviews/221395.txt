I added a 1/2 tbsp of dried parsley, 1/4 tsp paprika and a 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  Then each serving gets a dollop of sour cream.  This is now a regular in our fall/winter rotation.

Even with some embellishing (adding more garlic, Worcestershire sauce and V-8 rather than water) this fell short for us in both flavor as well as eye appeal. Still, it was an easy one dish meal that came together quickly. I think this could be improved by preparing it with tomato sauce rather than the diced tomatoes and adding some cooked rice.

About a thousand times easier than rolling the dang rolls!  I changed this up quite a bit, though.  I made it using my family recipe although in a big pot, like a goulash.  I did everything here EXCEPT a doubled the meat, added a few cups of cooked white rice (cooked in chicken broth with a big dollop of butter) added dried thyme to taste (1tsp+) and used a liter of tomato juice instead of the canned tomatoes.  I personally like butter melted on top for serving, too.  My son loves this dish so much that I feed it to him for breakfast with an egg on top.

This was delicious and everyone liked it!  I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced and covered it while it simmered (It would have dried out otherwise).  I cooked it for 20-25 minutes, which was perfect.  I used 2 small onions and would not leave them out.  They really add to the dish.  I will make this again!

Very easy to make.  I added rice and rotel since we like a little spice. My husband loved it with cornbread

I love simple recipes, they get me started making something which otherwise I might find too complicated.  I made changes to this and have saved it as my favorite unstuffed (low carb friendly) cabbage recipe.  I sauted onion and garlic and used 2lb hot italian sausage/hamburger mix and browned it before adding to the pot.  I added a cup of tomato sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons of splenda, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  When the concoction was close to done, I turned up the heat and removed the lid on the pot to reduce the moisture but not overboil the leaves.  I'll make it this way forever.  Thank you for giving me a great start.

I just made this plate, and it was great. I changed the recipe a little bit though. I added some turmeric, parsley, basil and tarragon. I also boiled some split peas and added it to the dish.

My husband and I liked it; the kids not so much but that's not because of the recipe. ;)  Based on other comments and recipes, I added more seasonings like marjoram, celery seed, a dash of ground clove, and red wine vinegar, and served it over rice. I also subbed crushed tomatoes instead of diced because of the aforementioned kids.

This recipe was so easy to make in stead of actual stuffed cabbage. Best of all, it was delicious! I eyeball my seasoning and used roughly 1.5-2 tsp. salt. I made the recipe as stated, except when I added the onion and garlic, I added about .5 tsp salt. Then, I added the cabbage and added 1-1.5 tsp salt and another pinch of pepper. Next, I added 28oz petite diced tomatoes. I would recommend draining half of the liquid from the diced tomatoes or let it simmer longer to reduce liquid. On the other hand, my husband thought the liquid was fine. We served it over roasted baby red potatoes. My husband thought adding the roasted potatoes into the pot for a few minutes would have been great. You could also serve this over rice or egg noodles.

I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. I added 2 cups of egg noodles and enough water to cover along with the cabbage, and boiled until noodles were tender. Then I took it off heat, and added large pinches of oregano, savory, and marjoram, and let it sit for a few minutes before serving. Everyone went back for seconds! No leftovers!

I loved the fact how easy this was to make and the amount of veggies was awesome.  One problem though is it was quite bland :(  I will probably not make again.

Good flavor and we really enjoyed it. Changes I made was to almost double the salt and pepper. Use more garlic but we are garlic lovers. Also cook time was way off, I simmered for closer to 20 minutes to get the cabbage as tender as we wanted.

Hubby gave it a 5...had 2 huge servings to prove it!  He said it's the best version of unstuffed cabbage I have ever made.  I did cut the salt to just 2 tsp, added paprika and parsley, as another reviewer suggested.  I only had a 14.4 oz can of diced tomatoes so used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce with it.  Also let it simmer 20 minutes.  Made some long grain white rice separately in my rice cooker (love that thing) and served everything over top of the rice.

Simple Golabki Haiku: "Such a cinch to make. (Needed more time to simmer.) Happy with our meal!" I added the onion and garlic (more than 1 clove) to the meat as it browned, and included some paprika and cayenne pepper (per another review), and the only other thing different was finding that it took longer than the stated 7-10 min. for the cabbage to be tender (at least tender our tastes, but still retaining some crunch.) Great easy entree!

I used 1/2 meatloaf mix and half Jimmy Deans sausage.  I also used a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes with chile's in it.  Finally, like other reviewers, I added 1/4 tsp Paprika, 2 tsp dried Parsley and 1 tsp garlic powder.  Also simmered for closer to 25 minutes.  We enjoyed the different twist (btw - my mom tried to make it with ground turkey - NOT GOOD).

This dish is delicious!  I served it with mashed potatoes and the taste was spot on for  my traditional stuffed cabbage.  I do think that next time I won't crumble the ground beef as much, so there will be chunkier bites of meat.  I doubled the recipe, except for the meat, because I had a very large head of cabbage and it still turned out yummy!!!  Garlic powder, paprika and parsley were added with the salt and pepper.  I also used 4 cloves of garlic.

This was a terrific way to pull together the flavor of stuffed cabbage rolls without the added work.  Using fresh gr beef (from our butcher shop), cabbage & tomatoes made it even better.

I have used basicly the same recipe for years, but mine calls for adding brown sugar and vinegar
