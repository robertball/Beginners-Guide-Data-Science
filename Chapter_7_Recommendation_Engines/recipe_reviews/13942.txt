Like three earlier reviewers, I thought the filling was great but would skip the tomatoes entirely. Incidentally, I had a lot of extra filling -- this would've probably filled eight tomatoes.  (This doesn't matter to me as I'll skip the tomatoes in the future.)  
Filling: Since some reviewers suggested adding nuts, instead of plain couscous I used Near East brand toasted pine nut couscous mix.  For lack of ingredients, I used goat cheese instead of mozzarella.  This turned out fine in small quantities.  Since I'm not that great a cheese fan, I may skip it entirely next time.  I also left out the mint.  I'm glad I didn't leave out the basil -- I felt it added a lot to the recipe. 
Tomatoes: The tomatoes don't acquire the spicing of the couscous and end up dragging down the dish with their blandness.  In addition, they made the couscous soggy -yes, I drained the tomatoes as the recipe suggested-, making the couscous less pleasant to eat.  If, however, you insist on using the tomatoes, I suggest you cut them in half horizontally.  I made the mistake of cutting a small hole in the top, and emptyed the insides and filled the tomato through that hole.  This was bad because as the tomatoes expanded during baking, the skin wrinkled and shrunk, causing some tomatoes to split.  (One of my uploaded pictures shows this.)

Really Good.  Have made it twice.  Second time made a couple of changes.  Used Fresh Mozarella and baked the tomatos with the caps on, it helped keep the moisture in so the couscous did not dry out.  Good main dish alone but I agree with the reviewer that it said it could benefit from something with.

Excellent!  I used pine nut couscous mix, substituted goat cheese for the mozzarella, added roasted red peppers along with the sun dried tomatoes, and skipped the mint.  Also, after reading the comments about the mix being too soggy, I strained the tomato pulp before adding it to the mix.  

I cooked it with the tomato top on, and then removed the top for the last few minutes and put the tomatoes under the broiler.  Overall, the taste was wonderful, no problems with the consistency, and this recipe was quick, easy and delicious.

This recipe had a really good flavor, but the texture was pretty mushy.  I think adding some pine nuts would give it a nice crunch.  Also, I ate it as the main course.  As side dish with something else chewier, it might be better.

Amazingly delicious with some changes:  Sauteed 1\2 yellow onions with 3 garlic cloves and 1\4 cup of fresh parsley.  Salted the pulp before added to cous cous mixture.  Made half the tomatoes with mozarella and parmesan and the other half with feta cheese.

I made this recipe, and even my picky boyfriend liked it.  I'm so glad I stumbled upon it.  I left out the fresh basil and mint, but added in some crushed red pepper flakes and dried italian seasonings.  So yummy!

Overall I thought this came out really good.  I added some kalamata olives to the couscous and omitted the mint.  I stuffed the tomatoes and put them on the grill.  Before grilling them I added more mozzarella to the top so there was nice melted cheese top. It was great.  Next time, I might add some garlic or something.  It felt like something was missing.

Made these for my husband.  He liked them, but thought they needed some "meat".  I might try adding some ham or hamburger next time.  I will make them again

Yum!!!  I used leftover cousocous, which made things even easier.  Incidentally, the couscous was a little dry, which i think worked in my favor, as the tomatoes made it quite moist.  I added a chopped scallion, few teaspoons of minced garlic, good pinch of kosher salt, and ommitted the mint,  I also added shredded park cheese to the mix, with  the mozzarella to top it.  Forgot to add the sun-dried tomatoes, but was still yummy.  I was in a hurry and baked it in a 400 degree oven, covering with foil after the cheese on top had browned.   I will make these again and again!  The BEST thing to do with leftover couscous!  I bet it would be delicious with quinoa too!!!

Sorry but I did care for this recipe at all. I stopped making it after I tried the filling and before wasting the tomatoes. It was bland and too soggy. Will use tomatoes for something else but I wasted the ingredients for the filling.

I do a variation on this: saute garlic and onion in olive oil and white wine.  I add peas to the couscous, with lots of basil and lemon.  I love this, and it's deceptively simple.  :)

These were really really good! It was my first time trying couscous and the tomato made it nice and moist. The couscous mixture itself was a bit salty but once the tomato juices were stirred in it was fine although I might try using low sodium broth next time. Overall: Really Good!!

I made a few changes to this recipe, based on my own taste preferences, and loved it! i left out the mint, i substituted a crumbly cheese (feta, bleu, or gorgonzola) for the mozzerella, and I added a quarter cup of pine nuts. Delicious! The tomato itself had very little flavor, but the stuffing was wonderful. It was pretty simple to make, also. I made it as an appetizer, and it really could have been a meal in itself. I will definitely make them again.

I made this with chicken broth, and left out the mint & sun-dried tomatoes.  I used dried basil (all I had).  The filling was delicous, despite my tomatoes having no flavor.

Great, a must try!  Very easy and quick, it makes for a great side to you dinner.  I did not add cheese since I'm vegan and it does not need any substitution.

Absolutely delicious! The couscous filling turned out quite moist and easy to pack into the tomatoes, but I ended up eating so much of it along the way, there wasn't enough to fill the tomatoes!  :)  I'll be making this often.

I was really looking forward to this dish, but it turned out to be a total disaster for me.  The mint drowned out all other flavors, and this dish needed salt.  I will not be making it again.  Sorry.

The tomatoes broke apart, the couscous was dry and didn't have a whole lot of flavor. Maybe I didn't make them right, but I wasn't a huge fan

I thought it was delicious but, despite how much I love tomatoes, next time I make it I would not put in all the pulp. The dish has enough tomatoe flavor already. To make the flavor balance out more I ate it with some lentil soup. The plain, sweet flavor of the soup contrasted the sour of the tomato. It was delicious.

This was okay but I'd make the orzo and forget stuffing it into a tomato.  I added roasted red peppers, fresh cilantro, parmesan, pine nuts, and garlic powder to the recipe.  The tomato didn't really do anything except provide for a nice presentation.  I roasted it with the top on which gave it visual appeal.

The sundried tomatoes add a nice tanginess to the filling.  I'm a big fan of cheese, so I added more mozzarella to make the filling gooey.

Very easy recipe that looks great on the table. I omitted the mint and the mozzarella. Will probably add the mozzarella or feta next time. Also, if you are in a hurry, use sundried tomato flavored couscous (make it in five minutes) and these will be a snap to make!

I followed the recipe and found it to be delicious. The sun-dried tomatoes gave it a special extra flavor. I had some extra filling left over so I stuffed a red pepper and that tasted great. Next time I may add a little feta cheese and possibly pine nuts!

I really like this dish, I have been making it for many years and have stuffed tomatoes nine ways to tomorrow. I will have to say however that the suggestion of adding pine nuts to the other ingredients is one of my all time favorites, I especially like it with feta and lot's of chopped fresh parsley, tomatoes are really good stuffed with just about any type of grain, it's also good without any cheese and just with a little olive oil over the filling. Use your imagination, you can't go wrong with this healthy, colorful side dish.

I added a pinch of shredded Parmesan on top of each tomato before baking. Yum!

I've started making this dish pretty often. It works with lots of different veggies, mushrooms, onions, cucumbers, squash, bell pepper, celery, kale, etc. I usually put feta instead of mozzarella, it blends into the couscous more easily.  My household is veggie, so I make this as the main dish and as a side try sweet potatoes, a nice salad, or some beans!

This was a fun dish to make.  My tomatoes were a little small, so I had leftover couscous, which was fine with me!  Delicious!  I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes on hand, but I sauteed some chopped mushrooms and also added a handful of chopped walnuts to the mix, with great results.
