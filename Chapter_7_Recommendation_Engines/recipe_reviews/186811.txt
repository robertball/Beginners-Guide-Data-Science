Did not make exactly as directed:  subbed chicken stock for water. Why not add a little more flavour, unless going vegetarian? subbed olive oil for vegetable oil. increased oregano slightly. Let's just say that I eyeballed my measurements :).  Amazing recipe: and I've passed it on to my friends. Tangy, fresh flavour. Kept me coming back for more! This is a keeper. Thank you for submitting this.  ***edited to add: If you use a stock that isn't homemade, don't use the amount of salt noted in the recipe; it will be overly salty.

This dish is so flavorful! And the garlic and lemon compliment each other perfectly without over powering one another.  I did use only olive oil instead of vegetable oil & olive oil but other than that I didn't change a thing.  I stirred every 30 minutes and added a half cup of additional water twice in the first hour. The potatoes browned perfectly.  This one is a keeper, thanks for sharing it.

Very tasty with these modifcations, triple the garlic, double the oregano and black pepper, use chicken stock in place of water and omit salt (as the chicken stock removes the need for it).

These potatoes are awesome! They are better than ones served in a Greek restaurant. The only thing I substituted was extra virgin olive oil for the vegetable oil. I also didn't have any fresh parsley, so I just added a little dried parsley. You have to try this recipe. Thanks for submitting.

I didn't get the chance to do these right as someone threw a 6 week old puppy out in front of our house and I was busy debugging her.  Lost track of when to stir and add water, etc. and they still turned out absolutely fabulous!  Will make again next chance I get!  Anyone want a cute little puppy?

These were very yummy!!  We don't often eat potatoes, and I liked the sound of these as I love lemon!  I scaled the recipe back, using red potatoes and at least double the garlic called for.  I upped my herbs somewhat as well and used all olive oil instead of both olive and vegetable.  I really liked how the recipe used the hot water while they baked, have never done potatoes like that before.  Unfortunately, I was out of fresh parsley, they would have been even better with it.  Served these along with Red Wine Flavoured Beef (also from AR) and a salad. - great!

Thanks for a fabulous recipe.  Made nearly as directed except didn't peel the red potatoes, must have cut smaller chunks of potatoes as mine were done in much less time, tripled the garlic, and used all olive oil.  Everyone had seconds--even my "picky" niece who then took leftover potatoes for lunch the next day.  Believe me there is no more resounding endorsement than that.  The picture looked like it had feta sprinkled on top, but the recipe did not include.  I'll try that next time as I think that would be really good.  I will also use even more garlic next time.  And next time will be both soon and often.

Excellent taste.  I agree with previous reviews: if you're using stock, don't use that much salt.  I also used all olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Turned out great once I made some changes. I only used olive oil and less of it (just enough to cover bottom of pan and little more) and I used 2 cups veggie broth instead of water and no salt. When I stirred part way through, I sprayed the tops with olive oil spray to keep it from drying out - I didn't see a need to add any water since I used more broth. Really a delicious recipe!

Too good!  And, yeah, just olive oil instead of the oil mix.  Might want to try Oregano/thyme mix instead of just thyme.  Honestly, next time I get served those dried up potato chunk ideas at one of our trendoid "Greek" restaurants... I may have a glass of free Ouzo coming!

I made this low fat and it was still DELICIOUS and as good as our local Greek Restaurant.  Since I used 5 lbs of potatoes, I used 3 Tbs of olive oil only. I used 4+c of water, 6 cloves of garlic and kept the seasonings the same as listed. I threw in an onion. Later it is good by adding steamed frozen mixed peppers and/or green beans or any vegetable.

OMG I love these potatoes! I too used all olive oil and I used dried parsley because that's what I had on hand and just eyeballed the amount of dried parsley I used. I only needed to cook my potatoes for 1 hour and they were done. Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.

Very delicious!!! The only thing I will say is be careful with the 475 temperature. Mine cooked a lot faster than an hour and half and I lowered my heat to 400. I also tripled the recipe of the garlic!

These were fabulous! I worried about the length of time and temperature and whether we would end up with burned potatoes, but as long as you keep checking and adding water, it's fine. The lemony, garlicky taste went so well with our Greek marinated chicken kabobs and Greek salad. Thanks!

Loved it!!  Everyone did - - cooked just as directed with one small exception.  I peeled the potatoes and let them soak in lightly salted water in the refrigerator for a couple hours.  Added just a bit more oregano.  The lemon juice quantity was correct.  My pan was a little deeper than 2" so the 3 cups of Chicken Broth was a little too much.  I had to pour some out - next time I'll just use 2.  Served with Greek Salad (from this site), Chicken Souvlaki  skewars, Chef Johns Tzatzki sauce and the House Greek Dressing from this site for the Greek Salad.  Awesome meal!!!

The picture does not do justice to this dish.  Absolutely delicious. My only change was to leave the peel on the potatoes. I think this is just a taste preference though. Take your time and stir every 20 minutes as instructed and you will be rewarded with a delicious side dish.

Unbelievably delicious. The best i've ever made. Used chicken broth, and baked at a lower 400F for 1 1/2 hours. Potatoes were succulent!

I've been looking for a great greek potato recipe for a while, and this is the BEST.  I followed some of the suggestions from other reviews (added chicken stock and just used olive oil)...  These potatoes came out better than any I've ever had at a greek restaurant.

Awesome potatoes.

I sooo love this recipe!! As a greek, I naturally love anything with lemon, lol.  And i love this dish! The spice is just enough and the acidity is just right.  I make these for family dinners because everyone loves them.  I have made this recipe a staple in my recipe box.

My husband is Greek and loves these at food festivals, etc. I tried a couple of versions from his Greek friends and they weren't as good as these. AND....these are also very simple to make. I did as others and only used olive oil as he prefers it. I did NOT find these too "lemony"....but we love lemons so that may be an individual preference. I "Forgot" to put the parsley on at the end and only realized that after we ate the entire dish of potatoes. I halved this for the two of us and we still ate it all. GREAT recipe. I will be making these for him at least a couple times a month.

Cooked this tonight instead of our same old mashed potatoes.  Husband said they were good, but not enough salt.  (Of course, he unloads have the salt shaker on his food.)  Kids absolutely loved them. Will definitly cook again.

Very good and easy recipe and I would make it again.  My potatoes were just a bit on the mushy side but they were still delicious.  I would probably decrease the cooking time a bit next time.    However, they did not burn like some people were concerned about - just keep an eye on them and add water if necessary.

These smelled heavenly while they cooked.  And they're super easy to make.  Unfortunately, they were FAR too lemony for my family.  I'll try these again, but only use half the lemon juice.

Really yummy!  My potatoes browned up considerably and my oven temperature is bang-on, so I turned it down to 350F for the last bit, while still turning and basting frequently.  Otherwise they would have burnt.  Rave reviews from my dinner guests.

These potatoes are definitely a "go to" for our family. We prefer rosemary to the oregano, and I use chicken broth as suggested by another review instead of the water, without adding any additional salt. What a great recipe, thank you!

Delicious! I was short on time so I made sure to cut my potatoes into fairly small chunks to speed up the cooking process. The only change I made was to add chicken broth instead of water. Topped with feta before serving. We loved them, thank you! :)

Only quartered my potatoes and kept the skin. These came out great! Added some broccoli there at the end. Probably the best potato I have ever tasted.

I took the advice to substitute chicken broth for water. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. As the potatoes baked, the fragrance filled the house and made waiting almost unendurable!  Served with beef sausages. DH was very pleased and went for seconds.  He wants this again anytime he can get it.  Thank you for the recipe.

Very tasty. But it was too lemony. I think I'd use half the lemon juice next time. And I used half the olive oil.

Very easy and delicious. I used reduced sodium chicken stock and olive oil because that's what I had. Also only had 1 lemon which gave me about a 1/4 of juice. It was enough to our liking. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe! I did mine in a 9x13 casserole dish so I cut the lemon juice to 1/4 cup and I added 3 lemon slices (cut in half) and a touch more salt. Turned out perfect!

Quick, easy, and tastey. I used russet potatoes but instead of cubing them, i cut each of them in half and then quartered each half.

I think I go against the popular opinion but I wasn't a big fan.  I thought the lemon flavor was over powering and the potatoes were a bit mushy.  I think I would try it again but just toss them with a small amount of olive oil and use about 1/2 a lemon squeezed over the cubed potatoes (no water).  The cooking time would be cut in half too.  I'll give it another try with a few tweaks.

This was fabulous! We were giving a BBQ goat /lamb mixture and I was looking for something to serve with it.  I followed the instructions, but put it in a 13x11 pan.  The potatoes were very flavorful and held their even yummy cold.  Next time, I might  put them under the broiler to crisp them up.

Great recipe! Like some of the previous reviewers, I used only EVO oil and doubled the garlic. I don`t think it needs any kind of stock - these potatoes were wonderful. Thanks for sharing.

These are delicious, but I am giving them a 4 because the recipe as written doesn't have enough lemon.  I added a few tablespoons more and it was really nice with some feta sprinkled over the top. Thanks!

These are wonderful! My dad usually only enjoys plain basic meals, and I enjoy cooking different more exotic meals-But after I made these he keeps asking for them! Im making them again right now! They smell so great!

So good!  I added carrots and celeriac; the celeriac absorbed the lemon a bit too much, but everything else - especially the potatoes - were a dream.  Thanks for sharing!!
