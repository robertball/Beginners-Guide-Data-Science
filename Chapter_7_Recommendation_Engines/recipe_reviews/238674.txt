This was ok, but I don't know that I'd make it again.  It was easy to throw together in the blender, but it was missing some acid for me.  I think some vinegar and/or lemon juice would take this a long way.  I served it over hearty lettuce, grape tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, and feta to 5 other people.  No one raved, but it was certainly serviceable.  THANKS for the recipe!

This was really easy to put together. I used the blender and it came together nicely. Unfortunately we didn't like this dressing. I only put in about 1/2 the salt and seasonings and even at that it was too salty. Sorry I won't make this again.

Nice! I was on a roll putting everything into the blender for this and I added the salt...that was a mistake, b/c the feta is salty enough on it's own that I don't think any additional salt is needed. So, aside from it being salty (my own fault for not paying attention), this was very tasty. This would also be great for a veggie dip! Thanks for sharing. :)

My family loves Greek salad and I was looking for something different to try. I had never had a creamy Greek dressing before but my family really liked this style. I agree with lovestohost though, it is too fatty as written it needs an acid, I added 4 squirts of lemon juice to 1/2 the recipe and it was good for our taste. I used fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder and only a pinch of salt since feta is salty, I also added a sprinkle of Greek seasoning.

We loved this! Added about 3/4 tsp of minced garlic. I used a regular field cucumber from our garden, seeded it and it tasted lovely and fresh  My husband said it was way better than the expensive store bought Greek dressing. Definitely a keeper!

Great dressing!  I made it as is (in a blender) and it was fantastic!  I've made it twice now and even my kids love it!
