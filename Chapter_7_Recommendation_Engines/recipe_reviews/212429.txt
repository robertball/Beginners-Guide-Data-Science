I did follow this recipe exactly the first time I made it. I would not make this recipe again, if it weren't for the significant modifications I have made....which make an outstanding red velvet cupcake, if I do say so myself! In critique of the original recipe, the cake is very dry and bland. The only saving grace is the frosting. However, I have become well known for my modified recipe. 

I've tweaked the cake portion of this recipe, and in my opinion it is now PERFECT. I decreased the flour, increased sugar and vanilla. I also use buttermilk (or milk plus 1 Tablespoon lemon juice or white vinegar) to increase the moisture. These changes make it less dry and more flavorful. You can view my exact modified recipe, along with pictures, here http://www.carrottopmom.com/?p=290

This recipe has singlehandedly and immediately changed my opinion of Red Velvet Cake.  I’ve only tasted it or made it myself on one other occasion, a recipe from this site.  Looking back at that recipe that I rated four stars, in my mind I overrated it. I didn’t find anything memorable about it and wondered why Red Velvet Cake was so popular – it wasn’t much on flavor, frankly.  A friend even suggested that the Duncan Hines Red Velvet cake mix was infinitely better than any scratch Red Velvet Cake she’d ever made – but I’ll bet she never tried this one!  This is moist, fluffy, pleasantly sweet and chocolaty – the other is mediocre by comparison.  Bonus that a very good cream cheese frosting recipe is included.

5 stars WITH MODIFICATIONS. I followed others reviews and made the following modifications. 

2 1/4 cup CAKE FLOUR - 1 cup buttermilk - 2 & 1/2 tsp vanillia - 2 1/4 cup sugar - With these alterations this makes an AWESOME red velvet cupcake. My mom (who is an amazing baker) and aunt told me these were the BESTred velvet cupcakes they had ever eaten & wanted the recipe.

The frosting is the best creamcheese frosting I have ever had! I will now be using this anytime I need a cream cheese frosting. I was asked for this recipe also.

YUM!  this was soo easy to make, especially a recipe from scratch!  I didn't change a thing except I used reduced fat milk instead of full fat.  It was still delicious... the cream cheese frosting was phenomenal!  To make it easier to decorate your cupcakes, scoop the cream cheese frosting in a ziploc bag (fill it up halfway but not all the way) and cut a small hole on the corner of the bag.

This is by far the best redvelvet recipe I have ever come across!! I think its the sour cream that makes it. I made these for a baby shower and everyone asked where I bought them. When I told them that I made them they all wanted the recipe. These have become a family favorite that I will continue making over the years.

I have been searching high and low for the perfect recipe and this is it. The first time I made it I used 1/2c cocoa and the flavor was to chocolately but 1/4c was perfect. Baked it in three 8inch pans, sliced and iced each layer for a more dramatic presentation. Double the frosting to achieve this.

These are the best cupcakes I've ever made! They are extremely rich in flavor and so moist. They taste like they came from a fancy bakery. The recipe is so easy and people will be very impressed and go nuts for them. I wouldn't change a thing!

Made these for a holiday party and they were a hit! Very moist and fancy looking. Followed the recipe exactly (I was worried about the amount of red food coloring, but it was fine). I will definitely make them again.

I'm a bit of a red velvet cake snob and these unfortunately were a miss. Let me preface it by saying they were incredibly moist, soft, and fluffy. Traditionally, red velvet cake is dense (similar to pound cake) so the texture of these were off. The addition of using half or all cake flour should remedy that issue. The flavor was not very accurate. It wasn't bad, but it certainly didn't have a close resemblance to classic red velvet. The lack of apple cider vinegar, or any kind of vinegar, in the recipe is surprising since that's the key component to this particular cake. For those who would like to add it, 1 tbsp is all you will need. Carefully fold it into the batter after the flour has been thoroughly mixed. Perfectly baked in 18 mins. A lot of people said their cupcakes were dry. It's likely due to the long cooking time. Check on them after 15 mins and add time accordingly since all ovens heat differently. I'd only make this again with some modifications or I'd increase the amount of cocoa and turn these into chocolate cupcakes!

As written, this is not a five-star recipe.  I wish I had followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of flour by 1/4 cup, because my cupcakes came out dry.  The flavor is good, however, and the frosting is excellent.  It's just the right consistency and perfect for piping.  (BTW, 16 oz. confectioner's sugar is about 3 3/4 cups.)

I gave it 5 stars because of the way I tweaked the recipe. I use 1 1/4 cups sour cream. I use buttermilk instead of regular milk and use 3/4 cups buttermilk, I add 2 ounces red food coloring. I bake at 325° for 25 to 30 minutes. I rather bake them at a lower temperature so they don't dry out. *Important thing is to not over bake them. With these changes they are delicious! I bake for my Sister's restaurant and her customers said, they have never had a better Red Velvet Cupcake!

I absolutely LOVE these cupcakes, made them for my daughter's birthday party, EVERYONE loved them!  I will be making them for my daughter's preschool this coming Valentine's Day too!  I rated this four stars as recipe stands, but after testing first time (I always test a recipe before I make it for the masses!) then  modifying, modified recipe is a total 5 star recipe...here is what I changed.......
2 1/4 cups flour
2 1/4 cups sugar
and added 1/2 tsp vinegar to the 1/2 cup milk
So, with the slight tweak...this is a perfect 5 star recipe....frosting is perfect as is!  Enjoy!

Wow! These are very, very good! Mind you I'm not a huge fan of Red Velvet cake but this recipe definitely made me a convert.  My niece requested Red Velvet cupcakes with cream cheese icing for a "Twilight themed" birthday party so not wanting to disappoint I had to make these for her.  Not only did they bake up beautifully, but they tasted delicious and were a huge hit at the party whether you were on Team Jacob or Team Edward - LOL!

I absolutely love this recipe!  More often than not I use this recipe to make a double layered 9 inch round cake or double the recipe and make a double layered 9x13 cake.  No need to time it precisely.. Just check it and take it out when it becomes spongy and a toothpick slides out nearly clean.  Also, I don't use this frosting recipe, I use the cream cheese whipped cream frosting recipe from this site.

OHHH! I also layer fresh cut strawberries in the middle of the cake.  This is what truly makes the cake delicious!  After a few hours, the cake absorbs some of the juice from the strawberries.  It makes the cake super moist, and has a slight strawberry flavor to it as well

I am twelve and This is the best cupcake i have ever had! My friend and i make cupcakes a lot and we have both agreed that this cupcake is our lasting favorite!!! The cake is moist and delicious and the cream cheese frosting is to die for!! I dont understand why anyone would give this recipe a less-than-five-star rating. A few reviews said that this was not a good cupcake and it didnt come out right! Maybe we are just better chefs! :)

These are wonderful! I only made two minor adjustments, based on others reviews. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, doubled the vanilla and increased the sugar by 1/2c. The frosting is amazing!I doubled the butter, sour cream and vanilla. I have my mom's old muffin tins (which are small by todays standards) and it made 36 cupcakes. Thanks for a great recipe!

Almost Perfect!  Read reviews from several different recipes.  I added some of those tweaks and just thought I would share!
1) Add more chocolate!  I added about 2-3 Tbl extra
2) Add more red food coloring--I used a total of 1.5 oz of red food coloring.
3) Seperate the eggs--Add the yolks first, whip the whites until they are frothy in a seperate bowl and then fold them into the batter at the last minute

I made two batches and "tweaked" it for the 2nd batch.  HUGE difference!  Batter was lighter, rose higher, moist, so good! :)

And lastly... check out the recipe here for Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting.  OMG!  Not to sweet, not too heavy--Just Right!  The icing recipe included is good, but this one is 100x better! 

Hope this helps... and enjoy!

I used cake fluor, about 2 1/4 cups and add extra 1/4 cups of sugar. I baked the cake about 20 minutes. I normally did not care with red velvet cakes but this recipe makes delicious cakes!

I've made these cupcakes twice now. First time - followed the recipe exactly, measured all dry ingredients using dry measuring cups (and leveled off the measurements of course). This resulted in a nice cupcake. Not too dense, not too fluffy either. 2nd time - I decided to use buttermilk instead of the sour cream (buttermilk substitute: 1 cup whole milk + 1 Tbsp lemon juice, let this mixture sit for 5 min to curdle). This resulted in a MUCH fluffier, delicious cupcake. I think a big key in making fluffy cupcakes is to measure the dry ingredients by weight rather than volume using a digital scale (which are so affordable these days on eBay or Amazon). I think those who baked up dry, dense, cupcakes either over mixed the batter, or packed the dry ingredients while measuring, or both. If I weigh 1 cup of flour from my measuring cup, then weigh a second cup of flour, I always get different readings... 1 cup always weighs more, by 10-15 grams... it doesn't sound like much, but 10 grams of flour more is A LOT when baking... So 2 1/2 cups of flour = 320g, 1/2c cocoa = 64g, 2 cups sugar = 402g. So if you weight dry ingredients for all baking recipes, you guarantee the same results each time you bake something. I also used an ice cream scoop to divide the batter evenly (I use a 1/4 cup scoop which fills each cupcake liner 3/4 of the way up), and the recipe turned out 27 perfectly identical in size cupcakes.

Stellar!  Used 2 1/4 cups flour; 2 1/4 cups sugar; 4 tsp vanilla; and, buttermilk in place of whole milk as changes for the cupcakes and followed the icing faithfully.  Made all up in the evening and covered the cakes with saran and a towel to keep moist (after cooling) and stored icing in the fridge until time to frost cakes just before serving.  Thanks for sharing!

This is certainly a great base to work your mad-baking genius, however if you use this recipe exactly, you'll get a dense almost dry and not-sweet-enough cupcake. At a yield portion of 6 servings to test the batter, I added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar, stayed with the flour but it was cake flour, not that crappy general purpose, my cocoa was replaced with instant chocolate pudding mix (an old baker's trick to make cakes extra moist), and left the rest of the recipe alone. I suggest starting at 6 servings first so you, too, can test the product, and see for yourself what you need to alter for your tastes. Again, this recipe is a great BASE. A true mad scientist baker would question this formula and attempt to implode their kitchen with awesomeness that is creativity.

Delish!  I used the 1/2 cup cocoa powder as stated in the recipe, which ended up very tasty, but resulted in just chocolate cupcakes - not so red velvety.  I like my cakes to be very fluffy, so I added 1.5 teaspoons of baking soda, and I'm glad I did because they were really fluffy and moist!!!  We only have 1% milk in our home, and there was no problem with using that.  Anyway, I will definitely make these again.  Next time I'll use less cocoa powder :)

These are EXCELLENT red velvet cupcakes!  The previous ones I made came no where near as good as these are.  The texture is amazing, and the flavor is yummy as well.  This will now be my go to recipe for Red Velvet!  p.s. make sure you fluff the butter and sugar really good.  I'm a very experienced baker & these are top notch.  Thanks for this amazing recipe!!! :D

Five stars ONLY if it's frosted correctly!  The cupcake is MUCH TOO delicate to be weighed down by a heavy frosting like cream cheese.  Only when frosted w/ a Vanilla Butter Roux frosting is it 5 star quality!!!!!!!!!

My not so red velvet turned out very delicious.  After I started to make these I realized I only had pink food color.  I used that but didn't get that "red" look.  I will definitely  make these again and have some red color!  This cupcake is different from others I have tried.  It has a heavier texture but isn't heavy (weight wise).  I absolutely love it and it is a definite keeper for me.

I was a little unsure about the sour cream in the ingredients list.  Turns out I had every reason to be concerned.  The finished cupcakes were very bland and had a strong sour cream after taste.  Definitely not making this one again and headed to the grocery store to restock some ingredients to try a different recipe

You won`t be disappointed.

I halved the recipe to make about 40 mini-cupcakes and baked for 11 mins. The only change I made was reducing the amount of cocoa to about 1/8 cup. I piped "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site and topped with red sprinkles.

I really wanted to like these cupcakes... After reading so many positive reviews for this recipe, I'm so bummed it didn't meet my expectations. These turned out very dry and uneventful. Honestly, you would be better off using a box cake mix. To me, these weren't even as good as that. I think I'll try another red velvet recipe next time.

Oh man- these are opinion changers. I've made them many times and can honestly say they're the single best cake/ cupcake recipe in my arsenal! Before these, I honestly thought homemade cupcakes or cake wasn't worth the time and effort. These break that stereotype pretty quick! They're moist, tender, easy to make, and a sure-fire crowd pleaser!

I made a few slight modifications which only enhance the already awesome recipe, including adding 2 teaspoons of lemon zest to the included recipe for icing, and adding a little more sour cream (about 2T) then listed. In addition, I beat until light and fluffy after adding the four eggs to make sure the butter doesn't get caught in my beaters.

I Love, Love, Love these cupcakes, as did my family and dinner guests! I did make some changes to increase the flavor and texture. I used 2 ¼ cups of all-purpose flour and not 2 ½ cups. I also used 2 ¼ cups of sugar and not 2 cups. I also used ½-cup buttermilk and not milk.  Finally, I used 4 teaspoons of Pure Vanilla extract not 2 teaspoons. Make sure you have your oven preheated to 350 and your cupcake liners ready before you start mixing your dry ingredients into your wet ingredients .Baking soda starts reacting as soon as it hits liquids so time is of the essence for rising. The frosting was wonderful too, yummy!  Thanks McCormick for another fabulous recipe.

Absolutely terrible recipe. I even double checked this afterwards to make sure I didn't leave something out since the cupcakes tasted so bad. My children wouldn't even eat them! They liked the frosting (I used a different recipe for cream cheese frosting) - but wouldn't eat the cake! They were very dense, dry, bad flavor, etc. Awful. I'm sad I wasted my ingredients.

I attempted to make a red velvet cake a few years ago, and I hated it.  Ever since then, I just thought that I didn't like red velvet cake.  But I needed a "Christmas" dessert for a potluck, and my daughter asked me to make red cupcakes.  I immediately thought of red velvet cupcake and found this recipe.  I did alter it a little based on what previous reviewers had said because I really wanted these to work this time.  I reduced the flour to 2 1/4 cups and used buttermilk instead of milk.  I am now a red velvet fan.  These were so good.  Moist with just the right amount of chocolate flavor.  I also used really dark cocoa, which made the color a little more burgandy than red, but I think enhanced the flavor.  I decorated with red and green sprinkles for the kids and red and silver sprinkles for the adults. The frosting is amazing.  At first, I thought it was going to be too soft to hold its shape when piped, but it worked fine and tasted amazing.   They were a hit at the party.

The cupcakes were ok; however, it was more of a chocolate cupcake vs. red velvet.  When I make them again, I will use 2 Tbls cocoa power instead of 1/2 cup.  The frosting was fabulous.  Thank you for sharing.

6 Mar 10 -- I tried this recipe again, but this time, I used 1 Tbls cocoa powder.  This is not a true red velvet recipe.  It was very dry as well.  Sorry, I do not recommend this recipe at all.  I would give it "NO STARS", but I cannot edit my ratinngs.  The frosting gets 5+ stars!

Very good! I used only about 1/3 cup cocoa, 2 1/4 cups flour, and buttermilk instead of milk. I also substituted about half of the sour cream with fat free plain yogurt, and used 4 teaspoons of vanilla extract I just frosted these with regular vanilla frosting from a can. Everyone loved these. I only wish they were more red.

This was a great recipe and I did not get a single complaint from any of my friends who ate these cupcakes! One thing I did change was the amount of flour used because I wanted perfect moistness in the cupcakes. I changed it to 2 1/4 cups flour instead.  BTW the frosting was the perfect!

NOT a true red velvet recipe. I used the whole 1 ounce bottle of red coloring and the batter looked bright fuschia, after adding the cocoa/flour mix it turned into a brown red. Not beautiful and certainly not up to par on flavor!! You're better off looking for a REAL red velvet recipe!!

This was an enjoyable cupcake that received many compliments. The cake itself was not terribly sweet, but the frosting was VERY sweet (I didn't even add all the sugar and people were still commenting on the sweetness). Overall, they balanced each other out. I found the cake to have a nice texture- moist enough without being greasy at all; and dense (in a good way) rather than heavy. Bonus: they were gorgeous little things and the batter was so amazing I could've made myself sick on it!

This is really easy to make compared to the recipes I tried previously. Cake was soft and moist. As recommended I only used 2 1/4 cup cake flour, buttermilk instead of milk and 1 tblsp of red coloring. But personally it was a tad too sweet for me. Maybe I'll use less sugar next time, there's definitely a lot more of next times. Oh and I've made similar frosting before but never with sour cream. That definitely made it tasted yummier!

Great recipe. The batter seemed thick, but in the end I loved the density of these cakes. 
I didn't use the entire bottle of colour. It does not change the taste, so I didn't bother.
They are so good served chilled. I served them at Christmas and many of my guests liked them better than any other red velvet they had tried.

I've never had a red velvet before but these are amazing... I made them for a work fundraiser and everyone couldn't stop talking about them... I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe instead cause I love that one... I tried to substitute for low fat and low salt where I could and also didn't put in the red food coloring cause in Australian its got a bad rep for being very bad for you... but besides that I wouldn't change anything about this recipe

Just made these for my daughter's birthday party which is in a few hours, and they are so dry they're almost tasteless. I've read the recipe a zillion times to see what I could have done wrong but I did everything right. Don't get it, but I am really disappointed.

I followed a review below with lessening the flour by a 1/4 of a cup, adding a 1/4 cup sugar, doubling the vanilla and using buttermilk instead of regular milk, and it was phenomenal! I could have used redder cupcakes though, maybe 10 or so more drops of color.

"Oh my"!  Those were the first words.  These are wonderful and definitely a velvet texture.  I decreased the flour and sugar, by just a bit, but otherwise followed as written.  Used about 3-3/4 cup powdered sugar.

After trying a different and way more complicated recipe that turned out disappointingly dry, I made these and they ROCK! They are supremely moist with just the right touch of chocolate.  I did sub buttermilk for the milk because I had it on hand.  Making this recipe twice gave me exactly 200 mini cupcakes. I baked them for between 13 and 14 minutes and they were just perfect.  Love the addition of sour cream, it totally puts these over the top.

These were just okay. The cocoa definitely gives it taste, so much that it is basically a chocolate cupcake. They were also a little dry. I am still searching for a rich Red Velvet recipe to rival Happy Endings.

These were the BEST! I followed the review to decrease the flour to 2 cups and increse the sugar to 2 1/2 c and they were SOOOOO moist! The frosting was too runny for me, so I had to add more powdered sugar and 4oz. more cream cheese. EXCELLENT!!

I have tried many red velvet recipes from scratch and this is the best.  This is the first review I have ever written.  I have been on the search for the perfect red velvet recipe For about 3 years and I think this one is the closest so far.  I only used 2 and 1/4 cup of flour and this was the perfect texture.  I absolutely love how much cocoa powder is in it (most others have o my a couple tbsp). My family has tried all the rest of my red velvets and after making this one they think it's the best.  The second best is on pinchmysalt.com( this site also has a greeaat cream cheese frosting recipe).  The frosting recipe was great but I actually use real vanilla beans.  I love that it was able to pipe unlike mOst cream cheese frostings.  This will be my new "go to" red velvet recipe, thank u

Very good Cake recipe but the cream cheese frosting was runny yet thick. Not a fan of the CC but next time i'll bake a red velvet i'll use this cake recipe.

I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, and used cake flour. Cupcakes came out fantastic! The cream cheese frosting was smooth and delicious and the actual cupcake themselves were tasty and moist.
They only took about 18mins to bake in my oven though. Could've probably have even been shorter.
Really good. I'll def make this again.

I followed The-Baby-Bow-Lady's advice to use buttermilk instead of regular milk and the cupcakes were out-of-this world moist.  They came out of the oven glossy and beautiful, good enough to eat without frosting.  However, they taste like chocolate cupcakes that have been colored red.  The cream cheese frosting tastes good-- the friend I made these for (a big Red Velvet fan) told me he loved the frosting, but even after sitting in the fridge for a day, it wasn't stiff at all.  It's not good for decorating.  I'd make the cake part again but would look for a stiffer frosting.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, and LOVED these.  I made them around Valentine's day and gave one-third of them to my boyfriend and the rest were distributed between friends and family.  I think the cake itself would not have been sweet enough on its own, but paired with the frosting it's just perfect- the sweet-but-not-too-sweet frosting balances everything out.  The recipe yielded about 36 cupcakes, but I still have a ton of frosting left over.  It's too good to waste though..

I liked these and everyone at the event I went to seemed to like them as well. I didn't change the recipe at all but 20 minutes of baking time should be plenty and maybe that would hinder it from being dry for those that reviewed them as such. Mine were not dry.

I just made this literally an hour ago. I followed the directions exactly, and they turned out AMAZING! I didn't use the frosting recipe, but used store-bought. It was just easier and I didn't have that much time. I know my friends will love them for Valentine's Day!

As is, not fantastic. It probably needs some tweaks to get it really moist, so next time I'll substitute buttermilk for the regular milk and add a half cup of oil to see if that helps. The batter is really stiff at the end, and the cupcakes dry out quickly (30 minutes after taking out of the oven they seemed pretty dry to me). The frosting was very thin and I couldn't conceive of piping it unless I had added way more sugar - and I didn't want to make it that sweet. I'd probably also bake for just 20 minutes in our oven (instead of 25), again to retain the moistness. My husband and brother liked the cupcakes (but they'll eat anything labeled red velvet) while I thought they were just "meh."UPDATE 4/18/2011 - I just upgraded this to four stars based on the following changes: I decreased the flour to 2 1/4 cups; substituted buttermilk for the milk; decreased butter to 1 1/2 cup and then added 1/2 cup oil. Baked for 18 minutes. This GREATLY improved the moistness of these cupcakes - the last time I made them they were intolerably dry. Now they just need to be a little sweeter so I will probably add a couple extra tablespoons of sugar the next time I make them.

I get praised every single time I make these!  I cut the frosting size in half though.  And it doesn't really take that much food coloring to make them that red.  I used less than half an ounce and still got the same color.

This is the first time I made a cake recipe from scratch and they came out delicious!!  I asked the recipe for the directions for only 8 cupcakes and it came out perfect...  Of course I am known for having the best tasting cakes around even if they usually come from a box!  It's all in the mixing and not over doing it!  Very tasty recipe! Thanks

This was my first red velvet recipe, and I think it's the one I'll stick with! Based on some of the reviews, I did make a few adjustments. I used 2 1/4 cups of flour, 2 1/4 cups sugar, and doubled the vanilla in the batter. I also used buttermilk instead of milk. They came out moist, rich, and delicious. I'll definitely be making these again!

I have a cake business and I always dreaded when customers would order red velvet.  I could never find a recipe that I was happy with...until now.  This is very moist (though I did add 3 Tbsp. oil for added moisture and I use buttermilk instead of milk) and very flavorful!  Love it!

3.5 stars.

I follwed recipe exactly and it turned out a bit dry. Frosting is delicious but the actual cupcake could have tasted better. 

I made 50 and people loved them but I personally wasn't wowed. Will try again with recomended changes.

I tried this recipe to the exact recipe first. I gave it 4 stars based on the written recipe! ( I hate when someone rates is when the recipe is changed!!) As written it was good and a got to recipe for red Velvet. I made the change of using buttermilk instead of regular milk and I the would give it 5 stars!!! Red velvet requires buttermilk to seperate it from being a chocolate cake!

My first effort at red velvet and it was a hit!  I used two of the red coloring that comes in the multi pack -and the color was still great.  I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I used 2 teaspoons of pear essence instead of the vanilla and  I added a half teaspoon of raspberry extract, wow!  Cream cheese frosting on top.  This recipe is simple and tasty.

I just made these cupcakes. After reading all the reviews I made some adjustments. I used 1/4 less flour, instead of 1/2 C milk I used 1 C buttermilk, 2 1/2 tsp vanilla and baked for 18 mins. 20-25 is WAYYYY too long for cupcakes. I got about 35 cupcakes from this recipe. I did not try the frosting, but instead used the Whipped Cream Cheese frosting that everyone was raving about. It was DELISH!!!

These came out really nice. The kids loved em' they were easy, and yes, the icing really is tasty. I have the left over icing in the piping bag in the fridge for a quick batch I may just whip up in the next day or two.

Sour cream always gives chocolate cake a wonderful light texture!  I made the recipe as suggested EXCEPT that I omitted the artificial red food coloring.  I don't understand why people want a red chocolate cake.  Instead, I added an extra amount of milk so the total liquids would be right.  These tasted great and disappeared.  I used a raspberry cream frosting and also carved a small hole in the cake and inserted a fresh raspberry inside the cake.  My daughter appreciated these for her birthday!

I have to agree with the reviewers who said these cupcakes are a bit dry.  One of the best things about red velvet cake is that it is moist and dense.  On the up side, cream cheese frosting makes anything taste great!

I gave these cupcakes 5/5 because they were fabulous but, the flavour is not red velvet. I read several reviews befor making these and decided to make adjustments right away. I made buttermilk - 1/2 cup milk & 1 1/2 tsp. white vinegar, used 1/4 cup more sugar and a 1/4 cup less flour and 3/4 butter & 1/4 shortening because I ran out of butter. Not sure if the original recipe would've tasted much different but the last thing I wanted was dry cupcakes. 
These cupcakes were so moist, perfectly sweet and just delicious! The icing was also amazing.  I made them for Easter and everybody loved them! 
Recipe made 36 cupcakes and there was just enough icing.

This is a very good cake, even though i changed it a bit but nothing that would change the overall taste much, just a lack of ingredients. I used yogurt instead of sour cream, added extra 1/2 cup cocoa powder and 1/4 cup butter milk. I didnt add the food coloring. The results were perfect chocolate moist rich melt in your mouth cold or warm cup cakes/ cake. I didnt even get the chance to frost them before they disappeared, luckly half the batter was used for a square 7x7 which i will split and fill with a white chocolate and cherry frosting covered in whip cream. If it comes out the way i plan ill post the recipe. Thanks again for this very tastey treat.

this recipe was great! i made a dozen cupcakes and then put the rest into a cake pan and they all turned out wonderful! of course i had to bake the cake a little longer (about 40-45 minutes instead of 25) but the results were something to brag about. A hit at the firestation!

Bland and waste of time and money. Not very chocolatey. Substituted buttermilk for milk. Maybe blandness is just the nature of red velvet in order to let the cream cheese frosting shine? Will not make again.

Everyone I have made these for raves about them! I am always asked to make them for parties. They are moist and not too sickly sweet and I use the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this website and it is a perfect match! I wouldnt change a single thing

The published recipe for the cake batter does need tweaking (use buttermilk instead of milk and/or add a tablespoon of vegetable oil).  I did both and they came out quite moist.  You need quite a bit of food colouring to get a real red colour.  The frosting is fab - but I still think I improved it.  I whipped it up in my stand mixer to double in volume.  I put the pastry bag with the icing in the refrigerator (since whipping it makes it too soft to pipe right away).  I piped the frosting quite high ontop of the cupcakes - a good 1.5" to 2" high, like fluffy clouds.  These were a big hit - am making again!

The cupcakes were very moist, and the taste was good. I didn't have enough food coloring, so they came out a little pink. When I made the cupcakes, I had more than 30. Because of this, there wasn't enough frosting for all of them, and I had to resort to the store bought kind. But over all, very yummy cupcakes!

Like other people, the frosting is FABULOUS and I would rate it a 5 stars. There is nothing I would change about it. The cupcakes are good, but not the best I've ever had. I made them once and then again with some of the suggestions from other people and they were much better (hence 5 stars overall). I would agree that the original recipe is a little dry: Bring the flour down a little bit, bring the sugar up a little bit, add 50% more vanilla, and use BUTTERMILK instead of regular milk.

This recipe is great!  Everybody at our get together loved it.  Only 1 modification i did was to reduce the amount of powder sugar to half for icing.  I usually take off icing from any cake since they are just too sugary, but I really liked the fact it was not too sweet, so I even added extra onto mine as I ate.    I will try to reduce some sugar for the cake and use low fat cream cheese and non fat sour cream next time and see if it is as good.

Excellent recipe.  Very moist and tender.  Loved the cream cheese frosting! I made this for a potluck and they were a big hit with everyone who ate them.  Even had several people ask for the recipe.   Be careful not to over mix once you add the flour mixture or they will be tough as you over develop the gluten in the flour.

I am ashamed to say I didn't follow the recipe as written, but my results were delicious! I followed the modifications suggested by other reviewers (Decreased flour, increased sugar, and half the cocoa) and used cake flour. I used gel food coloring rather than the liquid, but be warned, 1oz of the gel is much stronger than the liquid stuff. I probably could have used half that much. I also took them out a bit too early, fearing dryness, and they fell! On the plus side, I made the frosting as it's listed,  and it was scrumptious. Popped it in the fridge for a bit so I could pipe it, but it stays soft, so don't make lofty decorating plans with it. I didn't give them away as planned because I was afraid they'd come out weird, but everyone in the house loved them! Even the last few, on the 3rd day, were as good as they were on day 1. A fantastic and forgiving recipe.

I give this recipe a 5 due to the recommendations of the Baby-Bow-Lady (BBL).  OMG!!!! AWESOME!!!  OUT OF THIS WORLD!! FANTASTIC.  I am so proud of ME...and my family just absolutely fell in LOVE with the cakes that I made.  BBL, I your suggestions for the batter and it was phenomenal ( I did double the vanilla as you suggested..but it was by accident or divine intervention).  For the frosting I used 2 packages of cream cheese and 1 stick of unsalted butter, 2 tsp of pure vanilla extract, and confectioners sugar to taste.  Once I blended those ingredients WELL I folded in a 1/2 container of french vanilla cool whip and placed the frosting in the fridge until I was ready to frost the mini cakes I made.  I am usually the "QUEEN of SEMI-HOMEMADE", but I actually made this phenomenal cake from "SCRATCH" with all of the GREAT advice you all provided.  Thanks for being great team players and making me feel awesome during my post-op recovery period.....yes I was eating cake at 11:00pm.  I'll be back in the gym soon, but until then I'll dive head first into another slice of cake.  :-)

This recipe makes the perfect Red Velvet cupcake. I am a home baker and I use this recipe for my business, my clients love it! I halved this recipe and it yielded me 3 dozen mini cupcakes. I can't comment on the frosting since I use my own cream cheese frosting recipe, but the cake recipe is spot on!

These turned out great.  I was looking for a recipe that I could use my new piping bag and I think I had more fun decorating!  Placed them on a bed of Jordan almonds.

The cupcakes were excellent, the frosting was too sweet though, I would recommend cutting down on the amount of confectioners' sugar. I also didn't have cocoa powder on hand and substituted hot cocoa mix, which worked out fine.

This is hands down the best red velvet cupcake recipe out there...I made no changes except...I dropped the temperture to 325 and kept the time at 20 minutes. I spooned 1/3 c into each liner (2/3 would overflow). They came out (24 cupcakes) incredibly light, fluffy, and moist. I loved the chocolate flavor too... usually red velvet is bland...not this recipe! I got some amazing compliments on them! I am a little shocked at some of the bad reviews!

My first time through I followed the review advice and used buttermilk instead of milk. I think these are great cup cakes but I'm not sure I favor the buttermilk. Very sophisticated taste. I will use this recipe again with regular milk. 

Frosting is superb

I have never made cupcakes. This recipe is so easy, my 10 year old made with minimum of my supervision. The cupcakes come out moist and fluffy, the frosting is simply delicious. We had to cut down sugar the first time and even more so the second time. Will use this recipe as a base for some other types of cupcakes. Thank you for sharing!

After using up all the red food coloring in the house, the cupcakes still weren't red and after cooking them, they were more like mud velvet cupcakes than red velvet. Will never try again!

I bake A LOT but have never made red velvet cakes/cupcakes before and this recipe was a great one to try. The cupcakes were moist and not too sweet (since the icing was sweet enough).  I didn't change a single thing and they turned out perfectly.  JUST REMEMBER not to over mix, I think that's something a lot of people tend to do and your cupcakes won't turn out as fluffy or moist.  THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!

These were really good, i did not put enough food coloring in. (i thought i was putting too much in by squeezing almost half a tube of gel coloring and they came out dark red. next time i will add more coloring. they tasted great though.

Amazing! I've made these as two 9" cakes a few times and it always comes out moist and delicious. I love adding chocolate chips or walnuts for a good texture contrast.
I've never had to use that much red food colouring, though. I just add until the batter is a vibrant red and it's always turned out great.

Im not much of a baker,but my Son loves red velvet cake/cupcakes so i decided to try this. So much cheaper than buying them. I know some said they were dry or not classic red velvet. Well we loved them and mine were not dry at all, which i don't care for. I only made half the recipe well with school out and extra kids i wish i would have made all 30. The only change was i had an open package of sugar so didn't know how much was in it i just added and tasted, it wasn't overly sweet. I could sit and eat the frosting with a spoon Thank you we will be eating alot of these over the summer, oh and did i mention so easy

Mmm! This was my second try at Red Velvet Cupcakes, and these turned out better than the last recipe. So moist and yummy! There isn't anything I would change about this recipe, at all! This made 24 quite large cupcakes, and they only took 20 mins to bake. Definitely recommend.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would! I am baking my second batch right now, and I can't believe how light, fluffy, and delicious these cakes are!! I followed the recipe exactly, but cut it in half. Half the recipe made 44 mini cupcakes. This recipe is definitely going in my book!!!!

I had high hopes for these but ended up pretty disappointed.  I couldn't believe how chocolatey tasting they were; red velvet cake is not supposed to be a chocolate cake.  After doing some research I found that most red velvet cupcake recipes have only 2 tablespoons of cocoa or less so I'm shocked that this recipe calls for 1/2 cup of cocoa.  I like chocolate cupcakes but I wanted red velvet cake and this was not it.  They also did not end up very moist at all (and I only cooked them 18 mins!) and were too dense for my tastes.  Lastly, if you like anymore than an 1/8 of an inch of frosting on your cupcake then you're not going to have NEARLY enough frosting for 30 cupcakes.  Not making this recipe again

I am a high school student and I made these cookies for my choir's Christmas caroling party and they were an absolute hit! My mom (who is not crazy about cakes in the least) tried them and now she can't stop asking me to make them for a second time.  They were very simple to make and the frosting is outrageously good.  I cut the sugar by half a cup and as suggested by a previous reviewer, separated the egg whites and whisked them up and later added them to the wet ingredients.  My oven over heats a bit so I put the timer on for about 18 minutes and they came out perfectly moist and very light.  They didn't turn out with the vibrant red color that I thought they would, but that was no big deal with the taste they acquired. To add a little Christmas spirit to them, I crushed some candy canes and sprinkled that on top and they were gorgeous! Definitely making these bad boys again :)

Delicious! I would recommend taking it out just on time to maintain the moist texture. I left mine in a bit too long. Very yum!! Will make again.

The only change I made was using buttermilk instead of milk, thinking it would make the cupcake more moist. This cupcake was way to heavy and dense for me and my family. I was also very careful not to over mix so I am not sure what happened...So disappointing!

I made these into mini cupcakes and baked them for 13 minutes. I also made the cake flour and buttermilk substitutions. The cake is very light and moist and the frosting is a basic, just like it should be, cream cheese frosting.

This recipe did not work out for us. We're not really a fan of red velvets but just thought I would give it a chance. Sorry to say but my husband said he did not care for the taste. Maybe I shouldve read reviews.

Nothing at all like a traditional southern red velvet cake. Tasted like a burnt chocolat cookie.  A Red Velvet Cake suppose to have a little twang taste.

Baked this for a girls night and it was a hit! I had requests to make it again for birthday parties and Christmas parities.  The vanilla cream frosting was not overwhelmingly sweet and complimented the red velvet perfectly. I will definitely make these again the next time I have a gathering!

This was the review from one of my co-workers:  I think that's a HIT!!! 

Presentation: Yummy***

Icing: Perfection***

Moistness: Spot on***

Flavor:  Very good but I think could use a little something more…not sure what…sweeter?  Richer? I can’t quite put my finger on it

Love this recipe and super easy. The sour cream in the red velvet and in the frosting is what sets it apart.

I thought these were just okay.  I took them to a 70th birthday party and they were eaten, but a few comments stated that they were dry.

I have made these cupcakes a few times now and they are delicious. The first time I made them I found the cream cheese frosting wasn't thick enough to pipe on to the cupcakes which was my goal, so I doubled the amount of cream cheese and added icing sugar until it was thick and creamy.

Made these for daughters birthday instead of large cake.  My family loved these and the cupcakes are so much easier to store.  To change the icing slightly I also added a bit of cinnamon  1 tsp to the frosting.

De-lish!!! I made these cupcakes for my little brother's football team, and everyone loved them. The only thing I changed in the cake recipe was that I used green food coloring instead of red because his team colors were green (cake) and white (frosting). I also made the frosting recipe more sweet and less cream chessey because little kids like it that way. I prefer the frosting recipe as it is though. Definitely a recipe I will use time and time again.

Mmm....yum. mmm... very moist and flavorful. this recipe has more cocoa powder than other recipes I've recently tried and you can definitely taste it. Most other recipes also call for two entire bottles of red food coloring, but this one proves to be a good, vibrant red color without the extra coloring. Saves me $3/bottle - definite perk! Mmm... did I mention these cupcakes are devilishly moist and delicious?!

I followed the recipe exactly, minus the frosting (I used traditional buttercream) and the red food colouring.  I used a mixture of pink and purple neon food colourings that I had on hand, and the end result was still a lovely deep reddish purple colour.  They taste amazing too!  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Cupcakes with modifications came out perfect. I followed the modifications of the first few reviews. Cupcakes got rave reviews and husband said they were the best cupcakes he ever had.

I'd give the cupcakes a 5 - they were perfectly moist and just the right sweetness

I'd give the icing a 3 - a bit too sweet for my liking

that being said, they got rave reviews so maybe I won't change a thing :)

I made these for my daughter's birthday yesterday, and they came out delicious.  She would have been happy eating the batter and skipping the baking...it was that good!  This is an easy recipe to follow...and the results are beyond yummy!!

More chocolatey than velvet cake-like, but really good all the same.  They came out very fluffy and beautifully rounded at the top (I followed the recipe exactly).  I would suggest chilling the frosting for a little while before attempting to frost the cupcakes.  My frosting got a little runny near the end.  I made the frosting light green and put bright green-colored coconut on the top of the frosting with Easter-themed M&M's on top of each one to make a bunch of adorable mini garden plots for my Grammy's 93rd birthday.  They came out very cute!

I wouldn't add a whole pound of sugar next time to the frosting because it was tooooo sweet. But they are very tasty and moist! I used buttermilk instead of milk.

Quick and easy recipe! These cupcakes were very moist.  I used buttermilk and 1/3 cup of cocoa instead of a 1/2 a cup.  I think this cupcake would be even better if it were filled with some sort of dark chocolate cream.

hands down the best red velvet recipe i've ever had!! i cut the serving size down to 12 just to make one pan but did increase the sugar about 1/4c more than what the decreased serving size brought it down to. these were so moist no pudding mix needed! the icing was also great and so easy to make. i tinted the icing pink for a great valentines dessert. next time i'll make all 30 servings!! ***edited 3/2/11 i just made these again and had to use canned cream cheese frosting because i was out of cream cheese and they are not nearly as good! the canned frosting is overwhelming the taste of the cupcake! if you have to use canned frosting i don't recommend cream cheese flavor maybe just vanilla. i won't ever use canned frosting on these again! i'm eating the rest of these without the tops so i can taste the actual cake part because these are sooo good!

I made these in heart-shaped muffin moulds for Valentine's Day and frosted them with creamy chocolate frosting and a half strawberry to decorate. Utterly divine. The velvetiest texture imaginable! Perfect for Valentine's Day. My children LOVED them.

I can't say enough good things about this recipe. I made another recipe for red velvet cupcakes last night, they did not turn out well at all, too heavy, and I tossed them in the garbage.

I made these before I left for the office this morning for a bake sale they were having....oh my, not only were they quick and easy to bake but everyone loved them and each one sold!

The only change I made was that I used buttermilk rather than milk.

I made these into plain chocolate cupcakes because when it was time to add the red food coloring, I realized I didn't have any. Plus, I halved the recipe because I didn't have enough butter. :/ These were lovely cupcakes and very moist.

I was a little scared to try these, because I generally don't like red food coloring (like red frosting - yuck!!) but I was pleasantly surprised....these were SO good!  My whole family loved them.  Now I'm hooked.  I'll definitely make them again.

This recipe was really good. I followed the recipe but I only used 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and used almond extract instead of vanilla. I made them for a friend's birthday and everyone loved them. They took longer to cook then it said but that wasn't a big deal. Overall I loved them and the frosting is one of the best ones I have ever made. I made the cupcakes and the frosting the night before and the frosting thickened up nice and they looked really pretty. I plan to use this recipe again.

My daughter baked these and they were delicious.  She halved the recipe because we just didnt' need that many, half recipe yielded 12 cupcakes.  The only change she made was that she sifted the measured flour and cocoa.  I suggested it to her just because I'm old fashioned and I think it makes a difference.  She used a different frosting though, it had cream cheese, white chocolate and peppermint.  OMGosh, it was awesome.  2 days after she baked them I took the leftovers to work, they were still moist.  They are a hit with everyone who tasted them.

4 stars indeed The frosting was SUPER! however I agree with the previous comments that the cake part was a bit dry for my liking [almost like a sweet cornbread texture] i am used to moist red velvet cakes but these still taste great. I believe a little more milk or oil added would give them the lacking moisture. I followed the recipe as is aside from substituting buttermilk for the milk portion and topped with chopped pecans

YUM!!!!!!  These cupcakes are awesome!!  I used buttermilk and they turned out light and fluffy....  I added a little more food color as they were looking a little too pink!  The cream cheese frosting finished them off a treat!!  Would make again, but not too often as I don't think my jeans would fit!  ;)

So, I made the frosting first and after tasting it, I don't even care what the cupcakes taste like!  Seriously though, these cupcakes are great too.  I am not a huge cake lover and I think cake is just a vehicle for frosting :)  But these taste wonderful; just slightly fudgy and delicious.  I'm taking these to a bridal shower tomorrow night and I'm sure they will be well received!

This recipe is OUTSTANDING!!! I looked at a couple different recipes and decided on this one.  They turned out super moist and super red!! I think maybe people misread the ingredients for the red food coloring you have to buy the individual red food coloring it is 1oz if you use the little bottle in the set that is only .25 oz.  This is just like my Aunts homemade recipe!

This was my first time making Red Velvet cake. I really liked this cupcake but felt it was a little too chocolatey. I used a dark chocolate cocoa and think that maybe why. They were not as red as I would have liked, you could only tell they were Red Velvet from the red color on the baking cups.   Next time I will cut back the cocoa and use red gel food coloring inplace of the liquid.   (I did not make the frosting that went with the cupcakes)

I'm not sure what happened but these cupcakes didn't turn out well. I followed the recipe exactly, with all fresh ingredients, but they tasted terrible. The cream cheese frosting was great, but the cake itself was not good. It upsets me because I went out and bought all new ingredients for this recipe, busted out my kitchen aid stand mixer, and was really excited to serve these tomorrow at a bridal shower. I'm not sure what happened, since the rest of the reviews are all outstanding, but either way I will not be trying these again.

I would recommend baking for only 18 minutes.  Also, it needs to have 1 tsp. white vinegar or lemon juice and 1/2 cup shortening. Cut the flour down to 2 cups.

Just made these today to take to a party. The only modification I made was to omit the red food coloring. I was very impressed with the results. The cake is easy to make, light like a box cake but without any of the chemicals and not too sweet - a perfect balance since the frosting's so rich. The recipe yielded 32 cupcakes (using medium size muffin cups) and I was able to heavily ice 29 of them so for those who don't use as much icing, there'd be some to spare. : ) The icing is very good - rich but not overly sweet. The sour cream does make the mixture quite moist, so just keep adding icing sugar until you get the desired consistency.

These were the hit of my sister's graduation party! I made sure to cream the sugar and butter together EXTREMELY well and they came out so amazingly moist and delicious without any changes at all to the recipe. I really enjoyed these with no changes, but after frosting a few, my sister tried the frosting and said it was too tart for her, so I added another cup of sifted powdered sugar. The sweeter, slightly stiffer frosting was great as well, and it was her party, so she could have her cupcakes how she wanted them! =)

NOTE TO SELF: try this recipe again, using the alternate recipe suggested in the first comment

Frosting was a little sweet for my taste and the cake came out dry :( Will continue my hunt for the perfect red velvet cake recipe ...

These were GREAT and beautiful! The cupcake was very moist and delicious. I baked mine for about 22 minutes. The frosting was great also, I added about 1/4 c more powdered sugar than it called for to help the frosting stiffen a little more.
I made these again today as a vanilla cupcake and just left out the cocoa and red color and added about 2 T of flour- they turned out really good as well!

GREAT recipe! Don't make any changes to the ingredients...but after I take them out of the oven I immediately wrap them in tin foil for 10 minutes.  Then, I put them on a cooling rack and tent the foil.  They are moist for DAYS.  Yum!

Super moist and fluffy.  The perfect chocolate cupcake.  These were excellent.  I did not have a full 1 oz bottle of red food coloring so mine did not turn out so red but it didn't make a difference they were chocolate  and looked like chocolate cupcakes.  I did reduce cocoa to 1/3 cup because I used dark cocoa powder. I also used a whipped cream icing which was equally fluffy. 2 cups chilled heavy cream  3/4 cup confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract(mix together w/electric mixture till stiff peaks start to form).  My finished batch tasted like they came from a gourmet bakery.  Topped with valentine themed sprinkles.

I am 14 years old, and this is the first time I've ever baked something from scratch. Considering the fact that I'm an amateur, these cupcakes came out pretty well. I followed the recipe exactly. My 16 year old brother LOVES them- he will most likely be eating them all. My one suggestion is to add more then 2 cups of sugar to the cupcakes. They were not sweet enough.

I listened to the other reviews and decreased the amount of flour to only 2 cups. However, this recipe gets 5 stars because this is the best cream cheese frosting ever! I've tried quite a few other frosting recipes and this one is the absolute best! Will be using this frosting for my cinnamon rolls

Wonderful recipe! Made these for a Valentine's day gift and they turned out really well. I didn't use the full bottle of Food Coloring and it turned out to a nice, dark red. Added a cute Sweet Heart for a nice touch.

Very moist with checking the cake early and pulling them out just when the toothpick is clean...about  17 min or so.  Also used buttermilk in place of milk since it was on hand.  The icing is a wonderful compliment!

these cupcakes were such a crowd pleaser! I did modify it with the help of other reviewers and it just made all the difference, I do suggest you use more food coloring then what is asked but everything else was wonderful! the most amazing part of this whole thing was the frosting! omg consistency was beautiful and it was so delicious I could eat it just as is! definitely going to make these again

I really loved the way the cake itself came out, however, I was disappointed with the icing - it is a runny mess and all over the place. While I have just learned that European icing sugar does not have cornstarch, I do not think that it would have made a huge difference to using a sugar with cornstarch or adding my own. Luckily, they are still delicious.

Great recipe! Cupcakes came out very moist and fluffy. I suggest blending with mixer until VERY smooth to get the 'velvety' smooth effect for texture. Cooked mine for 17 minutes in the oven and they were perfect!

I also used buttermilk in place of milk (3/4 cup) and just 1/2 ounce red dye.  The color was perfect.  The only thing that seemed off in this recipe was the amount of confectioner's sugar.  I used WAY less, and it was still too much.  To cut the insane sugariness, I added some lime zest.

By far the best cupcakes I have ever made and tasted. I was super hesitant about the sour cream in the recipe but it truly made them perfect. They required some time and attention, but were relatively easy to make and were worth all the time. The vanilla cream cheese frosting recipe is amazing. I will never use another recipe again.

Red velvet is my go-to baked good because it's one of the few things everyone in my family enjoys. I tried this recipe just to mix it up a bit. I followed the recipe exactly and the cupcakes came out dry and pretty much flavorless. I tried to bake them for less time than suggested, but it seems they go from gooey and under baked to dry and crumbly in just a few seconds. These are definitely not like the moist, flavorful red velvet cupcakes I usually make. I now have 24 cupcakes sitting on the kitchen counter that no one will eat...needless to say I will not be making these again.

I made this as a cake, with the changes recommended by several other reviews (reducing flour to 2 and 1/4 cups, increasing sugar to 2 and 1/4 cups, and substituted evaporated milk with 1/2 tbsp vinegar for the milk). I thought the cake was very dense and heavy, but those I made it for said they really liked it.  For finishing touches, I made a layer of sliced fresh strawberries and frosting.  Then after frosting the outside, I decorated with some sliced/fanned-out strawberries and a dusting of cocoa powder.  If I made this again, I would likely use cake flour for a lighter cake and add a bit more cocoa powder for more of a chocolaty flavor.

These are freaking amazing! I've tried a couple of other Red Velvet recipes and while I enjoyed the flavor, they had a tendency of not fluffing very well and didn't know how to fix it....

I tried this experimental recipe for Mother's Day / my BFF's late B-Day celebration... Followed the recipe exactly as is, and just a few thoughts I might add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and maybe an extra 1/4 of the cocoa powder to make the flavor slightly stronger... I need to say however, I was the only person that thought they needed these, since I am a completely control freak and not 100% happy until things are PERFECT from my perspective, but everybody else in my family loved them.... 

Also, I did not get 30 cupcakes I actually got more, probably 15 or 16 more than that, and that was filling them up to aprox 3/4, I think they should really be filled in to about half so they can look like cupcakes and not muffins (got plenty of those!!) haha 

Another note is I did not use the cream cheese frosting from this recipe cause I had some frozen left over from another one I just added an extra cream cheese block and some powdered sugar to increase the amount and frost these little guys....

I'm generally not a fan of red velvet cake but these may convert me! The batter was fantastic. After letting them cool and sit at room temperature the cakes seemed a bit dry. I don't know if it was the baking time or leaving them out too cool for too long. I topped them with cream cheese, cherry, coconut and pecan frosting. Yum!

I jave gotten so  many compliments on these, people say they have never had red veldt as good as this. This recipe is definitely a keeper! I love it and make here for every event I go to. They are always a huge hit. 
*Tip: Very helpful to scoop out batter with an ice-cream scoop and into baking pan

This was a great recipe! The cupcake was very moist,soft, and very delicious. I didn't have the sour cream so I substituted it for vanilla greek yogurt that I already had on hand. It worked and the cupcakes turned out fine. Using plain (or vanilla,) greek yogurt would be a fabulos subsitute for sour cream. The frosting was really yummy, I did put a bit more cream cheese through. Best red velvet cupcake recipe ever! (This recipe makes A LOT of batter) :)

Dry recipe - flavor ok.  In researching, going to try a recipe with veg oil in lieu of butter.  Additionally, traditional red velvet seems to have buttermilk and vinegar.

So I made these cupcakes (and yes I followed the recipe exactly) and they were okay. I wouldn't call them red velvet cupcakes though as they taste nothing like real red velvet cake. It's basically a chocolate cake recipe with red food coloring, and that is not what the red velvet cake is all about. It totally lacks the tangyness from the vinegar used in real red velvet cake. I used this recipe thinking that maybe the sour cream would give that same tangyness but alas it did not. Now that's not to say that they weren't good. They're decent as far as a chocolate cake is concerned. They are very moist and have a lot of flavor to them. But again the name of this recipe is very deceiving...

I have never made a red velvet cake before, so was a bit nervous about making this one. I've had a few disasters relating to cupcakes, but this recipe was a piece of cake (literally!). Lovely texture, and the richness of colour was beautiful. The icing, though - not so sure about. It was pretty and soft, but I prefer a cream cheese icing that has less icing sugar in it, purely because of that chalky grainy feel you can get with it. I added some lemon juice to cut through that - it just gives the flavour more fullness. Other than that, I would make this again in a heartbeat! Very impressed!

Ok, never been a fan of red velvet...it's always been so BLAH! It always seems so flavorless.  This receipe is different. The chocolate comes through and they are dense and moist.  I used the Wilton gel food coloring in the jars, so I had to guess how much to add, but I just kept adding until it looked to be the right color.  The cream cheese frosting recipe included is awesome! It's not too cream cheesy or too sweet. I made these and put them in green cup cake liners, then sprinkled red edible glitter on the frosting for our office Christmas party...huge hit! I will only eat this red velvet from now on!

and i thought red velvets are just red! i made a batch of this treat and they became my new fave in an instant! my wife loved them and everyone who got the chance of tasting them... they taste even better when left in the fridge for several days... the frosting is perfect!
although i must admit, i used a little substitution, due to no sour cream available, i added vinegar to a cup of an all purpose cream and let it rest for several minutes in the fridge and VOILA!!! instant sour cream! thanks for posting the recipe!

Very yummy!  The changes I made-cake flour instead of all-purpose, added less food coloring than directed, and I did add 1 tsp. of distilled white vinegar.  For the frosting I added another 1/4 cup of butter making it 1/2 cup, added a small amount of whipped cream and some extra powdered sugar. For the cream cheese, I used an 8 oz. container of whipped cream cheese instead.  On top, I garnished with chocolate chips..  Baked the cupcakes in a gas oven for 21 minutes.  Might have been slightly better at 20 minutes.  Thank you!

The batter and final product are both so delicious. I don't even know the right words to describe it. I used this recipe to make Despicable Me Minion cupcakes and the cupcake was wonderful. My only issue is with the cream cheese frosting recipe. It might have been an operator error, but the frosting wasn't fluffy and thick and was a bit runny. I will definitely make the frosting again, as it had the an incredible flavor, but I'll have to make some adjustments.

Would not make these again, I felt they were too dry and not sweet enough.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and didn't make any changes.  I think the cocoa flavor was overpowering, my boyfriend said they tasted like chocolate cupcakes.

Fantastic red velvet cupcake recipe.  I read other reviews that said they came out dry.  To fix this, I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour and cut the cocoa powder down to 1/4 cup.  Beautifully red and moist.  Hope this helps.

I followed the advise of another reviewer (The-Baby-Bow-Lady), and found that the revisions wer very helpful.  I do, however feel that I need alittle more practice with the icing, as it was a bit runny the day I made the cupcakes. I found that they were actually better and the icing was a quite a bit firmer the second day. I will make these again.

The cake was good.  I have had better but it was OK.  The frosting tasted good but it was way too soft to decorate a cupcake.  I had to double the 10x sugar to make it stiff enough to decorate.  By doing that, it overwhelmed the flavor.

I loved these cakes. The recipe was huge! I made 24 mini- cupcakes, 12 regular sized ones, and a circle cake! For someone doing a bake sale or something to the effect of needing a lot of sweets this is the recipe to bake! :-D

This cupcake recipe is a hit! Delicious, extremely moist, and easy. I made these from scratch an hour before my valentines date and there was even enough time to frost them. I will definitely make them again.

Since I bake a lot, I too made modifications (1/4 cup less flour, added 1/4 tsp of almond and about 7 semi-sweet chocolate chips each cup, used buttermilk instead of milk, folded 1 TBS of white vinegar at the end).  But really, the main concern is the baking time at 25 minutes.   I baked for 15 minutes they were moist, the sour cream typically makes any cake pretty moist.  So bake for about 15 minutes and check.  I did use a white chocolate cream cheese icing which was THA BOMB!

These cupcakes turned out perfect!  I didn't like the frosting consistency and had to add another pound of conf. sugar and another quarter cup of butter.  My family is waiting for the next batch.

1 Star take out because the cream is kind of sweet. So my advice if you dont want too sweet, then use less Confectioners sugar. 

Very easy to make but require little patience especially measure the ingredient. Still not the best Red Velvet.

The recipe was easy to follow and make, the cupcakes tasted great! I made a different frosting though. It's basically the same, but instead of the sour cream, I used 1 cup of melted white chocolate chips.

My low rating might be my fault... tried to use this as a cake.  By the time it was done in the middle the edges were burnt and we ended up throwing most of it away.

Very disappointed with this recipe. The cupcakes were very bland and dry. Hopefully the frosting will save them, but i would not follow the recipe as is ever again.

Amazing recipe, never had it fail. To make the cake redder in co our I used paste food colour, gives it a deeper colour. I also alter the recipe and use it for vanilla cake just take out the food colour and cocoa powder add a little more milk and flour, and it's perfect. Made my friends birthday cake from this recipe and everybody raved about how moist it was.

I followed the directions exactly and they turned out kind of bland with the exception of the frosting. I think next time I will substitute the milk for buttermilk and make some other changes as suggested.

I love this recipe as written.  I have used it at least a dozen times for cupcakes and a shaped cake.  I made a patron bottle cake from is and a book and I get lots of cupcake orders for it.  It is moist and has a nice crumb.

This was a easy recipe -and my first attempt at making mini red velvet cupcakes (or red velvet in general). Super delish; I don't recall trying any red velvet before. Mini cupcakes were baked in 13ish minutes, and with this recipe I made a little over 100 cupcakes.

I wasn't overly impressed with the icing, but it could have been something I did wrong. I will probably use a little more food coloring because the cake batter was a little darker then I'm use to for red velvet. But overall, I will def make again and everyone who ate the cake liked it.

Bear in mind this was my first attempt at baking. The cupcakes came out very dry and the frosting was weird. I can see how the batter recipie could be awesome if it was moist. Maybe buttermilk or a pan of water underneath may help. I will try it again; the batter part that is. The frosting was just not to my liking. Find a replacement for the frosting. It was exceptionally easy to make though and visually very appealing.

Cupcakes came out pretty moist and yummy. I am not usually a big fan of red velvet but attempted to bake these for my boyfriend who's favorite is red velvet. He ate 3 in a row! The only disappointment was that the cupcakes came out a dark burgundy instead of bright red, other than that, I will totally be making these again. My next mission is to have them come out red!

just made these for the first time. I wish I would have read the bad reviews that said they were dry, because they are pretty dry. The taste is ok,  but next time I will follow some of the alterations to make them moist.

these are sensational! all my friends were raving about it!! One thing I would do the next time would be to add 1/3 less sugar to the cream cheese frosting so it's not overly sweet!

These are basically mild chocolate cupcakes colored red. Nothing very special about them hence the two stars. The cupcakes was dense and moist so that was good but not that much flavor otherwise.

I thought these were a little dry. Also, against my better judgment, I used the cream cheese frosting recipe given with these cupcakes and my frosting was extremely runny. This recipe needs some tweaking.

This was a great version especially for a beginner like myself. I thought the cake a tad dry so maybe I will try to tweak that but overall 5 stars from me!

this turned out pretty good, baked it at 350 for 23 minutes, but should have baked it for 25 minutes.  It rose and then fell.  It wasn't that pretty looking, but it tasted really good the day after.  I did substitute the milk for buttermilk and added a tad less sugar.

Great recipe....but is this really what red velvet cake tastes like?  I made a recipe years ago with buttermilk and less cocoa and I ended throwing everything out because they tasted horrible.  These pretty much tasted like chocolate cake with a tangy icing.  I'll definitely make again.

This recipe was OK, but not what I expected red velvet to be. I wanted something to rival the cupcakes I buy at the bakery, and these weren't even close. The cream cheese icing tasted good but it wouldn't hold it's shape once I piped it onto the cupcake.

This was so delicious and I made a cake instead of cupcakes but I found the cream cheese frosting to be too sweet so I added another 3/4 of a 8 oz box of cream cheese into the mix and it was good. I think next time I will just use half of the box of the confectioner's sugar instead of the entire box.  But other than that everyone loved it!!!

I made these for my nine year old daughter's birthday. The frosting was a an absolute keeper. Outstanding! The cake I must say I little dry and I followed the directions. I like my cake a bit more moist. So I will have to try a modification next time. They looked so pretty. I did pipe the frosting on with adding frosting to a zip-lock bag and cutting the corner. I added a big rasberry to the top of each cupcake.

the batter might appear dubious at the start, but once the flour is added in its the perfect texture. i reduced the amount of sugar for both the batter and the frosting though, but they still turned out perfect!

the frosting is to die for, just that mine turn out to be a little watery, so i let it sit in the fridge before frosting the cupcakes. 

will definitely make these again!

The icing for this recipe did not work for me!  Even after putting in TWO ENTIRE 16 oz box of confectioners' sugar, it wouldn't set up.  I was left with a soupy liquid that promptly trickled off the tops of all my cupcakes.  I'm no stranger to making icings from scratch, so this epic failure came as a complete surprise.  I have no idea what went wrong!  Don't trust this recipe -you'd be better off making buttercream!

I just finished baking these as mini cupcakes. Halving the recipe made 4 dozen minis. I reduced the baking temp to 325 and they were perfect at 16-17 minutes. These cupcakes are TO DIE FOR. I can't stop eating them!

After crying on the first TWO recipes I tried this one came out PERFECT! It was much easier and less ingredients and steps. My husband said it was great! I don't care for red velvet so I can't judge on taste but My husband and daughter LOVED this taste and I LOVED making this one!

For any of you beginner cooks out there, this is a perfect dessert for you. When I made this recipe I just started and they came out delicious and moist. Just follow the recipe and you'll be fine. Though I didn't put the total amount of sugar required in the frosting just so they didn't become over sweet.

At long last my quest to find a deliciously simple and moist red velvet cupcake recipe is over!  I've tried five other recipes over the past year and was just about ready to give up, when I found this gem!  I followed the recipe exactly and am nothing less than ecstatic with the results. They're moist, not too dense, just chocolatety enough, and not too sweet-- and so easy to make!  (as a side note, I had *terrible* luck with the accompanying cream cheese frosting recipe-- horribly runny, impossible to pipe, too sweet-- use this recipe for the cupcakes, but look elsewhere for a cream cheese frosting)

I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews.  I made these exactly how it was suggested and they were bland, dense and dry.  The frosting was the saving grace.  Maybe I don't know a "proper" red velvet cupcake, but I like them to be moist, light and flavorful.  I wouldn't use this recipe again

It was okay, but it was sort of dry and wasn't really red, more like brownish.

This is by far the BEST RED VELVET CUPCAKE OR CAKE RECIPE ANYWHERE!!!  I first made them for Valentine's day.  They literally melt in your mouth and my children went absolutely crazy over them.  For my son's birthday this April, I made them into a cake.  UNBELIEVABLE!!  SEE THE PICTURE!  For St. Patricks day I colored them green and put green sprinkles on top.  I am not a huge chocolate fan, so I used a bit less cocoa powder, but some to give it that extra punch!  YOU SIMPLY CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS RECIPE!

My first batch had two cupcakes that their 'brain exploded' (the top blew up and went all over).  I was using a disher, so I knew that the portions were the same.   I have a Kitchenaid mixer, so tonight when I made them, I was sure to get the 'bottom' of the mixing bowl with a rubber spatula.  With this particular mixer, the bowl that comes with has a 1/2" recessed bottom that locks in to the mechanism.  This time, I was sure to mix that part of the batter back in to the rest of the mix.  32 cupcakes (high altitude).  Great recipe.

Oh my goodness! Yum, yum, yum and yum!! These are so good! I have only tries red velvet a handfull of times before and these were by far the best. So easy to make and I LOVED the frosting. I found that this recipe made more cupcakes than and said it did and thus, I needed a little more frosting. But other than that, they were perfect! I will be baking these again very soon!

This icing is fabulous!  Can't rate the cake because we ended up using the red velvet mix from a box (modified a bit by using 1/2 water it called for and 1/2 buttermilk).

Awesome!! I've made this recipe as both dairy free and by the recipe and it works wonderfully. Like another writer, I used tube color. SO much better as the tubes don't give the bitter taste of bottled color. This recipe held up as a cake I made a rocket ship a la "Wallace and Gromit" and the structure was absolutely perfect for the cake.

YUM! I decreased the flour to 2 1/4, added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar, doubled vanilla extract, made homemade buttermilk (milk+2tbsp LJ) everything else I left as is. The cake turned out so moist and good! The frosting is delicious, but I think I may have added too much butter so it came out sort of yellow. I also may cut back just a bit on the sugar and cream cheese next time. Still fabulous though..

Overall a very good recipe. I did feel, however, that that cupcakes were a little dry. I later made them again and added some oil and they were a little better. I eventually found a recipe elsewhere i liked much better.

These cupcakes were good--at first. The night I made them, they were so soft, moist and delicious...BUT the next day, they were dry and hard to swallow. I even brushed the tops with simple syrup, an old baker's trick to keep cakes soft.  Whatever happened between the time they were baked and the following day rendered them a 3-star cake as opposed to their 5 star status out of the oven (they were stored in airtight glade containers at room temp). I followed the recipe almost exactly-- The only modifications were decreasing the flour by 1/4 cup, which is supposed to moisten cakes, and putting in 3 tsp of vanilla, rather than 2 (not big modifications).  The frosting was a 2-3 star frosting, and it was not cake frosting. I followed the frosting recipe exactly. It was way too thin & I hadn't anymore confectioner's sugar to thicken it. 


I may make the cake recipe again, but next time might replace 1/2 the butter with oil, which will ensure long-term moistness, and sub some of the sugar for corn syrup, which also adds moisture. I will likely never make the icing again, unless it were to drizzle onto cinnamon buns, which is a more suitable application for a frosting this thin. Or add 1-2 more cups of confectioner's sugar, which would thicken it. It is disappointing, because the ingredients for this cake were expensive, and things I don't usually keep in the house (s. cream, cream cheese, food color).

Great red velvet cupcakes. Easy to bake and totally DELICIOUS! They are now my favorite cupcakes to make. The only thing I did was to reduce the flour by 1/4 cup, but that is my personal preference. I'm sure they'd be just as fantastic if one follows the recipe. I'd definitely recommend this recipe.

I made these for Valentine's Day and took them to work.  I'm not a big Red Velvet Cake fan, but everyone at work loved them.  I saved a few for my family because Red Velvet is my son's favorite and he gobbled them up.  They were pretty easy to make and looked very pretty.

Wonderful recipes, with a few tweaks. Added a little less flour, 1/4 C more sugar, doubled the vanilla, and I used soy milk because that's what I had. 

The icing recipe is also amazing, but in order to have firmer icing that didn't melt away when not in the fridge, I used 24 ounces of confectioners sugar (about 750 g)
I found that the icing recipe made too much for all the cupcakes. 
I also made mini cupcakes, as well as large cupcakes. The mini cupcakes baked perfectly at 11 minutes. The large at 21 minutes. 
I made 48 mini cupcakes and 24 large cupcakes from the recipe. It makes a ton! So good for valentines. Next time, I just won't add the red food colouring, and I'll have the most moist chocolate cake I've ever made.

Delicious! The first time I made these they came out perfect, but a little to chocolately to me. The second time I reduced the cocoa to 1/3 cup and increased the sugar to 2 1/4 which was a perfect balance to me.

These were great! I just made 5 dozen for school Valentine's parties and then 18 8" cakes for my Sparks (like Brownies) unit to decorate. I tried several suggestions and liked the substituions suggested by the Baby Bow Lady. The flavour and texture is great. I also used paste food colouring and just added both pink and red. They are gorgeous.

Best red velvet cupcakes I have ever had. 

I gave this four starts because I was not a huge fan of the icing. It was ok, but I think next time I'm just going to get a tub of cream cheese frosting at the store.

Fabulous with another reviewers change.  I made the sugar and flour 2 1/4 cups,  Perfect, rivals any good bakery.  I have been asked to bring these to two different parties and the frosting is to die for.  No changes there and it is good on carrot cake too.

These are delicious!  I made these for my husband because Red Velvet is his favorite kind of cake.  He gobbled them up!  Even I, who frankly in the past would have said I hated red velvet, loved them!  The chocolate flavor really combats the bitter taste you can sometimes get when you put that much red food coloring into a recipe.  I'll definitely be making these again.

Excellent. Made no adjustments whatsoever, but next time I might color the frosting pink for a Valentine's treat. Oh, 15 minutes was a bit too long because they burned on the edges, but it always depends on the oven. They tasted great a little burnt too!

The best red velvet I have ever had and made! These things stay moist and the icing stays fresh for weeks in the refrigerator.

The cupcakes and frosting came out great, everyone liked them. My only issues were: -the cupcake batter is very very thick, and the fine line between just blended and over blended is difficult to get to. -the frosting is kind of soupy, I wish it was a little fluffier, but still tastes amazing.

They were pretty good.  But I would add buttermilk  instead of milk for more moisture.  Also, a little  more vanilla (1 tsp) and sugar (1/4 cup)

Disclaimer: I have never had red velvet, so I can't compare to anything. My first batch, which is cooling right now, doesn't taste great at all. They taste like gummy chocolate cupcakes, but ones that don't have enough chocolate. It's almost flavorless, and also lacks a certain richness. Granted, I had to substitute, so I'm not completely blaming the recipe. Didn't have sour cream, so I useed nonfat yogurt. Couldn't use food color because of allergies, so that reduced juice from strawberries would work (didn't). The batter made me nervous, especially after I added the yogurt, and particularly after I added the juice (which exceeded the half ounce called for). The smell great while baking, and even looked nice upon removing from oven, but since they are sad, sunken pseudo-cupcakes. For my second batch, because I didn't want to toss the remaining batter, I placed frozen strawberry slices at the bottom of some, and mixed white chocolate chips with others. I plan to use a chocolate cream cheese frosting. I really hope the strawberry, chips, or frosting helps!

These were a little above average but they were too cakey (heavy) for cupcakes and dry.  They taste like my sweet grandma made these from a recipe that was 65 years old.

These are THE best cupcakes. I used 3 sticks of butter and then 2 1/2 cups of sugar and I used butter milk  1 1/4 cup instead of sour cream and milk. frost them hot and Let the cupcake set for a few hours before you eat them. They are better than any cupcakery or bakery you have ever tasted red velvet from.    For the cream cheese frosting do this: about 1/4 stick of butter, 6 oz of cream cheese and about 8 oz of confectioners sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla extract mix until creamy.

FROSTING review only! I used this frosting on Pumpkin Spice Cupcakes and people went absolutely crazy for it!  I did add extra powdered sugar to make the icing thicker and easier to pipe.  Delicious and looked great with some Pumpkin Pie Spice sprinkled on top.

This Red Velvet Cupcake recipe is truly the best one to be found on the internet.  I scoured the internet and compared multiple recipes, and I found that this one truly gives the best foundation for a magnificent cupcake.  I prepared the recipe according to the directions with a few minor adjustments based on reviewers suggestions as follows: 2 cups flour, 2 1/4c sugar, NO MILK...1/2c oil instead and 2 bottles of food color, 3tsp. vanilla.  Also, 10oz cream cheese!  YUMMY...DIVINE

I made these cupcakes for a surprise bday party.  I followed the recipe exactly including the cream cheese frosting.  I wanted to have something in the middle though so I found a ganache recipe on this site and filled the cupcakes with chocolate ganache before frosting.  To top them off I addeded some red sugar crystals for decoration.  With no exaggeration, people were raving about the cupcakes and many said they were the best cupcake they ever had!  I definitely think the ganache was an added surprise everyone loved.

These are really delicious & moist!  I used low-fat cream cheese in the frosting & didn't use as much confectioners sugar (I don't like it too sugary) and they were just right.  My husband and I couldn't stop eating them ~ and our company enjoyed them as well.  A must try ~ you'll be happy you did.

These cakes were wonderful! I couldn't have asked for anything more. When you fill up the cupcake liners, you only really have to fill them up half way (not 2/3). That in mind, this recipe makes a couple more than the said 30 (not that I mind!). I highly reccomend this recipe!

This  is my first time making Red Velvet anything. I followed this recipe and these cupcakes were moist, and my family loved the. they were not to sweet, which for me is wonderful. I will be making these cupcakes again, and may also venture into making a cake some day.......

My daughter and I baked these together and they were so delicious. The icing is amazing, too. We'll definitely make these again. I didn't change anything.

I had never had red velvet cupcakes before and made them for judo students for valentines day.  They loved them, but I think I prefer regular chocolate.  They just tasted a little off to me.  I followed the recipe exactly.

EDIT: So, I need to update my review because my boyfriend's father FLIPPED for these, saying they were the best cupcakes he's ever had. So maybe I was too harsh of a judge :)

The icing comes out a bit too liquidy, had to add in more confectioners' sugar and even that it was still difficult to apply to the cupcakes. The cake part seemed a bit dry, next time I will cook even less.

I am only rating the CAKE, as I did not make the icing.  The batter came out really thick - like REALLY thick.  I halved the recipe and left out about 1/4 C of the flour mixture.  I am glad I did this because I think that helped to get a moister cake.  I also used Splenda. I have no idea what red velvet should actually taste like - this kinda tasted chocolately but not like a regular chocolate cupcake would.  If I ever made these again I would personally ice with chocolate icing.  I am not a fan of cream cheese but maybe the reason Red Velvet is always iced with cream cheese frosting is because it goes well with this oddly somewhat chocolate cupcake?  What do I know :)

Thank you for a great recipe!  Cupcakes were very moist. I added 1 cup of mini morsels to recipe and followed other suggestion for less cocoa (add 1/4 cup).  Frosting was great!  I used 1 tsp. vanilla  w/a few mini morsels for decoration.  Everyone loved these.  I will make them again.  See photo...

I thought these cupcakes were pretty good, but not the best. They were much too sweet when frosted, for my tastes. I loved how they looked - just beautiful. The cream cheese frosting was easily piped onto the cupcakes though it hardly holds a shape (too soft, even without the sour cream added). I think these would be perfect for children based on the sweetness and the color appeal.

We made exactly as written here, no substitutions (except we opted to not use food coloring) in cupcake recipe or frosting recipe and it came out yummy, moist, fluffy and brown. The frosting was not very sweet either but then again, we all have different levels of sweetness preference. 

This is not my first time to make red velvet cupcakes but I wanted to try using sour cream as oppose to the buttermilk that I have been accustomed to using. 

This is also very easy to make as my almost 10 year old made it herself. Very pleased with this recipe.

I have been baking for over 30-years. I have attempted countless time to perfect cream cheese frosting. For the past decade, I just avoided cream cheese frosting altogether. Ladies and gentlemen, this IS it. I, personally did not try the cake. However, I served decorated versions of this recipe at a large gathering. EVERY ONE absolutely LOVED them. I received so much praise, I was embarrassed and left. I am praised on my baking efforts regularly and am proud of them so this give you a good idea of how crazy people were about them. I will make them again this weekend for my family. I followed the recipe without substitution and baked cake in oversized cupcake pans.

I made a few changes according to the reviews and it worked out pretty well! However, I did overdo it with the buttermilk but it did not turn out bad! Would make again, ONLY with the changes.

My first attempt at red velvet even though I have been baking for over 40 years. These were FANTASTIC!  Not sure where everyone else ran into problems, but the only thing I changed was the icing (a touch of half and half instead of the sour cream because I had run out).  Personally, I can do without the red dye, but these are a treat for someone else who loves red velvet.  Will make these again. Moist, delicious, melt in your mouth. I knocked a few minutes off the bake time because my oven runs hot, so you may want to check yours at 17 minutes instead of 20.

I definitely would add some buttermilk to this recipe to add moisture to the cupcakes -they are a tad dry, Also, be sure to use a stand - alone mixer to beat the frosting because it takes awhile.

Fantastic!  Made these to take to a party and they got raves.  I made these as mini cupcakes, and it made 6 dozen (baked the mini's for 9 minutes).  I used the frosting also as filling, so I doubled the frosting recipe so I'd have enough to fill and frost.  The double recipe was the perfect amount.  Wouldn't change a thing.

This was my first attempt. It is moist and fluffy! I used the Wilton tasteless red food gel. I added the color gradually which resulted in over mixing the batter, which made the tops flat after taking them out of the oven, though it still turned out great. If you use the gel and want the deep red I recommend using the entire 1 oz and mixing it with the sour cream before adding it to the batter. By mixing it with the sour cream you are able to breakdown the concentrated gel and ensure there are no lumps before adding it to the batter!

I never saw the appeal of red velvet cake until I tried this recipe (for me, it was all color and no flavor) - but these cupcakes were phenomenal!  They actually had a nice chocolate flavor and were sooo moist.  I didn't realize the recipe was for 30 regular size cupcakes and ended up with 24 minis plus 12 massive regular cupcakes, way more than I wanted, and they still all got devoured at work.  The frosting was also very good - I had never used sour cream in frosting before but it was nice and creamy.

I made the recipe exactly as written and it is fabulous.  As a person who isn't crazy about chocolate desserts I didn't think the 1 cup of cocoa powder was too much.  This recipe is being saved.

These cupcakes are great! I made about 24 and between guests and my family they were gone in 2 days with great reviews all around!!!
An idea for a garnish is sprinkling crumbled brownie pieces on top. It looks nice and tastes even better! ;-D

my only complaint was they weren't red enough, more chocolatey looking than red. Moist and flavourful with delicious icing. Thanks

i added the buttermilk, more sugar, vanilla flavor, and decreased flour as suggested, decreased the cocoa powder and everyone raved about it.   I am not a chocolate cake fan and so it still tasted too chocolate to me maybe I will decrease the cocoa even more next time and increase the vanilla more.  definitely a keeper.

I didn't like it at all. The cupcake came out dry and tasteless. However, the frosting was quite tasteful. Maybe it's just my taste but I like cupcakes to be very moist, almost like a brownie. It looked pretty though...

This recipe is great! However, I did accidentally add more vanilla and sugar than the recipe asked, but I think I'll keep it that way, because they turned out wonderful. The frosting was the best I've had as well.

Giving this a 5 because they taste freaking awesome!! However, they are very chocolate tasting. I may have done something wrong but my icing was runny. But they were super tasty. Going to serve them tomorrow for a birthday surprise. I hope they are a hit. I will make them again but I won't serve them again as red velvet.

I live in Europe and used a very dark cocoa powder....no matter how much red food coloring I used, these cupcakes were still too dark. My cake dough was very red however, so how red should the dough be so that I can adjust this recipe to what is available in Germany. Great taste, I also took the tip from other comments and used butter milk.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I make these at work all the time - but usually as an 8" layer cake. Today one of the cooks said he tried it and if he could marry it, he would. It comes out wonderful every time. I don't make any changes to the recipe - EXCEPT I use Red Velvet Emulsion instead of red food coloring.

I tried this recipe today for the first time. It is good, but my cakes turned out rather dry. Possibly a measuring error on my part, but I will try the other reviewers suggestions next time to try and moisten the cake more. The icing is delicious.

Delicious! These are probably the best cupcakes I've ever made. They tasted so rich but so moist and I think that the sour cream is what makes it so moist. They were super easy to make and I got a lot of compliments! The frosting goes so well with it too! Overall a fantastic recipe!

I did cut the flour by about a 1/4 cup and used top shelf cocoa (I also only use organic and good quality dairy, but I'm not sure if that matters). I can't believe people gave this recipe anything less than 5 stars :/. The batter itself was so good, we couldn't stop eating it; and finished, they weren't too shabby either! Look no further for a go-to red velvet recipe. The buck stops here! I will be making this over and over and over again.

Although I changed the receipt for  mini cup cakes 15 , I had too much frosting and batter left even when I made 24 mini's.  However, the taste was excellent . I would make again but fudge some of ingredient amounts.

I made these cupcakes for my husband for Valentine's Day.  I made them almost exactly as written, except I used Neufchatel cheese because that was all I had on hand.  I don't see how the frosting could taste any better with full fat cream cheese.  I also used cake flour instead of all purpose flour.  These are very good and the frosting recipe is superb!  To get the best texture of cake, mix for the full 5 minutes as instructed to lighten the batter.  I used only 1/2 of the red food coloring, I felt it was red enough and I didn't want to end up with a "chemical" taste that can come from adding a lot of food coloring to certain foods.  Definitely will make these again!

I was really disappointed by these cupcakes, after reading some of these lovely reviews I was excited to try making these, but I am unhappy with the result. They have a strange bitter sour cream after taste and the frosting is very runny. These were probably the worst red velvet cupcakes that I have ever tasted and I don't plan on trying these cupcakes again. They are edible, not bad enough to throw out, but I would definitely not want to give these to people other than my family.

Used modification by "ReadingPenguin" on 1/12/13.  This recipe is a keeper.  I believe I am a good judge of authentic southern red velvet cake and this recipe is FOR REAL.  This recipe makes more than 2 dozen almost full cupcakes.  I had enough left over for a small cake in a loaf baking dish. I only had 2 muffin pans, otherwise likely could have made 30+ cupcakes. Batter seemed thinner than I am accustomed too, but I trusted the process.  The icing made a generous quantity to cover a thick coating on the 2 dozen cupcakes PLUS entirely coat all sides of the small loaf pan cake. My 16 yr old son requested Red Velvet cupcakes for his birthday party.  It was a joint bday party for 27 other friends at a local venue.  So I brought this recipe and another parent brought some store bought cupcakes.  I felt bad for my friend because the red velvet cupcakes disappeared within minutes with many of the kids made a point to seek me out and tell me how good the cupcakes were.  Anyone who is around 16 yr olds much knows this is rare to receive unsolicited feedback!  I didn't even get to eat a cupcake.  I did taste the small loaf cake once I got back home and it was moist, delicious, and now added to my recipe collection.

These were pretty good. I have had better but these were the best I have baked. Instead of using the frosting listed I used Italian meringue buttercream.

Made a smaller batch of these and they came out great!  I might try some of the suggested modifications just to see how much better they can be, but this is a great, basic recipe.

This recipe with a few modifications is great. The cupcakes were moist and fluffy… Not too sweet (which I prefer).  For starters, I used a combination of buttermilk and sour cream; secondly I folded in the usual soda and vinegar mix commonly called for in RVC… ("Colored" with beets or food coloring.) Generally, I add a little extra cacao (dark and unsweetened) which renders a richer tasting cake.

These were awesome!  I've never made red velvet cupcakes or cake before.  I followed everything exactly for the most part and these were amazing.  Very moist and flavorful.  I thought the red cake looked a little burnt orangish/pink.  I followed another reviewer's tip and put in a couple of drops of blue.  It made a minimal change but the cake came out darker that I thought it would and was a really nice color.  The frosting was my own mistake.  I had a 2 pound bag of powdered sugar and I tried to put in half but it was hard to judge.  So, my frosting wasn't sweet enough.  I caught the mistake midway through icing the cupcakes and added more.  The frosting was delicious though - I just need to be more careful and precise.  I should have measured it our.

I have gotten several requests to make these again at work.  I made regular sized cupcakes at first but it wasn't enough, so last night I did the mini cupcakes and it made about 76 of them. The cook time was surprisingly the same.  Fantastic recipe!!  Thanks!!!

The recipe for the batter was fantastic! I will definitely use it again. Based on what I had in my fridge, I used almond milk instead of regular milk and plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and they still turned out great. Still, I did not care for the recipe for the icing. While it tasted delicious, it was way too runny and only made about half the amount needed for the number of cupcakes recipe for the batter yielded. I'll definitely try a different icing recipe in the future and will likely double it.

I halved the recipe as I wanted to try out a small batch just to make sure it is really good. I am really happy with how the cupcakes turned out however the icing was a bit too sweet for me so I cut down on the sugar. My advice is not to dump all the sugar in but to mix in half and then taste it after it is well combined. You can then add on more sugar if its not sweet enough for you. Overall I am really happy with this recipe. It was moist, fluffy and chocolatey !

Like many others, the first time I made this recipe, it didn't turn out good - too heavy and not enough flavour. I made this again with some changes - 1/4 c. less flour, 1/4 c. more sugar, 2 TB more cocoa powder, use buttermilk instead of regular milk, add in egg yolks first before adding whipped egg whites - and it came out MUCH better! I'm planning on making these now for my son's Christmas party at school :)

I used this cream cheese frosting recipe on my Red velvet cake recipe and everyone raved about it :) I used mandarine juice to make the sour cream; and there was a hint of mandarine in the frosting; which everyone loved ;) Didn't stop making the recipe although I realized I was out of lemon juice or vinegar,  so went ahead with mandarine :)

not bad but not great... i honestly didn't get a hint of the red velvet taste.the only reason that i feel this recipe deserves 3 stars is because the cream cheese frosting was great. i guess i have to continue searching for an actual red velvet recipe. :(

I made these for my boyfriend (red velvet fanatic) and we both loved them!!! I didn't make the icing (I wasn't brave enough..I've had some terrible experiences making icing..but I may try next time since I know the cupcake itself was amazing) As other reviewers have mentioned, the recipe does make a lot of batter, so next time I will cut the recipe in half.

Super moist and delicious cakes! I love the sour cream in the frosting! NOTE: Be really careful to not over-mix. I did once time, not thinking it would be a big deal, and they turned out light & fluffy instead of dense and rich. Mix as little as you can get away with, it makes a big difference.

These were good. I made the recipe exactly except used soymilk instead of regular milk, and light sour cream instead of regular. They were just a little too dry. I had to keep drinking water while I was eating them or I would get choked up.

Too much cocoa powder, you can really taste it. Red Velvet is supposed to be dense and savory, and a smooth top much like corn bread, this was like the stuff you buy in the grocery store.

Extremely delicious! Just an FYI, I know this is a cupcake recipe, but do not attempt to make this into a layer cake (I think it would make a sheet cake with no problem) because the icing is not stiff enough to hold up the layers, also the cake is a bit crumbly so you basically end up with a big mess.

My teenager has tried many different Red Velvet recipes trying to find a great homemade version. With much disappointment I'm afraid. I decided to look here first since I haven't been disappointed yet by a recipe in part due to all the great reviews people leave. We tried this one last night and loved it. Great taste, texture, moist, and terrific color. I just couldn't understand why other recipes were only using a few TSPS of Cocoa! We thought 1/2 cup was perfect.

I should have read through the reviews and did what The-Baby-Bow-Lady did.... The recipe is very dry.  I made it for a co-worker's birthday and am so embarassed to even bring it in!  I'm hoping everyone will over look it, 'cause I feel like I need to bring in something else to make up for a dry cupcake.  :(

I make this one with one substitution- my personal gluten free mix for the flour. Noone can tell the difference. These are fantastic, moist, fluffy and short-lived....

For a st Patrick's day treat instead of using red food coloring you could use green to make green velvet cupcakes!

I followed this recipe exactly and I agree with the people who said that the frosting is what makes the cupcake. The frosting is excellent but the cake part is so so. It is bland and slightly dry.

I rarely review any recipe, but this one I just had to! Made them last night for valentine's day party at my daughter's preschool. These came out awesome!!! Rich,moist,velvety-delicious. My husband who never gives his seal of approval the first time for anything new that I try couldn't stop after one ! He said these taste like they came out from a fancy bakery ..even for someone who never likes frosting he licked spoonfuls of frosting!!! Like other reviewers, I also reduced the flour to 2 and 1/4 and used regular milk with 2 tsp of lemon juice. Also, I reduced the cocoa to only 1/4 as i do not wanted it to be too chocolaty. For the frosting I did not use the entire box of confectioner sugar as we don't like it too sweet..i used only 2 cups and it was perfect ! My 4 year old could not stop raving about it!!! Hope every one at her school loves them as much as we did.

Thank you so much for a great recipe. I've never baked cupcakes before so glad I came across this one I'll be making them again sometime soon for sure !!!

Just made these cupcakes and they were super dry. Used full fat sour cream and whole milk too. Very disappointing as I made a double batch!

I just made these red velvet cupcakes last night and they were really good!! I followed the modifications of other reviewers. I only did 2 1/4 cups of flour, 2 1/2 cups of sugar (and I test tasted it), I used 3/4 cup of buttermilk instead of regular milk, 4 teaspoons of vanilla, and I only used 1/2 bottle of a 1oz red food coloring bottle because it tends to overpower the taste of the cake. 

I didn't add the dry ingredients w/ the wet ones until my cupcake pans were lined & the stove was pre-heated. And I cooked at 325 degrees! Also, when I added the eggs I took one reviewers advice and added the yolks 1 at a time and separated the egg whites. I whipped the egg whites in a bowl until they were frothy kinda and after I mixed the dry & wet I added the egg whites last. 

I really didn't need an electric mixer. I beat it w/ a paddle spoon because my goal was not to over beat too. But I put these in there for about 30 min (low heat) and kept checking w/ a fork every 5-7 min after they had been in there for like 18 minutes. Don't wait until the fork is super clean, take them out even when there are a few specks of cake on fork. I used this buttercream recipe- 4 cups powdered sugar, 4-5 tbsp of coffee cream, 1 cup of salted butter, & 3 tsp of vanilla. These were heavenly man, my sisters kept saying his name in vain! I found the icing on Pinterest. Man.....it is crazy good...best in my life and I know icing man! 

It's the next morning and the cupcakes are still super moist!

This was my first shot at Red Velvet & they turned out awesome! The recipe was very easy. Cupcakes came out super delicious & moist. The only thing I did differently was add almond extract & a little butter extract. I also did mini cupcakes (made 96!!!) & only  baked for 16 minutes. The frosting was delicious as well. This is a definite keeper!

I've baked this twice now - once as cupcakes and once as an 8x8 cake. Both times, I got rave reviews! It's a very light and fluffy cake so if you like a denser cake, this recipe is not for you. I followed the instructions except for lowering the sugar to 1.5 cups and everything came out great. Last night, while baking the cake version, I added cold milk as the last liquid  to everything else that I let sit out for a while and the whole batter separated! However, I progressed forward and it came out fine. So make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature. The icing is great! I only used about 1.5 cups of sugar as I don't like sweet icing and it came out great. Definitely a keeper!

I totally disagree with The-Baby-Bow-Lady's review. I thought this was a fantastic recipe and would not change a thing. The cake was thick and rich without being dry or crumbly. I even adjusted the servings and it still worked great. Super delicious and totally changed my opinion of red velvet cake.

I followed this exactly as the instructions said. I found that the cupcakes were a bit too dense and not quite sweet enough. The icing wasn't bad, but the cream cheese flavor wasn't as strong as what I would have liked. These aren't bad cupcakes, but I was expecting more from them.

These were very good after I modified the recipe a bit. I used half the amount of cocoa powder, the first time I made it it was too chocolate-y for red velvet. added an additional 1/4 cup of flour and used brown sugar instead of white. I'd given both this recipe and my modified one for someone to sample (I'd never made it before) to choose between for a batch of cupcakes and they chose my modified one:)

I've tried a lot of recipes on this site and never felt compelled to write a review. These cupcakes were so delicious though, I felt like it's my duty to rave about them. Made it according to the directions except I used another brand of food coloring because I couldn't find the McCormick ones; they came out perfectly moist and the frosting was to die for! Took it to the rink and my friends LOVED it. I did notice that the red color darkened into a brown on the next day but maybe that's just because of the coloring that I was using. Might try gel coloring next time.

The cupcakes taste a little bland but not too bad. However, the frosting is runny and tastes nasty! I even made the frosting twice 'cause I thought I must have done something wrong the first time, but both came out the same. Definitely won't use this recipe again.

Recipe turned out alright. I thought it'd be a tad bland, so I doubled up on the cocoa. I also skipped the sour cream since I didn't have any on hand. It ended up tasting a bit like a brownie. Overall it was well received!

After reading the first review, I wasn't sure about this recipe.  I went ahead and made it, following the recipe, (maybe adding a little more or less of something because I am not a measurer,) but these are delicious.  I have not even made the icing yet, and I am rating these five stars.  I plan to make cream cheese icing, but since I don't use a recipe and won't be following this one, I feel I can't really rate that.  Excellent cake though!  Absolutely adding to my arsenal of cupcake bliss!

Used this recipe for my first ever Red Velvet cake, DELICIOUS!! I made a practice batch last night in preparation for making them for a coworker's birthday, they were a huge hit. I did not frost them all because the frostiing has to be refrigerated, and my husband and brother in law were eating them plain, still great. They are moist and chocolatey and the perfect red color. My only thought is substituting the food color with Wilton no taste red or the Americolor version if I could figure out the conversion. Once baked the aftertaste doesn't seem to be as much of a problem, but the batter (when I licked my fingers) had a nasty aftertaste. Just a thought, and I like those brands better anyway.

I thought this recipe was good in the sense that the cake was moist and quote good, but calling it Red Velvet is a misnomer. While the cake has a reddish coloring, it doesn't have the taste of actual red velvet and is missing many of the ingredients to make it so. I wouldn't make this again.

I only made 2 changes, I used 1/4 cup of cocoa, and 2 1/4 cups of flour. The result was very moist and rich! There was plenty of chocolate. I baked in 2 9 inch pans for about 35 min. I used a different cream cheese frosting. 1 pkg cr. cheese, 1 cube butter, 3 3/4 cups conf. sugar, & 3 tsps vanilla. This is now my favorite cake!

This is such a delicious red velvet cake recipe. I used it as a starting point for red velvet cake pops. My husband, who generally does not like cake, was ecstatic about this. Just the right amount of chocolate. Plenty of flavor! Moist, dark red, and delicious! I will never use another recipe for red velvet. Thanks McCormick!

This is a good recipe. Came out better the second time I tried it. I followed the instructions exactly except I did not have sour cream so I added half a cup of cottage cheese and 1 cup of milk and for the frosting added two tbs of thick yogurt. Cupcakes came out soft and light. I did not add as much sugar in the frosting as called for but the frosting still came out tasty.

These were very tasty and everyone I served them to liked them. I gave three stars because they didn't really rise up as you would expect and the cake itself was very dense, though the taste was very rich and velvety.  I halfed the recipe but there was nowhere near enough icing for 15 cupcakes. Also because of the vanilla (I did not use the suggested brand so that could be why) the icing had a brownish colour instead of being white. Overall the flavour of theicing was great but I did add extra cream cheese and sugar to make more of it. Though I liked the taste I'm not sure about the texture. Not sure I would make again. Also, no fault of the recipe, mine did not look anywhere near as nice as the pictures. I have never made cupcakes before and icing them is a lot harder than it looks ha ha!!!!!

This is the best red velvet cake recipe I have found. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect!! To many times I have made red velvet and it has come out dry but this one was perfect and moist!! Even my husband who is not a big cake fan loved these cupcakes.

Love it...my only issue which was my fault. I reduced the amount of cupcakes to bake which really through off all the measurements and made it more difficult. Other than that they came out great.

These cupcakes were absolutely delicious. I made them for my friend's birthday, and it got rave reviews from everyone, even from my roommate who snuck a cupcake before I administered the frosting! The frosting itself is very sweet (and probably my favorite part of this recipe), but it compliments the more mild-tasting cupcake, which was a bit dense, very well. All I had was an organic cocoa powder, but that turned out fine. The raw batter tasted chocolatey, but the final product was still delicious. Using an electric mixer definitely helps the process along quicker. The only thing I'm a bit disappointed about is the fact that I didn't leave more to eat for myself!

The frosting was excellent and saved the cake, which tasted rather bland. I would have added more sugar. Without the frosting, the cake tastes plain and lacking sweetness. Everyone liked them but considering the high rating I expected a better tasting recipe.

This is the first cake I've ever made from scratch.  I'm starting to see what all the fuss is about over box mixes!  My friend and I did it up as a sheet cake (ran short on time); baked a little longer then stated and - it worked perfectly!!  Added a little more vanilla then called for (force of habit) - but otherwise this recipe is perfect just as it is.  Thanks for posting it!

The cupcakes came out very moist. They got rave reviews. Only issue was that the frosting was too soft at first, so I added some extra powered sugar and then it was great. Besides that, YUM!!!

Great even with a gluten free flour blend.  I recommend adjusting the amount of confectioner's sugar to accomodate how sweet you like the frosting.  Excellent recipe!

Surprisingly moist and you can taste the hint of cocoa. I reduced the recipe to 18 cupcakes because 30 seemed excessive. I wasn't sure what 5/8 of a 1oz bottle of food coloring was so I just added as much as I saw fit and they turned out great!

This recipe is perfect!  I've made these cupcakes a few times and everyone has raved about them!  I followed the recipe as is, except one time I didn't have sour cream, so instead used about a half cup of heavy whipping cream and still turned out great!  I always make the jumbo cupcakes, which this recipes makes about 10-12 (obviously a little more cooking time but that's the only change).  And the icing is to die for...

i find this recipe mediocre at best.  The cooking time for these cupcakes are way off. (Although, in all fairness, it could be my oven). 20-25 minutes= burnt cupcakes.  10-15 minutes makes more sense.  It may have come out better if got them out of my oven a bit sooner or cooked them at 325 degrees.  I also find this recipe a little too sweet for red velvet.  I reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cups and still found it too sweet.  I would probably try it again with a few changes to the sugar amounts and cooking time.

I liked the ease of this recipe, but I think using the sour cream instead of the traditional buttermilk and vinegar left my cakes lacking a little part of the twang that is red velvet cake.  Instead it tasted more like chocolate cake with a lot of red dye.

The icing on the other hand was wonderful and why I gave this such a high rating.  It was a little thin, but so yummy tasting I didn't even mind!

Very good cake recipe. I was worried after reading other reviews that they would be on the dry side so i added one more egg white and substituted for cake flower and they came out perfectly!

Made these today for a weekend gathering. A bit messy to make and unfortunately the all crowns fell before the cupcakes were done. :( They turned out very moist though. I thought the frosting was too sweet and the powdered sugar overwhelmed the cream cheese flavor even though I used only about 13 oz. of the sugar. Probably won't make these again.

Where did I go wrong.....I followed the recipe exactly. Even opened up a brand new can of baking powder. I ended up with 28 flat, greasy red cupcakes.  :( On the positive side, the color was great. Maybe 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of sour cream is too much??

Maybe I don't know what a true Red Velvet cupcake/cake tastes like (I've only tried them twice before) but they seemed a bit flavorless.  However, the cupcakes were nice and moist w/o falling apart (baked for 20mins).  And the frosting is excellent, very fluffy & tastes really good!

The cupcakes came out great. Excellent flavor and texture. I pulled them out of the oven after 19 minutes. I am at about 5,000 feet elevation. Flavor of the frosting was good, but it was too soft in my opinion. Maybe adding more cream cheese and / or butter would be an improvement?

I love this recipe. This is the first time I have baked  anything from scratch and it turned out perfect. I followed recipe as is. Ended up with 32 cupcakes that were all gone in less than 24 hours. Awesome recipe!!!

I followed the recipe to the tee. It was DELIIIIISH!! I wouldn't change nor adjust in the future, and i'll definitely bake this again, on special occasion, like today, Christmas day! :-) I baked the night before, and it was delisious. It was moist & just perfect. I thought the frosting would change this perfect red velvet cupcakes, but it didn't. I made the frosting in the morning (so the cupcake would be cooled Completely). I usually give 4 stars IF i like it, and I give 5 stars cuz this was perfect! Thanks for the recipe. Everyone luved it!! :-)

I made these cupcake today and they were fabulous! I got rave reviews from a 4 year old so you know they're good! They were very moist. A few us enjoyed it so much that we ate a few without the frosting (which is also delicious). My only complaint was that the frosting was too sweet for my taste, so I added more cream cheese. If I did it again, I might add a little liqueur or lemon juice to cut the sweetness, but they were delicious and I will make them again!

These red velvet cupcakes are the best I've ever tasted. AMAZING. I made them for thanksgiving and people were seriously begging me to make more for Christmas, etc. NOW I did make a few changes. I read the reviews about dryness so I added a bit less flour, i used a little buttermilk (or milk and a little bit of vinegar) and i added a little sugar...ALSO don't overbake them. I should've baked them at 20 minutes but i did 25 and the outside dried out. But trust me they taste so good and with a few changes would be perfect!

This recipe is excellent!It allowed me to make a few modifications with great results!I didnt have any sour cream so i used unsweetened yoghurt but added 1 1/2 tsps of Real Lemon to it. I also didnt use the frosting indicated since i didnt have any cream cheese but instead i used caramel icing.It was delicious!
Thanks,McCormick!

I made 6 dozen of these for my nieces coming-home-from-the-hospital party - what a mistake. Followed the recipe to a "T" and was very disappointed. Cupcakes were flavorless and dry. Giving it 2 stars for the frosting, which was tasty. Removed from my Recipe Box.

I loved these cupcakes! I am obsessed with red velvet and these are amazing! 
They are really moist and stay like that for a long time! The only thing I did not love was the icing. Waaaayyy too sweet for my taste, so I would not recomend to put as much sugar as it says. 

Cheers!

I will use this recipe again but will have to adjust it quite a bit. I will probably reduce the sugar and butter and increase the cocoa powder. The frosting was pretty standard. Nothing special.

The icing for these cupcakes was seriously delicious. I left the icing in the refrigerator though until I was ready to have each/several brownies for my guests and me. The cupcakes were a bit more cakey than I really like, so next time I make these I will try to moisten them up a bit. Overall though, a delicious cupcake!

These turned out perfect! However, I did follow a couple of Baby Bow Tie Lady's modifications by adding a teaspoon more of vanilla extract and 1/4 cup less flour. Yum. :) I will definitely be making these again.

I loved this cake. It was so moist and dense, just the way I like it. However, the frosting was not good. I am NOT a fan of cream cheese frosting at all and that's probably why I didn't like it. So we just ate the cupcakes without frosting and they were good. I also sprinkled mini chocolate chips on the cupcakes that added a richness of chocolate to them. Next time I'll add more.

Overall this is a very good recipe. My favorite part was the cream cheese frosting!!! The only thing that could have made it better is if it would have been more moist. I was worried about the quanity of red food coloring because I have had a bad experience with using alot resulting in my dessert tasting bad. But it was totally fine, we couldn't taste it at all.

I'm not a fan of any red velvet I buy in the store or make out of a box, but these were really good! I wish I could figure out how to get the tops rounded instead of flat. I use real butter.. I thought that was the trick, but these did go flat. Regardless they tasted good.

I made these cupcakes yesterday and thought they were pretty good.  I halved the recipe to make 15 cupcakes, and it worked out.

When making the icing, I thought it would be enough, so I added a splash of milk (probably not even 1/8 of a cup) and then added more powdered sugar than called for.  I also wanted it thick enough to use a piping bag to put on the frosting, so I added more sugar for that reason as well.

All in all, they came out pretty good.  They aren't super chocolately, but do have a very nice flavor.  The icing has too much vanilla though--I'd probably use only 1/4 of what's required if I were making a full recipe.

I really really REALLY wanted to like this recipe......BUT. There is way too much sour cream in this. I prefer sweet cupcakes and these are ....tangy. Not my thing, sorry :(
Just want to add that the frosting is spot on though!

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out wonderful! Don't change a thing.  20 minutes was perfect unless you make bigger cupcakes, in which case you should knock it up to the 25 minute mark.  Just as described.  Love them!

These are so amazing, I cut the cupcake recipe in half (makes 12 regular size,) but kept the same amount of frosting, then I added frosting to the center of the batter and baked them. My BF even loves them and he hates sweets, he had four in one day!

AMAZING!!!! I liked this recipe better than my wedding cake! (Which was also red velvet). This recipe is delightful. It is simple to make and absolutely scrumptous! It goes perfect with the cream cheese frosting in the recipe too. I was going to use my regular one but im sure glad I used theirs :) The only thing I would do different (if anything) is add a tiny bit more sugar to the cake (of course, that could be because I only had 10oz powdered sugar for the frosting, so it wasn't super sweet.) Overall, this is wonderful!!!

These cupcakes were very good! I halfed the recipe and made 12 large cupcakes baked for 21mins. I also cut down the powdered sugar to a bit over 1.5 cups and used blue food coloring (blue velvet cupcakes!) instead of red. Besides those small changes, I followed the recipe to the tee and the cake was soft and moist and the frosting was rich and creamy!

The cupcakes came out quite tasty (though I used a different cream cheese frosting).  However, I added a little bit of vinegar to the batter (as was suggested by another reviewer - I had no buttermilk - and I'm pretty sure it was necessary for the cake to be moist enough), and there was a little too much cocoa powder in my opinion - the cupcakes taste more like chocolate cupcakes than red velvet.  That being said, there have so far been absolutely zero complaints other than what on earth we're going to do with all of the cupcakes I made.

This was wonderful.  The cupcake turned out very light, fluffy and moist.  The frosting was awesome.  I followed the recipe except for the amount of red food coloring -  I used 1/4 of what was called for because that was all I had on hand - it turned out fine.  This recipe is a keeper.

I made this recipes exactly as stated and the cupcakes came out dry. They still have a nice flavor, but I was bummed that they weren't as moist as I'm used to in a cupcake. I will possibly modify the recipe by using less flour and/or using buttermilk in place of some of the sour cream and milk, but I think there are better recipes out there that don't require a whole bottle of red food dye.

Turned out great!  1st time making cupcakes from scratch.  Followed the advice of those that modified the flour (2 1/4) and sugar (2 1/4).  Also added lemon to the sour cream.
Even my sister who I call "Martha Stewart" was impressed by my cupcakes!   Will make it again!

Cupcakes were a bit dry, even though I baked them for two minutes less than indicated.  Flavor was good, though.  Icing was very tasty, but only made enough to cover about half the cupcakes (which was okay, since I froze the other half of the cupcakes - this recipe makes a LOT!).

I made these for Valentine's day this year and they turned out perfect! I used to work at a bakery, so Ive eaten my share of cupcakes. I didn't make the frosting, I got lazy and just bought some at the store, so I don't know how that tastes.. but the cupcakes were moist and the perfect shade of red. 

I have a baby shower coming up and am going to experiment with making these blue. I have a different recipe I can use, but these were so good that I would rather make these again.

The actual cupcake part of this recipe was delicious. I used buttermilk instead of milk, per the suggestions below, but I don't think it made that great of an improvement (could just be my aversion to the smell of buttermilk). The icing was good but I don't think I added nearly enough powdered sugar (I just estimated by approximating the amount that was left in my 32 oz. bag). Knowing the equivalent, in cups, would probably have helped me.

Halved the recipe, added additional 1/2 cup applesauce, used 1/4 plain yogurt and 1/4 cup fat free milk instead of milk, and left out the food coloring.  Also used double vanilla as suggested and 1/4 cup organic pudding mix.   Used special dark baking choc instead of regular baking choc.   1/2 the frosting recipe as well, and just added enough powdered until I liked the consistency.  Husband and non-cupcake lover teenage daughter said best cupcakes they had ever had.  Thanks for the starter!

I don't believe this is a great recipe written as is.  It's too bland and dry.  Also, the cocoa powder over powers all the other flavors. Next time I will definitely alter measurements to see if it will come out more moist and flavorful.  Maybe less flour, less cocoa powder, use buttermilk in place of milk and maybe a little more sugar and vanilla. I'll also try baking one minute less. The frosting was really good though so I will keep that as is.

Just bought a KitchenAid mixer and this was my first recipe with the machine.  The cupcakes turned out GREAT (I used the suggested tweaks, less flour, more sugar and pudding mix in place of cocoa)!  I wouldn't mind a little sweeter frosting, but that's my taste. My b/f loved them, but questioned if they were too flat - shouldn't cupcakes be flat?

Excellent cake and icing! I didn't have sour cream so I used bittermilk instead but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The cake was moist and flavorful, the icing was creamy and sweet. I made a double layer cake instead of cupcakes and it worked just fine.

Only four stars because the cake wasn't red at all so I'd add more coloring next time. Also I'd make less frosting. It's good but too much for my preference. 

I will definitely make this again!

I think they were good. But my frosting was runny. I added more powdered sugar and mixed, nothing, added more cream cheese and mixed nothing. I think I would look for a different recipe next time.

I've tried a dozen of different red velvet recipes, and I can honestly say this is by far the best. I love that there is no vinegar added. The cupcakes came out fluffy and I couldn't ask for more.

These cupcakes came out very delicious (about 34 medium sized cupcakes) with a few modifications. The sour cream was a neat touch!  Everyone raved about how the frosting was the best part; made as directed and i put it in the fridge until i was ready to frost and the consistency was perfect, although it made more than i needed.  The modifications i used were cut the flour to 2 1/4 cups, increase the sugar to 2 1/4 cups, doubled the vanilla extract to 4 tsp and replaced the milk with buttermilk-all these helped the cupcakes to be very moist. The 1 ounce food coloring was perfect and they came out with a lovely red color. I will definitely make them again! Thanks!

I forgot to review these, shame on me!  I have not made cupcakes in years, and I do mean years, has never been a favorite thing to make. ANYWAY...I saw this recipe and thought I would give it a try. They were SUPERB!!  Yummy!  Moist and tasty..we really enjoyed them.  My sis had given me some silicone cupcake holders and that was a BIG mistake..had to dig the cakes out, but did not take away from the yummy taste.  Next time I will use the regular paper cups. I am tempted to throw those horrible things in the trash!!  So..hopefully I will make them again..I don't know why I never make cupcakes???  Umm..

Good cupcake. Very moist..a little greasy but texture was great. I only had dutch processed cocoa which is darker than regular..which altered the color of my red (burgundy) velvet cupcakes!!!

Wonderful cupcake. So light and moist, probably because I used buttermilk instead of sour cream. Needed to use up left over frozen buttermilk. Hubby said it was the best thing I've made. I even mixed some white choc bits in, but I think it tasted much better without it.

This is a great recipe for red velvet cupcakes. I only made a few changes to the original. The second time I made these I added a 1T lemon juice and buttermilk instead of milk! Watch the cooking time though. I cooked them for 17min and this was substantial!  Love this recipe!

The cupcake itself was really good, but we didn't like the frosting much (which is why I gave it 4 stars). I followed it exactly and it just didn't seem thick enough, but I would definitely use the cupcake recipe again.

Brilliant!!! Tried this for the first time last week and took them to a party and 4 different people asked me for the recipe. One tip is to make sure you dont overcook them as I did with the first batch and they were a bit dry. I took the rest out after approx. 18/19 min and they were gorgeous.

I followed this recipe to the T and the cupcakes were beautiful but they were extremely dry. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that the icing was pretty good and easy to make.

I used exactly the ingredients here, i don't know what went wrong.. my frosting was a bit soft which cannot stand in d cupcakes.. it's melting.. is there any remedy for this? but aside from frosting I like the red velvet.. it's my first time so it's ok that i encountered some prob.. i will figure it out how to make t right...  but still my friends enjoyed the cupcakes! :)

I followed this recipe to the letter with one exception: I added a little lemon juice to the 1/2 cup of milk to turn it into buttermilk. This was my attempt to combat the dryness that a lot of other reviewers complained about. I'm happy to say that it worked! They did turn out a bit browner than I'd liked though so next time I make them I will try cutting the coco powder in half. For that reason, I'm only giving it 4 stars. (It's RED velvet cake after all.) Overall though, they were delicious and the frosting was too.  *Someone complained that their frosting turned out gritty. I think they might have accidentally used granulated sugar instead of confectioners. My grandma always uses granulated and her frosting always tastes a bit gritty to me, no matter how much she beats/whips it.

These were okay. Didnt really taste or look like red velvet but it was good. I think I will keep searching. Excellent frosting but tastes like your regular cream cheese frosting only really runny...def not for piping!

Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe...you dont need to use a full ounce of colouring though!...5 drops would have been just enough. The first time i made this i used an ounce as the recipe calls for and the cupcakes were too dark almost brown in colour (the cocoa too ends up darkening the cupcake quite a bit)...its an awesome tasting recipe...i brought it into work and everyone thought it was storebought both by the presentation of the cream frosting & the taste!

I love chocolate but I agree with other reviewers that there was too much cocoa powder in this recipe. The frosting though is delicious but I cut the sugar in the cream cheese frosting by half.

This was excellent! I would change nothing however, my cupcakes didn't bake as red as the batter was which was a disappointment. They came out a more "dried blood" color.

I just made these last night, and they were perfection! The only change I made was adding 1/2 tsp. more of vanilla. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My batter wasn't runny, either. It was fluffy and able to be scooped into the muffin pan with an ice cream scoop cleanly and easily. The cupcakes turned out moist and delicious- even after sitting out all night! They tasted a lot like the red velvet cupcakes from Starbucks. And even better, the frosting tasted just like a sugary cheesecake. I loved it! I'll definitely be making these again.

Really good recipe! I decreased the flour and increased the sugar per other reviews. I also made a 2 tier cake instead of cupcakes. The cake was really moist, and the icing was delicious! I will def make this again! Oh and I didn't bake for 20-25 minutes. It was more like 17 minutes. Be careful not to overcook!

OMG!!! My search for the perfect Red Velvet Cake is over. The cupcake and frosting combination was perfect. It took every ounce of will power not to devour all the cupcakes myself. I shared with coworkers and they thought these cupcakes were heaven. I was unsure what kind of flour to use so I just used all-purpose flour. I didn't look at the recipe fully and realized while I was mixing that I didn't have any milk so I used buttermilk powder I had on hand. I used the same amount that the recipe called for milk. The end result= FABULOUS Red Velvet Cupcakes.

Loved these, although I would recommend putting the frosting on heavy like the picture shows.  The frosting is delicious!!

I used cake flour with the same proportions and it came out very nicely. I also used a lighter cream cheese frosting recipe. One person said it was better than the Dots (in Pasadena) red velvet cupcake.  Thanks!

Delicious! I made these last night and didn't deviate from the recipe one bit with the exception of using red food color paste instead of a bottle.   The cupcakes are divine!  My batch yielded 35 cupcakes and I had frosting left over even after heaping it on generously.  I'd always avoided Red Velvet thinking it was much more complicated than this.  I will make these often!

edited to add:

I made this recipe for my mom's birthday the other night but I didn't feel like fooling with individual cupcakes so I spooned the batter into cake pans.  I used (3) 9" pans and I had a BEAUTIFUL result.  The layers were nice and even and baked pretty quickly...probably 22-24 minutes for a clean toothpick.  I think I used closer to 1.5 boxes of confectioner's sugar for the frosting but it yielded enough to frost all 3 layers.  I already have people asking when I'm going to make another cake!

These cupcakes were fairly easy to make, and having never made cupcakes with sour cream in them before, i was a bit nervous as to how they would come out... i took them out of the oven and had perfect mahogany coloured cupcakes, and they tasted AMAZING!! Definitely give these a try, they taste so good :)

This review is actually for the frosting.  I didn't have enough time to make the cupcakes from scratch, so I used a mix.  The frosting was fantastic!  It didn't even matter that I didn't make the cupcakes from scratch because it was the frosting that totally made the cupcake DELICIOUS!  Thank you!

This is the best cupcakes I've ever made so far. I didn't have milk at the moment. I used canola oil instead. It came out very nice and moist. I will make it again.

Absolutely delicious. For those who said the cupcakes came out a bit dry then you did something wrong or left them in the oven too long. These cupcakes were moist and fluffy, by far the best red velvet cupcake recipe I have found. Keri was correct to suggest using only 2 cups of flour but 2 1/2 cups of sugar. Also, try throwing some melted white chocolate in with your frosting when mixing it up (about 4 - 6 oz. should do it). Absolutely awesome!

These cupcakes were light and fluffy and delicious!  I used cake flour and I only baked for 15 minutes.  Any longer and I think the cupcakes would have been quite dry.

Although these cupcakes were moist, they tasted nothing like red velvet.  Too much cocoa powder, therefore having to add way too much red food coloring (which can ruin the flavor)  If you want a real red velvet recipe, check out Paula Dean's.

So yummy! I have tried so many red velvet cake recipes and this one beats them all. Moist with the perfect amount of chocolate flavor. My only complaint is that they didn't puff over as nicely as I'd like

I recently baked this as a 3-layer cake for my daughter's birthday and it was a big hit! This was my first attempt. Everyone kept commenting on how moist the cake was. I doubled the icing recipe as recommended but only used 1/2 of the sugar and added a little bit of milk; I like my cream cheese frosting to really taste like cream cheese. Will definitely be baking this again!

These cupcakes were pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly. The cupcakes were done in 15 minutes and probably could have come out of the oven a little sooner. That may be part of the reason some of the reviews said they were a little dry. The icing is a good cream cheese icing. I'll make these again but might adjust the ingredients a little. Not bad overall and very easy to make.

Had a problem with the frosting.  Not sure why so many people say it's so good.  It was really loose even after adding more sugar.  I also only used 1 1/2 tbsp of cocoa.  Very moist, I liked the taste of the cake.  Just wish I knew what I did to the darn frosting!  I never, ever have any luck with cream cheese frosting.

These cupcakes are absolutely fantastic!!!!!!!!! I gave them to all the members of my swim team and they went nuts over them. Even at 13 years old these were simple to make and even better to eat. I was thrilled to find a recipe that didn't require buttermilk (because I had none on hand) The icing was dynamite. I definitely will be making these again.

Let me just start by saying this was the best cream cheese frosting ever!! I added 1/4 cup oil to the batter at the suggestion of some other reviewers and the cupcakes came out very moist. Also, it only took 17 minutes for them to bake. I'm glad I checked early or they would have been way overdone at 25 minutes. I think the addition of mini chocolate chips would be good as well. A very good recipe!

I am by no means a master baker, i filled my cupcake papers too full and they kinda stuck to the pan, but that aside (which was my fault) these turned out AMAZING. I don't know what 'real' red velvet cake  tastes like, but I am absolutely in love with this recipe!! I made a half batch because i only had 14 cupcake papers, but they are so moist and wonderful... I have eaten 4 already. 2 before the frosting was even on them! YUM!! Thanks for sharing:)

AWESOME!  I made this for my Mom's birthday and everyone LOVED it!  So moist and yummy!  It made 24 cupcakes and 2 - 8 inch layers for a cake too!  I may cut the recipe in half next time, but it was excellent!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe. :)

Delicious!  The cupcakes came out so moist and amazingly (given all the sugar that goes into them) they were not overwhelmingly sweet as many cupcakes can be.  The color was spot on and the cream cheese frosting goes perfectly with the cake.  The only thing I noticed is that the cream cheese frosting recipe did not provide quite enough for the 30 cupcakes.  I will be more sparing with it when I make this recipe again.

followed recipe to a T and the result was sooooo yummy! Cupcake turned out really moist and the frosting was delicious. Not too sweet, that's how I like it.

Awesome recipe...no substitutions needed at all.  I tried another red velvet recipe from this site last night and it turned out really bad.  I was so excited when I tasted the first cupcake out and it was moist and delicious!  I will be using this recipe from now on.  =)

Really moist and good. I made this recipe but for six servings and filled out 12 mini muffin tins. I used a cream cheese frosting recipe from this website and it was great!

Recipe was very easy to follow. My cake turned out moist and had a complexity of texture. At first bite, it seems try, but gradually it develops a nice velvety mouthfeel. I didn't use the frosting recipe here, but the cake was well received.

This is a VERY good red velvet recipe, but it does need the icing to taste right, so only 4 stars.

This was delightful.  I did get a comment that these were a bit too chocolatey but I thought they were great.  The only other comment I have is that this made way more than 30 cupcakes for me. Of course, that's really just an added bonus.

Amazing cupcakes! I did not make the cream cheese frosting listed here but used my own. I made them for a bake sale at church and they were a hit. I will definitely make them again.

The frosting is definitely 5 stars, the cupcakes seem like they are missing a richness (maybe needs more cocoa and something to make them more moist).  I also would like to see a recipe of this using something natural for red color (I heard  you can use beets, but I have yet to find that recipe).  It does the job if you are specifically going for this Red Velvet thing, but it wasn't our favorite.  May try it again with some changes...

I'm not a fan of baking (because it never turns out right!), but even I managed not to ruin them.  They are great, and the sour cream added to the icing really freshens them.  They are perfect for Valentine's Day.

Didn't have sour cream as it is too expensive at my local store($2/4oz.)  Used yogurt instead and margarine in place of the butter.  They tasted moist and very chocolatey.  Will be making these again for Valentines day.

Not too difficult to make, very moist. I couldn't find food coloring so they're just plain brown cupcakes, they actually taste like regular chocolate cupcakes too though. I (accidentally) ran out of sour cream so didn't have any for the frosting so it came out completely runny. I tried to add more sugar but I don't think the frosting will sit on the cupcakes. Doesn't really taste the way I'd expected it to. It's a good recipe but not up to red velvet standards for me. (I'm comparing to the cheesecake factory so many thats unfair)

These were SO moist and delicious!!!! My edges on my cupcakes got a little hard, so I trimmed them off, this way it was 100% moist and soft without the hard edges and then iced them with the frosting. So goooood! I didn't frost all of them, for those who don't like frosting. Also, I only had (1) .25 oz bottle and so while the cake was NOT red it still had a nice color to it, almost like a chocolate cake, but different.

These are ridiculously good!  They're supremely easy to make, and the cream cheese frosting is -exactly- what I've been looking for.  Sooooo yummmmmy!!

These turned out delicious! I LOVE the cream cheese frosting it was delicious as well. The only problem I've found is finding red food coloring because I can only find it in a box of assorted colors not by itself.

I made this recipe because it was the only red velvet I came across that did not use buttermilk.  I also used to round cake pans instead of cupcakes.  The flavor was okay, not as rich and moist as other chocolate cakes I have made or had, but not bad.  I don't know that I will make it again, though, since I think it was just average.

This is my first review because this is the first recipe I've tried on this site that was successful. I made these for a Christmas Eve party and they were a hit! Recipe made plenty of cupcakes, I did run out of frosting but I liked a decent amount on my cupcakes. It was absolutely delicious! Can't wait to make these again.

These cupcakes were very good and a huge hit with my family and picky husband!  He LOVED them.  I gave it four stars because I didn't use the icing.  I used another recipe for a crusting cream cheese icing because I wanted to use a tip.

These came out okay. The cupcakes were moist but not sweet enough for my taste. The frosting helped though. Next time, Ill use one tsp of vanilla for the frosting instead of two.

This is by far the BEST cream cheese recipe I have yet to find on this site (or any other). It is for the true cream cheese lover and frosted over 30 cupcakes generously.  The red velvet was easy and delicious. Much easier than the southern red velvet (which has a totally different flavor) and is more difficult due to the vinegar combo to make it rise. I recommend this entire recipe over again, no changes.

These turned out PERFECT! I had to reduce the cooking time by 5 mins (probably because of the oven) but the tops were just slightly "crispy"- exactly the way I like them. Very moist. The frosting was the pefect complement. I'll definitely be making these for future occasions!

...Disappointed.  First time making red velvet cupcakes, and they were more like BROWN velvet cupcakes.  Perhaps it was the amount of unsweetened cocoa.  After the fact,  I saw looking required only two or three table spoons at most.  I added 4 oz of melted white chocolate to the frosting mix, sadly the only redeeming aspect of the cupcakes.

Used up two packs of cream cheese for my frosting cause one wasn't enough (i guess the size differs in each country).
Didn't use full bottle of color, used about 2 1/2teaspoond.
These cupcakes were amazing and a big hit to my customers

Wow are these delicious!  I took it a step further and filled them with the filling used in "Cream Filled Cupcakes by Grace W."  The cake itself was moist and velvety, not over  sweet and a good chocolate flavor.  You need to try this recipe and decide for yourself.  Thank you Grace for sharing a great recipe.

The cake recipe was delicious.  I added more confectioners sugar till I had really nice sturdy peaks. Followed the icing recipe initially and found it too runny.

They were delicious! They took about the time the recipe calls for and it was worth it! They were very good and the frosting made it even better. These are definitely a make-again! Definitely try this on a night you have  some time, because they do have to cool in order to put the frosting on, otherwise the cupcakes will crumble

These are cute and fun to make. The cream cheese icing tastes great but it's too thin to pipe or take on a design. I still added some extra touches to make them adorable.

I made these as gifts and ended up making them into mini-Bundt cakes. So good! I think next time I will try less flour and a touch more buttermilk (I used buttermilk instead of regular milk). They were a hit and I’ll make again.

These cupcakes were a hit at my office, i was surprised how much food dye the recipe called for but the color turned out a nice deep red. Keeping this recipe for future use!

I did a half recipe for my family for a birthday. Out of the oven cooled, the cupcakes were a little dry. The frosting was a little runny. The recipe could have used a little more cocoa.

Will make it again. Very moist and tasty. I personally liked it because it was not overly sweet.  Even my pickiest eater loved it. I did not modify the recipe at all.

These cupcakes are great, mine came out a little dense. I am pretty sure that I baked them for too long though. I did not like the icing ONLY because it was not thick enough to pipe onto the cupcake and it has to stay refrigerated or else it will melt.

Followed the advice of some reviewers by increasing the sugar. Too sweet for me. Think will stick to the recipe next round. Love the frosting.

Mine turned out light brown like chocolate, not red like the traditional red velvet.  The flavor is good, and the texture is spongy and nice...but seems like the recipes that use vinegar get the true red color better.

If I made changes it wouldn’t be a red velvet cupcake. Our son (38) declared 30 years ago if it didn’t have the cooked frosting it wasn’t a ‘real’ red velvet cupcake. So we always have the cooked frosting??!

These are absolutely awful. Extremely dense, not sweet, flavorless. Allrecipes is always my go to recipe website, but this is my first time making red velvet and I chose this recipe due to the high amount of good reviews and it was a major let down. I will not be more careful with choosing cake recipes. These were not fluffy like cake should be and were a major let down. I would suggest finding a different recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly and they came out perfect! I've never made a red velvet cake or cupcake, but thought I'd attempt to make the cupcakes for Christmas. They were a hit! Everyone raved about how good they were and requested I make them again next year, so this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I thought the recipe was good, but the time is not correct. I put my first batch in and switched at 10 mins, and by the time it reached the full 20 some of them were still gooey. I recommend putting the cupcakes in for 24-26 minutes to get the cooked all the way through.

They were delicious and moist but a bit pricey.  Great for a special occassion.  Substituted monk fruit for the sugar and sugar free frosting for some of the cupcakes and that worked out great to cut back on sugar.

Delicious!  Make sure to follow the recipe exactly, especially beating the butter at the beginning.  Also,  my bake time was closer to 17 min. than 20.  Just watch them.

I made adjustments to the recipe based on some of the comments such as reducing the flour. I still found this cupcake to be very chocolaty (I didn't reduce the cocoa), which isn't my preference but overall it tasted fine when I ate one  fresh out of the oven. I placed them in the fridge until I frosted them the next morning. The icing tasted fine but was way too runny  to make any pretty design that would stay firm. The icing literally would come out of the piping bag without me squeezing it before I even started to frost. It was quite messy to work with. As others mentioned, it's probably better off as a filling or if you're simply spreading it on top of your cupcake/cake. The icing was not too cheesy in flavour but my personal preference is the stronger cream cheese taste so I most likely will not try this recipe again.

This recipe was very easy to make. The first day the cupcakes were dry. The second day they became very moist. I would suggest making a day ahead to get that perfect cupcake. They tasted delicious. Before I was not a fan of red velvet but made it for a birthday. Frosting is very smooth and tasty too. I will surely make them again

These turned out to be okay. I was expecting more from reading such great reviews. Personally, too chocolatey for me. I will try to make them again and use a little less cocoa powder.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but the icing was a little too soft, I'm not sure if that's because I might hot have mixed it enough or something was a little off in my measurements but I would definitely try and make the icing so that it would be more firm. the cupcake itself turned out perfect, super soft but still cooked all the way through.

Amazing


5 stars for the recipe made with other reviewers recommendations noted below.  These turned out so incredibly moist and rich. They dont even need frosting and thats always my favorite part!
Will be going into my master cookbook.
We got 36 full size cupcakes. I was not as impressed with frosting, it screams sugar instead of cream cheese.
I made the following mods to the cake:
2&1/4 cups of CAKE flour 
2&1/4 cups of sugar
1 cup of Buttermilk instead of milk
2&1/2 tea vanilla
We omitted the food coloring as well. No one needs red dye ;)

Followed all of the directions including removing cakes from pans at 5 min
 Delicious!

This gave me 3.5 dozen cupcakes, and the cupcakes were soooo moist and fluffy! Some modifications to make the recipe better would be to add about 1/2 cup more milk to the batter, and an extra cup of confectioner's sugar to the icing :)

I made these as an anniversary treat for my husband. They turned out deliciously! I halved the recipe and made a dozen big cupcakes. I only had .3 oz of red food coloring, but that seemed to be plenty.

Loved this recipe! I ran out of sour cream so I used 3/4c sour cream and 1/4c buttermilk in the cake batter. I used almond extract in the frosting to keep it light in color. I’m moist & delicious!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly... I’m always looking for THE Red Velvet Cupcake recipe bc it’s so loved by my family & friends when I make it and always a request!?? BUT I was so disappointed and this is partly my fault bc I should have looked at the amt. of coco powder!!! 1/2 cup is WAY too much! It took away from the traditional flavor I love. 2-3 tbsp is enough maybe a tad more.... but idk it’s way to chocolate for a Red Velvet recipe. ???????

i made this recipe. i think using the whole bottle of red food dy e is a little excessive. Nice try mcCormick trying to get us to buy more of your products. Not buyin it.
I have made some red velvet cakes before and it only called for one teaspoon red food dye and it did the trick just as well.

Fantastic recipe! I followed the recipe using the modifications recommended in the comments, and substituted with buttermilk and cake flour, as well as increased the sugar and vanilla.  I also started checking the cupcakes at around 15 minutes, and most of them were done within 17.  Plan on making this a go-to recipe!

This turned out GREAT! I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe, and instead of using dairy milk I used almond milk. This make a ton of batter so I used the remaining to make at cake and I baked it at the same temperature for 40 mins. Turned out great!! This will definitely be my go to recipe for red velvet.

I followed the many recommendations and changed the following: 
For the cupcakes:  I increased the sugar by 1/4 cup,  milk by 1/2 cup and the vanilla by 1/2 teaspoon and then deceased the flour by 1/4 cup.The frosting I did as listed - Huge hit!!!

Great recipe. I followed a few suggestions and tweaked it a bit. I used 1 cup milk and added 1 tablespoon of vinegar to it to create buttermilk. I used 2.5 tsp vanilla extract and 2 1/4 cups of sugar in the batter. For the icing, I doubled it and only used 1 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar as I found this sweet enough. Instead of cupcakes, I made a cake. This will be a keeper.

These tasted fine, but we're definitely not the greatest. The frosting wasn't as tangy as a cream cheese frosting usually is, and the cupcakes weren't as flavorful as I'm used to.

Delicious and very light and fluffy.  They are amazing cupcakes.  I baked them for 17 minutes and at first, they looked like they had risen, but then they become flat.

Delicious cupcakes! I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and they were pretty much done after 15 mins of baking. If you omit the red food colouring, then you've also got yourself some fabulous chocolate cupcakes. Moist and fluffy texture with the right amount of cocoa - the icing was also perfect! For the icing, there's no need to add the full amount of confectioner's sugar, I usually just gradually add it into the mix and taste it to see whether it's enough.

This is a fantastic recipe! I didnt have any red food coloring at my house when I made the recipe so I substituted blue food coloring. They still came out looking (and tasting) very good. I made them for my moms birthday and one variation to the recipe that I made for an added bit of "fanciness" was I added Lindt Lindor Truffles inside of each cupcake. THAT. WAS. FANTASTIC. They added an extra bit of gooeyness without being overpowering. I used extra dark, dark, milk, and white chocolate truffles.

Absolutely amazing!!! I followed the cupcake directions exactly, and they turned out delicious. I don't personally like cream cheese icing, so I made a different whipped cream cream cheese icing.

I followed previous suggestions on modifications using buttermilk & cake flour. I just pulled the first batch out of the oven & they are as flat as a pancake! Taste is really good-not overly chocolatey. I’d make them again but try to fix the flatness. Guess I’ll just pile on the icing

This recipe worked out really well for us.  I used it for a dragon cake pan instead of cupcakes.  The only adjustment I made was to use 1 c. buttermilk and 1/2 c. sour cream instead of the 1/2 c. milk and 1 c. sour cream.  Everyone loved the cake.

I LOOOOOOVE THIS RECIPE! Both the frosting and the cake is delicious. Just perfect, the cake's sweetness is perfect but I think that the frosting recipe is too sweet. I only used about a little over half the confectioner's sugar and it came out great.
It takes quite an amount of time to make it but so worth it. Everyone I make it for loves it!

The frosting is DELICIOUS!!! The red velvet cupcake was just ok...I’m not a huge baker, but for the extra effort, I think I will just stick to box cake mix!

This is by far the best red velvet recipe I’ve encountered! Absolutely no modifications and the cupcakes were moist and flavorful.  It will forever be my go to recipe for red velvet.

This recipe has made my family happy! It was so fluffy and tasty. But my icing turned into yellow instead of a fluffy white. And the icing tasted kind of funny.

I followed the changes suggested by @cookinmama, i.e. to change the relevant parts of the recipe to 2 1/4 cup CAKE FLOUR (or "top flour"); 1 cup buttermilk (or milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice); and 2 & 1/2 tsp vanilla. (I chose to retain the level of sugar at 2 cups as I don't like my cupcakes too sweet.) The cupcakes were wonderful!! Garnered many praises, and I'm an amateur baker. The frosting was yummy but quite sweet so I might reduce the sugar next time. Also, if you live in a humid climate like I do (Singapore), note that the weather tends to dry the cupcakes out once stored overnight - best enjoyed fresh!!

Tasty cupcakes, I even made it into a Stranger Things cake.  Was a tad on the dry side though.  I substituted greek yogurt for sour cream so maybe that was why.

I made this recipe with a few alterations. First I used half butter half oil and I also increased the milk to a cup (I used buttermilk). Came out very good along with the frosting with a pinch of salt when I was mixing it up. I will be making again but I will add vinegar next time to the batter.

This recipe was really simple yet it tasted great! The frosting pairs really well with the cupcakes. I'm not really a big fan of sweet things but this was just amazing. It's also a great gift since it's so simple and easy to make.

This recipe came out amazing!  I boldly made it for the first time on Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it.  However, I cooked it at 325 for a few minutes longer than directed, as 350 tends to overbake baked goods (maybe that's just my oven though).  Would definitely recommend and will make this again!

I made this the way it is and don't have any complaints. One thing I did change was the amount of the red food color. I wanted more of the reddish brown and not the bright red. This was the perfect red velvet cupcake.

YUM!!!  I don't even really care for Red Velvet cake but my friend wanted them for her Birthday...I have to say, they were delicious!!  After I baked them, I brushed them with some simple syrup to keep them moist, I also doubled the icing recipe, so there would be enough for 24 cupcakes.

Great recipe, nice, not too sweet, fluffy and moist! I would double up on the cream cheese frosting though because the the recommended serving amounts only covered 60% of my cupcakes!

I've made red velvet once while I was in University and the red food coloring added a weird flavor. This time i searched for a natural alternative but didn't find one at my local grocery store, so i went without it, but the cupcakes were still yummy! 

I ended up using almond milk (since it's what i have in my fridge), 2 1/4 C All-purpose flour (also what I had in my pantry, didn't want to go out and buy cake flour), 2 1/4 cane sugar and the rest I kept true to the recipe posted. The batter made 36 cupcakes and I shared them with family, neighbors, and co-workers. The cake stayed very moist and the cream cheese frosting not super sweet (but may be for others...I have a sweet tooth) but goes very well with the cake. I might use this frosting recipe for a vegan chocolate cupcake for my sisters (she isn't vegan, just likes the cake recipe) bday coming up!

I have tried several red velvet recipes over the years and this is by far the best one ever. I like it because it's simple and uses ingredients we most likely already have in the house (who keeps buttermilk on hand). I doubled the batch for a party and they were amazing. I made no changes to the recipe. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

I made quite a few changes, which resulted in great cupcakes but also only a four-star rating on the original recipe. I like Allrecipes though simply because people comment on preferred changes, so I can gather the most common and adjust my recipe right from the get-go. For this recipe I made 2 1/4 cups cake flour (all purpose flour plus corn starch), used 2 1/4 cups sugar, 3 tsp. vanilla in the batter, half a tbsp. of cider vinegar in the milk, and a tsp. cider vinegar in the batter. Next time I will turn my over down about 10 degrees, because even with checking often I still had some dark bottoms. I also used a whole stick of butter rather than half for the frosting, just because the cream cheese frosting I normally make does and I wanted to stretch this (I always pipe a lot of frosting).

I wanted so badly to love this recipe but unfortunately I have found it tasteless. I will continue to look for a great red velvet cake. And I followed the recipe, changing nothing. Maybe that's where I went wrong.

I can't express how good this is!! It's so fluffy and it feels like it's melting inside your mouth. Also, the frosting was AMAZING. But I used less sugar in the frosting and a tiny bit less sugar in the cupcakes because I'm not a big fan of really sweet things.

Best cupcakes ever! I don't think I'd make any changes next time. This time I only had half the sour cream so I used half blended cottage cheese (1 c. - I made 2x recipe) mixed with a tablespoon lemon juice and 2 tablespoons milk.

Love this recipe as is -- I don't usually like making changes to recipes, I'd prefer to find a recipe I can use word-for-word, so I love this one! They always turn out moist and flavourful. Big fan :)

Made recipe as is because of how many great ratings it got. Honestly just good but not great. Definitely needed the vinegar, possibly more cocoa powder and sugar. Everyone keeps saying how good the frosting is. I wasn't a fan, in my opinion it didn't need the sour cream and too much butter made it too soft and not easy to pipe for decoration, it tastes okay but I like a stiffer frosting for decoration. Also the amount of butter in the frosting made it too buttery which means more sugar needs to be added to make it sweet and not so butter tasting. I would definitely use about half the butter and therefore need less sugar. 
I wrote this review day of when I tasted the cupcakes at room temperature, had then cold out of the refrigerator next day, they are a million times better...they get 4 stars instead of  3 when chilled. I still wish the frosting was thicker for star tip decor though.

I made these cupcakes with only a few modifications, due to reading previous reviews. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and I increased sugar to 2 1/4 cups. The cupcakes were very delicious and I plan on making them in the future whenever my family wants a special treat!!

I followed the recipe exactly and the cupcakes cakes out a bit dry and not very chocolaty. Loved the Cream Cheese frosting though.  Would decrease the recipe a bit to allow for 24 cupcakes, versus 30...less pans to dirty and 24 is plenty.

We love the frosting recipe.  It was perfect--not too sweet.   I did not use the recipe for the cake part because it asks for eggs and we are allergic to eggs.  I'm pretty sure though that it would have been great too, like the frosting.

I followed the recipe exactly as it is and it turned out fantastic. The cupcakes were so moist and just perfect. I didn't make the cream cheese frosting because I don't like sweet cheese, instead I made buttercream frosting and whipped cream, and I decorated them with fondant because I made them for Valentines day. So, this recipe is a keeper and I won't change a thing 'cause it's perfect as it is.

Followed the recipe exactly - cupcakes were a hit with the family and the youth group at church.   I thought the frosting was excellent and the cake itself very moist.  Everyone else said they were very good - moist but not quite as flavorful as they would like - not the best they ever had, but they would definately not refuse one!   :D

Mine came out with a beautiful texture. I used buttermilk and was extra careful not to over bake. May up the sugar and vanilla next time for a more vibrant flavor.

I usually hate cupcakes. They're dry and rely too heavily on frosting for flavor and moisture. These, however, break the mold. Super moist, the icing nicely complements the cupcake but doesn't overtake the flavor. Yes, it's 'cheating' as far as red velvet goes as it uses food coloring, but my red velvet snob family members cannot get enough of these!

It was second time trying this recipe for a cake stall and it was nothing less than Awesome !!!!! 
Loved the fluffiness and the yummy taste.

I have a doubt though, i used the Red gel paste Americolor and then used the mentioned quantity of Cocoa powder, for some reason, the redness was not shown, instead it was looking brownish with a slight red tinge, but nevertheless loved the outcome of the taste.

While having then cake in the oven, I decided to read some reviews which had me nervous for this cake.  I had read that the cake may come out dry.  Luckily, the cake did not come out dry and turned out perfectly as expected.  I did make the mistake of using store bought icing due to being in a hurry, but next time I make this cake, I'll make some icing from scratch.  All in all this is a great recipe, the flavor is on point, and the color is vibrant.

Oh, sooooo good! I used a bit less butter, waaay less sugar and no food coloring. Instead of food coloring, i threw handful of raspberries and they made it all red. Also, I used gluten-free flour (like buchwheat, oat flour and Pamela's baking mix flour). It turned out to be the most delicious gluten-free dessert I've made thus far! So moist, full of flavor! Both kids and adults enjoyed it. Even kids who do not need to be gluten-free and sometimes are even reluctant to try GF food. I will definitely make this again. It was so good, I had to write a review and this is my first one :)

Used buttermilk and increased to 3/4 cup and cocoa reduced to 1/3 cup.  With these changes the cake portion was very good.  However the frosting was extremely sweet.  I believe the ratio of sugar to cream cheese is off.  Will try to save it by adding more cream cheese.

Great recipe!  I substituted buttermilk for regular milk but other than that made it as stated. Loved the addition of the sour cream, both in the cake and in the frosting. These definitely had a lighter texture than other red velvet recipes, but that's why I liked it.  Mine did not come out dry at all, and in fact, the cupcakes were quite moist. Thanks for the great recipe - will definitely make again!

I made these for my daughter's birthday because it's her favorite cake. I did not change anything for the cake and it came out very yummy. For the frosting, I add 1/2 cup more confectioner sugar because 4 cups was a little too thin, didn't stand up well.  The frosting taste so good too.

Follow the directions to the TEE!! These are wonderful! They are dense and moist, have a great flavor. Use real ingredients, use whole milk, unsalted butter and butter that has been softened by sitting out (don't microwave your butter- it will ruin the texture of your cupcake).... It will turn out! They are not meant to be overwhelmingly sweet, they are just right. If you want a different frosting recipe is recommend one on here called "whipped cream cheese frosting" it's very light with the perfect sweetness.

My cupcakes came out tasting more like brownies- will have to retry the recipe one more time. The frosting recipe was a keeper though!

I made this cake for a party and the amount was just right.  I ran out of cupcake tins so just put it in a cake dish.  my family felt it was a little dry, so I would try to add in more sour cream next time and maybe a bit less flour.  The cream cheese frosting was very good.  Thank you for the recipe.  I had to find something that did not have any nuts in the recipe at all and this fit perfectly.

The cake was delicious. I had to substitute with GF flour & I used a different cream cheese recipe. Great cake, though.

The flavor of these cupcakes is excellent. However, I felt that the cake was a little dry. I added 1/8th a teaspoon of peppermint extract to the frosting which brought out the chocolate flavor wonderfully. The frosting recipe did not make enough to frost all of the cupcakes. By cutting the cake recipe in half I had 22 mini cupcakes.

This was my first ever recipe from scratch and I really liked it. The one thing that I thought was that there was too much salt. I could taste it. But other than that, family approved and will make again and again. This will be my go to recipe for red velvet.

This is my go to red velvet recipe. I have made this more time than I can count now both as cupcakes and as a cake. The finished texture is moist, airy and still dense enough to keep when icing it as a cake. This is the cupcake that is ALWAYS requested when I do parties!

I am very pleased to have come across this recipe. I did not use the cream cheese frosting because I have my own recipe, but the cupcakes themselves were wonderful. I followed the advice of other readers: change to 2 1/4 c. flour and 2 1/4 c. sugar.  The cooking time of 20 mins at 350 was perfect. This recipe made 32 medium size cupcakes. 
They were delicious and moist. We left them out for 10 hours during a family party and they didn't dry up at all in that time. I'll be using this recipe again!

More like Brown Velvet.  One ounce of red food coloring is not nearly enough to give it that vibrant red  color. Sadly, the taste was just ok for me. There is nothing spectacular about this cake. However, it did come out beautifully fluffy and light, not something I can say about many other cake recipes. I probably won't be making this one again.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written with the exception of substituting plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, which  I do in most recipes. The cupcakes were wonderful and not too sweet. The frosting was awesome! I made them for Valentine's Day and they were a real treat!

I had doubts about this before the baking of the cupcakes, because the batter was REALLY liquidy. But when they came out of the oven, they were perfectly moist and delicious! Just the right texture, too. I made my own cream cheese frosting, but now when I look back at this recipe, I think I should have made the frosting on it.

DELICIOUS!!!  Didn't have quite enough cocoa powder, so we used a little bit of nesquik to finish it off-worked out great.  We mixed the wet and dry ingredients by hand just until blended-that was definitely the key.  Melt in your mouth perfect cupcakes!

I used buttermilk instead of regular.. I also used cake flour and sifted all my dry ingredients twice. I highly recommend sifting.. the consistency of the cake itself was nice other than being a bit too oily.. may try it again and cut back a bit on the butter.  They were not red.. which I was a little disappointed in. .. but could have been a result of a much darker dutch processed cocoa that I used.  They simply looked chocolate.  May try again with Hershey's unsweetened cocoa and see if they don't look red... although 1/2 c. of cocoa is a lot more than I've ever used in other red velvet recipes.  I felt hopeful tasting the batter as it had the tanginess I was looking for.. but once baked, not so much. Still looking for the perfect one.

Here are the changes I made:  2 1/4 C cake flour, 1C buttermilk (I didn't have buttermilk so I used apple cider to milk/cream combo; I had to add more milk at the end because the batter was really thick - I just did that to texture), 2 1/4 C sugar, 3 tsp vanilla, baked at 325 for 14-20 minutes checking every 2 minutes with a skewer (pull them as soon as skewer comes out clean).  They are light as air and taste fantastic.  I actually cut the recipe in half and came out with 17 normal sized cupcakes.  The frosting is perfect.  WIll definately be making these again.

I'm only 12 and i made this for my brothers birthday and everyone loved it, it tasted delicious! i recommend you use vanilla icing if you don't have or don't like cream cheese icing.

These cupcakes were really tasty! I made them for a dinner party and everyone loved them. However, I give this recipe 4 stars for two reasons. The first reason is the amount of food coloring the recipe calls for. I bought one package of food coloring that only had a 0.5 ounce bottle of red coloring. That gave the cupcakes the beautiful rich red color you expect from red velvet cupcakes. I think the amount of food coloring this recipe calls for would make them way too dark. The second reason is the icing. The icing came out entirely too thin. I prefer to pipe on my icing but I couldn't get the icing to thicken up. I tried adding more powdered sugar but didn't want the sugar to overpower the taste of the cream cheese. Try making the icing without the milk, or less of it, that may help it to thicken up a bit. Overall a pretty good recipe! I would definitely make these again.

Very delicious and moist.  I made the recipe as written,  but will try some of the other reviewers' suggestions to see if it improves the texture and flavour.  I served these cupcakes as Christmas dessert and everyone loved them!

Followed the recipe exactly as it is written here, however my cupcakes turned out brown... they look like chocolate cupcakes instead of red velvet and I have no idea why.
The taste however is great, I will just have to 'sell' them as chocolate cupcakes instead of red velvet, which is a bit annoying as I wanted them to be red for Christmas.

The cake part came out perfect -- exactly the way I wanted it, moist and fluffy. The icing, not so much. It was waaay too runny. (Mind you i iced the cupcakes after they were completely cooled). I like piping my icing and this icing recipe would not let me do that.

If I could give 4 1/2 stars I would. The cupcakes themselves were great although the recipe said it would make 30 cupcakes. I made these for my class of 26 (Plus my teacher), and I just barely had 27 cupcakes. My last cupcake will probably be very small so I'll load that up with frosting. :) But, since there's only 27 cupcakes, none of my family members will be able to taste one. I will make these again, though. Great recipe!

It tasted really good but it didn't taste or look like red velvet cupcake. The colour was brown because of there was too much cocoa powder, and it also tasted more like chocolate cake. But I still enjoyed it!

After reading the reviewsI made many changes. I used cake flour adding the extra 2 tbsp. per cup of all purpose, 1 1/4 cups sour cream, 3/4 cup buttermilk, 1 1/2 cup fine baking sugar and 1/2 packed light brown sugar, added 1 tbsp of white vinegar mixed with the baking soda and stirred in at the very end, baked at 325.

No changes, this was the easiest recipe to make.   Basic ingredients so I only had to buy cream cheese and sour cream.   Sounds funny but it's amazing.   I would make this again. .. I am right now ;)

Light, fluffy and moist cupcakes.   I filled more than 3/4 of the liner and made only 24 cupcakes and they ended up having the muffin top looks...  Next time, I'll make sure to fill only 3/4 of the liner for better looking cupcakes.

I really didn't care for them. Moist was probably the only plus. The cake tastes 'off' and the frosting fest slimy in my mouth. Maybe I used too much food coloring, or didn't blend the cream cheese/butter enough for the frosting?

This is an awesome recipe! Great taste, super moist and dense cake, the perfect cupcake and cream cheese frosting.  I read reviews before I baked, and didn't over stir my batter once I added the dry ingredients and it turned out great.
The only change I made is that I used green food dye instead of red and made 'Green Velvet' Cupcakes, they were a very pretty dark green color and my friends loved them!

Yes, based on reviews.  Used buttermilk, used a little more (1/4 cup) sugar and 50% more vanilla. Keep the flour the same. I tried less flour based on reviews and they did not rise. These are the best tasting and moist red velvet cup cakes I ever had.

PERFECT recipe, followed exactly as is (maybe added a bit more vanilla to the frosting). Big hit every time I make them. Plus the recipe makes a TON of cupcakes, perfect for any event.

I use three quarters of the sugar as the frosting is sweet enough. I also reduce the sugar to three quarters there as well. This is personal taste as well as for reduced calories. This is a winner as I've made it several times and it's always a hit. Thank you very much for sharing.

Made it as the recipe listed and it was delicious!  Only changes were I baked it as a cake (2 9-inch) and I had to use Greek yogurt since I was out of sour cream.  Seriously delicious and everyone loved it.  not sure why people make so many changes to the recipe / we thought it was perfect!
The frosting was a good recipe too but seemed a little too thin to me / didn't affect the taste though!

I baked this for my family on 4th of July and they all loved it.  I had to keep myself away from the pan after they got out.  I am indefinitely going to make this recipe more

I made these cupcakes for my son's wedding. They were awesome.  They are very moist and they stay moist. We had some left over from the wedding and I used them to make a raspberry trifle which was great as well. I have made this recipe a number of times. Sometimes as is and sometimes with buttermilk. Very easy and always turns out!

I am new to baking and was suprised it called for sour cream. I am so happy i didn't doubt it and just went exactly by the directions. I made this for my birthday in July and even brought some to work. They were a HIT! Thank you for the recipe!

These were good! The cake itself was amazing, moist and delicious. The frosting was good but I struggled with the consistency, as it was drippy and gooey, rather than light and fluffy, which I was hoping for. That may just be the reality with cream cheese frosting but maybe others have tips for how to improve this going forward. Thank you for the recipe!

This is not a red velvet cake! i fallowed the instructions exactly and noticed how thick the batter was. it was almost like cookie dough. so i added 1/2 a cup of water and that fixed the moisture problem a bit. but it was still very plain and dry.

This cupcake is decadent!! I did use buttermilk instead of milk, which gives it a richer taste. The cake is moist and bursting with flavor. I did not use the icing recipe. I make a buttercream icing and add cream cheese which is SUPER yummy!!

I consider myself to be a great baker, and thought I'd give these a try. They were good, moist, but not overly flavourful. I'll admit, I'm generally not a huge fan of red velvet, but I did find these kind of non-descript, neither chocolatey or vanilla-y, just sort of bland. My family, whom I always test out recipes on, felt the same. I think if you have a "thing" for red velvet, these might do it for you, but they didn't for me.

These are so easy and delicious! Great texture, not too sweet, and were the perfect addition to our birthday party! The guests loved them! I'd never made red velvet cake before, and these made me look like a pro! Really enjoyed these and the buttercream frosting was great too. Will be using this recipe again!

This recipe turned out fabulous! I brought some for my coworkers yesterday and they are still talking about them.  I did not even have to alter anything for our high altitude for the cake. 

On the frosting I did end up needing to add a little milk because it was slightly thick at first.  I'm not a huge cream cheese frosting fan so I think next time I do the frosting I may add a little vanilla coffee creamer just to make it a little smoother.

My daughter made this even though I don't like Red Velvet cake - it's always seemed like just a cake with red color. Turned out to be so good, it was just what I needed after 3 hours of tennis. Perfectly yummy. The cake is not sweet and even the icing is not too sweet - and it has a slight tang to it. Super!

I scaled this down to 12 cupcakes for Father's Day and left out the food coloring. Even though I used the soy milk and nonfat vanilla yogurt I had on hand instead of milk and sour cream, the cupcakes were fluffy and moist. The frosting had the perfect consistency and taste and will be my go-to recipe now. The cake and frosting paired together were AMAZING. It was our first time eating red velvet cupcakes and we devoured these, esp my dad.

Made these cupcakes once before and had beautiful pictures of them. I'd forgotten which recipe I used and had been trying a few, trying to recreate the moist dense cake type taste with the cream cheese that was an excellent pairing. Finally decided to try this one, thank goodness. Managed to get the same rich, moist cake and the redness was just right. I used red colouring paste and just about 1/2 teaspoon. Also doubled the amount of vanilla. My baking time was about 18 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius. Made half the amount of cream cheese which was just enough for a dollop for each cupcake. I added the icing sugar bit by bit to the cream cheese mixture and found that I was okay with the sweetness by the time only half the icing sugar amount was added. - This may be an option for those who don't like their cheese too sweet or for some reason, are trying to be a little healthier. This recipe also turns out well for mini cupcakes (about 1 inch diameter) without losing the moistness. These baked for about 14 minutes.
Next time I will add some dessicated coconut to the frosting! Just a few flakes per cupcake should be yummy.

I did not care for this recipe. I turned this recipe into a cake (3 round cake pans).  It's a very heavy consistency and I'm guessing too much sour cream and not enough sugar.  Needs to be more moist too...it just wasn't good. Made a cream cheese frosting with southern comfort and we basically just ate the frosting.

This is my first time baking Red Velvet cakes.  I brought it to my neighborhood gathering.  It is a little too sweet for my taste, both the cupcakes and the frosting.  I actually used two packs of cream cheese for the frosting, and it was still plenty sweet to receive the compliments!  I will probably need to tweet this recipe a little for my own taste, but over all a great recipe!

Fantastic recipe. I only changed how much vanilla I used since that is a personal preference of mine. I like bold flavors so I always add more vanilla. This recipe is amazing and yielded 26 cupcakes for me!

This was first time making red velvet cake.  Instead of cupcakes, I made a 9" two layer cake.  Bake time was about 35 mins.  And I used my own buttercream frosting because I'm not a big fan of cream cheese frosting.  Was good, moist.  Will probably make again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and though I did like it and they were finished quickly,  I think something is missing to make this a 5 star cupcake. I will try more chocolate or greek yogurt next time, but overall a good recipe that will please.  I did not use the cream cheese frosting, as no one in my family likes this type of frosting, but did make a vanilla frosting (using granulated sugar, butter, vanilla, and a milk/flour mixture), and it complemented well.

These are just okay.  They look beautiful and I may use this recipe if I only needed "set dressing", but I don't think I will make this again becuase they were only okay...not bad, just no wow!  I selected this recipe because I couldn't find buttermilk to make a real red velvet.  My first clue should have been the amount of cocoa powder it requested...I normally only use about 2 Tbs, not 1/2 cup, they were also very dense like a poundcake but moist.  Once again not a bad thing but not what I look for in a red velvet cupcake.

So over all, it tasted average, was too dense and too much cocoa to be a good Red Velvet...but they were very pretty and stayed moist.

This might be good for someone just learning how to bake since it was very easy to follow and you could take your time making it.

I have made these cupcakes twice now, and I have had really great reviews. A word of caution - the original recipe makes 30 cupcakes. I made 1/3 the recipe and got 12 cupcakes, albeit I ended up with some weird measurements. I was a bit hesitant as the batter initially doesn't mix smoothly, however it comes together well for great finished product.

Wow! This is the first cupcake I've ever baked where I actually like the cake! For me, the cake is typically just a tool to carry frosting... I was careful to not over-bake the cupcakes and they were SO moist! I'll be making these again.

these cupcakes are great! at first I was worried that since I have a gluten intolerance, the gluten-free flour would dry out the cupcakes. but they were actually really moist and all around delicious.(also if you make the icing, DO NOT, I repeat *DO NOT* put too much milk in the frosting...otherwise it gets really runny and you will have to resort to dipping the cupcakes instead of icing them.

I don't get the red velvet hype however, it's my hunny's favorite. I had yet to find a decent recipe until now...thiis was a hit. I omitted the sour cream only because I forgot to buy it and I was on a time crunch, so I added a little more milk to make up for the lost moisture. Will definitely make again, WITH the sour cream next time! And if your cakes are coming out dry, you're over baking. These are very moist and delicious. I didn't have to bake the entire 20 minutes.

Second Batch review: made these at the boyfriend's house a few weeks after batch #1, and they came out SO MUCH BETTER. (I think my oven must burn a little hotter than it says it does, that might have affected the outcome of the moistness.) Revised review to 5-stars!



First Batch: This was a fantastic and easy recipe to follow. I ran out of food coloring, so I only used 1/4 of the recommendation, but even so it turned out great! I would only make half the icing because I ended up throwing out more than half of it! I had way too much icing left over! The cupcake itself I thought was slightly more on the dense/not-quite-as-moist as I'd like, but when I ate them at room temperature, it seemed to fare a little better. Regardless, everyone else that ate them really enjoyed them. I would make this again.

These were literally the best cupcakes I ever made! I used cake flour instead of all purpose and they came out really moist and tasty. This scratch recipe tasted just as good or better than the boxed version.

These were so good!  My family loved them! Followed the recipe exactly except I made only 24 cupcakes as I like a bigger cupcake, but still turned out great.  Had a request from my husband to make them once a month...

I made this red velvet cupcake recipe and I did not change a single item or measurement and it was delicious and moist. The cream cheese frosting was to die for. I made them for my family and friends for valentines day and they couldn't believe that it was from scratch. I would recommend this recipe 100% because I know that this recipe will be a keeper in my book.

Haven't frosted them yet, but they are the best red velvet cupcakes I have ever tasted!  I changed the recipe, not because i intended to, but because I had the ingredients for the traditional recipe.  So, instead of sour cream and milk, I used one and a half cups buttermilk instead of sour cream and milk.  YUM!  Moist, taste the cocoa, baked in the exact time recommended.  Great recipe....

I have never made a red-velvet cake and this one was so good! I put mine in a heart shaped cake pan for my bf for valentines day, a two layer cake. I made the frosting as well, so yummy. It was a a big cake so he took some to his buddies at work and they liked it too. a good red-velvet cake recipe :)

When you alter the recipe to fit a more..normal cupcake amount (24) it becomes a little bit weird to do all those weird measurements. But all in all the batter comes out quite nice and semi-thick. A perfect cupcake batter. Mine are in the oven right now, I can't wait until they come out.

These were a big hit with everyone! SUPER moist and the icing was amazing. I recommend using a high quality cocoa or more cocoa than the recipe calls for as I would've preferred a chocolatier taste to them. I also substituted the milk for buttermilk after reading other reviews. Also you don't have to skimp on the icing, it makes tons! I made 24 cupcakes and 16 minis and was able to pile the icing on.
One more thing to add... I only had blue food colouring, so I used that thinking I'd get blue cupcakes, but they turned green! ;) In case anyone else has the same bright idea in a pinch. Perfect green colour for St. Patty's Day or Halloween, though!

Made this recipe and a Paula Deen recipe and this one was by far the best!  Made changes that were suggested by others... 2 1/4 cups flour and sugar (decreased flour and increased sugar), used buttermilk instead of regular milk, increased to 2 1/2 tsp of vanilla, also I made the mini cupcakes and they only needed 17mins in oven to be completely done. I made the icing exactly as recipe suggested and put it into a plastic bag and cut off the corner to decorate. They looked great and tasted even better. Also liquid or gel color worked!

This is far and away the best red velvet cupcake recipe I've ever made.  The sour cream made me wary at first but it helped exponentially. I used a simple butter cream rather than the cream cheese and it really let the flavor of the cake stand out. Perfection!

Made this recipe about 3 hours ago-- it is wonderful. The cake is very flavorful and moist, but I'm not sure about the frosting. I put in 2/3 of a bag of powdered sugar and because I don't like cream cheese frosting (the cupcakes are for a friend), I had my mom try it and she said it was awesome. The recipe yielded 28 cupcakes. Very delicious, will be making them again!

The only issue I had with it was the frosting. It was runny and hard to work with. I also changed the milk to buttermilk, and it came out awesome! Buttermilk makes things moist!  Wish they turned out a little more red though. They generally looked more like chocolate cup cakes until you bit into one and saw red. 
Aside from the lack of bright colour and runny icing, it's an awesome recipe and a crowd pleaser!

Best cake recipe I've used!  Because it uses butter and not oil, it doesn't leave any odd after-taste.  When we want just a good chocolate cake we leave out the food coloring.  If you are using food coloring, use the flavorless!  Great stuff.

nice, but didn't reach the wow factor I was expecting/hoping for.  Everyone liked the colour of the muffins, and the flavour.

This recipe yielded some very yummy, moist, fluffy cupcakes! I used cake flour and added more than the called-for amount; I live in France and cake flour is actually more like the standard flour, which I didn't realize until recently. I added the amount of cocoa called for in the recipe, and while I love more cocoa in pretty much anything, it was hard to make the cakes red enough after that! So I think, purely for the sake of redness, I'll leave out some of the cocoa next time. But overall, this is an excellent recipe.

Delicious! I made these last halloween with candy "Glass shards" and edible blood. Looked amazing and tasted amazing. I wanted the inside of the cupcake to ooz a bit too so I put a blob of cherry filling on top of the batter before cooking and the cupcake rose around the cherry and made for a tasty addition. Mmmmmm

It's easy to make, but I think you might wanna cut the sugar in half for the cream cheese frosting because its kinda sweet~ I've use this to bond with my kids, and they love the outcome~  will definitely make this again!
*PS: I've seen other has written some really bad comment about the frosting, but I think the reason why it does form it's because this is CREAM CHEESE ICING, I have never find a recipes the can make the cream cheese icing can form like others, so of you wanna decorate you cupcakes, you may wanna use the regular icing instead~ ??

This tasted exactly like the store-bought cupcakes which I tasted at a party. It was those cupcakes which inspired me to try this recipe. I loooove how the sour cream frosting perfectly complements the sweet chocolate flavor of the cupcake. My son gobbled up 4 of these as soon as they had cooled out of the oven. I too was not a fan of red velvet until now

Yummy even though I accidentally made a mistake making this recipe. I accidentally put in too much cocoa powder so I added more liquid to compensate. Still light and fluffy and delicious. I also didn't add the red food coloring.

These were delicioouuussss. I tried making cupcakes lots of times. But they would usually end up having a brownie-ish texture, but the reminder here and the same one I got from my friend: DO NOT OVER BEAT, kept that from happening, the cream cheese frosting was so good to, it was the best ever, people keep  telling me its good too, thanks a millions for sharing this recipe :)))))

I found this recipe okay. I have had much better red velvet. I made this into a cake. I was worried when the batter came out really thick and I should have listen to my intuition. The cake turned out really dense. The flavor is nothing memorable. Needless to say I am still on the hunt for a perfect red velvet recipe.

Just made these yesterday! I made mini cupcakes and cooked for 15 minutes instead. The recipe is moist, chocolatey and the icing is perfection. Wouldn't change a thing! Everyone loved them. Note to other bakers: wear an apron! With this much red food colour, you don't want to risk a stain.

I have been looking for Red Velvet Cupcakes and the bakeries near me couldn't match up.  I made these for my wife's birthday and everyone loved them!  I put a piece of 60% cacao chocolate on the top of the batter as they baked, and that was a nice addition.  Otherwise, these will be a go-to recipe for me.

These were fantastic. The consistency was perfectly moist. I actually baked them for a cupcake contest and won. The only thing I might try to change in the future is the icing. It was very very sweet.

This was sooo good! A big hit at my sister-in-laws baby shower. The only thing I'll do different next time is reduce the sour cream in the frosting. I personally thought the frosting was too "sour" but everyone else said they loved it.

I was worried because when all the wet ingredients were combined, the sour cream was clumpy and noticeable. After adding the dry stuff, it looked fine. The cupcakes came out beautiful, but only complaint would be these have a strong taste of sour cream, and I put in exactly one cup.

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe, although I have never made red velvet cake before.  I thought it came out a little on the dry side.  And, I would never make frosting with a whole box of sugar.  It made 40 cupcakes for me.  It also is expensive to buy and use and entire jar of red dye.  I think if I make red velvet again I will look for a different style recipe.

The cupcakes came out a little dry, but I may have over-cooked them. The frosting was only enough to frost half of the cupcakes and was a little more cheesy tasting then I like.

good, but husband felt something was missing. after the regular ingredients, I added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the milk. No other changes were made. The cakes were moist. I managed to fit all the batter into 24 cake cups, even though the recipe called for 30 total. The cream cheese frosting seemed on the thin side.

I made this for my sweetheart on Valentines day...it was really good! I made a double layer, heart shaped cake with this instead of cupcakes. I increased the sugar a bit as other users have recommended...just 1/4 cup more. I'm not sure if there's really such thing as a moist red velvet cake...(I was wishing this had been just a little more moist)...but as I shared this with the girls at work the next day no one shared in my thoughts of dry cake! It was gone in a flash and everyone was raving! Thank you for sharing this recipe....oh and just a thought...if you are making red velvet cake on Valentine's day, make sure you buy your red food coloring before the big day. I had to go to three stores to find it, they were all out!

Great cupcakes!!! I made them in the mini size and they were great, but remember to cut the time so they're still moist.  Made them for Valentine's Day and decorated them with candy hearts - they were perfect!

I am nothing close to an experienced baker, and have never tried Red Velvet cake. I've never made anything from scratch, and still these came out GREAT! They're really easy to make and the cream cheese frosting gives them a nice sweet touch given that the cupcake mix itself is not that sweet, so it's got a good balance. I made 30, and within a period of hours, they were all gone. Definitely gonna make them again, probably for Valentine's! Kudos on this recipe! :)

The cupcakes were tasty and moist- and my husband actually told me they were the best hes ever had! I thought the cupcakes were great too, but the cream cheese icing turned out a bit different than I imagined. Everyone on the site raved, but I thought it was just ok. Will try again though.

I honestly have no idea what "real" red velvet tastes like, but these were great as far as im concerned.  I did use canned frosting, but the cake part was great.  This will prob be my standard recipe for red velvet.

This recipe was FANTASTIC.  I am a hardcore baker and this will certainly be a recipe used again and again. We made 2 pans of cupcakes and a pan of mini cupcakes, and the minis were absolutely fantastic as well- we put those in for about 10-15 minutes instead of 20-25 minutes. The icing is wonderful, and the flavor is killer... nice recipe!!

I looked at different red velvet cake recipes for over an hour. I choose this recipe to use for my best friends birthday cake and it turned out AMAZING, granted I didn't use all of the cocoa powder it called for, and I had to cook it a little bit longer since I baked it as a cake instead of cup cakes. I would recomend this recipe because it is quick and easy...and tastes great too!!!

this was a delicious cupcake!  I've never made a red velvet cake before and decided to try this one and I'm very glad i did.  I followed the recipe exactly as is...I made sure I mixed the batter well after each egg was added.  I don't know if this made a difference, but the cake wasn't heavy or dense like other scratch-made cakes.    And the frosting is perfect for this cake!  even my cream cheese hating husband enjoyed it.  just a note:  if you want a sugary sweet icing, use a buttercream instead.

Yum! followed another reviewer's suggestions (cut the flour to 2 1/4 cups, up the sugar to 2 1/4 cups, and double the vanilla. I also use buttermilk (or milk plus 1 Tablespoon lemon juice) to increase the moisture). I did the milk/lemon juice. Baked as cupcakes in about 15 mins

I made these exactly as the directions called for, the only change was adding red sprinkles on top.  They were wonderful!  My family loved them, they were for my daughter's birthday and she said they were the best cupcakes ever.  Now, as far as comparing them to other red velvet recipes, I have no idea how they would compare, as we've only lived in the south for a few years and have only had the grocery store cakes and one not so good recipe a friend gave - these cakes are pretty  much unheard of where I come from.  They also made exactly 30 cupcakes.

Nice recipe, very easy.  I use Greek Yogurt instead of Sour Cream and I mix a good long time to make sure it's good and mixed as my first batch was fairly dry. Second batch I baked a few minutes less (15 vs 19 mins) came out great.  The cream cheese frosting is out of this world! I had enough from my first batch to frost my second. I also baked in mini bundt pan rather than cupcakes.

Tasty, but definitely a little drier than I would like. Next time I will either try another recipe or try adding buttermilk instead of regular milk.

It was good but the frosting was too runny, I didn't want to add more powdered sugar to it because it was already sweet enough. Good flavor but it just wanted to run off the cupcake. The cake part was good and moist. I used paste instead of liquid food coloring so I was unsure of how much to add, but the color was awesome.

this is the moistest and softest recipe for cupcakes that I've come across. I used the recommendations from "The-Baby-Bow-Lady" and found that this actually made the cupcakes too moist! Even after baking for 35 minutes until the cupcakes were slightly burnt at the top, they still had too much moisture. So when I bit into one after cooling, it tasted like the same texture as the batter, not crumbly like cooked batter. I would definitely recommend the full 2.5 cups of flour and 1/2 cup cocoa next time.  Other than a few more small adjustments, I've definitely found my new cupcake recipe! My cupcakes came out with a flat surface that was raised on one side so that the cupcake had a slanted look. Thanks so much for the recipe!

These cupcakes looked so good, but they did NOT taste like red velvet cake!   They tasted like chocolate cupcakes with not enough chocolate in them. They were not good, but the texture was nice..?

Note: this review is for the frosting portion only.  I felt that the frosting was too gritty for me :(  Not sure what I did wrong, but I ended up going with a cream cheese frosting for my vevet cake :d

These were a big hit and a nice change of pace from the normal chocolate or vanilla cupcakes. My icing came out a little runny, but i'm pretty sure that was user error.  I'll be sure to beat them a little extra time the next time I make these . . . which will be soon!

This was good, but it did not taste like Red Velvet.  It tasted more like chocolate cupcakes.  Maybe next time not use cocoa or try and substitue it for something else.

Easy to follow recipe for scratch.  The cupcakes had a nice rise in the oven.  Came out good, but the next day the batter was a little dry.  My friends all liked it. Will definitely make it again.

I made these with the recommended adjustments by Baby-Bow-Lady (less flour, more sugar, 1/4c cocoa). I baked them for about 16 minutes. They were very moist, however the added sugar did make them stick to the paper wrapper. I tried to eat on when it was still a little warm an it fell all apart. I was worried they'd all be a mess, but after a few hours they did pull away from the paper more easily. I recieved many compliments, the frosting was great! Next time I'll try the original version for comparison. The key seems to be not overbaking. Definitely best eaten the day they are made, second day they dried out alot.

I really liked this recipe, the cupcakes turned out great.  I didn't love the cream cheese frosting.  I felt like the cream cheese was a little overbearing so I made half of them with butter cream icing and it turned out very good.  Next time I am going to try to add maybe more sugar to the frosting.  If I could get a modified cream cheese frosting recipe I think it would be one of the best cup cake recipes.

It's my first time baking any cupcake and I successfully tackled the cupcake making part, not so much for the frosting!  I did a dozen vs the 30 units indicated. the cupcake was excellent. I didn't think it was that chocolately at all. It had just the right consistency. However, I had a hard time making the topping - it tasted pretty sour and like some others have said, it runs a little bit so the frosting needed to be fridge up before its ready to go. I think my mistake with the frosting was that i added very very little powdered sugar with the indicated sour cream and cream cheese.   Next time, I'm going to try to use less sour cream so I don't have to add too much powdered sugar.

I followed the recipe, using light sour cream and skim milk and it was AMAZING. It made a perfect amount for three 8-inch cake pans and was done in 25 minutes. The frosting was really good, too. I used reduced fat cream cheese. The only problem I had was that it was too runny, and I even added some extra confectioners' sugar. It might have worked better if I had chilled the frosting for a while before frosting the cake, because the cake layers sort of slid around and the frosting was sliding to the bottom on the sides. That being said, I would definitely make this recipe again. The texture/taste was perfect!

I just made this recipe but halved. I'm not a big fan of red velvet cake but my husband loves it, and I had some leftover cream cheese frosting from another event so I decided to give it a try. The cake came out so light and fluffy, just like I like it. I didn't have the liquid food coloring so I improvised with Wilton color paste. I also used yogurt instead of sour cream because I didn't have that available. Great recipe.

at first i thought this would be a simple and delicious recipe, but after following the recipe exactly, i was very dissapointed in the result. the cupcakes sank, and the flavor was nothing pleasurable. i can only describe it as tasting like bran. this may be because i split the recipe in half. although i can say that the frosting was DELICIOUS. best I ever made!

Red velvet cupcakes are delicious!   But there even better when I added peppermint flavoring to the cream cheese frosting and sprinkled crushed peppermints on top.   Perfect for winter or if your craving something that tastes nice and fresh.

These were pretty good.  I made a few major miscalculations and put 4 times the amount of coco that I needed (My wife explained to me that a cup of something is not 8 oz)  Other than that everything came out good and the frosting was great

I did not LOVE this... It tasted like boxed chocolate cake. Pre-baking the batter was delish so my hopes were high, but when I tasted the finished product I was dissappointed. I work in construction so I brought the left overs into work and the guys had no problems polishing them off, so they can't be THAT bad!

This did not taste very well at all. I give it 2 stars just for ease of the recipe. But buying all these ingredients only to be disappointed was upsetting. These were very dry and had too much cocoa powder of flour or something.

Used this recipe several times and cupcakes are always moist and fluffy, never dry and very tasty.

The frosting was amazing! The cupcakes were not so red velvety however. I was definitely disappointed with the taste of them, and I followed the recipe exactly. I will make the frosting again, but the recipe for the cupcakes needs some tweaking... maybe less cocoa powder will do the trick.

AMAZING!! Me and my 4yr old son made these today (they're that easy!) and they were great! The icing on top was a great compliment to the cake. Everyone in the family raved about it. I didn't make any changes to the recipe so I gave it 5 stars. Thanks!

The cake was good but more on the dry side. It was nothing to be wowed about.

This recipe is great! I didn't realize I could change the number of servings (oops!) and ended up with enough for 30. Only I couldn't find two full size cupcake pans at the store and we ended up making 26 large cupcakes, which everyone who tried enjoyed. The vanilla cream cheese frosting tasted great with the red velvet in my opinion.

After reading other reviews, I decided to use 2 cups of flour and 2.5 cups of sugar.  They were very moist and very good!

Delicious, light, velvet red cupcakes. They are so light and airy yet have a nice subtle chocolaty flavour. I used a caramel meringue icing which completed them perfectly!  Highly recommended!

This recipe was easy to make and tastes great.  The only thing I would change would be the amount of batter you can place in your muffin shells.  I filled them up to the top and they still came out great and larger.

These turned out DeLicious! The cake texture was just wonderful; super fluffy, but dense enough to feel like you're eating something. And it had a buttery/creamy taste in it. The frosting was also amazing, though rather heavy, it tasted heavenly.

This is such a smooth batter and absolutely delicious. My husband is not a fan of desserts, but he walked out of his home office drawn by the smell of these cupcakes. He ate one and offered to help with more!  I didn't try the frosting as I had my own already prepared. (it's why I was making the cupcakes!)

Great cupcakes -  really yummy and quite unique. Boy,  you are not kidding when you said DO NOT OVERMIX.  I didn't think I had, but they came out quite dense, so I must have. I made these in mini muffin tins, and there were just the right size (that may have contributed to the dense-ness as well - can't recommened doing mini tins with this recipe). Was not sure about the icing; the sour cream really came through too much over the cream cheese.  Next time I am going to omit the sour cream and go for more of a cream cheese frosting and see what happens.  Definetly try this recipe though!

Easy and tasty, a little dry but that was probably my fault. I think I over beat the mix a bit. I made a great display with it though and the frosting is delicious!

These cupcakes turned out looking very pretty; they rose beautifully and frosted very well.  However, they were a little dry and were not very flavorful.  I didn't get a lot of positive comments on them and I had a lot left over.  I think I'll be making plain vanilla or chocolate cupcakes next time.

This recipe was easy to make and the cupcakes were great!!!!!  My family loved them.  I topped them with chopped walnuts.
