We tried these shrimpies because we had Sriracha sauce that we needed to use and these are SPICY but good! Next time we plan on putting them in tacos with cabbage, avocado and a squeeze of lemon. Thanks for the recipe!

These are really spicy, so much so that you can't really taste the shrimp.  They are very easy to prepare.  If I were to make these again I would cut the sriracha with tomato sauce or ketchup. UPDATE:  After rating this 3 stars, my spicy loving grand daughter disagreed.  She really liked these.  I used the leftover shrimp, cut in small pieces mixed in with Island Fried Rice and the combination was really good.

Iâ€™m giving this five stars, but I transformed it to a skillet recipe.  Double the dry ingredients, sub ancho powder for smoked paprika.  Use half cup surfaces.

My husband has made this few times for our shrimp tacos.  It's great.
