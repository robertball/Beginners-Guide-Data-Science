This was pretty fantastic on it's own, but wasn't like it is in the mall. I tweaked it a little and it was almost exactly what I get at the mall. I used 2 ounces of soy sauce and 1/4 cup more brown sugar. I used dark brown sugar. You couldn't even taste the bourbon. Absolutely mouth watering delicious!!

I was excited to find a Bourbon Chicken recipe with simple ingredients, as well as good reviews overall. On my second trial of this dish, I did, however, make some changes I believe for the better. 
First, used boneless skinless thighs (a bag of frozen chicken thighs, like Tyson). I doubled the marinade with the mesurements as writen, but then added about 3 tablespoons of oil (peanut), and topped off the brown sugar to 1 1/2 cup total. I also threw a few dashes of crushed red pepper, just for some contrast.
Alot of reviewers said that the liquor taste was very strong, well I have a tip to try next time; you can subsitute Vanilla Extract(the cheap kind works best) for the bourbon. I personaly don't care for he taste of liquor, also this is what they use in the Mall. Tenderize and marinade in the fridge overnight in a gallon ziplock bag.
As far as the cooking, I used the same time & temp, but covered the pan with foil until the last 15 or 20 minutes. This gave the chicken a great color and taste. The oil also helped with the browning. Serve the remaining sauce from the bottom of the pan with the chicken over rice or mashed potatoes. 
I hope these tips will inspire you to make this dish your own too.

This recipe is not bad.  It just needs some adjustments to work.  I read a lot of the reviews before I made it and decided on several changes.  
I chunked the chicken before placing in the marinade.  I also marinaded for about six hours rather than overnight.  
Because I wasn't sure how it would turn out I only bought an airplane size bottle of bourbon.  Turns out that is about a 1/4 cup.  I didn't think the alcohol taste was too strong.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I didn't have dried onion or garlic powder on hand so I used fresh grated onion and a clove of chopped garlic.  
I decided to stir-fry the meat and it worked out wonderfully, however be careful not to over cook the chicken.  I also boiled the sauce to reduce it.  I let it cook for about 15 minutes at a hard boil and I still thought it was too runny.  Next time I won't cook down all the sauce, it made a lot.
I served the chicken with white rice and steamed veggies.  It turned out sweet and had a taste similar to Hawaiian style Teryaki.  Since I have never had Bourbon Chicken from the mall I can't really compair.  My husband who isn't a fan of Asian food and my one year old daughter both really liked the chicken.  I will make this again.

thisnrecipe is definetly a keeper.  My family loved it.  The only changes I made were I chunked the chicken instead of whole breasts, I used 1/4 cup of bourbon and a few extra tablespoons of brown sugar.  By chunking the chicken it cuts the cooking time in1/2.  It only took about 30 minutes.  This one is a favorite for us.

If you have been to the Cajun Grill or Asian Chao, this recipe does not come close.  I have tried every recipe on the Internet for this dish have yet to find any recipe close to the fast food chains.  I found this recipe definately to have too much of the bourbon in it.  The second time I used this recipe, I reduced the bourbon and still found it to be too much.   I have since found out that mall version of this recipe does not use bourbon at all!

this is so incredibly easy but packed with flavor.  My oven went on the fritz so I had to do this on the stovetop.  I cut into thin strips and used fresh grated ginger, and 2 cloves crushed garlic.  Omitted the powders.  sauteed a large onion and added the meat and marinade.  Thickened with a little cornstarch. Served over basmati rice seasoned with saffron and peas.  This has a wonderful flavor.  I was leary of the amt. of brown sugar but although it is sweeter, it is not sickening.  This tastes sort of like General Tsao's but just has a unique flavor all its own due to the bourbon.  Now I know what to do with the big bottle of bourbon I bought by mistake.  Thanks for this super easy recipe packed with flavor.

I made this for my husband and I and another couple.  I cut up 8 boneless breasts (smaller Tyson ones) into bite-sized pieces and marinated over nite and then baked it as instructed and it was delicious.  We ate it all, served over rice.  I was embarrassed that I didn't have more to serve!  The bourbon taste wasn't too strong - maybe because I baked it long enough.  Yummy.

If you are looking to duplicate the bourbon chicken found in the malls, this is not it. But this is still a very good recipe.

This was VERY good.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and let it marinate for 1 1/2 days.  I did cook the chicken too long.  I would also cut back a little on the soy and bourbon.  I think 1 hour would have been more than enough.  This tastes VERY close to my favorite bourbon chicken served at The Big Easy.  I'll definitely make this again.

Ive used this recipe for the last couple of years, and have always used chicken thighs(usually the big pkg). I put all the ingred. in a crockpot(which from what I remember no other reviewers have done), and cook on slow for 8 hours. It comes fall of the bone tender.  The only 2 things I have tweaked abit is that I have added alittle more brown sugar and garlic. After the 8 hours of being in the crockpot - ITS WONDERFUL - I place 2 thighs on a bed of white rice then drizzle the left over sauce over the top. Its the most asked for recipe from my family and friends. Diffently a keeper.  Thanks Lucy!!!

After reading previous reviews, I changed the method of preparation a little.  I was only cooking for two, so I used two boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I cut them into bite-size pieces and marinated them for only one hour.  Then I tossed the whole thing on a frying pan and cooked it until the chicken was done and the sauce had thickened.  I served it over buttered egg noodles with peas.  I thought it was really delicious and almost exactly like the mall stuff.  My bf liked it at first, then only finished half of it, saying that the alcohol taste was too strong.  I will make it again, but try using half as much alcohol.  I thought it was great.

I have been making this recipe for a while, but there are a few things I change first double the batch of marinade, no the chicken has enough. second add 2 tsp. of rice wine or white wine vinegar to that doubled amount of marinade, and only use half to marinade chicken, save the rest of the marinade. cut chicken into strips before marinading. cook on a large cast iron griddle (the kind that sets on two burners) over high heat. after the chicken is mostly cooked add the reserved marinade and cook until marinade turns into a thick syrup. serve with jambalaya or dirty rice.

I don't usually like the taste of alcohol so I used vanilla extract instead of the bourbon, which turned out great.  I let it marinate all morning instead of over night.  I cooked it in the oven as directed for 1 1/2 hrs, but I wanted the sauce to stick to the chicken better so I transferred the sauce to a sauce pan on the stove top and added 1 Tbsp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce then added all the chicken to the stove top pan to coat well.

While this wasn't exactly the same flavor as the food court sells I think it was really great! I took the advice of others and only used 1/4 cup alcohol and added water to make the liquid the 3/8 cup required. I used scotch because that's what I had on hand. Also I used small chicken tenderloins so ghey cooked faster. Once nearly cooked I turned the temp down to allow the liquid to cook down a little more ( I won't add the additional water next time if I use the tenderloins again).  I could see this as being popular at a potluck party. Thanks!!

I didn't give it 5 stars. Because I made it 3 times until I got the flavor i was really looking for. I partically like the "Mall" bourbon chicken. It is a great recipe to us as a base. These are some of my changes. I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast. I seasoned the thichs with seasoning salt. I used 1/4 cup of lite soy sauce and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I felt the recipe had a strong soy sauce flavor the first time I made it. I used fresh ginger and garlic. I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I used half of the marniade mixure as a marinade.I marnidaed the chicke for a couple of hours then threw it on the grill. The other half I simmered it to cook out the alcohol. Once the chicken was cooked I placed in a dish and topped the cooked chicken with the sauce. The taste is superb!

Turned out good but I will decrease the amount of bourbon or use vanilla flavoring next time.  I am not a drinker so it seemed like I was tasting a small amount of bourbon.  I increased the amount of (dark) brown sugar and soy sauce to mask the taste.  I also used diced chicken strips.

I marinated 2 chicken breasts (cut into bite size pieces) for about 3 hours in plastic storage bag. I poured the marinade into a small pot to boil, and I poured the chicken in a large saute pan coated with olive oil. After chicken was cooked, I added chopped onions, bell pepper, celery, and garlic. Then I added cooked rice and boiled marinade. Mixed well. Then I threw in a beaten egg to bring it all together. Now serve to the masses. Delicious alternative. Note: I did use a little less bourbon and soy sauce. Also, I added a pinch of crushed red pepper. Next time I will use dark meat, and maybe I'll follow the recipe.

Substitution for bourbon and recipe for extra sauce to go over rice:
I've made this twice and my very picky family loves it.  I don't have bourbon so I sub 1 Tbs of vanilla + 2 Tbs water.  If I don't plan ahead enough to marinate it overnight, I like to cut the chicken up in strips and marinate it in a ziploc for a couple hours.  Then I pour the chicken and marinate in a pan, cover with foil and cook at 350 for about 45 minutes.  
Sauce for rice: I like to make a second batch of marinate (half the recipe this time).  Then add 2 cups chicken broth to it.  Bring it to a boil.   Dissolve 1 Tbs of cornstarch in some cold water or broth and add that to the boiling sauce mixture and stir until slightly thickened.

I have made this quite a few times in the last year. It has become a favorite at my house. I did tweak things a bit. I use boneless chicken breast and thighs. I also double the ingredients for the marinade. to decrease the salt I use low-sodium soy sauceand I have found that the cheapest vanilla extract increases the flavor. I always marinate the chicken for atleast 8hours before cooking. I serve over rice.

It may be luck, but my rendition of this recipe did not come out like the mall's version; it came out BETTER!!

I am terrible at ad libbing, when it comes to recipes, but I tried to stay close to the orig recipe. I used all of the listed ingredients, but adjusted them all based on my own tastes. I cooked a semi-vat of chicken, so I had to toy with the individual amounts.

I sample as I cook, and I too was concerned that the taste of the bourbon would be too strong. I put in almost a cup for 5.5 lbs of chicken. Initially, the bourbon was pungent, but it cooked down. I also added more garlic, ginger and onion, as required.

I let my boys judge the meal...and let's just say that empty plates and rounds of 2nds and 3rds was an indicator that this recipe was a keeper :)

This was an excellent dinner, it tasted just like the mall. The only things I did different was I used thigh meat instead of white meat, I cut up my chicken before I marinated it and only marinated it for 5 hours then sauted the chicken and sauce in a pan until done, instead of baking.  It only took about 10 minutes in the pan.  Loved it and will make it again and again

This recipe was good.  I used boneless, skinless  chicken breasts and marinated for 24 hours.  The breasts absorbed lots of marinade and they were tender and juicy.  The marinade itself wasn't that impressive though.  It tasted almost like teriyaki -- not much bourbon taste.  WARNING:  DO NOT BAKE FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF if using skinless breasts.  Bake at 350 for about 45 to 50 minutes max.

This was yummy, but I did change it a little, I used fresh minced garlic, about 5 cloves-we like garlic at our house. I didn't use the bourbon or the onion, or the ground ginger. It was still very yummy, I marinated overnight and served with broccoli and mashed potatoes, but afterward our family agreed it would have been very tasty with rice as well.

I fixed this for my husband's birthday dinner. The bourbon is quite strong but he didn't mind. I would be afraid to give this to children under 21! That's how strong it is. In the future I will probably have more honey than bourbon

This is the basis for an exceptional meal.  I used chicken thighs and changed the proportions of bourbon and brown sugar a bit.  I also added cornstarch as a thickener to the sauce while it cooked.  The result was quite good, and my family is already asking for it again.

This recipe is great! I've made it several times and always get compliments. I've found the best cut of meat is boneless chicken thighs and it tastes great served with rice.

I wanted to make sure that this recipe turned out as good as possible, so I read a lot of the reviews & took the advice of several reviewers. The only concerns seemed to be that the bourbon taste was too strong & the ginger was too overpowering. I decided to use NO bourbon at all & I only used half the amount of ginger. I also cut the chicken into bite-size pieces &  marinated for a few hours instead of overnight. Well, this recipe turned out FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!! The best bourbon(bourbon-less?)chicken I have ever had!!!!! I will be making this recipe a lot.

What a great recipe! My boyfriend gave it the thumbs up but I did make a few changes to save time. I marinated the chicken for 10 hours and used fresh garlic and ginger. I then dusted the breasts with flour and pan fried them until golden brown and cooked through. I then poured the leftover marinade into the hot pan and reduced it to a thick sauce to pour over the chicken. Will be making again for sure.

I made this for a few friends and they loved it!  Still asking me to fix it again next time they're over.  I made it for 3 people and used about $5 worth of chicken tenders which I cut up into bite sized pieces.  I added about a tablespoon of honey and used an airplane sized bottle of bourbon and cut down on the soy sauce.  I marintaed it for about 2.5 hours then stir fried it until done.  I can't wait to make this again!

I used Jack Daniel's instead of bourbon whiskey and only 3 packets of soy sauce instead of 3 oz. I chopped it in pieces. I left it marinading for 32 hours before cooking and flipped the container every 8 hours. Before cooking, I left a bit more whiskey in it and left it sitting for 15 mins. After baking for 45 mins, I threw it all in the frying pan and cooked it in it's own gravy. I dumped some more whiskey into it and cooked it flambé until the flame extinguished. I left the gravy thicken and voila. The only problem with the recipe was that it asked for less chicken than demand and everyone was angry because they wanted more. I can't just hurry and make it right away, it takes 32 hrs.

For that, it lost the 5th star.

My brother requested this for his birthday dinner, so went to the store to get Bourbon and they only had huge bottles, the store owner suggested that I try a smaller bottle of Brandy, I made this recipe with a 1/4 cup of Brandy and it was amazing, I have made it about 4 times now & need to go back to the store to get more alcohol but since I did so well with the Brandy I am going to stick with it!   This is now going on Heavy rotation in our house!!!

It was good but not anxious to make it again. Used thigh meat but will try breast next time. Marinated for nine hours and then cooked in the skillet.

WOW, I'm surprised by the mixed reviews for this recipe.  I found it to be excellent with 2 minor adjustments.  I cubed my chicken before marinating and I cooked in my wok on top of stove.  I only used about 1/2 cup of the marinade and let the sauce reduce until it was thick and sticky.  Served with steamed rice and roasted broccoli.  Loved it!  Easy to make with common ingredients.

Chicken was dry. I will follow others' suggestions next time and use dark meat. 
I modified the recipe a bit and followed others' tips when I cooked it.

I mixed all the ingredients in a gallon sized zip-lock bag. Here are the following changes I made to the marinade:
2 tbsp vanilla extract
1/4 of minced onion
1 1/2 tsp garlic powder
1 cup brown sugar
50 ml bourbon whisky
1/2 cup soy sauce
1 tbsp grated ginger
sliced chicken breasts

I marinaded the chicken for 10 hours (overnight). Then I poured the entire mixture into a greased 9x13 baking dish and covered with aluminum foil for 1.5 hours at the suggested temp. (325F)

The flavor was GREAT! But the chicken was still dry. I will definately use the marinade again for next time but with dark chicken meat.

Perfect for barbeque.  I marinated the chicken for 24 hours; the flavor soaked in nicely and made for a lovely coating on the grilled meat. This is a keeper.

Very good.  My son and I love to eat this at the mall and was wanting to find an adequate recipe for home.  This definitely fit the bill.  Even my very picky husband loved this chicken.  I did add a little more brown sugar, because we like it sweet, and cut the bourbon down to 1/4 c. Will definitely make this again.  Thanx!

This is a must have recipe!  My family adores bourbon chicken, even my very picky 10 yr old.  We prefer it a bit sweeter, so I use 3/4 to 1 cup brown sugar.  Other than that, it is great!

This was great!  I baked at 350 and it was ready in much less time.  I added a bit of vanilla to the sauce before marinating.  I also poked holes in the chicken with a fork before marinating which really enhanced the flavor.

I made this last night with chicken thighs and it was amazing. We broiled it for a little bit at the end and it gave it a nice crust.

I have made this recipe several times now and we enjoy it more every time I make it.  I do make changes and use thighs instead of chichen breast.  Bake until juices run clear.  That's it.  Usually serve with rice.  Have taken this to deer camp and everyone raved about it.   If there were  10 stars that's what I would give this recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe Lucy.

After reading the reviews, i halved the soy sauce and substituted cheap vanilla for bourbon (i have a toddler and don't like to cook with alcohol).  This was delicious!  I breaded my chicken with cornstarch and fried it, then used the sauce over the top.  Will definately be adding to my collection.

Slow cooked this recipe during a day car trip to the mountains. Ready when we arrived home. So delicious over rice. Substituted Spenda Brown Sugar at half levels of regular brown sugar. Great !!

Two things terribly wrong with this recipe - cooking time and the onion flakes.  Cooking time is much too long.  One hour is about perfect with the chicken quite tender and tasty.  Cook for 1.5 hours and it's quite a different story with the chicken dried out and tasteless.  Don't use onion flakes!  If you like the taste of onion then add it as onion powder because the flakes look very odd and unappetizing on the finished product that leads everyone to ask "What is this stuff?".  Overall, there is much wrong with the recipe - soy sauce taste too strong, bourbon taste too strong, and sickly sweet at the same time.  I don't know how to alter the recipe either except I'm tempted to add some chicken broth to mellow out the flavors.  Don't think I will bother though.  Instead I will try out some other recipes.

Made this recipe yesterday and was thrilled with the results.  The only change I made to the recipe was using chicken thighs instead of chicken breast. This is what they use where I buy it at the mall.  Both my husband and myself loved the dish. There is just enough left over for my lunch today.  I will definitely be making this again and the only thing I would change is using a soy sauce with less sodium.  It got a 5 star rating from me...
Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe.

Made as written.  A little salty for my taste, and not like the bourbon chicken in the malls.  My family liked it more than I did.

I just pan fried my chicken and then added the other ingredients. It turned out wonderfully, and I didn't have to marinate over night. I paired it with a garlic and pecan brown rice.

The flavor was a little too strong for me... next time I'll use a little less soy sauce and add some honey. Could have been a little sweeter... I think shallots would have been nicer than the dried minced onion- it seemed to overwhelm the dish.

This had WAY too much bourbon!  It was way too bourbon flavored and the chicken was really dry.  It didn't taste anything like the chicken you get at "the mall" and I will for sure not make this recipe again.

Although there is a little too much bourbon in this and it kind of wrecked the taste for us, the soy sauce kind of makes up for it. Nothing like you'd have in a restaurant though..serve with a side dish that would distract from the taste of the bourbon.

W--O--W!! This was awesome! Even my world famous picky boyfriend loved it! (That says a lot!) Used Jim Beam bourbon, boneless skinless chicken thighs, cooked for about 50 min. GRRREAT! Thank you so much for the recipe. Will make again.

I liked this recipe, but I LOVED it when I used salmon instead of chicken. I had been looking a long time for Bourbon Salmon and this is perfect. Difference: requires only 30 minutes of marination and broil for 5-10 minutes.

This was excellent. I marinated the chicken overnight, used fresh onions and garlic. Instead of baking in the oven I grilled the chicken first and then sautee'd in the marinade to make an excellent rich sauce. Served w/ rice and brocolli. Everyone raved, especially my 10 year old. This one is a keeper.

This was a very good recipe.  I made it for a Mardi Gras/Birthday celebration for work.  It was the first thing to go.  The only thing I did different was, I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and then baked at 375 for 45 mins.  I also didn't have time to marinade that long but it was still wonderful.

This dish is absolutely delicious!  I added a tablespoon of honey just to embellish a little.  I may try to shred the chicken next time, rather than leave the breasts whole, but the flavor is phenomenal!  The bourbon/soy/ginger mixture serves as a great sauce I have found, not just for the chicken but also on rice or mashed potatoes. A++

Really enjoyed this recipe, and thought it was incredibly easy.  I used whiskey instead of bourbon, I figured same difference.  I doubled the recipe and it turned out well, I used low sodium soy sauce, and added about 1 tbsp. of honey to cut back on the saltiness.  The meat turned out tender, I also think this could be good on the grill, I'll have to see come summer.

This chicken has a wonderful flavor, but the presentation is lacking. Also the cooking time was too long if you use boneless skinless breasts.Perhaps it could use a demi-glaze or sauce to make it appear more appetizing. Otherwise, I like some reviewers ideas of using it for stir fry or in a sauce over steamed rice. Thanks for sharing, Lucy.

I believe I have already reviewed this recipe however wanted to add a few things. We love this recipe. If you want it to taste more like the mall recipes use skinless, boneless theighs instead of breast. Breast will turn out dry. Also add low salt soy sauce. I always use southern comfort (to taste) and grand marneir (if thats how you spell it). An off brand orange liquor will work as well or maybe some grated orange peel in the marinade.  However if you add another liquor to the mix you will want to cut back on the other.  I just use the small single shots bottles on the counter in the liquor store.  Southern comfort is sweet and adds to the recipe intead of traditional buorbon. I also stir-fry my chicken theighs.

Just made this.  I used 2 skinless boneless chicken breasts and 6 boneless skinless thighs.  I strained the chicken after marinating and stir fried it in batches to brown it up a bit.  After transferring the chicken to a separate bowl I poured the remaining marinade into the pan and reduced it to a nice sauce.  I then returned the chicken to the pan and stirred the chicken to coat it with the sauce.  I served it over rice and it was delicious.

Very good recipe but be careful on the cooking time. The recipe says cook for 1 1/2 hours and that's way too long. I cut the breast into small pieces and after a hour went to check on it and the juice was all gone. Its a little salty you might want to use Lite Soy Sauce instead of regular.

I had never had bourbon chicken before, and this recipe intrigued me.  Unfortunately, I mostly tasted the alcohol flavor.  Maybe I'll retry it and cut down on the bourbon.

I marinaded my chicken pretty much all day. Like from six this morning until it was time to cook it. I think that made a lot of difference. This was good, but I think it could have been better--maybe with some fresh minced garlic and more chopped onion? This seemed to go hand-in-hand with the cold Sesame Noodles I made to go with it. This is a yummy dish but like I said, I think that marinading it as long as you can makes all the difference.

This was delicious.  I made it just as the recipe said.  I didn't have an overpowering alcohol taste and my chicken was tender and juicy.  Even my picky eaters loved it.  Will definately make it again.

My husband really liked it.  All I could taste was alcohol.  I used airplane sized bottle of bourbon and increased the brown sugar as suggested by previous reviewers.  I did marinate over night.  If I do it again, I will either substitute vanilla extract for bourbon, or use only 1-2 tablespoons bourbon.  I tasted like I could get drunk off my dinner.

I made this for a Father's day BBQ for my residents at work. I cut the marinaded chicken up into chunks and sauteed them and served them on a warm kaiser roll as a sandwich. I couldn't use bourbon so i subbed it with apple concentrate and it was delicious. thanks for the recipe

I literally just made this tonight. I marinated 1/2 of the chicken overnight, I added another pound in the morning after inviting some friends to come over for dinner. The chicken that I added this morning tasted 1000 times better than the chicken that marinated overnight. I recommend marinating the chicken only for a few hours & not overnight. The chicken that marinated overnight was very tough. Secondly the chicken & sauce in general tasted very much like Bourbon. I recommend cutting down on the amount of Bourbon you use. It was good & I will probably make this again but next time with less Bourbon! Overall my family liked it.

The steamed carrots and broccoli I made to go with this dish was excellent!!!!!! We were not impressed with this recipe.  The Bourbon marinade seemed to cook the chicken within the overnight period.  The chicken was tough and already dry before it went into the oven.  I knew at this point I would not care for this recipe.  It also had an overwhelming taste of bourbon.  Will not make again.

Pretty good, I used vanilla in place of the bourbon, but may have been a little too sweet for us.  Would make again but with the bourbon, got scared from reading reviews that it was too strong.

This was good.I took one of the other reviewers tips and add the vanilla extract instead of wasting my money on bourbon. It was just like what they serve at the mall! Thanks, I will be making this again! Next time I might try brwoning it real quick in a frying pan before placing it in the oven. It wasnt as crispy on the out sides as the malls was.

Triple the sauce amounts and pay attention to taste; add or reduce certain ingredients to get exactly what you want.   Try this several times, using different whiskey brands: You might be surprised to find lesser known brands do far better than popular ones.  It wasn't just "Fridays" at my house--it was the whole sweet fun weekend on just one family dinner night at my house!!

The only changes that I made were - I used chicken breast cut into bite sized pieces. Instead of baking them, I cooked them on the stovetop in a covered skillet with the marinade.  When the chicken was done, I removed it and reduced the marinade to use as a sauce.  My husband could not stop raving about it and requested that next time I double the recipe.  Next time I think that I will cut back on the amount of brown sugar and used chopped garlic instead of garlic powder.

Used 1/4c bourbon based on other reviews, and a few dashes of onion powder sinc eI didn't have minced onion.  Tastes great, will definitely make again.

This is a keeper! My picky eater boyfriend loves it, he said it tastes better than the one at Chinese restaurants. Really delicious, a little on the sweet side, but not overwhelmingly sweet. You can taste the alcohol (I used Jack Daniels), but it's not overpowering. If you do follow the recipe with exact measurement, however I'd recommend decrease the amount of the bourbon by just a liiiiitle bit.

I used some of the tips from the other reviewers. I ended up marinating my chicken for over a day (I didn't have time to cook it the day I planned). It came out really good, my husband is a fan. It was great with stir fry over rice.

I tried all the bourbon chicken recipes online and made some adjustments here and there, but the flavor is always a little different from the bourbon chicken I have at malls. Luckily I found a good product online at bourbonchicken.com, and their sauces are awesome! Now I can save time preparing sauce ingredients, save money from buying bourbon chicken at the shopping mall, and have a great time doing grill with my kids. The flavor becomes so easy to achieve at home!

This was the tastiest chicken I have ever made. The only modifications that I made were to use fresh garlic and onion powder instead of flakes. It came out so flavorful (I only marinated the breasts for about 2 hours.  I Have never had the "mall" bourbon chicken that is so fondly spoken of in other reviews, so I had no expectations going in, lol.  We will definately make this again!

I added more brown sugar and less bourbon (I used Jack Daniels).  I used fresh onion and cooked the chicken on the stove with olive oil.  I removed the cooked chicken and kept it warm in the oven.  I added the marinade to the pan in which I cooked the chicken.  I thickened it with cornstarch water.  Served over rice with green beans on the side.  It was a hit, but only because I read all the other reviews and modified the original recipe accordingly.

After reading all the reviews, I have to agree with many other people that 1)it needs more brown sugar, 2)to much bourbon taste, 3)should pan fry. Oven really dried it out. Sort of disappointed cause I really had my heart set on some good "mall-type" bourbon chicken. It was really dry. I deviated from the main recipe in that I sliced the chicken into strips, but the rest I followed to the T. Without a side of rice, I could not have eaten the chicken plain for the overpowering smell/taste of bourbon. I will tweak and try again sometime.

Really dry chicken, not at all what i expected. And we followed this recipe from scratch. Sorry , i usually love most things from this site, however this just wasn't for me. My brothers, however, like anything chicken, and they didnt complain at all really. They just added some extra BBQ sauce on top.

I searched for a Bourbon Chicken recipe hoping to find one that tastes like the one we have at the chinese places at the malls. Even with a few tweaks this is a superb recipe! Use thighs instead of breast meat and make it on the stove top. Just remember to change the ingredients ratio to 2 thighs per chicken breast. I used fresh onions, garlic and ginger too. With no bourbon in the house, I used sherry instead. Try it out!

We tried this dish to use up some boneless chicken thighs we had left over. It is very close to the recipe from our favorite local carry-out chineese restaurant.

Actually really good!  I made this with chicken drumsticks and put it in the crockpot for 4 hours on low and shreaded for the last 15 minutes to soak in the flavor.  It was really tasty...not necessarly the mall type, but close and really good!  I also used extreamly cheap bourbon!

My husband and I really liked this recipe. We were glad it wasn't as sickly sweet as some of the bourbon chicken you get at the mall, but still really full flavored and to me it tasted just like bourbon chicken should. I used the allrecipes scaling feature to scale it down to two servings, then made a couple changes: used 3/8 cup brown sugar, fresh ginger, and 1/8 cup onion soup in place of the dried onion. We used the recommended amount of bourbon and didn't find it too bourbon tasting. I then cooked the chicken breasts at 350 for 60 minutes. We put the extra marinade over brown/wild rice, which was very good as well. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I came across this recipe about a year ago, and ever since then have made this dish once or twice a month.  It doesn't even need to marinate.  It's simple, but also fit for company.  I use chicken strips instead of chicken breasts; I find it comes out juicer that way.  I also double the sauce so I have more to thicken and serve over the chicken and the rice.

Very yummy!  It worked out great to do this in my crockpot using chicken breasts. However, next time I think I'll use chicken thighs...their juicier.  I added a little more brown sugar and less bourbon than it called for and since I was out of dried onion I used a whole packet of onion soup mix.  It was heavenly!

I am a vegetarian, so I did not try this recipe, but when I made it for my boyfriend he said it tasted too much like bourbon, and nothing like the "bourbon chicken" you usually get when you go out. He would not eat it.

I read the reviews before I made it so I added a little more brown sugar, but I used light brown sugar.  Also, I used fresh onions and garlic.  I didn't think it was strong at all, in fact it was a hit!  I will definately make it again soon.

Very easy and tasted good. I made a few changes. I used fresh onion and garlic and 1/8 cup of bourbon and only marinated it for a couple of hours and I served it with rice. My husband loved it and the kids ate it too.

I tried this recipe with no bourbon and slightly less ginger.  It turned out fantastic.  It seemed a little dry though, so next time I'll cook it for just an hour I think.

I cut up the chicken when I made this dish because it suited my purpose better. The balance of soy, ginger and bourbon was PERFECT. Next time I'm gonna add a little more spice, though.

It was good, but a little dry. I cooked it less time and cut up the chicken so it absorbed the flavor in an hour instead of over night.

this was really good. I didn't even marinate ahead of time just put it in the pan and baked. I put sugar to taste and after tasting the sauce before pouring--- the bourbon taste was quite strong. I was afraid the kids would not eat it so I added a little teriyaki sauce to tone it down for them. I could not believe it was so flavorful even without marinating. It looked very appetizing too it turned a nice golden bronze after baking. Will make again. Thanks Lucy Loo!

I followed the recipe exactly and the result was disappointing. The result was something ok edible but definately not the same bourbon chicken I've enjoyed at the malls. I am curious as to how this person acquired this recipe to make the claim of any simularity to the malls product. I will not try this recipe again!

I don't recommend this one at all. I  I cooked the chicken for an hour and it was way overdone.  I basted frequently as directed but it still came out like charcoal.  The marinade was pretty potent although the flavor was good.  I would definately cut down on the bourbon also.  Maybe y'all will have better luck than I did.

Unlike several other reviewers I wasn't attempting to exactly mimic the mall food (why would I?) This is a great recipe with a few tweaks for personal taste. I cut the breasts into large chunks and used another reviewer's suggestion to stir-fry until chicken was cooked and sauce had thickened to a syrup. I substituted 1 tsp ginger paste for the ground ginger and next time I'll use more just because we love it. I don't understand why some users greatly increased the sugar- this is an entrée, not dessert! Serve with rice or pearl couscous and stir-fried veggies.

Followed the recipe as directed and the chicken turned out dry.  Also, the sauce tasted too much like whisky and soy sauce for my family's taste.  I'd recommend pan frying (as some reviewers mentioned) in lieu of baking the chicken.  Will not make this recipe again.

Didn't like this recipe at all and was shocked because of the high rating. I marinated the chicken overnight and it turned out very dry. The marinade itself also didn't taste good, the bourbon was too strong and it tasted nothing like the bourbon chicken I love at the mall. Definitely won't make again.

DELICIOUS! I cut the chicken into strips and allowed to marinate for about 4 hours. Then I pan fried the chicken with the sauce. Family loved it!

I read all the reviews. I decided to cook the sauce first, so used real onions and real garlic. Cook the Blurbon. I let it cool and covered chucken pieces and refrigerated for about 4 hours. Then cook 1/2 at a time in my Wok.  What a wonderful dish. I will use it again.

I try to follow recipe as written before rating, but I was short a little soy sauce (had about half). Still came out outstanding (never had the mall version, so don't know if it's matched). Served over rice, family raved about it. Next time I'll make extra marinade to reserve as a sauce after cookig

This is a great recipe with fabulous flavor.  Made it in the crock pot with just a couple modifications.  I substituted 1/4 cup vanilla extract + 1/4 cup water for the bourbon, increased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup based on other reviews, and used 4 tsp of minced garlic (not dried).  I did not marinate, just cooked in crock pot for 4 hours on high and turned out delicious.  Served on top of brown rice.  We are adding this to our list of regular favorites!  The sauce was thin, so I am thinking it would turn out fine without adding the extra water, and will probably try that next time.

I followed the suggestions of other users, and used vanilla instead of bourbon, and also put in minced garlic. I was NOT impressed with this dish. It was kind of weird, just too "vanilla"-y of a flavor....and unfortunately I overcooked the chicken, too, which is easy to do with boneless skinless breasts. Won't be trying this again. I would love to find a great bourbon chicken recipe!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't have dried minced onion or garlic powder, so I used two tablespoons of minced red onion and half a teaspoon of minced garlic because I did have those on hand.  I didn't find it to be too bourbony, but I also didn't let it marinade over night.  The kids loved it.

Using thighs instead of  breasts, and a straight 1/2 cup of bourbon rather than 3 oz, I stir-fried this after only an hour's worth of marinating. After letting the marinade reduce for 20 minutes or so, it became a nice sauce.   I don't know what's happened where other reviewers have had it seem like too much bourbon.

Cooked this on the stove-top as another reviewer had. I used fresh onion and garlic in place of the powdered versions, then added red pepper flakes and ginger. I replaced most of the bourbon with vanilla based on previous reviewers suggestions. Delicious!

To me, the bourbon flavor was WAY to strong and it was not sweet at all.  I followed the directions exactly.  I am relatively new to cooking, so that's the only way I know how.  After reading the reviews, I will try again with half the Boubon and soy sauce and twice the brown sugar.  Wish me luck.

This tastes similar to the bourbon chicken at Golden Corral, in my opinion. Wonderful.   I only marinated the chicken for about an hour, and I omitted the bourbon because I hate alcohol.   The chicken came out nice and juicy (I cooked it for about 45mins, basting every so often) and flavorful! This is definitely going into my weekly rotation of meals. Thanks!

I thought this was pretty good.  Not the same thing that you get at the mall, but still good.  I diced my chicken into bite-sized chunks and cooked it in a skillet with the sauce.  When the chicken was cooked through, I added a slurry of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I also added a handful of chopped onion.  Several reviewers said that the bourbon had a strong taste, but I didn't find it to be so.  I will definately try this recipe again.

My friends used to eat bourbon chicken in the malls nearly every day when we we were in the US for holidays. As this doesn't exist in Germany, I looked for a recipe o surprise him and he was overwhelmed! I am a vegetarian, so I split the marinade and poured half of it over 300gram of chicken breast and the other half over diced tofu. I prepared both separately in pans (fried 1/2 chopped onion in some olive oil first, then browned the chicken or tofu, then added the marinade and cooked for further 5 minutes) and it was awesome served with instant asia noodles. I had to fry the tofu longer than the chicken, though, because it soaked up much of the alcohol. But the taste vanished when the tofu was dark brown. I used about 1 ounce of soy sauce less as it was very salty the first time I made it.

I used the ingredients suggested in the review by TheNakedChef, most notably using some vanilla extract & reducing the amount of bourbon. The end result was fantastic. I also used boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead. I'm normally a white meat person, but the thighs worked well with this and baked to a deep brown while remaining tender and not at all dry.

If you try this recipe with the expectation that it's going to taste like the fattening, restaurant version, you are going to be disappointed.  That being said, however, it's a very flavorful and relatively healthy dish.  Make it even healthier by using low sodium soy sauce and serve it over brown rice.  Yum!

The chicken was amazing!  Simply delicious. We had no leftovers. I didn't have onion flakes so I chopped a half of an onion, a tablespoon of minced garlic and sprinkled garlic salt over the chicken lightly before refrigeration overnight. The kicker was, I did not have any bourbon on hand so I used brandy on 5 boneless chicken breasts and had plenty of the marinade to cover. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. I will use it again. It was delicious, even with the brandy. My husband said "it's a keeper."

This didn't remind me of Bourbon Chicken at the mall at all.  After reading other reviews I upped the brown sugar and only used 1/4 cup of bourbon.  I decreased the marinating time to try to reduce the alcohol flavor but it is still a bit strong.  Probably won't make this again.  Without the bourbon it would make a decent marinade.

I liked this recipe, but made several modifications.Instead of leaving the breasts whole I sliced them into half inch slices.I marinated them just as the orig. recipe said. I the next day I arranged them in a single layer on a cookie sheet and baked them for about 20 minutes, turning twice during cook time. I think next time I will reduce the soy sauce a bit so it's not quite so salty. Otherwise a very good recipe, my husband & boys inhaled it all!!

We all loved this dish. We didn't even marinate or bake (fried in a pan), and it was still delicious.

This was a VERY easy recipe.  I didn't have time to marinate overnight so only kept it in the icebox for an 30 min before baking.  I did cube the chicken before mixing with the sauce.  The only change I made was adding chopped green onions to the chicken prior to serving over white rice.  I think next time I will leave out the minced onions and will put a little bit more sugar in next time.

I did not care for this. when found this recipe for bourbon chicken i was really hoping that it would taste like or even better than the one served at the mall.  i followed all the direction and used all the ingredients needed.

My husband and I really didn't like this.  We added more brown sugar and less bourbon, like others, but still tasted too much of the alcohol.  We also cubed the chicken and pan-fried it, and separately cooked the remaining marinade.  The chicken still had an alcohol taste to it.

I thought that it was far too "boozy" tasting.  The sauce was also a little watery.  Like others, I cooked it too long and the chicken was tough.  I made it for a Superbowl party and had it in a crockpot, so the chicken continued to get tougher and tougher throughout the night.  I won't make this again.

this was pretty good. I doubled the recipe and also cut back on the bourbon and marinated overnite. I cooked for 55 minutes but that was a little too long, next time i will cut back on the cooking time. My family loved it, but i noticed when i was cooking that the bourban was very strong, so i added some corn syrup and more brown sugar and it came out very good (a little on the sweet side, but thats what my kids like). I will definately be making this again. Thanks for the recipe and the extra tips.

I was so excited to make this recipe.  However, it didn't really turn out right.  We were expecting it to taste similar to the one you can get at the mall but it really didn't taste anything like it.  I still would like to try it again making my own tweaks.  I don't give up that easily.  :o)

I love bourbon chicken, and I've tried about 5 other recipes from the Internet, and NONE come close to 'the mall' chicken. This recipe was nothing like I expected. Do yourself a favor: Get in your car and spend the $4 for a plate of the real stuff!

This was pretty good.  If I make it again I will definitely reduce the bourbon just a little bit and not bake it quite as long.

This was awesome. I used fresh onions,garlic and ginger. I had read all the other reviews about the bourbon and I did use it all. It came out really good. I did it like a stirfry with some broccoli and rice. Terrific. I really loved this recipe. I will use it again. Thank Lucy for sharing

This dish is incredible!!! The flavor is intensely captivating...Just make sure you watch the chicken as it's cooking-it can burn easily with the crust.  Also, we didn't use 3/4 c butter for the final glaze, rather, we used around 6 tablespoones and it was great.  (Last time was a little buttery).  We really enjoyed it--Thank you so much for the recipe!

this was really good, a little salty from the sauce but still good. I left the bourbon out because I didn't have any and after reading some of the reviews decided not to bother with buying any. I will however use a low sodium soysauce or maybe water it down a little so that it wont be so salty next time. Other than that I think it definitely has 5 star potential.
thanks for the recipe.

My whole family loves the bourbon chicken at the mall  and I was thrilled when I found this recipe.  I was extremely disappointed, however, because I followed the recipe to a tee and it was awful!  There was a strong alcohol smell while it marinated and cooked and the chicken tasted strongly of alcohol and did not have the sweet taste that we love.   I thought the alcohol would cook out but it didn't.  I checked the recipe to make sure the kind and amount of alcohol used was correct and it was.  If anyone has any insight as to what went wrong I would be happy to get hear it and try to get this one right!

I thought this was pretty good. I followed other reviewers and only added 1/4 cup of Wild Turkey. It did have a little bit of a strong ginger taste but I liked it. Served it with dirty rice and a salad. Thanks

Made this dish and found it to be delicious.  Made some changes based on other reviews; used lite soy sauce, reduced bourbon to 1/4 cup and stir-fried.  Didn't find that the bourbon was overpowering and will increase to 3/8 cup when I make it again. Thought that it might have been a little on the sweet side, so next time I'll try 1/2 cup loose brown sugar and see what happens.

This recipe did not appeal to me nor my husband.  It was way too salty even though I used the low sodium soy sauce.  The chicken was also very dry.  I will not use this recipe again.

Made this again (I wrote a review last year) for another Mardi Gras party and got rave reviews.  I used 6 lbs. chicken thighs, tripled the marinade recipe, used 3/4 cup bourbon total and used Sweet'n'Low brown in place of the regular brown sugar.  It marinated for 8 hours and came out great.  My guests kept saying - Wow this really does taste like bourbon chicken!!  The leftovers are going fast.

I have made this recipe several times and each time it comes out great.  I also only marinate the chicken for an hour.  I make it with garlic and olive oil noodles and glazed carrots.  It is a quick dinner if you prep it and it is delicious.

This is a great recipie.  My family loves it.  The kids love the sweet taste of the chicken. It is quick and easy and good.  I serve it with rice and a vegetable of some kind or a salad.

I thought the marinade was very good, but I would prefer to stir fry with the chicken.  Rather than bake it, because it would help to cook away more of the alcohol, and therefore it could be a more subtle taste.

I used cut up boneless chicken pieces, marinated for only an hour in the refrigerator, and cooked in a pan on top of the stove with a little oil and the marinade.  My whole family loved this, including our small children (2 and 4) who won't normaly eat much meat at all.

WOW!!  At first I was VERY worried because even though I like bourbon -- the original scent was very strong!  But it came out PERFECT!  It is my husbands new favorite meal (he's pretty picky) - he has been telling everyone about it! I did the suggestion of taking the sauce and adding corn starch for a gravy (yummy!) I then put the chicken over rice with brocolli with the gravy!  Fantastic meal! Worth trying it out!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did thin the bourbon was a little two stron but I marinated for 1&1/2 of a day. I will use eaither more brown sugar or less bourbon next time.  I cut mine into small peices and it cooked in half the time. I think I will also try reducing the sauce and ading some cream to the sauce.

This was great!!  My husband and I were looking to duplicate a bourbon chicken recipe from a local resturant and this was perfect.  We cut our chicken up into chunks before marinating and only had to cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  It was wonderful and have passed it on to all my friends.

Excellent!  It's really good on Pork Chops too.

After baking, pour marinate in a sauce pan.  Add about 1/4 cup of cream and simmer for about 10 minutes or so.  Makes a great sauce to pour over the meat.

I didn’t marinate it because I saw the recipe today and needed to make it for dinner today. I doubled the recipe. Maybe because I didn’t marinate it, there was not a strong taste of alcohol. After the chicken was done cooking I put it in a bowl and covered it. I put the sauce in a pan and boiled it for 10 or 15 minutes to reduce it a little. I poured half of it over the chicken and the other half in a pitcher to pass when serving.? It was good. I’ll make it again!

This wasnt the bourbon chicken from the Chinese restaurant,  but it was a very good recipe. I adjusted the recipe by adding a little more brown sugar, everything else was just fine. This has been added to my dinner lineup.

Best bourbon chicken I've had!   Only changes were fresh garlic and onion instead of powdered and added a smidge of red pepper flakes.   
I can't imagine increasing the brown sugar.  It was a perfect balance.   I'm not a drinker, but did not find the amount of bourbon overpowering.  This will be a regular for us!    I'm

I have been craving Bourbon Chicken for three years, so what the heck. Instead of just using chicken breast I mixed chicken thighs and breast meat the fatter dark meat gives a combo of favor change. I kinda failed my first batch over cooked the chicken but I held back half and baked it on temperature of 165 degrees F in inch cubes. I served it with steam broccoli and rice.

Not Bad!  Chicken was nice and tender, Liked the flavor, but it was just a little too strong and sweet for our tastes. 
Made half the recipe.  Cut the chicken into large chunks, marinated about 4 - 5 hours.  Cooked in the instant pot on stew/meat setting.  Done in 20 minutes. (10 to pressurize and 10 to cook).  Quick released pressure and served over rice.  Will make again but I'll cut the marinade with a little water just before it goes into the instant pot.  Don't want to reduce the liquids in the marinade or it wont come up to pressure.

It was good, but 4oz of soy is way to much. I added double the brown sugar, onion and ginger to balance it out and it turned out nice. Next time I would probably only use 2.5oz of soy sauce.

This recipe did not work out for me partly due to user error. Will be making it again.    I marinated this for 6 hours and it’s turned my chicken  black on crusty on the ends. I ended up skewering the chicken and grilling it which caused it to burn. Definitely bake the chicken and serve over rice which is what I am going to do next time.

Tasted great...with a few edits. Pound the chicken thin so it is a uniform thickness. I reduced the brown sugar by about 25-50%. Added red pepper flakes. I rolled and cut an orange thin slices and marinaded with the chicken. Quickly pan dear chicken in oil to seal. Bake with orange slices on top so juices drip through. With orange slices containing marinade, there is no need for basting. Also, when pounding thin, the chicken takes about half the baking time.

I choose this one because I was looking for a same day recipe. To be fare, I am sure if I had of marinated it overnight, I am sure it would have been better. The taste though was excellent. It was simple tp prepare.  I served it with rice and stir fried veggies. I prefer a saucier recipe  that coats the chicken.

Very Tasty and spicy dish ,i made it many times in my home and enjoy with my family they also loved it & Main part of this dishes is how to make the sauce.Sauce gives the flavor of this dish .For good smell you must use sesame oil And for spicy  you can use hot sauce and red chili . Thanks for sharing.

I never had bourbon chicken at the mall either, so have no idea how close it is to that but I loved it!

This was an amazing sauce!  I know nothing about mall food, but I can tell you this was delicious.  I had leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and was looking for a different use for it.  I made the sauce by itself in a saucepan.  I sauteed half of a chopped onion with half of a chopped jalapeno and two cloves of garlic.  Once soft, I added all of the other ingredients (exact amounts but I did use fresh ginger).  Once bubbling, I thickened the sauce with a cornstarch slurry then added the cooked turkey diced and served this with homemade cauliflower fried rice.  It was absolutely amazing!  I will definitely be making the sauce again to use with shrimp, tofu or to spread over salmon before baking.

I made this with whiskey instead of bourbon, and it was amazing! Took the advice of another reviewer to use 2 ounces of soy sauce and more brown sugar. Definitely going to try this recipe again with all my leftover whiskey.

I can’t compare this to the mall because I never get this at the food court although my daughters always eat it. I read the reviews and added extra brown sugar on faith and no regrets. I used chicken tenderloins cut into thirds and the cooking time was too long. My fault. I should have checked when basting. This is not an economical recipe in that bourbon isn’t cheap. Having said that, getting this at the mall with two teenage daughters would have cost me easily $1,000. I used a Dutch oven for cooking and will do that every time. I also used a vacuum sealer for the marinade. This recipe makes the rotation.

This was okay, but not a favorite in my house. I used a single mini bottle of bourbon and that seemed to be the right amount. The sauce was pretty good but it definitely didn’t turn out like the chicken in the mall. I cubed the chicken first and marinated it over night. My oven isn’t working so I’ve been using a countertop convection oven which does an okay job. I ended up dumping the chicken and sauce in a pan and finishing it on the stove, hoping to get the sauce to thicken up. I put some yum yum sauce on top after cooking and that helped, but probably won’t be making this version again.

I followed the recipe as written with the exception of bone-in chicken breasts.  I received rave reviews from my dinner guests and had no leftovers.  I served the remaining bourbon marinade to drizzle over the chicken breasts and mashed potatoes.  Basting every 10-15 minutes provides a flavorful glaze that is exceptional.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It goes to the top of my list for dinner guests.

Absolutely delicious sauce. I did a few substitutions however they weren't necessary just a preference thing. I used fresh garlic instead of powder and brown coconut sugar instead of brown sugar. For the bourbon I used jack. I only tried the sauce by itself but my partner had it on the chk and loved it. I am now planning a bourbon tofu for myself. Side note no it's not gonna taste like mall food court chk but why would you want that. This is so much better.

I found this to have a really strong liquor taste that I didn't care for. I made the marinade as directed and almost got contact drunk from smelling it, which worried me. So I started adding other ingredients to offset it. I added an extra 1/4 sugar, some crushed red pepper flakes and some rice wine vinegar from other recipe suggestions. I only marinated the chicken for six hours and then baked it. The chicken had a distinct liquor taste that didn't cook off but the marinade was good with rice. I thickened it on the stovetop using a cornflower

I agree with the majority of the reviewers, cut the bourbon in half and add more brown sugar.  You will need to use some kind of thickener on the left over sauce.  I used a zester on a ginger root and added just the tiniest amount.  I know I made this in the oven in the past and it came out delicious.  Last time I cubed my chicken and put it in a crock pot for 3 hours which was too long it came out a little dry- I pulled out the chicken, mixed some cornstarch into the sauce still in the pot and cranked it up to high for a couple minutes to thicken and had a nice glazy sauce.

I followed some suggestions in the comments. I substituted vanilla for bourbon and it’s nice. I also added ketchup for a thicker richer sauce. In the past I tried a garlic chilli ketchup. I think I may try fresh garlic in the future. A keeper! 4 stars only because I used the comments suggestions.

This was only average.  I used skinless, boneless chicken  breasts and should have tenderized them by pounding first.  They came out dry.  Of course,  most restaurants serving this dish use thighs/dark meat which doesn't dry out. 
Also I used a bit more brown sugar to offset the bourbon. 
May not make again.

Made this recipe last night, and was a huge hit!  Did adjust recipe  by cutting down to 2 oz. soy sauce (and next time will purchase reduced sodium); increased brown sugar to 3/4 cup; reduced bourbon to 1/4 cup and added 1 T. olive oil--this helped coat the chicken.  My daughter and I have been trying to duplicate the mall asian chicken and I think we hit on it! Thanks Lucy Loo

I was looking for a bourbon marinade for chicken and found this recipe. I wanted to make chicken thighs on the grill and gave this a try. It turned out really good. Had friends over for dinner and one bite in they were praising the chicken and my culinary success. Definitely a keeper!

The flavor of the marinade was INCREDIBLE. I followed the recipe exactly (except I doubled it) and the chicken had that amazing, rich, sticky flavor I associate with bourbon chicken. It tastes better than any other bourbon chicken I've had in restaurants; I was dancing around my kitchen. HOWEVER: I used monster-sized chicken breasts and basted thoroughly every 15 minutes but they still turned out DRY AF after 1.5 hours at 325. I used a meat thermometer while cooking and it did take the full 90 minutes to reach 165, but lord almighty they were dry. I think next time I'll chop the chicken into cubes, marinate 24 hours, and only cook for 45 minutes.

I tried the the sauce before I added Chicken. That lead me to believe I needed to add pineapple juice.  Also added a bit of hot sauce, two tablespoons.  We like it,but will add a bit of tomato sauce to give the sauce more depth next time.

This was quite literally the worst recipe I've ever made from this site. I followed the recipe exactly, and used jack Daniels for the bourbon portion. Marinated for 24hrs. It said to bake for an hour and a half but I only cooked it for about 40 minutes as the chicken was well past done at that point. Got excited and served it up with perogies and salad. First bite, I was almost physically ill, the taste of the bourbon is more than overwhelming, the chicken had a weird rubbery texture from marinating in the sauce, I almost felt I would have to grab some mix for my alcoholic dinner.

This was really really good! I pretty much followed the recipe, only used just 1/4 cup of bourbon.  I thought it was just right.  I served this with curried Jasmine rice, steamed broccoli and Italian bread.  Will definitely make this again.

It was quick, easy and pleasant to eat.  I used wings, because I do not like breasts all that much.   Also preferred to use root ginger and fresh onion and garlic.  Marinade better because of that.  Don't know that I would bother to make it again.  So many lovely chick recipes around.

I did this mostly like the recipe read.  I did use a tiny bit more brown sugar and a tiny bit less bourbon.  I used a touch more garlic and ginger.  But, other than that, this is what I did!  SO VERY GOOD!!  The "changes" I made were because I didn't measure well-I was in a hurry-so, the changes were very slight. I feel sure if you follow this recipe you will have a hit!  The basting is *important*.  I basted about every 20 minutes.

Made this with a little change. I looked around for this recipe on several sites and read a bunch of reviews. I ended up using this recipe but increased the brown sugar by a 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup red wine vinegar. Family loved it like this and keeps asking me to make it regularly.

I used 4 bone in skin/ on chicken thighs, baked @ 425 for 25 minutes, flipped them over and baked for 10, then flipped back and baked 10 minutes more. then I reduced the marinade until it was a bit thicker. YUM!! Great recipe.

I usually try to make any new recipe AS IS before I start making big changes.  However, I did half the amount of bourbon and cube/sauté the chicken due to time constraints.  I would caution people to NOT marinate the meat too long.  Mine inadvertently marinated for 48 hrs, which was too much.

Even with half the bourbon, the taste of alcohol was really strong though the extended marination likely contributed to that too.  It was really sweet as is, so I'm not sure that I would add any more sugar.

Overall, it was ok.  I may make it again and tweak it a bit.  Less marination, less bourbon, maybe add some broccoli to balance some of the sweetness...  It is not anything like the standard food court fare if that's what you're looking for.

I made this recipe with chicken thighs instead of breasts I feel if I would have used breast they may have been dry.  I enjoyed  this very much and it was so very easy to make served it with jasmine rice and a salad.  I felt it was very good, but it did not taste liked I have tasted on the food court I would make it again.

My whole family loved it! My husband saved the leftover sauce to use on his rice for lunch the next day. 
The chicken came out tender, juicy, full of flavor. I will definitely make this again, and again.

This was pretty good however like a lot of the comments seem to say I tweaked mine a bit. I used about half the required bourbon and added a little extra sugar and let it marinate. Then I floured the chicken and pan fried it in some olive oil and set that to the side, next I added a healthy pour of water and and a good bit of sugar to the marinade and poured it into the pan with a little butter and reduced it with some corn starch to help thicken then i mixed the chicken in and served it with white rice and used the leftover sauce for things like egg rolls/sides

Yes... I made changes. I normally don't. I've been picking my dinner recipes in the morning lately, gathering my ingredients, then rolling my eyes once I notice that a marinade is necessary. Ain't nobody got time for that.  I just pounded the heck out of it with the rough side of a mallet and then cooked without marinading it, ensuring that the chicken was drowned in marinade at all times. After the first 30 minutes, pulling it out and stirring it, I realized that I was going to burn it if I kept it up, so I put it in for two more 20 minute increments. When it was done, I took it out and made a mushroom gravy with the rest of the marinade and some added chicken broth. (Not a fan of rice, so I made mashed potatoes to go with it instead).  In another pan I tossed the  bourbon chicken around with some coconut oil and sesame seeds to make it just a lil' bit crispy on the outside. Yummy!  It was a hit. Will make again. I'll try the marinade next time. I still think I'll prefer it pounded and tenderized though.

The bourbon made the chicken a little hard. You could definitely taste the alcohol. I marinated for about 15 hours, and I also cut up the chicken into chunks while marinating, rather than leaving it as whole pieces. It wasn't bad, but I won't be making it again.

This recipe is a good base recipe, you can tweak it as you want. I substituted the bourbon for vanilla extract, because that's all i had on hand, and added less soy sauce, for a burst of flavor, i also added a teaspoon of chinese five spice. Will definitely make again.

did everything exactly like the recipe said to do, it came out very dry and even if it wasnt dry, the flavor is not good. too much soy sauce , can barely taste the bourbon , dont even know why there is a brown sugar ingredient, you cant taste it.

if you do this recipe, use way less soy sauce, and apply the brown sugar onto the chicken before you bake it so it properly glazes the chicken. it did nothing for the marinate/liquid to baste the chicken with

I like this recipe except instead of chicken breasts, I used boneless skinless thighs. The thighs seem to soak up the flavor better than the white meat so you get a juicy inside with a nice baked glazed crust.

This was a really good recipe as is. The bourbon flavor is a bit heavy but if you get a really good bourbon it works.  I made this with white rice and broccoli and saved some of the marinade and made a reduction, lightly cramalizing the brown sugar in it, (reduced by about half) and drizzled a small spoonful of the drippings from the cooking dish and a few spoonfuls of the reduction on top of everything and it gave everything a real beautiful light bourbon sweetness that brought the entire plate together without overpowering it.  The rice alone could be a meal.  Very good.

Delicious. Made it with no bourbon. I doubled the ginger, soy and brown sugar. Cut the chicken into pieces. Didn't marinate. Just put it all together and threw it into the oven. Cooked it for about an hour. Mix it around half way through cooking so the sauce gets into everything.

Served with Jasmine rice and a side of veggies. Even my six year old asked for more. Definitely a keeper! Thank you!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. Marinating the chicken overnight, made it very rubbery, and it was not very flavorful. It was expensive to make with the bourbon, so that was a bummer.

This was very good. After reading reviews, I also used 1/4 cup more of dark brown sugar, fresh minced garlic, grated ginger and 1/2 minced shallot. Marinated it overnight. During the last 20 minutes of baking, I added broccoli florets.  We had over Basmati rice. We will have this again.

We really enjoyed this.  It was pretty rich though so next time I'll make rice or something with it.  Also cook time was shorter. I used frozen breasts that were mostly defrosted by morning.  Cook time was about an hour.

I wasn't impressed with this.  It was good, but nothing I'd choose to make again over trying a new recipe.  Perhaps it was that I didn't marinate it, but honestly, I don't read recipes ahead of time.  I look at ingredients to see what needs chopping/dicing and determine how long it will take based on that and when I went to make this at dinnertime, I wasn't going to wait a full day for what I planned tonight.  I used chicken thighs and they were perfectly tender baking at 35 minutes at 375 degrees.

Hubby wanted something different for dinner, found this recipe and made the marinade exactly as written, only doubled. We marinated it for about 5 hours as we didn't realize it should be 24 hours.  We loved it and are looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow.  I will thicken the sauce with a bit of cornstarch so it will stick to the chicken next time and also marinate for the full 24 hrs.  We used chicken thighs as we prefer them to the breasts.

i was looking for a recipe similar to something called 'street chicken' at a local buffet that i really like. this seemed pretty close so decided to give it a shot. i read through over 100 of the reviews for it and a lot of the people made it in a a pan instead of baking. i was really wanting to follow it precisely but decided to cook it in a pan like everybody else. it turned out pretty good, i added a bit more brown sugar cause everybody said the bourbon taste was very strong, but it ended up tasting a bit sweeter than i had anticipated. it turned out good and i liked it though. will probably try tweaking it a little different next time. i'd recommend it. i've never had 'mall chicken' that everybody mentions, so i don't know if it's close to that or not.

Though the result was pretty good tasting, though very sweet, it was NOT the shopping mall bourbon chicken I've tasted.

I took some suggestions from other reviewers and modified the recipe by reducing the soy sauce to 2 oz, increasing the brown sugar to 3/4 cup.  I subbed Brandy in place of the Bourbon, as that is what I had on hand and I think it worked beautifully in this recipe.  I reserved half of the marinade before letting the chunked chicken soak in it for about 12 hours.  I cooked the chicken on the stovetop and when chicken was mostly cooked I added the reserved sauce to finish cooking.  I would not hesitate to make the same modifications when making this recipe again.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Lucy Loo!

Definitely didn't taste like the stuff in the mall. I really didn't expect it to but thought it would be close. Maybe I did something wrong. It had nice a flavor. I hate to say this since I love bourbon but some bites definitely tasted like there was too much bourbon. Thanks anyway but I wouldn't even attempt a second try to see if I can tweak it.

Yummy! I marinaded it in the morning not overnight and I used fresh ginger because I had some. It smelled so good I couldn't wait for dinner I scooped some out and made it for lunch I'm so glad I doubled this recipe everyone had seconds.

Not terrible but basically tasted like chicken marinated in soy sauce.  I did let it marinate for 2 days so that was probably a mistake.  I would cut back on the soy sauce next time.  You couldn't taste the bourbon at all.  May try again with a few tweaks.  Also would cook maybe an hr, chicken was pretty dry.

This recipe was a hit.  I did make a few changes.  I used dry ingredients along with  1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, 1tb redwine vinegar, 1/2 chopped onion, 4 garlic cloves minced, I used a 1/4 cup boubon and cooked on low in the slow cooker.   I thickened with cornstarch.  I would make this again.

Very tasty.  I used Teriyaki Sauce instead of Soy Sauce.  I didn't marinade mine because I did not have the time.  Instead I shredded the chicken and mixed the marinade into the chicken.  It was really delicious that way and I served over rice, so the marinade served to give the rice taste.

The taste was great but there wasn't enough sauce to have over a bed of rice.  When I make this the next time I will at least double the sauce ingredients.

"I don't recommend this one at all. I I cooked the chicken for an hour and it was way overdone. I basted frequently as directed but it still came out like charcoal. The marinade was pretty potent although the flavor was good. I would definately cut down on the bourbon also. Maybe y'all will have better luck than I did."

I made a copy of this review because exactly the same thing happen with me.
I also belived in the best review that was here and one more time I tried to made this changes but still no good.

Maybe it was the bourbon I used or maybe it was my expectations but this was awful! I don't like negative reviews without giving specifics but I'm trying to explain what I didn't like: First, the sauce burned in the oven in a glass 9x13 baking dish (if I would do over, I would put into aluminum foil packets). Second, the flavors didn't meld for me. I could taste bourbon, ginger, garlic, and soy sauce. It tasted "shallow". It needs something to add to it's richness but I'm not quite sure what. After eating one bite, I'm permanently cured of my desire for bourbon chicken so I guess that's not a bad thing.

I think this recipe has potential to be really good, but the measurements of ingredients really need to be adjusted for that to happen.  I thought the bourbon was overwhelming, I would use no more than 1/4 c. (and I think that's probably too much.)  I would also cut the soy sauce down to 2 oz. and add an extra 1/4 c. of brown sugar.  Not sure if I'll try this again even with tweaking the recipe.

I made it per the directions, with the exception that I used mostly vanilla with some bourbon.  I chunked the chicken and baked it in the over for about 45 minutes.  It was edible and we'll eat the leftovers, but it wasn't very flavorful.

I tried this recipe and was not pleased by my outcome. I was hoping for the same flavour and tenderness as the bourbon chicken from the mall food court. The chicken was flavourful but it turns out I am not a big fan of Bourbon.

I tried to make this the other night, I followed the recipe and the chicken turned out so dry. If I try it again I will follow other people's suggestions.

Smelled great while marinating. Taste like it came from a bottle. Not very impressed I would try it in the crockpot if I were to try it again

I followed the exact recipe but it did not taste anything like I had hoped ( the mall version). this was my first time cooking with ginger and I did not like the flavor so I think this is why my family and I did not like it.

I recommend getting a "poor" quality burboun, as the better quality have a stronger taste that can be overwhelming.

This was pretty good;everyone including my kids raved about it and went back for seconds. I diced the chicken up, and then let it marinate for about 2 hours. I added in a bit more brown sugar and sub'd vanilla extract for the bourbon. It didn't taste like the kind u get at the mall, but it was delicious. Will definitely make again and again.

I cubed the chicken and cooked it for 30 minutes but it came out a little dry - may be my fault.  I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 because I did have to add a lot of extra brown sugar.  The sauce was great on rice.

I didn`t have bourbon, so used white wine instead, so maybe it wasn`t as good as it should be. I followed the rest of the recipe, except I didn't have time to marinate overnight.This came out good, but nothing spectacular.

I made this but cut out the Ginger.  I think next time I will follow some others advice and cut out some of the Bourbon.  When I do that I am going to replace that with Sprite/Sierra Mist.

This was awesome!  Except for halving the recipe and using turkey instead of chicken I followed it exactly.  The flavors were wonderfully and it was extremely moist.  My husband didn't even realize it was turkey until I told him.  I will definately be making this again.

My husband and I thought this dish was pretty good. I didn't have any ginger so I left that out.  I let the chicken marinate for about 9 hours then I cooked it on the stovetop in my wok.  I served it with rice and chinese vegetable mix.  We will make this again! Also was a very quick dinner!

May or may not make it again.  It was pretty good, not AWESOME though.  I substituted minced onions for onion flakes, and I cubed the chicken before baking for 45 minutes.  If I do it again, I'll bake for a half hour, and increase the time if needed.  Bourbon wasn't overbearing, and it was sweet, but also not overbearing.

Forget the bourbon and substitute with 2 cups white grape juice, then add 2 tablespoons sesame oil, and 2 tablesoons oyster sauce.

I loved it and wouldn't change a thing!  Husband said he could taste the alcohol and was too sweet, so that's why I rated a four.  I'll definetly make again, but maybe when he's out of town...haha

I've made this recipe twice. The first time was this summer and I cooked it on the grill after marinading. It turned out pretty well, but I oversaturated it with the bourbon sauce. The second time was just last night, and I made it as instructed (Only, I cut the chicken into pieces first). It turned out well, only I think I cooked the chicken for too long. Next time I’ll put it in for about a ¾ of the time.

I really liked this. I did add a little less bourbon. I also made it in a crock pot, though the next time I do that I will double the soy sauce and not use nearly so much bourbon! For the crock pot I also added rice in, which I liked though the rice was sort of lost in the liquid.

I tried this recipe, but took the advice of another user as she said her recipe was just like the Malls. Sorry to say it was not even close. it tasted like French Toast!! Thanks to my son loving French Toast he still ate the chicken. I am still on the hunt for the closest tasting recipe to the Mall as possible. So far, no luck!!!

I love this recipe and I've made it a few times. I recommend reserving 1 or 2T (unflamed bourbon)and flaming the rest of the bourbon. Flaming the bourbon decreases the alcohol taste (but it also diminishes the overall flavor, which is why you should reserve some unflamed). I've tried the recipe with dried and fresh ingredients and of course, I say fresh is always best. It doesn't taste as good as the kind you can get at the mall (but that stuff is probably the most unhealthy version you could have).

This was very good.  I haven't had Bourbon Chicken in years, and was so happy to find a recipe that was not only good, but so easy.  The only thing I would change on this recipe would be to maybe cook it in a wok instead of baking it, but it was good baked!  Definitely going to become a regular on our menu!

This chicken was fantastic!  I followed the directions with the exception of using about 1/2 of the bourbon the recipe called for but found that it still tasted a bit too strong.  Thank you for sharing this recipe - I'll use it again.

Absolutely fabulous!  It was super easy to make and the compliments are STILL coming.  The only thing I did differently was purely aesthetic, I mixed up some brown food coloring and added it to the marinade.  It just gives it a deeper, rich color that looks more palatable.

Used only 1/2 cup bourbon and the taste was still too strong.  I used half the amount of soy sauce because people said it was too salty, tripled the amount of brown sugar, and it was not too salty this way, it was nice and sweet but just had too much alcohol taste.  Our whole apartment smelled of bourbon for hours after we finished dinner.  The chicken was extremely dry even though it cooked in the liquid, and I think this might be better if you cook the liquid first and let the alcohol cook out, then add the chicken and pan fry it instead of baking.  This was edible but we didn't eat a whole lot and I immediately threw out what we didn't eat.  I will not attempt to make this again.

A littl too salty for us.  I think it has a good over all flavor.  Next time I'll use a lower sodium soy sauce. I used Jack Daniel's whisky as well as fresh onion and ginger.  Also put a litt fresh minced garlic.  Served with brown rice and also broccoli.

chicken turned out on the dry side usuing all breast meat was a bad call, I think it may work better with thigh.

the sauce was okay, but the chicken was   dry. Maybe using chicken thighs instead of breast? or maybe fry instead of baking it

I used fresh ginger instead of ground stuff. Thought it really added to the recipe. And, of course, it's only good if Maker's Mark bourbon is used!

I cooked this just as it states and it was wonderful.  We ran out of chicken for dinner.  Everyone had seconds including my 11 year old son.  Its almost a teriyaki sauce.  I served it with fresh steamed buttered string beans and another recipe from of macaroni salad.

Excellent recipe.

I heat up a bag of frozen vegetables and put just the chicken in the pan to get it mixed evenly. Then I drizzle the marinade over top to keep the vegetables looking nice when presenting. Makes a very colorful dish.

My whole family (even my mother in law who is one of the best cooks I know) absolutely loved this recipe except one thing, 1 1/2 hours in my convection oven was too long, the chicken was very dry. I am going to make it again tomorrow night and cut down on the baking time.

This is a good recipe. I was looking for something that you'd find at the restuarant and this is good to work from.  I think instead of packing the sugar it should be in your cup lightly.  And I think I will add alittle bit of h20 next b/c it was very salty due to the soy and alittle dry, even with all the basting.

I used the marinate for kebabs on the grill.  Turned out wonderfully.  My husband thought maybe a little cayenne would be good but I am really not so sure.

I made this for mu husband's birthday and he said he liked it, but his expression didn't. I made it without the bourbon as some reviewers said and the result was very very salty. I also fried it instead of baking and added green onions to the marinade and as a garnish afterward. While pan frying, the brown sugar carmelized and smelled liek it was burning. It didn't taste burnt but I son't think I'll try it again... Not at all like the stuff in the mall. Maybe if I would have added the bourbon, it would have been better... I'lll never know.

I found the name of this to be deceiving...maybe it should say Asian in the title because this definitely has the same flavor as the chicken at my local Japanese steakhouse.  It wasn't too bad, but it wasn't at all what I expected.  I didn't care for the intensely sweet flavor.

This chicken was very good!!!!  I might use a little less bourban or try a different brand.  I used Rebel Yell and that just might have had a stronger taste than other bourban.

I added more bourbon and it was great. I've made it several times and each time it has been eaten and there were no left overs. I also made a little gravy/sauce with the juice that was left from the marinade.

I used cut up chicken breasts in the recipe and only marinated for an hour or less.  Cut cooking time down a little.  It was excellent.

EXCELLENT!  My non-chicken eating husband enjoyed it twice in one week!  I'm thrilled with it, especially good with chicken thighs which tend to be less expensive.  A real keeper in our house!

Excellent chicken!  Changes: chunked chicken, used 1/4 C Jack Daniels, marinated 12 hrs, broiled chicken and marinade in 9 x 13 until no longer pink. If you enjoyed this, try Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs.

Really yummy.  I like the fact that the marinade has no oil.  I cut my chicken breasts in half and cut the cooking time down to 60 minutes.  I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.

This recipe was terrible!  I was so excited to try it and when I finally did it was so bad we had to go out to dinner!  Way too much alcohol, and the cook time was too long.. the chicken was like leather.  Maybe less bourbon, more sugar and it would be OK .. but I'm leary to try it again.

IF you like Bourbon...this is the recipe for you, if not, I do not recommend it.  The men in my family liked it, I did not care for it. I cut the bourbon back to 1/2 cup (because I read previous reviews), but still it "warmed my throat" going down. I did not find this recipe similar to that served in shopping malls.

This was horrible!!  I only put in half the amount of bourbon the recipe called for and the tase was still too strong.  I only cooked the chicken for 1 hour and WAY overdone.  I'll never make this again!!

With this recipe, I think you have to really like the taste of bourbon. I don't like the taste or smell of it...and found preparation and cooking very difficult because of the strong aroma it gave off. If you are planning to make this recipe, I suggest you like bourbon to begin with. I am sure the local "mall resteraunt" does not use real bourbon.

Heaven!  Plan ahead to marinate overnight, but it's worth it!

Had this last night for dinner-it was ready in no time.I also did not marinate this overnight,but for a half hour before I put it in the oven.I would recommend boiling the leftover juice in a saucepan until it carmelizes,then serving it over the chicken.It was very good!

I loved this recipe and had been looking for one for a while! We had enjoyed Bourbon Chicken in restaurants, but never found a good recipe.  This one was great.  I did make one change, though.  I cut the chicken breast in chunks prior to marinating, and then fried them on medium-high quickly until done.  This gave the chicken more surface to soak up the marinade so each piece had a ton of flavor! It also made it a quick dish to prepare.  After marinating throughout the afternoon, I fried it in less than 10 minutes.  My two boys (7 and 1) loved it, too!

I loved Lucy Loo's recipe.  I have served it three times already.  I prefer to snip the chicken into bite sized pieces prior to baking.

The bourbon Chicken had an excellent taste to it. I did not even let it marinate overnight!  Mary Gatlinburg,TN
