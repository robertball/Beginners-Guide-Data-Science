Here is a very helpful hint to everyone who seems to be having problems rolling the balls.  My trick is to have a glass of very hot water sitting beside the mixture and also a small bowl of confectioners sugar.  I dip a spoon into the hot water then scoop the mixture with the spoon and drop into the sugar.  I then coat the ball with sugar and roll into the balls.  No mess at all!!

This is the recipe that my mom got from her greatgrandma, that we made throughout my childhood and that I use each year at Christmas time with my family. The only difference is that we don't measure anything. We use an entire 1 lb bag of powdered sugar, a regular size bag of coconut and a regular size can of sweetend condensed milk.

As for tips:
1. place the dough in the fridge or freezer before you roll them to make it easier. 
2. If you use a cookie sheet covered in wax paper you can roll the balls then store in the freezer so that they don't soften while you are dipping small batches. Which can then be placed back in the freezer to harden. 
3. make sure that the balls are fairly small in size or once you add the chocolate to the outside they will get too big, try a few different sizes to find what works best for you before you roll out all the dough.
4. the bon bons also freeze well, you can leave batches in the freezer and pull a few out (or eat them frozen - yum) when you want a little treat or have company coming over. 

Good luck! You won't regret making these!

I had trouble with the tooth pick dipping part. They kept falling apart, off the pick into the chocolate.  I had to change technique to manage a shape & put an almond in the center of each ball (since the toothpick method was not working for me this time around) and coated one side at a time, allowing each side time to firm up.  It took more time but was worth it.  I made this for my mother, she loves coconut, wanted to surprise her.  I brought a container filled.  The next morning there were 2 left :)  Up shot is, they tasted great, like the candy bar. I am making this for my mother again.  I'll have to work on technique, read up on tips and practice, practice, practice.  Thanks for the recipe.

To all those having trouble keeping the balls on the toothpicks, try putting them in the freezer for an hour instead of the fridge. They will get firmer and hold on to the toothpicks better. This recipe is just like my favorite candy bar.

The "dough" is very sticky. The trick is...pat your hand in confectioners sugar every now and then to keep the dough from sticking to your hands. Works like a charm!

Definitely put dough in freezer for an hour or so, and it helps to freeze the little dough balls on a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper before dipping them in chocolate.  I like dipping mine in the melted candy wafers you use for candy making, and I prefer to use white instead of chocolate.  It also helps to place the dough balls on a fork and dip into the white chocolate, sliding the fork against the side of the bowl to get the excess off and place on waxed paper.  Depending on the holiday, I'll sprinkle little candy decos on them before the chocolate firms up to make them prettier.  Like Valentine sprinkles, or Christmas ones.  Just a few suggestions.

Ive been making these for years , but misplaced my recipe a couple years ago , so I was glad to find this one . I separate my filling into small portions , freeze at least an hour , then work with one portion @ a time . I like to form little log shapes with mine . I thought there was no way to improve on these until the year I tried butterscotch instead of chocolate chips ...wonderful !

These taste wonderful! They are very sweet so make them smaller. It wouldn't roll into balls so I added more powdered sugar to thicken and put it in the fridge for 1/2 hour and then rolled into balls and refridgerated again until ready to dip! I adorned the top of each one with whole almonds.

These were SO good!  I let the mixture sit overnight.  They rolled out pretty easy.  I think it is easier to just dig in and use your hands.  Let them sit in the refrig after you dip them.  They get too mushy if they sit out at room temp.  They set up nicely after they are complete and cold!  I will make these again!!!

Amazing!  These taste just like Mounds bars.  They are SO good and were rather quick to make too (I used the freezer to speed up the setting up process).

Just like I always made with my Mom at Christmas!  I also use the simple, no measure recipe...1 bag coconut, 1 pound powdered sugar, 1 can sweetened condensed milk, 1 tsp of almond extract.  I also found a fork works much better than a toothpick.  Freeze for an hour, place on a fork and dip in the chocolate.  Shake off the extra chocolate and slide off the fork with the tip of a sharp knife.  I found this is much easier than a toothpick and I tend to get less of a puddle or "feet" of chocolate.

Made these as is at first. Rolling this sticky mess into balls was almost impossible and the balls kept sticking to my hands, the wax paper, and was losing their shape. I almost threw the whole thing out but decided to take a break and come and read suggestions and reviews. Lots recommended more coconut and I ended up adding double the amount, until the mixture was workable and retained a shape when pressed. I was able to roll all the balls one after the other without greasing, dusting or having to wash my hands during rolling.  I could have dipped the balls in chocolate almost immediately.  Most important, I know now the balls will keep their shape on a serving tray.

I have a similar recipe from my grandma. Making the bon bons really isn't as difficult as other reviewers make it out to be.  Follow reviewer Jeanette's advice for amounts. The recipe as written doesn't have enough coconut or sweetened condensed milk. I put all ingredients in my kitchen aid and mixed it up. You need the mixture to be a paste that can be rolled into a ball, much like the mixture for peanut butter balls. If it looks too gooey add more coconut, don't add more powdered sugar. I refrigerated the mixture overnight and had no trouble rolling into balls. I put the balls on a waxed paper lined cookie sheet and refrigeratd for about an hour before dipping in chocolate. After dipping in chocolate I put them back in the refrigerator to set. These are really easy to make and they are delicious!

I love this recipe!  I read the reviews first making it.  I made the coconut mixture (added a little bit more coconut) and refrigerated over night then rolled them into balls the next day.  Put them back into the frig until the chocolate was ready.  I had no problems at all and each one looked great.  This was a great hit with everyone.  I will definitely make it over and over.  This is a keeper.  Thank you Tamme

Roll them small for just a single bite, and top with festive sprinkles. I froze the coconut balls for about an hour before dipping and they came out beautifully. 

I also added some dark chocolate to the semisweet, to cut some of the sweetness of the filling. 

I followed many reviewers suggestions and cut the amount of powdered sugar and doubled the coconut. However, this combination made waaaay too much for my needs, and I only ended up using half of the coconut filling mixture. Next time I will halve the recipe.

I love these!  I accidentally used a full can of sweetened condensed milk, so I had to add more coconut and powdered sugar.  I then chopped almonds and mixed them in the filling!  Fabulous!  I dipped in Ghiradelli dipping chocolate.  mmm.  Love these!

These were delicious. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was a little too sweet for us. (maybe personal taste). I will definitely make them again with a little less sugar next time.

I love this recipe, but it takes along time to roll into balls, becasue they are so sticky.  I found the easiest way to solve the problem, I used a pair of latex gloves, what a difference. If they get sticky, just dip into a little powdered sugar. This will cut your roll time into minutes, instead of an hour.

I have been making this same recipe for at least 10 years.  How much easier it would have made my life at the busy time of Christmas to have known about the hint of lightly rolling the balls in the powdered sugar after placing in the freezer a few hours, ingenious!

These are delicious. I found a white coconut flavored chocolate bar and melted it with a dab of shortening. Dipped some of the balls in that and some in a good quality bittersweet chocolate. I also found a bag of Toll House Cherry flavored chips and I am going to melt some of those tonight and dip some of the balls in the cherry. Never had coconut & cherry but it sounds good to me. I found that all this works better if it is kept cold. Make a few balls and stick them in the freezer before you try to coat them. Keep the dough in the fridge, make small batches at a time. When it starts getting too sticky then it's not cold enough. Patience pays off with this recipe. In case you buy your powdered sugar by the big bags, 3 3/4 cups = 1 pound.

I made these to put out on Christmas Eve and they were a HIT! I will make them every year. I am not a huge coconut lover but these were super! I think they taste better than Mounds Bars! I did refrigerate the dough before trying to shape them into balls and it worked PERFECTLY!

Almond Trouble
These are SOO awesome! IF you are having trouble with the almonds, try mixing coarsely chopped almonds mixed into your dough, much easier and taste just like the candy bar! I usually split the dough and make half with nuts. You can drizzle white chocolate or put sprinkles on the ones with nuts to tell the difference.

These are delicious treats! I added almonds (chopped fine), and to aleviate the stickiness, try scooping the "batter" out w/a small cookie scoop (they work like an ice cream scoop)...works great!
Also...wrap the cocount ball around a whole almond...tastes just like an Almond Joy!

This is one sticky mess.  To help cut down on the stickiness, I chill the mixed coconut nuggat for at least 2 hours.  Then, using a cookie scoop, scoop out the balls and place on waxed paper on cookie sheet.  Then return to the fridge over night before dipping in chocolate.  This makes it so much easier to handle the nuggat.

These are very good.  The second time I made them, I cut the sugar, condensed milk and butter in half, added about 1/4 teas. of vanilla, and increased the coconut (sweetened) by a half of cup.  I also used special dark chocolate chips.  These changes made them even better and task very much like Mounds candy bars.

I would have loved to give 5 stars because these were fantastic but only after I made modifications. I used almost 5 cups of coconut and only 1/2 pound of sugar. Turned out delicious. Though a bit messy, with well greased hands generously covered with powdered sugar, not that big of a deal.
I didn't have to refrigerate the balls before coating them. I used a shallow bowl, microwaved the chocolate, dropped the balls in with a spoon and rolled them around. With a couple of minutes in the freezer they were ready to eat!! My kids and husband were begging for more.
I hope this helps anyone having trouble with this recipe! Very tasty! Thank you!!

These are so good!  I used 60% cacao chocolate chips instead of semisweet and they were perfect.  They are easier to roll into balls cold, but I just used a little cookie scoop and didn't worry about making them into balls.  Yummy!

These are wonderful and fun to make.  NOTE:  I would recommend adding a little extra powdered sugar and refrigerating the dough a bit prior to rolling into balls to reduce the stickiness.  Skip the double boiler and microwave the chocolate/shortening at reduced power. I love these, and I'm not even a huge coconut fan usually!

I really liked this recipe because it was so easy.  I ran into a couple problems as others did rolling the coconut mixture into balls; I used a mellon baller to start and then just briefly rolled the pieces.  Also, I added 3/4 cup extra coconut and think next time I will add a total of 1 & 1/2 C extra coconut.
I found I had to keep reheating the chocolate because it takes a while to coat all the balls and the when cooled the chocolate solidified.  I got 56 pieces.  I pushed an almond into each one before dipping in chocolate.  Yum!

I got rave reviews on this recipe when I made these.  They were quite popular at my school's cookie exchange.  However, I didn't pay close enough attention to the recipe and I added the whole can of condensed milk instead of just a cup so I had to compensate with more powdered sugar and coconut.  They turned out well anyway!  Very good! Very rich!

I press mine into a cake pan and freeze.  Then I cut into squares and dip while frozen. Then place on waxed paper.   Half of them I sprinkle with coconut the other half I press an almond into. Do it quickly because the chocolate firms quickly. The squareness distinguishes them from my other round dipped candies also.

Great! I would add a little more condensed milk and coconut. Just to make it a little more chewy. Also I prefer it with milk chocolate just like the candy bars! So easy to make!

These taste just like Mounds bars. Would be great with an almond in the center as well. Kind of difficult to dip. Might be easier if they were frozen before dipping. Mine ended up looking more like patties than balls. Keep refrigerated so they maintain their shape.

My Mother and I made these for Christmas and they were so good. Tips: Put powdered sugar on your hands when rolling balls, this keeps them from being so sticky. After inserting toothpicks put balls in freezer for about 30 minutes before dipping, if balls begin to fall off put in freezer for a few more minutes. Remove toothpicks immediately after dipping before chocolate dries this keeps you from having holes. I use a combination of almond bark and fondue chocolate, the combination is amazing.

Sure, it's sticky to roll into balls, but powdered sugar on your hands help that.  I froze the balls for 2+ hours and had no problem dipping in chocolate.  These are delicious, rich, and so easy.  This recipe does make quite a few and I recommend making small sized balls, as it is so rich.

I have to say, I was surprised at how good these were.  I am giving it 4 stars only because I think the measurements are off.  I left out a cup of the sugar, doubled the coconut and used dark chocolate for the outside and they were still a bit too sweet for me and my tasters.  But with a bit more tweaking, these will be delicious.  They are easy to make (but no one will know).  A must for coconut lovers.

Thanks for a good recipe.  My only complaints are that for me these were a bit too sweet and didn't have enough coconut.  Next time I will take the suggestion of other reviewers to add about 1 and 1/2 cups more coconut and may use slightly less powdered sugar.

I had to almost double the coconut in this recipe because the mixture was so thin. But even after adding all the extra coconut I still couldn't roll it into balls. It would have been better to drop them off a spoon onto the waxed paper because the mixture was sticking all over my hands. Also there wasn't enough chocolate to cover all the balls so I just left the last 10 plain. I thought the outcome resembled bounty bars only sweeter. My boyfriend will not eat the chocolate covered ones because he finds them too sweet but he really loves the plain ones. I think I'll just look for a macaroon recipe for next time. This recipe was too messy.

Reminds me a lot of the Martha Washington candy my Great-Grandmother and I used to make when I was young.  About the only difference is that these don't have pecans and that did.  Also, the recipe called for wax to mix with the chocolate for dipping. LOL!

I took these to a Christmas party.  Everyone loved them!!  I used extra sweetened condensed milk because the coconut seemed to dry.  I also froze the balls for one hour before dipping them in chocolate.  They taste really great if you freeze them after you put the chocolate on and eat them right out of the freezer.

These were super gooey and really hard to make. I guess I would add more coconut or sugar or something to make them thicker and easier to dip. Even frozen they were pretty gooey. I added a couple of shreds of coconut after dipping to the top to make them prettier. However, once done, so yummy! Like a Mounds Bar, except better!

Great Recipe. Everyone loves them. I agree with the other comments.  I increased the coconut to one 400 gram package of cocunut- about 4 cups, cut the icing sugar down to half a package of icing sugar- therefore about 250 grams.  I also add a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and almond flavouring.  It is easier to refridgerate them for about an hour before rolling. To make it easier, I spooned the chocolate over them and it gives them real homemade look.  Can add a mint chocolate chip on top or any other item such as nuts or sprinkles.

Delicious.  Tastes just like candy from a Russell Stovers box.  A little time consuming and frustrating with the dipping.  Freeze for 30 min before making balls. Make small balls, they get considerably bigger once dipped.  Very rich.

Well... I hate to give any recipe a three that tastes so good but the time to make these made me dislike them. This recipe made twice as many as indicated and therefore needed twice as much chocolate to coat them all. I had to freeze the dough before and after rolling them for it to all work. But everyone said they were delicious. I have to admit I couldn't even taste one after having to look at them for 3+ hours.  So my rating is the average of 5 for taste and 1 for ease of making. Sorry.

I made these for Christmas and they were beautiful and very easy.  They tasted just like the old-fashioned Bon Bons I remember from my childhood.

They didn't turn out like balls at all. They were flat and thin. They were delicious dont get me wrong however I highly suggest freezing them and not just putting them in the fridge and make sure you use real butter and not spread!

These were decadent and laid out more like a truffle than a cookie.  The condensed milk makes this cookie intensely sweet, giving me the perfect opportunity to drizzle some good quality bittersweet chocolate on top.  It complimented the sweetness perfectly and asthetically.  Folks went out of their way to let me know the bon bons were awesome.

The description says it all..."balls of joy"!  I got more compliments on these from all of my Christmas goodies this year!  I'll be making these BEFORE Christmas, for sure!  May add a whole almond in the middle next time.  And beware....it makes more than 3 dozen!

My family has made these for years. You can make them with a maraschino cherry center for an extra treat then tint white chocolate pink for the outer layer. We also some times added chopped pecans to the filling...we always used a small scoop for perfect portion control.   You can lightly butter your hands when rolling the balls so the filling doesn’t stick to your hands.

TOO MESSY !  I made the recipe exactly as stated but when I went to roll into ball it was way to sticky.  Wouldn't even roll just stuck to my hands.  I added another cup of powdered sugar and another cup of coconut and was still sticky.  I tried to roll into balls by dipping them in powdered sugar and they rolled easier and them put into empty egg carton and put in freezer.  I had to freeze them 18 at a time but after adding the extra sugar and coconut the I had close to 60 balls and way too sweet.   I won't be making again.  too much trouble and too messy

I hadn’t thought about the chocolate being a problem but found out everything I had on hand was not certified gluten-free. I had some GF cocoa powder and mixed it with powdered sugar for a quick fix. But next time I’ll be better prepared.

I followed the recipe exactly- except that I did chill the dough overnight (just cuz that was convenient). Otherwise the dough would be a gooey mess to work with. I used an icecream scooper, rolled the balls, chilled again, then dipped. The kids had fun decorating. These taste exactly as described- very sweet, soft, taste like Mounds candy bar.

I love these, and could not find my own recipe so this was  a great find here!  Based on what I had and what I've done in the past, I used semi-sweet  chocolate chips instead of the baking chocolate squares.  You can also use unsweetened chocolate -- it's a little tougher in the  first bite, but the great taste of the dark chocolate and the very rich inside make a great taste!!  I used butter to grease my palms from time to time to make the balls easier to roll.  In years past, I've had chocolate coating recipes that use paraffin instead of shortening.  Sounds gross, but a little paraffin goes a long way to making super smooth and glossy chocolate, and keeps better in room temps -- doesn't get greasy or melt, and you really don't notice a difference in taste.

These are good but mine came out a bit too sweet. It doesn't say if you should use sweetened or unsweetened coconut. I used sweetened but I would suggest to either reduce the amount of sugar or use unsweetened cocount.  A tip for dipping - use a fork - they can sit easily on top of it but the chocolate can flow through the gaps.

I made these and after reading all the reviews, picking the bit tips for rolling the balls, freezing and the coating in chocolate, what a dream!!!! The family had some at room temperature, but I put the rest in a box in the freezer! They were rock hard, but they still didn't last long. The family loved them......looks like I'm going to have to make some more next weekend. My advice is give it a try, and if the family really don't like them, I bet the neighbours will!!!!??

Great recipe! I made these for Mardi Gras for my French class since I needed a gluten-free treat and these are just perfect! Incredibly sweet though- definitely needed a drink to get them down! Refrigerating the mix before trying to shape it into little balls helps a lot and keeps down on the mess. I froze mine for storage and they're great chilled!

This is a little tip for dipping.  I freeze the balls before dipping, on cookie sheets lined with wax paper.  As I dip them, I place them back onto the wax paper and cookie sheet.  This makes it easy to pull them off and they cool off faster too.  I just use bacon tongs to lightly hold the balls as I coat them in chocolate.  Or, drop them in and fish out.  I don't add shortning to the chocolate either.  I also add chopped nuts to half my mixture.

We never used condensed sweet milk, just regular. I think it helps lower the sweetness factor. We made these every winter along with peanut butter balls. I remember my mom also used bittersweet or unsweetened chocolate(with a little wax mixed in). Don't use anything but real butter in the candies or don't bother.

The only way this recipe would work is if you were making these in a walk-in fridge. The sticky mixture needed to be in the freezer for at least a few hours to guarantee it keeping it's shape as balls. But even when dipping it into the chocolate, it starts to melt. The melting mess was delicious, but definately not presentable! If you've had your heart set on something coconut and bite-sized, I suggest making coconut macaroons instead. I'm determined to come up with a better coconut bon bons recipe!

Wonderful recipe. I added more coconut (about 1/2 C) and would not use as much confectioner's sugar next time, but these got rave reviews from everyone who tried them.  Thanks for a great no-bake recipe!

Even non coconut lovers loved these.  Easy to make, though messy and sticky.  definently have to keep these little balls of joy refrigerated.
Fantastic!
