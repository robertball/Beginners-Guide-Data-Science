I used FF half and half and FF plain yogurt because that's all I keep in the house. My kids didn't even notice. I split this between the both of them and they inhaled it. Then asked me to make another. This is perfect to jumpstart a busy morning.

Drats, I just saw another reviewer mention lemonade instead of orange juice & ding, ding, I totally skipped over that :) It was still devine!! So fresh & refreshing. I only had skim milk & I had to add more to get my blender going. I used Splenda & love the addition of the vanilla. I've frozen cantaloupe before for smoothies, but didn't realize watermelon freezes well. Thanks!!

This was so good! I made a few changes, though. I use lemonade instead of orange juice (that was what I had on hand) and omitted the vanilla (I didn't have any) It was very yummy and refreshing! Next time I make it I will make it the correct way. Thanks, Nobody'sGirl for this wonderful recipe!

Next door neighbor just invited me to join her on her deck for an adult beverage on this fabulous September day. I happened to have some watermelon that was getting a little over-ripe. Worked perfectly in this! I left out the vanilla and yogurt and put in 1/4 cup vanilla flavored rum! Yum!!

Watermelon, of course, is full of water – and I wanted a more intense watermelon flavor with the strawberries.  So I pureed it, and after doing so I allowed the solids to settle and then poured off the water.   It worked great!  Instead of yogurt and cream I used homemade strawberry ice cream.  I left out the orange juice because to be honest I think its flavor is too bold and detracts from other flavors. I forgot to add the vanilla but I didn’t miss it.  Since I had neither the water from the watermelon nor the orange juice, I added half-and-half to compensate.  This was wonderful.  Hubs couldn’t put his finger on what was in it and called it almost like fruit punch. (Did I mention I threw in some frozen raspberries with this too?)  I liked this more than most I’ve made which, frankly, are getting kind of boring.

This is pretty tasty!  The fruit blend is fantastic.  This is a perfect way to get rid of leftover fruit, especially those pieces that are still good to eat but don't look pretty enough to go into fruit salads, etc.  I also used lemon juice as others suggested and instead of plain yogurt (we never have plain in this house), I used all cream although next time I will just use all parts milk for less calories.  The other thing I would say is give this a good taste test before serving because its all going to depend on your fruit, whether it needs more or less sugar.  Mine needed a tad more sugar.  Last thing is don't let the 1 serving thing fool you.  With that "one serving" I had enough for me, my husband and my toddler!

I had not-very-sweet strawberries and an under-ripe watermelon, but once I put everything together it was GREAT!  I will definitely make this again.

Very good smoothie recipe that I will make again. I honestly forgot the orange juice when I made this, but I will add it in next time. I love that it is light on the watermelon. A great way for us to use up watermelon. My fridge was packed and my watermelon and strawberries froze, so this worked out great. Delicious!

I used milk instead of cream, and roughed the amounts of that and the yogurt. Great after a walk on a hot day!

Our weather has been so cold lately that I had picked out a hot chocolate recipe for my kids to have today, but we had a balmy 65 degree day, and everyone was in the mood for smoothies instead.  My watermelon wasn't frozen, but this turned out great.  Everyone loved it!

Yum! Creamy, sweet, cold, fruity . . . this is great. The orange came through a little stronger than I expected. I'd be curious to try lemon or lime juice next time instead.

I am having this right now as a dessert! It is divine! I did use lemon juice instead of orange juice as other reviewers did, and substituted the sugar with Splenda to cut the calories! DELICIOUS! I can't wait to make this again on a hot summer day!!!!!

This strawberry-watermelon smoothie was fantastic! Like most other reviewers, I did make some minor changes to the original recipe. 
-Replaced cream with lowfat milk
-Used Greek yogurt instead of plain yogurts
-Added slightly more vanilla
This recipe is definitely a keeper & I highly recommend it!

Made this for the residents where I work. They love it. I eliminated the cream and double the yogurt. It made it thick so it was more like a frozen yogurt than a smoothie.

Reading a few other reviews I’ll play with this smoothie again. Had frozen strawberries on hand – used fresh watermelon – BUT will freeze some watermelon simply for these smoothies. I used stevia extract instead of sugar, store brand plain Greek yogurt and store brand unsweetened almond milk. A lot of dairy clogs up my respiratory system. In recent decade or so – I substitute soy or almond milk over traditional milk a lot. Did not have orange juice on hand – but will use at least a little lemon if I don’t have orange juice next time. This is quite delicious

DELICIOUS!! And kid approved too! Had to make two minor subs bc of what I had on hand (plain coffee creamer for the cream, sweet grapefruit juice for OJ), and also added more vanilla just for our own personal taste. I did have to add a little water to get it to blend, and after adding a little at a time (may have been up to 1/4 c or so) it finally blended into a nice shake/smoothie consistency. This was fantastic. A++

Great combination of flavors, so refreshing in the heat of the day!  Though we did not add the cream, just a bit more juice.  Thanks for a great summer smoothie, Nobody'sGirl.

What a nice light smoothie. I wil definitely be making this again.  I made a few changes.  I had my watermelon stored in a ziploc bag and ended up adding some watermelon juice which helped b/c I had used frozen strawberries so there was not as much liquid.  I also used stevia instead of sugar and it tasted great.  Also used the lemon and it added a nice brightness to it.  Next time I may add a little bit of mint.

This was delicious! I modified it a little, instead of cream I used organic coconut milk and I was out of orange juice so I threw in a small handful of frozen mango. All the sweetness came from the fruit!

I think this is a fantastic concept! Perfect for a muggy day! I did not use cream (I didn't have any on hand) so I used more yogurt; I didn't even miss the cream! Instead of plain yogurt, I had vanilla. I didn't need to add any sugar or vanilla extract. So good and refreshing!

This was a yummy way to use up excess watermelon taking up premium fridge space. I used lowfat milk instead of cream and no vanilla because my yogurt was vanilla flavored; but it was greek style so I added extra orange juice to get a less thick consistency. I also used agave sweetener rather than sugar (no need to worry about it dissolving like there is when using sugar). Even my very fussy daughter liked it. I agree with another reviewer that this more like 3 servings or 2 very generous ones. Even though I really like this smoothie I could never drink all of this as a single serving.

Loved it!  Very flavorful, and not too heavy.  We could actually taste both the watermelon and the strawberries, and the cream gave it a nice smooth flavor.  It was a bit too thick so I added milk as I was blending.

Will absolutely make this again!  A new favorite for us.

This is a very good and easy recipe.  I subbed vanilla yogurt for the plain yogurt and vanilla.  I LOVED the addition of the cream.  Perfect consistency and very refreshing!!  Thanks for posting your recipe, Nobody'sGirl!

This is a very refreshing smoothie!  

I used lemonade, like some other reviewers said and honey in place of the sugar, and I didn't have frozen watermelon so I used fresh watermelon and added 6 ice cubes, but it still came out just fine!  Oh, and I added a banana too!!! The recipe made enough for two of us, so I doubled the recipe for four of us.  

This one has already been added to my recipe box!

There is yummy in my tummy! I used almond milk instead of cream, opted to swap the sugar for honey and didn't add the vanilla extract. The flavors blended well I only wish I would have made more!

Delicious and refreshing.  I did use lemon juice and omitted sugar.  I felt it was sweet enough and enjoyed the tartness from the lemon juice.

Oh I love this recipe. Although I must admit I didn't follow it exactly but used what I had on hand such as: Apple Juice for Orange, another scoop of yogurt for heavy cream. Next time though I will definitley try Orange Juice instead of apple. What an awesome recipe though! Refreshing and awesome for the summer!!!

Good but not great - not a lot of flavor (even though my berries and watermelon were both juicy and sweet by themselves), at least without the sugar.

I made changes only because I was using what I had on hand. I used vanilla yogurt, heavy cream, fresh watermelon and strawberries,  & lemonade and a few ice cubes. I also added a couple of basil leaves. Next time I will probably freeze the fruit and omit the ice cubes for a less diluted beverage. Still, this is delicious.  Adding fresh mint leaves would be a nice variation.

I made this for Val and Al and both seemed to really like it.  I also enjoyed it.  Tom said he would rather have a slice of watermelon.  Go figure.

I thought this was pretty good. It is a pretty pink color too. I have never had a smoothie made with watermelon. It is an interesting combination. It reminded me of watermelon bubble gum in flavor. I made 1/2 recipe and it made plenty. The only change I made was using agave for the optional sugar, vanilla Greek yogurt, and adding 2 ice cubes because my watermelon was fresh and not frozen.

Delicious, light and summery way to use up frozen watermelon.  I had a few minor adjustments - I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain since that's what I had on hand, and low-fat milk instead of cream to cut the calories.  Next time I might include one additional tablespoon of orange juice to give it a little more tang.

Wonderful, but I did have to make some changes.  I didn't have cream and I only had vanilla yogurt so I used 1/2 cup of the vanilla yogurt in place of them.  I used 2 tbsp Splenda instead of sugar.  When I blended it, it was too thick so I had to add some skim milk until it was able to blend.  It was a thick yummy smoothie that my little girls loved too.  Loved the flavor!
