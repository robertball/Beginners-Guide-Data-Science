This recipe turned out fantastic!  I didn't have any bread (for the crumbs) so I used an english muffin.  It worked great.  Also didn't have crackers so I used the second english muffin crumbled on top with a little melted butter drizzled on top.

Absolutely yummy!  A definite keeper at my house especially since it was so forgiving of my lack of all the 'correct' ingredients.

This turned out very good, the whole family loved it! I only got one complaint and that was to much pepper. I will definitly make this again with just a little less pepper. Loved it!

This did not turn out very well, my husband wanted to know what it was he thought it was fish.  It was very bland and had a strange flavor.

I used cut up pieces of bratwurst instead of ground sausage and cornbread craker crumbs. The casserole was Yummy and very filling. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this for a breakfast casserole at a MOPS meeting. I guess it didn't look appetizing, because it wasn't even half gone.  I love corn pudding and loved the idea of adding meat to make it a meal but as is the sausage is all I tasted. It's a lot of meat and if I make it again I think it needs more eggs, some cheese and maybe an onion and peppers cooked with the meat and some spices but then that's a whole other recipe right?

I love corn casserole and this recipe put a new twist to it.  I put this together the night before and popped it in the oven when I got home from work.

Needed more eggs. I used homemade sausage and it had all the seasonings it needed.

This was very fast, and the whole family loved it. The only change that I made was the bread crumbs. Instead of soft bread crumbs, I used Italian regular bread crumbs and the body and taste is wonderful. I would tell a friend about this one. Very pleased.
