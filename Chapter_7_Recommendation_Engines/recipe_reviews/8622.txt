I made this recipe but decided to make it on the stove top and not in the microwave.  I cooked the onion, curry, apple, paprika, butter and chicken all together and seasoned it with salt and pepper. Once the chicken was nearly done, i added some sweet green peas, the soup, milk (instead of thick cream) and a bit of water.  I let this cook on medium for some time to reduce the liquid and let it thicken.  It turned out absolutely delicious and i served it over penne.  My husband and 4 year old thought it was great.  Probably was alot more difficult than in the microwave....but i wanted the meat to be browned.  I will make this again.

Wonderful tasting recipe. Kept the ingredients the same but cooked it stove top. First sauted the onions until almost clear, then cooked the chicken with the onions and mixed the spices, then once chicken was cooked added the apples and cream of mushroom soup and last the half & half. Cooked for another 15 minutes when it was thickened.  Didn't need the butter.

This was really, really good!  I sauteed the onion & apple in the butter and then mixed it in with the soup & spices.  Poured it over the chicken in a baking dish - cooked @ 350 for 1/2 hour covered and 15 minutes uncovered.  I think the apple just brings out the flavor of everything.  Will make again & again.

So easy, so fast! I didn't have the mushrooms or heavy cream, so left out the mushrooms and used 1% milk. Of course it wasn't as rich tasting then, so I stirred in a couple of tablespoons of mango chutney which changed the flavor but I liked it as well. I think this might be one of those recipes that can be altered with what you have on hand and still be delicious!

Wow! I made the stove-top method as described below.  I used cut up frozen chicken tenders instead of chicken thighs, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup milk instead of cream.   My 3 children (8, 8, & 9) gobbled it up and wanted more. They liked curry - so I was pretty sure they would like this dish.  It was a definite hit!  The curry flavor isn't too strong like in some dishes and the mushroom and apples are a wonderful complement to it.  Thanks Lucille!

Delicious and very easy to prepare. I made this in the stove top - sauteed the onion in butter, then mixed the chicken with the spices and added to the pan. I covered it, and when the chicken was almost done I added the apples,cream, soup and mushrooms.
Will definitely make this one again!

This recipe would be great if you use the correct ingredients I am sure.  When I made it, I used things around the house making the following changes:  1)Instead of heavy cream I used sour cream.  2)Used italien seasoning instead of curry -> thus lacking in flavor

Easy! and really good. I was home alone tonight & had a rogue thigh left over in the fridge. I followed most of the recipe for 1 serving, except for using 1% milk & fat free sour cream since that's what I had on hand. I will try this next on the stovetop; I think sauteeing the onion & browning the chicken will add even more flavor. Oh & I cut up some green grapes at the end!
Added 1/23/10: I made it on the stovetop - delicious! I followed some of the comments: sauteed onion in butter, browned the chicken with curry, S & P, then added the apple, plus celery, a handful of chopped broccoli & peas (both frozen) with soup and a random mixture of half/half, milk, water. Let it simmer to cook the rest of way (~20 more min.) & thicken. Served over couscous. We loved it! Next time I'll add cubed potatoes.

This is really good. I did as others suggested and did it on the stove top. I think I will try it in the microwave after browning the onion and chicken. I used evaporated milk and 1% milk as I didn't have any cream. Was still rich and yummy. I suggest rice as the gravy is great. I think next time I will put more chicken parts in it. Definite keeper!

This was awesome! I too cooked it on the stovetop, substituted 2% evaporated milk for cream and threw in a handful of frozen sweet peas. Then I served it over couscous that I had mixed with raisins and almond slivers. It is was a big hit and will definitely become a regular. Next time I'm trying it with shrimp!

This was great. My husband was skeptical about the apples but ended up liking it as well. I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and milk instead of cream.

To make this recipe more heart healthy I used reduced fat cream soup, 2% evaporated milk and left the peel on a granny smith apple.  I microwaved whole, skinned chicked thighs, covered with wax paper, for 10 minutes.  Then transferred them to the sauce cooking on the stovetop to finish cooking.  The recipe had good flavor.  Cooking the thighs in the sauce from start to finish would have made the sauce too runny.

Needs more kick.
Cooking time way, way too long.  Only needs about 20 minutes tops, stirring every 5.

Wonderful!!! I used milk instead of cream, used skinless whole chicken thighs (too much work to cut the meat off)and cooked in a skillet instead of microwaved.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again.

I cooked this on the stove-top as did the others.  My curry lover thought was delicious even without the mushrooms and onions.  I added cooked egg-drop dumplings after it was baked (2 cups flour, 1 tsp. salt, 4 eggs and 1/2 cup cream.  Blend, then drop dough by pieces into boiling water for 10 minutes).  Delicious!

I've tried quite a few curry recipes, most of them complicated.  This one is easy and good.  I, however, don't trust microwave ovens (old-fashioned, I guess), so I browned the chicken, partially cooked the sauce in the microwave, then baked in the oven.

This was a tasty weeknight dish.  I made it with bone in thighs on the stove top. I sauted the onions and the apple in butter, then added the chicken.  I followed another poster's advice and waited until the chicken had about 15 minutes left and added the soup, half and half, and curry.  I really like the taste of curry, so next time I will use more. I used healthy request cream of mushroom soup, half and half and canned mushrooms. It thickened up nicely. I think it would be a really fast easy recipe with boneless thighs or breast, if you just reduce the cooking time.  I made minute rice and  put the curry sauce on top.

I have the worst luck making meals in the microwave, so I made this on the stovetop.  I omitted the sliced mushrooms because my husband is not a fan, but this was still delicious.  This is a keeper!

Oven baked. Added madras spice and a bit of garam masala. Used extra mushroom soup, didn't have any fresh mushrooms. Delicious!!! Easy to make.

The best curried chicken I've ever had and it was pretty easy!  The only thing I changed was that I did it in a frying pan instead of the microwave, I pre-fried the mushrooms to get some of the water out of them and I seered the chicken in the frying pan before adding it to the sauce to finish cooking, otherwise I followed it pretty much to a T and it was outstanding.  Thank you!!!

Wonderful!  Just what I needed -- quick, easy, delicious.  I was nervous about doing chicken in the microwave without browning, but it came out tender and moist, not rubbery. My only change was cooking time -- 20 minutes was plenty, stirring every five minutes. I used Penzey's spices --  "Now Curry" and Smoked Paprika -- luscious.  I look forward to making this with other veggies (esp. zucchini  and eggplant) and with tofu instead of chicken.

This is an excellent recipe. I have made it quite a few times and have had people who don't even like curry like this recipe. I use cream of chicken and fresh mushrooms vs. the cream of mushroom soup as I am not a big fan of the cream of mushroom. Definitely worth a try!
