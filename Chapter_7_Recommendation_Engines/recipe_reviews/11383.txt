This is THE BEST peanut butter cookie recipe EVER! People who just SEE them comment on them, not to mention the raves I receieve when people TRY them. You will RUIN this cookie if you make it ANY smaller than the recipe dictates. I roll the dough into balls about the size of golf balls. This makes for a very light and beautiful cookie, but the center is still moist and slightly chewy. If you are looking for a trendy, designer, questionably textured PB cookie recipe, do not bother with this recipe. 
If you are looking for a big, thick, old fashioned, perfectly textured cookie that will have your husband and co-workers eyes lighting up when they see them for the first time...go right ahead and ENJOY the compliments!
Adam, THANK YOU so much! This is forver my PB cookie recipe!

This recipe is delicious!   The cookies are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, not to mention they look great.  The recipe is kind of expensive to make because you have to buy a box mix as well, but the results are fabulous.  The mix I bought did not have a separate package of peanut butter in it (as referenced in the recipe), so I simply added 1/4C more peanut butter, next time I might even try 1/2C).  The cookies turn out beatifully.   I rolled the cookies into 1 1/2" balls, and then pressed them with a fork.  I was able to get 9 cookies per sheet, and the recipe made approximately 5 dozen.  This recipe won't dissapoint you.

Every time I've made this recipe, it yields way more than it says it will. We entered "36 servings," printed and made the recipe, and ended up with over 170 cookies! These are great peanut butter cookies, but don't trust what it says about servings!

These cookies were o.k.  The list of ingredients was very long and they were time consuming to make.  They tasted pretty good, but was looking for a better cookie.  I actually found the perfect PB cookie recipe on the Betty Crocker website...they were fabulous.  Crispy and chewy and just the right amount of peanut butter.

I have been using this site for years now and this is the first time I have rated any recipes.  This peanut butter cookie recipe was great.  I really loved it as did my family and friends.  It made a ton of cookies.  The only thing I did different was use a sugar cookie mix instead of the peanut butter one.  I added extra peanut butter to the recipe and they were truly delicious.  Thank you so much!!!!

I took them to work and people enjoyed them. It makes way more than 18 cookies, tho! I rolled the dough balls in sugar before I cross--hatched them.

Dubbed "The Best Peanut Butter Cookies Ever" by my friends, these are really super good and pretty. I usually add some chocolate chips to the last half of the dough for variety. Even better!

YUMMY!  These cookies are light, but they don't break apart easily.  Would be wonderful for dunking in chocolate?) milk!  The recipe yielded 7 dozen 3" diameter cookies instead of 3 dozen.

I have wanted to try this recipe since I saw it,however,I must say that the ratings kept me from doing so...Until yesterday...I had a Betty Crocker mix and wanted to make more cookies,so I used this as an extender...That truly is what it is...I made 60 huge,bakery style,melt in your mouth cookies!I had only 3/4 cup peanut butter though,so I ended up replacing 1/4 of butter for a portion of the shortening...I have always liked the shortening/butter mix...It gave it a better flavor...I baked on parchment paper for 8 minutes...They don' appear done,but they are...For crispier cookies,bake 10 minutes..They will start to burn on the bottom if you bake any longer than that...TRY THIS RECIPE...I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE SORRY!THANKS ADAM!!!

My husband and I really loved these cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly, however, my Betty Crocker PB cookie mix did not come with a PB packet. It was all dry ingredients. I simply added the mix to the flour mixture as the recipe suggests. I did not add any extra PB as other reviewers did. I'm not sure if I went too small on the cookie size but mine made a huge batch: 100 cookies! The author wrote that you might have to finish mixing by hand, but my mixer was able to handle it through to completion. Great recipe! Thanks!

I can't tell you how many times I've made this recipe, they are great. The butter flavored shortening is very important. One time I didn't have any so I used regular, they were good, but not as good with the butter flavor. I am making again today for our family reunion tomorrow. Every time I've made these, I've had many compliments. Who cares if you need the cookie mix, if they're good, that's all that matters. Of yeah, I can't find the mix in the box any longer, so I use the bag one and add a decent dollop additional of peanut butter, still great.

I made these for a work party, and they were gone in no time! This recipe makes a lot - I got 6 dozen. I kept a couple dozen at home. They seem to "age" well - the first day they are crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle, the second day they are deliciously flaky, and the third day they are nice and crunchy. They always taste fresh. I highly recommend!!

These are very good and I'm not a huge peanut butter cookie fan.  They do take a lot of ingredients...but they were worth it.  1-1/2 - 2" balls make huge cookies.  I scaled them down a bit.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it really was pretty good.  However, it did not quite have the "wow factor" that I was expecting.  There isn't anything that stands out in this recipe to warrant using the ingredients plus the extra expense of the mix. A good cookie, but it doesn't knock your socks off at all.

Amazing and makes a ton of cookies!! I add semi sweet chocolate chips because I searched for a recipe that would combine the 2 types of cookies and be soft and chewy but crisp and perfect these are that cookie, Sometimes I add pecans as well. I do not roll them into balls I use a cookie scoop and drop them and bake like a regular cc cookie

These were really good, but my package of cookie mix didn't come with peanut butter, so I added 1/4 of a cup. I don't think it was enough. The cookies are a wonderful texture, just didn't have that rich peanut butter flavor I was craving. It was kind of a cross between a peanut butter cookie and a sugar cookie. My husband LOVED them, and the batch made enough for our family, two neighbors and my husband's office, so I think it's worth another try. 8 minutes in the oven was perfect.

These were really good cookies-the recipe made a lot.  They are soft and chewy but have crisp outer edges-not dry at all.

For someone who's not the biggest fan of PB cookies, these were great!  A friend requested them for his birthday, and I had so many extra that I took them to work.  Several people asked for the recipe and keep telling me that they're the best cookies they've had in a long time.

These are the best peanut butter cookies we have ever made! They stayed moist for a week. The batch was huge--we had plenty for neighbors and still tons left over! It made at least 6-7 dozen! You need a large mixer to make this recipe.

Baked PB cookies for the first time, so I took the cookies to work and guess everybody loved it.  The cookies were gone by the lunch time.  Thank you Adam for the recipe!
