We double the recipe and make this in a 7 by 11 glass dish and place it between us.  Using Cholmondley's English Muffin bread, toasted, we mop up every last drop.  So tasty.  Thanks, Chef John.  Another hit!

Great recipe! Made it for dinner for my gf and she loved it.  It's almost like huevos rancheros but marinara sauce is better IMO. It's salty and sweet with a nice basil finish. Will use more basil and some pressed garlic next time.  I skipped on using cream and it was still yummy.  Make sure you don't  over cook the yolk.  The yumminess of this dish depends on the consistency of a semi-oozy yolk.  Watch the video! Thx Chef John!

Yummy, yummy, yummy. What a splendiferous recipe! I saw the video the other day and felt that I had to try it. I did not measure the ingredients but added them by eye. It's so simple that you can only really go wrong if you overcook the dish or burn the toast! I just had it for my dinner and am wondering if it's too greedy to have more or if I even care about that! I did take mine out of the oven just before the yolks had set as the eggs carry on cooking in the heat of the ingredients. Perfect!

Well now, I tried this yesterday morning.. I made a double batch for me & hubby.  I didn't have any ramekins or other shallow dishes, so I used a French white oval dish.  I followed the directions and was sooo looking forward to a wonderful breakfast!   After 10 mins., I checked the eggs to see if they were done.  The whites didn't look set to me, so I checked it again in 3 minutes.  Then again.

   I decided that it was now or never!   With great anticipation  I set the toasts on a plate and brought our eggs to the table.  Well, as I tried to mix the yolks into the whites, I saw that they were more solid than loose.  But of course you already surmised that they would be, right?  (My next least favorite thing is semi-hard yolks).  We did eat this creation but really never tasted egg, just the sauce, which was pretty good - but not what I expected!  

I believe that the dish I used, because of the height, did not allow the eggs to cook properly.  Whatever the cause, I don't think I'll try this one again.  Chalk it up to user error!

We had breakfast for dinner the other night, so I decided to give this a try.  I made it exactly as written, but used fresh basil instead of parsley.  I  sprayed my baking dish with non-stick cooking spray first and assembled as the recipe indicates.  I ran into a problem trying to figure out if these were done.  I thought they still looked too giggly after 12 minutes, so I left them in the oven another 3 minutes.  Big mistake.  I should have taken them out at 12 minutes, because after 3 more minutes, the yolks were cooked through.  They were still delicious and I’d certainly make this again.  We both enjoyed these with toasted English muffins and crispy bacon.

Easy and divine! I made two changes though. 1) to make these in individual ramekins - makes it easy to serve and it looks fancy....and 2) I placed a slice of ham over the tomato sauce and then broke the egg into it - adding cream etc on top of it. Thanks John for this tasty dish.

Delicious!  Made in individual ramekins the night before.  Left them in the fridge overnight and baked them in the morning for a quick, tasty breakfast before running out the door to work.  No prep in the morning needed :).

I give this recipe 5 Stars!!!  It is really good!!!  This was also easy to make!  For fun I added fresh tomato, red pepper and green onion minced and added to the marinara sauce.  I used a very simple marinara sauce.  I tried making a low calorie version with no olive oil and nonfat plain yogurt instead of the cream.  It was still awesome!!!  Watch this carefully and make sure the yolks don't cook too much.   My husband loved this and told me to add this to my list of great recipes!  I will definately make this again!  Thanks Chef John!!!

First, I have to say (again) how much I love Chef John's videos!! And his recipes! I made these baked eggs as written, and they are delicious. I just now made them again, but with a Mexican flare using Goya Recaito (cilantro cooking base) and it's another hit! I think you could use any sauce/spice/cheese you like and it will come out great. Thanks again, Chef!

WOW! Fabulous and so so easy! You can serve a crowed all at once. I used ramekins. Big big hit at home. Great gourmet breakfast on a Wednesday morning.

Need to put a note on why to use the ramekin for the eggs before adding to sauce.  This is so you don't get any shell in the sauce from cracking the eggs.  If you're supremely confident you won't accidentally get shell in, then crack directly into the sauce.  Tried this morning and these were great.

Absolutely delicious! I just made this for lunch for my son and myself and we both love it. I'll be trying it on his father tomorrow morning for breakfast. I'm pretty sure it'll be a hit with him too. I made it as the recipe called for as much as I could but didn't have the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese so used another kind. My cream was cereal cream but it all worked well.

I've never had huevos rancheros, so I can't speak to whether it tastes similar, but this was really good. I had to make a couple of substitutions to make this work with what I had on hand, and to keep this fitting into my current dietary requirements, but even so - it was delicious! I don't have any ramekins, so I used a deep metal individual sized pie tin, lightly greased and it set perfectly in this. I also substituted the cream with a cauliflower puree - gave it that wonderful creamy texture but I didn't miss the real cream at all! The cauli puree has many variations but what I used today was: Approx 75g frozen cauliflower pieces (thawed first), 1 tsp powdered chicken or beef stock base (optional, but I wanted it to be more savory), 2Tbsp milk (I use low fat, but use whatever you have on hand - I've tried almond milk before and found it tasted more sweet than creamy though), 1/2 tsp oil (I like olive or macadamia nut oil but I suppose any will work), 1/2 tsp minced garlic - I used my bullet blender to puree, and added water along the way to get to desired consistency. Then add to recipe in place of cream. I will definitely make this again!

This dish is amazing!  I could eat it every day and my husband loved it just as much as I did.  It was incredibly easy to make, although I did leave it in the oven a little too long and the yolks were cooked through.  But honestly, it still tasted great!  I made the dish exactly per the recipe and watched the video, which was very helpful.  For the marinara, I bought the best Pre-made sauce I could find.  So yummy!!

This is a wonderful dish.  Simple and quick, I was just looking for an easy lunch and was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this was.  Who knew baked eggs could be this good?   I recommend watching the video before making this dish to view a few hints.  Served with toast points, this is a keeper.

I LOVED THESE! I used fresh basil instead of the parsley. Hubby didn't care for them, but I had a feeling he wouldn't, lol. I thought the flavors were wonderful and they could not have been easier to make. I will def be making these again (for myself, lol)! Thanks for sharing. :)

Oh. My. Word!! I made this for breakfast this morning, because I didn't want another bowl of oatmeal!  I had all the ingredients on hand, and had been wanting to give this a try!  I had even purchased the baking dish at Wal Mart days ago, just for this recipe......Can  I just say that it was amazing!!  I almost didn't need to wash the dishes....the toast was perfect for getting the last drop of the marinara sauce!  The best part of this dish, is there was no mess to clean up!  The flavor of the egg,  marinara, heavy cream, the red pepper flakes, the fresh Parm.......
Did I say....Oh. My. Word?!?  Thank you chef John ,  you inspire me daily!

YUM! I tried this recipe this morning and loved it! I omitted the red and cayenne pepper and the cream, reduced the salt and used jarred sauce (Classico Tomato and Basil) and thought it was still too much spice for an egg dish. I'll probably try crushed tomatoes with basil next time. I baked it for exactly 10 minutes, in the toaster/oven and let them set up, on the counter, while I made my toast and they came out perfect! I wish I'd remembered to buy English muffins... I think they'd be great with this.

This is absolutely delicious.  But if like me you are picky about exactly how your egg is cooked, it is much easier to control the egg if you poach it and then pour the other stuff (hot) over your perfectly cooked egg.

My leftover marinara sauce had some sausage in it which was a great addition.

It is no longer "baked" eggs, but it is still wonderful.

I really liked this!  I'm not a super-hero cook and found it quick and easy to make.  I added a spoonful of the marinara sauce on top and another sprinkling of cheese about a minute before I pulled it from the oven - awesome!  I think I might try it with alfredo sauce as well!

Totally delicious! I used a glass pie dish, so definitely did not measure anything (did it based solely on looks based on his awesome video) and it fit about 3 eggs (although I wanted to use 4, my husband convinced me only 3). Also, my marinara sauce was a homemade version that was SUPER meaty (ton of ground beef and a little bit "spaghetti" squash). I omitted the heavy whipping cream and pepper since my husband has a sensitive stomach right now; although I think it could only make the dish better. Super tasty, will definitely make this again when I have more left over marinara sauce!!!

Nice recipe.  Don't leave it in more than 10-12 mins.  It will continue to cook after you remove it from the oven.

This recipe is DELICIOUS. My whole family loves it. I have a hard time getting the eggs cooked just right(so the yolk is runny but not RAW). Im going to try preheating the marinara sauce in the oven before I add the rest of the ingredients next time. Wish me luck!

These were very good.  I used pizza sauce and went heavy on the red pepper because I like the spice.  Pretty rich breakfast.  I wouldn't eat it often but was a nice treat.

I did not care for the marinara sauce. I was expecting something spicy with the reference in the description comparing it to huevos rancheros. This DEFINITELY didn't cut it.

This recipe is awesome! I double the recipe.  My husband and I put it in one 9X13 glass pan, put it between us, and use tortillas torn apart to sop it up right out of the dish! We don't care too much for marinara sauce, so I substitute Pace picante sauce that I blend until smooth. This has been one of our go-to dishes for years! Great huevos rancheros!

Thank you Chef John - this is an excellent recipe. We used home made bread, free range eggs, and flat leaf parsley from our local Farmers Market and the result was awesome. Definitely a keeper of a recipe and we appreciated the video.

This was great.  I didn't add the cream though, didn't understand the purpose of the cream with salsa and oil. I'm going to make this for supper one night so my hubs can enjoy it as well.

Oh...my...goodness!  Best...breakfast...ever!  This was so easy to make and the reward is so great!  I must try this with company!  I easily knocked 90 calories off the recipe by using half the oil and cream.

One word - YUM!!!  Made this for the first time last night and am tempted to make it again tonight.  Hard to believe but my husband who likes everything said he "could eat it" if I made it again.  In future I'll be making this fabulous dish just for me and he can have PBJ instead!  The only change I made was to omit the heavy cream because we're counting calories.  I did not omit the olive oil because it's so good and so good for you!!  Thanks Chef John!!!

Lovely, easy dish for supper. Be careful of the red pepper flakes if you are sensitive to spice. A little goes a long way. Also, as many other reviewers have said, be cautious about the baking time. In my slow oven, it was about 14 minutes till the eggs were done to my taste. Thanks!

This is delicious. 
Important to note that this is a Spanish, as well as Portuguese, recipe. When cooking from other cultures it is important to give tribute to them.

Love this dish, it's one of our lazy Sunday morning specials, when we sit around till noon reading the Sunday paper from front to back.  I make this according to the recipe with an addition if I happen to have it and that's a tablespoon of chopped spinach added over the marinara sauce.  I don't always use the same type of dish, so it has to be checked often to make sure the eggs are still jiggily or they will "set" quickly at that temperature, a hard egg is not good in this recipe. Sometimes I leave the cheese off too and just give the top a light skim of cream for "shirred" eggs. The recipe is very versatile. 
 Try it with salsa in place of the Marinara, a few sauted sliced mushrooms a couple of eggs, a small handful of shredded Jack cheese and a dash of cream, all in a small 7 or 8" au gratin dish. Same temp, same time.

Thank you for posting an easy, tasty recipe for baked (shirred) eggs. I followed the recipe closely and found it most accurate and satisfying. I did stir in a some leftover chopped bacon into the sauce for added flavor. Your video was nice too!

I just made these for lunch and they were simply awesome!  I used jarred spaghetti sauce and followed the recipe exactly except I used some fresh oregano, parsley and basil from my herb garden and I added a sprinkle of shredded Italian cheese mix. I overcooked the eggs a bit, but they were still delicious and will be able to judge better next time.  The time definitely depends on the temperature of the eggs and the size of baking dishes.  My eggs were straight from the refrigerator.  This is a fantastic, gourmet-tasting quick lunch or dinner.  Be sure to have some good bread.  I toasted some semolina bread.  YUM!

huge bang for minimal effort! super easy and fast and friendly to all kinds of recipe tweaks. didn't have marinara sauce, so used extra chunky hot salsa instead. the addition of some pan-fried, sliced bratwurst turned it into a brunch main with heft!

My husband just loved this easy receipt. I on the other hand wasn't too fond of it maybe it was because it was served for breakfast. May be better for lunch or dinner.

I love this recipe!  We have this very regularly.  I always have the ingredients on hand and it is quick and easy to make.  Serve with toasted bread or garlic bread -- a must.  Watch the video and cook just as Chef John says.  Trust me...it's good!

Mmmm, so good!  Easy and quick too, you can't beat that.  I'm glad I watched the video, it helped to determine when the eggs were done.  They will continue to cook in the pan after taking it out of the oven, so be careful not to overcook them.  It tasted like pizza sauce, so Hubby liked this too.  ;)  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks Chef John!

I loved this so much, I may fix it again for lunch and dinner!  I used a local brand tomato/basil sauce, and skipped the olive oil and cream, altho I'm sure that's good too.    This was SO MUCH BETTER than the expensive restaurant breakfast I had yesterday with friends.  The next time they want to meet, they can come here and I will fix this for all of them and it will still cost me less than what I spend on just MY meal (which was NOT GOOD) yesterday!  Thanks for this one!!!

Oh my!  How yummy was this?  I had only small creme brulee ramekins so they would hold only one egg each.  I'll for sure shop for something slightly larger so I can cook two eggs for each diner.  I love that I can serve this individually.  I'm wondering if perhaps, I may change it up a bit....how about, salsa to sub for the marinara and crumbled queso instead of the parmesan?  At any rate, it was very tasty.  I acquired 4 hens on Easter weekend and need egg recipes....we are collecting 2-4 eggs per day so recipes for eggs is my focus of late.

Quick, Easy, Delicious!!  I added a little fresh basil with my parsley as suggested in his video. I am glad I did as that was a delicious addition. I haven't tried a recipe yet from Chef John that I haven't enjoyed.  Thanks Chef John, and keep the recipes coming.  I also have found several recipes on Chef john's food wishes blog.

Ohhh Yum! These are really, really good! Did mine in the toaster oven @ 400 for 10 minutes, came out perfect. Will be making these again and again. My Mr. didn't want to try them (old school bacon and eggs kind of guy). He doesn't know what he is missing. Thank you Chef John.

I doubled the recipe and it took longer to cook, I screwed up a little and the egg yolks cooked through so they were hard, but we still loved it. I liked the addition of the red pepper and I added basil. The video was also very helpful in making this.

Love this recipe!  True comfort food for the morning!  You really have to watch the eggs when it gets closer to time because they will go fast from being perfectly cooked to overdone.  And the best part about it is the yummy egg goo that spreads out all over when you dip in your toast!

I scaled this recipe up for my family of 4 and used a 9x11 dish to cook it. It took a little longer for the eggs to get to the right consistency (about 15 minutes) but it turned out well. I used minced fresh basil and flat leaf parsley as the fresh herbs. I also went to 3 stores and could not find Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese so I ended up using a Parmesan-Romano blend... worked well too.

Wow!  I was browsing for something completely different and came accross this recipe.  Watched the video and could not resist running for the kitchen.  Had all the ingredients except the cream, so used creme fraiche I made a week ago.  What a wonderful taste combination....and so easy to make.  I also did not measure anything and it came out well.  Next time, I will take the eggs out after 10 minutes.  My dish was a veavy ceramic and the egss continued to cook, so they were a bit more done that I like.  Will make this again and again.

I was at a complete loss finding a 1/4" deep baking dish.  1" ramekin was the closest I came.   I ended up using a deep saucer and it worked nicely.  I was worried about the depth of the dish keeping the egg from baking properly.

Everyone I made these for gobbled them up, plates clean. I didn't even get any myself but figured if they were that popular they must be good. Am planning on making some just for me in the near future.

So delicious! The first time I made it, I overcooked the eggs and ended up with more of a boiled egg... still, it was so delicious even like that, that I knew I had to try it again.

The second time, I used 5 eggs in a 9x11 pan like another reviewer suggested. We had a salad while we waited for them to cook, then plunked the whole thing on the table and ate it with toasted French bread. Absolutely delicious!

I’ve never attempted baked eggs before and, to be frank about it, all the onions and peppers in  Huevos Rancheros just turns me off. This Italian version on the other hand is absolutely amazing!!  Still, it will never replace Eggs Benedict. C’mon now.

I used Pace hot salsa instead of marinara, as I find most jarred sauce too sweet. I also added some Italian seasoning, but think I should have stuck to just fresh basil. I grabbed the half and half instead of heavy cream by mistake, so it changed the consistency but I would definitely make this again!! Topped it with a little cilantro and green onion.  Burned my mouth multiple times because it was just that good.

Picky BF loved this! Used traditional spaghetti sauce b/c it's what I had on hand. Skipped black pepper b/c I'm allergic & substituted the parsley for fresh basil. Combined the cheese, cream & oil 1st before pouring over the mixture. Only suggestive criticism was that eggs were runny (I cooked for 12 mins). He does not like eggs too runny so I may cook a bit longer next time

Wonderful! I've never had baked eggs or huevos rancheros so didn't know what to expect - but these are terrific! I was a little too generous with the sauce, and again, not knowing how long to bake an egg in my oven, they were a tad overdone, but still just delicious. I'm doing them again today!! I think you could probably play a little with the type of cheese used, or possibly add mushrooms...yum!
11/9 - OK, now I've tried Swiss cheese and cheddar cheese at different times- still great. Added one finely sliced, uncooked mushroom - still great. Left out the olive oil - still great. And, because of dental work, put untoasted cornmeal  English muffins on top of the sauce, and under the eggs, cream and seasonings. (Try lots of onion and garlic powder somewhere in the mix.) The thick, tomato sauce from the World's Best Lasagna recipe was really yummy. Just make sure there is some type of sauce as the first layer - it sticks terribly otherwise. Even using the olive oil as the first layer didn't quite work, although you can leave it out of the subsequent layers.
Just a wonderful recipe! Good for a simple, quick dinner, too - when it's 9:00 PM, you still haven't eaten and there's nothing in the fridge.

I've made this dish about 20 times now.  And I love it. Sometimes I make a spicy marinara just so I can have these eggs for breakfast for the next few days.  Having said that, eggs are eggs and they are fickle.  For the first attempt I under cooked the eggs out of fear of over cooking.  Second time, overcooked.  Third, perfect.  I still don't get them perfect every time.  I find I get better results if I get the marinara up to room temp before cooking, but sometimes I forget and the eggs are already in the dish.  I usually start checking the eggs for doneness around 10 minutes.  My point being, if you make this recipe and the eggs are over or under cooked, try again.  A recipe is a guideline, not an exact science. Also, eggs will continue to cook once you've removed them from the heat.  Eggs are a delicious, fickle food and this recipe is worth the experimentation.

This recipe is so good and simple!  I have made it in a casserole dish by making twelve "wells" with a spoon and pouring one unbroken egg into each well.  The eggs stay separated while cooking and it is so easy to remove each individual egg for separate servings with a spatula.  I place each egg directly on a piece of toast and spoon a little extra sauce from the casserole dish over top.  This recipe has received rave reviews from all who have tried it in my kitchen!  It will be my breakfast brunch "go-to" recipe this year!  Thank you!

I don't care for runny eggs and am cautious about just set eggs. However, this recipe intrigued me for some reason and I am glad I gave it a try. It was delicious! Definitely going on my keeper list. Thanks Chef John!

Just finished this as a late brunch - awesome! I added a bit more red pepper flakes & used jar sauce the Zesty one- excellent. My husband actually added hot sauce to his mine was just right without adding hot sauce. 12 minutes was all it took in a preheated oven. Used reheated leftover garlic bread instead of toast. I'd give it 6 stars if I could!

I have made this recipe several times.  My husband thinks it is wonderful and actually requests it.  I use Emeril's Marinara Sauce (tried others but always go back to this).  My caution would be the size of the eggs - not all large eggs are the same size.  That affects the amount of time you cook them.  I make them in a single ramekin with one egg - a heavy country bread is wonderful but English muffins work as well.  The flavor is wonderful!

This has become my favorite way to make eggs! Easy and delicious! It's also a very versatile recipe. I like to use salsa, cheddar or jack cheese and cilantro, and serve with tortillas for a huevos dish.

First of all, let me say that normally Chef John's recipes are the best.  This one, however, was just so-so for me.  I may have put a little more sauce at the botton of dish, so that could be part of the problem.  But what I think I didn't like was the texture of the eggs.  I did not overbake or underbake it.  It just wasn't for me (my husband thought it was pretty good, though).

Tried this recipe today and hubby and I loved it! The only thing I did different was break up the yolks after about 10 minutes in the oven since I dislike slightly runny eggs and placed back in the oven for about another 5 minutes. I will be definitely making this again! Thanks Chef John you've never failed me!

I have made this at least six times for my boyfriend and I for breakfast. We absolutely adore it. I follow the recipe pretty closely except I add a little less red pepper flakes. I also use seasoned parmesan. For the marinara sauce I use a small can of Hunts tomato sauce. I also like to lightly scramble the eggs prior to baking. A wonderful and different breakfast. Love it!

It was fast and easy to make. I just kept an eye on it and didn't time it while baking.
I don't think I would like this for breakfast but it was great for dinner. I even made fresh bread to go with it. Oops forgot the cream but I don't think it made a difference.

This was my first time making this style of dish.  I have an 88 year young god mother that thought they were delicious and she would have given them a full 5.  A lot of it has to do with the Marinara Sauce that you use since it imparts much of the flavor and feel of this recipe.  I would make it again :0)

Excellent. To give it a little more body, I added two fresh sausages (which I cooked separately and then added to the tomato sauce) and a green pepper cut to small pieces. As far as cooking time, 13' are enough.

This dish is absolutely yummy with no changes.  The best part is no pots and pans and easy cleanup.  Makes a nice presentation and great for overnight guest.  You will definitely impress them.
I served them in pottery skillet dishes with 2 eggs in each.  Perfect!

Delicious. My hubs was a little unsure about it when he first saw it, but he ate every bite. Shortcut: Used arrabiata sauce instead of marinara and red pepper flakes. Very spicy! Didn't use the heavy whipping cream and don't think we missed it. Baked five eggs in a ceramic pie plate at 400 for 15 minutes. Yum!

Either his oven runs hot or mine runs colder than set as after 18 minutes, my yokes were still runnier than his in the video.  Made this as a late night supper, used some marinara from my favorite restaurant, Bravo, and had no fresh basil or parsley on hand.   Otherwise I followed the recipe closely - good shaved Assiago from local Italian specialty store and same with toast - Wonderful!!!!  and exactly the right amount for a late light supper!

Made mine with 505 Green Chile . Totally outstanding and will make it for company anytime. Topped it with cheddar cheese and bacon bits. I just watched the dish starting at 10 minutes and I think we finished up at 15. Sure glad I tried it.

WOW! This is definitely my new favorite breakfast recipe. SO easy to prepare (this is the first time it took me SHORTER than the advertised prep time), just pop it in the oven, and voila! Totally delicious, filling meal. Really, this is better than most breakfasts I've had in a while. I was low on pasta sauce, so I used salsa for the rest - that gave it a nice kick! Low-ish carbs, made from ingredients I always have around the house...  Thanks for introducing me to this spectacular recipe that I know will become a staple in my diet.

I've been following and preparing the Chefs recipes for quite a while. I have never taken time to review one..... but these eggs are outstanding !
Sort of like Shakshouka.
Very easy to modify spicy or not and pick your fave cheese. Its all good. Good to spray dish before cooking so eggs slide out easier.  Thanx Chef

Good. We enjoyed it, but it’s a lot of calories so I won’t be making it very often. Gotta be careful to get this out of the oven in time because the very hot dish continues to cook it long after you get it out of the oven. I think it would be better to remove it before the eggs are “just set” and let it cool for 5 or 10 minutes before serving.

Made this last night for a light dinner and it was great! I checked it at the designated cooking time and mine was really runny still, so cooked it a couple more minutes and it was just a little runny.  A couple more minutes and the yolks were over done, so sadly no runny yellow but it was still tasty. I will watch more closely next time....Thank you!

Excellent!  I used eggs fresh from the coop so that was an amazing difference- but not necessary for this at all.  I found the  prep time was almost nonexistent (always a plus) and the finished dinner was beautiful to see.  My family raved over it.  The only thing I had to learn from the first attempt is my oven is slightly "slower" than his.  My original try for 10 minutes was insufficient and I got eggs that were edible but unappetizing to look at or cut into.  Increasing my cook time by 2 or so minutes helped me with the next try.  Unfortunately, this is very temp dependent since you can't have it too runny or  too firm.  Suggestion?  Make a dish with 2 eggs first- if it is too hard or too runny, adjust accordingly.  One of Chef John's easiest to cook- yay!

I would’ve used a thicker marinara and, perhaps cooked it less time. But, it was tasty and I enjoyed it.

My wife loved it.  I overcooked the yoke a bit.  I made a cream by mixing sour cream and milk.  A fun dish and a departure from the eggs and salsa approach.  The 2nd time should be better.

This was so easy and delicious. I subbed a lactose-free half and half for the cream - just used less. Next time, I will bake it for less time. That's so hard to judge, though. All ovens are different and we live at a high altitude. I cooked it at 400 for 10 minutes (doubling the recipe with four eggs). It was great with sourdough toast. I love Chef John recipes!

Delicious! I used butter and cilantro since I was out of olive oil and parsley (for the first time ever) and it was amazing. I will try it the original way next time. This is so simple but nothing short of "magical".

Yum!  This was a yummy change to the usual fried egg breakfast. To make it more WW friendly, I did olive oil spray, very light cheese (not a cheesy person) and just a tsp drizzle of heavy cream. Had it with some light wheat toast. 
I'd eat this again!!

Made it for my hubby tonight.  He likes spicy, so in addition to the red pepper, I added some cayenne as Chef John did in the video, and some hot sauce.  Used parmesan and store bought marinara.  Served with sour dough toast points.  Hubby loved it. I loved how simple it was to make.   I will be making it again.

This was amazing and what I come to expect from Chef John.  Made exactly per recipe.  Will have to experiment with length in the oven.  At 12 minutes was still soupy.  I probably cooked too long but was still good.  Plan on modifying this with salsa and have shired huevos rancheros!

Made this today for a Sunday brunch. My husband kept asking what am I cooking because it smells delicious (and he’s absolutely right). I made it with 5 eggs and maybe a little bit more of the marinara. I did not have cream so I used some milk and a squirt of whipped cream from can. Seasoned the sauce with dried basil, Italian seasoning , dusted it with garlic powder and salt & pepper. Boy, this dish is delish!!!! We both scraped the bottom and sides of the baking dish. I should have taken a picture for posting but we couldn’t  resist the smell and how it looked... Will make this for sure when we have company because of the convenience and it’s really presentable. YUM! Thanks chef John!

It looked so good and I wanted something for a light, late dinner. Used a glass pie pan, eyeballed the ingredients and waited for the timer...delish, easy-peasy, and seriously, you need to toast BOTH slices of bread...you'll need 'em both to wipe the plate clean!

Looked like a great recipe so I tackled it.
Needed 4 eggs so I doubled the recipe
I got fresh basil and Italian 
Had trouble cooking the eggs correctly added 2 minutes but still was too soft.
Great creation.

Great recipe, had hashbrowns so used them. Love potatoes.
Want to try it with bread.

7" square baking dish, doubled the recipe, except seasonings. Used leftover spaghetti sauce instead of marinara. Egg whites didn't cook thoroughly, but yolks did. Would prefer it the other way around.  Maybe the dish is too small for 4 eggs. Tastes great, everyone liked it.

This is my all time favorite recipe. I have made this several times and have never been disappointed. I'm not a breakfast person and would prefer savory over sweet, I've even made this for lunch a few times. A couple of ways I've adjust the recipe for my liking is to add minced garlic to the sauce, I also omit the cream, I've even used pizza sauce. It still comes out perfect, and I use a toasted English muffin to scoop up all the delicious bits and I'm in food heaven. This is definitely a keeper, my 5 year-old even likes it!

Yum!! First time making baked eggs. I baked 12 minutes and would take out sooner next time - the yolks were hard. (Don't go by appearance; it still looked soft.) But I mixed it all up to eat and it was still delicious! Can't wait to try again.

This dish looks so weird to me, but I had some leftover marinara sauce from making a pizza so decided to give this recipe a try. This is very interesting and is dependent on you to like your sauce, which is the prominent flavor. Overall mine turned out pretty good, but unfortunately my egg yolks cooked to a medium in 10 minutes. Definitely keep an eye on your egg yolks when baking because I'm sure the creaminess would've added something more to this dish. Heavy cream isn't something I usually have on hand so I had to make mine without it. Next time I will make sure to use cream and to keep an ion my yolks better. I'm sure it will only improve how good this dish turned out. I can't wait to make this for company to see their reaction.

I like this recipe. But, when I make it again, I would poach the eggs separately, because it is hard to get the eggs just right in a casserole. Then, I would put each egg on top of buttered toast and cover with the sauce. I think the sauce would work well on many dishes. And I plan to use the left over sauce on some pork chops I am baking tonight.

I have made this 3 times, and it is a learning experience ! Due to differences in ovens, you will soon learn what works best for you. I suggest taking them out of the oven when the whites are still a little runny, since the eggs are still cooking in the dish, by the time you sit down to eat, they will be perfect. I did one this morning with some left over cooked pasta, mixed in with the sauce. I did another with alfredo sauce, with chopped smoked ham, in lieu of the plain marinara. experiment with different items, have fun with this dish !

Thks Chef! I made it for breakfast today. Served in individual ramekins. Didn't follow the measurement but followed all the steps in the video and measurement by eyes. Baked for 10 mins but yoke still runny. Will go for an extra min next try. Taste great still. Thks for the fantastic recipe.

I went to make it but instead of the Marinara Sauce, I used Prego Italian Sausage with Garlic (meat sauce). Gave the eggs the added dimension of being served with some breakfast meat.

Chef John, your recipes never disappoint!! This was so delicious and a nice change up from the typical list of recipes I make for brunch.  I only made a few minor changes due to what I had on-hand: I used a homemade tomatoe sauce, added basil, and left out the cream.  Also, I served it on top of hot sausage, onions and peppers,  and black beans - yummmmm!!!! Will definitely add this to my recipe arsenal!

Wonderful recipe. My 10 y/o dtr enjoys it as well. I doubled the recipe and used a ceramic-type pie pan to try to keep the shallow dish and it worked well. Omitted the red pepper flakes to suit our tastes. When done served with toast...no leftovers!

Sooooo yummy!!! Definitely double the recipe though because it's fairly light.  My husband wasn't feeling well the first time I made it so I was lucky enough to eat it all...and that I did!  Doubling will allow for seconds.  So easy and very good!

This was excellent!  I took the advice of other reviewers and only baked for one minute more than the twelve recommended .  Baked in CorningWare French White oval individual casserole (7 3/8").  This was a perfect size.  Substituted whole milk for the  whipping cream as I did not have the latter.  Milk worked just fine.   Will make this again --- and again!

I have made the recipe several times.  It's great.  Sometimes I just drizzle milk instead of heavy cream.  The tricky part is getting the dish out when the eggs are cooked but still a little runny.

I made this recipe in a bigger dish to fit 3 eggs. I used fresh basil instead parsley. It was the bomb!!! We love it!
Super delicious with sides:  sweet plantain and white rice. Thanks Chef John.

Simple and Easy. I made a few changes. I lined a small casserole dish with slices of country bread. I had left over Capricosa sauce (spicy) so I used that instead of the marinara and thus omitted the red pepper flakes.  Then layered it all on top of the bread as instructed and baked. We loved it.

This is delicious.  I used salsa and grated Monterey Jack cheese as that's what I had on hand.  I baked them the  entire time and the egg yolks were a little overdone.  Can't wait to try this again tomorrow morning shortening the time a bit.  At any rate, it was delish.  Thanks for sharing!

I now make these once a week.  We are on a low carb lifestyle and eggs can get to be boring. This recipe is marvelous as it provides a new way to prepare and eat them, we just leave off the toast/bread.  Great flavor and quick and easy.  Sometimes I add a few dollops of ricotta to make them creamier, but they are excellent just the way the recipe prescribes.

Super easy. I have made half a dozen times now. My daughter calls it leggsagne, says the eggs are like the noodles. Used pizza sauce first couple times and was really good. Splurged on more expensive marinara recently and was awesome. Always add diced onion, but I love onion. Never have added the cream. Really can't go wrong with substitutions. Make it your own. Is easy to overcook eggs. I usually make a 6 egg batch in a glass pie plate.  No more than 15 minutes or yolks get hard, but 13 minutes yolks usually a tad runny. Gotta have the toast. I just use whole wheat bread.

This was ok.  I may even make it again when I have the ingredients to make it and not much else in the house.  It just did not wow me. I would try this again with goat cheese instead of Parmesan tho.  I think the tang would give it what it's missing.

So good. I used cheddar instead of parm with a sprinkle of smoked paprika.  Toasted lots of good bread to go with it. I don't normally love eggs, but I loved this dish.  The perfect light dinner for my husband and I.

Fantastic!  Used dried basil instead of parsley.  I needed to bake it longer, it was a deeper bowl and I used a toaster oven (it's humid!).  I will be making this a LOT.  Thank you Chef John.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I love it as it is but when I want to make a full meal out of it, I make it in a pan with some cut up bacon and the eggs cracked over some angel hair pasta and then throw that in the oven.

Just made this for dinner! Yum! I tripled the recipe. Used my enameled cast iron 8 x 10 baker and it worked perfectly to hold 6 eggs. I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I sprinkled some dried Italian seasoning over just before baking. I will go a little heavier on the crushed red pepper flakes next time. Served it with a small green salad and whole grain artisan bread toasted. Thanks Chef John : )

Fantastic!!! I've made this dish before with marinara sauce, but this time I didn't have any on hand, so I used vodka sauce.  Also added some shredded mozzarella cheese with the shredded parmesan.  Fresh parsley seems to be the key. My toast has never been so delish!

I saw this in one of my "Allrecipes What's Cooking" daily email and had to make it.  I didn't have fresh parsley, so used a bit of dried parsley. Didn’t change anything else. Baked it in a small gratin disk. It was wonderful! I was tempted to make a second batch, LOL. Will definitely make this again.   Thanks Chef John!

Tried this last year, was so impressed with the ease of fixing eggs without the frying pan.  The marina sauce was an interesting tweek.
Since then have tried this with sausage gravy, cheesy grits, cheesy hash browns, corned beef hash.  If it can go into a 9x9 casserole dish, in it went and topped with eggs.  Makes a great brunch or light dinner.  Way to go Chef John!!!

Another Chef John winner! Great flavors and a nice change from our typical egg recipes. We added more eggs and used a bigger ramekin but it still turned out excellent. Quick, easy, and flavorful!

I love this dish. It was quick and easy to make. I did bake it a few minutes longer and broke the yokes a few minutes before the time was up because I like my yokes cooked. Score!

This was wonderful.  I did a double batch in a 7 x 11 dish - it took a bit longer to cook, but thanks to the video, I knew how it should look when it was done.  I scooped the eggs out of the dish and onto toast.  A bit messy, but the flavour was awesome.  Also very rich and filling.

Perfect quick dinner.  Years ago my favorite restaurant served this and called it eggs in purgatory, this is just as good.  Only thing I would change is not to bake it as long.  I set the timer for 12 min, checked it after 7 and eggs looked very undercooked.  I left it for the full 12 min and that was too long, 10 min next time.

I make this all the time. Give or take a few ingredients each time and it still works out perfect. I use ceramic  ramekins for individual servings.

I'm a "Chef John" fan. All of his recipes have a great appeal. I tried this one and it came out sort of "meh." ... I'm an experienced cook; don't believe I hosed the recipe up. While I like eggs and Italian sauces, I'm not sure that I have a taste for them at the same time. I doubt I'd like pizza with egg on it either. It's interesting to me because I do like eggs and salsa (not that salsa has anything to do with marinara-type sauce, but they're both tomato-based). Bottom line, interesting idea but questionable delivery.

A nice change of pace from our normal eggs.  It needs more marinara sauce.  And it really needs to be watched while cooking eggs go from not done to over done in a heartbeat.

Very, very good. I made the recipe pretty much as is but but didn't have any cream so I used half and half. Do be careful, though, not to overcook, thinking the eggs are too loose. The baking dish keeps enough heat to cook the eggs further even as its on the table and mine were a bit over done.

My Mom made this when we were kids, only she did it ontop of the stove in a fry pan with a lid, tried Chef John's, tasted wonderful and brought back a lot of memories,only difference is she used to put two slices of crisp bacon on the side. My Mom told us her Grandmother made this for her when she was a child in Italy.

This was a wonderful Saturday lunch - rich, quick, simple, full of flavor, and, best of all, not TOO filling.  We used a really good jarred marinara sauce, and I think that made a difference.

This is very good.  It has kind of an elegant taste about it.  I lower the calories on it by doing 1 egg and 1 egg white and use half and half or milk instead of the cream (although it is a little better with the cream).  I'm going low carb so I also don't eat the toast sometimes too.  The first time I made this dish, I ate it all and then went back and made another.  So good!

Good for a brunch, nice for something different.  Watch the red pepper flakes not to put too many in,
