I made these with chicken thighs instead of breasts (since that's what we had), and it was delicious! I love the simplicity of the ingredients, but it was still full of flavor.

I made this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and pounded the chicken so it was thinner. I then marinated it for three hours and baked it for 30 minutes. It was delicious.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  For once, my chicken wasn't dry!  I will certainly be making this again.
