Very tasty and nice presentation.
I substituted feta for blue cheese and it came out great. Although I had to cook it for about 5 minutes longer

If you really like bleu cheese, these are probably great.  I don't care for a  really strong bleu cheese flavor and did not particularly like these.  My guests thought they were pretty to look at but nobody complimented the taste.  Nobody went for seconds.  I might try these again with a more subtle cheese filling.

These look gorgeous when served. The blue cheese explodes in your mouth with tangy abandon and is a real treat. Everyone ooed and ahhed over this!

This is a great recipe! Thank you, I made it the day after Thanksgiving for our out of town company who was still here.  A perfect healthy appetizer after a day of feasting on heavy food.  I also used the sundried tomato basil fetta cheese and it was great.  I needed to leave it in the oven for about 15-20 minutes to let the zuccini soften up because I didn't scoop all of it out.

The idea is great, but I gave it three stars because bleu cheese is just nit the thing to use. Not only does it tastes bitter, it adds unnecessary calories. I followed the instructions, but used Laughing Cow Garlic and Herb cheese both inside and on top.  The cooking time should vary too, depending on how you cut the zucchini. Make sure it's not crunchy, or it won't taste right at all.  Will definitely make again, but with those changes. It's an excellent healthy tapa.

I am really bummed out about these.  I don't understand how the rating is so high!  I love zucchini, tomatoes, and Parmesan cheese, so I thought I'd love these.  The blue cheese was too bitter tasting a cheese to use for these, I think.  The basil was also pretty strong.  In some bites that's all I could taste and it was just overwhelming.  Won't be trying these again.

These were so yummmy!!! I didn't have any Blue cheese so I used Feta instead. I also didn't have any cherry tomatoes so I diced a regular tomatoe and used it as filling.

I liked this, but I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted feta for blue cheese.  It turned out great.

This is a crowd pleaser every time, especially if you substitute feta for blue cheese. You can also use fresh basil, if you make sure to chop it up. These look very pretty on the plate - very festive for the holidays.

Made these Saturday night for company.  They were great - everyone asked for recipe. Even my husband who won't eat zucchini liked them. Thanks for a new appetizer Amy!

A quick and pretty appetizer. I used a basil tomato flavored crumbled feta cheese instead of blue cheese. Feta still gives it that "bite" but tends to be more appealing to people.

I'm not a big fan of blue cheese, however, I could eat these all day long. The melting of the blue cheese makes the blue cheese much more mild. So so good. Highly recommend this recipe! :)

These were very tasty.  Because we don't have great tomatoes yet I also added a tiny bit of spaghetti sauce before adding the cheese.  Loved these, I'll make them again today.  Thanks for the recipe!

I took these to a New Year's party last night and everyone loved them, even the non-veggie people enjoyed them. The only change I made was using reduced fat tomato basil feta cheese.

These are very easy to make and are beautiful on an appetizer tray.  I made them last night and got many positive comments.  The Blue cheese is wonderful, but I would suggest a milder cheese if serving to children.  The adults ate these up, but the kids weren't too fond of the blue cheese surprise.
Very nice and also very pretty.

I was really disappointed since they looked wonderful when I took them out of the oven.  I tried out a small batch to test the recipe for a party I am having.  I did not like them enough to even eat the ones that I already made.

I mixed the blue cheese with some ricotta to make it go further and I had it on hand! Tasted great. The blue is so strong you don't even notice the ricotta!

I don't like bleu cheese, I used pizza cheese, but still topped with the parmesan.  It was wonderful, we've had them several times now.  It really helps to make sure they are seasoned.
