It was pretty simple to make but  it was lacking in favor.. need to favor the meat with some Lipton onion mix or your favorite Italian  dry spice rub.. I added bell peppers (red and green) and some onion but it was still lacking in favor. my daughter loved it. (7yrs old)

This was easy and delicious. I did add a half packet of beefy onion soup mix just because I had it from another recipe and I like onion. ( I thought of it after reading another reviewer's comment about Italian dressing mix. ) My husband and my son went back for seconds! Thinking this would be great to bring to a potluck dinner with some slider buns.

I actually really liked this.    It was very easy to make.    I was worried that it wouldn't have any flavor.     Reminded me of a French dip sandwich.

This was pretty good, but we prefer the versions of this dish that include a packet of Italian dressing seasoning in the meat.  Thanks for sharing!
