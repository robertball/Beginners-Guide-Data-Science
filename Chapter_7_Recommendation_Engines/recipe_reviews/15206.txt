These meatballs were a hit!  I used frozen meatballs.
Most jellied cranberry sauce come in 16 oz cans so if you decide to use the whole can you'll need to double all the other ingredients.  Typical chili sauce comes in 12oz. bottle so you'll need two bottles if you use the full can of cranberry.  Hope this helps your  shopping.

I have made these numerous times and am ashamed to admit I'm just now reviewing them.  Wonderful addition to the regular grape jelly recipes out there with great meatballs....      Based on experience and personal preference with these cocktail meatballs I offer the following suggestions:  1.)  Add one packet of lipton onion soup mix to the meatball mixture if you do not have time to mince or grate the onion.  2.)  Bake meatballs over a drip pan to reduce the fat before adding to the sauce.  3.) If using frozen meatballs ENSURE you DO NOT use Italian meatballs as this upsets the balance of the meatballs and sauce (yuck)!  3.)  Make the sauce the day before to let the flavors marry - I can't stress what a difference this makes!  This recipe gets better the next day.  4.)  The Heinz sauce in the round bottle seems to be the best chili sauce for this mixture.  Reviewers:  I seriously dislike people that rate a recipe based on the changes they have made to the original.  I want to state that I rated this recipe on the recipe Lara submitted.  The changes I suggested were based on my family's personal preference.  Thanks Lara for a fabulous appetizer recipe - I always give you the credit!

I have been making these meatballs for 30 years or more in my catering business. I however use cornflakes crumbs instead of bread crumbs. I also put 1/3 cup parsley; I use 1/4 cup ketchup instead of water and 1 tsp. soy sauce. Just a tought from an old chef

These were great. A huge hit with my family. The only thing I did differently was substitute 1 packet of lipton onion soup for the minced onion. It added great flavor. My nephews couldn't get enough of these meatballs.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a very tasty recipe for meatballs, with the cranberry sauce representing a change from the run of the mill grape jelly recipe.  I used seasoned bread crumbs, which added some nice flavor to the meatballs, and then baked them on a broiler tray, which allowed the fat to run off while they were baking.  One recipe is enough to fill one of the small 1 to 2 quart crockpots.  I made the meatballs 2 days ahead, and refrigerated them.  The day of my party, I made the sauce, put the meatballs in the crockpot, added the sauce, and put the whole crock back in the fridge.  About 2 hours before the party, I put the crock back in the warmer, and plugged it in.  Voila!  Easy and tasty.  I was so impressed with the recipe, that I made an extra batch of the meatballs, and froze them.  I will use them for another party in the next couple of weeks.  I'll bet you could use ground turkey for a little less fat.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

Since I was serving 50+ and had several other dishes to prepare, I used storebought meatballs, and used this recipe for the sauce, cooking everything in a slowcooker.  This was the biggest hit of the party, and many people asked for the recipe.  It was sweet, but with a bit of a kick from the chili--unusual, but quite delicious, and it won my husband's "best he's ever had" compliment.  A fantastic, but very simple recipe!

These were great! So great, I barely got to eat 2 of them myself - the guys just inhaled them! One thing that would make the recipe easier though, is some explanation of what is meant by "Chili Sauce". There are so many types of Chili Sauce out there - after searching, I found that Heinz makes something called "Chili Sauce". If you're like me and have never heard of this type of chili sauce, it's basically a vinegar-y, very mildly spiced-up version of ketchup - (sort of like cocktail sauce for shrimp?), w/a ketchup consistency. You can find it next to the ketchup in any big chain grocery. You can't go wrong with this recipe! I'm making it again for New Year's eve!

I, too, served these for my New Year's Day party and they were a hit.  I also used the prepared, frozen meatballs.  I'll bet the Little Smokies would be great in this sauce as well.  Word of warning - do NOT use the Italian meatballs!  The flavors fight each other and the sauce is the loser. Thanks for the recipe, Lara.

I cheated and used frozen meatballs and baked for 15 minutes while making the sauce in a sauce pan.  The sauce comes out to be absolutely amazing that you wouldn't know if the meatballs where homemade or store bought.  I added 1 tbsp. of worchestershire sauce and put the sauce and meatballs in a crockpot and put on low for a couple hours.  It was a huge hit at the my friend's Xmas party.  People where raving and asking for this recipe all night.  They were the first things to be eaten up on the buffet table.

This sounded so good an usual, I decided to make them as an appetizer the Even of Thanksgiving.  My husband had worked late, and I knew he was sure to be hungry the moment he walked in the door.  I told him that dinner would be put on hold, as we were having appetizers, and a glass of wine together.  I served the meatballs with fancy toothpicks, as well as cubed cheese and crackers.  He asked for more and more of the meatballs until they were entirely gone!!!  As he burbed politely...he said "this one's a keeper, honey"!  Needless to say, supper will wait!!!  Thanks so much for sharing this terrific recipe with all of us!

These were delicious! I bought 3 bags of frozen Armour meatballs - 25 meatballs per bag- and used 2 12 ounce bottles of Heinz chili sauce, 1 14 oz jellied cranberry sauce and doubled the sugar & lemon juice and the sauce/meatball ratio was perfect! Can't wait to make again!

I omitted the brown sugar and it tasted fine.  Used frozen meatballs and simmerred in a crockpot for 3+ hours.  It was great!

These are great if you like a sweet meatball sauce.  I used fresh bread crumbs to keep the meatballs moist.  I baked these in the oven and just covered with the sauce during the last half of the baking time.

I'm 67 and this recipe has been around forever... they're always a hit, where ever I take them. Definitely bake the meatballs before adding them to the sauce. I bake mine 25 to 30 minutes. The correct chili sauce is a tomato based chili sauce, such as Heinz or Cross & Blackwell. Sometimes I use grape jelly in place of the cranberry sauce (same amount), also makes a very good sauce. If you are making this for a group, trust me you'll want to double, or even triple the recipe. People don't stop at 4 or 5, they just keep eating them until they're gone... especially the guys... LOL  These are addictive!!!!!

Chili sauce is usually found next to ketchup.  Heinz is the only brand I've seen or used.  It's in a round glass bottle.  It's basically ketchup with a little extra spice, but definitely not anything like tabasco or hot sauce.  If you had to substitute, you could use ketchup with extra onion and garlic added.  Hope this helps!

I made these for a Christmas party, and I think out of the whole spread, these were THE BEST thing at the party! Perfect amount of sweet and tangy. The only thing I changed was I added about 1/4 cup of Worceshire sauce, and then threw in a package of smoked Hillshire Farms "lil weenies" since I had them on hand and wanted the dish to go further. The smokey flavor on the weenies with the sweet tangy sauce was to die for! Enjoy!

Very good!  I made these for my family's Christmas Eve get-together and received rave reviews.  Even as I type this, I am making them for a second time for a Super Bowl party.  I did buy pre-made meatballs which made the recipe extremely easy and fast.  I threw everything into the crockpot (even used the meatballs frozen) on low for approx. 3 hours.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

I've been making a variation of this recipe for 20 years.  It is not overly sweet and is a true sweet & sour.  I hate sauerkraut but love this and nobody can guess that it is in it. It makes a thick sauce. SAUCE: 12 oz. jar Heinz Cili Sauce, i jar of water, 1 cup brown sugar, 16 oz. can WHOLE cranberry sauce, 1 cup drained sauerkraut.  MEATBALLS: 2 lbs. extra lean ground beef, 1 pkg. onion soup mix, 2 eggs, 1 cup bread crumbs.  Form into small meatballs (about 88)  DO NOT BROWN!!  Place in a 9X13 pan, mix sauce ingredients & pour over meatballs.  Bake at 325 degrees for 2 hours.  Check occassionally and stir if necessary.

Very good! 100 times better after the sauce sits over night! I used the Heinz chili sauce (oh & this recipe is on the bottle label...) I tripled the recipe and used frozen meatballs from costco (didnt have the energy or prepare 4-6lbs of meatballs..) The first night they were good, my husband ate em right up but I was not at all impressed. This statement sums it up perfectly: "Word of warning - do NOT use the Italian meatballs! The flavors fight each other and the sauce is the loser" Needless to say I used italian meatballs BEFORE reading the review....the flavors just didnt blend & the sauce was WAY TOO SWEET!!! HOWEVER, after sitting overnight and reheating the next day 100 TIMES BETTER! The flavors of the sauce 'blended' together much better & produced a great flavor that no longer was sooo sweet. Will make again!

There was nothing I liked about this recipe. I was very disappointed. When I try a 5-star recipe used by hundreds of people I expect something decent. The sauce was unusual and unappetizing. The method leaves the meatballs overcooked since it asks you to bake them before adding them to the crockpot. I don't even know what to say. Big disappointment.

Terrific recipe! We had a group of 60 for my son's graduation - I made a giant crockpot of these and there wasn't one left.  I didn't change a thing other than the quantity.  They were easy to make and VERY delicious. They appealed to both adults and children. THANKS!

Excellent!  I used a tablespoon to measure them out and was able to get 35 meatballs from 1 lb of ground sirloin.  I cooked them for a total of 22 minutes, flipping them once after 11 minutes.  I didn't change or add any ingredients to the original recipe.

Love this recipe!  Made it yesterday for my daugther's birtday party.  I doubled the recipe.  Used pre-made frozen italian meatballs.  I used half the amount of chili sauce added some ketchup, because we don't like things too spicy.  I also put in more brown sugar.  Put the sauce mix and the frozen meatballs into a slow cooker and cooked on high for two-three hours and then kept it on low while being served.  This is now my "meatball" recipe.

I used premade frozen meatballs, and just dumped them in the crockpot with the mixture of the other ingredients and heated them on Low for about 5 hours.  That allowed them to really soak up the flavors - yum!  They were delicious, and I was asked for the recipe a few times.

I haven't made these in a while, but they are just so good I had to review!  You can also substitute grape jelly for cranberry sauce and they are just as tastey!  And I agree with a previous reviewer - they are much better the next day after the flavors have had time to meld together.  I usually make these a day before serving them for that reason!

Awesome.  I took this recipe to a christmas party and everyone raved.  I used frozen meatballs and made a few small changes to the sauce recipe.  First I used a little less chili sauce but added smokey BBQ sauce, a few drops of hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce as well as minced onion and garlic.  Cooked on high in the crockpot for 3 hours and they turned out perfect.  Will make again.

These are very very good, they dissapeared quickly from my party. However, as I was pouring in the chili sauce I happened to notice on the back of the bottle... the exact same recipe. Seems to me like someone needs to get their own recipe.

I used frozen meatballs (store brand) and avoided the Italian version since everyone here said the seasoning conflicted with the sauce.  I put them frozen with the sauce in a crockpot and just sampled them. They are delicious.  I did not pre-cook the meatballs since they came cooked. There's no need to make your own. Delicious recipe.

easy to make, and delicious! nice to have a slight tartness from the cranberry sauce, instead of the typical grape jelly....doubled the recipe last time and they were gobbled up! will be making them again, for super bowl Sunday, so might triple the batch!

UPDATE...made a huge batch for our super bowl party today, and they were gone like lightening..the men were even spearing them out of the skillet, 10 minutes before they were done simmering, and my grandson gobbled them up..so good, and even better when you make the sauce the day before, and bake the meatballs the day before as well..the flavors are so much better, believe me! all I had to do when we got to my daughter's house, was to simmer them in the sauce till done...next time I will quadruple the amount, they go that fast!

Since it seems to baffling some: Chili Sauce is a LOT like cocktail sauce (kick from chili rather than horseradish though, best I can tell). I've only seen it made by Heinz, and it will likely be right beside the cocktail sauce in the grocery store. It is NOT sriracha, or anything you'd put on a hotdog, etc. Hope that helps somebody out!  Made these for an office party. They smelled fantastic while cooking, but I never got to eat one myself - they were scarfed down, to rave reviews, before I got the chance! Will definitely make again.

These were fabulous.  Made them for a pot luck and they were enjoyed by all. I did use whole cranberry sauce and worchester sauce instead of water. Def. a keeper. For those of you who feel they were too spicy, I bet you weren't using Heinz Chili Sauce.

This is pretty close to my standard recipe, too.  I use whatever I have on hand as the "filler", whether it be bread crumbs, oatmeal, cracker crumbs, leftover cooked rice, etc.  One thing I always had trouble with was that they tended to fall apart once they were in the crockpot with the sauce.  On the advice of a friend, I tried rolling the raw meatballs in flour before browning them in oil.  This method really helps!  I make a huge batch of them, making sure they're cooked through, then line them up on jelly-roll pans and stick them in the freezer.  Once frozen, they can go into zip-lock bags and be handy for whenever I need a quick dish.

Used prepared meatballs from Costco and doubled the sauce....as other reviews said, they disappeared really fast.  Everyone loved them, have never had meatballs go over this well before......great sauce.  I put them in crockpot on low for several hours, stirring every hour.  With all of the positive comments I received I will never make them any other way in the future..

I made about 100 meatballs for my daughter's school party and went home with an empty platter and a recipe request from the teacher.  Enough children asked for a copy that she made one for each one in the class.  When 25 assorted kids love a recipe then it's a keeper!

I made these for my daughter's graduation open house, and doubled the recipe and they were all gone before the open house was over!  I cheated a bit and used frozen mini-meatballs from Sam's Club and put them frozen in the crockpot to simmer in the sauce for a couple of hours.  They came out great! Thanks for the recipe, Lara!

These meatballs are amazing!!! They are so easy to make and have such a wonderful taste. SO YUMMY! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used a pouch of onion soup mix instead of onions in the meatball mixture, as others have suggested. It worked out great! They were moist and very flavorful. I just had some of the leftovers, and the day after, they are even better (if you are lucky enough to have any left). This was my first attempt at meatballs and I was a bit skeptical, but these are easy and super tasty.

These are absolutely fabulous.  To the people saying they're too spicy... did you use chili sauce (generally comes in a can), or hot sauce (comes in a bottle)... chili sauce is not that spicy and certainly doesn't overwhelm the cranberry sauce.

I've made these twice now and am making them again tomorrow.  Took them to a potluck at work and everyone loved them - they were the first thing gone!  

I use frozen veggie meatballs, since I'm vegetarian.  Even so, nobody could tell and everyone rave and asked for the recipe!  

These are definitely my new party take-along!

I've been making these for a couple of years now. Following others advice, I used the frozen small meatballs (Sam's club sells them in 2 # packages). I brown the meatballs according to package directions in the oven, put in crock pot, then add the sauce ingredients in the crock pot with meatballs.  I serve these at parties and I have repeat requests for them.

sorry but...yuck.It's currently christmas eve and I made these for tomorrow's christmas dinner. I don't think I'll even bring them. I don't like the meatballs or the sauce. I come from a family of very good cooks and fear they will all laugh hysterically if I bring these. The meatballs taste bland. The sauce tastes strange and well gross. Have you ever had a food so nasty that you actually felt nauseous after eating it? I only had one and that is how I feel. I followed the recipe exactly and am a pretty good cook. Sorry. However, everyone else reviewed them as excellent...so maybe it is just me.

I improvised a little for this recipe. I made my meatballs the way that I'd normally make them--garlic powder, crushed red pepper, red wine, etc., and baked them as the recipe said to. It was nice to avoid the frying mess. For the sauce, I realized that I had only bought one can of jellied cranberries and I had a double batch of meatballs. I substituted 8 oz. of boysenberry jelly and then omitted the brown sugar (the sauce was already sweet enough) and forgot the lemon juice. People still ranted and raved, so I'll definitely make these again!

I made these for my dad's surprise party this weekend and they were AWESOME.  I am still craving them but unfortunately they were all gobbled up.  Two things I did differently were I made them the night before and used onion soup mix instead of real onion.  They sat in the fridge overnight to let the flavor "develop".  The next morning, I threw them into my crockpot with the sauce and let them simmer on low throughout the party.  They were wonderful, someone described them as "sweet and kicky".  I want to have another party now just so I have an excuse to make them again!!!  Thanks for sharing Lara.

These meatballs were gone in a flash! I served them at a dinner party and everyone loved them. I made 5.25 pounds of frozen meat balls (NOT Italian) and 4x the sauce. I cooked them in the crock-pot for four hours on high...it would probably be better to cook for at least six hours on low. The Heinz chili sauce is a 12oz bottle which is 1 cup. For those who might wonder, the Wal-Mart brand of chili sauce is just as good as the Heinz; I bought both and couldn't tell a difference (WM was actually thicker). I made the sauce the day before for ease and so the flavors would meld. You can't go wrong with this recipe, it's a winner!

This is a great recipe! The homemade meatballs are a winner, but you can always use the store bought kind if you want to make things easier. When they simmer in the sauce (I like putting mine in my slow cooker on high, then turning them down to "warm" for parties), they get the most delicious flavor. Try them -- you won't be disappointed!!

I got rave reviews. It is excellent, but we like a bit more kick, so I now add red pepper flakes, extra lemon juice and a splash of vinegar to the sauce. I also add garlic powder and extra onion to the meatballs, as well as substituting ketchup or A1 for the water. The Costco organic ground beef packs which are 1.34 pounds work great - there is plenty of sauce for it.

I also prepared these meatballs for the first time for a party but made sure to read the reviews first.  I didn't have a lot of time so I used frozen HOMESTYLE meatballs (you need to watch out for the packaging).  I combined a bit of cranberry sauce and ligonberry jelly because I didn't want to open another can ( was doubling the recipe).  I also used Thai Sweet Chili Sauce and it was amazing.  Big hit!  They were very easy and very tasty.  My step son said they were "amazing" and for him to compliment my cooking...yeah...I'll take it!

I used this recipe and added a few touches.  I tripled the recipe.  I used 2LB of ground beef and 1LB of ground pork.  I put in 3 tsp of Worcestershire sauce, 1 cup of ketcup instead of the water and added parsley flakes. They taste amazing.  Sauce is the same just tripled.

BEWARE and don't make the same mistakes I did. I mistakingly used a can of jellied cranberry however a can is 14 oz.  I wasn't thinking and assumed it was 8 oz & quickly dumped in in.  Needless to say I had a whole lot of catching up to do  hours later when I realized my mistake to balance this out and I didn't quite succeed.  I also used frozen meatballs - meh homemade is always better.   Lastly,   I did not heed advice and used Italian style breadcrumbs  & again the taste was slightly off.  Next time I will make homemade meatballs  ahead of time & merry the sauce in the correct ratio the night before.

These are a favorite of my family and friends. I use Sriracha hot sauce and reduce the amount from 3/4 to 1/3 Cup. It also works well with Cran-Rasberry sauce. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were delicious! We had some friends over to watch a football game I saw this on the website and had to try it. I followed the recipe as written except, because of time constraints the day of, I cooked the meatballs the night before and heated the sauce of the stove to get it incorporated. After the meatballs were done, I put it all in a 2 OT Crock Pot and put it in the fridge overnight. All I had to do was heat it up the next day! I will definitely keep this recipe around.

So goooood, my kids loved it. We used Frank's Red Hot Chili Sauce for some extra kick and it didn't disappoint. Extra bonus was getting rid of that can of cranberry sauce that's been sitting in the cupboard for three years.

These were definitely good as written but excellent and 5 star worthy with a few tweaks. I added a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire to the meatball mixture for some zing, and would recommend decreasing the cooking time. By 20 minutes my meatballs were fairly overcooked. I would also recommend melting the sauce mixture in the microwave prior to pouring on top of the meatballs to help distribute the flavors more evenly

I used bagged meatballs just to cut out some cooking time. I mixed the sauces together and threw everything into the crockpot.  I did add some crushed red peppers for a little spice.  They were great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I don't normally like meatballs, but I actually liked these. Modifications based on reviews: replaced minced onions with 1 package of Lipton onion soup mix, 14 oz can of jellied cranberry sauce and 1 bottle of Heinz chili sauce (both just for convenience factors to use full amounts). Perfect tartness and sweetness in sauce. Loved it!

Isn't it amazing how the most unusual ingredients can come together to make the tastiest treat?  We loved these!  I cheated and used fully cooked frozen meatballs.  I just threw all the ingredients (meatballs still frozen and all) in the slow cooker and cooked on low for about 5 hours.  So easy and delicious!

I'm known for my holiday parties, hosting 40 or so.  These are a breeze to add variety to a buffet without effort.  I use Costco's meatballs and let them simmer for 4 - 6 hours on low to allow the meatballs to absorb the delicious sauce.  Look like a star while taking it easy on yourself for your next event!

Made this sauce for a Christmas party, and everyone loved the dish. I did this last minute, so used frozen Italian meatballs - put them right in the slow cooker frozen and added the sauce. Cooked on low for 1 hour, then kept in on warm for maybe 30 minutes until the guests arrived - turned out perfectly delicious. I also used Heinz chili sauce - some of the negative comments mention that the sauce was too spicy. This wasn't, and the meatballs were a favorite of the kids.

the meatballs were good, and so was the sauce.  It is too sweet though for my taste.  These were not excellent reheated as the texture of the meat changed a lot and was too soft/gooey.  Would do the meatballs again, but perhaps try a different sauce, something less sweet...

I thought the actual meatball was bland.  The sauce was helpful, but I'd prefer a tastier meatball to go with this sauce.

I tripled this recipe for a family function of about 20+ people and they were a HUGE hit. Out of all the appetizers that were on the table these meatballs were the first to go. Everyone was telling me how amazing they were and asking me for this recipe. This is definitely a keeper for me!!

Made this for teacher snack day.  I must admit I took the lazy way out and used frozen meatballs.  Having said that, the sauce for this is AMAZING!  Everyone loved and said it was definitely better than the usual sauce made with grape jelly.  Will make again for sure.

This is the 1st time I ever attempted meatballs and I really loved these. The sauce was really good. Tripled the recipe and took them to a baby shower. I had very little left over and had some requests for the recipe. 
The funny thing is, the entire time I was adding the sauce ingredients, I kept wrinkling my nose and thinking "this can't be good". I mean, cranberry sauce, chili sauce & lemon juice. Wow. But it was very good. 
I actually made these the day before I needed them. I baked the meatballs on a broiler pan so the grease would drip down and not pool around the meatballs. I then just placed them in a container, poured the sauce over them, put a lid on them and threw them in the fridge. The next morning at 8am, I dumped it all in the slow cooker to heat before the 1:00 baby shower. Perfect. 
The only change I made was adding a bit more minced onions and the bread crumbs were Italian flavored. That little bit of flavor didn't overwhelm the sauce at all.

Great taste, but even in my older slow cooker (does not get very hot) they started to burn after a few hours.  I would just have to watch the time next time.

What a tasty, quick and EASYrecipe!  I made this twice over the holidays and it was ahuge hit!  I opted to use the frozen cocktail meatballs to save time.  I put everything in the crockpot and set the temp. to low.  6-8 hours later they were ready...and PERFECT!  Thanks for a great crowd pleaser!

GREAT RECIPE! Thanks so much for sharing. I have made this probably 30 times and always gotten rave reviews! I make my meatballs a little different- 1 lb ground meat, 1 pk. pork stuffing mix, 1 egg, 1/2 c. chopped onion, 1/2 c. milk, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder. Also, for the sauce I add 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper and a splash of worchesteshire sauce. One of my favorites, thanks again!!!

Yum.  I made these in a crockpot and they came out great.  I bought frozen swedish meatballs from BJ's Wholesale Club.  I would normally make my own meatballs, but was short on time.  These were awesome.  I turned the crockpot on high, added 2 cans of jellied cranberry sauce, a bottle and 1/2 of chile sauce and the remaining ingredients.  When I first saw what the sauce looked like I thought "yuck" this will not be good, but I was so wrong.  I let the sauce get a little warm and then added the meatballs and just left it.  I left it on high for about 4 hours and then stirred and turned it down to low.  I left the crockpot on low all day and throughout the party and they were fine.  They were a big hit and will definitely make again. It's so easy if you buy the meatballs already made!  Great appetizer to bring to a party.

If you like super sweet sauces, then I guess this would work.  The cranberry sauce was an overkill.  I ended up using the entire 12 bottle of chili sauce, and that still wasn’t enough. Finally I added an 8 ounce of tomato sauce to save the taste.  They did taste a little like meatloaf balls, but still not bad.  The meatballs were a little bland also.

This recipe reminds me of my grandmothers swedish meatball recipe except its quicker and allows for you to drain the grease off the meatballs after you cook them in the oven! I was very impressed with the recipe and will be making them many many more times!! Yum!

Absolutely LOVED it! Perfect amount of sweet with still a zing to it that makes it stand out and memorable.  Plus the meatballs were deliciously moist on the inside.  I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing about it.

Made this three times so far. Went over well, every meatball was taken. Was just asked to make them again so thought I would go ahead and rate this and say DO IT, if you were deciding if you wanted to make these or not. :)

Starting making this 2 years ago.  My kids love it and request it everytime we all get together.  I do add extra minced onions and use Italian bread crumbs.  Make a triple batch every time.  Definitely a keeper.

The sauce was fantastic and went really well with the meat.  But the meatball itself was missing something that I can't put my finger on.  Something like salt, tomato paste or garlic or a combo.  I think once you find your favorite meatball recipe, this sauce is great to cook them in.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe!! I cut down the prep time on it at Christmas by using prepared meatballs that you can purchase in the frozen food section.
I took these in a crock-pot to 3 Christmas functions- Not a meatball was stirring after everyone got their fair share.

These were a HUGE HIT at the New Year's Eve party I brought them to. I used frozen meatballs (plain NOT Italian) due to time constraints. Super easy recipe and definitely a crowd pleaser. Tip: DO NOT overcook! Meatballs start to fall apart.

Excellent meetballs, fresh and simple to make. I tweeted the sauce and used one 32 Oz jar of grape jelly, two 12 Oz jars of chili sauce heat and when melted add the meetballs. The longer they sit the more flavor they will have.

This is absolutely a keeper! I personally dont eat beef so i used turkey, brought to potluck so i followed the recipe almost exactly until i realized that the cranberry jelly sauce can i used was over than 8 oz, it's about 12 oz (348 ml ocean spray) anyway, i fixed and adjusted chilli sauce to the recipe, it turned out wonderfully. Additionally, i added a dash of soy sauce and hot sauce for a nice colour and a kick. My bf doesn't like cranberry sauce in general, but he loves this meatballs. With turkey,it prolly wont turn out as good as beef, but for me the sauce has lift up everything all together. Next time will make with beef meatballs.

I made these for the Super Bowl game.  I followed the sauce recipe exactly and used frozen home style meatballs in the crock pot.  The cranberry flavor was too much, and we couldn't really taste any other flavors.  The sauce was just too sweet.  I think I will try something else next time.

These are tasty and everyone loves at parties. I use frozen homestyle meatballs from Walmart though which is 2 lbs so I double the chili sauce, lemon juice, and brown sugar and use the entire 15 oz can of cranberry sauce. and per the suggestion of another reviewer, make the sauce in a pan, pour over meatballs and let sit overnight in fridge to develop flavor. They are always gone by end of the party but I wonder how much better they would be with homemade meatballs. When I have leftovers, I sometimes put a few over white jasmine rice mixed with sautéed onions, green peppers and pineapple. Makes a great weekday meal.

Love, love, love this recipe!  I always make a huge batch so that I can freeze some for a later date (and I use pre-made/pre-cooked meatballs from GFS Marketplace stores). I've made this exactly to the directions, and I've also used a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of Heinz Chili sauce and Szechuan chili sauce.  This gives it a good kick if you like a little zip added.  Each way is good, I just thought I would share a nice spin on it if you like to change it up once in a while.  Thanks for the recipe Lara!

Turned out perfect! I used frozen meatballs instead. Good flavor and the consistency was just what I was looking for, not too runny.  Modified a couple things though, I used a full 12 ounce bottle of Heinz Chili sauce and a 14 ounce can of jellied cranberry sauce. Definitely will keep this one. Super easy to make :) and yummy

Made this recipe and used frozen meatballs which I heated up in the oven. I added a couple of drops of orange oil to the sauce which added a really nice spark of citrus. I've added the orange oil to bottled barbeque sauce for brisket and always get compliments.

Delicious, I've been making these meatballs for a couple years now and they are the best!  I even use the meatball recipe with other sauces and cook them in a frying pan on my stovetop when I don't have time for it to slowcook.  I'll make batches and freeze them without sauce for a quick dinner.

A big hit and easy to make ahead of time.  I doubled the recipe, using 1/2 ground turkey , 1/2 ground beef and onion powder (since DH doesn't like onions).  They turned out tasty and moist!!  Doubled the sauce (almost) with 1 - 16oz can jellied cranberries and 1 - 12oz jar Heinz Chili Sauc + 6oz water. Turned out well.  Thanks!!

These were great. I made them for my son's poetry recital at school, and they were gone in an instant. I used a packet of lipton onion soup as suggested and also added some minced garlic and some German seasoning, because I had no parsley. They were amazing! Thanks for sharing...

I've made this recipe twice... the first time I ran out of chili sauce so I only used about 1/4 cup.  The second time I made this recipe I used the suggested 3/4 cup of chili sauce.  The people that had eaten it both times (I'm a vegetarian, so I'm basing it on what people said) said it was MUCH better the first time. So, if I make it again I'll put a lot less chili sauce than the recipe suggests.

In reference to the reviewer who said cran. sauce comes in 16 oz. cans, it also comes in 8 oz. small cans, many brands.  I buy it all the time because I often eat alone.  Loved the recipe and the change from grape jelly.  I know it is faster to use store bought frozen meatballs, but I find the texture to get spongy in the crockpot so I make the extra effort to make them myself.

Yummy and easy!!  Doubled the recipe, and used a mix of veal, pork, and beef for the meatballs.  Simmered the sauce alone for about an hour and transferred the sauce and meatballs to the crockpot and kept them on low.  Will definitely make again!

This sauce recipe was given to me by a dear friend about 20 years ago to be used on cocktail weiners.  It is by far the best recipe I have ever made.  I've used it on both meatballs and cocktail weiners and I always have request for the recipe.

Made this as an appetizer  for my sister's birthday. I used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, I find bread crumbs a bit tasteless. Also left out the onion since I wasn't sure if all the guests would prefer or not. Had to use whole cranberry sauce, couldn't find jellied this time of year. No worries, everyone LOVED them. Warning: these are very addicting...you can't eat just one!

Very tasty, I did change some small details. I used 1/2 real onion chopped, which cooks just fine in the oven. I was also in a time crunch and while the meatballs were cooking in the oven I cooked the sauce, but it was not breaking up well, so I got my hand mixer to make the sauce ingredients nice and smooth. (No cranberry sauce lumps)

I found this recipe on this sight about seven years ago, and everytime I make it, EVERYONE loves it.  It's much better than the grape jelly and bbq sauce recipes.  It's also very easy.  After 7 years, I am still using it.

I made these this past weekend for a holiday party and they were a huge success...I rolled the meatballs the night before and refrigerated them and then put them straight into my slow cooker about 3 hours before the party the next day-(I never cooked them in the oven first like the recipe stated) and they were awesome and very tender...Super Recipe...I'll be making them again this weekend for another party!

What can a say that hasn't already been said?  Excellent recipe. Since finding this recipe I have made literally hundreds of these meatballs-- for a couple of wedding receptions, several family gatherings/parties, birthdays, and holidays.  They are always a huge success. Once I made them for a wedding reception, and two weeks later one of the wedding guests and I saw each other at the store and she was STILL talking about how great the meatballs were-- nothing about the flowers, or the dress, or the music, or the bride and groom! A million thanks-yous for this great recipe.  The cranberry sauce adds a great taste.  Sometimes (depending on the crowd)when I make a large batch, I use half the cranberry sauce and replace the other half with the more traditional grape jelly.  This way works well too.

I had a large frozen bag of already-seasoned Italian meatballs and used half the bag (approx. 5 dozen) for the amount of sauce the recipe calls for.  Very tasty!!  I made this two Sundays in a row for a bunch of football-crazed fans and it was a hit!  It could use a bit more chili so I added some tabasco sauce the second time around but next time I'll try find another way to add some kick.  The sauce doesn't seem to be enough but you don't need the meatballs to swim in it.  I served it in my slow cooker with a pack of toothpicks....great for appetizers!

I made these for a party in a slow cooker, and most of them were gone by the end of the party. Like a few others, I "cheated" and used frozen store-bought meatballs in the interest of saving time. The sauce was flavorful and not too sweet.

Amazing recipe! I make it with ground turkey. I added both fresh chopped onion and lipton soup mix (1/2 package).  And I used crushed corn flakes the second time, instead of bread crumbs. Definitely super yummy when doing them homemade compared to frozen. I love how easy this recipe is too!

I use this meatball recipe often, and then I'll either make the sauce from this recipe, or I'll buy Ikea's Swedish Meatball sauce packet and use that for sauce. Or just make them plain for regular old spaghetti and meatballs. It's a good, easy, standard meatball recipe that's always a hit, no matter what kind of sauce.

This has been an extended-family favorite for several years. To cut down on time, I use frozen turkey meatballs (w/o Italian seasoning). Since the recipe only calls for 8 oz cranberry sauce, I use the whole can of whole-berry cranberry sauce, the entire jar of Heinz Chili Sauce, 2 Tb brown sugar, and 1 Tbsp lemon juice; mix the sauce together and pour over the meatballs, and heat in the slow cooker, stirring occasionally. Serve with decorative toothpicks (or plain ones, depending on who's eating them!) with small plates and plenty of napkins. My SIL liked this so much, I gave her the recipe, and now she always serves it when we arrive. Two thumbs up!

Best recipe ever. Easy to make, and so tasty. Just a few changes - added a ts of cinnamon and a ts of honey. It's hard to have lots of leftovers with these little meatballs. Will make again for sure.

I seem to be in the minority here, but I just didn't like them.  The meatballs didn't have enough flavor, and the sauce tasted too much like ketchup to me.  I had them in a crockpot during my party, and there were a LOT leftover.  One person did say he really liked them, but that was all the feedback I got.  Needless to say, I won't be making them again.

I was just trying to figure out what to do with a left over can of cranberry sauce when i found this recipe.  The sauce was incredible it blew everybody away.  They were shocked to hear it was made with cranberry sauce. For the chile sauce i used a spicy ketchup.

Fantastic! I thought they were a little too sweet, but others strongly disagreed with me. :) I baked the meatballs from scratch, using Onion Soup Mix instead of the onion, and refrigerated them for a few hours. I then put them in the crockpot for about 2 hours on low. Next time, I'll try using precooked meatballs and let them simmer longer in the crockpot, but I will definitely be making this again!

Just had these a few minutes ago and the whole family loved them! Especially our 2 year old!

I used a 24 oz bag of frozen turkey meatballs and a full 14 oz can of jellied cranberry sauce, so increased the sauce ingredients by almost double. Left them covered in a saucepan about 25 minutes. They were great!

Fabulous! Flavorful but very kid friendly. Some reviews complained that the meatballs were bland, but you WANT that with a zippy sauce! I don't want heavy seasonings competing with the sauce! Just as good with lean ground turkey. Bake ahead and freeze, stir the sauce together and refridgerate overnight with the meatballs thawing, then put into the crockpot to warm it all up the next day. Makes cooking for a party easier.

I made these as suggested for a birthday party and they were gone before I knew it.  A little time consuming, but so worth the effort.  A hundred times better than store bought.  The great part is that once the prep is done, you just leave them be.  They can sit in the slow cooker on low and taste fabulous.

II followed the recipe except I don't like chopping onions so I used 2 Tbsp of dried chopped onions.  I Made these for a potluck yesterday and they disappeared quickly!  Next time i would double the sauce.  I kept these warm in a crock pot!  Thanks for sharing!

These were okay.  Some liked 'em, some didn't.  I ended up rinsing what was leftover and freezing 'em.  I'll add 'em to a marinara.

When you use all ground beef these meat balls are dry. I use meat and pork they have a better flavor and are much more moist. I use Jimmy Deans pork sausage, he has a many flavor to choose from. I due add additional spices that fit into the type of flavor that one prefers.

I made these twice, and found that I prefer using Bennetts Original Chili Sauce vs Heinz Chili Sauce as some have recommended. The Heinz sauce was too ketchupy for my taste. With the Bennetts the sauce is sweet/tangy which I love.  Can't comment on the meatballs since I cheated and used frozen "homestyle".

These were a total hit at the last 2 parties I had! When I was planning the menu for my Dad's 60th, I got specific requests for these meatballs. I take the easy route and buy bags of pre-made Swedish-style meatballs from BJ's wholesale club ($9.99 a bag). They work like a charm!

Are you kidding?  I don't mean to be rude; however, we thought these were awful.  I have decided to rinse the sauce off and give the dogs a few in their dinner bowls. I think this is the first negative review I have given any recipe from this site.  I guess that is why they say to each their own.

These are awesome but I cheated a little. I bought Italian style meatballs already made from the grocery store and took a shortcut to make them quick and easier.I still used the sauce recipe and omitted making the meatballs. They were good though.

My daughter made this recipe for me & her dad, but, it was called 'Cranberry Glazed Meatballs'. It is THE best & easiest recipe EVER! My daughter baked them, but, I think the slow cooker would be great, too!
My daughter has made them by baking the meatballs first & THEN spooning the sauce over & also, spooning the sauce over & THEN baking them. Both ways are great! I like the sauce spooned over before baking the best!
She brought them tail-gating & they went over better than anything!
Great as a main dish or SNACK! Glad I came across this!

I made these for a Xmas potluck.  All women, ages 18 - 75. I doubled the recipe and had about 50 meatballs.  I can home with six.  They loved it.

I used Sriracha Chili sauce and it made the whole sauce entirely TOO spicy and I love spicy, hot food. It took me an hour to tame down the heat of the sauce and that was after adding a ton of ketchup, grape and apricot jelly. If you do use Sriracha, I would strongly suggest starting with 1/4 cup and adding to taste after that.

I usually use Costco Italian style meatballs with chili sauce and grape jelly which have always been a crowd-pleaser. I decided to try something different for my step-daughters baby shower with 35 guests.  I decided on this recipe because it was so highly rated and had to triple the recipe.  For the sake of time, I used Lipton onion soup mix as suggested by other reviewers but did not alter the remainder of the recipe in any way.  They probably would have been better with minced onions because the seasonings in the soup mix altered the flavor.  I mistakenly made them twice the size they should have been and ended up with only 55 meatballs, not enough for the party. I asked my husband to do a taste test and he preferred the meatballs I usually make, as did I.  I ended up taking the Costco grape jelly chili sauce meatballs to the party and they were a hit.  They were the food that had no leftovers.  I will stick with my old stand-by.  By the way, a lot of reviewers have advised against using frozen Italian meatballs with this sauce. I think Costco's meatballs would work just fine as the Romano cheese and spices are not over-powering.

Made these by the recipe with one exception, I added a half teaspoon of salt to the meatballs before baking.  They were still a bit bland for me.  Sauce flavor is interesting but not one that I will repeat at our house.  My husband's comment was "I'll bet these meatballs would be great with barbeque sause.

I'd give the recipe as-is 4 stars but after adding a bit of extra lemon juice, cutting the brown sugar in half, and adding about a half teaspoon of Tabasco (enough to add some depth but not enough to make it spicy), the sauce was perfect! I doubled the recipe and added a couple cloves of garlic as well as some Worcestershire to the beef (because I don't think I've ever made anything with ground beef without garlic and Worcestershire). They were a hit, people were sopping up the sauce with bread and crackers after all the meatballs were gone!

such a great flavor.  I did not have lemon juice or brown sugar but I just add regular sugar.  Instead of ground beef I use ground turkey.  simply amazing.  will definitely make again.  next time I will probably use frozen beef meatballs instead for a quick appetizer.

I used my meatball baker pan to drain the grease from the meatballs which makes them tastier. I have always been a fan of cranberries so I and everyone else really enjoyed them.

Fantastic recipe!  I baked my meatballs and then transferred to the crockpot to simmer away.  I won best appetizer dish at my Christmas Party with these!  The cranberry sauce is a nice change from the traditional grape jelly.

This got rave reviews from friends at a recent get together.Several wanted the recipe. The only change I made was to use gluten-free bread crumbs. Very good.

Saw this recipe in the Allrecipes Dec/Jan 2014 magazine, decided to make them today,  and put in the freezer for the upcoming Holidays.  I used a 1 Tbsp scoop which makes the perfect-sized appetizer meatballs (got 32) and baked for 22 minutes.  The meatballs were very moist and flavorful, but my hubby said he actually prefers the "old-fashioned way" made with grape jelly instead of cranberry sauce.

I have made these a bunch of times.  I swap out the minced onion for the Lipton soup mix as others suggested, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.  I get tons of compliments every time I make them.  They're fantastic and so easy!

I have made these meatballs for years, your recipe is close to my Mother's except for the lemon juice.  A lot of times I just make bigger meatballs and have them for dinner along with some mashed potato's.

These meatballs were perfect! Very delicious and easy to make. They are the perfect blend of sweet and heat. I served these as an appetizer to keep my guests held over until I was finished with the main dish and they called me out of the kitchen saying "if you want any of the meatballs you'd better hurry, they're almost gone!". I didn't use frozed meatballs as others did but maybe would consider it if I was serving more guests. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the ingredients to a tee..While my family enjoyed them, they didn't rave about them, I got a couple of comments saying they needed more salt and pepper. I don't know if the recipe relies on the chili sauce to cover the salty side of this dish but I guess it depends on what brand you get. Maybe with practice I can improve how they come out in the future..

I have tried similar recipes, using frozen meatballs (to cut on prep time) and grape jelly in place of cranberry sauce.  I took them to pot luck lunch and they were all eaten!

These were a big hit! I used GFS frozen meatballs with their canned chili sauce (great value if making as many as I did- 10lbs!). They were just the right amount of sweet and savory. I should have put them on high in the crockpot to begin with though as I did not mix the sauce first, I just dumped everything in and let it melt together. It took a long time for them to start bubbling... All in all a great recipe for the sauce!

Some reviewers said that the meatballs seemed to be flavorless.  Instead of the minced onion, I substituted 1 package of "Lipton Onion Soup Mix".  Other than that, made exactly as stated and it was very good!

I made these once with store bought meatballs and once with the recipe.  The store bought meatball one turned out great.  When I made them from scratch, I used Panko breadcrumbs.  I cooked and cooked them and they just never seemed to really firm up.  Some of them were breaking apart as people tried to scoop them up from the crockpot.  They tasted good but were brittle.

The sauce is really good.  It's pretty sweet, though.    I made the sauce and meatballs separately the night before, mixed them together, and let them sit overnight.  Threw them in the crockpot on low about an hour before the party and it was perfect!  If it weren't for all the extra fat and garbage ingredients they put in storebought meatballs, I would say that's totally the way to go as I didn't feel the flavor was any better in the from scratch ones once the sauce was put on.

I made these yesterday for fathers day. I forgot to take a picture, but i have left overs so I will. But they looked good and smelled delicious and were even better when you bit into them! I also used frozen meatballs (just short on time) and extra brown sugar (probably put 1/2 cup if not alittle more) and my parents really liked them! Def a good appetizer!*

I made these meatballs for my friends baby shower, and they were a big hit. Everyone really loved them and went back for seconds, even men! I will always make these for parties. They were so easy to make, and I am amazed at how delicious this combination is.

Overall, I gave the results a resounding "Eh." Not bad, but not what I was expecting from the other reviews.

The meatball mix sounded bland, so I added a sprinkling of salt, pepper, garlic powder, dried parsley, and red pepper flakes. It tasted OK. I didn't think the onion was overwhelming, as some said, but the meatballs were a little mushy.

I ended up using more chili sauce than the recipe called for because after putting all the meatballs in the crockpot there did not seem to be enough sauce. I bought a small generic bottle from WalMart, and it wasn't too spicy. The finished sauce wasn't bad, it just tasted like sweet & sour sauce from Chinese takeout. I'm not sure I liked it with beef---I might have tried it with ground pork or turkey instead.

I give the recipe as-is only two stars.

These meatballs are delicious! I'm used to making the grape jelly/chili sauce version, and thought this was a nice changeup. Personally, I would never use frozen meatballs unless in an absolute rush. If making from scratch, definitely use a broiler pan when baking so the fat runs off nicely. I think this recipe is perfect as-is!

I admit, I cheated a bit...I used frozen meatballs, but the sauce is very tasty!! This is so easy to make and is perfect for parties or even just if you want a small appetizer for two. So yummy! A classic and a keeper!

Delicious recipe.  My husband & I really enjoyed the meatballs.  I think next time I will reduce the amount of onion used.  But if you like a lot of onion, don't change it.

I cheated and used store-bought pre-cooked turkey meatballs to save time and browned according to the package.  I used this sauce.  I made a double recipe for a party and there was not one meatball left.

The meatballs could have used a little salt or seasoning to offset the sweetness of the sauce. But it still was delicious!

I work a the VFW in my area and I worked Christmas day. Was looking for something to make that was easy to make to bring in to work so people would have something to eat. It was part of a buffet we had. It was a great hit and was the only dish that was empty. In no time at all, everyone was asking "where are the meatballs?" They were gone!!!! I made it exactly as the recipe called for and they were just great. I will make these again and again. Everyone raved about them and kept asking who made them. They were so easy to make. I did use frozen meatballs tho as I was pressed for time. I could have made them that morning but wasn't sure how easy they were so I made them the night before and palced them in a crock pot and left them on low over night. The cranberry sauce was much better than a recipe I used before with grape jelly. They weren't as sweet. This recipe is a keeper for me.

My only change was that I used Sri Racha Rooster chili sauce - I'm not sure if this is what the author meant by "Chili Sauce" and they were too spicy for some of the guests and adored for their spiciness for others.  I would use less Rooster sauce next time!

I used leftover homemade wholeberry cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving that had been pureed in the food processor and left out the lemon juice.  These were very good.  Thanks Lara.

Followed this recipe to the 'T' (used frozen meatballs though) and I have to say...I am impressed!  The flavor of each meatball explodes in your mouth, keeping you constantly wanting more.  I could've had 50lbs of these!  I served these at a party last night and it was a big hit; they were gone in minutes.  My only regret is not having more meatballs on hand to keep my guests happy.

Great recipe, but I was in a hurry so I bought a bag of cocktail meatballs from Albertson's, then made the sauce on the stove, then poured it on top of the frozen meatballs in a slow cooker and let it heat on high for an hour. Had to deliver to my (teacher) daughter's classroom. One thing, many of these cocktail meatball recipes call for "chili sauce" but they don't say what kind. As I searched through the store I found at least 5 different kinds from mild to very hot asian type. I settled on a Thai sweet and spicy sauce made by Maggi, then followed the rest of the recipe.

Good recipe, these meatballs were a hit at a party I had. This is almost the exact same recipe as in Joy of Cooking except that corn flake crumbs are substitued for bread crumbs and the amounts are  slightly different in the sauce.

As is, the cranberry flavor is too overpowering.  I changed it by adding some diet coke, seasoned salt and about a 1/8 cup barbeque sauce.  Really great after the additions.

These were a hit at our party. I also cheated and bought meatballs this time. I also added the whole bottle of chili sauce (12 oz.) and let it sit in the crockpot for a couple hours.  Yummy!

The flavors just do not work together and I find the high reviews baffling.  I tossed it all since I was lucky that I made and tasted it ahead of time.  Plain chili sauce would have been fine.

Delish!  ground turkey is better than beef in this recipe.  it's less greasy and not swimming in fat.  can't tell it's "turkey"

These are excellent! I have made them every year now for my parents holiday party. Well except last year, and boy did I get the cold shoulder from everyone who really wanted to eat them up again! So I am making them this year, I can't wait! I like to use the Garlic Chili Sauce and ground turkey. Very very tasty going to be making it tomorrow!

They were all gone.  So, I guess everyone liked them at our dinner.  I only tasted them for seasoning.  Thank you very much for sharing with us.

These were great from the get-go.  I used frozen meatballs instead since I was so busy making everything else for Thanksgiving.  I love recipes that call for only a few ingredients, because then you can get the little ones in the family to dump everything together, and they like eating it more because they made it, and it makes it more fun for them and easy for you.

Fantastic! Took these to a party where they were quickly devoured. Loved the flavor blend of the cranberry sauce with the chili sauce, brown sugar and lemon. Much more flavorful than the old style grape jelly recipe. I used store bought meatballs to save time and wouldn't hesitate to do it again. Great appetizer recipe... this one's a keeper!

These always go over very well.  When I can't find chili sauce I substitute half ketchup and half hot sauce and they turn out great.

Everybody at my work potluck loved these even though i made a slight mistake on the recipe.  I read "chile" sauce instead of "chili" sauce.  So after putting 3/4 cup of spicy Sriracha sauce into the mix these meatballs became something else altogether.  Very good, but not for the faint-hearted.

Reading the other reviews, I noticed that the happiest outcomes involved store-bought meatballs.  Since I was making my own, I decided to spice up that part of the recipe, adding salt, pepper, garlic powder, snipped fresh parsley, and a tsp. of horseradish.  I still wasn't wowed by the flavor.  I used 93% lean meat and baked the meatballs in the oven for 25 minutes before finishing them off in the crockpot with the sauce for 2 hours.  I didn't have quite enough cranberry sauce on hand so I substituted an equal amount of strawberry-rhubarb jam and left out the brown sugar.  It was sweeter than I prefer, but the party goers to whom I served them seemed content.  I got about 3 dozen small meatballs out of a pound of hamburger.

Make sure to use full fat regular old groud beef for this.  I tried using really lean groung beef and they ended up going to waste.  I ate some, but they werent a big hit like the time I used the fattening stuff!  Otherwise this is a great recipe.

I have tried this recipe twice and although it is very easy and seems to be a good base recipe, I think some extras are needed to make this a 5 star recipe. Both times I made the meatballs, they were very bland and tasteless. Extra garlic salt, onion powder, and/or a mexican/smokey-type seasoning would add the necessary taste. The sauce was better and may benefit from the addition of some liquid smoke. Overall, this is a keeper recipe, but needs additions to make is perfect.

Have made these for years, and they are always a huge hit.  They are always requested or expected at parties.  I never bring any home.  And I use the frozen Italian meatballs too.  And the longer they simmer in the sauce the better they are.

Have made this a zillion times...Original recipe was in 'Treasure For My Daughter' a wonderful book published 40 years ago in Montreal chuck full of recipes for all the Jewish holidays. My Mother made this and wrote it down ( calling it 'Sweet and Sour Meatballs') and I have passed on to my daughter. My grand daughter adores this served over rice. Always wonderful...and  as with most cooked meats..even better the second day. Freezes beautifully too.

I made these with ground turkey breast -- the super lean type.  To make the meatballs moist, I soaked fresh bread crumbs in 2 Tbsp half-n-half before mixing with the onion, egg and turkey.  I added 1Tbsp horseradish, a grated carrot and 1tsp salt for extra flavor.  Because the turkey was so lean, instead of baking the meatballs and draining the fat, I simply dropped them raw into the hot sauce in the crock pot and let them cook in the sauce for about 4 hrs on low.    I didn't think the added sugar was needed in the sauce, but they were delicious!

I love this recipe - easy and delicious. I use a 32oz bag of farm rich frozen meatballs and bake them in a pan w/rack for 30min at 400. Cook the sauce on the stove (double the sauce recipe for a 32oz bag of meatballs). Then the meatballs and sauce go in the crockpot. Sometimes I throw in a small bag of lil smokies in the with meatballs and sauce.

The meatballs by themselves were delicious. Now the sauce.... between my experience and various reviews I read, I think the chili sauce in the recipe needs to be a specific brand. I used Sriracha chili sauce (red sauce, green cap, rooster on the bottle) and I thought 3/4cup sounded like a lot, so I used 1/4 cup. I LOVE spicy foods but my mouth was on fire!! Whatever chili sauce it is in the original recipe must be like ketchup with a pinch of hot. I cannot fathom using 3/4 cup of sriracha chili sauce in this recipe. I will use the meatball recipe again but I do not recommend this sauce recipe.

Used frozen meatballs and just tossed them in the crockpot with a can of cranberry sauce, 2 bottles of chili sauce, some brown sugar and the lemon juice.  Turned it up to high and they were done in 3 hours.  It was so easy and very, very tasty.  Low cost and very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe!

Just a very quick note to "Army Wife."  Tabasco Sauce is in no way, shape or form considered Chili Sauce.  It's a Pepper Sauce.  You will find Chili Sauce right along side Ketchup in most Grocery Stores.  I have not tried this recipe as of yet but from all the reviews it looks like a WINNER!!!  I suggest you try the recipe again but this time with Chili Sauce.  FYI.....The Chili Sauce I use is "Heinz Chili Sauce" but I am sure any brand will do.  Giver 'er a GO!!!!!!!!!

Had rave reviews from everyone at my holiday party for these!!    My edits: I doubled the recipe and sautéed the onion (and garlic).  I used 1lb each of lean ground beef and turkey.  I added the Worcestershire sauce and substituted the water for ketchup like another review suggested.  The sauce was a little sweet for me, so I added a few bay leaves and a little bit of cumin.  Next time I'll probably leave out most of the brown sugar.    But seriously: YUM!  And just an FYI for others not familiar with chili sauce - look next to the cocktail sauce - not in the Asian isle!

I made this recipe and it was so hot that the flavor of the chili sauce was overbearing.  I used the chili sauce in the asian aisle with the rooster.  Am I missing something??

Loved them!

I made homemade cranberry sauce (recipe from here I believe...12 oz cranberries, 1 cup orange juice--or 1/2 water 12 orange juice, 1 cup sugar, cook until berries pop, then mashed with potato masher) instead of the nasty canned stuff.

Also, instead of chili sauce, I used ketchup with a splash of balsamic vinegar, 1 T garlic powder and 1 t minced onions because all the chili sauce options at my grocery store were chock full of high fructose corn syrup.

Because my cranberry sauce comes out so thick, I added a cup of water to the simmering step. I also left out the brown sugar since I used brown sugar in my cranberry sauce.

The meatballs turned out amazing! My mom, the best cook ever, loved them.

Thank you to the recipe author for the inspiration!

They are great. I did make a few changes only because i didn't have chili sauce. So i added ketchup and added Franks Hot sauce and hot chili powder. I added a lot more brown sugar too.

I made these just before Christmas so we could snack on it while making Christmas cookies.  The kids were eating more meatballs than cookies!  I doubled the recipe and it was still gone in less than 30 minutes.

These were really tasty.  I made the meatballs as stated in the recipe but added a little salt and pepper to them.  When making the sauce, I used an entire 16 ounce can of cranberry sauce. These were good the day I made them, but I think even tastier the next day reheated.  It was as though the flavors had time to develope more.  All in all a very good recipe that I will make again.

I loved this recipe. I used a little more onion but I do really suggest to add some sort of saltiness to the meatballs themselves because it is a little underseasoned-- probably a bit of soy sauce and herb would be great. I had them at a Christmas party and I thought they were great.

OK, I totally cheat with this recipe.  I used the frozen, premade meatballs and I throw it all in the slow cooker.  And holy goodness, this is so yummy.  I made them for my in-laws to bring to a potluck and people ended up eating these as a sandwich because the main coursed was so bad.  Heh.  Thanks!!!!!

These were great! I accidently used Asian chili sauce and WWWOOOHH, that was some spicy sauce! I added another can of cranberry sauce and more brown sugar, that seemed to make it just right for me and my husband.  But we like stuff hot. I also noted one reviewer added Lipton Onion Soup mix into the meat instead of onions and I did that as well.  They turned out perfect and I will definatly make them again!

These are SO good! I made these as an appetizer for a dinner party and the guests (boys especially!) loved them. In fact, after my boyfriend and his roommate tasted them, they went out to the store and bought another bag of frozen meatballs so I could make a second batch. 

Now, we're going to host a super bowl party and several people have specifically said they're only coming if I make meatballs. 

Thanks for the great recipe! (I followed the directions for the sauce exactly)

These were best after having set in the crockpot for a few hours!  Got lots of compliments.  

I've made a few times now and this last time I made the meatballs & sauce the night before and refridgerated (seperatley) then put in the slow cooker an hour before my party.  This worked great, but I recommend at least 2 hours for simmering if you do this to get them totally hot!

What did I do wrong?  Tried these, but the flavor is weird and the sauce seemed too thick (and not enough).  We couldn't eat these.  Won't make again.

Home run!  I made this over Christmas '04, New Years '05 and a recent family gathering. I turn around and they are all gone!  I add a package of Little Smokies for variety. Crockpot on high for the 1st hour and then 2 hrs on low--if you are a crock pot cooker--you'll know how to adjust heat so meatballs don't get too soft.  I use a store brand cranberry sauce as the good stuff seems too sweet!  But this gal has the perfect recipe for a meatball as far as bread crumbs and liquid.  I added some parm cheese and pepper and it was hard not to eat them ALL as they came out of the oven nice and hot and browned...YUMMA!

I made this for a work party and everyone seemed to like it.  I thought the sauce was too sweet when I followed the recipe exactly.  I did add about 2 T. of barbecue sauce to make it a little more smoky in flavor.  I might cut back on brown sugar, or leave it out entirely, next time.

My mom makes this exact same recipe, except instead of cranberry jelly she uses Welchs grape jelly and Heinz chili sauce, and it is great.  That is how I make it as well!

Excellent!  Made enough for my husband's retirement party ....everybody was raving!  I actually didn't have time to make little meatballs so I used store bought and let them cook in the crockpot all night long....so tender and delicious.  will definitely make them again.  Thanks Lara!

The tangy sauce of the cranberry made everyone want to try another one.   I used ground turkey and ground beef but I think if I make this again I will use just hamburger.

These were excellent, everyone loved them.  I used frozen meatballs instead of cooking my own.
I made my own chili sauce out of the following recipe: 28 oz. can diced tomatoes, 1 small onion chopped, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 Tbsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. allspice, 1/2 tsp. cloves, boil & simmer for 15 minutes and then puree in a blender.

I really liked the sauce but didn't care for the meatballs.  Next time I make them I will use my own meatballs and the original sauce.

The meatballs for this recipe are very quick and easy to make, and just dropping them in the sauce to simmer was very convenient.  I would maybe combine the cranberry sauce with a tiny bit of grape jelly, however, as some might find 100% cranberry sauce a bit too tart.  Otherwise, I've noticed that the meatballs just....disappear.  Chop up the onions and such VERY finely, as too chunky pieces will ruin the overall effect.  A little green pepper would be good with these, as well...

These cocktail meatballs are the best!! I cheated and used frozen meatballs. I bought the small cocktail size meatballs, they come in regular size  too.  I added 1Tb of Worcestershire sauce and that's it!  Excellent!!!

Savory and sweet! This is by far my favorite dish ever! I've made it for family, friends, events and more! They are ALWAYS a huge hit! We eat them for dinner every month. The preparation is an easy way to get the whole family involved. All ages too!

The marvelous thing about this recipes that it is adaptable to just about any clear jelly, Apple, Grape, Current, actually I've never fixed it with Cranberry but I'll try it.  I have made them with frozen meatballs but be sure to buy the best frozen meatball you can buy, not one with a ton of filler.

Good flavor, very sweet.  Made  these again for holiday. My suggestion is to double the recipe so there are enough for your party guests. The homemade meatballs are small and if you use the recipe that is given, there are surely not enough if you are having more then four or five people.

Yummy and super popular at a potluck supper. You could make twice as many meatballs and still use the same amount of sauce; there was a lot of sauce leftover. Using a couple of suggestions, I added about 2T of ketchup and Lipton soup mix plus I used panko instead of regular crumbs because that's what I had.

Loved these! Although, I can't rate the meatballs, only the sauce. I use the 'Meatball Nirvana' recipe from this site (incredible!!) and the ones on this recipe seem would be a bit bland compared to those. Thats my only reason for not giving this a 5 star rating- the flavor of the actual meatballs outside of the sauce is incredibly important, it can make all the difference between a dry or bland dish underneath the sauce. And if your short on time, it is super easy to grab a package of frozen meatballs, thaw & throw the sauce on top in the crock pot! But the sauce was excellent- this was very well liked and disappeared pretty quickly. Will be saving this for future use, only with a more diverse & flavorful meatball.

Did not like these. I found them very sour tasting. Probably could do without the lemon. Update: these are a million times better the next day.

I thought this was very tasty however I did substitute one package Lipton onion soup mix instead of the onion. My husband on the other hand didn't care much for them. He doesn't like onion.

I used Kroger brand frozen Home style Meatballs.  These turned out DELICIOUS! I followed recipe pretty close except I used a larger can of jellied cranberry sauce, it was 14.4 oz I think.  And the meatballs came in a 2 lb bag. This made plenty of sauce, I put them in the crockpot on high for 3 or 4 hours then turned to low & cooked em for about a total of 5 or 6 hours. YUM!

I made my meat ball a head of time and froze them, saved a lot of time.
laid them out on a cook sheets in the freezer. I made around 100
and then put them in baggy. That way you can make as many as you like.
when ever you like. So very good.

Loved them and so did the guests! Very easy, made easier because I bought frozen meatballs instead of making my own. Made several dishes for T-Day Eve so I had to make it as easy as possible. I know they would have been even better if I did make my own!

I made these for our village christmas celebration a few years ago, and they were a big hit. Serving them from the slowcooker was easy. I used Ikea frozen meatballs and a sweet garlic chili sauce. As we are hosting the "umtrunk" again this year, the meatballs are back on the menu!

Really delicious!  I added one large clove of minced garlic and a handful of chopped parsley to my meatballs.  Also added a little crushed red pepper to the meatballs and cayenne to the sauce (but it's still not very spicy).

Well, I love cocktail meatballs and I have made them in the past and they came out GREAT!!!  This is the 3rd recipe that I have tried and can not get them to taste like the flavor I fell in love with.  The second recipe was with grape jelly and the 3rd was with the cranberry sauce, I just can't get it right, and I think my problem is the Chile sauce, the second recipe was with hot chile sauce, which I do not eat hot foods. The 3rd chile sauce I tried I used was just named; "chile sauce" but it was still hot.  After looking at some of the pictures I noticed Heinz makes a chile sauce I think maybe if I would have used this type of chile sauce it would have help my recipe or I think I need to go back to my menu's from years past to find that recipe that I fell in love with!

3/4 chili sauce?  Could not even eat .., and my husband and I love spicy. Thought the cranberry would cut the heat. Please tell me what kind of chili sauce was meant to be used. 
Thanks.

I followed the one review that suggested to double the recipe.  So glad I did as they were the hit of the Christmas dinner.  The only change I did was to double the brown sugar to make it alittle sweeter. I had to use meatloaf mix (beef/veal/pork)as that was what I had handy.They are even super cold.  This recipe was a hit with everyone and I really recommend it.

I wasn't too sure about these, but they turned out delicious. I threw in a bit of Dijon in the sauce and a bit of milk in the meat (they seemed a little dry). Very tasty. Thank you

Have made this one many times for many different groups. Always a favorite, never any leftovers!!  Many requests for the recipe.  In a pinch I have been known to use premade meatballs with very good results.

These meatballs were a hit at our Halloween potluck at work!  I used 5 pounds of ground venison and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. At the advice of a few other reviewers, added Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix in place of the minced onions. I plugged the crock pot in when I got to work at 6:30 AM, stirred a couple of times by 9:30 and went back to check again at 10:30 and they were already half gone! There were none left to take home for my deer-hunter husband to try but I will definitely make these again. Thanks for a simple, tasty recipe Lara.

I made this recipe, for a holiday party last year.  I used bought turkey meatballs and I made my own cranberry sauce, otherwise followed the instructions. We have about 70 people for an open house, style party, so these meatballs worked out great, because I could keep them in a crockpot on low. Everyone liked them and we were able to freeze the leftovers and have them for a quick meal with a salad, when we didn't have time to cook. One suggestion, I made the sauce the night before, let it cool and then put the meatballs and sauce in big gallon size bags and let them marinate in the fridge overnight. The meatballs stayed very moist.

I use recipe this for my homemade party meatballs.  This recipe is quick and easy and is so much better than using the processed-tasting frozen meatballs!  Instead of using the canned/bottled cranberries and chili sauce,I combine this with the Cranberry Sauce II (sal) and Chili Sauce (ELLENMEL) recipes on this site.

They were great!  Thought the recipe was wierd but needed something I could make ahead of time and freeze.  They were perfect.  I made them, put them in a ziplock and froze them and thawed right before serving. Will be making them again.  OH, and I made my own meatballs with onion soup mix added to the meatballs instead of real onion.  They were wonderful.

I made this for a Christmas Eve party and it was an instant hit!  
To make life easier, I made the meatballs a couple weeks ahead and put them in the freezer.  I didn't have fresh onion, so I used the suggestion of another reviewer and just added a package of onion soup mix.  It gave the meatballs a nice spice and made it a little easier to prepare (saved chopping onions/tears!).
I made the sauce the night before - made it exactly to the recipe, no adjustments or substitutions.
At 7am the morning of the event, I put the frozen meatballs in my crockpot, added the sauce and put it on low.  By 2pm (the start of the party) it was bubbling and smelling amazing.  They were an instant hit!  Will be making these again for sure!

I made this with two pounds of store bought meatballs.  Used a whole can of whole berry cranberry sauce, a whole bottle of chili sauce and eliminated the brown sugar.  The cranberry sauce is sweet enough.  Used the juice of 1/2 lemon.  Squeezed it into the chili sauce bottle to get the last of the sauce out of the bottom.  Give it a good shake and add to the sauce pan.  This was a big hit.  Doing it again for our Christmas gathering.

Made this as written to take to a party last night.  They were a HIT!  I used Panko bread crumbs rather than regular. SO EASY.  Took them in an electric Japanese Hot Pot for easy access.  Had several requests for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I have a similar recipe except I add a quart of well drained and rinsed sauerkraut. I also use a can of whole berry cranberry sauce instead of the jellied.  It is always a hit and you can freeze any leftovers.

I love this recipe!  I have used it many, many times over the years and the meatballs literally disappear before your very eyes.  I've used cranberry sauce in the recipe and I've used grape jelly in the recipe but cranberry sauce really is the way to go.  You can add spices according to your personal taste but this recipe is awesome just the way it is!

Loved this recipe! Actually made a mistake, I used the Srichari chili garlic sauce that I had in the pantry and I halved it since I knew it was spicy. Obviously, the cocktail meatballs were very spicy and once I saw Heinz chili sauce at the grocery store I knew that it was the Heinz that was supposed to be in there. Makes more sense, so that was my bad. But awesome recipe!!

I make the meatballs ahead of time & freeze.  I simply then have to make the sauce.  I throw in the crookpot & I'm done.  I usually make 4 batches at a time & they don't last a day!

I have tried these cocktail meatballs and they are delicious.  I make them with a jar of grape jelly and a jar of chile sauce. Both equally tangy and good!!

I made these for New Years and they turned out really good!  I used a thai chili sauce to give it an extra kick.  I made fresh meatballs as I don't like frozen.  I cooked these in the slow cooker and they were a bit hit!

These were good (and lacking something) but my company thought they were great and couldn't stop eating them.  So I am giving it a 5 star based on following the recipe to the T and how well received they were.  Thank you.

This recipe was good thank-you.  There are many recipes for cocktail meatballs and the sauces that go with them.  Don't say you love this recipe if you change it - that makes it a different recipe - especially the person who changes almost all the ingredients!

This was really good!  I only gave it 4 stars because I used the frozen meatballs as others suggested and I would recommend making your own...they lacked flavor.  The sauce was really good...just wanted more flavor in the meat itself.  So next time, I will make my own meatballs....and add seasoning to those.

These are excellent.  Made them for Christmas buffet and they were gone in no time (I doubled the recipe).  I like this sauce more than the one that uses grape jelly.

The meatball mixture is fantastic.  I used the suggested cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs and onion soup mix instead of an onion, and I added the parsley.  Wow, perfect consistency, they were great all by themselves.  I think I found a new great all around meatball recipe and the sauce was great.  One note, make sure you realize that cranberry sauce comes in 14 oz cans, not 8 oz cans, so go by the total number of ounces needed, not by the number of cans needed...

These were very good.  I had ground beef in freezer bags in the freezer, so I don't know exactly how much I used, but I'm guessing 2+ pounds.  Then, I used 1 bottle of Heinz Chili Sauce and (1) 14 oz can of cranberry sauce.  I didn't measure the other ingredients (just eye-balled it), but I could definitely still taste the tartness of the cranberries, more in the aftertaste than the actual bite.  I like cranberries, but my husband doesn't (and neither do a lot of our guests).  Since everyone likes sweet party meatballs, I tried adding just a little more brown sugar, and it took the tartness away.  The other thing that I changed was the cooking time.  After cooking in the crockpot on high for 1 hour, the onions in the meatballs still had a slight crunch.  I added another 1-1/2 hours to the crockpot, and they came out moist and delicious.  There weren't many leftovers, but my husband and I made little sandwiches with Hawaiian bread, and it was great!

Delicious and very easy to make. I usually use store bought meatballs and I always have a problem with the texture. These are perfect and they don't have that overprocessed mush texture to them. This is my new meatball recipe!

I used frozen meatballs as I have a 6 month old and time is precious. Followed the sauce recipe exactly. It was a little too sweet for my taste so I added 2 cap-fulls of vinegar and about 6 shakes of worcestershire sauce. Did the frozen meatballs as directed on pkg-put frozen meatballs in crock pot, cover with sauce and heat on high 2 hrs/low 4 hrs. Everyone at work loved them. The leftovers were great meatball sandwiches! A good change from ordinary meatballs.

Red currant jam works extremely well as a substitute for the cranberry sauce.  You can also cut down on the chili sauce if you don't have enough from 1 bottle.  I omitted the brown sugar to cut down on the sweetness, and it worked out fine.  This recipe makes way more than enough sauce; there's no need to have the meatballs swimming in sauce.  (That way you're less likely to have sauce dripped on the carpet by careless guests.)

Wow, I could eat about 100 of these. I use meatloaf mix (ground beef, veal, pork) instead of ground beef for a little extra flavor. Delish!!

These were great, I used chicken meatballs that I bought from Costco and turned out amazing. Even the kids enjoyed them.

Pretty good, but typical cocktail meatball recipe.
I'll keep it for last minute recipe requests, but will look for another one to really impress party guests =)

Excellent.  Made them for a party and everyone loved them. My 4 year old daughter, whose current diet consists of chicken nuggets and mac & cheese, loved these; when she asked for seconds I knew they would be a hit.  I agree with a previous person who said to cook them on high in the crockpot for 2 hours prior to serving. I warmed the sauce up in a pot and tasted it and it was pretty bad.  Then I transferred it to the crockpot and cooked it on high for 2 hours - amazing!  I used frozen italian flavored meatballs, put them in the oven for about 15-20 min prior to the crockpot.  This is definitely a keeper.

This is very similar to a recipe my mother in law gave me, in her's the meatballs were made with cornflakes, ketchup, parsley and few other things. This is easier and just as delicious. I always eat for dinner with a cheesy hash brown casserole (like hash brown casserole II on this site) and veggies. The leftovers heat quite well and are delicious!

Not too bad.  Next time, I am going to cook the meatballs in a frypan and let them crisp up a bit.  I think this would have made a huge difference.

My go-to cocktail meatball recipe, because I appreciate homemade meatballs rather than frozen, and I prefer baking them first to cooking raw meatballs in sauce as I sometimes see suggested.  Some very basic additional seasoning - salt, pepper, garlic, soy sauce, parsley perhaps, etc. - would take it to 5 stars; the meatballs as written are sometimes a bit bland, however the delicious sauce makes up for that, and the lack of embellishment to the meat mixture means the children enjoy them, too, and sure keeps preparation simple!  Can be made ahead -always a plus to a hostess.  I've served this recipe on New Year's Eve for several years, and now get requests for Superbowl, Oscar night  and various winter gatherings.  I bet you will, too!

Great recipe. I love the fact that you bake them instead of putting them in a frying pan. Made some as the recipe called for and some with Italian seasonings added. I'll use those for spaghetti! Thanks for a great recipe.

Not having chili sauce, we used a substitute of ketchup and spices (not a good idea).  In the end, we added half of a bottle of barbecue sauce because it just tasted like cranberries and ketchup.  It turned out quite well with French bread with the barbecue sauce!

Tasty, easy recipe! Instead of chili I used BBQ sauce to please my picky husband. Came out very tasty and much better quality than the pre-frozen ones.

I just made these for our New Years Eve party and they are so delicious!  I am hoping to maintain enough self control to save them for the party.  I cooked them in a saucepan, and am going to throw them in the oven tomorrow before serving.. I did use frozen meatballs as I have several other projects brewing, and they still turned out amazing. I wasn't sure what "chili sauce" was..?  I bought a can of Pistol Pete's Chili Sauce and it looks like chili that you pour over hot dogs.. I'd like to know what others used..?

Pretty easy- Some people at the party LOVED them, my husband didn't love the flavor and I thought they were good but quite spicy (and I love spicy things!)  I imagine that has a lot to do with what chili sauce you use.   -Definitely a lot of flavor, but many of my meatballs crumbled.   -You gotta get your hands dirty!!!  -They weren't bad, but I might look for a different recipe next time.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I, and it was very sweet.  It was also very tart from the cranberry so it was a little difficult to enjoy with the tangy kick taking over the whole meatball.  I guess you'll enjoy it if you like very sweet meat.  Too sweet and tangy for my liking.  Probably won't make again.

I liked  this recipe, however, I figured something was off when I put in 3/4c of Sriracha chili sauce.. The meatballs were extremely spicy, but they were still eaten.. Just very slowly! I think I used the wrong kind of sauce. Will edit my rating when I make this with a different type of chili sauce!

Really good. Just a little too sweet for our taste. We used meatball nirvana from AR and had used grape jelly instead, added more lemon than it called for and dashes of Tabasco. Thought it was a great balance.

I thought these were good, but just not as good as some other meatball recipes on this website. One thing to clarify which I almost made a mistake on was the type of chili sauce to use in this, I almost used thai chili sauce when what you are supposed to use is a tomato based chili sauce. Thank goodness I went back and read a bunch of reviews. I made my own chili sauce off of this website.

We had a chili cook off at work.  I didn't feel like making chili so I brought these meatballs instead.  I was disqualified but still got the most votes.  That being said, I and everyone else loved these, but I was a little disappointed in this recipe because I expected it to be further away from the standard ketchup/grape jelly recipe. Next time I'll add a little horseradish.

Delish!  Used about 32 oz of frozen Italian meatballs and 1 pkg of Lil Smokies and doubled the sauce........definitely bake the meatballs for about 25 mins before adding them to the sauce.  And the longer they cooked the better they got - so if possible, I would recommend cooking in a slow cooker on high for 2-3 hours before serving.

The meatballs tasted really good on thier own, but I thought the sauce tasted too much like ketchup.  Thankfully, I haven't added the meatballs to the sauce yet, and I'm going to search for another sauce on the website.

So, about the chili sauce in this recipe. I think it should be chile sauce (like Heinz) not Asian sweet chili sauce or sriracha. Just my guess, but if you use the Asian sauce, it is going to be gaggingly sweet and if you use the sriracha, I think it will be really hot, maybe too hot for a lot of people. Just my 2 cents worth.

Excellent recipe! I wasn't sure what to make for a party until I found this. I made it exactly as written. It was a hit at a huge potluck- was one of the first dishes eaten up!

Yummy as usual. These are always made during the holidays and one of my favorites! I would put less chili sauce next time, they were a bit on the spicy side, especially for my toddler, but never the less, addicting for me!

Meatballs were great, the sauce was just ok/good.  I will definitely make the meatballs again, but will probably use just a bbq sauce.

I decided to try these meatballs using Johnsonville mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef.  The sausage definitely kicked up the flavor in these meatballs.   Cooking them first rendered out a lot of the fat and then I drained very well on paper towels before adding into the crock pot with the sauce.   The meatballs had a wonderful texture and were a nice complement to the sauce.

Used the entire 12 oz bottle of chili sauce (which was difficult to find in stock during the holiday season), 3 bags of 16 count Armour Premium Beef Meatballs, 9-10 oz of cranberry jelly, 2 TBSP lemon juice, 1TBSP brown sugar, 1 TBSP worcestershire.  Cooked well in the crock pot with occasional sturring.  Started it at 3PM to serve at 7PM.  Super easy to cook and serve.  Guests left asking for the recipe.

It doesn't say what kind of chili sauce to use???. I used Tabasco. These didn't come out as good as I thought. It was a bit hot for some but most liked it. I personally thought it was a little too hot.

I was skeptical of the cranberry sauce, but this is very good. I think I even like it better than the old standby of grape jelly and chili sauce. I buy a bag of frozen meatballs from Costco, as I'm too lazy to make them from scratch. They are very good, everyone loves them!

I also used frozen meatballs--Homestyle not Italian.  2 lb bag so I doubled the sauce which was easy with 1 16 oz can of jellied Cran, 1 12 oz bottle of Chili Sauce (more like ketchup -not the super hot sauce).  I also added about 1 tblsp Worcestershire.  After tasting it seemed a bit sweet so I added some heat with about 1/2 tsp Siracha Chili Sauce---still wasn't right so I added about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle sauce....YUMMY!  I am heating the meatballs in the sauce in the crockpot and then chilling until tomorrow for the party to really let the sauce soak into the meatballs.  Hubby can't wait!

I know the reveiws on these are highly rated, however I don't understand what the fuss is about. I have several other meatball crockpot recipes that top this. I was hoping for a more distinctive taste, but this was a little mediocre.

I made this recipe as is for a potluck at work. Most of the time the stuff I bring (recipes from this site) is a huge hit, but since I hadnt made this before, I didnt tell anyone that I broguht the cocktail meatballs. But when I looked around the room, and nobody had them on their plates, because they had eaten them all, I fessed up! Anyway, super easy recipe to make (prepared them the night before and refrigerated until the morning, turned on the crock pot, and finished just in time for lunch!) and even easier to eat! I had never used chili sauce before, but I picked up a few bottles, and have made dozens of the meatballs and froze them so I can whip up this recipe at a moment's notice!! I also used a small cookie scoop to ensure all the meatballs are the same size, and baked the meatballs as directed, but I used a 13x9 pan with an elevated rack to help them cook evenly. PERFECT!!

Made this recipe for New Year's Eve and it was a hit!  I used frozen meatballs to cut down on prep time, I also omitted the lemon juice because I didn't have any on hand.  Mixed cranberry sauce, brown sugar and a full bottle of chili sauce together, mixed in the frozen meatballs, then dumped the mixture into the crockpot, which I left in the fridge overnight until I put it on low to cook the next day.  Turned out yummy!

I made these for our New Year's Eve party and everyone liked them. I used pre-cooked frozen meatballs. I don't eat meat so didn't try them myself, but the sauce was good! The cranberry sauce is a nice, tangy change from the grape jelly that you usually see in this type of recipe.

Just made these today for New years! And Ive had to stop myself from eating all of them b4 guest get here! lol Ive made these last year It was pretty much the same except it asked for grape jelly. I dont think it matters which one you use. I just think the cranberry sauce is a tad sweeter.(did not add any sugar)Used frozen meatballs. And I also put them in the slow cooker for about 3 hours on low. Than its good all night on warm. I plan on making them every for every New years from now on so thank you for this recipe.

Please note that I am only rating the sauce.  I used frozen meatballs.  This sauce was really good.  I think the addition of the lemon juice and brown sugar gave the sauce a depth that it needed to make these super good.  I will use this recipe from now on!

These meatballs was a great hit and very easy! I used pre-cooked frozen meatballs to save time and cooked them in the crockpot. After our party everyone was asking for the recipe!

I cheat and use frozen meatballs that I bake in the oven before putting in the crockpot. I leave out the brown sugar, but add a few dashes of Siracha sauce to give it a little bit of a bite and then let the meatballs sit in the crockpot with the sauce for awhile before serving. Every time I've made them, people have said that they're the best meatballs they've ever had. And, so easy!! THANKS for the recipe!!

Very easy and pretty good.  I didn't give 5 stars because I think the recipe didn't make enough sauce, I had to double it.

I have made this a few times so I have some tips.  1) Definitely cook them in the oven first.  This helps them keep the shape so you can actually stir them in the crock pot.  2) Definitely do not use the amount of chili sauce this recipe says to use.  I used the Sriacchi chili sauce (the bottle w/ the rooster) and only did about 1/4 total and I doubled the recipe.  I also like it spicey.  I took others' advice and added ketchup and worchestchire in place of water.  I also added a couple tablespoons of bbq sauce because I had some in the fridge.  I have made this with and without brown sugar and couldn't really tell the difference.  This time I didn't have any brown sugar so I added a squirt of maple syrup although it probably didn't even need it.  This is a great recipe for potlucks and I got great compliments both times I've made it.  Just watch the chili sauce or some peple won't be able to handle it!

Excellent Sauce. I use this for lil smokies or polskas as well. Big hit when I bring them to work for the goodie table.  No leftovers. The chili sauce called for is in a bottle like Heiz Chili Sauce. Don't know what the other reviewers used for it to be so hot and spicy. I use a regular size can of jellied cranberry sauce, 1 bottle of chili sauce, small onion chopped and 2 TBSP of brown sugar.  You can substitute 1 TBSP of vinegar in place of lemon juice.  Great for the crockpot.

Was way to spicy for my husband but had a nice zing for this chilli head. Very much depends on the type of chili sauce used. Used my own recipe for the meatballs, grilled them then crockpotted them in the sauce till ready to serve. I doubled the lemon juice and also added lime juice to try and temper the heat. Would suggest replacing chilli sauce with ketchup or bbq sauce for a milder version. Cranberry sauce works great.

I used frozen meatballs, but cooked them first in oven.  I also placed a bag of smokies in the Crockpot with the meatballs.  This was a hit with everyone.

They were good but after reading all the fantastic reviews I was expecting well, fantastic.  There was no "wow" factor in these and they tasted pretty similar to my plain old sweet and sour recipe.  They didn't fly off the plate at our recent Christmas party and I wouldn't go out of my way to make them again over something else.

The sauce is great!I am only reviewing the sauce because I was lazy and used frozen meatballs! 
My husband ONLY likes marinara sauce(so he says) but I really wanted something different for a wine tasting/cocktail party I was throwing. I tried this recipe with only one mild alterations. I added some minced garlic because we love garlic and we felt it just needed "something". I poured the sauce on the frozen meatballs in my crockpot about 4 hrs before my party.
Not one was left. My husband says they are his new favorite cocktail meatball!He couldn't believe there was cranbery sauce in them!

I will not attach any stars just yet.  But these definitely were not a hit.  I'm not Emeril, but I'm not a beginner either.  The meatballs themselves came out fine.  The sauce did not.  I don't know if I did anything wrong.  The jellied cranberry sauce was still kinda jellied, even after heating in a saucepan for a while.  I doubled the recipe, yielding about 50.  I ate about 15-20 myself, and came home with at least 10 leftover, and a party of about 10-12 people.  What did I do wrong?  I substituted nothing and read the recipe to a T.  Thanks for any insights out there.

These are excellent and soooo easy.  I used store bought meatballs (do not use Italian-style as flavors will clash with sauce) and prepared in a slow cooker.  Perfect party fare.  You might want to try serving these with small french rolls sliced in half so folks can make sandwiches.  Receives rave reviews and nobody believes it when I tell them the ingredients.

Not sure what happened. The cranberry sauce never got completely creamy, it was lumpy. Something wasn't right. The after taste was bad. I rinsed these off and used another recipe on this site. Everyone has different tastes, Thanks though

This was a big hit!! I used whole berry cranberry sauce and added a little bit of honey to the sauce in the crockpot--turned out wonderfully. I also cook my meatballs on a broiler pan in the oven so the fat will drain off into the bottom pan--makes the sauce not so greasy!

I made these meatballs for Christmas, and it was the first time I've ever made cocktail meatballs. It was quite simple to prepare and the fact that they were in a slow cooker freed up my oven and stovetop which was nice.  They were great tasting, and my guests complimented them many times!  I will save this recipe for future get-togethers.

I used a big bag of frozen meatballs which I know was a lot more than you would get from the 1 lb. of beef called for in this recipe.  I used a 16 oz. can of cranberry sauce but reduced the amount of chili sauce to 1/4 cup and added about 1 tsp. of dry mustard.  Kept everything else the same.  Just fantastic.  Everyone loved them.

Outstanding results and they disappeared quickly! The only modification I'd like to recommend is I used Treehouse Berry Farm's Cranberry-Jalapeno Jam and it worked wonderfully!  I agree this is a great alternative to the sweet grape jelly version....

I made this over the weekend for a dinner party and as noted in other reviews, they were eaten up! A few things I did with the meatballs: I did double the recipe and used 2 lbs of lean ground beef and added one packet of lipton onion soup mix, a few generaous shots of Worcestershire sauce and used italian seasoned bread crumbs. For the sauce I used the entire can of both the cranberry and chili sauce and added a few dashes of franks hot sauce (the flavor is less intense than Tabasco). But the sauce looked like it wouldn't even be close to enough. So, I threw in half a bottle of "spicy habanero barbeque sauce". In my area, our local grocery store produces its own line of gourmet condiments and this is from that line of products. It added the perfect amount of smokiness and spiciness. If you can find something similar I highly recommend it. I cooked the meatballs as the recipe indicates and then put everything into the crockpot on low for nearly 3 hours. Perfect amount of time and probably could have gone on longer for more flavor infusion. My husband loved them and ate the few leftover as a midnight snack, cold! Good luck!

This was a huge hit when I made it for a housewarming.  It may have been because I used a Thai chili sauce, but the meatballs were VERY spicy, too spicy really.  My friends and I normally like spicy food, but I definitely should have cut back on the chili sauce next time.

Confession: I used only the sauce recipe and used frozen meatballs, yet these were some of the tastiest cocktail meatballs I've ever eaten/made! They were a hit at our holiday party as well as on New Years! Make these and you're sure to be sending home happy guests with the recipe!

This recipe is MONEY!  I added one habanero and one serrano (finely diced) to the meat and 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper to the sauce.  I have made these 3 times and they have been devoured every time.

Great meatball recipe for a party, even the kids loved these.  I will probably make them again soon just for them.  Please be cautioned when reading one star reviews for this.  Some people can't say nice things about anything and if you go on to read the other reviews they have written you will see that. This really is a great little recipe.

These meatballs were delicious. The sauce, in my opinion, was a bit mild...not much kick to it. Next time, I will probably make a few changes: 1)season the ground beef with garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper 2)Use homemade chili sauce instead of canned 3)Use fresh diced onion instead of minced 4)Mix a bit of hickory barbeque sauce into the sauce for the recipe for added kick. However, these meatballs were awesome if you prefer something a little mild. They were moist and the flavor, though mild, was unique and delicious. Thanks for such a great recipe!

CARIZMAGIRL... I think this recipe wants you to use Heinz Chili Sauce.  It doesn't say that specifically in this recipe but I have made similar recipes and that is what they called for.

I was serving a large crowd and found this recipe to very simple, especially since I used frozen Italian meatballs and threw everything in my slow cooker on low for 4 hours.  The ease of preparation was great for a large party.

Nummy!!!  Even with frozen meatballs, which is what I used.  I bet with the homemade meatballs they're even better...
The sweetness of the cranberry sauce and brown sugar are soooooo good with the other salty ingredients.  I used homemade whole cranberry sauce (on the back of the Ocean Spray cranberry package) and the flavor was great.  Don't let them cook too long, though...the sauce dries up and they're ruined.  Duh...

This is a great recipe.  I actually just used the sauce with frozen meatballs.  I cooked them in the slow cooker for 5 hours with tabasco chili sauce.  They turned out great!

Super easy and incredibly tasty! In the time that it takes to preheat your oven, you can easily make and roll out the meatballs.  This is just such a great recipe that I can't wait to share it at our next party.

They are cocktail meatballs, not for a main meal the sauce is to sweet but great to poke a toothpick into and have one or two the sauce does wonders for the ground beef.

THIS IS GREAT RECIPE. I MADE THE MEATBALLS AS DIRECTED IN THE RECIPE. THEN RELIZED IT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH FOR THE CROWD I WAS HAVING SO I RAN TO THE STORE AND BOUGHT PREMADE, NEXT TIME I'LL JUST BUY THE ONES FROM THE STORE THEY WERE JUST AS GOOD.THE SAUCE WAS A LITTLE SPICY FOR ME AND I DIDN'T EVEN PUT IN THE FULL 3/4 CUP OF CHILI SAUCE. NEXT TIME I'LL ONLY USE 1/4 CUP AND TRY THAT. BUT EVERYONE LOVED THEM.

I love this recipe. It's the first one that I tried for meatballs and I can confidently say that it will likely be my last! 

I usually make at lest double the recipe and we're lucky to get leftovers. I'd highly reccomend this recipe.

I only added 1/2 cup chili sauce to the cranberry jelly. I made my meatballs the way I always do and just made this sauce recipe.  I would make it again, we all liked it.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe because i was bringing it to an Italian person's christmas party, but it was a hit!  It tasted better served warm over being hot.  It brought out the flavor in the sauce.  I did use onion soup, a little garlic powder and a splash of soy sauce for the meatballs.  Let it simmer for quite a while because at first the sauce tastes kind of strange until the flavors have a chance to really simmer together.

This was not a big hit for me. Out of seven adults and six children, only one adult liked them. After reading the reviews I really thought this would be a real winner. I followed the recipe perfectly and I still thought it was not tasty at all. It was fun making it though! I'll stick to my grape jelly and chili sauce with kielbasa recipe.

The many great reviews for this recipe say it all.  I took them to a christmas party and got raves - not to mention several requests for the recipe.  I added a Tbsp of worchestershire to the sauce with success.

I cheated and prepared with store bought meatballs cuz I was having people over one evening and worked all that day.  Came home from work, threw it all in the crock pot, freshened up and then pulled more appetizers I had prepared earlier out of the fridge.  They disappeared quick!

While I'm not a big meatball fan, I'm a fan of anything that makes me more popular at parties. I took this to a football party last night and they were devoured. They disappeared! The cocktail weenies in the crockpot right next to mine didn't do as well with these as competition.

Next time I make them, I'll try adding a few red pepper flakes for more bite. But they're great as-is. (And making the meatballs myself was much better than guessing which frozen ones would taste best. Totally worth it!)

I made these for my parents anniversary party and they flew out of the crockpot.  I made the meatballs a few days before and baked them off.  I then froze them and let them simmer in the sauce in the crockpot for a few hours.

Absolutely love this recipe!! These meatballs are a huge hit every time I make them, dinner, snack, potlucks, everything! I have tried both frozen meatballs and handmade and definitely prefer handmade, it does not taste the same! We also started cooking our meatballs in the air fryer instead of the oven, they come out perfect every time. 12 minutes at 360°, shake them a couple times while cooking and voila! We have also browned them in a skillet but the air fryer is the win and makes for easy cleanup. You will not go wrong with this recipe!!

Made it twice and it's been a winner with my book club. The second time I used grape jelly instead of the cranberry sauce and it is equally tasty. The only other change I made was exchange 1 TB of water to Worcestershire sauce as it gives a bit of a kick to the meatballs.

Had to make something quick and had frozen meatballs. Had some “sweet” chili sauce from Trader Joe’s, so omitted the brown sugar. Worked out great and rave reviews. Warmed it in the crock pot, the sauce was enough for 2-20 oz bags of Trader Joe’s party size mini meatballs.

I used instant potatoes instead of bread crumbs because my daughter is gluten free.  They turned out very good!

Great recipe!
I know some people can be disappointed that reviews are sent out changing a recipe.....but to me it's helpful to read what works for others.  So with that said...... per reading reviews this is what I did:  I DOUBLED RECIPE.  1-1/2 c bread crumbs (not Italian), 3/4 pkg Llipton onion soup mix, 1 whole can jellied cranberries, 3 T worcestershire, 3 T ketchup, add extra egg making it 3 eggs, more brown sugar to taste.
Baked meatballs, made sauce. Refrig next day, heat in crockpot.  (remember I doubled recipe) Loved the sweet/tangy flavor .  It was a hit!

We made this for NYE as we had the grand kids and needed kid friendly snacks. The only alteration in the recipe was a teaspoon of salt and garlic powder added to the meatballs. The rest of the recipe as written.  Kids loved them, my husband and I thought the meatball was delish but we prefer the grape jelly/chile sauce recipe. Saw so many negative reviews crabbing the sauce was inedible because it was too spicy. I think you guys used the wrong chile sauce. Look for Heinz brand. You do not want the chinese pastes or Siracha. That would be incredibly hot. Very good recipe. Came together in no time and the children, 4,5 and 6 all ate them.

These are great. Just made them. I was making the bacon wrapped cocktail wieners at the same time. I had opened two package of wieners which was too much. Hubby comes home and says to throw the extra package in with the meatballs. I did and it made a great little combo.  Sometimes it's nice when someone just breezes through with an idea.

I made this for a potluck Christmas get together and they were a hit! I had nothing left to bring home. Everyone bragged about them. I did double the recipe because I had doubled the ground beef and of course, made them from scratch.I also cooked them in a slow cooker for about 6 hours. Will make them again for sure!

Here's a tip, adjust the servings to 18 if you want to use the entire 14 oz. can of cranberry and it will re-calculate all of the ingredients to match that amount.

Great recipe. I had to make a lot of meatballs so I opted for baking some frozen meatballs and making only the sauce. Took a while to dissolve all the cranberry jelly in the crockpot. Would probably heat sauce in a pan or microbe in the future to avoid the long wait.

The sauce is always a hit at the annual potluck at work!  Only I cheat and use frozen meatballs instead of making my own.

I loved these!  These were a nice change away from the grape jelly kind.  I loved the zip and tangy zing these had with the chili sauce and they were not overly sweet.  They were perfect.  The only thing I did differently was add in a dash of onion and garlic powder and just used frozen meatballs instead of making them from scratch.  I know they would be even tastier with homemade meatballs.  I was in a pinch, so I just heated them over low on the stove top for about an hour and the sauce got nice and thick and bubbly.  So good!  I am changing over to this recipe from now on.  Thank you for the recipe!

Tasted so amazing!!  I modified the recipe to utilize veal, port and beef in equal parts and I added a bit more lemon juice for more tang.  Super tasty and the balls held together, even after sitting in the crock for the better part of a day.

Actually a 6 star recipe. It takes a bit longer than the recipe indicates. Make the sauce first, dump all the meatball ingredients in 1 bowl. Then set everything up, frying pan, butter/oil in pan, paper towels on side of stove, pan ready to put them in, utensils. Then with 2 rubber gloves on mix the meat mixture. If it seems a bit soft, add a little more bread crumbs. Make all the meatballs and put on cookies sheet, then remove only 1 glove. The gloved hand can put the meatbals in the pan to fry. I now always make at least 2 recipes worth, believe me they will be gone. As I take them out of frying pan, put on paper towels to drain, then into baking dish. I use a 9X12 ceramic pan. You can do these the day before and bake prior to needing. Can be kept warm in a crock pot too. If any are left, they make a great meat dish for dinner the next day. Have made this recipe many times, everyone loves them & asks me to bring them.

These were the most soft, tender meatballs I've ever had.  It was really easy to make and we'll definitely make them again. I would recommend this method of doing oven then stove for all meatballs after how soft and juicy they were.

Oh my gosh, this was soooo good! I've made it twice now; once with beef and again with chicken. Both times they turned out great....and I do make the meat balls from scratch (if you have time). Everyone loved them and had seconds and thirds and fourths. So tasty.

No modifications needed! This recipe is perfect as is. I've made this for multiple gatherings and the meatballs are always well received.

Great tasting appetizer that everyone loved!  I'm glad I doubled the recipe, they were getting eaten faster than I could put them out :)  I did use frozen meatballs because I didn't have time to make them fresh and there wasn't a noticeable taste difference at all.

The meatballs themselves are fine, definitely very plain without sauce.  We found the sauce VERY sweet and this is coming from a family that loves sweet.  I had to doctor the sauce quite a bit.  Will try something different next time.

The recipe calls for chili sauce - it doesn't specify the brand. In my opinion, recipes are meant to be clear so anyone can replicate. I made the same mistake of using Thai sweet chili sauce and it was hot! I liked the meatballs, but they didn't disappear like they would have with a milder sauce. I thought the recipe was still good enough to try again with the Heinz chili sauce this time!

Made this NYE and it was a hit! Everyone ate them up. Made with frozen meatballs as time saver.  I agree- use regular meatballs , not Italian. The longer they sit the better, and it only takes minutes to make. I have made other recipes and this is my go to now.

Very comparable to those made with grape jelly.  They were OK. I was hoping for a "to die for" recipe.

This recipe is a keeper. I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the meatball mixture.  I also used a cranberry chutney I'd made instead of the cranberry sauce it calls for.  They were a hit, and I'll make them again. Thank you!

I made these for a holiday get together, and several people asked for the recipe. The sauce isn't as sweet as a typical barbecue sauce, which makes them an appealing alternative to the standard Li'l Smokies for a potluck.

In my situation I needed a recipe to make with cocktail weenies.  This one sounded good.  I had all the ingredients, except I used fresh whole cranberry sauce, not jelly.  It worked perfectly.  A very tasty pucker to it from the combination of cranberries/chili sauce.  I will use this again.

My personal review of these meatballs would be a 3 but, I did get great feedback on them when I served them as an app for Christmas eve. Personally I much prefer the grape jelly/bbq sauce/ chili pepper combination - this is a bit too "tomatoey" for my liking. I used frozen angus meatballs, cooked everything the day before and warmed it up in the crockpot the day of for 3 hours. I used 64 meatballs and doubled the sauce - it was more than enough.

I was looking for something new to take to a party that we were going to. I made my own meatballs and followed the exact recipe. I also made this the day before so the flavored had a chance mingle. Needless to say, I was terribly disappointed .The mix of flavors were awful. I have used other recipes  from Allrecipes and have loved  every single one , so was surprised that these were not a hit with my family.

Made these in a double batch, following the listed recipe. Only change I made made was I used onion soup mix in the meatballs instead of onions (wasn't sure if there were any opinion haters at the function I was attending), and I added a drizzle of honey to everything during the last 10 minutes of cooking. These were amazingly good. Will definitely make again and again!!

I made these recently for my sister in law's baby shower and for a potluck.  They went over great both times.  I had a few meatballs left over so I added a little sirracha and made meatball sandwiches.

I made this several times for parties and it was a hit.   I've added orange marmalade to the sauce for an orange/cranberry flavor.  I have also used ground lamb and ground chicken in addition to beef then sectioned the different meatballs off in the crock pot.

I didn't have bread or cracker crumbs or even cornflake crumbs so I substituted finely ground oatmeal that I ground in my food processor.  The meatballs turned out nice and moist and the sauce is to die for!  Great hit at the church supper!

As previous reviewers recommended, I used one packet of Lipton Onion soup in place of the minced onions. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I made almost 40 meatballs with one pound of meat and cooked them on a broiler pan, which worked great. The meatballs by themselves were simply amazing! I could have eaten all 40 by myself! I made four pounds of meatballs for a get-together. After the meatballs cooled, I froze them for about a week and put them in the fridge the night before our party. In the morning, I made the sauce and let it warm up in the crock pot, then added the meatballs and let them simmer all day. The amount of sauce was perfect for the number of meatballs, but I thought it was too sweet (my husband agreed). All but about 5 or 6 meatballs were eaten and people seemed to like them, but, in the future, I will make this without the brown sugar.

These were just ok. I gave it 4 stars for the sauce, nice and tangy! The meatballs are bland, so I think next time I'll use my meatballs with the sauce.

I used Thai sweet chili sauce in place of the regular chili sauce and omitted the brown sugar and these were amazing! I doubled the recipe and used i package of onion soup instead of the minced onion.  These were the BEST cocktail meatballs ever!

My family absolutely loved this recipe; even my younger brother who is extremely picky could not stop eating these! I browned the meatballs in the oven for the recommended time and then finished cooking them in the sauce in my dutch oven on the stove. These meatballs get cold quickly, so if you are serving these for a party it would be helpful to keep them warm in the sauce until just before serving. I was able to make about 20 small meatballs with this recipe, and had no leftovers!

Yum yum yum!  I made this recipe exactly as stated, except I used lean turkey and panko bread crumbs.  All of my guests loved them. I wasn't sure how the "sauce" would taste (I thought it might be too sweet), but I was very surprised how well the flavors came together.  I cooked the meatballs and made the sauce the night before and just popped them into my crock pot about an our before dinner.  Will definitely keep this recipe!

Great recipe just as is, and lends itself to lots of variations (see other reviews).  I used a combination of ground pork and ground turkey, and instead of chili sauce, I subbed El Pato hot tomato sauce (available in Latino markets, and also online).  They are INHALED by everyone present when I put them out, and better and better each day you keep them.  Two thumbs up.

These were great! I followed the recipe as stated, except I made my own chili sauce rather than using a jar. I used "Chili Sauce" from this website. I made the meatballs and sauce ahead of time, put them in the fridge, then threw everything in the Crockpot for 2 hours on low. I think they would be very good with ground too.

These are great!! I used a 2 lb bag bag of frozen turkey meatballs. I doubled the sauce and made it the day ahead, i also put the bag of frozen meatballs in the fridge to thaw over night. About 2 hours before the event I threw the meatballs and sauce in the crockpot on high for 2 hours. They were devoured!!

Made this for a wedding reception for 70 people.  These were gone so very quickly!  I did use another's suggestion and substituted lipton onion soup mix for the onion.  Friends told me these were the best they have ever had.  May cut down on the sauce next time.

These were just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly using store bought meatballs (not Italian).  They weren't that flavorful and nothing to write home about.  These were not really sweet and didn't have any kick or spice either.

Fantastic! These were a hit with the whole family. I made them with onion soup mix as someone suggested instead of the minced onion. The sauce is great, even the pickiest eater in the family really liked these.

I make these all the time .... using the Costco frozen meatballs.   Instead of cranberry sauce, I use a jar of cheap grape jelly along with one bottle of chili sauce.  I don't add anything else.   I have also made these as dinner, serving with mashed potatoes and some grilled veggies.    The sauce is SOOO yummy.  I've never met anyone that didn't like them.

Finally found some time to write my review for this :) My family loved, loved, loved, them. I did not have time to make the meat balls fresh, I used Costco Italian meat balls. The sauce was fabulous! I made it on the stove as alot of users suggested. I added sauce to the slow cooker with the meat balls & simmered 2 hours. Amazing!! I tripled the recipe & had some left over for lunch the next day :) I will make again & plan to make the meat balls fresh. Thank for sharing!!

I used frozen meatballs (turkey), whole cranberry sauce and chili sauce simmered in my crockpot. These are the best meatballs and are always a hit with my family.

Super delish. I have used this recipe over and over. I opt for the frozen plain meatballs, thawed. Much easier. Many people who haved asked what the ingredients are beforehand cringe, but the flavor can't be beat! And they all agree after trying it!

These meatballs were great. I used a different sauce (BBQ sauce from Williams Sonoma), but the meatballs themselves were fantastic. Mine were quite small so they were done in 15 minutes. I also only simmered the meatballs in BBQ sauce for about 20 minutes and they were still very flavorful.

This is a terrific recipe.  As others have said, it is a nice change from the grape jelly cocktail meatballs.  

One note, make sure you pick up the jellied cranberry sauce, instead of the ones with the cranberries in tack.  It is definitely more tangy if don't get the jellied cranberry sauce.  I didn't catch this mistake, until the second time I had made it; definitely a better balance between the sweetness and the tangyness of the sauce

I followed someone's advice to include onion soup mix, and I wish I hadn't.  It was too salty and too oniony.  Even so, these were good, and I give them a 5 based on the original recipe.  The sauce was great.

Made these for a New Years get together at my sisters and they where a hit. My hushand loved them so much that he has been asking for them every since. I did add a spash of worcestersire sauce to the mix.  I whisked the sauce ingredients together, put it in the slowcooker with meatballs for one and a half hours.....wonderful. May try frozen meatballs in the future if no one is looking. Thank you for the great and easy recipe. C.

These were YUMMY!  I actually made them with ground turkey instead and followed reviewers advice and used ketchup instead of water.  I also used 1/2 part italian seasoned bread crumbs and 1/2 part corn flakes.  They were a total hit.  Even my 6 yr old, who doesn't eat meatballs EVER, loved them!!!!

I "made" these with 3 pounds of Costco Italian meatballs.  I used a whole can of jellied cranberry sauce, a whole bottle of chili sauce, doubled the brown sugar and lemon juice.  Then I added most of a jar of boysenberry preserves - just because -and the kicker was two big squirts of Sriracha hot chili sauce.  I simmered them for 1.5 hours and brought them to a party at work the next day.  They reheat beautifully and they were a big hit - they were all eaten!

I just made this for a holiday party and it was a total hit!  I used Thai sweet chili and really just added to taste, considering my level of what's spicy goes way beyond what normal people consider spicy.  It was great!

I used venison which is very lean. I followed the recipe. I made this for a holiday party and everyone loved it. One guest said they could not stay away from the meatballs..

I use 1 jar of Heinz Chili Sauce and 1 jar Grape Jelly and frozen meatballs.  We call them Jelly Balls and have been making them for 30 yrs.  I also do them in the crock pot.

I personally did not try these but I made a double batch for my boyfriend and his friends on a football Sunday and they LOVED them. There were only 4 of them and they ate nearly an entire double batch. TWO POUNDS OF BEEF. Amazing. They all asked me to make them again soon so I assume they are fantastic.

I really enjoyed the sauce.  I probably would have liked a little more mustard flavor (I estimated the percent of the can of cranberry and I might have put in too much which diluted the mustardy flavor of the chili sauce - I'll be more careful next time).  When tasting the meatballs, I thought they seemed a bit on the bland side but thought that was probably so the flavor of the meatball wouldn't over shadow the flavor of the sauce.  If I were to do this again, I think I will add a little brown mustard or salt to the meatballs (worcestershire seems like it might overpower the delicate flavor of the sauce) and probably skip the brown sugar and lemon juice.  Overall, a terrific holiday recipe.  I will make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

Wish I would have made a LOT more, they disappeared quickly! I let them simmer in the crockpot all day and served them at a party. My husband commented several times that I should have made more (he loved them:) Only recommendation I have is if you are making them for a party you may want to make 4 times the recipe listed here. I doubled it and still didn't even fill half the crockpot. They are too good to run out of so quickly!

I use frozen meatballs and combine all of the ingredients in the slow cooker for about 2 hours. We have this for dinner with carrot and celery sticks and cheese cubes. My husband and three picky kids love these!

I have made these over and over and they are a hit every time! I have made them in a crock pot and on the stove top either way they are super and disappear in an instant.  The only changes I have made are to the meatball mix. I omit minced onion and add garlic salt. When serving it for dinner I serve them over rice.

Per another's suggestion, I used frozen meatballs (make sure they're NOT Italian) and my residents (I work in a senior living community) loved them!  I also made them last year for my boyfriend to take to his work potluck, and he asked me to make them again this year.  Tasty stuff!

These meatballs are soooooo good. We only used 1/4c chili sauce because we were taking them to our families for Xmas. Even w/ 1/4c chili sauce thses meatballs had a kick to them. Everyone loved them and they were gone w/in a half hour of our arrival. Everyone was raging about them and requesting the receipe. We will be making thses again for sure!

I must say, I was not impressed.  My husband wasn't a fan at all and I just thought they were average.  I might blame it on the chili sauce that I chose.  I could not find many options at the store.  I may give it another try if someone recommended what chilli sauce to use.

Delicious. I triped the recipe and made the meatballs on a Sunday a week in advance.  Cooked & froze them (cookie sheets & freezer bags for the freezing).  Then I threw everything is a slow cooker, and got lots of compliments on them!

These were very easy.. I followed the recipe exactly. I don't have a slow cooker so I made it on my stove top. I think the next time I'll add some extra herbs and spices to the meat balls and use less onion.

Next time I will double this recipe! I made this for SuperBowl and the meatballs were gone before halftime. I barely got to eat any. They were perfect. I used store bought frozen meatballs, made the sauce and then set the crock pot on high for 3 hours and then warmed them for the game. PERFECT!!

So yummy! These meatballs were addicting. The recipe is fine as-is, but I made a few adjustments.  I used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs, added a packet of onion soup mix, and 1 tsp. soy sauce.

I'm afraid I was a bit dissapointed with this one.  Not many were eaten at the New Year's Eve party and the leftovers were overlooked as well.  Ended up dumping quite a few in the trash.

This recipe went over very well with my boyfriend's family. No one could guess what I used in the sauce - which was sort of nice.    The only thing was that I had to add a lot more chili sauce than the recipe indicated. Perhaps I enjoy them a bit spicier, I ended up adding some hot sauce to give them a bit of a zing.

This is a good recipe, but was not a slam dunk for my family.  I love the meatball recipe, but the sauce was just okay.  I will definitely use the meatball recipe again though.

Super tasty!  Everybody gobbles them up.  I use Lipton Onion Soup mix instead of onions.

OMG, These were absolutely wonderful. The only thing I did differently was that I added worsteshire sauce to the meatballs. I also doubled the recipe and was very glad that I did as they were gobbled up very quickly! This recipe is perfect and will certainly be made over and over again in my home. Simple and delicious makes for a winning recipe in my book. Don't pass this one up! Thank you so much for posting this one. Five stars just isn't enough for this.

Delicious and easy. I substitute frozen meatballs instead of making them myself. Made them for the first time on New Year's and have made several times since, often by request

These were great.  It was very easy to make and done fairly quick.  I had to make some variations but it had a great flavor and the sauce was tasty.  I will have to make these again.

These were a hit on Christmas Eve!  I doubled the recipe and used 2 lbs of 93% lean ground beef which allowed for use of the entire jellied cranberry can and bottle of chile sauce (as stated in a previous review).  The minced onion and lemon juice I used were from fresh ingredients (not sure if the original recipe used dried minced onion or bottled lemon juice).  Not a single meatball was left!

I am only giving this four stars because I didn't have all the ingredient on hand. I made my own chili sauce but didn't have tomato sauce. I only had Seasoned Diced Tomato Sauce for chili. http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chili-Sauce/Detail.aspx Anyways, I did everything else and threw it in the crockpot and it came out great.

I made these for an appetizer at a Christmas Eve celebration. I used frozen meatballs and wish that I woudn't have, seemed kind of "blah" and know that homemade would of tasted much better. The sauce, however, was very tasty and a nice change from the grape jelly and barbeque sauce that I normally have had. The men of the family loved this hearty appetizer and I will definitely make this again...WITH the homemade meatball version that I'm sure this recipe was meant for. Thanks for posting!

this recipe was a bit bland to me.  I doctored it up and it came out prety good.  I used soy sauce, honey, worceshire and add a little liquid smoke (which took a bit of the sweetness out) I also added garlic powder and a little paprika.  I had to keep playing with the recipe until it was just right.  But I got requests on the recipe in the end!

Pretty good - kind of ketchup-y.  But, overall good; needs more spicy though if you like it hot.

I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the 3/4 C of chili sauce it calls for, must be a typo, if not the only people who could ever enjoy this are the ones who chew tobacco!  I will try again, but I will only add the amount of chili sauce as needed to the heat I like. The meatball recipe was fantastic, that is a keeper.

My husband and I have made this type of meatballs several times.  I was not impressed by this recipe.  I had high hopes because of all the reviews but did not think they were as great as anticipated.  Don't get me wrong, they were gone at the end of the party....I just didn't care for the sauce.

This was a big hit at the holiday party.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a whole bottle of heinz chili sauce and two cans of jellied cranberry sauce (and 2 pounds of ground beef).  They did not last long!

Love this recipe, used pre-made frozen meatballs for the first time, would probably use them again, but a better brand. Did not change anything else. Definitely a perfect "quick" cocktail item for any party. Tastes great, just the way it is!

I made these for a party last night.  They were very easy to make and were well received.  Without the sauce the meatballs are bland, so keep in mind, the sauce is everything.  Or simply add some spice to the balls for use in another dish.

Husband cannot get ENOUGH!  I used frozen meatballs, but made the sauce - which is incredible.  You will need 2x the sauce, but its worth it.  I just threw it all in the crock pot and let it go for a few hours...  yummmmm.

These were exactly what I was looking for.  Surprisingly, I like the cranberry jelly much better than grape.  These were a welcome addition to our neighborhood Halloween potluck.  BTW, I was out of brown sugar, so substituted regular.  No problem.

Like others, I used Italian Style frozen meatballs.  3 hours before my party, I combined the bag of frozen meatballs with 1 package Lipton soup mix, chili starter sauce and the few remaining incrediants into my crock pot.  My family loves things on the spicy side, so I added just about 2 tbsps of Franks Red Hot Sauce.  This was a HUGE hit at my party!  Everyone commented on how someone with the reputation for bad cooking could make such amazing meatballs.  What a great comment from a full Italian family!  Thank you for making me the hero of the party and keeping this my little meatball secret! :O)  5-stars recipe all day long!

I really only made the sauce and used frozen meatballs. I love this sauce - sweet, tangy, a little bit of spice. I made my sauce the night before - just barely combined the ingredients over heat. Then I poured it over the thawed out meatballs and let them sit in it overnight. About an hour and a half before my party, I put everything on the stove and let it simmer for awhile. I thought they turned out well. This is an easy appetizer to do for larger groups and it always turns out to be a winner. Thanks.

i really enjoyed this recipe! I did make a few changes, since it was summer when I made them I could not find the cranberry stuff needed, so I substituted a Currant Jelly.  I made the meatballs about twice as big as the recipe said to do, which meant that I did have to bake for longer. It was on purpose though, since I turned this into a meal instead of an appetizer. I put the cooked meatballs into the large pot that I made the sauce in, coated evenly, then put ontop on fresh sticky rice.  Everyone enjoyed, and I managed to save a meatball and rice for lunch the next day. I will definitely be making this for dinner again, and probably for appetizers too ;) thanks!

The meatballs were good.  Not quite sure about the sauce though.  Had a weird after-taste.  I will keep looking for a cocktail meatball recipe that we like better.

Excellent and very simple- do spray the baking sheet or foil with nonstick spray though...who knows how many times I will make that same mistake! But the sauce was quite good and it was quick and easy. Thanks!

These meatballs were delicious!  The sauce was incredible. I will admit that I used frozen meatballs.  The cranberry sauce makes these so flavorful.  At the end of the cooking, I added a container of BBQ sauce (I used Sweet Baby Rays brand) and mixed it all together and it turned out fabulous!!!!!!!

I made these for a "finger food" party, using frozen non-italian meatballs and Heinz sauce, doubling the sauce to use all the meatballs. They were not gobbled down at the party, and in fact there were more than half leftover. They were terribled re-heated, and we ended up throwing them out. I didn't think they were bad freshly made, but they certainly weren't as good as I was expecting either. I won't make them again.

Ive had many a cocktail meatball in my 27 yrs....but these are PERFECT!  I had guests that HOVERED over these for 30 minutes until they were all gone!  I even DOUBLED the batch!  My hubby and friends hubby ate almost all of them all by themselves!  These have the best flavor and beat out the grape jelly sauce by a LONGSHOT!  TERRIFIC!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

These went over really well.  I actually used frozen appetizer meatballs to save a bit of prep, and added a chopped chili in adobo sauce to give a little kick to it.

Loved them.  I didn't used a crockpot though and I used frozen meatballs.  I put all ingredients (except meatballs) in a large saucepan until hot then turned down the heat, added the meatballs and simmered until done.  Every last bite was gone.  Will definitely make these again!

Delicious!  Used frozen mini meatballs and a package of cocktail hot dogs.  Needed to add a bit more of the sauce ingredients since I had so much meat.  But YUMMY!  Served for New Year's Eve--10 people devoured them in a couple hours.

I liked the use of cranberry sauce better than the grape jelly recipe I tried once before. However, meatballs of this type still just don't wow me. My boyfriend enjoyed them more than I did. I guess it's all a matter of taste...

Yummy! I followed reviewer's suggestions of doubling the sauce (since the cranberry comes in 16oz cans) and ended up doubling the meatballs as well. The meatballs were kind of time consuming to roll up, but definitely worth it in the end. I made these for a New Year's Eve party and by New Years Day they were gone:). Next time I think I will still double the sauce, but put in a little less cranberry. It was tangy, but a tiny bit too sweet for moi.

I hate to admit this - but I used store bought meatballs, but the sauce from this recipe.  Put it all in the slow cooker in the morning and they were perfect when the guests arrived.  This will be my new meatball appetizer recipe - everyone loved it!

doubled the recipe so I could use the whole can of cranberry and the whole jar of chili sauce. Used 1 1/2 bags frozen meatballs (38 oz bags) and baked them in oven while prepping sauce on stove in a saucepan cuz I was in a hurry. It Filled up crockpot about 3/4 of the way-it was perfect! Everyone Loved it! Only 2 meatballs left at end of night. One young man told another guest, "those meatballs are Bombalicious"! That was the best comment! And you couldn't even tell it was cranberry sauce in there.

A terrific recipe! I added more seasonings to my meatballs - pepper, garlic and some worstershire. I served the meatballs with buttery mashed potatoes - use Yukon Gold. I will use this recipe again.

Very, very good! They remind me of something an older lady I know that she makes with ketchup and she calls them "sweetish meatballs." Everyone thought I had used some kind of BBQ sauce in these - they were quickly eaten up - and I doubled the recipe!

These were the perfect starter for our Christmas dinner (a nice contrast to the turkey).  I made 2 minor changes and that was I added a minced clove of garlic to the meat and substituted the bread crumbs with ground oatmeal.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these ahead and refrigerated the meatballs in th sauce.  I heated them in the crockpot for 2 hours before serving.  I also doubled the sauce.  I received a lot of kudos and it was nice to prep the dish in the morning and have it ready for our party in the evening.

I know, this is lame of me to even rate this recipe after I accidentally used HOT chili sauce and the meatballs were literally on fire in our mouths.  But, the next day, after refridgerating them and letting them "chill out" (no pun intended), they are really good.  I used venison burger, I always do.  I know I will try this again without burning my mouth off and using mild or medium chili sauce.  Even way too hot, they were pretty darn good.

I used store bought meatballs and double the sauce ingredients, using 2 jard of chili sauce. I heated everything up in the crockpot. I made these for an 11 yr old's Bday, and the kids did not care for them (should have went with sweet n sour). I thought they were ok, the sauce was a little tangy, but mellowed out by the next day.

I only put in half the hot sauce and it was so hot that's all I could taste and I like hot spicy dishes.  Sauce was a bit weird too.

These were good but didn't knock my socks off.  I made them for a baby shower and everyone liked them.  However, they were a little on the sweet side for me.  I'll make them again, though...just adjust accordingly.

I really enjoyed these.  I added Worcestershire sauce to the meatballs, and used honey instead of brown sugar to sweeten the sauce.  I baked the meatballs and then tossed 'em in the slowcooker for about an hour and a half on low.  Will make them again. :)

Yum!  Big hit at parties.  Don't set near rolls or people will think they belong in a sandwich.  Use frozen meatballs if you're in a hurry -- they turn out just as delicious and are ready  in no time!

I didn't make the meatballs, just used the sauce and I found it to be delicious. It seems to be just a tad bit sweet for my taste but I am sure that can be worked out by possibly leaving the brown sugar out and maybe just a little more chili sauce. Also, a previous reviewer made the suggestion of adding a bit of mustard for a little extra zing. That sounds wonderful to. But as it is, it really is a great tasting sauce. Thanks Lara!

Funny, but my guests always ask for these because they like them more than I do!  Don't get me wrong, they're good but I've had better.  I double this and use 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. ground turkey (mix it thoroughly and nobody ever notices!) I also brown the meatballs in the skillet and then put them in the crockpot with the sauce for 3 hours on low.  It blends the flavors better I think.  I've started adding a little pepper and garlic powder to the meat mixture, and using some broth instead of water.  It seems to kick it up a notch.

I have made these several times and they are a hit.  The girls at work are making them for their parties too.
Don't be fooled by the look or taste when first combined - it all blends perfectly in the crockpot. I do add approx 1 more spoonful of brown sugar. Try this it will become a favorite!

These were a big hit at my party...they were better as the day went on and they simmered in the slow cooker.  I used a little less chile sauce, and used a Thai chile sauce which was excellent.  Frozen meatballs worked great, but I can see how it would be better with homemade meatballs.

This was perfect for our New Years Eve party.
I am definitely making these again.
I didn't have time to make homemade meatballs so I picked up a bag of 80-count Homestyle Meatballs from Walmart. 
Other than that, I followed the sauce recipe to the "T" - THEY WERE WONDERFUL!!! THANKS!

Wow! Check out the fire of your chili sauce before you add 3/4 cup! We like it hot and spicy, but after quadrupling the other sauce ingredients I only added 1 cup chili sauce. Plennnty HOT! I may use less next time. I added salt, lemon pepper and garlic powder to the meat and tripled the amt. of meat and other meat ingredients. Absolutely great recipe!

All of my holiday party guests enjoyed these and I rec'd many "best ever" compliments as well so -Thanks!  I was serving an unknown number of guests so I mixed 5 lbs. ground beef and onion soup mix with the rest of the recipe as as is... EXCEPT - I mixed 2 cans of the cranberry jelly sauce with 2 cans of "hot dog chilli" sauce in a can because it was the only thing I found in my grocery store that was titled anything similiar?? I will continue in my search because I can't even imagine these being even better with the right chilli sauce! I will also use store bought meatballs in the future because I had to enlist the help of my children with that process - they loved it, but even with the three of us that was a long job!

After reading the reviews of others, I knew I could take these to a party without "testing" at home first.  I used a 2# bag of frozen turkey meatballs and baked according to directions.  Then doubled the sauce recipe and put everything into the crock pot on LO.  Doubling the recipe means you use 1 bottle of chili sauce and 1 can of cranberry.  Wow - so easy and good.

Served this last night at a wine tasting. Everyone loved it and went back to the slow cooker three or four times. Made the sauce exactly as the recipe directed and used frozen meatballs to save time...SO GOOD AND EASY. Will make again and again. Already shared the recipe with many people.

This past Christmas season my husband and I had family over and I decided to do a bunch of fun appetizers instead of the usual.  I made this recipe as one of about 8 appetizers.  It was gone in no time and everyone was asking if there was more!  Next time, I think I'll double the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. The meatballs by themselves have no flavor, they have to be simmered in the sauce long enough for the flavor to "sink in" and that took approx. 3 hours for me. Noone believed there was cranberry in the sauce. I didn't think the sauce was too sweet either. These were ok, but i see why many people buy the frozen meatballs.

This indeed did have a very different flavor. I did spice up the meatballs (used a combination of pork and lean beef, a clove of crushed garlic, 1/3 cup chopped parsley and soy sauce as  well as about 2 TBS of cream). I did have to add a bit of water to get the sauce to cover all the meatballs. It didnt hurt anything.

I have made these meatballs several times now.  They turn out perfect each time and even the person who doesn't like meatballs actually enjoyed them. I have prepared them using ground beef, and also buying them pre made and frozen.  The homemade are worth the extra effort, but if you're in a hurry, buy the premade meatballs.

I was a skeptic right until I tasted them.  Especially when I saw the cranberry jelly and chili sauce.  I used frozen meatballs and the combination was great.  Made meatball subs with the leftovers the next day.  I'll definitely make these again.  Great potluck fare!

This was a real crowd pleaser. I doubled the recipe knowing we were having a large crowd for a lighted boat parade. I used frozen meatballs and omitted the brown sugar. When the meatballs were gone, people started to use the sauce as a dip. Wonderful, wonderful. Thanks very much Lara!!!

This turned out wonderful! I have always used a recipe that called for grape jelly instead of cranberry sauce, but this is soooo much better!!! They were the first appetizers gone at my last party! Thank you Lara!

This recipe was a HUGE hit at our vol. fire dept. Christmas party. Everyone loved them and they were the first thing to go! I did use frozen mini meatballs, I just thawed them before adding them to the pot,  but used the original recipe for the sauce and it was amazing! Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was easy- especially since I used frozen meatballs as suggested by the others.  The taste was good, but not exceptional, however my guests liked it very much (especially the kids). I was hoping they'd be a bit spicier.  The next day, I mixed it with some tabasco sauce and warmed it up for a meatball sub (with grated mozza) and it was very good that way.

Doubled the recipe to use a whole 2 pound box of frozen, cooked meatballs, a full bottle of chili sauce and a whole can of cranberry jelly. It made a lot of sauce. Don't think it needs the brown sugar; I splashed in a good bit of hot pepper sauce for some zing. Don't be afraid to leave it in the slow cooker a little longer. Very easy and very yummy!

When making the original recipe, it definitely seems to be a small amount.  So, I mixed a pound of italian sausage in with the ground beef & doubled the sauce ingredients also.  It was awesome.  I will make this again & definitely add the italian sausage with it, for seasoning!

These were pretty good....the unusual ingredient combo actually makes a nice sweet and sour sauce. My only problem is I made the meatballs too big (they should be bite sized!), so I will be serving them for dinner over rice. Yummy!!

I made this for a Christmas Party after seeing all the positive reviews. I was determined not to have any left over and only made 30 meatballs. They were a HUGE hit. I cannot say how they taste, however, because I did not GET ONE! LOL

Very good! I used garlic herb bread crumbs and added salt to the meat mixture. I will definitely make them again-probably without the brown sugar. Just a tad too sweet for me.
I made them again without the brown sugar and they were excellent! Company loved them and asked for the recipe.

I made these for a Christmas Eve drop in party, and they were fantastic...not one meatball left in the crockpot!  I jazzed up the meatballs a little by using seasoned bread crumbs, Worchester sauce, crushed red pepper flakes, and garlic.

Yum, yum, yum. I make these every year now for any family gathering, my family can't get enough! I cheat & use frozen mini-meatballs, and they come out excellent!  I just drop them frozen & let them simmer.

YumYum! Tasty, tasty lil meatballs.  These went quickly in my house. My children had friends over and everyone loved them.  Will make them for holidays or party food as they are pretty rich. But I highly recommend them.  If you want something real tasty. Try them.

I made these so my family could munch while the Christmas ham was cooking.  I actually combined store-bought frozen swedish meatballs with the sauce.  My husband balked while I was preparing them, but he couldn't stop eating them!!!  Very good.  I will definately make them again.

I made a change to the recipe which I made to take to the office.  I didn't have the chili sauce so I added hot picante sauce instead.  Needless to say, they were a hit.  I had made extra meatballs and prepared them according to the recipe (using chili sauce).  My family enjoyed them as well.  My preferance is picante.

Fantastic!  I made this recipe for my husband's birthday party.  I doubled the recipe and thought that I would have leftovers for the next day's lunch, but boy was I wrong!  These went so fast, and I received compliment after compliment.  I don't even particularly like meatballs, and I thought these were delicious.  I read the reviews on the recipe, but I didn't change any of the ingredients.  They were also incredibly easy to make.  I will make these at least twice a month now.

These meatballs are fantastic! They are not spicy at all from the chili sauce. My kids were eating them and didn't find them spicy either. I made it exactly like the recipe said except I used store bought meatballs. I cook mine in a slow cooker for about 4 hours on low and then transfer to my fry daddy to keep them on warm. My slow cooker, on low, was burning the sauce. After being on warm for about 6 hours, the meatballs were so tender because the sauce cooked all the way through. I am now having to make these again for our friends open-house gathering. One of these days I would like to try this with some hot pepper sauce. Bet the sweet and spicy flavor would be awesome. Thanks for sharing such a great and easy recipe. Its a favorite around here now.

Wow, these were so good!! This recipe really deserves more than 5 stars!! My mom and I are in love with these little meatballs, and neither of us are huge meat fans either.  I think that one thing that made these meatballs so rich is that we toasted about 2 slices of white bread and tore them into small bits (as opposed to bread crumbs).  Well, that was the first time we made them; the second time we made them we used whole wheat bread and they still turned out delicious!!  The sauce is really what makes this recipe fantastic, and next time I am going to double the amount of ingredients used to make it (lemon juice, sugar, cranberry sauce, and chilli sauce), just so we will have twice as mush sauce :-)  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made a 35 serving recipe of these meatballs, and added a little garlic powder to the meatballs themselves. They were a little sweeter than I like them, but I served them in a crockpot at a party and there was one lone meatball left at the end of the event.  My friends raved about how good they were and told me to bring them to the next party. Don't think this will be a "signature" dish for me, but, I enjoyed making them and they did go over well.

I was lazy and used pre-cooked meatballs with this sauce. My husband hates cranberry sauce. So I did'nt tell him the sauce was made of until he'd already had two bowlfuls!! It's a great appetizer to take to a party...

Tried this over Christmas.  Absolutely excellent and what a bonus to cook in the oven instead of all that tiresome frying!  Froze well.

I made this recipe for a New Year's party using Schwan's Italian meatballs and it was a major hit! So incredibly easy. Tastes even better the next day. I can't wait to make it again.

Wonderful!  I made a double recipe for an xmas party and they were gone in minutes.  I added quite a bit of garlic powder to the meatballs and also substituted onion powder for onions because I was short on time.  There were so good that I made them the same way as a main course for dinner the other night and we ate them over egg noodles.

I was reluctant to try this but as the other reviewers have said, these are the best.  I used frozen meatballs and added a little jelly to the cranberry sauce.  As suggested I also played around with the amount of chili sauce until I was happy with the flavor.  I will definately make this recipe again.

This is such an easy recipe.  I leave these out often in a crockpot for an appetizer.  To make it even easier - I buy frozen meatballs at a local meat shop so all I do is dump the ingrdients into my crockpot and put out some toothpicks for everyone to help themselves.  Always get lots of compliments on this.  The men in our family LOVE this!

This was an interesting dish, butjust didn't do much for me and hubby.  The meatballs turned out too "moist", and we prefer them firmer.  I also just couldn't reconcile the sweetness with the chile...

Thank you, Lara !  Everyone is raving about the sauce.  I did use frozen meatballs, the same brand as the frozen pesto.  So, I added a tbs of worcestershire to sauce.

I had my doubts when I read the recipe but have had absolute raves from the people I work with all day!  My variation - I used the frozen meatballs because I filled a 6 qt crock pot.  Made the sauce and just before I went to bed added the meatballs and left the crock pot on low all night.  They were perfect!

I was disappointed in these meatballs after reading the great reviews.  I made them for an office potluck and ended up taking most of them home.  The frozen meatballs with purchased sauce brought by another staff member tasted much better.

SUPER****  The sauce is very special my husband raved and ate, he is taking the recipe to work for the guys.  The Cranberry is a great change of pace.  Thanks for sharing.....Fire Mom.

This was a big hit Christmas Day!  The sweetness of the cranberry was well balanced by the kick of the chili sauce.

Great tasting meatballs. They were a hit at the Christmas Party.
This recipe is a keeper in my book.

I scaled this recipe up quite a bit since I made it for T-giving.  I added grape jelly as another reviewer had suggested and I think that was a good idea; It was a bit too hot for most (I think the overpowering nature of the chili sauce may have been due to scaling).  I will definitely 'play' with this recipe as the base was quite good!

My mother-in-law gave me this recipe when I was first married...20 years ago. I have always won rave reviews at parties, pot-lucks, etc. My "boys" are now 16 and 18 years old and still ask for this for dinner! They like it served with either noodles or rice (to pour the sauce over) and brussel sprouts. They call it "the round dinner" because the meatballs and brussel sprouts are both round! These kids today! ha!ha!

I used frozen meatballs and put everything in a crock pot for four hours.  It turned out very nice and spicy!!  The comments regarding the chili sauce were great.  There are so many kinds.  For years I had been using the Asian sweet chili sauce as it was the only one I could find.  Finally someone pointed out the Heinz chili sauce so used that too.  Both got 5 stars from everyone.  So, if you want a sweeter sauce, play with your chili sauces.

Very easy and buffet friendly!  Would add a bit more chili's, but overall you cannot go wrong with this appetizer.  Just prepare and then throw into a crock-pot and walk away, trust me they will all disappear.

Absolutely love this recipe!  I happen to be a huge fan of sweet & sour, so these meatballs
are right up my alley.  My whole family enjoys them and I always try to find an excuse to make
them.  So happy I found this recipe!

This is the perfect appetizer for the meat eaters at your party. I found the sauce to be a little too sweet so I decreased the cranberry sauce and increased the chile sauce. Perfect!

I made this for a Christmas party, and unbeknownst to me another family member made the “traditional” version with grape jelly. 

Keeping in mind I’ve never made them before - any version - and that I’ve not tasted any version of them in probably 15 years (so I have no memory of the flavor), I can honestly say this version is more flavorful, and less sweet, and I’d make them again for sure.

Notes:

- ran out of time to make my own meatballs. I couldn’t find frozen meatballs at 3/4 stores I tried (is this just a Northern Virginia issue???), but Safeway came through with Rosina brand Angus Beef frozen meatballs. They’re larger than I’d have made myself, but worked fine. They are not Italian, but do have a mild seasoning of garlic, onion and bell pepper - which worked just fine as those are also in chili sauce.

- used Organics 365 cranberry jelly, which has less sugar, no HFCS,  and a really nice tart flavor

- used 2/3 Heinz chili sauce, but I made multiple batches and they only had 2 jars left, so my 3rd was a jar of a family brand that I found out later has quite a cult following, called “Homade Chilli Sauce”. The jar is the shape and size of a softball, and was delicious (and no corn syrup - but does have sesame seeds, which I know some people are allergic too). 

While I generally oppose making “special occasion” comfort food dishes like this “healthy” because it’s a treat, bot a meal staple, if it’s easy to do it without compromising the flavor then why not?

Loved this recipe.  I made it for Christmas Eve and everyone raved about it!  I didn't make any changes except to double the meatballs and triple the sauce.  I made the meatballs and the sauce the day before but did not cook them until the day of eating them. Thanks!!

Easy to make, especially when you are busy making other food.  Followed the recipe exactly with no changes.  Possible changes I would make would to add something to give it a mild hot heat.

Basically doubled this recipe to use with about 2 lbs of frozen Trader Joe's meatballs. Used the entire 12 oz jar of Heinz Chili Sauce, the whole can of the jellied cranberries, 3 tbsp of lemon juice and 2 tbsp of brown sugar.  Easy, perfect, no leftovers :)

I added a full packet of the onion soup mix as several reviews suggested.  I also added 1/4 cup ketchup in place of water and 1 tsp of soy sauce and corn flakes instead of bread crumbs as another review suggested.  That part I would do again.  My daughter is highly sensitive to any spice so I was going to use half the meatballs with the sauce and create a different dish without the chili sauce for her.  Before putting in the sauce I thought the meatballs were too strong in onion from using a full packet of soup mix - and I love onion.  Once in the sauce they were great.    I'm going to use half the onion soup mix next time or just stick to the recipe which didn't call for it at all.

Fantastic! I used ground sirloin so there was only a tiny bit of grease. Next time I think I'll add some garlic powder or garlic salt to give the meat mixture a little more flavor.

This was delicious! The chili sauce is not what I think chili sauce is, which is really hot! I knew 3/4 cup was waaaaay too much of the chili paste. So I added bbq sauce & vinegar with the chili paste to give it some kick instead of the straight “chili sauce“ according to the recipe. Still turned out fantastic!

I put the dough in the fridge to chill, then rolled  and cut into holiday shapes.  I felt they needed more sugar (maybe 1/4 cup].  They were best after cooling completely.

I would make them again! they were great, I am glad I read the reviews about the can sizes and letting them sit over night. I used frozen meat balls and I made the sauce up and let it sit over night then added the balls and did in the crockpot and served them at work today. loads of complements!!! thank you so much!!

Amazing and simple! Used two bags of frozen meatballs, and doubled the sauce.  Still thought it was too dry, so I used another can of cranberry, half a jar of chili sauce, and another splash of the lemon and sugar.  Everyone loved them and wanted me to make again! Definitely a keeper!

Very good, I've been making a similar recipe for over 30 yrs.  Beleive it or not, using grape jelly rather than cranberry sauce and a dash or two of hot sauce, kicks it up a notch.  I fry the meatballs until browned evenly, then put them in crockpot.  I make the sauce and stir in with meatballs, and just let them cook on low in crockpot.  Never a leftover no matter how many I make.

I added some pork sausage with the hamburger, black pepper and sea salt. I used fresh bread crumbs always a plus. I did end up doubling the recipe so using a full bottle of chili sauce and a 14 ounce can of jellied cranberry, was perfect. I would to definitely make these again. My neighbor loved them.

Doesn't need changed. But I have used very fine rolled crackers instead of bread crumbs. Also I've added onions to the simmering  sauce.. I have made this quite a few times everyone loves them. Thanks...

I doubled the recipe and used venison. I really enjoyed it. It's not as sweet as those meatballs you see that have been stewing in grape jelly, which is a great thing for me. The taste lends itself to be paired with some mustard or horseradish on a sandwich if you so choose to eat them that way. But great as they are.

These are my go-to for parties. Super easy to make ahead of time then just throw them in the slow cooker. Everyone LOVES them. I do use frozen meatballs because it's so much easier.

This recipe was delicious and very well-received. I followed the exact recipe for the meatballs, but for the sauce I changed it a little.  I used one 348 ml can of Ocean Spray Jellied Cranberry Sauce, and 1/2 cup of Frank’s RedHot Sauce. Turned out great! Will be making them as appetizers for every house party from now on.

Made this according to the recipe. The sauce was very tasty. For those who are figuring ratios with the typical 14oz can of cranberry sauce, set AR servings to 17 and you’ll have the measurements to use a whole can of cranberry sauce. I cheated and used Armour original meatballs, though any variety of plan meatballs would do. The sauce is sweet, but no more so than most sweet sauced meatball recipes.

I doubled this recipe for a potluck. The chili sauce was overpowering and together it tasted like meatloaf. I fixed the sauce with grape jelly.  Won't be making this again.

These were a definite hit at the party!  It was a little scary trying a new recipe for the first time at an event but this one was a bit hit.  Who would have thought jellied cranberry would be so good with beef!  I created exactly as written although I bet ground turkey would work just as well.

So easy to do.  Used frozen meatballs cooked in the oven then literally threw it into the sauce I already prepared.  Simmered about 1 hour on top of stove.

I used frozen meatballs. The sauce was delicious.
When I made the meatballs I used a 1/4 cup of chili sauce instead of water.
Used 1 T graduated onion
Added 1 tsp of soy sauce to beef and an additional 1 tsp of Worcester sauce when I used ground turkey

Excellent recipe. I was looking for a recipe like this for my contribution to a Christmas party. This is also an easy recipe to tweak based on personal preferences. For example, I added some additional seasoning to my meatballs for additional flavor. For the sauce, I used the juice of a clementine instead of lemon to impart a more Christmassy flavor. though this modification needed something else to find out the flavor so I added a bit of ground mustard. 

So whether you use the recipe as written or modify it, this recipe is certainly a keeper!

I made it, used frozen meatballs which were a pound and one quarter. Made recipe as is, except increased sauce portions to one and a half to cover the additional meatballs. Was plenty of sauce. Dish tasted great and everyone at the dinner loved it! Will make again.

I added 1/2 pound ground pork for extra flavor. It was the hit at the party. Made some extra to freeze.

This was super easy, made easier because I just used frozen meatballs (plain, not with italian seasoning). I made it for a holiday party and everyone loved it!

These meatballs are AWESOME!!!! I served them at my son's wedding reception and they were a huge hit.  I was asked for the recipe from several people.  They are my grandchildren's favorite meat dish.  I just throw it all into a crockpot with frozen meatballs and that makes it even easier to make.  I haven't made the meatballs, so I am only rating the sauce!!!!

Yes I would make it again, it was very good, and all those that had some really liked the recipe.  I changed out ground turkey for ground beef.

There was nothing special  about them.  I thought the sauce would be better with the cranberry sauce, but the taste of the cranberry wasn't very prominent.

Is it just me or is the meatball mixture missing salt? I found these a little bit bland. The sauce is fabulous. If I’m rating it just on the sauce, I’d give it a 4.

These were a big hit at my church pot luck lunch! I typically make all my food from scratch but after a long week I was looking for something simple to throw in  crockpot  on Sunday morning.  When you make it be sure to MINCE the onion as directed. I did not, and ended up with unsightly onion chunks in the meatballs. I doubled the recipe since the cranberry sauce comes in larger cans than the recipe calls for.  They weren't the best meatballs I have ever made but given the simplicity of the recipe I would make them again for a big party.

Fyi....  If using Lipton Onion Soup mix as previously stated by another Reviewer,  try MRS GRASS ONION SOUP MIX instead.  Way less salty and more full of  flavor.  Actually it is great for base in beef stew and baked on pot roast with an inch of water on the bottom.   Best versatile soup mix EVER and no extra salt is needed in the recipe.

Made this for my father's 90th birthday celebration. Because the party was put together on fairly short notice, I looked for an easy, yet good appetizer to bring. Worked like a charm. As others have mentioned, I did use Armour (non-Italian) meatballs; otherwise I used the recipe as stated. They were a big hit. Everyone wanted to know what I did.  As others have mentioned, because there was a large group attending, I got 3 bags of frozen meatballs, used a full can of the cranberry jelly, 2 bottles of Heinz "Chili Sauce", and doubled the other ingredients. Just mixed them all together in Crock Pot for a couple hours ahead and was done.  Will be using again, for sure!

When I first read the ingredients for these meatballs, I thought they would be awful. I decided to make them after reading the reviews. They were awesome. They were a definite hit. I will make them again.

These were a pretty big hit on New Year’s Eve with both the adults and kids!  They weren’t quite as tender as I would have liked, but they were very tasty.  I served them on cocktail forks - was thinking next time I would add a piece of pineapple per meatball.

Fantastic! Only change I made is to use Lipton Onion Soup Mix, rather than chopped onion as suggested by other reviewers. I doubled this recipe and got 46 meatballs from two pounds of ground beef. With a pasta casserole, three adults polished off 30  meatballs for dinner! I'm definitely making this again.  It's extremely easy to make, not overly sweet, and the meatballs hold together very well. I cooked them on high in the pressure cooker (cold from fridge as I made the meatballs and sauce the night before) for about two hours. If you're going to make them for a party, I'd switch to low or keep warm after 2 to 3 hours depending on how hot your slow cooker runs.  For reference, I made these in a 7 quart slow cooker and  I think for that size slow cooker, you could easily use 5 to 6 lbs of meat.  If you plan on making these for a party, I recommend making the meatballs in advance, freeze them, and then defrost before using to save time. Great recipe for dinner, potlucks, or parties.

These meatballs are easy and delicious. Watch the measurements! I found a can of cranberry sauce to be 14 oz and this calls for an 8 oz “can.” The lemon juice adds nice acidity. My only change was to add about 1/2 t of Worcestershire sauce. I also made this with frozen meatballs (NOT Italian) and it only needed 2.5 hours on high in my slow cooker.

I like the grape jelly version better - 1/2 grape jelly & 1/2 chili sauce.  The smell of the cranberry sauce is very strong.  However, it tastes better than it smells.  I melted the sauce in a crock pot and then added the cooked meatballs.

These are delicious! I made them for a holiday party and all of my guests loved them. I was short on time, so I used pre-cooked turkey meatballs, but the flavors of the sauce still shined through. I added about 1/4 tsp of Worcestershire sauce to the recipe and put all the ingredients in the slow cooker. I will definitely make these again!

Loved this recipe! As I left party with my crockpot friends saying good old bye in driveway, kept grabbing one last bite! However, on making it and tasting it, there was something missing! my neigbor realized immediately and it out the perfect twang to it. WHISKEY! I added makers mark and that topped the sweetness as it cooked down.  Yum yum!!!

Decided to make these last minute, I used frozen meatballs bc of the time crunch. My guests gobbled them all up and I had to make more! One guest was just amazed with the sauce, I told him that I got the recipe from here. Thank you for sharing this recipe

I honestly hate meatballs. I never eat them. My friend wanted me to make these for her baby shower so if course I said yes and made them. They were honestly delicious! Here's the changes I made: I doubled the meat, eggs, and bread crumbs. Instead of minced onions, I used a packet of dry onion mix soup. I used 3/4 a can of jellied cranberries. I used chicken broth instead of water. I would have used beef broth, but I didn't have any on hand. I used Italian Seasoning, Garlic Powder, and Parsley to season the meat. I didn't measure them, just eye balled. For the sauce, I made my own mixture. I used mainly ketchup for the base and added a little  A1 sauce and Worcestershire sauce. I used lemon juice per recipe, garlic powder, and 2 bay leaves. I simmer the sauce on low on the stove top. Flipped the meatballs halfway through cooking, and put the meatballs with sauce in a crockpot to stay warm when finished

I used this sauce along with my own tried-and-true meatball recipe, and served them at a large graduation party last weekend.  The meatballs were a HUGE hit with this sauce...honestly I didn't know meatballs could get such rave reviews!!  I made 12 lbs of meatballs ahead of time (sized about 18 meatballs per pound) and froze them until the big day.  I heated up the frozen meatballs in an 18-qt electric roaster with the 12 times the sauce mix about 2-1/2 hours before serving, stirring occasionally.  It couldn't have been any easier!!  (FYI, my meatball recipe uses milk and oatmeal instead of egg and breadcrumbs -- and I use home-raised beef.  This makes a very tender and moist meatball.)

I did not have all ingredients -- did not matter, just mix BBQ sauces with cranberry sauces and its perfect.  These meatballs FLEW gone at a party with a lot of food. Gone in five minutes.  Just cook the meatballs the night before, mix the sauces, mix in with cooked meatballs, microwave, and enjoy! BTW frozen meatball suck compared to these, HUGE difference.

I did make this, my guests thoroughly enjoyed them. By the end of the evening they were GONE. The second time I made them I stumbled on "Party Meatballs" they were the perfect size and cut the preparation time in half.  If you aren't doing last minute entertaining I highly suggest you make this recipe from start to finish. IF you're having a last minute get together and time is limited keep a few packages of Party Meatballs in your freezer.

I needed something to feed a crowd and these were fantastic!  I quadrupled the batch and it made about 70 meatballs.  I did substitute 1 pound of meat for ground pork and wish I had diced my onions a little smaller but this is a new go to recipe for me.  There were only a few left and people raved about them!

It wasn't as savory as I had hoped but I think that might be because I don't like cranberries. I only had like two meatballs and I was already pretty stuffed so that might have something to do with it. Also, there were a few meatballs leftover so I assume that's because other people at the Super Bowl party didn't like them very much. Maybe they just don't like cranberries either. Who knows?

I didn't make any changes in the recipe. I made the meatballs a couple of hours ahead of the party and then put the sauce ingredients in a small crockpot. About 20 minutes before Super Bowl I put the meatballs in and let them heat up. It was the only appetizer that was gone at half time. And I had Market Street Grill Crab Artichoke dip too. Still have it!

Delicious. Easy. I used ground turkey, because I had some in the fridge. I also had a small jar of cranberry-jalapeno pepper jelly so I used that as my glaze - just simmered on stove to thin.

They were okay, but I wouldn't make them again.  I liked the sauce okay, but the meatballs themselves were very bland (which makes sense since they only have bread crumbs, eggs, water, and onion).  If you do make these, I would recommend adding some more seasonings to the meat balls.

I used a bag of market pantry Italian style meatballs from Target. I substituted catsup for the cocktail sauce, doubled, the amount of lemon juice and brown sugar, and the flavor of the sauce was excellent. I also used a 14 ounce can of cranberry sauce and used approximately one cup of ketchup. Good luck, and happy snacking!

These were pretty good. Didn't cook them for the time it says, and the sauce was a bit dry. Other chef status people could have added something to make the sauce more of a sauce instead of a thick coated meatball. I even dumped the grease from the meatballs into the sauce thinking that would help.  The meatballs were great though!

I will definitely make these meatballs again! My guests liked these meatballs so much they apologized for eating them so quickly! LOL. Small change: I used Lipton Onion Soup Mix instead of diced onions and baked in the oven using a broiler pan so the grease could drain off while they cooked.  Broiler pan tip is invaluable!

I was making a double batch and only had one can of cranberry sauce so I added some cherry jelly but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Take the time to make the meatballs you won't be sorry...they are so much better than store bought as many guests commented.

Made this for New Years Eve party and they were really good!  My husband and a lot of guests loved them.  I did not substitute anything.  Did not take that long to make.  We kept them in crockpot to keep warm all evening.  I will definitely make these again for another party!

I made no changes. Followed recipe exactly. However, we made these for a church luncheon, but they were so blase I skipped it. Very common and not quality. But edible...

This was really yummy. For a bit of a kick, I added 2 parts chili sauce, and 1 part sriracha and it was wonderful. All of the flavor comes in with the addition of the sauce.

Didn't really change it up.  It's good as is!  I did add some of the minced onion to the sauce as they were simmering in the crock pot but that's about it.

Wow.  This was such a hit with kids and adults at my christmas party.  It definitely had a "meatloaf"ish taste to it, and I made the recipe exactly as stated including the meatballs from scratch.  I think this was due to the Heinz brand chili sauce that doesnt taste much different than ketchup, and the onion in the homemade meatballs.  I put the sauce ingredients in a slow cooker on high and mixed them up while the meatballs were cooking.  Then transferred the meatballs when done and turned the slow cooker to low.  The sauce was to die for.  I could have eaten it by itself with a spoon.  My sister makes a similar recipe with frozen meatballs, grape jelly and the same chili sauce, and to me it doesnt even compare.  Try this with homemade meatballs as stated instead of frozen and it's a completely different and BETTER taste.  The lemon, brown sugar, and cranberry sauce really made this unique!  Will make again VERY soon.

I made these with a homemade cranberry  jelly.  I was also out of ground beef, so I used breakfast sausage and leftover chicken breast from another meal.  You could use virtually any chicken/turkey combo with sausage or beef and I believe they would taste wonderful.  To make them gluten free I used gluten free breadcrumbs.  

I can't wait to make the meatballs to use in spaghetti.  They were super easy and low cleanup.

I've made this a few times now. It's a great basic meatball recipe. I recently made about 10 lbs worth (about 200 meatballs) and then freeze them in several packages. For Christmas dinner I made this sauce with them and then over the next couple months use the rest of them with other sauces and gravies.

I have returned to this recipe so many times and have made it over and over. I have the recipe memorized, but I come back to it every time to make 100% sure I haven't left anything out. These meatballs are ridiculously good. They absolutely deserve 5 STARS. I usually make them for Thanksgiving and Christmas, but will make an excuse to have them for just about anything. The flavors are perfectly balanced and delightful! Please do try them; you will NOT be disappointed and your company will think you are a meatball pro! They all think that of me :-D

Love this recipe. Made it exactly as written. It took less time to cook than in the directions, perhaps because my meatballs were smaller. I cooked them at 350° for 15 minutes, and were perfect.  I put all of the ingredients in a slow cooker for a couple of hours, rather than cooking the sauce on the stove. My family loved it.

Like them bethere made with grape jelly. This recipe is a little tangier and with grape jelly, it's a little sweeter. Either way, they are delicious ??

I made this exactly to recipe. The meatballs were bland on their own which you never want because some people won't dip in extra sauce. And the sauce was waaaaaay to spicy. It just tasted one dimensional - of chili sauce with a hint of cranberry. I couldn't even eat more than one of these. My dad thought they were ok. I made these as a dry run for a holiday party I am having next week and these definitely won't be on the menu.

I used sweet tai chilli sauce and added a bit of ketchup because I didn't have cranberry sauce on hand! They still turned out delicious! I made the meatballs the night before and refrigerated. Simmered  with sauce in slow cooker just before serving, these are easy, yummy and I would definitely make again!

I will make it again.  I would add another egg and 1 tbsp flour to hold the meatballs together.  They tend to break up in transfer.

I made these first for a small gathering...and am making changes for my larger batch- so I did make some changes according to the post suggestions...that being said...don't substitute ketchup for the water, the chili sauce is already close to ketchup. I did add the soy sauce to the sauce...liked...added the parsley to the meatballs....liked.  On the sauce though...it was still to 'ketchup-y' for me so I doubled the soy sauce I added (I never put water in it) and then put in some (2 Tbsp) hot sauce I had (specialty- I don't think I'd recommend something like Franks or Cholula). I am following suggestions again and have cooked the meatballs and made the sauce, I poured the sauce over the cooked meatballs and letting it all sit overnight to meld together....everyone loved these meatballs!

One thing- don't use too lean of a meat- I used ground beef from our cow and it was too lean, not enough fat to hold it all together. The second batch I mixed ground chuck to my lean beef 50-50.

I hope these suggestions help someone else!  And, thank you everyone for posting ideas....I rarely ever follow a recipe as written  and love reading the personalized ideas! Thank you!

I was very happy with the results of this recipe.  I made enough to bring to two potluck dinners & they were enjoyed by many. I will use this recipe again.  I love my slow cooker.

Cheated and used frozen meatballs from Costco. My guests LOVED it and enjoyed wandering back to the crock pot for more.

Love, love, love these and will make again!  I was serving for a party and kept them warm in a crock pot.  As some suggested I doubled the sauce recipe and found it was totally unnecessary if you use a crock pot that's not too large.  My meatballs went all the way to the top of the pot, then I poured the sauce over.  There was plenty of sauce for the 3-4 hours and I had at least 15 oz. that I never even used.

Too much sauce and not enough meat.  Next time I will double the meat.  Tasty though.

I made these meatballs for my Christmas Party.  They were really very good.  I usually test a recipe first, but it sounded good so I took a chance and chose to make it and bring it to the party.  Very easy and so much better than a bought sauce.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you.

Well, it was okaaayy. A lot of people liked them but I was really disappointed by the taste.  The only change I made was using half ground turkey/half ground beef and then I added just a dash of worcestshire sauce like some of the reviews suggested.  I wish I had added more bc that might have given it some actual flavor.  I love sweet,  but this was sweet with no depth.  The sauce almost tasted like spaghettios to me. The meatballs before i put them in the sauce had no taste.  I noticed that there was no seasoning in the recipe,  even salt, and you can taste the lack of spice.  I think the recommendation to swap the diced onions for lipton onion soup mix is smart and would add more seasoning to it.  Also the heinz chili sauce was like glorified ketchup to me.  Next time I would try maybe a Thai sweet chili sauce for more tang,  or i would add some chili flakes (just to give it a small touch of spice, nothing too strong,  but so that it's not so 1 dimensional.) I do appreciate the simplicity of the recipe and with tweaks I do think it could be very good. I was the one who was the most critical,  everyone did seem to like it and they ate them,  so they were at least passable.

HOME RUN appitizer! 
Easy to prepare and tastes like it was an all day event 
Taking suggestions from others:  I used ketchup instead of water,  added Lipton Onion mix  and I out in fresh onions. 
A million thanks you's for the recipe and suggested alterations !

I tried several new recipes for our Tailgate party and this was one of the big successes of the night. I had to make my own chili sauce (using an Allrecipes version) and ended up mistakenly using entire can of cranberry sauce but was perfect. I used the crockpot and it simmered for hours. Will be saving this one and making again.

I used a combo of venison and wild boar, doubled the recipe, then added a 1/2 pt of hot pepper jelly instead of extra cranberry sauce. This will become a staple at our gathering's.

These were good. I needed to thicken the sauce. I cooked them in a slowcooker and added corn starch to make the sauce really thick. I used cranberry sauce instead of jelly.

These were very tasty, but just a little too sweet / ketchupy (Heinz chili sauce). I followed the exact recipe, and  we really did like them, but quite a basic recipe for the meatballs themselves, next time will add a bit of a kick with something spicy / salty. I think these would be great around Christmas time.

My crock pot is always the first one empty at any party I bring these to. I would never use frozen meatballs as some other suggested. The meatballs get flavor from browning them in the oven. Perfect!

I make these except I put the meatballs in a 9x13 pan and pour the sauce over them and bake for about 30 to 40 min depending on the size of the meatballs. Everybody asks for them when I say what can I bring. I have been making them for probably 40 years.

Instead of beef I used 2 kilogram of turkey mince. The cranberry y sauce (which I hadn't used before) added to the flavour.  Used chopped garlic and added chopped jalapeño chillies instead of chilli sauce.

These cute little balls were a hit! I took this and the fruit salsa to a baby shower and was thoroughly enjoyed by all! I took my time and had to make a few teeny tweaks to get the sauce just right. The original recipe calls for a slightly sweet taste, and I added pinches of salt until it was perfectly balanced. (for my crowd, anyway)  I made them fully cooked at home, and brought them to the hostess' house in a crockpot to keep warm for the duration of the party. When I tell you that EVERYONE (including the lady of the hour's husband) was raving over these meatballs, I tell you no lie. They absolutely devoured these and wanted the recipe! I told them all that I got it here, so hopefully they'll try to make it instead of keep asking me to make them again. (Be prepared for that) Great appetizer or meal if you were to make them bigger and in larger quantity. (Hmm, I may do that next week). Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I don't consider myself a fabulous cook but I do like try new things and although I've tasted this sort of dish a few times in the past, I really liked mine the best. I read the reviews before making this recipe, I took some ideas while others I ignored. For example, one suggestion was doubling up on all the ingredients if using a whole can of jellied cranberry sauce. Sooo glad I did that, it was awesome. Another was to make the sauce the night before but I just didn't have enough time so I simmered it longer to really get the juices in there. Since it WAS so last minute, I had to make due with what I had on hand. One person wrote never to use frozen Italian meatballs as the sauce doesn't mix well with the spices. I took a chance - it's what I had in the freezer and again, so glad I did. I thought the mixture was terrific and they really complimented each other. Please be advised that person only cooked their meatballs in the sauce for about an hour. I left mine in the crock pot on low heat for about 4 hours, I thought they were perfect. Maybe the slow simmer really mixed it up, not sure, remember...amateur level here!

Made exactly as listed except I added 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning  to the plain bread crumbs. Favors worked fine. I mixed the meat combo up the day before and made them into meatballs. I also mixed the sauce up the day before and put it in the crockpot in the refrigerator. The morning of my lunch need, I put the crockpot with sauce on low for 45 minutes and baked the meatballs for 23 minutes turning once at about 10 minutes. I put the meatballs in the crockpot sauce on low for 1.5 hrs and then warm to serve. Meatballs need to be baked to solidify and make sure they are thoroughly cooked through. They did not shred in the sauce this way.  I made 60 (2lbs of 90% ground beef) for a pass a dish. They were gone quickly as people went back for more after they tried them. No grease when they were baked. Just a nice mild appetizer.

I doubled the meatball portion as I had 1 kg of ground sirloin, 2 eggs, omitted water, 1/2 cup bread crumbs and a small onion grated, I also added seasonings 1 tsp pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. I used my #50 scoop, it yielded 36 meatballs, baked in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes. For the sauce I kept the measurement as is, I wish I hadn't added the brown sugar as it was too sweet, so I added more lemon juice. I baked in a low oven 250 degrees for 2 hours, very good.

The meatballs were a big hit.  Everybody loved the flavor.  I followed echen2000 advice about doubling the other ingredients if using a whole can of jellied cranberry sauce.  Delicious!!

Very good......Hugh Hit! Only change I made was using ground beef and pork. And since it was around Christmas time, I also used home made cranberry sauce. 
There were out of this world, no left overs!

Prepared 4pounds of ground beef and froze them. When guests arrived they just had to be heated in the sauce and served. Excellent sauce ! 
Because of their size they reheat quickly. I also tried bottled sauce, sweet n sour, ginger orange etc. In a pot on the stove top. Simmer for about 10 min.

This could have used more seasoning in the meatballs like garlic and maybe ginger.  The sauce could have used less cranberry sauce or eliminated completely and substituted with grape jelly.  Maybe ketchup would have worked better instead of chili sauce. The chili sauce was a wasted ingredient. It was just a slightly different version of ketchup but less sweet. I don't understand how this got such great ratings. I won't be making this again.

I probably made two mistakes. I used frozen meatballs and to make it worst I used the Italian version which one reviewer intensely advised against. She was right. But I think also that frozen meatballs are yucky ... I will make again but I will make the meatballs myself. So much for being lazy.

These little meatballs are amazing! They're also very easy to make.  I baked them for the full 25 minutes, which made them just a little crispy.  The sauce was delicious too!  I will definitely make these again!!  Everyone loved them.

Everyone loved it, with the cranberry sauce and chili sauce it had a BBQ kind of flavor.   I used to make the cocktail sauce with grape jelly but due to guests who can't eat grapes I used this one instead, I think this one is better.

I'm giving it at least a 4 star because I messed up on the recipe. LOL  I used Siracha Chili Sauce because I had no clue where to find just plain old chili sauce (In the condiments section, duh!) and was in the Mexican/Asian cuisine isle when I was looking for it and that was the only thing that looked like what the recipe called for.  So, I goofed and knowing that it was going to be uber hot (because I love siracha honey hotwings but not the burn) didn't actually try them myself, but the guys (who all love spicy spicy stuff) gave  my goof a thumbs-up, so that's a plus!   I'll have to try it again using regular chili sauce and I'm sure it will be fab!

I made this with prepared meatballs, Heinz chili sauce and Ocean Spray cranberry jelly and we were completely disappointed when is tasted very ketchupy!

I added fish sauce and french onion soup mix to the sauce, which improved it.  We will not be making this one again.

Excellent! I didn't have any chili sauce, so used a recipe found on this site. Plus, I only had whole berry cranberry sauce, which I used. Made the meatballs from scratch, and they were great! After simmering in the sauce, they were out of this world! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Its okay. I've made it a few times as like a thoughtless party platter and people have always liked it, so its not like its a bad dish!  And i always follow the directions, I dont use frozen meatballs or anything. Its just kinda whatever for my taste. But like i said everyone seems to like it, its just not what theyre gonna be talking about tomorrow morning if you get what I'm saying.

I've been making this for decades and it's always a crowd-pleaser at cocktail parties, showers, game parties and pot-lucks. When I make the meatballs from scratch I often add fresh parsley or thyme, depending on my mood.  When I'm in a rush, I forego making the meatballs and use high-quality, frozen store-bought ones -- baked in the oven according to package directions. The beauty of that is that by the time you assemble and cook the sauce, the meatballs are ready to be fired into the sauce. 
I agree with other reviewers that if a full can of cranberry sauce is used, this recipe makes more sauce than is necessary. Definitely double up the meatballs -- they won't go to waste!

These were served at a Veterans' meeting and seemed to be liked by all.  I used a full packet of McCormick Roasted garlic chili sauce and added a generous squirt of Sriracha to give this just a little kick.  The next time I make this I'll make the same additions and probably add three or four cloves of garlic.
I'll use this recipe the next time I make spaghetti.

These were great! The only change I made is using milk instead of water in the meatballs. I baked in the oven for 15 min, then heated them in the crockpot with the sauce. I accidentally bought jellied cran-raspberry sauce instead of plain cranberry, but it still tasted great. I made a double batch of the meatballs, then froze them so I can easily make these again on New Years Eve.

I have almost the same recipe, but instead of cranberry sauce, I use grape jelly. They are very similar, but I like the grape jelly because it is a touch sweeter. Either way, though, they get eaten up very fast.

Fabulous!!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked the meatballs on the rack over a cookie sheet and they came out great.

Update - I brought these to a party that the hostess had a high end caterer do the food and these meatballs were the hit of the party.

These were amazingly delicious.  I did add a little more brown sugar than called for.  Maybe next time , I will not use as much lemon juice.  Rave reviews from many of my guests.

I made these for a party and they were all gone immediately! I added a little liquid smoke and used frozen meatballs and it was excellent. Will definitely make again. The only issue I had is that they definitely had a "ketchup" taste to them.

These were so good and my party guests devoured them and asked for more!  I wish I had made my own meatballs, I had no time, but that sauce made up for a frozen pre-made product.  I had some fresh garlic on hand so I threw in about a teaspoon and 2 tablespoons of a sweet 3 pepper sauce I was serving separately and all I can say is Wow.  I also ran out of time and threw the frozen pre-cooked meatballs with sauce on the oven for 20 minutes and voila!  Done.  Thank you for a delicious recipe.

These are fantastic!  We hosted a large party recently and I made a double batch of these.  Oh so very good, and pretty simple as well.  I will most certainly be making these again.  The only thing I did differently was use 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork, but I'm sure they'd be good no matter what meat you use.  Oh, and I didn't turn the meatballs over in the middle of cooking, either.  With so many of them I just thought that would take forever and didn't want to take the time since we had so much other food to prepare.  They did have a slightly flattish spot that was browner than the rest of the ball, but really a non-issue.

I got 51 meatballs out of this recipe, which was a good amount. I didn't think they were very tasty, needs more spices.  I also prefer the grape jelly sauce over the cranberry type sauce. This is the second cranberry type sauce I have tried, the other was about the same but had brown sugar added and I didn't care for that one either compared to the grape jelly version.  I will not use this again and go back to my graoe jelly sauce recipe and find another recipe for meatballs.

These were very good.  I did adjust the recipe.  Added onion powder, garlic to the ground beef to flavor up the meatballs.  We have used this same sauce with Kielbasa.  Very good with Kielbasa as well.

I made the meatballs using lipton onion soup mix and i cooked them on a cooling rack so that the meatballs would not sit and cook in the grease.  They were good, but the sauce was not that great.  It was pretty thin and did not seem to stay on the meatballs very well. If I try this recipe again I will make the sauce in a sauce pan and thicken up the sauce just a little before putting with the meatballs.  I may also add some red chili flakes as the chili sauce (heitz) did nothing for this recipe.  It lacked the kick I was hoping for.

Delish! At the suggestions of others, used Lipton's Beef Onion Soup (doubled the meat as the onion mix calls for 2 lbs.) and Frank's Hot Sweet Chili Sauce. Also used two eggs, a combo of milk and water along with the bread crumbs. Very flavorful. The batch made 50 bite-size pieces.

I have never been asked for a recipe as much as this one.  These were a total hit.  I had lots to prepare for a party, so I did take a shortcut like some others here, and bought pre-made meatballs.  Had these on my party table in a crockpot all night and my guests loved them.  Nice that something so easy can be so great.  :-)

I made these for a holiday party and they were a huge hit. I used frozen turkey instead of beef and it wasn't until I started making batch #2 in front of my guests that they realized that the balls were NOT beef! I received lots of requests for the recipe and have been been sharing all morning.

The sauce was very good. I followed some other reviewers advice and used frozen original flavored  appetizer sized meatballs. It was a big bag and it was gone by the end of the night, Out of curiosity, next time I'll try it from scratch since that's what I'm used to. Thanks for the recipe!

These are always a huge hit at parties!  I served them at my parents 50th Wedding Anniversary party and will be having them again for my 50th Birthday party! I have made the meatballs as directed and I have used prepackaged frozen cocktail meatballs. I love the sauce! It's an inexpensive appetizer and I'm always asked for the recipe.

I made this last year for Super Bowl, and it was a big hit.  Several friends commented on how good they were.  One said he didn't know I had made them (assumed my wife did), and wouldn't have tried them had he known, but he loved them.

I thought they were very tasty but way too spicy.  Maybe I used the wrong chili sauce.  I used sriracha. I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar and they weren't too sweet.

The recipe as-is was just okay. The second time around I used panko bread crumbs, added garlic to the minced onions, and added salt, black pepper, thyme and red pepper flakes to the mixture. Then, I let it all sit overnight in the fridge. I added some cranberry pepper jelly I had on hand to the sauce mixture, a couple tbs of BBQ sauce, and sriracha. The next morning I baked the meatballs for about 10 minutes before throwing everything in the crockpot. Delicious!

The cocktail meatballs tasted more like regular spaghetti and meatballs. The cranberry sauce flavor was lost among the heavy chili sauce. My family said they liked these, but asked if I would make some spaghetti so they can have it with the meatballs for tomorrow's dinner. I will make the old stand by with grape jelly the next time. I enjoyed making my own meatballs instead of using the frozen kind.

This recipe was awesome.  For the chili sauce I used Franks RedHot Original.  Everyone raved about them.

Ridiculously good! Just enough spice, and very tasty.  I made them for a NYE party and was nervous when I tasted the sauce before it simmered in the crock pot because it tasted kind of funny, but it was great after it cooked with the meatballs. I used ground turkey, and since it came as 1.25 pounds I just upped all the other ingredients a little, which was good because I was able to use the whole can of jellied cranberry.

These meatballs were a big hit at a recent Christmas Party that we attended. It's a quick and easy recipe to make, which I love. I was pleasantly surprised at how many meatballs, 1 lb of ground beef made up. I just had a couple left over and heated them up with mashed potatoes the following day. Yummy!!

Love the recipe...the second time I made them I added a little bit of molasses, about 1/2 a tablespoon. This time I made them for myself and froze the left overs.  The meatballs freeze well and reheat nicely.  I reheat them in the oven 300F  for about 20 15 minutes.

I found the meatballs to be a bit bland.  The sauce was good, but its not enough to make up for the blandness of the meatballs.

I made these for my 11 year old's birthday party.  I reduced the chili sauce to 1/2 cup so that it wouldn't be to hot for the kids.  Everybody loved them.

I followed the recipe to make the meatballs, except I added salt and pepper, as well as cooked them at a little higher temp.... 400 degrees.  I was worried they would loose their shape, between turning them and adding them to the crock-pot.  They held together just fine.  I also used a 14oz can of whole berry cranberry sauce, and it turned out great.  I did use just a little extra brown sugar and chilli sauce.  I used sriracha sauce and the flavor was great.

Just made these....I used a mixture of pork and beef because I prefer my meatballs that way. The sauce was good but beware the type of Chile sauce that you use. All I had on hand was Thai Sweet Chili sauce and I doubled the amount of lemon juice to compensate for the sweetness which worked well. I think I prefer the S & S meatball recipe using grape jelly instead of cranberry though. There are so many variations, you really just need to find the one for your tastes!

Maybe I'm just too much of a savory/spicy person, but the sauce was just way too sweet for me.  I might try it again, leaving out the brown sugar and see how that effects the sweetness level.  The meatballs were very easy and very tasty on their own, so that part of the recipe is a keeper as is!

Tender, tasty and wonderful for guests!  I did find that you need to cook them on a very low heat or the sauce will start to burn and they will become very bitter.  All in all, as long as you don't overcook, these are excellent!

Made for an office potluck.  These were OK and tasted just exactly as I would have expected them to. They were almost gone at the end of the day.  Quite sweet, so having made my own meatballs instead of using frozen probably wasn't necessary.  I added a package of Nathan's mini wieners for a little variety.  I doubt I'll make them again.

This is so simple to make, and tastes fantastic! It is very similar to a recipe that was my Mom's go-to recipe for potluck parties, but she used to use onion soup mix for the meatballs, which I can't find in England. This tastes almost the same, and it's so nice to have home comforts. I have made this today for a potluck party, too! I used a jar of tomato and chilli sauce in place of the chili sauce, though, as it's what I had on hand. Thank you for this recipe.

I tried this recipe for a family Sunday gathering and I was disappointed. Possibly the let-down was due to the "chili sauce" that I used. I do not know quite what is meant by that description. There was only one item available at my supermarket which had those words in the title. It was nothing we ordinarily eat and I didn't think it combined well with the flavors, too flat and dry. Although I am in the market for a new and different meatball recipe, this one is not it.

Totally wonderful and easy recipe! I omitted the breacrumbs and added an extra egg when making the meatballs, because one of our guest is gluten intolerant. The meatballs stayed together wonderfully. I will be added this recipe to my "go to" list. Thanks!

Pretty good recipe--I just made the meatballs, not the sauce because I had some fancy sauce I bought at a craft fair that I wanted to use.  The meatballs themselves were pretty good, though I think another seasoning like sage might zest them up a bit.  I'll probably make these again.

Meatballs alone were tasty and I'll make them again and freeze some; however, the sauce made them taste like little meatloaf balls.  I was extremely disappointed and won't ever make the sauce again.  The reason I made it was because of the huge positive responses.  I was a little embarrassed to serve them.

I made a large crockpot of these for a birthday party. Thinking I made to much, by the end of the day there was about 6 meatballs left. and I cooked 4lbs!! Everyone though they almost tasted like BBQ Sauce. They were a hit! I will be making them for every party I attend now.

This is really good, I cook the meatballs on my roasting pan.  That way the fat in the meat can drain.

Hands down the best cocktail meatballs ever!  Just the right amount of tangy/sweet.  I've always found the grape jelly ones too sweet.

Can't quite put my finger on it but I was disappointed. I increased the servings to 20 for a party and followed the recipe exactly (sauce). Everyone else at the party said they were great. I used a very good and reliable frozen beef meatball and they were fine. I heated them in the oven first and then put them in a crockpot. Perhaps it was the tartness of the cranberry?? I'd only every had the old grape jelly combo before so it must just be my palate. There are plenty of rave reviews here.

For New Year's Eve I decided I wanted real meatballs...not the frozen ones that usually doesnt taste like real meat. I tried this recipe and everyone absolutely  loved them. Now I have been assigned to bring them to every function. They were delicious!

These were ok, but not exactly what I expected.  I wanted a sweet meatball, but to me these were more tangy than sweet.  I'm not sure if it was the lemon or if it was the choice of cranberry sauce I used.I would have been better off just using a bottle of BBQ sauce.

These were a hit with my family. I did use 2lbs. of hamburger as other reviewers said they didn't go far. I didn't like the chili sauce I used- Heinz- and need to try something else. It was not hot as others had said (probably because of the sauce I chose to use), so I added Sriracha Hot Sauce and this really made the dish!

Great recipe.  I added about a 1/2 tsp. - 1 tsp. of garlic powder to give them more flavor.  I also didn't use the sauce with the recipe.  I used teriyaki sauce for half of them and used barbecue sauce for the other half.

I made these for a family get together and my father-in-law loved them, who is a very hard person to impress with food. I don't really care for onions, but they really went well in these. I will make these again, but will probably double the recipe so they don't go so fast.

I thought these tasted ok but they were a huge hit with everyone else so I'll give it 5 stars.  I made it for about 15 people and everyone LOVED and RAVED about them.  I used frozen meatballs and followed the sauce recipe exactly.  I'll make them again since everyone likes them so much.

Kids loved these.  I used frozen meatballs but they were a little too big.  Next time I'll make fresh so the kids can eat the with toothpicks for more fun.  Anyone have a favorite chili sauce brand?  Mine tasted a little too much like catsup.

When I'm lazy and need something to take to a party, this is the recipe I use.  I normally brown the meatballs in a skillet and then toss it all in a crockpot.  Super easy and delicious!

Im sorry, but the meatballs tasted like just plain hambuger meat. I recomend adding grape jelly instead of cranberry sauce.

These are good and easy but really need some salt in the beef mixture. Will make again with some salt!

This was a wonderful recipe! I loved the tanginess of it more so than the grape jelly kind, and I was surprised by that. By the way, I did use frozen Italian meatballs because my friend brought the wrong kind over, but I used them anyway because it was too late, and they were still a rave with everyone at work!! Also, I ended up using more like a full bottle of the chili sauce, but I like a lot of sauce!

Just as others have said- these are fantastic. They will become a regular for New Years because there really is no better way to use up leftover cranberry sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly (doubled it, though) and took the meatballs to a church potluck.  I brought home an empty serving dish.  Enough said.

These were really that good.  Make extra.  Double it.  Triple it.   Throw it in the freezer.  It's amazing how fast they go.  It is really quick to eat. Especially if it's at a Super Bowl party. Or if u plan on having people drinking. I think it is mainly the sauce that makes people gobble them up. I followed the recipe to a tee ad it came out delicious.  I don't think it would be that bad with the frozen meatballs.  Just make sure u thaw them out well. Great recipe though. Great party munch...and munch...and munch.

They were delicious!  But, if you make this recipe do not leave the crock-pot on overnight (unless on warm) as the sauce burns fairly easily.  I made my meatballs a bit too large, figuring they would cook down, but didn't much.  The sauce is sweet!  And put the meatballs on a wire rack over a pan in the oven...a lot of grease was avoided.  Overall really, really good!

This worked out great. I went with what others did and just use frozen meatballs. Also put little smokys in there and then just used the sauce.. much better than just bar b q sauce. The sauce is great.. although I didnt follow the recipe exactly.  If anyone cares I didnt do much differently I just used the ingredients in the size of packages that they came in. I used a 14 oz can of cranberry sauce. 1 12 ounce bottle of chilli sauce then I just used a regular tablespoon mounded over of brown sugar and squeezed lemon juice into.. probably a tbsp or so.  They went fast.. I have a big crock pot and it was practically full and they all got eaten by the 6 people that were here today in just a couple of hours.

I've tried the grape jelly and chili sauce combo and everyone thought it just had an odd taste, but this is absolutely fantastic. The combination of the cranberry sauce and chili sauce is awesome.  I followed another reviewers advice and used a package of onion soup mix, a handful of bread crumbs, tsp. of worcheshire sauce and baked them for approx. 12 minutes at approx. 400 deg.  I let them cool, then froze them.  Just one less thing to do before my cocktail party.  On the day of - heated the chili sauce mixture (this I followed exactly including the lemon juice and brown sugar) in a saucepan, put my frozen meat balls also in the sauce pan, gave it a quick stir to get them evenly coated and poured into my slow cooker to finish heating and glazing.  Thank you very much Lara for sharing this recipe.  No more grape junk ever again!!!!

These weren't spectacular.  I followed the recipe pretty exactly but they were terribly bland (the sauce and the meatballs) so I found myself throwing random ingredients in to try to fix them. I ended up not serving these to my guests because they were just too bland.

I made the meatballs with ground turkey and they were delicious!  My husband thought it was a little too sweet.  Next time, I will leave out the brown sugar and see if that reduces the sweetness a little.  I love garlic, so I also added 1 tbsp fresh chopped garlic to the meatballs.

My husband and older daughter liked it but I and my younger daughter really weren't pleased with this recipe. I used "Chili Sauce" from AR to replace the bottled stuff. Also after tasting the final product, I added about 1/2 cup of apricot preserve to make the sauce sweeter. Served over rice.

Just so-so for us.  As others have said, the meatballs alone are bland.  To me, the sauce is really lacking flavor.  I'm not sure what it needs, but the combo of the two is really unexciting.  Probably will not make again.

Sensational.  I have yet to serve these to guests (they're coming tomorrow), but my husband and I tried a couple of these and we love them.  He could not find regular chile sauce at our grocery store, so he came home with chile/garlic and it was rather good.  I made the recipe as quoted, put the meatballs in their sauce in a casserole dish into the fridge and plan to reheat in the oven.  I'm looking forward to hearing what my guests have to say.  Excellent recipe for cocktail/appetizer party.

Even easier - use frozen meatballs (4 lbs) , bake them a bit to brown and get rid of some grease, add 1 12oz jar chili sauce (heinz) and 1 16 oz cranberry sauce jellied.  YUM!

These were easy to make and my family liked them very well. The measurements are a little awkward because you use 2/3 of a can of canberry sauce, but other than that, the recipe is great. Thanks!

My sauce was increddddibly spicy! I'm Mexican, so I can handle my spice, but wow! I guess my chili sauce was too potent. I am living in Hong Kong and bought a Chinese brand of sauce (not rooster). I had to add a lot more of the cranberry sauce to make it tolerable. Other than THAT ... great!

I cooked these last week.  My husband loved them but I thought they were just okay.  I know it's probably a mental thing with me, but I couldn't get over the cranberry taste on the meat.  I am not a fan of having sweetened sauces on my meat, but because I like the grape jelly meatball recipe I thought I'd give this one a try.  I added some seasoning salt, garlic powder and onion powder to my meat mixture and I felt everything tasted good.  But I just couldn't get over the cranberry sauce.  I will probably cook this again but use less cranberry sauce.

A friend gave us a bunch of ground venison, which I don't like.  But, this recipe made it fabulous!  I've tried it since with ground beef and will make it for years to come.  It's also good as an entre served over steamed rice.  The cranberry flavor just rocks.

I've used this recipe on several occasions - New Year's Eve, Housewarming party and other parties - and I've never received anything but compliments for it.   As cranberrry jelly is quite hard to find in Norway, I've substituted it with redcurrant jelly on one occasion, and raspberry jam on others - and never had anyone guess the difference.   Big thumbs up - and it is definitely something to keep on bringing along to parties and potlucks.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I used frozen meatballs to save time but followed the recipe to the T. I don't know what kind of chili sauce the recipe writer had in mind but the one that I used was quite spicy leading some of our guest to complain that they were hot but that didn't stop them from eating more until they emptied the crockpot! Will definately be making these again.

Thank you for this recipe! I originally made these for a summer barbecue and they were a HIT! I've made them three times now, and each time they've been delicious. I follow the recipe exactly, though I don't think they need a full hour to simmer on the stove. Be sure to chop the onions very fine, or use shallots for a more mild flavor. I'd like to try using panko breadcrumbs next time.

FANTASTIC! I can only rate the sauce as I used Trader Joe's pre-made meatballs, which I also recommend. I added 2+ tablespoons of hot sauce to the sauce and it was amazing! These were even better the second day.

These meatballs are surprisingly delicious! As we warmed the sauce, my initial doubts grew! Cranberry and chili did not seem a perfect pair. I was wrong! I used Sam's Club Italian style frozen meatballs...(was preparing tons of food for my daughter's birthday party and needed to save time somewhere.) After baking the meatballs for 25 minutes, I added them and the sauce to an already warm crockpot. Very tasty! A recipe that I would surely use again.

Ok, I'm not a big meatball appetizer fan, but these are so good!!  I used frozen meatballs from Costco, put all the stuff in a crockpot, the meatballs were frozen, on high for about 3 hours.  Stirred occassionaly.  I cooked them for a work party...they could not get enough of them.

This recipe turned out very well for me.  I followed the ingredients listed but changed the cooking method a little bit.  I broiled the meatballs for about 10 minutes.  I was cooking this dish in my slow cooker so I combined the sauce on the stove in a saucepan.  I put everything in the slow cooker on low for about 5 hours.  I also doubled the sauce because I like lots, and this way I didn't waste any of the cranberry, as it comes in 16 ounce cans.

Be sure that the meatballs are very well seasoned.  I thought they were a bit bland. not a total hit at the party. I prefer the grape jelly recipe.

Served these @ 2008 Christmas Eve party.  Someone else brought meatballs and these went first with many compliments.  I doubled the recipe, used one packet of onion soup mix instead of the chpd onion. Made meatballs the night before. Heated and served in a crockpot the next day.

These were excellent.  The only changes I made was I used lime juice instead of lemon (I had no lemon juice and the store was completely out) and I accidentally added a bit more cranberry sauce than the recipe calls for.  I also used 1/2 t. onion powder in the meatballs rather than onions just due to personal perference.  Will definately make again!

This recipe is pretty good, and if you use Siracha it's quite spicy. The problem is the jellied cranberry sauce is way too sweet, and there is not reason to add the extra brown sugar  12/19/2008 YUM!

It always amazes me that the most simple dishes I bring to an event are always the ones that get the rave reviews.  I dumb this recipe down even more with the store-bought turkey meatballs.....I always bring home an empty dish!

I had high expectations for this recipe and they weren't what I thought. The meatballs themselves were very good but the sauce tasted like meatloaf to me. That's not what I expected.

these meatballs were ok.  I think they were too sweet.  My guests said they were good but not many disapeared from the table.  My italian friends thought the sauce was tomato and was expecting italian style meatballs which didn't go over very well.  Sorry despite all the rave reviews these were just ok

I made these for dinner for my family and they were superb! I accidentally put Extra Hot Chili sauce in and didn't notice until it was too late to fix it. The meatballs came out good but very spicy, but I could tell they would be 5 star worthy if I put in mild chili sauce.
Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!

AWESOME. Made this for a football party and they were a HIT. Only thing you might want to make a note of. DOUBLE or Triple the whole sauce recipe. I made 32 meatballs and needed more sauce to coat them nicely in. ( I cheated and used frozen meatballs)

I made these for my son's 4th birthday party.  They we're a hit with the young and the old.   I unfortunately didn't have the chili sauce when I went to make it so I substituted honey garlic sauce for the chili; it was fabulous!!  So yummy!

I'm not sure what I missed in this recipe.  The chili sauce was really really hot, maybe I should have used milder one.  What did other people use for the chili sauce.  I couldn't really taste even the cranberry sauce.  I used lime juice instead of lemon but couldn't taste the lemon either.  I don't think I'll make these again.

To save time, I used store-bough meatballs, but put them in the crock pot with the sauce from this recipe. I didn't have brown sugar, so I used a little white sugar instead. The sauce was great - a nice little change from the standard bbq sauce and grape jelly mixture.

This recipe was pretty good. I was a little afraid of the taste, but it was ok. The meatballs were all eaten, which is a good sign. I didn't love the flavor though, so I will probably look for another recipe. It was good, just not great. Very easy to put together though, I tried to find frozen meatballs but couldn't. That would have made it even easier!

These are very easy to make and were quite popular at my party. I made a double batch with half ground pork, half ground beef. They were a hit. I will definitely make these little meatballs again. I told people they were sweet and sour meatballs because that's what they tasted like to me!

Hmmm, I think maybe I did something wrong, I don't know.  I didn't like these at all, and I REALLY didn't like the chili sauce.  I am from Louisiana and like spicy foods but just thought it was TOO spicy in a weird way.

I made these last night for a party and they were delicious.  I cheated for the sake of time and used frozen meatballs, but I made the sauce just as the recipe called for and it turned out very well. I took Jenn's suggestion and added a splash of Worcestire, but it would have been fine without it, too.  I'm making them again for another party this week. I can't believe something this tasty is so effortless.

Was looking for something for cocktail weiners and thought this would worK. It did! I didn't have lemon juice so I substituted with lemon extract. It was pretty tasty and if I had lemon juice I think it would have been even better. I definitely will try with frozen meatballs and follow the sauce exactly. Great appetizer dish.

This is a very good recipe. Made it for a baby shower and they were eaten up. Works well even if you make the meatballs ahead of time. I had to make mine 2 days ahead of time. I kept them in the freezer till the day of the party and then defrosted them right before adding to the crockpot along with the sauce. I'm glad I doubled the recipe though because I barely had any left and mine was for a party of 11 and the recipe says it serves 10.

These were great meatballs--maybe just a tad sweet for my liking, but very good!  Cutting out the brown sugar may help with that.

Great recipe w/slight modifications: added worchestershire, garlic, salt and pepper to meat mixture for added flavor (what's the point of making home made meatballs if they're bland, right?).  To the sauce:  added a little mustard which gave a little zing to round out the sweetness.  Also added a little BBQ sauce for extra depth in flavor. Would've added some cayenne, but I'm feeding young children.

Good, seemed to be a hit.  Was out of minced onion, so used 1/4 cup of fresh onion, and added a little onion salt. Also used 1 1/2 lbs ground sirloin, added some worstershire sauce, and a little meatloaf seasoning.  Used 2 eggs, whole jar of chili sauce, whole can of cranberry sauce, and added a little extra lemon juice.  Next time will simmer longer before serving.

I've made these twice now for large parties and followed the recipe exactly each time (for both the meatballs and the sauce).  I thought the texture of the meatballs was very good -- not too hard or rubbery.  I totally disagree with reviewers who claim the sauce was spicy.  I didn't thing this was the case at all; in fact they were sweet and tangy.  While I thought the overall dish was decent, I've never received a compliment or request for the recipe.  At the end of the party there were more left in the pot than gone.  Perhaps I just had too much other food.  As a result, I think I'll keep looking for the perfect cocktail meatball recipe.

These were really easy to prepare and tasted really good.  My boyfriend liked them alot especially because the meatballs were homemade.  I threw a few lil' smokies in with them because I had extra from another recipe.  The sauce was good with both.  Thanks.

I made a practice batch of these this weekend since I wanted to make sure they were good before I served them at Christmas.  It was excellent.  I used ground turkey and only 1 TB of minced onion which I thought was plenty.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I must admit, I was a little hesitant to try this because of the cranberry and chili sauce combination.  It turned out to be a big hit.  I made it for a party and everyone loved them.  It was great not worrying about keeping them warm since they were kept right in the crock pot!

I've been making this recipe for years, as one person mentioned I also use cornflakes in place of breadcrumbs. A favorite of mine and many of my friends. My husband surprisingly isn't real fond of the sauce, he prefers BBQ sauce or the old standby of Ketchup and Grape Jelly.

Loved these little morsels!  I used ground turkey instead of beef so should have baked a shorter time but after soaking in the sauce they were very tasty even if a bit too hard.  I was afraid they would be too lemony but the lemon juice melds with the other flavors as the sauce simmers.  I would have added more chili as others reviewers mentioned but my kids would have protested - even without the extra kick they were full of flavor.  A definite winner as an appetizer or a meal!

I used corn flakes instead of bread crumbs, left out the onion, and just dropped 'em right into the simmering suace (which I doubled, to use all the chili & cranberry up).  They were fab.

these were okay. the chili and cranberry sauce mixture is sort of odd. had a funny smell to it. they did taste pretty good though. next time i think i will make my own chili sauce instead of buying the bottled stuff to make the sauce taste less store-bought. didn't find the lemon added much. think i will add less cranberry sauce too. found it too sweet for my taste. but this recipe is a good base to start with.

These were a big hit at my recent get together.  They were super easy to make and it was nice to prepare them and put them in the slow cooker unti the guests arrived.  Will definitely make again.

I think there was too much minced onion in these. I would decrease that amt next time. Also, there was not enough sauce to cover all of the meatballs. Overall these were OK. I do have better cocktail meatball recipes I will probably stick to.

If you're in a hurry, just buy packaged meatballs and they turn out great.  The sauce is what makes it!

Very good.  I also used the frozen meatballs to save on time.  The sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but we all thought they were delicious.  Will serve again.

Just delicious....served this wonderful dish just a few days ago for New Year's Eve.  I doubled the recipe and made some slight modifications - used 1 can of regular cranberry sauce and 1 can of cranberry/clementine sauce...also added my own homemade chili sauce instead of the canned variety. I also added green onions to the meat before cooking.  Suberb...thanks....

Served these on my New Years Eve buffet. Absolutely wonderful!! I use 2 packages frozen meatballs to cut down on prep time and doubled the sauce.  Prepared them in the crock pot, simmered on low for about 3 hrs. Also added a package of little cocktail smokies. There was plenty of sauce for all the "bites" They ate them all and declared them "the best". Will absolutely make them again.

Won't try these again.  The meatballs alone were boring and dry.  Liked the idea of cranberry sauce in the sauce, but didn't care for it.

WOW!  This one is a real winner!  I used frozen meatballs and put them in but the sauce is to die for.  People at my party were almost fighting over who was going to take home the extra sauce I made.  Great recipe!

I must say that I was skeptical about this recipe because of the cranberry sauce, but you know, it was really good! I made them for a holiday party, and everyone said they were great. I have had some better tasting ones in the past, so I am still on the hunt to find a FABULOUS meatball recipe. Thanks a lot. I will use this one again.

A little too sweet for my taste.  I would omit the brown sugar, as adviced by others. I might add a little more spice with hot sauce.  Others, however,seem to really love the meatballs.

This was pretty good but I was expecting the meatballs to taste like the ones that people always serve at parties in the crockpot, they are good but just completely different than what I expected. I used heitz cocktail sauce since the recipe didn't specify.

all I can say WAY WAY WAY TOO HOT!!!!! I think in this recipe it needs to be specifed not to use HOT chile sauce.  I love hot food but these are not even edible.  My boyfriend just tryed one and ran around the house with his mouth on fire. I dont see how kids could eat these!  I guess i should of used a different kind of chile sauce.  However im not to sure what kind to use!! Well sorry for the bad review but not too sure what to think! Merry Chritamas to everyone!

These were okay!  I don't think that I will make them again.  My husband ate them but said they weren't the best ones that he had eaten.  It was very disappointing after waiting so long for them to be ready to eat.

I made these for a party, and though I followed the recipe to a T, they were a bit too spicy for me.  My guests liked them, but everyone commented on how spicy they were, and I would not make them again with the same proportion of ingredients.

I had to give this recipe 4 stars to be fair. Before I go any further, let me say, I will NOT be making these again. Simply because they just didn't *stand out* in my opinion and they gave me a tummy ache right off the bat. Now, with the bad out of the way ~ here's why I gave the recipe 4 stars. The meatball, itself, was perfect. They baked nicely and held good form. The amount of sauce was perfect and it simmered down nicely in the crockpot. So, this is a really good recipe ~ but, not as good as several others I use and something in the ingreds (cranberry sauce, maybe) didn't agree with me.

Good recipe, but wasn't everything I expected. I added more chili sauce to give it more of a kick. You may want to give the meatballs more oven time depending on how big you make them, otherwise they might not cook all the way through and still remain pink in the middle. You can also top it with shredded mozzerella before serving.

This recipe was a HUGE hit at our New Years eve party!!!  I used the pre-made meatballs and let them thaw then threw them in the crock pot and an hour later my guests were raving about them!!  Thanks for sharing!

I thought the ingedients sounded odd, but I tried them anyway for a tree trimming party.  Everyone loved them and my brother wants me to make them again for New years Eve!  The only thing I changed was using my own meatball recipe.
