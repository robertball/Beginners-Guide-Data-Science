I combined this recipe with another one and I just love this salad!!!  These are the things I did different: used red and yellow peppers, used thin sliced red onion instead of the green onion, added capers, and the dressing was olive oil, minced garlic, dijon mustard, champagne vinegar...salt/pepper. I also toasted the bread cubes in olive oil in a fying pan ontop of the stove. Wow...what a great tasting salad!! Used lots of chopped basil, too! Adds a ton of freshness. I made this with grilled Italian sausage and "Zucchini Patties" from this site. Definately a keeper!

Wonderful!!  I would only make this salad when very ripe tomatoes and fresh basil are available.  We went to the farmer's market and purchased the ingredients and took it to a pitch in.  A great success!  The bread soaks up and holds the delicious juices from the tomatoes and seasonings. Yummy

This was a HIT!  I sprayed the bread crumbs with Garlic flavored cooking spray before baking.  Worked like a charm.

This was great. I used thin slices of red onion
instead of the scallions, and I sauteed the bread
cubes in olive oil and a little salt. They were
delicious like that. I served them warm over 
the salad, and then just used a red wine vinegar
and olive oil dressing.

Excellent way to use up fresh vegetables from the garden. It was a huge hit in my home and will become a summer staple. Very versatile.

Ok, but nothing special.  There are many other recipes that use herbs, & vegetables that are better.  We won't make this again.

Made this in the summer with some fresh veggies from my garden.  Can't wait to make this one again.  Bit of advise though. I found that adding bread crumbs as it is served works much better and makes leftovers more desireable. Was a great recipe.

We made a few changes over the course of making this salad several times... add a bit of basalmic vinegar to the veggies. I usually only use the peppers if I have them on hand, as this salad was perfect for our garden abundance this summer (basil, tomatoes, cucumbers!)

Wonderful fresh salad.  I used dried parsley and added a couple pinches of salt, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Served as the side to a small deep dish cheese pizza.

I started with these basic ingredients, but liked the version at a local restaurant and I cooked up spicy ground sausage, and added some basamic vinegar to the dressing, and tossed it all together for a warm dinner salad.
