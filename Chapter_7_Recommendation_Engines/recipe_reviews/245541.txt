Way too much bread crumbs for the amount of chicken and cook time was too long.

I added blue cheese a small amount because too much can be overpowering. I also put them in a small crock pot and covered them in the hot sauce on low for 6 hours.

These were great. Great flavor and it was a hit with the family. My brother doesn't like bone in wings so this was great for him. Really easy to put together. After tasting them I went ahead and tossed them in the wing sauce as well just to add a little moisture. But I over baked them. 30 minutes was a bit much for my oven I'd check these at 20

Made these for the first time with ground turkey. Feel like the bread crumbs could be cut back by a 1/3 of a cup. Agreed with checking at 20 mins. in the oven. Tossed with sauce, but difficult holding meatballs together. Will try these again with maybe adding an egg for glue.
