This was definitely an enjoyable salad, though I did back off on the kale- maybe this was written for smaller bunches of kale, but the kind at our grocery store is always in massive bunches!  I also used a whole bell pepper.  This would also be great with mushrooms and red onion added!

It tasted great and definitely different! My home-made dressing dressing would go well with it as well. And I added some feta cheese as well.

1/4 cup olive oil.
2 T. red wine vinegar
bit of salt
1 garlic clove
a dash of tobacco sauce (optional)
Mix well.
