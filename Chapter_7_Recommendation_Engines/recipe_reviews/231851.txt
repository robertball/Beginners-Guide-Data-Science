I pretty much welcome any smoothie that doesn't rely on one berry or another so this one appealed to me. With only plain Greek yogurt on hand, I added vanilla and a little sugar. My mango was cold, and the banana ripe and frozen. I thought the mango flavor could have been a little more bold, but Hubs liked its subtleness.  An overused word to describe this maybe, but we both found it refreshing.

Thie smoothie recipe has been way overlooked.  I find that it is just perfect.  I halved it and it is so easy to remember.  4 ingredients: 1-1-1-1.  Easy to make, easy to remember.  How much better can you get?

Pretty close to perfect!  I used frozen mango so there was almost no effort involved.

This was such an easy, simple, resource-light smoothie! My only complaint is that the way the recipe calls for ingredients, the banana taste really overpowers the rest of the drink. I toned down the bananas (just enough so that I got the creamy consistency but not the overpowering taste) and added mango nectar. OJ would also work wonders. The drink is absolutely divine!

We used 3 bananas, and almond milk but no yoghurt. It was delightful.  My 9 year old helped make it and we shared it out as morning sunshine in a cup. It went down very quickly.

Very good.  Both my mango and banana were frozen. Consequently my smoothie was thick and cold. I loved it!

That was delicious! But as a vegan, I replace regular dairy-products in non-dairy, and added little stevia for sweetener.

Really good recipe.  I used frozen banana, and fresh ripe mango from our tree.  The frozen banana helps the smoothie to be at a cooler temp., which is critical for me when it comes to smoothies.  I did think the banana flavor overwhelms the mango, but it was such a tasty combo that it didn't matter.  Everybody loved it.  :)

I thought this tasted pretty good. It is not real sweet like many smoothies. I would consider this more of a breakfast smoothie with the dairy products. The dairy products also made it more creamy. I used organic vanilla bean yogurt and reduced fat milk. I like my smoothies extra cold, so I made 2 servings and added 2 ice cubes along with the banana being frozen. ty

Delicious!!! I actually used mango Oikois greek yogurt instead of vanilla yogurt, and frozen mangos instead of fresh ones to make the smoothie colder. Would definitely make again!!
