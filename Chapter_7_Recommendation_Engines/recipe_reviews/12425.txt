As another reviewer suggested, I used a chocolate cookie crust with this recipe. All I had on hand was bittersweet chocolate. The flavor and appearance was great! I just couldn't get past the texture.Its me, not the recipe. Sorry, I won't be making this one again.

WOW!  This was the best dessert I have ever made and one of the best I've ever eaten.  It is superb.  Only suggestion is to use a chocolate crumb crust.  A traditonal crust just doesn't suit this pie. This will be a family favorite for years to come.

This dessert was okay but I wish I would have made it in a pan and cut up into squares because it was so much like fudge it was hard to cut into to make pie slices. Not sure if I did something wrong, my boyfriend loved it but I thought it was too hard and not very pie-like.
