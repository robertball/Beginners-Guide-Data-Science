THis is SO GOOD!!!  My mom saw a picture of a lemonade pie (she is suffering with cancer) So I came to my favorite place to find a recipe.  So glad I did! Very simple, and very very good!  However don't make the mistake I did, I used a mixer for my "trial" pie and a mixer simply will not work, Follow the recipe directions and use the blender, makes all the difference. THanks so much for sharing. Mom loved this, and she can eat so little these days, it just made her day.  WIll make over and over again!

I've made this a couple of times and every time it's a hit. I have also used strawberry lemonade concentrate and Bacardi pina colada mix for a delicious twist. Yum. :)

This was great!  I used limeade concentrate instead of the lemonade for more of a key lime pie flavor.  I took it to a party and everyone loved it.  This made enough filling for 2 pies.

Very good and easy to make.  I've made it with lemonade before but this time I decided to try the new Bacardi frozen drink mixes.  I used rum rummer.  It's just the mix....no alcohol included.  It was fantastic.  They also have margarita, mojito, fuzzy navel, and pina colada.  I think they would all taste great.

It doesn't get much easier than this! It's not overly sweet which we liked.  Not all my filling fit into my pie plate/crust, so next time I probably won't put in all the whipped topping. My husband and I enjoyed it, but for some reason the kids didn't, so I'm giving it four stars.

Very good recipe.  I lightened it up using light cream cheese and light sweetened condensed milk.  I also like to change it up a little by adding 3T raspberry preserves to make "Raspberry Lemonade Pie"

Made this twice once with great resluts, once not so great.  I used limeade both times but the second time I bought low fat Cool Whip by mistake and ended up with a runny mess that didn't set up. So I ended up freezing the pie which ended up tasting as great as my first try.  Good thing that I made it the day before I was serving it.  I also added some crushed pretzels to the graham cracker crust I made hoping for a Margarita type pie.  That was a nice chang.

Mmmm.  I had a margarita mix concentrate and used that instead of lemonade.  It was like a lime icebox pie and sooo gone.  Keep it chilled, it gets mushy if set out for more than 15 minutes or so.

I used limeade concentrate instead of the lemonade, and both my fiance and I loved it. Very yummy. I still have some concentrate left over, so I'm planning on making two more. Next time I will use the lower fat versions of everything except the crust and concentrate to help make it lighter, since it has enough flavor and sweetness  from the limeade. Thanks for the recipe!

Recently had a dessert called lemon icebox cake that is a combination of this recipe and vanilla and chocolate delight (also on this website). Honestly, THE best dessert I've ever had. Just replace the "chocolate vanilla layer" with this recipe's lemon filling and then top with whipped topping. You will not be sorry. Promise.

Wow, this was really terrific, did use the limeade instead of lemonade but it was just the best. So easy and so pretty and my family just loved it. Next time I make it, I'll get a photo of it.  I made it just like the directions.  My SL said it was the best Key Lime pie he'd ever had, lol,  I won't tell if you wont :)

Excellent tasting. I used lower fat cream cheese to help lower the calories. Next time if I can find it I will try it with the lower calorie sweetened condensed milk that someone wrote about. Also will try it with limeade.

We make it a lot in the summer as a celebration substitution (think cake/dessert).  It is great when the weather or food is hot.  Needs a some time to thaw before serving.  Great with whip cream.  A favorite of folks who claim not to have a sweet tooth.

Just made this for the 4th and got tons of compliments.  I used Limeade, just because I prefer lime flavor and it was very tasty.  So easy and I especially liked that it was reasonably priced to make.

Tasted like a light, fluffy, lemony cheesecake.  You have to really like lemon to eat this.

I took the suggestion of others and used limeade instead of lemonade.  It is great.  Not too tart - not too sweet.  SOOOOO easy to make.  Will definitely make it again, and again, and again!!!!!!!

I always crave this pie during the hot, humid South Mississippi summer months, and this recipe didn't disappoint! BUT, u better get two graham cracker crusts ready, because this recipe makes enough filling for two pies! For the second pie today I threw in some fresh blueberries for a Blueberry-Lemonade Pie! DELICIOUS & a great mid-summer dessert!

Quick and easy!  This comes together literally in minutes. Very light, and not too sweet. I love lemon, so I add the zest of 1 lemon to the cream cheese mixture, just to bump up the lemon flavor a bit.  Like other reviewers, I had leftover filling as well.  Not a big deal, I just filled up a couple of little cups that I use for pudding, and topped it with some additional whipped cream for a tasty dessert for lunch. Yum!

I made on 12-16-2012 early in the morning, it was a bit sour, and forgot to put it in the freezer I kept it in the refirgerators for two hours.
It fell apart when it came to serve, was soupy and I requested to my friend to freeze the pie.
I will make a green limeade pie with this recepie.
I have a recepie of Chinese Coca-Cola Chicken Wings (Electric Pressure Cooker, it is out of this world, it belongs,  peggyunderpressure.wordpress.com simple. Up coming.

This recipe was wonderful, everyone loved it!  The only change I made was cutting down the whipped topping to about 4 oz... and I served it frozen.  This makes an AMAZING frozen desert!

Made this several times over the summer.  Like others I have tried it with Limeade as well.  Also have used reduced fat cream cheese and light condensed milk to lower the fat content, with no discernable difference in flavor.  It is rich, so small slices will do.  I usually serve it within 5 mins of removing it from the freezer.  It's come out perfect for me everytime.

Although I liked the lemon flavor of this pie, it was so runny that I didn't enjoy it.  I even tried putting it in the freezer for 20min, and it still did not "set."

This was such a quick & easy recipe & really good!  I'm wondering, though, if I was supposed to freeze the pie because I put it in the refrigerator for about 4 hours and it still wasn't quite firm enough.  My husband, who is super-picky and normally only likes chocolate desserts & hates cheesecake, loved this! (I didn't tell him about the cream cheese in the recipe!) I'll definitely make this one again!

Very sweet, but very good. Will definitely make again. I like the cream cheese in it to give it more of a cheesecake taste.

This recipe is yummy & refreshing! Great for spring or summer! Just to let you know...this recipe will make enough for two 9-inch pies, or one 10-inch (but with the 10-inch, you'll probably still have some left over). I had a LOT left over after trying to fill just one 9-inch pie shell as the recipe suggests. Also--the lemonade concentrate comes in 12-oz. cans, so--if you double everything else in the recipe(except the lemonade) you can make 4 pies! I just re-froze the unused portion of the lemonade to use another day!

This recipe is easy, inexpensive, and awesome. I substituted pink lemonade for the lemonade. It would taste wonderful either way though. Everyone loved it!!!!

I made 2 of these in about 1/2 hour, not counting refrigeration time. I served it to my dart team and they just loved it. It will definetly be served again here in this Wisconsin household.

Great to make if have guests coming but not alot of time to prepare a dessert. You can make it in fifteen minutes early in the day and then just pop it in the refrigerator until you need it.

This was a hit at our house, made as directed but added an envelope of gelatine because I used a spring foam pan. Used my ikitchenmaid mixer and topped with raspberries. Delicious!

Didn't make any changes this time. Could use more lemon flavor.  It was good but improvements will be made on next go round.

Such an easy refreshing pie! Don't make the mistake I did of adding a whole can of lemonade concentrate. To fix it, I added another package of cream cheese and another can of sweetened condensed milk and Cool Whip. That seemed to do the trick. I popped the extra filling in the freezer. The pie is chilling.

We loved it....only change I made was to add the juice of half a small lemon I needed to use up.   Easy and delicious makes it a winner.

I've made this multiple times and it is wonderful! The recipe as written fills 2 ready made Keebler graham cracker crust pies. I have had it come out runny so I either freeze the pie or add a package of instant lemon pudding to thicken it . Both ways seem to work well. I've also used pink lemonade and strawberry lemonade, depending upon what I've had on hand, with fantastic results. Easy and delicious summer pie!

This was a very delicious pie! The mixture was a bit runny so make sure you put it in the fridge for a while before trying to cut and serve it! It has the perfect amount of lemon flavor. I made my own graham cracker crust using cinnamon honey maid graham crackers.
