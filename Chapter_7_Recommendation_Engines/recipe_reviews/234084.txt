Very tasty! Thank you for sharing. I used all the ingredients as listed but modified the steps as follows: 1) Saute onions and garlic in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until the onions are clear. 2) Add peppers, chili powder, parsley and oregano to onions and garlic. Mix and seer these together for 1-2 minutes on med/high heat. 3) Add chicken broth followed by all the remaining ingredients and cook as directed. Again, thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! I added a little more spice ie: garlic, jalapeno, and other peppers. Getting ready to make it again using leftover Thanksgiving turkey, maybe a spritz of ham.

Made this soup with a few changes. I added some mushrooms, and used Cayanne rather than Chili Powder. The soup is great, just enough heat to get your attention!!

This has a nice pleasant/mild flavor. If you are looking for spice, you need to add more than the recipe calls for. I actually made Turkey stock from the leftover thanksgiving carcass that still had enough Turkey meat on it for the soup.

Delicious. I cooked it too long and it turned into a rice dish,  which was fine. Family loved it.

Very tasty and easy to make. I had some leftover turkey and looked for a soup recipe that suited our family's tastes and that I had the ingredients on hand. This one fit the bill on both counts. Only changes I made were to omit the carrots and celery and add mushrooms. I also added a tablespoon of cumin and some chopped cilantro. Nice spice level and good taste.

I left out the jalapeno, added 5 stalks of celery, added 3 dashes of hot sauce and a lot of pepper, was a little bland at first but the next day it was better.  Next time I will add the jalapeno!

Really good, quick and easy recipe. I did make a couple of minor changes. I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil first. I also added 1 Tbsp of cumin to balance out the chili powder and add depth to soup (my husband is Mexican American, so it's one of the first things that he taught me years ago!). I also added another 1 Tbsp of rice and added some bok choy that I needed to use up from the fridge. Very good recipe. I plan to make it again with left over roast chicken throughout the year! Thanks.

I'm giving this 4 stars but only for one reason.  We really loved this, but I think it would be even better with a little more rice in it and I added a 1/4 tsp. chipotle pepper to kick it up as it was totally bland without it. With those changes this is a 5-star recipe.  This soup and a cheese quesadilla made a yummy dinner for us on a chilly evening, with just enough left over for my lunch the next day!

This soup is REALLY good although I wouldn't say the spice level is medium hot - it's closer to mild.

GarageRock you can take center stage with this one. A perfect blend of flavors for the leftover turkey. I must confess, I did add an extra jalapeno.
