Hi, this is the creator of this recipe.  Just letting you all know that 1/2 tsp of curry powder is *not enough.*  When I submitted the recipe, I wrote "to taste."  1/2 tsp is not even in the ballpark.... it should be around a tablespoon (more or less - hence, "to taste") but certainly not 1/2 tsp if you want any effect at all from the curry.

Allrecipes takes a long time to respond to recipe change requests, so I thought I would make a note here until the recipe is changed.

I'm eating this dish right now for breakfast and I must say I'm impressed for someone who hates regular curry.  I added some eggs on the side and used tater tots instead (mushed them up).  It has a very nice zip to it.

Yummy!  Similar to potatoes my favorite brunch place makes.  I used olive oil instead of butter, skipped the green onions since I didn't have any on hand, and added cumin.  Very good with ketchup!

This was a great blend of flavors. Granted, I like Indian food and curries (as well as hash browns). Like another reviewer, I used olive oil instead of butter. I had it with some tomato-apple chutney on the side. Delicious!

I already make something similar to this - it's almost a samosa filling without all the hassle of making samosa dough and the extra calories involved in frying it. I start with a little oil, adding some whole cumin and coriander seed to the oil and letting them pop before adding the potatoes - oil because the butter would burn on its own. (If you really want to be Indian, throw in some black mustard seed and let it pop!) You could actually use just oil but I like the idea of some butter in there. Some green chili, and a little fresh ginger and garlic in with the onions are also nice additions. I prefer the flavor of a nice garam masala to curry powder but it's all good. 

Try it with some tamarind or mango chutney!

This was excellent.  I used one large russet potato and 1/2 tsp curry powder.   I also added 1/2  of  a minced Serrano pepper.

Awesome spin on country style hash browns. I like spicy food - very spicy. Used one tbsp hot curry powder (as original poster suggested), 2 Serrano peppers, and didn't have cilantro, so I used parsley. It would be better with cilantro, but was very nice anyway. I added harissa to the top, and it was simply nummy! A great way to kick up hash browns. Thanks for the recipe!
