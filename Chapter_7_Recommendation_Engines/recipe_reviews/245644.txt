So, to avoid the $8 quad venti peppermint mocha at Starbucks every day, I smartly grabbed a bottle of peppermint syrup at the checkout counter at Sur la Table last month. (When I got home and saw I had paid $16 for it I wasn’t feeling as smart). I made a double batch of this recipe and I can’t tell the difference between it and the bottle I bought. I did give it some time to cool off before I added the extract.

Wow, I used the full amount of peppermint extract, and it was WAY too minty for me. I looked up a couple more recipes online, and they called for less extract. I had only made half a recipe, so what I did was add the full amount of water and sugar--I kept it on the heat until the syrup started to reduce, and I didn't add any more extract. So basically, I made the full recipe with only 1/2 teaspoon extract, and then it was OK. In my cup of coffee I used equal amounts syrup to half-n-half.

Tried a few bottled version of peppermint syrup and was really disappointed. Figured I'd make my own and this really hit the spot for homemade peppermint mochas! Made as is except for using sugar substitute and it tasted great. I think I used a little over a tablespoon in my coffee and it was perfect. Thank you!

Really easy!  i added more peppermint, though, as it wasn't quite strong enough with 1 tsp.

This was delicious! Tasted so great in my coffee. Would recommend adding a little more sugar but that might just be my preference ;-)

made it per instructions and t tasted like sweet water. It was barely minty and I couldn't taste anything when I added it to my coffee. Very disappointing.

Made this for hubby...he said it tasted good, but he had to put quite a bit in to get a nice peppermint flavor. Next time, I will either remove it from the heat, cool it a bit THEN add the peppermint extract or just use a bit of peppermint oil instead. Either way, he liked it and said he would give it 4 stars...Thanks for sharing. :)
