I had a really hard time finding frozen strawberry lemonade concentrate in my local stores, so I substituted it for just frozen lemonade concentrate (then added about 2 cups of sliced frozen strawberries that I soaked in strawberry flavored vodka). Other than that, I followed the recipe as is.  It turned out great, and my friends couldn’t get enough of it!

Sparkly and tasty, perfect for New Year’s Eve. I love the tanginess from the lemonade. I’m enjoying this concoction immensely!
