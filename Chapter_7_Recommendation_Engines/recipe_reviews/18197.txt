Wow this was good! I loved it. I used Ghiradelli unsweetened chocolate and you could taste the quality of the chocolate. Very rich and creamy. I put mine in the freezer for a couple of hours because I needed to chill quickly. I'll be making this again.

We made this pie for a bake sale at our church. It turned out really good. It sold for about 12.00.

The pie got rave reviews at Easter dinner. It held up really well and was light and quite sweet (too sweet for me but great for my guests). My substitution was to use bittersweet chocolate instead of unsweetened and then I reduced both the corn syrup and sugar to 1/2 cup each. It perfectly filled a store-bought Oreo crust and we topped it with a whipped cream piping and chocolate shavings. I will definitely make this pie again - it is so much lighter than a cream pie and is non-dairy without whipped cream topping.

This was way too sweet and failed to reach the right consistency.

I don t know how you can soften gelatin by sprinkling it over boiling water. I have always used cold water to soften gelatin. I used butter sweet chocolate but the indicated amount was not enough. It turned out very sweet no chocolate flavor. Would not make again
