Great. if huge, recipe!  I used pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and a bit of cardamom and allspice.  OMG the house smelled divine!

I also added in half a container of vanilla yogurt for more depth (normally would have done a couple of big spoons of sour cream, but was out).  I used almost all the sugar called for (just did light scoops, not packed, so probably 1/3 c less overall), and it was perfect.  I topped it all with a struesel crumb topping - also perfect!

This recipe made one 9"x5" loaf pan, one 8"x4" loaf pan (I only have one of each) and 6 regular muffins (and put walnuts in the smaller loaf - delish!).  I filled each container halfway with batter and had plenty of room - it only rose about an inch leaving an inch room after, so I could have done without the muffins and had taller loaves, but with a new recipe, better to be safe than sorry!

11.8.16  House smelled wonderful when this was in the oven.  I cut the recipe in half, and instead of one loaf, I baked three mini loaves.  This turned out very moist, spicy, and pumpkin-y.  Just a tad on the sweet side for us (personal taste preference), so I'll cut back on the sugars next time.  Followed the recipe as written, but I did add some chopped pecans.  This is a very tasty quick bread and certainly measures up well to other pumpkin breads that I've made!

Waaaaay too much ground cloves and sugar. If you choose to make this recipe, I would suggest swapping the measurements for ginger and cloves, except halve the updated amount of cloves. Also, if you’re making the effort  to remove the oil, why on earth would you use that much sugar? My suggestion would be to reduce the amount of granulated sugar by about 1/4 cup and the amount of dark brown sugar by about 1/2 cup. I probably will not make this again as I have a recipe from a 1970’s church cookbook that is phenomenal.

Cut back on sugar as recommended by others.  1/4 on the white and 1/2 cup on the brown.  Cut back on the nutmeg too.
The pumpkin bread is delicious.
Made full recipe and I’m going to freeze one loaf.

Didn't really love this recipe.  I think a lack of any oil or butter in this recipe left it kind of dry and it didn't bake well.  The flavor is nice but I won't be repeating this recipe.

I should know by now to always go with my gut, and this recipe is a prime example. Hmm, I said to myself, is that going to be enough baking powder? No, it wasn't. 
Wow! , I also said to myself, that seems like a lot of cloves. It was. Brought back the days of clove cigarettes. This was a huge waste of ingredients, and not one that I will be giving a second try.

I thought the measurements for the spices were way off. I should have went with my instincts when making the batter, however, I like to stick to the details on the first attempt when making a new recipe. I ended up throwing out 48 muffins because they had a very strong cloves flavor. Disappointing.

Not sure what went wrong, did not cook thoroughly I extended the time twice,  very solid and  needed  to be sweeter. Sounded like it would be great. I will try again but with changes.

The bread was nice and moist, but the seasonings  were overpowering.  If I make it again I will reduce all seasonings in half.

Loved the recipe. I made one large loaf, 2 mini ones, and 5 muffins from the recipe. Lowered both sugars as recommended by others (1  1/2 cups of brown, and 3/4 cup white sugar) and lowered cinnamon and cloves as well by a small amount. It was a rich bread full of flavors. Will make again. Thanks

I read the reviews and cut the spices in half. Made two beautiful loaves. They taste great!  I love that I can freeze one and save it for later or give it as a gift to someone else.

help!  Was it a typo that called for 2 teaspoon of nutmeg?  I licked the spatula after filling one loaf pan and my tongue nearly exploded!   I still have half of this batter unbaked....  What can I do to this portion to make it less nutmeggy?

This was delish and did, indeed, fill our home with a wonderful "fall-is-here" smell.  I cut the sugar by 1/3 and it was still plenty sweet.  For any who may worry about it turning out rubbery due to lack of oil, you might try reducing backing time to keep it more on the moist side.

It was very good even though I thought there might be too many spices in the recipe.  I was making this bread for 8-11 year old girls and wanted to share my  love for pumpkin bread. After it came out of the oven and I tried it, the taste won me over, but  I felt it needed the addition of a creamy, sweet mouth feel, so I added a cream cheese frosting.  The responses by the girls made me know that  I had a homerun on my hands.

Many reviews said it was too sweet and also too much spice.  So I cut all the spices and sugar in half as suggested.
It was so bland.  What a waste.

This was very good. I had a left over mixture of brown sugar, oatmeal and nuts in the freezer. I sprinkled that over the top. That gave it a nice crunch.

No, I find that this recipe was bland and a little spongy.

Absolutely wonderful!  I did not have dark brown sugar so I added a 1/4 cup of molasses. I did learn that the 65 minutes to cook is the least amount. It rises so nicely! I will be serving this at Christmas.

This is good. I was missing ginger and nutmeg but it was still tasty. A firm and filling bread. I probably would make it again. But not the best I have ever had.

Turned out heavy and a little "spongy".  I used Penzey's Cake Spice and only used 1- 1/2 tablespoons! Bread had a good but not overpowering spice taste, and my house has that wonderful aroma! All the spices listed are in Pumpkin Pie Spice so if you use that, I would recommend  starting out with 1 tablespoon.  (the total of the spices is  5-1/2 tablespoons!)

I made changes based on reading the other reviews and it worked out GREAT. I used half the amount of both the white and dark brown sugar, and I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour, plus 1 1/2 cups of white flour (instead of 3 1/2 of just white flour). For the spices, since a lot of reviews said the amount of spice was overwhelming, I ended up using 2 tbsp cinnamon (not 3), a little less than 1 tbsp nutmeg (not 1.5), 1 tsp cloves (not 2), and the same amount of ground ginger (1 tsp). 

Some reviews also said the bread was too dense. To remedy that, I used 1 heaping teaspoon of baking soda, and a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder (instead of a level/exact 1 tsp and 1/2 tsp). I also didn’t overly mix the bread, because I didn’t want to make it too tough. Just kept folding in the flour until there were no longer any flour spots. 

Really excited about this bread! I’m going dairy free, so I’m excited that this bread doesn’t use any butter.

I personally loved the strong spiced flavor. I didn’t like that this bread did not rise well. It definitely needs more baking powder and/or soda, perhaps 50-100% more. It is better the next day after being wrapped in plastic...the “crust” was less chewy.

Very disappointed. Mine looks nothing like the picture. The bottom stuck to the bottom of the pan and it’s way too spicy (although there’s a chance I may have measured to nutmeg wrong). Wish I would have only made a 1/2 recipe. Waste of flour and sugar.

Very dense bread.  A bit more spicy than I'd like, next time I'll use less.  I added pecans and raisins as well.  When cold I will slice it thin and make cream cheese (sweetened with a little confectioners sugar) between the layers of a pumpkin bread/cream cheese "sandwich".

I liked the pumpkin and spice flavor. Next time I will shift the proportions of the spices around-I like cinnamon over some of the other spices also will ease up on the sugar. I also added walnuts.  Easy to make and in my household of 6 lasted 4 days.  Put second loaf in plastic bag and was still moist when opened on 3rd day.

Oh yum! Surprisingly I had everything on hand except the applesauce when I read the recipe. I had some apples though and made my own applesauce, and this turned out great. I did add some walnuts but made no other changes. I will definitely make this again!

I was surprised at how much spice was used in this recipe. The cloves are the strongest.  I would recommend cutting the amount in half.   It could also use a little less ginger too.  The cinnamon was ok, but if you prefer to cut that back, it won't hurt it either.  I used unsweetened applesauce that was made by a friend, so it wasn't too sweet.  However, I can see how it would be if you used sweeter applesauce from the store.  It got rave reviews from friends and family, but I and one other agreed that the cloves were really too much.  Other than that, it is a great recipe!

I cut the servings in half so I got one loaf, and I added walnuts and raisins. Don’t bother lighting scented candles, this is aromatic and very tasty. I had it for breakfast with cheese and it was awesome, a real autumnal offering.

This was very tasty! I made 7 mini loaves- cooked for 38 min.
Added 3T of sour cream.
Also 1c craisins.
I reduced the cloves, as suggested by other readers.
My husband has requested choc chips the next time.

This bread was delicious!  I used a little pumpkin pie spice as well. Loved the cozy smell it gave off while baking. Everyone enjoyed it. Great with coffee or tea. I will make this one again. Highly recommend trying it yourself. Get ready for  the compliments.

Tastes great , added walnuts and love the aroma in the house.  Agree with some of the other reviews ... spices can be adjusted to slightly less.

I think it could be more moist. I changed eggs to 2 whole eggs & 2 egg whites to be fluffier. Will definitely do again but play around with it a little more.

This bread is nice and moist and has good flavor, but was almost TOO spicy, creating a bit of a bitter aftertaste.  I would cut down on some of the amounts of spices, but otherwise, good recipe!

I added 1 cup of golden raisins, 1 cup of chopped pecans, and 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves.  Would be good with chopped dates, walnuts, or toasted slivered almonds.  Excellent when  spread with plain cream cheese, which was all I had at the time.  I froze one loaf by wrapping firs with cling wrap and then heavy duty foil.

Awesome recipe. I will be making it again for sure. It’s a nice dense bread that is full of flavour. I substituted the water with buttermilk and only put in 1.5 tea spoons of nutmeg (recipe calls for 1.5 table spoons). Next time I am going to add raisins and chopped apples.

Very good, made 2 loafs with this recipe. Next time will add raisins or nuts to the mix. Instead of using dark brown sugar will use light next time also.

I made one recipe and used one long loaf pan and another smaller to give away.  I added white raisins.  My hubby told me I sure knew how to make the house smell great.  I thought the spices were just right.  And, I bought a large can of pumpkin to make another batch.  I would have doubled today but ran out of eggs.  Tomorrow..or Thursday.  I would make this again.  And maybe add MORE raisins.  I put in approx. a cup.

It’s in the oven now! I don’t care much for people who make a recipe and then change half of it, so I tried to follow this to the tea. Skipped right over that it said 2 TABLESPOONS of nutmeg, so that worked out ok. There was only one thing I planned to change when I was reading over the recipe, and that was the water. In making cakes and breaded like this, I always replace the water with buttermilk (or milk and vinegar). It just makes a richer taste to me. By tasting the batter, I would probably use less cloves and a little less cinnamon, and I’m a cinnamon lover! I also stirred about 1/2 c pecans into one loaf, just to try. Can’t wait to taste it when it’s done!

It's very dense and  I probably should have put all of the sugar that was mentioned in the recipe.. I try to limit the sugar content so it was not as sweet as I thought it should be..

What a wonderful aroma this loaf gives. 
I used two tablespoons of cinnamon and one of pumpkin spice, three tablespoons seemed like too much.
I ground the cloves then forgot to put them in, but the loaf is still very tasty.
Bake time was 60 minutes, I baked them in the convention setting in my oven.
A very good loaf that I will make again.
Thank you for the recipe.
