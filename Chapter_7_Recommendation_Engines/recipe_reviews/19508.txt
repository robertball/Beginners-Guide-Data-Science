A little different than my on version. A step up. I recomend if you wish to cut the fat to use half the butter and a quarter cup of olive oil. The oil also helps to keep the butter from burning.

This is a very tasty but simple recipe.  I had some frozen, cooked jumbo shrimp in the freezer, so I just used those and cooked them until heated through.  If you use the full amount of wine, you will need to reduce it to about half to achieve the best flavor and consistency.  Also, I wanted a more intense garlic flavor, so I made the garlic butter a day ahead and added a pinch of salt.  I also added 1 cup broccoli and 1/4 cup freshly roasted red peppers to the pasta to make this a one dish meal.  I will try adding asparagus next time.

Just read some of the reviews...how can reviewers say they did not like the recipe when the reviewers change the recipe.  You can't review an opinion if you don't make it correctly.  I followed a few of the reviews that said the wine was too much.  I cut back on the wine and it was wonderful.  I only use whole wheat pasta for health reason.  Found it to be pretty good.

This was a really good dish! It tastes similar to a dish from TGI Friday's. I used 1/2 cup wine and 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice. This recipe is a keeper.

Many moons ago my mother-in-law, who was my boss at the time, played cupid and asked me over for dinner with the intention of introducing me to her son. She made shrimp creole that evening, we had a great time and the rest is history. So, every year, on our "meeting anniversary", I make some sort of shrimp dish. We really enjoyed this version of scampi. I've never used wine in my butter sauce and it added a nice flavor, although I did cut back to about half a cup. I used a whole head of garlic and also added some olive oil to the butter. Very nice Robin and thanks!

I made a few changes, as this is a standard version of a classic dish. Partially cook the shrimp in a mixture of EVOO and butter over high heat. Remove from pan. Lower the heat, add the garlic, (I also add shallots,)  cook till fragrant, add wine, juice of one lemon, return the shrimp, adjust the S&P, add parsley and serve over rice.

Excellent and simple Italian lovers receipe!!!  My boyfriend and I loved it.  Based on reviews and knowing our tastes doubled the garlic and lemon, added about 2 tbs of Italian Seasoning mix for extra flavor and diced plum tomates for color and contrast.  Wonderful base recipe and very easilly tailored to ones personal tastes.

Very good recipe. I cut white wine by half and substituted the rest with chicken broth. I also used more garlic, a little olive oil and a few tablespoons of lemon juice. Kids ate it up which really surprised me. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow, that was yummy. I added basil & olive oil and should have added some diced tomatoes, too -- that would have added lovely texture and taste to this fine dish. This dish was so easy to make. Thanks!

I followed the instructions/ingredients the first time and loved it?   Gave it a 5 star rating.   Tonight I had some other items in the fridge I needed to use before they went bad, so I first saut√©ed portabella mushroom pieces, some chopped asparagus.    When I cooked the shrimp, I added some chopped marinated artichoke hearts and some crushed red pepper flakes.   Just before serving, I added the mushroom/asparagus mixture to heat and it rocked!!!   I love a flexible recipe like this that allows you to use other veggies on hand that enhance it.   Get creative!!!

Quite nice! Do go ahead and use the full cup of wine, but when you're deglazing the pan, you're to cook the wine until it has halved in volume, while scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen browned bits of garlic and shrimp. I also used about a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.

We thought this was okay.  It needed more of a kick of flavor.  I did use the full c of wine and didn't think it was to much at all.  I don't think I will make again.

This was so fast and delicious.  Thank you for sharing this classic pasta dish.  We had everything we needed already at home (another reason for 5 stars).  My mom taught me to always keep a bag of frozen raw deveined shrimp in the freezer- in case of last minute dinner guests or if we need a quick dinner.  Because your recipe had almost five stars, I even shared a cup of my Santa Margarita with the sauce (I'm not a good sharer).   I only made minor changes (just by preference).  I increased the freshly grated Parmesan cheese to 1 1/4 cups, to thicken the sauce and add more of the Parmesan cheese flavor.  I also prefer pressed garlic to minced garlic (I find it gives the dish a milder garlic flavor).   We didn't have angel hair pasta in the pantry, but we did have fusilli pasta (which worked perfectly).  Thank you again.

This was pretty easy and came out  good, but I did change a lot of how this was cooked. I changed it because the original mixture had too much wine and not enough of the other flavors in scampi. Also this recipe didn't state whether you needed to use cooked or uncooked shrimp which makes a difference in the time. I used uncooked shrimp. After I cooked the butter and garlic with the shrimp(uncooked shrimp) I transferred the mixture to a baking dish and added the wine and some parmesean cheese and baked covered for 10 mins at 350. I then uncovered it and baked it an additional 3-5 mins and added more parmesean cheese, garlic powder and some bread crumbs (about 1/4 cup)and parsley. After that I added the shrimp mixture to the pasta. I also mixed the pasta with a little olive oil, garlic powder and some wine. This scampi went great with the cheddar bay biscuits. I will be making this again.

This was delicioso as my children have stated. The only thing I did different was I drizzled a little bit of evo before adding the butter, used more fresh garlic (as we are garlic eaters), incorporated 2 cups of white wine (Pinot Grigio), dash of garlic powder and salt (told ya we love garlic) and fresh grated parmesan cheese. Many would think that it would be too garlicky but actually it was very subtle but gave the pasta a little something something when it was all mixed in.

My hubby gave this the "Totally Awesome Rating".  My tweaks, based on the reviews - I used 1/2 cup of white wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I sauteed the garlic and shrimp in 1/2 cup of butter.  I then removed the shrimp and put in the oven on Warm.  I added the wine, broth, 2 TB of lemon juice and a sprinkling of corn starch for a thickening agent, stirring constantly.  I put the shrimp back in the pan to absorb the flavors while I prepared the angel hair pasta.  Topped it off with freshly grated pecorino romano cheese.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a good starter for shrimp scampi I added squash,green peppers,shallots and mushrooms with more wine and butter and it came out perfect. This is an excellent starter scampi to let your mind run free by adding your own ingredients. Thank you for this starter scampi recipe.

This is exactly the recipe I use for my scampi and my family loves it! The only addition I occasionally make is a squeeze or two of fresh lemon juice. Otherwise, this is simply delicious as is!

I have tried several shrimp scampi recipes.  This is one of the BEST ones out there.
I made just a couple of changes:

I only used 1/2 cup white wine.
I added 1/4 cup lemon juice.
I sprinkled both cayenne pepper and ground red pepper to spice it up.
Instead of 4 cloves (which is not enough in my opinion I used about 10 cloves, minced)

My husband LOVES this.  It's easy quick and YUMMY!!!!!

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Awesome recipe! After adding the wine, about 30 seconds later, I removed the shrimp and boiled the butter/wine mixture by itself for an additional 5 minutes.  That helps cook down the wine flavor considerably.  I added the shrimp back in and mixed with the pasta and grated parm cheese. It was really a very delicious meal!!! You can also add other veggies like mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, etc., to dress up the dish.  Yum yum!!

My Mom taught me how to make this dish. We chose to leave the wine out entirely and enjoyed the flavors of the garlic, butter, pepper and the olive oil with the freshly grated Parmesian cheese sprinkled on top.

Your right, simple & elegeant! The key to this dish is to NOT overcook your shrimp. Shrimp takes minutes to cook and if you overcook it, it will ruin your entire dish! I did some adjustments:  1/2 cup of dry white wine, 4 Tbs of Butter, 1/2 cup of Extra Light Virgin Olive Oil....  In a medium suacepan add butter, oil, wine, garlic, fresh parsley, sea salt. Simmer for about 5 minutes, then throw in your shrimp (cut jumbo or large shrimps in halfs). Turning over with a spoon several times. Remove from heat immediately.   Top your dish with parmasagne cheese, black pepper and a hint of red flake pepper (optional)

Very yummy!  I made this to go over fettuccini for my shrimp loving boyfriend and we thought it was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except scaled it to 2 servings, and we found the sauce to be a perfect amount to coat 2 large servings of pasta.  I thought the amount of wine and other ingredients were just fine and not bland at all.  If you didn't like the wine, you probably didn't simmer it long enough to get the alcohol out.  Also, just last night I had shrimp scampi at a restaurant and the sauce was quite a bit different- a lot zestier and zippier, had cream in it and a good amount of lemon juice and raw garlic.  Maybe those who thought this was bland were expecting something more along the lines of the other sauce.

Made this for a date and I Saturday night.  I had previously been using Rachael Ray's recipe but this one put that one to shame.  It was easy, fresh and most of all delicious. Here is where I deviated:  I sprinkled the shrimp with some creole seasoning, some Italian seasoning, I squeeze a whole lemon and I added more wine.  I also used blend of Italian cheeses to sprinkle on the noodles.  It was divine.  This will be my recipe for this from now on.

I made this tonight, with the only difference being that I used cooked shrimp. It was pretty tasteless! No one really cared for it. Not sure what all the rave reviews are about, but I'll be trying another recipe next time.

This is the first time I made shrimp scampi.  I used frozen shrimp from the local Trader Joe food store.  Almost any kind of pasta will work with this dish.  I used rigatoni pasta and it worked just fine.  Like others, I used only half the amount of butter and white wine.  Due to the shrimp, I added 2 oz of lemon juice.  I added a half of a red bell pepper and half of a green bell pepper.  I also added some fresh spinach from a local produce market.  I also added two diced tomatoes.  All the extra vegetables may sound like a lot of additives, but trust me, it adds both color, flavor and nutrition to this dish.  Vegetables are also handy for stretching out a dish if you have to feed a number of people.  Finally, you will need a large pan to cook everything.  I used my All Clad copper core flat bottom stainless steel wok that I won on Ebay.  Thank goodness I had it as I needed all the room to cook the pasta, shrimp and vegetables.  Needless to say, my wife was impressed and she wants me to make this again soon!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This is excellent.  I was hesitant, based on prior reviews, to add the full cup of wine so only added 1/2.  I wish I had added the full cup--it would have been better!  I used 1/4 cup margarine and 1/4 EVOO.  I let everyone put their own cheese on.  It did require more freshly group black pepper--a lot more.  And I probably doubled the garlic--I didn't measure but did use at least a heaping tablespoon of chopped garlic along with a sprinkle of garlic powder.  Tasty!

Incredible garlicky goodness! I added  a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon, and all you could hear at the dinner table was 'yummmm, mmmmmm, yummmmm." will definitely make again, a true keeper! p.s. don't forget to serve with a fresh green salad and some crusty garlic bread.

Just got done making this dish. Aroma is heavenly,tasted great, savory, full of flavor and not overpowering. The white wine and fresh garlic and parsley gave this dish a great flavor. Recipe was easy to follow and I made no alterations. I used all fresh ingredients and this did not take long to cook. I like the simplicity of this dish with tasty results!

Im sorry-this was not good. I followed the recipe exactly-there was not enough flavor- very bland. I've made something similar before with a lot more garlic and used  olive oil instead of butter- I also added crab and fresh vegetables, topped with a pinch of Italian cheese blend. No wine. My version is excellent.

I made this for a family birthday party, and all of the guests loved it. I doubled the recipe, and naturally it took a bit longer thank 3 - 5 minutes to cook the shrimp in the butter and garlic. I added the wine when all of the shrimp were very nearly pink. It takes a little while for the wine to boil up, and all of the shrimp were done when it reached a boil. I wanted to make sure that the shrimp didn't overcook and get tough. But it all worked out.   The sauce is so very delicious! (It should be with that much butter.) Considering that five people ate almost all of the eight servings, I am sure that my family will ask for this recipe again.

OMG! This was absolutely the best!! I took the advice of other reviewers and added more garlic, 1/2 wine, 1/2 chicken broth, lemon juice and I also added a little cornstarch for a little thicker sauce...it came out PERFECT!! It was quick & easy and my kids gobbled it up.  My fiance said it tasted better than any he ever had at a restaurant.  I will definitely make again and again!!

Not quite a five star recipe, even with some changes, but still pretty good. Added lemon juice, capers, and extra garlic. The end result was still a bit bland. Next time I might add some chicken broth instead of wine.

I thought this was terrible. As I was adding 1 cup of wine I was thinking this is way to much. I was right!

I made this and thought that the recipe was very easy.  I loved how the flavors mingled together and that no one ingredient overpowered another. I was so hungry, I never even got to the salad and bread.  Will definitely make this again.

Very yummy! I added some broccoli just to get some veggie in there =).  I also added more garlic because I like garlic.  I'm thinking it would be good with Sundried Tomatoes too...I'll try that next time.  This recipe is very easy!  Definitely a keeper!

I usually prefer not to review a recipe if we didn‚Äôt follow it pretty close to exact or, at the very least, wouldn‚Äôt leave negative comments if we altered the recipe and didn‚Äôt care for it.  I am making an exception because I believe this is a fine recipe even though we did make some changes.  The changes were made only to suite our personal preferences and tastes, but the recipe as written was a great starting point for us and much appreciated.  We used half the butter and substituted the other half with olive oil because we like the flavor that olive oil brings to the dish and not so much for health benefits.  We used half the amount of wine and added a can of drained diced tomatoes near the end.  It adds nice color to the plate, but it‚Äôs the flavor we were after.  The amount of sauce we ended up with was perfect for 8 ounces of pasta, but some may want to use more of the wine if they prefer their plate to be a little more flooded with sauce.  We used a medium to large size shrimp.  Smaller would have been fine too, but much larger or jumbo may have been overkill for this dish.  The recipe was easy to follow and not very time consuming.  The worst of the prep time is peeling and deveining a pound of shrimp, but probably not a big deal for those more experienced with it.  The bottom line is; this is a wonderful and flavorful meal given the minimal amount of time invested.  The cost for this meal is very reasonable, especially if you can catch the shrimp when their on sale.

I followed the recipe and the only change I made was I had multi-grain angel hair instead of regular. It was fantastic. Nice and simple, and got rave reviews from my dinner guests. Had a nice dry Sauvignon Blanc with it and served with a light green salad. Yum.

Made this last night. Used 5 cloves of garlic for myself and my wife. No vampires in the house, that is for sure. Like others, went with a half a cup of wine, and used olive oil with the butter. Also used already cooked and cleaned shrimp, which put in the pan for about 3 minutes. A great dish, and a classic!

Very good recipe. Did a few renovations to recipe but for family's tastes and my own but drew mainly from recipe. Still basically the same so keeping review points where they should go! Hat's off RNCOGGINS!

I am hoping the 1 cup of white wine is a typo...there was a ton of liquid left over.  It still tasted really good, but I'll try Shrimp Scampi III next time.  I did use half the amount of butter and only 2 TBS of oil and it was plenty.

This is a very good recipe. I was going to change it up a bit after reading the reviews and add less wine and put some lemon juice in it but my husband already added it before I could tell him anything. I found the wine to be a little overbearing but I am a pickey eater. The rest of my family, hubby and 5 kids, devoured it and didnt say anything about it. I will definatly make this again and try to change it up a bit. Very simple recipe that you cant go wrong with. thank you.

Very simple and easy recipe.  My friends all enjoyed it.  I was worried by the amount of butter it calls for, but my friends said it could've used even more!  I added a few red chilli flakes for a touch of heat.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but I think it needs a little bit more garlic. Other then that it was really good! It has made its way into my dinner rotation!

Has a good taste.  But don't pour the sauce over the noodles.  The sauce soaks into the noodles and there isn't any sauce.

This is good, especially if you like garlic.  My 12 y-o liked it which says a lot for it.  The sauce seemed thin so I whisked in a couple teaspoons of flour while cooking and I liked it better that way.  I also added 1/4 tsp Old Bay.

This was really good. I did make some changes because I wasn't comfortable with the calorie/saturated fat content. I halved the butter, added 1/8 cup olive oil and reduced the parmesan cheese to 3 tablespoons. Those changes were made purely for health reasons but not because I thought there was anything wrong with the recipe. The reason this recipe doesn't get 5 stars is because all of the white wine makes it way too watery for my preferences. I removed the shrimp from the sauce, reduced it further and added a sprinkling of flour to thicken it up just a little bit.

I had some fresh tri-color tortellini with cheese and was looking for a shrimp scampi recipe to use it with.  I actually used barely thawed cooked shrimp because I don't have good luck with shrimp.  Took another reviewers advice and used 1/2 cup wine and added a little olive oil.  This was really good, and easy too.

Delicious!  Half and half butter/olive oil as suggested (for lower "bad" fat content) and half the white wine.  YUMMY!  Thanks for this recipe.

I used chicken broth instead of wine. The night I made this we thought it was just ok but over the next couple of days as we ate leftovers it was really good. I doubled this recipe and it made a whole lot.

Absolutely amazing!  The only thing I did differently was sprinkle the shrimp with flour before sauting them in the garlic, butter & I added a little olive oil to prevent the butter from burning.  The flour helped make the sauce thicken up a bit.  Great recipe!

I love this, I have made it so many times now since my first time and I just love it! One small addition I added was some red pepper flakes, just to give it a little bit of a bite. Putting the parmesan cheese on after adding the mix to the pasta made such a big difference, it helped the cheese stick to the pasta (and not clump up and also didn't thicken the base)  making it easier to mix the shrimp and pasta together; great little secret! Also, I used frozen shrimp and also used butter and evoo, was a nice combo. This is my favorite recipe on this site to date, awesome and definitely worthy of serving to dinner guests! Looks, smells and tastes amazing!

So simple but absolutely scrumptious.  Used extra garlic and subbed 1/2 olive oil for butter.  Otherwise prepped just as written. Highly recommended.

This was wonderful!  I gave it 4 stars because 1 cup wine is just too much.  I decreased it to 1/2 cup and it was perfect!  I lowered the fat content by using 2 Tbl. butter + 2 Tbl. olive oil and would do that again!  I think next time I will saute the garlic in the butter, then add the other ingredients (except shrimp and cheese), bring to a boil, simmer a few minutes, then add the shrimp and cook.  I think it would be more flavorful that way.  I put all this on a bed of fresh spinach (pretty presentation!) and the heat from the dish made the spinach steam a bit.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I added ricotta cheese.  I think I should have soaked the shrimp in milk because it tasted a bit "shrimpy".

Very easy to make and very good.  Cut back on the butter amount and add a bit of lemon juice to take the flavor up a bit.  I also added just a little bit of stock to make the sauce.  Thanks for  the post.

I changed it a little, used 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup chicken broth.  I also added some cayenne pepper.  But, we usually "spice up" our recipes.  In any case, I thought it was a bit bland, and after adding just 1/4 cup of wine, the wine odor was quite overpowering.  Made it with lobster, with french bread to soak up the sauce.

My finicky boys and husband all loved this.  Knowing that I should take it easy on the wine, I reduced the amount to 1/2 cup.  I also added a bit extra garlic and  some green onions (we love them).  I only had dried parsley which was fine, and I added some fresh cilantro to my plate which gave me the fresh green taste.  This will definitely be a quick and easy staple in our house now.

This was excellent! I added a splash of lemon juice and also thickened the sauce with a bit of flour and water.  Will definitely make this again and may add spinach or something.

This tasted reaally good. I noticed it was a little heavy on the white wine. I had this a few days later at a resturant called Fransisco's and it tasted just about the same.

Yum! So easy to make. I used bagged frozen peeled shrimp, replaced the white wine with chicken broth, and replaced half of the butter with olive oil. I guess next time I will try it with the wine, even though its good the way I made it.

This is an easy, elegant & fast dish to make.  My only changes are that I cooked it on very very low fire to let the flavors mix together, prevent garlic burn, and let the sauce thicken.  I cheat a little adding 2tbs of a good italian vinagrett...a whole stick of real butter and red pepper flakes for spice.  Sugar,white vinager and club soda are a nice sub for white wine.  Yumm

The was pretty good. I did use a bit less butter and added some olive oil to the skillet. I added tomatoes to the mix and some scallops.  I also added a bit of lemon juice and parmesan cheese.

This was a good recipe; I,like other reviewers,"punched it up" a little with some Old Bay and basil,but the flavor still wasn't really outstanding.The sauce was pretty thin near the end,so I added some Wondra flour mixed with water into the sauce,and it thickened up nicely. A good recipe,but don't expect wonderful flavor,other than the taste of the shrimp. I would make it again,but I need to ponder what ingredients would really make it tasty.

for such common ingredients, easily found in one's cupboard, wow! a quick and truly delicious meal...we loved it took longer for the oven to preheat for the garlic bread than it did for me to cook this meal! i used the frozen shrimp too and it was all still very good! definitely a keeper!

I did make as listed, however the wine was overpowering.  Next time i will use half wine and half chicken broth.  I also think lemon with an onion and chopped up tomato would give more flavor.  As well as some Italian seasonings and salt.  Oh yeah and double the garlic!!!  This was a great recipe, but only to build off of.

Absolutely LOVED it!  Cut wine in half and used 1/2 cup chicken broth.  Also, red pepper flakes.  Salt/Pepper and this is the BEST!  Bland?  C'mon people, season your dish! :-)

I wouldn't use the pre-cooked shrimp like other people suggested.  My shrimp came out  rubbery!  Also, this was not very flavorful.  I added extra garlic and still wanted to take my shrimp and dip them in something...the cheese didn't add to the flavor.  I'll look for a different recipe next time.

I used chicken broth in place of the wine (since I didn't have any wine on hand), after seeing some of the reviews here. Anyway, this dish turned out really great, and my family enjoyed it- yours truly included. Thanks for posting this!

Made this with my wife on New Years Eve, it was fantastic. One note for the recipe though is that the sauce gets most of its flavor from the wine so make sure the wine is good, not some cheap horrible tasting cooking wine. I'm guessing that's where most of the negative reviews are coming from. This tastes fantastic.

Easy and very tasty. I browned the garlic first, then added butter & shrimp and squeezed a bit of lemon for a different twist. Cooking the pasta actually took longer than making the sauce. A keeper.

This was really easy and good.  My husband said that it was the best scampi he's ever had.  He liked it because it wasn't too oily.  I didn't have any white wine, so I subbed chicken broth instead.  It worked just fine.

This was very quick and easy to make. I loved it! My hubby however said the dish was overpowered by the taste of the wine, I seriously think he didn't even taste it til I told him I used it in the dish. LOL. So I think it was all in his head. Great with a nice salad and texas toast! YUM! I will definitley make this again.

This is so easy and so delicious.  I add a little crushed red pepper flakes to the shrimp and if I have broccoli florets, I add them to the pasta for the last 3 minutes of cooking time.   So good.

Very easy and good! I added a little less wine and subbed a little olive oil for part of the butter. Shrimp lovers, you can add 2 pounds of shrimp and it would be fantastic! I served with breadsticks and salad.

Great recipe!  Simple, easy and tasty!  I was a little nervous at the amount of the sauce, but once we added the noodles and veggies, it was perfect.  Veggies you ask... they weren't in the recipe.  After reading the reviews of other cooks, we made a few changes.  We only used 1/2 cup wine and then added a splash of lemon juice, sauted onions, sauted red peppers and steamed broccoli.  My two children (three and one) just devoured it.  Next time we are going to try this with chicken breast strips.  Thank you again for a great recipe!

I followed the recipie exactly but didn't like it.  My husband and I managed to eat a small plate of it but threw the rest out.  The sauce was too buttery for our tastes (and our arteries!) and there wasn't enough flavor.  I have another scampi recipe that involves the ingredients in this one (but much less butter!), and also lemon juice, scallions, olive oil, and thyme.  Previously I've also put chopped fresh tomato and mushrooms in with the shrimp and sauce.  Next time we have scampi I'll stick with my oldie but goodie recipie.

Very good, mine had too much liquid, but it soaked it up. If it's too runny, I would recommend letting it set a little while before serving.

This recipe did not turn out for me.  The wine smell and taste was so strong that we could not eat it.  Perhaps 30 seconds was not enough?

I enjoyed this recipe greatly.  Simple, quick, and very tasty.  I reduced the amount of wine by 50%.  I added a red pepper (diced), chopped brocoli, and a little ricota cheese.  Vitamins, color, and delicous.

Very Good!  I used low fat marg. instead of butter and 1/2 c. wine.  Next time I'll try 3/4 c. as something seemed to be missing.  Will definitely make this again.

This is an extremely easy, wonderful recipe that you can add to your collection. My whole family loves it and it is made so quickly. I have added some bread crumbs to the shrimp while they are cooking to thicken it up a little. Delish!

This was absolutely wonderful! I used a combonation of butter and olive oil and half wine half chicken broth. I increased the amounts on everything since I had extra shrimp around. Because of that I needed to thicken it a bit at the end with arrowroot flour. Everyone loved it. Actually, even my son who had never liked shrimp loved it! Thanks for the recipe Robin.

This is a very good recipe and so easy.  I added extra parsley and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper which really made this dish great.  We are very big on vegetables, so I also added broccoli to the boiling angel hair pasta in the last three of cooking.  This was enjoyed by the whole family.  My husband wants me make this dish again next week.

This turned out lovely for my family - but with modifications. I used 50% less white wine, and less butter but also added EVOO. I added leaf spinach and diced fresh tomatoes. I also used the juice of 1 medium lemon. This. Was. Amazing! My family loved it!

Good basic recipe. Would add more garlic, a clove or two more would do it. Definitely cook the shrimp a little in EVOO, remove, then add the garlic and wine, butter etc and let it cook down a bit before adding back in the shrimp. heat thru then add the parsley, cooked pastaand cheese. If u do this you wont need to cut down on the wine.

I tried this recipe several times as it is and it is good. I like to use EVOO instead of butter to saute the shrimp and garlic as it does not burn as easily. After the addition of the wine (1/2 c) is adequate I add 2 T of butter to the finished sauce. It melts in and adds the buttery flavor without browning. Enjoy!

Inhave made this meal several times with and without the wine...always a hit, even with changes to whether I use fettucini, linguine, or thin spagetti! If you don't love it..you are doing something wrong!

This was very good, not great but good.  I have used other recipes that were better.  This one seemed to lack flavor, as compared to others.  With that said, my family did enjoy it without complaints and finished their plates.  Next time I would add lemon juice for sure.

This recipe is fantastic! I did have to change one thing in this recipe. I don't drink, therefore, there is never any wine in my house. Normally I would subsitute either apple juice or broth for the wine. With this recipe, I decided to use half white grape juice and half vegetable broth. I was afraid if I used all juice it would be too sweet. I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for wine, and that didn't have to be baked. ( it was 88 degrees the day I made it). This recipe is very good the way I made it and I'm sure it would be even better with the wine. The next time I make it, I may have to find a small bottle of Sauvignon Blanc or other dry white wine to use for it.

3 1/2 stars, a bit bland. Even with adding greek seasoning and red pepperflakes. I did like 1/4 butter and 1/4 olive oil change; plus some cornstarch.

One of my favorite recipes now. I followed other people' suggestion. I cooked it in 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter. I decreased wine in 1/2. I also added one medium diced tomato. I steamed broccoli separately and then added it to the shrimp scampi for added veggie and aesthetics. I added fresh basil leaves at the end (and skipped parsley). Then poured shrimp scampi over pasta. Delicious.
Made this for a party and it was a big hit. Thanks RNCoggins for recipe!

I hate to give a poor review, but I found this sauce to be bland and tasteless. I ended up having to add tons of lemon juice and extra garlic just to give it some flavor. Perhaps if the sauce was just used as a glaze on the shrimp, it could work. But it definitely wasn't flavorful enough to work with the pasta for me.

This was a great jumping off point, and I definitely enjoyed it.  I did think it needed a lot of lemon, and more butter.  The butter and lemon make a nice amount of sauce for the noodles and for dipping bread in.

This recipe was amazing!  Everyone loved it!  I did add extra garlic, no-salt seasoning, and thickened the boiling mixture with a little flour-mixed-with-warm-water just like I do to make gravy.

This was recipe was good but I would suggest adding some additional herbs and maybe some scallops and mussels as well.  Just a little plain.

Just ok at best. Followed directions exactly and it was unlike any scampi I've had out at restaurants. I think the butter was on the heavy side and just threw the whole think off.

This was great!!! I did make a few changes - don't we all?!?!?!  I added more garlic than was called for (of course!), added the Parm cheese right to the pan to cook, added italian blend cheese right to the pan at the end and then poured all that lovely goodness right over my pasta.  The only think I will change next time is to add some heat to it - crushed red pepper flakes???  This was a definite winner in our house.

I can't make sense of all the five star reviews when there are much better shrimp scampi recipes out there.  The amount of wine made the sauce too thin.  It didn't cling to the pasta. Overall I found this lacking in flavor. I followed the recipe exactly. I would not make again .

Other than this needing a lot more than 4 cloves of garlic, this recipe is great. It's simple enough for a big, dumb guy like me to make and it turned out great. My girlfriend was pleasantly surprised.

Still, though, double the garlic. Seriously.

Very easy recipe with wonderful flavor.  Reminded me of Olive Garden's shrimp scampi, minus the peppers and onions.  Added a couple of shakes of italian seasoning and red peppers..very good..

I made this for the second time last night and have figured out the way that works best for me.  As another reviewer suggested, I marinated the shrimp for a few hours in 1/2 cup of white wine and garlic.  I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup unsalted butter.  I removed the shrimp and garlic from the wine to cook in the butter/olive oil, then added a fresh 1/2 cup of white wine to the shrimp.  I served over fettucine noodles.  It was delicious.

I made it as is and it was great. I reduced the sauce a little and it was perfect. My mistake was thinking I could save time by using cooked shrimp and they ended up overcooked, but that was my fault.

This recipe (with the reviewer comments) provided for a great base for the next time I make this.  I used 1/4 c. butter and 1/4 c. olive oil instead of just butter and used 7 cloves of garlic and added a little green onion.  Instead of the 1 c. of wine I used 1/2 c. wine, 1/4 c. chicken broth, and 2 Tbsp. Real Lemon juice.  I added a little Italian seasoning, as well.  Used a little cornstarch at the end to thicken slightly and topped with diced tomatoes and parmesean.

BEST SCAMPI!!! I reduced the servings to 2. I also added 2 diced roma tomatoes when the shrimp was added and cooked it all together. Gave it some color and nice added flavor.

The recipe was fast, easy, and simply delicious!!! I would recommend waiting until your pasta cools slightly before adding the cheese; otherwise it gobbs up and binds the parsley and pepper. Overall though it made for very happy eating :D

I used 1/4 c. butter to cut down on fat, 1/2 cup chicken broth (no wine on hand) and forgot the Parmesan :(  My whole family loved this! I threw in 1 lb of frozen shrimp so it was a super easy meal to make. For sure will make it again using the Parmesan cheese!

Followed the recipe EXACTLY AS IS...it was too liquidy and bland.  I will not make again, but for those who are giving it a shot....use less liquid.  Husband thought it was ok, and I thought just ok as well.  Needed more kick for our flavors.

My 3 and 6 year old loved this recipe and they are super picky.  This has become a monthly staple in our house.  After making this a few times I did add some panko bread crumbs to thicken up the sauce.

I'm not sure what is going on with my dish, but it's VERY liquidy.  I cooked it as written and my shrimp are tough.  I think the wine needs to be reduced and the shrimp removed before the wine is added.

I made this using the ingredients as listed. I sauteed the shrimp in a large oriental wok. Then, while the mixture was still hot, I tossed in the drained angel hair and the cheese. Although the shrimp scampi mixture will appear way too liquid, you'll be amazed at how the angel hair soaks it up. The pasta will probably be too dense to get the shrimp to mix in, but not a problem. Once the pasta was covered thoroughly, I served the angel hair onto individual plates and scooped the shrimp from the sides of the wok onto the top of the pasta... sprinkled the (dried) parsley... and served. Flavorful, but not overpowering. PS: there was not a drop of liquid left in the wok after serving the pasta!

This dish was awesome...very easy to make!  I used frozen shrimp so I didnt need as much liquid.  The only thing I changed was I used chicken broth instead of wine.  Around 1/4 cup.  Would make this again...:)

This was alright. Reduced white wine as others suggested, would have been to much liquid otherwise. Very easy, most of these things I had on hand.

I have made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe using the full amount of white wine.  I am unsure if I had dry white wine because I couldn't find in my grocery store a good dry white wine.  So I just picked up a bottle of white cooking wine.  The wine was a little overpowering for me and my husband.  And the garlic flavor was not as strong as I had wanted.  The second time I made this I added an additional 2 cloves of garlic, 1/4 cup of butter and then only 2 Tblsps of wine.  This led to a much better tasting sauce as the wine wasn't too overpowering.  I will definately make again!

Wow, this was incredible! I used 3/4 cup of wine, and let it reduce for a bit. I also sauteed some mushrooms with the shrimp and sprinkled chopped tomatoes over the pasta before serving. I didn't think to remove the shrimp from the pan while I was reducing my wine so they were a bit overcooked but still very tasty. This tasted excellent and was quick to make. Yummy!

This is AWESOME.  Good tip though: don't over-do the wine; it can really take away from or overpower the entire dish.

as written this has no flavor/no good flavor and the sauce is much too thin.  Too make it worth the shrimp i cooked down to half, added lemon juice, garlic salt and a diced tomato, making it a 5 star meal.

I'm updating my review since I've made this numerous times and it has become a family favorite.  This recipe is excellent.  I added some lemon juice to the sauce and along with the butter, I sauteed the shrimp in olive oil. If I have chicken broth I prefer add 1/2 cup as well.  Cherry tomatoes are a nice addition, they add color and some flavor.  Top with crushed red pepper flakes for an extra kick.

We gave this a 3 because we cut the wine in half, but it was delicious!  I made it again adding some broccoli, more garlic & added a tbsp of flour right before the wine to thicken the sauce a little...worked great!  My 1 & 3 year olds always ask for more :)

This was very good! The second time I made it I used only a splash of white wine ( husband not a big fan of wine) and a few tablespoons of chopped sundried tomatoes, and 2 chopped green onion. The tomatoes added some extra flavor and color. Will make this one again!

I made the decision to cut the wine in half as I was making this.  There was just so much of it that I felt I would be wasting it.  I let it reduce a few minutes and combined it with the drained pasta in a large bowl.  Everyone thought it was restraunt quality.

Very, very good!!!  I cut back the butter to 1/4 cup and used 1/4 of olive oil like others suggested to reduce the fat.  I'll definately make this again.  I might add some sauteed peppers and onions next time.

This recipe was great!  Very quick and easy, but definitely not lacking in flavor (I was generous w/salt and pepper).  I used 1/2c of wine and 1/2c chicken broth and frozen, pre-cooked shrimp, which I soaked in water/lemon juice (as per another reviewer's suggestion) and added them at the very end.  I couldn't believe how good it was for as easy as it was to prepare.

This was super delicious. Shrimp Scampi is my boyfriend's favorite food. It did taste a little too much like wine for my taste, but I wish I had more knowledge of good cooking wines, because that could have made all the difference.

A very good recipe, if you want to add a litle kick you can add about an 1/8th of a tsp of red pepper flakes sauted with the garlic. Top with fresh ground pepper.

Who needs Red Lobster with the great recipe?  Fantastic!  I did cut the wine down to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I also added a scallion in with the garlic, and sauteed in olive oil and butter.  Added diced tomatoes, lemon juice and green onion at the end.

This was great. Made some changes like previous suggestions. Instead of the wine (not sure if the kids would like the taste) i did the 1c. of chicken broth, squeezed in a lemon, added breadcrumbs and stirred in cornstarch to thicken up. This is one i will make again!

This was an exceptional dish.  It turned out to be resaurant quality or better according to my hubby.  The kids liked it as well.  I used frozen shrimp, 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 butter and about a tbls of lemon juice.  Next time I might try using fresh shrimp to kick it up a notch.  This may be my next meal I serve to company.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good, easy and quick.  I followed other reviews suggestions and used half wine half chicken broth.  I also used some cornstarch to thicken the sauce slightly.  I doubled the recipe and four of us eat almost all of it.  I served it with broccoli which could have been mixed into the scampi.

Fabulous! Needs no tweaking except I used chicken broth instead of wine(it never all completely cooks out of any dish). You can even use dried parsley. 
I agree with Ziporah on changing the recipe.

I followed the suggestions of using 1/2 the wine and adding lemon juice--I squeezed in 1/2 of a fresh lemon (a must). I think the wine would have been too powerful without halving it (that's why I rated the original recipe with only 4 stars).  I also used the idea of letting all of the ingredients cook together a bit before adding the shrimp.  All great suggestions! This was a delicious and light recipe.  I added about 1 Tbs. of fresh basil to the sauce at the end while it was cooking, and it gave off good flavor. Don't over cook the pasta!

The reason I give this 4 stars is only because of the wine.  TOO MUCH!!!  I should have listened to other reviewers and did less wine or half wine and half broth.  Other than that, it's easy, fast, and delicious.  30 seconds cooking the wine was definitely not enough to absorb the alcohol so we felt like we were eating wine!   Maybe if it were cooked in longer it wouldn't taste so strong but next time I'll definitely try 1/2 cup wine, 1/2 cup chicken broth.

Wow! This recipe was really easy and tasty too! This is the first time I ever cooked a shrimp recipe and the whole family was raving at how great this dinner was. I added more garlic since I am garlic obsessed, and cooked the pasta after I had already prepared the shrimp, this way I could concentrate on one thing at a time so I knew it would come out perfect.

Very good. I took the advise of other reviewers and doubled the garlic (yum!) used 1/2 cup wine instead of a full cup. I actually used white zin, because I didn't have any regular white wine (could have sworn I had some..) and it was surprisingly good. I substituted the other 1/2 cup with milk to make it a bit creamier. I also added 1/4 cup lemon juice, and a few tablespoons of flour because I had the same problem as some other reviewers where it was too soupy. It did the trick though, there wasn't a drop left sitting at the bottom of the pan. I  used egg noodles instead of angel hair. It was very good and I will be making it again, but next time I'll use half the butter because it was a bit too greasy.

This is a quick and easy recipe. I use chicken broth instead of wine because of my kids, but this is a family favorite. We give it a thumbs up!

This dish is awesome.  Used Vermicelli pasta instead.  Used ready to eat shrimp, cut up in pieces.  Cut the wine in 1/2, and sprinkled a little flour, to make it a little thicker. This way really sticks to your pasta.  You will have no butter left on your plate.

This scampi is great. I use Savignon Blanc for the wine and I like to add crab meat with the shrimp. I also use whole wheat pasta. It makes it so tasty. I did add the parmesan cheese to the skillet to thicken up the sauce.

I followed the advice and cut back on the wine to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup lemon juice. My whole family ate all of it with NO left overs. I also added a bit more minced garlic. Enjoy

Very simple and delicious recipe.  I added shredded carrots as well as some sugar snap peas to make it a more balanced meal and it was great.  We will be making this one again.

Very good...with a few tweaks!  I doubled the garlic, for starters.  In my book, it's not shrimp scampi unless it creates major garlic breath afterwards!  I used about 1/4 cup fresh chopped flat leaf parsley to bring in a fresh flavor, substituted 2 tsp crushed red pepper for the black pepper, but back the parmesan to 1/4 cup (parmesan tends to make the fish taste salty) and used some unflavored bread crumbs in lieu of the remainder of the cheese to thicken the sauce.  I also used a couple of tbs of fresh lemon juice for zip, but should have used more.  All in all, not bad after all of the changes!

Excellent!  Wonderful flavor.  I've made it twice...and the second time I used 3 cloves of garlic and then added some garlic salt when mixing the shrimp with the pasta.  I also used a little less wine, so the wine flavor wasn't so overpowering.  It was delicious!!!

This was great!  We have a 5, 4 and 2 year old and they loved it too!  I have also decreased the shrimp to 1/2 lb. and put in 1/2 lb. imitation crab and 4 large mushrooms as well.  Very Good!

I decreased the butter to a half of a stick, and used 3 cloves of garlic. I don't think I could've handled any more butter than I put in, let alone what the recipe called for.

Overall it was just lacking for me. Maybe some more spices next time?

We love this recipe! It tastes better than the shrimp scampi dishes we've eaten at restaurants.
We always add at least 5 cloves of garlic because we love garlic. This is a fast and delicious meal.

This has to be the easiest, fastest meals going.  And so flavorful.  I just started dieting, so I used the olive oil, garlic, a can of shrimps (it was just sitting in the cupboard begging for a chance), crushed pepper, parm cheese, and 4oz of angel hair pasta.  It was dinner for me and an appettizer for my fiance.  I'm a huge fan of garlic and spice, this did the trick and did I mention fast?

Not fantastic, I made it again using only 3 tablespoons of wine and added some green onions, a little cayenne, and garlic salt.  It was better with these changes in my opinion.

So...I really thought shrimp scampi would be more flavorful than this!!  I LOVE both garlic and butter so I figured this would be a fantastic dish, but I have to say, I was extremely disappointed!!  Even though I more than doubled the amount of garlic called for, I couldn't taste ANY of it...in fact, the only thing I COULD taste was the wine.  I know I've tried shrimp scampi in restaraunts with TONS of flavor...so I will continue to look for a better recipe.  This was just a waste of ingredients!!

WOW!  This was so good!  Tastes just like ones you find at restaurants.  Only changes that I made was that I used 6 cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup of white wine and 1/2 chicken broth and added 1 tomato, diced.  Sauce didn't have a strong wine taste, very good.  Thanks a lot.  Can't wait to try this on company.

This is a fantastic recipe... I added some  finely diced tomatoes and a dash of chili powder to the garlic while cooking and squeezed some lemon juice over the finished product.   Even tried a vegetarian version with broccoli instead of shrimp and found no leftovers the next day!  Simple and superb!

Excellent! Based on some reviews and comments, we did use about 3/4 butter and 1/4 olive oil. Didn't have white wine so substituted 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 lemon juice. Removed shrimp from the pan while reducing the liquid so they wouldn't overcook. Added 3 small chopped garden tomatoes and I highly recommend that if it's summer and you have fresh tomatoes. Used fettuccine because that's all we had. Fresh parsley from the garden. The shrimp were delicious but the pasta - wow! Definitely one of the best things we've ever made!

Yum!! I didn't have fresh shrimp so I used pre cooked frozen shrimp. I just heated them up in the delicious butter sauce. The hubby loved it too! I served it with a nice crusty piece of garlic bread and oh my was it good!  This is a keeper.

I did not follow the entire recipe, but just the "scampi" part, which means that I didn't make it into a creamy Alfredo by using the Parmesan and I didn't serve over pasta.   Also, I changed the point at which I added the shrimp, which I think was very important.   I wanted to cook down and tame the wine somewhat, and adding on top of the shrimp to get this result would have resulted in extremely over-cooked shrimp.   I instead added the wine with the butter and garlic and pepper and brought to a low boil for several minutes.   Then I added the shrimp and cooked until done.   The only thing that I would possibly change in the future would be to sub in lemon juice for 1/4 of the wine.   Good base recipe.

This was just ok.  I followed the recipe as written and the wine flavor was overpowering.    To fix it, I removed the shrimp (so they wouldn't overcook), added more garlic, pepper and salt then boiled the sauce so it would cook down a bit.    It tasted better, but I'll play around with it a bit more if I try this recipe again.

I made the scampi but Altered it a bit.  I added half a shallot finely chopped. A bit of dried oregano.  2 tablespoons olive oil and 2 pinches of flour.

I had beautiful fresh Gulf shrimp, wanted something quick for dinner, so I thought why not try a new recipe for shrimp scampi?  This recipe has too much butter and too much wine which ends up making it watery and dilutes the flavor (even the garlic flavor was pushed to the background).  I really don't think you need 1/2 cup of butter for 1 pound of shrimp.  IMO the only way this might work is to modify ingredient amounts or to remove the shrimp from the pan after saut√©ing and then reduce the liquid and intensify the flavor.  And where's the lemon, never made shrimp scampi without fresh lemon juice?  I just added some lemon wedges to the plate to be used at the table.  I really don't like changing a recipe too much first time through, and I know this recipe has had good reviews.  However, I would suggest that you really look at the ingredient amounts in this recipe before heading to the stove.  The fresh shrimp itself was so good that it salvaged the meal, but honestly, this was a huge disappointment.  Sorry, no tweaking for me, just movin' on.

Cooked de-tailed shrimp in butter and garlic. Added lemon juice, white wine, asparagus and mushrooms. Let cook for a bit, added some pepper and parm cheese. Next time we will put on pasta or use half the pasts, but it was even amazing left over!

I found it lacking in flavor.  I think it's a good base to start with but I wish it had more interesting flavor. I think I will take some of the tips I've read and make it again using some of them, like add roasted red peppers or asparagus, a little lemon juice, more garlic and a little less wine.  My son loved it as is, though.

Took th suggestion to use 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. In addition, I sauteed green onion followed by red pepper and mushrooms; finished off with some sugar snap peas from the garden along with the shrimp and garlic. Followed the suggestion to use 1/2 of the wine. And, it was delicious!

Like other reviewers said, the wine seemed a bit too much.  (Wish I would've read that before I fixed it as written.)  I poured the sauce back off the shrimp and reduced it in a saucepan by almost half.  I then added it and the shrimp to the pasta. Quite good with that adjustment!  Would be nice dinner for casual company!  Thanks!

Followed the recipe INGREDIENTS as is and it was restaurant quality.  I just changed the method a little cuz I wanted to reduce the wine a bit more than the 30 seconds the recipe allows.  Added the shrimp after the wine had reduced by about 1-2 mins.  It was perfect and had everyone wishing there was more. Thanks for the recipe!

Holy smack this is a great recipe! The first time I made it was for Valentine's Dinner. My whole family was in love with me. I have the pickiest eater ever and she says she loves this as much as cheese pizza. LOL. Buy the best pasta you can. And if you keep shrimp in the freezer, this is a great go-to recipe. Also, I make it without the parsley b/c I often don't have it. Of course, the parsley is lovely, but don't shy away from it. And have a good baguette on hand to sop up that buttery wine sauce. Delish! thanks for sharing it!!

Delicious and easy.  I cooked a parmesan angel-hair pasta kit that takes just 5 minutes itself.  Garnished the shrimp with the parmesan and parsley flakes on the plate.  I didn't mix the shrimp and the pasta - just ate them separate.

I cut the butter in 1/2 and used 1/4 c EVOO to cut down on the fat. I also added green onion with the garlic & shrimp---and, I used whole grain thin spaghetti instead of angel hair. Whenever I can add fiber and cut fat, I try to do it. Spinach, broccoli or any colorful vegetable would probably work well too.
It was easy, quick and tasty! I will surely make again.

I simply love the way this recipe turned out. I used the shrimp then made the recipe again using cubed chicken instead of shrimp. Have made it several times and each time it is perfect.

Great recipe, we added a half of a lemon and a few pinches of salt along with cooking the pasta al dente then finished cooking the pasta in the sauce. This dish was AMAZING...

I added a little kosher salt, fresh lemon, a little chicken soup base, and lots of extra parmesan cheese.  We either eat this as an appetizer and skip the pasta or eat as a side dish with grilled steak.  I also don't really measure as I taste it as I go!  Delicious!!

This was only so-so for us, not much flavor beyond the wine and it was really over-greasy.

I love this pasta and I can hardly resist ordering if I see it on a restaurant menu. The downside is, it's so expensive. Now that I know how to do it at home it'll be so much cheaper for me. I use half butter and half olive oil. It's really delicious.

Absolutely deeeeelicious!  
I used less wine, used frozen shrimp, added more garlic, added diced tomatoes and broccoli and it was excellent.  So easy to make as well.  Thank you!!!  5 star recipe

Really enjoyed this one.  So simply and quick and everyone loved it.    I doubled the garlic and used the entire cup of white wine despite what some of the reviews said and it was YUM.  Will totally make this again.

Great Flavor, the wine is critical.  I used more garlic and some olive oil too.  Make sure you reduce the wine sauce some.  you want to burn off the alcohol.

Dang! That was pretty good. I used a sweet white instead (what I had was a Reisling) and that made it just right sweet to me. My wife licked her plate... really. She wants to have it once a week. Me, I'm not usually that fond of shrimp but I found this went down too easy. Definitely a 5 star for ease and taste.

Ah, this was so good. I used frozen cooked (peeled and deveined) shrimp. I felt like gobbling it all up when I was sauteing it in the butter sauce... it smelled so GOOD! I didn't add any wine, I upped the garlic, and I used parsley flakes (dried parsley) since that was all I had. And I dumped that in the sauce, too. Very pretty presentation and the shrimp scampi didn't last very long! Also, don't forget the Parmesan! Doesn't taste the same without it. I like adding some extra Parmesan and parsley on top of my pasta.

I took the advice to use half the butter and a quarter cup of olive oil and it turned out great. The kids devoured it and me and my husband added lots of crushed red pepper which really made it taste great. I think I will double the shrimp next time because we all love them so much.

I doubled the shrimp from what the recipe called for, and only changed a couple of minor things: I halved the wine, as well as the butter, but added the other half in olive oil. I also added 2-3 tablespoons of flour to thicken the sauce, and a splash of lemon juice.  This is a great base for customizing to personal tastes, but the original would have been fine too (I couldn't taste the wine enough halved, so I will use the full amount in the future). I highly recommend! Simple and tasty.

This was awesome.  I always hesitate to say how good something is and then tell what I changed.  But after reading the reviews, I did take the advice of others on a few things.  I only used 1/2 cup of wine, 1/4 teaspoon lemon pepper instead of just black pepper and added 1-2 tablespoons of fine bread crumbs to thicken the sauce.  Very tasty dish and will absolutely  make again.

Made this scampi, this past holiday weekend, it was terrific with the 2 porterhouse steaks for 4 of us.  Made this with 1lb of thin linguine, used 3 cloves short of a whole head of garlic, which was perfect for this scampi dish.  Wish I had backed off the wine a little bit, but my wife thought it was fine.  Next time I will use just half the wine, other than that the dish was perfect.  I used wild 16/20 shrimp.

Very good scampi recipe! For those who thought the wine flavor was too strong, please be sure to do these two things... 1st, use a good quality white wine that you would enjoy by the glass and 2nd, you need to cook this long enough for the wine to reduce by about half instead of the mere 30 seconds stated in the recipe. And if you're a lover of garlic, as we are, make sure to use 4 LARGE cloves! I would also recommend a big squeeze or two of lemon juice to the finished product, but that is my personal preference. I did not have any parsley on hand so I substituted fresh chives instead and it was indeed DELICIOUS!!!

I thought this recipe lacked flavor but my husband loved it so I am rating it with four stars. I will try this again but I will make a few alterations. I will put some lemon juice and some EVOO.

This was quite good! I would give 4 1/2 stars if I could. For me, the only reason it was not a 5-star recipe was that I feel a lot more could be added for flavor, but as others stated it's a great starter recipe. I didn't measure anything. I typically cook on instinct, and it works out. A LOT of garlic was used, as well as butter and wine. I added chopped roma tomatoes at the endwhen I tossed everything. DO NOT use shredded parmesan because it will clump up (my hunny bought the wrong thing, but I tried to make it work). I used a LOT of lemon, and more chopped parsley than it recommended. In the end, it still seemed something was missing, but I really don't know what. Suggestions?

Shrimp Scampi is such a simple dish - I normally freestyle it but I thought this time I would try a real recipe to get the proportions just right.   I really liked this one.   I used unsalted butter and added some salt when cooking the shrimp.   I always cook with shortcuts and usually make scampi using pre-chopped garlic.   I bought a few cloves of fresh ones and chopped it myself - its a HUGE difference.  The garlic taste is more prominent (in a good way) and the garlic has a more fresh and bright taste to it.    I also microwaved some peas for a minute and tossed them in.   I also added some sliced up sun-dried tomatoes.   The only thing you should watch with this recipe - is the cooking time.   I should have just trusted my instinct and pulled my shrimp off sooner.  Shrimp over-cook so quickly.  The 3 to 5 mins stated here really depends how small or big of shrimp you have.

Absolutely delicious with the fresh wild caught (Alaska) shrimp I just got today.  I made only a single serving and added a generous pinch of red pepper flakes to the garlic and shrimp as they were sauteeing.   Just...lovely.  The calories are awful though!!  And still, I enjoyed every bite of pure decadence.

My family loved this recipe! I did take a few of the suggestions in other reviews, such as adding lemon juice and olive oil. I also added broccoli and roasted red peppers. I found the consistency to be a bit too runny so I added 1/2 tbsp of flour and a pinch of salt and this was a perfectly creamy shrimp scampi!!!

followed other reviewers' recs to cut the wine to 1/2 c, added 1/4 c lemon juice, threw in a little extra garlic - it's a good, solid dish, but it's still missing something I can't put my finger on.

This was delicious and definitely a keeper. It was easy to scale down to serve one, and I made it when my husband was out of town. He will love this when I make it for him! I liked the idea from another reviewer to use half butter/half olive oil, and I used more parsley than it calls for. Thanks for this great way to cook our wonderful gulf shrimp.

I thought this was pretty good. I used olive oil instead of butter and I think I would cut the wine in 1/2 next time as it was kind of runny. Super easy, which is ideal and my husband loved it.

Very good. I made this for my parents for their Anniversary. I sauteed a red onion with the garlic and used half wine and half chicken broth as others suggested. I also added some crushed red pepper for a little kick. This was certainly not bland as some others mentioned. I would certainly make this again.

WOW! This turned out great with my additions. I used raw shrimp: let it sit in the wine and black pepper for 30 minutes. Used EVOO and a spoon of butter. Added a lot of red pepper flakes and about 2 Tbsp of lemon juice. Also used about 1/2 cup of the reserve water from the pasta to help thicken it up. It was delicious!

This was so simple, easy and tasty. I added about a tablespoon of flour to make it a little more saucy and thick, added parsley and used a touch less wine. Next time I would probably add some fresh spinach right at the end.     Great recipe though. But, as my boyfriend mentioned though, it's pretty hard to make anything with wine, garlic butter and shrimp taste bad!

I've made this twice.  The first time it was restuarant quality.  The second time it wasn't as good but that had to be a mistake on my part because like I noted, I had made it before and the recipe was really great.  Worth a try if you have the ingredients on hand.

Another solid recipe...quick and easy. Many thanks. Perhaps the reviewers that found this on the bland side are not adding salt? You simply cannot cook a protein without it and expect it to taste good. I would suggest to cut down on the parmesan at the end and salt/pepper your meats, fish, fowl while sauteing. Even if not included in the recipe always remember to salt, Kosher salt is preferred. You would not bake a cookie without it so you should never cook without it...it brings out the flavor in everything.

This makes shrimp an easy and less intimidating ingredient to work with. I have been challenged with scampis before and could easily accidentally overcook the shrimp. This recipe will please any shrimp lover. I sprinkle fresh chopped parsley, basil and cilantro over the serving platter of pasta & shrimp. Fresh grated parmesan and/or diced campari tomatoes are also a wonderful compliment. High five on your Shrimp Scampi 5 (V)!

This was just ok. A little bland.. I added more garlic then called for but that still didn't help. I wouldn't use this recipe for scampi again.

The recipe was good, however, i felt that it was kind of bland.  I added some garlic salt to it and it gave it the "pick me up" that I think it deserved.  Thanks for sharing.

If you're using raw shrimp I recommend cooking them for exactly 3 minutes, plus the 30 seconds in the wine. If you're using cooked shrimp add them at the very end. You don't want to cook them more than they need or they'll get rubbery. I substituted 3/4c chicken broth and 1/4c lemon juice for the wine. If you want to thicken the sauce at the end, add in the parmesan cheese and mix it in well.   This was such a delicious dish, best shrimp scampi pasta I've ever had!

I loved this recipe! It was delish! And  so easy! I too used some of the suggestions from other reviews. I used precooked frozen shrimp and sauteed them in margarine(instead of butter)with garlic. I sprinkled in some lemon juice, added half chicken stock and half white wine, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, parsley and let it simmer. The sauce was still a little thin so I mixed some more chicken stock and white wine together with some corn starch - it thickened up quite nicely. I will definitely make this one again!

Yum..YUM!!  This was so good :)  I made a few changes based on the feedback I read.  First of all I used  pre-cooked shrimp (med-large size). I soaked them in water with lemon juiced until I was ready to use them.  While they were soaking, I melted 1/4 c butter and sauted 1 med size portabella mushroom in the butter.  To this I added 2 times the amount of garlic (fresh minced), 3/4 c white wine, 1/4 c lemon juice and 1/4 cup half and half.  I then added the cooked shrimp (be careful to not over cook the shrimp).  After about 2 minutes, I added a bit of dried parsley and 1/4+ cup parm. cheese.  I then mixed it with the pasta.  Wow!! I really liked this.  The sauce was a little thin, but we used a spoon to make sure we had sauce with every bite.

The was super easy and quick to make.  Everyone ate it up too!  (Even my picky 6 year old).  At first I worried that the sauce was really thin but it ended up being okay.  I did only do 1/4 c wine, 1/2 c broth, and 1/4 c lemon juice.

this was a great quick and easy dish!!  will definitely make this again soon.  i used some olive oil to replace some of the butter, might try all olive oil next time.  i only put about 2 cloves of garlic and it was plenty!  didn't have fresh parsley, but i think that would make it even better!

My boyfriend and I both loved this.  I added some scallops, mushrooms and red pepper.  I also used chicken broth because I did not have any wine on hand.  I let it sit for a while so it would thicken some, but I think the flavor was great regardless.  Will definitely make again!!

I agree with other commenters that the sauce is a little soupy. I only used half a cup of wine, put in way more parm than called for, and even added a generous amount of cornstarch. I went with what others suggested and put extra garlic, good choice. Husband liked it, and so did I (the resident picky eater) so it will definitely be made again. Thanks!

The recipe was good but the sauce seemed a but thin. Also, please make sure you use a proper cooking wine in this recipe. I made the mistake of using a port wine and the smell/taste of the port was a bit overwhelming (but that was my fault).

I added 1/4 tsp lemon juice and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Next time I will try doubling both. I used a garlic press instead of mincing the garlic (yes a lot faster). Easy and fast recipe, worth a try.

I printed this recipe in 2005 and tried several other shrimp scampi recipes here and there. This is by far, the BEST one yet (delicious). I mix the drained pasta into the large shrimp mixture saucepan before I transfer it to my large pasta serving bowl.

My DH is the scampi afficianado here, and he just wasn't impressed at all. He ate it, but he said not to make this one again. I don't eat shrimp, so I am rating this based on his opinion. I don't think he liked the white wine much and missed the crushed red pepper I usually use in scampi. I've never used wine in scampi before, that was a new one to me, hubby didn't like it so I won't do it again. I also usually use twice as much garlic and some fresh squeezed lemon. I did use real salted butter in this one. I will point out though that he did eat seconds on this one regardless of his not caring much for it.

I just tried this recipe and I'm very happy with it. The wine gives it a nice flavour, and the amount of garlic was plenty, but not too much. A very delicious, yet quick and easy meal that my daughter and I both loved!

Super fast, super yummy recipe for quick shrimp scampi! Great way to save time and money versus going out for dinner, without much compromise on taste... I used chk broth instead of wine (had none on hand) and upped the garlic for personal preference. My boyfriend and I both loved it. Definitely making it's way into the dinner rotation... Oh, BTW, several of the negative reviews of this recipe mention altering the amt of lemon juice, which isn't in the recipe... maybe they reviewed the wrong one?

I found this recipe to absolutely delicious!  I kept the servings at 4.  I added two whole chopped tomatoes, a small (2oz?) bottle of cappers and stirred in parmesan cheese while saut√©ing the shrimp.  I ate the leftovers the next day, mmmmmmmmmmmm!

This is an excellent recipe.  I have also used this recipe without the pasta then let the liquids cook down before adding the parmesan, again excellent.  I will use this every time, it's a winner!!!

This was amazing. I only made 1/2 a recipe for two people. Because of previous raters mention of a strong wine flavor, I boiled the wine with the butter, garlic and added scallions and chopped tomato, for about 5 minutes or so. It was perfect! I even forgot to add lemon. We will definitely make this again!

This was good, even though one of my daughters didn't like it.  I used Hokkien noodles instead of angel hair pasta, as that is what I had.  Also cocktail prawns instead of shrimp, because shrimp is not always available. Turned out pretty good, served with garlic bread.

Omitted the parmesan cheese, since it sounded like it would taste odd. Also added a little salt, and used whole wheat pasta. Loved it- definitely a keeper!

I served this to the in-laws last night for dinner. No one really commented on it, good or bad. I take that as an "it was OK". I thought it was good but have had better. I'm not sure what it was lacking. Definitely good though.

This was a good base recipe but since it needed so much work I could not give it a higher rating. My family loved the scampi but I added 2 Tbsp of lemon juice, decreased the wine to 1/4 cup and added a swirl of olive oil. I also added 1/2 of bell seasoning (which gave it, its favoring, otherwise it would have been very bland)

We really enjoyed this one but since I cook to taste, I made a few modifications.  Instead of the entire quantity of butter, we used 1/4 cup of margarine and 1/4 cup garlic infused olive oil.  Also, I used approx. 8 oz. of canned diced tomatoes and 2 1/2 tablespoons of seasoned breadcrumbs to thicken the sauce a bit.  This was so great, my wife and I are negotiating who gets the leftovers!  Enjoy!

Luxurious and easy to prepare. Not a dish to serve everyday or if you're on a diet.  But rivals restaurant fare for special.

This was great. And ultra quick. I had dinner to the table in 15 minutes flat. I also used diet butter to reduce the fat. It still tasted wonderful.

I don't cook, but I made this one night for my anniversary and my hubby loved it. My son didn't though. Overall I think it was fairly easy and it tastes great.

This was good, a little on the watery side though.
Maybe next time I'll add less wine, or even leave it out.

Followed the recipe to the letter. The final result was terribly bland. It tasted like I was eating oily noodles with non-flavored shrimp. Definitely needs more seasoning to give it some personality.

My complaint has to do with needing to measure ‚Äú2 cups‚Äù of the pasta.  Short of breaking the pasta into 2‚Äù pieces before cooking, how does one do that?  I just guessed and it came out ok.  The end result was very tasty though.

I followed the recipe, cut the butter in half and added 1/2 cup of olive oil.  Easy, tastey. MIght toss a pinch of cayenne next time, but this is th basic bones of shrimp scampi.

It was soupy in the end. But I just used a little of the juice over top of the shrimp.  The flavor was very good.

I did a very novel thing and followed the recipe, I don't know how I can rate a recipe if I change it into a new recipe.  I am not fond of Shrimp Scampi, lets start there but my hubster requested it so I settled on this recipe as looking like my best choice.  It was easy and straight forward.  He said it was exactly what he'd been dreaming about so I guess that makes it a success and a 5 star.  The cooking time seemed exactly right for perfect shrimp.  The taste was mild, the flavors blended together well.

This is delicious! I had to change it a little because I don‚Äôt have wine on hand. I substituted the wine for 3 tbsp lemon juice and I also added a small amount of finely chopped onion. I like a little more flavor so added a small amount of Badia Complete Seasoning as well. :) you can‚Äôt go wrong using this recipe! Yummmm!

This one is very good. It is important to note that this one lives or dies by the quality of the wine. Basically it‚Äôs just butter and wine for this sauce with garlic to carry the shrimp. . It is essential to let the sauce cook ever so slightly to that it sticks to the pasta and thickens and just gently lends a garlic and acid flavor to the pasta.   I would recommend removing the shrimp before adding the wine to prevent it from getting rubbery and over cooked. This helps with presentation and portions anyway.

This was very simple and good.  I would have given it 5 stars if the sauce was a little thicker/creamier - it was tasty, just a little too watery.  I didn't want to boil it too long and over cook the shrimp. Next time I'll take a closer look at other reviews to see what they may have added to give it a little more depth.

Good recipe for basic dish. Made scampi before but forgot recipe and used this to jog my memory.  Combining this with what I did in the past I switched to 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup butter to add flavor and help keep from browning.  I also minced half a shallot and saut√©ed that with the garlic.  Juiced a lemon and threw that in with the wine.  Omitted the cheese and served that on the side at table. garnished with some diced tomato as well as parsley for more color and a bit of contrast in taste and texture.

Great quick & easy recipe! I cooked the shrimp in a combination of EVOO & butter. I also increased the garlic & added onion as a personal preference. I will make this again.

Followed recipe to a tee, except for the pasta which I substituted with white rice pasta.  Overall, we thought this was a bit bland.  I think it needed more spices and lemon juice to add some acidity.  The timing on the shrimp was perfect.  I would use the base recipe, but look for another recipe to enhance flavor.

Made this last night for my college girl on home break who requested "ANYTHING cooked that is NOT pizza, tacos, or chicken fingers!" ... this was amazing!  Doubled the recipe and used white cooking wine instead of chardonnay and came out perfect.  College girl LOVED it!  Will become part of my "regular go to" recipes!  Thanks for a great dish!

This recipe was easy and delicious. I did, however, back off of the white wine to 1/2 cup, per previous reviews. I also added a diced kumato tomato and a squeeze of lemon at the end. It was perfection!

Taste was good but it was a really liquidy wet scampi. I tried to cook off more of the wine but since the shrimp was already added it wound up over cooking the shrimp. I don't think I'll be cooking this recipe 'as is' again. I'll probably have to adjust it .

I made this just as the recipe called for and it was delicious!  The extra juice was absorbed by the cheese once added at the end so all the wine was needed.  I will absolutely be making this again.

Great base recipe to work with! I did not care for the amount of wine flavor (and I love wine) so I had to improvise at the end and pull the shrimp out so as to not overcook; I then poured out some of the liquid, added more butter again, and added salt. Like others, I diced Roma tomatoes and added them as a garnish. The fresh parsley was delicious. Next time I will add some lemon juice and substitute some of the butter with olive oil as many suggest. Thank you for a great starter recipe!

Easy and quick.   Very good recipe.  I suggest to give it the proper flavor is to add a splash of lemon at the end to serve.  The lemon gives it a subtle flavor that makes it sing.

This was fantastic. I did use 1/2 cup Pinot Grigio and 1/2 cup of lemon juice simply because we love lemon. I have made this several times and even the kids love it.  It drives me crazy when people make all of these changes to a recipe then give it 3 Stars. It‚Äôs the main reason why I don‚Äôt post my recipes. Kuddos to those that do.

Instead of white wine, I used half a cup of white wine vinegar and added a teaspoon of lemon juice to give it a tiny of citrus flavor.

We really liked it.  I ended up with more liquid than I thought I needed so I drained a little of it off the pasta and shrimp combo before I added the parmesan and parsley.. I reserved the left over liquid in case I might need it then or for reheating leftovers.  Definitely would make it again.

This was very tasty, but a little over the top on butter.  Next time, I‚Äôll use less and maybe add more garlic.

Basic and very simple recipe, which always to me are the best recipes that you can adjust to suit your needs. Made as stated, this version I used cilantro and brined the jumbo shrimp for half an hour in Kosher salt and Baking Soda (Keeps the Shrimp Moist and adds that perfect Snap). Thank You again.

I doubled this recipe, added the juice of one lemon before cooking shrimp. I remove the shrimp right before they are completely done and then I add wine, pepper and parsley to the pan. I let that come to a light boil then thicken slightly with one tsp of flour premixed in a couple ounces of water.  Then I add the shrimp back in for under a minute to put some heat back on them then pour on top of pasta. This recipe is easy and delicious!!!

The 5 stars are for the original recipe.  We've made it many times now with changes (below).  The changes would probably drop it to a 4 but still so good, just lighter.  
I use a little less than 1/4 c butter, 1/4 c evoo
dreamfields pasta
a palm-full of cheese, maybe a little less than 1/2 c
unsalted chicken broth instead of the wine
Pre-cooked shrimp I season with salt and pepper,  and add it to the pan just before I toss in the pasta.  

The precooked shrimp was an accident, i pulled out my bag and realized I grabbed the wrong package.  But it was a happy accident because it's turned this into a lightning fast weeknight meal.  I don't usually like the texture of precooked shrimp cooked into other dishes, but this I leave out to come up to room temp and slide it in at the end so it doesn't get chewy or weird.

Not my favorite recipe for shrimp scampi.  To much butter for the amount of pasta and shrimp.  The sauce needs to reduce but you can't do that while cooking the shrimp at the same time.  I also think you need diced onion and lemon juice in scampi.  I reduced the white wine to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup lemon juice.  The next time I make scampi, I will not use this recipe.  Nice try though.

Don‚Äôt follow the direction on the shrimp. You cannot cook shrimp for 7 to 10 minutes. Add the shrimp after you add the wine and only for the last three minutes. Once shrimp turn pink it‚Äôs done.

Wonderful, simple!  Don't peel the shrimp! It's where the flavor is!!! Try it!  Sautee garlic in olive oil, add wine, reduce, then add butter.  Butter could burn if added earlier.  I used a chardonnay first time I made this and it turned out savory and delicious. The second time I made it I used a Pinot Grigio and I hated it! I was too sweet and sour. But to each their own.  I doubled the sauce the second time I made it, including the garlic, and let it boil a while, reduce, before I added the shrimp.  You could add the shrimp to cook before reducing, remove shrimp when cooked and peel while sauce continues reducing.  I used Angel Hair pasta.  As a vegetable side or inclusion, chop asparagus into 1.5-2 inch pieces and lightly steam with water.  All three of my very picky children gobbled it down and rated it a solid 8! Definitely a keeper for me!

Used 1/2 the butter and accidentally added parmesan while cooking. Not such a great idea as it got clumpy. Also added broccoli and mushrooms. Someone else said red bell pepper was good and I think it would be a nice addition too. OF course adding those veggies makes it more like a stir fry and less like scampi.

Made this for  a meat free dinner alternative.  Fabulous!!!  Served it over white rice because my family is not a big fan of pasta.  Cesear salad and baguette to round out the meal.  Can't wait to make it again.

I followed the recipe.  At the end I had too much liquid in the pan - 30 seconds does not reduce 1 cup of wine very much.
Nothing in the recipe mentions what to do with the stuff in the pan.  I felt that it wasn't garlicky enough, so I added adobo to the plate.   Seems like a waste of good wine too.  I think I would do as others and just add chicken stock and take the shrimp out while sauce reduces.  Will not make it again as published.

Wow! so easy, too!  I reduced the butter a bit, and it was fine.  I also threw in several handfuls of fresh spinach to wilt at the end, and my family loved it.  Ok, so it's not health food, but if you add a bunch of spinach,  it helps :-)

This tasted as authentic  as any you will find at a restaurant, we loved it! I added some chopped onion and mushroom- not a lot- with the butter and garlic. I ran out of bulb garlic and used 3 tsp. Kirkland granulated garlic,  tasted great!

I agree with the review that complained about people who don't make the recipe as listed and then bad mouth the recipe, but I'm almost 70 and I usually know what I will and will not like in a recipe as it's written. Typically I make a recipe exactly as written the first time, if it's something I'm unfamiliar with or I think has an interesting twist.  With this recipe, I knew that I would rather have half butter and half olive oil, because I've been making this dish for most of my adult life, so I made it my way rather than strictly by the recipe but I'm giving it five stars because I think it's a great basic recipe. The oil does help the butter not burn and it gives a better more louscious mouth feel to the sauce.  I also saut√©ed the minced garlic and a half tsp of red pepper flakes for a few minutes until it's very fragrant before adding the shrimp, and I do remove the shrimp so that they don't get overcooked while the sauce reduces for a few minutes over a high heat. I just let them rest on top of the pasta and then when the reduction looks perfect I toss them back in with the pasta. Wonderfully quick and easy and so tasty!

I adjusted the recipe by halving the butter and adding about a 1/4 cup of olive oil.   During the cooking of the shrimp I added about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and added about 2 tablespoons fresh basil instead of the parsley. ( I know in true scampi fashion parsley is added to the dish but I prefer the taste of basil)

This was pretty tasty with a few modifications. I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil. I also cut the wine down to 1/2 a cup.  I slightly cooked  the shrimp in a little bit of ollive oil, before getting the sauce together, and set the shrimp aside. I then made the sauce, let it cook down a bit, then added the shrimp at the very end to avoid the shrimp overcooking. It was a fairly simple and tasty dish!

Some scampi recipes are too buttery but this one I could taste the wine with the garlic & butter and it was delicious!  I will make this one again & again!

I used the suggested half butter with 1/4 cup olive oil.  I would use much more garlic. And possibly reduce the wine before adding to the rest.

2 tablespoons of butter and maybe 1/2 a cup of wine. One cup of wine was way too much. It did not cook down. You do not want to overcook the shrimp! Otherwise it would have been good. Also do you consider Chardonnay to be dry?

Followed the recipe, no substitutions. Wasn't impressed with the end result. Hubby thought it was ok, I will keep searching for another recipe.

Great recipe---made for my son's 23rd birthday dinner and at his request I used fettucini.   I also used half the butter as I always try to cut down on fat.   It was well loved by everyone who ate it.   Definitely a keeper!   I did use 16/20 shrimp to make it a bit more special than using smaller shrimp.   And yes, the cooking instructions for the shrimp are perfect--nice and short to keep them tender.

This is the second time I've made it and I will continue to make it. I did forget to buy angel hair pasta, so I had to use regular spaghetti pasta, which worked fine.  Just remember, this recipe is easy and cooks fast. So make sure you grate Parmesan, mince garlic and chop parsley before starting the shrimp cooking.  Also, if your serving salad and bread with it, be sure to prepare those ahead as well.

This is the first Shrimp Scampi I have ever made. It was good and we enjoyed it overall, however, were a bit disappointed. Understandably this could be due to the fact that as noted, I'd never had it prior to this and don't know good from bad Shrimp Scampi. 

It seemed a bit watery and very much like pasta that had a strong wine taste with shrimp that were clearly over cooked and not much else. 

In any event, we did enjoy it but next time I will research a different scampi recipe to compare.

I thought this was a very simple basic version of shrimp scampi! But also fantastic! I have now made it 3x but the last time I made this I had to cut back to 1/3 cup of wine instead of the full cup, my children would be eating it (they now have a love for shrimp) and they are extremely picky with very big bold wine and lemon flavors. The 1/3 cup of wine made a huge difference in taste but i think it may have been better to use less wine, since I used less wine I took 2 lemon wedges and squeezed them in! It was amazing!! The smell in the house cooking this dish is mout watering. I have made several different shrimp scampi recipes and I think this one is the best even tho it's very simple. It's extremely easy to make. Once you try it the way it says in the recipie you then can alter the ingredient to your liking. I know my GF made this but she added bread crumbs to the sauce. It was good but not my cup of tea. I like a lot of garlic! This recipie is so good I'm actually making it again tonight. But this time I'm adding sea scallops! Thanks for the recipie!

I like this recipe.  I followed the recipe except I added additional fresh ground pepper, little salt, a little less wine.  I used whole grain angel hair pasta.  I served with fresh steamed broccoli and it was a wonderful meal.  My husband , who is a bit of a "foodie", really enjoyed the meal.  I also used fresh grated Parmesan cheese and squeezed a little fresh lemon juice over plate.  The fresh ingredients made this dish sing.  I'll definitely make again!

Real basic version of a classic, I like mine with a little more flavor. That being said my wife likes basic flavors and this was a hit. I did add 7 cloves on the garlic and two sticks of butter and 1.75 lbs of shrimp. I used 3/4 of the angel hair as well. We will be making this again!

I'm new to cooking and I must say this was very easy to make, only negative is I wished the video had someone talking over it so I can hear instead of rewinding the video. I added garlic and herb ms dash seasoning to my shrimp for added flavor and used 1/2 cup of wine because of what others said and it was absolutely amazing.

I made this last night. I didn't have any angel hair pasta so I used linguini instead. I used less butter, maybe 1/4 cup, and added some olive oil to it. Delicious! Next time I  will use more garlic and add some fresh lemon juice.

Simple recipe and good. However I wouldn't add the shrimp til the very end after you have added all the other ingredients. The shrimp cook up fast and making the recipe as written they were over done.

We buy the Sea Pak brand shrimp scampi every so often but is expensive and doesn't really have enough shrimp for 2 people.  I decided to come to allrecipes (once again) to find a homemade version.   This was delicious and tasted better than any I had made before.  Don't change the recipe.  It's perfect.

It was great! Followed the recipe, I just added 1/4 cup of lemon juice. I also followed someone's suggestion to remove the shrimp and allow the wine to cook down for a tad more time. It was yummy!

Easy recipe. I used the amounts of ingredients called for in the recipe. Reducing the sauce by about half once the wine is added was the right call for us. That may have ben the intention of the author, but it is helpful to mention since some people may not be very experienced with sauces.

This was very bland to me.  I meant to squeeze a lemon over the top before serving and forgot as it was not on the recipe.  Maybe that would have helped.

Wow, I think this is my new favorite dish, but I did make it better after reading MANY of the positive and negative reviews. Our family likes flavor and sauces and many of the negative reviewers said it needed more flavor.   First of all, I used 1 1/2 to 2 pounds of shrimp because everyone loved the shrimp. I used about 3/4 stick of butter and 1/4 cup expensive basil olive oil. I upped the garlic too because everyone said to do that. I used just over half the wine and added lemon juice which my boys loved.  I only had cooked shrimp so I knew I needed to be careful of cooking it too long. So I saut√©ed the butter, garlic, olive oil along with Italian seasonings and basil. Then I added my cooked shrimp just to make sure it was heated.  I even added 3 little coffee creamers from Super America because I had them left over and I thought the cream flavor would be good.  I also used a decent amount of lemon pepper for the pepper and salt to taste.

I had to make subtle changes based on what I had on hand.  I used about 6 TBSP butter, added 2 TBSP lemon juice concentrate,  and the only wine we had was red.  I used 3/4 cup based on other reviews saying it was too much.  I also reduced the parmesan cheese to 1/2 cup.  It was really good.  I  thought the amount of parmesan cheese was plenty of flavor, and the red wine was great.  I should have added the whole cup of wine, since it was a little dry.  Still, I'd make it again just as I did before, or try it with white wine.

This was good, but very rich, and had a lot of flavor, but not a lot of depth to it. After adding more pepper it was much better, but not really one I'll rush to make again.

Very good.  Used dried parsley in sauce since I didn't have fresh, and cooked, previously frozen shrimp.  Served with bruschetta for a well rounded meal.  Added a dash of salt.  Had tons of pasta left over.  There was not a lot of sauce in this recipe so advise serving over plain pasta (do not mix and then serve).  We also skipped the Parmesan.

We made this and it was delicious!  We added some cream to it.  It had to much liquid, so we let it set for a little bit.  It soaked the liguid up and was perfect. Great warmed up also. Will make this again.

It lacked flavor.  I think you would need to add lemon or something so it doesn't taste like plain buttered noodles.

What's good: Very simple and fast to prepare

What isn't: The butter taste was way too present for my taste. But I did not drain the mixture from the shrimp right away. I'll try it again with that adjustment, to see if it fixes it.

I used 2Tbsp butter and 2Tbsp olive oil to saut√© the garlic an shrimp.  Since I had some garden vegetables, I added kernels and milk from 2 fresh ears of corn and a cup of sliced cherry tomatoes, some lemon zest and juice from 1/2 lemon.   I substituted pinch of red pepper flakes for pepper--liked the extra zing.  I garnished with chopped parsley and fresh lemon thyme. My husband loved this dinner.

I feel like all the best recipes are the most simple. This was simple to make. Delicious!   I have a house full. All 9 loved it. Even my shrimp haters. 

I used Pinot Grigio and 4 tsp of freeze dried garlic (We could through a lot of garlic, it beats having to chop it every night.) We will definitely make again.

I tried this and my family said it now takes the place of their favorite over all of my dishes!  I used the whole cup of wine but I selected a medium body Chardonnay to balance the taste.  I also added the jiuce of 1/2 lemon to the shrimp before adding to the mix.  I also used an entire package of pasta (12oz) which may be why the wine was not too much.  Next time I make this, I'll add more shrimp though.  26 oz (1 1/2 lbs) of fresh shirmp only cleaned out to 13 oz.

Great recipe! Quick and simple to make after a hectic day. I did cut the wine down to only 1/2 cup and added a twist of lemon! We are trying to lose some weight and cutting back on carbohydrates so I did not serve with pasta. I put the shrimp in a bowl, poured the sauce on top, sprinkled with parsley, Parmesan cheese and a twist of lemon and served! It was delightful! I will definitely make this again for my family!

Very very good. I doubled the garlic, used 1/2 cup wine 1/3 cup fresh lemon. Used Half the butter called for and added with 1/4 olive oil to reduce fat.

Loved it! I made 4 lbs of jumbo shrimp and adjusted the recipe accordingly. I switched out and used organic black bean pasta and steamed broccoli. I also took the cooked shrimp out of the sauce and cooked down the wine just a little bit more. And yum!! Family loved it!

Made this exactly as written. It was good but I wish I had read the reviews before making. I would have reduced the wine by half. As written the amount of wine made the sauce too runny and it would not stick to the pasta or shrimp.
Next time I will cut it in half or, since angel hair pasta only takes about 3-4 minutes, I might just cook it in the pan with the wine sauce. If I do this I will revise my review.

Update, I made this again and used half the wine. It was delicious both times. I also cooked the pasta first this time since shrimp can become overcooked in the blink of an eye.  The danger of this recipe is that it is so fast, easy and good that I have to keep myself from making it too often so we don't grow tired of it.

I love shrimp scampi.. But never made it.  One day i was gifted w a 5 lb box of jumbo shrimp so i decided it was time to try.  I didnt have EVOO.. Nor garlic cloves.. Nor wine !!   I used crisco, garlic powder and champagne instead... and it turned out GREAT !!   I'll definately make it again !!

I made as directed except I doubled the recipe but only used 1/2 cup of butter. Everyone seemed to like it at the table, but I thought it was lacking something. I will try a different recipe next time.

Outstanding. The only chaanges I made was to add a little more salt, 1/4 tspn red pepper, shallot and instead of a full cup of wine, 1/2 wine and 1/2 seafood stock. This ones a keeper.

Made exactly as specified--mine came out more like an alfredo than a scampi.  My kids were disappointed, but my husband and I enjoyed it.

Delicious! I will be making this again.  I used Moscato because I had it. Nice taste. Next time I will either double the sauce or make half as much pasta. The sauce is very good!

Not as good as restaurant shrimp scampi, but still delicious and satisfying for family. I've made this recipe many times and always comes out well. I do cut the white wine in half and sometimes thicken sauce with a small amount of cornstarch because the sauce is very thin. I don't measure the parsley or the Parmesan cheese as some don't like Parmesan cheese on theirs.

Very good and easy recipe.  To get good flavor from wine I saut√©ed garlic then added wine and simmered until wine reduced by half.  Then I added other ingredients.  Also I used only 1/4 cup butter.  Thanks RN

Really easy and delicious. This is my moms famous dish so I made it for her when she came over expecting comments about what could have or should have been better and I got none. Only compliments.  She usually puts a head of garlic in her recipe and sautes it first for a while and watching me commented that it wasn't going to be enough and the garlic should cook longer by itself, but the flavors came together wonderfully and won her over. Nice!

I started to make it as is, then confused my brain with my Chicken French recipe. So I added about 2 Tbl of lemon juice,  about 2-3 oz. pineapple juice, 1/2 tsp garlic powder ( in addition to the fresh garlic), 1 tsp chicken base.  I added about 1/4 cup of the parmesan cheese and saved the rest for the table.  I used chardenay wine.  My husband said it was the best he had and to make it like this again!  A mistake that came out good!!

I love this recipe. I added two more cloves of garlic and used Smart Balance Butter instead of regular butter. I also used wine with lemon flavor. It was a big hit at the dinner table!

Excellent. I did as another rater suggested and used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup butter. Didn't have fresh parsley, had to use dried, and also added dried basil. Also, I used linguine instead of angel hair pasta, and I added lemon juice to the sauce.

I made this Wednesday might. I don't eat seafood, so I am always afraid to cook it. My husband loved it. The one thing I would do differently is use less butter and would use a little olive oil.

Great recipe.  Had to cut back on the garlic...used one good sized clove and it was just enough.  I only added the juice of a small lemon as an add in.  Very meat and potatoes boyfriend really liked it.  One add'l comment, saute the shrimp til 3/4's done, remove and add wine...reduce, then add shrimp back in.  Very good scampi recipe.  Thankx

Loved it! Husband tested and approved! :)
I thickened it with a little cornstarch, but a little too much, so then I added a little heavy cream and water which actually made it like a creamy garlic wine sauce! Mmmm!

I sauteed the garlic in butter then added the wine so it would infuse and thicken. I added also 1/2 cup cream. I sauteed the shrimp in another pan with butter and garlic and then added it to the creamy mixture to keep warm. Poured it over the pasta for the family and the shrimp over a salad for me! Delish!

I made the recipe as written. It was good but needed a little something extra. Maybe next time I'll add a dash of Cayanne pepper.

It was reasonably good, but I cut back on the butter considerably and it was still too much. Also, it needed w bit of counterbalance like lemon juice. I used balsamic vinegar which helped the final result.

We absolutely loved this dish.  I had used this recipe once before and the only change I made this time was to increase the wine by half and add a couple tablespoons lemon juice. After adding the wine/juice to the pan, I removed the shrimp so that I could deglaze the pan and reduce the wine a bit, adding an extra intensity to the sauce.  Wow, was this good! I made this for my husband's birthday and he's still raving about it.

I followed the directions as written and the flavor was nice, but the consistency was watery like soup. I will be trying a different shrimp scampi recipe next time.

Easy and delicious.  I used scallops and like other reviewers added lemon juice and a little lemon zest along with salt and pepper.  I sauted the scallops but then took them out to let the wine reduce and then added them and the pasta in.  Tasty.

Made this recipe as-is. It was really good, but a bit heavy on the wine as some of the reviews said. And I liked the idea of putting some broccoli or green veggie to make it a healthier version. I will definitely make this again!

I'm eating this over zucchini noodles with Parmesan as I write this. It's good but it was too runny which watered down the flavor next time I will half it. I didn't have white wine so I used chicken broth, which in itself I'm sure was the main problem, I forgot that it wasn't a strong broth so there wasn't a strong base and I didn't have actual garlic so I used garlic powder but I didn't use enough of it even with those it tastes much better than I thought and actually smells like scampi. It's good over the zucchini noodles as well since the zucchini took up the flavor of the sauce, but I should have use fresh zucchini, I used zucchini I had previously frozen. I will definitely make this again once I get the ingredients I was missing hopefully sometime next week with the adjustment of the wine and it should be the bomb. All in all this was a great high protein low carb dish since I used zucchini instead of actual pasta. My version also had much less calories, around 280, I used 1 tbsp butter and 2 teaspoons olive oil and I may use more butter next time as well.

Just a little too runny for my taste. Perhaps less wine would have helped. It tasted fine, but I would add more garlic next time.

This recipe is wonderful!!  I made a few changes (cut butter in half, 1/2C EVOO, scallions, 1 1/4C white cooking wine, and 1/2C lemon juice), I also added baby bella mushrooms and peas.  This totally reminds me of Pasta Weesie from Carrabba's!!!  A definite keeper!

Made this for dinner tonight. Followed the recipe exactly, except used penne pasta and Romano cheese instead of parmesan. The recipe was quick and easy to follow, except for peeling the shrimp! The sauce comes out pretty thin until it cools, so the pasta and shrimp in the bottom of the bowl/plate are much more flavorful than what comes out on top. You have to stir often while eating. This recipe makes a large quantity and we will have leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

This was a really simple yummy dish. I did exactly what I was told. I do think the wine was a little too much - seems like I could cut it in half next time, as other reviewers have suggested. But the rest was tasty and simple - thanks for the recipe. I will make it again!

Perfect! In fact so perfect my husband and I polished off the entire dish. I did follow the recipe as written using a Pale Dry Sherry as the wine (I keep a large bottle for cooking). I did serve it over spaghetti squash as I am cutting carbs. I would serve it over angel hair pasta as reccomended for guests. The only other change was...we were enjoying it, finished our first serving when I remembered that I forgot to put the cheese on the table. It was so delicious, I skipped it. :)

Really good! I have never made this before and it was so easy! I only used 1/2 cup of wine because that's all I had but it was perfect! Also added onions because we love them.

This was so good and easy to fix.  Personally I don't like wine so next time I will add maybe 3/4 or 1/2 cup. Otherwise I followed the recipe and I will be making this again.

Fixed for my wife on Valentines Day.  This recipe turned out great.  I only wish I knew a better white wine use for this recipe.  The wine I used was a sauvignon blanc which I suspect was not dry enough.  It still turned out good but the wine was sort of overpowering.  It really did not reduce enough so I ended up with too much liquid.  I will fix this again but I will cut back on the amount of wine and try to find one that is drier.

sorry... I followed the recipe almost to  the letter and did not care for it.

the only thing I changed  was I used 1/2 tsp. dried parsley instead  fresh because I was out of fresh.

Good but not great.  We found that it needed salt, perhaps the chef uses salted butter which we do not?  Also required more garlic to really make the flavors pop!

I made this because I had some shrimp I needed to use and it looked simple. I'm not a huge shrimp scampi fan but my husband is and let me tell you, we both loved this! I really liked that it was served with noodles. Yum! We will be making this recipe over and over again!

Tasty and simple, but I would've preferred a more cheesy, flavorful recipe.  Just personal taste! I only had about 1/2 c. of white wine, so I also added some lemon juice.  Good, but I'll keep looking for a creamy, cheesy sauce to suit my family's tastes better.

This was fabulous!  I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 ovoo (and about 1/4 less of both), 1/2 white cooking wine, 1/2 fresh squeezed lemon juice, dried sweet basil, savory sun-dried toms, didn't have angel hair so I used thin spag... it was execellent and I will be making it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

My fiance and I like this dish a lot. Shrimp don't take long to thaw, and the sauce is also very quick and easy to make. (It's delicious too!) The shrimp taste great either cooked in the sauce or grilled (my personal favorite). Like some other reviewers suggested, we sometimes toss some sauteed tomatoes, broccoli, etc into the pasta to make it a bit more filling. Overall, a really easy and tasty meal.

Great recipe! I did change it up a bit as suggested in a couple other reviews - added half of the wine replaced the other half with lemon juice, uped the garlic, added some scallions and broccoli. Delicious!

This is truly a great recipe. I used one cup of chicken broth instead of wine (more flavorful). I reduced the parmesan cheese to 1/3 cup. You can always add more to your plate. It is a wonderful recipe for yourself or company. Thank you. Barbara

Yum! The white wine gave this dish a great flavor. Very easy and delicious but found it to be to greasy (well duh, all that butter-i know!) so next time i think i will use margerine and maybe half the amount and see if that still works.

This recipe was delicious! I didn't have any white wine, so I substituted a cup of water and a chicken bullion cube. I heat the water and melt the cube in it before adding to the shrimp. Very tasty!  I might recommend using less cheese. It was kind of a lot.

With all of the great reviews I expected this recipe to be at least decent. It had no flavor ...was almost like seafood in water with a hint of oil. I would maybe increase the garlic but I don't think that would even help.

On a whim I threw in some sun-dried tomatoes that I had left over from the bruschetta I had made.  If you like sun-dried tomatoes as much as I do I reccommend adding it.

This recipe was a hit with a few adjustments.  I used half butter and half EVOO, along with three extra cloves of garlic and 1/2 small onion.  I then added 1/2 cup of Prego sauce and about 1/4 teaspoon or less of thyme, basil, marjoram, oregano, and salt.  I added a half cup of Riesling, as that was all I had on hand.  There was no angel hair pasta in the pantry, so I used Penne Lisce pasta instead.  The sauce was amazing!  I grated some Parmesan cheese on top and served it with green salad.  My family loved it.  It was quick and easy to prepare and I will be making it again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was fantastic. I didnt have parsley so i used basil, was still good. I did reduce the wine by about half and i used whole wheat pasta and it was great. I think if i had used all the wine i would have needed to up the garlic a little, but the extra wine would have allowed me to put a veggie in there as well, terrific meal all around. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! I used linguini instad of angel hair, and added a little fat free half...and a little more half and half to reheat the next day. It also tasted great as leftovers.

I just made this dish as written except I didn't have any Parmesan cheese...It was good but...to me was lacking enough flavor...I would add the juice of a lemon for 4 servings...and I would also substitute half (or all) olive oil as another reviewer suggested...I also added about a cup of cherry tomatoes sliced in half length-wise...Other than that, I used peeled deveined shrimp...Just had to remove tails...

This is a wonderful recipe! My son requests it every week (he doesn't get it quite that often). My only issue was that it made a lot of liquid. When I make this next, I plan to cut the wine by about 1/3-1/2. Otherwise this is a great basic shrimp scampi recipe.

Very simple recipe and easy to make! Not much preparation needed at all. I forgot to peel the shrimps though and that was quite inconvenient when eating. I will try using larger shrimps next time for a more "restaurant style" shrimp scampi. Highly recommend this recipe!

Needs red pepper flakes to add flavor. Sauce was really thin...very strong wine flavor. Need fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of the canned kind next time.

Excellent Recipe!!  I followed another reviewer's advice and cut back on the butter to 1/4 cup and used 1/4 cup of olive oil to reduce the fat.  It was incredible!!  Thanks for sharing!

This was OK.  It needed a lot more flavor.  I followed the recipe and did not cut back on the wine.  I think if I make it in the future I'll be adding things to it.

Halved the recipe for the bf and I.  Added about a tsp of olive oil to the butter, incresed the butter to 1/3 c, added chopped cherry tomatoes, used 3 cloves garlic and 1/2 c wine.  Also added lemon juice, fresh oregano, basil and chive, and red pepper flakes.  Classic.

Like many other reviewers, it seemed a bit bland when it was done. I used 2 cloves extra garlic and Pinot Grigio (full amount). I ended up adding 4 TBSP lemon juice (all I had) and a dash of garlic salt. I think red pepper flakes would also enhance this more. It came out great with the addition of lemon juice; I would have added a bit more had I had it. Good base dish, as another reviewer said!

I added a little bit of smoked paprika in with the garlic and it gave it a good flavor.  Next time I think I will use a little less wine, but overall it was a good recipie.

I modified this a little by using less wine and more butter because one of my guests does not care for wine. Added more garlic than called for because we love galic, and since I had fresh dill on hand I used that instead of parsley. It was excellent-everyone liked it-including my 4 year old. Will be making it again soon.

So/So...I used a full cup of wine and did not find it that noticeable at ALL. It was pretty bland to tell you the truth...even after adding pepper/salt and parm to it.

This was fantastic and easy. I used half butter half olive oil. I added red peppers, and I think I accidentally left out the parsley. I used a little less wine and also added some flour to thicken it up a little bit. I can't wait to make this again.

Doubled the pasta, doubled the sauce (would've doubled the shrimp, but didn't have enough here) -- I too used more garlic than called for and half the wine and as I had pre-cooked shrimp, I didn't add it to the sauce until right before it was time to serve it - just to reheat -- but in the end, this turned out amazingly well.  My (ULTRA PICKY) 10 year old cleaned her plate and asked when I'd be making this again... (and she NEVER eats ANYTHING).  You're a miracle worker in our family, thanks for posting this one!

Great recipe, with a few changes.  I omit the parmesan, and put in a little less wine (maybe 1/2 - 3/4 cu).  I also add paprika for some spiciness and green onions when cooking the shrimp and garlic.  I serve it all over fettucine noodles.

Great! Bland??? Not mine. It was full of tast. I did follow a lot of the recomendations of others.  The only thing I did that I didn't see mentioned was I sotaid (saw t aid) some diced onions in the lemon butter/olive oil before I added the garlic shrimp.  Next time I'll make my own shrimp stalk instead of using any chicken even though I didnt use much stalk anyway because I like the wine. This can be tweeked in all sorts of ways to suit your fancy which I always think is good. 5 stars!

I thought this was pretty good. I have made it several times and it's always a hit at the table. Pair it with a chunk of bread, a salad, and it's a nice quick, delicious meal.

This was pretty good but it lacked a certain complexity I was looking for. I used a half cup of wine and 1/4 cup lemon juice. I thought it definitely could have use more lemon juice though. I added 6 cloves of garlic and it still was not enough garlic. I also thought maybe some red chili flakes or a fresh herb of some sort would have made the meal even better. Will try again with a few revisions in the future.

Was sooooo good even my very picky 5 year old ate it up. I did follow the 1/2 cup wine and 1/2 cup broth others wrote in their reviews. I will definately make this again. Thanks.

I made this recipe for my father-in-law and we both devoured it.  I did not have fresh garlic on hand, so I ended up using garlic powder.  I also added about 1/3 cup bread crumbs.  The end result was delicious! I served the meal with Cream of Crab soup as an appetizer.  What a compliment to the main course!

I made this recipe with a pound and a half of HUGE shrimp my parents brought back from Florida. Sad to say, it was a waste. I made this recipe due to the great reviews and couldn't be more disappointed. Completely lacked flavor and texture. Don't waste good shrimp on this one!!!!

The best and easiest Shrimp Scampi!

We use 1/2 cup lemon and 1/2 cup chicken broth in place of the wine.

Very easy to make for a special night - I added a tiny bit of red pepper flake for a punch.  I only make half the recipe for myself and my husband and give the kids the other half of the plain pasta.  Thanks!

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the directions to a "T" and  felt that there was way too much Parmesan. The second time I just made the sauce with the shrimp(left out the pasta and Parmesan.) It was delicious. I also halved the wine and added a little bit of lemon juice along with some salt. Yummmyyy

I just finished serving this dish to my family.  It was a HUGE hit.  I tried to keep it to the original recipe, but, I did add lemon juice, only because it was added to all the other ones I read.  I also omitted the cheese, because I DO NOT like it.  What a great recipe!!  I will be making it again, and again, :-)

Well in Louisiana..we have alot of shrimp. Pasta is cheap and most ingrediants are everday stuff. I made it but w/ out the wine..i just didn't have it right then, but I been making this recipe for a while. It's quick, easy. Start to finish about 15-20 min. And is excellent!   must try!!  (use good fresh shrimp-mid size)

My boyfriend and I love this so much that we've made it once a week for a month.  I use a little extra lemon juice and the full amount of wine, because I like the tartness to cut the heavy taste of the butter.

I would have to agree that this recipe was tasty.  However, I followed the advice of others and decreased the butter intake (3/4) and added some mushrooms and garlic (yum).  Unfortunately, I did not have any wine and used chicken broth with a bit of white flour.  I enjoyed it, but is there anyway to decrease the amount of butter and still enjoy this dish?  I do my best of eating healthy and this dish swims in butter.

Great recipe, my boyfriend and I both loved it.  Only added a bit more wine, about 1/4 cup more because we both love sauce.

I just didn't get the bread crumbs that were in a lot of other recipes here for shrimp scampi.  This was a much more true recipe and so easy to make...I probably added more garlic than called for.  Definite keeper in our house!

Definitely use a whole bulb of garlic to get any kind of garlic flavor to it.  Serve immediately as suggested.  Leftovers to not taste good.

I feel like I cooked mine wrong. I've never made shrimp scampi before--are you supposed to drain the shrimp before adding it to the pasta? Mine tasted great but afterwards, there was a huge puddle of butter-garlic-wine left behind on the plate which made the whole dish feel a TINY bit soupy like that liquid should have been thicker. I think if it had a better consistency, the flavor would have been more packed and not so diluted. Probably worth making again if I just figure out how to cook it correctly :)

Delicious and super easy.  Of course I go overboard with the garlic and cheese.  I'm very much into flavor.

Okay I give this recipe a 5! I just made this dinner tonight for me and my husband and it was AMAZING! The only thing I did different was add a little more garlic because I am a garlic lover, and I bought white wine with lemon in it. I would recommend though using a little less wine and parmesan cheese. I followed the recipe to a T, but next time I make it I will use less wine and parm. I absolutely love this recipe!!! The best so far on my list!!

This was really good and my kids loved it!!! I made it with 16oz pasta and took the advice of doing 1/2 wine and 1/2 broth. I also added red pepper flakes. I might try to add a little less butter next time, but not much less. This will be a regular!

My boyfriend enjoyed this dish more than I did.  I used slightly less butter and more garlic.  The consistency seemed off to me somehow...it was a little too dry for my taste.  Maybe the butter that I omitted would have helped.

This was pretty good.  I feel like it was missing something.  I used 1/2c wine and 1/4c lemon juice.  Maybe the parm chz should have been swirled in?  Maybe the garlic needs to be increased?  Maybe it needs some cream?  Not sure what, but for the ease of it, I will definitely put on the regular rotation and keep tweaking.

Delicious!  I just made this and my family are every bite! My husband asked me to add this to the regular "rotation". I made it with only three cloves of garlic and added a little garlic salt as it cooked. I also put a little fresh squeezed lemon juice over the pasta in it's last couple of minutes of cooking. 
Great Dish!

I just made this tonight for my family. They loved it! The only problem I had was that I made a double batch (three teenagers and a hungry Marine). It is far more filling than I had thought and we will be eating this all weekend. The good thing is we don't mind one bit. I did add more shrimp than was called for and mushrooms I substituted broth for wine. Those were the only changes I made and we were very happy with the way it turned out. I will be making this often.

This was very good! I didn't have wine so replaced with 1/3 c. rice wine vinegar. Also added 1/2 tsp. chili pepper flakes for a kick, added half olive oil and butter, also added about 8 fresh garlic cloves. Delicious!

I think the recipe should say 16 oz of pasta not 8 oz because there is too much sauce. I cut all the ingrediants in half except the pasta when I make this. Its all right, nothing to rave about though. It makes a quick dinner.

This smelled absolutely amazing when the garlic and shrimp were cooking and I couldn't help but sneak a few.  I was disappointed when the wine was added though, too much wine taste, and it didn't coat the pasta much at all.  Will not make again.

The first time I made this I pretty much followed the recipe, but used less butter. I thought the sauce was lacking flavor. So, the second time I used a bit more butter but also added some milk and a touch of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I stirred that up well, added the shrimp & garlic, and continued with the recipe. Right after adding the wine, while waiting for the mix to simmer back up, I added generous portions of black pepper and dill weed. The sauce came out better this time, but it was still lacking flavor. 

This recipe isn't bad, but it's not great either. I'd probably try something else next time I buy shrimp.

This was very good. Made it for the first time last night.  We bought cocktail size shrimp, if I made it again I'd use the medium size.  Also, sprinkling feta cheese on top as opposed to parmesan is something I'm going to try to make it a little more flavorful.  But it was a great meal and we will be making it again!  Thanks!

I couldn't believe how easy this dish was to make!  I sauteed bell pepper and onion in olive oil, as well as some cayenne pepper for a little kick, and used half the butter.  I will definitely make again.

Made this last night for husband and neighbors.  We were extremely satisfied.  I doubled the recipe and added two more cloves of garlic than called for.  I used white cooking wine and was worried.  After cooking it looks like the sauce is going to be way too much but it worked very well with the pasta.  Everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  Thanks!

PRETTY GOOD AND SIMPLE, BUT HAD TO ADD LEMON JUICE, RED PEPPER FLAKES, PARSLEY, SALT, AND DICED TOMATOES.  OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO BLAND.

This absolutely delicious!!!! Me and my husband just got through eating this and I can hardly type.. a few changes.  I did everything as should be but mixed the wine and cheese together and then added...  This my friends is definately 5 stars.  Everything else was as it should be.  We had it with ribeye steak and 5 cheese garlic bread.  We will use this again and again!!!!  Thanks Robin!!!!!

I was actually a bit disappointed in this recipe.  It was very simple, yet a bit tasteless.  As all of the other ratings suggest....much needs to be added or taken away from this recipe...I think I'll try it again, but I will take some advice from other users.

This was so pretty!  I didn't have quite enough parmesan, so I just sprinkled a little flour in the sauce to thicken it.  I served it on a big platter surrounded by wilted spinach, and had to fight for leftovers to share at work today.  Thanks for my new Shrimp Scampi recipe!!

I didn't have any wine or lemons so I added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce to the shrimp, garlic, and butter for extra flavor and it turned out good.
