Great simple classic filling!  I used regular cream cheese and regular milk and it turned out wonderful.  I don't think the mixture would fill 10 crepes.  We topped with fresh fruit and tasted great.

Love this recipe!! It was easy to make and didnt take very much time at all. I used it to put inbetween our pancakes to make stuffed pancakes like you would get from Bob Evans.

Awesome alternative filling for crepes. My wife is allergic to casein (protein in dairy) so this was perfect.

Loved this but needed to stretch it a bit further so I added a mashed banana and some lemon zest.  My kids loved it:)

Very good filling. I am not vegan, so I substituted reg. cream cheese & fat free organic milk. I added about 1 tsp. of brown sugar because the filling wasn't sweet enough. Next time I will try half white sugar and half brown sugar. I added sliced strawberries and blueberries on top of the filling and used the Dessert Crepes recipe to make dessert crepes (drizzled chocolate syrup on top). My family loved them; they especially like them with ice cream on top.

I used regular cream cheese, almond milk and honey as the sweetener. It was good, but needed a touch more sweetness. The cream cheese taste was a little too overwhelming. We ate this in homemade crepes  topped with strawberries. Very good and will be even better next time, now that I know!
