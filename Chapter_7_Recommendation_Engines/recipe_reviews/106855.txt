Very tasty and easy to make !!  We did not have enough aluminum foil to make four packets, so we just put it all together into one Reynolds Hot Bag.  Turned out great !   Thanks !!

Went camping and everyone enjoyed it.  I had them premade in a zip lock baggie for 24 hours before hand.  Didn't use mushrooms.  Did fry up some bacon, and cumbled some into the mix.  I doubled the butter.  Went camping, fried it up.  Did add 6 whipped eggs to it during the last 7 minutes of frying.  Served it with cheese and some left over Carne Asade meat from the night before (tore it into bite size pieces).  We made "Camping Breakfast Burritos" out of this.  Warmed up a large flour tortilla.  Then added what you want, chopped onion, chopped cilantro, or salso.  Or Ketchup as my son likes it.  This is a keeper!!!!!

I'm giving this recipe four stars because I felt a couple changes that I made were what really made this recipe incredible.

I did the following:  in the foil pocket, I put 4 medium potatoes (cut into 1" pieces), 1 large onion (diced), dotted with cold butter, added a liberal amount of ranch dressing, and topped it off by adding chopped garlic to the top (to taste).  I wrapped it all up and grilled on medium heat for 50 min, turning once.

These came out tender, flavorful, and buttery!  I topped with sour cream and bacon bits and it was the perfect compliment to our steaks!

I made these on a camping trip just the potatoes and onions, i didn't have any mushrooms but i imagine that would be good. The soup mix makes it so good. I knew i would like it because i make potatoes like that in the oven at home- Throw them in a bag with olive oil and soup mix, leave the skins on and spread it on a pan in the oven. These are easy to pull outta the cooler and throw on the grill. Food is so much better camping!

Awesome recipe.  Don't change a thing.  Made it according to the recipe, threw it all into a baking pan, covered it with foil and threw it on the barbecue, indirect heat, WOW!  Fantastic!  We will definitely try this one camping over the coals.  Tasted delicious.

I made the recipe exactly as written. The only difference was I cooked them in one foil packet instead of four. I cooked them for 35 minutes and they turned out perfectly! Hubby thought they needed a light sprinkle of salt, and after trying his I agreed they were better. I will definitely be making these again. Easy cleanup!

Tried this recipe one weekend during a BBQ. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. So easy to put together and tastes GREAT!  I have made it 3 times since and will continue making it whenever I have the chance. Thank you!!

I usually put the potatoes in a foil pan rather than wrapped in aluminum foil.  I have also made these with an envelope of italian dressing or ranch mix to change it up a bit.

I tried a version of this while camping last weekend - try adding sliced chicken sausage and squash, and this makes a great one-dish meal.

Skip the mushrooms and add some green chilis. Forget the soup mix and throw in some garlic. We are talking about camping, right?

I make this all the time, even when I'm not camping. I usually just chop everything up, throw in a gallon plastic baggie, add some olive oil and the seasoning, shake it all up to coat, then throw in foil. I also add carrots, green peppers or both. A packet of zesty Italian dressing is good in place of onion soup mix. When camping I love to bring a steak that I preseasoned and froze (makes a great temporary ice pack) to complete my filling meal.

Good enough for company, fast & easy.  I changed the method of preparation.  I put all the ingredients into an empty plastic bread bag and shake (I find this is better coverage than mixing in a bowl).  Dump into a 9 x 9 metal pan, cover with foil and place on the upper rack of the barbeque.  Quickly wash out the plastic bag when you wash your dishes, wipe off the tin foil and hopefully put into the recycling bin for pick up by your local collection agency.

Very good! Only change I made was to cook the entire recipe in a foil bag rather than individual servings.  I also added just a smigen of water....a couple of tablespoons probably just to be sure I'd had enough moisture.   I placed them on the grill for 35 minutes and all the veggies  were perfect.  I served this with grilled sirloin and a baby broccoli/carrot/lima bean medley.  My husband and son scooped it right up ;)

my husband and i love this!!! I've been making it once a week lately. To make it a little more hearty, I ut the potatoes smallers and added a small chopped jalepeno, and a diced red bell pepper. Then when weve got a lot leftover, I'll just throw it in a pan with some frozen sweet corn and heat it up and its just as delicious!

Could have sworn I had onion soup mix, but wasn't in the cabinet, so I subbed some garlic salt - Delicious!! I used yukon gold potatoes that were not very fresh, and they were yummy - they steamed inside the foil pouch and were soft with just a few crunchy bits. I would have liked a few more crunchy edges, but I did have a little trouble with my potatoes sticking to the foil. This might be because I forgot to melt the butter, I just put dotted a few pats of butter over the top. Or, maybe to be safe next time, I will give the foil a quick spray of cooking spray...After I put them in the serving dish I sprinkled some crumbled gorgonzola over the top. We were licking our plates!!

Great flavor and easy to do!  I added some zuccini, squash, and red pepper.  I am definitely adding this to my summertime recipe repertoire.  Thank you!
