I made this upscale, and people have been raving ever since! I followed most of the recipe- except... I toasted some macadamia nuts, then chopped them for the top and the sides.  I also took some frozen whole cherries, chopped them, and put them all across the top. I did not use as much wine as mentioned, but did follow the soaking and poured some on top the night before I served it. It was incredible- and everyone has asked me for the delicious recipe! Thank you for bringing something delish to the usually not so delish passover dessert table!

The best Passover cake I have ever had!! I would even make it during the rest of the year. Also it tastes AMAZING if you add you use a little bit of a chopped chocolate bar like chocolate chips.

I plan to make this with the "upscale" suggestions but I will alter this to substitute pasturized egg yolks and egg whites for the raw ingrediants.  Decorating the top with chocolate curls and/or candied fruits would add to eye appeal.

I made two, figuring that something that small wouldn't feed the entire seder crowd. I was WRONG. This "cake" is so rich and so good that all 16 ate the one cake, and I sent the other home with the host. Good golly, this is good!!

I use to make this and my family adored it.  I stopped because of the concern over raw eggs.  It is an absolutely fantastic recipe.  You can make it a couple of days ahead.

Relatives in Israel gave me the recipe so I was astonished to see it here! Egg concerns? Don't use them. It will turn out just fine. Wine concerns? Use grape juice, pomegranate or cherry juice and will be delicious. I sprinkle colored sprinkles on top instead of chocolate shavings. This serves a lot of people! And uses up matzoh. That's the point, right?

Very interesting idea.  I didn't think this was good, but the kids at the seder liked it a lot.  Afterwards, I realized that raw eggs probably were not good to serve to them, but they seem okay now. I could see playing with the recipe to improve the taste and texture and eliminate the raw egg problem.

Was VERY good.  But how come it says ready in 30 minutes if you have to put it in the frig overnight?

So delicious!  This is a Passover dessert I will actually look forward to!  It is amazing to see how many people this cake will feed.  I received nearly two dozen variations on "yum."  I only made one substitution: using the "don't cook with wine you won't drink" principle, I chose a semi-sweet kosher red wine, and will stick to this choice in the future.  It was sweet enough without the cough-syrupy flavor of Manischewitz.  
A minor warning: make sure you either start shopping well ahead of time or go to a kosher grocery if you adhere strictly to Passover restrictions; finding chocolate without soy emulsifier is very difficult and I was unable to find margarine without soybean oil.

Yummy.  Pesach is nothing without a matza chocolate cake.  Every year I try another recipe but no more. This is it.  Amazing.  Used 60% Elite dark chocolate.

It looked great, and it tasted even better! I would give it a 5-star, but I'm worried about the raw eggs. It just seems... "weird". The main reason cookie dough and brownie batter can't be eaten is because of the raw eggs. But the taste just too good!
