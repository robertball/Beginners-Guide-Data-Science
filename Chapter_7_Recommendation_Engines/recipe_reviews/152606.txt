These are great - I actually originally made this from the recipe in the Kraft Food & Family magazine from last year - everyone loves them. I rolled them in either powdered sugar, crushed oreos, coconut, cocoa powder, or crushed pecans. Yum!

Wow is all I can say. This was so very easy and yummy! I made them a little smaller because they are very rich and made sure they set overnight to blend the choco-nutty flavor. I also accidentally added crunchy instead of creamy peanut butter. It was really good!

Not your usual truffle, but it was so creamy and delightful. The chocolate flavour was very prominent when I first made these and sampled them a few hours later. But after sitting for almost 24 hours the peanut butter really shines through! The only problem I had with this is the actual rolling of the truffles. I had to actually stick the mixture in the freezer for it to really harden up and I tried to roll it in icing sugar but it just absorbed most of it. So I ended up rolling it in finely grated milk chocolate. Worked perfectly! Tastes great! Next time I'll put the mixture in the freezer from the beginning. Thanks for the easy and yummy recipe.

These were so easy to make and they were so good. Instead of using powdered sugar, I used crushed peanuts to coat the truffles. The best part is they melt in your mouth. If Reese's made truffles, they would probably taste like this. This is a keeper.

These were good but I didn't care too much for the pungent peanut butter flavor.  Next time I will use only 3/4ths of what the recipe calls for.

These were very deleciuos. But instead of putting all the coting on top of it we just dipped them in chocolate. I think they were a lot better without all that sugar or powerdered sugar on it.

I made this in my dorm room for a bake sale I have tomorrow. They sold within the first hour! They taste delicious and were so easy to make, easy enough to do with just a microwave and a refrigerator.   Instead of putting peanut butter (because of allergies to nuts) I put marshmallow creme and coated it with graham crackers for s'mores truffles. The marshmallow didn't come through very well, there were only subtle hints of it, but it still tasted wonderful.

These truffles tasted really good, but were so much hassle! The truffle was very thin and difficult to work with, so I kept adding more icing sugar, which I didn't want to do, but didn't see any other option for. Even with the added icing sugar, they were still incredibly melty, especially when I began to form them into balls in my hands or dip them in chocolate. I had to form the balls, then freeze them on a cookie sheet for about half and hour, and then quickly dip them in chocolate or roll them, oftentimes having to stop to allow them to freeze again. The semi-frozen truffle meeting the melted chocolate led to truffle oozing through whatever cracks in the chocolate it could find, which was frustrating. They did taste good in the end however, and looked great when dipped in chocolate and covered with big coconut flakes. I served them as Christmas gifts in tins along with the Decadent Truffles and Oreo Truffles from this site.
