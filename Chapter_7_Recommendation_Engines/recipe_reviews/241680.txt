Honestly, I was afraid this wouldn't come together. The dough is wet enough with just the oil. But, taking a leap of faith, I added the water and kept stirring. They came out beautifully! Thank you for this great recipe!

I used butter instead of oil, andlmilk instead of water.
I also rolled it out like very thin pie dough, put it on a cookie sheet, and marked it in lines up/down and across (grid).
When it was baked and cooled, I broke the pieces apart.
Much like I remember my mother doing.

When they're beaten together, butter, sugar anr eggs are leaveners, they help leaven the food, which is why many recipes ask you to cream them together for 5 to 10 minutes or until golden yellow. Creaming butter, eggs and sugar together creates air pockets in the batter, and as the batter bakes, these air pockets create a light, fluffy product. Butter also contains water, which evaporates during baking, which can also cause the baked good to rise. Eggs have a number of roles in baked goods, but their starring role is as a binder. The protein in the eggs gives structure to the batter so it's neither stiff nor crumbly, but the eggs also act as a leavener when they're beaten with butter and sugar. Folding beaten egg whites into a batter serves the same purpose.

I tried this, since I had all the ingredients and someone mentioned it tasted like pie crust (I thought, that won't be so bad). I didn't have a pastry cutter or parchment paper, so I improvised with a whisk and (though I probably didn't need to) spraying my pan. It was quick and easy to make, but I found the resulting taste rather bland.

This recipe is NOT valid for Catholic communion bread.
Catholics only use wheat flour and water.

My oven is not working, so I heated the dough in a wok.  First I heated the wok with medium heat. Then I lowered the heat to mid low and place the dough (1 big piece) in it. I covered the wok and flip the dough about every 3-4 minutes. The whole cooking took about 20 - 25 minutes. Taste good too!

Super easy! Next time I will precut before baking, but it’s nice to have a large piece to “break bread” with the congregation. This recipe made enough for at least 100 people

This is an ideal recipe for communion, which was what I made it for. I made this twice. I had extras at home which everyone liked, it is moreish and is fresh for at least 3 days out of the refrigerator.  I find 1/3 c oil to be a bit much so  I lessened on the oil. Also I used coconut oil which makes a better difference. Will definitely be saving this recipe.

Followed the recipe using a scant 1/3 cup of oil and water. I baked it in one large rectangle with grooves to break it more easily for communion. It made 70 to 80 3/4 inch squares.

Turned out perfectly!! It did need to bake for 18 to 20 minutes to get cooked all the way through. I made it for Maundy Thursday service and everyone enjoyed it.

If you're looking for a recipe to use for the Lord's Supper, this is a great one. I'm not a baker, but this was super easy and turned out well. Couple of things:
1. I had to cook it for an extra minute because the dough was REALLY wet. I set the timer for 8 minutes and checked it every minute after that. It was done at 11 minutes. 
2. I pushed the dough out into one large piece versus the six balls recommended. 
3. I scored the dough with a sharp knife before baking. This made cutting it apart after it baked super easy with minimal breakage or flaking
4. The edges cooked too much, but I just gave them to my 15 month old to eat :)

Very fast and easy. Very similar in taste and texture to pie crust. I will make it whenever I serve communion.

I was concerned with how oily it was, but after baking it an extra 2 minutes. It was good. Served it to the kids for lunch with chicken salad on it. All 11 kids ate it. Next time I'll sprinkle the top with sea salt made it with sea salt, olive oil, and whole wheat flour rolled to 2 cm thin, baked at 425* for 12 minutes. Cut our with a large biscuit cutter.

The communion bread came out good i just made it tonight. It took 20 mins instead of 10 mins. I flipped the bread over after 10 mins and let it cook for another 10 mins. Came out golden brown and looks beautiful.

Very oily and bland, not a great combo even for a dip or spread base and fairly unpleasant alone. I may try less oil (and more salt?) next time.

Excellent!! I made it just the way you said and it was perfect and flaky. I also made the same recipe but instead of using the vegetable oil I used a basting oil (sunflower oil with garlic and herbs) instead and it was AMAZING!!! Thank you. This is exactly what I was looking for!! I can always count on finding something at allrecipes!

I used coconut oil and added chocolate chips before popping them in the oven. Came out very tasty, good recipe!
