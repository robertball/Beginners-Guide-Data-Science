I have had vinegar pie before they taste wonderful but I followed this recipe and it would not bake firm I wonder if there is too much water in the recipe by accident?

I agree with first reviewer....must have too much water as mine did not bake firm either. I followed recipe and baked for more than an hour! It did have a wonderful taste however and I will try it again using maybe 3/4 to 1 cup water.

The flavor was good but mine never set either. I only used 1 cup of water and baked it for 65 minutes. It needs the other 1/2 cup water to fill the pie shell. If I make it again I'll use 1/2 cup flour.

Didn't set up. I wish I would have read the reviews before I made it.
