I found the preparation method and ingredient combo a bit odd when I first read over this recipe but the outcome was awesome! The one thing I would change is to eliminate the salt altogether since the parm brings plenty of salt to the sauce. I used this for grilled chicken wings but it would work well with so many other things. Try it and see for yourself!
