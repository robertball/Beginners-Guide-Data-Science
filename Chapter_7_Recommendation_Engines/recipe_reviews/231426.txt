I doubled this recipe - it is really good and even better the next day.  The chicken granules made this a bit too salty, next time I would cut that back, maybe in half.  I would also suggest adding a bit of sugar or a grated carrot to the onion garlic mixture.   Overall, this is a good recipe.  Thanks Celeste.

I made this for the first time tonight and the flavor was excellent! It was a little salty from the bouillon, but otherwise wonderful.

I made this but used chicken stock base testing it carefully not having over salt. The sauce turned out great! I am going to make a hug batch and can it. That saves me time and can go with many dishes. Thank you so much for this recipes its great!

I made this recipe & it was delicious. Also wanted to let others know since they said it was too salty to use Herb Ox (Sodium Free) granulated chicken bouillon.That will solve the too salty taste. Bon appetit !!!

I have made it a couple times now. The bouillon cubes do make it a little salty. I'm also after browning the meat going to get rid of the excess oil, then add the wine to let that cool down. That's why the sugar was needed.

Amazing sauce! Followed the recipe exactly, possibly a touch more garlic and merlot. It topped off a great pasta/turkey meatball meal, fed 13 hungry firemen and not one complaint! (Normally at least one has to put his b.s. 2 cents in)

Followed the recipe except for I added 1Tbls white sugar & used a Cabernet Sauvignon instead of merlot.  The saying goes "cook with the wine you would drink".  I must say, this is the best sauce I've ever made/tasted.   I can't wait to find out how good it is on day 2!

Super easy and very delicious!!!  Sadly, I didn't have the merlot so I wound up adding in two tbs sugar.  Definitely will have the merlot next time but the sugar did the trick if you are without merlot.

Will definitely make it again.  I think adding the chicken bouillon granules makes a big difference in the taste. No changes were made.

Awesome recipe.  Worked out really well, and it makes a ton.  I changed a few things though which are depending on your tastes:  I about doubled the garlic since the family goes crazy for it.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of sugar as well.  The biggest change though, I think was I blended the sauce.  The sauce seemed a bit runnier with chunks, but once blended it was a thicker, smooth sauce that I was looking for.

Excellent flavors! Forgot merlot and ended up with a dry red from the back of the cupboard; had to add 2 Tbsp sugar to finish counteracting tomato tang/acidity .

Perfect.  I prepared this exactly as written.  I was always searching for a particular flavor when making pasta sauce and they all ended up tasting similar to the same old acidic taste.  This hit the spot and was exactly the flavor I've been searching for.  The Merlot wine really adds depth to tame the bitter tomato flavor!  Will be adding this to my routine recipe list!
