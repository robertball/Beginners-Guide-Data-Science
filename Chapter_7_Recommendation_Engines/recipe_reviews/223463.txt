It's rare that I take a chance on completely unrated recipes, simply because I like to see what other people said about the recipe before I try it ... but this stew was just what I was looking for so I had to try it!  I was pleasantly surprised and now wish that I would have thought to take a pic of the stew so you could have a photo for your fantastic recipe!  I'm not a huge fan of beef stews usually, but using the base of spaghetti sauce made all of the difference to me (I used Ragu original meatless).  I tried to follow the recipe as closely as I could while using the items that I had on hand.  The only changes that I made were using 2 cans of mixed veggies, rather than frozen, because that's what I had, and I used plain diced tomatoes since I didn't have any with chili's, but I did add a sprinkle of chili powder and a little bit of dried jalapenos to give it the kick that it was missing from the chili's.  I also used 2 cans of beef broth, to replace the water and bouillon (I was trying to clean out some pantry canned goods, can you tell? lol).  I let this cook on low in the crock pot while I was at work all day, which was about 9hrs or so.  I severed this over homemade parmesan chive potato pancakes with a dollop of sour cream on top.  I have to say this was one of the most successful soups or stews that I've made and we love, LOVED it!  Thanks so much for such a great and easy recipe!

This was a good, basic vegetable stew. My 5-year-old loved it. I would not, however, call this a "spicy" stew.

This was a very easy meal.  The fiance loved it, but it wasn't spicy enough for me.  I added some jalapenos in it for the kick.  Also, I couldn't find buillion and I didn't have beef broth, so I just added a ton of garlic powder.  I like that it is a thicker stew, and I loved the ground beef.

I had a ton of leftovers, but I don't feel bad about eating them.  It is delicious.  Try scaling back, though, unless you want a week's worth of stew.

Also, I was in a hurry, so I cooked it on high for 4 hours. It turned out okay, but would have been better with the suggested time.

I made this last night for the first time and it's wonderful.  Very quick and easy to make.  I did take note of other reviewers opinions that said it wasn't very spicy and decided to add two cans of chopped green chilies.  It turned out great, with just enough spice to the taste.  I'll definitely be making this one again.

Saw reviews of not being spicy enough so used 24oz of spaghetti sauce with 4-5 oz of hot salsa. Came out great though almost too spicy.

Very good soup! Next time I will experiment with reducing the amount of water. I used an 18oz jar of marinara sauce and 3 1/2 cups water. It barely fit into my old 3 1/2 qt Rival Crockpot. And there was more liquid than needed. This is definitely a soup - not a stew.

This recipe is a total loss of time and ingredients. It is tasteless, too much liquid and the directions produce vegetable mush. It can be salvaged but why start with this loser.

Love this recipe.  I double it and eat it all week for something easy and healthy.  One minor change is I eat it more like a stew by adding some pasta to soak up all of the broth.

"Beefed it up" a bit.  Used 2 12 oz bags mixed vegetables, 2 cups celery, beef stock instead of water, and added 1 cup pearled barley.  Also cooked on the stove top - after adding all ingredients, bring to a boil, reduce to simmer and cover, cook for one hour.  Turned out great and makes super left overs.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of adding some additional green chili to add a little kick being we like our food spicy. This stew was easy to make and had a lot of flavor. It was a big hit in our household. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe surprised my husband & I. I think it was the thought of adding the spaghetti sauce that threw me off. This was by far the best soup I have ever made. It made my house smell so good that my mouth literally was watering. The flavor was amazing. We will definitely be having this again. The only thing I changed was instead of water and bullion, I used 3 cans of beef broth. I added fresh potatoes and carrots and 1 bag of frozen peas. I also threw some shredded cheddar cheese on top once I put it in a bowl to eat, yummy. I made corn bread muffins to go with it and it paired nicely.

This is definitely a soup and not a stew, but very good! I took the advice of some other reviewers and added cayenne pepper, plus some garlic powder. I used one beef bouillon cube instead of granules, since that's what I had, and used carrots instead of celery (same reason). I cut the carrots finely and cooked them with the ground beef and onions. I used about 1 1/4 lbs. of meat, as that's the size of the pkg. My husband loved it! I'll be making it again!

Very good & easy recipe.  Could not find diced tomatoes with peppers, so I added a couple of jalapenos & cayenne pepper.  I also added some potatoe. Otherwise left recipe alone and was very tasty!

I LOVE this soup/stew!! I am not sure what is wrong but on the AR iphone app it says this recipe has 140 reviews and 4 1/2 stars. The most common thing people talk about is the spice level. I recommend checking the level of spiciness in the rotel and modify the pepper to your liking. My husband and I like spicy so I add original rotel and a little extra pepper. I also never cook it for 8 hours. I blanch the frozen veggies and bring everything to a boil then simmer for at least an hour. The longest I have left it is three hours. It is always so easy, yummy and flavorful!
