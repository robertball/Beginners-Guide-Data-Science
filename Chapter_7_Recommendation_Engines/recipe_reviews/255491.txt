I had a recipe very similar to this one (lost it when moving)and this is the closest recipe that I could find. This is an amazing dessert!  I just have a question.....Can I substitute the can of Pumpkin Puree with a can of 100% Pure pumpkin? It's hard to find the puree where I live. Help! Thank you!

This is sinfully delicious.  The frosting really topped it off perfectly.

This turned out wonderfully. I made a vegan version by subbing evaporated coconut milk for the evaporated milk (doesn’t add a coconut taste), 3/8 cup corn starch for the eggs, soy-free earth balance for the butter, tofutti cream cheese for the cream cheese, and So Delicious CocoWhip for the whipped topping.  It was delicious and all the omnivores devoured it. The crunchy bottom is so yummy and the frosting puts it over the top....it’s like pumpkin pie 2.0.
