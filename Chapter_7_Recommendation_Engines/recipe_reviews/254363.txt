I had a chicken breast ready to do something with and saw this recipe.  I made it as written and found it to be quite bland.  I added red/green peppers, onions, and cayenne pepper to the mix and found it much more appealing.  Also, the avocados are much better if left out of the mix and just served on the side.  The avocado flavor gets lost if mixed in the dish. This recipe is  a good basic place to start and has great potential with your favorite additions.  Would also be good to try with shrimp.

I gave this a try and was not disappointed. My mother was still thinking about it this morning. I did make a few tweaks. I used Adobe seasonings to saut√©ing the chicken along with salt and pepper. I used a little more than 2tbls of line juice. In addition to avocado and tomato, I added red onion, cilantro and a few handfuls of 4 blend Mexican cheese. This has become a staple recipe in my house!

The flavor was good, but the consistency was not. It was all mushy, needed some crunch. I won't be making it again.

Didn't use the tomatoes or avocado. Added some chilli powder. Still needs more seasonings, perhaps green onions and cilantro next time.

Quick and delicious. The lime juice and avocado really add a lot. Can't go wrong with those rice packets, either.

The flavors of this dish do not mix well together.  I can not explain it very well but my family did not like it.

So easy and so good! I had to use Knorr Mexican Rice instead because the store didn't have Yellow rice. Other people had commented they had a hard time finding the yellow rice Knorr package too, so I didn't bother trying other stores. The Mexican still had yellow rice plus white rice. It had a slight kick to it, so my 6 yr old didn't like it. Plus it was very different from the normal meals we eat. ...Update- made this a second time with Yellow Rice as called for. Used a can of diced tomatoes and should have drained it, it was too sweet and runny. My daughter's favorite bites were the ones with avocado so it may be good to add a second one in. Good with black beans too.
