I've made this twice and forming croissants makes these far more appetizing-looking. A little jam and it's all you need.  Roll the dough to approximately 6 - 8" x as wide as you can get it maintaining about 1/4" thickness, cut in triangles, roll them up and bake 'em.  The dough will last 3-4 days in the fridge, and in the freezer for longer - just set out to thaw for a couple of hours.

There are 4 of us old timers that get together every Sunday for dinner.  The ages are (me) 77 to the oldest member is 98.  After dinner we play cards for the afternoon.  Anyway I took these buns one time for dinner and they were a big hit.  They are not that difficult to make and really are very good.  Doing this per Chef Johns instructions, I learned something about pizza dough too.  The cooling of the dough keeps it from shrinking back all the time.  I have made these several times this winter now and it has a page in my "Favorite Recipe's" book.  Keep up the good work Chef John.

My husband and I love this recipe.  This was my first time making biscuits of any kind.  I did however, after reading some of the reviews regarding lack of flavor, I used cold water with a touch of vanilla extract.  I just can’t stand flavorless food.  Anyway, this is a keeper.  I will make this for many years to come.

this is a really good recipe! but i just cut up the dough and it was super bland, next time i would use salted butter and either add more flavor to the dough or make a special sauce for the biscuits. but i will definatly use this recipe again!

I loved these! My only problem was in rolling out the dough. I didn't get it thin enough, and they rose so high in the oven that half of them toppled over. They didn't look like much, but they were tasty!

These turned out great despite some missteps and not seeing my dough roll out nearly as fast and as easy as the video. Also, shredding the butter is not quite as easy as it looked especially when you get to the end of the stick. I appreciate the recipe as I love puff pastry and biscuits (who doesn’t?). I did use 3 oz salted butter based on reviews that there wasn’t a lot of flavor, instead of using only unsalted but I am not sure that was necessary because if you butter the biscuit afterward with salted butter that should be good enough. I made little biscuits and mistakenly baked them at 375 which I am used to for puff. Baked them for 20 min. Taste great, flaky but still biscuits and rose well. I added a pic so you can see the layers. I think I did an extra lamination step. I will use this again and have to figure out what else to do with them rather than just putting some butter and jam on them which tastes great. Thanks for this innovative recipe!

I would’ve given this 1 star but my husband liked them; thus the 3 stars. They’re very pretty but swimming in butter by the time they’re finally done. Smelled like homemade play dough.

This was a great little recipe. I used the dough for pigs in a blanket, dinner roll, and pretzelized it for a breakfast sandwich. I'll be keeping this recipe in my arsenal.

I made this just now and was pleased with the results, even though I didn't roll the dough correctly, and my biscuits all slanted sideways during baking. They had good texture, lots of layers, and were easy to make. I took the advice of other reviewers and used salted butter, because I wanted to eat them as biscuits. These are as good as (or in my opinion, better than)  the flaky biscuits you buy in the can - without all the mystery ingredients.  I thought I would save some time by using the food processor to grate the frozen butter, but it was really messy and not worth the trouble when hand-grating meant less clean-up. If you enjoy the process of preparing it yourself over the convenience of processed dough, you won't be disappointed! My son "ordered" me  to remember this recipe, so we will definitely make it  again!

First round, made according to recipe. There’s very little flavor to this. 
Second round, used salted butter and buttermilk. Oh My Gosh! this made a world of difference. Way better. Thanx for giving me a different way to make biscuit dough when I’ve got extra time to spend.

Tasted good, but they didn't come out quite right.  I think this is more on me than the recipe and I'll definitely try this more often and rate accordingly.

Excellent buns, so layered and buttery.  This is going to be made in our home often.  A tiny bit of butter as they are already buttery and a bit of homemade jam make these perfect!!  Yummmy!!

I have tried several tea biscuit recipes, but this is bar none the best one yet!  I have made several dozen to date.  They do not get to cool off, as my family devours them as soon as they are out of the oven!!
