Love love LOVED this! The only change I will make the next time is to cut back on the brown sugar and add more bourbon. Excellent recipe! I did bake the bacon in the oven at 400 for ten minutes prior to sticking it on the grill since I knew the salmon would cook much faster than the bacon but other than that, I made as written.

Excellent, I made a few changes, I left off the 3 scallions and used a teriyaki sauce.  I recommend microwaving bacon to cook half way before putting on grill.  I also used long kabob skewers instead of individual which worked fine.

That was awesome! Quick and easy to make and everyone loved it! I added chili powder to the marinade to give a little kick.
