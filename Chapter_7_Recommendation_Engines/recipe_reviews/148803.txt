Absolutely excellent! Only difference, I put the pastry at the bottom of the bowl before the soup went in.

Made this almost as written- no major changes and it was deliscious. I left out the mushrooms ( the guys wont eat em..) and parboiled some fresh carrots since I did not have frozen ones. I did roll a pie crust out flat and bake it till golden and added pieces of that to the bowl since the crust is always the best part to me! WIll definitely make this again!

This recipe went over very well in our house. I did tweak it a little for health reasons; I used a cholesterol friendly option in place of butter and used another tbs of flour in the paste and skim milk instead of cream. I skipped the almonds too and served it over biscuits. Yummy!

Good! I think I still prefer the thick and creamy real pot pie but this was very simple to make. It def warmed our bellies.:)

Delicious! Easy prep uncomplicated recipe. Great flavor esp for a quick cooking soup. Almonds sounded good. But this time I omitted them and instead added black truffle salt. Perhaps next time I'll use potatoes as a thickner too. However it's great as is.

I like the touch of the almonds but this was pretty bland for our tastes. My only change was to use fresh sauteed mushrooms instead of canned...oh and I served with homemade biscuits instead of pastry shells. I think this really needs onions and perhaps a touch of garlic with plenty of black pepper too. I would also prefer a more veggies...corn and broccoli would be a good start for me. It's a good base recipe and I would make again with changes to suit our preferences. I also would omit the chicken base i think...not really crazy about that flavor. Thanks for the idea!

Great soup! I used a 32oz box of broth 3 tablespoons of better than bouillon chicken a half bag frozen corn and half a bag of pearl onions. I also doubled the rou because I wanted it stew like rather than soup like. Even with the changes and additions this is fantastic!! Great share!!
