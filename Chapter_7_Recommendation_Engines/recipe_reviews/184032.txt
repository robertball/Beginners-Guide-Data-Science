Skipped the step of parboiling the mushrooms - I just lightly rubbed them with olive oil.  Loved the cream cheese/shrimp mixture - I used medium shrimp as I like their flavor better than the tiny shrimp, regular cream cheese, chopped fresh chives and just a tiny bit of minced onion.  Romano cheese is quite pungent, so I used just a light sprinkling of Parmesan instead.  A sprinkling of finely chopped fresh parsley prettied these up.  Very good!

Kara, thank you for a wonderful recipe.  I made these stuffed mushrooms exactly per the directions and ingredients given.  They were absolutely wonderful and are now a permanent recipe for cocktail gatherings in our house.  Everyone enjoyed them over the Christmas holiday and requests for the recipe were frequent.  Thank you for a KEEPER!!!

These are fantastic!  Very easy to prepare and extremely tasty!  I did parboil the mushrooms and I think it gave them great texture.  These were gone when I brought the dish home and everyone raved about them!  The only thing that I did differently was add a little Old Bay to the mixture and then sprinkle a Mozzarella and Provolone before baking!  These are definitely the appetizers that I will take to events from now on!  Very, very comparable to Red Lobster's seafood stuffed mushrooms!

A year later and these are still the very best appetizer I have ever made!  Everyone who tries them, loves them!  You simply cannot go wrong with this recipe!

I didn't simmer the mushrooms (just drizzled them with olive oil before the final baking) and I used regular cooked shrimp that I roughly chopped up. Great little appetizer - quick, easy and tasty! Thanks, Kara!

I used crab as they did not have any canned shrimp at Parkers. IT was GREAT!  Ron oohed and ahhed about them. Definitely need to make them again and often. Try with the shrimp next!

Pretty darn good. I played with a bit since, I'm a simple cheese gal so substituted cheddar for Romano. Added minced red onions and a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning. Very very tasty!

These were very tasty.  I think next time I would like to use frozen baby shrimp that retain their shape a little better.  But the taste was delicious.  My mushrooms were a little smaller than I expected but still turned out fine.

These were just ok. Nobody had seconds, nobody had leftovers (of which there were tons).

My hunny said that these were soooo good that I had to make them for the next pot luck we go to.  They were much simpler than I had imagined. Obviously I am going to be making these again.

I used fresh shrimp that I poached in a little white wine and water, but followed everything else in the recipe exactly. They're absolutely delicious, but wow are they rich! More than one or two of these and I wouldn't have room for dinner.

I bought one pound 21-30 count frozen peeled shrimp cooked, pulsed in food processor for just a few seconds. Then added all ingredients,  including 1/2 cup parmesan/romano shreds. Par boiled mushrooms for just a minute, then cooled on paper towels. Stuffed the mushrooms and sprinkled with seafood seasoning , and baked. I do the same with canned crabmeat. Always a winner.
