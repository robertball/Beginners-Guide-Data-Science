I've used this recipe so many times that it has become my signature "wow" side dish, especially when making Osso Buco. Saffron can sometimes be hard to find, but don't worry.  This recipe still turns out great without it (the same can still be said when you omit the marrow). And keep in mind that you can swap out the Parmesan for another cheese to mix it up a little.  For example, Gorgonzola works great.  If using a different cheese, rely on taste as opposesd to the given measurements as stronger cheeses will require less and vice versa.

Most local butcher/supermarket meat departments save bones for your dogs in the back or even sell them in a package to you.  These will all have marrow in them and they usually have techniques to get it out.  Small spoons are usually the best.

Ok now, this recipe is absolutely fantastic. I followed it to the T minus the bone marrow and it turned out amazing. One change I would make is to lessen the saffron by half or to taste. 1 tsp turned out to be quite a lot and it made the dish extremely aromatic, which is not a negative, however as a side dish the flavor was a tad overwhelming. One thing I would note to new risotto makers is the cooking time and the amount of broth are completely subject to external factors. So just keep tasting it as you go and it should be perfectly dente when the husk on the rice begins to become transparent.

An acceptable risotto but it didn't "wow" me - I would have preferred this with more texture than just the onion, and the beef/saffron flavor was a little strong and not the most ideal combinination of flavors. Hubs didn't care for it at all. The bone marrow was incovenient so I didn't use it, but I can't imagine this would have been that much better had I included it.

Very simple and easy side dish.  I used chicken stock instead of beef as I was serving chicken.  I fried the onion with some garlic as well until brown and slightly crispy. Delicious.

This turned out very delicious! I used one quart of chicken broth, no marrow, and didn't add the remaining quarter cup of butter at the end, and I added mushrooms with the onions.  Very rich and moist!

My first attempted risotto, and it came out great. I didn't use beef or beef stock- I substituted chicken stock and left out meat all together. I also added a little paprika instead of saffron (didn't have any.) I've made this a couple of times, and it's good- especially with lots of parmesian cheese!

I have never made risotto from scratch before, but this recipe was extremely easy to follow and turned out perfectly! I left out the marrow, but to me it tasted absolutely delicious and my family and friends loved it too.

Bravo!  Finally an AUTHENTIC recipe that made my risotto taste like the one I had at a neighborhood restaurant in Ticino!  I've seen so many recipes that missed the mark, suggesting all the liquid at once, covering the pan, or using olive oil instead of butter, etc.  This one is the real thing!

Add some white wine when you add the rice to give it an especially great flavor! (I learned this while living in Florence, Italy.)

Authentic and delicious! It is excellent both with and without the marrow, which adds a bit of a different flavour, but is definitely not a show stopper.  Another reviewer suggested experimenting with different cheeses, so this time I am using an extra sharp Vermont cheddar.

This is a very rich dish.  My husband makes it whenever he wants to "fancy" up the meal.  Not difficult to make and goes with anything.  Chicken, fish, beef.  An excellent side dish that will impress your friends.

Delicious!  I tried it a second time changing it a bit so I could serve it with salmon.  I substituted the beef stock for fish stock that I made by boiling fish bones and shrimp heads.  I also added some garlic at the begining and a bit of coconut milk at the end with the parmesan cheese.  This is a good basic recipe that is easy to adapt to all flavors.

Pretty good, but the saffron flavor was a bit overwhelmed by the cheese. Nice presentation, tastes fine, but I think if youÂ´re going to use saffron it might as well star! Worth making once though.

I did not use the beef marrow and it still was awesome. Worth the effort for "real" risotto as this was my first attempt to make it. I did not take the onions out after sauteing them.

Good risotto.  I carmelized the onions, rather than just cooking til soft.  Highly recommend doing this!  Also, I did not use the beef marrow and it was still very flavorful.

My first attempt at making risotto.  Omitted the saffron and bone marrow, but I thought it turned out great without it.
 Very creamy and chewy, just like risotto I had in Italy.

This was ok, no one in my family was too crazy about it. I used homemade stock & replaced the last 1/4 cup of butter with more cheese, which might have did the entire recipe in, but I doubt it.

I left out marrow and also used chicken stock (my main dish was chicken).  I didn't use all the stock (and I didn't even have enough to begin with), but I was worried that the rice would have been overcooked, so I stopped pouring it in before the container was empty.  I also let the saffron sit in a tiny bit of wine to draw out the flavor and color. It was a beautiful yellow, delicious dish.
