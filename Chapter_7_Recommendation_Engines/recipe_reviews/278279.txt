If I could give this recipe more stars than five, I would!  My husband says it’s the best sweet bread that he’s ever eaten. In fact he’s trying to figure out how to keep it all to himself. He must love it because he just ran out the door to buy more chocolate chips and buttermilk so I can make more!

I followed the recipe to a T.
I do think that you should swirl the cinnamon and sugar prior to adding the rest of the batter.

Also, my bread caved in the middle after cooling- I believe this is my fault and I should have cooked it a bit longer.
Otherwise, it came out great!
