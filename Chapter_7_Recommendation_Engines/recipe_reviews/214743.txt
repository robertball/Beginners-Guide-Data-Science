Excellent! I partially microwaved the potatoes first to cut down on cooking time. I put these into a foil pan sprayed with a bit of Pam to prevent sticking vs. foil packets. I love the sweet and spicy taste these have - it was a nice accompaniment to grilled pork.

Great flavors! I also didn't have room on my grill so I put the potatoes in a single layer in a casserole dish, sprinkles the sugar and spices over them and dotted with butter. I baked it at 375 until the potatoes were soft, turning occasionally to coat. Easy and so good!

These were great!  If you have younger kids you may want to leave out the cayenne & substitute with cinnamon.  My 4 year old was fine but they were a little too spicy for my 2 year old.

Wow!  These sweet potatoes are AMAZING!! My kids loved this recipe - they said it tastes like pumpkin pie! I made a few tiny changes: I peeled and cut the sweet potatoes, put them in a bowl, tossed them with a little bit of olive oil until they were coated, added the sugar, cumin, a bit of cinnamon and Penzey's Smoky 4/S Seasoning and then tossed again until evenly seasoned. I grilled them in the foil packets, and they were nicely caramelized. This recipe is a keeper and will be served at future BBQs. Thanks, teetee830!

This turned out pretty well.  I slightly changed this recipe.  I peeled, then cubed the potatoes, then boiled them for appx 10 minutes, to cut back on cook time.  Then I seasoned and placed in foil and grilled.  The flavor was great!  Mine were very soft, not sure if it was just because I boiled them, or if they were supposed to be soft.  Either way, I enjoyed it, and will try again.  Next time I may cook them on the stove, same seasoning, but like home fries.

These were pretty good, but I will make some changes in the future. The cumin flavor was a little overwhelming, so I will probably halve it next time, and maybe add a bit more brown sugar.  I also substituted cinnamon for the cayenne pepper, and that worked nicely. Overall a good recipe!

Like the submitter, I don't care for sweet potatoes... at least that's what I thought!  This was a family hit.  I melted the butter and other ingredients in a bowl and tossed the diced potatoes in it first to evenly coat.  Since some said it was too spicy for the kids I put a dash of cayenne and the rest paprika (hubby hates cinnamon).  They didn't taste spicy at all this way.  Easy to cook.  I was suprised at how soft they were when they were so hard to cut through raw.  Really good!!  Thanks teetee830!!

I did one large packet with cayenne, and a smaller packet with cinnamon for my 3yo. Both were delicious. I left them on for 30 minutes, but I think 20 would have been better. They were a little too soft, and the butter burned on the bottom.

I followed the recipe exactly and the procedure worked flawlessly, however, we were lukewarm about the flavors in this.   I think this recipe is perfect and needs no alteration, but it just wasn't "us", if that makes sense?

These were very good! Like the other reviewers I found it a little spicy with the cayenne but it was very good.  I would premix all the spices in a dish and then pour over potatos for an even coat, besides that, delicious!

Boy oh boy were these good! Nice combination of flavors. Slightly sweet and slightly spicy, I wouldn't change anything regarding the ingredients but next time I will use non-stick foil because I did get some sticking. Will be making these a lot when grilling. Thanks teetee830!  Good recipe!

great recipe!  i changed a couple things though - I subbed olive oil for the butter, subbed about 2/3 of the red pepper for paprika (my 3 little ones have a tendancy to get upset when i cook food too spicy ), and didn't precook the potatoes at all!  I combined everything in a bowl, then split into 2 foil "envelopes".  20 min later we had perfectly cooked grilled potatoes!  My husband, who thought sweet potato casserole with lots of sugar, butter, and marshmallows was the only way to eat them said that he thought they were the best he'd ever eaten.  Great Job!

Made these with Scotty substituting 1/2 the cayenne for cinnamon. They still give a good bit of kick but where my wife and his girls can take the heat.

Not bad, but I still thought the flavor left something to be desired.  I added garlic salt, and that took this recipe to 5 stars.  I then served to a group of 4 others who all really enjoyed the potatoes.

I loved these more savory sweet potatoes! I'm not a big fan of the sweet potatoes made with marshmallows and a lot of sugar, so I thought these were fantastic. The brown sugar gives a hint of sweetness, but is also very savory with the cumin and cayenne pepper added. I never knew that I liked sweet potatoes so much to be honest, and my husband didn't think he liked them at all until we tried this recipe. Very easy to make and very inexpensive! I will definitely make these again. Thank you for the recipe!

What a great flavour combo! These turned out delicious. They are a bit spicy, so go easy on the cayenne if you're not a fan of heat. I think they would be great with some cinnamon added, too. Thanks for the recipe :)

My husband was skeptical of this recipe but I was hopeful.  I thought it had way too much cumin.   I added lots of cinnamon and additional brown sugar and could eat them.  My husband however could not.

Great recipe! I used olive oil instead of butter and brown instead of white sugar. I also used pumpkin pie spice. Just a lil healthier.

This has become a staple sidedish in our home during the summer.   It's way too hot to cook indoors, so it's great to do the sides on the grill with our main dish.  It's also great with red potatoes and different spice combinations.   On our grill we have to grill them on the top rack or they will get too crispy

Very nice grilled sweet potato.  Loved the cayenne flavoring in this recipe.  Wrapping in foil made for easy clean up.  Opened the pouch and arranged on a plate.  A great addition to grilling season.

I would do a couple things differently next time.  First I would use less cayenne, and maybe add cinnamon as another reviewer suggested.  I would also use a little cooking spray in my foil packets, since I had a lot of butter and caramelized sugar stuck to the sides.  Before putting the potatoes in the packets, I would mix everything in a bowl fist to ensure even coating of the butter and seasonings.

loved the ease of cooking these on the grill in foil but did not like the cumin/cayenne spices.  will definitely make w/cinnamon next time!

Not a bad recipe at all..and the cayenne you can omit it too or add more if you like. And I tried it with added diced potatoes (didn't have enough yams) and that worked out quite nicely too.

Best sweet potato recipe I’ve had.  Cooked exactly like the recipe suggests, comes out perfect every time.  I throw these on as I light the grill, and are done when the steaks come off.

This has become our preferred method to cook sweet potatoes.  I love to grill and this is so easy.  It is the perfect size for two portions. We also tried it in a Dutch oven for our large monthly family gathering.  Cut the butter in half in the Dutch oven, though.

I've made these several times and they are delicious.  Quick and easy to grill, great with pork chops!  Mt picky 7 year old thinks they're OK (but ate them all!), 4 year old who loves anything sweet  thinks they're amazing.

I was looking for something to do with excess sweet potatoes (had bought a bagful at Sam's and there are just two of us.)  I wanted to use the newly refurbished grill and searched, and this popped up among a lot of other recipes.  We love simple baked sweets so was a little skeptical of this.   Well, no need for skepticism.   This was delicious just as it was written.   The ONLY change I would make would be to spray the foil well with non-stick spray before placing the ingredients on it.    I have a Weber grill and they tend to be "super" so I did lower the temperature setting to about 3/4 power when I put the packet on; then i cooked it for 30 minutes, flipping it every ten minutes (next time, I'll start with the seam up. . .it was no problem but I worried a bit.  I served this with a grilled pork tenderloin with a peach barbecue sauce.   Delicious combination!-----NOTE--the spices in this are so subtle that no child would be turned off by them.  It's just a really good combination.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Instead of grilling them I baked them in a Corningware dish using the same ingredients except cumin & cayenne pepper (I didn't have those in my cupboard).  They still tasted good.

Added just a pinch of brown sugar as sweet potatoes are sweet enough.  May eliminate next time.   They were delicious..

I didn't have cumin, so I used a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar instead...end result was delicious. Probably better than the original recipe.

I also pre-cooked the cut-up sweet potatoes in a baking dish with a bit of water added in the microwave for 4 minutes. This enabled me to put the packets on the grill along with the lamb I was cooking. Turned out perfectly.

Simple to make and delicious! No modifications to the recipe are needed, in my opinion. Measurements and cook time are perfect! I only added a little bit of white onion I had left from a different dish I was making just to get rid of it. The addition of the 1/4 large onion (diced) as displayed in my photo did not add to nor take away from the dish! Used this dish as a side to Chef John's Grilled Jerk Pork Tenderloin along with Toasted Coconut Yellow Rice for Rice Cookers (also on this site).

These potatoes were great!! I made a couple of changes.  Used olive oil instead of butter, curry powder instead of cumin (we had none), and smoked paprika instead of cayenne pepper (didn't want them hot).  They were still very flavourful and lovely, will make again for sure!

Used a little less cayenne and cumin. Cubed the potatoes and cooked on the grill I. The packets, turning halfway through. Very good, tender with some caramelization.

Not sure where I went wrong with this, but mine was all burnt.  The butter and sugar served as glue to attach the black potatoes to the aluminum foil.  My grill was at 400 degrees and I cooked them 30 minutes.  I may try this again at 20 min since everyone else enjoyed.

I put my potatoes in the microwave for a bit to soften them before grilling them.  Only took about 10-15 minutes this way.  I also placed them directly on the grill (not in foil).  This gave them a nice charred taste (and look!)  I would use a little less brown sugar next time.  They were a little too sweet for a grilled entree (I love them sweet cooked in the oven but not on the grill!)  Definitely a fun dish to make!

This was great. Cut pieces into 1/2 inch size and only took 12 minutes over med/high grill heat. Sprayed foil with non-stick spray before putting potaoes in. Divided into 2 pouches like recipe says turned out so good. We also sprinkled a tiny bit of cinnamon in addition to other spices. When done spray with i cant believe its not butter.
