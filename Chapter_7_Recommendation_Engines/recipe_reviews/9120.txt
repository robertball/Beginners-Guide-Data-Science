This recipe is so popular and famous in my family that I have to make at least 2 crock pots of it.  One for Thanksgiving and one for left overs.  

This is a pretty moist stuffing as is.  If you like drier (fluffy) stuffing, use only about 1/2 of the chicken broth.  Also, I've made this with both fresh and dried herbs...and fresh is the WAY TO GO with this.  It tastes so awesome.  If you use fresh herbs double the amount given for the dried as fresh herbs are not as pungent as dried.  It is also imperative that  very stale dried bread is used.  It helps soak up all that broth.  If you use fresh bread it will be very, very soggy, even if you cut the amount of broth in half.  This recipe does not need to be cooked for 8 hours.  Make sure mix up the stuffing every so often so the edges don't form a crust...although some people in my family like it kinda crusty.

Also, the size of the bread cubes matters.  My family likes it best when the cubes are about half an inch by half an inch.  I personally like them bigger.  Don;t make them larger than 1 inch by inch though, otherwise it is much harder to mix up the spices and butter and you will end up with pieces of bread that have no real taste to them.

I have used this recipe for the past 4 years; I've scaled the recipe up to 25 servings for my office holiday luncheon and scaled it down to 8 servings for meals at home. I have had four years to perfect this recipe, so here are some tips.

This stuffing is very, very moist so use the butter and chicken broth sparingly.

1 cup of butter is 2 sticks - I only use 1 stick for 25 servings (two sticks left a butter layer across the top).

Also, I use only enough broth to just moisten the bread - I used the stated amount one year and ended up with stuffing soup (which everyone still said tasted wonderful).

If I use mushrooms, I use canned. I have omitted the mushrooms and added shredded carrots that I cooked with the onions, etc. I also shred the celery.

I omit the marjoram and add rosemary.

Handling such a large amount of bread cubes can be unwieldy, so I put half of the bread directly into the slowcooker, follow the directions in Step 2 using half of all the ingredients, moisten with a just enough broth, and toss lightly.  Then I do the same thing with the remaining ingredients in a large bowl, which I then combine with the other half in the slowcooker.

Like some others, I only needed to cook this about 45 minutes on high and 3-4 hours on low.

All-in-all a very nice recipe that I was able to easily change to fit my tastes. When I take this to my office luncheon, there is never any left to take home!

Excellent recipe!  Only changes I made were that I added all the spices to the onions and butter...mom taught me that many years ago...makes it easier to get the flavours all through the stuffing.  I also finely chopped the mushrooms, so that we had the flavour, but they were disguised for the kids!  Only used 2 cups of broth and cooked for about 5 1/2 hours, stirring three times to prevent sticking.  All raved, thanks!

I've made my stuffing this way for years.  If you periodically add some drippings from the turkey, this will come out tasting EXACTLY like it was made inside the bird!

This stuffing is REALLY good.  I had to add more bread though because it calls for too much broth...would be gooey.  Next time I'll start with less broth.  Also, I would decrease the salt to one tsp..was a tad too salty.

This was a fantastic alternative to in-the-bird stuffing, and it tasted great! Five stars for saving space in my oven, but just four overall because I thought it needed a couple of adjustments: 

I omitted the eggs entirely. I just didn't think the stuffing needed it, and it tasted and looked perfectly good without. 

I started with about 2 cups of chicken broth, and added some drippings from my turkey as it cooked. Make sure you mix the stuffing thoroughly each time you do this.

For those of you who want to also save time on Turkey Day, I took care of steps 1 and 2 the night before, and put the crock pot into the fridge overnight. Pulled it out and plugged it in mid-afternoon the next day, and it was perfect with our meal after 4 hours on low.

Great!  Finally a stuffing you can make out of the turkey that is moist.  I used fresh mushrooms which I sauteed with the other stuff and because of the mushroom 'sweat' I used only 1 and 1/4 cans of broth and it was perfect (and my bread cubes were very dry).  I also added three chopped apples about 1 hour before serving and it was great - also only cooked for 4 hrs on low and it was great (added a bit of broth after about 3 hrs to keep the sides from crusting).

GREAT STUFFING.

This was an awesome recipe. This was the first time that I had ever tried to make stuffing that wasn't in a box. I was really nervous because I new I had 30 people showing up for dinner and didn't know if it was going to turn out. The outcome was great, everyone loved it. I doubled it up to 32 servings. I also omitted the mushrooms but added pork sausage. I also used 7 cups of chicken both instead of 9.  I prepared it all the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator over night. The next morning I got up and put it on. However, I do recommend only cooking it for 4 hours instead of 8. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who is wanting a stuffing recipe that is great.

I will never make stuffing any other way ever again! It tasted just like it came out of the bird! I used 1 1/2 packages of peperidge farm stuffing (not the cubed kind) and a tad more than half of a 32 oz box of turkey stock. Because I used packaged stuffing I skipped the salt completely. I used fresh sage, thyme, and parsley for my herbs. Everything else I kept the same. I do not recommend skipping the eggs they definitely made a difference. Everyone thinking of trying this recipe must try it. I do agree with everyone else that 4 1/2 cups of stock is too much.

Although other reviewers found this watery, mine was a bit dry, and I used almost the full amount of (veg) broth. It could be because I used only half the fat (butter + olive oil), or because I used very hearty bread (three types: rosemary, rustic farmer's, and rye). Mine burned on the bottom, even though I followed the temp/time directions exactly. I used all fresh herbs, and the flavor was nice. I'll probably try this again next year and tweak it slightly. It's a pity some reviewers found the need to be so snarky. If your Christmas was "ruined" by this stuffing, you've got far bigger problems than just bad food.

After reading all the negative reviews on here referring to the amount of broth, I had to post.  I used two bags (which totalled 12 cups) store-bought stuffing -- one cubed white bread and one almost-powdered cornbread.  Even though the stuffing was pre-seasoned, I used the same amount of spices that the recipe called for.  I omitted the mushrooms, because we don't care for them.  I used 5 cups broth, dumped in all at the beginning.  I used a 5 qt. crockpot with a crockpot bag to avoid a messy clean up, and put a paper towel on top of the crockpot under the lid.  I opened the crockpot twice while cooking it on low for 6 hrs., but did not stir.  A few minutes before serving, I ladled about 3/4 cup turkey drippings onto the top of the stuffing while still in the crockpot.  Guests served themselves from the crockpot, and I got nothing but wonderful reviews for the texture, the moistness, and the taste.  It wasn't a mushy paste, it was perfectly spiced, and it did not burn onto the sides of the bag inside the crock.  All in all, it was a wonderful recipe, and I'll be making my stuffing this way every year!  Thanks, Gayle, for freeing up some of my oven space!

My Grandma has been making this stuffing for probably the better part of 30 years... It came out of her crock pot recipe book.   She does use less liquid than the recipe calls for... It's really a thing you have to 'feel' for yourself. I've made it once or twice to the same perfection that she does and it's awesome! Can't wait until Thursday... I can already taste it!   THIS is what comfort food is all about!

This is a great stuffing recipe, I've used it the past 2 years and my sister says this is better than my mom's (and that is BIG!).  Just a note, the amount of broth depends on how much bread and what type you use (use less for fresh bread and more for store bought packaged hard bread).  I use a mixture of different types of fresh breads (rye, grainy, sourdough, etc.) that I dry out for a couple days beforehand.  Also, do not add all the broth at once, keep it handly and add it as needed as the stuffing cooks.  I also cook and add 1 lb sage- flavored sausage and then reduce the amt of sage in the recipe by 1/2 or more.  Watch your slow cooker timing too, with my cooker (which tends to cook everything faster than called for) I only need to cook the stuffing on high for 45 min, then low for 2-4 hours.  This is a delicious recipe, you will not be disappointed!  Thanks, Gayle!

This stuffing was to die for. We fried our turkey this year so there was no drippings and no stuffing the bird. It was so moist and tasted better than my mom's stuffing. I did add a pound of sage sausage and then cut the sage in half. I still found that the stuffing had a little too much sage for my taste. Next time I won't add the sage. I only added a little chicken broth and then as needed. I used 6.5 cups torn french bread, 6.5 cups of seasoned croutons and then because I thought the sage was a tad over powering, I used a bag of Stove Top. This is a keeper for sure. I'll make it again for Christmas. We had no left-overs. Thank you thank you for a wonderful Thanksgiving. Everyone raved about the stuffing.

Made this using 1/2 stick of butter, combined 1/2 package of both Pepperidge Farm cornbread and herb seasoned stuffing, 2 cups vegetable broth instead of chicken, and 3 TB fresh sage, finely chopped, and fresh thyme, 2 TB along with other ingredients as listed. Cooked 4 hrs and stirred every 1 1/2 hrs to keep the crust from forming and monitor the liquid. It turned out light and full of flavor.  Loved using the slow cooker which helped free up the oven.  Enjoyed by all.

I made this stuffing for a playgroup Thanksgiving party and it turned out WONDERFUL!  I was looking for something easy to make that would work well in a pot-luck situation and this was just the thing.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I was out of sage so I added a little extra poultry seasoning.  I also finely chopped the mushrooms and onions(in hopes of hiding them from picky kids-as this was made for a PLAYGROUP).  I used the dried breadcubes for stuffing that are usually on the shelf by the Stovetop;) and it took the full ammount of chicken broth suggested-about 4cups.  Yummy-easy-will deff. use this recipe again!  THANX!

Hands down this is the best recipe for making stuffing in the slow cooker!  This is the same as making it in the bird ~ very moist and it goes very quickly!

I so was counting on this recipe. Between the reviews and needing counter space for Thanksgiving...so sad this was the first Thanksgiving that I had no stuffing! I even followed others suggestions with less water (I used only 2 cups). It was burnt all around the edges and absolute mush in the center. With two hours remaining I scooped out the non burnt mush and tried draining it with a cheesecloth and then I only had about 3 cups worth and put it in a pan in the oven hoping to salvage it. I was so upset about it and I followed everything else exactly that I signed on just so I could post this. What a mess...don't try it, at least not for company.

Excellent recipe, with a few small changes for our family to include a few things that we like in our stuffing. I did add a mess of fresh minced garlic and cut back on the onion and celery just a bit so I could add a cup or so of chopped carrot. I did double the spices and I kept the salt to a minimum. I used organic broth and all organic veggies/dry bread. Because it's tradition, I did add in chopped meat from the giblets and neck that I cooked down for the juice for gravy. Really, REALLY good. Even my husband who's super traditional when it comes to stuffing loved it.

I used this recipe last year for my first ever Thanksgiving and everybody LOVED IT.  I liked that you could just put it in a crock pot and forget about it while you prepare all the other stuff that goes along with a Thanksgiving meal.

Since I can't edit my first review, I will review it again. Okay, I loved the recipe the first few times, I didn't have a problem with it being soggy as I used stale white bakery buns. I also pre made some cooked white rice and as the day went on I added this to the stuffing. In the end the consistence of the stuffing was perfect as I was able to control how many ingredients I added. At one point, I decided to fry up some bacon bits and added that. The end result was delicious! I do not believe this is a recipe that you throw in the crock pot and ignor, I think it needs tweeking along the way.

The flavor was excellent!  It was very soupy though, but I didn't follow the suggestions to use dry stuffing mix.  I will definitely make this again with the dry stuffing and I bet that will be perfect.

I made last year and am planning on this recipe this year. It is a great recipe. I did as others and added sausage, but also dried cranberries. I stirred about every hour and added broth as it cooked. The amount of broth depends on your crockpot.  I have a stone one, so I came close to using all of the stated broth.  A very good recipe, tastes great and changes the "traditional" folks minds

We made this for Thansgiving and it was outstanding. Some tips: you can mix everything but the broth up the night before. We leave out the eggs just because it is our preference.  
A mix of white and dark bread (especially rye) make this even better.  
 A well greased crockpot prevents sticking. 
Add more broth while cooking if needed- we added about 3/4 -1 cup as is cooked.

I think this recipe was wonderful!! I added dried cherries to mine and used sliced portabello mushrooms instead of buttons and the whole thing was eaten up that day.

Only tip I have for this recipe is you really need to know how to "eyeball" things. For instance if you take a look at the breadcrumbs and spices and know that 4 1/2 cups of broth is going to be too much don't add all of it. That's why people were coming up with soggy stuffing. I only added a little at a time and it came out to about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of broth and it turned out perfect! 

Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!!

This is by far one of the easiest recipes I have ever made! It is far superior in taste then any other stuffing recipes.  I lilke to add green apples, cranberries and walnuts to mine as well.

This is by far one of the easiest recipes I have ever made! It is far superior in taste then any other stuffing recipes.  I lilke to add green apples, cranberries and walnuts to mine as well.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit.  Everyone was raving about it.  I didn't mention how easy it was.  
I didn't need all the broth, only using enough to moisten the bread crumbs.  I used half marble rye and half white bread.
A fantastic recipe!

I made this last Thanksgiving and my family decided that I am in charge of dressing anytime we have a turkey. I love that it frees up the oven. I change it up a bit every time - toasted pine nuts, diced apple, bacon, dried cranberries... This is a basic recipe that can be easily customized. I do recommend using the tea towel under the lid of the slow cooker to keep the dressing from getting soggy. Try it - you won't regret it

In combination with a slow cooker mashed potato recipe from this site, this recipe made my turkey dinner seem like no work at all. I prepped the day before and kept refrigerated until time to cook. I used the keep warm setting on my slow cooker as it gets quite hot, and cooked for about 7 hours. The stuffing was moist, with nice crisp bits around the outside edges. Very flavorful as well! I made a few slight adjustments to the recipe - using 1/2 the butter and omitting the mushrooms. I only needed to use 3.5 cups of the broth. The mixture was as moist as I typically make my stuffing. I am so happy to be able to streamline a typically work intensive meal. Thanks so much!

Almost perfect stuffing. Next time, the only chane I'd make would be to eliminate the salt. Even though I used low sodium broth, the additional salt was too much for us.  Otherwise this stuffing tasted just like it came from the bird.

My oven died on Tuesday before Thanksgiving! What a mess... BUT, I found the crock pot dressing recipie and read the comments about adding liquid carefully. I started with about 1.75 cups of broth & may have added about another 4 ounces by the time dinner was served. On high for 45 mins. then on low for 3 hours. It really was better than I expected! Family was happy with it too! Thanksgiving was saved. I may have discovered a new tradition: Stuffing in the crockpot & the turkey on the gas grill.

What a delicious and easy way to make stuffing! I stuffed my turkey with it and put the extra in the crock pot. It was great to free up some oven space. Thank you!

I made this for thanksgiving and it was my favorite dish of the day.  SO EASY!  And we all love one less thing to worry about on holidays.  I used the tip from another reviewer and put a kitchen towel under the lid of the crockpot, and that help keep the stuffing from getting too wet with condensation.  Great tip!  Also, you definitely need to use only about half the broth at first, then tinker with it later to get your desired level of moistness.   I used a honey wheat bread and a challah bread together, and I absolutely loved the combined flavors.

Great hit at a pot luck.  I did cut the chicken broth down and margerine down by half as suggested.  Also added two packages of sausage meat fried up, cut up and drained.  And about 1 1/2 cups of craisons really added a nice flavor.  Also cut back the cooking time...Start on high like it says and then down to low only for 2-3 hrs  max.

THANK YOU !! This was INCREDIBLE !!  A few minor changes...First of all, when I cook a turkey (about every other month) I make my own turkey stock and skim off all the fat.  Freeze both for later use.  So, I used turkey fat instead of butter and turkey stock instead of chicken broth (also only added the stock 1/2 cup at a time)  I used cubed bread (2 lbs) I cut the night before and left out to "air dry"  which will also affect the amount of liquid used. (Which ended up being only 2 cups)  Don't like mushrooms or eggs so I left them both out.  Cooked in the crock pot for 4 hours and EVERYONE was trying to figure out how I got so much stuffing out of my bird.  Many "grama's" and "great grams" stated this was the BEST stuffing they EVER had.

---I just made this for my 40 person family Christmas.  Everyone LOVED it!  I added 1 whole apple, chopped very fine.  I toasted the bread under broil for a few minutes as well.  It turned out great and I have been volunteered to make it again for Christmas day!  This time I am going to add some pecans!  Awesome recipe!

I am giving this 4 stars rather than 5, only because the recipe calls for a lot more broth than is needed. Otherwise, this is a delicious traditional stuffing that now is the only recipe I will use for Thanksgiving.

Awesome!  I have been looking for a recipe like my grandma used to make (she didnt use a written recipe, just made it to taste) this is the closest that I have found.  I didnt add the mushrooms because Grandma didnt, and I also baked it instead of putting it in the slow cooker.  Thanks for the recipe!

I give this 4 stars.  It takes alot for me to rate a recipe 5.  Don't get me wrong, however. This has very tasty and it was nice not to tie up the oven space.  Will pass recipe on and make again!

Loved the flavor of this! Have made it 3 times and 2 times it was perfect. The 3rd time it was a little mushier than we liked. Overall a great recipe!

This was a big hit! I used a box of Classic Stuffing from the grocery store plus most of a loaf of French bread which I cubed and let air dry for two days. I did not use mushrooms but added pork sausage and one diced apple. Delicious! Using the crock pot is the way to go. I uncovered it the last hour and it had just the right amount of moisture and crispness (add broth only as needed, as suggested). I can't wait to make this again. I might add another apple next time, and I want to try adding some cornbread. Thanks so much, Gayle!

I have to start by saying that I come from a family who did not let a holiday pass without Stove Top stuffing.  After trying this recipe out a few years ago, the boxed stuff is now a thing of the past... I never would've believed it!  This is now our family's go-to stuffing recipe... delicious!!  I cut an Italian bread loaf into cubes and toast them in the oven the day before.  The next day I cook everything in the slowcooker, except I leave out the mushrooms (we're not fans) and some of the extra spices besides poultry seasoning & sage.  I use up to 3 full cans of chicken broth (depending on how dry the bread is) and it comes out PERFECT every time!  You can also prep all the veggie's the night before, so when you're busy the next day in the kitchen, this comes together so easily.  If you're looking for the best & easiest stuffing recipe ever, then this is it!

This stuffing is phenomenal!  You can easily cut the butter in half and still keep the moistness of the dish.  Start with 2 cups of broth and add more if you need it (you probably won't).  I also used fresh herbs.

This was absolutely perfect for our Thanksgiving meal (9 people, half of whom are EXTREMELY picky eaters) this year!  I especially loved having the extra space in my oven!

I definitely made a few tweaks to the recipe to make it more "my own."  I used a mixture of croissants and good Italian white bread that I had cubed and dried in my oven.  Plus, when I melted the butter, I added the dried herbs in with the onion/celery/mushrooms, so that the herbs would eventually be evenly distributed throughout the bread mixture.

Finally, I added the chicken broth only a little at a time.  I didn't need nearly as much broth as the recipe calls for, as my bread was a little more fresh than the original recipe uses.

All in all I highly recommend this recipe, and it will certainly be used again!

I used 2 cans of chicken stock (a little less than 4 cups) and it was too moist.  I suggest using 1 1/2 cans or 2 1/2 to 3 cups of stock.  However, the flavor is great and everyone loved it.

I thought this stuffing was great as did everyone who tried it at Thanksgiving this year. I did use some common sense and only put in about half of the chicken broth and I also added a pound of sausage I precooked and chopped. I cut back on the butter too, it seemed like it could get too greasy with all of that butter, I only cooked it for 4 hours which was plenty! 8 hours and I would have ended up with a black stuffing brick! I just kept it on low and watched it, if I felt it was getting dry I added just a touch more broth and it came out just wonderful, it is definately the best stuffing I have made in my wife/mommy years to date! I highly recommend using this recipe just use some common sense along with it.

This was really good.  I just used actual bread crumbs and I should have used the packaged bread cubes.  I had to add a lot more water and broth, but it still tasted good.

i make this almost every Thanksgiving. It is moist and tastes similar to Stove top. sometimes i use preseasoned cubes, other times, plain & add spices in the recipe. either way it's a great way to save oven space on Thanksgiving.

I like my stuffing crispy.  The flavor of this is wonderful, but it was too moist for me.  Maybe it's because I dumped all of the 4 c of chicken broth in at once.  Next year, I'd like to add it as needed.  I love the taste of celery, onions, and mushrooms as I take bites, but it was all mixed together as one mushy substance.  It sounds like we didn't like it, but it was all eaten by the 6 of us.  It's hard to find stuffing for the crock pot to cook while we're camping.  I know this can be perfected to be less moist.  It takes the longest of our dishes to make, but it's so worth it!

Caution - Way too much liquid - I would cut it in half. I really had to work it to get it to dry out. Flavor good though.

This was delicious AND convenient!! A warning to others, though--make sure to turn the crockpot off when you begin serving--amidst all the excitement of Thanksgiving Dinner, we left the cooker on, and the bottom 1/4 cooked into a hard mass.

This recipe is good but I'm very glad I read some of the other reviews. I like stuffing to be moist and 2 1/2 - 3 cups of liquid was just right for me. I cooked on high for the first 45 mins and turned to low for 5 hours, stirring once after 2-3 hours. It seemed overcooked to me. I think next time I'll do 30 mins on high and 3 hours on low. I think with some changes this could be a 4 star recipe. I'm only giving it a 3 as is.

Much easier than trying to coordinate the stuffing with the turkey. I use a half cup butter though. A cup seems kind of ridiculous.

Very good! But I agree, too much salt. But I did add some pork sausage in mine. Next time, I will not. And omit the salt all together, IMO. I used 4 cups of chicken broth. I will save this recipe.

This was so easy and freed up my precious oven space.  Be sure to grease or butter the inside of your crockpot first.  My crockpot has 4 settings, 4, 6, 8 & 10 hours.  I used the 4 hour but only needed about 3.  Still came out really good with a crispy bottom.  This will become a regular method from now on!  Thanks for sharing Gayle!!

I love this recipe and have used it for the last two Thanksgiving.  It makes your house just smell like stuffing.  Yum!  My only complaint is that it sometimes gets a little burned on the sides, so you really need to keep an eye on it. But if you just mix it up, it still perfect!

I must admit that I don't think this stuffing "looks" the most appetizing, but it certainly TASTES LIKE HEAVEN! I made a traditional stuffing w/apricots to go inside of the actual turkey, which all of my family and relatives love, but this year they told me that this one is their new favorite so I better make it again each year! I loved that it made so much and I had plenty on hand, which is always a problem with our family of 14+!

I made this stuffing this year for 16 people. I did not have a slow cooker so I made the stuffing in a large pot and let it cook on the stove for about an hour on LOW heat. Then I put the stuffing in the over on about 250 degrees for 3.5 hours. It turned out delicious! It was very moist and flavorful...everyone loved it!

This is now my go to Holiday recipe. Took the advise of others and decreased the amount of broth but noticed it did taste kind "gummy" second time I made it I used less butter which seemed to help. Both times this was the dish everyone raved about forget 2nd's they went back for 3rd and 4th helpings.

This was great stuffing.  I used the packaged bread cubes instead of regular bread and it was very easy to make in the slow cooker.  I buttered the inside and would recommend that.  It made the entire house smell great.

I just tried this tonight after reading the past reviews.  I lowered the chicken broth to about 2 cups and a few hours into the cooking time the stuffing looked great.  I knew that the recipe said to cook longer, so I left the crock pot on and watched a movie.  When I got back upstairs, the stuffing was RUINED!  It was gloppy and burnt and looked like pureed baby food!  I just got back from the store and will try this same recipe tomorrow (THANKSGIVING DAY 2007)since it tasted great in the middle of the cooking process.  I will post an update after Turkey Day to let you know how it turned out. UPDATE NOV 22, 2007:  Tried again today.  Turned out GREAT!  Used just half of the broth, only warmed it up in the crock pot and then let it sit until an hour before dinner and then turned it back on low heat.  It was perfect!  The trick is: don't stir too long, use all the broth or let sit on heat too long and it won't turn to moosh.  Will definately make again next year!

I made this last year and I tweaked w/it a bit. I didnt use Mushrooms only because I dont like them. Instead of the BREADCRUMBS  I baked a 13x9 Pan of JIFFY CORNBREAD, about 3-4 boxes. Everything else I used and kept a close eye on it just making sure it didnt dry out. IT WAS  Let me tell you the BEST ! THE best! I think the Corn bread of course does the trick!  I will be passing this along to all my bloggers and myspacers and family and friends!! I think I will make some even before Thanksgiving!!

This was great!  I added some bacon to the celery/onion mixture, and mmmmmmmm! was it good!  I did cut down on the chicken broth as others did, and I mixed it every hour so it would not burn on the bottom.  Thanks Gayle for this great recipe!!

This was a hit at Thanksgiving. My husband loved the fact that I didn't do the typical dry Stove Top stuff. When I put it in on Wednesday afternoon, we went to the movies and I had left the slow cooker on high -- big mistake! When I returned home, it had burned on the bottom. I merely discared the burned stuff and it was fine. Love the convenience of having this cook in the slow cooker and not taking up room in the oven or on the stove. I followed the recipe exactly. This is supposed to be a soft dressing, not hard. The next day, I just had to turn on the slow cooker to low and it heated up beautifully and even tasted better. Also, I just used a bag of Pepperidge Farms bread crumbs instead of making my own. Will be making this every Thanksgiving from now on.

This is the best stuffing I ever made.  I didn't have dried marjoram.  It is a too moist for us, but next time I will cut down on the chicken broth.  I used Pepperidge Farms Stuffing, instead of the dry bread cubes.  This is a keeper.

Very moist.  Only used 1/2 of the broth. Only cooked for about 4 hours which was plenty.  Didn't get hard on the side.   Nice flavor.  Great not having to use up the space in the oven.  Will continue to use and pass recipe on.  Thanks

I made this without the eggs.  It tasted like it was cooked in the turkey.  I also used some of the drippings from the turkey. Replacing some of the butter it called for. 
I never cook it any other way now. Simply delicious!!

We're not big stuffing people, but DH likes it. I made this with homemade dense bread, thyme instead of marjoram, and about 3 c of broth. I used about 1/4 c of bacon fat I had + 1/2 stick of butter and that seemed to be an ample amount of fat. I made it in the crock and fridged it, then the day of, I put it on High for 1 hr, then Low. After 4 hours on Low, the outer edges were very very brown and I stirred it for even cooking in the last hour. I was pretty impressed with the flavor, although next time I'd omit the salt if I used bacon fat again.

I have served this stuffing at the last 3 Thanksgivings that I have hosted. Its a fantastic way to make stuffing and not take up any more stove space. I do add some sage sausage, I give the sliced mushrooms a rough chop and like the other reviews I cut the chicken broth in half. I start with just adding 2 cups, if its still really dry I add a bit more and after cooking half way I take a quick taste and maybe add more if needed. My crock pot cooks really fast so I cook it on low for 2 hours.

This was the hit of the Thanksgiving feast. So easy and freed up oven space. Perfect for the Vegetarians at my table. This will be a regular addition to Thanksgiving from now on.

I was looking for a nice recipe for dressing to take to a work luncheon this week.  I tested it over the weekend and am I glad I did.  This dressing was swimming in butter.  It had a gummy, mushy, and sticky consistency.  I followed the directions and only changed the amount of broth at the advice of reviews to be sure I didn't use too much. 

The taste wasn't bad but I would never serve this to anyone.  I was really disappointed.  I WANTED to love this.

I offered to cook Thanksgiving dinner this year for my family, which was my first attempt ever at a meal so large.  This recipe for stuffing turned out great and it was the hit of the dinner.  I left out the mushrooms and used about half the chicken stock.. I think this will become a staple in our family for years to come.

This review is for the cooking method and time not the ingredients! I have always been worried about not cooking my stuffing in the oven with the turkey, but this year I simply didn't have the room. This recipe used very similar quantities to my family's traditional recipe, so I adapted the method and was thrilled with the results. I will always make stuffing like this in the future.

This tasted sooo good!!  I used 2.5 cups broth, and even though the top was nice and moist, the bottom was close to burning, so watch it after about 3 hours or so!

This was my first year making Thanksgiving dinner, and I will continue to make this recipe every year.  My family loved it saying it was the best they'd ever had.  Cooking time was only about 4 hrs and 45 min.  I used fresh herbs and only 2.5 cups broth.  Two large loafs of bread made just enough bread cubes.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

OMG this is the best stuffing. I fried up sausage and used the drippings instead of butter. I halved the recipe because we didn't need that much and it still made at least 10 servings. It was delicious and SO easy to do in the crockpot.

Wow!  What a great way to make stuffing.  Very easy and no messy turkey cleanup after.  Had to make this over the objections of significant other who really wanted traditional stuffing.  But once he tasted it, he apologized profusely and said it was better than usual.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This came out too mushy for us and that was even after having the top off for the last 45 minutes hoping it would dry up somewhat.  It went down the disposal after Thanksgiving Dinner.  I had hoped it would eliminate one thing from the oven.  Back to my old recipe!

This is now my one and only stuffing! Not only is it delicious, but not having to put yet another thing in the  overfilled Thanksgiving oven is a major plus! I used 1/2 cornbread and 1/2 herb seasoned bread cubes. Also added pecans and apples. Used 2 cups of broth, and it turned out absolutely perfect.

This is the best stuffing recipe ever.  Once it's in the crock pot it's one less thing to worry about.  It turns out moist and wonderful.  I do add cubed potatoes and about a 1/2 cup more broth than whats called for(this is my second year making this) and it's perfect!! Thanks so much

I liked the idea of cooking the stuffing in the crock pot to free up oven space, but I thought the taste was just okay. An hour or so into cooking I checked and saw it was getting pretty crisp on the bottom, so I added some of the turkey juices, and that helped keep it moist until it was done cooking.

Very good.  Omitted the mushrooms and used 50% cornbread.  The 4 1/2 Cups of broth called for in the recipe was just the right amount.

I love that this is made in the crockpot. It is a great recipe that you can tinker with to get perfect to your own taste.  Thank you so much for this!

This is the best stuffing recipe ever!  I only used 1 can of chicken broth and it was perfect.  Everyone raved!  This was the best part of the meal!  Thanks for a wonderful new "tradition" for my family!!

This was okay - I liked that I could have extra room on the stovetop, but found the stuffing to be gooey and tough after sitting in the crockpot!

Excellent!  I toasted and tore up two loaves of plain white bread instead of using bread cubes and I omitted the mushrooms, but other than that, followed the recipe as written.  I followed other reviewers' advice and started with 2 cups of broth. I ended up adding maybe another 1/2 cup.  This was almost identical to the stuffing I make, but using the crockpot was awesome!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This recipe saved the day today!  We tried a UK-version of stuffing - came out terrible - THANK GOODNESS I had made this in the slow cooker  - as a "just-in-case"!!!!!  The only change I made was to add cooked hot sausage (Jimmy Dean) and to omit the mushrooms.  

THANK YOU!!!!  I will use this recipe again!!!! :-)

I made this for a "practice run" yesterday and I'm glad I did.  Don't Like the marjoram at all, and it was too moist(only used 1 1/2 cans of broth).  I think it would have been ready to eat at 4 hrs. and I got a crust all around to crock pot.  I think I will try it again with ammendments.  No mushroom, marjoram less broth and less cook time.

This stuffing was great. I was nervous about using a new recipe for Thanksgiving dinner, but since my oven was occupied with 22lbs of Turkey, I took a chance and will use this recipe again. The stuffing was moist, flavorful, and GONE.

I make this at every T-giving and Christmas. delicious.

 the only downsides: It takes awhile to prep and cook.  I also have to add lots more bread, as the day goes on.

This one is a keeper! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I made sure to read all the reviews first and was sure to use the tea towel under the lid;  intermittently add enough broth to moisten it (4 cups); stirred frequently. Note: My mom has Celiac so I used Gluten Free Herb & Garlic croutons. It turned out great but was rather expensive. Next time I'll buy the GF bread and give it  a few days to dry out.

I made according to the directions except followed some of the tips provided in previous reviews- such as cooking the onions more, I used fresh mushrooms, and cut down on the amount of broth, adding some later as it cooked. It was moist and flavorful, very nice recipe!

I would have given 5 stars but was a little too moist for our liking.  Next time I will add less chicken broth. Good recipe, I did add sausage that I saute with onion and celery, added a nice flavour.

This recipe is a tradition in my family! About an hour before finished we throw in about 1pound fresh shucked ousters and it is to die for! ( not every one likes ousters so often we take half out and finish cooking in oven)

SO yummy! I didn't have dry bread, so I just cut sandwich bread into cubes and toasted it in the oven until it was dry.  I took the advice of another reviewer and just stirred in all of the herbs, salt, and pepper into the butter before mixing it with the bread cubes. This will definitely be a repeat recipe every Thanksgiving!

SO yummy! I didn't have dry bread, so I just cut sandwich bread into cubes and toasted it in the oven until it was dry.  I took the advice of another reviewer and just stirred in all of the herbs, salt, and pepper into the butter before mixing it with the bread cubes. This will definitely be a repeat recipe every Thanksgiving!

This was a very tasty recipe, even my husband liked it a lot and he does not really like stuffing. I used one of the crock pot liner bags which was a good thing because before I knew it, it start to stick to the bag and I absolutely hate cleaning the crock pot. I did use extra broth at the end and added more salt. I'm not a saltaholic but I just thought it tasted better that way. I will be making this recipe whenever I want stuffing during the year.

After making this stuffing in the crock pot it will be the only way I make it now!  Came out GREAT - and my guests were asking for the recipe.  I did use less broth then it called otherwise I think it would of been too soggy. Next time I need to make more because we only ended up with alittle for left overs.

This stuffing recipe was disappointing.  You'll need to watch this closely as on a low setting, it almost burns to the sides, so stir and monitor the moistness level.   I would also say that the flavors weren't as robust as I would have liked them to be.

I made this for Christmas dinner, it was terrible!  It was extremely soggy and mushy.  I put it in the over for 40 minutes, that did not help.  I was embarassed to serve it.  I'm not sure how it got such good reviews.  Usually 4 or 5 stars means the recipe is really good.  This is the first time that was way off.

Convenient but not the best stuffing. I even took some other's advice and altered it a little. It started out too dry and by the end it was way too wet. The taste was fine but it wasn't very appetizing to look at.

Too soggy for me.  I thought I screwed up and I may still have, but I read the other reviews and don't feel so bad I wasn't the only one....cause I didn't want to make as much as the recipe called for, so I tried to 1/2 it.  I probably used too much chicken broth still.  My husband loved this though.  I myself wasn't crazy about the spices.  But like I said, I "1/2'd" the recipe and I don't ever measure my spices, so I still may have used to much.  Glad I only made 1/2, there was way too much left over.
I think this recipe would be great with your own tweaking and preferences so I won't give up on it yet.  It was too easy.  LOL

I made this last year for Thanksgiving dinner, and I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it was super soggy. The texture turned everyone off, and we had a lot of leftovers that we had to throw away. I was disappointed because normally, stuffing is my favorite part of Thanksgiving dinner. Maybe if you added less chicken broth?

I made this for Christmas and it was REALLY WELL RECEIVED! Everyone loved it.
Changes I made: I Used Knorr Chicken Boullion-used 2 with required water. I also only had Portobello Mushrooms in my fridge--and the flavour from these were awesome! I cut the Butter down to half. 
This recipe was enough for 10 Adults and kids too. The BEST--I will make again!

Some members of my family do not like mushrooms so I left those out.  I put the melted butter, spices and vegetables in the refrigerator overnight so I only had to add the cornbread/bread crumbs the next morning.  I also used chicken bullion instead of stock.  Everyone one loved it.

This gets better each time we reheat for another serving!  I had to cook for approx 10mins extra (using oven recipe and not slow cooker recipe), or it was soggy.  
Also made it with gluten-free bread and no one could tell the difference!!

This had really good flavor.  I used fresh bread which may have causes it to be soggy.  I ended up adding about 1 & 1/2 cups of store bought bread cubes.  Also, this works well with fresh herbs.

This stuffing was ok but not the best. I reduced the liquid and cut the cooktime and the temp but it still came out dark and crusty on the sides. I was not that impressed

This stuffing was great!  I'm without a stove right now so this presented a perfect alternative cooking method.  I cut the receipe in half and used chantrelle mushrooms.  Yum!  Yum!

I didn't have a good experience with this recipe, however it's probably my own fault. I have a small slow cooker so I had to cut the recipe in half. I left it in for just over 8 hours and when I took it out, the outer edges had gotten hard and crunchy and a burnt smell had gone through to the rest of the stuffing. I think it would have tasted ok if I'd cooked it for 4 hours at the most but still not as good as when I cook it in the turkey.
