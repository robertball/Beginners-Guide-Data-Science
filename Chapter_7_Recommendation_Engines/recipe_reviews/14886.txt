This wasn't very good.  tasted like limeaid, not a gimlet.  You're supposed to use Rose's Lime Juice AND fresh lime, and no sugar.  I generally use vodka, too.  Oh well.

One of my favorite drinks! I usually make mine 2:1 gin to Rose's Lime (the best sweetened lime juice), and garnish with a lime instead of the sugared rim.

One of my favorite cocktails! I only used fresh lime juice. I don't think the sweetened would be very good but I like sour flavors.

I agree that gin and lime are a great combination!  The gimlet is one of my favorite cocktails.  This one is way too sweet for me, even without the added sugar.  I usually use 1 sweetened lime juice and two parts gin.  When I have fresh limes on hand, I like to use 2 oz. gin, 1/2 oz. Rose's, and 3/4 z. fresh lime juice.

Use Duffy's Lime Juice if you can find it.  Best in Gimlets and Margaritas.

ALMOST right. You definitely don't need the added white sugar if you use sweentend lime juice, unless you like it REALLY sweet like a soft drink. Go with straight lime juice and the white sugar OR the sweetened limes juice (like Rose's). Now that's the perfect Gimlet. No need to rim the glass...that's too froufrou and girly. 

I have a set of shimy aluminum "gimlet glasses" from my parents (and grandparents). I remember my parents and grandparents making a batch of Gimlets and drinking from these glasses. The condensation would form on the outside of the metal and create "sweat beads" in the hot weather.

Excellent recipe for the classic & classy GIN gimlet (if you ask for a "gimlet" you will automatically get gin, as it was in the original cocktail).  If you want vodka, you have to specifically request a VODKA gimlet.  Also, "sweetened lime juice" is, in the 'bartender's guide', a generic term for the syrupy green bottled lime concoction most well-known as "Rose's Lime Juice".  I am pretty sure "Dr. John" didn't mean fresh lime juice sweetened to taste.  But I could be wrong . . . this is a lovely little cocktail!  Thanks for reminding me, Dr. J!

mmm mmm, another reviewer said it best - "nothing goes better with gin than lime"  amen to that. I used 2:1:1 lime infused gin, unsweetened lime juice, white sugar and gave it good shaking with about a cup of ice in my cocktail shaker. Now I want to go out and buy more gin and lime juice!

One of my favorites, but I had an interesting twist on it lately at a restaurant in Spokane, WA last weekend, that had muddled basil in it.  It was much sweeter than I make mine, so I tried the variation at home.  I usually buy a 5th of gin, pour off about a quarter of it and make gin and tonics, then refill the bottle to the top with half simple syrup and Rose's Lime Juice and put it in the freezer.  The ratio seems about perfect.  Not too sweet, not too lime-y, not too booze-y.  This batch I'm going to start adding basil to each glass and see how it turns out.
