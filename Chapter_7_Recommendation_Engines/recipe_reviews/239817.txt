Made for the Buzz Recipe Group Selection. In 1979, I bought my first microwave and I have been making different types of brittle since that time. I followed the ingredients exactly but not the directions. I have found I have better results if I do not add the roasted nuts at the beginning but cook the sugar and corn syrup mixture for about 2 minutes, pause and stir, cook for 2 minutes and then add the nuts and cook about 2 1/2 minutes more.  I then add the butter and vanilla extract and cook 2½ minutes. Pour into the prepared pan.  When the brittle gets cool enough to touch, I lightly sprinkle chopped nuts over the top and gently press them into the brittle, score the brittle with a sharp knife and allow to cool completely.  When cooled, I cut into pieces and store in containers.  Makes a beautiful, golden brittle which is well received and enjoyed.

I made this a few times for Christmas baskets when it was a personal recipe. On my first try I thought it was a goner trying to spread it on the pan. Maybe I just didn't realize how fast you have to move. Regardless, I used foil and a hot pad and pushed it around which worked well. It tasted great and had just the right crunch without being sticky or too hard. On another attempt, I tried to double it which I do not recommend. I ended up with more of a taffy that stuck to everything and would not set I could not repurpose it since it became one with the foil. Likely my own fault but I wanted to offer my experience and the advice to not double it.

I made it with the exact ingredients, but I did it on the Stove in a Stainless Steel Pot. I had more control using the pot than using the microwave, I could cook it until it gets to the exact color I wanted.  I also waited until the end to put in the cashews, then I put in the baking soda. Fairly easy recipe.

O M G is all I can say !! I have never made brittle because it seemed soooo complicated to make. But saw your recipe for cashews instead of peanuts and, being a huge fan of cashews, I tried it. It was so easy and sooo-ooo delicious! Only thing I did different was added the cashews after it already cooked a few minutes in the microwave, based on another review that I saw. I can't see how this can turn out bad no matter when you add them! Thanks for such a great and easy recipe, I'll look for more from you. Thanks again!

Wonderful and indulgent recipe. The softness of the cashews are a nice contrast to the crunchy brittle and the saltiness balances the sweetness ideally. I used a combination of whole and coarsely chopped cashews and a generous 1.5 cup measure so there were lots of cashews in every bite. Very nice for holiday gift giving and a nice change from using peanuts. Using the microwave was really easy too. Just make sure you use a bowl big enough to accommodate "bubbling" when cooking and one with a handle (if you can) because the bowl does get hot and having a handle makes it easier to hold. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*) Thanks SHORECOOK for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

This was super simple and came out perfectly! I followed another reviewer's advice and stirred at 2 and 4 minutes, adding the cashews at the 4 minute mark. It is definitely best to chop the cashews for even distribution. A 1.5 qt. pyrex bowl was the perfect size.

Burned to a crisp in my microwave after 5:45. My microwave is only 1000 watts. Bummed to lose all those cashews!

The only changes made were to cook on stove top in a heavy pot. Per another reviewer I had more control, since my micro is not powerful. Was delicious, plus I was able to get better color by melting the sugar first then adding the butter and syrup. The texture was just great and lots of nuts (used cashews). Have already made it 3 times. It will be made again.
Maybe next time I will use a mix of brown and white sugar...

Good recipe! To get the hot mixture spreadout on the cookiesheet I spread a piece of wax paper over the hot sticky mixture and rolled it out with a rolling pin.

Yummy and so easy. I use half dark and half light Karo syrup. Turns out great every time. (And sometimes use pecans or mixed nuts instead of peanuts.)

I thought I followed this to the T, but it came out really bad. It started burning in the microwave at 4 minutes. I took it out and kept going. By the time I spread it on the baking sheet, it was a glossy mess that clung together and wouldn't spread. I reread the recipe to see if I had done anything wrong. The only difference was that I used a plastic dish instead of glass or ceramic. It's a Pampered Chef dish designed for the microwave. Is that why my results were so different from the other glowing reviews?

Made this on a lark for Christmas Eve.  Everyone loved it....now making it for my in-laws' Christmas gathering as gifts.  Tasty and easy.  In addition to cashews will also be using pecans, walnuts, cranberries and dried cherries.

Recipe Group Selection for December 1, 2004 -  I have found that Shorecook’s recipes are wonderful.  This recipe is no exception.  This is an easy candy recipe that you don’t need to watch the candy thermometer.  It comes out perfect.  If you love cashews, you’ll love this recipe.
