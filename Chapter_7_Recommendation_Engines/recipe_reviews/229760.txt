This is very close if not equal to Inca Mama's. I halved the recipe on my own and added a tablespoon of cilantro prior to blending, because I love cilantro. Delicious!!

It's just as simple, easy, and tasty as advertised, and then some!  I love it.  This one's keeper!

 Thank you, Inka Mama!

This was fantastic! Tastes exactly like the sauce they serve at our fave Peruvian restaurant. I added a few more cloves of garlic for a bolder taste. Will make this again! Thanks for sharing!

Exactly like my favorite Peruvian restaurant, my wife was thoroughly wowed, and I can't stop sneaking a teaspoon whenever I sneak past the kitchen!  Went very well with the Peruvian Cilantro Chicken recipe which is also available online here.  Next time I'm planning to add some cilantro, and to only use one quarter to one half of the quantity.
