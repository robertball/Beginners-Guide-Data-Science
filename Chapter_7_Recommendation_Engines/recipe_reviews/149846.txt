This recipe was awesome!    I didn't have a teaball or cheesecloth bag so I put the cinnamon sticks & cloves in a peeled orange...it worked well.  The only other different thing I did was put the ingredients in a crock pot on low and I also dumped in a can of fruit cocktail for the kids...the house smelled delicious!  This will defintely be a keeper around the holidays!!!

This was a Christmas family gathering hit! People asked for the recipe. But for ours, I forgot to pick up the pineapple juice, and therefore substituted about 1/3 or 1/2 can of concentrated orange juice. (Not diluted) It was great!!!

Good and easy for a holiday treat.  We usually enjoy mulled wine, but for health reasons must abstain from the alcohol.  This recipe is an excellent substitute.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit with everyone, kids and adults.  People were drinking 3 or 4 mugs and I made a whole 2nd double batch.  I went the easy route and just dumped everything in my crock pot on high, sprinkled ground versions of the spices right in the punch and a few cinnamon sticks too and gave it a good stir.  This will definitely be a tradition for our family's Thanksgivings from here out!

The cider is very tasty but... Using allspice, which obviously does not stay in the cheese cloth, produces a sediment in the persons cup. I would try another whole spice or just use a little more whole cloves.

I made this punch for two parties in the last week.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.
