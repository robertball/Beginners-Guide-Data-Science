Mmmmm, this is a delicious snack cake for the holiday season, but it also makes a great breakfast bread when company is over. However, I didn't choose to give this recipe a five star rating because of one small problem. In my opinion, this cake has an overload of spices. All of my family members commented on this being a rather strong cake. With mixed spice, cinnamon, and lemon zest, this cake is more than spicy. What I would recommend to others trying this recipe is to choose add the suggested amount of cinnamon and lemon zest, and leave out the mixed spice. With two spices, the mixed spice is fairly useless.

This was my first attempt ever at a fruitcake.  I panicked after I got it in the pan and realized it had no leavening!  However, none of the other "English" Christmas cakes have any leavening at all, but all the fruitcakes call for some.  Anyway, it was fine.  A nice dense texture.  I'm not so crazy about raisins so I substituted chopped dried mango, craisins, and dates for about half the raisins, I sort of wish I'd soaked the fruit in a bit of brandy beforehand, but maybe not.  Perhaps in jolly old England they have crazy big 8" square pans, but I had to put this guy in a 9"x13" pan.  I baked for 3 hours and it was perhaps a little overdone, but a nice almost caramelized crust on top.  The almonds are fabulous in this, I wish I'd added a few more; I used slivered almonds.  The taste is very rich and buttery.  The texture is a bit dry, but very good with coffee or tea.

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  I only made it yesterday without any waiting or soaking or even any brandy at all, so am sure with these it will be even better.  Most English fruitcakes are too hard or dry, but this one came out perfectly.  Thanks.
