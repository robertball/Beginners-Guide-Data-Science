Delicious!  I made this cake for my birthday and my husband and I both really enjoyed it.  I used Cool Whip instead of whipping cream.  I only used real whipping cream for the 1/4 cup you mix into the melted chocolate chips.  The only thing I would change next time would be to use fewer chocolate chips.  It was a bit too heavy in the stomach as is.  Next time, I'd reduce the chocolate chips to maybe 1 cup or 3/4 cup instead of 1.5 cups.  Other than that, a beautiful and delicious cake.  I'll be making it again.

This cake was absolutely exquisite.  Everything about this cake was delectable.  I particularly enjoyed that this wonderfully chocolate cake was not too heavy.  Like another reviewer mentioned -- I recommend letting your cream warm to room temperature before adding it to the chocolate -- or simply heat it in the microwave for a few seconds to warm. This will prevent the chocolate from seizing. One other note, when I chilled the filling for 30 minutes it was way too stiff to spread -- but maybe my refrigerator was too cold.  In any case, I would skip that step next time.  All in all this was a wonderful recipe and I received nothing but rave reviews!

This is a great idea for a cake-mix cake - although I would suggest making the devil's food cake mix to the specifications listed under the "too much chocolate cake" recipe on this site - it uses more oil and some sour cream and insures that the cake will stay moist!  Hazelnuts are kind-of pricey and this was a tester cake so I used toasted almonds instead.  For frosting I looked at the "cool whipped frosting" recipe from this site but used 8 oz. of fresh cream instead of Cool Whip.  I also would recommend, if using that frosting recipe, that you only use HALF the amount of the pudding mix and that you buy instant WHITE CHOCOLATE pudding rather than vanilla.  The vanilla gave my cake a yellow-ish tint that I did not like...next time I will use a classic, white buttercream with this cake instead....

Delicious cake!  I only had two 9" cake pans so I made a 2- instead of 3-layer cake, so the extra filling I spread on top of the cake before frosting it.  I didn't have any problem with letting the filling chill completely before spreading it, as some reviewers mentioned.  Also, be aware that if you make the frosting as written (NOT with Cool Whip), it won't be sweet, just creamy/nutty.  It can be a nice touch to offset all the sweetness of the cake and filling, but just be aware of that.  Taste a little while you're whipping the cream and if you don't like it as is, add a pinch or two of white sugar, until it's *just* sweet enough.  I left mine as is and feel it's a nice contrast, especially since I don't like super-sweet frostings, but it also would have been good with a small pinch of sugar.

This was a wonderful cake!  Wasn't too hard to make and turned out perfect the first time.  Instead of using the whipping cream for the topping, I folded a teaspoon of almond extract into a tub of Cool Whip with the chopped nuts and it was delicious.  

One tip is to warm the whipping cream to room temperature before wisking it into the melted chocolate chips (wisking very fast and adding the cream very slowly), this helped keep it smooth.  Adding the cream while it was cold made the chocolate sieze up a little and made more of a ganache than a smooth mixture.  However, I still crumbled it into the whipped cream and got gooey chocolate bits inside the cream...... YUM!  I almost liked it better that way than when I got it right with the second cake!  ;)

I made this cake for a family dinner and it's the only time a whole cake has been eaten before the end of the day.  I usually take a bunch of leftovers home, but not this time.  I did add some Nutella to the filling mixture, but it really didnt need it.  I will definately be making this again.

Looking for a way to "jazz" up a chocolate cake mix?  This was delicious.  Instead of using the hazelnuts  whipping cream (which sounds wonderful) I used the "Fluffy Creamy Icing" found on this site.  Tasted great and there were no leftovers!

I was really excited to make this cake for my sister's birthday. I was confident that it would be delicious since it had so many great reviews. I was completely disappointed.The cake was bland and the whipped cream frosting was tasteless.

Wonderful!  I made it for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it.  I did, of course, change it a bit.  Instead of water, I added brewed coffee.  And for the final frosting, I mixed cream cheese in with the whipped cream for a more substantial icing.  It was great.

I have made this cake three times now for different birthday parties. It is truly the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. For one birthday I removed the hazelnuts (peanut allergies) and it was still amazing. Loved it

This cake was fantastic and easy to make!  I made it for a get together with all women.  You know it's good when women are having seconds and wanting to take it home!  I did follow the tip about the 1/4 cup cream coming to room temp before mixing it with the melted chocolate.  That helped a great deal along with adding it slowly and whisking quickly.  Next time I make it I think I will use a higher grade chocolate to give the filling an even richer flavor.  This recipe is a keeper!

Loved it!! Although I did  make a change or two the second time, not that the original recipe needed it. I added two TBSP of peanut butter to some cool whip for the topping ( I didn't have the called for ingredients) and we used some Nutella in-between the layers of cake. Yummy!

I made this for my husbands birthday. Not a crumb left! I substituted almonds for the hazelnuts, because I couldn't find any hazelnuts. Also, almond extract fot the vanilla. Unbelievable cake. It was a hit and I will definitely make again.

I liked this recipe a lot when I saw it. I had been searching for a hazelnut cake recipe that I could tweak and found this one. Instead of adding pudding mix I bought the chocolate cake mix with pudding added. Then I added about a tbsp of hazelnut syrup (didn't have extract) to the cake batter, chocolate cream, and frosting. It was awesome. Everybody at the office raved about it and the family joking said I can now open my own cake shop.

WOW!!!  Awesome!! I made this for a bridal shower (only change is I did a buttercream icing on the outside- not the icing in recipe ) Rave rave reviews - now one of the layers on the wedding cake will be the chocolate and hazelnut filling-  YUM! 
The bride-to-be had two slices-YES it's that good!

If you really love hazelnut, this is your cake!  I loved this cake, but I think that the icing needs a little kick.  I would add a little sugar or vanilla to the whipping cream the next time.  The texture was really nice, it tasted like a bakery cake...delicious!  I put chocolate covered hazelnuts on top of the cake along with chocolate shavings, and it was a big hit!

I made this cake for my fiances birthday and it was a BIG HIT! I wish i had taken a picture to put up on the site cause it looked really good too. Besides putting plain hazelnuts to decorate it I also put some chocolate covered hazelnuts on it too to make it look prettier. Not very difficult to make and it's really delicious! I highly recommend it.

The cake and the filling were wonderful! Good taste and the cake was nice and light. I was not a fan of the whipped cream frosting, though.  I thought it would offset the sweetness of the rest of the cake, but instead it was tasteless, and the textures didn't work well together. Next time I'll experiment with a buttercream or cream cheese icing.

This was fantastic!!  Several folks thought it was bought at a fancy bakery.  I think next time I won't buy the cake mix that has pudding already in the cake.  It didn't rise that well.  I think the amount of chocolate chips was perfect though!  Thanks so much for the recipe - will definitely be making it again!

This cake was a HUGE hit!! It was incredibly beautiful and tasted just as good. I added an extra 1/2 cup of hazelnuts to give it a little more flavour and it worked really well. If you are a chocolate lover, I would definitely recommend this cake.

Great recipe and easy too.  I replaced the hazelnuts for toffe chips and was very pleased with the results!  I made the cake the day before I needed it and frosted it the day of the party - it worked out great.
