This is THE BEST mac and cheese EVER!  The sausage with the pear makes it mouth watering, and it comes out of the oven bubbling and scenting the whole house with homemade goodness.  I highly recommend!  I made a huge casserole and it disappeared almost immediately.

I served this Mac and Cheese with a salad and my family said it was a great meal.  I followed the recipe to a T until I only found Colby Jack cheese in my fridge.  I used it and it was still delicious with the pear.  Next time I will try with cheddar.  To another reviewer, if your sauce is gritty either your Parmesan was of low quality or you overheated your sauce and it separated.  Don't hard boil the milk based sauce.  Will make again, thanks.

Really good recipe.  It reminds me of all the best stuff on the cheese/fruit/sausage tray.  It's also really adaptable - I used shallots instead of onions.  I could see mushrooms or roasted fennel also being a great addition

This turned out pretty well.  I forgot to get pears at the store so I made it without.  I did add a small can of diced peppers to give it a little extra spice.  The texture of the sauce did turn out a bit grainy, I'm wondering if maybe the parmesan did that since I've made similar sauces and never had that trouble.  I think we will try this recipe again, maybe with a spicier meat and no parmesan. I also didn't add any butter to the bread crumbs, just sprinkled them on top before baking it.

This is an excellent recipe! I only had a 2-quart casserole dish, so it worked better to use a large saucepan for the cheese sauce, mix everything in there, and then transfer it all into the baking dish - fits just fine when you don't need to mix it!
Great with the sharp cheddar, might also be fun with a variety of cheeses. Will be doing this again!

I used Gruyere, Fontina,  a little Italian blend cheese and 1/2 cup cheddar. I substituted Bacon and used  Bosch  pears. Added a little red pepper flake kick and it was  enjoyed by all.

We really enjoyed this! We had Aidell's mushroom and swiss sausages and they were perfect for the dish. I didn't have any pears so I skipped that and would like to try  it next time, but didn't really miss them. And I had Panko crumbs, not regular bread crumbs,  but those were the only changes I made. We will definitely have this again!

Oh Yea! All I can say is this is like no other! At first I was wondering if it would be good but figured why not! I did add 1extra cup of mozzarella cheese and didn't have bread crumbs so I put on a whole roll of Ritz crackers and added a melted stick of butter on top! It was a hit!!! I also used chicken and cheese sausage inside! It's too die for and it feed all six of us! I was worried about only using 8oz of noodles!!  I will definitely be using this again and recommending it to EVERYONE!

Its pretty tasty, I bet it'd be better with smoked sausage. I used sweet sausage. Everyone enjoyed it. I didn't use pears, sounded crazy. I used less sausages.
