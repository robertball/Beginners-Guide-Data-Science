I'm Native Hawaiian and we serve this a lot at parties and luaus, using huge portions.  What's good about this, its a smaller portion.  Next time I make this I will cut back on the long rice and use 1 package.  I also didn't use patis,  I used chicken stock in the carton with less sodium and it still came out great.

Great recipe. I doubled the recipe and instead of using chicken thighs, I used chicken tenders. I also added 2T oyster sauce and green onions. Family loved it.  I brought some to work so my co-workers could try it. It was a success and I will be making it for our Hawaiian  themed summer bash party..

I made it just like the recipe EXCEPT I didn't have any bokchoy. It was delicious! I made it as a main dish instead of a side dish and I was filled and happy. My left overs made great side dishes though. I will absolutely make it again!

I added twice as much garlic and ginger for extra flavor and it turned out great. I also did about 1/2 the noodles

I almost tripled the recipe for a dinner at my church. I have sliced green onion in a bowl on the side in case anyone wants to garnish with them. I am from Hawai'I and this is great. Ono brah, good da kine grinds! Aloha pumehana
