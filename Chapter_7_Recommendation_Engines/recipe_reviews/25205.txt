My husband and I loved these burgers. They were so moist. I didn't have condensed milk so I just used regular and it was fine. Also I added 2 teaspoons of brown sugar. I was really suprised at how good they were. 
Thank-You

So easy to make and so moist. Made hamburger sandwiches out of leftovers, with just mustard and dill pickle slices.  Awesome.....

These were delicious and very easy to make. I made a sauce out of equal parts barbecue sauce and ketchup, and both my hubby and I really enjoyed them. Thanks for sharing!

These were pretty good burgers and easy to make. My husband is the only one in the family that didn't like them. One out of six isn't bad! As to the comment about these burgers tasting like meatloaf. A little bit they do, but hey who doesn't like meatloaf! Thanks for the recipe.

While this recipe was very good, it was much closer to meat loaf than to hamburgers.

Delicious alternative to the typical fried burger.  I doubled the sauce ingredients, 'cause we like lots of sauce, and eliminated the sugar.  Served with rice, it's great!

I am pregnant (and have a toddler and husband to feed) and constantly looking for quick, easy, yummy recipes to please my whole family. This will definitely be added to our rotation!!! My toddler loves it!!! Even my picky husband liked it!!!

My family doesn't like additives to  burgers, so  I just fried quality meat and added the sauce. I also thought the sauce was a bit too ketchup-y, so I added at least twice the worchestershire sauce and about a tablespoon of brown sugar.  One more thing--in any recipe, don't skimp on the worchestershire sauce.  I always use something like Lea & Perrins.  It does make a difference.

This is also a long time tradition in my family.  The only difference is I brown the patties and then cover with the sauce and slices of onion then bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes.  This allows the sauce to infuse the meat.  Also you can use Apple cide vinegar for a little extra kick if you like.   I make larger quanities (3-5 lbs) at a time. You can freeze afterwards. These are even better the next day!

I made this exactly with the exception of completely doubling the recipes for my family.
It was very good.  Came together easy and no problem with doubling the recipe.  I also used extra lean ground beef and canola oil to make it little more healthy. Thanks for the keeper!

We make this all the time.  I have to just about double the sauce part of the recipe, but then, we like to serve it over the top of the rice, too.  This is so yummy and really easy to make.  Great comfort food!

Tasty and filling. A nice way to stretch a lb of ground beef to feed several people. A kid friendly meal. My husband described this accurately as meatloaf patties. I left out the chopped onion and used onion powder in the sauce.

Was disappointed; these were somewhat on the dry side and not very flavorful.  The sauce just tasted like ketchup doused on top.

Very close to what I do, except like to have less ketchup and more barbeque sauce plus add an egg. After living in USA for a few years learned that more tend to like bland beef and add taste where as us Canadians tend to like more taste in meat as well  So yes it a bit more like a meatloaf but still grills up nice

Where I grew up they had a place that served barbqued hamburgers with a slice of sauteed onion on top.  Delish.  I thought this was sweet.  Next time I'll cut the sugar to 1 or 2 tsp and sautee those onions for on top.

The only change I made was balsamic vinegar because I didn't have any other kind and per the review by Jim I transferred the patties to a baking dish and baked after pan browning.  I was surprised by how much we enjoyed them.  Great way to have an individual meatloaf.

Oh my goodness, these are so good! Yes, they taste like meatloaf. The only change I made was doubling the sauce and using 1/2 distilled vinegar and 1/2 apple cider vinegar. A definite keeper!

We love these, too!  They are rather like meatloaf, so we serve them over mashed potatoes and with steamed broccoli, and maybe some biscuits, and they're a slam dunk!  Yum!

This recipe was pretty good and easy and it turned out a different kind of hamburger, which is good, since I tend to make hamburgers alot.  I used ground turkey and didnt have any evap. milk, so substitued regular milk instead.  I was afraid it would be too soupy to make any patties, but the meat just absorbed it.  They took no time on the stove and the sauce tastes kind of like a bbq sauce.  I liked that since it wasnt your typical GLOB ON BBQ sauce taste from a bottle.  I was making regular hamburgers, so used the excess sauce (there is excess!) in my corn and carrots.  Kind of made a total BBQ style dinner.

Excellent!! What a great dish! the only changes I made was to double the sauce recipe, I used buttermilk, but cut it back to 1/2 cup. I am on a low carb diet, ( in maintaince) so I substituted low carb ketsup, and used splenda for the sugar... I served it over brown rice... yummy! This is a real keeper, and I recommend it to everyone.

I made this for my father, who is very picky about the meat dishes he eats for supper. He loooved this recipe, and wonder of wonders requested that I make it again. I didn't have enough ketchup, so I used one third of a cup of barbeque sauce instead, along with 1/3 cup ketchup.

This recipe was delicious!  I noticed that a previous reviewer said that they were mushy...I found that they were moist, but not mushy and I could see why they were intended for a pan, but not the grille.  The taste was very good, however, and we will definitely add them to our recipe box.

I wasn't impressed. The burgers turned out mushy!  I used fairly exact measurements as stated in instructions, but, by the end of the meal, my hubby was asking to switch back to my old cheeseburgers.

Sorry, my husband and I just didn't care for these burgers.  Tasted too much like bland meatloaf.  The sauce needs to be doubled so I just added bbq sauce from the jar.  Next time, I would just stick with plain hamburger with a little onion and seasoning added in and use bbq sauce from the jar.  Sorry!  (If you really want to try this recipe, I would suggest cutting back some on the evap. milk, they just seemed way too moist - but double up the bbq sauce.)

Quite tasty.  It had a meatloaf like flavor, but the sauce was the key...very tangy sweet/sour flavor.  I think I enjoyed it more than the family did!

My husband and I really enjoyed this meal.  It was quick and easy to make.  Someone else wrote that it was mushy, but mine wasn't.  I think you need to make sure the prepared meat sits long enough for the milk to be absorbed good.

Followed the recipe except used I shallot for onion, seasoned panko crumbs, added one egg, and used one less tsp. of sugar. The from scratch BBQ sauce makes it! ????????????

Part if this was my fault because I didn't read the description saying it was best served over rice. I was looking to make actual hamburgers. In my husband's words, "It's like a meatloaf, but not as good as your meatloaf." Definitely edible  though with a good toasted bun and a bunch of condiments. But it's not really like a typical burger. What we did to remedy the mushy texture was put cheese on top and bake in the oven for a little while.

Did not go over well with the family.  I doubled the recipe as suggested, so that we would have plenty of sauce, but it was very rich.  Maybe more sugar would be better.  I will not make this again.

I didn't care much for these but The Boy LOVED them. They're like individual meat loaves, prepared on top of the stove. I found them a bit bland ~ I think I'll follow another reviewer's suggestion and add green onion to the meat mixture, along with a few more spices to jazz it up a bit. The Boy loves 'em "as is". Thanks for the recipe Paula.

I used ground turkey instead of beef and added a little more oats to hold it. It wasnt my type of food. the burgers came out mushy in the inside. I would agree with others reviewers who said it taste more like meatloaf for sure! my husband liked it okay. Maybe if I use beef it would come out better?

I used ground turkey instead of beef because I had read many reviews comparing the burgers to meatloaf.  I also added sharp cheddar to my husband's.  The burgers were very juicy and delicious!  Easy to make and good on a toasted bun.

These tasted really good, but ended up giving both me and my husband stomach aches.  If you don't eat much meat, you definitely have to work your way up to these burgers!  The recipe took a bit of preparation but the texture of the burgers was worth it.

These were good and even my picky husband who hates onions ate them.  I was surprised that they were so tasty with such unusual ingredients.  Not sure if I'd go through the effort to make them again though.

Great texture and taste on these burgers, the sauce somewhat overshadows the flavour, tho' it's pretty good to.
