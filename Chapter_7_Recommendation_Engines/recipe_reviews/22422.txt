I have been making this for a couple of years now.  To keep the meat moist, place the browned meat on the bottom of the pan with the sliced potatoes on the top and pour the sauce over everything.
Way better this way.

I made this tonight following some of the suggestions:  omitted the salt, seasoned chops with garlic powder, seasoning salt, onion powder and pepper, added sliced onions to potatoes, added fresh garlic and heavy cream to sauce.  Baked taters 30 min, then added chops and baked covered 30 min, uncovered 15 min.  EXCELLENT!  This is going into my regular rotation.

I made this recipe according to direction but threw it all in the crock pot for 4 hours and it turned out AWESOME!  I reduced the salt to 1 tsp. & breaded the pork chops with...yes shake & bake (hubby likes it) they came out very tender and the potatoes were delicious!  Thank you Monica!

I have to give this 5 stars because my pickiest child had seconds!  He's never even eaten an entire pork chop before....probably my fault...I always seem to dry them out.  The chops were tender and flavorful, but I did tweak the recipe by following some suggestions from other reviewers.  I did not have chicken broth, so I used 2 cups of water and 2 chicken boullion cubes. (added a pinch extra flour)  I cut the salt down, but next time I will omit altogether.  Also, I doubled the gravy....put 1/2 on the potatoes and baked covered for 30 minutes, then added the browned chops (seasoned well) and poured the remainder of the gravy over them. Baked covered for 45 minutes, uncovered for 15.  Perfect!  This is a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe :)

This is a very basic recipe and is even better with onions and cheese in the potatoes. Yes, an hour and a half is a long time UNLESS you use a chop at least an inch and a half thick. Living in Iowa, we don't do thin chops. If your chops are thinner, start the potatoes first and add chops the last half hour or so depending on the thickness. You can par boil your potatoes to speed things up or cover and microwave for 10 to 15 minutes. I am not one to add much salt while cooking so we salt ours at the table since there is alot of salt in the broth unless you use low sodium. Happy cooking!

I wanted to try something new instead of the same old pork chop recipe so I tried this and my husband loved it!!!  No leftovers for once.  I added more potatoes and cooked them for 30 minutes before adding the chops because we like them soft.  The gravy was great. I used salt reduced chicken broth and didn't add any salt to the gravy and it was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing.

I loved this recipe.  Good comfort food :)  I substituted condensed cream soup (chicken dijon)plus 1/2 cup of water for the chicken broth for additional flavor and creaminess.

Contrary to a few previous posts, I thought this recipe was wonderful.  I basted the chops before returning them to the oven for the last 1/2 hour, and, they were exceptionally moist.  I used my food processor to slice my potatoes evenly, they were very tasty, not bland at all!  The only thing I would change next time is to reduce the amount of salt.  Next time, I also might try adding things like parsley, etc., as was suggested by someone else!  Thank you!

We loved this!  If you don't care to use canned soups, this is a simple, easy recipe.  I cooked it in the crockpot for about 4 1/2 hours.  Put the potatoes on the bottom and the browned chops on the top.  Try it, you'll like it!

Very good.  I followed other reviewers advice and partially cooked the potatoes in microwave and decreased cooking time by half.  I also basted the chops with the broth from bottom of baking dish when I removed the foil for the last minutes of cooking.

These were very good and ended up being the most tender, fall apart pork chops I have ever had! I did make some changes-I made this dish in the crock pot. I put the pork chops on the bottom and potatoes over top and it kept the pork chops so moist. I also browned the pork chops as directed but seasoned them with garlic powder, seasoned salt, pepper, and onion poweder. It turned out delicous this way!

Made this tonight, it was great! I cut back on the salt by half and spiced up the broth with garlic powder and dried onion bits. I also added a cup of baby carrots to the potatos and seasoned up the chops while browning. I took the advice of others and cooked the spuds 30 minutes before adding the chops. It turned out awesome and will make again.

Really good, hardy dish. I actually got this recipe for my boyfriend to try out. His specialties now include: toast, and Pork Chops and Scalloped Potatoes! This recipe is a keeper.

Great! I added cheese to the scalloped potato mixture as another reviewer suggested and seasoned the pork chops normally to our liking. I added the pork chops to the potatoes for the last 40 minutes after searing. Definately a keeper!

Delicious.  My changes: added 3/4 cup chopped onion, sauteed and 1/2 sharp cheddar cheese.  Next time would not add any extra salt.  I sliced the potatoes very thin and microwaved for 5 minutes before assembling the dish.  The potatoes would be great w/o meat, but chicken tenders would be equally as good.

I made this last night and everything turned out wonderful.   I altered it a bit, by adding some chopped onion to the potatoes.  Also, instead of salt, I used about 1/2 tsp. garlic salt.  I also seasoned the pork chops with Lowry's, garlic powder and pepper as I was browning them.  I baked the potatoes about 35 minutes before adding the pork, then baked an additional 40 minutes covered, and 15 minutes uncovered.  The pork was tender and the potatoes were done perfect!  This was a very good meal, I knew my husband liked it, when he went back for seconds!

It was fine. Bland at best. I'm hoping it was because I like a creamy scallop potato and this wasn't.

This recipe is really great! I decided to give it a try one night when all I had was pork chops and potatoes. I didn't think I was going to like it, (not a scalloped potatoe fan) Let me tell everyone, It is terrific! Everyone including myself had seconds..I will make this over again. Thanks!!

I made this tonight and the only modifications I made were the following:  Added heavy cream to the soup/gravy mixture. Baked potatoes, in soup/gravy, alone 30 minutes. Seasoned chops with pork rub before browning in pan. Greatly increased the black pepper.  The soup/gravy was excellent, and after baking with potatoes (covered of course) even better.  Then adding the browned, seasoned chops just added more flavor.  Great recipe, a keeper for sure.

I've made pork chops, potatoes and onions with chicken broth in the skillet before, so really thought this would turn out just as good but it was horrid.  I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the sauce and put the pork chops underneath everything to ensure they would stay moist.  This meal was flavorless and dry.  My kids would not eat this and my husband called the chops "sawdust".  I'll never make chops in the oven again....

i really did not care for this recipe at all.  It was extremely bland.  The pork chops were a little dry as well.  The potatoes needed more seasoning.  They tasted too much like chicken soup.

Yummy recipe!  I used garlic salt with parsley instead of regular salt and added onions to the potatos.  I'll definitely be making this one again.

Thank you for a great family dinner idea.  I added some additional seasonings - garlic and thyme, along with some chopped onions.  I would call this a real "comfort food" dinner.

Over all there was nothing spectacular about this dish, but it was a nice easy dinner to make.  My pork chops were actually over cooked in the time it took to cook the potatoes however and I ended up with soupy potatoes which I didn't care for.  Next time I will simply make them seperately.

Pretty Good!I decided to try these in the slow cooker(on low for about 6 hrs) and they turned out well.I layered the potatoes with some onion powder, pepper and a little bit of cheese and they tasted so creamy.The pork chops came out tender and juicy too.Great dinner and really easy to prepare.Thanks Monica!

I have made this 10 times or more and my family loves it. Sometimes I make an extra half a batch of gravy to make it extra moist but it is great as it is. My father recently came for super and I made this. He really enjoyed it. He commented how tender the pork chops were and ate every bite on his plate. This coming from some one who is just a tad picky. Quite an endorsement for sure!

I was looking for something different to make for dinner and came across this recipe today. AWESOME!! I did change a couple things. I put the pork chops under the potatoes before baking. Also, I added some minced garlic to the butter and sauteed it before adding the dry ingredients and broth. I also added some onions to the potatoes before pouring the liquid over it. It turned out perfect! I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a good pork chop and potato recipe! Kudos!!

Good basic dinner. The roux/sauce tasted great before I poured it over the potatoes and it smelled WONderful while cooking but somehow it ended up tasting a little bland.  Some garlic and minced onion next time.

Great recipe. I also decided to bake the potatoes for 30 min before adding the pork chops. then I buried the pork chops in the potatoes making them nice and moist. 

I'll be making these again for sure.

We absolutely LOVED this recipe.  There were no leftovers & even the little ones agreed that it was wonderful.  I did follow the advice of some of the others.  I wanted it done quicker than the recipe called for so I precooked the potatoes by boiling them for about 10 mintutes before placing them in the baking dish.  I also used less salt, as suggested & added a little more pepper (my own touch).  My favorite, which everyone tends to overlook is the power of paprika!  I love paprika on poultry.  It gives it great flavor so I used it generously.  I only had to cook for about 30 min covered & 15 uncovered and it was scrumptuous!  Thanks for the quick & easy recipe!

This was different from what I remember what Mom's recipe was for scalloped potatoes and pork chops... but we enjoyed it very much. This is what I did: I like to use 'seasoned pepper' instead of black pepper; I added slices of onion to when browning the pork chops; and I wish I could get my potatoes sliced just a tad thinner. YUM! Thanks for sharing!

This is a good one, BUT I would recommend NOT so much salt(only half of whats required),also ONLY put garlic powder and pepper on your chops!

We didn't take the advice of other reviewers by cooking the potatoes for half an hour before adding the pork chops, the chops were cooked perfectly, but the potatoes were a little underdone.  I added some shredded cheese and sliced onion, so the potatoes were very tasty (once they were cooked of course).  We will definitely try this again, but make sure we par-cook the potatoes before adding the pork.

After reading the other reviews,I pre-baked the potatoes in the sauce for 30 minutes..I also added garlic salt to flavor the potatoes with a zing! I baked the pork chops for only 45 minutes covered,15 minutes uncovered and they turned out a little dry,but nonetheless,very tasty.Hubby loved it,requested for me to make it more!Will cut down on baking time! I also added cheese the last 10 minutes of baking..Easy,tasty and sure to please!

This recipe was simple and delicious! My only warning is that if you use very thinly cut pork chops, let the potatoes bake for a while before you add the chops. Mine turned out a little dry, although I still enjoyed the meal quite a bit. This one is a keeper!

My center-cut pork chops turned out bone-dry, even after basting during cooking. I also cut the potatoes too thick--1/8th inch--and they were undercooked. But the flavors were great--I added garlic powder and cream of chicken soup to extend the gravy, a sliced onion between the potatoes and chops, and shredded cheddar the last 10 minutes. Great flavors! I'll try this recipe again and use thin-cut chops, wafer-thin potatoes, prebake the potatoes/sauce for 30 minutes before adding the pan-fried chops. Thanks everybody for all your remarks and suggestions.

Really juicy. I added onion and chopped celery to the potatoes and about a cup of leftover shredded cheese to the sauce just before pouring over the pork chops. Everything cooked perfectly in the slow cooker on low for 3-4 hours.

Delicious, I used red potatoes and they were awesome, the pork was a little dry so I would suggest cutting the cooking time a bit. My chops were rather thick and still seemed dry but very tasty.

The meat and potatoes cooked well together but I just didn't find it very tasty, too bland for me and the gravy/sauce too thin. The Old Man liked it fine. A good base though for sure.....next time I'll customize it.

I didn't change a thing and it was great.  This is something that I would fix for company.  We really enjoyed this.  My husband said that this was a do over.  Maybe next time I might add some shredded cheddar cheese.  Just a thought.

I was looking for a new way to use pork chops and this looked fairly easy.  I used center cut pork chops that were about 2" thick.  I used a pork rub on them to flavor them, then browned them.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly (aside from cooking time).  I used a meat thermometer to gauge when my chops were done so that they weren't overcooked.  I would definitely recommend using the thicker chops like I did as it ensured that the potatoes were done w/o overcooking the chops.  I had enough "gravy" and didn't find it to be too salty.  Next time, I'll add some seasoning to the sauce to give it a bit more "oomph" but overall, it was good comfort food and a nice way to do potatoes.  Unfortunately, only two of my kids liked them that way - they prefer mashed, but too bad!  I'll definitely add this into my dinner rotation.  I'm giving it four stars b/c it was good and I'd make it again, but I wouldn't say it "wowed" us.

Easy and tasty.  I would advise using thick pork chops, as they seemed to get a little dry, or maybe add the pork chops later in the cooking process.

This is a great recipe. The modifications I made were based on what other reviews said. I added a small container of heavy cream to the sauce and doubled the sauce ingredients themselves. I coated the porkchops in flour with some season salt, parsley and paprika before browning them. I did not cook the potatoes ahead of time. I put some sauce on the bottom of my pan, then a layer of potatoes, a tad more sauce, the porkchops, sauce, potatoes again and finally the rest of the sauce. So I basically sandwiched the porkchops between the potatoes with the sauce in between each. It turned out fantastic. I just need to learn to make less of a mess in the kitchen! Thanks for another incredible recipe! We all loved it. My husband said, "Dinner tonight...that one's a keeper!" Thank you! Thank you!

We thought this was a great recipe.  Used thicker pork chops, about 2 inches.  Cooked as directed, didn't dry out at all.  We also only used 3 chops, so we didn't need to double the gravy. Added onion and garlic in with the potatoes.  I enjoy the taste of potatoes, and simple gravy so I didn't feel the need to spice things up as other views seemed to need

Based off of my own modification this had some flavor (marinate in soy and worsh with montreal steak seasoniong 3hrs) Instead of doubling the gravy aka liquid, I only used 3 2" pork chops (all I had)I also used garlic salt with the liquid.  The pork was moist, the potatoes were perfect, but this is like a soup. I did not have to nuke or prebake my potatoes. 

Maybe work with the sauce, or quarter the taters.....  As I said a great base

Mine didn't turn out as good as I thought it would.  I did make twice as much sauce but followed the recipe otherwise. The pork chops were really dry.  If I make again, I wouldn't cook for about an hour rather than the hour and a half.

Monica...you took me back home again to my mother's cooking.  I haven't had "Hot Pot" (it's what we call it) since her death 26 years ago and have been looking for this recipe FOREVER.  I savored every bite.  Thank you for bringing a smile to my face and helping me remember my mother through this recipe.

very good!  I didn't have any potatoes so I opened a box of dehydrated potatoes from a scalloped potatoes box and ditched the seasoning packet.  I also doubled the sauce recipe (only ended up using 3/4 of it. Cut the salt AT LEAST in half.  I mixed dehydrated onions in with the potatoes and sprinkled some on the pork chops and seasoned them with Natures Seasoning, garlic salt, pepper and onion powder.  Very easy to prepare and delicious-not 5 star delicious, but still yummy enough to make again.  Thanks!

Great recipe! Followed other reviews suggestions by omitting salt, adding chopped onions and garlic to the potatoes. I added italian seasoning, paprika, basil, and onion powder to the chops while browning, however they could still use a little more flavor. The meat and potatoes came out really tender, cooked the potatoes 30 min before the meat, cooked another 30  min covered, then 15 min uncovered.

This was a very easy recipe! It came out perfect! I seasoned my chops very well while browning to give great flavor. I added a little garlic to the gravy also. My potatoes were absolutely perfect. I also used 1/2 the gravy/sauce on top of the potatoes and put the remaining gravy on top of the meat. Add parsley to the top of the dish before baking!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for dinner with a few of the suggestions in the review section. Terrific! Cooking the potatoes for 35 minutes first allows you time to brown the chops. Add them and cook covered 45 more minutes, then uncovered 15 more. Perfect!

I followed the recipe except I changed the cooking time. I cooked the potatoes while I browned the chops, about 20 min, then added the chops another 45 min covered. Cooked uncovered about 15 min. The potatoes were terrific, very tender. Even though it took a while to slice all the potatoes, it was was worth the effort.

I USED A SLOW COOKER AND ADDED CHEESE AND GARLIC PEPPER TO THE POTATOES. IT WAS SOOO TENDER AND JUICY! IT WAS THE PERFECT CHOICE, SINCE WE HAD A HURRICANE SCARE AND WE WERE NOT SURE HOW LONG THE POWER WOULD LAST. IT TOOK ABOUT 5 HOURS AND EVERYONE WAS HAPPY (ESPECIALLY SINCE THE HURRICAN LANDED SOUTH!)

I made this recipe with six pork chops and only cooked them for an hour and they turned out perfect!  Very juicy and tasty.  The potatoes were delicious!  There were some left over while I was doing the dishes, so I stood there and ate them all!  What flavor!  Will definitely make them again and again!

This tasted like a shoe-string budget meal to me.  The potatoes were bland and didn't taste like the scaloped potatoes that I anticipated.  I just can't sacrafice the cheese.  The meat and potatoes were very tender and the liquid consistency was good.

FANTASTIC! I absolutely LOVED this recipe and my husband asked me to put it on my regular menu! I am a sauce loving person so I doubled the sauce (which is fabulous) and poured the second batch over the pork chops.  When there was only a few minutes left to cook, I removed the pork chops, sprinkled some shredded longhorn cheddar cheese on top, replaced the pork chops and baked until the cheese was bubbyly! I will definately make this again, it is a keeper! Not only delicious, but simple.  My three year old loved it, too! Thank you for a great recipe, Monica!

I really like this recipe.  I did tweak it some- I added some (1/2c) milk along w/ the chicken broth, just to make sauce a little creamier.  Also, I seasoned my pork chops w/ salt, garlic powder and pepper, before browning them.  It was really good!

I followed some of the advice of other reviews. I browned bone-in chops in some leftover bacon grease. I added a small clove of chopped garlic and about a quarter of a cup of milk to the chicken broth mixture, as well as, the drippings from the pan that I browned the chops in. I also sliced two small onions and shredded about a cup of sharp cheddar cheese to layer with the potatoes. I layered everything on top of the pork chops since pork tends to dry out easily. It turned out AMAZING.

I made this according to the recipe.  The potatoes were decent.. and the chops were ok, but it wasn't something I would make for company!  It could be dressed up by altering the recipe quite a bit, but then it wouldn't be THIS RECIPE now, would it?

I follow the recipe pretty close though if you like the sauce more creamy make a white sauce with milk instead of broth.  Also, I love mushrooms so I mix them in with the potatoes and add onions as well. If I am feeling particularly time crunched or just plain lazy I throw in some green beans too.  Makes for an easy, weeknight, one dish meal!

Excellent, my family loved it.  The only thing I would change:  pork chops were just a little dry....not much!!!, but could of used some kind of basting of oil/butter/gravy on top of them for the last 30 minutes of cooking/browning and tender potatoes.  OH YEAH!!!

Yummy!  My husband, who is a very picky eater, loved this.  So did I.  Very easy as well.  I will probably cook this very often.

This recipe yields a great tasting meal. I liked it so much the first time that I made it again 2 days later. I added a few sliced onions to the potatoes and that worked. Then I added a handful of peas to the dish for the last 10 minutes of cooking just to add some colour.
Its really excellent !!

This is very yummy!  our son has a dairy allergy so getting scalloped potatoes from the store is not something we can do.  These are Easy and is safe for him!  I have even made the pork chops on the grill and made the scalloped potatoes alone in a dish... yum!

Really good and really satisfying.  Only thing I did differently was to bread the chops before searing them (with a variety of spices and Panko crumbs) and I also threw some chive sour cream into the sauce for the spuds.  Thanks much!

This recipe needs to be changed a bit to come out right. I followed the directions to a tee and it was definitely way too salty! Also, the pork chops were very dry. An hour and a half baking time is too much.

Pork was overdone and tough. I doubled the gravy as another reviewer suggested and hoped that would cover up the pork so that it wouldn't dry up. I also baked the potatoes first and then added the pork later, but it was still dried-up and tough.  The flavor was great, so I plan to make again and experiment techniques on how to have tender pork chops.

This dish was amazing.  One bite and my husband wanted to know when am I going to make it again.  I seasoned my pork chops with adobo and garlic salt prior to browning them.  I also doubled the sauce and I microwaved the potatoe slices to soften them up before baking.  I poured half of the sauce over the potatoes and the other half over the pork chops once in the pan.

Tremendous! I nuked the sliced potatoes for 5 minutes, omitted the salt and added a touch of seasoned salt to the gravy. Only had to bake it for 1 hour, and the chops were pretty thick. What a great recipe!

I made just the potatoes and changed the recipe a little to eliminate the butter fat.  I finely chopped one onion and sauted it in a tiny bit of oil.  Then I added the flour to make a roux followed by 1 cup of chicken broth, 1 cup of skim milk, salt and pepper.  I simmered and whisked the mixture with a whisk until it boiled and all the lumps dissolved. I cooked the potatoes for about 10 minutes in the microwave while I was making the sauce and then baked it all for about 30 minutes.  It turned out delicous!

I am going to give this 4 stars although I am truly undecided. I have a problem with the flavor. I added to the chops Mrs. Dash, garlic & onion powder, season salt, pepper and salt and still felt it was lacking. My husband came to the same conclusion. It's missing something. I just can't figure it out. Cheese soup maybe? I don't know. The potatoes are yummy but the chops need something more. Maybe a slow cooker?? We both like it enough to make it again but I'll need to work on additional flavor.

I have made this recipe many times and love it. I make it with pork steaks instead of chops. I also cut way back on the salt and add chicken boullion granuals to the gravy. I also season the steaks with garlic and onion powder and pepper. I also make extra gravy, usually double and don't use all of it and I pour some on top of the steaks as well. I do not uncover as this only dries them out.

The simplest recipes really are the best sometimes, and this one is no exception. I made it exactly as listed and thought it was excellent, especially the potatoes, they were tender and had a great flavor. Definitely a keeper!

We thought this was pretty good.  the potatoes were the best part of the dish.  I doubled the sauce mixture as we like things more moist than dry and was glad I did.  The chops came out a bit dry but I did add more seasoning to them as I fried them and put some sesame seeds on top as well and they had good flavor just needed to be more moist.  Next time I will need to tweek to get the chops juicier!  Thanks though, good and different dish.

This recipe was pretty good.  I used cornstarch instead of flour because of my own preference.  I added some garlic and onion powder to mine.  I also cooked the potatoes seperately first before I put the chops on top (after putting on chops I cooked covered for 40mins. and uncovered for 10mins.)  Came out pretty good, my youngest and my husband really liked it, me oldest daughter didn't really care for it (she's really picky) and I thought it was just okay.  Will probably make again.

I added some chopped cabbage, sliced onion, and minced garlic for texture and taste.  Recommend covering the chops with sauce instead of putting them on top so they don't dry out.  Very tasty recipe.

I am not proud to be the odd ball here, but this just did not taste like scalloped potatoes to us.  It just needs some more seasonings such as garlic, maybe add onions, 1/2 broth and 1/2 milk, and add cheese.  I don't think I will make again because I think it just needs too much tweaking for our taste.

I made this in the slow cooker (4 hours)and it was delicious.  The kids who just hate chewing meat loved the chops since they came out very tender.  Added  a little garlic salt and pepper to each layer of potatoes, keeping in mind the broth is salty.  This is a keeper for our family!

This is a great recipe and really easy. As suggested by other reviews...I also seasoned the broth and I breaded and browned my pork chops while the potatoes cooked for the 1st half hour. I also added a layer of 1 sliced onion between the potatoes. I sliced onions a taters with a mandoline, real quick and easy. I served it with the "Italian Greenbean" recipe from this site. I adding both to my recipe index.

I took others' suggestions and added onion and garlic powder and parsley to the potatoes and reduced the salt. I doubled the gravy and didn't use all of it. The flavor of this dish is excellent ,but cooking time is too long, making the pork chops dry. Next time I will cook the potatoes alone for half an hour before adding the browned pork. Definitely a keeper with the adjustments.

I am not a master chef. I rarely cook and was needing an easy meal to make for my husband and 1 year old daughter. It takes very few ingredients and was easy to prepare. The potatoes were a bit salty and the chops a bit dry. The flavor was excellent. Even my picky toddler liked it. Next time we'll serve it with green beans for more pizazz.

I TRIED THIS RECIPE.  I ADDED SOME ONION FOR FLAVOR.  MY PORKCHOPS WERE DRY.  THE POTATOES AND GRAVY WERE VERY GOOD.  I WOULD TRY THIS RECIPE AGAIN BUT NOT COOK AS LONG.  I LIKED ANOTHER VIEWERS IDEA OF MAKING A SECOND BATCH OF GRAVY TO ADD OVER THE TOP

Terrific recipe!  My husband and I loved it and will definitely make again.  The potatoes were a bit salty, so next time I think I'll cut the amount of salt added in half.  Otherwise, a perfect dinner!

I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the broth mixture, and the sauce was so creamy, better than gravy!

My family loved it!  I added carrots, onions, and garlic into the mix before baking.. Every little bit was eaten. :)  Make more than you think you'll need.

This recipe was suprisingly good. I used alittle more flour and bullion instead of canned broth...but it turned out excellent. I will be sure and make this again and again!

This was pretty good. Followed the directions. Next time, I will let potatoes cook a bit then put chops on top. The pork chops were a little dry.

For two...2 boneless pork chops, 4 small russet potatoes, thinly sliced onion, small amount of white cheddar and sauce the same as recipe calls for which was perfect!  Read comments and put sliced potatoes on bottom.  Covered with foil and baked 1 hour at 375 on convection bake. Uncovered and baked an additional 10 mins.  My husband gave it a 4,bit I give it a 5 for fast, easy and delicious!

Easy to make with a mandolin.  Used cream of chicken with a half can of milk and half can of beef broth.  We like our potatoes creamy and we had lots of sauce to spoon over broccoli.  Cooked potatoes 45 minutes, browned pork chops with seasonings, and then added on top of potatoes covered for 30 minutes then uncovered 15.  It was juicy and flavourful.

I was out of chicken broth so used water and a packet of of pork gravy powder. It was amazing. Put chops on top for first hour....when it was time to uncover, I buried them in the potatoes. I also added a sliced onion. It was delicious! Thanks for the great recipe

omg! What a delicious recipe. Hubby and I loved it. After I fried the pork chops, I sliced the potatoes right in the same skillet so that the ingredients absorbed more flavor. Also, I added some onion flakes to gravy and one chicken bouillon after it came to a boil. Pork chops were tender and tasty. Will make this again.

So good.  I used bone in chops and only just barely seared in cast iron fryer before adding to casserole.  Baked at 400 degrees for 45 minutes because I was behind in making dinner and then cover off for 15 minutes. So good!

Excellent dish!  After reading the reviews I did make a few minor changes.  I put less salt in the sauce, and I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper and some onion power before I browned them.  After I browned them I deglazed the pan with a little chicken broth and added it to the sauce to give it more flavor.  I used half sharp paprika on the chops instead of regular paprika.  Everything came out great, and certainly not bland.  An hour was plenty of time to bake everything.  A keeper!

Good recipe.  Added 1/4 cup cream, garlic and fennel to sauce.  Cooked potatoes 20 minutes before adding pork chops.  Covered and baked 30 minutes more.   Chops were tender, potatoes flavorful.  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband loved this recipe.  The only slight change I made was baking it covered at 300 degrees for 2 hours and then uncovered for 30 minutes.  The pork was very tender and tasty.  It was a great fall meal paired with broccoli.

Made this last night for dinner because my family loves scalloped potatoes and pork chops. I followed other reviewers advice and seasoned the chops prior to pan searing them. I added some shredded cheddar to the base before baking and even then it was still bland to our family's liking. It would have been nice to add some green onion or paprika to the top as I had served it but opted not to since what I thought was season the chops well before baking. I also added my chops to the bottom of the greased pan then added the potatoes. The chops were moist but I probably won't make this again. It was a great idea and easy clean up as well as easy to prepare and my 9 year old was able to help a lot which I always love. For that I gave it four stars. Flavor alone would have been 3 stars.

Loved it!  I would have given five stars but the pork was a little dry, however I believe that was my fault.  I thought I had enough chicken broth but I didn't, I had to substitute with white wine.  I will absolutely make it again, but next time I'll keep aluminum foil on it for the whole time, that should keep the pork juicy.

I took the advice of MICHK35 and put the chops on the bottom and potatoes on the top also adding salt to the potatoes as none was called for in the recipe. Everyone loved it. This was also done in 1 hr (gas oven) covered.

OH YUMMY!  This was a wonderful recipe.  My husband and I enjoyed it a lot!  The only change I made was  to cut out some of the salt.  I only made two pork chops and we both had wished there was more.  Served it with peas and onions. Husband has already asked for me to make this again.  Thank you for posting it.  I will be passing it along to my friends and making it again real soon.  This is my new favorite pork chop recipe.

I made this tonight for dinner and followed the recipe as it was written. I just added a teaspoon of beef bullion to the sauce before I poured it over the chops and potatoes. That took care of the bland taste. Like others, I added garlic powder, onion salt, and pepper too. Turned out great! I will definitely make this again.

I made it.  It was ok.  I would definitely tweek it for more flavor.   Maybe omit the paprika and replace it with some sage.  worth trying to make again to better it.

I really like this except for a nagging feeling that i'm doing the pork a wrong. I'm not sure whether its cause I'm putting chicken broth with my pork or that I'm missing a vital addition to the dish; as if it could be better.

Wonderful! I only had it in there covered for 1 hour at 375 and it was just fine. I would omit some of the salt and pepper if you prefer a more mild taste--recipe makes it strong.

This was good. We loved the potatoes. I added sliced onions and sprinkled garlic powder on top of everything. I also took the suggestion of other reviews and placed the chops on the bottom of the dish. Next time I will add them later as they were a bit dry for my liking. Will definitely make again!

Made this tonight and it was pretty good :). The potatoes were really good. My pork chops ended up being a little bit dry, but I only used 4 instead of 6 but still kept it in for almost the full time. But I will most likely make this again :)

Surprisingly good for how basic the recipe is; just too salty for us.  I made it as posted, but next time I will: cut down on the salt, put the chops on the bottom under the potatoes, and add rosemary. Since I used a slicer, my potatoes were really too thin for the baking time, so I will cut that down, as well.

Good recipe but I added diced onions and used smoked chops instead of regular. Added chops 15-20 min. before serving. They heat pretty quick  but you get some of their smoky flavor in the potatoes.

Easy, inexpensive weeknight supper. Pork chops were quite dry, But overall, flavour was good. Everybody ate it without complaining, but no one was too excited about it either. Will probably make again. Would give 3 1/2 stars if I could.

so easy and sooo good.  I used 2 packages of Betty Crocker scalloped  potatoes and this made it super quick and I don't think any less good.  I also added finely chopped onions and chopped celery and carrots poured the soup  I used 1 can of soup and the mix that comes with the potatoes ( I cut out the water and used the milk and butter.. cooked at 350 for about an hour. chopped parsley on the top for color..served it with fresh green beans cooked with a bit on bacon and onion..... it's a favorite easy recipe!

Very good! The only thing was it was a little salty and I only used 1 tsp. of salt next time I will cut it back to 1/2 tsp. Will make again, great comfort food.

this was great.  i think i had extra potatoes so i doubled the sauce and burried the meat int the saucy potatoes.  I used turkey cutlets instead of pork chops and they were soooo tender when they were done.  I tried using half sweet potato half regular potatoes. the sweet potatoes turned out mushy though.  they still had a great flavor though.

My Husband Loves this Dish and to my surprise he asked for me to do it again just the other day, i Did a few Changes altho i followed most of the recipe at its most.
I added dried Rosemary, Freeze dried Garlic, freeze dried red onions, a bit of garlic powder,  abit more paprika.
Instead of leaving the pork chops whole since i had boneless center cut i made scallop size cuts on each of them and did the usual browning but adding some of this ingredients above, after that i threw the chops on the slow cooker on low for 30 minutes while on the skillet i browned the scalloped taters on the grease left over by the chops, when the 30 minutes of the chops in the slow cooker where over i add the taters and set them on top of the  scalloped chops in the slow cooker, made the gravy or sauce at last with the remaining caramel of the bottom of the skillet left over by the chops and taters and after been in the skillet for about 15 minutes when it came to a boil i smeared it all over the taters and chops in the slow cooker, letting it sit on low for 4 hrs. this came out so good, i accompanied this dish with minute rice and steamed broccoli. Great make a keeper in my family for generations to come!!!

The family loved this (even a couple of picky girls).  I made a few modifications.  All I had was boneless center cut pork chops, so I reduced the cooking time by 1/2 hour.  I sliced the potatoes, and poured the sauce on (w/a little heavy cream added to the sauce for creaminess), and cooked the potatoes for 1/2 hour.  Also I reserved some of the sauce.  During that time I browned the chops.  I placed them on the last 1/2 hour, and poured remaining sauce on top.  Kids usually hate any potato that is not a "fry" but they ate these all up.  Needs a little more seasoning....but overall a great meal

A nice hearty meal, served with a veggie side & it's complete! A great way to cook pork chops without having to worry if they're "done" - the sauce & potatoes keep them moist. Definitely a keeper in my book!

Great recipe.  My only complaint is that the chops were a little dry.  Maybe next time I'll wait to put them into the oven until halfway into the cooking time.

I really disliked this recipe.  The pork chops were dry and I found the gravy to lack flavor (despite my attempts to spice it up beforehand). Its consistency was much too soupy for it to be considered scalloped potatoes.  I wouldn't make this again.

I love this recipe.  I was looking for something different to do with pork chops and I found it in this recipe.  My husband cannot have anything with milk or cheese and doing the scalloped potatoes this way is awesome.  I have done just the potatoes and gravy seperately as a side dish with other meats.  I even used beef broth because I did not have chicken and it still tasted great.

This was a big disappointment. I browned my chops with garlic powder and pepper. I also added slivers of cheddar cheese in between layers of potato. Without this, I can't imagine how bland it would have been. I was happy with how moist the chops were, but that was about it. Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

I had no problem with "tough" meat as some reviewers did. I used center cut boneless chops and only browned the outside lightly. There's no need to cook in the skillet a long time because there is long oven cooking  time and the paprika will supply color. We really enjoyed this recipe; I especially liked the simple ingredients and low cost. I would use less salt though , as the canned chicken broth has a good amount of salt. salt. I served this on an unseasonably cool summer evening with corn on the cob from a local farm. Will make again in fall and winter.

I tweaked this recipe quite a bit due to lacking ingredients and it came out great! First I made a batter with milk,soy sauce,butter,garlic,salt & pepper. I dipped the chops in it then battered them in shake & bake.  I baked them in the oven for 1 hour.  Instead of plain potatoes I used a box of scalloped potatoes and made them in the oven at the same time as I baked the chops.  While those baked I made a gravy with the remaining batter combined with 1 can of cream of chicken,(didnt have broth)& 2 tbs of flour whisked over med. high heat. I then put the scalloped potatoes in a baking pan added the chops and covered them in the gravy I made w some garlic powder sprinkled on top. I then baked it for a final 1/2 hour(20 min. covered &10 min. uncovered.)This was nice and moist and my husband who is the biggest food critic and usually does the cooking loved it! It was very flavorful.

This taste good! it's almost the same with Grandma's Pork Chops in Mushroom Gravy on allrecipes, only instead of mushrooms it uses potatoes. I always have a problem with cooking potatoes in the oven. They are always still hard. End up boiling it on the pan after everything's done..:(

This is a very good recipe.  The pork chops turned out perfectly but the potatoes need a little something.

This recipe was easy and tasted fantastic.  I added shredded cheddar cheese on top for the last 30 minutes of baking time.  The pork chops were moist and tender.  My fiancee loved it too and he's a picky eater.

The flavor was fine.  I used Lawry's seasoned salt.  But the pork chops were very dry (like jerky).  I used one inch boneless which may have been a big mistake.  Use bone-in pork chops for this!  Otherwise, no problems.

Wonderful recipe.  The only change I made was also add 1 can cream of chicken and 1/4Cup water to make more gravy.  Also if you have a Cusinart chopper use the 2mm blade and your potatoes are chopped in seconds (I left the skin on yellow new potatoes.

Excellent recipe.  chops were very tender.  I took suggestions of other reviews and cut the salt in 1/2.  definitely wouldn't add the whole amount.  very good recipe!

My family thought this was a great dish.  Made a roux from the butter/flour as someone had suggested.  Used olive oil instead of butter to brown the chops.  After chops browned I sauteed an onion in the olive oil, then added onion and oil to the gravy.  Also since in a hurry I followed another suggestion and microwaved the taters a little first.  Cooked in oven for 30 minutes.  This was a hit with the family, just wish I had made more gravy, it was VERY tasty.

I've made this a few times now. The first time I thought it was missing something. It was bland and a little too salty. The next time I threw in some thyme, garlic powder, and minced onion, and I cut down on the salt. Delish!

I found this to be a little bland.  Liked the potatoes, the chops were dull.  Will probably make again omitting the chops.

I thought this recipe was just ok. I took other members' advice and baked the potatoes for 30 minutes before adding the chops. I decided to cover the potatoes in ALL the gravy, then baked it covered in foil. Pulled it out, added the browned chops, and decided to add some cream of chicken soup + water so the chops wouldn't dry out. I then baked for 40 minutes with foil, 20 without. Potatoes turned out perfect, chops were perfect, I just thought it was lacking flavor. Don't add the salt at the beginning - the broth adds plenty. I would only make this again if I didn't have ingredients to make something else.

Was looking for a different pork chop recipe the whole family would eat and ended up quite pleased. I followed some of the tips from previous reviewers. I didn't add the salt and cooked the potatoes 30 minutes on their own.  Turned out really good.  Will definitely make again.

A very good and easy way to make pork chops. My family loved this. I did cook the potatoes for a 1/2 hour before adding pork chops and saved a little sauce for pouring over. I will  make this one again!

The chops needed more seasoning.  Adjust cooking time to thickness of chops.  The potatoes were excellent!!!
I followed the advice of past reviewers and cut back on the salt, cooked the potatoes for 30 min before adding the chops.  Will make again, just tweak it a bit.

I've learned my lesson!!!  Always make notes about the reviews before cooking.  I prepared this exactly as instructed and found it way too salty.  Then I read the reviews.  With an adjustment for salt, this will be a do-again.

This is good for a basic recipe. I added thin sliced onions and halfed the chicken broth with cream since we like the creamy taste. Also I added some spices to my chops, like garlic, onion powder and pepper. Our chops were moist as I poured the sauce over them and not just the potatoes and made sure they were kept moist. This is a great recipe if you tweek it a little to your own prefference.

this was a great dinner.  i did double on the gravy sauce, i par boiled the potatoes, and i used thin cut chops, so my cooking time ended up being much less,  i added little more paprika, and next time i will add even more.  it was very easy to make, and it's a keeper.

The scalloped potatoes were really good, but the pork chops weren't that great.  I think I'll just keep the scalloped potato part of the recipe and nix the chops.

Wish I had read all of the reviews before making this!  This was way too salty.  I'll definitely halve the salt next time.  I parboiled the potatoes before baking.  I didn't eat much of it because of the salt (even double-checked my measuring spoon to make sure I had added the correct amount).  My kids did enjoy the pork chops.  All in all, I think it is a good basic dish.  Use this recipe as a starting point and dress it up with the seasonings that you prefer.

Excellent dish!  Much to my dismay, I was completely out of butter, so I left it out of the broth and used olive oil to brown the pork chops.  I also added more pepper and sprinkled a bit more than a dash of paprika on the potatoes.  The potatoes came out *wonderfully* delicious!  Will definitely use this recipe again!

I thought this was only average.  I took other reviewers advice and added garlic powder to the chicken broth and seasoned my pork chops before browning.  I also cooked my potatoes for 35 minutes alone then added the chops and cooked an additional 40 minutes.  My potatoes were somewhat mushy and my chops were a little on the dry side.  I made this without a trial run (which was a mistake) for my in-laws who were here for the holiday and ended up feeling a little embarrased that it didn't taste better.  I don't think I will be making this one again.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  I have made it many many times and it's always ate til it's gone, especially the potatoes.  They turn out so tasty and soft.  Will keep this recipe for years to come and make often.  I did take the advice to cook the potatoes 30 mins before adding chops so the chops don't dry out.  Very Good! I suggest if you have made this yet, that you give it a try and I'll guarentee you'll make it again!

My family really liked this. I did have to cut down on baking time though. I baked covered for only 45 mins. and uncovered for 15, otherwise I think the potatoes would have turned out mushy. All in all, I think I would try this recipe again.

I made this for my family and friends for the first time and they absolutely loved it! This is the best. This recipe is a keeper. Before browning pork chops I just added Garlic salt and pepper to the chops. Other than that, this recipe is awesome... soft, juicy, and tender. A++++++

Tasty recipe!  I like cooking the potatos and chops together, although I'm sure part of the reason the potatoes taste so good is that all the pork fat melted into them while baking!!  Good reason to try and rend off some of the fat when you brown the chops.  Also, I used the slicing side of my box grater to thinly slice the potatoes and it worked GREAT!  It was super fast too.  Also, the chops were dry when done cooking, so the cooking time could probably use some tweaking.  I'll make this again, with some adjustments.

These were really tasty, and different than how I've had them before!  It was really really time consuming cutting up the potatoes, but well worth it!  Next time I may try to marinate the chops before hand to keep them moister.  Really yummy!

This recipe was easy and tasted great.  I didn't have enough potatoes to slice for 6 cups so I made mashed potatoes with flakes and layered them on the bottom beneath the sliced potatoes.  Everything turned out moist and the mixture of pork chop juices and sauce gave it a lot of flavor

We loved this recipe! Great dairy free meal if you use soymargarine or dairy free margarine. We put ham in with the recipe rather than the pork chops which seem a bit dry. Great dish!

The potatoes were very tasty, but the pork chops were dry, and I was disappointed with them.

This was really good.  We thought it needed a little kick, so added a sliced onion between the chops and the potatoes.  Also, we thought you could add carrots for some color.  Nice, easy meal for a cold day.  The chops came out very tender.  Will definitely make it again.
