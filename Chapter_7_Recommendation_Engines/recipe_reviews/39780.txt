These treats are just INCREDIBLE!! I made these for my college classmates for our last day of class but almost ran out during the day at work when I gave some to my co-workers to try (i go to night school) -- they were beggin for more and I had to keep going back to the fridge to fetch! I thought they would end up snatching up the whole batch.  Also, they were relatively quick to make--didn't take very long for the nougat and caramel layers to set.  The flavor of the butterscotch, milk chocolate, peanut butter and peanuts together were just divine! and that nougat!! omg!! AMAZING!!! =]

I have to agree with the other reviewers - these were yummy!  I had a bit of a problem spreading the bottom cookie layer - it didn't spread very well, but when I baked it, it spread enough to fill in the gaps.  I followed another reviewers advice about the nougat - 4 minutes, slow boil - and had no problems with that - it set up perfectly and spread just as easy.  I didn't refrigerate mine either, I just didn't have the room.
My 5-year old loved these and keeps asking for more!  Guess I will have to make him some!

These are awesome cookie bars, they are almost as Snikers candy bar, but this just taste so good, my friends and family loves them and they want me to make more, but I feel bad because I moved to another state and I don't see them anymore and I can't make them anything!!!

These are very good-a lot like a Snickers Bar.  That being said, a few improvements could be made.  1)  Too much butter in the crust-decrease to 3/4, possibly even half.  2)  It is a job to spread around the bottom layer-I kept having to Spray Pam on my hands to push it into the corners and edges, because it's so sticky-probably the too much butter.  3)  The nougat layer is also very hard to spread around-you have to work FAST before it sets up.  But all in all, VERY tasty and I need to get them out of my house now!!!

Very impressive treat.  Making the nougat layer is tricky.  I did best with a very slow boil for 4 minutes, keeping the burner on slightly higher than low.  Don't let the nougat turn yellow or brown.  It will thicken too much and you won't be able to spread it.  Also, don't feel like you have to refrigerate if you don't have the space.  I left the pans on the counter between layers and they set up well enough for the subsequent layers.

I usually bake 2 to 3 things weekly on a reg. basis...have done this for several years... and I can say that these bars are one of the best that I have ever made.  They are PERFECT!  A bit time consuming, but well worth the wait.  Makes a good amount, but these will not last!
