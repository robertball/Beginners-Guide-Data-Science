Yum, creamy and tangy!  I used lime jell-o as my husband isnâ€™t a big fan of lemon; also, this recipe reminded me of a lime jell-0 my mother use to make.  Other changes I made were simply to cut calories.  I used sugar free jell-o, low-fat cottage cheese, fat-free Cool Whip; which eliminated the need for sugar.  The results were a low calorie dessert.  A definite keeper.

Easy schmeasy! I used pineapple jello as I was in a rush at the supermarket and thought I bought lemon. Even so, yummy!  I bet with the lemon there would be an added tartness to it. My son, who adamantly does not like cottage cheese, loved this.  Reminds me of a recipe my mom used to make a long time ago. Thanks for sharing!

I followed another reviewer's lead to cut fat and sugar.  I used nonfat whipped topping, low fat cottage cheese and sugar free lemon jello.  Delicious, guilt free, and it couldn't be easier!  DH loves it too.  I will be making this often.

Very good salad; very easy to make too. I did use orange gelatin as my store did not have lemon in the 3oz size and I did not want to just use part of a box. I will make this again. I also want to try other flavors of fruit and gelatin. :)

Pretty plain. Used pina colada jello instead of pineapple. I feel like it needed more, maybe toasted coconut and maraschino cherries?

I love this stuff!  I like the fact that it has real cream in it instead of the frozen stuff that has so many chemicals and oil in it.  I also like how versatile it is.  This last time, I added strawberries and used pineapple chunks instead of crushed.  Sometimes, I change the gelatin flavor.  Everyone loves it!
