Amazing. Chicken came out perfect as directed. I do suggest using a homemade sauce....or anything better than Ragu.

we loved it although I did not have chicken thawed out I decided to use aldi's breaded chicken which i baked in my toaster oven for 15 minutes then sliced & made with our favorite sauce (not ragu). I did not have mushrooms so omitted them. It was delicious.

My first time with gnocchi and I really liked the recipe but the gnocchi is very heavy. Stick to the ribs food just not quite for us.

I did not have mushrooms or bread crumbs. I used crushed Tostitos scoops instead adding Italian Seasoning. This substitution was enough salt my husband who usually adds salt to all his food did not reach for the salt this time! I also purchased Gnocchi from the Dollar Store. My husband said that "it was good" twice without any prompting from me! This recipe is super easy which requires very little time. I will definitely make this again. This was served with a fresh lettuce salad and three cheese garlic bread with milk to drink. Perfect meal! Thank you!

This is the third time I have made this and it is great every time! I forgot to get jarred sauce this time and I had vodka sauce in the house so I used that. I think the vodka sauce gave it a unique flavor that was equally awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

I have just made this once so far. The parm breading fell off the chicken because I didn't properly tend it while it was cooking. Even so it was incredibly delicious. I decided to try this recipe after wondering what gnocchi must taste like while playing Hay Day! And it didn't disappoint! Next time I'm going to prepare the chicken parm in a more easily done and traditional manner so it stays where it belongs.

This turned out pretty darn well. I used 1lb chicken rolled in Italian bread crumbs they stick to the chicken just as well without the egg so I skipped that. I also left out the mushrooms because Adam won't eat them and added cooked onions instead. I also replaced the Ragu with a jar of homemade spaghetti sauce and a jar of diced tomatoes. My only concern was that the sauce was not thick next time I will add a thickener such as a can of tomato paste.

ONE egg for a lb of chicken? Maybe an ostrich egg.. Decent recipe used different sauce though. Added garlic and onion
