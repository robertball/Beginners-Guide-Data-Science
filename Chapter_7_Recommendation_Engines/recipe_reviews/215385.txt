These are awesome!!  I had these back in the 80's when I was stationed in Bermuda.  Feel free to substitute walnuts for the almonds, apricots for the dates, I've even used smoked oysters and sliced water chestnuts wrapped with the bacon ... limitless combinations.

I made these today with smokehouse almonds, figs, low sodium bacon, and brown sugar (I forgot to buy soy sauce and ginger).  I also sprinkled them with red pepper flakes after they were in the cake pan, because I wanted them to have some kick (they are devils, after all).  They take a little while to put together, but they cook up quickly, and they're REALLY good.  My buddy who was over to watch football loved them, as did my girlfriend's buddy who was over to get her hair done.  If you want something tasty and impressive, and you don't mind taking a little time to make them, these are awesome.  I think I'm gonna make a super spicy batch for Halloween. :)

This was a hit! We demolished them in about 2 seconds. Everybody wanted more. Only thing I would suggest don't do to much brown sugar. This was a easy quick recipe.

Made these for Thanksgiving appetizers, everyone loved them, couldn't get enough. Impressive yet easy to make. I wonder if you could assemble them the night before and cook the next day just before serving, they are better when warm. Thank you>

What a hit! I served these at my annual Halloween bash and they were enjoyed by everyone! My husband was a sceptic at first but had said he enjoyed them too. I'm glad I doubled the recipe! I had four requests for this recipe.  Thank you for the great recipe swedishmilk!

Loved it! What's not to love? It's got BACON! Personally I think these are way too sweet, else I would give it 5 stars. I just dip the bottom of the bundle in brown sugar before baking. Gotta be the bottom that makes contact with the baking sheet because the brown sugar caramelizes as it bakes and it makes a wonderful texture. With this one tweak, they are PERFECT! Bringing them to a party tomorrow night.

I made these for Thanksgiving appetizers and everyone LOVED them. They were gone within 10 minutes. Go easy on the brown sugar like other reviewers suggested. I was in a hurry and used too much- my fault not the recipe- but they were still great. Very rich and flavorful.

Try stuffing the dates with goat cheese instead of almonds. Skip the ginger, soy sauce and sugar too; there's plenty of sugar and salt in the bacon and dates already. Trust me, these will blow your mind :)

Been making these for years.  Everyone raves about them!  I do two versions: date stuffed with 1/4 pecan and for a more savory version with crunch, substitute a whole water chestnut for the stuffed date.... Delicious!

I did not enjoy the change of texture from jammy date to crunchy almond - sort of like you're chewing gum and then you decide to down a few peanuts.  The flavors work together well enough - just not the texture.

I have made this recipe several times and it has always been a hit. Because the dates are sweet, I like to add Sonoma Jack habanero cheese. My store was out, so I have mixed camembert cheese with some habanero pepper and made a paste. The hard cheese usually works out well, so I'll have to see if a soft cheese works as well. Someone else suggested blue cheese, which I think would also be wonderful.

I made these exactly like the recipe and was very disappointed! I used Mejool dates, put 2 smoked almonds in each one, wrapped them with half a slice of bacon, dipped them in the soy sauce/ginger mix and dipped them into brown sugar, just on one side.  They turned out way too sweet and the dates were mushy. The sweetness even overpowered the bacon flavor!  Maybe a different type of date would work better. I won‚Äôt be making them again.

We love these savory delights!  I did pre cook the bacon for about 7 minutes prior to wrapping as it shortens the overall cook time. I omitted the almonds in half the recipe as some family members aren't that crazy about that addition.  I have also substituted coconut palm sugar, as well as organic sugar, for the brown sugar (just our preference).

I made these for a potluck and people went nuts over them. 4 people told me they were in the dining room and I should run to get them. People acted like someone was giving away money in the dining room. It was by far the best reaction I've ever seen a dish have at a potluck. Only caveat I can share is make sure your baking sheet has a good tall lip and make sure you make lots.

Also: prunes instead of dates, pieces of any liver sausage or pat√© instead of almonds, and maple syrup instead of brown sugar.
Either way, it's paradise on a toothpick. I prefer a variety, all served together.

These are great, and so easy to make.  Took much less time than I expected.  The suggestion to add cheese somewhere is a good idea since a couple people I know don't like things to be too sweet, but I'm not sure I'd want to lose the smokey almond taste in exchange.  Maybe cheese AND almonds inside the dates?

Made these for an office holiday party and they were an instant hit. Baked them the entire 25 min so the bacon was completely well done. Doubled the recipe for the party and it was perfect! Am reading all the variations people have done and am thinking I will want to try some of them too.

I made a batch of these tonight....they didn't last long!  Great appetizer...a real "crowd pleaser" for sure!

i had high hopes for these but they didn't turn out so well.  they taste okay but they didn't look impressive enough for me to bring to a party.

These are amazing. I first had them at a restaurant and made them immediately the next week.  Instead of a nut in the middle of the date, try blue cheese crumbles.  I've made these without the sauce as well - anything wrapped in bacon is irresistible!
