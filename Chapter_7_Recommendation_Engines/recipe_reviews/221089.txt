Note*
The written recipe has omitted the crushed ginger that John mentions in his video.  It DOES make a difference, so add a 1/2 tsp of ginger for the perfect taste he intended.  I didn't have the fish sauce on hand, so I used oyster sauce instead and it was so good that when I made it again,  I was afraid to change the ingredient.  Thanks Chef John, it's wonderful.

I made this yesterday and it turned out great! I omitted the fish sauce from both the marinade and finishing sauce. While I love fish and seafood, the combination with chicken just did not sound appealing. Also, I did not care for the finishing sauce. The chicken was tasty w/o it. I also threw some mesquite chips on top of the briquets for a little smoke. Make sure you use indirect heat otherwise you risk burning it.

I made the marinade portion of this recipe and used on B/S chix b's, delicious!  I added a slug of sherry to stretch the marinade a bit, and marinated overnight.  Very delicious and different.  Thanks, Chef J!

Oh, Chef John! I made this, just hoping to find something a little "different" for a change instead of the typical BBQ. I even started making my own sauce because I got so bored of the jarred ones! This, however, was wonderful! All 6 of my kids, and my hubby gobbled it right away! I had to put 2 pieces aside for my 1 son to have for when he got home from work, for fear there would be none! :) Thank you for sharing this great recipe- I shall use it often! BTW, I didn't change a thing!

I forgot to get lime so just added a little more rice vinegar. Was a little sceptical with the marinade at the beginning but it turned out great. We fried it in the pan first and then put it in the oven for about 30-40 mins. Then we used the juice to make gravy by adding some sugar and cornstarch. It was fabulous!

My family loved this chicken.  I had to adapt some ingredients based on what I had on hand.  I used 10 boneless skinless thighs (they were on the small side).  I used oyster sauce instead of fish sauce and red curry paste instead of hot chile paste.  Marinated 6 hours then grilled.  So tender and juicy with a indian like flavor.  Served this with jasmine rice and steamed spinach seasoned with vinegar.  I didn't make the basting sauce or add the ginger that was not listed in the ingredients but used in the video.  Next time I will try using the ginger, but keeping the other ingredients the same.  It's a keeper.

Just cooked this chicken. The flavors are amazing. I used ground ginger in place of freshly grated but the end result was delicious.

Keep in mind your cooking time is a little shorter when you cut the slits in the chicken breasts.

Will make this many times in the future!

Sounds great, but don't have a grill.  Wish the grill and the slow cooker recipes also had instructions for the oven.

This chicken gives so much bang for the buck!  It was so easy and I had everything it called for on hand (I keep a lump of fresh ginger root in my freezer).  The flavor was not overpowering but strong enough to provide great Chinese BBQ taste.  This one's a winner and will go into my favorites file.

Great recipe, but DON'T brush with the remaining marinade. You may cross contaminate the cooked chicken with bacteria from the raw chicken that was in the marinade! Just make a little extra marinade!

I noticed the freshly grated ginger Chef John added to marinate in the video is not listed under Ingredients section of recipe. What is the exact measurement?

We really enjoyed this recipe. My husband and I used to make a 5 spice chicken years ago, but this one on the grill is the best! I used a smaller-sized chicken for this recipe. Chicken was flavorful and juicy. Will definitely make this again. Thank you!

The chicken was very good but the only thing I thought it fell short was needing a little salt. I will definitely be making again.

I made this because it sounded interesting and it instantly became our favorite baked chicken recipe. The combination of flavors is magical and the chicken is moist and juicy. We tripled the rub to maximize the flavor and have enjoyed every bite.

Used this on a Cornish game hen and it turned out killer!  It was, however, very difficult to scale down for just the two of us.  And both DH and I were very skeptical about the marinade while preparing it:  both the smell and the taste.  We decided we'd go ahead and try it notwithstanding our hesitation.  We are so, so glad we did.  A truly unique flavor.  Will definitely make this again, probably for company.

I was going to try this once more, but hubby didn't care for it so won't. We used chicken breast without the skin so I don't know if that had anything to do with it being so grainy tasting or not. I think it just had to much five spice seasoning, but guess won't be trying to tweak this now. We like five spice seasoning so thought it would be good, but just to much I think.

At 180 degrees internal, it would have been way to dry.  New standards say 165 degrees internal.  This is a great 5 star recipe I will make again with the adjustment in temp.  Never a need to guess with cooking times again.  When your device alarm goes off, pull it off the grill.

I liked this recipe. I agree with John in  that it is very variable depending on the 5 spice blend and the type of Asian chili sauce you use. These two ingredients have a key role in the flavor combination. I think I will try it again using the ones he recommended. I used what I had on hand and it was not as great as I expected . John's recipes are always outstanding so I am sure that this one deserves more attention to the details he provided with regard to the key ingredients. Also
the fresh ginger shown in the video did add to the taste.

This was pretty good. The sweetness of the five spice was awesome at first, but by the time I got half way through my chicken piece it was tiresome.

This was pretty good. Unusual? Yes! Tasty and easy to prepare. I made it twice within a week and both times it was well received. Didn't change anything and by the second time I was just eye balling the ingreds:) Thank you CJ.

Made it as written and we loved it.  Too windy to grill and I had to roast it in the convection oven that only goes to 425: took nearly an hour to cook to temp but was delicious.

Used a FoodSaver marinater and was ready to roast in about 20 minutes.  Delish.

Thanks, Chef John. Will do this again soon!  Had everything on hand, including the 5 Spice!  Yum.

Absolutely no changes are necessary (do include the ginger, that the written recipe omits]. The blend of these flavours is absolutely perfect and my boyfriend raved and raved and raved about this. We actually turned the leftovers into tacos the next day! What an interesting change with some cabbage and a nice yogurt/mayo sauce on a corn tortilla. This is a keeper recipe, for sure!

This was really good.  I baked chicken thighs @350 for almost an hour instead of grilling, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I didn't make the dipping sauce, but I am not sure it is necessary.  I will make it next time, and see what we think.  If you have never cooked with Chinese 5 spice before, the aroma and flavors may not be what you are expecting as it contains  cinnamon, cloves, fennel,  and star anise.  Keep an open mind though, because it really is delicious, just a completely different flavor from a lot of Chinese dishes.

The prep time is not outrageous and if you want to prep something in the morning to eat in the evening, this is a winner.  I took it out of the fridge an hour before cooking so that it cooked through more completely.  DO NOT OMIT the ginger!!!  The flavors are sublime and my wife gave me grief for not making enough finishing sauce (in a nice kind of way).  The chicken was very tender.  I used 4 leg quarters which worked just as well as 2 half chickens and a bit easier to handle.  Everyone left the table satisfied!

I made this five spice chicken for the first time and found my five spice powder had expired back in summer 2017. Still smelled fine and worked beautifully. It's rainy and humid outside so I used Chef John's broiler cooking method. I've only eaten the wings and a small bite of the breast so far but it came out great. I made a second batch of the marinade to baste with since I've always heard its dangerous to use the original marinade for basting.

Chef John is great.  I’ve made a bunch of his other recipes but this one wasn’t one of my favorites.  Ended up using the chicken in gumbo which worked out well.om

This is another very good Chef John recipe!  I just made it tonight but subbed split breasts for the original.  I also cut the hot stuff in half.  I made no other changes and it was my first time using Five Spice.  We really liked it a lot.  It’s going in the ‘do over’ file. Thank you!!

I substituted boneless skinless chicken thighs, for the whole chicken, but otherwise, was faithful to the recipe. I liked it, but wasn't dazzled. I don't know what I would do to improve the recipe next time, so I'll probably just make something entirely different. Chef John's "Cherry Bomb Chicken" is still my all time favorite chicken recipe.

I had never used Chinese 5 spice before and now I’m hunting for more recipes!! This was delicious. I actually used chicken breast cut into cube instead of whole chicken. I marinated the chicken for 2 hours on the counter since I was on a time crunch. Also kept an eye on how the acid cut through the meat to not over process before cooking. I skewered them and grilled on high heat to get a good sear! My husband didn’t talk the entire time he was eating haha I guess he liked it too! Thank you I’ll be making this again.

This recipe made an excellent chicken dish! It smelled wonderful and tasted excellent. I baked my chicken instead of grilling, and it was amazing. Definitely a keeper.

I baked this chicken in the oven on broil for 30 minutes, thighs came out well, but my sister thought the breast was a little dry. I forgot to score the chicken and this probably makes a big difference. I marinated the chicken for about 8 hours, but the flavor was less spicy and a lot more bland then I thought it would be. I doubled the marinade which seemed to be a good amount.  I wondered if a little brown sugar or honey may have helped. Not sure if I will try the recipe again.  Adding oyster sauce may also have given more flavor.  Good luck!

This is really good.  Note fish sauce is very pungent.  Good for marinade but did not include in finishing sauce which came out great with out.  Breast meat w bone and skin took forever too cook!  I thought my digital thermometer was broken.  Took 50 min or so!   Next time I will butterfly breast and grill with thigh meat. Boneless skinless healthier and easier to cook. Still get great flavor from marinade and sauce.  Love the 5 spice.  Thx chef John for the 411 on this.  Also excellent on grilled or steamed zucchini and asparagus!.

Wonderful flavor! When I make again I think I'll kick up the 5-spice blend a bit to intensify the flavor.

This tasted great, altough it has a particular taste I can't describe. Nevertheless, as with every Chef John recipe I had tried, this recipe is easy to make, tastes good and I will definitely do this recipe again.
