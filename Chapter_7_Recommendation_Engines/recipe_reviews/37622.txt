Fantastic glaze!! Took just a few minute to make. I added 1/4 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper - turned out great! You can easily cut the recipe in half if you don't want leftovers. Thanks for sharing!

After my husband had stopped moaning about me pinching his bourbon, he went on and on about how tasty this sauce is!  Definately a winner in our house!  Keep tasting it as you're making the sauce as one flavour can over-power the other if you add too much.  Will make again.

I enjoyed this glaze very much. It smelled awful when making it--but the end result was GREAT!!! I used it to marinate chicken tenderloins which I then grilled. They were delicious! Thanks for the recipe.:)

Excellent. Marinated the chicken breasts for less than an hour basted while grilling. Moist and tasty. (My wife felt the bourbon flavor was a bit strong so I'll probably just use less next time)

We didn't care for this. The bourbon flavor was very strong and it also had too much ketchup. We were serving with salmon so we wanted looking for something sweet but the ketchup was over powering. We tried to salvage by adding a squirt of BBQ sauce but it didn't help. I would also recommend cutting the recipe in half unless you want a ton left over.

This was ok I probably won't make it again. It tasted like a cheap bottled marinade/sauce not what I was expecting. Too acidic & not enough spices. Perhaps use less ketchup or substitute it w/ another tomato product? (paste/sauce/puree)??? It wasn't terrible just not worth wasting another 8oz of booze.:)

I do not usually like the liquor based glazes but I made an exception with this one. I made extra and froze it so that all I have to do is pull it out and add it!

It's a really good glaze but you must reduce it. I noticed that step was omitted in the directions. Mix all the ingredients in a pan heat until it comes to a boil then reduce the heat and simmer until all of the alcohol has boiled off.

I should had realized with such a short recipe for sauce. Tooooo much ketchup you only need a few teaspoons. And like others say yes you must reduce it also add a couple table spoons too thicken up a tad bit. Better recipes out there. I made changes after following directions to make it edible. And add some flavor. Other than ketchup.

My family loves this sauce on Boca burgers! I brush it on one side put it into the pan and then brush the other side. When I flip the burger over I brush the 1st side a 2nd time. Yum! I don t eat chicken and haven t tried it on salmon yet. It keeps the burgers from drying out - often a problem I have with Boca burgers - keeping them very moist and flavorful. I set it for 4 servings and it is just about right for 4 burgers. There was a bit left this time and I m going to try it in scrambled eggs or hash browns or eggs scrambled with hash browns.

Was pretty good. A Lil heavy on the ketchup maybe try 3/4 cup. You can always add more. When it's cooks down the flavor blend better. Would be great for bbq chicken. I was hoping for more of a Japanese style which is probably why I was dissapointed. But going in to it with the right idea in my head I wouldn't have been let down. But was not let down in flavor. Was very good

Reason this only gets four stars. Is cause I made the perfectly. And will have to tweak it next time to get the flavor I was going for. A tad less bourbon. A tad extra brown sugar will make it prefect. Update; Made this again changing a few things. I added a whole cup brown sugar. A little less then a half bourbon. A little extra Worcestershire sauce. A cup of fresh diced green peppers. Marinating cubed chicken and green peppers at least twenty minutes. Then frying in a cast intron skillet.

WAY too much ketchup....if I make this again, I will halve the ketchup and add honey and maybe a smidge more brown sugar. Overall good flavor, just too much of a ketchupy taste for salmon IMO.

The bourbon glaze tasted of sweet ketchup and we could not taste the bourbon at all. This bourbon glaze was just horrible. Do yourself a favor and find a better recipe than this. We some how finished our salmon but it was the worst meal I have ever made. I used good bourbon for this recipe in vain!!!

Outstanding! I simmered the baste to boil down the alcohol so it would flare less on the grill. Also simmered a bit of the sauce to add tableside. My new favorite for salmon!

this recipe made a huge amount of sauce and the flavor and aroma was not pleasing to us. try on a smaller scale if you are trying this for the first time.
