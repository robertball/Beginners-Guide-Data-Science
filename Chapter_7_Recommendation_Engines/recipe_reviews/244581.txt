This soup was just ok to me. It came together very quickly which was great. I felt it needed more spice. It was a little bland for me.

A hearty fast and easy soup for those lazy winter days. The salsa adds a nice spicy touch to this quickly assembled soup.

A fast and easy soup which literally comes together in under 30 minutes if you have the cooked chicken. The soup was hot because of the salsa. I added some tortilla chips.  I think next time, I will add some more spices and vegetables because my family likes different spices in our soup (garlic, cilantro, onions, pepper cumin. Adding two different kinds of beans might give this soup a deeper flavor.
