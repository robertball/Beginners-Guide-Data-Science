We've been wanting to try a bacon and pickle pizza recipe and found this one which looked pretty easy. I followed the recipe with the exception of a few changes: used 6 cloves of garlic instead of 4 and a little more olive oil, baked in increments as suggested, but at 450 F because I use my own pizza crust recipe which needs a little bit higher heat. It tasted similar to a bacon cheeseburger and it would also be good with a little crumbled seasoned ground beef. Great recipe!
