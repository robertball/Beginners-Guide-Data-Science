Very good recipe, measurements are "just right", but for a bit more flavor...add 1 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 tsp. basil to dry ingredients.  

I was in a bit of a time crunch, and couldn't wait the 2.5 hours so here are a few tips... Let the bread machine kneed the dough until a soft, smooth ball forms, 5-10 minutes. Then, turn bread machine off and place the dough into a bowl lightly covered with olive oil or cooking spray.  Put a damp towel over the bowl, and set the entire bowl in a warm place - such as an oven that has been "warmed" and shut off.  Let dough rise for 30 minutes, punch it down and then roll out r toss. Let rest for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to pan or stone, and bake.  Saves you almost 1.5 hours, including bake time!!!!!!

My family loves this pizza dough.  I was having trouble w/it not as crispy as my family likes so I bake it for 5 mins., take it out of the oven and then we dress it up w/toppings and put it back in.  It's awesome.

This was my first pizza dough I made in my new bread machine.  I didn't have any beer since we don't drink and didn't feel like running to the liquor store with my 3 girls (all 4 years and younger).  So I decided to use a can of generic Cream Soda I had in the fridge.  I stirred it up for a while to remove the carbonation and threw it all in the machine as instructed (also added garlic powder and dried basil).  I followed advice of another reviewer and baked crust alone for about 5 minutes then added toppings and finished baking for about 15 additional minutes.  The crust's texture was excellent, the flavor was very good although I could taste the cream soda a little.  I will definitely make again but with beer next time!  Make this, you will love it!  (Oh and it makes one thick crust pizza the size of a normal round Pizza stone)

This is probably the best bread machine pizza crust I've ever made, and we make a lot of home made pizza! I really love this recipe and will use it as our regular pizza night dough.   I don't know what the best part of this dough is, the fact that it is to silky soft but not sticky and really easy to work with, or the perfect flavor and texture after baking!  This made one big 16 by 14 cookie sheet sized pizza.  After the 25 minutes baking I slid the pizza off the pan and directly onto the oven rack for a minute to crisp up the bottom because I used an insulated baking sheet -- great for cookies because it prevents the bottoms from burning, but not ideal for pizza because you want the bottom crispy.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe, and thank you to Chikee for recommending it :)

Yowza!!!!!  This was OUTSTANDING!  Made this for a friend and I and used all whole wheat flour and Coors Light beer.  Added freshly minced garlic and about 2 T of dried basil to the dough and then cooked it on the grill.  Used what was left as some breadsticks that we drizzled with a little butter.  Absolutely wonderful.  Thanks!

Excellent, easy, but does have a very beery flavor.  The dough seemed very sticky when I started shaping the pizza, but got better as it was worked.  I didn't have a pizza stone or pan handy, so with a tip from my brother (the expert pizza guy) I preheated a heavy cookie sheet in the oven, and formed the pizza on parchment paper--then just slid the pizza on the parchment onto the hot cookie sheet.  Easy!  The crust overall was a little thicker than I like, I think next time I may split the dough in half and make two thinner crust pizzas, but that's just personal preference.

I LOVE the flavor of this pizza crust!  Rich and yeasty and beer-y, YUM!!  My tips for making it a little crisper:  Brush the entire crust with a little olive oil before you add your toppings, then pre-bake for 5-6 minutes. Remove from oven, top as desired, and bake again until melty and yummy. If you're like me and LOVE a ton of fresh veggies on your pizza, try this to reduce the water that cooks out of them and makes your crust soggy:  Put mushrooms, peppers, onions, whatever you're using in a bowl and zap them for no more than a couple of minutes in the microwave, then let them rest, covered, for a bit.  They'll partially cook and you'll be amazed at the amount of liquid you can drain off BEFORE you add them to your yummy pizza crust! Enjoy!

I've made a lot of pizzas and can easily say this is one of the best tasting pizza crusts I have made.  Used a cup of Sam Adam's White Ale which I whipped for a minute to get rid of the carbonation and followed the recipe to a T.  Super easy and great flavor.  Thank you.

Good recipe! I like to add a teaspoon of italian seasoning to give it some flavour. I love being able to make my own pizza from scratch - so much cheaper. I made it with flat ginger ale instead of beer once - made a great base for a Thai chicken pizza.

WOW! An outstanding pizza crust.  This IS the one I have been looking for.  I cooked ours on a stone at 550 deg F for 6 min and it came out great.  This will be our new pizza recipe.

Great dough. I prefer a thicker crust, but if you like thin crispy crust this is a five star recipe. The taste is great.

The hubs really liked this crust!  You can definately taste the beer in it.  I dont like beer but tried the crust - it is a bit like a sourdough tasting bread I think.  Very good actually.  Husband said the pizza was better than take out in fact.  I used soy cheese (lactose issue) cooked some ground sausage, pepperoni and added onions I "sweated down" in the microwave.  I used my own sauce I make and freeze so it was fresh tasting and not a canned sauce.  I think the trick to not having soggy crust is to let it sit out for about an hour or more before adding the toppings.  The top layer drys and creates a barrier from the sauce allowing the crust to bake thoroughly.  Pretty darn yummy!  Definately a Friday night routine now - thanks so much for posting the recipe!  (oooh - I wonder if i can make several of them and freeze 'em for a crazy day when I dont want to cook?  Will try and update posting!)-------------------------------Yes, they DO freeze very well!

This was probably one of the best pizza crusts I have ever made! I didn't have any beer, so I substituted flat root beer and omitted the sugar. Husband couldn't guess the secret ingredient but loved it too. Thanks!!

Dough was crispy on the bottom, nicely chewy elsewhere.  Learned my lesson after first failed attempt...where I used COLD flat beer.  This time used 80 degree nuked flat beer.  Temp measured with candy thermometer.  I had not used my bread machine in a loooong time, so had forgotten this Bread Making 101 fact. Oops.  Excited for Take Two since all these reviews were so positive.  Dough was very easy to work with.  Just added a dusting of flour to my board and shaped it.  Transferred into pizza pan with the holes in the bottom and worked just a bit more to shape it to the pan.  Sauce, cheese, toppings.  375 in my convection oven for about 15 minutes or so.  Broiled it on the low rack for a minute or two just to crisp up pepperoni and cheese.  Let it set for a few minutes before cutting.  Used 1/3 amt whole wheat to 2/3 amt white flour to equal the amt called for.  Great recipe.  Will certainly make again and again.

My search for GREAT homemade dough is over!  Who would have guessed that the secret ingredient I've been searching for is BEER!!!  I put everything into the bread machine in the morning before work, and program it to be ready right about the time I get home from work - roll it out, and prebake for 5 minutes (you should always prebake a crust, unless you have a professional pizza oven) top with your favs and walla!!!!  I am so excited for to make this again and again.  The only change I made was using brown sugar and adding dried basil and fresh minced garlic to the crust.

This is an amazing recipe.  If I were to rate it based on my first impression however, I would never had given it five stars.  It literally took me six times of making it before I was able to figure out how to make it correctly.  Here's a few hints:  1. The dough is supposed to be sticky.  It does NOT turn out like normal dough.  I added flour the first couple of times and it turned out BAD. 2. Roll the dough out on a flat surface and then transfer to an oiled pizza pan.  Coat the surface with flour, and put flour on the top so the roller doesn't stick.  I tried putting the dough on to a pizza pan coated with flour, but this didn't help.  The crust stuck to the pan. 3. I only needed to cook the dough, toppings included, 18 minutes.  Check at 15 minutes, and every couple of minutes thereafter.  Do not let it overcook.

I love beer...and pizza...so I love to use different kinds of beer to get different flavors. Ive tried dark stouts to Miller Lite and it all tastes great. The best is a nice pale ale like Sierra Nevada or Full Sail.  The beer doesnt have to be flat, its just harder to measure if it foams up when it pours.  So, just pour it gently, as you should do with all beers, and it wont get foamy.  I leave the dough out to get room temp and it rolls thin.  
I cook it on a pizza stone in the gas BBQ  (preheated at least 30 min) and the crust turns out light and crispy.

Okay, I just made this pizza crust for lunch and had pretty low expectations but this turned out amazingly good. I looked into the fridge before putting the ingredients in the bread machine and noticed I only had a few cold beers in there so I said to my self...Self, just use warm water, it's only lunch and then you can have a cold beer with your pizza(brilliant). I made Jerk Chicken for dinner last night and used that over an alfredo sauce and some other awesome veggies and this was the best pizza I have ever made! I like thin and crispy crust so I sprayed a cookie sheet and just hand pressed out my already risen dough as flat as I could(no rolling pin),about halfway through doing this flip over the crust oiled side up and it won't stick on the pan. Pre-Baked it at 400 for 6 minutes and took it out to cool for a few minutes before topping and then baked at 450 for about 12 minutes for a thin crispy delicious crust that held up to my toppings. I am sure this is great with the beer in it but mine turned out fantastic and I also enjoyed the cold beer with it :)

Wow!!!  This pizza crust was amazing!  I followed the instructions as is, with the exception that I added 2 1/2 TBSP of vital wheat gluten (1 TBSP for each cup of all-purpose flour).  I live in the "Mile High City", and I've discovered that bread and dough seem to turn out better with that little extra bit of VWG...  I used a nice brown ale for the beer upon recommendation from my husband.  He worked for years in the restaurant biz, and he said that's the kind of beer that the good pizza places add to their dough!    Note that this makes enough dough for a BIG pizza.  If you're looking for a medium-sized pizza, you could probably get two of them out of this recipe...but you'll want to eat it all!  Yummy!

Fantastic recipe.  I used a bread machine on dough cycle.  I doubled the portions and divided the finished products into 4 balls of dough.  Each ball was rolled in a teaspoon of Olive oil in a stainless steel bowl.  Each of the balls were then placed into a ziplock sandwich bag.  The balls of dough last 4-5 days in the fridge this way.
To make the actual pizza, I used a perforated pizza pan (15@target), Ragu as a base sauce and store bought grated mozzarella.  10 minutes at 400F convection and voila!  Crispy thin crust pizza..
Spinach Feta is a family favorite and makes a great appetizer for Xmas parties.  Thanks for a great Pizza dough recipe.

This was the absolutely most delicious pizza crust ever!  I grew up eating NJ / NYC pizza, so I know pizza!  This crust was crunchy, and very tasty.  I recommend using a bold beer, like a Stout or an Ale.  I have used Guiness and Newcastle Ale, and they both came out wonderful.

To quickly flatten the beer, take ROOM TEMPERATURE beer and drop in a food processor or blender.  Blend for about 10 seconds, let rest for 2 minutes and repeat twice.

Yummo!!! This is my new favorite pizza crust recipe. I have tried it with all types of beers, today I am using Michelob Ultra ;) and I always throw in a healthy teaspoon of any italian seasonings I have on hand (I just kinda pour it in), plus a tablespoon of grated parmesan is nice too. My kids love thin crust, so I divide the dough and make 2-12 inch pizzas. Plus, I prebake the crusts til they just start to brown, then add the toppings and finish baking them directly on the rack. After all, my goal is a golden brown & crispy crust with gooey cheesy toppings. I have also found that the Hunts traditional spaghetti sauce ($1.00 a can) makes a great pizza sauce! Precook the sauce on the stove with some hot italian sausage slices...the flavor is outstanding!

My family liked this very much, I thought it was so-so.  My biggest problem was shaping the crust since I have never made my own pizza dough before.  thanks for recipe

This recipe came out great I use it for all my pizza doughs.  Dough amounts are not an exact science you have to watch it and add more flour or water to get the right consistency.  In you want to replace the beer with water cut the sugar in half and it should come out the same.  If you want a thinner crispy crust replace the butter with oil and leave out the salt.

WOW!  I consider myself a pizza expert after having spent 6 years of my young life cooking in various pizza joints and continuing my love of pizza by making homemade crust at home for many years.  And, my brother has owned a pizza place for 12+ yrs.  This recipe made the best pizza crust I have ever had.  I had "make your own pizza night" with my 8 and 5 yr old boys and they both agreed it was the best pizza ever.  I used best for bread flour.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I used miller light because that's what was in the fridge.  I'm planning on going with yuengling lager next time!   After the dough cycle, I split the dough into 3 balls and put on plates rubbed w/ olive oil and covered with plastic wrap.  I let the balls sit in the fridge for a few hours.  I made 2 kids sized (10") pizzas and a 12" Stromboli with this recipe.  This is my new pizza dough recipe!!  The kids rolled it, I tossed it.  The dough was very workable using either method.

We don't drink beer, so we don't have any here, so as others have done, I replaced it with just under a cup of water.  I added some garlic powder as well.  I let the crust rise for a half hour instead of 15 minutes and it was so light and delicious.  Definitely will be making this for pizza from now on.

After reading the amazing reviews, My husband and I  had to try this.  This is by far the very best pizza dough we have ever made or eaten!!!!  Beyond Amazing!  As other reviewers, we too added italian seasonings, parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes. We used a spiced olive oil and toppings were bufflalo chicken, blue cheese, red onion..with mounds of pepperjack and mozz cheese Thank you so much for sharing this.   Fantastic!!!!!

The dough for this pizza crust turned out SO NICE! I heated my pizza stone in the oven first and floured my hands and rolling pin and formed the edge into a sturdy crust you could really hang on to. The texture was incredible and was a nice compliment to the veggies I sliced thin with a mandoline. The beer I used was an Alexander Kieth's India Pale Ale, but next time I would like to try a more "stout" beer. Hmmm, there is more sauce, pepperoni and cheese in my fridge... guess I'll need to get to the LC and try it again in a couple days!

Like some other reviewers we don't drink so we don't have beer on hand, so I made this with water instead and it was not only the best homemade pizza I ever had, but maybe the best pizza! This is a keeper for sure! Making it again tonight! :-)  I divided my dough ball into two and rolled them thin because we like thin crispy crust. I added thyme and oregano to my dough and then brushed the top with minced garlic and butter (out of olive oil at the moment). I baked off the crust for 5 min so it would be crisp. Added the toppings and baked for 15 min. What can I say, perfecto.

The best pizza crust I've ever made.  The dough was so easy to work with.  I've tried regular beer and non-alcoholic beer both with the same great results.  I pre-bake my crust for 10 mins, let it cool, then add the toppings and finish cooking.

This is an excellent pizza dough recipe! After making it as written a few times, I decided to tweak it a little to give it a bit more flavor. I replaced 1/2 cup of flour with wheat flour and added in some rosemary, thyme and oregano. Then, I split the dough into two 12 inch pizzas and baked for about 7 minutes before putting the toppings on, then for another 20-22 minutes. In the last few minutes of baking, I slid the pizzas off the pans and onto the rack in the oven to crisp up the bottoms. Everyone loved it, including my boyfriend who insists that he doesn't like homemade pizzas. This is definitely a keeper and I'll be making it again soon!

I'm not sure what I did wrong but I couldn't get it to roll out onto my pizza pan it was really dry. I was terribly disappointed, it sounded so good.  May try it again sometime and just mix it by hand.

This is our go to recipe for pizza dough!  We've made it many times, and love it!  

Our favorite way is with a darker beer (a great way to get rid of those beers that you didn't like), and substituting 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose.  We like it thinner, so we split the dough and get two pizzas out of it.

Absolutely delicious! The texture was perfect! I used this dough for the Chicken Pesto Pizza with Roasted Red Peppers and Asparagus by Mealtime.org on this site. I took the advice of putting the crust in by itself for 5 minutes, then add the toppings and put it back in the oven to finish it. I was glad I did as the very center was a touch doughy. Next time I may pull it off of the pan and put directly on the rack for a few minutes...but the pizza I was making was pretty thick with all of the toppings so this is not the fault of the recipe, more what I chose to do with it :) Oh, and I inadvertently used bread flour but that worked for me. Thanks for a great bread machine dough!

This was the best pizza dough recipe I've tried yet!  I used 1 cup 7-up instead of beer and it was delicious.  I also, due to bread machine malfunction, ended up putting everything in my mixer and kneading for 10 minutes.  I then stretched it and put it on my greased pizza pan.  I turned on my oven to it's lowest setting for a couple of minutes and then placed the dough in and let rise for about 30 minutes.  After it had risen I cooked it per others suggestions for 5 minutes before adding toppings.  After toppings were added I cooked for about another 18-19 minutes and it was perfect.  This recipe made more than enough dough for my 16" pan.  My whole family thoroughly enjoyed it!

What a great pizza dough. I added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and a teaspoon of garlic powder and I used a homemade IPA for the beer; very tasty. I used half of the dough to make a 12 inch thick crust pizza and it was exceptional.

I tried this recipe and follow the directions exactly. I used a Lager and I have a Westbend breadmaking machine. Like the very few that have rated this recipe badly I got a really messy dough that could not be used for anything. I went to the westbend website and used the recipe they offer for pizza dough with much better results!

WOW. I had never used my bread maker before- but I have made A LOT of pizza. I have never had a crust brown like this one, and the taste is wonderful! It's easy to work with, I am replacing this with my old one!! I made as is and loved it- I felt the taste was good enough with out any additional spices =) Also, I didn't have "flat beer" so I just let some sit out for an hour and it worked out just fine lol

This was the first pizza dough I have ever made in the bread maker.  I followed the ingredients but did change how I made this a little.  I did find the dough to be very sticky and quite difficult to handle.  I kneaded it with some extra flour and then left it wrapped in a warm place to rise for about 15 minutes.  I then rolled out the dough and lined the pizza pan.  Did not use the olive oil, but cooked the dough in the oven for 5 minutes before adding the topping.  My family loved this pizza and I will certainly be using the recipe again.  Thank you for sharing!!!

This makes such a soft and tender crust.  My new go-to pizza crust recipe.  I only had non-alcoholic beer on hand to make this but it didn't seem to affect the recipe at all.

I make this recipe all the time.  It is so easy.  If I have beer, I use it.  We keep our beer in the fridge, so I measure out a cup of beer, then microwave it for 30 seconds.  Makes it nice and warm and flat.  If I don't have any beer I substitute diet cola with no problems whatsoever.  The flavor is not quite as "yeasty", but it's still delicious, and a GREAT way to use that last little bit of flat soda in the bottle!  For my family, this recipe makes two 16" round pizzas.  We don't like a really thick crust.  When I make this, I separate the dough into two balls.  One, I press out and top/bake immediately and the other I spray with cooking spray then roll up in plastic wrap that has also been sprayed.  I then roll the plastic wrapped ball in tinfoil.  I freeze the remaining dough.  I've kept it in the freezer for as long as 2 weeks, but I'm sure it would keep for a month.  When I'm ready to use the frozen dough, I just sit it on the counter to defrost (usually takes about 3 hours) then press out and bake as directed.

That was the first time i made pizza dough in a bread machine. The Texture is just perfect! Enough to make a cookiesheet pizza. I did 1/2 beer 1/2 water instead of 1 cup beer because someone wrote it has a beery tast. I did not taste the beer at all, so next time i'll try 1 cup beer ;-) Thanks for sharing this great dough recipe!

I used this recipe to make dough for a pizza roll. I didn't change any ingredients, but when complete I spread some sauce, cheese and meat down the middle of the dough and rolled it up like a giant burrito. I brushed it with egg white before baking.  The beer batter aspect of this recipe was delicious and everyone loved it!

This is my new favorite pizza dough. I used a dark beer, oil in place of the butter, and honey instead of sugar. I have an idea as to why some of the lower star raters ended up with gooey dough...some people spoon flour into a measuring cup then level it off while others just scoop the measuring cup directly into the flour and the level off.  The two methods produce different amounts of flour. For this recipe, I scooped the flour directly from the bag and leveled off, dough results were perfect.

A perfect pizza crust recipe.  Lots of flavour, easy dough to work with, and a lovely texture on finished crust.  I make a lot of pizza and this is my new 'go-to' recipe.  Thanks for sharing=:)

I made this dough for grilled pizza and it's great. The only change- the first time I made it the dough was extremely wet and sticky and it was a (tasty) disaster to work with on the grill. The second time I added about 1/3 cup more flour and it worked perfectly. Yum!

worked great, I substituted honey for the sugar (no sugar on hand), was too sweet though. Next time if I need to use honey I'll just use 1 tbsp. Not this recipe's fault, so it gets 5 stars. I also added a dash of Italian Seasoning.

Perfect moist dough, which I use for my Pepperoni rolls.  I like to throw some pesto into the dough during the final kneading for some extra flavor and color.

This dough turned out great. I added garlic powder and dried oregano and it was delicious as both pizza dough and bread sticks.

Very good crust, thank you so much for sharing it with us!  The only thing I did different was to add about 1-2 tsp of oregano, and it was delicious!

My husband and I really liked this crust.  I'm giving the recipe four stars because while I was forming the dough I had lots of questions... how do you properly prepare a pizza pan?  How do I go about stretching the dough?  Do I need to flour the board I was working on?  Do I cover the shaped dough with a damp cloth?  It tasted great, but was a little frustrating getting there.

Our first attempt at dough in the bread maker but we loved it.  I like a thin base so split between 2 pans and it was perfect.  Thin base meant reducing cooking time to 18 mins.

I found this dough way too sweet. Maybe it was the beer I used (Sierra Nevada IPA), but it was just not good. i didn't mind that it was beer-y, but the sweetness was overpowering.

Super simple to make, VERY TASTY!  I'm a whole grain gal, so I make it using 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 all-purpose (so half and half) and it turns out really well - no need to alter the other ingredients - making a perfect, thick, puffy, yummy crust.  Try it topped with pesto, smoked tofu, red onion, squash, spinach, and mozza -YUM!!

Absolutely amazing bread recipe. I made it twice last weekend--the first time as a pizza which everyone went nuts over and then again as rolls for turkey sliders. Again, everyone freaked over how good the rolls were. I'm going to keep this one on hand and double it for Christmas rolls. So dense and delicious!!! Oh and I didn't use flat beer; I just microwaved a cup for 40 seconds and it worked beautifully.

I added a teaspoon each of basil and garlic powder, and used Sam Adams white ale. I probably should have checked the consistency of the dough while it was being kneaded by the machine, as it was very sticky by the time the machine signaled that it was done. I floured the counter and my hands and worked it a little until it was the right consistency.I spread it on a lightly greased cookie sheet and the end result was very good, although a little doughy. I think if I had heated the sheet first as others have suggested the crust might have gotten a little crispier. Still, very good flavor and I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was really tasty. I followed the recipe exactly and used a coors light. The dough came together beautifully and then I used to for some calzones. Delicious! Will definitely make again!

This is a good basic pizza dough that you can't go wrong with. Try using half whole wheat flour for a different flavor. Top that with garlic cream sauce from this site and some pre-made grilled chicken (for salads) and you have a delicious "gourmet" pizza that tastes like you spent hours preparing it! Add some sun-dried tomatoes to really woo your guests. :)

We now use this pizza crust every time we make pizza.  The only change is that I use oil and not butter. I've made pizza using a pizza stone and a pizza pan with little holes, pizza turns out perfect every time.

I followed this recipe to a T and it did not come out.  When I took the dough out of the bread machine it was so sticky and I couldn't do anything with it.  I finally added more flour and kneaded it before spreading it with my fingers onto the pizza pan.  The dough was then not the right consistency and made a very doughy crust.

This turned out to be very, very good and perfect for a quick home made pizza!  I used to work in a pizza shop and my first impression was it felt just like "real" pizza dough!  I prebaked the crust first, then added my sauce, cheese and toppings.  I loved it!  Thanks!

Absolutely the best pizza I've ever made!  I brushed a little olive oil on some parchment paper then pressed out 4 individual pizzas so everyone in the family could make their own.  Fantastic!  The parchment paper made it so easy to transfer to the pizza stone.  Thanks to whoever suggested that!  The crust was chewy on the inside and a little crispy on the outside.  Yum!

This was perfect and easy. I am no master of bread or my bread machine, and it came out great. I threw about of cup of fresh rosemary in and it was deeelicious! What I love about it is you could easily experiment with different flavors, and make it gluten-free if you like!

I added a teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of basil and this was really really good!  I'm still in shock and walking around saying .."Did you like the pizza?  I made that you know!"  Toot freaking toot.  It was just a tad too thick for a 15 inch pizza for our taste.  But the taste was amazing and the crunch of the crust and the soft inside was just perfect.  The dough was really gooey and maybe it is supposed to be..I haven't had a lot of experience.  What I did was cut a piece of parchment paper a little bigger than the size of the pizza I wanted.  I poured some olive oil in the middle of the parchment and scooped out the dough onto it.  I just kinda used my fingertips to push the dough out to the size I wanted.   After it sat for awhile I then pulled the parchment onto a cookie sheet then pulled it onto my pizza stone in the hot oven and cooked it with the parchment.  Pulled it out of the oven on the parchment then just slipped the parchment out from under it and tossed it.  It couldn't have been easier.

I was so excited to try this version of pizza dough in my bread machine but it turned out awful...first, it was far too wet, I had to scoop it out of the bread machine and add at least another 1.5  cups of flour...it baked semi-ok but the taste was far too sweet...I would suggest less beer - maybe 1/2 but definitely not more than 3/4 c., at least 1 more cup of flour and far less sugar - maybe 2 tsp rather than 2 Tbsp.

This was great and so easy to make. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 1tsp of garlic powder and 1tsp of basil to the ingredients. I also baked the crust for 5-7 min in the oven before putting the toppings on. Then baked with the toppings for 15-20min.  Will definitely be using this recipe often. It was not thin or thick...kind of in between.

This is the best pizza dough I have found so far! It's enough to make 2 pizzas, it's extremely easy to make, and I even use it now when I make krautkuchen (used to use frozen bread dough...never again!). Made the dough exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing...yummy!!

I loved this pizza dough recipe. My beer wasn't flat but it seemed to work fine. I used 2 cups all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup wheat flour. I will make again.

I tweaked this recipe a bit more than I usually do... I used half bread flour and half whole wheat flour.  I used 1 tbsp of honey instead of sugar, and substituted olive oil for butter.  I didn't have time to let the beer go flat and get to room temp, so I just microwaved it for about 20 seconds to warm it up.  The result was some of the nicest pizza dough I've ever used!  It was extremely easy to work with.  It yielded enough dough for 2 large thin crust pizzas, and the crust came out nice and crispy!

This was super easy, and super tasty.  I used a can of beer w/water to make 2 cups, and made two batches.  Each batch was plenty for 2 thin crust pizzas.  I added olive oil in place of butter.  I added 2 tsp of Italian Seasoning and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder.  I made one personal pan size with some left over dough, as my pizza pan is smaller than my pizza stone, resulting in a little excess trimmed off.  The others, I par baked (actually I overbaked but that's okay) and I am going to freeze them for quick pizzas for the teenagers.  Thanks for sharing.

Family & friends love this recipe! I use a can of beer and add water to make two cups and make two batches at a time. I use olive oil instead of butter like another reviewer suggested. Took a pizza to an adult gethering @ church and received rave reviews. Have also used dough for calzones and stromboli. Excellent.

This recipe was outstanding!  Really didn't think I could make it that good!  Tasted like deep dish, but light and fluffy too!  I tried to make it thin crust, but let it rise too long before baking, but it was scrumptious.  I did add italian seasoning and garlic to the dough and pre- cooked it five min as was suggested.  IS now our fav!  Thanks Kim!!

Perfect in every respect.  Easy to make, nice consistency & workability, and everyone loved it.  Once rolled on the pan, I sprinkled with salt & pepper.  Next time I make this recipe (and I definitely will), I will be giving the basil & rosemary a try as suggested...Thanks Kim!

There was a sticky gooey mess in our machine when the cycle was complete. We followed the recipe to the letter. Maybe it doesn't work well in some machines.

This is an excellent pizza dough.  Works wonderfully in the bread machine.  I doubled the recipe and it worked perfectly.  If you are worried about tasting the beer, worry no longer.  We could not taste it at all.  I used this as a pizza dough, for sticky buns, and for Salsa Biscuit Chicken, and it worked perfectly for all three recipes.  Bf was thrilled the sticky buns were so soft, so I guess I'm going to end up making rolls out of this dough.  The pizza was great with a perfect crust.  I actually baked it partially then added my toppings, as the recipe I used (Chicken Salsa Pizza) called for a prebaked crust.  Worked just great, and I'll definitely use this crust again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was an incredible recipe! I added some chopped fresh basil and 2 cloves fresh chopped garlic to the bread machine. (I threw it in with the beer, butter, and sugar!!! I also put cornmeal on my baking sheet after oiling the pan to preven the dough from sticking. I also followed another review and baked my dough for 5 min before adding the toppings. Delicious-my crust was just right, better than any restaurant pizza!! Thanks!!

This recipe has the perfect ratio of liquid:flour:yeast to make a light, smooth (not sticky) dough. I've used beer or water, and white or whole wheat flour. It always turns out great. I stretch the dough fairly thin and make 2 x 12" round pizzas with the amount of dough this recipe makes. I bake on the top rack using one of those pizza pans with holes in the bottom for a crispy crust. The only thing I'd change is I find it only needs about 15 minutes rather than 24 for the crust to be crispy and the cheese to be melted.

I have tried many different pizza crust recipes over the years and have found my #1 right here.  I add 1-2 tsp of italian seasoning and a tsp of garlic powder to the mix.  I like to rub the pizza pan with a thin layer of olive oil and then press the dough into shape.  Like a few others have said, bake the crust alone for about 5 min in the oven and then take out and put on your toppings and return to the oven for another 15 min.  Absolutely perfect!

Very good.  I added garlic powder and dried basil, and actually cooked our pizza on the grill.  I say it turned out pretty good considering it was my first attempt.  If you want to try, make sure the grill is really hot, and the dough is rolled thin.  Place the dough on the grill, once it's starting to bubble, flip it.  Then very quickly add sauce and toppings.  Pizza cook very fast, so be sure toppings are precooked.  Delicious!

This recipe was very tasty.  We substituted wheat flour, so it didn't rise as much as it probably would have with white flour.  I plan on making it agian, perhaps next time with a mix or white and wheat flour.  I made this again, several times.  I now use 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour.  I love the taste.  My daughter still complains a little, but I know it's a lot healthier than the Little Ceasars Pizza she'd rather have.

I really liked this dough.  I made two pretty big pizzas with it.  I tried wsf's pizza w/potatoes/pesto/onions; but also added mushrooms and mozzarella balls on half, the other half was vodka sauce/shredded mozz/taco meat.  I cooked the dough for about 10 minutes before putting toppings on; and roughly another 9 minutes or so until the cheese was melted.  I will use this recipe again.

This is great pizza dough.  Better than the old recipe I used to use.  I made it exactly as described and it was perfect.  Not too wet or sticky.  Next time I will add some garlic powder to the crust to add a little more flavor.  This made about 1 10-in pizza, 1 12-in pizza, plus some breadsticks that I patted out into an 8x8 baking dish.  I rolled the pizzas out very, very thin however.  No par-baking required, although you may want to do that if you roll it out thicker (ie, make only one pizza with the whole recipe of dough).  Baked at 450 on my pizza stone for about 6-8 minutes (longer for the bigger pizza).  I'm already planning on making them again in a few days.  Lots of fun for the kids too!  It made plenty of pizza for 2 adults and 2 small kids.  Would need more dough if you added adults.

Very good, will be adding this to the favorites pile.  Also, the recipe makes a little too much for my pizza stone, so I broke some off and rolled into bread sticks.  Brushed with olive oil with garlic and italian seasons.  The breadsticks were great too.  I also brushed the pizza crust with the olive oil and seasonings mixture and sprinkled parmesan cheese on the crust.  It came out very good.

Wonderful!!I used bread flour and a wheat beer that husband didnt like. Couldnt ask for a more perfect crust, and I've tried a lot. I cooked it on a pizza stone, at 450 was more like New York style.

I have made this close to a dozen times.  I use flat Guiness.  Add whatever Italian seasonings you like and can be frozen in saran wrap sprayed with Pam!  Just defrost when ready to use.

I love this pizza dough recipe.  If you use good beer or ale you can get a good flavor.  I also substituted half the flour for wheat, and put some italian seasoning in the dough as it's mixing in the machine.

It comes out a bit bread-like for me.  I'm going to try to roll it out thinner, maybe make 2 pizzas out of it.

I bake a lot of bread, and I've made a lot of pizzas in my time. This was absolutely the best tasting, and easiest pizza dough ever. I added some oregano, thyme & garlic to the crust. I didn't have any beer on hand, so I just used water. Can't wait to try it with the beer. Recipe was perfect for one large pizza. This will now be my "go to" recipe for pizza dough. Thanks for sharing.

WOW WOW WOW!! I've tried DOZENS of pizza dough recipes looking for that perfect one, and I finally found it. The beer is what makes this recipe so good, and that's coming from someone who HATES beer! This dough is very yeasty and rises up very nicely. I followed the advice of a few other reviews and pre-baked for about 5 mins, though I could have probably done longer. I brushed it with mushroom and sage infused olive oil beforehand. YUM! Also, I made one 12 inch pizza on my pizza stone and the crust was very thick and soft. I easily could have made two pizzas with thinner crusts. And to think, all I did was throw everything in the bread maker! I WILL be making this recipe again and again and again!

This is excellent- just like restaurant or delivery pizza crust. We did bake 5 minutes before adding toppings. Will make again!

I dont get it.  My husband and i have both tried this recipe.  Both times, we had to add tons of extra flour to make it useable.  When, we try the pizza it is bland and bearly edible.  The first time, I blamed him.  When I tried to do it, I had to apologize to him.  :)

Tried this recipe for tonight's dinner and loved it. I followed it as written except added olive oil instead of butter. I had to sprinkle some flour on the counter to work with it as it was a little sticky. It had an excellent crisp crust with an airy, chewy interior. I baked it at 425°F for 20 minutes on the middle rack of the oven on a 16" perforated aluminum pizza pan. No need to par bake as it's the perfect amount of dough for a 16" pan.

I use this recipe all the time, it is the only recipe you need! I have made just a few minor changes, olive oil for the butter, and brown sugar instead of white sugar. As for the reviews stating that it didn't cook fully, I would like to offer a few tips. First off, use a good heavy pizza pan, a pan with a thicker bottom will brown the bottom more evenly. Second, I put the prepared pizza on the lowest rack of the oven for the first 5-6 minutes of cooking, then I move it to the middle rack for the rest of the time. This is a great recipe that allows you to make pizzeria quality pizza at home!

We made this just as is except baked for 5 minutes before adding the sauce and toppings. It is a great start and would only be made  better by adding some spices for flavoring.

This was my first homemade pizza dough and I was very pleased with how it turned out. I read several reviews and took some advice. (1) I used half whole wheat and half bread flour (2) I didn't have any beer, so I used a cup of dry white wine that I already had open. (3) Too quicken the process, I took the dough out of the bread maching after it went thru a couple kneading cycles. Maybe 15 min. I put the ball of dough in a glass bowl, brushed it with olive oil and covered it with a clean damp dish towel. Then I put the whole thing in the oven I had preheated and turned off for about 30 min. I stretched and rolled the dough very flat (mine was not at all sticky... didn't even sprinkle flour), because several comments said the dough was thick. (4) I baked the dough 5 min on a pizza stone to prevent it from getting soggy. This made a huge difference as my crust turned out dark brown in the end. (5) I quarted the ball of dough and froze 3 of the balls and cooked the fourth as personal pan-style pizza. With some leftover farmer's market veggies (eggplant, zucchini, red onion, tomatoes), olive oil, shredded mozzarella and italian seasonings it turned out yummy! Can't wait to make it for my husband!!

turned out great! The right amount of pillowy dough & crunch! I must say i was concerned halfway through the proofing stage for the dough cause it had lost its round ball look but it worked out perfectly!

The first beer pizza dough recipe I ever tried, and I'm not going anywhere else!  I tried it with Bud Light Golden Wheat (was the only thing I had) and created my signature pizza.  Apparently, it was the best thing I could have done!

I added 1 tbsp minced garlic during the appropriate step in the bread machine's cycle, and it adds just enough extra flavor to be a huge hit in my house!

This was the best pizza crust recipe I've tried. I doubled the recipe, to get three small pizzas, but I used 1c beer and 1c warm water. Very good tasting crust. Love it.

Perfect base recipe; Add whatever you like to dress it up!  I followed the directions exactly--though the first time i used it I "flattened" my beer by microwaving it for a minute. I'm not sure that it would make a difference if you used a new beer.  I used this for hot pockets, and they were great!

I have used non bread machine and one other bread machine pizza crust and this one is the best I have tried!!  It is so simple to make and doesn't require a whole lot of ingredients.  I used Bread flour when I made the crust and did everything else the same.  It was so good, my husband and I couldn't resist only eating two slices of pizza.  We also made another pizza the next day and the day after...That is how good it was!
I now make this recipe with 1 can of beer at room temperature.  We use our favorite beer and I just flatten the beer myself by pouring from one cup to another.  Also if beer isn't warm, will heat up in microwave to save time (Important to have ingredients at room temp).  I also use 3 tablespoons butter, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoon salt, 3 3/4 cup flour and 3 1/2 teaspoons of yeast  (basically a recipe and a half).  After the dough has been made, I will divide the dough and roll into two pizza crust.  One for adults and the other for the kids!  I love to use barbecue sauce instead of pizza sauce.  IT taste amazing, give it try!

I have made quite a few pizza dough recipes and this one is a definite keeper. I made as directed, and didn't need to add any additional flour at all - it was a great dough recipe just as is. If I use my bread machine to make pizza dough, this is the recipe I'll reach for. Thanks for sharing, Kim

I used this pizza crust as a base for calzones! It gave it a lighter and crispier texture than store bought bread dough. I didn't have any beer on hand so I used Club Soda, but other than that I followed the recipe.  For the calzones I divided the dough into six balls, and rolled out individual calzones. I used chicken, broccoli, and ricotta cheese for the filling and baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes until the they were brown. Everyone loved them!

This was excellent! I used an additional Tbsp of beer (we're above 5000'), then I baked the dough for about 10min before adding my toppings, when there was 5 minutes left I slid the pizza off the stone onto the oven rack as another cook suggested to crisp up the bottom.

Easy to make, and so much better than those store-bought doughs that are either in the deli case or freezer.  Very similar to the dough my parents used at their deli for pizza and calzones.  I did not add extra spices - I bet it would be good! - and I did add an extra 1/2 cup of flour after reading complaints about it being sticky.  I also sprinkled a little cornmeal on the pan before spreading the dough.  I have commercial pizza pans, so I did not have a problem with it being too thick at all....I didn't have to precook it before adding toppings.  I also used fresh beer.  Thanks for the recipe...definitely a keeper!

Great recipe. Like the suggestions to add garlic, rosemary, and oregano. Also like that it calls for 8 oz of beer, which leaves 4 oz of the bottle for me to enjoy! :)

This was the best, but if you are using your breadmaker to make the dough, DO NOT use regular flour as it says.  Use bread fllour.

I have tried a few pizza dough recipes and this is the best so far. I did not have beer one time and I just equal amounts of water and it was still really good. I also followed someone else suggestion of baking 5 minutes then adding the toppings. A regular recipe in our house now!

This dough was fantastic. I've made it twice this week already; the second time doubling the batch, which worked out nicely.

FABULOUS!  worked like a charm with all whole wheat flour, healthy and yummy!  also, used beer straight out of a bottle, fresh not flat, and it worked fine.

Fantastic pizza dough recipe - best I've ever found.  I used milk since we don't have beer in our house.  It was delicious and will definitely be made many times over.  I used it for some bacon-ranch puffs the first time and they were awesome.

We thought this was great!  I poured the beer into a measuring cup and kept on the counter for a couple hours to get flat. I also added about a teaspoon each of garlic powder, dried oregano and basil to dough ingredients.  Once it was done in the bread machine, I pressed the dough onto a pizza crisper and let sit 15 mins.  I baked approx 5 mins at 425 then pulled out, added toppings and baked approx 12 mins more.

This is our absolute favourite pizza dough (and we've tried many).  The low alcohol beer sold in grocery stores is cheaper than regular beer and works well with this recipe.    We sometimes substitute 1/2 whole wheat flour with great results.

This is the best pizza dough that I have had in a very long time. I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour to make it a little healthier, and 1/2 cup of white flour. I will be using this recipe for the remainder of my cooking years! :)

I am just getting around to rating this, I have been using it for months now. We always have beer on tap at our house so thats waht made me try this recipe, although, I prefer it better with milk or water, less of a tangy tast... I followed other reviews and add red pepper and other s pices to give more tast to the dough. I make french bread, pizza, strombolli, this is the BEST recipe if you have a bread maker

Very good pizza dough that turns out a delicious crust! I did not have time to let the beer become flat before using in the recipe, but I did heat it in the microwave before adding it to my bread machine and this seemed to aid in flattening it. I made 1/2 again as much dough, divided it into 3 equal portions. My son requested a double decker pizza for his birthday and I had  never made one before. I flattened and pressed two portions of dough into two 16 inch rounds on sprayed cookie sheets. I then pre-baked these for 10 - 15 minutes. I slid one onto a perforated pizza pan spread pizza sauce, 1/2 the toppings and 1/2 the cheese on it. Slid other crust directly on top and topped it with the remaining sauce, toppings and cheese. I finished baking it for 20 - 30 minutes until the cheese was melted and light brown. The third portion I made into a single thin crust pizza using the same pre-bake, top and finish baking technique. Both turned out fabulous! Even the leftovers were great the next day!

Great recipe. The beer probably contributed to the amazing rise of this dough. I used Corona Extra. Nothing beats a fluffy yet crisp crust. 400 degrees & 20 minutes worked for me.

This was very good.  I didn't have any "flat" beer.  I didn't even know how to make it go flat since I tend to consume it before it ever gets to that point. LOL!  I used room temperature beer that I had left opened for 15 minutes.  I found out later that shaking a bottle before opening it would make it go flat.  Too late for me this time but great to know it for next time.  I doubled the recipe and I was glad that I did because it was yummy.

This is a great, easy dough!  As suggested, I added some oregano and basil to the dough, and I think it helped.  I had the same issue with it being a bit too soft (almost soggy) when baked, but I think if just the crust was baked for 5 minutes before adding toppings (a cookbook I have suggests this, and it does help it crisp), that would take care of the problem.  My kids LOVED being able to help with the pizza, so I have a feeling I will be making this a lot!

I usually buy frozen dough balls at the grocery store, but decided to try this recipe instead. What a flavorful, easy way to make pizza dough in the same amount of time it takes to defrost store-bought! Hubby even remarked how much better it is. Thanks for the recipe.

Sorry, this was just OK.  It was easy to make but I would have worked harder for a better crust.

Maybe I am too picky as I am from Chicago.

This recipe is fantastic!  I tried it on my 4 grown sons and their families and got rave reviews on the crust and toppings too.  I added a 3/4 tsp of italian seasoning to the crust and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder before mixing started.

I precooked all the meat, (sausage, chicken  and bacon), with the exception of the pepperoni of course and added tons of different toppings to the two pizzas I made.  I pre-baked the crust 8 minutes, added the toppings  and baked another 12 minutes.....UHMMMMM, the best part though was the crust.  I will make this again and again, it has become the family favorite!

I made 3 different pizza's with this recipe. The 1st pizza came out really thick and hearty, but I used whole wheat dough. The second one I used all-purpose flour and it came out as as a thick crust pizza. The 3rd one came out a little runny, so I added some more flour and was just perfect. Will make again!

I order this every time I'm in Chicago, but haven't found it served anywhere else.  This is almost EXACTLY what I was looking for!  I made a bread machine pizza dough recipe (1/2 whole wheat - no one could tell) and the dough amount was perfect for 2 crusts in a spring form pan.  I added a full cup of riccotta cheese - too much.  I added a clove of garlic to the spinach as well.  

Next time I'll use only 1/2 c. ricotta (which gives a nice lift) and add in another 1/2 c. mozzerella to the spinach mixture. I think we'll have the perfect Chicago pizza then!

This is awesome!  I have made this four times in the past two  weeks and will be making it again this week. So far, I have used Miller Lite, but will be trying with Corona next time just for a change.  This is the favorite of my family and the only recipe I will use now! I pat the dough out on my baking sheet with brushetta flavored olive oil for an added boost!

This was easy and looked great. The family loved it. I personally didn't care for the beer taste and I prefer a yeastier flavor. I had to add quite a bit of flour to make it work--I doubled the recipe so maybe that is why. I highly recommend it for ease and if you like the beer flavor.

9/16/07: This is the first time I have ever been able to make a restaurant-style pizza at home.  The whole family raved about it, and I am getting ready to use this dough to make another pizza for dinner tonight - second time in three days! I used a pinch of Italian Seasoning in the beer for extra flavor and baked on a pizza stone, which only took 15 minutes.  Definitely do a light coating of grease to prevent sticking. Updated 8/25/09: This is still my standard, but I have switched from flat beer to milk.  I found that beer can give the dough a bit of a bitter flavor, where the milk gives it a bit of sweet.  I split the dough in half for a thin, crsipy crust (and save the other half in the fridge for pizza later in the week).

This was our first time making pizza dough, and it won't be our last!  I used my machine's timer so that the dough would be ready about when we got home from our Girl Scout meeting.  I used a rimless cookie sheet with parchment paper, and just spread it out, kind of free form.  Followed someone's advice to bake just the dough for about 5 minutes, to help make the crust crispier, and followed someone else's advice and microwaved our onions and peppers, to help remove some of the liquid from them.  I made a homemade sauce, mixing a few recipes from this site.  ~~~  Yummy pizza!  My husband commented that he could actually taste the crust.  Now I just need to figure out if I can make the dough and refrigerate while I make a second batch, so we can have two pizzas at once!  ~~~ Thanks for the recipe!****Note to self:  preheat pan, stretch dough on parchment, let rest, then slide onto preheated pan, bake dough ~5 minutes, then add toppings.

We love this recipe.  My beer is never "flat".  I take it straight out of the fridge and never have any problems.  We like thin crust, so this makes 2 crusts for us.  I also add 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning, which tastes awesome.  Thank you so much for the excellent recipe!!

I made this dough tonight with Yuengling traditional lager and it was delicious! I also substituted the butter for Crisco as I was out of butter and you could not tell. Whenever I buy premade dough at the grocery it is just okay but now I will never go back! This is my go to recipe from now on. 

One tip as well is I only needed to bake mine for 17min so make sure to set it a few minutes early so you don't burn your crust.

I topped mine with homemade tomato sauce and shredded fancy blend cheese as well as sauteed onions.

Love this recipe! Use it all the time. I substitute half whole wheat flour for the white. I also use honey instead of sugar. However you do it, it's good

It has taken me years to find a good pizza dough recipe!! I didn't have flat beer so I heated it up on the stove then let it cool. Added everything to my kitchen aid mixer and let it mix for 10 minutes. Then I set the dough in a warm place for 30 minutes and then tossed it instead of rolling it. I baked the dough for 5 minutes first on 400 degrees. Then I added my toppin. And baked for 15 minutes and it was amazing!! Thank you so much for this recipe!

Just made this for the first time... It was GREAT! I used whole wheat flour and miller light beer. I also added a tsp of garlic powder after reading other reviews. I baked crust for 5 minutes first as well. This recipe was very easy to follow and very tasty! Will make again soon!

Great taste and nice rise. We like a thinner crust, so I would make two slightly smaller pizzas out of the recipe next time...but still Loved it.

If you want your home to smell like a pizzaria, make this recipe!  I made a double recipe in my bread machine, used half whole wheat flour and 2 tsp brewers yeast as well as 2 tsp garlic powder and 2 tsp basil as others had suggested.  Used one can lager beer and topped it off with warm water and mixed with Braun hand mixer to get the bubbles out.  I did have to add about 1/2 cup more water when the bread machine started squeaking.  The dough was perfect!  Pre-baked for 5 min on a pizza stone with fine corn meal on the pizza peel.  Loaded the two thick-crust pizzas and baked till done.

I've used this recipe a few times and it is a favorite in our house. A while back i decided to make a batch and freeze it. It worked great. When I took the dough out of the bread machine I rolled it in a ball and wrapped it in plastic wrap then put in a ziploc bag. When I wanted to use it I took it out of the freezer and left it sit on the counter. It took about 2-3 hours to thaw. Put it on the pan and it rolled out nicely. This is such an easy recipe that is great tasting crust. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe Kim.

I have been puttering around with this app for about 2 months now and used a few recipes. I love to cook but don't make many dishes past my normal set... THIS PIZZA WAS AMAZING! I have been up twice tonight to sneak in and have a midnight snack! My roommate said it tasted like Luigi's here in Sacramento. She doesn't know that I secretly hold Luigi's as THE BEST pizza IN Sacramento! I used the exquisite Pizza sauce on allrecipes as well. (btw I skipped the honey and the chili flakes in that recipe). I seem to always have made the mistake of not preheating my pizza stone enough. LET IT HEAT FOR A HALF HOUR. The dough came out crispy and browned and it held up just holding near the last quarter of the slice. I did precook the dough for 5 minutes. But it didn't need it. In fact I had to go just a little longer to cook the onions. But WOW. I followed the instructions exactly. Lol, I took so many pics of the whole process I have a mini album called "My First Perfect Pizza"!THank you to whoever posted this recipe. I'm gonna make another pie tonight! I have no real reason to buy Pizza out anymore. OK, I'm done with the review, gonna go sneak another slice.

Very easy to make. It took me a few tries to roll out the dough and pick it up to put on the stone without it tearing apart because I've never made dough before I didn't realize I needed a lot of flour underneath and on it while I was rolling it out. I baked the crust 5 minutes per recommendations of other reviews. I could have let it bake a few more minutes before adding the toppings.  Turned out great. I could have used a little more corn meal on my stone because I found a few spots where the dough stuck. Next time will be even better. The family had fun making it and it disappeared very quickly.

This is the closest I've come to the perfect, thin, pizzeria style crust I love ! The first time I made this, I assembled all of the ingredients only to find that my bread machine no longer worked. So I made it the old fashioned way and it came out ok. When I bought a new machine, this was the first recipe I tried. I subbed water for the flat beer, because I had none, and spread the dough out on a standard cookie sheet, used a pizza sauce recipe from this site. (the recipe makes enough for two pizzas, and freezes well) We loaded it up with toppings, and let it bake. MMM-MMM, my house smelled so good. Everyone loved it, and my husband commented that this was my best crust yet! Thanks, Kim. This is a keeper!

turned out fantastic!!  I just put beer in the microwave for 2 minutes and then in the fridge for about 15 mins to cool down to make it flat.  I also added 2 tsps of italian seasoning, and i used whole wheat bread flour.

This is a great dough starter recipe. Once I add all the spices then its 5 starts. I put in about 2 tbs of just a Pinch Italian Seasoning by McCormick and 1 tsp of garlic power, 1 tsp onion powder. gives it a great flavor.

This recipe is amazing. It comes out of the bread machine perfect every time. You get out what you put in to it, i.e. if you use good beer it will be awesome, if you use a cheap light beer it will be so-so. I (almost) never order pizza anymore because this crust blows any pizza place out of the water. I like using Vienna Style Lagers, it gives a nice sweet flavor to the crust.

I really enjoyed how easy this recipe was, and we really liked how the end result tasted. I baked the crust 5 min before topping it and baked it another 15 min. It would have been perfect, but we found it to be a little too much bread/crust. We usually like non-thin crust pizza, because the crust is so good, but this pizza crust was a little too much. My hungry husband only had a quarter of the pizza for dinner, rather than about half a regular pizza. So, I think I'll try a thinner recipe next time.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!! I have found that Budweiser is the best for traditional dough.  I also use this same dough for calzones.  Husband says it is better than anything he's had at a restuarant!  I sprinkle in a little garlic salt and italian seasonings.  Makes sure and brush with melted butter for that perfect golden crisp top.

This dough came out of the bread machine a bit sticky, but I added some flour and kneaded it a few more times. The finished product had a great texture, very soft.

I actually subbed water for the beer, and olive oil for the butter and it still turned out good. Although the dough was very sticky and stuck to my pizza stone, the taste was great. I think I may just be at fault there, not the recipe. This was my first attempt at homemade crust, and also using yeast!

The dough texture was great!  I'm not a beer fan and would have given 5 stars but I felt the beer taste was too strong.  Next time, I will take the suggestion of cutting the beer to 1/2 cup and 1/2 cup of water.  I added Italian spices to the dough.  Smelled wonderful!  Made a very thick crust.  Next time, I try this recipe, I will cut the dough in half and make two smaller pizzas.

Great recipe.  I made mine ahead of time and put in the refridgerator for a few days till I was ready to use it.  Still came out great and easy to roll and work with.

Best bread machine pizza dough I've tried so far.  I had a bottle of Sam Adam's Porter (which I don't like very much) in the fridge and used it. Mmmmm, the brown porter gave the dough a nutty, malty flavor and just a bit of a brown color.  You should try it.

I make dough by hand and thought I would see if this was easier/better.  When it came out, I was shocked!  It was goopy and sticky.  I had seen the reviews, and pressed on, figuring we could get take out, if necessary. :)

I stretched/scooped it into a stoneware bar pan and followed the others, by pre-baking it, then topped it and baked it for 17 minutes more at 400.  It is fabulous!  In fact, I am on my 3rd square of pizza as I type.  Thanks for the recipe!

A great basic pizza crust.  I make this all the time now.  My favorite way to top it is to use ranch dressing for the sauce, chopped chicken tossed in buffalo sauce(melted butter and hot sauce), mozz/cheddar mix and parm cheese.

wow!never would i have imagined you could make pizza at home that tasted like you bought it from a pizzeria and you don't even have to know how to throw and toss the dough! i was going to prebake the crust as others had suggested but i forgot...Doh! it came out fine. on a scale from 1 to 10 i would give it a 9. i bet if i had remembered to pre bake it would have been a 10++. can't wait to make it again! great recipe!

Love this bread! I follwed ingredients pewrfectly but used anothers suggestion to only let it go 15 mins in machine then let it sit in coverd greased bowlfor about 30 mins. We made stuffed chesey bread (like dominios) and it was really good! The bread itself is great! I will make this again for sure.

I followed suggestions by others to bake dough for 5 minutes before adding toppings.  This is the first pizza dough that I've been able to shape, bake and remove from pizza stone with ease. 
Thanks for the recipe.... it's a keeper!

This is a lot of dough for one pizza. I love the recipe and added an extra tablespoon of italian seasoning to the dough. It rose so high I had to make garlic butter to dip the crust in. Maybe next time I'll make bread sticks to go with it from the leftover dough! YUMMM!!!

I was a little hesitant because it had beer...loved the end result but I think next time I will add some garlic and other spices to give it more of a kick. Dough was easy to work with. Even the hubby liked it and he is very picky about pizza

I can't believe I've been using the recipe that came with my bread machine for all these years...this is going to be my new standard recipe for pizza dough. It is awesome...I kept trying to figure out why one of my kids didn't like my homemade pizza...what kid doesn't like pizza?! Well, this crust did the trick. I added garlic powder and basil to the dough, like other reviews. Great, simply great. Thanks for sharing!

You gotta make this pizza dough - I stopped making pizza at home because they all were the same taste to me - not this one.  It is sticky to work with but I just put it on my pizza stone and pre baked for 5 min. - I can't rave enough about this dough.  Thank you Very Much -

Best pizza dough ever. Easy, delicious, and if you prefer a thinner crust, you get 2 pizzas out of it. Our beer isn't always flat, but when it is flat, the dough is easier to manage. Thanks to this recipe for the dough and the recipe for Exquisite Pizza Sauce on this site, my pizza is one of my husband's favorite meals!

LOVE this recipe, I have made it twice now for me and my husband and we love it! Only thing I change is adding some Itailan herbs to it to add flavor. I love that it is a risen crust and not a thin crust too.

This was a great recipe for a thicker crust.  I used my kitchen aid with bread hook for nine minutes then let rise for one hour in pre-warmed oven.  It doubled.  Punched it down, put it in a well-greased cookie sheet and let it rise another 15 minutes.  Will use again adn experiment with different flavored crusts b/c we like to experiment.

This is an amazing dough.  My kids love it, their friends love it.  Its easy to work with and comes out perfect.  I am a whole wheat gal so I used best for bread 100% whole wheat flour rather than all purpose.  I've made it with spices mixed in and without and different beers.  I pre cook mine for about 10 minutes then top it and finish it off.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME! This was a great basic dough recipe! I used Honeybrown since its a tad sweet and I added minced garlic, basil, parsley, pepper and parmesean cheese. FANTASTIC dough, will make again and again and try new spices!   My only note of caution: Our pizza was done cooking in about 15 minutes, probably because we used a cookie sheet, so just be watchful of cook time.

Loved it! Didn't have beer so substituted water, used olive oil for butter and 1/2 wheat flour in place of 1/2 c. of the white. Will definitely make again!

I used a deep dish stonware pan, and the crust still rose 1/2" over the top of the pan!  24 minutes was perfection.  At first I was a little worried because when I stretched it into the pan, it got a little flabby/ wimpy looking and didn't seem to raise much.  But, when it hit the oven - magic!

Honestly by far the BEST pizza crust I have ever made.  The kids loved it also.  I doubled the recipe and it made 2 large pizzas (nice thick crust, but not too thick) and a small pizza, which I did not put any toppings on.  I cooked it plain and put garlic butter on it and cut into bread sticks.  It will definately be the only pizza crust I make from now on.  Oh, and to make the beer flat, I brought it to a boil on the stove and then put it in the freezer for a bit to cool it back off.  Worked great!

Truly good! Will add some basil & oregano next time. Pre-baked the pizza for 10 minutes, topped it and put back in the over for 10 minutes.

I really liked this crust.  The beer taste is certainly there but not overwhelming.  I did have to add about 1/3 cup extra flour to the bread machine but otherwise was perfect.  I spread this out on a 10x15 sheet pan, baked at 400 degrees for 6 minutes, took out, lightly brushed with olive oil and then put on my toppings.  Baked for 17 minutes on the sheet pan and then slid the pizza right on to the oven rack.  Continued baking for about 6 more minutes.  Done perfectly and soooo crispy and tasty!  Thank you Kim for a great recipe.  My go-to for pizza now!

I found this recipe while looking for a thin crust. It did not turn out thin, though. I did like the recipe even though it wasn't especially thin. I added some fresh oregano to the  dough and parmesean on top of the sauce.

The pizza dough was perfect. I added garlic powder and oregano. It was pretty sticky once I took it out of the machine. It was fine once I kneaded it with some flour. Sadly I left the pizza in a little longer than I intended to (got distracted with the TV). Just added some butter to the crust and it softened up nicely.

FANTASTIC! Perfect flavor and texture. This was really easy to work with. I used a 14-1/2 inch pizza pan and I thought that worked out great. I will be using this pizza crust recipe often! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is the only bread machine pizza I make.  Bought a case of cheap beer just to have on hand for this.  However I add garlic powder to the flour.  Plus(since I'm an east coaster) I have to have a thinner crust, so I use a fork to prick the bread.   This stops it from raising too much.  Oh one more thing if you use olive oil on the pan, the crust will brown without having to transfer it directly to the rack.

Great tasting dough.  I used mine to make calzones.  Stuffed them with cheese and "toppings".  Brushed with an eggwash, sprinkled oregano and fresh shredded parmasean cheese on top.  Put in preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Fantastic!

Wow! I'm so excited to find this recipe. Thank you! I only made one small change - I used 2/3 cup beer and 1/3 cup of water. Not extra-beery at all, just a nice flavorful chewy pizza crust! I cooked on a preheated pizza stone and it only took 20 minutes. This is a keeper!

Result were outstanding. Used half wheat flour and half white bread flour plus sub instant yeast with 1 tablespoon of fresh yeast cake, just because I have it on the fridge. Let stand on fridge overnight. Brushed olive oil all over before spreading tomato to have a crunchier crust.

Used olive oil instead of butter. Baked on cookie sheet for 5 min before adding toppings, then put back into the oven for 15 min. Added frozen basil to the dough. Used Costco Pale Ale for beer.

I made two pizzas using this dough and it was so easy to use my bread machine dough setting.  A breeze and so much better tasting than a chain. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this pizza, just as the recipe instructed and it came out wonderful.  The dough is light and airy.  All around very delicious!!!  I’m excited to try this with different types of beer.  I poured the beer into a measuring cup, let it sit while I gathered the other ingredients, and put it into the bread machine.  It was not flat.  The dough still came out great.

I've used this recipe many times now, and with a 1/2 tsp more salt, it is perfect!  we grill it on the BBQ and the dough is beautiful to work with!  this was so easy!  the dough was really easy to handle and baked up really well.  I used olive oil instead of butter and I think next time I'll add some flavourings to mix things up.  This is a great and easy recipe as is!

This is a really good pizza dough recipe. We made both a large pizza and a small pizza and used our cast iron, rather than a pizza pan. It came out great, and I would recommend it to everyone. We also put some garlic season (after putting the oil on the dough) on the crust edges for an extra bit of flavor. Would recommend this to anyone as it's easy and tasty.

I liked this recipe because I thought it had a good texture. it was very much like the pizza we get from our local restaurants. When I took it out of the bread machine it was sticky, but when I coated it with a liberal amount of flour before rolling it out it was fine. next time I will roll it out thinner and add less toppings so the inside cooks more evenly with the crust, but thats my bad not the recipes. thanks.

So easy and so good! This is going to be our go to crust, it reminds us of our favorite brick oven pizza place, that is alas, in another city. I swaped out one cup of flour for wheat and it was great! One thing, low heat is the way to go since I burned the heck out of the first batch. It takes only two minutes to brown the first side!

I did not like at all.  I don't know what happened here....  I'm sticking to my old recipe.  I use the dough form the Italian Bread Wedges from this site.  I sub canola oil and use olive oil instead.  I did take the beer idea and use half cup beer with half cup water.  Put in my bread machine. After machine done spred out on my slightly greesed cookie sheet bake for about 8 to 10 mins.  Not quite golden brown but almost.  Took out, put on my toppings, put directly on oven rack for another 8 to 10 mins,,,, better than your local pizza shop. Yum.

LOVE this recipe!  I usually substitute 1/2 whole wheat flour, and add seasonings or herbs depending on my mood.  I sometimes even add a tablespoon or 2 of ground flax seed. I double the recipe and the bread machine handles it just fine.  YUM!  Thanks!

Excellent dough!!  I also added a mix of Italian seasoning for a little extra flavour.  I've even frozen the dough and it rolled out beautifully several weeks later.

Wonderful and easy, too!  Thank you for the advice on the reviews that recommended adding more flour, it made the texture of the dough turn out perfectly.  I also added fresh, finely chopped herbs and replaced the butter with olive oil.  The dough was rolled out to the size of a pizza stone, topped, and baked on the barbecue.  I've made this several times with rave reviews.

This dough was fantastic!!  I doubled the recipe to make two pizzas, no problem for the bread maker.  When the dough was done, it was the most silkiest well blended dough I've ever used for pizza.  It was very easy to roll out and work with.  I will use this recipe always!!

This is the perfect recipe if you like thick crust.  I baked half the dough and froze the other half.  I rolled the dough to about 1/3 inch thickness and it rose very well during baking.  Definitely bake 5 minutes before you add the toppings.  I added a tablespoon of rosemary (my favorite herb) and used Dos Equis beer although it was undetectable in the final product.  This was still a little bland like most crusts tend to be, so I think next time I'll add a garlic oil to the outer edge.

This dough turned out really well. I actually used it for a make your own personalized pizza party. I had to make several batches and they all turned out perfect without fail. I added different spices each time. It included garlic powder, italian seasonings, basil, thyme, etc. I had several compliments.

Made this with the "easy pizza sauce" from this site. It was really delish and easy! The only thing I didn't like was having to be proactive enough to remember to let my beer sit out to get flat. Will make again though!

Loved It!  Took others advice and added garlic powder and italian seasoning to the ingredients as well.  We also did half and half whole wheat and white flour.  Would highly recommend and I actually suggested to my husband that we just have crust for dinner instead of pizza--it smelled SO YUMMY!  Great recipe!

We love this dough!  It's become a once-a-week event now to do homemade pizza.  I've experimented using varying proportions of whole wheat and white flour, and I can't tell the difference, so I usually use all whole wheat flour now.  I double the recipe to make two large pizzas.  The doubling is almost more than my bread machine can handle though, and I've found I have to add the ingredients to the bread machine in layers and mix it up just a little before starting the dough cycle.  And if it rises for too long, it will push the lid of the bread machine open!  We roll the crust thin, and my husband's new trick is to put a layer of honey around the edges and roll the crust up (since the crust hangs off the side of the pizza stone anyway).  He says it's dinner and dessert in one!

This was by FAR the best pizza dough that I have ever made.  It was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  DELICIOUS!  I added a little sun dried tomato basil seasoning while my breadmaker was mixing and I also used bread flour.  Turned out PERFECT.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!  We like our pizza crust thin, so I was able to get two 12" pizza crusts from this recipe.  I used Bud Light which I whipped to make it flat.  It left no beer taste in the crust, as other reviewers had stated; perhaps because it's light.  I floured my hands to work with the dough.  It was very easy to work with.  I cooked the pizza on a stone for about 20 minutes.  I wish I had read the review that stated to use parchment paper to transfer to the stone.  I will definitely do that the next time to make it easier.  This is the best pizza crust we have ever tasted!

This was the most oustanding pizza recipe I have ever had.  This is what I did in addition.  I made the dough recipe with "guinness".  I put mozzarella on first, then,  fresh mushrooms,  followed by sweet vidalia onions and sweet italian sausage.  I topped the pizza with diced roasted tomato mixed with roasted garlic.  I will never use another dough recipe again.  This won me over.

This is the best pizza dough recipe I've tried so far.  I used it for a white pizza (roasted garlic and olive oil instead of sauce) with tomato slices and fresh basil.  I'll be adding some spices to the dough next time for a little more taste.

This was my first time making a pizza dough and this recipe was perfect because requires only a few ingredients. The kids had fun helping and they felt really proud once it was ready. Very good, next time I will add some garlic and oregano.

Nice pizza dough. Easy to work with. I did cook for 5 minutes before adding my toppings and then removed from my stone and cooked straight on the rack for the last 10 minutes or so. I also brushed the crust with olive oil and sprinkled with some pizza sea salt seasoning I had. I like the idea of letting my bread machine do the hard part for me:)

Perfect.  I used a 16X12 stoneware jellyroll pan and had PLENTY of dough.  We loved it. The taste was fantastic, and it cooked perfectly.  This is my new recipe. Thank you!  P.S. I also added a tablespoon of garlic powder... just personal preference, but I think this was tasty enough that it would have been a five star regardless.....  Thanks again!

Outstanding.  Have used 4 times this month.  Mods which improved: let rise one or two more times before using.  Add crushed garlic to olive oil and rub before coating.  Use 450 degree oven and shorten time if you need - found that with several toppings, about 22 minutes works well and gives nice crisp crust.

Excellent recipe ... I only used 2/3 cups of beer, so it didn't come out sticky at all ... and, I added a tablespoon of dried basil to the dough ... Wow! I also baked for 7 minutes before adding toppings, and brushed the edges of the crust with a parmesean-garlic butter ... this is the crust we will use from now on.

This has been my go to dough recipe for years now. I double the recipe to make two 16" pizzas. I use a pizza screen as I find it makes the crust crispier on the bottom. I also use this dough for calzone and runzas (it's a midwest thing). It's really easy to work with, even without flouring down the counter. I roll out to about a 10" circle, let it rest a few minutes, then roll out to 16" x 1/4" thick, no worries. I make pizza about 3-4 times a month with this recipe and never have any trouble at all. So easy!

The pizza came out great but instead of flat beer I sub with water, the recipe says 1 cup but actually need less than 1 cup. I let the machine mix and I slowly add water until is well blend. But the dough came out great.

I made a 12 inch thick crust pizza with this recipie and it turned out great!  I used Bud's American Ale, but I'm excited to try something more tasty next time, like Sam Adams! I whipped the beer to get the carb out, and that worked great!

I took the advice of other reviewers and added some garlic powder and dried herbs to the dough. I also prebaked the crust for 5 minutes. It came out great - nice and crispy. I will definitely make it again.

Truly the best! Everytime I try a new crust recipe I think that I have found "The One"....but this is it....for real this time! I used this with the "Chicago Style Stuffed Pizza" recipe and it was great. We usually make homemade pizza instead of ordering it so this will be a wonderful addition to the toppings!!!! Thank you!!!

I have tried several different pizza crust and they always seemed to be missing something or had an "off" taste but this one was the best yet. Most recipes have similar ingredients so it has to be the beer, who would've thought. I do have to admit I did add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic and some Italian seasoning for added flavor (personal preference) If you've been looking for a great crust, this is it, you won't be disappointed. Hubby agreed was the best we've had. I think my search is over.

OMG...one of the best pizza dough recipes ever! I was scared away from home made pizza until I tried this little recipe and I am a believer again. Baked on a stone and it came out fabulous!

This is the best pizza dough I have made yet.  I didn't have any sugar so I used light brown sugar.  It tasted great. This is my new favorite recipe!

This is the best pizza crust we have ever made. Even my kids who are very picky loved it. I did take other members advice and added garlic and italian seasoning. Turned out 5 star.

EXCELLENT.  This is the only recipe for us.  We make homemade pizza all the time now.  Use this dough and grate your own cheese.  You can't go wrong.

Yum!  I measured out a cup of beer, whipped it and let it sit for about 15 min so it would be flat.  I also added a tbsp of rosemary to the dry ingredients.  I thought it was really sticky coming out of the bread machine, so I added a little flour as I was patting it into a circle.  I don't have a pizza stone, so I baked it in a pizza pan for 15 min, flipped it over, put on toppings, and baked another 10 min.  It was great!

Worked very well.  It made enough dough to cover a cookie sheet and make a rectangle pizza.  Makes a nice thick crust.(which my kids like)Next time I think I will try to thin it out more for my husband and myself.

This was the best pizza dough recipe I have tried so far. I used honey instead of sugar, non-alcoholic beer and added garlic and basil.  I topped it with pizza sauce, mozzarella and fresh basil.  Yummy! Will definitely make again and again!

I had never had luck making homemade pizza crust before. It either didn't taste very good or had a weird texture. This was awesome! Chewy with just the right amount of crisp and taste was great! We only had Corona Extra beer and only had time for it sit about a hour. Definitely not flat, but still fabulous results. We made BBQ Chicken Pizza on it.

Excellent pizza dough recipe! Thanks for sharing it. Will be trying others, but this will definitely be a stardard of comparison. The dough cooked up perfectly. Great taste and texture like that of hand-tossed doughs. Cooked mine on a large pizza stone, bottom rack of the oven for about 18 minutes at the recommended temp. I lightly oiled the stone w/olive oil before spreading the crust; bottom of crust was perfect. Could taste the beer, but it wasn't overwhelming and the kids didn't comment on any "odd" taste at all. Well done.. this is a keeper.

The beer gives a good flavor to the crust, but it is so sticky it is super difficult to work with. I spread it in my pizza pan like icing. It stuck to my hands and got all over everything. Maybe because it was so humid today, but my husband loved it so much, I will make again.

This was an easy recipe to make though I found the dough to be too light and airy.  I would have preferred the airly without the light.  Not quite the texture for me.  Not bad for those who don't want a lot of condiments, more dough.

love it. You have to be sure the beer is flat! This is really good. If you like thin crust, you should make two pizzas from this one recipe.

WOW! Oh, my goodness! This crust is too good! I just can't get enough of that flavor. My husband was also impressed and he worked for pizza places for years when he was younger. This is just the recipe  we've been searching for. In my opinion it tastes better than any crust I've had and we order out a lot. I am so happy with it that we may never order out again- unless we are feeling very lazy :) But I just wanted to say thank you for this fabulous recipe.

Great recipe.  I found that i needed to increase the amount of flour to 2 3/4 cups for a less sticky dough.  It turns out perfect everytime.  thanks for the recipe.

My husband and kids loved it.
I make the dough in the morning and refrigerate it until we get home.  It bakes up great.

This pizza crust had an amazing flavor! I used Sam Adams Winter Brew and about 3 cups of flour. Next time I will either make a much larger pizza or cut down the recipe because it came out a little too thick for my taste. My pizza was about 11 or 12 inches in diameter and 3/4 inch thick. I baked on a pizza stone at 450 for about 10 minutes and it came out nice and crispy on the edges. Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW!! i've made my own pizza for years, then i tried this and it was the BEST! i don't like beer but to me it didn't taste "beerish" smelled awesome through the house. i did use about 3 cups of flour, added a little pizza seasoning. i also baked on a stone at 450 for about 10 to 12 minutes. shut oven off and let sit for a while. I'LL DEFINATELY KEEP THIS AND USE WHENEVER I GOT A FLAT BEER THE BOYFRIEND LEAVES IN FRIDGE...YUMMY!

I made this dough using Blue Moon. It made a very nice thick crust with a good texture and flavor. Surprisingly, the pizza was even better cold as the beer flavor in the crust was more pronounced. I had to scale back the cooking time by about 6-8 minutes, but that seems more like oven variation than a bad recipe.

I really liked the flavor of this crust!  I used Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, tasted good.  Only change I made was to add about a 1/4 cup flour, as it was a bit sticky.  Will use this recipe again, Thanks!

Amazing. We’ve always purchased the Whole Foods pizza dough and it was “OK”. This was amazing. I used an IPA for the beer, live at 7300’ altitude and didn’t change a thing. We even brushed the crust once with garlic and olive oil. Another time we just dipped the delicious dough in honey. The crust turns a great golden color and kids love it. Thanks!

Amazing; best I’ve ever had. I used a freshly opened beer (not flat) & added garlic powder. It was just as great Reheated the next day; I think that the butter really helps differentiate this from other pizza dough recipes.? Thank you!

This is a good recipe . Like others suggested, I added garlic and oregano to the dough . I had to add a little extra flour because the dough was sticky. I will be keeping and using this recipe again

Holy moly!!!!!  I use this dough to make cheesy breadsticks with Italian seasoning.  I use cheddar jack cheese cubes and shredded mozzarella along with olive oil to coat the dough and a sprinkle of salt.

this, I believe, is the most amazing pizza dough recipe I think I've ever made in my life!!!!

I did not use flat beer because beer does not get to go flat in my home. 

You have GOT to try this recipe it's amazing!!!

I made it using a pizza oven, the dough never cooked through with very minimal toppings, just some mushrooms, light sauce and cheese. When the cheese was turning darker browin in spots and had to be removed from oven I found the dough to be, well, doughy. Apparently this dough needs to be pre-baked, not impressed

Great recipe! I used Landshark Lager which gave the dough a great flavor. Definitely use a beer you like. Our pizza had a nice soft crust, which I love. I baked it on a perforated pizza pan for 20 minutes because the cheese was over done. Next time I would pre-bake the crust for a few minutes and then put the toppings on. Paired this recipe with the Exquisite pizza sauce from this site. Wonderful combination!

We love this pizza crust! I follow directions but throw some fresh basil and oregano into the bread machine for added flavor. I also prebake crust for 5 minutes before adding toppings so it doesn’t get soggy

I made this recipe for my grandson's birthday party. It is the best pizza dough I have ever made- I doubled the recipe to make one extra large and one regular pizzas and the dough was easy to work with and so soft. The only change I made was I used flattened Gingerrale in place of the beer as we don't have beer in the house but it worked perfect. I would highly recommend.

Really good pizza crust, I used it for personal pan pizzas baked on pre-heated pans for about 10 min on 475F and they turned out great, a nice crunch on the bottom with a flavourful, fluffy crust. This is my new go-to pizza crust!

Honestly, the flavor is awesome just as the recipe is written, still, I can’t wait to experiment with different spices. Next time, I will  bake it for 5 minutes before adding ingredients. I also plan to use the crust for calzones!

I've made this recipe twice, the first time as written.  I thought the crust browned way too much by the time the center was cooked, also it made a generous amount of dough, too much IMO for one large pizza.  By large, I mean it was too much for a very large cookie sheet that easily fits 16 cookies.  The second time I used olive oil in place of the butter so it wouldn't brown so fast and made 3/4 of the recipe and it came out perfect.  I also added herbs, a bit more salt and less sugar.  I agree that the beer doesn't need to be flat, just needs to be room temperature.  A good recipe that just needed some small changes to be more to my taste.  If you use the butter, just be careful of the time and maybe make two smaller pizzas so the center doesn't take so long to cook.  I didn't think it tasted too much like beer.

I was a little afraid because it never did rise, but it still turned out great. I did add 'couple of shakes' of crushed red pepper flakes to add some more flavor. Will be making this again !

We made a really delicious pizza! We put lots of  salami in it. Next time we could add some shrimp and spice in it.  This time I made it like focaccia, and I think we put little bit more oil. So the bread looks wet. However, it is a very good recipe. Next time we could do better.

Awesome recipe! Add cheese to the crust and cook for five mins without toppings and then add toppings and 15-20 more mins in oven. Adding butter to the pan before adding toppings then taking pan off pizza for the last five mins makes  crispy buttery crust! Mmmmmmmm

I absolutely love this recipe.  I did as some others and added a teaspoon of garlic powder.  It looked pretty wet when the machine started kneading so I dusted it with a little more flour and it cleaned right up.  I pressed it out on a pizza pan with a piece of parchment on top.  I slid it off the pan with the parchment and cooked it on a pizza stone.  Just the perfect amount of crunch and chew.  YUM!

This dough was amazing. 1st time using the dough setting on the bread maker. I followed the directions to the T. I used a pizza sauce I found on here. And I made the pizza on my pizzazz pizza machine.  Next time I'll add some Italian seasoning to the dough.

I made this twice now and my family love it.  I did what a few of the other individuals who made this dough by putting it to cook for about 10mins and then put the toppings on and bake for about another 15-20mins.

1/30/2017 Best pizza dough ever. I proofed my yeast since I don't have a bread machine.  I mixed it using my Kitchen Aid mixer.  The beer, along with garlic powder and Italian seasons makes it great. I do prebake for 5 minutes and cool before topping and returning to oven.  I made two pizzas with it because we like them thin.  One ham and onion and one with pepperoni and mushroom.  Delicious, thanks for the recipe. I loved the tips from other posters about drying out the toppings by microwave.  I put each in for a minute, and the final pizza had the yummy pepperoni that had crispy edges. Yum! Update 11/25/17 I bake my pizzas using Chef John's method and they turn out fantastic.  After putting mushroom and pepperoni in the microwave long enough to absorb water, I use them to top my pizza.  I heat my pizza stone in the bottom of my oven at 500 degrees and bake my pizza about 7 minutes.  They come out real pizzeria style, using this dough.

This is by far the best pizza dough.  It is tender and chewy, yet it cuts easily with no tugging.  I won't be making any other dough in the future.

Excellent crust for pizza or calzones. I put 2 tsp Italian seasoning in and brush the edges with olive oil. My favorite pizza joint doesn't come close.

Perfect pizza dough IF you use it within a couple of days and don't freeze. I unthawed a ball yesterday, made the pizza as usual but the crust did not rise and stayed moist, like it was uncooked. Same temp and time as usual.

I joined the site (finally) just so I could rate this recipe.  I am not using hyperbole when I declare that this is the easiest, most flavorful, and best *texture* and rising properties of any pizza dough I've ever made.  No more take out!  I luuuuuuuuuu-dis pizza dough!!!  The possibilities are endless! Cheers!  -- update:  I tried to put in Parmesan reggiano (sp) but it killed the (poor) yeasts -- lol.  I would super-highly recommend to do a chiffonade (sp) of  fresh basil and add a lot as it makes it really bright and wonderful.  Also, I leave it in the bread machine to "proof" for an extended amount of time (ie: several hours).  It will quadruple in size and comes out better, I think...aa

Love it. We have made pizza and used the dough for breadsticks. I brushed with butter and garlic powder for added flavor. I have made in bread machine and with stand mixer. Used dough hook for 10 minutes on low. Just as good. Unfortunately, my bread maker broke.

Made this recipe by the directions except for one change. My bread maker was not mixing the dough properly so I moved it to my Kitchen Aid mixer and mixed it with the dough hook for approximately 15 minutes.  Then, as noted in a previous review, I let the dough rise in a warm place for 30 minutes in a bowl that had been sprayed with cooking spray and covered with a damp towel. This dough was excellent, easy to work with, and my family loved this pizza. We will definitely make this again - thanks for sharing!

Best pizza crust ever!  I did add 1 tsp each of dried basil and garlic powder to the dough mix.  Brushed my baking stone and pizza crust with a thin coating of olive oil and baked crust for 5 minutes and then added toppings.  Added 2 tbls. of olive oil instead of butter and only 1 tblsp  of sugar.  And baked at 375

So I made a double batch, using my stand mixer, and it was too dry, so I added more beer, then it was too wet, so I added in some flour til it was the right consistency, and stuck it in the oven to rise.  I doubled everything.  I was hopeful that the extra beer and flour wouldn't muck it up, and it didn't!  We made personal pizzas, which I KNEW would need a shorter time, but I got on the computer, and forgot all about them, so the smell "woke me up" to their being done...well, overdone by a bit.  I have no idea how long it cooked, I had set the timer for 15 min, intending to check them, and well, it was done.  The pizzas were still REALLY good though, and the dough...oh wow.  Hint of sweetness, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  Just like you expect pizza dough to taste (well, that's how I expect pizza dough to taste, anyway.)  Flavor and texture get a huge thumbs up.  The other mistake I made personally was not rolling it thin enough...they PUFFED up in the oven!  Still, since they got over baked, I cannot complain, the thickness probably saved my pizza.  I've started a second batch, and I've realized that I can double the batch in the bread machine, so this time decided to do it that way instead.  Since my beer wasn't flat, I microwaved it for 1 min (did that with the first batch too, which I think worked out really well for getting the yeast started), so we'll see how the second batch comes out of the machine.  With the first batch, I chunked up the butter, but t

Made this for the first time.  The only thing I changed was that I used 2 cups bread flour and 1 cup semolina flour.   The beer added just the right flavor.  Everyone loved it!  I've searched and searched for a good pizza dough recipe, and this will definitely be my go to recipe!

A great standard pizza crust.  I do not let the crust rise after I have taken it out of the bread machine.  If it rises, I think it is too fluffy.  If you don't let it rise, it gives the crust a great chewy quality.

This is my favorite pizza dough recipe. The beer gives the dough a sour dough-y taste. It's great! I add 2 tsp of garlic powder in with the mix. And bake the dough before a little before I put any toppings on my pizza. I always have left over dough and use it to make bread stick, just roll little strips and brush with some garlic butter and sprinkle on some Parmesan cheese. They taste great!

I made this for the first time and the family loved it. said it was better than delivery pizza. The only thing I did different was, once I got the dough ready for sauce I sprinkled shredded mozzarella around the edges and some crumbled bacon, then I rolled the crust over in order to make a bacon and cheese stuffed crust. It was awesome.

This pizza dough is wonderful. It takes a while to make so I like to pop it all in around noon (so when it is done it can rise) and forget about it until dinner. I always like to bake my pizza crusts for about 5 minutes before I put on the toppings, makes it crispier!

Great recipe, though I think beer selection changes things a LOT.  

I used guinness, and the dough came out of the bread machine way too runny and sticky.  I worked in about another 3/4 cup of flour, which did the trick.  I also took the opportunity to work in roughly half a tsp of basil and a tsp or so of rosemary, which added nice aroma.

Cooking time also way too high, though.  By the 15 minute mark, pizza was already crispy/tough.  Estimate 10-12 minutes cook time for this variation.

Nutshell:

Used guinness for beer, added 1/2 tsp Basil, 1 tsp Rosemary, added approx 3/4 cup flour, cut cooking time in half.

This is absolutely amazing! It bakes up light and airy, but perfect for a pizza crust! It has a great flavor, I couldn't even detect any beer flavor at all! It was also super easy to work with - which is always a huge factor for me in a pizza dough! Quick and easy, super great pizza dough recipe!

I use this recipe in my bread machine every time I make homemade pizza.  It's awesome.  I have a beer-tender in the kitchen usually with a keg of Newcastle hooked up.  It's so easy to pour a cup and let it sit on the counter and wait for the carbonation to subside.  I love the way this dough rises.  It's silky but not sticky.  Once I even fell asleep when the machine had finished and the dough had risen quite nicely a few hours later.  Not a problem as I made a couple dough balls, wrapped in saran wrap and then placed in freezer bags.  When it's time to make the pizza, I just take one of the freezer bags out and place in the fridge and let it defrost and slow rise while I'm at work. It's ready by the time I come home!  Simple and tasty.

Best homemade pizza crust I have made.  The whole family liked it!  Myhusband told me that usually he doesn't really care for homemade pizza because the crust is never tasty enough, but this one was better than most restaurant pizza.  I took a previous poster's advice and baked for a few minutes without toppings to make the crust crispier.

I have tried a few different versions of pizza dough for the bread machine but this one tops them all.  We used a micro-brewery beer called Crafty Jack which is a nice dark ale and the crust was as delicious as the toppings! The dough was easy to work with.  This is most definitely a keeper and my "go to" pizza dough recipe from now on!  Thank you for sharing it!

This is a great recipe! I have no need to buy dough in the supermarket. The only thing I did differently is to add the yeast to the sugar and water and let it get frothy before adding it to the other ingredients. Then I let the dough rise once, then gave it about 10 minutes before I began spreading it into the pan. This was the first time I ever made pizza dough and this was excellent.

I have made this several times and it comes out very well.  if you like your crust crispy cook at 500 for 5 min then dress your pizza and put back in oven for a few minutes.

Very yummy!  I used a 13" by 18" rectangle pan and it was still very thick.  I substituted 2 1/2 T. of vital wheat gluten for a an equal amount of the flour.  Melted butter and added 1t. of water, 2t. of fresh dried basil, 2t. of fresh dried oregano and 1T. of moist minced garlic out of a jar.  I warmed the beer, sugar and salt to 110 degrees, sprinkled the active dry yeast on top and let sit for five minutes.  Put flour mixture, then butter mixture, then yeast mixture and selected the dough cycle.  Oiled the pan rolled it out carefully with oiled rolling pin, let rise for 15 to 20 minutes on proof setting on my oven.  Cooked crust for 10 minutes, added original Ragu for sauce, roasted fresh green chili, microwaved pepperoni on papertowels (to remove some of the grease) cooked topped pizza for about 8 minutes, then added a preshredded mexican cheese mixture and cooked for another 6 minutes.  I don't drink and I couldn't taste the beer.  Best pizza I have made or eaten!

GREAT flavor!  Reminded me of a nice pizza restaurant!  Other than being a little thick in places (making it hard for my 6-year-old-with-a-mouthful-of-loose-teeth to chew), it was SO good, and will definitely be added to my "Tried & True" list.

I was a bit worried because I've never made pizza before, I'm not an experienced cook, and I've only tried my bread machine a couple of times.  But this turned out wonderfully! I didn't have flat beer, but I poured a cup of Miller Genuine Draft and stirred it up a bit to get rid of some bubbles.  I pre-baked the dough for 5 minutes as others had recommended, brushed with olive oil.  It's a very tasty crust, and I don't plan on ordering out ever again!

I made these pizza yesterday for a party and got rave reviews.  Everyone loved the crust.  We made BBQ chicken, Buffalo Chicken, chicken bacon Ranch and pepperoni.  All tasted just like it came fro the local pizza shop.  Thanks for a great recipe, we will definitely be making again and again!

Great taste, and didn't rise like crazy which is one of the things I hate about regular pizza dough.  Great idea to mix the garlic and basil right into the dough.  Combine this with the exquisite pizza sauce recipe!

Amazing Pizza Crust!  Exactly what I was looking for in a dough!  Crisp on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  The only tweak I did was bake it at 500.  Baked up in just a few minutes.  I am so excited about this recipe, I am seriously contemplating not buying takeout pizza lol

Not all beer works for this recipe. The first time I made this it was fantastic. I tried a different beer after that and it was a gooey mess. We couldn't use it. Not sure what the difference in the beer was.
UPDATE: Duh! Ok, it's not the beer that's the problem! First I put 1/4 c of water in the bread pan, then add the yeast and sugar. I wait about 5 minutes and add all other ingredients ( but only 3/4 c of beer.) haven't had any issues!

Awesome dough base...
Like several others, I "tweeked" the recipe a bit.  I took suggestions of adding basil and oregano (3/4 tbsp).  I also added a bit of parmesan cheese (1/4 c).  The beer used was DosEquis at 110degrees stirred until flat.  My dough looked very sticky/wet, so I added about 1/4 more flour.  I stopped the bread machine ~30 minutes early and re-started the kneading process.  When the cycle was complete I put it in the refrigerator...I was baking it for my kids' lunch for the next day.  This was the best thing I could have done.  The dough was so easy to work!! The taste is amazing!!  Thank you so much Kim!  I debated on several dough recipes before deciding on this one.  Boy!  Am I ever glad this is the one I picked!!!

This crust is amazing!  I didn't use beer, I used water.  I also added 1 tsp of garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  I will try adding more next time for a better flavor.  Also some Parm.  
I baked my crust for 5-8 minutes til just turning golden brown and then added my toppings.  My son also put in string cheese for a little stuffed crust action!  Delicious!

Came out of the bread maker pretty sticky but like any dough humidity can affect how much flour you need. Also didn't have any beer so just used water. At first I wasn't sure I liked it because it came out fluffy and pretty soft. I generally like a thin crispy crust but my husband and I both agreed we really like it and with the bread maker doing all the work we will be making pizza A LOT more!!! Thanks so much.

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! Put all ingredients in my bread machine and walk away for an hour! I add a tablespoon of italian seasoning in the dough instead of the sauce, it's amazing!

This dough was so easy and tasty. After flattening, I stuffed the crust with string cheese and wrapped the dough around. Another tip--use a fork to poke holes in the dough all around to avoid bubbles in the crust.

This recipe was really easy to use in the bread machine.  It was really tasty -not too crispy or too thick.  It was very sticky and hard to put on the pizza pan, but I got it done and followed the advice of pre cooking for about 7 min and then I added all of my toppings.  The pizza felt like it weighed about 10lbs when I was done with the toppings.  It was amazing.  I used Pastorelli pizza sauce, singed the pepperonies and then almost died and went to pizza heaven because I ate so much.  I also threw in a little bit of basil and some Italian spices to the dough.

This recipe was great, possibly even better the next day!  I used a blonde ale.  The only problem I ran into was that the dough was WAY too sticky when made as written.  I ended up adding another 1 1/2 C of flour and kneading by hand quit a bit after the bread maker finished.  Next time I use this recipe I will try making a BBQ chicken pizza with sharp cheddar & bell peppers.

I made a bunch of "personal sized" crusts for a 10yr old birthday party.  I baked them on parchment paper and let them cool.  When party time came, the kids added their own toppings.  It was a great hit.

We tired of our other favorite pizza crust so we tried this one.  My family and I LOVED it! Not too thick or too thin.  Very flaky and crunchy.  This one is my new favorite!  I added fresh cut rosemary but followed the directions otherwise.

Good with whole wheat, all purpose, or a mix! I bake the crust a bit on on a lower temp first, otherwise it can be a little doughy.

This is the best and easiest to use pizza dough that I’ve tried. I used half white whole wheat and half all-purpose flours and also added an extra ¼ tsp. of yeast. I ended up with a tasty, chewy crust that held all my ingredients without leaking. It was neither too tough to chew nor too airy. Like Baby Bear, it was just right. Love it!

This is now my ONLY pizza/calzone/bread stick dough recipe. The outside is slightly crunchy and the inside is wonderfully soft. The flavor is much like sour dough bread without the fuss of the starter. We are bread eaters and I make mine from scratch most of the time. I threw out all other pizza dough recipes after trying this one. It needs no "tweaking". Definitely a keeper!!!

Followed the previous suggestions:  1/2 teaspoons of salt  2 teaspoons of yeast  3 tablespoons of white sugar  It was my first time ever making bread and it was delicious alongside my beef stew.

Ohhh My!!!! Wonder full pizza! full of flavor and the crust was perfect! not to big and not to soggy. I did what a reviewer suggested and placed the crust in the oven for 5 mins before topping and for 3 mins on the wire rack towards the end. (added asparagus, tomatoes,green bell pepper and pepperoni on half.) Delicious will make again soon! Will possibly start a pizza night with this recipe!! Thanks for posting it!

UN-BELIEVABLY GOOD. I tried this dough for the first time last night and decided to go all out by GRILLING the pizza instead of baking it. Let me tell you, I took the risk with a new dough using a new method and it paid off BIG TIME. This is what I did: Turned off the machine once it was done mixing and let the dough rise intil x3 times its original size (about 30-45 mijn). Turned the machine back on on dough cycle only for a few seconds just to punch it down, turned it off and let it rise again (the rising really didn't take long because I used instant, maybe another 30 min). Dumped it onto a flowered surface and divided the dough into 4 portions and rolled them out to make individual pizzas. I brushed one side liberally with olive oil and put the pizzas (one at a time) on the grill oil side down. Let it cook until the bottom has nice grill marks, flip to cook the other side; flip again and dress your pizza, allow the bottom to get nice and crusty. I have a cuisinart panini press/grill, so I was able to cook the top of the pizza "panini" style and it came out PERFECT. No, it didn't stick. I never thought I would make a pizza with grill marks on the pepperoni! It was cerispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, amazing...

I've tried many homemade pizza dough recipes and this one is by far the best. If you like your crust crispy, all you need to do is pre-bake the crust for 10 minutes, add your toppings, and continue baking for another 10-14 minutes. Excellent!

This was excellent!! I was worried... my dough was sticky and not easy to work with. I was hoping to put it right on the pizza stone. However, that wasn't going to happen, so I put it into a large cookie sheet. YUM!     I cooked it for about 7 minutes, pulled it out and put on olive oil and my toppings. Then, I cooked another 17 minutes. It came out perfect.    p.s. I used Molson Canadian.

what a great pizza dough!! I have made this 4 times now and each time it is the best pizza dough I have ever tasted. I have made double batches and froze them. Same great taste either fresh or frozen. My family likes it better that delivery!! While helping my daughter and family move into a new house, I made it for them and they loved it, even the picky grandchildren...

This is a great dough!!  Based on some of the other reviews, I added about a tsp of dried basil and 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  The crust was soft, but not too thick and just the right amount of flavor.  Definitely my new go-to pizza crust!

My family loved this dough! I did add 1 T Italian Seasoning and 1 1/2 t. garlic powder on top of the flour before mixing. We used this dough to make calzones for the first time and everyone commented how good this dough was. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was an unbelievably tasty crust.  My husband loved it.  I added 1 T Italian seasoning, 1 tsp garlic salt and substituted half the bread flour with whole wheat flour, and the flavor was perfect.  This is my new pizza crust!

We  loved it!  I baked it in a 16x14 pan.  Like others have said I baked the crust first for about 10 minutes, then top and bake for another 18-20.  I think I may stuff the crust next time!

Dead simple to make, very tasty, and I suspect this is a great start for doing crusts with more seasonings and ingredients. The 1 pizza yield version of this recipe was perfect for two 12" diameter pizzas with a medium crust thickness. Delicious.

First time I made this and thought it was pretty good.  I think it is too much dough for a pizza pan.  Like others two thin pizzas would be better.  Next time I think I will try it on a pizza stone.  Agreed this is a somewhat sticky dough but it only needs a little more flour when you spread the dough out.      The outside crust was crispy and chewy but the inside was a little too dense for my liking but again too much dough for the pan.  I would think this would be excellent for focaccia.    All in all probably the best pizza dough I have made.  Oh and I do not think it tastes bitter from the beer. I used Miller Lite.

An excellent dough! We used this for panzarottis and it was delicious! I did not add any extra spices, just made it as the recipe stated. It had a great texture and baked nice and soft. This is definitely my new recipe for pizza dough.

This is a fabulous pizza crust recipe- I did add over a cup of flour. DH loved it- told me it was the best homemade pizza he ever had. I did prebake 5 minutes before topping. I would divide it next time or make it into a sheet pizza. A Keeper!!

So Easy & The kids had a blast making their own mini pizzas ( I divided the dough into three portions) I also used Milk because I wasn't sure the kids would enjoy the beer flavor. My husband loved it as well but requested the beer flavoring for his, as he thought it was a little to sweet. Overall, Easy & Quick. Great.

I guess it's not fair for me to mark this down at all since I suspect I might not like herbs in my pizza crust.  The consistency was good, however, and the pie did come out looking nice.

Very good! I don't know if it's my bread machine, but my husband and i always have to add extra flour afterwards. Looking at the reviews, i believe that is true as mostly everyone says the measurements are just right. I like to add 1 to 2 tablespoons of rosemary when adding the dry ingredients. It gives it a subtle wonderful taste. I also took the suggestions of others of putting the pizza in for five minutes, adding the toppings, and then putting it back in the oven. Delicious!

Quoting my daughter and her friends "Viff if bedda ven papa murvvees!!!"  This was said with full mouths, that led to very happy tummies.  Easy to 'adult up' with herbs and garlic.  I have found after several batches of this that the beer taste can really come thru if you use strong beer.  Also, if you use brown sugar, it turns out very sweet tasting.

This is by far the best pizza dough ever.  We like thin crust pizza, so I only used ½ of the dough and froze the rest to use later.  Yummy.

This didn't work well for me.  It was stickier than other pizza doughs I've made but still workable.  I used half whole wheat and half all purpas flours.  Cooked it on a pizza stone for about 20 minutes and the bottom and edges were burned.  Also I think my daughter is allergic to the beer (she had a body rash for 2-3 days and no other explanation for it).  Won't make again mostly because of the rash and I like other crusts better.

The dough was prefect. I used the bread machine only on the knead cycle whch was for 20 minutes. I followed some of the other reviews and added 1tsp each of basil and garlic powder. Once the kneading was finished I rolled the dough into a ball and placed it in a greased bowl covered with oiled sran wrap and towel over the top and placed it in a slightly warmed oven. After 30 minutes of rising the dough I punch it down and tossed to form the pizza pie.

Waste of time.  Dough was too sticky.  Neither flour nor oil helped.  The dough just tore.

I followed the recipe exactly and when it was time to take it out of the bread machine, it was soooo sticky I couldn't even pick it up. I ended up adding about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of extra flour.  The dough tasted good, but it was so much trouble and big mess!

This pizza dough was pretty good, it was a little harder to handle than my usual pizza dough but the taste made up for it, nice and crispy. Thanks for the recipe

This makes a great crust!! I have made this twice, once and written and it was really good. The second time I added some italian seasoning and garlic powder and that was great too. both time I did increase the flour by 1/4 cup, otherwise it could be too sticky. Thanks for sharing such a versitile recipe!!

I have been making homemade pizza every Friday for the last 15 years.   The flavor and aroma of this crust is heavenly.  It comes out of the machine slightly sticky, so I knead with a touch of flour.  The flavor is wonderful.  And I have never had such a perfectly crispy pizza crust before.  Thank you!

I finaly found a pizza dough my husband likes.  Homemade pizza is back in the rotation.  I like to make a pan style crust and cook it about 15 min. so it is not too crispy.  It is great!

This is very good pizza dough.  My daughter who is the crust expert around here gave it 10 stars.  I'm not sure I'm that in to it to acurately give it a number, but I thought it was good.  I was worried about the "flat beer" because of course I decide to make the dough and who has a cup of flat beer hanging around their house?  I poured it in the cup and beat it with a spoon for a while and it was warm beer so I figured I wouldn't drink it warm or flat so maybe it would work!  Was it flat?  Don't think so, but I went with it and the dough was fine.  Made 2 crusts.  It cooked on a stone way faster than 24 minutes, in fact, it was done in about 12 so watch the dough.  Thanks for sharing kim.  I'm sure I'll make this again.

I have finally found the pizza crust I have been looking for!!!  Thank you!!!  I added some seasoning to the dough and cooked it for 10 minutes before topping it.  This was so good and my sister was begging for the recipe, always a good sign since she doesn't get too excited about things other than salad.  I used miller lite for the beer since we like that one best when I make beer bread.

I'm giving this three stars because me and my daughter did not care for the taste at all! Otherwise, the recipe was simple, easy and worked wonderfully. Used a flat Miller Light and felt like I was eating beer. I guess if you like beer this is the one for you. Might try again for my boyfriends pizza, but for me...No. Thanks anyway.

Wow, what a fabulous crust!  I made it exactly as written and it was delicious!  Great thickness and not too crispy or too chewy.  I topped it with Gourmet Chicken Pizza from this site and boy was it awesome!

This was a little too "doughy" for me.  that's more an indication of my preference for NY style pizza than a reflection on the recipe, probably.
