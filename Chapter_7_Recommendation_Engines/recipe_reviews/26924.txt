I made this as listed, and it was very good.  I think making the changes other reviewers suggested will make it a 5 star dish.  I will add taco seasoning to the chicken next time, as it could use a little more kick.  I also like the idea of adding black beans and corn to the mixture, to make it a little more substantial and get some extra veggies into my kids at the same time.  Heating the chips first for 5 minutes would help keep them crisp too.

I have made this recipe literally dozens of times since discovering it, in multiple ways, and I believe I have tweaked it enough to get the perfect nacho recipe! As is, this recipe gets 4 stars. The chicken mixture is a little bland, and I prefer more toppings (olives, jalapenos, etc.) on my nachos. 

My tips and changes for the perfect chicken nachos (according to my tastes, at least):

1. Use rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, or cook your own chicken breast first. Do NOT use canned chicken or the pre-cooked, packaged chicken chunks! They give it a weird flavour and don't shred as nicely.

2. Shred, don't chop, the chicken. It's so much smoother and melt-in-your-mouth-y this way.

3. Add taco seasoning (or your own blend of spices) to the onions while you saute them. Use a lot so it coats the chicken when you add it.

4. Along with the chicken, stir in some rinsed canned black beans and some frozen corn kernels (don't need to thaw). Don't use a "southwestern-style" salsa that has these ingredients included, as I found that it didn't provide the texture contrast you get from using canned beans or the bites of sweetness you get from frozen corn.

5. Pre-bake the tortilla chips ~5min before adding the chicken mixture so the chips stay crispy.

6. Add more toppings! I add sliced black olives and lots of sliced jalapenos along with the tomatoes. Sometimes I will also toss on some diced green or red bell pepper for crunch.

Serve with sour cream for the perfect nachos!

This recipe is awesome!!!!  My husband loved it...so did the kids!  I used  Kirkland Signature Premium Chunk (Costco brand)canned Chicken Breast (12.5oz can) It really worked out well.  I also used shredded cheddar and mozzerella cheese, cause that's what I had in the house!  Next time I will try adding refried beans, black olives, and jalapeno peppers to add a little spice!  I already have my family hounding me to make it again!  Very easy to make.  Recommend you try this one first!

Mmmmmmm, nachos are the best! I used ground turkey in this recipe along with a can of black beans, cumin, jalapeno peppers and garlic and onion powders. In addition to the shredded cheeses I decided to go all the way and also make a cheese sauce using cheddar and pepper jack. I don't like soggy nachos, so I baked the chips by themselves to really crisp them up and then put the meat mixture on top added the cheese and served.  This is the FIRST time I've ever seen hubby eat nachos. Delicious Laura!

This was simply excellent!!  I used the advice to warm the chips before adding the chicken mixture.  I purchased the Tostitos Gold chips because they are thicker and it worked out very well.  After cooking the chicken I added a taco mix for more kick and used a mixture of mild and medium salsa.  I used montery pepper jack cheese and some cheddar.  I added black olives for flavor and color.  All my friends raved and wanted the recipe!  I even saved a small plate for the next day and it was still delicious warmed up in the oven.  Thanks for a recipe I will use often!

These were really, really, really good!  They really did taste like they were from a restaurant.  I seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning, added some refried beans and served with sour cream!  My hubby and I ate them for a meal!

Amazing recipe!  I cubed the chicken instead of shredding it (just a personal preference) and also added 1/4 of a bag McCormick Mild Taco Seasoning Mix.  Jalapeno peppers, diced green chiles, and pepper-jack as well as cheddar cheese completed it!  I also warmed the chips prior to baking with the chicken/cheese mixture.  I also make my own salsa, and it is a perfect addition to this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!  Extra Note:  The way I make these are for spicy lovers!  They are super hot and super good!!!

I give this 5 stars because it was extremely easy to make, had a yummy taste as is,
and allows you to make lots of changes/additions.  I added some extra seasonings to the chicken,
I sprinkled some paprika, garlic powder and just a hint of chile pepper in addition to
the salt and pepper.  In the future I was thinking of adding lots more chicken, maybe even some 
beans and maybe corn.  Regardless, I really liked this recipe, had a wonderful taste. Will
definitely make again.

Good recipe, but not worth 5 Stars because so many changes are needed.  First thing, cover the baking sheet with foil and spray with Pam for easier serving and clean-up.  Rather than season the chicken,  I addes taco mix to refried beans (heated).  Used Organic chips with added flax (healthier and more fiber), first layer, a light dusting of cheese to keep chips from getting soggy, then warmed chicken, then drop warmed beans by spoonful all over, then sprinkled with corn (adds texture and a touch of sweetness) and more shredded cheese.  Because everything has been pre-heated, you can put in broiler for 1-2 min.  this will lightly toast the chips and keep everything from being soggy.  I pull the foil right off the sheet and put on a platter and dollop with salsa, chopped avocado or guacamole and sour cream to make it special.  Serve with a side of limes to squeeze on top if wanted and caesar salad for a nice meal.

Like everyone else says about this recipe - besides being versatil for a variety of different peoples tastes in food, it's easy & tasty!  The first time I made this dish it was a little dry.  Today it was great!  Be sure you don't put it in too large of a baking pan.  I used a pyrex 10" pie plate the second time.  Thanks "good cook" Laura!

Really tasty!  I served it with sour cream and guacamole on the side and everyone loved it!  I wasn't sure it would feed all four of us, so I made Mexican rice as a side dish.  I'll definitely make this again!

This is one of our favorite quick snacks/meals. If I have it on hand, I'll use leftover chicken taco filling or even leftover chicken fajita filling from the night before. I like to use homemade salsa and sometimes, I'll add a layer of homemade refried beans. I serve this with dollops of sour cream. Pure comfort food.

Super Good!  Left out the chicken (vegetarian son), added some left over Best Black Beans from this site, used a mix of salsa & left over canned diced tomatoes with green chiles, topped with sour cream, black olives, and chives!  Chips weren't soggy at all & everyone loved it!  I made 5 individual servings in 5 different small glass baking dishes because I didn't have 1 dish big enough for all of us.  Worked out perfectly & was easy to serve.

Mmmm.... These are soooo yummy (and EASY to prepare too!)!!! I've been baking Christmas cookies all day. I didn't want to spend even MORE time in the kitchen preparing dinner, but was still hungry for a "real" meal (I've been noshing on sweets all day and knew I needed something a bit more substantial than "junk food" for dinner lol!). Not only were these tasty, they were a cinch to put together. As many reviewer's have suggested, I too warmed my tortilla chips for a few minutes to ensure they would remain crisp when I added my toppings. This worked really well (thanks for the tip!). To add a little holiday "jolly," I purchased red / green tortilla chips. :) To speed prep (like I really needed to...), I shredded a rotisserie chicken. Obviously, I didn't use all of it, so I am saving some for chicken enchilada soup next week. I added about a T of Lawry's chicken taco seasoning to my meat and think this added a nice kick. And instead of adding my green onion tops as garnish, I sprinkled my nachos with them and baked as directed. It took exactly 10 minutes for my cheese (colby-jack blend) to melt thoroughly. Served with fresh pico de gallo and guacamole, these were REALLY delicious. Thanks for sharing your idea, Laura! :-)

Great starter recipe...I chose this one because it called for shredded cheese & not processed cheese like most other nacho recipes. I made it just for me to eat, so I cut it down a bit and just eyeballed everything. I did add a bit of taco seasoning to the chicken mixture. Next time will add beans etc. Someone recommended making it in a pie pan - great tip and worked great to take it straight from the oven to the table

Great nachos I made them for a get together at a friends house and they loved them!! My friends girlfriend even asked for the recipe for her company cookout! Just had to use ground beef instead of chicken cuz that's what I had at the time but they still were excellent!! I also added black beans, corn and fresh chopped cilantro to them and I loved the additions!! Thank you for the recipe, I will make them again!!

Ok, so I didn't follow this recipe exactly but I still give props for the construction of my dish. However I did the following order (bottom to top): -- blue & yellow corn tortilla chips -- pint of queso blanco *tostitos brand, or moe's/qdoba/salsarita's. shredded boneless chicken breast *season as you like. -- small can mexican mole sauce *found in hispanic foods section. -- [lots of homemade pico de gallo] -- [4 avocados worth homemade guacamole] I baked in a pyrex pan for about 10-12 mins at 350 and threw on the pico de gallo & guacamole. Delious & perfect for Sunday football.

I made this recipe for me and it was quite good. I really like salsa and tomatoes.  My children don't so for their chicken I took a couple of tsp. of taco seasoning and a couple of tablespoons of oil and coated the chicken breast in the mixture for 15 minutes. Then pan fried the chicken, shredding it with a fork as it cooked and they loved it! I think everyone agreed that chicken nachos were perfect movie watching food.

I put chips in the oven for 5 mins prior to adding the topping, helps keep the chips from becoming soggy in the oven. Also I add cheese sauce to the topping, because without it, theres not enough topping to coat every chip! Ive already made it twice and its just delicous.

How great are these!? You can really be creative and come up with all sorts of different combinations with cheese and salsa, depending on who you are feeding. Yum!

These were delicious!!!  The garlic really stands out and makes these nachos!  I didn't have the green onion so I used yellow onion instead.  I topped these with some cilantro.  Great recipe!

This was a really great recipe. The whole family loved it and I will definitely make it again.  I did, however, use fajita seasoning rather than to use the taco seasoning like other reviewers had recommended.  Had the recipe called for some kind of seasoning to spice up the chicken, I probably would have given it a 5 star rating.

My boyfriend and his friend loved it! My boyfriend eat it up and left nothing behind ^_^! I didn't bake the meat with the chips since he didn't want it that way, so I just prepared it as directed but added Taco Seasoning and used ground beef instead. I am a vegetarian so I didn't eat it to add my own compliment but those that tasted it said it was fabulous!

Loved this recipe!  I added a can of black beans for more substance and I cooked the chicken on stove in some olive oil and added the seasonings and then the salsa, I added the beans directly to the skillet.  It all ended up staying on the stove for almost 45 min (my husband was late coming home from work) and it turned out so good and I think it was because the chicken and beans marinated together for those 45 min.  Then I just baked the chips for 5 min alone before adding the chicken and beans, made the chips very crisp and that's a must for a recipe like this!  Yum!  My husband said it was one of his favorite meals so far and was better than any nachos he's had at a restuarant!

Next time I will just bake the topping and pour the chips over it so they will stay crunchy. did not care for the way the chips softened. Other than that was pretty good.

It was okay. By the time I tweaked it, it became a different recipe. I also added the taco seasonging while cooking the chicken. And, I also added refried beans.

I grilled my chicken (10-12 tenders) after tossing it in oil and "Pampered Chef Chipotle Rub".  I followed the recipe to the tee but I layered the ingredients as follows so there were no naked chips!: chips, cheese, chicken mixture, tomato, cheese, and then one more layer of that.  After ten minutes in the oven and a few minutes under "broil'' at 350 it was done to perfection!  I plated it and topped it with a few more diced toms, chopped green onions, a little more salsa, and sour cream.  It was delicious and everyone went back for seconds!  Way better then any restaurant nachos I have ever had!

These were pretty good!  My husband loved them; there were hardly any leftovers!  Personally, they were were good but nothing spectacular.  I added some homemade taco seasoning from this site instead of just salt and pepper.  I think it gives it good flavor.

Spreading the nachos in a single layer on a baking sheet, rather than piling them together as restaurants do, ensures that the chips will be evenly topped and that there won't be those soggy middle chips. Nice!

It was good but I doctored it up a bit according to suggestions. I added taco seasoning to the chicken. I added a canned diced tomatoes with green chilies. I added canned corn and black beans. I used fat free cheddar cheese for the topping.

4 stars as is, but 5 stars when I substituted shredded rotisserie chicken for the chicken breast (easier, too!) I also like to kick it up a notch with taco seasoning, diced canned green chilis, corn niblets. We like Fritos crushed on top too! This makes a great dip with tortilla chips but is super as tacos, too. Great thing to keep made in the fridge for snacking or a quick meal especially for hungry teenagers.

This makes quite the presentation. Very good taste and easy to make. Impressive. My only suggestion would be to sprinkle a layer of cheese etc. over half of the chips in addition to the top only. I served this with guacamole and tacos. A great meal.

These were the best nachos I have made. We served with additional salsa and sour cream. Used 1/2 fat mature cheddar cheese. We added diced red onions before baking.

YUM - just needs sprucing up to call it "dinner".  Added taco seasoning and a dash of Frank's Red Hot to the chicken while cooking to give it some zing.  Drained and rinsed a can of black beans, drained a can of corn, added olives, salsa, sour cream, etc.  Instead of baking and dealing with the mess, I make these on individual plates like this:  Layer of chips, sprinkle shredded cheese on them, spoon on corn and beans, add chicken if it cooled off, and microwave about 20-30 seconds.  When done, add your cold ingredients, sprinkle on more cheese, and enjoy!

It was delicious!! My picky husband even liked it. I didnt have a few items at home so I went without green onions. Instead of canola oil and garlic gloves, I used olive oil and minced garlic. I cubed the chicken (Personal prefrence). Next time, I will use the green onoins it calls for, olives, and cilantro. If you dont have some items, it will still turn out great!!!

These really did remind me of restaurant quality nachos.  I took the advice of another reviewer who heated the nachos in the oven PRIOR to adding the ingredients.  This did help keep them crunchier and less soggy.  I had leftover Parmesan Crusted Chicken that I had made and decided I wanted nachos for dinner.  I found this recipe and I'm really glad I did!  I did follow the recipe except my leftover chicken was already seasoned/cooked, I oven-toasted the nachos (for about 10 mins), and then topped the nachos with refried beans before layering on everything else.  I also added sliced black olives and sour cream after removing them from the oven.  My husband and I ate this for dinner and both had seconds!

Yum! You can obviously get as funky as you want with this recipe. I went with the recipe pretty much as written, but added a little salsa con queso along with the regular salsa in the chicken, and black olives to the top. Nachos for dinner, what next? Thanks for the recipe! :)

These were decent nachos. I seasoned the chicken with a dash of chili powder. I agree with another reviewer who had mentioned some of the chips got soggy after they were baked...and even more so after they sat! Still, guests ate them and there are none left...but I think I'll stick with other ways to make nachos.

these are very good!  I made them for a graduation party and some of the guest didn't make it to the table in time to get any nachos.  They ask what was in the dish that everyone was raving about.

this recipe is great!! I made other food for my kids and made this for my husband and I to enjoy. It tasted so good!! My kids who range in age from 13 to 3 all loved it to----it was gone in minutes. I thought the salsa would turn them off but it didn't. This is a keeper.

This was a great recipe.  The only thing I did differently, was season the chicken with a southwest seasoning first.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was a hit at our super bowl party. I loved how simple and easy it was to make. The only change that I made was to add taco seasoning to the chicken per a previous reviewer. Aside from that I kept it just the same and it was DELICIOUS!!

Way better than restaurant.  While the oven was preheating, i put the chips in to crisp. Once oven preheated, I removed and added a can of refried bean
first and then the chicken and cheese ( put 12 ouncs not 8)   When all melted through, sprinkled with scallions and sliced olives.  My 4 teen sons loved this snack!

I am not sure where people eat to get these at a restaurant, but I would demand my money back.  I really wanted to like these, and even added the taco seasoning as suggested by some... which gave it a little taste, it needs it badly.  I have to say, it needs a lot more than that... needs to be rewritten!  The picture looks pretty, but where are the ingredients for THAT one?  Needs a gooey cheese mixture, olives, onions, not just salsa, but possibly taco sauce, NEEDS SEASONING on the chicken, which I did.. and if that is done, I think it can be poured over the chips and remain gooey.  Will not be making these again, will look for another recipe or make my own.  Be warned you will need to make many adjustments on this one.

The perfect chicken nachos.  I made one huge platter of these to feed my family of 5.  These would also be a great thing to make for a crowd to eat during a football game, or other TV event.

Wanting to use up some refried  beans I decided to add them to these nachos.  I wasn't thinking and put the beans on the  chips first which resulted in chips that soon lost their crisp.  Recommend to spread out chips, cover with cheese first and bake a few minutes to melt, then add other toppings. Added on sour cream and lots of cilantro.

My kids ask me to make nachos weekly now!!!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I use my own homemade salsa and it is to die for.  Sometimes we add some black olives on top with a little guacamole on the side.

I think this is a good basic recipe but I usually just use whatever I have on hand, like refried beans and shredded rotisserie chicken.  I arrange my chips in a circle and scoop hot beans and chicken in the middle, top with canned diced tomatoes (more flavor than fresh) and shredded cheese and bake in the toaster oven.  This leaves me with no soggy chips!  Then I top with sour cream, salsa and lots of chopped cilantro.  Delicious!

I LOVE nachos and Mexican food and my husband does NOT. He made this recipe at my request and we both thought it was so fabulous, we made it 2 nights in a row. We did warm the chips in the oven for 5 minutes before adding the main ingredients---as suggested in a few reviews. We also seasoned the chicken with GOYA SAZON prior to cooking /shredding the chicken and used fresh non-jarred SALSA!! (found in most produce sections of grocery stores). I love refried beans but neither used nor missed them. Served with lots of sour cream and shredded lettuce. YUM!!!

Aweson recipe but changed...used green chile salsa (16 oz) added to a precooked rotisserie chicken (white meat only) from Sam's.  Doubled the cheese which caused WOW tostisos to become somewhat soggy.  Next time after making chicken mixture will melt cheese on top in the microwave and use chips to dip.  Also, served on the side jalapenos.  Reaaly easy and really good.

Good, however we like our nachos with lots of good stuff on them.  This recipe gives me ideas, however I'm going back to "packed full of good stuff" nachos.

Before I discuss this recipe, let me mention the few small changes I made, just in case. One-I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves. Two-I left out the onions and tomato, because my family and I don't like them. Three-I left out the oil and the salt for health purposes. Now let me mention the two small changes I would recommend to others: 1, definitely use more than a cup of salsa and 2, use even MORE cheese. These are supposed to be nachos, after all (I used a 16 oz jar of salsa and a bag and a half of 8 oz cheese, and it still needed more of both). Also, I used two chicken breasts, but would probably recommend three (all this was cooked in a casserole dish for my husband and I). Now, having said all that, this recipe was absolutely, 100%, amazingly INCREDIBLE! We turned it into a meal. Put it on a real plate, used a fork, broke the chips, and ate it like a taco salad. Didn't have anything else with it, and it was still super filling. SO tasty--really hit our Mexican food-craving spot. Most DEFINITELY will become a staple in our house. In fact, I will probably make it again next week! Can't say enough about it. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! Would give it 6 stars, if I could!

A great base recipe to use to get the creative juices flowing... I liked the idea of salsa instead of straight taco seasoning (I cooked my chicken in the garlic, vidalia onion, and salsa). Target has a great blue corn tortilla chip with flax which held up well to the toppings, lending a nice crisp all the way to the end of the pile! I added black olives, black beans, avocado, and Mexican Queso cheese. Accompanied by a side salad and beverages, we called this our Saturday night dinner!

Wow, awesome!!! Just like we used to get in a restaurant  in New Hampshire, we're in Florida now. Very easy to make, kids just loved this one. We added a bit of BBQ sauce to the chicken another time and it was great also.

My husband really loved these.  But I think the next time I make them I am going to put taco seasoning on the Chicken for I felt it was a little bland.  But it really is delicious.

I make very similar nachos using a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store that I shred and mix with about 1/3 of a cup of Mild taco sauce it coats the chicken much better than a dry taco mix and the chicken stays moist. It is one of my favorite quick dinners.

I made these for dinner tonight, along with a nice salad and this was a huge  hit with my family. I read the reviews and wanted to try to figure out a way to make them less soggy. So, I used a 13x9 in. pan and put a layer of refried beans on the bottom, then the chicken mixture, then some of the cheese, then the chips topped with more cheese. I accidently put the green onions on the cheese before I baked it and I have to say it turned out great! The chips were not soggy and it was delicious. My husband said it was great and a really nice change and my 3 kids loved it. This will be great to take to a get together with friends, it is easy, quick and delicious!

Excellent!  I didn't spray the baking sheet with anything so alot of the chips stuck to the bottom.  I'll have to remember that next time!  This will be perfect for a family get together.

I baked a crust of reduced-fat crescent rolls (per package directions) then topped with this, ommitting the tortilla chips.  Yum.  Also good as written.

My boyfriend absolutely loves nachos so when I came across this recipe, I knew I had to try it. I made it as described, with the exception of using 2 tbsp. of homemade taco seasoning ("Taco Seasoning I" on this site); and I used a rotisserie chicken (shredded up) versus the canned version.

Ease of prep: it couldn't get any easier! I think shredding the chicken took the longest but it was worth it! The shredded chicken felt smoother in your mouth versus chunks of chicken, but I believe it's personal preference. 

Ease of putting the meal together: again, it could not be easier! I do feel that you need more Mexican seasonings to make it taste more authentic, though. 

Overall: DELICIOUS!! Or as my teenage son would say, "Nom nom nom!", This will be a staple in my household!

Side note: I doubled the recipe and used an entire bag of Tostito's...layered it on a 9x13 cookie sheet (lined with foil). When it was done, the first thing I thought was this would be PERFECR for a football party!!

This was a delicious confort food dish. I made a vegan version using Weststoy cubed seitan. Aside from that, I followed the recipe as is, except I added a bit of "Mexican spices" seasoning.

Wonderful!  The ONLY variation that I did (if you want to call it that) was to use a rotissere chicken and just shred that (plus the flavor is fabulous).   And my family does not like tomatoes so I didn't do that.  My family LOVED this and I'm going to be trying out differ variations for the future.  Thanks Laura B for submitting!!!

Wonderful!! Did just a couple of adjustments though, and followed many suggestions.  My best addition was to use a mexican cheese.  It melted so well and stayed very gooey.  It is Queso Chihuahua (by Supremo), a white cheese that says right on the label that it is a "Mexican style Quesadilla melting cheese"  I used 8 ounces of that, and 4 ounces of medium cheddar.  Also used 1 tablespoon of EVOO instead of the 3 of canola oil, and a can of Hormel Turkey Chili.  We baked the chips for 5 minutes as well before layering the other ingredients.  This basic recipe is a GREAT guide to follow and personalize.

This was a certified hit w/ my hubby and daugther.  They loved it but I had to had things.  delicious but I added seasoned lean ground beef, melted cheddar, taco seasonings as well as other seasonings, black olives.  I used olive oil instead of canola and canned Tyson chicken chunks.  I baked the chips alone for about 7 mins, then added the chicken mix & the lean ground beef mix.

When I made this I was a little short on the salsa, so the chicken came out a little dry.  The garlic and onions and tomato definitely make this good!  This is a good method that can be changed up to fit your favorite nacho toppings.  It really only needs baked long enough to melt the cheese.  Could probably achieve this in the microwave.  I'm going to try that next time.

This was really good. I seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning and added refried beans like others suggested. We ate it for our "movie night." I ate it with guacamole and sour cream. I also didn't have green onions so I left them out and it was still good.

I added black beans and corn. Taco seasoning would probably have helped make it more flavorful.

This has become one of my favorite quick-fix stand by recipes! So fast and easy to make, and very adaptable. If I don't have leftover chicken on hand I just pan-fry a plain breast then remove it from heat when done cooking, shred with two forks and add to salsa (I've also used taco sauce when I saw I had no salsa and it came out great!). I love that it is very adaptable and you can tweak easily to accomodate what you have on hand. My extremely picky two year old daughter loved it, so I'll definitely keep making it on a regular basis. You can also pop it into the microwave if it's too hot to turn the broiler on just to melt the cheese.

These were great.  I used homemade salsa and about 3 chicken breasts.  I made sure I drained all the liquied from the chicken and salsa after I let it simmer and before I put it on top of the nacho chips.  I used about 3-4 cups of mexican cheese.  Then I topped it with green onions, black olives and a chopped avacado and some sour cream.  My husband really liked them and so did my very picky teenage daughter.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very simple and so yummy! I have made this twice.Both ways are great. The second time i added a small can (mild) green chilis,1 cup (drained) blak beans and half package taco seasoning to the chicken mixture.Pure heaven!!!Topped with light sour cream and salsa!My kids loved it and no leftovers! This is going into my rotation.Thanks for a great,easy kid friendly week night meal.I also served this with fresh fruit-Mango,Pineapple,Kiwi & Strawberries which went very well with the nachos :)

My husband and I crave these and he is normally a beef man. They are so good and easy. I season my chicken with garlic salt, pepper and cumin and grill or saute in a skillet. I make Bob Cody's Guacamole to go with these and they are better than any restaurant's nachos!

These nachos were delicious. I doubled the recipe and made them for a pre football dinner for 5 hungry graduate students. I cooked two chicken breasts in a skillet and shredded it with two forks. I followed most of the recipe but added a packet of taco seasoning and a spicy green salsa with green chilies. I kept the chips crispy by baking the chips for a few minutes and added a thin layer of refried beans before adding the chicken mixture. Mmmm

Delicious! Just what I was craving! I boiled a chicken breast, then simmered it with taco seasoning. Followed the recipe otherwise, with the exception of adding a half a can of black beans to the nachos before baking. Topped with sour cream, yum! Thank you :)

These were very good and easy to make.  I used pepper jack cheese and added a few chopped jalapeño slices to add some kick.  Also added some black olives and sour cream.  I took others' recommendations of baking the chips first but they still got soggy.  I think next time I would just bake up the dish first, then put the chips on a plate and serve over top.

Excellent dish. Here are my changes. Cooked the chicken in verde sauce/garlic & shredded it. Layered the ingredients in a casserole dish with refried beans and baked it 15-20 minutes. Sprinkled the top with tomatoes, chunks of avacados, dollops of sour cream, green onions & jalapenos. The baking dish kept it compacted together and more evenly distributed the flavors (without a lot of loose "no topping" chips). Beans (black or pinto) really make this recipe. 

This is a fun, easy dish.
Thank you so much!

This is my new process for making nachos, I've never baked them before, just baked the chips and threw everything on top. No more! This recipe is so easy to tailor to whatever you want. I do recommend as pp suggested, bake the chips first for 5 minutes, they won't get soggy that way, and I used baked chips which are thinner and they came out great. Added corn and black ranch beans for extra protein, 1/2 ff cheese and 1/2 2% cheese, topped with ff sour cream, guilt free nachos!!

Great recipe! Simple, fast and a tasty snack! The only variation was that I used Blue Corn torilla chips (which made it nice and colorful) and I also added a side of sour cream at the end. Yummm!

This is a great recipe!  I just got my own place and don't turn on the oven much so I use the microwave.  I take a big plate and spread refried beans then surround the plate with the chips and put it in the microwave for about a minute and a half then I top it with the chicken mixture and spread the cheese put it back in the microwave to melt the cheese and top with sour cream, chives, and tomatoes.  I can whip this dish up in minutes.

I wanted something tasty for NCAA tournament watching.  This recipe is good as it is written, but adding a can of beans (I used pinto) and a little bit of corn really made it excellent.  I also cut down on the chicken, since we are not big meat-eaters.  It was very good, and something I will make many times.

I made some changes to this recipe to make it faster and healthier based on some other peoples comments and our preferences(perhaps I don't have the right to review but I like my changes :). First, instead of sauteeing chicken and onions, I used a can of cooked chicken breast, drained and mixed with a packet of taco seasoning. Then in a pie plate I combined seasoned chicken, salsa, 1 can black beans (drained), 1 cup frozen corn, 1 can sliced black olives (drained)  &  1/2 of green onions. Then I sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese, diced tomatos and remaining onions on top. I baked for 10 min and served with tortilla chips, sour cream and guacamole. This was a fun and easy Friday night dinner. I will definitely add this to our list of regulars!

Very good.  I added olives and used canned chicken.  Next time will use thicker tortilla chips so they don't get soggy.

I normally only eat nachos with a cheese dip but this one was so good and looked so pretty too.  I halved the recipe but all my friends loved it so much that it was gone so fast.  Next time I'll make the full batch.

This is a great recipe.  Very tasty. However, I used 1/2 lb. ground beef, used less oil, threw in some jalepenos and pink beans.  It was and continues to be a hit in my home.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I sauteed the onion and garlic with taco seasoning per others' suggestions, but I did have to add quite a bit of water because it was very thick. I also added some rotisserie chicken to the seasoning towards the end for a nice coating. Toasting the chips beforehand gave it a really nice crunch. We will definitely be having this again!

This was so very good! I too toasted the tortilla shells for 5 minutes in the oven, helped to keep them crisp.
And I added rinsed black beans and some frozen corn to add more texture as another reviewer suggested.
And one other thing I did was add a packet of taco seasoning to the chicken as it heated. Thank you for this
Great recipe! Will be making it again!

I marinated chicken in Easy Chicken Fajita Marinade, and then I grilled it for this recipe, which is fabulous! I omitted all the canola oil just to lower the calories and don't think it was missed at all. I did use a good quality chunky salsa, which I think is imperative. I will definitely fix this again.

We loved this recipe!  I only gave it four stars though because the chips were somewhat soggy.  Next time I will put the mixture on the chips and put individual servings in the microwave to melt the cheese.  It will also make it better as a leftover!

I made these to snack on during the football game yesterday.  I did crisp my tortilla chips first at 350 for 5 minutes as suggested by others.  I didn’t use nearly the amount of oil indicated and I, too, added a couple of teaspoons of taco seasoning to the chicken mixture.   I used a mix of sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheese, as that’s what I had on hand.  And  I only had grape tomatoes, so I sliced those, but didn’t add them until the nachos came out of the oven.  I also added sliced black olives.  These were good, but didn’t wow us the way I had hoped.  And even though I crisped my chips first, the nachos did begin to get soggy before we could eat them all.

These were good however, I thought something was missing.   Not bad at all but just nachos with some chicken added.  I will marinade the chicken next time.  Thanks.

I crisped up the chips a bit more as some of the reviews suggested.  I used a store bought chicken and after shredding it, sauteed it with onions, garlic and peppers before adding the salsa, then i just followed the recipe on out, cuting down on some of the cheese.  My family enjoyed it, will definitely make it again, not bad for my first crack at nachos. (I thought it tasted even better the next day)

Tastes like nachos you would get from a restaurant. Amazing flavor. I made vegetarian. I used the same recipe to make a pasta sauce the next night. I followed the other readers by placing the chips in the oven for 5 minutes prior to adding the toppings. I also sprinkled taco seasoning before putting the toppings on and then baking the final 5 minutes.

Bangin'! I used two chicken breasts, no salt, a whole tomato & added corn. I took the suggestion of others to put the chips in the oven to crisp them up for 5 minutes before adding the toppings and had no problem with sogginess. Can't wait to make it again!

It was good.  I added sour cream on top of it.  The recipe had too much green onion, in my opinion.  I liked the addition of salsa.  I used colby/monterey jack mix since I didn't have a cheddar/monterey jack blend.

Yum!  I did this with ground beef that I browned and then simmered with some taco seasoning.  I also added black beans!  Husband loved it!  This would be a great appetizer for a crowd!

My husband LOVED these nachos. The first time i cubed the chicken rather than shredded, and then shredded the next time and it was so much better. I also added black beans, olives and jalapenos. I also made my own taco seasoning mix which is so much better than the package. With a little sour cream and guacamole on top it was better than a restaurant in my opinion. Cheaper too!

We love nachos and this recipe is excellent! Even my one year old son loved it. I omitted the tomatoes and added a dash of cumin and paprika. This is a great recipe to play around with. I will be making this again and again!

Okay, I am only giving it four stars because I had to make some changes. With my changes, this recipe is five stars. I didn't have any green onions so I didn't include them. I also didn't have fresh garlic, so I used minced garlic instead. When the chicken was almost done, I added taco seasoning for additional taste. It was great! Also, I baked the chips for 12 minutes prior to adding the chicken mixture. Lastly, I added black beans to my mixture. The recipe turned out great with my changes. If you want a little healthier dish, add lettuce as well.

Shut up, these seem so tacky with salsa poured over chicken. But let me tell you, these nachos are DIVINE.  This is what i'm lookin' for when I curl up to nice plate of nachos in front of the TV. Restaurant style I tell you what.

These nachos were delicious.  I did make some small changes based on what I had in the house.  First, I didn't have any flat nachos so I lined my pan with some nacho "Scoops" and heated them for about 10 minutes.  I used 2 boneless chicken breast and cooked it with oil and  1 clove garlic. When cooled, I shredded the chicken. Then, I sprinkled some taco seasoning on them and then mixed it with some refried beans and heated all together. Lastly, I took a tablespoons worth of mixture and filled each shell, then added fresh salsa from in the produce dept of the local grocery store and taco cheese.  This salsa looks more like pico de gallo than watery salsa. I baked it in the oven about 15 minutes @ 350 degrees.  
These were MUCH less messy than traditional nachos and were a HUGE hit with my family.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good basic recipe - adjust to suit your own taste as far as seasonings, hot or mild salsa, more or less tomato, onions, etc.  - you can't go wrong!  Knowing my family's tastes, I seasoned the chicken with some chili powder and cumin (cooked it in the microwave), used medium salsa, added jalapenos, sliced black olives, and more chopped tomato. I used 'restaurant style' tortilla chips and did not warm them first to avoid soggy chips.  I just drained the chicken mixture a little bit before topping, then broiled the nachos.

This was pretty good. I used chipoltle salsa and added some ground cumin and chile powder to the chicken mixture, as well as 1/2 a can of black beans. Next time I will try it with mexican velveeta as the cheese got sticky as it cooled down, causing the nachos to stick together. Definitely a keeper though. I garnished it with black olive slices and jalepenos as well as  the green onions and served it with sour cream and guacamole...YUM!

Better than nachos I've had at MOST restaurants!  The thing I like best about this recipe is that you can customize it with the exact flavors you like.   I love the taste of cilantro, so garnished the nachos with lots...

These were awesome!  I used baked chips.  I also grilled the chicken and sprinkled a can of black beans over the chips before topping with cheese to make them more hearty.  Very filling.  Will definitely make again soon.

This has become a favorite at my house.
Sometimes I add 1/2 can of green chile enchilada sauce and mix it into the refried beans for a change, I mix the rest of the enchilada sauce with sour cream to use as a topping for the nachos.

We thought this was a good dinner that the kids loved.  I used a costco chicken (just the breast), I cooked the chips beforehand for about 5 minutes and I added canned black beans.  Next time I will use some avacado too.  I used at least 3/4 of the pack of chips (a very full 9X13 pan) which was too much for both our family and the mixture was less than I would've wanted so next time I'll only use 1/2 bag.

Not that this needs another 5 star rating - but I had to...this recipe is DELICIOUS! A new family favorite.  I made no changes to the recipe the first time I made it (no need to) but since, I have added fresh from teh garden jalapeno peppers while sauteeing the garlic and green onions.  Gave it an extra kick.  Thanks for the recipe!

We've had this twice in a week. Very easy to make. I left out the chicken/salsa mixture and poured it on top of the melted chesse since the chips got soggy the first time. Added refried beans, sour cream, guacamole, and chopped olives.. a warm 7 layer dip. :) Love it and will be a regular in our house. Thanks for the great recipe!

I wanted more of a white, creamy type of sauce for the chicken instead of tomato based. I added 1/2 cup of cream of chicken soup, a small can of diced green chiles and 1/2 cup of sour cream to the sauteed garlic, onion and chicken and heated just till warm. Put that on top of the chips, topped with the cheese and some black olives. I saved the tomatoes to add after it came out of the oven. I think that may be where a lot of the sogginess problems come from.

I was a little skeptical of this recipe. I cook a lot and love fresh ingredients, but I was in a hurry for dinner and here is what I did: Doubled the recipe - used 2 cans Swanson chicken, and garlic salt; omitting the table salt and galic cloves, and the scallions (didn't have any). Followed the rest of the recipe to a tee (except smothered with black olives over the cheese) - I warmed the chips before topping for a few minutes. THESE ARE A NEW STAPLE AT OUR HOUSE! These nachos got APPLAUSE from three children (3, 9, 11 yrs) and my husband. They are so good - you just have to try this at least once. I served with sour cream, side of beans, and a side dish of cinnamon apples. What a fabulous meal. I am so impressed and thank you so much for our new family favorite. (NOTE: There was little to no taste difference between using chicken breast and canned chicken. It all mixes with the salsa and tastes wonderful either way.)

Delish!!!  Even my 4 year old loved it!  Made this at the last minute so I used a can of white meat chicken instead of a chicken breast.  Nobody knew the difference!  It was AWESOME!!  We all ate till we were STUFFED!

I added half a package of taco seasoning to the chicken and baked the nachos for 5 min. prior to adding everything. Awesome meal for 3 or 4. Thank you for the recipe!

Had this a week ago and the wife has requested it again. Yes it was very good. This time though I am going to use ground pork vs the chicken, other than that recipe as is.

Phenomenal!  I made this exactly as directed (flatten chicken w/ mallet to 1/2", boil 10 min,  let cool/rest 5 min, shred w/ two forks), and added jalapeños and sliced black olives. I think the ones that say they needed to add taco seasoning must not have let the chicken and salsa reduce enough. I simmered the shredded chicken and salsa mixture about 20 minutes until the juice had JUST simmered out, leaving a dry-ish mixture so as not to let the cops get soggy.  Using slightly preheated cast iron fajita pans I added the chips, baked 5 min, added about 1/3 of the cheese to melt another 5 minutes (this keeps all the wetter ingredients separated from the chips), then added the chicken, remainder of the cheese, and the rest of my toppings. Let cook another 5-8min, then remove, add chopped green onions, let rest a few minutes, throw a dollop of Greek yogurt (SC replacement) on the edge of the pile, and viola! Better than ANY restaurant nachos, by FAR!  All in all, I did NOT modify this recipe, just added Jalapeños and black olives along with a refined cooking technique based on others reviews. AMAZING, thank you for this recipe!

I used coconut oil instead of canola since coconut is healthier for us. I also did not go by the recipe because it would not have been as flavorful. Added 1/2 pkg. of taco seasoning in with chicken as I cooked it in pan with green onions. I used rotisserie chicken and I added can of refried black beans in with chicken. Also added sweet frozen kernel corn. I used whole bag 13 oz. of tortilla chips and put in Lg. glass Pyrex baking dish and sprayed with nonstick spray. I also added a little mozzarella cheese on top of Colby/ mont/jack cheese. Used a fresh salsa I found at Wal-Mart deli and 1/4 jar of mild salsa in jar. Used sour cream as dip on side. The corn really made this so much better and we thought it was really good and ate it as our dinner. The tortilla chips were not soggy either.

We added more seasonings to the chicken...cumin, onion and garlic powders, cayenne...and added a layer of refrieds to the pre-baked chips before topping with everything else.  Thanks for the inspiration.  These were really good!

Sooo good & easy to make.  I made this for a light dinner one night. The only change I made was using a large can of canned white chicken rinsed well.  I used frontera green salsa which blended well with the other ingredients esp the garlic.  My only addition was healthy avocados diced on the side before serving.  I have been craving this practically every night for dinner since the first time I made it.  A keeper!

This was great! My family LOVED it and went back for seconds...and thirds! I did toast the chips in the oven for ten minutes before I added the toppings. I also used chicken breasts (shredded.) I took other reviewers advice and warmed everything up and just put everything on top of chips with no need to put the whole thing back in the oven. It was better than any other nacho recipe I've had. Thank you for a great recipe!

Since I can never just use the recipe I'm given I modified this. I used a rotisserie chicken for the shredded chicken and prepared it the same way (with the garlic and green onions). I however didn't use a cup of salsa, I instead spooned it on, until it covered the chicken but didn't overwhelm it. I also added a little bit of cayenne pepper and some paprika.  I then layered the chips, making sure they didn't overlap then I sprinkled cheese on it, and then I put the chicken mixture on and put monterey cheese on top. Then I added more chips and repeated the process. Put it in the oven, let it bake. Then the last 5 minutes I put the tomatoes on and let it bake another 5 minutes. Then a couple minutes after I broiled it to get the cheese and chips to brown a little. Then I took it out, sprinkled it with green onions and squeezed sour cream on to it.  Served it with salsa on the side. It turned out great! Cheaper than going out and probably healthier.

Family loved this tonight. I used extra lean ground chicken instead of shredded chicken breast. I seasoned the ground chicken with Homemade Taco Seasoning Mix from this site and also used Nacho Cheese Sauce from this site to top the nachos. I used some tortilla chips and some leftover doritoes...this was very easy, tasty and we also added a lil low fat sour cream as well. Thanks!

I used a Rotisserie chicken and mixed it in with some taco seasoning, garlic powder, black beans, and only a little salsa to moisten it up some. I didn't have onions or garlic on hand so didnt use them. I heated up the chips like other reviewers had said, and in about 8 minutes I had delicious nachos!

So tasty!!  I used "medium" salsa in the recipe, and it gave these nachos a really nice, flavorful kick.  Hubby and I had it for dinner one night, and went through a whole baking sheet (I doubled the recipe since I was using it for a meal).  Really fantastic, and really easy - thank you for sharing these!

This is good as written. To make it better be sure to add taco seasoning to the chicken while cooking. I warmed a can of refried beans in the microwave and after warming the chips for 5 mins. put cheese on the chips, then refried beans, then chicken mixture, more cheese and topped with sliced jalapenos and the chopped tomatoes. Warmed at 350 degrees for 15 mins. After warming topped with the green tips of the onions. The more cheese the better. Be sure to use really good shredded cheese so it melts well. Served with salsa and sour cream on the side. A great nacho recipe for sure!

I made these for my husband, and my kids (ages 2 and 4). They were delicious, and everyone enjoyed them! A lot of people are complaining about having to add things to the recipe, but I feel like any good cook will take a recipe and add their own twist, that does not mean that the recipe was bad, just that due to personal taste some people like to add a little more or less! I did add Refried beans, and a nacho cheese sauce. I also used chicken thighs because I think they hold more flavor. This is a great recipe to add whatever ingredients you likeand make it your own!

this was tasty, i took others advice and put the chips in the oven by themselves so it wouldn't be soggy, i didn't have enough green onion so we cut up red and green peppers too and made a cheese sauce instead of using shredded cheese, definately would use again!

Excellent! I used a can of Rotel tomatoes, drained and sprinkled on top instead of the plain tomato (my husband loves spicy foods - so this added a great kick). Will definitely keep this recipe - perfect for football day or poker night!

Awesome recipe!  I used rotisserie chicken breast to make the prep easier and I baked the tortilla chips on a cookie sheet that had been sprayed with vegetable oil for four minutes so it would not get soggy.

I've made these 3 times in the last month.  Easy and awesome!  I cook 2 chicken breasts as my family would definitely want more meat on their nachos.  And I baked the chips for a few minutes before loading on the toppings to prevent them from getting soggy.  Yummy!

These were EXCELLENT!  I was skeptical about what the big deal was- but these are great.  I took the recommendation of other to use the taco seasoning on the chicken and then I added more in the onion mixture.  I didn't use as much salsa as it called for, and I'm glad that I didn't because it would have been too soggy.  I bake the chips before too- EXCELLENT!  I made a double batch and had company- it was gone quickly and I was told these were the best nachos - definitely football game snack material!

What's not to love about this?? Very easy and quick and yummy. I used the rest of the chicken from Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches from this site which made it even easier and a little spicier which I love... Thanks!

Agree with everyone else. Easy and quick. Like most others, I added additional ingredients that I enjoy on nachos like jalapeno and black beans. Also used a store bought roasted chicken (of which I have over one-half leftover for another recipe tonight), sauteed in packaged taco seasoning. Used beer as my liquid instead of package suggested water. Also added sour cream on top. Great football watching food. Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! I made it for my bf's dad for his birthday and he just loved it. I substitute canned chicken (easier when you're in a fix) and I also layer the nachos with some nacho cheese sauce as well as shredded cheese. I find that if I cook most of the juice out of the chicken/salsa mixture, the nachos don't get soggy.

I am blown away by this recipe!  I will NEVER get nachos out at a restaurant again!  Why should I when I can make these?  I add a can of rinsed black beans when adding chicken.  I use medium salsa for the salsa and spread the topping over blue corn chips.  Yum Yum!

I used veggie crumbles for the meat and used this sites Taco Seasoning I to spice it up. Regular onions instead of green, 1 can of drained black beans, and a 1/2 minced jalapeno made these really good. Thanks for the recipe! **Update: I made this recipe with leftover turkey breast, refried beans and added taco seasoning. Along with homemade salsa and it came out pretty good. Not outstanding but very decent.

We made this for dinner last night but substituted ground turkey for the chicken.  We also added a can of drained and rinsed black beans.  It was pretty darn good.  I baked the chips for 5 minutes before putting the toppings on and they were still a little soggy.  But, we all enjoyed our nacho dinner.  May try corn next time to add a little more substance into it as a meal.

We love this. I found this recipe a few years ago, and it is everyone's favorite now. I added a can of refried beans mixed with about 1/4 cup milk to them to make them a little more filling. Put the beans on the chips, then the chicken and so forth.

My family often makes this on a Saturday evening.  It's quick, tasty and just like the Restaurants (we think even better!)  It's made fresh and the kids think it's fun to make and have this dish!  Also, I would recommend using fresh chicken as opposed to the canned type, it's much better you just need to saute paprika, chili powder blend or what works for your taste buds in with the chicken cubes!  A great & easy recipe and one that everyone will love!

This was very good!  I heated my chicken with the garlic, oil and some Rotel; also sprinkled some taco seasoning on the mixture.  I used Nacho Cheese sauce and shredded cheese, olives, and green onions.. Served refried beans and sour cream and tomatoes on the side.

I loved this recipe!  I actually made them into chicken tacos and my family loved them.  I deleted the onions and garlic and added black beans and frozen corn instead.  I spread sour cream on a flour tortilla and fill - yummy!

I tripled the garlic, used a colby, monterey jack, and cheddar cheese blend, and added a pacage of taco seasoning. I strongly feel the salsa/chicken mixture would have been quite bland without the taco seasoning. I couldn't taste the green onions whatsoever, so I think if you're out of them, it's no big deal. Even though I put the chips in the oven to crisp them up a bit... the ones that were more covered still ended up soggy. I think in the future I might like this as more of a dip... mixing in the cheese with the salsa/chicken mixture and putting it in the oven to warm through. Overall, it was pretty tasty and quite filling!

These are great.  I did have to make some changes.  I left out the onions and tomato. In place of the salsa I used hot taco sauce. I cut up a fresh jalapeno and red peppers and put on top after I took out of the oven.  So good!

BLECH!!!  You know something is a flop (whether my fault or the recipes) when nachos don't go at a Superbowl party.  These were an unpleasant collection of tastes and yes, the chip at the bottom were total mush!  Again, BLECH!

I made these for last night's super bowl and they were great!!  I added taco seasoning to he chicken as I cooked it and added Jalapenos and Black Olives on the topwith the tomatos and cheese.  Tasted just like the nachos I get at a local sports bar.

This was fine but nothing special.  This dish is lacking something.  Our family agreed it needed, at minimum, some refried beans.  Looked a little stark coming out of the oven.  We're throwing the leftovers into a tortilla soup.

I loved this recipe, however, I did modify it a bit (as all good cooks do)with lean ground beef, and added black beans and corn. Everything else was the same. It could've been a main meal.

this was delicious! i too used the canned chicken, but i used 2 cans and it was a lot of chicken which was perfect for us. i also did not have any green onions, so i just yellow. i also love lots of onions on my nachos, so i used a whole chopped large onion in place of the tomatos. these were really good... even leftover!

Really good & different. I halved the recipe & only used 1 teaspoon of oil. I used the microwave instead of heating the oven. I added sliced jalapenos and sour cream. Loved the addition of green onions.

This is a really good recipe. I've made it a couple of times and our friends love it. I leave out the garlic. I also use a chicken seasoning when I cook the chicken. A quick and Easy recipe to serve as an appetizer.

These are so good! I made it for a football game, but they didn't last past the opening kick! lol

I made a few modifications though. I omitted salsa and tomatoes, taco seasoning was sprinked over the finished nachos (TERRIFIC FOR SEASONING!), fresh cut chives was "folded" into sour cream   and I added extra onion and green onion. YUM! :)

It was a big hit! :)

these came out fantastic!  everyone gobbled them up.  the only change i made was I did not have salsa so I used taco sauce.  it had a nice tang without big peices of tomato in it.  I also baked the chips ahead of time which made all the difference.
will make again and again!  thanks so much

These nachos were quick and easy, but bland.  The tender flavor of green onions were lost in all of the salsa and cheese.  Was expecting a surprise flavor combination with the title "Restaurant Style" and the high rating.  Would make something similar again but add my own seasoning.

This is a good recipe - even if you think you're not a great fan of chicken on nachos. My ten year old and three year old also ate these.  I added some ground cumin to the mixture when cooking it, and I later added sour cream to the final product.  Delicious lunch!

Used tomatillo sauce instead of salsa because that’s all I had. Mixed in a very small amount of refried beans with chicken mixture (scaled to 2 servings). Served with sour cream on the side. Served with cheese quesadillas.

Excellent recipe.  I used Frontera Tomatilla Salsa which was perfect. I also added some cilantro to the chicken mixture.  I heated the chips prior and had no issue with sogginess.  This has become a new family favorite.

These are amazing, my husband and I both LOVED this. Only changed by adding black beans, and left off the sprinkling of green onion at the end. Added sour cream and guacamole as toppings. So much better than the soggy mess you tend to get at a mexican restaurant. The preparation was so easy, took little time and little clean up. YUM!!!

This was my daughter's choice for her birthday dinner. Not as an appetizer, but as the main dish! I did not change the recipe, but added sliced black olives, and put half portion of all of the ingredients "sandwiched" in between half of the tortilla chips before putting in the oven. That way more of the ingredients "attached" onto the chips. Thanks for sharing!

These are the BEST!!!  Chicken nachos are something I order almost everytime I see them on the menu at a restaurant, but these come in close to the best I have ever had.  I will be making these a lot!!

These are quick, easy, and very good! I cheated and used canned chicken, added more cheese, and baked the chips beforehand like suggested. Makes for a tasty appetizer or a new twist for taco night! I'll be keeping this one!

Excellent recipe... Also, heated up the chips before topping, used canned chicken, taco seasoning, and garlic salt.  Omitted tomato.
Will definetely keep this recipe for future parties.
All my guests loved it.

Oh my goodness, this recipe is BETTER than any restaurant nachos I have ever eaten!! It's easy to prepare, doesn't require anything too fancy and is a fantastic way to start a mexican meal (or any meal for that matter!) Two really big thumbs up!!!

These nachos are soooo good!  YUMMY. I serve them with sour cream, jalepenos, fresh tomotoes, green onion.  I make a nachos bar!  Of course, you have to serve it with a strawberry margarita and you will feel like you are in Mexico.

Excellent nachos!  I used chicken tenderloins, browned them in olive oil, sprinkled with lime juice.  Only used 1/2 c. salsa. Sliced the browned tenderloins in small pieces.  Made one batch with Mission Cheese sauce.  Second batch as above.  Also, sprinkled finely chopped lettuce all over.  Didn't last long in my house!!

Very good!  I used garlic powder and onion powder since I didn't have any garlic cloves or green onions on hand. I also used a can of Swanson chicken breast.  Next time, I will omit the salsa for cheesy, chicken nachos.

This is a very easy weeknight dinner. We like a little spice, so I added cumin and chili powder to skillet mixture. After plating it, I added spoonfull of refried beans in the middle. Wonderful! A weeknight regular.

I made this into quesadillas rather than nachos.  I added 1 chopped yellow bell pepper, 1 can of black beans and some chili powder and cumin.  I sauteed this mixture along with the chicken, green onions and tomatoes.  I had to add salt to achieve the right taste and went ahead and threw in some cheddar cheese to melt everything together.  I spread the mixture on one side of each tortilla, folded it in half, spread butter on the "up" side and baked them at 400 for about 10 minutes.  They came out perfect and the filling has now become a favorite. Thank you Laura.

Yummy way to use leftover store bought rotisserie chicken. Very good recipe!

Tip 1: use a sturdy dinner fork to shred chicken while it's still cold (right out of the refrigerator)

Tip 2: be careful when seasoning; store bought rotisserie chicken's are normally already well-seasoned

Thank you!

Love it.  Took several of the extra comments and tweaked it.
We love making this, it is mostly the same when we do make it, but nothing is ever the same twice when we cook.  That is what makes cooking sooooo fun.

Family loved this. Loved how the chips were not soggy like on some other nacho recipe. Very versatile on toppings, you can add anything. Next time like others suggested I’m trying it with taco season mix and black beans. Definitely make again.

Very nice nacho recipe. Making a chicken mixture is key to helping the nachos have a cohesive flavor. Some of the most helpful comments improve this dish: Cook chips in oven for 5 minutes before assembling nachos (prevents sogginess with chicken mixture), add taco seasoning to the chicken mixture, top nachos with corn/black olives/green part of green onions. These changes improve the dish without extra hassle.

I must admit to planning social gatherings simply as an excuse to make this. Everyone loves it! I add fresh sliced mushrooms just before putting it in the oven. Not necessary, since the recipe is fantastic as is, but I feel there's not alot that can't be improved by mushrooms!

Super yummy recipe!  I made this recipe with mostly what I had on hand.  I agree with the recommendation to use rotisserie chicken.  I mixed the chicken with Kirkland's salsa (from Costco)- just enough salsa to cover the chicken.  Agree with the review to heat the chips first 5 minutes.  I warmed up frozen broccoli, corn, red peppers on a separate tray & dumped them on top of the warmed chips.  Then I put drained black beans (3/4 a can) and Trader Joe's 3 type mixed shredded cheese.  Put sea salt & red pepper flakes on top.  Heated in oven @375 until cheese was melted.  I put a few black pieces on top, but I won't do that, again... too overpowering.  When done, scoop sour cream on top.  Yum!

I made this and it was great. I heated the chips at 350 for 10 minutes before I put the meat on them. Also I used ground chicken and used taco seasoning on the chicken.

Quick and easy recipe! I added my own seasoning to chicken and added other toppings like jalapeños, black olives and a dollop of sour cream. Overall good recipe and will make again with more toppings.

Turned out great! I added taco seasoning to ground beef. Baked in oven with Mexican cheese for 5 minutes. Added toppings to myself and my husbands likings. Would've been better with queso cheese, but I couldn't convince my husband to want it. Otherwise I will make again.

Deelish!  Very easy to make!  Start out with authentic tortilla chips if possible, not those totally salty ones like Tostitos.  Next time I will follow others' advice and add taco seasoning to the chicken mixture.  I'd also add more cheese than what they called for and black beans too.  Some people suggested that you should heat up the chips for 5 minutes before spooning on chicken mixture to keep em crunchy/crisp.  Next time I will put them under the broiler for the last 2-3 minutes.  Great with beer!

This was so easy and delicious! I only added some lime juice to the salsa and put black olives on top of the nachos, which is actually shown on the photo, and they were super awesome! I wish I had read the reviews first, you really do need to cover the pan with foil and bake the nachos a bit first. Otherwise the chips will be soggy! Also if you add 10 ingredients and make cheese sauce, you have changed the recipe! Thanks for an easy delicious recipe idea.

So good.  I added a small can of sliced black olives and a half bag of southwest style corn to the chicken mixture.  I also heated a can of refried beans with about a half cup of salsa for the first layer over the chips.  Two of us could have devoured the entire recipe, but we showed some restraint and saved half for the next day.  Will definitely make again.

Great base for Nachos. This recipe is great on its own but can be dressed up to your taste. I would suggest adding items such as sour cream, olives, diced tomato, or even refried beans to spice it up to what your family likes.

I used this recipe as more of a guide. I cooked some chopped rotisserie chicken with the white parts of green onions, garlic and a little bit of salsa in olive oil. I topped the chips with that mixture, some black beans, some diced pickled jalapenos and cheddar cheese and baked it on a baking sheet until the cheese was melted. Then I topped with plain Greek yogurt (in lieu of sour cream), the green onion greens and more salsa and these were THE BEST nachos I have ever made at home!! They were definitely restaurant quality, which I credit to cooking the "filling" mixture before baking it, which I never would have thought to do otherwise. Thank you!!

I didn't use the green onion, because heaven forbid my son, Mr. Pickypants, find something green on his plate! Knowing the chicken would be bland without it, I sprinkled with chicken with taco seasoning instead. Mr. Pickypants ate his unadorned, just chicken, cheese, and chips; after baking, I loaded mine with tomato, avocado, and shredded lettuce. We both really enjoyed them, and I will definitely make them again - thanks for sharing this recipe! 9.2.2013: I chopped the chicken finely instead of shredding it, which was a lot easier for me. I didn't have Cheddar/Jack, so I shredded a little mozzarella and some American cheese and tossed them together with a fork. That may sound awful, but this was THE BEST batch of these nachos I've made so far!

Great recipe. For added kick I used hot salsa. If you want beans make them as a side to keep the nachos from getting soggy.

I have made this twice.  The first time with Taco flavored ground beef, and the second time with Fajita flavored chicken.  I cook the chips for about 2min before to make them super crispy as well as adding black beans and jalapeno slices.  My family LOVES the recipe!

This recipe is amazing!  We have it nearly once a week.  I always add taco seasoning to the chicken mixture, and saute yellow onions with the garlic (don't usually have green onions on hand).  It really is as good as restaurant nachos!

This was really good. Crisped up the tortillas in the oven and seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning. Served with sour cream and guacamole. Easy and delish!

I wasnt sure how to add to my previous review so I thought I would do it this way.  I did take the other suggestions and baked my chips in the oven by themselves for just a little bit.  They were not soggy at all!!

This was excellent! I was looking for a good nacho base recipe that was still something a little more than just dumping chicken and toppings on some chips and this did that. I liked the use of the onions two ways, they served very separate purposes. I did throw a little homemade taco seasoning (bill echols' from this site) on the chicken while cooking because I like extra spice and I put that on just about everything. Next time I will add olives, black beans and jalapenos to customize it a bit for us. Thank you!

I made it as written and it was delicious! I did add a little cumin and crushed red peppers to the chicken in the skillet and I crisped the chips for 5 minutes before adding the chicken and cheese, per another reviewer's suggestion. This was a big hit with my teenagers. It's a keeper!

Thank you for sharing your recipe. I thinking about making something since football season started and came upon this recipe, which was PERFECT :) My husband LOVED it.  I did add ground cumin, garlic powder, sea salt, ground black pepper, refried beans,jalepenos & rotissere chicken as other suggested.  It's a KEEPER :)

Didn't really care for the taste of these, though they were easy to make. Seemed quite boring, and not the fun nacho recipe I was looking for.

Made this recipe as written and it was definately missing something. It was rather bland and kind of dry. Maybe adding taco seasoning mix as others suggest would help. I will look for another recipe for my future nachos.

This was delicious....and VERY easy!  I cooked one large chicken breast on my george forman grill.  Shredded the chicken and threw it in the saute pan with the garlic, white part of the onion and some jalapenos for an extra kick.

I fixed this for the Super Bowl, OMG, what a wonderful dish. I used ground beef instead of chicken, and everyone ate the whole thing. It's a meal in itself. The kids really liked it and now said I should fix it every weekend.

These were good, but benefited from some changes.  I heated up a can of black beans and added those before baking, as well as sliced black olives and avocado.  Topped with sour cream.  The bottom tortilla chips were a little soggy, but that's only because of all the delicious and flavorful toppings.  If you don't mind eating nachos with a fork and knife, you'll love these!

I tried this recipe yesterday and it was really good, I changed a few things though... adding cilantro and chopped green onions to the top after baking, and topping with sour cream.  I trippled the chicken, doubled the salsa, and reduced the cheese a little (using what I had on hand)it was really good, very tasty.  The salsa keeps it moist and flavorful!  Definately a repeat pupu dish in our home.

I followed the recipe to a "t"! Hubby and I ate it for dinner. It was wonderful and easy. I think we will be adding to our list of normal dinners. IT is also easy on the pocket book. I just roasted a whole chicken the night before. I had all the ingredients already. The rest only took a little bit of time to just through together. Thanks!

I tried this based on the reviews, however, I can only give it three stars.  I made the nachos as directed but found the salsa to be the only flavor. It doesn't make sense to give 5 stars for store bought salsa.

I cut my chicken into small pieces & cooked in olive oil with largly chopped pieces of onion.  I then sprinkled in part of a package of fajita seasoning.  I added some taco seasoning to a can of refried beans and think that using the whole can was too much on the refried beans.  I used On The Boarder tortilla chips & warmed in oven prior to putting the stuff on & our chips were not soggy at all.  Next time would use only half of a can of beans & would add more cheese (used Kraft Mexican cheese blend).  I also think I should have added more stuff, but I'm so darn picky so I didn't add tomatoes nor green onion.  Would say they were good though & I would make again.

Awesome nachos!!  This recipe was very easy to make and tasted really good.  It could have used a little more "zing" and I see other posters used jalepeno peppers.  I will try this next time.  Also thought hot or medium salsa would work too.  I like the idea of black beans also.  Will certainly make again! Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but I thought the salsa tasted weird baked in the oven. I would prefer salsa to be on the side and served cold. Picked up a cooked chicken breast at the deli, served with sour cream, pickled jalepenos and homemade guacamole.

I loved this!  I used chicken I had made and froze from Lime Chicken Soft Tacos recipe from this site.  All I had to do was thaw it and mix a little Frank's Red Hot with Lime in it.  Then I heated it with the salsa.  I didn't need to add any garlic and green onions because the chicken has enough flavor.  I also made my own chips by baking flour tortillas cut into wedges. I sprayed them with cooking spray and baked them at 350 for 20 min. flipping them after 10 min.  I then topped them with the chicken/salsa mix then taco seasoned cheese and baked another 5 or so minutes until cheese was melted.  I served them with extra salsa and sour cream. My husband really liked them and we will be making them again and again.

These nachos were GREAT!!!! It was like being at a restaurant. As we are stationed overseas and have limited places to eat, we were thrilled to taste something that reminded us of home.

Pretty good, but not what I was expecting, but everyone still liked it.  We had some leftovers and re-heated in the oven the next day, and to my surprise it still tasted good!

The taste was great, but the chips wound up being soft/soggy.  We reccomend only cooking them for 7-8 minutes rather than the full ten minutes.

Since it's been so warm, I decided to make these as a light, summer, dinner. They turned out so good! I added some jalapenos on top for extra spice, but I loved the mixture. After all, I had always made nachos with just chips, cheese, and the microwave before! Very good.

So good. We did have any green onions on hand so we left that out. But it was still better than restaurant nachos, in my opinion.

I used two cans of chicken breast (5 oz each) and a little taco seasoning (like 1/4 of a packet) I served it with some sour cream and we all thought it was very good.

I can see why these are called "restaurant style" because they truly taste like nachos you'd get in a restaurant.  
I used a rotisserie chicken from the deli, but otherwise made no changes.  Delicious just how it is!

These are great.  I added the salsa to some refried beans and put the beans on the tortilla chips and cooked my chicken breast with some taco seasoning.  I put the tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole on the side! These were a nice alternative to eating out.

These were very good.  My only addition was a little cumin to the chicken, but other than that I kept everything else the same.  My kids really liked these and already asked for them again on next week's menu!

Bravo!  These were delicious! I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and I served this with refried beans.  My whole family loved it, including my 7 year-old who's pretty picky.

WOW!!! This recipe was absolutely wonderful! I didn't heat the chips beforehand like others, so maybe I will try that next time...one of the chips was "dissolved" under the tasty topping. But oh what a wonderful topping it was. I cooked the chicken with taco seasoning, but I'm sure you could use any leftover chicken for this recipe. The flavor of the green onions and garlic are absolutely heavenly. I used Medium salsa, so mine had a little kick to it. My husband doesn't care for spicy foods, so next time I'll use Mild Salsa. I forgot to add japs, but I really didn't need to. These nachos were bursting with flavor. Laura, how did you come up with this one? It is toooo good! I would have made more, only I ran out of cheese (which I LOADED up on these nachos...almost a whole 8 oz pack for the recipe which I halved). YUMMY!!! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This was good.  I added refried beans to the chicken mixture and also put some black olives and jalepenos on top before baking because I didn't have a tomato.  The chips were very crispy.  It would be great with sour cream and guacamole, but it would add too many more calories.

These chicken nachos are SO tasty and SO easy to make. I made them last night (3rd time) and added black beans to mine. Nice addition.

The second time I made them, I forgot to add the salsa to the chicken mixture, so I put it on last. This actually prevented the chips from getting soggy, so I think it was a good thing I forgot.

I tried this recipe for a boxing day party and it was a big hit. I used taco seasoning for the chicken and it tasted great. The only thing I would change is the shredded cheese.  I found I grated it too fine and it burnt a bit on the edges. Next time I will use a bigger size grater.  Will definitely make again.

I followed other reviewers advice and baked the chips a couple of minutes before putting the chicken mixture on them. The chips were still soggy. I used regular onion instead of green onions and used fajita seasoning on the chicken. Other than the chips being soggy they were pretty good. These are good for satisfying a nacho craving.

Sometimes I use BBQ sauce instead of salsa just to change it up a bit. Great recipe!!

Good. Definitely a quick serve and eat meal. Nachos can get soggy.
