This was so delicious and quite refreshing combination of flavors! We made this salsa while beach camping, went wonderfully on top of our Fast Salmon with a Ginger Glaze from Allrecipes. I did throw in an avocado that needed to be used. A great summertime salsa...thanks Mauigirl...sorry no photo when camping..next time though. :)

Love this salsa.  Adding a little fresh pineapple to the mixture really works well.  We enjoy this with grilled fish.

I used white pineapple and our patio-grown jalapeños. The peppers were my 4th harvest from last fall's plants, and were REALLY HOT! So I added about 1tbls brown sugar to tame the heat. Served it over Hawaiian Chicken and Lime Cilantro Rice. Perfection! Thanks for another winner, Mauigirl!

ERMERGERD Folks, this is SO delicious! I love the addition of ginger to the recipe.

A tiny bit less lime juice for me and a sprinkle of pink Himalayan salt or smoky black flaked Hawaiian salt deepens the flavor profile. I've also added grilled pineapple, peaches and avocado at different times depending on what I have on hand.

Why, oh why can't I live somewhere I can have a mango tree?

Made day before party.  It was fabulous.  Tried it with a little pineapple added, also...that was great too!  Can't wait for more mangoes to ripen so I can make more!

I had some fresh pineapple to use and ran across this by accident when searching for something else.  I had some grilled chicken and decided to try this (leaving out the cilantro since I don't like it).  It was great!  When grilling season rolls around to stay, I will make this often.

Wow is about all I can say. I made the first bowl, later that day I had to make the second one. The name should be the Incredible Disappearing Mango Salsa. Put the second batch on some grilled pork chops. I'm a fan!

I was trying to duplicate the mango salsa recipe from my local stores deli and this recipe came very close.  It was refreshing and tropical.  Tried it on chips and ground turkey tacos.  It would be excellent on shrimp or fish tacos.  Next time.

First Time making a salsa and this one came out soooooo good. The market was out of ginger so I added a little Rosemary, thyme and peppermint! All the flavors so complimentary and I followed the squeeze the juice from the pit of the mango suggestion!!! Would make it again for a larger crowd!!

Very good and fresh. It didn't need to sit over night, it was still good after 30 minutes of refrigerating it!
