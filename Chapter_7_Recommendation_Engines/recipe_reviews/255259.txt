Homemade Chili Haiku: "Not sure it's 'homemade' when ingredients are canned. But dang, is it good!" I halved the recipe for 2 adults and 2 kiddos, using a can of Rotel and one 15 oz. can of tomato sauce instead of the puree and made it in advance, letting it simmer in the dutch oven for an afternoon, tucking it into the fridge, then re-simmering next day b4 serving with cheese and Frito scoops. Nothing outstanding about this chili but maybe that's why we ate all of it up with no complaints. It's just a good, easy, basic chili. Can't wait for cooler Fall temperatures so we can have it again.

This was AMAZING! cooked on low for 4.5 hours in a 5 quart crockpot. Added a little extra cumin and chili powder. Had 2.3 lbs of ground beef. Also used one can kidney beans and 1 can cannelini beans. The combo was very good. Will make this often!

I was looking for a healthy chili and came across this one. I used extra lean beef, mixed beans instead of just kidney, I added an extra tbsp of chill powder and tsp of cayenne to spice it up a bit. It's a great slow cook meal that tastes better the longer it goes. Loved it the next day too! Thanks Healthy Girl, we'll make this one again.

Made recipe as is and was well received. It was not too spicy, so  those who liked  more heat added hot sauce.

I used shallots  instead of onions. Also added a few tbsps of Tabasco, and white beans, in addition to the red beans. Served it with Mexican blended shredded cheese, cast iron skillet cornbread and Sierra Nevada Torpedo IPAs. Great Sunday evening meal!

Good chili recipe. I only had a pound of beef so I halved the spices. I also didnâ€™t add beans to my chili.

Well it was my first batch of chili, that I've made in a really long time. I did substitute a few items,I used turkey and hot Italian sausage and peppered thick sliced bacon. I like my chili hot so I added habanero peppers and serrano peppers and black beans with red peppers and onions. This was a great recipe and it was relatively easy and I'm not very good in the kitchen. And not to mention easy clean up to boot.
