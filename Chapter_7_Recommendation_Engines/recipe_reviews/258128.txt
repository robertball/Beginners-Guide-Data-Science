Made this as written and it turned out good. The carrots made it a little bit too sweet for my liking but I'm guessing the kiddos would love that about it. I really enjoyed the celery flavor and next time I will put more. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I also add chopped spinach and butternut squash. you cannot taste any of these and my children ate spaghetti and this sauce every day, add as much meat as you want!
