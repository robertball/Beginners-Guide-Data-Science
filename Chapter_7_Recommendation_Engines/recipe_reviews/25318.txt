I think next time I'll use a little less pasta and possibly add some zucchini.  Overall, very good.
Edited: 2/19/08  I made this again.  This time I used less pasta and added zucchini and black beans.  Much better!

I'm a brand new cook (talkin' about someone who cuts herself almost every time she chops) who had no trouble preparing this. I almost clapped my hands and jumped up and down when I tasted it. The flavors are great, and the dish as a whole is very satisfying, probably because of the chickpeas. Thank you for submitting this one.

I, personally, would rate this 4 stars because I had to add a lot more seasoning.  However, I am giving it a five because my 22-month-old loved this dish.  I didn't even try to give him some, but he took his spoon and dug in, eating all of the ingredients and saying "Yum".  Wow!  That is coming from a toddler who will not eat any vegetables at all!

I am not a vegeterian but needed to make something for a friend that is.  This was sooooooo easy and came out tasting very fresh and flavorful!  I added some yellow squash and sprinkled it with Pepper-Jack cheese instead of the Monterey Jack.

Super easy to make, adjust to whatever you have in the kitchen. I used shell pasta because it's what I had, and just threw in the whole 16 oz bag and it was still great. The flavors are excellent, home-style, quick and easy dinner that isn't too bad for you. The pepper-jack is really iceing on the cake if you can afford the calories.

This is one of my favorite pasta dishes to cook! I ran out of chili powder, so tonight I used 2 Tbsp taco seasoning instead. I cut back on the cumin and used only 1/2 tsp, since there is some in the taco seasoning. I used rotini pasta and topped it with cheddar cheese. This always turns out great, my bf and daughter always ask for seconds. Thanks for the great recipe!

I just wanted to say "thank you, thank you, thank you!" for this recipe.  This is one of my favourite recipes of all time.  My kids, husband and I are all vegetarians and we're always looking for something that appeals to all palates and is healthy as well.  This fit the bill.  I loved it so much I invited my in-laws to lunch just so I could make it again!

This was really tasty and filling.  I was surprised because most of the time, I don't find vegetarian dishes that filling.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.

I found this to be a good starting point for a dish you can play with to meet your own tastes. I've had better success serving it with brown rice than with pasta though.

I came home from work and realized i didn't pull any meat out that morning so i went to Allrecipes to find something that i had the ingredients for. This is what i made. I followed the recipe exact but i wasn't crazy about it. I was happy to use the chick peas that had been in my cabnit for awhile but that is what threw me off and that it seemed a little bland. I will say it was alot better reheated the next day for lunch and it does look good.

I have just recently started cooking mostly vegetarian meals, and I decided to give this one a try.  I was pleased with the flavor, although I did add some chipotle hot sauce for an extra kick.  I also add some chopped fresh cilantro.  It was very good, and my husband told me to keep it in my recipe collection.

This recipe lacked just a little bit of flavor.  The second time I made this, I tweaked it so much that I just made up a whole new recipe.

Very good.  Sauce is flavorful.  I added extra onions and green peppers.  I also used two different types of pasta.  A keeper!

A simple spicy pasta dish for vegetarians and those who don't want to eat as much meat. I like how it has chick peas aka garbanzo beans. Look for garbanzo beans at the grocery store, because I couldn't find chick peas.

My husband and I have opted to reduce, if not eliminate, the amount of meat in our diets. I came across this recipe and had some form or another of all the ingredients on hand. It came out great! Even my one year old devoured it. I didn't have jack cheese so I used sharp cheddar as a topping instead. I removed kernels from left over corn on the cob instead of frozen corn and used homemade chickpeas instead of canned. It would also taste great with black beans.

Delicious! I used fresh diced tomatoes, and added some salsa. So yummy!

I made this all the time and love it! However, I always make to much sauce and freeze it. I now started using the sauce in Quesadillas with cheese!

This is such a tasty, easy meal! The spices are fantastic (although I looove cumin, so I threw in a little extra) and it mixes with the corn and chickpeas so well. I'd recommend using the Green Giant white shoepeg corn. It adds a crunchy sweetness. Overall an incredible recipe!

This is my standby for when we have guests, as it's easy, delicious, and I don't generally have to worry about dietary restrictions when I make it. Always well-loved and well-received, this is one of our favourite recipes!

I am not a hard person to please, but this was very bland. I took it to a dinner party, because some friends of mine are vegetarian. Most of it was gone, but I can't say that I enjoyed it.

This recipe is a fast chile with lots of noodles.  I was disappointed because the chile seasoning was too strong and overpowered the cumin and chick peas.  I also added one small chile pepper so that may have added to the spice.  I don't think I will make this again.

I made this with black beans as I didn't have chickpeas and I thought it was quite good and had just the right amount of spice.  I would highly recommend the black beans over the chickpeas.

This was a lot better as "leftovers" the next day.  And there was a LOT leftover!!  Im a vegetarian so I didnt miss the meat but did feel like something was missing from this.  Black olives would be a nice addition.  I doubt I will make this again.

Really good.  I think I did the proportions wrong though -- too much pasta in our servings.  Probably a 50/50 combo is the best!

I liked it, even though the chickpeas gave it an odd texture. I thought it was different and unique. My hubby hated it though, so I probably won't make it again.

Used olive oil to saute. Wasn't sure if I should drain beans or not. Glad I used the water in them too makes it saucey,used petite cut tomatoes with juice. I don't change recipes much the first time but i did use whole wheat pasta and less of like others said. GREAT recipe will make again. Beef or chicken could be added to this if want non veg :)

This was really yummy and very easy to make. I did not have chick peas so used garbanzo beans instead - still yummy.   Easy recipe to tweak: add more spices if you want more of a kick, less pasta if you want it saucier.  But the original recipe is really good.

This was a good and simple pasta dish recipe! We followed the directions except using canned corn instead of frozen. It was easy to make and I liked the way all of the ingredients combined. We will make this again!

Good quick recipe for kids, 3.5 stars. I used olive oil instead of veg. oil, doubled the garlic, didn't have green peppers so substituted mushrooms, added a can of tomato paste, added a bit of brown sugar, salt and chopped cilantro. Due to dairy/wheat allergies omitted cheese and used brown rice pasta. The recipe was not spicy at all, so kids enjoyed it(3&7 year old).

Really delicious and super easy to make!  I didn't have enough chili powder, so I'm looking forward to making this recipe when it has enough "spice" in it.  I used whole wheat pasta and reduced fat cheese, which made this recipe pretty guilt-free.

This dish was ok, but like everyone else it's missing something.  If I make it again I will add some black beans, cilantro and pepperjack cheese.  Maybe some Boca meat.

I'm a big fan of this recipe - with a few tweaks. I skip the pasta and serve it over a little rice instead. Several people have commented that it's bland, but a small handful of fresh cilantro on top adds some great flavor, and don't be shy with the chili powder and cumin!

Sooo good!  I followed the recipe exactly except for using whole grain rotini pasta in place of the elbow macaroni.  My husband was out of town and missed out, but my oldest kids (ages 3, 5,& 7) and I all thought this was a very yummy and healthy winter meal.

This was OK. We couldn't figure out what it needed--pepper jack cheese? green chiles? olives? I still plan to work on this. With hot sauce, however, and a little sour cream, it improved.

It is easy and tasty.  I didn't have frozen corn so I used canned corn (drained).  
My 80 year old mother-in-law loved it and it wasn't too spicy for her sensitive stomach.
This recipe makes alot for 2 people.

This recipe had an incredible taste.  Some of the directions seemed unclear.  Was I supposed to drain the chickpeas or use the liquid.  I drained them and found there wasn't enough liquid so I ended up adding water to it.  I mixed up some homemade biscuits to go with the pasta dish.  Hubby asked me to make this again and I will happily comply!

Absolutely delicious!  So few ingredients yet, so much flavor.  I served this with a dollop of low-fat ricotta (because I'm a cheese-lover) and used pepperjack on top to add some kick.  Great recipe!

This recipe is great - super easy and quick, plus a lot of protein and flavor. The only change I made was to add a can of black beans at the same time as the corn and chickpeas. Otherwise, it’s good as written!

It's OK. Makes a ton of food. Even after feeding both of us, and saving a large container, I had to throw a bunch away. 

Flavor is mild. Could use more seasonings. While it was OK, my taste buds didn't jump up and down with joy, so this won't be made too often.

Easy to make. Really spicy though. Would use 1 tablespoon of chilli powder next time and maybe 1/2 the chickpeas but a yummy recipe enjoyed by the whole family.

Made this and it was just okay, nothing special. Not sure I'd make it again. It just lacked flavor. If I make it again I'll have to add a few other things.

This is amazing!! I make it all the time for me family. My meat-loving fiancé and my 1 year old eat it up! If you looking for something quick and delicious, try this out!!

The only thing I do differently is that I use a bit more corn then called for, and that I switch up the type of noodles to what I have on hand at the type.

I have made this and it was fast, easy, all the items needed for the recipe were on hand. My husband is not much of a vegetarian,  but for health reasons, I have to be. He found this recipe tasty and delicious. So everyone is happy!

Very good and filling.  My husband and I both agreed it might be good and easier to eat if we put it in a tortilla and make it a quesadilla instead of with the pasta.

I've made this twice and put one away in the freezer to see if it froze well. Taste is good, doesn't feel like a vegetarian meal, and the frozen casserole tasted just as good as the fresh.

Great recipe... Reduced the chili powder to 1.5 tsp, added one sliced zucchini and substituted cheddar cheese. Everyone loved it!

Made it exactly as written and we both loved it.  Definitely a keeper, especially for vegetarians, but my occasional carnivore husband gave it 5 stars.

The combination of the tomatoes and corn was nice, but I felt like the chick peas were a little random. Black beans might be more suited to the flavors. I had to cut the chili powder in half because I'm cooking for a three year old; I'm sure it would have been more flavorful had I used the whole amount, but I also think the chili powder might have drowned out the tomato and corn flavors, which I liked a lot. Overall, this was fine, but not spectacular, and I don't think I'll make it again. Thanks anyway!

We accidentally used a bit extra pasta but it turned out great. It definitely was more than 6 servings worth!

After reading others' comments, I tweaked this a bit by adding 2 sliced Italian sausages, 1 tsp of hot sauce, the chopped leaves of 1-2 sprigs of cilantro, and a pinch of salt, to step 1. Tasted great !

I've been trying to make more vegetarian meals for the family. I followed this recipe to a T and it was tolerable but not great. It was missing something, I'm not sure what... next time I might add meat like past reviews have suggested?

I don't know why the others had problems with it turning out dry or with no flavor.  I added a little less chili powder and I'll admit that I did add sliced sausage and it was really good.  Everyone loved it and I'll definitely make this again.

This disk was just okay for me. I had to make a large batch so it was a little dry. Flavor was just okay. I agree that it needed something or maybe I'm just not used to vegetarian cooking. Probably won't make again.

This was good, but there seemed to be something missing.  Maybe I'm not used to vegetarian dishes, but I would probably add chicken to it if I remade this.
