This was pretty good. I do think it would benefit with some of the veggies the recipe submitter mentioned and I will definitely add some the next time I make this. If nothing else, I recommend adding spring onions. I also recommend letting the pork marinate for at least 30 minutes. I did and it was super tender and full of flavor. This one is a keeper!
