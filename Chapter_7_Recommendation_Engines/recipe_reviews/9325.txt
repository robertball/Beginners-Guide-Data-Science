This is by far the BEST HAM LOAF recipe ever.  The only change I made was to add some pineapple juice to the glaze, and lay three pineapple slices on the loaf before baking.

I replaced the ground beef with ground pork, but otherwide followed the recipe exactly.  A great family dinner, a nice change from regular beef meatloaf.  My family loved it.

Made this with leftover holiday ham and froze most of it for meals later. Family loves the unique flavors and I have to say it's a great change to normal meatloaf!

Followed the recipe as it was written but my loaf was dry and fell apart when I sliced it.  The taste was fine.

Ham loaf is one of those meats that I only fix 2-3 times a year, but when I do fix it, we really enjoy it.  I halved this recipe as I only had 1.5 pounds of meat, but I did use a whole egg.  I used homemade bread crumbs as the filler.  A MUST to ham loaf is the glaze that it bakes in.  Most recipes will all contain:  brown sugar, water, ground mustard & vinegar.  I did use apple cider vinegar rather than white as I think the taste is stronger.  This baked up well and was enjoyed by DH & DS and I.

It was very tasty, though I did find the sauce to be quite runny.  I would probably add less water next time.  I used 1lb ground ham and 1lb ground beef, and I had to cook for about 1 1/2 hours.

Great recipe using up my leftover ham. Minced the ham using my food processor for the right consistency. Meatloaf came out moist and tasty and had no problems with it falling apart. I thought I would have too much sauce but when you boil it for the time called for before topping the meatloaf it wasn't as much. I kept ours in the oven just a touch too long and my sauce mostly disappeared but the meat came out perfect. A nice blend of both kinds of meat. Will keep this one on rotation!

Wonderful! The taste took me back to my childhood, when my mom would make ham loaf!
