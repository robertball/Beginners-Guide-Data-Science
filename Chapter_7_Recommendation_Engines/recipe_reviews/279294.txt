This is a great basic recipe. I added black beans & a couple shakes of Tobasco. It was awesome!

I doubled the recipe and used already roasted chicken breast. Itâ€™s delicious and very easy to make!

This was a very simple quick recipe with a boatload of flavor. Was a hit in my house. Beans ( black and pinto) make it extra hearty.
