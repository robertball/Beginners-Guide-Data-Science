Wow, this recipe really complemented my meal!  I found I needed to add more flour to make the dough the right consistency, and after putting the toppings on at the end, I put them back in the oven for 1 minute to melt the Parmesan cheese.  Worked great.  Thanks for an easy and delicious bread stick!  So much better than store-bought...I may even try freezing some to have on hand, but I'd need to make another batch.  This first batch didn't last past one meal at my house.  :)

Soft, sweet breadsticks just the way I like them...the author says these are as close to the Olive Garden ones as she has tasted and I agree whole heartedly - I spray the tops if mine with water to get them nice and brown and then put the melted butter on immediately...also, i put whole cloves of garlic and a pinch of cayenne in the butter instead of garlic salt to give the butter a nice infused garlic flavor - it is worth mentioning that i live on a boat and make my recipes in a small Force Ten propane oven...our part of the marina always smells like fresh bread and tasty treats

This is a very delicious light and fluffy breadstick. Best breadstick recipe I have found!As other suggested I did reduce the sugar because I wanted more of a savory than a  sweet bread. I also added about three-quarter cups extra flour. After waiting five minutes for the yeast and the sugar to foam up then I added the remaining bread ingredients into my KitchenAid stand mixer bowl and put on the hook attachment and let it run for about 6 minutes.  It came out as perfect bread dough. I added fresh rosemary and Italian seasonings to my bread dough. This recipe is very flexible you can add your own seasonings to taste.

Love these! Simple enough, but I don't think they require half a stick of butter.

These were very soft and good, but a bit too sweet for my taste.    Also, I only used 1/4 c. of butter for the tops.

I had to add more than a cup of flour before I was even able to start kneading. There was way too much sugar and half a stick of butter would have been plenty. I may try to use this recipe again but it would probably be as dinner rolls.

This is the recipe I will use for bread sticks from now on.  Very yummy!  Embarrassed to say the 5 of us almost polished off the whole recipe.  More flour, less butter would make it a five star recipe.

Turned out just like the photo, and it was good, but a little too sweet for me.  I'd leave out sugar, except the little bit that goes into the yeast & water.

These are good and straight forward to make.  I found them to be a bit too sweet for me, so I think that next time I will use less sugar.  Also, there was too much melted butter, and not enough salt on top.  I did use unsalted butter so that might have been part of the reason.  I used fresh grated parmesan and again it was great.  I will make it again, using the adjustments that I just made.  I do think that they are worth trying if you are looking for a good breadstick recipe.

I will make these again. After reading the other reviews I decided not to add sugar other than what goes in the yeast. These were great! Soft on the inside and really tender.

They taste like restaurant breadsticks, I, like some other people only used 1/4 cup of butter. I also used a special pan which does not let the bottoms brown as much.

Per other reviews, I used slightly less sugar. I also use Hodgsen Mill Fast Rise yeast which comes in 5/16 oz package instead of 1/4 oz. I used less butter for the topping; used fresh grated garlic and a sprinkling of Kosher salt in place of the garlic salt. The dough required MUCH more flour than 2 1/2 cups. These baked up beautifully, were fluffy and delicious. Best eaten right away. If eaten the next day, warm in the microwave 10 seconds to refresh. Yum!

Made according to recipe. The bread on the counter during kneading adds about 1 more cup of flour. Perfectly soft.

Easy, and very good.  We put string cheese in the middle and they were great.  We only used about half the sugar.

I thought this recipe was really easy and the breadsticks turned out soft and smooth looking. The butter mixture for the top was the perfect flavor.  I have tried many breadsticks recipes and been disappointed in flavor or appearance and was hesitant to try again. I will definitely be making these again.

Changes: had to add an extra cup of flour before the dough was actually workable (and even then it was still a bit sticky); used parchment paper instead of greasing the trays; I don't buy garlic salt so just kind of mixed in the amount of salt and garlic I thought it needed, I rarely measure spices anyway; needed less butter than called for, not even a 1/4 cup. These are wonderfully soft rolls (I'm sorry, I just can't call them bread sticks, bread sticks are crunchy!). I've never been to Olive Garden so can't say if they taste the same or not. They are indeed very sweet (even for me!) which makes for an odd pairing with the garlic butter and parmesan cheese on top, but I will definitely be making them again and either leaving off the garlic/cheese (if I want a sweet roll) or halving the sugar.

This recipe was so perfect! But, if anyone wants to up it, I added Italian seasoning and basil to the dough. And, added it to the garlic/butter that I brushed on as well. I also used parchment paper as opposed to greasing a pan. Very fluffy and tasty.

Made as directed and found them a little  too sweet and too much butter for our taste.  But made again with a reduction in both and they were WONDERFUL!!!

Although these breadsticks were okay they were just too sweet and fluffy. We prefer a more dense bread. It all comes down to preference...these weren't for us.

As other reviewers said, I had to add more flour to get the right consistency and I changed the amount of sugar to only what is added to the yeast...other than that, stuck with the recipe.  These are my favorite food now....BETTER than Olive Garden.   Everyone who ate them loved them.

OMG! These were soooooo good and sooooo easy to make. I used a gas oven and had to bake for about 15 minutes longer @ 200 C. Very soft and very flavorful. I also had to use much more flour than called for as the dough was still gooey, I'm at sea level and it was a rainy day, so that may have had a bit to do with it. I used Johnny's Garlic Spread and Seasoning in place of the garlic salt and parm cheese.

DELICIOUS! So soft, fluffy and buttery-garlic good! I did need to add a bit more flour than called for, but that was fine (I halved the recipe and needed an extra 1/2 cup of flour or so). Very easy to make and the family gobbled them up...a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
