Okay pancakes; I might make these again. I read the reviews before making them and the only things I would say is that if you're like me and you have the "just add water" kind of pancake mixes (the kind that doesn't require eggs or oil, etc), you might NOT want to use all the milk in the recipe. The addition of the eggs and applesauce thinned the batter down considerably. Good thing I added the milk a little bit at a time, and didn't need to use all of it in the end; it would have been a very runny batter otherwise. I would also cut down on the cinnamon, as I would've liked to have tasted more of the apple flavor. I think the name is misleading; these should be called cinnamon pancakes. From the name, I was expecting more of an apple flavor. Maybe next time I'll add some fresh, thinly sliced apples to the mix.

One of the reviewers gave the most helpful tip:  Do NOT use a "just add water" pancake mix.  Use a "real" pancake mix.  Also, the lemon juice makes a big difference, IMO.

My kids really liked these.  We used cinnamon applesauce, left out the lemon juice (didn't have any) and used Krusteaz Buttermilk mix.  I did add just a little extra milk to make up for not using the lemon juice.   Thank you Shirley!

these were yummy. not overly sweet and with the syrup I made to put on top, the pancakes were not sweet like regular pancakes & syrup.

Made a Cinnamon Apple Syrup to put on them that I found in my taste of home cookbook: 2T. cornstarch, 1/2t. cinnamon, 1/8t. salt, 1c. water, 3/4c. apple juice concentrate & 1/2t. vanilla.

Amazing! I made these exactly as specified and they were wonderful. Very hearty and filling, but with a wonderful light flavor. I used unsweetened applesauce and 1 % milk, with Krusteaz buttermilk mix, and the recipe made 13 1/4-cup pancakes that were only 60 calories each. And they were extremely easy to make. I can see (as other reviewers suggest) adding more milk to make them lighter, but they were also great as is. Thank you!

I used the Homemade Pancake Mix from this site because I used all my off-brand pancake mix several months back. I used sour milk and an organic blueberry applesauce I bought cheaply at Grocery Outlet. I served it with Homemade Pancake Syrup, which is also from this site. My kids inhaled them. There were some leftover, so I froze them two a piece in freezer bags. All I have to do is heat them in the toaster next morning I'm short on time. EDITED REVIEW: I have made these pancakes many times now. One of my favorite ways to make it is using homemade apple butter in place of the apple sauce with my homemade pancake mix. My whole family loves it. There's rarely any leftovers.

I highly recommend these pancakes!  I doubled the recipe as there are 5 of us and it only called for 4 servings.  These pancakes are very filling, and make quite a bit, so sticking with the original might have been okay!  I did add about 1/3 cup more milk as my hubby hates thick pancakes.  (I have been through numerous pancake recipes trying to find one he would like)  They ended up still being very thick.  But to my delight he said these were his absolute favorite pancakes.  And as an added bonus they made the house smell wonderful!  I will definately keep this recipe!!  Thank You!

Shirley - your mother is a genius! I rarely use store-bought pancake mix but the mix sits in my cupboard and this is an awesome way to use it up! These were terriffic!! We LOVED them! I did add a tsp of vanilla and used just a touch more of milk.  They turned out fluffy, flavorful and make for a darn good breakfast!! Many thanks for this recipe!!

These are good pancakes and I will make them again. I also agree with the lady that said, people should stop changing the recipes and then giving them a bad rating. My wife does the same thing and it drives me crazy. If it calls for 1/2 cup of evaperated milk, she will use 2% and then say these do not taste good and wonder why. JUST DRIVES ME NUTS !! Pleaqse try the recipes as they are written, or don't bother to rate it.

Didn't even have to think about the 5 rating I gave this one!! It is, without a doubt, the BEST pancakes I have ever had! I thought the recipe I usually make was, but this is even better. The only thing I did different was add a little more milk, because the batter was too thick. I topped them with cinnabutter, the recipe that I also got on this site. Even my picky 1 year old, that doesn't normally eat pancakes, went for these. Thank you sooo much Shirley for sharing this recipe. I can see why it was always requested at your house!!

Used Bisquick and made the recipe exactly as written. But yah, it was too thick and I did feel compelled to add a little more milk, and why the batter burned so easily I'm not sure but I had to turn the heat down lower than I normally would for pancakes and certainly lower than the medium high called for in the recipe, flavor wasn't bad but it wasn't especially special for us.. Sigh..just sayin'..

My family LOVES these pancakes...I have made them twice a month, since discovering this recipe last summer! I substitute fresh buttermilk in place of the lemon juice, and I add nutmeg. WONDERFUL recipe, thanks so much for sharing!!!

They were very moist and browned beautifully. I made a 1/2 recipe and the kids really liked it. I think some chunky applesauce or even finely diced apples would enhance the flavor even more. Will try it again next time. Thank you Shirley!

So easy and so delicious - perfect for a Sunday breakfast! I used lowfat buttermilk vs. the lemon juice and regular milk and added a pinch of nutmeg.  These are great with REAL Maple syrup but absolutely fabulous with "Satueed Apples" from this site! Thanks for a great recipe!

I used Mott’s cinnamon-applesauce and Krusteaz buttermilk pancake mix. I left out the lemon juice, added buttermilk instead, a little bit at a time and blended the batter. The batter was very thick so I added a little more buttermilk to loosen it up. It smelled great while cooking and I ended up with 10 average (medium) size pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy and cinnamon-y flavorful. They were not overly sweet and very filling. I believe the applesauce helped to make the pancakes moist and light but there is no noticeable “apple” flavor.  Maybe next time I should add apple juice and some fresh, thinly sliced apples to the mix for a more pronounced apple flavor. I topped these pancakes by adding "Sauteed Apples,” also from this website (see my picture in the photo gallery). They complimented the applesauce pancakes nicely!

What a delicious & unique flavor! I just made these for my 2 year old and I, and I think with a different pankcake mix I should get these perfect. All I had was Hungry Jack Extra Light and Fluffy (just add water) pancake mix, which is probably why they weren't as dense. I did end up needing all the milk as written, but I would advise to add it gradually as another person said, if you're using just add water mix. Great recipe & I will make these again.

I have made these pancakes three times, and I love them more each time! I recommend using baking mix in place of pancake mix.  Bisquick is what I have always used, and they turn out fluffy and delicious every time.  They are even great reheated in the microwave the next day.

Wonderful! I agreed with other reviewers in that you need to use 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 1/4 cups applesauce, and 3/4 cup milk (skim milk works just fine).  They do cook quickly, so don't wait for bubbles.  Note that if you buy the "complete" pancake mix (i.e., you just add water, no eggs), then you don't need to add eggs in this recipe.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.....I make a homemade version similiar to this recipe but without a mix.  Using a pancake mix is helpful especially out camping.  Our pancake mix is the "just add water" kind, so I just omitted the eggs.  The applesauce takes the place of the fats.  The only other thing I added was a 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. My kids love this version...they eat them without the syrup. Thanks for sharing.

DON'T USE UNSWEETENED APPLESAUCE.  I did this and it turned out rather bland.  I will try again, though, using sweetened.

This was a pleasant change from our usual pancakes.  They have nice flavor, however I found the cinnamon overpowers the apple flavor.  I would add chopped apple the next time I make them. The pancakes brown very quickly so I would cook them at a little lower heat than standard pancakes.

These were okay, very light and fluffy but a tiny bit bland.  I exchanged the cinnamon for brown sugar (I don't care for cinnamon) and added chocolate chips, I also halved the recipe, which worked very well.  
I would make these again.

I made these for Sunday Brunch today.  They came out perfect.  The apple flavor was first rate.  Please be aware that not all applesauce is created equal.  Check your applesauce before using. The amount of water between different brands and homemade can can cause you problems.  The flavor between brands can be very different,  I used fresh homemade from the night before, but always check for flavor.

We really liked these pancakes! I used Snoqualmie Falls Lodge Pancake & Waffle Mix, cut the cinnamon in half because my home made applesauce already had cinnamon in it, and used just 3/4 cup applesauce because that was all that I had that was thawed out (I freeze my applesauce). I started with 1/2 cup milk, but had to add more because the batter was too thick. It's a personal preference as to how you like your batter; just adjust the amount of milk you use. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were super delicious and my wife absolutely loved them.  I did as well.  I will definitely be making these again.  I thought that all of the ingredients listed were at the right consistance; maybe another 1/4 cup of applesauce but still awesome the way that it is written.  When I grease the pan I use shortening as it gives a nice, crispier outside.

This recipe is a great pancake base when using a mix! I followed the recipe but made one change, I used Pumpkin instead of applesauce. I also had to increase the skim milk to 3/4 cup. But they were super yummy!

Delicious!  I also only used 1/2 tsp cinnamon and it was just enough.  We only had chunky applesauce on hand and it ws perfectly fine incase anyone else is stuck in the same situation.  These were quite filling and agree that it would sufficiently serve 4 adults.  Definitely a do-again recipe.

I just made these pancakes and they are delicious.  I took the advice of some and put in an additional 1/4 of a cup of milk and an additional 1/4 cup of applesauce.  I also put in 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I found it necessary to thin out with water until I was happy with the consistency.  They are so fluffy and moist.  Such a treat.  The children topped theirs with syrup.  I put applesauce on top of mine because the pancake was already pretty sweet because I added about 2 Tbsp. of sugar to the dry ingredients.  I put in a dash of vanilla, too.  Thanks Shirley!

These are so yummy! We are a pancake eatin' family so I'm always looking for new recipes. At first I thought this sounded too simple to really be good but tried it anyway-boy, am I glad!! I usually make them as the recipe's written but have always thought about adding some finely chopped pecans.

Stellar flavor! I used Krusteaz add water only mix, so I omitted the eggs per another reviewer's suggestion. I followed the recipe otherwise exactly and while the batter was thick I just made sure to spread it out evenly on the griddle. Thank you so much for submitting this, it's my new favorite!  Oh and mine made 10 pancakes using about 1/4 c. Of batter each.

I used the just water mix. So I omitted eggs as well milk and lemon juice (it was a buttermilk mix so I figured it didn't need more buttermilk) I used water until it was a good consistency. I used cinnamon applesauce and cut down on the cinnamon. It was good. It does get dark quickly so watch carefully to not burn.

I made these with Bisquick and followed the recipe exactly. They were horrible. Very doughy, did not raise at all in the pan, and had a tendency to burn easily in the pan.  Skip this recipe.

I used Krusteaz just add water.  I made 2 batches.  One using cinnamon applesauce, eggs, milk and the other I just added the cinnamon applesauce, cinnamon and water.  Family thought both were great and tasted the same...even though I told them they were different.  Glad to know I can skip the eggs and milk when camping!

Loved these.  I used the pancake mix where you just add water because it was all i had.  I added milk instead of the water, added 1 egg instead of 2, and omited the lemon juice.  I used cinnamon applesace and added added some apples I had diced up.  It was awesome!  Kids and I loved it.

These were pretty good, but I needed to add more cinnamon and a few piches of nutmeg the second time (but I like things a little more spicey).

Even more delicious than I expected.  At first I tried spreading the batter around because it was so thick, but when I just plopped it straight onto the griddle and didn't mess with it, that's when they were SO good.  They do cook up very thick, but they are meltingly tender.

I used a multigrain pancake mix and soy milk instead of dairy. Also omitted the lemon juice since I didn't have any. Otherwise I kept the proportions the same and liked the thickness of the batter, the pancakes cooked quickly, all the way through, and very evenly. What more can I ask? Expected these to be kind of flat with the applesauce, but much to my delight they were actually MORE fluffy and scrumptious than with the recipe on the box! Not very sweet or applesauce-tasting though, you still need to pour on the syrup. Make sure you don't over-stir, as that will take away your "fluff." I enjoyed this version more than the box recipe though and this is a keeper.

These seem to cook faster than regular pancakes. The apple cinnamon taste is subtle but good.  Really good with sliced bananas!

This was very simple. But... My kids couldn't tell the difference between these pancakes and the regular ones. My husband could and he said they were good. I never did get a chance to taste them myself. But i don't think i will make these again.

What a great recipe!  My very picky 5yo. son was a little put off by the "gooshy"-ness of this pancake.  But once I told him there was applesauce in it, he gobbled up 3 (mickey mouse shaped, of course!)  7mo  daughter is happily gumming 1 right now, but she'll eat any bread product. So quick and easy, and made the house smell great.  Thanks!

An easy and enjoyable recipe. Instead of buying a mix, I would suggest checking your cupboard. I used 1.5c all-purpose flour, 3.5tsp baking powder, 1tsp salt, and 1tbsp sugar, since I had these on hand. Of course, you can experiment with any other DIY mix you have in mind.

My 3 yr old doesn't like pancakes, waffles or any sweet breakfast items like that. But for the first time he actually ate his entire pancake and said how yummy it was! These were great, my family loved them. I used Bisquick mix and followed the directions to a tee. The only suggestion I would make is to add a little extra milk because the mix does tend to be a bit on the thick side with the suggested measurement. Otherwise they were fluffy, hearty and just the right amount of sweet. Definite must!

Theses are FANTASTIC! And that's saying a lot because I'm not much of a pancake person. I made them after catching the Autumn bug and I had  some pancake mix (the old fashion kind that needs eggs, oil, and milk) in the pantry that had been sitting there forever and I wanted to use it up. The apple sauce made the batter nice and thick which yielded fluffy pancakes YEAY! And I added more cinnamon since I prefer more cinnamon-y flavor with my apple foods. Definitely will make these again!

first couple batches turned out really bad - way too thick and dark. I had to add more milk, which I was surprised about as others said they had to add less. I used the pancake batter that requires milk and eggs too. After I added more milk they were ok. I even added half a chopped up apple which definitely made these better - would have been very bland without. Kids ate them as did us parents, however not sure I'd make them again.

This was pretty good.  A nice change from regular pancakes.  Easy to make and I think the cinnamon gives it good taste.

Finally found a great pancake recipe! I didn't have buttermilk or regular vinegar so I did 1 cup of milk with 1 not complete Tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar. Turned out wonderful and will definitely be making them again.

Pretty good. I didn't have a lemon on hand so omitted the lemon juice but other than that, followed the recipe using Bisquick. Not as light and fluffy as the buttermilk pancakes I usually make but definitely a good way to use up leftover apple sauce which is what prompted me to make them.

These are very good pancakes.  I used homemade applesauce which may have made the batter a bit thicker than it would have been with a commercial applesauce.  Will adjust the milk accordingly next time.  A great base from which to try variations.

I made these this morning and they were yummy! Perfect pancake "crust" on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. I used a pancake mix that is normally add oil, milk, and eggs.

Delicious and a nice change from just regular boxed mix pancakes.  We used whole wheat mix and it turned out just fine, follow directions as listed otherwise.  Nice and fluffy and a hint of apple and sweetness to the pancakes.

This is an excellent and easy recipe very moist. For an extra touch I added a handful of steamed apple slices and a handfull of steamed cranberries and added to the mix. I turned down the heat a bit but still browned quick next time I'll turn down the heat more.

Just made this for dinner tonight.  Used old fashioned Bisquick and followed the recipe for measurements but did add a smidge of nutmeg and some diced apple.  Kids loved it! Served with turkey sausage, fresh pinapple, and scrambled eggs.  No one left the table hungry :)

Super-quick and easy to pull together and they turned out GREAT. I used prepared pancake mix (Aunt Jemima's Buttermilk) and sweetened applesauce. The only change I made was to add a bit more milk to make them easier to spoon onto the griddle. These pancakes were moist and delicious and I'll definitely be making them again... soon.

Good, although I expected a but more apple flavour. I used Bisquick baking mix (I used it for all sorts of things, and so I never have just pancake mix on hand) and lime juice (out of lemon). They were the right density (I don't like "flimsy" pancakes) and nicely spiced (I always use a pumpkin pie spice blend when recipes call for cinnamon). I may consider finely dicing some apple into the batter next time. We spread "Cinnabutter" on these.

These were so yummy. I didn't do anything different to the recipe and I used Kreusatz Buttermilk (only add water) mix.  Served with leftover applesauce which my family put on top and between the pancakes so we really had apple torte for breakfast this morning. This is a keeper recipe as far as my family is concerned.  Bet it would be heavenly with fried apples on top - will try that next time.

I did not change a thing when making these, and my whole family thought they were FANTASTIC!  I used Bisquick, and though the batter was thick, it make for a very light, fluffy pancake.  I would not add more liquid. I used vegetable cooking spray and cooked on medium low heat.  Great recipe!

I thought this was a good recipe. My family did not agree. It had a nice light taste and was wonderful with syrup and butter. The batter was thick. So don't be alarmed, if it doesn't seem like the right pancake-consistency. They take a little longer to cook all the way through. So use medium-low heat and give it a few minutes per side.

These were fantastic! I made a few changes due to what I had on hand and my family went crazy for them. Instead of milk, I used milk cream and instead of 2 eggs I used 1 goose egg. I also added 1/2 cup of old fashioned rolled oats. I topped them off with caramelized bananas and wow!

This is our absolute favorite pancake recipe!  We make these probably 3-4 Saturdays a month.  I have made a few changes to make the pancake a little healthier and more filling.  I use 1 cup Bisquick and 1 cup Buckwheat pancake mix.  This combination makes for a hearty, not to gritty pancake!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I make these for special breakfast or brunch occasions, and every once in a while for dinner!  They are just great as is, I always serve them with some kind of fancy syrup - vanilla or buttermilk or cinnamon cream-based.  Yummy!  Makes plenty!

Wonderful recipe!  I was looking for an interesting new pancake recipe to try for Shrove Tuesday...and this was a WINNER!  The texture was soft and fluffy, and the cakes had a nice, subtle sweet taste.  I made them with Bisquick.  I would highly recommend these pancakes!

My girls love pancakes for breakfast but they don't get them very often as I hate making them probably because I'm not very good at them. Not any more this was fantastic my girls said they were the best I'd ever made. From now on they can have pancakes as often as they like. There's just a slight hint of apple taste with these and they're great with butter. Thanks.

It was really good. I followed the recipe as is except I used chunky applesauce because I love the extra burst of flavor it gives.

After only one try, this is a new family favorite.  We found it to be moist and yummy, with an applesauce flavor that is apparent but not overpowering.
I used to make plain Bisquick pancakes, but my family complained that they crumbled when eating them.
Now I use the Bisquick mix with this quick, easy recipe, and no more crumbling.  I highly recommend giving this recipe a try, you won't be disappointed!

I loved it.  I used 'natural' applesauce (no sugar added) and it wasn't as sweet as I would like.  I'll try the regular applesauce next time.  My kids loved it too.

I was really impressed by these pancakes! Considering the reviews I thought I'd have some so-so pancakes, but these were so tasty instead! The only thing I did differently was add 1/2 tsp extra cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla.  These were not dry at all, very moist and fluffy, just right.  I used bisquick brand mix.  These were a nice change of pace from my traditional pancake recipe and would be great as a fall morning breakfast.

Well, I'm not sure how to rate these.  They are only a 2 or 3 star PANCAKE from scratch, but then they are made with pancake MIX which usually turns out pretty awful.  And these tasted like your average from scratch pancakes, especially with the tip to cook them long on low heat.  You may want to thin the batter but with that cooking tip they are fine as is.  However you do need a whole cup of applesauce; I may or may not make these again.

I have had this recipe for at least 20 years.  I got it off the Bisquick baking mix box.  When my kids were little they like these pancakes.  Good with extra applesauce and syrup drizzled over all.

These are wonderful, and we followed the recipe exactly!  We used Bisquick mix, unsweetened applesauce, and 2% milk.  We did add the lemon juice (even though Bisquick is already a buttermilk mix) and the pancakes were great.  They had a lightly apple taste (almost more of a scent than a taste) and went so well with real maple syrup.  Both kids loved them as well.

YUM! I made homemade applesauce to put into these and served with warmed maple syrup. I left my applesauce a little chunky so that there were small apple bits in the pancakes and used Gala apples with minimal sugar.  My husband and I both loved them. The only reason I didn't give them 4 stars is as I feel that the homemade applesauce in which I was able to choose the tartness & consistency of the sauce lent to it's overall flavor.

I don't know why anyone would say you can't do these with the just add water pancake mixes. I didn't even think about what mix I was using and have made it twice now with the Krustaez brand mix. The first time I used the lemeon juice and milk and the second time I just used buttermilk. They were both so good. These pancakes come out so perfectly fluffy that I can't imagine any other way to make them now.

For the milk I used a vanilla almond milk. I cooked it using a pancake maker so my cook time for ten pancakes plus a little one was under ten minutes. Fluffy and tasty.

They were good.  I wish there was more apple flavor though.  I used a local honeycrisp apple apricot apple sauce and it added that right amount of sweetness to the pancake.  They were fluffy and light.  Good breakfast for dinner Friday night.

These are easy to make from-scratch pancakes and they taste out-of-this-world! I used Domata gluten free recipe ready flour, and gluten free quick cooking oatmeal and they are still very delicious. The popular term "flavorless" I hear my celiac son-in-law using for gluten free cooking absolutely does not apply to this recipe! This one is a keeper.

Great base recipe and super-simple to make with ingredients most people have on hand. I did find that this recipe lacked the "wow" apple flavor I was looking for, so I think next time I'll add some sliced or chopped apple to the mix just to make up for that. nonetheless, I will make this again since my husband and I really enjoyed them. Thanks for sharing!

It's too bad you can't review a recipe that you tweaked without having to give it stars.  I was determined to make this recipe work using Bisquick since I don't keep pancake mix in the pantry.  I made them as stated BUT only used 1 cup of Bisquick and let the batter stand 5 minutes before I tried to cook them.  The batter was perfect in consistency but I found I had trouble not burning them and they didn't puff up much.  I ended up wasting most of the batter until I realized that "low and slow" worked.  If I ever have any pancake mix in the house, I'll give them another try.

This is an awesome recipe! I also used the Krusteaz pancake mix and made just as written here. From one of your videos I decided to use the end of a stick of butter to rub the spot where each pancake goes for no stick. Delish! Also, I diced up a Granny Smith apple and sauteed that with a bit of cinnamon and brown sugar and a drop of lemon juice. Sprinkle them over the pancakes before adding real maple syrup. 375 degrees and cook 'til bubbly on one side....don't be afraid to wait for that or they'll be doughy inside. Flip and cook until they aren't puffy anymore. I did add a bit of extra milk (just tiny splash) to the batter after it sat for a minute because the batter was quite thick.

Wonderful!!  The husband didn't even complain....he seems to only like blueberry or regular pancakes.  I used Bisquick as my base and it worked just fine.

Amazing.  I halved the recipe because I was cooking only for myself, but they came out amazing.  It's a very forgiving recipe- I left one pancake on a bit too long but it still tasted fine.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

Delicious. Did not add lemon juice because I forgot. So easy to make. Just cook on medium-low to avoid burning. Will make again and again. Thank you for the recipe.

Good Pancakes. I used the pancake batter recipe from the "new Good Housekeeping Cookbook" and I did need to add a little extra milk to get 1/4" - 3/8" thick pancakes. I added the oil (2 tablespoons) directly to the batter. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to give the cakes a little more flavor.

This recipe is delicious! As a rep. for Mrs. Butterworth's syrup, I'm always looking out for great pancake recipes to share with our Facebook fans at www.facebook.com/mrsbutterworths. I tried this with Mrs. Butterworth's original syrup, and it was so good that I will just have to share it!

Yummy!  My mom made something very similar. She laid an apple slice in the middle of the pancake and covered it with a bit more batter. I'm trying that with this recipe next. ... and we used more applesauce, not syrup on top.

Good pancakes, but yes, they are incredibly thick.  I had to spoon them around on the pan to get larger pancakes, and they didn't bubble up like normal pancakes, so I had to guess more when I flipped them.   I don't have pancake mix so I used the Homemade Pancake Mix recipe from here.  You really don't taste the applesauce, or even the cinnamon, so I was a tad disappointed in that, although I did read the reviews.  I was hoping for a miracle, I guess.  these are easy, and pretty good, but they aren't full of apple flavor.  I topped with cran-applesauce to get my fix and bf topped wtih pb and nutella.  Thanks for the recipe!

I actually bought some krusteaz oat bran "healthy" pancake mix (add water only). It actually already has a little cinnamon in the mix. And I only had cinnamon applesauce.  So I didn't add the cinnamon.  But otherwise followed the recipe as is and they really came out well.  I think because the oat bran mix is thicker it could handle the extra liquid.

Great way to try to eat a little healthier!

Super tasty, but VERY thick. Almost impossible to cook through and through without burning. I turned the heat to medium-low and covered it with a lid to try to help...which helped some but still a little gooey in the middle. Next time I'll probably add a little more milk. Otherwise...SUPER recipe!! (my kids LOVE them!)

This is definitely better than your average pancakes.  I think next time I may add fruit on top though because the applesauce doesn't lend that much flavor (tastes more like sugar anyway).  I did have to use more milk than it said because it was way too thick as it was, but no biggie.  My toddler ate these just fine too so that's a plus!  Oh, and I wouldn't cook these on medium high.  Having read the reviews saying that it overcooks, I just cooked one on medium high and it did brown a lot quicker than other pancakes I've made.  I'd start off lower, like maybe even medium low and work my way up from there.  Not that they're inedible if they're a little more brown, but they certainly don't look as pretty :).

I made these as directed, except I only had blueberry applesauce (no sugar added). It was fantastic. The kids loved it too. The batter was extremely thick but it cooked up fine on the hot griddle, maybe takes a couple minutes more than usual.

I used "just add water" buttermilk pancake mix and it turned out just perfect.  I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 2 Tbsp Splenda brown sugar mix, a splash of vanilla and after mixing the ingredients I added the milk a little at a time until it was the consistency that I wanted.  I was worried about how they would cook because other reviews said they burn on the outside and remain uncooked on the inside.  So I left my burner on low and cooked them slowly in butter and they turned out PERFECT!  Lightly browned and cooked all the way through.  The kids loved them and I did too.

Good flavor to these pancakes, nice for something different.  One complaint though . . . I had a lot of trouble cooking them!  The outside browned really quick no matter now low the heat and the inside wouldn't be cooked.  I managed to get them pretty well done over low heat in the end but they were tricky and the outsides did burn easily!  Otherwise, they were tasty, just not sure how to fix the cooking problem.

This is excellent. I make my own dry pancake mix and follow the recipe. The adjustments I've made because I'm vegan is 2 tbsp milled flax seed blended with 4 tbsp of water, and then soymilk in place of regular. Still excellent even with the changes! Sometimes thicker than other times, b/c I add whole wheat, but such an easy fix, add more liquid!

I thought these sounded good but of course I had to put my own spin on them. I used homemade pumpkin butter instead of apple sauce, and added a pinch of nutmeg and a little extra cinnamon. They were fantastik. I also added chocolate chips but next time I think I would rather have butterscotch chips or a mix of the 2 of them.

I don't usually make pancakes because I never like the way they come out, but I tried these.  They were an amazing hit!  Everybody loved them.

Really tasty, burns easily so I would recommend a slightly lower temp than standard pancakes.  I also like to use 1/4 Cup Milk, and 1/4 Cup Heavy Cream.

these were delish. I loved how thin they were, i used bisquick, and followed its directions (mix+ 2eggs+ 1c.milk) before i remembered that i wanted to try this out. so i only used a half cup of cinnamon applesauce so they weren't too thin, and added a little extra cinnamon and vanilla. I can't wait to do them again, which will be this weekend, so i can do 'em right and have more applesauce and more flavor.

This is a great recipe for a quick breakfast. I prepared a bunch for for boys in my dorm during finals, and they loved them! Does anyone know how to make them fluffier though? They were a little flatter than I would have liked.

I made these this morning for my daughter.  I wanted a healthier version of pancakes for her...they were excellent.  We both loved them.  I did add a little more milk than called for though because we like our pancakes a lil thinner!

These smelled so good when cooking. I only used half the cinnamon because the apple sauce I used already had it in it. I did add extra milk because the batter was thick. My husband thought they were very good. Thank you for sharing your recipe

Surprised at how good this was.  Even my picky five year old daughter ate all of hers, and that is the highest compliment.  Didn't think she would because she saw me put the apple sauce in!

I wanted to use our new waffle iron and checked out what we had in the fridge to make the waffle interesting. Had applesauce, typed it in and ran across this recipe for pancakes. 
 Didn't have lemon juice, but followed the recipe otherwise & came out with crispy yet fluffy waffles. 

My husband thinks I am the queen of waffles... Thanks to Mom's Applesauce Pancakes I am!!

These were ok, I was expecting fantastic.  Maybe I used a little too much applesauce, I think I used a little more than called for.

Never new pancakes could be so good!!  I'm SURE this recipe if fabulous 'as is' and I can't wait to try it 'as is' - I made a couple changes based on what I had.  Didn't have lemon juice so I left that out...used cinnamon apple sauce (Sarah's Applesauce from this site which I made and left slightly chunky to have pieces apple in the pancakes) and used all spice in place of cinnamon in the pancakes b/c we like the flavor and the applesauce was already cinnamon-y. To a single batch I added about a 1/4 cup more applesauce and about 3/4 tsp all spice in place of cinnamon.  Add a little more or less of the all spice per you liking.  One reviewer said they added a tsp of vanilla and I'm thinking I'd like to try that sometime.  Made a double batch for 3 adults and 5 children of various ages and everyone loved them...not a single one left over!  Can't wait to make them again.

These pancakes are yummy. I live in high altitude. Here is what I did to the recipe. Instead of the dry mix I put in 1 cup reg. flour, one tablespoon sugar, one teaspoon baking powder, a dash of cream of tartar, a dash of salt, and a dash of baking soda. I also used somone else's suggestion and put in 1 capful of vanilla (about a teaspoon) and 1 T of melted butter. My husband inhaled these. As another reviewer also mentioned I had 12 1/4 cup pancakes and one cute baby pancake. I think that nuts would be a wonderful addition. :)

These were great.  I make a pancake like this, but I never thought to add lemon juice.  I think that was the missing ingredient I needed to make them so yummy. Mmmmmm!

Because of the reviews about too thick batter,I only put 1 and a half cups of mix and only 1 egg.They turned out perfect-really light and fluffy-not too heavy at all-and they cooked really nicely.I have found that when you add extra milk to thin the batter,it sometimes will not cook in the middle,no matter how burned the outside is.

even after adding extra milk to thin out the batter, we found these to be really heavy.  the apple flavor is good, but maybe incorporating applesauce into a lighter pancake recipe would produce a better result.

These were just wonderful.  After reading all of the warnings about the thickness, I made sure to add some extra milk until it was the consistency of the pancake batter I usually make.  The flavor and texture were great.  I will be making these again soon.

I've been looking for some pancakes that are a little different that my husband and I both enjoy (I love cottage cheese pancakes, he does not, I think regular pancakes need something extra, he does not). These make for a moist, tasty pancake that we both love. I use bisquick mix and home made applesauce and now I make these all the time.

My pancakes were very thick too, and the first one got burnt on the outside while raw on the inside, but after that I added a little more milk and also spread the batter a little more on the pan.  They were great after that!

I just made these this morning and already have requests to make them again sometimes.  After reading others reviews I used 1 1/4 cup applesauce and 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  It was a little thick, so I spread the batter and cooked on low for a while.  Next time I may add about 1/4 cup more milk.

Delicious!  I used Mott's cinnamon apple sauce, so I added a little less than the recipe called for (1/2 tsp).  These pancakes were light, fluffy and nice change of pace!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were incredible-I made them for my mother and family on Mother's Day, did a double batch (which turned out to make about 14 rather than 8) and everyone had more than they had planned. At the end everyone was stuffed because these were sooo amazing! In the batch I used egg substitute, added about 1/4 cup of sugar, and extra cinnamon. They were just delicious. I will be making these again for sure, very soon. Do try!

Yummy!! I love experamenting with all sorts of different pancake recipes and variations. This one is a keeper for sure! Light, fluffy, with a nice subtle flavor from the applesauce and cinnamon. I have made these as the recipe directs and have added about 1/4 cup of oatmeal for a different texture. Both were good! I used Bisquick mix, just because that was what I had on hand. Works wonderfully! You defenetly have to try these! You will love them, I assure you!

These were ok. Not the best I've ever had, a little on the dry side. Not sure if I will make then again.

These weren't too bad. They sucked up the syrup really good. They were fluffier than I thought they were going to be. I may make these again. I haven't decided yet.

These are good!  The flavor is quite subtle, my family couldn't identify the applesauce in them right away. I'm not usually a huge fan of pancake mix but this recipe will be a standby at my house. I added more milk than specified and served them with homemade raspberry preserves.

Very yummy. Didn`t even use the lemon juice and still tasted great. Even lacto vegetarians can enjoy these; I omitted the eggs and just doubled the amount of milk, using 1 cup instead of only a 1/2.

Turned out well. Read the other reviews and add milk a little at a time until it reaches a good batter consistency, which will vary based on your pancake mix.

I made them gluten free by using Bob's 1 to 1 flour. Needed to add a little bit more milk. Absolutely delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

I made as written using Kodiak Cakes pancake mix. Very average, too little spice and no applesauce flavor or moisture. I used sweetened, cinnamon applesauce. Won't make again.

LOL I did not read the directions!! I make pancakes from scratch... but it was a hectic Sunday morning and I had a Box of emergency rations pancake mix that expired 4 months ago. Kidding, LOL, I just keep it for SUPER LAZY TODAY DAYS! And yeah I don't freak out when something says expired 4 months ago...it's flour...if there is nothing crawling in it I'm not worried about it might not fluff up this much lol. read after I made them not to USE the  just add water kind. I useded homemade canned applesauce which was very thick so I ended up adding a little extra apple juice besides the milk. Even so with my blunders the pancakes tasted awesome so use the recipe... following correctly... and I'm sure you'll like it

Thank you for giving me a great pancake recipe, Shirley! The lemon juice is a game changer. I make this recipe from Trader Joe's organic applesauce (cups) and Trader Joe's "Buttermilk Pancake & All Purpose Baking Mix". Since being diagnosed with NHL (CLL & SLL) I have stopped using milk and now use Pacific Foods Hemp based plant beverage in these pancakes. You would never know it to taste them. The lemon juice is a key ingredient to wowing your family and friends with these great pancakes. While they're in the pan cooking, I'll drop some blueberries on top. They sink in and cook nicely. Yummy!! Thanks again, Shirley Smith!

Made this and my picky Nephew loved it. I cut the lemon juice and added some vanilla and cinnamon sugar to the batter to make a little more cinnamony. Served with warm syrup and caramelized cinnamon apples for a great breakfast.

I used Bisquick as the base pancake mix. I’m lactose intolerant, so used lactose free milk and added a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla. They turned out great and my husband liked it a lot.

Followed the recipe,  and they were horrendously thick and had terrible texture. I added quite a bit more milk. Overall a bland recipe that was highly overrated.

This was such a great doctored up pancake mix! I used Bisquick, and they came out fluffy and so yummy. I added a tablespoon of sugar, because the baking mix included it in their recipe, and I added just a splash more milk to get the batter to the consistency I wanted. My mom used to do something similar when I was little--but these are better than hers. I will make these again--my daughter loved them.

Maybe add 1/2 more of apple sauce.  Add 1 small diced apple. Add 1/2 tsp more of cinnamon.  Stir in the milk as needed to get right consistency.

Our whole family loves these pancakes! I did use the "add water only" mix and they came out perfect. They make a thinner pancake, more of a crepe texture, but wonderful! I also used the cinnamon applesauce.

I added half cup prepared oatmeal and another egg the second time, also used unsweetened applesauce. it was less sweet and I think it adds to the flavor. but I will say the original recipe is great.

Easy squeezy to make. I used Krusteaze "just add water" mix and added a bit more milk to thin 'em.  I mixed the batter extra to break up the clumps of mix. These brown q-u-i-c-k-l-y so check 'em often. My 5-year-old just announced, "Dad, I don't want regular pancakes or chocolate pancakes, I just want these!"  Wife blessed it saying, "Two thumbs up!" Yahoo!! :-)

I love this tweek on my regular recipe minus the oil and butter....definitely a keeper... and if you have the small prepackaged applesauce (snack size) each one is perfect measurement if you halve the recipe (like I did this morning... only 2 of us here today)

This has been my son's favorite pancake for more than 30 years. I make them "silver dollar" size.  That helps with the thickness problem. I add a little more cinnamon.

I had some homemade pumpkin butter, which was made with applesauce, that I needed to use up, so I used that instead of applesauce.  The result was fantastic!  Pumpkin pancakes!!!

I made no changes for this recipe.  I can my own apple pie filling so finished cooking it and thinned it down for topping the pancakes along with Aidells  chicken apple sausages and served for dinner.  Awesome!  Thank you for the recipe.

I've yet to try these, but just looking at the ingredients I can tell they'll be good.  Definitely putting this in my recipe box!  I write this before trying because amazed at the people who do not know that all you need to do to make less "thick", heavier pancakes is add some milk to the batter.  My husband likes thinner pancakes and I've had to do this for years.

Great idea for a pancake recipe that eliminates the need for oil.  I did substitute whole wheat flour and sugar free applesauce.   I also added two tsp. of baking powder because I wasn't using the pancake mix.  Because  of sugar restrictions at our house, I added 1/4 cup Splenda granular and 1/2 tsp. salt.  Loved this recipe concept.  Just needed a few tweeks to fit our diet.

I don't know if Bisquick is the same as pancake mix but that is what I had in the house. I used that and followed the directions as written, although I probably added just a tad more milk. I liked that the pancakes were nice and fluffy. I had some apple butter in the house, so I topped them with that. Now that really brought out the apple flavor.

Mom's Applesauce Pancakes Haiku: "Baby adores these, I found too thick and poofy. Froze the leftovers." So far these pancakes have translated very well straight from the freezer to the toaster oven to my 12 month old's mouth. I thought the batter was a little on the goopy side, so I added a splash of apple juice just to stick w/ the apple theme. They are hearty and filling w/ a nice warm touch from the cinnamon, making me yearn for the approaching fall season.

Compared to the "ultimate pancake" Bisquick recipe on the back of the box, we rated this recipe a notch higher. While mixing, I reduced to 1/2 t cinnamon - the full amount looked too much for the amount of the batter and it was a nice hint of cinnamon. And, I boosted the lemon juice to 1T for a slight hint of lemon. However, if using lemon extract, 1 t would be perfect as it is more concentrated. The recipe that tops our pancake list is still a traditional buttermilk pancake recipe from scratch. But, on Sunday mornings when we want something quick and yummy, this is our new go-to pancake recipe. Thank you Shirley for sharing this with us!

I used Aunt Jemima's Whole Wheat Blend - the batter was quite thick and didn't spread out much but the panckes were fluffy and not dense.  We all liked them and will add these to our pancake rotation.

I made these with homemade cinnamon applesauce.   I was a little worried that it would be overload, but my husband and two boys LOVED them.  By the time I brought the syrup and butter, the pancakes were gone!

This was ok for me. I made it exactly according to the recipe. I had no trouble with the pancakes getting brown, the color was fine, I just didn't think the taste was anything to rave about. I have other recipes that are better so this isn't a keeper for me.

Easy and delicious. I half the recipe for my family of 3, and it's perfect. I don't add many things to my recipe box on here (always trying new things), but this one we have added. I see these as a regular part of our Saturday mornings!

I used the "Bisquick Heart Smart" baking mix.  The pancakes turned out thicker that I like so, I will use a little more milk the next time. Good recipe and I have added this recipe to my recipe box to make again.  I may try adding mashed bananas in place of the applesauce!

I made this recipe as is. The only thing I did differently was increased the measurements for 6 servings instead of 4. It came out awesome. It fed 3 adults and 3 children with a few left over. Everybody loved them!

This recipe was not only Delectable it is healthy (low fat) as well!  The kids and hubby loved them!  Everyone who bakes even a little should know that apple sauce can take the place of oil in boxed cake mixes.  We have pancakes every weekend and this one will definitely be on the menu!

Fabulous! My picky kids love these (for supper...).  I snuck in some whey protein powder (normal practice for me when I make pancakes for supper) and the applesauce keeps them from tasting like rubber.  A keeper.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I'm a very experienced cook so I can tell it's good. I was wondering though, if I can use a homemade pancake recipe since I NEVER buy anything prepared. I'm stictly a "made from scratch" cook.

Nice add-on to plain old pancakes! I used bisquick and added a little extra milk, since I prefer thinner pancakes.

These were FANTASTIC. I was looking for a way to use up the applesauce I had in my fridge before it started sprouting mold. These tasted like restaurant-style pancakes and were the fluffiest I've made. I replaced the two eggs and used egg whites instead. I whisked them before adding them to the batter. Awesome recipe I'll definitely be enjoying again.

These Were amazing! I used cinnamon applesauce instead of regular and upped the amount of milk to 3/4 cup because the batter seemed too thick.

The only thing I changed is that I made dry mix from scratch, rather than boxed mix.  Yummy! They "puff up" nice & thick, great pancake taste.  Next time making a double batch so I can freeze some!

Oh WOW!! I just made these and they are absolutely delicious! Maybe the best pancakes I've ever eaten.... I want another but I'm too full because I ate three already! I modified it a tiny bit by using half and half instead of milk, left out the lemon juice and added a shake of pumpkin pie spice. Soooo good! Will definitely make again!!

These were very tasty and moist on the inside. Easy to make and versatile. I added some wheat germ, brown sugar, and apple pie spice too. I just found a tip that said for fluffy pancakes to whip your egg whites separately and fold into the rest of the mix last. I will try this next time to make these more fluffy as they came out pretty flat for me this time. Still delish tho. Enjoy!

These are terrific! I used the whole wheat blend pancake mix, used cinnamon applesauce, added a splash of vanilla and added blueberries. My son, who is VERY picky, ate 4 for dinner last night and 3 for breakfast this morning! Thank you!

These are THE best pancakes if you're someone who doesn't like to use a lot of syrup. They are naturally sweet and great with peanut butter.

Really, really good! I had made homemade applesauce earlier this week (Sarah's Applesauce from this site) and used that along with Bisquick mix. What a nice change of pace. We all loved them! Thanks for sharing this quick, delicious recipe!

These were very moist and fluffy pancakes. I just used one of the "just add water" pancake mixes. It was good. The only thing is that I would need to find a different syrup for these. Regular syurp has a different taste with this pancake.

My hubby is a chef and I have 2 little ones so you know I'm cooking for a tough crowd. I was looking for ways to cook with lower fat and came across this recipe. I used the Trader Joe's multi-grain pancake mix...followed the recipe except a splash more milk (we like thinner pancakes and they cook faster), less cinnamon and a little bit of vanilla as someone else had suggested. If anyone has used multi-grain pancake mix before, the results tend to be dry and dense. The applesauce made these pancakes much lighter and moist...they were a big hit. It also added a little sweetness and I like the fact we are getting more fiber from the apples.

These pancakes are fantastic.  My picky two-year old eats them up and asks for more!  I find myself craving them if I don't eat them for a week or two.  Delicious and relatively healthy.  I make the recipe completely as is and it rocks!  Thank you!!

So tasty and easy, was able to make before school. Not a great cook but still turned out great. I added a little finely chopped apple to the apple sauce think it added a lot.

These were fantastic. They were thick, moist, and simple. I added raisins and a bit of nutmeg to add more flavor. Great base for additional experimentation.

Hard to cook but I did use "Just add water" pancake mix. But they were still yummy. A faint apple taste. Ate with syrup. Worth the trouble flipping the flimsy cakes.

Very tasty recipe.  None of the flavors out do each other.  They all combine nicely to make a subtle apple/cinnamon moist pancake.  I used shortening on my griddle, which gave them a nice brown color.  Then added my mom's homemade syrup.  Added a couple Brown n' Serves and Voila!  Don't forget the coffee.

This is a great recipe.  My picky eater looooved them and asked for seconds.  I did add 1/2 t vanilla because I love it in pancakes and a little extra milk to give it the pancake consistency I like. Into my recipe box with this one!

These pancakes were great!  Next time I might try adding a little vanilla for a kick of extra flavor, but overall the kids loved them.

Very Yummy, with a little help.  Used Bisquick and followed the basic recipe.  I deleted the lemon juice & Cinn.  I added Apple pie spice, and vanilla.  It was still thick so I added milk until it looked good.  Even my picky middle son "I don't like applesauce"  Thought they were yummy.   (once I got him to try them! ;o)

Cook them at a lower heat, I burned a few before I got it right.  

Over all quick, simple, and good

WOW!! These are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly. I used a multigrain pancake mix (usually tastes very bland) and they came out awesome! This is one of my new family favorites from this website!

Five stars because everyone ate them and is helping to get rid of all our applsauce!! We have an abundance of the flavored variety so this was great. I halfed the recipe, and it was SUPER THICK. The tops would get done but not the middle. So I would pull the sides apart and put them back on the pan. Ugly, but tasty!! :] THANK YOU!!!!! [[Used lots of cinn. and vanilla.]]

Very tasty! I had some buttermilk to use up so I subst that for sweet milk.  Very fluffy.  Also added some vanilla and a little freshly ground nutmeg to batter.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for the post.

Very good ... I made fried apple pies a couple of months ago, and had made my own pie filling ... had some left over in the freezer, and this seemed like a great place to use some of it ... I was right!  The chunks of apple in the pie filling were great in the pancakes ... they reheat well, too ... had them again this morning, topped with strawberry yogurt ... yum!

These were the best pancakes I have ever tasted! They are incredibly delicious. But the applesauce makes the batter thick, so make the pancakes thin, or else they wont cook all the way through.

I think we have been spoiled by "From Scratch" pancakes... Not sure if it was the Bisquick mix or what the problem was.  But, quite simply:  Not great.  The 4 yr olds gave me the following responses:  "These taste weird - and it ain't the syrup!"  and "Are these pumpkin? I'm telling Dad."  I liked the concept a lot, sweetening with applesauce - but I had to add in some brown sugar and vanilla... Won't make again.

These were fantastic.  I think we added a little more cinnamon than we should have, which made them a tad bitter, but that's our fault.  Since we used unsweetened applesauce, I also added a couple of tablespoons of white sugar.  Highly recommended!

I liked these, although I wouldn't say they are my favorite pancake recipe. I used Krusteaz pancake mix and substituted half and half for the milk since I was out of milk. They were better than the just-add-water Krusteaz pancakes. They came out very thick and fluffy--almost bread-like.

These were pretty average. Like other reviewers, we did add more milk and water to bring them to a thinner consistency. Not sure whether it was because of the pancake mix we used, but these were pretty average. Turned out fine, but I'm not sure whether we'll ever make these again.

I had a few problems with this recipe. The first pancake I made was perfect. It was quite thick, but I actually like my pancakes a little on the thick side, so I was impressed. The rest did not work out so well. They never cooked in the middle and just burnt! I think it needed more milk. I used Hungry Jack mix and cinnamon applesauce (so, I used a little bit less cinnamon). I must say that the one pancake I did manage to eat was very good, so just add more milk and you'll be set!

We really enjoyed this. We made it with bisquick pancake/biscuit mix and the 1/2 cup milk was fine with it as it is a denser pancake mix than many others. Wonderful recipe, Thanks for sharing it!

This is a very good pancake.  It is simple to make and easy to scale down.  I use a pancake iron given to me and my husband as a wedding gift and the pancakes turn out beautiful and delicious.

These were great "cheater" pancakes!  Thanks for sharing the recipe - made them exactly as stated and very much enjoyed them along with some of the Scrambled Eggs Done Right.  So filling, that I barely ate my dinner later that day!  Thanks much!

we thought these pancakes tasted pretty good. the only modification i made was in using a rounded teaspoon of cinnamon. if you like, try the delicious "applesauce french toast" also on this website. many thanks for your mom's recipe shirley!

Yummy!! I added a little more milk since it came out lumpy; also added more cinnamon. They came out great. Nice, fluffy, and moist. Love the after taste. They did cook quicker and were thinner so the batter makes a lot. We sliced up some bananas for the top!!!

These were very good pancakes and everyone around the breakfast table said that this recipe is a keeper!  Warm off the griddle with butter and maple syrup, just yummy is all I can say.

Wow! I've never had pancakes this fluffy from a mix! I added a little more applesauce and I omitted cinnamon (husband and daughter are allergic), and I added a sprinkle or two of nutmeg. Really good. They taste different from regular pancakes, but not at all like you're eating a bowl of applesauce. A nice change! Thank you so much for sharing, Shirley!

Loved these served together with Blueberry Sauce also on this site.  To the basic recipe, used 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and added another quarter cup of milk and a couple grindings of fresh nutmeg.  Delicious mother's day breakfast from my son!

I didn't change a thing. These are really fluffy and tasty... a nice change of pace from regular pancake mix pancakes, and fairly quick and easy too. Thanks!

Nice and easy!!  The pancake is light and fluffy with a little hint of apple sauce and cinnamon that doesn't overpower the overall taste.  :)

My kids DEVOURED these.  The only change I made was to use pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon because I was out of cinnamon.  I've NEVER made fluffier pancakes than the ones that I made with this recipe!  I made a double batch and made silver-dollar size.  I will refrigerate the leftovers and the kids can pop them in the toaster themselves tomorrow.

Yum!! These are so moist and fluffy - delicious! I didn't really taste the applesauce, I think it just gave it that perfect moistness and texture. I could just taste a hint of cinnamon. I don't mean this as a bad thing, just that these aren't "apple cinnamon" pancakes. On the other hand, my husband, who doesn't really care for cinnamon, asked if I could make some without cinnamon next time, so if you don't like cinnamon, don't add it, I guess. Either way, I loved them!

As with previous posts, I added a dash of vanilla and nutmeg, used a little more applesauce, and milk. Yummy!!

it makes really nice, soft pancakes.  However i had a hard time cooking it w/out getting one side of the pancake burned, cuz the batter's kinda thick.  might just be my poor cooking skill though.  I suggest adding sugar... (which I did)  i think its better than using syrup

Very good!  A nice change from plain old pancakes.  I doubled the cinnamon and added a bit of water to make the batter a little thinner.

The best pancakes ever. I added more applesauce and more cinnamon along with a little bit of brown sugar, and more pancake mix to compensate.  Made them twice now.

These were great! I added a little bit more applesauce and doubled the cinnamon for extra flavor! Good with powdered sugar or syrup!

P.S. The consistency is pretty thick for a pour on pancake.. you can try adding more milk, or manually spreading out the batter!

The batter was quite dry- I had to add more milk. I was diappointed by this recipe- I sounded much better than it was. My daughter didn't like it either.
