It is so hard to find a great pork tenderloin recipe.  This was amazing.  The meat was very tender and the flavor was great.  Thanks for posting.

Absolutely perfecto!  My only change was to only use about of the 1/2 of the olives because some of us don't like olives very much.  Added sun-dried tomatoes to the stuffing to replace them.  Garnished with Parmesan cheese and served with a spinach salad and a lovely White Zinfadel.

This is by far the best recipe for pork tenderloin I have ever eaten. My husband said it was incredible,but do I want to spend 2 days in prep? Preperation was minimal and the flavor was wonderful. I did not have red peppers or browning sauce, I did use olive oil on the onions and mushrooms. Cooked on the grill until done. GREAT

This recipe is wonderful!  I have a sensitivity to garlic in its natural state so I used garlic powder and it was just as tasty as I imagine the original recipe would be.  My husband gushed over it.  I used a small (1lb) pork loin, perfect for two people.  Thanks Richard.

The mustard and garlic give the pork a very different and satisfying taste.  This was a very easy recipe.  My family was impressed.  The pork was very tender, juicy and flavourful.

A very good recipe.  I thought it was missing something and next time I will add some sun-dried tomatoes, which I think will help round out the flavors.  Easy to put together and looks very impressive.

Very good.  Since we like a lingering flavor, we used more garlic  mustard.  Will try using this on pork chops also.

Yummy!  Didn't have exactly the right ingredients in the old frig, so I improvised slightly and this dish came out wonderfully!  Added a handful of canned sliced black to a jar of leftover spicy green olives from a party.  Also included the condiments still left in the olive jar because I don't like to waste a thing (garlic slices the I minced, marinated red pepper slices and some pimentos).  Dressed and tied the whole thing up as instructed, left the tenderloin in the frig for 24 hours.  Tented it in alum foil the next day, then threw it on the bbq for 30 minutes.  Wow!  So moist and flavorful...and very, very easy!  Thanks for a great addition to my recipe collection.
