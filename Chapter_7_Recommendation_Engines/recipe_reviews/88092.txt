I am russian, and I LOVE this salad!  My mom actually made this 2 days ago.  Instead of the hotdogs either use boiled chicken breasts (my favorite way) or Bologna cut into small pieces.  Also add boiled carrots, which you can cook in the same pot as the potatoes.  We also add some dill for color and flavor.  You can use green onion or regular onion.  Cut the potatoes when they are still hot/warm and put the mayo in as you cut them, while they are warm. This makes the salad creamier and better tasting!  Enjoy!

We are Ukrainian and we eat this all the time. It's actually a tradition to have it on the table for all family get togethers and parties. We add finely chopped cooked carrots, dill and we like to use chopped salami or smoked turkey thighs. I also add about 2 T of the pickle juice to it to give it some zip. You can also use 1T of vineger to it. We also like it with loads of fresh ground pepper. This is a great dish and you can play with it to suite your tastes.

Make sure you chop everything finely and in this order: potatoes, hot dogs, pickles, scalions, then add peas, and grated eggs. 1 cup of mayo is for the whole salad so dress your individual servings with as much mayo as you desire.
enjoy :)

I am Bulgarian and this Russian salad is a favourite dish for parties and holidays in my coutry. We usually add pickled carrots and if you use ham, it will be even more delicious. Once you try it, you can't get enough of it!

This recipe is also known as "olivye". Instead of turkey dogs, bologna can be used and I add cooked carrots as well as potatoes. It  has more egg flavor than american potato salads, but it is delicious.

I've made this salad so many times I lost count.  It's great for parties and to give an alternative to the traditional potato salads around.  I've added some finely chopped granny smith apples to the salad and it adds a little bit of acidity and crunch.  Always get ravings about the "pea salad" as we call it.

I have made this salad numerous times.  Definitely chop everything small and I also add apples.  It adds a great flavor and a little crunch!

This was a very unique potato salad and a very nice change from the norm.  I'd truly rate it about a 3 1/2.
July '07 update: 
I've made this several more times and we really like it.  I would say it is definitely a "4" now.  I modified it a bit and we like it better.  I don't add the onions (we don't like them.)  Also, rather than use all dill pickles, I used about 2 1/2 dill pickles chopped up and the same amount of bread and butter pickles chopped up.

I made this with veggie hot dogs.  It was really scrumptious, but to be honest I've never found a potato salad that wasn't...

I lived in Russia and this olivye is one of my favorites. I would definitely add dill (fresh - and me personally, I add lots), but one hing you should use half sour cream and half mayonaisse to get a more real Russian tasting salad... The mayo in Russia tastes nothing like the mayo in the US, and the sour cream makes it. Also if u have a Russian/Ukrainian store nearby, get some kvas and pour over the salad to make a summer soup. It's yummy! (Altho again, the kvas in Russia isnt exactly the same as here - I prefer the kvas in Russia) U could make your own too tho...

this salad is a nice change from the traditional potato salad.  The addition of a crispy apple was a definate plus.  Also, using a flavored sausage, such as mild italian with fennel, added a different twist.  Definately chop all but the potato into small pieces.

Never had Russian potato salad before, so I have no point of reference.  Now I'll admit I wasn't sure I'd be 100% on board with this recipe, but I wanted to try it simply because of those hot dogs.  That's what makes this no "ordinary" potato salad as the recipe author states.  I did use Nathan's® All Beef Hot Dogs and frozen peas but, otherwise,  followed the recipe. Well, we not only liked it, we REALLY liked it!  This house loves potato salad, and this certainly will be made again.

I'm Russian and my mom's version of this recipe is a little different.  To the same qty of eggs/potatoes, she uses only 1/2 lb bologne for everyday OR chicken for holidays.  She uses 4 pickles and 1 fresh cucumber.  She doesn't use onions.  She recommends using mayo to taste and dill if you want to.  As for technique... my mom's advice to me was to peel the potatoes before coking them.  That way... you don't burn your fingers trying to peel them (or waste time waiting for them to cool).  Enjoy!  My b/f and his family (who aren't Russian) LOVE this recipe... they all asked for it!

This is the russian version of the true american potato salad. A good tip, and something I always do is don't mix the mayo into the salad until you're ready to serve, this way the juice from the pickles doesn't divert it. I always make a big batch for my family, as this is like a traditional staple. I only mix the mayo in with the amount of salad I'm using at that time. I also like using the canned peas and carrots, cuts time...and apples and onions.

Excellent!  I am Russian and this salad brings me back to my roots!  I wanted it vegetarian so I skipped the hot dogs and didn't substitute.  I also omitted two egg yolks.  Left everything else the same and it was great!

I don't get all the rave reviews. I made it just as written with no modifications. Maybe it will be better after it sits in the refrigerator overnight although that is not indicated in the recipe.

I'm not  from Eastern Europe  and I loved this! After reading all the reviews I added cooked carrots and lots of dill. I also used Boar's Head ring bologna. The pickles and eggs were so delicious with the peas. It is so good we eat it as an entree, sided with some cold pickled beets and assorted cheeses. Just fantastic. Thank you for a really nice recipe.

My family loved it. I made it with peas and carrots as others suggested and also added about 1/4 cup of the pickle juice instead of salt. Will definitely make again and try ham instead of turkey franks and see how that turns out.

it's a great salad ,!  Unfortunately, I made mine and the patatoes  ended being little bit hard. In that case I added the mayo and mixed  all together so the patatoes  get softened little bit . By any means  ; it tastes great; but  my mom makes it differently and her's is better ????

Delicious potato salad! I used ham and fresh dill (that I had on hand from making the refrigerator dill pickles on this site). I added some prepared mustard, black pepper and garlic salt to the mayonnaise. I used some of the homemade dill pickles as well. Easy to make and yummy to eat! Thank you for sharing.

The only thing this potato salad recipe lacked in getting 5 stars from me was the canned peas.  SO much tastier with a handful of fresh or frozen pettit-pois.  Excellent recipe otherwise.
