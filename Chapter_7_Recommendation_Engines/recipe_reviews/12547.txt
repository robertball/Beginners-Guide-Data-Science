I was out of sugar and was craving brownies and had some condensed milk that I wanted to use up.  I did not have walnuts or a pie shell, so I halved the recipe, left out the walnuts, and used muffin tins.  It made nice round brownies, which I topped with a bit of white icing.  Very enjoyable!  Nice way to use up what i had onhand.

This is a very easy, quick pie to make, but I think it would benefit from a little cinnamon and maybe some vanilla.  I took it to work and everybody liked it.  I will try it again.

This recipe was a little dissapointing... the filling was too much like a brownie in a pie shell...  I would like to see it more pie-like. I will not try this recipe again-

Absolutely delicious!  I made my own pie crust, then made this recipe with no changes and it turned out perfect.  I served it after it had cooled and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream and hot fudge on top.  Everyone loved it.  Without the ice cream or some whipped cream I think the pie by itself would be a little too rich.

I love this pie. One caveat; it is very rich!  A real winner served warm with whipped cream.......

I made this recipe for my sister in law's birthday. She adores brownies. The pie shell made it into a more elegant affair. I did substitute the cocoa powder for real chocolate because there was  no unsweetened cocoa powder at our local supermarket.

Great way to use up what is on hand!  Very forgiving, too.  I was pouring batter into crust when I realized I forgot to add eggs.  Stirred in beaten eggs with batter in crust and it still came out great.  I also left out walnuts and threw a handful of chocolate chips on top.

I am not a huge pie fan, but I liked this because it was more like a very dense brownie.  I definitely recommend eating it with ice cream!  My boyfriend, who loves nuts, thought this was fantastic and it will be staying in my recipe collection.  Thanks for sharing!

Way to dry for a pie and I did not bake it as long as the recipe called for.
