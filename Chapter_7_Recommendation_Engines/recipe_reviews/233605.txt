We make this recipe every year starting in the Fall/football season. It is the best chili recipe I have ever made-we absolutely love it. It's spicy & delicious. Only things we change is to add some ground chk sausage & we use 1 can of crushed tomato & I can of tomato sauce instead of 2 can tomato sauce. Depending on our mood sometimes 2 haberneros!!

Texas chili doesn’t have beans in it but it’s really good.

I liked this recipe, but made it without the tomato sauce.  And if you have beans with it, in Texas it has to be pintos (preferably not canned). Warm some fresh corn tortillas and you are in chili heaven.

Very good. I read about charring jalapeños so I did that and added them after the char, gave it a nice smoked  spice!

This was my first chili cooking experience and I did my best to stick to the recipe. Changes: I only used my cast iron Dutch oven for less clean up. Habanero wasn't available so I used 2 jalapenos. I didn't read well enough to notice I should have drained the tomatoes with green chilis and I didn't add the 3 oz of beer.  I think the spices were overwhelming. My DH is a chef and he believes it is a good recipe and suggested cutting the dry spices by half next time I make it. Hopefully I will remember to post an update.

The kidney beans were optional and only 1 can so on that note I left them out. However, where I come from beans are a must for chili and lots of them. I used 3 cans of pintos and I didn't drain the rotel due to the extra beans. LOVED the addition of beer and even added the rest of the bottle to the leftovers.  This is a good recipe and one that is adaptable to suit your needs.
