Love this - so easy! Baked chicken marinated in it - added a 2T of hot sauce for an added kick. Will definitely make this again!

Made this recipe for the RECIPE GROUP this was sooo soo good! Perfect combination and so easy to make. I made one change in that I switched half the soy sauce for Chinese white wine. Thanks! A much deserved 5 stars:)

This is a perfect marinade. This was a recipe group selection and a great selection it was. I marinated the meat for 6 hours and it was enough to impart great flavor. I used it on flat iron steak and found it very flavorful and delicious... and of course the name is marvelous.

I made this for the recipe group and I marinated some steak strips in it to use for steak soft tacos and it was delish! I just put all the marinade ingredients into my mini chopper and gave it a whirl - but I used 3/4 soy sauce and 1/4 water so it wouldn't be too salty and the flavour turned out perfect. I poured it over the steak strips and added some pepper sauce to the mix and let it marinate for about 4 hours. I also cooked down the marinade into a thick sauce to put over the meat. End result was so delicious! I will definitely use this marinade for other meats. I love the given name btw LOL. Thank for sharing.

Made for Recipe Group. I used powdered ginger in this. Pork chops were flavorful and juicy but very strong taste of soy. The hint of ginger was nice but wouldn't make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for recipe group 07/18/2011: I thought this marinade tasted too much like an Asian marinade to be considered an all-purpose marinade. It also seems to be missing an acid and so the soy sauce and other flavors were really prominent. I really made the mistake of using a very expensive and tender cut of meat. This marinade is really meant for a tougher cut of meat like most marinades I guess. I just had to use what I had. I ended up broiling it like I do for many meats. The marinade appeared to be infused in the meat but it leaked everywhere. I had not had as much liquid in other marinades separate from the meat like that. Now I have a big mess to clean up tonight in the oven. Use a cheap cut of meat and a pan with sides or a grill and this recipe may work out fine for you. Maybe I just needed a little more instruction on what type of meat to use and the best way to cook it on this one.

Recipe Group selection of 7/16/11. There is no acid so this will not tenderize tough meat. I knew we would not like this using all soy sauce so I used half soy and half worstershire (sp?) The meat had almost a sweet flavor after marinating for about 3 hours. If I make this again I will still use the 50/50 and add some vinegar.
