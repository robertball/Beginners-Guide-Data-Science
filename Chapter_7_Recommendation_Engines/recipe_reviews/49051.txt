I liked it a lot but I also changed it a bit. First I used only 1/2 C. butter instead of 1 C.. I prefer less fat. I misread the instructions and didn't add the oats to the honey-butter mix as I was supposed to, which turned out fine. Maybe even better?!? I simply added the oats to all the other ingredients.
To save more sugar and fat I skipped the chocolate. I wasn't sure about the second portion of honey either, so I simply added only 1/4 C. as stated in the instructions. The dried fruits I used were sweet too and I used more of it. You can always add  a chocolate coating later on if it's not sweet enough for you with less honey. 
My other changes:
I used almonds plus 1 C. raw pepitas instead of chocolate.
1 C. dates, coconut and apricots instead of a half cup of each, plus 1 Cup cranberries and a handfull plums. Turned out fine. Next time I will add some pumkin spice or allspice. The flavor developes more when the bars a kept in an airtight container for 1-2 days.

We have fixed this recipe to correct the amount of honey listed in the ingredients. The second time honey is used, it is only 1/4 cup.

I made this recipe a week ago and wanted to wait to post my review for a few reasons.. The night I made these I felt the instructions and recipe were not detailed enough (and still feel that way).  
TO start with.. a stick of butter?  Try using 1/2 and add apple sauce if needed.  Also use a floured rolling pin to thin out the crust!  The crust came out more like a cookie, but was well liked.  

Second layer.. Eggs... no mention of what size, I used 2 of what I had in the fridge, XL.  Not only did I have lots of egg batter swimming around on the top of the crust but the fruit and nuts had a faint taste of egg which really turned me off (and that was even after adding cinnamon to the mixture).  That being said.. A few days after sitting in the fridge the egg taste is gone and the bars are a great snack or breakfast option.  Even my bf liked them!  The good of the second layer is you can make it as healthy as you want it.  I added all kinds of fruits and nuts and skipped out on the chocolate chips.  I also used sugar free honey (which is sweetened with malitol) that being the case, next time I make them I'll set the oven to 325 so the fruits dont brown in the corners of the pan.

This was great!  I made my own substitutions (used raisens instead of choc. chips, and part raisens/part sunflower seeds instead of apricots, also used a mix of almonds/pecans/walnuts instead of just almonds).  I cooked it for 30 minutes without checking it & I was worried because it looked very dark on the edges (burnt I thought), but when I tasted it - it was great!  It had a definite toasted honey/oatmeal flavor (which I loved!)  I thought these might be like granola bars, but they are more like the texture of a bar cookie.  Delightful!

I love these. I changed some of the dried fruits to use what I had in the larder , namely raisins and Cranberries and asst other fruits.

I substituted half the honey for Malt extract, again because it was what I had in the larder but I've been a big fan of malt extract since I was a kid.. just ensure its NOT the Malt extract with added cod liver oil :-& 

I left out the chocolate chips inthe actual bars but melted some shocolate afterwards and dipped them base first to give them a chocolate coated bottom (perhaps not the healthiest option but delicious!) 

Yummy yummy.

My fav snack! I use pretty much any dried fruits or berries I have - prunes, apricots, cranberries. I like to put less chocolate chips (cut in half) to lower calories and sugar, and it still tastes great! Same goes for butter, I cut it in half which requires quite a bit of mixing afterwards (with hands, 5 mins or so) because it is more dry. Alternatively, I used 1/4C butter and 1/4C coconut oil.

I followed this recipe as written, except using a mixture of almonds and walnuts since I did not have enough almonds, and leaving out the wheat germ as I did not have any in the house.  The top of these bars were yummy, the base was fine, but my bars just wouldn't stay together.  I even tried refrigerating them per another review to try to help with this problem, and about half of the bars simply split into two separate layers when I cut them.  I was disappointed.  Won't make again.

It was a good somewhat healthy snack.  The extras I added were dried bluberries, dried fruit, raisins, coconut, pecans, wheat germ.  I liked them all but the dried fruit.  Although the dried bluberries were good in it.  My family did not rave about it, but when we went hiking my 7 years old son liked it well enough.  I bagged them in snack bags individually and stored them in the refrigerator for the lunchbox.  They seemed to stay together better after I refrigerated them.

I vegan-ized and reduced the fat in these.  I used 1/2 C 'Buttery Sticks' and 1/2 C applesauce, and replaced the honey with maple syrup (I'm going to try agave nectar next time).  I omitted the chocolate chips and used a little more dried fruit.  I replaced the 2 eggs with 2 Tb. flax meal + 6 Tb. water.  The bottom was very dense but that is probably due to my alterations.  I will definitely be making these often!

The flour mixture is missing something. Its dry. Top is good. This bar needs to be eaten with a glass of milk.

These were pretty good, the "crust" needed some spice to it wtih the oats, wheat flour & wheat germ, its sort of bland. Next time I'm going to add some nutmeg, cinnamon and maybe cloves. Other than that, this was really tasty, I couldn't wait to try it out of the pan still warm!
