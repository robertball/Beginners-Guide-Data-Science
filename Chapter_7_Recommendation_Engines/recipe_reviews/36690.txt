I read the reviews before making this - and used all wheat flour in replace of white flour and used applesauce in replace of oil. It came out totally delicious! And YES it does taste more moist and flavorful the next day! Thanks for a healthy recipe!! - Sharon

I really liked this recipe.  They were delicious!  I made them no fat by using pumpkin instead of the oil.  (I didn't have any applesauce.....)  I also turned them into muffins and sprinkled oatmeal and brown sugar on the top.  They made about 16-18 muffins.  I, also, cooked them for 20 minutes!!

This is a delicious recipe which lends itself easily to alterations.  The oatmeal flavor really separates this recipe from the rest.

I'm not a big fan of applesauce substitutions, so instead of the 7T oil, I used 2T oil, an extra 1/4 cup of skim milk, and 1T of lemon juice.  I also substituted whole wheat flour for 3/4c of the white flour, added 1T of vanilla, and ommitted the cinammon.  I ended up with a perfectly moist (not too wet), delicious, and wholesome loaf.  Next time I'll remember to throw in some walnuts too.

This is a good recipe.  I substituted fat-free sour cream for the oil.  It turned out good.  I added walnuts too.  I don't think this is one of our favorite recipes for banana bread though.

This is the BEST banana bread recipe I have EVER made.  It is very moist, tasty, especially with the walnuts.

I bake a lot of banana bread, and I love oatmeal, so I THOUGHT this would be a great bread. I was wrong. I used applesauce in place of the oil and the final product was more like a Power or energy bar than anything. If you like a dense, rubbery, heavy, wet texture, this recipe is for you...if not, don't waste your time, you'll be disappointed, like me. :(

My family really enjoyed this bread.  I made this loaf and a box of name-brand from the grocer.  Although we ate both, when this recipe was gone it was the only one that anyone wanted seconds of.  I felt good about the ingredients.  It makes an excellent on the go breakfast bread and also perfect for an afterschool snack.  My kids get home late in the afternoon and can't hold out until dinner.  I feel much better about them having a snack like this...even it it fills them up for dinner.

My four y/o and two y/o daughters loved this bread.  My older daughter said, "Keep this recipe forever!"  My younger daughter said, "More, More, MORE!"  I followed the suggestion to substitute applesauce for the oil; however, I found as I was making the bread that I didn't have enough applesauce so I finiished it off with apple butter.  The apple butter did add extra cinnamon, but also more calories than just using applesauce.  Any way you slice it, the bread was great and is very filling.  We'll keep this recipe and make it again and again.  Thank you!

This recipe makes 17 delicious regular-sized muffins.  Baked for 18 mins. at listed temperature.  Wonderful split, buttered with a healthy spread, and toasted for breakfast.  Freezes beautifully.  Another great healthy recipe for those of us with high cholesterol.

Even though I altered the recipe quite a bit and I'm sure it didn't taste the same as it was originally intended, I thought it was quite delicious!  I tried to make this with the least amount of calories and fat as possible, so substitutions/alterations I made include: 1 cup Splenda instead of brown sugar, 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce instead of the oil, 1/2 cup egg substitute instead of the eggs, 3 bananas instead of 2, used instant oats instead of regular, 1/2 cup light vanilla-flavored soy milk instead of milk, and finally I converted the bread into 16 muffins.  They came out moist and dense and not-too sweet.  Next time I will try to use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose to lower the calories even more and make them more healthy.  According to my calculations each muffin is only 100 calories and contains a negligible amount of fat.  I ate them with some sugar-free strawberry jam for a very filling and yummy snack that didn't ruin my diet!

I followed the recipe as it says except I used 4 small bananas, my bread came out with a mushy texture and not much flavor.  If I do try this again I might add some raisins.   Better after it cools.

A real keeper!  I loved this recipe. I added a bit of lite sour cream.  Nice and light and moist. I also used a muffin pan (makes about 15) and baked for just 20 minutes!

Okay, so am I the only one who threw in some dark chocolate chips?  Served it with our meal last night.  Delicious...the whole family raved!  And, nobody asked for dessert afterward -- that was a first!

Delicious and healthy option for banana bread - REALLY moist, too.

My variations were: Whole wheat flour, Splenda brown sugar (1/2 cup), Motts Healthy Harvest Summer Strawberry Applesauce (1 snack pack) instead of the oil, 5 medium bananas (2 cups mashed), and 1 teaspoon pure vanilla.

My batch made 27 small muffins.

The nutritional info for the batch described above is as follows (these are totals...just divide by the number of mufffins you end up with):

This was very good.  No measurements were changed but I had to make some substitutions and still it came out very tasty.  Used butter instead of vegetable oil. Used soy milk instead of fatfree milk. Used 1 c each unbleached flour and whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour.  So it wasn't as low-fat but it was healthy still.

I like the taste and texture that the oatmeal adds.  I also like the fact that it's a little healthier than most banana bread recipes.  The only thing I add is some vanilla and almond extract for a little extra flavor.  UPDATE:  I have been making this with half whole wheat flour and it has still been fantastic. 2nd UPDATE:  I have been using ALL whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup of oil, adding extra banana, and cutting the sugar by half and replacing with the equivalent of Truvia (12 packets or 3-1/2 Tbsp). Still excellent and much healthier. I usually also add chopped walnuts either mixed in or sprinkled on top.

Turned out great; I followed the suggestions of others, so that in the end I had the following changes: Replaced all the white flour with whole wheat (minus 2 tbsp, which I replaced with 2 tbsp of ground flax seed), replaced all the oil with applesauce, used 2 whole eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and just under 1 cup of brown sugar.  I also topped with some sliced bananas and oats. The applesauce adds some sweetness, which is why I cut down some on the brown sugar.  If you really like things sweet, I'd suggest keeping the entire cup though. Next time, I'll add banana slices throughout the batter, along with the mashed bananas.

I was looking for a banana bread with oatmeal that did NOT use a saturated fat and didn't have a large amount of oil.  This one worked very well!  While it was baking, I had family members asking how soon they could taste since it smelled wonderful.  Small changes I made were using 2 whole eggs instead of 1 whole and two whites, I used 1 tsp of cinnamon, and used 1 cup of unbleached flour and 1 cup of the "white" whole wheat flour.  It was moist and not oily like some quick breads that use oil as the fat. The oatmeal gave an appealing texture, nicer than banana bread made with just flour.  This one is a keeper in my file!

This isn't as rich or moist as other "banana bread" recipes, but those breads are more like cake than bread in terms of their ingredients and fat content.  This would be something you could serve as bread at breakfast time without giving your family a huge sugar high.  I would still make it again because it tastes good and is healthier.  You can save the richer banana bread recipes for potlucks or when you want to impress people.  This is a better everyday recipe. 

I ended up using melted butter instead of vegetable oil because my roommate didn't have any oil around and I usually count on her to have common baking ingredients I don't buy.  I also used 1 tsp. of vanilla.

Unlike some of the rave reviews on here, I thought this was just ok. It may have been better without the substitutions I did--I used 1/2 cup white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, halved the veg oil with applesauce, used 3 mashed bananas and some vanilla. And I made them as muffins.  They were moist and light, but not very sweet.  I added some brown sugar and oats to the tops of my last tray and liked that.
might try again.

I couldn't find my regular banana bread recipe so I gave this one a try. This just may be my new regular banana bread recipe! I'll probably decrease the sugar next time, but otherwise, it was great! =)

I made this recipe vegan, a lot less fat, and yummier, by substituting 7 T applesauce for the 7 T vegetable oil.  And substituted 2 bananas for the 2 eggs. I used 1 cup soy milk for the 2 egg whites and 1/2 c milk.

Fantastic!  I made a double batch without problems.  Next time I'd substitute 1/2 of the oil with applesauce.  Otherwise no changes.  It was gobbled up.

My whole family including my choosy little girl loved this bread for breakfast! Moist and delicious! I also put the mixture in muffin tins and made some for her kindergarten class, and the teacher said that the kids just loved it. It warmed my heart to know that they were eating nutritious oatmeal too. I'll be making this quite often!

I made this for a road trip to Colorado and it was a wonderful snack for hiking.  It's very moist with a great texture.  You don't even know the oatmeal's in there.  I also made it for my mom who rarely gets to eat banana bread because it always has nuts in it.  :)  Great recipe.

Thought this was a really good recipe.  I've found that I can usually trust recipes from Cooking Light to turn out well. Did a few minor alterations:  used 1/2 C fructose and 1/4 C brown sugar, used 3 bananas, used 1C regular flour and 1C  whole-wheat flour, added about  1 tsp vanilla, added a dash of nutmeg and sprinkled the top with walnuts and cinnamon sugar.  Just make sure not to stir too much after adding the flour and the bread will turn out tender.

I am a subscribed to cooking light and love their recipes.  I love this banana bread.  I always use more banana than the recipe calls for, no matter what recipe I am using.  I usually use an extra banana.  This recipe makes a moist and tasty banana bread.  I enjoy the added texture of the oatmeal.

This is the first time I ever made a banana bread with oatmeal.  It is very good...the kids loved it!  It looked like there was too much batter for one regular sized loaf pan, so I used 3 mini loaf pans instead and was able to cut down on the baking time, too.  It was easily enough batter for three 5&3/4" by 3" mini pans.

I love this bread! I made it a few days ago and its even better the second day. I used applesauce instead of the oil (to cut down on fat) and it turned out great! It is very moist.

I loved this recipe!  I added about 1 cup or so of mini chocolate chips, just for a chocolate kick.  It was gone in about a day!  I have already made this two times and can not wait to make it again!

This is a hearty banana bread.  I made the recipe with one substitution:  I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour.  It made it a bit drier, I think.  It was not geat at room temperature but I presliced it and kept the slices wrapped in the refrigerator.  A few seconds in the microwave and I had a great warm mid-morning snack.

This recipe was ok I followed it exactly and still it turned out slightly dry and bland, I may try substituting applesauce for the oil to give it a more moist and dense texture.  I also recommend adding another banana and more cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg.

This was one of the best banana bread recipes!  It's extremely moist (I think it's due to the oatmeal and banana combo) with minor adjustments to the recipe.  I used egg substitute, one less tablespoon of oil (didn't even notice it), 5 small to medium sized bananas, and an add'l 1/4 c. of white sugar (1/2 of that I used splenda - my hubby, who hates sugar substitutes, didn't even notice) because my hubby likes his banana bread sweetened just right and the extra 1/4 c. of white sugar didn't make it too sweet (I don't like my banana bread too sweet).  And it turned out moist and perfect!  I will definitely be making this quite often!

The bread was not that great regardless of the overall rating.  I think  a little bit more of sugar or chocolate chips could be added.  The bread is very dry and I would personally like it to be  more moist.

This is a great recipe!
I tried to make them as healthy as possible with what I had so I didn't put in the full cup of brown sugar, I didn't use as much oil and I used all whole wheat flour. I also made them as muffins and when they came out the outside was crunchy and the inside was nice and moist. Delicious!

Fabulous!! I couldn't believe how moist this recipe was. The oatmeal adds a wonderful texture without making the bread "oatmeally." I made muffins with this recipe, and they turned out great--they were a huge hit!

This is really great banana bread!  The only change I made was to use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour.  Everyone in my family likes it and I feel good about giving them something healthier than my usual banana bread recipe.  The oats give a great texture.  Thanks for the "keeper"!

This is a wonderful wholesome bread that the whole family loved!!  I made some of my own changes.  I added 1.5 cups of white flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.  I also mixed the bananas and sugar and let sit for 15 minutes before I used them.  I got this idea from my *old* recipe.  I say old because after making this bread, not only does it taste better then the bread I used to make, but I feel MUCH better serving it because of the better ingredients!
Thanks for sharing this one! =)

I used egg beaters, and added a little more cinnamon, some nutmeg for more flavor, and chopped pecans (didn't have walnuts).  It was awesome!  Next time I will add a little more banana (maybe 3 instead of 2).

This is a good bread, especially being low fat.  The banana bread I usually make is richer but I wouldn't have any problems replacing it with this one.  It's that good.

I thought that the recipe was slightly bland the first time, but with a few alterations it became more suited to my taste. I added extra cinnamon, too.

Excellent bread; very moist without adding lots of fat.  I substituted fat-free half and half since I had some on hand.  Most likely, it didn't make a difference.  Will definitely make this again and again!  Oh, I also added walnuts.

This was a good recipe on the day I made it because I had no white granulated sugar in the pantry but had brown sugar---the bread was very good shortly after cooling, but 2 days later, it was very dry....this could have been due to my bread box...maybe tupperware would have kept it moister.....

This bread turned out nicely, it was moist and delicious.  I used applesauce instead of the oil which worked quite well.  It was a little on the bland side, yet still very tasty.

My children don't eat bananas.  My husband and I let several bananas sit while we on vacation.  Instead of throwing them away, I made this bread and it was wonderful...very filling.
