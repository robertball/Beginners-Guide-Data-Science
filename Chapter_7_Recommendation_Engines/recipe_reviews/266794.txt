My family loved this! The only change made, was that, rather than serving the chicken alone, with veggies, rice or potatoes, Icombined the chicken with greek pasta  all baked together in the oven.

I would give it 4.5 stars, it was really good, but not quite 5 stars for me. Definitely a weekend meal, took too long for a weekday. I liked the favors together, especially with the lemon.

The prep took me longer than suggested, but I will have a better idea for next time because I will definitely make this again!

This was pretty easy and very good! Served with tzatziki sauce and cucumbers/tomatoes.
