This was good, but not great, although I normally love Hawaiian pizza.  The whole wheat crust was not as good as a regular type crust.  I also found that it cooked faster than indicated.  It was done in 14 minutes.

So yummy!  I followed the directions exact, except:  I didn't have any gouda cheese, so I just left that out (although I'm sure it was delicious too!) I also had a green bell pepper that was about to go bad,(I can't stand throwing out food!) so I chopped that up and browned with the onion.  Yum! I will definitely make this again!

This was WONDERFUL...my husband is a chef and usually when I try a new recipe he picks it apart with all the changes he would make.  He couldn't quit saying.."This is so good, I wouldn't change anything."   However, I did use store bought crust and I used canadian bacon instead of ham (it was cheaper!)

Two thumbs up!  It reminded us of our trip to Maui.  We especially liked the gouda cheese - it added a nice touch.  The dough was tasty - but came out thinner that I'd like.

Fantastic! I added some garlic and basil to the crust. I also chopped some red pepper to put in with the onion. The dough didn't rise very well, and after cooking the sauce sunk in to the crust a little too much, but the flavor was the greatest.

This was good, but very rich. The crust was tasty, and pretty easy to work with, but not my favorite texture ever, though that could be user error. I used half the mozzarella, ham, and butter, and found this to be a bit too rich for my tastes - I would probably skip the caramelizing step and just plop those onions on the very top to dry-roast when it baked. I found this pizza to be slightly overdone at 15 minutes using 425 temp. Thank you for sharing your recipe, this was a great new way to use up Easter ham!

I can't give this a five because I changed it so much!  But with my alterations...i give it a 5!  I was looking for a quicker recipe, so I used refrigerated pizza dough instead.  The bbq sauce I used was raspberry chipotle, and I just put however much I wanted rather than sticking with any measurements.  Lastly, the cheese I used was Fontina (it was on sale!) instead of Gouda, still mixed with the mozzarella cheese.  With all of these alterations...it was magnificent!!  Will definitely make again :)

This pizza was very easy to assemble and the time it took to make was well worth it.  Very tasty and my husband loved it.

Sorry..for my family it's way too sweet. Maybe the brand of barbecue sauce I bought is extra sweet. The idea and consistency was good but I would use regular barbecue sauce or even pizza sauce. I liked the gouda to give it a little different twist. We only ate one piece each and threw the rest away...

I can only review the toppings as I used my own crust recipe for the crust but I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was amazing! I didn't have a red onion, so I used a plain old yellow one and I didn't have any Gouda. I am sure those proper ingredients would just make it better but it is delicious either way!

We love this recipe!  If you don't have time, or don't want to make your own crust, Trader Joe's sells pizza dough for $0.99. It's fast, easy, and pretty darn delicious.

Delicious pizza!  I was really hesitant that I would like it, but decided to give it a chance, yum!  I didn't have any gouda cheese so I skipped it. I used the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust recipe instead of the one with the recipe since I was short on time, it was good together.  I will make this again for sure!

Used this recipe for the toppings only and used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust. I made three different pizzas and this was my family's favorite. The combination of flavors is fabulous. I left out the Gouda but otherwise made as directed. Will make again soon i'm sure.

Ohmigosh! So good! It certainly wasn't your typical ham and pineapple pizza. I really liked the flavor the carmelized onion gave this. I didn't have a red onion, so I used a vidalia. I used Masterpiece Honey BBQ sauce for this. I didn't make the crust as I already had some pizza dough made. Definitely great! I will make this again, thanks Stephanie, this pizza is fab!

Very tasty!  I used a Boboli pizza crust (for time's sake)and used mozarella and colby jack cheeses.  This was very yummy, no need to order out!

Thought this was great! Although I used frozen pizza crust instead of making my own.  The bar-b-que sauce paired really nicely with the ham and pineapple.  I'll definitely make this again.

I made my own pizza dough using the whole wheat and honey dough recipe from this site (my favorite "go to" recipe!).  However, I followed the directions for the rest of the pizza, just omitting the pineapple because I didn't have any.  I also used vidalia onion in place of the red onion...just personal preference.  MMMMM!  It was good.

I used the bread machine to make the crust.  I brushed olive oil on the crust before the sauce.  I think this prevented the crust from soaking up the sauce.

I used TJ's "Almost Whole Wheat" pizza dough.  I used 1 yellow onion instead of red.  Be sure to saute it for a good 15 minutes.  We loved this pizza!

It was pretty good. I added a 1/2 of green pepper and some more Gouda cheese. Had leftover ham from Christmas, so this recipe came up.

So good! I made masters pizza dough instead of recipes dough. Our toddlers even liked it.
