Great recipe! I omitted the tomato juice and only added 1 jalape√±o so that each individual can add hot sauces per their preference. We really enjoyed it!

This reminded me of a cross between ceviche and Mexican cocktail due to the addition of Clamato. We really enjoyed it and it is one I would make again.
