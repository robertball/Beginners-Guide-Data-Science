This is awesome. Made it with fresh Dill instead of the Mint. Next time I will try the more traditional approach and use Goat Yogurt.

Update (18 Mar 11): Living in Toronto, we have a massive Greek population and the well known Danforth (Greek Town). Many of my friends are Greek and it was well recommended to use Goat Milk Yogurt (Greek Yogurt).  So this time around I made it properly. Strained the Goat Yogurt for 24 hours. The thicker it is the better the outcome.
Try it, you won't be sorry.

This was a most excellent tzatziki!  I didn't see any reason to strain the greek yogurt as what I used (Greek Gods brand) was very thick already.  However, I did make sure to get as much water as possible out of the cucumber.  Also used dill (instead of mint) and 2 regular sized whole garlic bulbs.  Texture and weight were perfect! Loved that there wasn't mayo or sour cream in this recipe.  It's a keeper....am making more today!!

I've made this a few times as is and it's a very good recipe. I experimented with using minced borage and lemon balm from the garden in place of the cucumber and lemon juice and it turned out perfectly thick without losing any of the flavor (plus it saved some time). Fun to try if you have the ingredients around. Makes a wonderful dip for fresh vegetables.

We eat this at least once a week. I use three roasted garlic cloves, and 1-2 raw ones. I also use red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice. A dash of Cavenders Greek Seasoning finishes off my version.

After leaving in Greece for several years, and being taught how to make the real thing, I was OK with trying the roasted garlic, because it would give it more flavor, but NO way to put mint in it.

YUM! This was a last minute decision, so I couldn't allow the yogurt to drain overnight, but other than that, I made this exactly as directed, aside from halving the recipe. I think next time, I'll add even more roasted garlic for a bigger garlic flavor though. I was glad to come across this recipe and I will be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

How much raw garlic is 2 tablespoons? I used a whole bulb of roasted garlic, but it was too mellow for us to taste it enough just after making it and then the next day. I added another couple of raw cloves and the rest of the strained cucumber just before serving.

Very good overall.  I didn't have roasted garlic (and couldn't make because the oven was broken), so I used pureed garlic instead.  I didn't find it overpowering, but I would like to try it with roasted garlic next time.  I might also use more mint and lemon juice, as well as a little ground pepper.  Served it with freshly toasted pita triangles (toasted on the grill), as part of a Greek menu for dinner, and everything went together well.

I will make this again!

I didn't have Greek yogurt so subbed full fat (14%) sour cream. I used raw garlic (a couple of cloves; I did make a half recipe but I'd use easily 6 cloves next time) as I was a little short on time. Everything else remained the same. So good!

Nice recipe. I added some grated raw garlic as well as the roasted (I like that bite), and a little more mint.

very good. I liked the mint in it...you don;t taste it much after it has been sitting for a day or so and the flavors meld/just has a slightly fresh edge to the bite from the yogurt. Only comment was that I think it does need a little more roasted garlic. I could barely taste it....but that is a better problem to have/can always add more. The last tzatki recipe I tried was overpowering on the (fresh) garlic.

This is the first time I have made tzatziki and it certainly won't be the last!  Oh, such a good snack on a hot summer day.  I was surprised how much liquid came out of the yogurt - probably at least a cup or more.  It would have been nice to have some information on how to roast garlic - some of us have never done it and don't know how!  I looked for this info on this site, and wasn't very pleased with the recipe I found.  Any tips on how to do this well?

yum and yum! For garlic lovers only, but so delicious! Great over kebabs, greek chicken, or with pita/veggies. Update: have since added 1/2 tsp each dill and mint and let sit at least 3 hrs to meld flavors. Love it every time.

This was pretty darn good! I'm sure it would taste better with roasted garlic, but I was lazy and just minced 3 cloves, added it to 1/2 C fat free greek yogurt, along with shredded cucumber, some lemon zest (no lemon juice) and lots of dill. We're huge garlic fans here so the bite didn't bother us at all, perfect healthy treat for those calorie/fat conscious cooks(I also left out the olive oil.)! Thanks :)

Roast double the garlic and also add fresh garlic. The roasted loses some intensity.

Too much lemon flavor for my taste. I wasn't sure how much to salt it either.  The mint was a little strong as well.

For convenience sake, I sauteed finely chopped garlic on the stove while I prepped my falafel mix. Dang! What a tasty sauce! I'm always obsessed with tzatziki sauce when I'm eating out (and disappointed when I can't find it) so I'm thrilled there are so many good recipes out there. This was my first attempt, and it was pretty dang good! It felt like it was maybe missing a little something, but I can't put my finger on it. I'll try it again, this time making sure to roast my garlic!

There are so many ways you can use Tzatziki with meals: great for appetizers, and tasty accompaniment for just about anything shallow fried or roasted.  Keeps for a couple of days,

great base recipe although I actually prefer garlic powder to roasted or fresh.
