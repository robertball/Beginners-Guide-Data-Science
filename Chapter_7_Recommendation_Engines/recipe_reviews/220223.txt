This was ok. I didn't find the chicken to have enough flavor. I was surprised the ranch packet didn't add more flavor. I think it might be helpful to rub the seasoning on the chicken in advance to really let the flavors combine. I also think cooking chicken breasts for 45 minutes is way too long. I did the following: I first cooked the chicken for 20 minutes so that it was still slightly underdone. I then added the cheese soup asparagus and Swiss and put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes. Total cook time of 35 minutes. It was cooked perfectly at that point and juicy. I also had to turn up the temperature on the oven in the last 5 minutes to get the asparagus cooked and the cheese bubbling. I did like that the chicken and asparagus were cooked together so when you're pressed for time that is helpful.
