Loved these as did my family! The guacamole seasoning mix was very easy to find in my store with all of the Ortega and Old El Paso products....I believe my mix was Ortega brand (blue packet).  I used the whole lime and also the zest from the lime, I did add some chili powder, cumin, dried corriander and some dried cilantro flakes to jazz this up. Mixture is definately "wet" due to the ground chicken, I added about 1/4 c of plain bread crumbs to bind and make this easier to make into 4 nice burgers. Another tip is to lightly wet your hands with water before u make the patties....prevents the mixture from sticking to your hands. I made these in advance and placed in the fridge until dinner and then I grilled them on my Cuisinart indoor grill/griddle. Perfect and very tasty. Thanks!

DELICIOUS!  Just a head's up...  Guacamole seasoning mix is in the chip aisle.  I had quite a time figuring that out.  I didn't tell my DH that was in it.  (I knew he wouldn't eat it, he's very picky!!!)  He was ranting and raving about that this is something you would get at a restaurant.  Make sure you get the ciabatta bread.  It is worth the extra $.  Also for those that complain about it being bland, try adding a bit more of the guacamole packet, try a different brand of the guacamole packet & add a bit more lime. The lime really pops the flavor!  I've used a drier lime & could definitely tell the difference. An average lime yields 2 Tblsps juice.  So now I always make sure I have a healthy Tblsp full of juice.  We have made this recipe countless times. Getting ready to make again. :)

This recipe was a huge hit with my family. I was so totally surprised because my kids are so picky. I followed the recipe just as it was written, although next time I will probably use less cilantro. Only because I am not a big fan of cilantro. And I did use regular hamburger buns instead of cibatta, only because I didn't have any on hand.

First time using the guacamole seasoning, that stuff really smells bad!  I left the cilantro out and used parsley instead, I hate cilantro.  The ground chicken was so wet and sticky, but cooked up nicely.  I don't know if the cilantro would have given this a flavor boost or not, but I didn't taste a thing, too bland.

These were awesome although I did make one change.  I combined the guacamole seasoning, onion, cilantro and lime with 1 tablespoon of mayonaise then combine the mixture with the meat before forming the patties.  This makes a pretty squishy patty that can be hard to grill, but if you don't turn them until they are fully cooked on each side they will come out perfect.  The flavor was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!

these were pretty good, but not spectacular... the chicken needs more seasoning in my opinion. will make again, just add something more.

Wowzers!!  This was fantastic flavor!  No cilantro and used lime juice.  This was really really good!  Made quac out of the other half of the seasoning mix with 2 avocados!  YUMMY!  We didn't add salsa to ours on top.  I did add some guac to mine and it was even better!

Delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly (except for the ciabatta, which I couldn't find - but LOVE) and they were perfect.  Very moist and flavorful.  It doesn't even need additional salt or pepper.  My husband wasn't a fan only b/c he doesn't like any "ground poultry".  I will continue making these anyways ;)

Fixed as written with the exception of omitting the cilantro, as we don't like the taste. Doubled the recipe and used a whole envelope of guacamole seasoning. Ate plain, no bun, cheese or salsa and it had a great flavor. Will try with ground turkey too.

So far, these are the best chicken burgers I've ever made. I will say though, there were a few things I didn't have, so I basically made this recipe with just the ground chicken, guacamole seasoning, (which I made) and lime juice from a bottle. I served them on sandwich thins, and probably would not have used the special bread and cheese anyways, just bc of the calories. BUT, this was still amazing! I know if I had all the other stuff it would have been over the top. That being said, this still had a lot of flavor. I have never bought guacamole seasoning so I looked up a recipe, and made about 10xs as much so I could have it ready for next time. By the way, when it says in the recipe above to use "1/2 of a one ounce pkg of guacamole seasoning" that is roughly almost 2 tblsp. ;) Guacamole seasoning recipe- 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp dried minced onion or onion powder (I used powder) pinch of cumin to taste (I used 1/8 tsp) 1/4 tsp dried cilantro, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp salt. This is a single batch; you will need to do multiple batches to have enough. Enjoy! PS I made these with the BEST homefry method I've found, ever, also from this site. With these fries, you can use whatever seasonings you want, but if your cookie sheets are old, definitely grease pans as recipe states. I found it unnecessary to grease one of mine that was a new non stick. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-baked-french-fries/detail.aspx

This was absolutely delicious!  The ingrediants melded together wonderfully and it went fantastically with the Summer Corn Salad (which was tasy and refreshing)!  I will be making this recipe quite often.  Thanks for posting it!

My husband and kids love this burger (me too, of course!). I use the extra spicy guacamole mix (in our store it is located in the produce department), and usually forget to add in the cilantro. It is great either way. I like to top mine with sliced avocado and salsa. Delicious!

We enjoyed immensely. Didn't do them on the outside grill, but opted for a grill/stovetop.  Followed suggestions from others which included adding the entire packet of the seasoning.  My changes were adding lime zest, garlic and fresh jalapeno, chopped.  I drizzled a little olive oil in the pan and also on the burgers to prevent sticking and had no sticking issues.  For the topping, I took some Cheese Whiz and added a little more cilantro and chopped jalapeno pepper.  You can spread as much or as little you want on the burger.  We added sliced purple onion and tomato slices on the top of the cheese mixture and we were good to go.  We used the Torta rolls drizzled with a little olive oil and then lightly toasted.  Yum! A great alternative to beef burgers. Will be making this recipe again. Thank you for sharing.

These burgers had a nice refreshing taste to them. They were also nice and light. I followed the recipe except for the ciabatta bread, the store didn't have any. So i used regular hamburger buns. Will def make these again.

OMG, I just made these and they came out awesome!! You MUST try them. When we fired up the grill, it started raining, so I just fried them in a pan with some oil. Also, I only made 4 burgers, not 8. If you made 8, they would be too small for sure. We served them on the torta rolls from Costco (toasted in a pan w/ butter). As some others did, I used the juice from the whole lime and a bit more of the seasoning mix (to be safe). I also used ground chicken thigh meat (rather than breast). I'm sure that, along with the extra lime juice, contributed to why they were so juicy. Next time I will top with guacamole or avocado slices. Oh, and hubby didn't like the idea of topping it w/ salsa so he used ketchup (yuck, I know) but said he would try BBQ sauce next time. Oh and he hates cilantro so I didn't tell him I used it and he never even noticed. Ssshhh. Thanks Tozenuf for this fantastic recipe. So juicy and yummy! Will make again and again!!

Bored with my default turkey burger recipe when this popped up. DH loves spicy. This recipe looked like a quick meal.Excellent flavor. Easy. Different. Substituted ground turkey for chicken and used fresh lemon since I forgot to buy limes.

This turned out very tasty, indeed! It was over 100 degrees outside, and didn't feel like sweating over a hot grill, so I fried them in a cast iron skillet. these will be entered into our normal rotation. Even my finicky boys loved them and asked for more.

Made this tonight for the first time and got three thumbs up! Very easy to make and the lime "pops" through. I too was careful not to use too much Cilantro as I didn't want it to be overpowering. I added some garlic powder and didn't have the Ciabatta bread. I wound up using Martin's potato rolls which I toasted a bit on the grilled.

These were really good.  I can't wait to make them for company.  I winged it on the guacamole seasoning and just whipped up a combination of Fiesta Lime Mrs. Dash, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and garlic powder.  I served with sliced avocado and regular burger fixin's instead of the salsa.

I really liked this recipe and thought it was a great change to plain ole burgers. I usually don't measure items exactly, but I followed the ingredients pretty close for this recipe except I used ground turkey and queso blanco cheese. I also minced a jalapeno pepper after taking the seeds out (no heat)to add to the south of the border flare.

Absolutely beautiful! Thank you for sharing your recipe. The only thing added or changed to the recipe was the addition of some humus on the bread.

Everyone loved this!  I had a hard time finding the guacamole seasoning mix, but ended up finding it in the fresh produce section.

Other than that, it was a perfect meal for everyone.  I will make it again!  :)

These were fantastic!  Followed recipe except I used regular hamburger buns and used chipotle mayo instead of salsa.  Both my husband and 16 year old son said these were better than any regular hamburger.

Instead of using dried basil, I ended up using a BBQ chicken seasoning and added about 1/8 a cup of salsa and the burgers taste great. The only reason I could not give 5 stars is that I did not follow the recipe exactly.

my fiance loved this burger. I tweaked it a bit since we dislike peppers and cilantro. I also had only a pound of ground chicken, so I used less of the seasoning.

These were pretty tasty.  Nice change of pace from regular burgers.  They don't hold together well for an actual grill.  We cooked them in a pan on stove top.  It helps to put a whole in the middle of the raw patty before cooking, that way it keeps the middle of the burger from bulging up. About a 1/4 inch works great.  Make sure you have some guacamole to cover the bottom slice.  It gives extra moisture for the toasted ciabatta bread and it compliments the burger. We toasted the bread in the pan on both sides while the burgers were cooking. I did butter the inside of the buns a little before toasting them.  We will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for sharing!

My family liked these, although I thought they were a tad bland.  I made them exactly as per the recipe.  Next time, I would use the entire packet of guacamole seasoning.  Might also consider making with ground beef for the extra flavor of the meat.

Excellent. I couldn't find guacamole powder in the store so just put guacamole on top with the salsa instead.

These were wonderful! I used ground turkey bc the store didn't have ground chicken. Didn't use cilantro bc I don't care for it. Other than that didn't change a thing! Will make again.

Delicious. Didn't change anything other then add panko crumbs to help them stay together. Grill ran out of gas couple minutes after started and seared them on stove then popped in oven and was really good.

Really tasty, and the DH loved them too.  I found the guac seasoning in the chip aisle (Emeril's brand, in a green envelope).  I used ciabatta rolls (found in front of the deli case), and Sargento reduced-fat cheddar slices.  We also had some 100-calorie packs of premade guacamole in the fridge, so we used one for extra burger topping.  If you're watching carbs, this is just fine without the bread.  The burger is very moist and flavorful, and we will be making these again.  Thanks for sharing!
