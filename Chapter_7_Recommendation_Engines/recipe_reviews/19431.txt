This recipe is very similar to the one my great-grandmother used to make.  She added a few pats of butter and a few drops of vanilla extract at the end.  Oh, and she put the left over sugar in a cast iron skillet and cooked it in the over for about 35-40 mins at 375.  That gave her time to cook the custard.  I prefer it topped with a meringue.

Made this today and when I poured the caramelized sugar syrup, it all broke up into little bits of hard sugar all through the pie. I tried to pick it out the best I could, but some still remained. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I'm not planning on making this again

I used this recipe once before, I'm so glad it's here. My brother in law requested a caramel pie like grandma used to make and this was the only recipe i could find.  He loved it!! Thanks for sharing it.  I'm making it again.

I grew up on a pie made from a very similar recipe.Maybe a little less sugar. And Mom always made a meringue topping. Delicious.

I thought this was pie was way too sweet, but my husband liked it, so maybe it's just a matter of taste.

This didn't turn out well for me at all.  The custard was good, but the caramel picked up all the blackness from the cast iron skillet.  If I tried a next time, I'd definitely try the caramel in a heavy saucepan.  Very, very sweet.

I have tried this recipe twice now. Once chilled as a custard pie, which tasted like a custard brandy snap and was delicious. I received many compliments at a dinner party I took it to. Unfortunately I wasn't able to serve it with cream or ice-cream. I also made it again and decided to use up the 4 egg whites the recipe leaves by making a meringue frosting and toasting it in the oven. This completely changed the recipe in to a caramel meringue pie which is amazing but very very rich. Surprisingly the custard doesn't melt after being in the oven which is helpful. I made my own sweet shortcrust pastry both times.

I love how versatile this recipe is as the meringue completely changes it and it can be served both ways.

This is a great pie for using ingredients that you have in the pantry. As to too sweet I did not find it to be so. I used 1/4 cup less sugar in the filling but added it back in the meringue to top pie. Excellent Carmel taste. Caution on the Carmel you can burn it quickly so stay on top of that iron skillet action.

Followed the recipe exactly and it didn’t set even with overnight in the fridge (after it had already cooled to room temp). Also it was painfully sweet. Will not be attempting this again due to those two wrongs. Not worth wasting the good ingredients on a likely second fail.

I made this pie, following the recipe exactly, and found it to be lacking in flavor and boring. My family wasn't impressed either, so I won't be making it again.

I loved this pie! The taste was wonderful. It was a little runny but that may have been how I stored it.
