I was looking for a quick lunch today and this popped up fortuitously in an email! The idea of using mayo instead of butter to crisp the bread as well as basil with the cheeses sounded intriguing. I used Swiss, Mozzarella, a pinch of shredded colby jack and fresh chopped basil. Homemade low sodium white bread completed it. Unfortunately I had no fresh tomatoes :(

Even so, the  texture and taste was far superior to any grilled cheese I'd made before with butter or only 1 cheese. Big thumbs up! Calories 372, protein 23, Sodium 342.
