I made this recipie for last thanksgiving.  I made a regular (sugar based) cranberry sauce and this splenda sauce.  Everyone liked this one better, so this year, I'm only making one -- Splenda!

I am so impressed with this recipe.  I am having three diabetics for Thanksgiving and I have been searching for a good cranberry sauce.  After trying two others this is not only perfect but SIMPLE. I think the cooked down orange takes away the artificial sweetener aftertaste.  Excellent.

This Cranberry Sauce was great.  I did however not add all the Splenda (3/4 cup) as my husband has never even used sugar, but he loved the tart & sweet taste of the cranberry sauce.  A new believer in Splenda.  PS he is a new diabetic and now is a believer of Splenda.
