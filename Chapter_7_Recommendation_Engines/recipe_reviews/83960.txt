Quick and easy, the new marinade was a big hit at our house. I did not have all the correct spices, but substituted with garlic pepper and was delicious. I will have to try some of their other marinade flavors.

Delicious!  My husband is very picky about his steak marinades, and has requested this one three times now!  Definitely a keeper!

Flavor was great.  Even used the marinate on some shrimp.  The cut (rib eye) of meat was not our favorite, next time we will try this recipe on a different cut.

I don't like using bottled marinades, but this was very flavorful. I didn't have garlic powder w/parsley so I substituted a tsp of each and marinaded overnight. Will make this again.
