Used MacIntosh apples (what I had on hand), and used only 5 of them which completely covered the top of the crisp.  I don't like to make changes to a recipe first time through, but I just knew that this would have too much sugar and cinnamon for us (personal taste preference), so I cut back on both.  The house smelled wonderful while this was baking, and we could barely keep ourselves from cutting into it after it came out of the oven.  This was a sweet and juicy apple crisp with a flavorful cinnamon roll base, just delicious.  The most time consuming part of this recipe is peeling and slicing the apples, but it's time well invested because this one's a keeper.

This was delicious!!  Rolling the cinnamon buns out on the counter wasn't really working for me, so I unrolled the cinnamon buns in strips to cover the bottom of the pan.  I used Granny Smith apples and sprinkled just cinnamon on top of them.  I used only 1/2 cup of coconut palm sugar in the crumb mix.  I don't like things too sweet.  It came out great.  My husband and kids loved it.  In fact I just made it a couple of hours ago and it's almost gone.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this once for Boss Appreciation Day and once for my bible study group on Sunday mornings and both times it was a smash hit!! Everyone loved it the only problem I had was getting the cinnamon rolls into the pan as they tended to shrink once they were stretched out.

Amazing! My family loved this apple crisp. I stuck to the recipe, and it turned out great. The only changes I made was adding pecans onto of the crisp. It is even better when you warm it in the microwave the next morning! This is the new way we will be making apple crisp.

Just made this today and tried a piece after it cooled off. OMG this is the best apple crisp i have ever tasted. The only thing i did different was instead of the 8 granny smith apples i used 6 and my son and I love it! I will definitely make this recipe again!

As I am not a baker, this was pretty easy and tasted good.

It was okay.  Nothing special.  Followed the recipe and didn't change anything.  Probably won't make it again.  My family didn't even finish it.

I followed the directions exactly except I used honey crisp apples. I enjoyed the apple part and the sauce the brown sugar mixture made. No one in my house ate the cinnamon roll part. It just was weird and didn't belong. Mine also was slightly burned on the bottom though I followed the directions to a T.  I don't think I will make this recipe again. The idea was an intriguing one though. But as my husband said while eating it "If it ain't broke don't fix it." Regular apple crisp it is!

I liked everything about it. I had a few other people try it and for some reason they weren't fans of the oats so maybe next time I'll switch that out with walnuts or something. Thanx for the recipe :)
