We weren't too keen on this - there just seemed to be too much going on. We prefer regular steamed green beans tossed in a little butter, I guess. But thanks anyway.

I would make this again...I used japs instead of banana peppers and it added a nice spice.  Too much onion though and I didn't even use as much as it called for.

Nope. Beans got quite soggy and did not taste good.

Just what my husband loves with green beans, tomatoes, onions, green pepper and hot peppers. Not too much going on. The first time I made it I did not have hot banana peppers. I used Tabasco Sauce and figured he could always adjust the heat. Worked out fine.  It is delicious. Thank you for the recipe. Bernie
