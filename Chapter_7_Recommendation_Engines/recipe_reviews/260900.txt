I cut the recipe back to 12 servings and used a 9x13 pan.  Also, I kneaded the dough instead of the extra rise to save time.  The topping was sticky and sweet, just as you would expect and  I added extra chopped pecans,  for what is a pecan roll without a lot of pecans? Personally I prefer butter in the dough instead of shortening, but it was still very good.

Excellent, best caramel rolls in the world. The only substitution -I used a little maple syrup instead of corn syrup since I didn't have corn syrup. Made dough in the bread machine on dough cycle, then shaped the rolls and let rise, baked about 25 minutes. I did not bake the brown sugar and butter, forgot! but they turned out really well. So I will skip that extra step.

This tasted of disappointment.  I followed this recipe exactly.  It had very little flavor beyond sweet.  Next time ( if I were to waste the time and ingredients again) I would add more cinnamon and perhaps a touch of clove or nutmeg to the filling.  Unfortunately it just tasted sweet with no real flavors.  No caramel, no cinnamon, nothing... just blah.

Good!  This really makes alot!  I ended up using 2 9X13 pans and split them 13/14.  Turned out really good.  One of my pans got a little overdone-so my recommendation would be to watch oven carefully.  Start with the lesser time and watch.  I really wish I would have taken the one pan out sooner.  I also used honey and a tsp of cream of tartar instead of the corn syrup.
