Had a hard time finding Creme de Cocoa, but was worth the search.  Very tasty!  Great after dinner drink, although I enjoyed it before, and if you enjoy a sweet treat, this is definitely worth trying.

I have to admit the amaratto and gin used were not top shelf.  And I only had DARK creme de cacao, isn't there a LIGHT one?  I would also start with half the cinnamon and add more to your taste.
