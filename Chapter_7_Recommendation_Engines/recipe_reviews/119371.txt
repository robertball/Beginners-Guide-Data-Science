I have to confess that I am a buttermilk baking mix (you know the one) waffle kind of girl.  It's what I grew up with, and it's what I expect when I eat a waffle.  I wanted to try a yeast waffle, and since the total time listed was about in my time frame I chose this one (silly me for not reading the entire recipe before I started).  I got the batter together, and discovered that I had a 45-min rising time.  Egad!  So I made a batch of baking-mix batter, so we could eat dinner at a reasonable time.  So, we did some taste-testing last night.  After we'd eaten our way through the baking-mix waffles, the batter for this one was ready, so I made them, and we continued to eat -- everybody liked this recipe MUCH better than the baking-mix version (except me, of course, and I still liked them well enough to eat 2).  I didn't have a full stick of butter to put into the batter, and really, I think a tablespoon or two is plenty.  From the comments at dinner last night, it would appear that this will be our new waffle recipe!

Update: made again this morning for brunch, and this time I added a little more flour (batter was a little thin for my waffle iron) and put it together last night, refrigerating it overnight.  This was excellent!

These were pretty good waffles, let them go in the iron and they get nice and crispy. They are surprisingly light (not like the dense bricks you get when using straight pancake batter) I love baking bread so the yeast addition added a nice bit of flavor and additional lightness. As far as those who whined about the yeast, here's a hint not everything is supposed to taste like it came from a fast food restaurant.
    UPDATE : To make these AWESOME waffles, cut the butter in half and add an addition 1/4 cup of flour.

Very nice, easy recipe.  Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  A hit with adults and kids alike.

I've been looking for a recipe for light & airy waffles that taste great. No need to look any longer. I made a batch of these following the recipe exactly and was amazed at how quickly they disappeared when put on the table. Usually there will be a couple waffles left over with other recipes I've used, this time no survivors.
 I gave this recipe a 5 star rating only because I was not able to give it a 6. The way that these waffles turned out, I see no reason to tweak or change this recipe in any way. 
 Unlike some other recipes that I've read, this one did not seem too involved except for the 45 minute wait time for the yeast to do it's job, but good things are well worth waiting for. Some other recipes and box mixes are faster to prepare but the results are not even close.
  Thanks Helen, I'll be using this recipe from now on.

These are absolutely perfect! Soft and delicious on the inside and crisp on the outside. At first I thought that the batter was too thick but they came out wonderfully. Definitely worth waiting the 45 minutes

Loved 'em!  I tried this recipe because I didn't have to separate and whip eggs first thing in the morning.  One of my kids even liked just putting butter on it and eating it like a piece of toast!

These are excellent. Yes they take more time then recommended in my waffle iron but if you have the time they are worth it. Crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside and great flavor (I look forward to trying them with a bit of vanilla nest time). Just the kind of recipe I was looking for after trying so many that always turned out soft and got soggy with syrup.

Really, really good.  I am a mix kinda girl too so this seemed a bit more work that I would regularly do... until I tried them.  I added vanilla flavoring and a bit more sugar (maybe 2 Tbsp)and let the mix rest and rise for the full 45 mins. Light and chrispy.  I will make this one again but will take advise from another reviewer and make it the night before.  Great recipe!

Waffles are so traditionaly so easy to make, mix and cook.  This recipe you have to worry about temp., yeast, rise time, etc.  Not worth the effort.  The smell of the yeast threw me off while they were cooking and like another reviewer, needed way longer on my iron to cook in the middle.  Very mediocre taste.  Thank goodness I have three young boys that will eat almost anything with warm syrup on it or else this would have been a waste of a stick of butter.  Also, it did not stand up to the syrup.  It was only pleasantly crispy for a few seconds before it turned into mush under the syrup.  No thanks.

I loved this waffle! It was delicious and smelled so good (like baking bread) while baking in the waffle iron. My 8yo loved them as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

Just was I was looking for.  I thought the batter was too thin after waiting the 45 mins but tried it anyhow and thought they came out perfect.  I used egg replacement due to allergy and had no issues at all.  This is now my favorite waffle recipe.

This was extremely good. I ended up using a bit more flour as recommended by some other reviewers (maybe an extra half cup) and made certain to use properly warmed milk and eggs. My kids were going nuts like little animals and I left it for an extra 15 to rise while I was chasing them down...the batter was bubbling and hissing and had grown so huge by the time I pulled it out of the warm oven! 

These tasted terrific, the crispy outside gave way to a tender and moist inside...almost bread like..but more airy and light. VERY delicious waffles. Don't hesitate to try this recipe!

These were tasty, but no more so than un-raised waffles.  And holy cow, the batter was REALLY runny.  Next time I'd eliminate the extra 1/2 cup of liquid at the start and just proof the yeast in the 2 c of warm milk.

I have made these several times now. They are my favorite waffle recipe! Definitely worth the slight amount of effort required to make them. 
Only thing i would change is the prep time and ready time listed on the recipe. These aren't ready in 20 minutes. The batter needs to rest for 45 minutes before you cook it! Prep time is 60 minutes, ready in about 65-67 minutes.

For the amount of time and effort that this recipe took, I was a bit disappointed. I didn't tell my husband that I did anything differently, and he didn't notice. They took much longer to cook on my waffle iron than my standard waffle recipe. I will not make these again.
