Very good.  I used half the amount of honey in the dressing, and added grilled chicken.  I grilled the asparagus as well.  Next time, we'll add walnuts and more cheese.  Maybe substitute gruyere....still, this was a great salad.

I found the dressing lacking in complexity (simply sweet) and we were not fans of the combination of apple and asparagus.  I like roasted asparagus but don't feel it really worked well with this combination of ingredients.  If I made this again I would probably flash cook the asparagus in boiling water to retain some of its crispiness and add brightness to the salad. I would also make some sort of lemon vinaigrette instead of the honey dressing.  With all these changes, it is essentially a different recipe, so I will not be making this again.

I have made it a few times for company and have taken it to friends' houses.  Always a hit!

This was delicious, although the dressing was too sweet.  I tasted it and ended up adding more vinegar.  Liked all the components of the salad together, husband ended up adding tomatoes to his, but I was not liking the idea of tomatoes and apples, blech!  I will make this again for sure, but halve the honey.  :)

I like this salad very much. I failed to read the other reviews before making this yet cut the honey in half, just as the others did. I took the photo but then ended up adding grilled chicken and strawberries to make our dinner entree tonight.

We love this salad--even the kids eat it!  I use less honey in the dressing and I think it is plenty sweet. I also roast the asparagus for less time because I like thin asparagus so it gets done more quickly.
