Really great stuffing for the pepper. Next time I'm throwing it in rice and stuffing a bell pepper.  Only change to ingredients was that I swapped out 1/3 of the mild sausage with hot sausage and it was great.  When I made it i had extra sausage mix and instead of cutting more peppers to fill,  I over filled the ones I did have.  I don't recommend doing that because they became hard to handle while eating.

These were so tasty. I needed a cheeseless appetizer for NYE and this was it. I made as written and it made a great deal. I used Italian turkey sausage. These were spicy and sweet!  :)
I also  omitted the mushrooms because they aren't a fave of the kiddos.

We Loved these spicy poppers. Thanks BD Weld for the recipe. I will be making these pretty regularly for apps and parties.  I had some parmesan cheese I needed to use up so I sprinkled a tiny bit on top.  Cooking time was perfect and they were addicting like one of the other reviewers said. Served it with a cold glass of milk and YUM!

Yum, yum!  At first I thought these were too spicy, but the sweetness of the little bell peppers seem to mellow the heat, a bit.  I found myself going after another, and another...!  This is such an attractive dish-- the bright colors really light up the plate.  Thanks for posting!

All I can say is, I made them for family and friends and now, I can't make enough fast enough.   :  )  I did pre bake the raw peppers after they were cut in halves. I baked them with the cut side down so they wouldn't collect moisture.

These were tasty little morsels that were addicting.  I bet you can't eat just one.  If you love sausage, peppers and onions, you will love these.

I made this using our surplus of Carmen peppers.  It's a sweet pepper slightly larger than a banana pepper but just a sweet if not sweeter.  Because they are larger than the small sweet ones suggested, we had them for dinner.  The consistency of the meat  mixture made it easy to stuff the peppers.   It came delicious !  The 'stuffing' was very flavorful made exactly as called for.  We did have a plate of leftovers which we will enjoy again later this week.  We will definitely have this tasty dish again.

I thought these were pretty good, but then I put some chipotle tabasco on them, and they were fantastic

Made these for my husband for lunch today. He was having a bad day and these are right up his alley. I used spicy Italian sausage then topped them with a dab of sour cream and a little cilantro. On his second round, he put some cheddar cheese on them before topping with sour cream.  They were delicious and I will make them again, maybe even as appetizers at our next family get together.

Great snack/meal. I used regular size peppers and cut them into stuffable pieces. No ground sausage available , so bought some mild Italian sausage and cut off the casings. They even taste good cold the next day too.

11.8.16  This recipe really captures the best of a “spicy-sweet” appetizer.  Roasting the peppers makes them incredibly sweet, and the crushed red pepper flakes perfectly counterbalance  that sweetness.  Two other spices that really rock in this popper are the rosemary and the thyme, so don’t leave them out.  Winner recipe!

These were SO AWESOME! I've never made stuffed peppers before and we all loved the spicy-sweetness of these! They were a HUGE hit at the football party! We will make these again and often!

I must admit that I made an error in baking these little stuffed peppers because I put them on foil rather than parchment paper, and I do believe that's why they overcooked a little bit.  I do suggest that you watch your oven to make sure that you don't overcook these!  The ingredients were spot on perfect!  We really enjoyed these!  I cut the recipe to 5 servings, and I used a sweet onion rather than red because that's what I had.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and thought the spiciness was just right.  These will make a really wonderful appy for a party (I'm thinking Super Bowl or maybe some other significant/insignificant  occasion)!  My granddaughters will love this with a cold glass of milk!  Thank you once again, bd.weld, for a great idea!

A nice change to the usual stuffed peppers. I couldn't find the small peppers so I used regular bell peppers, just choosing the smallest I could find. I topped them with a bit of sour cream and parsley. Just the right amount of kick. Cooking times were right on. Thank you for the recipe.
