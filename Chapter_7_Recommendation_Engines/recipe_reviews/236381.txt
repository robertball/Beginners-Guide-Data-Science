Unfortunately, I made this for our daughter's first birthday cake and it was a disaster. The color was a pretty shade of pink but that's about all it had going for it. I've made cakes and frosting many times and never had one turn out so horribly. It was extremely runny, even after putting it in the fridge for a while to firm up. It also tasted too much like powdered sugar. Incidentally, I had meant to make the other strawberry frosting on this site but had this one pulled up by accident.

Very fresh tasting and it produced a lovely natural color.  It was a bit on the runny side but it worked well with the brownies I made it for because they soaked it up and it really enhanced the chocolate.  I can't wait to try the other fruit suggestions.

I followed the directions exactly, but it turned out to be very runny. I put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, and it was a little better. Next time I will use less then 6 strawberries. Sorry.

Nice! I can't wait to try the avocado green. I put the strawberries in the blender to puree. This calls for about 2 cups of sugar.

This is one of the most delicious frostings I have ever made! Each person I served it to loved the flavor. The consistency is perfect, and the leftover cake with this yummy frosting held up in the frig overnight.

Very easy, and delicious!  My family loved this frosting on chocolate cupcakes so much, they were really impressed by the strawberry flavor! It's unusual to have frosting with such nice flavor, and it was pink enough to satisfy my daughter's demand for pink frosting for her 3rd birthday.

The flavor was amazing, the whole family loved it but the texture was not what I expected. It was a little “liquidy”.

It's very tasty but the shade of pink is a little to light and it's only slightly runny

This is a pretty good frosting, doesn't have a really strong berry flavor though. I have made it with rasperries and added lemon and that is really good too.
