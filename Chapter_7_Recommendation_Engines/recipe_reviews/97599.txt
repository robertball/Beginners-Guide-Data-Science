We had this salad at a popular neighborhood steak house a few weeks back. I am so happy to be able to recreate it at home! I don't mess with making the dressing, however. It's much easier to substitute your favorite bleu cheese dressing instead. This is a very refreshing, delicious salad.

My hubby LOVES a wedge of iceberg lettuce and this was over the top for him. I put the cheese right into the dressing and added more than called for. We all loved the twang that the buttermilk offered. Great dressing and great idea. Thanks!

This was amazingly delicious! While not a fan of iceberg lettuce, this salad needs iceberg to pull it off. The combination of the bleu cheese dressing, warm bacon and cold tomatoes was a perfect addition to the meal. This one is a keeper in my recipe file.

this is so basic and simple and so good. instead of chopping and spinning lettuce just wedge it and top it with any dressing. who woulda thunk?

So much better than bottled dressing - worth the extra effort! I like fresh lemon juice rather than vinegar though. For a different flavor sometimes I use diced tomatoes and/or chopped walnuts.

I'm trying to eat more salads, and this sounds like a wonderful alternative! I may have to change the dressing ingred a bit to allow in my daily calorie intake! Thanks for sharing - I can't wait to try it!

This was really incredible. If your feeling like you want to be indulgent, go more gourmet on the roquefort. If you are feeling calorie conscious, give turkey bacon a try. I did both, and it was delish! I also put some leftover dressing in a container and brought it with some sliced carrots and celery to work~YUM!

So simple and so DELICIOUS!!  We made this last night and everyone loved it!!  The dressing was perfect!  I will not have to buy blue cheese dressing from the store again!  This is so much better.  I put some of the blue cheese directly into the blender and gave it a quick whirl and then stirred some additional blue cheese into the dressing to make it chunky. Make the dressing a couple hours before serving as the flavors blend and taste so much better.  Sprinkling blue cheese on top of the prepared wedge makes for a beautiful display and additional flavor.

I much prefer using other green salads (in fact I usually never even buy iceberg) but my friend loves iceberg wedge-style salads so I made this for her.  She loved the dressing and thought the bacon was a nice touch.

Nice healthy variation on a BLT. When I make this next, I will omit the buttermilk from the dressing - didn't much care for the twang. Thanks!

I loved this salad and I don't even care for iceberg lettuce.  The dressing is da bomb.  Even using all the typical low fat items such as low fat mayo, sour cream and buttermilk this still knocked my socks off.  The directions aren't clear on the cheese so I put some in the dressing and saved some for crumbling directly on the salad.  Nice presentation too.  Will definately make this again.

One of our favorite summer suppers.  4 stars as I used a different dressing recipe with more spices and the blue cheese in the dressing as well as crumbled on top.  I prefer gorgonzola cheese when I can find it for a reasonable price.  A classic!!

THIS IS AN ICEBERGE WEDGE SALAD! I'm sure it would be delicious with any number of greens but it wouldn't be a wedge salad.

I NEVER eat iceberg lettuce but made this for some picky dinner guest who ONLY eat iceberg lettuce.  This was delicious.  The dressing was great and it tasted like one of those Wedge Salads from a Steak Restaurant.

I love wedge salads but I very rarely make them - and never even think about them, so I was happy to trip over this recipe in my search. A good one, thanks!

This is great.  I am a little perplexed that the dressing ingredients call for no cheese and yet, the directions call for leaving some lumps of the cheese when mixing. One of the rest. that I go to put candied pecans on top and I think I will do the same thing next time I make this!

Wonderful flavor.  Great use for extra iceberg. My family requests this salad often!
