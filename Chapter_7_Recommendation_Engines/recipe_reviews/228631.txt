I don't care for how most sauerkraut dishes, but this is how I remember enjoying sauerkraut in Germany.  It is delicious!  My only suggestion is to always rinse sauerkraut using warm water and drain well.  I've also made this recipe using white wine and beef broth instead of sherry and chicken stock.  I like to serve this with any pork or sausage and red skin boiled potatoes.

I add a little bit of applesauce, sliced apples, and apple juice instead of the sherry.  This variation was taught to me by my mother-in-law, whose own mother made it like that when she was growing up in Germany.

Don't expect typical stinky American sauerkraut with this recipe.  This is sweet and doesn't even taste like cabbage.  This is how sauerkraut is made in Germany and the recipe is very easy and good.  I am a vegetarian and so I used butter instead of bacon grease and vegetable broth instead of chicken stock.  It still turned out great.

I made this dish and we all loved it! I made one change I started off with Johnsonville Bratwurst sausage, I wiped my skillet down with Olive Oil added the sausage and let them simmer while covered with a lid  for about 15 minutes, I added the onions and simmered for another 5 minutes or until the onions were soft. I removed the sausage and started to follow the recipe from that point by adding the rinsed and drained Sauerkraut.  At the end of the recipe I put the sausage back into the Sauerkraut to simmer for about 10 minutes my total cook time was an hour and 30 minutes, I wanted my Sauerkraut soft not crunchy. I also cooked the entire meal in the skillet cover with a lid.

This was excellent. Most other ones call for tons of fatty pork but I swear this makes kraut which is just as good.  I appreciated the other reviews.  Am on vacation and didn't have enough sherry so added wine to make up the difference.  I'll try another reviewer's suggestion of red wine today.  Thanks to all.

This recipe has a delicious flavor. Used the bacon in the recipe that I cooked for the drippings. My Bavarian mother in-law gobbled it up, saying how good it was. Served it with a pork roast and roasted fingerling potatoes.

This was very good. The caraway seed flavor was a little much for me but my husband and kids loved it. I would probably reduce the caraway seed to half or 3/4 next time. But that's strictly a preference, overall very good.

I grew up eating home made kraut, store bought does not come close. This recipe takes that plain old bag of kraut and makes it delicious. I have found my go to kraut recipe from here on out.

I cooked the bacon to have the drippings. I used twice the amount of drippings the recipe listed. I did not cook the bacon until crispy. I added the soft bacon to the pot. Also, I decreased the onion to 2/3 cup. My husband loved it!

Buying canned kraut is just fine.
This recipe shows you how to quickly make a great sauerkraut.

I've made it a few times exactly like this recipe and it's great.

The last time I made it...well I was short a few ingredients.

So instead of Sherry I used a peeled apple.

I didn't have caraway seeds so I only used Salt and Pepper.

I poured around 3/4 of a beer over and the kraut in a Crockpot and added 3 lbs of Polish Kielbasa on top.

Just know that using canned sauerkraut is totally fine and if you don't have all of the ingredients -  well that's okay too!

Recipe is excellent as is. However, one great tasting change for those who enjoy a bit more sweet and a little less sour - - peel and core two medium apples. Slice very thin, add to ingredients and enjoy! More like the way sauerkraut is made in Berlin.

Did not have any sherry. I think it did not affect the dish. It was great, and I will definitely make it again.

12-20-2015  ~Our Green Bay Packers were playing and we planned a fitting menu of brats, sauerkraut...  and beer.  Hubs, believe it or not, prefers his kraut straight out of the package, drained, and cold.  Yuck.  Since he was busy watching the game, he had no clue what I was up to in the kitchen, which was preparing this recipe to go with the brats. Tonight there would be no cold, TOO sour sauerkraut on those brats.  I followed the recipe closely with the exception of eliminating the caraway seeds and using a good, dry sherry instead of cooking sherry which, in my opinion, should not be in your pantry – ever.  As it was cooking, I got pretty much what I expected when I tasted it; sauerkraut with an overwhelming wine taste. It does require the half hour or so of simmering, during which time it mellows out completely.  Also, the overwhelming sourness of the sauerkraut mellows as well… but almost too much!  The bottom line is, I did enjoy this, Hubs thought it was “okay,” but ideally something in between this flavorful, but almost too mellowed out sauerkraut and the bold sourness of sauerkraut straight from the can (yuck!) is what I’d prefer.

We had a St.Paddy's party and made Reubens. This was the perfect recipe for the sauerkraut. The bacon drippings and sherry age it a special flavor. Don't be afraid to add extra sherry as it cooks off. 
This recipe is a keeper!!!

Made this to go with a pork tenderloin.  Thought it was excellent.  I used all of the ingredients listed.  I wound up cooking it twice as long as suggested, but I like my sauerkraut smushy, not crunchy.  I wasn't sure about the sherry taste, but it def. cooks down into a very subtle flavor and adds just a , faint detection.  I will def. make this again.  Thank you for the recipe.

I have never liked sauerkraut, one of the many ways that I disappointed my ex-wife because her family was from northern Ohio and it was a fairly common meal component in her youth.

I made this recipe for our group's semi-monthly meeting meal to accompany some top quality beer brats & andouille sausages, and it was met with rave reviews. One member of our group is an older German man named Hans, and even he approved, no mean feat. Be sure to go easy on the caraway, I'd say.

Excellent, My go-to recipe for sauerkraut. Like other reviewers, I use apple juice instead of sherry and I increased the juice and stock to a total of about 1.5c. I love to add Penzeys Tsar Dust Memories Russian seasoning while it is cooking. Perfecto!

I made this for dinner but made the following changes (just personal preferences) I used a 2lb bag of Silver Floss Barrel Cured Sauerkraut, doubled the amount of bacon drippings, and tripled the amount of caraway seed. I also substituted a half can of beer for the sherry

This was awesome!  I even cut a corner and skipped the bacon and onions because I was in a rush, substituting some onion powder, and it was still great.  I added it to a pork roast for an early New Year's dinner, and everyone loved it!

Great recipe!  I double the recipe. First dice a pound of bacon and fry it. Then add a diced onion and 6 cloves of diced garlic and fry that to the bacon. When the onion is soft I add a stick of butter then follow the recipe from there. I also turn up the heat at the end to fry the cabbages a little bit. Best sauerkraut I’ve ever had!

We really liked this!  It comes very close to the German sauerkraut I used get at a local German Deli.

Best kraut I've ever had. I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. I loved that it's not as sour as your average kraut and I my boyfriend and I couldn't get enough. I will Definately make this again.

I made this sauerkraut one day and served it the next...it was really great!  Lots of compliments on the tasty stuff...I did use the bacon I browned up in the kraut to give it a bit more flavor, oh and finely chopped some garlic in with the shallot.  I browned up some brats cut them into pieces and then added the sauerkraut.  A bit of German mustard on the side...really nice.

I didn't have 30 minutes for it to simmer but it was still very tasty to go with our New Year's pork. I am looking forward to trying it the right way next time.

I have to admit I added a couple more tbs of brown sugar. to just one 16 oz of sour kraut.  but I was looking for a sweeter kraut for my pastrami & Swiss toasted sandwiches with miracle whip on the toast. so yummy.

Had to make it Vegan so used olive oil and veg. broth and doubled the spices by adding 1 t. Pensey's Bavarian Blend to the called for 1 t. (ground) caraway seed.  The sherry is an excellent addition.   A good dish to make ahead for Thanksgiving.  Next time I will brown whole caraway seeds and grind them fresh.

Made it to directions - even used quality Sherry rather than cooking Sherry. Had no idea that husband hates caraway seed (which I thought was best part). I liked that it didn't use a lot of butter, husband wanted traditional Ukrainian.

I love how it took the bite away from store bought sauerkraut.   The ingredients were simple and already in the house.  Easy to make and had more flavour from the bacon drippings and chicken broth vice straight vinegar.  Will make this again.

I will definitely make this dish again.  It is not as harsh as a typical sauerkraut dish and very flavorful.  I only made 1/2 of the recipe and it was plenty to serve 4 with some left over.  My only change was to add a small diced apple before simmering until most of liquid is gone.

Best sauerkraut recipe I ever had. Add a little bit of apple cider vinegar just before it's ready, fits real good with the rest of the flavors, and by the time it's all cooked up the original brine has been tempered by the other flavors.

This recipe is great but I made a few adjustments. Substituted lager instead of the chicken stock and added a tablespoon of agave nectar as I felt it needed a little something. Will definitely use this recipe again.
