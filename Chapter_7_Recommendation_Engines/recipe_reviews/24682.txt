I used leftover pork tenderloin for this.  I followed the recipe exactly except I only used 1 whole onion.  Three just seemed like a lot and would have been mostly onion if I didn't cut it down.  We enjoyed the "sweet" flavor that browning the onions gave it.  The brown sugar was just right. Served over egg noodles and was even better the next day.  Thanks for a great way to use leftover pork!

I used leftover porkloin roast in this, added some garlic powder and some italian seasonings.  Served this over pasta with grated romano cheese.  My family really enjoyed this. Easy to make and a good way to use up the leftovers.  I plan to try this with chicken also.

We are a flat of students, and when looking for a pork recipe of ANY kind we stumbled across this wee jem.
It is easy to make and most of the ingredients you should have lying around the house.
The taste can be a bit sweet, but just add a little less sugar...
Not the fanciest recipe on this earth, but tastes great!

This is a good recipe for leftover pork roast. To cut the fat calories I omitted the oil and sweated the onions & mushrooms with 1-2 Tbsp water instead. I also omitted the butter & flour to thicken the gravy and used 3 Tbsp cornstarch instead. This cuts the fat from 51% to 10%, which is significant for anyone watching their calories. I found the sauce a little to tomatoey and omitted the brown sugar & added 2 cloves of minced garlic & 1 Tbsp dried oregano.

I had a good amount of leftover pork tenderloin that I wanted to use up and this recipe was just the ticket. I usually make barbeque, but this is a much better recipe. The pork was very tender and the sauce was wonderful. I served it over rice and added a side vegetable and it was a quick dinner.

My family loved this recipe.  It was perfect for using a leftover pork roast we had the previous night.  Nice flavor.  I highly recommend trying this recipe to anyone.

I never know what to do with leftover roasts...they get boring the second time around. This is awesome! My husband and I both loved this recipe. I, like others, didn't have tomato sauce so I used spaghetti sauce instead and added garlic (I rarely cook without it!). Other than that, I followed it to the tee. For those who have tried it and didn't like it, or felt it "was bland", try it again. This time, don't use a non-stick pan for browning the meat and onions. You don't get the roux you need to give it flavor. I have every intention on trying this again with leftover beef and chicken. There's no reason that this won't work with any meat! Absolutely loved it! Thanks!!!

This was a quick and tasty way to use up our leftover pork loin.  Everyone enjoyed it; the only changes that I made were to eliminate the lemon juice and double the brown sugar...I also carmelized the onions and only used 1.  It was a winner!

Not too hot.  The sauce was a little disconcerting.  Too sweet or something.  I am looking for ways to use up pork from a port roast but I will not make this again.

Pure comfort food. Just loved it.  Used leftover pork  roast and followed the recipe to the T.  So much nicer than making yet another pulled pork with the leftovers.  The gravy is unbelievable. Thanks so much Sudie.

Very good. Needs some Cheddar Cheese.  Then add some black beans and corn, top it with a dab of sour cream then wrap it in a tortilla.

This recipe was good man! I always wondered what else you could do with pork besides make a pork chop and now I know. It is kind of Italian if you do it over pasta or just regular homecooking kicked up a notch. Definitely worth trying. Left overs do not last that long.

Not a fan of this recipe at all. It tasted like I had simply poured cream of tomato soup over various leftovers. Won't be trying it again...

This recipe exceeded my expectations. I had leftover pork loin & was looking for a way to use it . Based on other reviews, I only used 1 medium onion. I saut√©ed the onion & added a clove of garlic to some olive oil. I used some salt & pepper as I added each layer. It smelled amazing, even before I made the gravy. I almost did not add the tomato sauce, because the gravy looked so good. I only used a generous pinch of brown sugar. It all came together very nicely. I let it simmer for a bit, and added some water as it thickened. I had a small amount of sour cream & added it at the end, just before serving. I served it over rice with some steamed asparagus. My husband went back for seconds. I will make this again & maybe not even with leftover. It would be great with beef or chicken also.

I followed the recipe as written. I used left over pork loin. The meat was well done so it fell apart as I stired it and had a shredded apperience. So the dish didn't look ver nice but it tased very good. It is somethins I will used again. Next time I will used left over pork chops so the meat doesn't fall apart. I put it over whole wheat pasta that was very good to.

I agree it tasted a little like tomato soup, but more like a savory tomato bisque, which I absolutley love, so I enjoyed the dish very much!  I then borrowed the idea of the base minus the tomato to start a creamy mushroom soup and that was delicious as well!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used leftover smoked pork loin and followed the recipe exactly other than adding a dash or two of cayenne pepper and 1 tsp of minced garlic. Served over angel hair pasta and topped with shredded Parmesan cheese. We will make this again!

I had some wonderful leftover roast pork and wanted to use it well, and had great hopes for this recipe.  I followed it exactly, but we were disappointed.  The sauce was way too thick and heavy, and masked the flavor of the meat.

I just made this recipe today. It did notgoover too well with my family. The sauce was a strange color and added a negative to eye appeal. The texture was lacking as well. I wouldn't attempt this recipe again.

I  have never had any luck with pork roasts.  They are either too dry or undercooked!  Edie DeSpain's Savory Pork Roast recipe sounded so good I just  had to try it.  with a 5# roast and only 3 for dinner, I did have leftovers.  I cut the pork quantity down to 2 half-inch slices; cubed those, sliced 1 onion and then used the full gravy recipe.  Served over noodles.  Still had enough gravy to make one more meal!  Scrumptious!  Even my picky great grandson loved the roast.  Too bad he missed out on the second act! Will definitely do this one again.

Thought that this would be a great recipe to use up some leftover pork tenderloin. Followed recipe as is, but as someone commented previously, it tasted like tomato soup, so we added some maggi seasoning sauce and simmered for about 30 mins.  That certainly made it taste better- though out of my family of 4, only 2 of us ate it.  Disappointing...

This recipe was barely okay.  The sauce reminded me of canned tomato soup.  I found it very bland and it had a very unpleasant colour.  In an attempt to jazz it up I  added garlic, chicken broth, and salt and pepper.  It helped by improving the taste but the colour really turned me away.  My kids wouldn't even taste it and I didn't feed it to my husband because I knew he wouldn't eat it.  I won't try this recipe again.  Sorry.

This is horrible! It ruined a nice pork butt that I had leftover. The tomato sauce and milk are not a good combination in my opinion. I will never make this again. I tried based on the reviews and boy am I sorry I did.

The sauce can be slightly bland, but this is perfect comfort food.  Probably make again.  Too many onions for people that don't care for them, but I enjoy them.

First one star rating I've given a recipe here. This was supremely boring and rather bland as is. I added some favorite seasonings and the sauce just never got to a really good flavor. It was certainly edible but absolutely not a recipe I'll be making again.

I made it with nut milk and it seemed a bit too sweet for me. My husband LOVED it! He tends to enjoy sweeter foods than do I.  I had to use more flour as mine just didn‚Äôt want to thinken. We‚Äôll try it again with shrimp (hubby‚Äôs request)!

I added some Thai chili sauce and mustard to the sauce as it tastes more like tomato soup without the additions. It's delicious if you like a creamy sweet sauce, but we like to kick it up a bit.

Great way to use up leftover pork tenderloin.  Used only one onion, though.  Three would have been overkill. Very good.

I made this using left over pork roast. It was really unique and it will be one of my go-to recipes. I only had one onion, but that seemed sufficient. More might be overkill. And, I didn't have rice or noodles, so used baby potatoes baked in the oven. They were wonderful.

I followed the directions closely, and it was awful, so I  added 3tbsp Worcester sauce and a tsp pepper, it still looks and tastes like tomato soup paste with meat, and looks nothing like the photo on the recipe. I actually think I'm going to throw it out and start over.

I wanted to like this but just couldn't. It was edible at the most...that said, if you love tomato soup then you may like it. I did not use as many onions thank goodness and the color was not appealing.

Other then the brown ish colour of the sauce which some have said looks not appealing, taste wise it is nice with reduced sugar. Added some maggi like 1 reviewer said and it enhanced the flavour. Good way  use up my 1/2 pound porchetta roast fr0m another dinner which turned out  just so-so . No meat wasting in this household.

Wish I could rate this higher. My hubby told me in between mouthfuls that I better make sure to leave my review, we enjoyed this dish immensely. I had half of a small pork roast leftover and had no clue what I could make to stretch it to feed us again differently and came upon this recipe. The only thing I  did was to cut the recipe in half to make up for the shortage of meat I did have. Excellent dish. I served it over no yolk egg noodles but I could see that this dish would go well with rice or even mashed potatoes for that matter. I did have just a small lunch size portion left for the next day and it was even better. Thanks for posting a great recipe!

I made this last night and it was very good.  My onions were fairly large so I only used 2.  I did not have fresh mushrooms so used a 10 oz. jar of mushrooms.  I put in the mushrooms and their juice and let the juice boil off before going to the next step.  I used this recipe on angel hair pasta and it worked well.
The sauce looks a lot like vodka sauce from the prepared jars in the grocery.

I used 1 large vidalia onion and sauted until caramelized. Omited the tomato sauce and used one large ripe beefsteak tomato which I added after sauteing the mushrooms. I served it over broad egg noodles. It was absolutely delicious. Filing the recipe to use again.

This is an easy recipe! As written, I thought it would benefit from a bit more flavor. I added white wine to butter/flour roux and dried mustard (1/4 -1/2 teaspoon) plus a few shakes of red pepper. While simmering, put in a bay leaf. Fresh parsley at end! Really comforting and good

Awesome, awesome recipe.  I subbed spicy mexican tomato sauce which made for an intriguing sauce that my family couldn't get enough of.  Also, one onion instead of three worked out just fine.

I had a hard time rating this because I did change the recipe but what I did come up with was very good. Since a lot of people referenced the tomato paste not just the color but the flavor, I left it out all together. I only used about an onion and a half and instead of milk I used heavy cream which gave it a richer flavor. The heavy cream was a little thick so I added about a half cup of milk to thin it out. I used all of the other ingredients and I loved the brown sugar in it, it gave it a sweeter flavor but I did not find it too sweet. I would have liked to have added the tomato paste but since there we so many that didn't care for it I didn't want to ruin the whole thing. I enjoyed the version I came up with.

I used leftover pork, reduced onions to one, and added a few cloves of freshly minced garlic to saut√© with onions. Since the pork was already edible, this took maybe twenty minutes. It was scrumptious -- sweet, savory, and moist! This recipe will be enjoyed by my family for years to come. Thank you for sharing!

Overall, this was a good recipe.  I usually get frustrated with reviewers on this site because it seems that nobody ever just cooks the food and reviews the recipe as-is.  I guess I'm going to be guilty of it this time.  I used 1 pound of left over smoked pork loin .  Instead of "browning" the meat and onions, I put the pork and onions in a cast iron skillet, covered it and simmered for a good while allowing the onions to sweat.  Added the mushrooms and simmered a bit longer.   Made the sauce as directed, but found that alot seemed to be missing.  I wound up using 2 -  8 oz. cans of tomato sauce.   Still needed something, so I added a couple of generous splashes of good Merlot  and a good splash of half and half.  Simmered for a bit more and found that it needed salt and pepper.  The extra liquid ingredients made for a "saucier" dish, but that was fine.  Served it over radiatore and it was quite good.  I didn't find the "tomato soup" taste that others commented about and did not find the color off-putting. The color and consistency was very similar to vodka sauce.

I made changes solely because I didn't have all the ingredients but I think it turned out well! Instead of the mushrooms and milk I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and about 1/2 cup of milk. Instead of the tomato sauce I used 1 cup medium salsa.  I also used less onions as indicated by others. (a little more than 1/2 of a large white onion) My hubby commented on how good it was and that I needed to record my changes for next time!

Wonderful recipe! Will definitely make again. So nice to have a change from my usual leftover pork recipes. This is what I now think of first when left with leftover pork loin. Thank you.

Nice dish, easy.  Did make some changes, used two onions and would cut down on the brown sugar and liquid next time but overall tasty.  Would make again with changes.  Thanks for posting.

I made this recipe exactly as shown. Pretty good as is  and definitely a good recipe to add ingredients that work for you. I used two onions and could have saut√©ed longer. Used more leftover pork roast than called for. My sauce could have been thinner and I would add more lemon, brown sugar and salt next time. A touch of hot sauce or cayenne or a chopped apple could work too with a dash of white vermouth. So many options but a very good basic recipe!

I used the recipe with leftover roasted pork shoulder and it turned out very good.  I served it over angel hair pasta.  Very nice tangy taste to the sauce too.

I took another reviewer's advice and added corn and black beans with sour cream as an optional topping.  The kids loved it.  A great way to recreate last night's dinner - with many ingredients already on hand.

I used leftover pork tenderloin and followed the recipe exactly.   We thought it was very bland and tasteless and not very pretty, either.   I won't be making it again.

I was actually surprised it was very good. For me, it's a great way to use leftover pork loin because I'm not a big meat eater and I'm picky about leftovers. Will make this again. I used one huge onion and almost a pound of mushrooms.

Throw in some meat and veggies, and it's not horrible.  Both adults, the 2 and the 1 year old cleaned their plates.  We talked about what a strange dish it was, however, throughout the entire meal.  I don't think we would make it again.

Like many others, I was looking for ways to use up pork loin leftovers. I came across this and I have to admit I was skeptical of how it would turn out and even more skeptical as I as preparing it. It looks kinda wonky and smells like tomato soup. I was trying to imagine what tomato soup would taste like on noodles. My boyfriend was not too anxious to even try it.  All I can say is don't judge this recipe until you taste it.  I followed the recipe but only used one onion.  We had it with egg noodles. With our first bite we were pleasantly surprised. I would make it again.

This was delicious, everyone enjoyed it, dropped a star as it could use a bit more spice. I made it with leftover pork roast and very close to the recipe, the differences were I only used one medium onion, as others have suggested here, and didn't want to open a large can of tomato sauce for 8 oz. so i diced up 2 medium tomatoes and simmered them with the mixture. It's a bit more work than just a can of soup, or instant gravy but well worth it. Served it over noodles with frozen mixed California vegetables.

I found it truly awful. I tried a number of things to try and save it since some very nice leftover pork tenderloin was sacrificed for it. I added garlic powder, a few shakes of soy sauce, a little vinegar. Gave it a bit more zing, but was still not great. Won't make it again.

Made with Rice.  Little bland, but still a solid 5!  As a main dish, serving size for 5 is better for 4.  Would be excellent with chicken, sausage or beef.  Next time will add a bit more spice, maybe spiced tomato sauce; Chinese pepper sauce; cut green onions; pineapple chunks; etc.

I had a 1 lb leftover pork roast, and decided to do something with it to surprise my wife.  I followed the instructions to the letter, except my onions were pretty big so I omitted one.  This is really good!  I received mucho wife approval, and not just because I cooked for once.  Very tasty, great flavor.  It's really better than just a "leftover" solution--makes a great dish.

My daughter enjoyed this recipe, and it was a good way to use leftover pork loin. Instead of tomato sauce, I used leftover marinara sauce I had. The outcome was pretty good.

I didn't love it, but my dad really enjoyed it.  For this short-sighted cook, a note to start rice or noodles may've been helpful at the start or the recipe (but that's my fault).  Has a pretty strong pork flavor, but after adding sriracha (which others suggested) and extra lemon juice, it added enough flavor to be a good combination.  Agree with others who suggest cutting down on the sugar a bit, as I went a bit below, and it teetered just short of excessive.  Really didn't taste the tomato as much as I might've hoped, but perhaps that was better for the dish overall.  All-in-all, pretty happy with the meal as it was a creative way to use leftovers, and dad really liked it, and I thought it was fair.  In my list to probably make again.

Used this with leftover pork loin and it was delicious.  I did add 5 garlic cloves and I only used 1 onion as 3 onions seemed like it would be too much.  I also added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar.  My husband really enjoyed it, as did I, and we served it over rice.

It is horrible...I used 1 onion because 3 is way too many. I cant even explain it.  I may do this basic recipe again but im going to make a brown gravy for it NO tomato sauce. I do not even want to feed this to my husband when he comes home from work. Then maybe he will like it as to where I do not.

Used left over roast pork for this recipe, so added it later than suggested in the original recipe.  I too thought that the 3 onions was too much, so cut down to one onion and also added 1/2 a red pepper which I saut√©ed  with the onions.  I made the original sauce and thought it too bland so added some freshly black pepper and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce which improved it quite a bit.  I may make this again, but would be tempted to use chicken stock rather than milk or maybe half of each.

I had quite a bit of pork roast leftover and decided to try it out. I followed the recipe, but it didn't really wow my family. My children aren't picky, but my husband is. "It was ok" from my husband means: I'm not wanting to have leftovers of this, but I'm not getting up from the table to make myself a sandwich.

It was a good use of leftovers, and I'm glad we tried it, but it is lacking something...

Even better the next day after refrigeration.  Alton Browns Grilled Pork Tenderloin was wonderful but I made too much hence the leftover dilemma so- I started off with a very flavorful cooked pork.  This is a good dish and  easy enough.  I used 2 large onions (followed the recipe exactly)and made sure I sauteed them for a long time so there was a thick layer of caramelized onion juice at the bottom of my pan.
To ensure this comes out good- patience pays off. Scrape up all the goodness at the bottom of the pan when stirring the gravy.   Served over paleo cauliflower risotto.

I used a leftover smoked pork loin. I added bit of 
Italian Herb seasoning, a pinch of cayenne and a few grinds of pepper as we watch our salt intake, otherwise followed the recipe. My husband declared it a keeper!  I even printed this one.

this was OK but one onion is definately enough.  maybe she means green onions?   i did not like the tomato sause, it does turn it a bit pink and it tastes a bit like diluted tomato soup.  i will try again with beef boullion instead.

its a good base recipe to start with!

A good solid recipe that helped me use up some pork tenderloin left from the holidays.  Husband really liked it; I thought it was OK.  I cut the brown sugar in half so the sweetness was just right for our taste.  As per other reviews I used one onion (I was making a half recipe.)  Also used unsalted butter and no salt tomato sauce.  I served it with egg noodles. Easy and comforting.  This will be a repeat with the rest of the pork loin.

Great recipe!  I used 8 oz of a nice pasta sauce instead of plain tomato sauce.  Hubby actually went for seconds and we both rate it a 4-star.  Will be saving this recipe!

I used cubed pork loin, omitted mushrooms (beacause I didn't have them)and used the full amount of onions diced fine. I was nervous it would be too many onions. I browned meat in skillet then tranferred everything to crock pot on high for about 3 to 4 hours. So tender, so perfect, the onions cooked down so as to not be noticeable.  My 10 yr. old said it was the best thing she has ever had.  I served it on noodles. Make it, you will love it. And don't spend extra on tenderloin, just use loin.

I read the other reviews and most of them said it was bland.  I decided to omit the onions as my kids aren't real big fans of them.  I did add a pound of crispy crumbled bacon but it was still a little bland. I too added some garlic powder and seasoning salt. We ate it over rice and we ended up putting a little soy sauce over it and that made it taste a lot better.  It still needs some other spice but I am not sure.  It is a recipe that is worth trying.

Great way to use leftover pork.  Very tasty.  We had it over spaghetti but I bet over rice or mashed potatoes would be even better.

This turned out OK for dinner last night, but I used a fresh pork loin meat so that must've made it less flavorful plus I didn't have any mushrooms on hand so I used broccoli instead. I might give this another try using a left-over roast pork but then again, there are thousands of recipes out there. Hmmmm

I love this recipe. The sauce is a little bland so I added 1/2 tsp of beef granuals and it gave it a better flavor.  Great way to use up excess roast pork.

This recipe is missing something.  The sauce was very bland.  I added some garlic powder and seasoned salt to help liven it up a little.  I don't think I'll make this again.
