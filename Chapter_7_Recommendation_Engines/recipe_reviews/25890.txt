This was absolutely delicious!  I used fresh, chopped spinach & added some garlic.  Didn't have green onions so I used regular chopped onlion.  I also added a little half & half to potatoes while mashing.  I combined everything ahead of time, refridgerated, then put in casserole dish & baked during the last half of my stuffed chicken/spinach recipe.  Great combination & just as good leftover!

These were good.  I read all of the reviews and made mashed potatoes my own way (margarine, 2% milk, lots of garlic, reduced fat sour cream etc etc all to taste) and then just added the green onions and thawed spinach.  The thing about making mashed potatoes as per someone else's recipe is that potatoe sizes vary so much that you really need to do it all to taste and not w/ standard measurements.  That is just my 2 cents though :)

My husband and I are both spinach lovers, so we both loved this recipe!  The leftovers were gone the next day.  I found that when warming up the leftovers, "frying" it in a pan and adding some butter and salt made it absolutely delicious.  I will definately make it again.

My husband has proclaimed this one of his all time favorites. Making this last night, aside from adding a little garlic,I followed the recipe, just added extra of some things. I doubled the spinach, added extra onions, and completely covered the top in a thick layer of chedder cheese.Thanks for the great recipe!

Loving Potatoes and Spinach I thought this would be great.  I was disappointed how bland it was.  I will make it again, but double the spinach and fry it first with the green onions and some minced garlic and onions.  Then add it to the mashed potatoes and reduce the sour cream.

This is a nice, creamy side dish, and a great way to get kids to eat spinach - my crew all had doubles. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream to cut calories. A dash of garlic powder would be a nice addition.

This was divine. I did make just a few little changes. I used green onion instead of chives, used fresh spinach that I steamed in the microwave, and added some non-dairy cream cheese to round out the flavour. My husband loved this, telling me that I was lucky he did not eat it all. He also wants me to try it as a filling for perogies. Will definitely make this again and again. I might also try another type of cheese other than cheddar, siwss might be nice, or havarti

I made this exactly as written and it was not only a colorful and attractive way to serve mashed potatoes but it was also very tasty!  I added some crumbled bacon to the cheese topping and that went over really well!

This recipe is excellent!  I added some extra sour cream and a little milk since it seemed a little on the dry side when I was mixing it all up.  I served this with a meatloaf and everyone absolutely LOVED it!!

For those of you who might not realize…the ingredients of this recipe are what you use to mash the potatoes. I found it worded in a way that almost made it seem like you mash the potatoes using the usual ingredients (milk, butter) and then add all the other ingredients. Nope!   I boil my potatoes in chicken broth which I think improves any mashed potato recipe. I cooked my onions and about 2 gloves of garlic in the ¼ cup of butter that’s called for then mixed it into the sour cream. Then when the potatoes were done, I pulverized them with an electric mixer and added the sour cream mixture which essentially created mashed potatoes. Then I mixed in the spinach, baked and added the shredded cheese as directed. My husband and I like it a lot but my picky 10 year old would not touch it sadly. Makes a lot.

Very good recipe- quick and to the point. I modified in the following ways. While the potatoes were boiling, I sauteed onion and garlic in olive oil for about 5 minutes. I then added diced tomatoes with some jalapenos and cooked those for about 2 minutes. I added the spinach last, stirred and covered the pot for about 10 minutes.   I masked the potatoes then added the cooked spinach combo. I mixed in one cup of plain low fat yogurt. Added a few dashes of cayenne pepper and spicy salsa. Add as much as you like, if you like spicy food as I do. Then poured into into baking dish, baked as directed. I used vegan cheese to replace the Cheddar cheese. Very yummy and healthier.

I served this with the Dijon-Tarragon Chicken recipe from this site for company and everyone absolutely loved it!  I would definitely make this again-it's a quick and easy way to get your starch and green veggie added to your dinner.

Most of my family really liked this.  My youngest daughter loved it.  I did add a couple of things based on other viewers saying it was a little bland.  First I sauteed the green onions with some chopped garlic and then when I mixed everything together I thought it needed a kick.  So I added some good seasons Italian dressing.  It was just a splash, but it gave it some good flavor.  We will make this again.

My son loves mash potato as well as spinach and this recipe is a wonderful combination!  I cooked it the other night and had the leftover on the following day and it was so yummy. Simple and delicious....will definitely cook it again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a wonderful dish. I used a good amount of garlic and more green onions along with fresh spinach from my garden. I sauteed all those ingredients together while cooking the potatoes. I chose to use an Italian blend of cheese. Once I mixed everything together (including the cheese), I had a  hard time putting it in the oven because I kept eating it. I put a good amount of S&P in as well. The only problem I had with this recipe was that it was so darn hard to stop eating it. Thanks for a great versatile recipe.

Yummy! I used this recipe to use up leftover mashed potatoes. I sauteed a couple tablespoons of red onion (thats what I had) with a tbsp of butter and added about 2 cups of fresh baby spinach and cooked until wilted. Mixed about 1/2 cup sour cream into the mashed potatoes, with sea salt and cracked black pepper. I added about a tbsp of chopped fresh rosemary to the potatoes, and a few tbsp of grated fresh parmesan (it was the only cheese I had!). Mixed it all together. I was afraid of it sticking so I brushed the dish with butter. And brushed the top with butter and a few more sprinkles of cheese. Baked for 15 minutes then broiled for 5 to get a nice brown top. Very yummy, going to be my new fave way to use up leftovers!

Excellent recipe! I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and it was great. Super quick and easy side dish, great for people who don't really like spinach b/c it's not too strong.

My family loved this!  I altered a tad because of the fact the sour cream I had had already been turned into French Onion soup mix dip.  It added amazing flavoring and I didn't have to add any onion because of it.  Another keeper!

I came upon this recipe through an ingredient search for spinach and potatoes, and I'm glad I tried it. The only change I made was adding 1 clove of minced garlic.  I tasted it before the mixture went into the oven and baked, and I actually liked it better that way.  I found the cheddar cheese a little overpowering- but I used a good cheddar that I had shredded myself.  When it was just the mashed mixture on the stove it reminded me of Colcannon- which I love. Would definitely make a variation of this again.

I used a 5 lb. bag of red potatoes, so I slightly increased the butter and sour cream. I added 2 tsp. garlic powder. It filled a 10 x 15 baking dish. I cooked it the night before a church dinner. I added 1/2 c. milk before moving it to a large crockpot. I added a couple pats of butter on top, heated it on high for 2 hours, and I poured a bag of shredded cheddar cheese over it before serving. I brought home 3 servings.

This is very good. I love that it's a simple and easy variation of mashed potatoes. You can make it ahead of time too, then pop in oven 30 min before dinner. We loved it!

This is alright- it really just tastes like mashed potatoes with spinach.

This was a great recipe! My EXTREMELY picky husband couldn't stop eating it! But in my own opinion, it needs more flavor. At the very least, more salt and pepper would suffice :)

delicious.  Go w/ fat free Sour creme for health reasons, use a whole bunch of green onions (or more) and add about 3 spoonfuls of minced garlic.

A bit bland, but easy to remedy with garlic and choice spices like dried basil. both potatoes and spinach will go with many common spices. A great dinner side dish for a crowd. I will use this again, but a bit tweaked.

Absolutely outstanding! You can add even more spinach than the recipe calls for if you have an abundance of spinach from your garden - this recipe can handle itif you add quite a bit extra.

I made this last nite, it was very good.  But on reading the recipe beforehand I thought it would really need "a little more flavor" so I added minced garlic, and garlic salt.  Had rotisserie chicken left over, chopped that up and added it.  I used parmesan cheese on the top instead.  Yummy!!  Nice one dish meal.  Thanks!!  ;o)

I used no fat sour cream, light butter, about 1/3rd of the cheese and fresh spinach (all we had).  We loved this!  Very light and fresh, although we needed to add additional cracked pepper and salt.  Next time we'll try a different cheese.  had with grilled mushrooms tonight but would be fantastic with grilled fish.

I loved this dish! However, to save time (and money), I used instant mashed potatoes with sour cream and chives and eliminated the chopped green onions. Cut prep time in half without any loss in flavor!

I love this recipe!!  I first made it a couple weeks ago and loved it so much that I've made it three times since already.  It's great to play around with too.  One time I made it with instant mashed potatoes since I was out of fresh ones and it still came out great and took half the time.  Another time I used red potatoes and left the skins on when I mashed them and added red onions instead of green and it was delicious!!  Great recipe!!

very, very tasty!  i used several cups of fresh chopped spinach instead of frozen, and did add a little extra milk so the potatos didn't dry.  it was simple to make, and the perfect side dish to baked chicken fingers.  thanks for the idea, lisa!

I make a lot of vegetarian meals. We had this as a main dish. Cut butter in half, used fresh spinach, and used fresh grated asiago cheese and half cheddar. Added garlic and used reg onions since I had no GOs. Will def make again.

Was looking for a new spinach recipe saw this and decided I didn't want to go thru the trouble of mashing potatoes.  Then I remembered I had just enough leftover Slow Cooker Mashed Potaotos and Cauliflower (by kdelegan)in the frig.  Left out butter in this recipe and subed Pots and Cauliflower for the mashed.  Cut prep time to less then 5 minutes and added cauliflower,  Reposted as Potato Spinach Casserole with Cauliflower. Didn't give credit to LISA B7 and kdelegan so I re posted with credit, I hope it shows up if accepted if not I am sooo sorry.

Being a spinach lover I loved this recipe!! I cut the recipe in half but kept the spinach the same at first I thought it would be too much but it turned out delicious! I used a fat-free sour cream and skim milk. I used baby swiss cheese because that's all I had. YUM!!

Super easy to do, and this was inhaled at the dinner table. I made the mashed potatoes my own way, low fat, using chicken broth and a cup of low fat sour cream, then followed this recipe. It's a nice way to make mashed potatoes a little more interesting, and healthier.

I was initially looking for a recipe with hash browns because it was for a brunch, so I used shredded potatoes instead of mashed. I also added a little minced onion, light mayo, and used fresh spinach. I used more cheese and mixed it in with the potato, then topped with a little more at the end and cooked at 350 for 40 minutes, broiled on low for about 5 minutes to add a little crisp. Everyone loved it - the flavors were great! I think I will top it with real bacon bits during the broiling next time. I will definitely try it with mashed potatoes as well. Great recipe!

Yummy, even my kids who normally shun spinach ate this.  I added some garlic and used one cup Monterrey Jack Cheese rather than Cheddar.  Also added more cheese to the top.

This was a wonderful casserole. I made it just like the directions called for, except I may have added a little more spinach. (Our garden is loaded with fresh spinach) My college age son who is not a big spinach fan, loved this. No left overs! Will keep this receipe handy! Thanks

For a healthier version I used tofutti (NOT) sour cream and veggie shreds for the cheese...I also used cayenne instead of black pepper and "real" salt and garlic...my 12 year old son ate half the dish in one sitting!I will be making this one again!

I enjoyed this but we all agreed there was 'something' missing (we didn't want to add MORE salt and that wouldn't have been the missing ingredient I am sure).  But otherwise a decent enough side for our family to enjoy spinach...just not something I'd serve to others as it wasn't impressive enough.  Thanks anyway :)

This was good, but not spectacular. It was a little bland even after adding extra sour cream. I think I will try again, but next time I will make sure to make the mash potatoes my way before adding spinach.

Very tasty and attractive dish!  I used fresh chives in place of green onions, but the flavor was too mild.  Actually, I think garlic would be a far better flavoring for this dish.

Great! I scaled the recipe to make 4 servings. In place of the fresh potatoes, I made 6 servings of instant mashed potatoes. Everything else I followed the recipe. This makes a very pretty dish.

Wow!  Fantastic recipe and very easy to make ahead.  But you're stronger than I am if you can leave this in your fridge without sampling.  I used fat free sour cream and substituted 1/4 cup fresh chives for the onions. Thanks for a great recipe Lisa!

So delicious and simple. One suggestion a friend would have, as I sort of missed the "mash" step, is to put a mash bottom, and layer the rest of "chunks" of potato on top before cheesing. It's a great idea that I'll try!

We liked this casserole, but it's probably not something I'd make again.  I tried to add punch ahead of time by sauteeing the green onions and some garlic in butter. I also added sea salt and was generous on the cheddar cheese topping. The spinach flavor was delicious, but the heaviness of the potatoes drowned out any variation in taste or texture.

Just mashed potatoes with a package of spinach thrown in.  Very good, healthy addition to an otherwise unhealthy side.

This is my new favourite potato side dish!  It's so simple, so tasty and I finally conquered my children's rejection of spinach, they can't get enough of it.  I tried it with a wonderfully thickand tender slice of my rotisseried sweet rub pork loin and red onion gravy.  Total comfort for the winter.

Yum!  I made quite a few changes to this, and it turned out great!  Although I think it would've been good as is, I'm always trying to make things a bit healthier, so I did about half potatoes and half pureed steamed cauliflower.  I used part sour cream and part fat free yogurt, cut the butter and salt in half, and totally forgot to add the green onions.  I also added most of the cheese in with the casserole rather than just on top, but did sprinkle a bit on the top in the last 5 minutes.  Hubby and my one year old gobbled this down!  I can truly say that all the changes didn't put a dent in this fantastic tasting dish!  I will definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe to add to.  It was lacking in flavor in my opinion.  Next time, will roast garlic then mix that in while making the mashed potatos portion.  A lovely recipe that can be dressed up or left alone.

This was delicious! I used fresh spinach and just blanched it before adding to the potatoes. I also skipped the green onions b/c my husband hates them, and used half the amount of sour cream and double the butter just to cut the sat fat a little bit. It was a big hit, but I don't really consider it a casserole. More like just mashed potatoes with spinach in them....haha

This was absolutely scrumptious!!!  I could have made a meal out this dish alone.  The only slight change I made was to use 1/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup low fat yogurt instead of all sour cream to save on the fat content.  It looked and tasted great. Thanks so much Lisa

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it went over very well.  Not a bad way to get spinach in those non-spinach eaters.  This recipe is a keeper!

I thought this was really good! My husband said it was okay, but he's a picky guy. I will be making this again for myself! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a delicious way to eat spinach--which my family has a hard time liking.  We all loved this dish.  For a vegetarian main course, I add 1 cup cooked kasha to the potato-spinach mix and it's tasty, easy, and healthy.

Great side dish.  I didn't have green onions so I used about a tablespoon of fresh chives and  a tablespoon of fresh parsley.  I added a little onion powder to the mixture and a little fat free half and half to the potatoes during mashing.  I agree with the other person who mentioned how pretty this dish is.  A nice alternative to regular old casseroles.  Loved it!

My brother is a "particular" eater, and he LOVES this dish, whenever I'm around he requests it. I love it because it is tasty, filling, nutritious, inexpensive and quick to make. I have changed it a little though, I add a thawed pie shell on top and sprinkle it with some paprika and a little more cheese, doing this I find gives the dish more flavour and is more satisfying.

I made this for dinner tonight and we found it very tasty. Since there are just the 2 of us now, I had to cut it down quite a bit.  I used fresh spinach, which I chopped and blanched for 2 minutes in the microwave  and I used fat free sour cream. The only thing I did wrong, I think, is that I used a bit too much sour cream and it was a bit more 'soupy' than I would have liked.(I didn't measure, my fault).I will make this again and use less.  No matter--it was very good and a new way to serve spinach.
PS. I asked my husband to rate it and he said that if I cut back on the sour cream it will be a five.

Tasty!  I used onion powder instead of green onions and I used garlic powder.  I had to add milk to make the mashed potatoes more loose.  It was a hit.  I cooked Panko breaded chicken to along with it.

This recipe turned out so good! I had to boil the potatoes for a little longer than 15 minutes and left the skin on since I like the skin. I also don't have a proper masher so it was a little chunky but still sooo good! next time I make it I am gonna add some extra spices!

It was delicious.  I substituted the sour cream for coconut cream to make it dairy free.  I also used earth island dairy free cheese to top it.  Adding garlic was a great addition too!! Great recipe even dairy free. :)

Even my kids will eat this!  I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used plain Greek yogurt.  I also added garlic powder, onion powder, and Parmesan cheese.  Finally, I added some milk while mashing the potatoes.  Nice recipe!

I decided to up the nutritional value by adding one sweet potato to the potato pot.  I also upped the fresh spinach portion; cooked spinach with the onion, shallot with salt, pepper, garlic granules, red pepper flakes together in some olive oil before adding to the potatoes.  When I mixed them altogether, I also mixed in some grated parmesan cheese before putting in the casserole dish.  Used sharp cheddar cheese on the top, and it was very tasty!

Instead of putting cheese on top I mixed it in the 2nd time I made this and it made it even better. I have made it without the green onions too but it is much better with them.

This was excellent. I used fresh spinach, left the skins on the potatoes, and added about 10 cloves of roasted, mashed garlic. A great , easy side dish.

I had 5 very big baking potatoes  that I used to prepare this, and the dish was full to the top;  7 of these would have been too  much.  I could tell almost immediately this had the potential for being low on flavor, so I added a big pinch a nutmeg - an ingredient that is unexpectedly successful with mashed potatoes.  Either I didn't add enough, or I needed to add something else, since I found this dish lacking in personality.

This was delicious. I used fresh spinach, chopped. I thought the fresh green onion was just a tad jarring, as the baking time doesn't take out the "bite," but it had mellowed out when this dish was reheated the next day. I may just carmelize some regular onion when I make this next time.  I may also omit or reduce the cheese by half, as the dish already has plenty of richness and calories!

Easy. Delicious. I didn't peel red potatoes. 
It took 1 hour 45 minutes to cook.  
Added 2 eggs the  1st batch and 5 eggs the second batch I made at husbands request.
Great for meals the next day.  
Added parsley flakes and paprika.

Okay so I did a couple things to this recipe - it was a good base for the additional stuff and alternate things I did:
So I had 7 potatoes, 6oz of fresh spinach leaves, 2 tbs of chives, 2 tbs of dill, 1 yellow onion (so there'd be some crunching texture in it), garlic cloves, and mozzarella instead of the other kind of cheese . The other stuff stayed the same. 

So when I added the ingredients I just mixed everything together as usual and the onion pieces were chopped to little cube bites (kind of like what you'd expect in a meatloaf I guess?).

It was amazing. Thank you for being an inspiration to build upon!

What a hit with my family. And so easy.  I did decrease the butter by a TBS and added a tad more green onion, but they loved it.  It was a large casserole but disappeared quickly. Thanks for sharing.

I diced up some pre-ccoked red potatoes, did not peel or mash! Added 1/4 cup milk and 1 TBS mayo since I was a little short on the sour cream. Turned out fantastic! My picky eaters had seconds! You know there's spinach in there, right?  LOL   Will make again.

Our family loved this recipe a lot! Even got my kids to eat spinach! We added a little more sour cream and some garlic salt as I was afraid it would be dry and bland. Perfect recipe for kids or as a break from your plain mashed potatoes.

This was delicious! My only complaint is it leaned on the saltier side. Next time I make it Ill use 1 tsp of salt. I followed instructions exactly but used smaller size potatoes and the casserole was bubbling over. Ill also add more spinach to it and maybe some bacon crumbles.

I made this for my family and they loved it; I was so pleasantly surprised! To balance healthy with affordable, I usually keep frozen/canned greens on hand along with lots of potatoes so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. The only thing I changed was that I used yogurt instead of sour cream to make it healthier. It was such a hit I made it twice in a row. I read the directions wrong and mixed all the cheese together with the other ingredients, but this kept it from getting crunchy on top. The second time I made it I added a little extra water to make it a little more moist and used canned mustard greens instead of spinach, but either version was a hit. Definitely a keeper and good for getting people to eat greens.

very good! I would omit the salt though. The cheese makes it plenty salty and the added salt is overkill! You can easily double the spinach or add some broccoli or cauliflower. I added some chicken chunks and it was delicious!
