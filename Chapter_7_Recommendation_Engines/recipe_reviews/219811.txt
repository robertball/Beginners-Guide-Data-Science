This is a moist cake but not real dense. The spice is a nice blend but not strong enough that would have you thinking it's definitely Gingerbread. The pineapple is a nice addition to spice cake and I adore brown sugar and butter. Calculated this recipe to four servings and made four separate cakes in buttered ramekins. Baked in a water bath for even cooking. Let cool. They turned out of the ramekins nicely after running a paring knife around the edges. As a change up from traditional Pineapple Upside Down Cake this is a nice treat.

This was a nice change from your typical pineapple upside-down cake.  It is really moist and I like the spices.  Thanks for sharing!

Not very impressed, much too "spicy" for me. Very strong and the bottom burned before the middle of the cake was even near finished.

Awesome recipe! My family always adds extra spice to every dessert and this definitely doesnâ€™t need it. It makes the classic pineapple upside down cake something a bit more memorable. I ended up using almost another can of pineapple rings to cover the bottom of the pan. New family fav!

Epic fail.  For a party, of course.  I used/did everything it called for in the recipe.  Including the 5 cups of flour, which I thought was way too much.  Within 15 minutes of going into the oven, the batter began to overflow the pan.  It did that for the next half hour, with about half of it landing on the aluminum foil below.  When it finally stopped, I let it cook the rest of the way.  It wouldn't unmold from the pan, but it tasted great.  Go figure.  Oh, and I agree with one of the other reviewers that the edges tended to burn before the rest of the cake was done.
