I'm somewhat mixed on this recipe...

If you follow the instruction exactly, you will have a very undercooked pie.  I cooked it at 450 for 10 minutes and then turned it down to 325...Well, it took way more than 30 minutes to cook.  It took about 1 hour & 15 minutes before it was done.  It's not a very firm pie...It's very soft but it cuts up nicely.  I tasted it and it's VERY GOOD.  If you don't mind waiting for what seems forever...You'll love the outcome.  Just be sure to expect a long wait!  My grandma said it was the best pumpkin pie that she has ever tasted...And that's saying a lot, she is painfully truthful on everything!

A good basic pumpkin pie. After the initial 10min. at 450, my pie needed to be baked for 60min. at 325 in order to be done. As other reviewers suggested, I just kept checking with the knife until it finally came out clean.

I agree with one of the reviewers that says the pie tastes much better the next day, after chilling in the refrigerator for a night.  Next time, I will also use more spices than are called for in the original recipe, though that is just personal taste.

Excellent, deliciously perfect flavor! Only the cooking time is more like 1 1/2 hours total after reducing the oven temp to 325. Important: do NOT eat this pie warm...it tastes kind of "vegetable-y" straight out of the oven. My (honest) guests all thought the same thing. However, it was AWESOME the day after. Chill it overnight, enjoy it cold with some fresh whipped cream, and you are going to be in pumpkin heaven!

This was delicious, I made it twice.  The first time, was the exact recipe, no straying, and it was good.  The second time I added vanilla, cloves, and allspice.  Also, I think there was a mistake in the directions and going off of what everyone else said, I put it in for 450 for 10 minutes, then at 375 (not 325) for 30 minutes.  It turned out perfectly.

Hello!
Admitedly, I hate pumpkin pie. I eat one piece a year because I feel like I have too - I can't even say I eat a piece, I eat a bite.  So, I made this the night before as all suggested.  Let it sit in the fridge and this was GOOD.  I actually ate 1/2 a piece!  Could I have gone without, yes, BUT, for those of us that really hate pumpkin, this is at least palatable.  My husband on the other hand LOVED, LOVED it.  So, it's a keeper (but if you truly don't like pumpkin, don't expect a miracle.  You will STILL not like pumpkin.)  It makes a lot, but I did use a regular pie dish, I filled it waaaaayyyy up and still just had a bit left, but it made a nice full pie.  I don't know how the other reviewers were able to make two, those would have been pretty skimply.  Also, get the vanilla cool whip too on it!  Good stuff!

This was the best tasting pumpkin pie I have ever had. I will search for a recipe no longer. It had a nice sweet flavor, very old fashioned tasting!!! :) However, it did require longer cooking time, 60 minutes at 325. I took your advice to triple it, and ended up with TONS of filling. I was able to make 4 pies and 6 tarts. Maybe using cake pans instead of pie plates would hold more liquid, anyhow it was great. Left overnight the flavors blended and it just tasted amazing!!!!!LOVE the taste and texture, absolutely perfect, thankyou so much for this recipe.

One of the very best pumpkin pies that I have ever ate. My boyfriend absolutely loved this pie, and proved it by nearly eating the whole thing by himself. Be sure to use a deep dish pie shell because it is alot of filling mixture, which I still left some out. Will definitely make again.

Made this exactly as directed.  I don't like pumpkin pie, so I did not try any, but everyone who had a piece liked it alot.  Had to bake for about twice as long as directed to have knife come out clean.

Amazing pumpkin pie!  I love pumpkin pie and this is the best one I've tried/made.  And both my non-pumpkin pie eating grandmother AND fiance tried this one and enjoyed it.  I had to double the cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg as it wasn't spicy enough when I tried the uncooked filling.  I increased the second bake time to about 75 min as others suggested and it turned out perfect.. I chilled in the fridge overnight too.  I will be using this recipe over and over.  I served it with whipped cream with just a touch of cinnamon.

I'm not a huge pumpkin pie fan, but this satisfied me. Plus it was really easy to make. Of course it took a lot longer to cook than the recipe said, so just keep checking it until it's done. Enjoy!

I hate pumpkin pie - I had 2 slices.  For pumpkin pie, this is really good (as the rest of the family loved it).  I, too had to increase the baking time. I lost track of the actual length but I was able to just keep checking every 5 to 10 minutes.  Turned out pretty good

I adjusted this recipe to make a very dense pie because I really like pumpkin. I used 1 10" pie crust. 29 oz can of pumpkin puree', 2 eggs, 1-1/2 c white sugar ( or adjust to taste), 1-1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger. ( you can adjust spices to taste) 1/4 can evaporated milk. Bake 425 for 15 minutes / turn down to 375 and bake until bottom crust is light golden brown & center is firm. Excellent!!!

Tasty pie and I am not a big fan of pumpkin pie.This pie has to sit overnight I think in order for the flavours to meld. I think I have found the recipe which my husband approves greatly.Thanks!

I cooked this pie for Thanksgiving because I had some left over mini pumpkins from Halloween.  It was the best pumpkin pie that I have ever made.  I knew from experience that it would need to cook at 325 for 60 minutes or so and that you needed to refrigerate overnight before serving.  I even made one with splenda for my father in law who is a diabetic.  He loved it too and he hates pumpkin pies made with real pumpkin.  I will absolutely use this again and again.  Thanks!

The buck stops here folks. I don't think I will even bother to try other pumpkin pie recipes! So mouth watering and my house smelled like fall. It does taste better the day after, but even chilling it for a couple hours before serving was still tasty. I had real pumpkin, so I chopped and cooked it at 350 for 45 minutes, took the skin off, then put it in the blender and measured it out. It did make the task more tedious so I don't recommend it. Also, lol, I didn't know pumpkin shrinks while being cooked SO I only came up with half the amount needed. I just wanted to practice this for Thanksgiving and make sure this recipe was a winner. I made a "skimpy pie" and it cooked at the time it said so for everyone using the full amount of ingredients, you do need to double the time. I also tried this with a graham cracker crust and was rather yummy. Update 11/24/09: It tastes SO much better with real pumpkin, but honestly its expensive and a lot of work.  Also the graham cracker crust tastes good with it but it loses its crunch, I assume, because the contents are rather wet and it spends a lot of time in the oven.  Regular pie shell might be the way to go.

This pie was awesome! I do like Pumpkin pie but don't LOVE it, however it is my husbands favorite so I made it for him. He couldn't believe how good it was and I loved it as well. I used the Grandma Ruths Pie crust for this pie and made the crust extra thick (about 1 and 1/2 recipes). This is a keeper.

I made this for a Thanksgiving in July celebration since my daughter is moving out of the country for 2 years. She loves pumpkin pie. Both she and I agree that this is by far the most delicious pumpking pie recipe on the face of the earth. It was so light and fluffy and had the perfect blend of flavors. It will definitely become a tradition in our house from now on whether we do Thanksgiving in July or November (or both!). I didnt' change anything, although I did need to cook it for an hour after lowering the temperature, even though I did only lower the temp to 350 degrees. Regardless, it was definitely worth the wait and was even more delicious the next day. Thanks so much for sharing this fabulous recipe!

Delicious Pumpkin Pie recipe!  I did have to cook it a longer time, we are at high altitude (6000 ft) so everything bakes a bit differently.  But overall it was just wonderful!

This was my first attempt at a pumpkin pie.  It turned well and wasn't too hard to make.  I was determined to making all my pies by scratch, however, my (not very picky) crowed generally agreed that this pie didn't stand out significantly from the simple canned mix version.  So, if you are short on time it might be easier to just use the can!

Thank you so much for sharing your family recipe for the most delicious pumpkin pie I have ever had!  My son and I had lots of fun baking, made 4 this afternoon and decided while our spagetti was cooking on top of the stove we'd bake another 4!   He plans on sharing with his grandparents and his cousins(all girls)  he'll have to teach them how to bake it I'm sure!

I added about 1/2Tbs of flour to the recipe to hold it together (based on previous comments about it being thin) and it baked for much longer than the original recipe said, but absolutely delicious.  I also added a dash of ground cloves.  I will definately be making this again, soon!

Probably only 4 stars because I messed it up a little.  I forgot the corn syrup and didnt mix the ingredients in the right order, but it worked out well and tasted good!

Excellent pumpkin pie, one of the best I've ever had. I added a touch of cloves and it was very good with the right amount of spice and flavor. Did bake it for more like 50-55 minutes but other than that, fantastic.

Big hit.  My guests all had seconds and said with real pumpkin they could never go back to canned.  I used extra spices, as suggested, but I think I overdid the ginger or something for my own tastes.  No one else noticed.

I've made this recipe three times. The first time was with ready-made pie shells and I had to use two because one wasn't deep enough! The last two times I've used ready-made pie crust dough with the correct size glass pan and my kids LOVE it!

Delicious pie. Made it with 9-year old grandaughter. We all loved it. Used purchased frozen crust. Double this recipe for four pies.  You will want that many. Too good to eat one piece.  I did have to cook longer that recipe to get them done.  I was going to give a couple of pies to some good neighbors, but after my family tasted them there was no pie left.  I will definitely make this again

I did make this again but this time I was out of light corn syrup and I substituted dark corn syrup and the pie was still absolutely delicious. It has become a holiday must-have in my family.  I can't make it too often because I will eat it when it is available and its not too good for the waist line.

I baked this pie for nearly twice as long as it calls for, and the pumpkin still wasn't set! It was pretty good, but just doesn't taste "done".

This is a VERY good pumpkin pie recipe!  Not only was it simple, but it produced an extremely tasty & smooth filling.  Didn't change one thing about the recipe; if I were to note anything it would be that my pie took closer to 45 minutes to bake through.

Super easy to make and tastes wonderful.  

There is plenty for one pie.  The pie is a little more cake-like than normal pumpkin pie - but that made it all the better.

Fabulous!  Just the right texture, creamy and delicious.  It's not very spicy so if you like it with more cinnamon, etc. definitely kick it up a little.  Took mine 10+60 minutes as another reviewer mentioned, probably could have been a little longer too.  Just be patient.  Wonderful recipe!

This is always a hit.  I was out of corn syrup so used maple syrup instead.  Didn't notice a difference.  Like others, I did cook the pie A LOT longer than the recipe says, probably an extra 25-30 minutes more.

While I use my own crust recipe, this pumpkin pie is my new go-to for the holidays.  It turns out perfect every time and is very adaptable.  I always add about half again as much of each of the spices called for because we like a spicy pumpkin pie.  All of my friends and family raved.  This is the one!

This was my first attempt at pumpkin pie, and I was so happy with how it came out.  It was delicious! As has been noted by other reviewers, the baking time is a bit off--after turning the heat down, I baked it for just over an hour--but otherwise it was perfect.  I should mention that I didn't have corn syrup and just used honey instead, and it tasted exactly the way a pumpkin pie should taste! No need to search for a different recipe.

I omitted the corn syrup and had to leave it in a lot longer though like others have said.  I didn't have any ginger so I used 1/4 ground cloves instead.  Every year my family looks forward to this and every year we point at laugh at store bought pies.

This pie tasted fine, but even though I baked it longer than suggested it just didn't set up.  When I served it the next day it was runny in the middle.

This was the first pumpkin pie that I ever made. It turned out perfect. From reviews, I changed the second cook time from 30 to 60 minutes. I also made my crust and pre-baked it, to avoid it getting soggy.

I will definitely make this recipe again...it will be my only pumpkin pie recipe from now on.  I love to bake pies, and, pumpkin was the only one I felt was just "so-so"  (until now!). 
 I have tried dozens of other recipes, including Carnation's recipe.  
I did take the advice of others, and waited to serve it the next day after chilling, and felt it was even better the third day (if it lasts!). Only my husband and I doing the eating... Nice texture, flavor, and it cut beautifully.  I did bake it for 10 minutes at 450, and then in a 350 oven for about 45 minutes until a knife came out clean.  The crust was not soggy at all, which I think may have been due to the initial baking at 450 degrees. It was not an overly full pie, but deep enough.   Thank you for this recipe.  We loved it!

I have this in my oven right now and though it smells great the cooking time is very much off. 
I have never had a problem with my ovens heat being to hot or chilled so I know it's not that but I left the pie in a little over the time posted above and the middle is still like jello. Yikes... :/ 
I tried the batter and it tasted wonderful and I'm sure it'll be perfect once it's finally ready. Just be prepared for additional baking time.

Made this this morning; substituted pure maple syrup for the corn syrup, added a dash of cloves, and lined the bottom of the pie crust with pecans mixed with brown sugar, cinnamon, and a little corn syrup.  Baked it longer as advised by other reviews.  EXCELLENT!!!

Doubled the recipe and gave 2 to my neighbors and kept 1 for our house. My husband and son love this! They look perfect and taste perfect! I also baked them longer then the recipe calls for. 450 for 10mins and then 325 for 50mins.

Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews (because of its solid 5 star rating) and couldn't figure out why MY pie was such a disaster. Still not cooked in the middle, burnt crust. I'm angry.

I liked this recipe, with some changes: I didn't have any light corn syrup, so I used agave. Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar. I did double the recipe and it made one 9" pie and 3 small (pyrex) bowls of custard (pie without the shell). I didn't use the baking times set in this recipe, but based off years of making pumpkin I know it takes more time then listed. I did 15 mins at 450 degrees and 60 mins at 325, the custards were done, but the pie took about 10 mins more. And I used my garden pumpkin (which of course needs to be processed first).

Top notch recipe! Excellent flavor and texture. I used Pillsbury Ready Made pie crust and subbed ready-made pumpkin pie spice from the spice aisle....just added it until I liked the flavor. Baked it in a 9" pyrex pie plate a day ahead and refrigerated it overnight. My husband and son-in-law both LOVED it (me too!). 

If you're a seasoned baker, the bake time is not a big deal...like all things, you just adjust the time until it's done in YOUR oven. A keeper for sure!

I loved this recipe! I changed the milk for coconut milk because I'm lactose intolerant (I didn't even taste coconut), and I put it at 375, but I fell asleep so it was at 375 for 2 1/2 hours, but it still turned out moist and really good... just the edge of the crust was a bit burnt. I gave this recipe to my friends and I will definitely use it again!

Never made Pumpkin pie ever, but received rave reviews on this one.  Made the following changes and pie cooked.
Use 15 ounces of pumpkin puree, substitue honey for corn syrup and sea salt (less potassium and better flavor) instead of table salt.
Use tooth pick to check pie so knife wounds are not shown in it.
Cook at 450 for 15 minutes.  Reduce heat to 325 for 60-90 minutes.  It took me almost 90 minutes at 325 to cook completely, so increase the 450 cooking time to 15 minutes which will help it cook properly.
Utilize home made pie crust to have best taste possible and serve with homemade whipped cream.

Excellent! Tastes just as good as a bakery pie but making it yourself adds something special. Be aware that the filling will be VERY runny, like soup. I used honey instead of corn syrup and minced some ginger very fine because I didn't have powder. To save time, I used store bought crust. Very simple and easy recipe - I mixed everything by hand. As per another user's advice, I baked it at 450 for 10 min and then 30 min at 375, not 325. Whipped up some whipped cream (heh) to go with it and it was delicious. There was just two of us this Thanksgiving, but we gobbled up the pie in no time. I will make this again next year!

This pie was delicious.  I did have to cook it longer than the recipe called for but that was no problem. This will be my pumpkin pie recipe from now on.

5 stars for flavor, really.  Just remember to grind your own nutmeg.  Cooking time was way off as others have mentioned.  Delicious.

The taste was fabulous!  I added 1/4 tsp. cloves and baked it an hour after reducing the oven temp.  Will be making the second one today for another Thanksgiving get together!

I used fresh ginger...about 1 Tblsp. And baked for about 10 min at 450F then 1 h 15 min at 325F. This was first from scratch pie and it was perfect and quite honestly, the best pumpkin pie we've ever had! I used fresh baked pumpkin the first time (perfect!) and am hoping it will be just as good with canned.
