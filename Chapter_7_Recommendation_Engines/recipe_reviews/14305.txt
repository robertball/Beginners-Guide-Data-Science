I've been making this for years and everyone always loves it but I do add red onion and sunflower(shelled)seeds. I also like to make it with nonfat mayo and fresh bacon bits and 1/4 cup sugar.  Try it!!

My mother has been making this recipe forever and it's so simple and tasty.  We have very few pot lucks where this salad isn't served.  Our version is almost exactly the same except that we add a package of crumbled ramen noodles (without any of the seasonings).  They add a yummy crunch and an additional texture.  But otherwise this is a great recipe that tends to go over well with people with different likes and dislikes

I have been making this salad for years.  Out of all of the other submissions, this salad is closest to the original (except for 1/2 cup of diced red onion).  The dressing ingredients and measurements are from the original recipe.  I have added cauliflower mixed with the broccoli, dried cranberries or cherries instead of the raisins, sunflower seeds and walnuts or pecans.  Wherever I take this salad, people ask for the recipe.

Very good.... I added grapes and thinly sliced red onion. Also, because a few in my family are on a low-carb diet I substituted Splenda for the sugar and no one could tell the difference.  This is a total keeper and I plan on making it for the 4th of July.  Definately make this at least a day before!!!!!!

This is an awesome recipe. I prefer using sliced grapes rather than raisins.  Also I use 1/2 cup Splenda in place of the sugar.

DELICIOUS!  I love the sweet of the raisins and dressing with the sour of the bacon.  This is a hit for pot-lucks.  A great, cool way to have veggies in the heat of the summer.

1/2 Cup of sugar was way too much.  I put in 2 tbls and it was just enough sweet to cut the vinegar.  I also may have used less broccoli then recommended.  Instead of raisins I used chopped almonds.  Very good, even my husband enjoyed it.

This is really a fabulous salad.  The key is to chop the broccoli very fine (removing the core of each floret so you have tiny florets). I thought my first try was a bit sweet.  Second time I used 2 tbsp. of sugar and three pkgs. of Sweet and Low.  Also added chopped red onion, sunflower seeds and ramen noodles.  Rave reviews from my guests!

This is an awesome salad! I lightened it up the second time- used Light Miracle Whip, lowfat sharp cheddar (I added extra!) and 1/2 cup sunflower kernals. Also, used sweet onion (Will be awesome when Vidalia season comes!) Also cut the sugar as suggested. It's a very forgiving recipe- you can use more or less of any ingredient, & it will still taste great. Chill overnight if you have time- it makes a difference!

My all-time favorite broccoli salad!  I chop 1/4 of a small red onion and add that, too.  Light Miracle Whip works well  instead of regular mayo and I use either apple cider or white vinegar ~ whatever I have on hand :-).

Quick and simple to make and very tasty.  Not to be one of those recipe-changers who comments on their version... but I used Craisins in place of raisins and I liked the way the salad looked.  Also I only used 1/2 of the dressing- it seemed like an awful lot- and it was just fine with the 1/2 amount.

I LOVE THIS ONE I ADD RED ONIONS CHOPPED VERY SMALL MUST MAKE SURE THE ONION IS FRESH OR IT WILL SPOIL THE WHOLE DISH.  I ALSO ADD SHREDDED BROCCOLI YOU CAN FIND IN THE PRODUCE SECTION BY THE PACKAGED SALAD MAKES IT EASIER TO EAT. THE ONIONS DO ADD A NICE KICK.

I added some thinly sliced red onion and cashews. Dried cherries instead of raisins (although raisins would be really good too). I didn't think I had enough broccoli for the number I wanted to serve, so I added part of a package of coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage and carrots) and it was something new and very good - there were many compliments and no leftovers.

My five year old declaring "this is the best recipe ever" says enough! I was thrilled he enjoyed it so much. I did add match stick carrots for added color and taste.

I used this recipe, but changed it up a little. I didn't add the bacon and instead included shredded cheddar cheese. I made the dressing according to the recipe and it turned out wonderful. Thanks for posting this great recipe - it's a new favorite of mine!

We have always enjoyed broccoli salads and this is a wonderful base to work from.  We always add about 1/2 a large onion (usually red or purple but any work) to the last 5 min of cooking time for the bacon.  Adds just that extra balance with flavors.  Thank you for the recipe. :o)

Good but sweet. I had to add seriously sharp white cheddar & roasted sunflowers seeds to cut down on the sweetness.

Wonderful...I used a little less of the dressing and dried cranberries (instead of raisins) and the flavors just popped!!!  Excellent!!!

Delicious and easy to make.  I added shredded carrots and substituted the sugar for Splenda.

This was really good. I had to add some cauliflower because I didn't buy enough broccoli, but I really like it that way. I also used cruising

Not bad at all. I used half of the sugar and it was still sweet enough for me. May try with a Vegenaise next time. Thanks for sharing!!!

I was out of bacon.  After reading reviews, added only 2 tablespoons of Xylitol; feta cheese; cranberries (instead of raisins) and sunflower seeds.  My husband and I really enjoyed it! Trying to eat on the lighter side, I might try a bit less Xylitol and a bit less of mayo next time. BTW... I made half of a recipe.  Thanks I love the fact of eating something that is tasty with raw broccoli.  steamed broccoli will come second to this recipe!

Pretty good, and my 4yr old loves it.  I made a few changes... we are vegetarian so I did not add the bacon, but did add in onions and walnuts.  I did 1 cup of vegenaise (vegan mayo) with 2tbsp aged white wine vinegar and replaced the white refined sugar with 1/4 cup raw agave nectar.  The Agave did give it a different taste but I still think its pretty good and if my 4yr old loves it then thats all i can ask for :-)

I cannot get enough of this salad. I could eat the whole bowl myself. I like to use red wine vinegar & chill the salad and dressing separately in the fridge, then combine right before serving - keeps it crunchy.
