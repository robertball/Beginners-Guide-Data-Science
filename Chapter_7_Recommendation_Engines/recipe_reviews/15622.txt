We tried this recipe for Sunday Brunch and scaled it down to just 3, but it fed us(my wife , son and I) and also my wifes grandmother, and we all loved it! I also added some onion to the bacon grease before I put in the potatoes and it tasted great. My wifes grandmother put some salsa on her's and liked that with it too. Excellent!

why is this hiding in the christmas section? It is very good! Per others, I added some diced onions to the potato saute apprx halfway through cooking and during the last 5-7 min, added some fresh, chopped broccoli.  I also added a little milk to the egg mix and sprinkled some cheddar cheese to melt when all was done. Very tasty! Thanks Vel for the tasty breakfast to start our day!!

Not the absolute best thing we've ever had, but it was fun since it combined out usual once a week breakfast items (scrambled eggs w/cheese, bacon & hashbrowns) into one dish. I also added a little onion and wish I had actually added more. I'd make it again, but add onion and maybe a few other items to give it more flavor.

I used different amounts of all the ingredients (didn't measure anything) and frozen shredded potatoes.  If you don't want to dirty another dish, you can just crack the eggs right over the potatoes, add seasoned salt, and mix it in.  I thought this was really yummy and we put it in tortillas.  Taco sauce, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream, green onions and other burrito toppings would be good to add too.

I made this for a Rev War encampment and it easily fed 6 of us.  I used half the bacon fat and half the cheese as I could imagine the sound of major arteries slamming shut as it cooked.  It got rave reviews, i.e. "this is my kind of breakfast!".  I also sauteed an onion while the bacon was cooking and I should have used two as the onion added a great flavor to the dish.

If you cook with a lid this will steam your potaotes and make them soft. Without a lid they can be cooked to desired crispness.  I added onions and green pepper and this was loved by 4 family members.  The idea of salsa sounds really good.

We did the recipe as is (for the kids) for a Sunday brunch, but had add-ons for the adults. Sauteed mushrooms, jalapenos, chopped scallions, and pico de gallo. We all liked it!

I fixed this for a campout of 10 people.  I did drain off about 1/2 of the bacon grease because a pound of bacon leaves a lot of grease and I did not want everything greasy.  Added 1/2 chopped yellow onion, 1 cup sliced mushroom.  Garnished with Monterey Jack cheese and salsa.  Serve with toast points or biscuits to clean up plates.  Everyone loved it.

I used some leftover boiled potatoes and smoked sausage, about 1/3 lb and 6 eggs, and was enough to feed 4 hungry people.  My husband added salsa to his and said very good.

I used to eat this dish as a kid with my family on camping trips. My dad would cook it on the camp stove. It isn't the healthiest thing in the world to eat, but it tastes heavenly!

This tasted excellent, although I would decrease the bacon to 1/2 lb. potatoes to about 5 potatoes, not 3 lbs., cheese to about 1 cup and eggs to about 8-10.

Could have been done better. Potatoes added a soggy texture. I did try to broil them to give them a little more crunchiness but still a sloppy gloppy mess. Will try my own creation next time.

Delicious!  A great meal to serve when you don't want to spend the morning in the kitchen.  Follow the recipe to the tee, use frozen potatoes to save time, and it's great.

Very good dinner. Everyone loved it. My kids wanted some for lunch tomorrow but there was none left. I cut the recipe back some. Next time I will use packaged hashbrowns to save time.

This was a quick and easy brunch idea. I added minced green onions, a little garlic powder and used ham rather than bacon. Delicious!

We drained the bacon fat off when the bacon was done cooking, thus reducing some of the calories.  We then put the finished potatoes and eggs into a flour tortilla added tomatoes and hot sauce for a breakfast burrito.

I have been making this for years. I cook and set aside the bacon and clean out the bacon fat. I then saute onions with the potatoes which I cube (small). When they are nicely cooked I put the bacon back in the pan and break however many eggs over everything and gently toss to mix in. I don't always use cheese but will sometimes put a bowl of shredded cheese on the table as a choice. This is so easy to adjust to how ever many you are serving and there will always be requests for seconds. We call it breakfast mush and it's usually in demand when the kids come home for a visit.

I gave this recipe four stars only because my kids refused to eat it. It looked like one big pile of mush. Take the suggestion of others and drain the bacon grease. I think that had a lot to do with the look. I peeled and shredded fresh potatoes so it took a lot longer to cook. My very picky husband LOVED it. He is a big guy who normally goes back for seconds and thirds nonly had one plate. This really filled us up! We ate it about 9:00 and it was 5:00 before we ate again!! VERY FILLING!We will try with sausage next time. A keeper!!

I made this with leftover hash browns and ham.  I have been making something like this for years and it's always a hit.  I love to do this when I have odds and ends in the fridge to use up.

My favorite! I am a VERY picky eater. My boyfriends mother makes this and it's my FAVORITE! It's better with Sausage then with bacon, and agreed a little onion goes a long way with this dish. When in a rush, bagged irish potato's go great too! Just cut em in half! Great, Easy meal.

I changed the balance of a lot of items when I made this. I also added several things to it which helped give it a lot more flavor. I don't think I'll ever make it to this recipe, but I'll probably rely on my additions as a great hangover food.

I did not care for this recipe. Couldn't taste anything but the overwheming amount of bacon, and the excessive amount of cheese makes it a gooey mess.

I am 67 years old and my daddy used to take me fishing and crabbing on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico here in Texas...Dad always called this dish St. Clair Hash(or last name). We made it over a campfire on the beach... O M Goodness,what wonderful memories...sometimes Daddy fudged a bit and parboiled the 'taters and fried the bacon crispy and put it in a peanut butter jar to keep it crunchy...WOW!!! great cooking.....Nixxiv

we have been making this at home for quite a while and we call it "a mess'  it is easy and quick to make but really delicious...we even sometimes put this 'mess' wraped in a flour tortilla...instant breakfast.

I haven't made this exact recipe but something very similar. This is one of our favorite breakfasts when we are camping. I love it because there is only one pan to clean! Of course, we scale it down to suit the family. We like to add chopped onion and diced red pepper, often times we skip the cheese. Sometimes we substitute sliced breakfast sausage or do half sausage, half bacon. Another thing that can make it an easy breakfast for camping is that we use dehydrated hashbrowns.  They aren't something I've ever looked for here where I live but my snowbird parents discovered them at a Costco down in Arizona one winter and usually bring some home for us as they are so handy for camping!
