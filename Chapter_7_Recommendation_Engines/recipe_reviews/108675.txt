This is macaroni and cheese as I grew up with.  Very delicious!  The only thing is, the bacon doesn't really crisp up too well when cooked as the recipe states.  The thing to do is to half-fry the bacon first, then lay it on top and cook as the recipe states.  It will get perfectly crisp and will be much easier to portion out if you do it this way.

This is a well loved staple in my house. I've made it both ways by putting the bacon on top and chopping it and mixing it in with the rest on the mixture...I definately prefer it on top of the dish. I also add some garlic and chili powder. I will make this again and again...SO GOOD.

This is almost exactly how we make macaroni and cheese except instead of putting tomato juice IN the cheese sauce, we add a little milk and then after it's done baking spoon tomato soup on top!  I have NO idea how why we started doing this but I won't make mac and cheese unless there is a can of tomato soup also!  And people can say what they want about "processed cheeses" but I prefer it to the oily grainy texture of Cheddar cheese anyday!

It was good, especially with the bacon baked in.  I ended up cutting the bacon into 1" pieces and mixed it in.  I did about half of the tomato juice as directed, and I'm glad because it still had an odd taste to it. I am going to try tomato sauce next time.

This recipe was a lot of fun to make and left my apartment smelling divine.  The bacon makes the dish a little bit too greesy, so next time I am going to use a thinner cut and maybe try to cook it for a minute or so before putting it on the bake. I would also recomend adding more cheese. All things considered, it was a success, although I can't ever see anything bacon and cheese not satisfying my hungry boyfriend.

I just didn't like this in casserole form. The macaroni and Cheese tasted delicious before I put it in the oven. Next time I will just eat this as plain mac and cheese and I'll mix fried bacon bits in.

Very good.  I think next time I will try chopping the bacon up and mixing it in first.

I didn't think it was bad, but no one in the family liked it. It's just not what you expect from mac and cheese.

My son and husband absolutely loved this!  They could not guess that there was tomato juice in this and were surprised when I told them it was! I halved the recipe as it was just the three of us and crisped the bacon a bit first.  My son has already asked me to make this again!

Left out the bacon and it was still good! Next time I will use Bloody Mary mix instead of tomato juice.

This is one of my favorite recipes now, though I chop the raw bacon before placing it on top so it's easier to spoon out.
