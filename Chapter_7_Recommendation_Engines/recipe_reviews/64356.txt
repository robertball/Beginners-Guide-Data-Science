Couldn't do the egg topping.  Just couldn't. Hubs and I both agreed this was an odd match. Other than that, the beans were delicious.  I steamed them, then immediately shocked them in ice water not only to stop the cooking process but to preserve their vivid green color.  I used red onion for extra color as well. And you can't go wrong with fresh dill in my book - ever.  Now eggs on green beans on the other hand...

Yum!  Goes wonderfully with cheesy deviled eggs and cornbread.  Tastes like a chef salad with the eggs, I recommend it!

A surprisingly delicious dish.  I used fresh dill from our garden.  Garlic in green beans was a new concept for me, and I wasn't sure about the eggs, but the flavors all blended well together.  The only thing I did different was to lightly saute the onion and garlic in the butter, then add the fresh green beans, stir together and cover.  I turned up the heat a little, and occasionally stirred until crisp tender, adding the dill and chopped eggs at the very end.

Good and easy. Used a small amount of "Gourmet Garden Dill Herb Blend", comes in a tube, in refrigerated section at the grocery store. This is much easier than chopping fresh dill. I just added it in with the butter mixture. My beans were Haricots Verts, the small French type of green beans. These are very tender, without strings.

Not bad.  I couldn't taste the dill much, so I'd up it next time--we have plenty of it!  The eggs add an interesting touch to this dish.  I really didn't think they would, but I thought I'd give it a shot, and the creamy flavor of the egg brings out the flavor of the green beans.  I didn't use onion--we aren't huge fans of cooked onion so I used onion powder--and also used olive oil instead of butter.  Worked just fine.  thanks for the recipe!

So delicious! Really flavorful and a tasty change from "plain" green beans. I did not top with hard-boiled eggs but would give it a try sometime when not feeding two kids who would protest strongly.

These were so yummy! I can't believe my 5 year old gobbled up 2 helpings- and so did I! I might cut back on the butter next time just to cut back slightly on calories, though I sure didn't mind all the butter made as the recipe states.

I made this - with the eggs - and it turned out great. The flavors went well together.

Left out the egg. Was worried that the sauce was too small, but was just the right amount. Will definitely be making this again!
