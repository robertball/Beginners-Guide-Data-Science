I would give it five stars after my personal modifications...if you want your vegetables to still be 'tender-crisp' or simply have some firmer texture but still have the 'bitterness' cooked out, then cut the slices thicker or lengthwise.  I do not use butter...rather I toss my veggies in olive oil and toss in some slices onions, minced garlic, and diced tomatoes.  I also sprinkle some sea salt and black pepper over everything and then wrap it all up in the foil and throw on my griddle/grill on the stovetop (too cold for grilling right now).  About 20 minutes...perfect side dish!

Very good for my Weight Watchers plan!  I omitted the butter though (3/4 cup, wow that's a lot) and used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray. I added minced garlic, chopped onion,  green peppers, and italian seasoning.  Followed the advice on reducing the salt/pepper and it was delicious!

This was a pretty good recipe ofcourse I tinkered with it and added some stuff to it like  chopped garlic, tomatoes, and chopped green onions and it was superb. The whole family loved it even my little ones who are picky. Thanks, sonya

I added some julienned carrots to this vegetable dish. Instead of grilling, I opted to make the veggies by steaming instead of grilling in all the butter.  I left out the black pepper and garlic powder, choosing instead to saute some minced garlic in about 1 Tbsp of butter, and drizzled it on top of the veggies, followed by a sprinkling of freshly grated parmesan cheese.

This was good, but when I started making it I thought the amounts of butter and seasonings was WAY too much, so I cut those amounts in half and it was STILL too much! Next time I'll try cutting it down to 1/2 stick of butter and a teaspoon each of salt, pepper and garlic powder and it should be really good.

The measurements of tablespoons just didn't sound right to me so I used teaspoons of spices and it came out very good.  I will make this again adding mushrooms, onion, and red bell peppers.

This was yummy.  I cut down on the butter and added fresh red onions to the mix.  I eyeballed the suggested seasonings and in addition added some Italian seasonings.  This recipe turned out great.

I never use all that butter - it's way too much. I use I can't believe it's not butter spray. I add some fresh portabella mushrooms and some cherry tomatoes cut in half along with red onion cut into rings and a few dashes of italian seasoning. Also, the measurements for the salt and pepper may be a little off on here too.  Just add to taste.

This was good with my salmon! I did however add red onion.  I also used butter flavored pam cooking spray instead of the butter.  My non veggie eating husband even mentioned that it was good (rare if Gram didn't make it). Delish!!  Thanks Jay!!

I prefer to put mine directly onto a grill or grill pan instead of sealing them in foil.  Sometimes I add peppers, but adding feta cheese during the last minute or two if you are grilling in a grill pan on the stove is really tasty. Excellent recipe, very good!

We make these all the time. I could eat squash with every meal. Instead of the butter we use light olive oil. Also, we don't put the squash in foil, we cut them in thick slices and just stick them right on the grill. I find that the foil steams them too much and they become a bit soggy. I like my veggies to still have a crunch!

This is okay (although too much butter) if you like steamed, mushy veggies on the grill.  I think I'll stick with marinading (olive oil, balsamic vinegar and garlic) cutting veg in larger chunks, and placing directly on the grill for that wonderful smokey grilled flavor with tender-crisp doneness.

Simple and delicious!  I didn't measure the butter (Smart Balance) but just tossed a few dollops on top of the veggies until I felt there was enough.  Turned out wonderful without being too buttery.

I use olive oil instead of butter since we're on a non-dairy diet.  Also, any seasons can be substituted for the ones in the recipe.  I enjoy some garlic powder, salt, pepper, and some rosemary.  :)

Two TABLESPOONS of pepper?  That cannot be right.  I loved the idea of this recipe, but cut the pepper by 3/4, also used only 2 tablespoons of butter, a little EVOO and 2 tablespoons of water.  Sprinkled on some oregeno as well.  Good start to a great recipe.  Thanks!

Delicious! I just sprinkled enough seasoning that I felt was right, and used garlic salt instead of powder. I also baked it in a 350 oven for about 20-25 minutes.

Oh my! Way too much of everything and not enough zucchini and squash.  The taste was promising and I'll probably try it again. But next time, I'll read the reviews and take some of the advice posted. Thanks for the recipe.

A stick and a half of butter?  You've got to be kidding me... I made it with one stick and it was still way too much.  Pretty yummy, though next time I'll only use a half stick of butter.

This is a good base recipe but the amount of seasonings is too much. I cut down on the spices and added sliced onions and some whole cloves of garlic. The vegetables turn out softer than if grilled directly on the grate. I served this up with some baby back ribs and potato salad.

As written, this recipe has way way way too much seasoning! I only used 1 teaspoon of each and it was still too much. With less seasoning, this blend would be great!

This dish was a huge hit with my son but there was way too much butter.  Next time I will only use 1/4-1/3 cup.  Serve with fresh parmesan cheese grated on top!

I really liked this recipe and I will make it again.  I quartered and sliced the squash and zucchini- personal preference- and added carrots sliced thinly on the bias. 5 stars because it was so easy and had a very nice flavor that let the veggies shine.

I didn't follow the measurements exactly, and I only used zucchini, and it was really good.  I especially liked the variation with olive oil and Italian seasonings!  This will become a staple at our neighborhood bar-be-cues this summer.

I tried to make this as the recipe said (although I thought the spices and butter were a LOT) and it was extremely salty, but it did have a good flavor so next time I will add mushrooms, peppers and half the butter and salt.

This could be a five star recipe with just a few adjustments. Less butter is the main thing but adding sliced onions and cherry tomatoes make this an absolute super dish. I found the cooking time a little short 30 minutes is probably closer to what it needs even for a slightly crisper veggie. Dont forget to turn it regularly so the butter coats everything also.

I sliced the zucchini and squash like the recipe said and it was tooo mushy, probably would have been alot better if the vegetables were cut in bigger chunks.

Great recipe! I used yellow squash and zucchini, added sliced onions, and decreased the amount of butter.  Made the package early in the day, put it in the refridgerator, and onto the grill for dinner.

These were really good! Did have to cook a little longer than 20 mins., more like 25 mins. but I know that times tend to vary. Will definitely make again! Oh, and you got to watch out for dripping butter when you take the foil off the grill.

This is wonderful!  I added an onion, sliced very thin to the zucchini and yellow squash.  I sprinkled the mixture with garlic powder, fresh cracked black pepper, red pepper and soy sauce.  This tastes like the mixed veggies you get at the Japanese restaurants.

Left out the butter and simply stir fried it in the skillet with a little EVOO - great flavor combo. Perfect side for fish.

I have to admit, I didn't measure the salt, pepper, or garlic powder. I know how much we like, so I just sprinkled. I also think the butter seems like overkill, so I used 1/2 cup rather than 3/4 cup, and even that was a lot. But I must confess the buttery flavor was absolutely delicious.

I did a twist of this, recipe because we were out of propane and have a glass cook top. I put slices of it on aluminum foil, and put a very tiny amount of butter on top of each slice with sea salt and crushed black pepper. Also put Italian seasoning, and minced garlic on top, and since we have onion haters in my house, I chopped up onions and put piles between all the pieces and around the edges so we still got the flavor. These were such a hit, everyone ate it all, and it's a request once a week now!

I have made grilled veggies exactly to this recipe before and they were delicious, but the second time I made them I just sprinkled them with McCormick Grill Mates Roasted Garlic Montreal Chicken seasoning instead of using the seasonings listed, added a splash of butter, and then after I tossed them really well I added a few dashes of grated parmesan cheese. Cooked them on the grill for about 20 minutes and they were spectacular.

This was quite good. I used 1 T. of olive oil instead of the frightful amount of butter called for and added a 4 oz. can of mushrooms. That really jazzed it up. The kids still wouldn't touch zucchini but hubby and I enjoyed it.

Delicious! I made a few changes - I let the zucchini grill on an open grill and did not put it into the foil. I like the grill marks on them.  I also used cooking spray instead of the butter to save some fat and calories. Delicious! I actually prefer the yellow squash to the green squash.

This is one of the worst vegetable dishes that my family has ever had.  After two bites we just couldn't eat anymore.  Maybe our squash and zuchinni weren't ripe enough but just not enough seasoning or taste.

this recipe is a keeper, easy on the grill.My husband and i both loved it, of course with extra garlic on them.  The second time i tried it, i added a bit of lemon pepper on them and it really zested it up a bit.  Very good.

Very good way to grill squash. I added onions in with ours tonight and they turned out really good. :o)

Reasonably quick and tasty.  Play around with the spices a bit, depending on your meal

Came out perfect the first time; however, next time, I'll cut the spices in half.

This is so easy and delicious that you don't have to take any extra time in prep. Just throw it on with everything else.

Oh yes I will be making it again, soon.  We loved it and I did add  Old Bay seasoning, and I also had a little rub so I sprinkled it on top of the veggies also.  It turned out really good.  Lulusmom

Only tried it once so far and I enjoyed it.  Next time I'd like to add some more flavor to it.

Super easy!!  I'll make it again, but this time toss the squash with the seasonings to spread it evenly before putting in foil. I also cut them pretty thick and 20 minutes was perfect.

I tweaked it a bit. Used spray butter to reduce the calories and lightly sprinkled it with Weber Steak  'N Chop. It was simple and DELICIOUS !

this recipe was very good, I'm going to make it again tonight to go with some T-bone steaks on the grill. Even my husband liked them, and he's a very picky eater!

I thought this was great!  I used 1/4 cup of butter, and about three tablespoons of olive oil  I forgot to put the garlic in until after I sealed it all up, so I guess we'll try that next time.  This is a great way to cook zucchini and summer squash.

Simply great.  Quick, easy, healthy, delicious. My zucchini-hating husband and grandson even had to admit they liked this.

I used less butter and cooked for less time to keep the vegetables al dente, but this is a great one and very easy!
