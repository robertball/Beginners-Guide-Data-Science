I can't seem to follow any recipes exactly, so of course I changed this one.  I added garlic, like 6 cloves chopped, instead of thyme, I used approx 2 TBS fresh-chopped rosemary (I have it growing in my garden), some fresh oregano, and I did use the olive oil, lemon juice and salt/pepper to taste, but I doubled the amounts to marinade the lamb chops.  I marinated the chops overnight about 24-30 hours.   We grilled it in the next evening.  Served with potatoes, grilled veggies, and a nice red wine.  Voila, it was GREAT!

quick & easy .... needed more lemon juice. I used dried THYME....it lacked somethiong... maybe fresh THYME would have made a difference.

This is a wonderful dish, however a few crushed cloves of garlic and rosemary will spice it up even more.  Try a boned leg of lamb in place of chops for another treat.

PERFECTCHERRY - it might help if you used the correct ingredients... Lavender??? Anyway, we loved this! I put the chops in a pyrex dish, drizzled them with olive oil (way less than 1/2 a cup), drizzled the juice of half a lemon over, then snipped some fresh thyme and rosemary on top. I marinaded them overnight, and the flavor was just perfect! Great recipe. Thanks, Diane!

I made this for my sister; I don't eat lamb.

She thought this was fantastic. I added fresh chopped oregano to the fresh chopped thyme, and thought it smelled great. Next time, I'd add a bit of fresh chopped garlic.

I have a halogen oven, and in that it took 14 total minutes to cook to perfection.

I'd make this again for my sister, and highly recommend it as is, or with garlic. Thanks,  Diane, for the recipe.

Very simple, easy to do. I cheated--I used my George Foreman Grillin' Machine to do the cooking.Despite the lack of smoked flavor, chops were tender, juicy, and very tasty.

I added Rosemary to this as well.  This probably was really good, but I did not marinate it long enough.  I will marinate it longer next time.

I found the recommended amount of lavender was really overwhelming; My husband and I didn't care for the end result at all. If I ever make this recipe again I will probably use only half as much lavender.

This recipe turned out good but not fantastic.  The flavor didn't get into the pork chops too well.  If I make this recipe again, I might marinate the pork chops for 5 hours or so.  The meat also turned out pretty tough, but this could be due to my use of a George Foreman Indoor Grill.  In the future, I might grill the meat less than the 10 minutes called for by the recipe.

I have had lamb chops many times before. This is my favorite recipe thus far. I used my oven broiler rather than the grill. DELICIOUS!!!

The marinade needs onions and garlic, lots of it.  Let marinade overnight...delish.

Instead of using rosemary I used fresh dill. Then I baked it 250 for two hours, then broiled it for a few minutes to crisp it up. It came out medium. I topped with some blue cheese crumbles, then I made a dip as well that had fresh dill, white onion, and sour cream. This was a perfect dish, the dip went perfect with the lamb. My fiance loved it.

very nice flavor and tender. The only changes I made were how to cook. I didn't want to mess with the grill so I put them on a foil lined cooking sheet, baked at 500 for 10 minutes then dropped to 350 for another 5 or until its no longer red inside. i marinated them for 3 hours. really nice recipe!

Excellent recipe, but be careful when putting the chops on an open-flame grill.  They will be HIGHLY flamable.

Made for Easter dinner. It was great and super easy! Marinated for about 6 hours before putting on the grill. Had to use dried thyme since I won't have fresh until the garden is planted. Per the family's request this is staying on the Easter menu for at least a few more years.

Very straightforward recipe which was delicious, but the chops definitely need to be marinated longer than an hour, like many reviewers have said before.  I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet for about 3-4 minutes a side, using about 1" thick chops.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I could not taste the marinate at all.  I halved the ingredients, cut slits into my lamb chops and let them soak in the fridge for over an hour, but the marinade gave absolutely no flavor.  I couldn't tell I had marinaded them at all.  Very disappointing.

This was wonderful. However, like other on this site, I can't leave good enough alone. I addedgarlic, garam masala, rosemary  and dill. I pan fried it in olive oil instead of grilling.  Deliish!!!

This tasted no different from when I had lamb chops seasoned only with salt and pepper (which is still delicious and highly recommended).  However, when I marinade meat, I expect to taste the flavors after grilling it, and with this marinade, I couldn't taste the lemon juice or the thyme.  The chops were still terrific, but I probably won't use this marinade again.
