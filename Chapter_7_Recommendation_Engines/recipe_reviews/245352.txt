I saw that another reviewer talked about how the cookies burned, so I reduced the baking temperature to 375 and only baked the cookies for 8 minutes on parchment paper and they turned out perfect! You could always bake them for a minute or two longer, but start with 8 minutes and go up from there.

2.5  Unfortunately these did not taste like eggnog at all and making the colored sugar was kind of a hassle but I did try.  Bottoms burnt @ 10 minutes for first batch and almost @ 8 minutes for the second batch.   Again, an alright taste for the unburned ones but shall stick with my regular snickerdoodle recipe.
