This had good flavor from the bacon and onion and I used potatoes that had peppers and onions added. This was tasty overall but rather wet and needed some contrast in textures. The potatoes started crisp but after adding them to the beef/cabbage mix they got wet too. We ate this and enjoyed what we had but voted not to have it again. The bacon should have been crisp to suit me and I picked the limp pieces out. Just my picky preference though. Overall a good recipe and it was worth giving it a try.

Simply wonderful and quick to make. Yes, it does need a pinch more salt. I also sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top for fun.

Ehhh..... OK...had a good flavor, nothing to get excited over. I cooked the cabbage uncovered because the other reviewers said it was soggy. I stir fried it, so it really wasn't soggy at all. Added the hashbrowns right at the end, which I baked in the oven while frying the beef, bacon and onions, to cut down on another thing to fry. They turned out great. Easy and quick, which is what I was looking for and my family ate it without complaint... I would rate this a level above Hamburger Helper.

My family loves this dish! The only thing I change is that I substituted more beef broth for the apple juice.

This recipe is very bland and tasteless. I added soy sauce to the  serving on my plate and then it tasted better. I won't be making this again.

I used mashed potatoes instead of hash browns, and it was a marvelous dish, almost like a cottage pie casserole. The cabbage was awesome in it, and I didnâ€™t find it bland at all. This is going in regular rotation in my kitchen!

This was yummy.  My children loved it and asked for seconds. I did make a few changes but kept all the same ingredients. I used 4 slices of bacon, 1/3 cup apple juice, added salt to taste and used tator tots instead of hash browns.  I broke up the tots after baking them and added them after they rest was done cooking. Everything else I kept the same. Good stuff.

This was a very tasty recipe and it was a huge hit with my family. I added a bit more salt, pepper, and apple juice than the recipe called for so my dish didn't turn out to be too bland at all (in fact it had a nice blend of savory and a touch of sweet flavors) - also I added in some garlic with the onions and let the onions/bacon sautee/crisp up some before I added the ground beef. I didn't find the recipe to be too soggy as well (maybe because I  did what some other reviewers did and added them in at the last second so the potatoes still had that salty crunch). I also didn't cover the pan when I added the cabbage in so I don't know if that made a difference.

This was better than expected after reading other reviews.  I did not have any bacon so I left it out and it still turned out pretty good.  My hubby really liked it and had seconds.  Next time I'll include the bacon for a little more flavor.  I would make this again if I had the ingredients on hand, but I think it will be demanded again before then.

This is my second time making this, i did cook it uncovered, and added minced garlic. I also used more cabbage than it called for and left it a little more aldenta for more contrast in the texture,very good! Pairs well with a sour dough roll.
