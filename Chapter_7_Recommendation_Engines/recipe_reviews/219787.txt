I've been eyeing this recipe for a while, but I don't have a pressure cooker.  I finally decided to make it as I often make soup.  I roasted my fennel and leek to bring out the natural flavors and then added 3 cups of homemade chicken stock.  I brought it to just below a boil and then let it simmer for about 2 hours.  I did think it could benefit from some S&P, but the actual recipe calls for a bullion cube so that may have taken care of that.  There is no strong licorice flavor, which I feared.  It is just a light vegetable soup and very tasty.

This was incredibly delicious and really, really easy.  I did use homemade stock rather than the bouillon cube and I also cooked for 20 minutes and used the quick-release method rather than waiting.  Terrific!

This was weird, but good. I ended up making this with a cube of beef bouillon cube and 1 can of beef broth, since my fennel bulb was pretty large. I added 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and 1 teaspoon of black pepper for a little kick. I did not add the olive oil at the end because that seemed like it wouldn't add much to the flavor. I had never had fennel before, and I found that it was a nice change from the monotony of winter-time vegetables. It definitely did not taste like licorice. I would make this again, but would probably add cut-up polska kielbasa sausage to it since my family loves the flavor of meat.

Good and easy!  I had fennel and leek in my produce box and had no idea what to do with them.  This was easy and tasty.  The licorice flavor of the fennel was not noticeable, (a plus in my opinion.) I added extra leek, since I had them, and will probably add more bouillon next time.  Looking forward to the leftovers over some leftover rice.

Really simple and really good!  I don't have a pressure cooker, so cooked it in a pan for about an hour.  I used Trader Joe's low sodium vegetable broth.  You could probably add stuff, but it's so good and simple and quick, why would you?

Thank you SO much for this recipe! I got fennel in my weekly produce box and panicked because my husband and I do not like licorice at all. Well, this soup had no taste of licorice, and had a wonderfully smooth flavor. I did add a potato for more heartiness, plus salt and pepper, and think that the next time, yes I am converted now thank you, I will add more veggies and perhaps some fresh herbs. Thank you again for a great recipe!

I was feeling under the weather, so I made this. It was great! I have never used fennel before. I was surprised that the it didn't impart a licorice taste- just the perfect bit of mellow sweetness to go with the saltiness. I used miso paste instead of veggie bouillon. Also, I added small 1 cm cubes of goat feta cheese to my bowl, since it was my meal. I didn't use a pressure cooker- cooked about 15 minutes until tender.
