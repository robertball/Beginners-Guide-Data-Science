I didn't add any jalapeno or cayenne pepper - nice fresh taste.  I blended 1/2 and kept the other half with larger chunks.  The larger one I served as a side to a pork dish.

I had tons of green and half ripened tomatoes this year.  I decided to try this recipe and I am glad I did.  I will  make this again, for sure.  I added some kosher salt and black pepper and extra lime juice, but used all the peppers listed.  It was not too hot, for me.  I was glad to get to use oregano from my garden, too!

Very good, I added one tablespoon of salt to bring out the flavors, and heated it to a boil for canning.

Love the flavor.  Different; interesting.  I agree with another reviewer who wrote that the recipe needs salt and extra lime juice.  It is quite bland without salt.  I made a smaller batch, but I think it would work out to about a tablespoon for the full recipe, but just salt to taste.   Other than that, it's a great way to use up green tomatoes that have succumbed to blossom end rot or early frost.  I used hotter peppers than the recipe, didn't use bell peppers, but omitted the cayenne, as I don't like powders in fresh salsa.  I don't feel it would be too hot for most people, but definitely has heat, and the heat intensifies the longer the salsa ages, so keep that in mind for the faint of heart.

Great idea to use up all those excess green tomatoes.  Turned out beautifully.  I did, however, follow another suggestion and prepped it for canning.  I will be making this again.

I made a smaller batch (3 cups green tomatoes; 1 onion, etc) and without serrano peppers, as I didn't have those, and I substituted palm sugar for regular sugar, but it turned out great.  Was going to give it 4-1/2 stars but that's not an option. Thank you for this recipe! Great on melted cheese sandwiches, as a topping on scrambled eggs, as omelette filling, as well as all the regular uses of salsa.

I added more jalapeño as it wasn't spicy enough. Next time I would not chop everything so small.  Since it is going in the blender the tomatoes could be larger pieces.

I made this with my garden leftovers and my husband LOVED it. It is spicy and tasty, and really easy to make.

I am thrilled to find this way to use green tomatoes, when fall frost arrives. I added 1 Tablespoon of salt like another reviewer suggested. I reduced the sugar to 2 teaspoons. I omitted the dried cayenne. I used fresh peppers from our garden, with the seeds, 4 Serrano peppers and 1 cayenne pepper. It made it a nice mild salsa. This morning I am adding this salsa to my MaltOMeal, along with salt and butter, so yummy! Last night we added it to our tofu spread sandwiches! I will definitely be making this salsa every time I have green tomatoes needing to be used.

I didn’t have the jalapeños but not everybody likes those so I will buy some and put them on the side. Chopping took me a long time because I did it by hand looking to get a chopper in the future. I would probably make it again but I would try with the hot peppers in half the batch.

I only gave it 4 stars because I made it much milder than the recipe because I live in Colorado and most of my friends can't handle  mild green chiles. Anyway, I cut the Cayenne to 1 tsp, 2 jalapenos, 2 Serranos, and one fire roasted Hatch mild green chile. Also used 4 limes and added a tsp of salt. I'm letting it sit overnight so all the flavors get a chance to bloom and will adjust seasonings then if I need to.
