We usually cook the oysters on an open grill but this is a good way if it is too cold outside.The sauce was simple and good.  The sauce I make is melted butter with minced garlic (lots of garlic) and chopped fresh cilantro.

Better than the vinegar I grew up putting on barbecued oysters. This is good if you like cooked oysters, I think I prefer them raw.
