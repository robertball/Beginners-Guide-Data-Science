I so wanted to like this recipe especially after all of the hard work grating the veggies, but it was a bomb. Total bummer. My husband described it as cardboard like in flavor. I think it has potential with mega modifications, but it is really missing something. Salt for starters.

These were delicious. I grated them in the food processor so it was quick work. I actually made these twice.. once I wasnt paying attention and threw all the ingredients in together and baked.. the second time, I made per recipe - squeezing the shredded veggies out. I really couldnt tell the difference so I would say no need to squeeze them out unless you have really juicy veggies. Mine were fine. I added salt and pepper and they were perfect.  I also cooked a few in the waffle iron.. they cooked well too. Only thing to add it some oil to the batter to get them crispy
