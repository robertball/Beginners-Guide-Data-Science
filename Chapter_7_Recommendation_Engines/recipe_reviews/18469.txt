I know a lot of people prefer a cobbler with a flaky crust, and if that is you try another recipe.  I, on the other hand, love a thicker, cake-like crust.  This crust reminds me of a good bread pudding, the edges have just a little crunch and the center is soft and custard like.  If that is the kind of cobbler you preffer, then this is the best recipe.

I did make a couple of changes.  I added a 1/4 cup more flour and milk to make more crust, and I used a smaller/deeper baking dish.  I had to adjust the cooking time/temp a little for best results.  350-375 for 30 minutes then bump the temp to 400 for 10 minutes.  Be sure to keep an eye on it in the last 10 minutes since.  Everything was set perfectly for me at the 10 minute mark, but we all know there are a great number of factors that affect cook time.

Anyways, I'll be playing with this recipe some more, so if I come up with some bit thing that makes a significant change, I might be back.

This is a little different than some other cobblers I've had. It's a really good throw together, ingredients are usually on hand. I've made this twice now and I followed the recipe the first time. The second time I made this, I put a bit of cinnamon in the batter and increased the amount of cinnamon by a little that's sprinkled on top. I thought it turned out better the second time. I will make this again!

My family raved about this cobbler.  Of course I served it with vanilla bean ice cream while it was still warm. It was so so good.  I made this cobbler with two minor changes. I prepared this with about 6 large fresh peaches sliced thinly instead of canned peaches. Also, after it had been in the oven for about 5 minutes and had started to "set", I sprinkled the top with about 2 Tbl sugar and then continued to bake it. I imagine I will prepare this cobbler many many more times because it really was very easy and very delicious.

My favorite canned peach cobbler!!  This was absolutely delicious and gone in record time.  I used dark brown sugar (lightly packed), butter instead of margarine, half 'n' half instead of milk, and added a bit of cinnamon to the batter.  I also used Margaret Holmes O'sage Ragged Freestone Peach halves and pieces, chopped up a bit. (which, in my opinion, makes a difference).  My cobbler was neither bland nor dry.  This is an absolute MUST TRY recipe!!  My mouth is watering thinking about it... To make it easier, I save my version as a custom recipe if anyone is interested.

This was very good.  I made the first batch in an 8x8 pan, based on other reviews, and I decided a 13x9x2 pan would have been better.  The batter was too thick in the 8x8 pan and it engulfed the peaches.  The second batch, in the 13x9x2 fared better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Okay, I read most of the reviews and this cobbler is divided depending on your own tastes. I made this twice over the weekend. The first time I made this I followed it exact and baked it in a 9x13 pan and my family devored it before I had a chance to get a little bite! I found it to be a bit mushy like and I did bake it longer than what the recipe called for. BUT I found it very yummy!! The next day we were invited over for dinner with the parents and I was to make dessert. My husband said I had to make this for dessert so off to the store I went to buy more canned peaches. This time I decided to double the entire recipe becuase we had a bunch to feed and I added a 1/2 cup more flour and a little nutmeg with the cinnamon. I had to bake it in a 9x13 which was perfect to use and baked it for about 50-55 minutes since the recipe was doubled. It turned out better than the first try just following the recipe as was. I really liked the recipe as is and I don't rate unless I find it to be five stars and before I made it a second time my rating was five stars!! I WILL make this again!! If you want the cake part to be more cakier than add a little more flour. I thought it was fabulous doubled so there you are!! I am usually a bisquit-y cobbler person but this was wonderful!! Thank you!!

This was really delicious. I added 1 teaspoon of brown sugar to the cinnamon to sprinkle on top of the peaches and it was no regret.

Used an 8x8 pan and had to cook it 15 to 20 minutes longer before it was firm in the middle. Everybody had a second helping!

Next time I will put it in a smaller pan or double the peaches and use some of the juice from the canned peaches. Other than that it was perfect, a hit at my new year's day dinner party. Served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, there was NONE LEFT!!!

This is my first time to make "canned cobbler" - this recipe is excellent and my co-workers could not stop talking about how delicious it was.  I doubled the crust batter and spices plus used 3 1/2 28 oz cans of sliced peaches - served topped with redi-whip.  This is an excellent, easy and quick dessert.

This recipe was great.. I didn't have a large can of peaches, only small so I scaled the recipe in half and cooked it in a square pan. Cooked it for the same amount of time and it came out perfect. My husband and I sent the kids to bed and ate it warm with french vanilla ice cream. There's none left. It was heavenly! Now what do I say tomorrow morning when they ask for some?

This recipe turned out beautifully. I made the cobbler in a 9x9 pan. It was in the oven for about 40 minutes. I also followed other reviews, by placing the peaches on the bottom of the pan and then the batter on top. 
I would also recommend putting 1/4 of the 1/2 cup brown sugar into the batter. Then use the leftover 1/4 brown sugar with the cinnamon to sprinkle on top. 
I will make this recipe again!

I've been looking for a peach cobbler recipe like the one my mom would bake when I was younger. I have to say this is pretty close! I like the cake-like crust. If you like it more custard-like, save the juice and mix it in. Instead of putting the peaches on top of the batter, I put the peaches in a 9x9 inch baking pan, then spread the batter on top of the peaches. The batter was a little too sweet, so next time I will maybe put only half the amount of sugars called for. To add the peach juice/syrup, I just put only 1/4 cup of milk and then added about 3/4 cup of the juice/syrup. It was really yummy and I can't wait to try it again!

thought this would be good since i mixed the butter w/ the ingredients (a little different than most recipes).... i did it exactly as described and it turned out kind of bready and not very moist.  i'll probably go back to my other recipes on peach cobbler.

Awesome, but don't forget to grease the pan.  The recipe is missing that important step.

I've never baked cobbler before as it is not a dish known in the UK.  This recipe was easy, and it turned out perfectly.  I prefer to cook with butter, so I subsituted 125 gms (4 oz) of Anchor butter for the margarine which probably improved the flavour.  I served it with homemade vanilla icecream and everyone wanted seconds.
I will definitely make this again.

Pretty good and easy recipe!  I doubled everything and used a 9x14 pan.  I melted the first stick of butter in the pan and incorporated the second in the batter. I replaced about 1/2 cup of the milk with peach juice and put extra juice in as I spooned on the peaches. I reduced the amount of white sugar. I reserved about 3/4 cup of batter to even out the ratio of peaches to batter and I will make a mini cobbler for dinner later in the week. I changed the baking method to account for my changes.  I preheated the oven to 400 and then reduced it to 350 when I put the cobbler in.  After 1/2 hour I increased it to 400 to achieve a nice golden brown top.  The total time was approx. 50 minutes.  Brought this to a large dinner party  and everyone loved it.

My family loves this very traditional cobbler.  The batter can easily absorb the liquid from the peaches; don't drain them!  400 degrees is too hot.  The top of my first cobbler was very dark brown.  Try 350-375 instead.

I made this for my husband and he absolutely loved it. It was such an easy dessert to make any night. I just put it in the oven before we ate dinner and when we were finished, the cobbler was also done. It tasted great right out of the oven with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream :)

I was searching for a perfect fruit cobbler recipe and am convinced I've found it. Not just for peaches either! I've done strawberry, blueberry, peach and apple with this recipe ...all with stellar results! We like to spoon it over ice cream ... or eat it warm right out of the pan. ;)

I have a lot of canned pears, so I was looking for a cobbler recipe to use what I put up.  Tried this recipe - but left out the white suger because the pears were already sweetened in the jar.  Was great!!! The whole cobbler was gone in 2 days, and it's just my husband and I.  Had it for snacktime and afterdinner dessert both days!!!! Never used brown sugar or cinnamon (with Pears) before and never mixed the melted butter into the batter, but both made the cobbler delicious and easy to mix.  Will definitely use this recipe again and again.

I used 5 large fresh peaches rather than canned.  My husband and I found it hard to not eat the entire thing in one sitting!  This  is a fabulous recipe.

This is the most awsomely wonderful peach pudding/cake/cobbler thingee I've eaten in AGES!  It's only hubby and myself, so I scaled recipe WAY down and baked in 2 ramikins (350 for 25").  Served with a dollop of ice cream (although I think whpped cream would have been just fine) and we were in HEAVEN!  Thanks so much for recipe - we truly love it :)  Note to self: drop to serving of *6* and use the tiny 1/2 pint jars of peaches I canned .... try blueberries as well - I bet they'd be smashing

This was very easy. My husband and our dinner guest liked it. My sons and I thought it was okay. I think I should have cooked it longer than the time stated.

This was really good.  I don't like when people rate a recipe and then say the changes they made, but I am going to do just that.  My changes were very minor!  When I tasted the batter, it seemed really sweet so I added a sprinkle of nutmeg.  I also melted the real butter in the microwave directly in the 9x13.  Then I poured the batter in the butter and swirled it together, not mix it.  I added raspberries with the peaches and used a large can of peaches.  Then sprinkled it with cinnamon.  I brought it to a memorial day party with ice cream and the pan was scraped clean and the ice cream never even made it to the table.  I also had requests for the recipe.  Thanks!!

While I thought this was good--and it was certainly all eaten at my house--I was more impressed with the EASE it takes to make it. It's definitely a "cakey" type of cobbler, which isn't what I think of as a cobbler; I prefer a light, flakey, pie-like crust so I'll be trying the Old Fashioned Peach Cobber on here next. If you make this one, unless you like a LOT of cake/crust, you should double the peaches which will make it more 50/50.

This recipes is awesome! I'm usually not a fan of cobblers because the crust is usually flavorless and blah.  This one is superb! I love the texture of the crust, so flavorful and light.  This is a definite keeper! Thank you for sharing!!

This is the best peach cobbler I have EVER ate! Just took it out of the oven, added a little ice cream to it, and it was SOOOO good! Thanks for the opportunity to try such a wonderful recipe! And did you check out the nutritional info?? Not near as fattening and calories as most recipes on here for cobbler! WOW!

EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the cobbler recipe I've been looking for.  The brown sugar is what sets this cobbler recipe apart from the rest.  I did make this in a smaller pan (square pyrex), and it turned out great. It's the one I remember from my childhood in all the homestyle and BBQ restaurants in Texas. Have tried other recipes and this one's by far the best. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Excellent recipe and easy to fix. The brown sugar gives it a slightly distinct taste and color (a shade darker) to set it apart from your standard peach cobbler recipe. Highly recommended.

Delicious. I used confectioners sugar because I didn't realize we were out of regular sugar til it was too late, I also added a smidge of cinnamon to the batter and loosely drained my peaches as some other people recommended. This was more of a cake with peaches on top of it but none the less, it was fantastic. A KEEPER!

Wonderful flavor! I used four 15-ounce cans of natural peaches because I wanted a little more fruit. I thought the cobbler part (my very fvorite part) had good texture and flavor. Making it next time, I would probably half the recipe and make it in a 9x9 pan in order for the cobbler to cook more evenly.

I did not like this recipe. My only dislikes were that the flavor of the cobbler wasn't varied enough (throw in some berries, then it will be fine) and that the crust was very soft and cakey. I prefer a flakier, biscuit-y crust. All in all, if you prefer a flaky crust, choose a different recipe.

The pressure was on.  My father-in-law put in a request for some peach cobbler similar to one he had tasted at a local restaurant.  He described it to me and after reviewing many peach cobbler recipes, I found this one.  Let me tell ya'll, it was a hit.  He loved it and so did the rest of the family.  I used fresh peaches from an orchard up the road.

Excellent, simple recipe.  To make it even more simple, I used self-rising flour and ommitted the baking powder.

Works fine in either a 9x13 or 8x8 baking dish (add about 3 minutes cook time if using 8x8).  Also, add just a bit (about 1/4 cup) of the syrup from canned peaches and drizzle it over the top before sprinkling cinnamon.
Great flavor!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe! It was so simple to make! Most of the items I already has on hand! The only changes that I made: I used an 8x8 pan (I think a 13X9 would make it too thin) also I added a bit of the peach juice and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg to the mixture before baking. I know that I will not only make this again but I plan on sharing it with family and friends! Thanks so much! YUM!

This cobbler turned out nice and had a great flavor.  I made it in the 9x13 inch pan that it called for in the recipe, but next time I will put it in an 8x8 pan.  Was really good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy to make and tastes great, especially with whipped cream. I typically prefer making more complicated cobblers with fresh fruit, but when there's barely anything left in my kitchen, this makes the perfect last-minute dessert.

I thought this tastes pretty good. It is also really quick to make. I have a favorite peach crisp recipe, but wanted to try something a little different and found this to use up a can of peaches. I was very excited when I seen a cobbler recipe at 100 calories! Then, I came to the realization that, as it only rises an inch in the pan, it is actually closer to 6 servings not 24. It is more than sweet, by itself, but it was still excellent with a small scoop of 1/2 the fat vanilla bean ice cream.

This was really yummy!  I am only deducting a star because I like a more cobbler-y crust rather than a cake-like one, but the flavor was most excellent.  I changed just a few things, some on purpose, some by accident.  On purpose, I used more fruit than the recipe called for, and I used both blueberries and FRESH peaches.  I added a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon to the fruit to get the juices going, and I decreased the baking powder by 1/2 tsp. to reduce the cakeiness. By accident, I didn't use the butter!  My brain skipped over that part when I was reading the recipe, and I did not realize my mistake until the cobbler was done.  I tasted it and, honestly, it was absolutely delicious WITHOUT ANY OF THE BUTTER!  I'll try it with the butter next time (because butter makes everything better!), but if you want a lower fat, lower cholesterol version, the taste is still magnificent without all the butter!  That should make this cobbler earn its fifth star back :)

Delicious. I used 4 fresh peaches instead of canned; And sprinkled on some fresh blueberris also. I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and brown sugar as suggested, not too much. Everything else the same. Next time i will use half blueberries, & 1/2 peaches. because the blueberries really make this.  Everyone loved it. very easy to make. i will make this again.

Great recipe! I only gave it a four star because I had to add a strussel topping to give it a bit of a crispy crust. (1 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup flour, 1tsp cinnamon, 1/2 cup butter) My husband and kids loved it. My hausband said we should try it with blueberries next time also. We topped it off with some ice cream and it was wonderful.

More like bread pudding than the cobbler my mother used to make, but my family loved it and have asked me to make it again. I was out of milk so I used evaporated milk diluted with water and it worked fine.  I also added 1/4 tsp of mace and used fresh peaches.  Vanilla ice cream is the perfect topper.

I made a double batch.  Double of the fruit and only  one batch of the cake part.  It was so easy and fast to make and the whole house smelled good while it cooked.  At the end, none was left.  I think that equals excellence.  Thanks.

This is an old taste of home.  This is the same recipe that my grandma and grandpa taught me how to make when I was a little girl.  It is a wonderful dessert when you have a large crowd to feed and only a little money.  We usually have all of the ingredients on hand, thanks for sharing the recipe.

I needed something sweet to give our new neighbors and this will definitely work! I cut down the sugar to 1/3 cup each, used butter and drizzled a little of the peach juice over the top. I did not decide to use a smaller pan till I had made the batter and realized like others that it would be a bit thin in a 9x13 so I used a stainless 8x8. Baked for same amount of time.

Very good recipe.  I used fresh peaches (7) instead of canned, and added some fresh nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon.  Additionally, since I was using the fresh peaches, I stirred some of the white sugar, along with the cinnamon and nutmeg, into the peaches before placing them over the batter.  I also used less white sugar than was called for, and it was still plenty sweet.  Yum.  I'll make again.

What a great cobbler!  It was very easy to put together. The only thing I will do differently the next time I make it is to use a smaller pan-it was a little bit thin-but it tasted yummy!!!

There are two kinds of cobbler: biscuit and crust. If you prefer crust, this recipe isn't for you. But if you prefer biscuit-style, you'll never need another cobbler recipe. This one is simple and delicious!

I used firmer, "just on the edge of becoming fully ripe" peaches so that they wouldn't get too soft and mushy during cooking. But that means I had to add 1 tsp sugar with the tsp of cinnamon when I coated them. 

Also, I put the peaches in the pan and poured the mix around them (rather than pouring the mix into the pan an putting the peaches on top). It worked out great.

My girl never used to like peach cobbler, but this is now one of her favorite desserts. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious peach cobbler. I followed the advice of many of the reviewers, and used 2 cans of peaches, and placed them in a lightly buttered 9x13 glass baking dish. I doubled the crust, and made sure to liberally sprinkle the peaches in the dish with pumpkin pie spice. For the liquid in the recipe, I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup peach syrup from the can. I could not have been happier with the results. My cobbler was done at the 45 minute mark, and I served it warm with vanilla ice cream. I will make this recipe again.

This is my go to recipe with home canned peaches.  I strain off most of the juices, but often find I have to bake this for longer than what the recipe calls for.  However, everyone always loves it.  And it's easy to make larger batches.  I recently made it for 60 people!  (And had I made more, they would have kept eating it).

Like other reviewers I melted the butter in the 9x13 glass baking dish. Added 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the dry ingredients. Used 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup syrup from the canned peaches - pour into 9x13 pan with the melted butter. Increased peaches to two 29 ounce cans. Sprinkled top with a cinnamon & sugar mixture, then baked for 42 minutes at 375. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Everyone enjoyed it.

I followed this recipe "as is" and it was delicious. I only hate I didn't have any ice cream to go with it. (I did make one mistake I put the peaches in the pan first then put the batter on top.  I have need to pay more attention to directions. Still turned out perfect.)

I baked this peach cobbler last night, took a photo after set it down to cool, went to the store & when I returned home it was all gone aside from someone's fork & crumbs. So i'll rate it a 5, and i'm making another today so I can actually try it. **UPDATE 6/18/12 - I just made this again so I could actually eat some. I added fresh blueberries with the peaches, so good!!!

This was a great cobbler. The dough/crust was a little chewy and the center didn't get done before the edges were dark. I'll be using this again, though, as hubby liked it a lot!

I made this recipe and substituted 1/2 c whole wheat flour and the other half regular flour called for and my husband who is a type 1 diabetic raved, "This is actually not too sweet!"  I have a winner on my hands as I now have a sweet treat my husband can eat and feel good about!

Hardly any "cobbler" to it.  Plus it seemed "spoungy."  Kinda disappointed so I'll keep looking for another peach cobbler recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly and my husband loved it. I on the other hand didn't care for it. It was too gooshie. Also, it needed extra sugar & cinnamon sprinkled on the top because I felt it was too bland. Maybe vanilla ice cream also would have helped.

This recipe was incredible. I used the last 2 jars of my homemade canned peaches. I wouldn't change a thing. In fact I plan to use this same recipe for an apple cobbler at Thanksgiving with some added seasoning.

Made it almost as directed.  The only thing I changed was sprinkling a cinnamon/sugar mix on top instead of cinnamon alone.  This gave it a slightly crispiness on top.  
Will make again, but will reduce the heat and grease the pan first as mine stuck.
Otherwise it's delicious!

Very good though I felt it had just a bit too much cinnamon. My family enjoyed this recipe served warm with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream!

This cobbler was too dry for my liking. Next time I will melt some butter in the bottom of the pan before pouring in the batter. I will also drizzle a small amount of melted butter and syrup from the peaches on top before sprinkling cinnamon, sugar, and nutmeg on top. Has a good flavor, it just needs to be doctored up a bit!

Made this for dessert last night and there is only one piece left! It was soooo good. I plan to make this recipe with other fruit. The only alterations I made was using fresh peaches and added a little brown sugar to the top of the peaches with the cinnamon. Of course we ate it with vanilla ice cream. :D

I only had a small can of peaches, so I added a cup of dried cherries to it. I baked in a 8' round cake pan. It was fabulous!

Making it a second time with 3 cups of fresh peaches that I cooked with a cup blueberries with some sugar and 1 Tablespoon cornstarch. I had so much fruit that I had to double the topping recipe (which BTW is divine) I got it all into the 9x12 this time and it is cooking now. I cannot wait for it to be done, as this is one of the simplest, yet best (and I come from the South originally). It is so good, I might let the kids have it for breakfast! :)

BEST COBBLER EVER!!! I love when the cobbler is more cakey than flakey and this one is just perfect. My husband, who doesn't like cobbler, even loved it. Made this for Easter dessert with a little vanilla ice cream and there was none left.

Tastes amazing, just takes longer in the oven than stated. The dough almost seems underbaked, but it tastes amazing like that!

I made this with fresh peaches from the farmer's market.  I added 1/4 c. sugar to the peaches and added the cinnamon to the peach mixtue instead of on top.  I also put the peaches on the bottom and jostled the whole mixture around a bit to have some peaches on top some on bottom.  This was so delicious and not too sweet.

Delicious!  It wasn't what I expected, but I was pleasently surprised with the crisp outside and the chewy inside of the crust.  The vanilla really added a lot of flavor!  I was short on peached, so I used half peaches, half apples, and it was great!  A good thing to make with all this summer prouce!

A great, easy cobbler!  I actually like the softer texture of the cobbler but my topping was a bit crispy on top, which was perfect!    I tweaked this recipe by using real butter.  I also substituted the canned peach juice for the milk.  Why waste it?  I took the advice of P4C and added an additional 1/4 c. flour to the original recipe, for more batter.  I also increased the peach juice by 1/4 cup, and in this way, used nearly all the juice contents in the can.  Yum!

I did everything the same except I used butter rather than margarine. This was fantastic. So so quick to prepare, and it came out looking gorgeous. I arranged the canned peaches on their sides in two rows and it looked lovely. What an easy dessert to make, with ingredients most people normally have in the house already.
It was a big hit with my boyfriend and I will make it again soon.
I did remove the leftovers from the baking dish to put it in a Tupperware container overnight so that it didn't dry out.
Thanks so much!

I always wondered if using canned fruit in cobbler would be okay in a pinch and now I have my answer. Didn't care for this recipe at all. Without the fresh fruit it seems like a waste of ingredients and time. Very tasteless with odd texture, like a pile of soft goo. I will make the trip to the store for some fresh fruit next time. The recipe would probably be okay minus canned fruit, ick.

Sorry, really didn't like the texture of this one.  I'm from the South and prefer the more cake like/even a bit crunchier texture - more like a cross between cobbler and crisp.  This was very "puddingy" - The peaches self-destructed and it was just kind of gooey.  I added a couple Tbsp. of sugar on top for a hopeful crunch but it didn't happen.  Sorry.

Very good! Used fresh nectarines and strawberries from my garden. Melted the butter in the 9x13 baking dish..in the oven, then added it to the flour mixture...when it was ready to put in the oven..I sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top....baked twice the amount of time this called for. Oh and I didn't have any milk - so I used 1/2 and 1/2

This is an outstanding example of perfection through simplicity!  EASY!!!!!  It comes out perfect every time.  I add 1 (tbs) of Black Strap Molasses…and my family just goes crazy over it.  It also helps the sugars to caramelize on top when it is done...and makes for a beautiful presentation.  It also helps to balance all the flavors.  I lay out all the large peach slices evenly in the pan….then I cut up the rest of my peaches into small chunks and evenly sprinkle them over the entire pan.  When the mixture rises it blends very well…and it is even throughout. If you are a Foodie…you will love it!

I substituted sugar with Splenda (brown and white) and found it to work very well. Also recommend a 8X8 pan and bake a little longer, maybe, 10 minutes. I'll use this recipe again.

I served this cobbler to company, and everybody loved it!  The reason I  gave it 4 stars was because I did make some changes.  I only put half of the sugar and it was plenty sweet for everyone.  I also added 1/2 tsp almond extract and a sprinkle of nutmeg.  Thanks for the recipe!

I cooked two of these and followed recipe exactly.......One I baked in a 13x9 pan was very dry and just ok...but the other I baked in an oval shaped bowl type dish and it was good. My husband loves peach cobbler and he liked it, so if you make this go with a deeper smaller dish and it will be better.

I too mixed brown sugar with the cinnamon and sprinkled on top - then I sprinkled a little more brown sugar.  It makes for a really good sugar crystal topping!

Two other changes I have made to this recipe: double the amount of vanilla (I use Adam's Best - you can buy online - or Mexican vanilla) and substitute 1c ZaXBisquick for the flour, baking powder and salt.  It makes it a little more doughy.

This recipe turned out pretty good, except I should have read the other reviews that say GREASE THE PAN!!!!  Big mistake.  I am currently living in the south of Chile and I wanted to make a desert for my host family using ingredients in their pantry, well they had all of this!!  Pretty convenient recipe.  Also, I had to bake it about 20 minutes longer than it said.

I agree it is more like bread pudding as the crust is "cakey".  But my husband who LOVES bread pudding raved about it.  I personally like a more traditional cobbler, but this was quick and easy!

Wow, this is wonderful!  If you prefer a more bread-like than pie-crust like cobbler, you MUST try this!  Still moist & delicious!  My husband adores this.  The ONLY change I made was to add a bit of ground mace to the batter & I only used part of the cinnamon.  Incredible!  I'm replacing my old standby Fannie Farmer cobbler recipe with this one for our household.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

This was ok.  If you are trying to put something together fast and don't have the time or much money to spend on something that would really "Wow", I would recommend it.   Otherwise you'd do better to pass on it.

Thank you! We made another cobbler and it turned out awful, so I ran to my computer, found this recipe and it saved the day! It is really good warmed with vanilla ice cream!

Great easy recipe. Next time I will make it in a smaller pan so it will be a little more thick...and perhaps use a little less butter.

We loved this recipe.  I had some frozen peaches and mangos in the freezer that I wanted to use up...it was great.  The batter makes it wonderful!

Wonderful!!  I used 7 fresh peaches and substituted Splenda Brown and White sugar blends.  I also added a sprinkling of nutmeg on the peaches.  We loved it!!  I will definitely be making this again.

Wow!  Talk about an easy and delicious cobbler!  I made this for dessert with a fried chicken dinner, there wasn't a single piece left at the end of the meal.  There were only 5 of us!  Thanks Karen!

This is a great recipe to warm up the house with!  I had all the ingredients on hand and it was a breeze to put together.  I'm looking forward to serving it for saturday breakfast tomorrow too.  A great version of peach cobbler.  I did follow the advice of others and baked it in a smaller pan.  It turned out great!

I think the ingredient for the batter should be doubled if you're using a 9x13 pan.  Also i think the time should have been 20 min. because at 25 min. the edges were already burned.  The taste wuz ok, i didn't add the brown sugar and i'm glad i didn't cuz it already tasted sweet with a bit of the peach juice.  Next time i'm going to add an egg and double the batter ingredients (excluding the brown sugar).

I followed the ingredients/directions to a T, but used an 8x8 glass dish (cooked at 350 for 45 min due to pan adjustment). A bit "cakey" for my taste, but a good flavor. Next time I think I'll add the juice, as suggested in previous reviews.

Very quick and easy. I reserved half the peach juice and poured it over the top before adding the cinnamon. The only problem I had was that I think this dessert would be better if made in an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13 because as it is, there was not enough peaches - even when using a 29 oz can, and the crust/cobbler part was really thin. I might make this again if I baked it in an 8x8 pan.

What a yummy desert! And fast too!  I had made dinner, but didn't quite make enough to fill us up so tonight was the perfect time to test this recipe. I used butter instead of margarine though because it was all we had and added just enough to make the batter look smooth. I also didn't quite keep it in the oven for the full 30 minutes. I took it out when the edges browned and so the inside had the texture of a warm muffin almost. Fantastic with a tall glass of milk!!

Took this to a casual dinner party and it was easy to make and delicious.  I used 6 fresh peaches, sweetened them a little to get the juices flowing, and topped the finished cobbler with a little whipped cream.  Everyone complimented me and couldn't have been simpler.  Thank you.

This is my reading for all recipes. This is not the first recipe I have messed up on because the directions do not include the amounts of ingredients. When using a phone or mobile device it's very frustrating having to scroll up and down between ingredient amount and recipe.

I have been making this cobbler for the last 40 years.  It is also known as Air Force peach cobbler.  I melt the 1 stick of butter in the pan then pour the batter over butter, , do not mix,  then pour 2 15 oz cans of peaches over the batter, i drain a third can of peaches and add it to the first two.  Delish!  Serve with whip cream or ice cream.  I always get raves on this dessert.

Absolutely delicious! This was my first time making cobbler & it turned out to be really quick & easy! The cobbler rose & browned perfectly around the peaches. I added a bit more brown sugar because most cobblers I taste I feel that the "bread" part should be more sweet. Perfectt 10!

Yummmmmm, that's what people around the table said. Followed other reviews and used light cream instead milk, added some of the juice, and sprinkled some brown sugar on it after it had been I the oven for ten minutes. Baked at 375 for 30 mins, then 400 for ten. Also used slightly less cream to account for the juice. Upped the liquid level overall. Absolutely delicious!

This went over great at card club. I used butter instead of margarine. Next time I want to try almond flavoring in the batter. Super quick to mix up. I laid the peaches all pretty around in a fan which was a waste of time as the batter bubbled over the peaches and drowned them. It looked fine but not as pretty as it went in the oven.

It was a very delicious cobbler. I modified the recipe and added 1/2 cup of oats + 1/4 cup extra of milk to the mix. I then did not drain the peaches and put them in first, followed with the mixture. I cooked it for 35 minutes and it was perfect!

I have tried several different versions of peach cobbler.  I did this one last night because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was by far the best tasting yet and pretty easy.  I'm definitely putting this one in the permanent recipe box!  I always top my warm cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Great.  My DH deemed this dessert really good and my children liked it too.  I added more cinnamon, as recommended and a wee sprinkle of brown sugar on the top, over the peaches.  I will keep a can of sliced peaches on hand to make this dessert when I need something nice in a hurry - I will have the rest of the ingredients on hand anyway. Keeper

This was a very good, fast, easy recipe. I didn't have enough white sugar so I used 3/4 cup brown and 1/4 white.  I also used fresh peaches. I used enough peaches to completely make the batter underneath disappear. I let them stay moist with water from washing them off (after peeling them) because I didn't have any canned peach syrup that the original recipe would have included. It was so easy to make and really tasted great. I served it with organic vanilla ice cream and heard lots of "yummms" as my family ate their cobblers. The only change I would make is to add a crumb top for a little bit of crunch, which I think would improve the mouth-feel. Thank you for sharing!

Very good!!! I love the more cakey type of batter this made. The biggest plus about this recipe is that it is so easy to make!

I prefer cobbler crust that's a texture mix between pie crust and dumplings, and this wasn't either. It turned out more like a cake/biscuit with gooey bottom texture, which is not what I was looking for.

Doubled the batter recipe, used the better part of a 6 lb. can of peaches I got a good deal on. A good 4 lbs of peaches, cut them into large chunks. Baked for a longer amount of time because I doubled recipe. Almost an hour at 350 til toothpick came out clean. Came out very, very golden and tasted awesome! Took it to family Easter, almost all went! I will definitely use this recipe again, great flavor and so easy! Thanks, Karen !!

This was so delicious!  The only modifications I made were healthy substitutions - I used Splenda's version for the brown sugar, white sugar, and peaches, and then used Smart Balance butter rather than margarine.  It came out fantastic!  Even my husband and children gobbled it up.  So nice to have found this to satisfy my sweet tooth, but still stay on track with my diet!

Mm mm mm! I had no idea what peach cobbler was when I came across this recipe.  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I am impressed. It's quick and easy and very tasty.  My mom and sisters and I can peaches every year, and I was looking for a way to enjoy them besides eating them cold (way to cold here in Ontario for that this winter). I will be sharing this recipe with my family over Christmas.

I made this last night and it turned out pretty darn good.  Next time I make it I will add some of the juice from the can into it instead of draining it all. I baked it in a 2qt dish and fit perfectly.

I LOVED this cobbler! I made it for a block club meeting at my apartment complex and in 15 minutes it was gone. I added nutmeg and a little of the syrup the peaches came when I put the peaches on top. I also added about a cup of brown sugar and half a stick of unsalted butter. It was great!

I make this receipe but do not add the butter to the dry/wet ingredients.  Add your milk to your dry ingredients but do not add the butter.  Instead, melt your butter in a deep dish, (microwave is best) then pour your milk mixture into butter, DO NOT MIX.  Then add your peaches and that is it.  You also might want to add your brown sugar on top along with your cinnamon.  The milk and butter mixture covers the peaches while baking.  A scoup of ice cream is the best way to serve this for people who don't like all the butter and sugar.

Recently made this recipe.  Made the changes suggested regarding adding cinnamon topping and 1/2 c more of milk and flour for more crust.  Loved this recipe and was all gone in one seating.  It is just what a cobbler should be  (not a crisp) with the sweet peaches and wonderful, thickish crust.  I used fresh peaches, which I think added to the flavor and were firmer then canned.   Will definately use this one again.

Good peach cobbler. Easy to make. I have made it 3 times and will make it again. I did add cinnamon to the top of the cobbler and really liked that addition.

This was okay.  My huband loves cobbler and he didn't comment on this recipe at all.  I think it would have been better if I used fresh peaches vs. canned.  Also, this didn't really have a crust, it was more like peaches in a moist cake.  It was good but not the best.

I thought this was really good but I will bake it in a smaller pan next time. When baked in the 9x13 it came out about an inch high. I want mine a little thicker so will use an 8 inch pan next time.

We loved this recipe!!! I made it for my mother and granny and they even approved.  I made it with fresh peaches and added sugar to make the juice.  I also mixed the cinnamon into the mixture.  I put the peaches with the juice in bottom of pan and poured mixture on top.  It might just be my oven but 350 worked better for me.  We will be making this again!!!!!!!!!!!

I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and sprinkled some brown sugar along with the cinnamon on top and drizzeled a bit of the heavy syrup from the peaches on top too (just a bit). It's not the traditional peach cobbler I think of- maybe I am thinking more of a dumpling type thing- but it is very tasty and easy. I might try it in a smaller dish next time to see if the bready part come out differently. I liked it very much as is though! Served it with some peach ice cream. Yummy!

This is the first peach cobbler I have ever made and I thought it was fantastic.  BUT.. I am not a peach cobbler fan, crazy, because I am from south MS.  My husband who LOVES peach cobbler ate it up.  The only thing was that he said it was more "bready" than peach cobbler he is used to.  And I agreed, it has a bready feel to it.  But I guess that is how I like it!  Will make again.

Living in the South for a couple of years I loved eating cobbler.  Of all the cobblers I found this is pretty dang close to what some of those grandmas made. I highly recommend it.

This was more like cake with peaches than what I think of for cobbler, if cake-cobbler is what you're looking for go for it. I ate the peaches out of it, but my husband liked the cake part so it worked out for a one time. Our guests were not "wowed."

Very good.  I did double the peaches as to me that is the best part.  Cake texture which is the best to me.  Sweet enough and very quick and easy to make.  I will make this again and again.

This was delicious. Had some canned peaches I wanted to use up, and this was a great way to do it. Very sweet and flavorful. Even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I gave it 4 stars because it was good as written.  However, I think it would be better if the amount of peaches were doubled, the peaches were added to the pan FIRST (I did this when I tried the recipe), and 1 c of peach liquid is added to peaches.  It was a little to cake-like for me.

Like everyone says, it is cake-like, so if you prefer a crusty cobbler, this may not be for you. The crust is just enough to cover the peaches.

Very good dessert. However, I'd cut back on the sugar a bit. I found it a bit too sweet for my taste. My son on the other hand loved it as is.

So, I did not follow this recipe exactly.  I used frozen(from fresh) peaches, a fresh mango, and a sauteed(in butter, cinnamon, and sugar) apple as my fruit.  I also used 1/2 cup coconut milk and 1/4 cup regular milk for the batter, which made it so rich and flavorful.  I also only added 1/4 cup of each sugar and sprinkled some brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg on the top.  Warmed oven to 400, then dropped to 350 when I put it in.  Took about 40 mins and was so delicious!

This ended up being an amazing and super quick recipe! I halved the the serving size cause I was only making it for two people. Which worked fine. Also I used a tiny bit of nutmeg and took others' advice using a little brown sugar on top. Super tasty. *EDITED* I used this recipe again just fooling around and used a can of blueberry pie mix. It did not turn out anywhere near the peach one did. I think I will leave this awesome recipe to peaches.

This is a great recipe. I agree with the other the recipe should be doubled to add more of the cobbler. I placed the peaches in the pan before I added the batter. I saved the juice from the canned peaches and I reduced it to about 1/4 the original amount, once the cobbler was done I removed it from the oven and drizzled the reduce peach juice on top, let it sit for a bit and later served it with cool whip. This was awesome.....quick and easy.....Thank you!

This was very tasty and made an elegant dessert when prepared in an attractive pie dish for serving. I tossed the peaches with cinnamon/brown sugar and put some on the bottom of the plate, saving some for the top of the batter. Yummy warm with vanilla ice cream.

My first time ever making peach cobbler I made this for 200 people. It was such a huge success I constantly have people asking for the recipe. The only change I made was to add some frozen peaches to the canned ones. It made a nice texture balance.

It was very good! The thing was it all gooshed together. The cake and peaches were like one thing. It was also very brown in color, is supposed to be like that? I served it with ice cream and a little more fresh peaches. Very good, wrong texture.

I made this recipe while camping. I used my cast iron dutch oven, and doubled the recipe. Baked it in the camper stove for what seemed like an eternity. The stove usually burns everything, so I turned the heat lower.
Instead of the peaches & spices, I used the 'Freezer Peach Pie filling' recipe I had made from here. Since I adjusted the recipe, I pulled the cobbler out of the oven when it was no longer jiggly on the top & middle. It was moist and perfectly cooked. Since I have never had or made peach cobbler, I didn't know what to expect. Everyone loved it. Thanks

OMG! This is yummy!  I used cake flour (I was out of all purpose flour) and added frozen blueberries and it turned out great! Even my 11 y/o daughter loved it and we both had seconds!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  The recipe says 24 servings.  It's more like 9-12?

This was nothing like I hoped it would be. The dough was just not right. If you are looking for a delicious southern peach cobbler, I would pass on this one. It is an ok recipe; just not real sweet or rich like my mom's cobbler.

I made this recipe and used self rising flour and omitted the baking soda and salt. Instead of putting the butter in the batter I melted it in the dish and poured the batter into the butter. Gave it a nice crust that did not stick. Also used a little less cinnamon than the recipe calls for. Incresed milk and flour by 1/4 cup. Good recipe with these variations.

Thank you!  This is an easy, quintessential Southern style cobbler.  Perfect for dessert after Sunday fried chicken! The only modification I made was to use buttermilk instead of sweet milk.  This is a keeper.

sooooo yummy... but as someone else said- grease the pan!!!  that step seems to be missing and I'm chiseling out the yummy goodness now because I don't want to just soak it off and waste it. :)

I made this last night and it was fast and easy. As some others suggested I used a 9x9 dish and it turned out great. It was delicious. Great with coffee in the morning as well!

Unbelievably easy!  This is a great treat to whip up when you want something delicious without much hassle.  I used a 9x9 pan and baked for 45 minutes (which I would recommend, because otherwise your cobbler will be very flat), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfect.

Really good recipe! I've made this cobbler many times now - several of which have been for company. Each time I make it, it gets gobbled up and I often get asked for the recipe! You really can't go wrong with this one, especially if you're looking for something quick and easy. Goes great with a little good-quality vanilla ice cream and chopped hazelnuts or walnuts. My husband also gives this 5 stars. Thanks!

I loved this recipe!  It was my first attempt at a cobbler (and my first time eating one, too), and it turned out wonderfully.  I used the full can of peaches (conserving half of the juice), and about two cups of fresh cranberries.  I served it hot with vanilla ice cream.  Thank you, I'll definitely be making this one again!

I made this recipe twice because the first time I accidentally used Allspice instead of Cinnamon.  But, it came out too cake-like for our tastes, so I cut the flour by 1/4 c the next time I made it (with the proper amount of Cinnamon instead of Allspice) and it came out very well.  I also soaked the peach slices in rum to add a little "punch".

Thanks so much for sharing.  I am from the east coast orginally, and this is just the way I remember my mom's cobbler!  Followed everything exactly.  I used 4 fresh, yellow cling peaches.  I also cooked the cobbler for 45 minutes.  It was perfect and yummy! Was very peachy!

I've made another "quick" version of this recipe, but I am so glad I came across this one. It is super easy. The addition of brown sugar and butter to this recipe gives it a caramel flavor that goes so well with the peaches. The edges of the cobbler are crispy, but not tough. I'll be making this one from now on!
I made it exactly as printed, so delicious.

This is a GREAT, easy, and delicious cobbler!! I used 5 fresh Palisades, Colorado peaches, which I had gotten in a large box from The Shriners, and these peaches were stunningly delicious!  I used butter instead of marjarine, which I haven't used, or even purchased, in 30 years! I also used a little less white sugar, and mixed some large cut turbinado sugar with the cinnamon, and sprinkled the mix over the top as last step before baking. The whole pan is already gone!! It never had a chance!! I will make this over, and over!! It is almost too good warm, with vanilla bean ice cream on top!

I doubled the bready topping part because I like to have enough bread to go with the juicy fruit. I thought it was a little too sweet. But everyone loved it topped with whipped cream.

Very good. I used 4 cups of fresh peaches, and this took an extra 20 minutes to bake. It still turned out well and tasted very good. I'd like to make this again.

I will definately make this again. Instead of putting the peaches on top, I  sprinkled them with cinnamon and put them on the bottom. I took 1/4 cup of brown sugar and mixed it with 1/4 cup of the drained peach juice. I added 1/4 jar of marachino cheeries  and poured it over the peaches. I also added an extra 1/4 cup of flour to the cake mix and 3 tablespoons of the peach juice. This made a moist cake with extra syrup to spoon over. My husband called it his cherry peach right side up cake.

This recipe has been a quick go-to at our house for a number of years, now, and I'm just getting around to rating it.  I prepare it as-written except for using butter (Wisconsin no-no to use margarine) and the results are always sweet, rich,  reliable goodness with a chewy/gooey bite that is to die for - best served warm or re-heated with a little vanilla ice cream.

Great, simple recipe!  The only tiny change I made was to melt the butter in the dish as the oven was preheating, then stirred it in with the other ingredients.  Thanks so much for sharing this awesome recipe!

I would definitely make it again.  Mom and I loved it.  My only alteration was half and half rather than milk. I happened to be at Aldi's and had this recipe in my head.  Low and behold they had the best Georgia peaches and gorgeous blackberries. Thank you, Karen! PS I am no baker, but this turned out great.

Great flavor!  Wouldn’t change anything.  Here on the west coast, we grew up with crisps more than cobblers, so a new perspective on what we can do with our fresh peaches is always nice.

Took others advice and this was the perfect homecoming for our Southern friend returning from active duty! I put just a few tablespoons of the melted butter in the pan, sliced the canned peaches into thinner slices and put 3/4 on top of the butter, then spread the batter on top. Topped with the remaining peaches then sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top. Rave review from all including myself who is a crips lover!

For fresh peaches you should simmer them up in a tablespoon or two of water before adding to the batter. This will avoid the dry look of the peaches when baked.
Everyone at home loved it warm right out of the oven. We added some vanilla ice cream and enjoyed!!!

This was very good, kind of like a peachy cake. Sounds like it would be very good with other kinds of fruit as well. I did end up pouring the batter over the peaches, since I'm used to the traditional cobbler. I'm kind of glad I did because the cake needed additional time to cook and I wouldn't have been able to see it was doughy if it had been on the bottom. Sweet!

This is a great recipe that I will personally be making again, the only change I really made was to bake it for 20 more minutes as it was jiggling like unset jello when I pulled it out at the 30 minute mark. Overall a nice recipe that isn't too much of a hassle.

I used 7 fresh peaches and it turned out great. I had people scraping the dish. I have varied the sugar every time I've made this recipe, and personally I prefer a brown to white ratio of 1:3. Using all white sugar was the least successful variant. As is, this recipe serves 4.

I made this just as it's written.  The flavors work very well together so it is a tasty dessert.  For us it was too much cobbler and not enough peaches.  It was sort of dry and we'd have preferred having more peaches with more of a pie filling consistency.  So, although it tasted good, I will probably not make this recipe again.

Very EASY recipe. Did everything according to recipe but substituted 4 cups of fresh peaches for the canned, and had to increase cooking time by 10 minutes.  Very close to what my Granny used to make. It's heavenly with some Redi-whip and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
My tip for checking doneness: reach in and give the pan a shake. If it moves like pudding in the center then it's not done. Keep checking every 5 minutes until it has a more soft-cake like consistancy.

The cobbler was very soggy and was not as  crisp as I'd hoped.  I was just a bit  disappointed.  Neither my husband nor Me prefer to try  this one again.

This was sooo good! Actually I just finished a bowl of this with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top! The cobbler was still warm out of the oven. Reading the reviews, I too put some of the light syrup in the batter (I drained the rest in the sink), and added nutmeg along with the cinnamon sprinkled on top. I did bake mine for about 35 minutes and it cooked the edges where they were chewy like carmalized  sugar, which I loved. This was so easy to pop in the over directly after dinner came out and my oven was already heated. It was ready shortly after for dessert.
This recipe is a keeper!

This cobbler is so easy to make and has a great taste.  I used fresh peaches instead of canned.  I only had four large peaches, so I halved the recipe and it turned out very good.  I used a smaller baking dish and baked it for a shorter period of time.  When  I make it again I will still use fresh peaches but will open a can of peaches and use the peach  juice in the recipe.  I think it will add to the peachy flavor of the cobbler.  I had a jar of cinnamon/sugar in the cupboard and sprinkled that on top of the cobbler before baking.  Enjoyed very much and will definitely make again.  Also will try this recipe with different fruits.

Although I love fruit, I am not a huge fan of peaches. But I have a tin of them so I found this recipe and gave it a whirl. It was a very simple recipe and the dessert was very yummy. The peaches were soft from the oven and lessened the powerful taste of peaches by adding sweetness. The cake was moist. It didn't brown fully after 40 minutes but it still was very moist and yummy. I would love to make this again!

Good cobbler, though I did make several changes. First, I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter before baking, used 3/4 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup,  used a bit more brown sugar as well, and I coated the peaches with a brown sugar/cinnamon  mixture.

This is so delicious, it should be criminal! I added a pinch more cinnamon! I love the fact that it's not a flaky crust, I can't stand flaky food. Blegh! 

this recipe is to die for. I'd rate it 10 if I could!

No changes were made, but spouse and I both think a sprinkle of raisins or chopped dates would be good. It's light and very likely a great one for weight watchers. The light sugar would make it good for diabetic addition to the menu.

Just made  this recipe today for Thanksgiving. After I mixed everything and started to pour the batter in the pan I realized it was was going to be a very small cobbler, so I repeated the steps and doubled up on the batter, peaches and cook time was 1 hour. It came out wonderfully! I will definitely use this recipe again.

Only thing I did different was add the cinnamon into the batter. The batter didn't rise over the fruit. Was sitting on top of the batter so this was kind of cake like.  And had to bake about 40 minutes. The taste was ok though, but I don't think I will make this again.

Very quick and easy, I added a hint of nutmeg and a little lemon zest to my batter. Delicious!

I cut the amount of sugar in half and it was still too sweet for me.  I also thought there was too much butter.  If I make it again I  would try it with less.  However, my family liked it the way I made it.  I did add pecans to the top for texture.  I used frozen peaches because I wanted to get rid of them.  Probably would have been better with fresh peaches.  Whoever said it was more like a bread pudding was correct.  I added cinnamon to the peaches and to the top along with a dusting of granulated sugar to the top.  I baked it in my cast iron skillet.

To me this is more like a peach cake than a cobbler, but I can't say enough good things about it!  I used a 13x9 in glass cake dish and changed the ingredients from 8 to 12 servings.  I kept cooking time at 30 min on 400 degrees.  My biggest change was to use ONLY the brown sugar.  I omitted the white sugar.  It sure was sweet enough.  We drizzled a little milk over ours for lunch, but ice cream or whipped cream would work just fine.  If I had some nuts available, I might consider adding them for texture.  The smell of the cake cooking drives you crazy with waiting.  (wink)

Loved this recipe. Easy to make. I used fresh peaches without skinning or preparing them in any way other than slicing. Baked in pie pan and it took 50 minutes. I substituted coconut milk and used all organic ingredients,  albeit the baking soda. I also used coconut oil to grease pan.

It was okay once I got it done, but not by any stretch of the imagination did it cook in 30 minutes. It took over an hour to get the batter completely cooked. The only thing I did different from the original was that I used fresh peaches, so I don't know if that affected it or not.

We made this recipe twice - both times with fresh picked peaches with a little sugar mixed in and they were delicious.  The first batch was a little runny, and didn't set up properly but we ate it anyway since there were no eggs.  The second batch we used a larger pan and put the peaches on the bottom.  Awesome recipe - will make again.  Would have 5 stars if it had a little more of the cobbler dough to it.

Delicious, semi-cake-y, but quite dense, a little cinnamon-y, rises well in the 8x8" pan.  I did have to cook for about 45 minutes to get the middle done, but just check on it about every 5 minutes after 35 of cooking.  Boyfriend loved it- and he's a peach cobbler aficionado. This was my 1st time making peach cobbler- very easy- will surely make it again! (Smells greeeat while it's baking, too!)

This was quite good. We had it for dessert served with vanilla ice cream.  We all really enjoyed it.  Thanks

I had a 14.5 oz. can of sliced peaches and a 14.5 oz. can of diced canned peaches and used instead of the 29 oz. sliced canned peaches.  In the end, it didn't seem to make any difference and the dessert was a hit at my house.  I do prefer a fresh peach cobbler, but in the winter time this is a great substitute.

Really good! I would rather use fresh peaches when they are in season but since it is winter I had to use canned. The crust or cobbler part was like sugar cookies. Kids really liked the peach cookie.

bread pudding like. It's not bad, but it's not a cobbler type crust, more like cake.

It was okay. Maybe I just don't care for cobbler topping? I would have liked it to be flakey and less cakey.

Flavor is pretty good, but didn't cook very evenly. The edges were pretty well done, and the middle was still doughy. Worked out for us, as I like doughy, and my husband likes crispy.

I am in no way a great cook but this cobbler is indeed very easy to make and is simply delicious! The only variations I made was to use fresh peaches ~(I only used 2 large ones), and about 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon stirred in the batter. Thanks for such a great recipe Karen! =)

I thought this tasted great but, as others mentioned, it was soupy.  I cooked it longer than the recommended time and it browned on top but still wasn't done all the way through.  I used two 29 oz. cans of peaches and added extra cinnamon on top of the fruit.

Pretty good and lower carb, especially if you use canned peaches with Splenda.  But the dough is a little too cakey for my husband and my taste, but the rest of the family liked it.

I guess I should have payed more attention to the reviews, because I wasn't expecting such a bread-pudding-like crust. It tasted ok, nothing special, and I thought it was too mushy. I'm going to keep looking for the perfect peach cobbler recipe.

I substituted the sugars with Splenda (white and brown) and used half the amounts. I found the base was perfectly sweet that way.

This was very good, but I found that the batter bubbled up and covered my peaches.  It was still good, though.  I used an oval casserole dish because I was afraid my 9x13 pan would be too large.  It was very crispy around the edges, and maybe a little greasy, but good taste.

I substituted the sugar for Splenda and the brown sugar for Brown Sugar Splenda, added an extra handful of flour and some cinnamon to the batter. I used 14 ounces of peaches instead of 29 (simply because I didn't have  a bigger can), but instead of halfing the recipe I just left it. Oh my goodness, SO good! I made it in an 8x8 dish and it was deep and semi-gooey goodness. :) My boyfriend and his mom both love it (as do I!). In his words "not so bad for Splenda" =D Thanks for the simple recipe idea!

tasty and surprisingly easy to make. Like some other reviewers mentioned, the crust is more like bread pudding than is a pie.But it doesn't take away from the taste, especially with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Bachelor friendly.

Crust was soupy to pour into the pan and remained soft throughout.. even after over an hour of cooking. Makes tons of "crust" mixture for the amount of peaches called for. This still had "raw" dough in the center when my guests were ready for dessert. I'm thankful someone else brought cheesecake, because this was not good enough to serve. I won't make this again and I'm sorry I wasted my peaches.

Big hit with my husband and family. Really great flavor and very quick & easy to make. I doubled the peaches, as recommended by other members. I did use peaches in heavy syrup, since some mentioned that they felt it wasn't sweet enough. I also increased the topping ingredients slightly by adding approximately 1/4 c. more of both the brown & white sugar, and approximatley 1/8 c. more flour, along with just a bit more vanilla; also used 2/3 c. of the juice with approximately 1/4 c. milk (instead of all milk). Had to bake it for an additional 1/2 hour due to doubling the peaches and the slight increase in liquid (turned the oven tempurature down to 350 for the last 1/2 hour). Turned out nice and moist, not at all dry like others mentioned. Will make this one again!

I've never made a cobbler before, but I chose this one because I had canned peaches because good sweet peaches are only available for a short part of the year here. 

I expected it to be sweeter, so I was glad that I added streusel topping as somebody else mentioned. Overall it was good, next time I'd add more brown sugar and peaches.

I loved this. It does have a thicker, bread pudding-like consistency that is delightful. I brought it over to a friend's house tonight and we all loved it. I added a little nutmeg and served it with ice cream. I don't think it matters whether you put the batter on the bottom or top of the peaches--I put mine on the bottom and it turned out wonderfully.

I love this recipe because I usually have all of the ingredients at home.  It's easy to make.  I'm not much of a cobbler person, but I really like this.

Not a traditional peach cobbler, but it turned out wonderful! I sprinkled brown sugar on peaches before I baked it. It reminds me of bread pudding.. Husband loves it! I will continue making it.

I very much liked this - I used about 6 fresh peaches, skinned and sliced thinly - put on the bottom of a 9x9 buttered dish.  I used the Bisquick in place of the flour, powder, and salt.  I put the sugar/Biquick/milk mixture on top of the peaches, baked about 5-10 minutes, then put on a topping of cinnamon sugar and brown sugar - this is almost too sweet, even for my sweet tooth - but not quite!!  The Bisquick makes it very doughy - almost goopy!!  Very yum!

Extremely tasty and simple.  As another reviewer suggested, I poured the batter over the peaches rather than the other way around as the recipe suggests.  I followed the recipe directions to the letter otherwise.  Served warm with french vanilla ice cream, this is a fast, easy, and delicious dessert.

My husband and I had a party to go to and we need to make a dessert. My husband asked if I would make a peach cobbler. I have never made a peach cobbler so I had to find a recipe. I found this one and it was a BIG HIT at the party. I only came home with enough for my children to get a small taste. They even LOVED IT! This is a keeper and I will make this again and again. I did use some of the suggestions from others. I used a 9x9 pan which I buttered and I added an additional small can peaches and I used the juices from that can. I had to bake it for an additional 15 minutes. It does have a bread pudding type feel to it, but that is what made it perfect in our book.

Very good and very easy to make.  I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top just before baking.  It took me 10 minutes longer to bake than suggested.  This one went fast with my family.

I love how it turned out - taste wise. it's just that mine was burnt at the bottom, and the middle was a little bit wet. I used an 8x8 pan. any tips on how to do it perfectly next time?

Absolutely delicious.  For those who like for "cobbler" just double the recipe.  Also, using all the juice from the can gave it a great flavor.

I thought this was great. Super easy and everyone loved it.  It was not a traditional cobbler to me but yummy none the less.  I will grease the pan next time and maybe try rasperries or some other fruit.

I tried this with strawberries, adding strawberry preserves and a little corn syrup to fresh cut berries and pouring those over the batter.  I served it with whipped cream and a fresh strawberry on the side.  Great dessert!

This recipe was so easy to make and is great to use when company is coming over. I accidentally sprinkled brown sugar on the top instead of cinnamon. Yeah, don't do that, makes it taste too sweet. Made it a second time and turned out great!

This went over very big in my house, was gone in no time! I did need to add more peaches though, about another half a can or a little over, as 1 can wasn't enough.

This was a really good, pretty quick recipe.  I followed directions exactly and the dish disappeared in no time.  My only change next time will to use more peaches, it seemed a little short on fruit.

This is a very good recipe...and very easy to just throw together.  I eliminated the cinnamon because I don't care to have cinnamon on my peaches.  It does have a more cakey texture, but it's still good!  Next time I will add twice the amount of peaches (I like to have about equal parts cobbler and peaches)...Other than that, this recipe is definitely a keeper!!

This was very tasty.  I think next time I am going to try it in a 9x9 pan instead so it has more thickness.  May rate it a 5 after I try that.

Followed others advice & used 8x8 pyrex...added nutmeg and cinnamon.  Looked fabulous, only problem was the center just didn't want to cook!  Loved the "frame" though!

I guess this is a good recipe if you're looking for a shortcut, but the bottom line is that this doesn't taste anything at all like the real deal.  If you are going to make a peach cobbler, then you should use fresh peaches.
