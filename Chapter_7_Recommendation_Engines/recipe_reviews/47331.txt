It took over an hour for the liquid to evaporate. The corn was very sweet too sweet for a vegetable dish. A waste of time and a waste of electricity to simmer this for over an hour! Won't make it again!!

I followed the directions exactly and it was over an hour before the liquid evaporated. The finished result was just an extremely sweet-flavored corn.

Not worth the effort and a waste of sugar.

Only took me about 20 minutes. The kids who don't usually care much for corn loved it. I will be making this a regular.

We always cook our corn this way.I do add butter and pepper also. I always bring it to a full boil and let it cook down till the other food is ready. I don't think my family would eat it any other way.LOL

As written I am giving this a 3. Read the reviews and if you cut the sugar in half you will have 4 stars. Add some herbs and butter and you have a 5 star.
