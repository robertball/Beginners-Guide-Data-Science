I followed this recipe exactly, with the one exception that I did not "salt to taste".  It came out perfect.  Very delicious and dusky tasting.  Served it with Spanish rice. The chili's used in the recipe are not especially hot and work very well to make this an extremely savory dish.  If you prefer a hotter dish, I would recommend using a hot chorizo sausage as opposed to a mild one.

I make my own red chili sauce a lot as I love New Mexican style cooking.  I toast the chilis first very briefly in a hot iron skillet to bring out the flavors.  It only takes 20-30 seconds on each side, but be careful not to burn them.  I also toast and grind whole cumin seeds to add to the sauce.  You can spice it up a bit too with a variety of chilis.  Add a dried chipotle chili to the mix for a smokier and more spicy sauce.  Chilis by themselves might tend to make a sauce that's somewhat bitter.  You can temper that by adding a small can of tomato sauce if you like.

This was great and very authentic tasting.  As a previous post said it has that "dusky" flavor, earthy, which is what separates real mexican food from a chalupa from taco bell.  The dried peppers are the key.  One thing I will say is make sure you really grind the peppers finely in your food processor for several minutes.  I don't think I did this enough and was left with lots of little pieces of the dried pepper skin in the sauce, which are tough and fibrous, like having slivers of crab cartalige in your crabcakes if you don't pick over the meat enough.  Also add your salt at the end to avoid oversalting if your chorizo is salty.  I took the advice of other posts and added one chipotle pepper for heat.  Really this was a great sauce as far a flavor goes.  I boned and shredded the chicken back into the sauce then served it wrapped in warm flour tortillas.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, I followed the directions almost exactly.  I did add a few extra chile de arbol pepper to make it a little more spicy.  I served it with cilantro lime rice and tortillas.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent - thanks to the other reviewers for some tips.  I toasted the chiles on a cast iron skillet.  I then separately chopped them up in a food processor before adding them to the blender.  Chorizo?  I really couldn't detect where it added a lot of flavor - not sure if I would add it the next time - or maybe add in more   Might be good with a tomato salad on the side next time.   Excellent flavor - not too difficult to make.   Will be having again!

Great sauce.  My first attempt using dried chiles.  The sauce is so good that I think I'm going to skip the chicken next time and just pour it over roasted veggies and rice.  Will cook it for the hour first so it will thicken.  Thanks for sharing.

Superb and easy, too!  I subbed a can of diced tomato and boneless skinless chicken breasts, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was so delicious, I can't wait to share it!

I would add only 1/4 lb of chorizo because 1 lb made the sauce too thick for my taste, but awesome recipe anyways. My husband loved it as is! Thanks MexicoKarin, I needed a new chorizo recipe!

We really didn't care for this.  I had high hopes but it just was not suited to our tastes.  The sauce was not spicy at all, but the flavour just tasted too much like the dried peppers.

Had trouble finding the guajillo chiles, had to substitute with California chilies. Not sure if that makes a lot of difference with the taste.  I was expecting more flavor from this recipe as well, but it had a good flavor with the addition of more  salt. Did like how the chicken fell off the bone though.

Great!  I used a few different chili (passia, californian ect.)  Only because I don't like the guajillo chili too much

Very good, very hot and full of rich flavor. This took a minute to cook, but it was well worth it. Tasted awesome.

Great recipe! I didn't add the chorizo tho. I used debonded chicken thighs! I used a little Chef Merito Chicken Seasoning on the chicken and put the chicken on at sheet pan for 20 min at 500 degrees in the oven. Chicken came out nice and crispy. So for the sause I used a sifter and the sause was smooth as butter. Use a little of the chicken broth to help when you are sifting the sause and good luck!

This was truely great! I didn't locate any dried chillies in my grocery store as i suspected, so i used 4oz. jalepenos diced and 4oz. green chillies diced instead. Also a large 28 oz. can of Tuttorosso peeled plum shaped tomatoes (excluding about 1-2 at the bottom) instead of the Romas, and it all came together so wonderfully while also cutting some of my cook time down!:)I had a full young chicken which i seperated up and browned in the side cooker instead of having so many skillets and pots on the stove top. I transferred everything back over into that cooker in the end. DELICIOUS! perfect spice for everyone, since i'm known for loving the hot stuff but my man can't take that much of it. My father ended up trying some and stealing the whole container of leftovers! :)

This was amazing.  I used canned diced tomatoes but other than that followed the recipe and we both loved it!  Thanks so much for sharing this one!

Had a delicious flavor with the addition of chorizo.
I garnished with chopped green onions, cilantro and avocado, and served over rice.

This is a very good one.  I covered mine and the sauce was too thin.  Next time I wont cover it. It was even better the next day as leftovers.
I found the sauce hot but it didn't linger in the mouth.

Dont you just love when you dont expect a dish to be THAT GOOD...and yet it ends up being THAT GOOD?  That was exactly my experience.  
I had some leftover ancho and guajillo chiles from making asado de puerco which made my husband happy but me...not so much.  I think this recipe made me happy because of the chorizo.  I had it cooking in my slow cooker and the meat was falling off the bone.  Delicious!  Thank you for this recipe MexicoKaren!

This was so fun to make, and had a really authentic flavor!  Did not deviate from the recipe at all.  Made great tacos the next day!!
