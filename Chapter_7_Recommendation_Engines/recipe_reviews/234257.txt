This recipe turned out very flavorful; I liked the addition of cumin in it. I did take some liberty in tweaking. First, I used ground turkey instead of chicken, which I think is an acceptable replacement. I didn't want these to be as "bready" as the recipe calls for, so I only used 2 pieces of bread and 1/3 c of oats.  I cut the celery seed in half just because of personal preference, and I added a good shake of garlic powder and black pepper. I made 4 large patties and cooked them on my George Foreman grill. They came out perfectly, and everyone gobbled them up for dinner! :) I made these in remembrance of our dear Cheerios--we will miss his creativity on this website!

These were very good! I thought they'd be too dry but they were not. I had a few slices of "everything" bread that I had to use up and it worked well in this recipe.  I made slider-sized burgers and placed on  Hawaiian sweet rolls. We enjoyed them. Thank you to Cheerios for submitting another unique recipe. I wish I had made these much sooner. RIP my AR friend. You are missed.
