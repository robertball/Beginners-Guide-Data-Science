This was very good and makes a great side dish to any grilled meal!  After reading all the other reviews, here's what I did:  Prepare the foil sheets and dot with butter BEFORE putting the veggies inside (prevents burning and sticking); slice the potatoes and onion and mix together in a large bowl with olive oil, salt and pepper (careful of the pepper, I found that 1 tsp. was a bit too much); wrap it up tight, flatten it out and leave it on the grill for 30 minutes, turning halfway.  It came out perfect!  Thank you, Bob!

Don't let the simplicity of this recipe throw you off! We absolutely love to grill our vegetables. My Suggestions: Use olive oil instead of butter, because it is healthier and adds a great flavor to the veggies. Add some cloves (or in our case, a whole bulb!) of garlic for added flavor. Don't worry about a pungent flavor; cooked garlic mellows beautifully. Add some fresh (or dried) herbs, such as *basil*, parsley, or dill. Salt and pepper to taste. Also, add other veggies. Don't be afraid to experiment! Grilled zucchini, carrots, and mushrooms are all wonderful. You really don't have to measure, just use as many veggies as you would like. This recipe, as is, is an excellent starting point for us veggie-lovers (such as me!!!)

Simple, but great recipe.  You absolutely must use the red onions as they turn out sweet with an amazing texture that compliments the potatoes.  I quartered my onion and seperated the pieces.  Also I always add a sprinkling of celery salt and cayenne to potatoes of this style (a flavor must).  And of course added 2 whole cloves of garlic.  Also, like others I tossed the potatoes, onions and spices in a little olive oil before putting on foil, also lightly coated with oil.   No sticking and the potatoes were perfectly tender after 30 minutes on med heat.  YUM!

My parents always made these when I was a little girl and now my grown children make these "Spuds," as they've grown to call them, too! They have come to be a sentimental favorite in our family! We always make them in one, large foil packet or sometimes in a disposable foil tin. Dill and garlic salt are our favorite and tradional additions, and sometimes I like to add a little bacon grease. If you let the potatoes cook long enough before stirring, they will get all nice and crispy, much like hash browns,and everyone seems to want to dive into those crispy parts first!

This is a good recipe.  I rubbed the foil with olive oil before adding the potatoes.  I also added garlic powder for extra flavor.  Spray a little mist of water on the potatoes to help keep them moist.

Sensational!  We grilled these as a side to our steak, along with some asparagus w/roasted garlic.  DH tried them and all he could say was "Phenomenal!"  I made 2 changes:tossed the yukon golds and red onions in EVOO instead of adding butter, and used seasoning salt instead of regular salt. Wow! I used a mandolin to slice them consistantly, and they were cooked to perfection at exactly 30 minutes.  I will DEFINITELY be making these again. Thanks so much, OP!

Very easy to prepare.  I like to add fresh herbs, and lemon juice to the mixture too for more flavor.  You can even add garlic for some kick. I have also used olive oil instead of butter with good results.

Very good and a nice change from having plain old baked potatoes. I sprayed the foil with cooking spray and used Parkay spray butter on top of the potatoes instead of butter.  This not only cut the fat, but kept my taters from sticking! I also used a regular onion instead of a red onion. Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, pretty darn good!  Actually, even though I made them with dinner, they remind me of the hearty breakfast potatoes my dad would cook when we went camping when I was little. Easy to prepare ahead of time, then toss on the grill for awhile before starting the meat.

Sorry...the red onions ruined this recipe for me. I think red onions should be reserved for fresh recipes, not cooked. I didn't enjoy the taste. However, I tried this recipe again, last night, using yellow onions and I added fresh mushrooms. Huge improvement and much more to my liking.

These are a great side dish for steak.  I spray my foil packet with Pam so nothing sticks and partially microwave the potatoes to cut down on the cooking time.  I never really measure anything - a little melted butter and a little olive oil plus a mixture of garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  You can't go wrong with these......

we've been making these for years. Try adding some thickly sliced sharp or xtra sharp cheese to the foil packs..the 'burnt' on stuff is the best! Spray with nonstick spray before grilling so you can get every bite!

So quick, easy and yummy! Followed the recipe with the exception of adding a few shakes of garlic powder and doubling the recipe for our crowd. Because of the larger amount being grilled, we used an aluminum pan and covered with foil.  Cooked in exactly 30 min. Served with Grilled Mushroom Swiss Burgers and Grilled Corn. Excellent meal. Thanks for sharing!

These are so easy and taste great.  I will sometimes add a little rosemary to dress them up.

Last night, we grilled ribs, and this was the perfect compliment!! 
This was a very, very, easy dish to prepare. I followed the recipes exactly but I did the following, and this dish was simple unbelievable!! 1. Instead of white potatoes, I used red potatoes 2. I quarterd the potatoes, and then halved the quarters so that the potatoes would cook very well. 3. I drizzled olive oil over the vegetables in addition to the butter. 4. I sprinkled garlic powder, and rosemary in addition to the salt and pepper. 6. I baked the foil packages in the oven at 375* for 1 hour-- just to ensure that my potatoes were perfectly done. In the end, I had a delicious side dish, and I was very impressed. Thank you, Mr Cody!!

This recipe was good but needed way more butter (maybe I just used too many potatoes). I added mushrooms and bacon pieces and it was excellent. I let my man be in charge of the grill (he wouldn't have it any other way) so he had to cook them with no instructions other than "flip them halfway through".  On the bottom I had written I LOVE YOU and drawn pretty pictures all over the foil. He loved it!  Said he felt like he was back in high school.

These were good.  I will make them again, but with a little more seasonings.  I would also spray the foil with cooking spray.  The potatoes stuck to the foil.

We love this recipe.  I have made it several times this summer with the BBQ Steak from this site. I add a little olive oil as well as the butter.  I also sprinkle a teaspoon of chicken boullion granules, it adds a really nice taste.  I always use red potatoes and keep the skin on and I only use sweet yellow onions.  I also added some garlic.  Really enjoy this one!!!

Yummy as can be.  We all loved it.  I found my potatoes stuck to the foil.  After reading other suggestions I will rub the foil with olive oil.  Because of personal preference, I used a large sweet onion in place of the red.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter.  Thanks for sharing Bob!

Made this last night and it was great.  Especially considering we were in the middle of a heat wave and the last thing we needed was the oven set at 400 to bake potatoes!  I only had a yellow onion, and it turned out fine - very sweet.  I also sprinkled on some garlic powder and rosemary.  Next time, I'm going to try olive oil and red onions!  This is a recipe that will be fun to experiment with!

Very tasty....except I agree with some of the other reviewers....the potatoes stuck to the foil. Even after I tossed the potatoes and onions with olive oil first and added some butter to them, they still stuck. My suggestion is to make sure they are well coated with oil and to keep flipping the packet. I will try again next time...they are very good, taste like diner homefries.

Easy.  I tossed everything in olive oil, instead of butter.  Added some fresh rosemary and some seasoning salt.  30 minutes on the grill was fine, but I don't think you could overcook these - maybe even longer would be better.

Simple, fast and delicious.  I would spray the foil or use olive oil to mix veggies with salt and pepper. Thank you for the recipe.

I used new potatoes, red onions, and green bell peppers. My only negative was that the potatoes took longer to get tender than the peppers and onions. Wish I would have added those about halfway through to make it great, but everyone enjoyed it and we ate on it for days afterwards. I did not do butter, but instead kept it healthy by tossing the veggies in olive oil and different seasoning to taste.

Delicious!  I served with the Key West chicken.  Once the potatoes were done being grilled I added some shredded cheddar cheese to melt on top! I will be making this again!

This was truly great and simple. I sprayed some Pam on the foil first and seasoned everything with a little Sunny Paris or some other seasoning from Penzy's. It was so good that we are making it again today.

These are okay..... I have a similar recipe that I've been using for years and the only difference is I add chopped garlic and olive oil to the packet along with the butter and seasonings.
If you're in a rush, you can cook the sliced potatoes in a saute pan for a few minutes to get the cooking process started and then finish in the foil packet on the grill with the onions/garlic/butter...  Turns out great.

This is my favorite way to have potatoes on the grill.  We have been using this recipe for years, and not until reading these reviews did I ever think of spraying the foil with cooking spray to keep potatoes from sticking.  Duh!!  Thanks for the great idea!

A classic.  Been making this for years around a campfire, but never thought of putting it on a grill.  Hard to go wrong with this one, unless you don't grease the foil enough causing the veg to stick.  I added some red and yellow bell peppers and used Lawrey's Seasoned Salt.  Pretty and delicious served with roast chicken.

These were good. I used olive oil instead of butter, and added some thyme to it. Mine took a little bit longer on the grill, about 40 min, but that was probably my fault because I may not have had the right temperature going on the grill.

We been making those for a long time now, just like BARBIE0492  said, we make either i n oven or grill. My daughter told me to precook them in microwave whe n we are in a hurry. After taking them out of microwave I cover with oliveoil and seasonings (We use the dry ranch dressing as seasoning)and finish in oven or on the grill. They are so great and easy as a sidedish!!

These were a family favorite with grilled steaks when I was a kid; I have been enjoying them for over forty years!  I now make them using yukon golds and olive oil.  Lightly coat the aluminum foil with the oil and sticking is not a problem.

This is a great side dish to put on the grill while cooking steaks or hamburgers.  The only change I made was to use Vidalia onion in place of the red onion and it was yummy!!

I cooked the grilled potatoes and onion along with grilled chicken breast, it was delicious.  I only added garlic salt and seasoning salt for more seasoning.  I will be making it over and over again. Quick, easy and worry-free.  I cooked the potatoes for over an hour and they were perfect.  I sprayed the foil with cooking spray before adding in the potatoes and onions.

Very easy recipe but provides an alternative to the more common mashed potato without taking any more time.  I sprayed aluminum foil and double wrapped them.  The double wrapping was definitely not necessary.  I put the cut veggies in a bowl (adding some cut-up sweet peppers) and added a little olive oil and spices, stirred it around and then spooned the mixture onto six lengths of foil.  On two I also added some Old Bay seasoning; on another two I added a creole seasoning; and for the third set of two I added lemon pepper.  That was a good way to test seasoning alternatives.  I also put a couple fresh basil leaves on each before dotting with butter and rolling them up, folding the edges tightly to prevent leaks.  After half an hour max (started before the steaks were put on the grill) I opened the ends of the foil packages and everything slid out beautifully onto the serving plates.  I had marked each package to know which had what type seasoning.  Results?  They all tasted great!

To those people who gave this a low rating and called it 'bland,' what did you seriously expect from a meal consisting of potatoes, onions, and s&p?? It doesn't take a professional chef to know that this needs a little playing around with... I personally cut back on the butter, and instead added a little chicken broth to the parcel. I also put a little grated Swiss cheese on towards the end of the cooking time. I ended up with an almost French Onion Soup flavor which we both really liked. It took closer to an hour to cook all the way through. Great basic recipe. Thanks, Bob!

Did this recipe a few times on the grill - it was a great success. I cooked it for a dinner party for a side dish for grilled chicken and samon, and everybody loved it. After the grilling season was over I decided to try the same recipe in 400 degree the oven. It still came out delisios, just not as browned. I have experemented with different seasonings, different onions (sweet onion is my faviorite version). Butter is very improtant ingreadient for the taste but last time I cut butter to 2 tbs, and added 2 tbs of avacado oil instead, it was still very good, actually, the potatos browned a bit better even in the oven. All and all, great recipe!

Made these for Father's Day. I followed Barbalicious's advice and added other veggies and herbs. I had everything already sliced & diced then I laid out foil sheets. I let guest add whatever they wanted to their packet. Everybody loved these and got to make their own choices. Thanks for this delightful recipe Bob.

Helpful hint to get the potato to caramelize. After I place the first piece of foil down, I rub the stick of butter on the foil, and then start loading the potatoes and onions. When grilling, I start by putting the packet on direct heat for about five minutes. This technique should result in a nice dark brown crust on whatever sides of the foil packet you decide to brown.

delicious! I followed directions exactly, next time I think i will add a few herbs to it to increase the flavor. I really enjoyed the potatoes as long as there was a bite of onion with them, alone we found it a little bland.

This is a great way to make potatoes during the summer when you don't want to turn on the oven.  The simple ingredients are staples, but you could also add additional spices to pair up with whatever main course you are serving (I usually add fresh chives, but dill would be over the top wonderful here).  Thank you for sharing - this will be made again and again!

I've made these four times in the past month and they are absolutely delicious!  My only addition is a little rosemary.

I found this recipe a couple of years ago and THIS is what made me love allrecipes.com. These potatoes are delicious! I've made this recipe many, many times and it's always a big hit. My boyfriend, who doesn't generally like potatoes, loves these!!! On the grill or in the oven, these are incredibly easy and delicious. The red onion is fabulous and we're always running back for seconds. Yummy Yummy - I strongly suggest trying this one. Thank you.

I used a cube of butter, and used garlic salt, and pepper, didn't measure.  Also added some rosemary...it took longer than 1/2 hour, and I cutted the potatoes, in quarters.  It's a great basic recipe, it's a keeper.

Quick, easy grilling side item.  I used a mandolin type slicer to cut down on the prep time.  The only thing I would change would be to spray the foil with Pam as I had some of the potatoes stick to the aluminum foil.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good!  I've been making this for years and never get tired of it.  I always make it on the grill using the foil method.  Be sure to get the potato slices thin - I use the slicer blade on the food processor.  Also, I mix all the ingredients in a large bowl before I put them on the foil (which I hit with cooking spray first).  Never had a problem with the potatoes sticking...

My husband bought me a brand new grill with all the bells and whistles for my 25th birthday so I wanted to cook as many things on it as I could for a cook out that night. I came across this recipe and because of all the wonderful reviews decided to try it. They were wonderful! There were 7 of us eating and everyone enjoyed them. I used italian sweet onions, seasoned salt, garlic powder and coarse black pepper. The grill smelled wonderful when they were cooking and they were soooo easy! I did double wrap them in foil and next time I will only use half the butter (but I think I went overboard in the first place) I ran out of cooking spray when I was halfway done so I rubbed olive oil on the foil for the rest - I had no sticking. I will definetly make these again. There are SO many different things you can do with them!! They cooked in 26 minutes and the last 4 minutes I put them over direct fire to get them a little crispy. Wonderful!!!

Wow! This recipe is a keeper! I used new white potatoes and marinated them in a cayanne,garam masala(curry powder),olive oil and salt mixture for about 30 minutes before grilling. The end result was fantastic!

These were tasty.  I sprayed the foil with butter flavored cooking spray, and subbed 1 tsp. of garlic pepper salt (one spice) instead of the 1 tsp. of each of the salt & pepper.  They came out perfectly.  Thanks Bob!

I tried this before and the potatoes took quite a while to cook, so this time, I boiled them until they were barely fork tender before cooking. I also used a drizzle of olive oil instead of butter and added some parsley and they were great! I cook these indirectly, above the grill, so I don't have a problem with them burning.

We tried this as a complement to a new kabob recipe I found.  I added a few things, like onion powder and McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning, but it turned out delicious!  No leftovers!  Even my picky 4 year old liked it (although she left the onions, but she had seconds on the potatoes).  My husband has declared this his "favorite grill sidedish".

My mom has made potato and onion packets on the grill since I can remember. Now that I have a family, we make these at least two times a week( in the summer), I use only 1 sheet of heavy duty alum. foil and spread a little butter or marg. on the bottom, then put thinly sliced potatoes and onions,another dolop of butter, garlic salt, etc.. Whatever you want, my husband puts seasoned vinegar and any spicy seasoning on, but I usually double the foil for his so it doesn't leak. Fold them up tightly and grill each side for 10-12 min. Then place them on the top rack when you put the meat on. They will continue to cook until everything is ready!We have a couple picky kids that don't like onions, so we write there name on the packet with permenent marker before grilling. I also cook them right on the heat(direct) so some of the potatoes get crispy! Yummmm!**update** I used a little olive/canola or sunflower oil instead of the butter to cut down on the fat.

This is a barbeque standard, but I find that it takes longer than 30 minutes, so I put the whole potatoes in the microwave for 5 minutes first, so that they are still just starting to cook a little bit.

Even better if you add sliced red, green, yellow and/or orange peppers (or hot peppers!) and sliced carrots. Another good combination is potatoes, peppers, zuccini slices, onions and fresh basil.

Mine stuck to the foil and were mostly burned too badly to eat.  I had them on the top shelf of the grill and off to the side away from the direct heat and turned them as directed.  I did have the cover on the grill so maybe that made it too hot or I just didn't have it far enough away from the heat.  The flavor was really good on what was edible.  I will try again but will really watch them closely so I don't burn them again.  It wasn't quite as foolproof as I anticipated.

I have been grilling something similar for a few years and in fact you can even put the packs in the oven during those winter months that we experience in the north east.  If anyone cares to be daring, I do not use butter or olive oil, I use a little Italian dressing (Ken's light works great) and I top it off with some shredded cheddar cheese.  It is amazing!  I can just eat that alone I do not need anything else for a meal.

I sliced the potato & onion thin & placed them in a bowl. I added olive oil, fresh garlic, salt, pepper & parsley. Sprayed a throw away foil pan with olive oil spray & grilled them for 30 mins. They were delicious!

I thought I was going to love this but it came out burnt to a crisp.  I did keep it off the directly lit grill burners so I'm not sure what happened.  I took a taste of a little piece that wasn't burned and it was sooooooo salty that even if it hadn't been burnt, we would not have been able to eat this anyhow.  Such a shame.

Made this with "Grilled Hanger Steak with a Roasted Shallot Port Demi Sauce and Grilled Garlic Green Beans" from AR. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I dotted the butter on the bottom and then added the potatoes.  I also used diced onions and dill.  Amazing flavor.  I'd say they were done at 25 minutes.

Fast, simple, delicious!  This is, seriously, one of my favorite things to cook now.  I took a lot of other reviewers' advice and tossed with a little olive oil.  It's also true that you can pretty much use any combination of veggies for this one (corn on the cob was an excellent addition)!  Since I make this almost everyday, I just toss the pack on the stove using a cast iron griddle.  Thank you for these great and easy side!

This was simply delicious! Very fast and easy to prep and the flavor was incredibly good. Very onion-y but still very good. These were a bit peppery though and I love pepper so maybe just a bit less the next time. This was perfect for a summer backyard cookout. Much better than a grilled baked potato and much healthier too I'm sure.

Good recipe! Personally, I spray Pam on bottom & top of aluminum sheets or use a disposable/washable aluminum pan w/aluminum sheet on top. I place 1" squares of bacon on bottom then, layer with onions & potatoes seasoned with optional a light dusting of cayenne pepper w/salt & pepper then, I place another layer of bacon on top. 6-8 pats butter on top, seal tight with foil Grill for 1 hr. 15 minutes. Then we are happy,happy,happy!

We made this the other night when the temps were at 90 F and with no AC in the house, we needed something creative for the grill.  My daughter put this together, and was so proud when it turned out fantastically!!

This is our favorite grilled item in the summer. I use butter and olive oil both, and also add a few cloves of garlic.  I can usually get about four servings wrapped in one foil pouch.  The best part is no dirty dishes for clean up!

This is a great basic recipe.  We've been doing potatoes like this for years.  I toss in other stuff depending on what I have on hand.  Our favorite add in is a liberal sprinkling of goat cheese and sliced portabella mushrooms.  Just remember that if you add cheese you need to turn the packets about 4 times to keep the cheese from burning to the bottom.

These are good! I was wondering about the flavor possibly being bland, but it wasn't!  The onion does wonders.  I was also concerned that potatoes wouldn't get soft enough, because I have tried several similar recipes in the oven and they never get done.  They turned out perfect in 30 min on med heat.  Very soft and Yummy.  My husband and I ate them all up!

A little too buttery for my taste and some of the potatoes stuck to the foil.  Good but not perfect.

I love these over the grill and I love them over a camp fire. I sliced my potatoes very thin so they would cook faster.  Sometimes I slice my onions, sometimes I dice them - good either way, but they tend to dissolve faster when they are chopped too small.  I used white onion. I put the potatoes and onions in a bowl, tossed with coconut oil, salt, pepper and other spices, then wrapped them in packets.  Don't grill without these!

I love making potatoes this way in the summer, no oven needed.  The only thing I change is I use a garlic pepper blend, and top with fresh cut chives and sometime crumbled bacon!

These were great and it was wonderful not to heat up the kitchen baking potatoes.  I used two layers of foil and made sure to use cooking spray. I probably used less butter to cut back on calories.  I made one without onions for my daughter and we all thought it is great.

Takes WAY more than 30 minutes to cook! This is a great recipe, but I gave 3 stars because at 30 minutes, the potatoes are totally not done. It really needs at least 45 minutes to get them tender. Also, it was a bit bland, so next time I will add some garlic and a bit more butter and salt.

I grew up eating these just like you have the recipe.  Now I have changed it by adding other veggies that I have on hand.  I like to use zucchini, sweet peppers, hot peppers, asparagus, green beans celery, carrots, etc.  I cut down on the amount of potatoes and add the other veggies into the packet.  I also find that olive oil is the fat I use rather then butter.  Fresh herbs and garlic make a wonderful addition also.

Great potatoes. I used a white onion because it was all I had. I omitted salt and pepper and opted for seasoning salt, New Orleans seasoning for kick, garlic powder, and celery salt. I put it all in a large bowl with 3 tbsp olive oil and 2 tbsp butter. Done in no time!

I love these....been making them for years.  They also do really well in the oven.  I like to make them with red or new potatoes, the onion, some chopped fresh parsley and a little cayenne pepper.  Delish and so easy to fix and forget until they are wonderfully tender and and just a little crispy.

I have been making these for the past 16 years, we use sweet vidalia onions sliced, and depending on how flavorful we want them we either use the regular potatoes or the red potatoes, I myself prefer using the red potatoes, as I always have to make them in a very large part I use a whole stick of butter, and we use garlic-pepper blend and chives. Try different seasoning to tempt your taste buds, you can't really go wrong unless you use something that doesn't go to well with onions and potatoes.

Too much pepper- too spicy, even for me.  I will cut it down to 1/2 t. next time I make it, and I will be making it again.  This recipe would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't for the pepper measurement.

I've made this twice this week - once with just regular potatoes and white onion and once adding fresh baby green beans to the mix.  I tossed the veggies with the olive oil and salt/pepper before placing it on the greased foil.  It has turned out perfectly both times, and considering my grilling talents, it must be universally fool proof.

This is one of my favorite grill recipes.  Be sure to use red onion, and make the thickness of potato and onion slices as uniform as possible.  The tasty results of this quick and easy recipe never cease to amaze me.  Enjoy!

I just found this recipe and wanted to comment that this is a great way to eat taters. Its even better with a slice of uncooked bacon wrapped around the tater.

Your back to basic kind of recipe. Very easy to make. Clean up is a breeze. I used a little season salt and used olive oil instead of butter.

I had little hope for this recipe, but I had an onion and a couple of potatoes and was grilling anyway.  Boy, was I surprised!  It was the hit of the grill!  It was also super easy -- I merely threw it on while everything else cooked, turning it when I flipped everything else.

I've been making potatoes like this for years!  They are great.  Just make sure you grease/butter the foil good and double wrap. You can add all kinds of stuff to your liking.

I thought this was good, but I made a little changes. First I sprayed the foil so it wouldn't stick and then I put butter on the foil followed by the potato chunks. Then added red, yellow, green and orange bell peppers and onion with the potatoes.  I sprinkled lots of season which gave it a great kick! I added onion and garlic powder, oringinal Mrs. Dash and last but not least I added some red peppers (spice) to make it a little spicy. But don't put too much or the flavors will be runined!

My mother has been making potatoes like this on the grill ever since I can remember! They are awesome! And so versatile! You can add whatever herbs you want. My husband and I love it, and since we grill out year round (even when the temps drop below 0!) and make this often!

I thought these were okay but nothing special. For my tastes, they were too oniony and yet kind of bland, though I added a little olive oil, garlic, bacon, and (dried) rosemary.  I used Vidalia onions and some yellow cooking onions, rather than red onions, so if I make them again, I'll increase the amount of the spices, maybe add a few others, and try red onions.

Excellent results with somewhat vague directions (red pototoes, Idaho's, or Russerts?) I lay 3 slices of potatoes (Idaho) side by side to form triangle, then did same with onions slices, did twice ending with potatoes.
Salted bottom of foil with kosher salt, had little sticking problems. 
Excellent!
Will make again with a pinch of some herbs and spices to add some flavor.

These were good. Simple and easy to prepare. I baked them in the oven at 350 for about an hour to an hour and a half. They were good. I also added some herbs and top with a little cheese in the end.
Thanks for the recipe!!!

Fantastic base recipe. I live in an apartment, so no grill for me. Took about an hour or so in my oven at 350.  I put the packages on top of my pizza stone, and the bottom got nice and brown. I added garlic and a ton of fresh rosemary and thyme from my herb garden. Tons of possibilies, this method of cooking has now become a staple. Thanks!

I've been making this basic recipe for many years, but I always add green pepper and a slice of cheese to the recipe. I also don't use much butter. The cheese browns and becomes crusty, kind of like what you find at the bottom of a cheese fondue. That's the best part!

OK Bob, You did not say I couldn't use Sweet Potatoe, so I did. I used the red onion and I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt. I forgot to add the black pepper, but it turned out great anyway when served with dinner slices of ham.I did grill it 45 minutes and the sweet potatoes were very tender.

These potatoes were very good.  I followed the advice of others and used cooking spray on the foil and there was no sticking at all.  I also used Tony Chachere's for a little extra spice--this recipe is definitely a keeper.

I've made these five times so far this summer, and they're always a hit.  Even the picky eater in the family loves them!  I spray a foil cooking bag with oil, turn them every 5-10 minutes, and haven't had them stick yet.  Most often I've used Yukon gold potatoes and Vidalia onions.

I love this recipe but because I am on Weight Watchers and trying to lose weight I cut out the butter and use Pam spray. I spray the foil before adding the veggies and then spray the veggies again. I also add a little bit of cayanne pepper to add a little zing.

These were really yummy!  I'm allergic to onions so I just throw in whole garlic cloves.  I loved it, hubby loved it, 3 year old daughter doesn't like potatoes so she wouldn't even try it.  But if she had, I'm sure she would have loved it too!  :)

This has been a camping staple for us as long as I can remember. Try using fresh green beans and carrots!Also good with chopped celery and leftover crumbled bacon.I use more butter, double wrap, and season with garlic powder.(We don't like to try to mess with fresh when camping.) Add hamburger for a complete meal. DON'T BURN!!!! That's the only secret. A kid hint: they love to add ketchup to this.

We love this.  Try it using the new foil cooking bags - makes it even easier and no mess from drips.  Added garlic too adn lots of black pepper!

Great tasting, super easy!I actually did this in my oven while I was baking chicken.  If you do this make sure you have the foil sealed pretty tightly to prevent a buttery mess on the bottom of your oven!

I have used this recipe for years and everyone loves it. I usually do mine with chicken breast. Makes everyting as stated in the recipe then stuff the chicken breast with the mixture. Wrap very tightly in foil and cook over medium heat.  Try it I think you will enjoy this very much. We even did this a few times over and open camp fire. This also works well. Let me know what you think.  Jean

These potatoes & onions are really tasty. Be sure to keep them away from the hottest part of the grill so as not to scorch. This gives them a chance to cook evenly and thoroughly.

I loved this recipe , I just changed it by making individual baked potatoes packets.  By slicing the pototoe almost all the way thru but leaving it as a whole potatoe.  Then inserting the some onion slices between the pototoe slices,
then adding the other ingredients and wrapping each potatoe individualy.  Easy to serve this way, but it takes at least 1 hour to cook

A great way to cook everything at the same time!  A welcome change from potato salad for those of us who enjoy a hot meal, even in the summertime!  This is absolutely great with a grilled steak.

Very good recipe and simple to make, especially when grilling your main dish. We have been making this recipe for several years and have used both red and yellow onion (red gives a stronger flavor, but it's good; yellow results in a sweeter flavor, but not overpowering). Also, have used chives and green onions with no problems. Sliced or cubed, the cook time is about 30-40 minutes on the grill. I halve the amount of butter and have sub'd w/olive oil as well. Versatile recipe to add other seasonings, such as dill, garlic or onion powder, herbs: rosemary, thyme, basil, etc.

These were easy and tasty.  I used non-stick foil for the inner sheet.  I used about 3/4 pound of the mini red potatoes cut in half, and used red onion separated into rings.  I sprayed them with olive oil, and put the potatoes and onions in a large plastic bag.  I added the salt and pepper and 1/2 tsp garlic pepper,  and shook the bag to distribute the seasoning.  I placed the mixture in the foil, making sure the potatoes were cut side down, and one layer thick. Then I dotted the tops with butter (2 Tbsp).

We made these tasty packets for our Memorial Day BBQ.  The potatoes were delicious with a little carmelization and the onions were like butter.  We will certainly add this recipe to our menu for future cookouts.

Delish.  Finished the potatoes by turning the grill up to high and burning them a bit.  15 minutes on each side on medium and then 5 minutes on high.  Yummo!

PLEASE READ.  Make sure you use non-stick foil or spray with cooking spray.  This is probably a somewhat dumb mistake on my part, I put extra butter and thought this would prevent sticking, I was wrong!  A few fresh mushrooms go along nicely as well.

Delish!  We all loved them, even though I over cooked them a little bit.  Getting used to a new grill.

Doesn't get any easier than this.  I sliced my potatoes into long slabs for faster cooking.  Be sure to oil or spray the foil because this was a great way to avoid sticking.  A sprinkle of your favorite cheese finishes them off beautifully!

Easy to make, very versatile.  You can "spice it up" in different ways to suit your taste. Followed other reviewers advice and used olive oil instead of butter for a healthier version.   Tonight I added rosemary and garlic.   Will make again and again.

These are the potatoes I grew up eating in the summer because it's the only thing my dad knew how to grill besides meat and a can of beans :)  Now I'm cooking them myself... the possibilities are endless of ways you can change it up.  Just last night it was garlic and rosemary with the poatoes.  A classic!

Delicious!  I used olive oil instead of butter to cut back on cholesterol.  Also, I added one sprig each of fresh rosemary and oregano.  The potatoes had a great flavor.

I sprayed my tin foil with some pam to prevent sticking, other than that I kept the recipe as is and they turned out great. Red onions are a must!

Amazing... I added a sweet onion,diced garlic, carrots, real bacon bits, salt, pepper, parsley and basil. It was a hit with all our friends and family. We made it with 10 pounds of potatoes and had enough left over to freeze so we can have it the next week with our corned beef dinner.

This were really good. I messed up and wrapped one potato in only one thing of tin foil. I also seasoned with minced garlic, dried dill, and dried, parsley in addition to the salt and pepper.

Instead of using butter I tossed with plenty of olive oil.  And I also added Italian seasoning.  I cooked over the grill for 25 minutes and should have listed to the instructions and left for another 10 minutes or so.  It was very good and I will make this again but leave it longer on the grill as instructed.

This was fantastic! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added some carrots, zucchini and one small red onion per potato. Also seasoned with oregano, basil, chili powder and Worcestshire sauce in addition to salt and pepper. Halfway through, I opened the packet and added sliced bacon and Parmesan cheese. It was a hit with the whole family and went along perfectly with Indonesian Pork Tenderloin from this site. Thanks for sharing!

My husband made these for me on one of our first dates - that was over 20 years ago & I think this recipe was one of the reasons I married the guy - he cooks! Only difference in his version is he uses red potatoes sliced very thin & vidalia onions when they're in season. Heaven!

This is a family favorite in our household. We never grill without making these also. The one thing we use different is vidalia onions. They add a little more sweetness which enhances the flavor of the potatoes even more!

These were fine; typical campfire potatoes.  I would probably do something to make them a bit more special.

We have been making these for years and they are always a hit. We add different herbs and seasonings each time but our favorite is season salt and pepper.

This is a family favorite for sure.  We typically have yellow onion on hand so that is what we use.  Sometimes, we just grill onions in foil all my their lonesome and sometimes we add other veggies in too.  YUM!

Great way to add potatoes to a grilled meal without using the stove or oven.  You can make all kinds of changes to the seasoning, just don't add TOO much butter/oil, and don't make the packets too thick or too thin.  The sliced onions smell fantastic as the packet cooks, as good as whatever protien you're grilling.

Such a good basic recipe that can be adjusted to personal tastes! I used cooking spray, butter for flavor, and tossed the ingredients in olive oil for extra no stick power. Garlic is very good in it. The potatoes were kinda bland but good with ketchup. Next time I'll add a little extra salt.

I'd use less pepper when cooking for kids. They wouldn't eat it because they said it was too spicy.

Amazing!  This recipe is exactly like the way my mom used to fix them so that Dad could throw them on the grill with whatever meat we were having.  Very easy, but so simple and delicious!  The grill just does something to the potatoes, almost sweetens them I think, and makes them incredible!  I made them for dinner tonight with our chicken and my gang all loved them!

These were wonderful and easy! The only reason for the 4 stars was due cooking time being pretty long.. Perhaps I cut my potatoes alittle thick, who knows.. But I will definitely try these again!

This is a delicious, easy to prepare side dish. I made some minor changes: added several cloves of minced garlic, subsituted extra virgin olive oil for butter, added chopped thyme and left out the salt. I also added a sweet potato since it was in the fridge and needed to be used. I mixed all the ingredients in a dish to make sure the potatoes were well coated with oil and seasoning. It would probably taste really good with minced fresh rosemary. I opted for the thyme because my 1 year old prefers the taste.Yummy! I made enough for leftovers and am eating it now.

Made this tonight and it was really tasty.  I added some fresh garlic because we love it and it was great.  I did have some problems with the potatoes sticking to the tin foil though.  Maybe next time I'll try to coat it with something.

I just made this recipe, and it was really, really good!  Even better than when my mom used to make 'em (under the monicker "Hobo Potatoes")!  I did prepare a couple things differently though... First, I used red potatoes and white onions, as that's all we had available.  The biggest thing I changed was that I didn't use butter; rather, I used olive oil, and only used enough to lightly coat everything.  The other thing was in addition to salt and pepper, I added all-purpose dill seasoning, which tasted amazing!  This is a great recipe, very easy to prepare, and cook time is dead-on.

Nothing gets any easier than this recipe! Absolutely yummy and easy to tweak. Sometimes I add herbs, sometimes I use mayonnaise instead of butter. Sometimes I add cheese on top.

I made these exactly as directed. They didnt have much flavor. I usually make potatoes on the grill in foil but I add a ton more seasoning as well as fresh garlic, I'll stick to my own next time.

These are great when you add mushrooms and some green pepper.  When I take them off the grill, I open the foil and put in a piece of cheese, then wrap them back up for a few minutes until the cheese melts.  Yummy!

I loved this recipe. It tasted simple but good. It was a nice twist to traditional potatoes. I did add a little olive oil and 5 whole cloves of garlic (me and my husband love garlic). I also bake the potatoes. I usually bake them for about 35 min. at 350 degrees in a glass baking dish covered with tinfoil.

Really good. Added garlic and used sweet onion. Emerill's essence was a nice touch instead of just salt and pepper. Using a mandoline cut the prep and cook time almost in 1/2.

I have made this many times and have found to add 2-3 tsps. of minced garlic as well to the mixture.  I put Lawry's on everything, but I also add a few shakes of Lawry's in addition to the other ingredients.

My mom had to have this recipe after she tried them. I added bacon bits, and have used white onion. I also added some Lawry's season salt and Old Smoked Hickory Salt, which is hard to find. They turn out great everytime I change it up a bit!

These were so good.  I used cooking spray on the foil to prevent sticking as suggested by someone else.  Sliced the potatoes to about 1/4 inch.  Added two or three small chunks of sharp cheddar.  Most of it melted nicely on the potatoes but some of it cooked to the foil.  The previous reviewer is right -- that is the best part.  Also added some bacon bits and sprinkled them with coarse salt.  I did end up cooking them about an hour (oops) but they were not burnt or overdone.

This is good. I make this in the oven at 375 degrees for about an hour. To make it really good and fattening I put a couple slices of bacon on top. Very good with the bacon.

My husband says these are "painfully good" as in you can't eat enough at one time to satisfy the craving. One of our favorites - yummers!! Thank you for this simple, quick YUMMY recipe!! I also added a dash of garlic powder to each packet as per another reviewers suggestion! They were wonderful!

Simplicity on a hot summers night! I followed the recipe as stated and just added a dash of garlic powder, and sliced the potatoes maybe a 1/4 inch thick so they cooked faster. I also used I can't believe it's not butter spray instead of the butter. Simple and delicious!

Delicious.  My husband loves potatoes, but I'm only ambivalent about them, so it's a relief when I come across a recipe we both like.  The texture was nice and not too onion-y.  I also added a drop or two of lemon juice.

This was a good, basic recipe.  I used very small red potatoes that I cut in half.  I substituted olive for the butter and tossed it all in a foil bag (I just love those things!).  Before serving, I drizzled with some red wine vinegar.  A good recipe because odds are, you'll always have the ingredients on hand.

These are very good, i've tried them with both red and yellow onions and I would say to stay with the red onions.  They just had a better flavor with the red.  This recipe is so easy!

I've made this many of times, the only substitutions I use are cayenne instead of black pepper and Lawry's seasoning salt instead of the regular.  I also like to add fresh parsley for a little extra zip.

Tasted great. I used olive oil and Vidalia onions. A helpful tip:us heavy duty foil because when you flip the package over (with regular foil) it can rip easy. I also tried it with yams. Not bad at all!

Awesome recipe!  The potatoes came out perfect. I used regular onions since I didn't have any red ones on hand and they were still delicious.  I will try it next time with red onions and maybe add in some garlic.  I was looking for a different way to make potatoes and was so glad to find this recipe!  Perfect compliment to grilled steak and chicken!

Just be careful how long you let it sit. I used the big George Forman indoor grill and it came out slightly burnt, but I guess I was because indoor grills cook faster. Overall, though the recipe was a sucess and something I will continue to make, with slight time modifications for my cooking setup.

Wow, I am totally impressed.  This was so easy and tasted delicious!  None left over!  I put a double layer of foil to avoid burning, doubled the butter, and added some rosemary.  FANTASTIC!  I'm making it again tonight.

I followed the directions and used a cast iron stovetop grill rather than an outdoor grill, and while some of the potatoes on the bottom burned a bit, the rest were fabulous.

Easy and wonderful.  I have made this several times and adjusted the seasoning to 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.  Minced fresh garlic is a good addition.

Tried this tonight, and was totally disapointed.  I used Yukon Gold Potatoes, and had to use a white onion instead of a red.  I found the dish totally bland, and way to buttery (you could "feel" the butter).  Also - I cooked it for an hour and it still wasn't ready.  I had to pull it off the grill because the rest of the food was done and already on the table.

I burned my the first time around.  The next time I just foil lined a baking pan so I was able to check and stir the dish so it wouldn't burn.  It was very tasty.

These were good, but I think I needed to add a little more butter and salt, as I didn't measure.  It also needed more than 30 minutes to cook.  Otherwise, a quick and simple side dish.  I'll be making this again.  Maybe next time I'll add sliced garlic.  Thanks, Bob.

My husband was the one who prepared and grilled this dish.  He raved about how easy it was to prepare and cook!  It smelled heavenly when we opened the foil packet, and tasted delicious -- a perfect compliment to our chicken skewers (but I could definitely see this accompanying a steak)!  This one's a keeper!

I like this recipe, but I took it a step 
further.  I used only half an onion, but
added about 1.5 C. baby carrots, then
sprinkled dill weed (to taste) over all.
It was GREAT, and just as easy.

This is an easy way of making a family favorite in my house called "Smudge".  It was from my grandmother and was made in a frying pan, but the grill is much easier.

I loved this recipe,I liked the 
combination of onions and potatoes.
It was a welcomed change from the usual
potatoe salad. The flavor was great,
and easy to follow the recipe.  I did
find that I had to leave them cook a
little longer for them to be a tender
as I like them.  Thank you for this one.

My husband has been doing potatoes this way for a couple of years now.  We never get tired of it.  He puts lots and lots of fresh garlic and onions.  We usually fight over who gets the little bits of garlic and onion.  They carmelize from cooking in the butter.  I almost think they are the best part.

This is an excellent recipe!!  So EASY to prepare...no pans to wash and few utensils to use...one less thing going on in the kitchen while it's cooking....men and kids alike LOVED it!!!  I cut the potatoes into long pieces like large french fries.

I have been making this recipe for several years.  However, I add 5 slices of bacon, cut into small pieces.  I also spray the foil with non-stick cooking spray, in addition to the butter, to keep the food from sticking to the foil.  Great recipe!  Always a hit at a barbeque.

This is great and so simple. I drizzled a little olive oil over the potatoes and onions before sealing. I found if you do them seperately they are excellent also and if you make only one layer, they will get a very grilled taste.  Fun to experiment with...

have made this in some version for years even good in the oven as a casserole.  Try adding fresh herbs from the garden ie. rosemary/chives/parsley; one or in your favorite combination.

You can also take a potato and slice it but not all the way thru the skin and put a slab of butter and a slice of onion between each slice and wrap with foil like a baked potato for individual servings. Also adding a little garlic powder and paprika tastes great too.

These were fabulous! I took someone else’s suggestion and put the potatoes in a big tin tray and put it right on the grill. I also used olive oil and butter. Not the healthiest choice but every once in a while you need the splurge!

I make something very similar to this, but add extra butter and season salt. I prefer red potatoes and red onions.  Great recipe.

Loved this recipe! Added a little fresh Rosemary I had on hand, but that was all we changed. The red onion makes the potatoes sweet and savory.

I make these quite often.     After slicing the potatoes, I soak them in ice cold water, dry them them assemble in the foil which I spray with Pam.    They come out crispy and tender, and serve with sour cream and chives.

Potatoes stuck to the foil.  Wasn't great... a lot of red onion flavor, otherwise bland.

Loved these spuds! The only changes I made was I used a sweet onion and sprayed my foil with Pam so I eliminated the butter. I used Yukon Gold potatoes - that's what I had on hand. Very good!! Will definitely make again.

Made exactly as written. This is really good and simple. I flipped it a couple of times over charcoal for 25 minutes on indirect heat and opened the pack for the last 2 minutes over direct heat to get the potatoes crispy. Stuck a little to the foil but came off ok, result was crispy delicious potatoes. Onions gave it great flavor. Will try some cloves of garlic al the ends of the foil next time to see if I can add to the flavor. Excellent thank you.

I've been making these for years. The only thing I do different is I add slides of green pepper. You can't go wrong with this recipe unless you don't add enough butter and the potatoes stick.

I used a vidalia onion, because that is what I have on hand.  I would think a person can just use whatever kind of onion they like for this versatile recipe.  I also nuked the potatoes in the microwave just to soften them slightly.  After I made the packets up, I went and put them on my grill.  30 seconds later, I ran out of propane.  100% my husband's fault :)  I took them off the grill and threw them in a 375 oven for 45 minutes.  Worked like a charm.

It's well over 100 degrees outside, and being able to cook the entire meal on the grill outside is a lifesaver!  I added parsley and spices, and the results were great.  I was concerned the potatoes might stick to the foil, but the butter (and indirect heat on the grill) helped me out on that account.   Next time, I'll toss a little Parmesan cheese in the packet, and I bet the results will be bomb.com!

These potatoes were very good.  Next time I will use extra onion and a little more butter as the potatoes I used were quite large.  Excellent as an a side to any bbq.

This is from old Girl Scout recipe where we made hamburgers in foil.  Put hamburer patty in foil and add sliced potatoes , onions and carrots.  Salt and pepper.  We used to then place on coals.  Now I use on the grill or in the oven in the winter time.  I also  do just the potatoes, onions, and carrots for a side dish to include a vegetable.  I use the petite baby carrots and they come out  very tender

Fixed these for Memorial Day cook-out.  Potatoes were not fully cooked in 40minutes & onion turned a sick gray color.  Tasted awful.  Saved them by putting in skillet on stove top & cooking for @ 15 minutes & they were great as fried potatoes.

Simple and delicious!  I used 6 red potatoes (since they were kind of small), extra virgin olive oil instead of the butter and mixed in onion powder (instead of using an onion) with the salt and pepper before tossing the potatoes in the mix.  I also sliced up a small yellow squash I had on hand and added it in.  It made 4 servings and tasted wonderful.

My hard-to-impress mother loved this recipe! My only con is that it is very difficult to remove the potatoes from the foil, even if you spray it with oil. Aside from that - lovely!

Very easy and tasty! Has the lovely smell of home fries with hardly any work. I thought my 1- and 3-year-old might not care for this much pepper, but had no problem - they loved it! We've had it twice this week!

Wow, this recipe was great!  Like other reviewers, I used it as a jumping off point and added my own twist.  I tossed together sliced onion, fresh potatoes from the farmer's market, sliced garlic (big slices mellowed with cooking), herbs (parsley, oregano and lemon tyme all from my garden), salt and pepper and olive oil.  The oil kept things from sticking in the foil.  The onions turned out sweet from the slow cooking and I was so excited to use herbs from my first garden.  Wow... so easy to throw the packets on the top shelf of the grill while everything else cooked.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

I used new potatoes and cooked the onion a bit in the butter, then mixed in the garlic.  Then placed it in foil pouches and grilled it was just fine.

This is a great start.  It becomes 5 stars wit these changes - slice the potatoes really thin and add to the packets: crumbled bacon, crumbled smoked cheddar cheese, minced onion, butter, salt, pepper.  yum!

These didn't work for me.  Using the cooking time and instructions stated in the recipe, most of my potatoes burnt to a crisp.  The parts that didn't burn tasted OK, but were nothing special.  I think they need a lot more seasoning in order to make them taste even slightly interesting.

loved this recipe.  however, i agree w/another cook's review - i used yellow onions rather than red.  to me they produce a stronger/better flavor when cooked.

I used to make this recipe on the stove top in a big skillet.  This time I tried it in the oven at 375 degrees for 50 minutes.  I used garlic salt w/parsley instead of reg salt.  It was wonderful.  As soon as the weather is a little warmer, I will try it out on the grill.   Good comfort food!!

This was so good. My husband didnt cook them long enough so it was under done but it was cooked enough to get the idea of the flavor - fanatastic - the red onions and butter really do the trick. I will make this again for sure! Thanks!

Very good!  And if you want to make these a little more healthy, I've also made them low fat by using Butter Flavor Pam instead of butter.  I then sprinkle a good portion of Lawry's Black Pepper Seasoning over the whole thing.  The Pam keeps the food from sticking to the foil and you get that delicious butter taste without all the fat and calories.  The seasoning has quite a kick, so add accordingly.  You'll be surprised how delicious they are.

Great idea and easy to fix.  I like that this cooks over indirect heat while you can use the fire for the meat.

This was very good, but instead of spraying the foil, I used the new Release aluminum foil which is non-stick. It works wonderfully. I added some Italiqan seasoning and garlic, and we just loved it.

These potatoes grilled up quickly and easily.  I used my mandoline to get very thin slices.  The amount of seasoning I added was not enough!! Even after added salt and garlic seasoning my husband and I were still pouring on salt.  I also sprayed the foil, for easy eating.  Adding pieces of bacon would be wonderful too!

Ahhhh... this reminds me of my summers growing up, camping with my family.  I cube my potatoes and onions (I always use sweet onions) rather than slicing (you can micro the potatoes a bit if you don't have a lot of time to grill).  Add whatever seasoning you like to compliment the rest of your meal.

This turned into a fantastic side dish with a couple modifications!!  First, I used olive oil rather than butter, and I added zucchini, yellow squash and red peppers!!  It was delicious.  I recommend the red-skinned potatoes and definately use red onion! I rarely cook with it, but in this recipe, it worked! Thanks for an easy grilling recipe!  :o)

Very, very tasty! I took the suggestion from another review and added olive oil (just because I love the flavor of olive oil)and they were perfect. I served them with Marinated Grilled Shrimp recipe from this site, a salad, and Garlic Toast. There were NO leftovers! Thanks Bob

Quick, easy, and I was able to make it with what I had in the house.  I didn't change a thing, made it to go along with grilled steaks, and it was a hit with my husband and teenage nephews.

This is very good, but needed more seasonings for me.  The unique ingredient is the red onion and I think it is the key to make this recipe different.
