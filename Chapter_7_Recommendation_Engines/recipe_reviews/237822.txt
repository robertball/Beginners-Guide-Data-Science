Really good. After tasting it as constructed from the recipe, my wife and I decided that--though the recipe was very good as written--we prefer a mixture that is sweeter. So we incrementally added sugar until it was perfect. This was a side dish at our Independence Day grilling on July 4, 2018.

This was really easy to make and very tasty. I mixed Kalamatta olives and green olives and added some carrot shavings. Colorful too.

I ate if for lunch today and my taste buds were so happy!  I did add tomatoes,  cucumber and a tad Parmesan cheese...delicious. I will make again for lunch.
