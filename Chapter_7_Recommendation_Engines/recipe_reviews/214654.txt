Because I'm kind of low on ingredients, I improvised a little. I used all Rice Chex minus about a cup and a half so I could sub in a cup and a half of pretzles. No pecans on hand, so I omitted them. I did use Splenda brown sugar blend. This turned out nicely, though the pumpkin pie spice was a little overpowering. Next time, I might only use a teaspoon and a half or so instead of a whole tablespoon. Next time, I'd like to try this with a little Goldfish grahams thrown in.

I have made this several times in the past few months and it is always a hit.  The first time I forgot the vanilla but the flavor was so wonderful, I have not added it since.  Wanting to double the recipe without too much of the same cereal, I added 2 cups each of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Golden Grahams and Snyder's regular "Snaps" pretzels.  The Snaps are a great addition, the little squares in the pretzel hold the sugar/spice mixture perfectly and the salt gives a nice contrast.  Just because of the large amount I was making, I baked the mix in a large roasting pan at 250 degrees for 1 hour stirring every 20 minutes...then let cool completely.  Wonderful!!

I made this and took to work.  It didn't last one day.  My only change was that I couldn't find Cinnamon Chex so I used Cinnamon Toast Crunch and it was a big hit.

I first tried this at work. We fought over the bowl! I followed the directions except I added a little more brown sugar-I like the sweetness! This is way better than any other Chex Mix I have tried. You have to try this!

I have been trying a different Chex Mix each week, and so far, this is a favorite.  I sent a batch up with my daughter while she was watching tv and she gave me an empty bag back.  This is a nice option to the traditional Chex Mix.  Great flavor - just the right sweetness.

I couldn't find cinnamon chex, so I used Cinnamon Toast Crunch like some other reviewers.  I also discovered too late that I only had about 1/2 tsp. vanilla, so I added 1/2 tsp. almond extract.  This is dangerous!

Yummy!!!  I coud not find the Cinnamon Chex so I used two cups Wheat Chex and 4 cups Honey Nut Chex.  I have tried other Chex Mixes and did not care for them, but this was wonderful.  A friend made this for our Halloween party so I asked her for the recipe.

YUM.  This is a sweet treat.  I bought Wheat and Honey Nut Chex-split them up 3 cups each; kept all ingredients the same EXCEPT I made a mistake and used a stick of butter.  Have to say this is pretty darn good!

I just made a double batch of this>> 1 for my fellow lunch Ladies tomorrow and 1 for my teenage kids and All their friends. The kids thought they Died and had gone to Heaven! We LOVED IT Mom, they all shouted. I had a half a box of brown sugar and maple Chex cereal, to which I added rice Chex, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch  cereal. I wanted to get this all Christmasy  so I added a pkge each of  X Mas M & M's peanut and pretzel candies instead of the pecans. Very pretty indeed! I will definitely make this again!! Thank You Chex! BTW, I used my Own homemade vanilla from this site for this! Extra special touch this time of year:) Merry Christmas to All. Love, Patty

This is really very good.  Instead of using the microwave, I baked it in the oven at 250 for about 30 minutes, stirring twice.  It turned out nice and crispy, and has stayed that way since making it 4 days ago.  I'll be making this one again!

Yum!  Super easy and delicious.  Not only does this make a great snack, but also a nice gift to give during the holidays.  I like that unlike some other types of Chex mix this doesn't make a HUGE batch that I needed to scale down and didn't require that I purchase umpteen types of Chex cereal.  I actually used just rice, and cinnamon Chex and it came out great.

Very tasty and easy to make. I'm using this instead of cookies this year for gifts for family. I used Cinnamon Life cereal because I wasn't able to find any Cinnamon Chex. I used 4 oz of pecans and 4 oz of Cinnamon Almonds. I threw in some cinnamon chips at the end just because I could :). I didn't think that the pumpkin pie spice was overwhelming at all, and the Wheat Chex I usually avoid were sweet enough to eat!

I was hoping there would be more of an "in-your-face" pumpkin pie flavor, but there wasnt. A big hit with the kids at the playgroup though!

Very tasty!  I toasted mine in a 250° oven for 1 hour, stirring every 15-20 minutes.  Also, added pretzels and peanuts to the mix.  Taking some as a hostess gift for Thanksgiving.

I improvised using rice, corn, and wheat chex. I added cinnamon since I didn't have the cinnamon chex and I also increased the pumpkin spice. I had roasted pecans that I added near the end. Yummy!

My 3 yr old grandson & I made this as our project  of the day & WOW am I hooked!!  This will be my go-to recipe when I want a sweet mix from now on.  It will be used thru-out the holiday season, & then some.  Will make nice gifts. Took some to work & had to make 10 copies of the recipe!  Used Rice Chex cause that's what I had on hand & made up my own spice mix.   I love anything "pumpkin!"   Thank You!!

Because I was taking this to a baby shower I added 2 theater-size boxes of Sugar Babies at the end (did not microwave) and holy cow, it was good. That addition is a keeper. The only other change I made was I substitued Cinnamon Toast Crunch because my store didn't have the Cinnamon Chex, and I think I'll do that in the future too. It was perfect.

Oh my gosh..........this is very addicting - in a great way.  Just not a low-fat way!  I made two batches - one without nuts and one with salted peanuts instead of pecans.  I used all the cereals listed and added 1 cup of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal.  The butter/sugar mixture is fantastic on this recipe.  Most definitely will be making this again.  Since it is fall - I added the candy corn after the mixture had cooled.

This was quite delicious! For the Cinnamon Chex I did substitute another cup of the Honey Nut Chex and 1 cup of pretzels. Also, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp. almond. Perfect!

yum! My kids aren't big on pecans so I substituted cashews in a batch- I prefer it with pecans but is good with cashews.  Also threw in a handful of dried cranberries in a batch.  Yummy!

Delicious and addictive! I would recommend using the oven rather than the microwave, though. My microwave smelled like pumpkin pie for 3 weeks!

So, so good!  I added 1 cup of Snyder snap pretzels (the sweet/salty combo is awesome), and 1 cup of raw almonds.  I didn't add more of the butter, sugar, or spice to accommodate the extra ingredients, and I think that was the right choice because it would have been overwhelmingly sweet.  Everyone loves this, and has requested that I add this into the regular holiday snack rotation :)

Insanely delicious!  I wanted to take something for a Thanksgiving hostess gift, and this is such a nice fall interpretation of classic chex mix.  Added some white chocolate chips that complement the cinnamon/brown sugar taste.  Did add more butter, pumpkin spice, and brown sugar to coat entire mixture.  Crazy good--don't miss this!

Excellent!!!  I think next time I'm going to bake it in the oven so the pecans are a little crunchier.  Could even increase the butter/vanilla.  I accidentally bought rice chex instead of the honey nut and it is still awesome.

My family really liked this for a different take on chex mix.  I did improvise since I was missing some ingredients.  For the spice I used a mixture of clove, ginger, cinnamon and tupperware brand cinnamon vanilla spice mix.  My local store only had pecans in a 6oz pkg which I feel was plenty.  I also used cinnamon toast crunch, teddy grahams, rice and corn chex.

Mmmmm- we loved this! I changed the cereal a little bit; used Honey Nut Chex, Cinnamon Chex and Golden Grahams. I also added Annie's organic cinnamon bunnies. I made this in the oven (250 for one hour, turning every 15 minutes). I will make this again!

This was great!  I followed other Chex mix recipes, and baked it at 250 for 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes.  If you don't, the pecans aren't toasted, and don't have the right flavor/crunch.  Next time, I'll bake this only 45 minutes, as 1 hour made the pecans a little burned tasting.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is good, quick, easy and versatile. Used rice chex, honey grahams, cheerios, and cashews. Kept cereal, vanilla, spice, sugar and butter measurements the same. Just used the cereal I had on hand.

Super easy recipe.  I used 2 cups of pretzels instead of using 2 cups of Wheat Chex cereal, and it tasted delicious.  Followed the rest of the recipe as written.

I doubled the amount of pumpkin pie spice as suggested.  I also used 10 oz pecans.  I used a mixture of Honey Nut Chex, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Golden Grahams which I highly recommend!  This was so awesome the 1st day and then it was just kind of average the next day.  Not sure why......

OMG! DELISH!  Used 1 1/2 C each of Rice Chex, Wheat Chex and Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  Used 1 1/2 C of Square/rectangle shaped pretzels.  Used about 4 oz Pecans and 6 oz almonds.  Used 1 tsp. vanilla extract and one tsp. almond extract.  Sprinkled about 1/2 bag of white chocolate chips after heating in microwave, let sit until warmed and then stirred in just a little, until spread evenly.  SOOOOO GOOD!

Pretty tasty! Next time I will probably cut back on the pumpkin pie spice by a teaspoon or so - it was a bit strong, but my pumpkin pie spice blend is pretty strong to begin with.  I think I'll also toast it in the oven in the more traditional way - microwaving didn't quite toast the pecans the way I like them, and even the cereal seemed to get a bit soggy.  I'd like to add little mini-pretzels next time for a bit of salty contrast.

Light and sweet.  Very good as a fall snack, or trail mix.   Not overwhelmingly pumpkin flavored.  Just the right amount of spice.  Will make again!

This stuff is great. It had just the right amount of spice. I replaced 1 cup of the rice chex with mini pretzels and only added what I had of the pecans- about 1/4 cup. The butter/spice mix might have been a bit more diluted if I had added the full amount. Thanks for the easy snack recipe that everyone enjoys!

I made this and had to make a second batch the next day!!! We have a nut allergy in the house so I had to substitute the Honey Nut Chex for Wheat Chex and the pecans for Golden Grahms. A huge hit!

Very tasteful, addictive recipe. I brought it to 3 different places over Thanksgiving holiday and people couldn't keep their hands off! Will make this again and again.

Be careful, this stuff is addicting!  I have made it twice now and have learned to only cook it 3 min 40 sec for my microwave.  I would also suggest using pecan halves and leaving them whole because they are about the same size as the cereal.  If you have smaller pieces they will go the the bottom of the bowl. Let's see if this batch lasts till tomorrow.  The last batch never made it to tailgating.

Very easy and quick to make.  Flavour is mild but good.  Subbed microwaved popcorn for the nuts (due to nut allergies).  A nice way to use up a surplus of cereal!

Turned out really good, however, I wish it had more of a pumpkin taste to it.

I was really excited to make this but once it cooled and I tried it I was pretty let down it had a one note flavor. I would have to say it was just ok not something I would make again.

Just made a double batch of this for a Thanksgiving dinner with friends. I made this with half salted pecans and half Sugar Coated Pecans recipe from this site. It tastes so very good that I can't wait for my friends to taste this!! I don't expect to bring any left overs home. I didn't find it greasy at all, used 3/4 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and salted pecans halves as well as the sugar spiced pecan halves. In honor of Mr Food... It is oh so good!!!!

Mixed brown sugar, 1/4c canned pumpkin, & pumpkin spice into melted butter and microwaved for 30 sec to 1 minute until boiling.  Stir in vanilla.  Pour pumpkin mixture over cereal mixture and stir until coated.  Put on cookie sheets and bake in oven at 350 for 5 minutes or until crispness that you desire.  Let cool and store in sealed container.

I used Life wheat cereal, honeycombs, and cinnamon toast crunch cereals. Didn't have nuts and they were so expensive at the store that I just omitted them. This turned out so well and my family loved it. My 8 yr old daughter couldn't stop eating it and asked to take some to school for her snack. Just wish I made more because one pan doesn't make very much. I ended up baking it at 250 for 1 hr, stirring every 20 mins and it seemed perfect. Will make more for the holidays as it just fills the air with a wonderful aroma. Such an easy and tasty treat!
