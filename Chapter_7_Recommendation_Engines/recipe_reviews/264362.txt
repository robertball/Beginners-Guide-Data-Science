6.2.18  Followed the recipe to the letter, and the one modifcation I had to make was adding a cornstarch slurry.  It simply didn’t thicken after adding the cream and peas.  All of the chicken pot pie flavors are in this, but I must say I do miss the crust.  One thing that I really like is that  the ingredients in this recipe are ones that I always have on hand, so I could see this turning into a "go-to recipe."  My husband asked me if this was a soup and when I told him it wasn’t, his next question was “are we having this over rice or noodles?”  I did cook up a few noodles, mostly for him, at least he was happy!  Once I had the consistency to where I wanted, I switched over to Slow Cook, low temperature, until we were ready to eat.  This was good, even without the crust, and I will make this again.

Pretty good recipe for a Chicken Pot Pie without the pie (aka crust). Flavors are here for a pot pie, but the consistency of a thin chicken soup--a really tasty chicken soup! Mine didn't thicken up to achieve more of a creamy pot pie mixture I was hoping for (lactose free and subbed with coconut cream). I made a cornstarch slurry, which helped a little, but not enough. I'm guilty and made some gluten free elbow noodles to go with the soup.  Will make this again, but will try ladling out some of the excess broth before adding the cream or  try making a little basic bechamel sauce and grate in some cheddar cheese to the sauce to add to the soup when it's done. I'm wondering if adding some shredded or small cubed potatoes would work in absorbing some of the liquid too. Lots of room to play with the recipe if desired, but really it does make a very good and quick chicken soup! Thanks for the recipe!

After reading others reviews stating it was thin like soup I decided to cut back on the chicken stock to 1 cup. It helped but I still needed to thicken it up with a cornstarch/water mixture. I also upped the seasonings to suit my taste. I did end up serving it with noodles for my husband but I enjoyed it as is. Very easy to make.

doesnt account for the water in the chicken breast.  Added two tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken it up properly during simmer process

I sautéed for 6 minutes at the end and it thickened up nicely.  Also cooked GF rotini on the stove and added it at the very end to make it a bit more filling.  Super satisfying!

This is really good!! I read reviews and used 1 cup of broth. I also used canned corn, peas and carrots. I added them at the end. It's still very runny so I added a cornstarch slurry and 2 tbsp of GF flour/ butter mixture which thicken it really well. First time I made this I put it over mashed potatoes but 2nd I poured it into 9x13 and topped it with GF stuffing (Aldis) and popped it into oven until stuffing browned. If you're missing the crust I suggest using stuffing. It's amazing!!

Adjusted recipe to ten servings. Was soupy, like others noted. Will make again and add cornstarch to thicken it up. Was great with a loaf of bread!

A lot of review I read noted the soupiness. I made a cornstarch slurry and added a lot. It helped. Another option is to add pureed cauliflower if you're sticking with GF. I love crust, but I'm sticking to low carb. I made Oopsie Breads and each one is a perfect size to place on top of a small crock bowl.

I used coconut milk for instead of cream.  I also put in about 1/2 cup of instant potatoes hoping that would have made it thicker but it was not enough.  When done and I added the coconut milk I added another 1/2 cup and it thickened it up very nicely.   Will Differently make again.

Delicious!  I used raw chicken breasts... but then added about 4 oz. of frozen microwaved cauliplower chicken to the saute portion at the end. It gave it a little more texture and added a little more flavoring.

Really good! I used chicken thighs (kept them whole). Added sliced mushrooms and leftover gravy. I kept the frozen peas and corn for the end. Did not add cream but added some leftover barley which helped to thicken up this soup.

I think it is too much cream - try half a cup or 3/4 cup cream.  I used about 3/4 cup cream and had to add a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up.  It comes to a soup like consistency but has all the right flavours.  I added fresh basil, leeks and a harbanero pepper - yikes!  Next time I will do the basic recipe :)

It was very thin. More like soup. Tasted good but didn't thicken up even with corn starch.

This had great flavor, but like other reviewers said, it was a soup, not thick at all. I made it exactly like the recipe with the exception: I didn't have "poultry" seasoning so I used my trusty Parsley-Sage-Rosemary and Thyme trick for chicken.
At the end, when I saw it was too liquid, I made a cornstarch slurry and added it. That helped thicken it up quite a bit. I also added more salt and a little more pepper for our taste.
I would make again.

I am new to the Instant Pot so I was looking for easy recipes to try. This one turned out to be delicious! Makes excellent comfort food in the cooler season. It has more of a soup-like consistency but that was fine with me, I thought it tasted great and had a nice variety of veggies and chicken to make it feel healthy enough for me.

The taste was decent but, like most others have said, it was really thin. Even cornstarch didn't thicken it enough. I think I'll try one more time and make chicken gravy from the broth in the pot after cooking. Once I stir it back in, it will hopefully have the thickness and taste I'm looking for.

I substituted heavy cream with full fat Greek yogurt. It definitely tastes a bit leaner and has just a subtle tangyness. I added 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter to add back some richness. I'd give my modified version 4 stars tbh I had 2 cups of corn and that may have also watered it down a bit. My girlfriend loved it...

Very easy and tastes great. The only change I made was to add tiny pasta and an extra cup of broth to make it a thicker soup. Will make again.

Great flavors.  Loved it.  However, did on stove top and sautéed chicken then vegetables then spices and liquids with a teaspoon of cornstarch added to thicken a bit.  Will make again and again.  I think it could use a whole teaspoon of thyme next time.  :)

Five stars, no doubt—not only delicious but also simple to make. Yes, one must add flour or cornstarch; mushrooms would be good, as well. Nonetheless, this is a solid five-star recipe. Thank you!

Very tasty. Made this according to the directions and is was very soupy. Even with adding cornstarch and letting it saute longer, it was still more of a soup/stew. The flavor was very good, but a little peppery for my taste. Next time i will use 1/2 teaspoon pepper and serve with a crescent roll. I will definitely make again

I added an additional cup of peas.  Whole family loved it, even my 2 year old!

Made it to the letter. Definitely needs some corn starch to thicken it up. Will possibly try again another time

Gourmet quality! And the 1st recipe cooked in our New Instant Pot!
We did add cornstarch & broth paste & mixed with the cream & peas towards end of cooking process. And served it all over rice Cauliflower. 
Super delicious, highly recommend??

I changed the recipe up a bit... I used a whole bags of frozen corn & peas, added a generous amount of my favorite Tastefully Simple "Rustic Herb Seasoning",  and whisked in a heaping scoop of corn starch to the heavy whipping cream before adding it.  I didn't have any chicken stock so I used about a cup of water. Recipe was a great starting point!

Same as many above I added corn starch to thicken it, some more salt and ended up using pasta for a more hearty meal. But as the base recipe this was quite delicious

I agree with other reviewers that this is thin - more a soup than pot pie.  I had to keep adding cornstarch to thicken it up.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

I made this recipe, it was pretty good, there seems to be something missing taste-wise not quite sure what it is though. It did come out very soupy as others have mentioned however I added cornstarch until I got it to a thicker consistency that I wanted. I served it with mashed potatoes and it was quite good, patty shells would go good with it.

Definitely will make it again! I used red and yellow candy onions. Used homemade poultry seasoning. Turned out very tasty!
