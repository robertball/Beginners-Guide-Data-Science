I have some tips for all of you who are frustrated with them melting.  Freeze them for about an hour or overnight before you dip them and take them out ONLY when you're ready to do it!  This will produce a much cleaner, prettier patty.  I've never used this recipe here, but I have my own personal recipe I use that turns out every time.  Use white almond bark and a rasberry flavoring for Valentine's Day or as a nice color ensemble with the chocolate/mint patties in a holiday basket!  And I gave this 5 stars because of the people that followed the recipe as directed, it turned out great for them.  I don't believe in giving someone a bad review just because I messed it up.

Great recipe! Quick and the kids love it. I didn't
dry them overnight I put them in the freezer until firm then dipped them. Also made them with lemon very good.

Whatever you do, don't use instant mashed potatoes.  Somehow, I couldn't get the patties to thicken.  As I didn't have any extra powdered sugar to add, I was forced to add extra potatoes and then it ended up tasting awful.  I will try again with regular potatoes!

I also varied the flavors: lemon, orange, and maple.  I shape the dough in to a small log, cut it into small squares and used it as filling for those candy molds you buy at craft stores.  I stored them in fridge until I gave them away as gifts.  I am going to do the same thing for my wedding.

awesome! they tasted just like york peppermint patties :) .. my only qualm is that mashing the potatoes by hand just doesn't cut it. they need to be as smooth as possible for this recipe. because even though i thought i did a pretty good job mashing them, there were these hard little pieces of potato in the finished product that were kind of unpleasant to bite into. but that was more my mistake than anyone elses. next time i make this recipe, i will use a hand mixer for at least 2 minutes.  ~christine~

Yum!! Yum!!!  These were GREAT--I had a lot of compliaments on these! Hubbys favorite is Yorkshire Peppermint Patties, and he said these tasted just like them.  I didn't have any wax paper so I used an oven liner (new of course)--worked GREAT. When they filled the oven liner I used half of my cutting board--Bad idea-they stuck and I had to chissel them off.  I didn't have time to let them sit overnight becaue I made them the day before Christmas Eve, so I put them in the freezer like another reviewer suggested--worked out perfect--HUGE time saver. I used a lot more sugar than the recipe called for, and I added a few drops of green food coloring for Christmas.  Gave some out with cookies in Christmas themed tins.  My daughter (5) helped make the patties, and we had a ball!  Will definatly be making again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Tasty recipie but very messy couldn't understand how all of you managed a good looking patty. For me those patties won't look good,unless u used   piping bags, one for the melted chocolate and another for the potatoe mix. This is what i did i piped a layer of chocolate in cupcake papers then freezed them for 1min. piped in the potatoe mix and allow to freeze 1 min then piped in the last layer of chocolate then freeze.Remove the paper before serving.

This is a great recipe.  I used my bread machine to mix the dough.  I just added the powered sugar at little at a time. It turned out so nice and easy to form into the patties.  I deleted the salt.  I also used parafin wax and milk chocolate chips rather than using the shortening.  I froze them before dipping them in the chocolate.  Knowing my family, I will be making these every year at Christmas.  I also did some using raspberry flavoring and a little red food coloring. Awesome.

This is a good recipe, although we thought there was too much peppermint, so we cut it in half and that was perfect! We also tinted a few green before we put the chocolate on- We're going to try this same recipe with different flavorings- such as Orange and Maple-

These were really good!  Just like York peppermit patties!  I made them twice; once for a Christmas party and the other for neighbor Christmas gifts.  Both times I added a little green food coloring.  Also, when I shaped them I rolled them into a ball and then used a heavy glass dusted in powered sugar to flaten them to give them a more even look.  I then freezes them until I was ready to covered them in chocolate and I ended up needing to double the amount of chocolate.

These were so good!  Just like the store bought ones.  Who knew...potatoes!  I followed the recipe to the tee. I can't wait to try other flavors with this. Just one suggestion.  You might want to run the mashed potatoes through a sieve just to make sure there are no bits of potatoes in the mix.

Easy!  Yummy!  No one believed there were mashed potatoes inside...  For those of you having issues with them being too soft...  you might need more of the 10X sugar to make them more like a dough.  Just add a little at a time until it's the right consistancy.  I used a pampered chef scoop to drop them onto the wax paper.  This made them uniform in size.  Flattened with the back of a spoon sprayed with non-stick spray. They look (almost) professional!

I read quite a few reviews wherree theee person states that they 'had to freeze' or 'had to refridgerate' the patties or dough before they could dip them in the chocolate. If the reiepe is read through and followed thy probably wouldn't have that problem. The reciepe says to let the patties dry overnight before dipping in cocolate. Dyr not get cold. If the candy isin't allowed to cure in the way its supposed to, how can you expect it to work out right.

Amazing! I froze them after mixing the minty filling and after dipping them in chocolate. I made 5 dozen of these and they were gone within a few days- everyone loved them! I am still trying to wrap my head around the fact that you make them with mashed potatoes...

Delicious and easy to make.  Was a bit sticky and the finished product didn't look assembly-line perfect but they tasted great!  Went so fast, we're making another batch!  We used the full amount of peppermint extract and confectioners sugar as called for in the recipe but used A LOT more chocolate for dipping.

These turned out great.  My mixture was a bit more runny than I wanted (but it could be because I overcooked my potatos).  So I added sugar, but I didnt want to oversweeten the mixture.  I ended up opening a box of flaked potatos to thicken it up to a dough consistancy.  I added sugar or flakes depending on whether or not it was too sweet.  I also added more mint extract.  I think this recipe is great.  We melted andes chocolate baking bits for the coating which had a great dipping consistancy (I would highly reccomend).

Easy recipe.  The only reason I rated it 3 instead of 5, Is, I followed this recipe EXACTLY and still had to add about 10 cups of dough to get the right "dough" consistency.  Also, the salt could be easily cut in half.  And I would recommend using peppermint oil (food grade, of course) over extract.  Though you'd need to cut down the amount used drasitically if you used the oil.

These had a great taste, I just found it difficult to work with.  I used a whole bag of sugar, wow! The chocolate was difficult to work with and had to use more then the recipe calls for. This recipe also made a lot more than 4 dozen.  I don't think I'd try this again.

I made these for Easter treats. I used several different extracts and they came out great. I really liked them with orange extract. Maple extract got rave reviews too. DELICIOUS!

The texture really is perfect, just like the York Peppermint Patties and taste delicious. If you don't eat them right away, you should store them in the freezer for the best flavor and texture. I needed extra powdered sugar to make it more of a soft dough and not as sticky and a little more than double the amount of chocolate.  I would also recommend freezing the filling before using, and only take a few out at a time to dip because they do get soft quickly.

The first and second day, these were awesome! So much better than PEP bars. Yesterday was the third day and I thought they got kind of grainy and tasted more like icing sugar than the creamy mint center they had had. Was lot of work dipping them, we ended up with about 100 and used probably a pound of chocolate. Make sure to let the filling freeze before dipping.

Really yummy!  But, making mashed potatoes for this was kind of a pain.  There's another recipe on the site for "Peppermint Patties" by Patty that is easier and I think just as good.

Awesome recipe!  I anticipated being able to detect potato flavor, especially since one reviewer mentioned how they ended up tasting like peppermint mashed potatoes, but I definitely did not have that problem.  Since I'm gluten and dairy-free now, I've been busy trying to find candy recipes that I can easily convert to fit my dietary needs.  This one was really easy to do.  Instead of the butter, I used ghee and that was the only change I needed to make.  My only advice would be to USE DARK CHOCOLATE INSTEAD OF SEMI-SWEET.  The semi-sweet is still too sweet for peppermint patties.  That's the only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars.  I also halved the recipe when I made it and that worked out perfectly.  And I made sure to pretty much overcook the potatoes so they'd be lump-free.  I also skipped the drying process and just tossed them in the freezer, left them in there for about 15 minutes, and then QUICKLY dipped them one at a time into a shallow pan of chocolate, RAPIDLY flipped it over to coat the other side, and slapped it back onto the waxed paper.  You've got about 5 seconds to complete this whole process before the patty starts to fall apart so work fast!  GREAT recipe!

Wonderful.  Tastes delicious and everyone i shared them with raved about them.  I wrapped them up in little pieces of foil (like the real ones) and people couldn't believe i had made them!  
Make sure you have plenty of extra sugar though, it used a bit more than i thought it would and ended up having to use a bunch of splenda packets (I had put a little bit of milk in my mashed potatoes like i always do but i think it made it take a lot more sugar, so i suggest just using pure mashed potato).
Oh, and if you dip the top and sides in the chocolate then freeze a minute or 2 you can dip the bottoms relatively mess free.
That's about it. Great recipe thanks.

These are pretty good.  I think I flattened mine too much because they seem to have too much chocolate per peppermint.  Also, I don't think there should be as much salt if any.  You can really taste it, and it doesn't go with the peppermint.  I used the exact amount of peppermint, and mine are none too strong.  I only wish I had thought to add paraffin to the chocolate so they looked a little prettier.

**Hint for the chocolate coating:  melt chocolate in a shallow bowl, drop patty in, and use slotted pancake turner to flip it over then take it out and let all excess chocolate drip; do this quickly so the patty doesn't melt into the chocolate; use a knife to scrape patty from pancake turner onto wax paper-- never get your hands messy :)

Good taste though texture not like the Yorkshire Peppermint Patties. . . I did use a lot more powdered sugar (maybe twice as much) to get it "doughy" and not sticky enough to work with. Helps to roll them into 1/2 in balls, place on wax paper, and once sheet is full of made balls, press lightly down on all of them.

These were great.  People were surprised by the pepperment when they bit into them.  Next time I will change two things: the size I made the patties was too large, and I would make sure the potatoes were mashed completely.  Also, easy on the peppermint flavor, I added a little less and turned out great.

Yum Yum! Easy and really good! I didn't want to hassel with dipping them completly in chocolate so I just drizzled some on top and it was great.  I have also used colored candy coating (you can get from craft stores or baking supply chops) and decorated for the holidays in specific colors!  Another thing, They hold up really well in the fridge I have made them up to a week in advance. Thanks for the great and easy recipie!

I'm only 18, so i really didn't know what I was doing in terms of dipping chocolate, so at a friends advice I used almond bark for dipping.  My parents, friends, and little sisters and brothers loved it.....some related the taste to that of York Peppermint patties...will definitely make again

These are very good - but strong!  We made them into Easter eggs.  They would have been better if they'd been flatter (as the recipe directs).

4 stars for messiness/complicatedness, but they are 5 star flavor. I mixed the ingredients together and then froze them in the bowl they were in for ~2 hours! Then I formed them into patties, placed on wax paper on a cookie sheet, and froze for ~15 minutes. I used regular Smart Balance instead of shortening, so maybe that changed things a bit, but I had to add a BIT of oil to the chocolate coating mixture to make it smooth and thin enough! The patties were no where near a dippable texture, so I plopped the chocolate on top and stuck them back in the freezer; and that's where I'm storing them! I believe the reviews that say more sugar is needed, because mine was quite sticky!

This recipe was really easy and fun to make and tastes great.  I was able to make 80 half dollar sized patties, but the amount of chocolate called for in the recipe only covered 20 of them and I only got that many because I made sure to thinly coat them and tapped off all the excess chocolate from each one.  This would definitely be a five star recipe, but it gets a four from me for needing four times the called for amount of chocolate to finish coating all the patties.

Added extra powdered sugar like the others.  Refriderated the filling for about an hours, formed my patties, then froze them for about a half hour.  Took them out and covered them and set them on wax paper, put them back in the freezer...i also added extra peppermint and used dark chocolate instead.

What a simple yummy recipe!  My family all knows that my go-to candy of choice is the York Peppermint Patty so I had to try this out.  I agree with others in that you need to freeze your dough for about an hour before you dip in the chocolate.  I also ran out of chocolate so I ended up melting a bag of chocolate chips to dip the remainder in.  Thanks for sharing Wendy!

I would make these again but with a few changes. I would add more peppermint extract or even better I would use peppermint oil. The recipe as stated does not have enough minty flavor. Also I think in the chocolate I would add less shortening because I didn't really like it that way. I dipped a few in just tempered chocolate and those were much better and weren't melty if left at room temperature. I used way more chocolate than it called for and also an extra cup or so of sugar. But the patties were easy to dip and overall the recipe was a good idea and I will use again.

This recipe (with a few alterations) is amazing. It will give you delicious peppermint patties that are better than Yorks. This are the changes I made: 1) use bittersweet instead of semisweet chocolate 2) use only 1 tsp of peppermint extract.
I also did the following with my mashed potato to make the dough more of an easy process: Boil and mash potato, refrigerate until cold, put potato through a ricer, and then proceed with recipe. I ended up using around 2 pounds of powdered sugar (a little over 7 cups) and just made sure to generously dust the counter and my hands with sugar while forming the patties. I also froze the patties overnight which helped with dipping. Thank you for a GREAT recipe!

Delicious, if not messy to make.  Mine took a few cups more sugar than mentioned (I lost track counting after 8!) and I ended up dropping the somewhat gooey "dough" on wax paper-lined cookie sheets by teaspoonfuls and not flattening them at all.  I put them in my oven (cold) for about 24 hours to dry, then dipped them in chocolate and the chocolate evened out a lot of the lumpiness.  One of my hubbie's coworkers called them "professional" and this was my first try at chocolate/candy making ever!

No one could guess these started with a potato base!  The only reason I marked this down a bit is because I found it extremely messy dealing with warmed chocolate.  It would melt the mint patty on occasion and make it difficult to get complete coverage.

I tried these just for fun for part of my holiday baking and their here to stay!! They were so easy and tasted just like the real thing. I did have to double the amount for the coating as the dough made 60 patties, but they dried in a little over two hours and tasted fantastic. I also only added 1 1/2 tsp of the peppermint extract and they seemed to have just the right amount of mint. Great recipe and a fun one for kids to help with.

I followed the recipe and they are delicious! I needed over 20 ounces of chocolate to dip them all though. I did use instant mashed potatoes, but I mixed them thicker (with less water) than the instructions call for and didn't add any butter to them. 

I needed about 9 cups of icing sugar. At first the mixture was a bit runny/wet, and I thought it would never form dough, but I chilled it for a little while and it was fine. I let the patties dry overnight as instructed. 

I didn't have any problems with the patties falling apart, until the end when I didn't have very much chocolate left and it was getting thick. I kept my melted chocolate in a double boiler though, I think it would be very difficult to keep it melted by microwaving. I used a bent fork to dip them and wiped off the excess on the edge of the double boiler.

This made about 120 candies, I think next time I will start with less potatoes, maybe half or 3/4 of a cup. They are delicious though, and I drizzled them with melted green mint chocolate chips for decoration.

these were great!  i think i used closer to 9 cups of sugar, i lost count after about 5, i added one cup at a time. i also used chocolate almond bark instead of the chocolate and shortening, just easier i thought. i was a little nervous because at first they were sticking to the paper, but after a while of drying out they were better.  we thought they were better if they are kept in the fridge. i will definitely be making these again, thanks for a great recipe!!

This is the best recipe for peppermint patties i have ever tried! I also used a few drops of peppermint oil instead of extract; Turned out perfect.  Also when I melted the chocolate, i used more and used coconut oil to melt in with it (also added extra cocoa and it was extra chocolatey. Everyone wanted the recipe:)

I'm only giving this a 3 today but I think I messed it up so it may change next time I try them. When I made potatoes I let them cool completely before mashing and it was alot harder to mash. Next time I'll whip them up with an electric mixer while still hot to get a smooth potato. I also didn't have mint so I used orange extract. It did tast ok but the lumps of potatoes made it taste weird. Also I put the potato mixture in the freezer to harden before putting in chocolate but the potato never harden. Maybe I didn't add enough sugar, hmmm I did add almost 2 bags of it though. So this recipe gets an interesting rating from me.

ABSOLUTELY AWEFUL!!  Followed this recipe by the book and once I added the powdered sugar, the mix turned into a "soupy" texture.  No way to roll into balls, just liquidy.  Since the consistency turned out so badly, I thought for sure the taste would be more appealing......NOT! Tasted exactly like buttery peppermint potatoes.  YUK! I'm on my way to finding a tried and true recipe on another site.  Thanks for sharing anyway.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was a terrible mess! I made them last year.  I must have gotten the wrong type of peppermint drops, because it tasted like toothpaste!

These are my favorites! I made these twice. First time with instant....OMG what a mess! Although, somehow they came out edible. I was so frustrated I dumped the entire box of flakes in by the time it was over :(. Second time they are perfect....but i had to add WAY more sugar than called for ....so definitely have extra sugar on hand....and that means extra chocolate! Still, by far, my favorites!

I made these mints for couple of Christmas parties I went to and they were such a hit. I had so many request for the recipe. I told them where I found the recipe and e-mailed the recipe and the site. I made then with mint and also vanilla. They were so good. I coated them with white bark also.

I stopped counting the cups of powdered sugar at ten and just kept adding until I got the consistency (not sticky) I wanted.  A small cookie scoop made the shaping and sizing easier. These are terrific and I will definitely make them again.

I didnt like the idea of potatoes in my patty. instead i used cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk to get that sweet taste with the peppermint extract to get that holiday flavor. I couldnt eat them with potatoes. :()>>>>>>>>

I love how simple this is. My only complaint is (and this is likely due entirely to my lack of skill) that I needed to double the amount of chocolate to cover all of the peppermint patties.

The mashed potatoes worked well here, but it was such a small amount that you will only notice it if you leave lumps in the potatoes.

In the end, it was a good recipe and I am looking forward to making these next winter.

Let me start of by saying yes these are wonderful. The reason for the 4 star and not 5 is this. I made this as directed but when it said knead slightly then roll into cherry size balls well that was impossible for me. I had add at least another 1 1/2 c sugar to be able to do that. Then it sat out like stated. everything else when smoothly. In the end I was happy with the results and will make them again. For those having problems and forget about the potatoes so they are over cooked try placing them on a baking sheet in the oven for a few mins to dry out some of the water from the potato.

READ THE REVIEWS!!!  This was a great recipe because the finished product is delicious.  However, as most reviewers already stated the process requires a lot more sugar and chocolate than the recipe calls for.  I made a half batch, got 53 patties and needed a pound and a 1/3 of powdered sugar.  I used melting chips which worked a lot better than the few at the end I made with chocolate chips.  
If you have the time make sure to just leave the mint patties out to dry overnight--I stuck half in the freezer and half sat out over night.  Definitely let the frozen ones come down to room temperature before you dip them because that's when they fall apart.  They'll actually start losing form with the simple heat from your hand.  Dip quickly and if you use your fingers you can make swirls with the excess chocolate on your fingers (plus lick them when you're done).

These were okay. The texture wasn't that amazing - kinda mealy. I wouldn't say they were terrible, but I will try to find a better recipe. My Mom, who is a huge fan of anything mint, liked them, but nobody else loved them.

I had to try this since it called for mashed potatoes.  It is absolutely amazing.  I even tried different dippings.  Such as Half row of white choc. bark with the two tablespoons of shortening, and White chocolate bark with Bakers German sweet chocolate (6squares) with the 2 tablespoons of shortening.  I doubled the recipe and made 190 mints that will go extremely fast for our Christmas with 2 families.  I truelly recommend this recipe.  Shock em all.  They will want it too.

These were really good!  My husband said "it was the best peppermint patty he's ever had!"  I took a few dozen to work (my guinnea pigs!)and I had several "MMMM's".  I thought my arm was going to fall off from mixing though!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these for cub scout den meeting. The boys liked them and my two little daughters seem to enjoy them. But I didn't care for them. I prefer the real York Peppermint patties. I had no idea how much 8 cups of powdered sugar was, I had to make a run to store for more mid recipe. I won't make these again.
