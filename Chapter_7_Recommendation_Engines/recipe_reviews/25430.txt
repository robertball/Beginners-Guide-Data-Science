Great recipe. Two changes for me-
 I discovered that I didn't need both the Red Wine Vinegar & the White wine. Anything acidic will be a nice contrast to the honey. Fresh lemon juice or rice-wine vinegar are all good substitutes. 
*And if you don't have honey or you are allergic to it, you can substitute brown sugar which results in a deep, dark brown color. Thank you, R.T. for a great marinade.

Very nice teriyaki recipe.  The only thing I would change next time would be to decrease the amount of ginger.  I did not have red-wine vinegar and used regular white vinegar.

A tasty, quick to throw together recipe. The only thing I did differently was substitute brown sugar for honey. I used it on beef, sliced up for stir fry. On the side I added some cornstarch to the marinade, cooked it, and added it to the stir fry beef and veg. The marinade was good with the beef, when thickened, made a good stir fry sauce. I like the Baked Teriyaki Chicken recipe from this site for chicken.

I decided to try this marinade, because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was really good.  I marinated steaks in it all day and then barbequed them.  The steaks were very juicy and flavourful.  Will use this again.

This was all right but a little bit more tangy and acidic tasting than I was hoping for. The teriyaki marinade III on this website tasted better to me. I also added a 1/4c of O.J. and a little more honey to decrease the tanginess. Thanks for sharing.

Very good and easy marinade.  I did it for tofu, which I cut in big squares and then grilled.  They were great!  Next time I may shred the ginger to try and get more of the flavor out of it.

This was very good. I didn't use as much Ginger as the recipe called for because my family doesn't like a lot of Ginger. Great Marinade!

Very tasty...I made a few changes though: opt for 1 TBSP sherry cooking wine & 1 TBSP rice vinegar for the 1/4 C white wine vinegar, and use 3 TBSP brown sugar instead of 2 TBSP honey. I used this to marinade my beef for a stir-fry... DELICIOUS!! (Note: I used cayenne pepper as a substitution for red pepper flakes, and it worked just fine)

I've used this on salmon and pork tenderloin and it's really senational.  I wouldn't hesitate to use it on chicken as well.  Yummy!

I used this marinade on sirloin steak kebabs. I marinated about 8 or 9 hours. I did pulverize the pepper flakes a bit before adding to the mixture to bring out the heat a little. I loved the result. I will definitely make these again!

I used this on a salmon fillet and chunks of tuna that I grilled tonight, it was delicious.  I have to admit that I subbed sherry for the white wine and tasted it and was not sure I liked it, so I squeezed in half of a fresh lime and that made it very good, in my opinion.  I will make it again and add in the fresh citrus again.

Excellent marinade for beef, chicken or salmon. This last time, I used rice vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, left out the white wine because I didn't have any, and used barley malt instead of honey. This turned out to be quite tasty on the salmon I grilled. Next time I might try molasses, which is pretty similar to barley malt.

These were edible but way too salty. All we could taste was soy sauce, and I did follow the recipe. I'll keep looking for a good teriyaki marinade, because this wasn't it.

Outstanding!  I used agave instead of honey and the combo of flavors was terrific.  Loved the bit of heat from the red pepper flakes!  This will be  a favorite.  We used it with venison.

I used this marinade for stir fry sauce.
I double the sauce, Substituted water for the white wine and added some brown sugar.  Then I mixed 3 tablespoons corstarch with a little water added to the sauce.

Really good marinade!  I used it on strips of beef that I skewered then grilled after marinating about 2 hours.  I used light soy sauce and rice wine vinegar instead of the vinegar and wine.  The seasonings are dead on, great blend of flavors, although I feel regular soy sauce would have been too salty.  Next time I use this for beef I will use brown sugar or maybe add a little molasses instead of honey to be closer to out favorite takeout beef teriyaki.  I think the honey version would be best on chicken.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was the most salty marinade I have ever made. Maybe using reduced sodium soy would have helped, but with regular soy sauce I found this inedible.

This was really good! I didn't have white wine, and I didn't substitute anything for it but it was still very tasty. Next time I will try it with the wine and see what happens!!
