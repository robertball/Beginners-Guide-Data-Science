Simple and very tasty. I recommend you closely adhere to the marinade times and even marinade 5-10 minutes less. The Ahi Tuna I used is delicate and the marinade "cooks" it before it hits the grill. Since I prefer to serve Ahi medium-rare, my first shot at this turned out medium-well, because I left it in the marinade longer than recommended. Didn't make the same mistake the second time. An excellent and simple dish.

What can I say?  I love Old Bay and the lime was wonderful with the tuna.  However, be sure not to marinate too long...

This was excellent. Simple and very tasty. What more could you ask for? I have been looking for something to put on my fish before grilling and this is what I am going to use from now on. I put the tuna steak in the marinade for only 10 minutes and it had plenty of flavor. Be very watchful of your cooking time. Tuna tends to dry out very quickly so it really should only be on the grill for no more than 8 minutes for a 1 inch thick piece of fish (medium rare). Actually, I think this recipe would be good on any grilled food.

This was the best Tuna Steak marinade I've ever had! My husband also loved it!  I'm sticking with this one!  I marinated it 15 minutes as others suggested not to over marinate and also closely watched it as it was cooking so as not to over-cook and it turned out perfectly!  I highly encourage you to give this one a try!

This was a good marinade and made the tuna taste good.  My only concern is that it seemed a little too salty.  I think I would decrease the Old Bay a little bit and maybe add a little bit of water to the marinade.  My husband, an Old Bay fanatic, LOVED this recipe!

This was fabulous!  I love tuna steaks, but I have never cooked them my self and thought it was time.  I only used one lime and fresh cilantro. I cooked them for four minutes on each side and they were perfect.  I can't wait to use this marinade again!

This recipe is fabulous and extremely easy. My family and I loved every bite. Along with the tuna steaks we had portobello mushrooms, which I also marinated in the same marinade. I followed the exact ingredients and directions and it was delicious.  The only thing I used different was fresh cilantro since I happen to have it.

This was the first time I made tuna steaks and it was delicious! The only things I changed were to use fresh cilantro (4 tsp.) and cut the marinating time in half, as others suggested - as not to start cooking the fish in the lime juice. Then grilled for about 4 min./side for a rare steak.  The only thing I'll change next time is cut the Old Bay in half as it was overwhelming.

Very Good Marinade!  I really enjoyed it on the tuna, and I plan on using the recipe again.  I would maybe cut the marinade time down from 20 minutes to 10-15 minutes.  The lime juice in the marinade starts cooking the tuna.  Other than that this is a great recipe.  I recommend you give it a try.

Very good!  I left out the cilantro, as neither my husband nor I care for it.  I used mahi mahi instead of tuna, and I marinated the steaks for 15 minutes.  Next time, I might only use one lime, because the lime flavor overpowered the flavor of the fish itself.  Great recipe overall, though.

This was a wonderful, quick recipe.  Don't marinate longer than 30 minutes.  Leftovers are great for fish tacos!

I leave out the cilantro because I'm not a fan of that flavor and it still tastes great.  This recipe is very quick & easy and also works well on other types of fish.

I marinated 3 tuna steaks overnight in a ziploc bag; and when I came home from work, I baked them in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes or so.  The fish was so moist and flavorful.  So much so that when I went to get the leftovers from the fridge, I found that our daughter had eaten them.  Delish!!

I followed the recipe exactly except I only marinated for 10 minutes.  The lime taste was so strong I nearly puckered up!  I couldn't even detect a hint of the Old Bay.  Maybe this would be ok if you cut the lime down to just one-half of a lime.  You can always squirt more on if needed.

Improvising as we sometimes do, I used a California Herb blend in place of the cilantro and I prepared this on the stove (can't wait to do this on a grill).   My mom loved it as much as I do, I'm afraid I won't have any leftovers to enjoy.

Perfect blend of seasonings.  We grilled ours outside and fresh grilled tuna does NOT get any better than this! If you cook it on the grill, grill 4-5 minutes per side only.

THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!!!! I will make this again and agin.  I just recently started eating fish and it is taking some time for me to get used to it, this was absolutly AMAZING even though I was full I couldn't stop.  I changed a thing or two just ever so slightly though; I used 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped FRESH cilantro and instead of disgarding the remander of the marinade I heated it(to kill bacteria)and drizzled it over the steaks.  This recipe was so quick and easy, perfect for one of those days when you really don't feel like cooking but you just can't bring yourself to eat junk.  I served it with mexican style rice a roni and a field green salad.  Also because I believe you eat with your eyes before your mouth presentation is EVERYTHING so I sliced a lime and fanned it on top with a sprig of fresh cilantro.  YUM-O

Very good recipe!  I didn't have cilantro so I substituted thyme; also I didn't grill it but cooked it in a heavy skillet (Blackened style) ... it was great!!  Unlike most of the previouse reviewers, I prefer my salmon well done, so I think the longer marinate time would be good for me.  Definitely a keeper and will make this again.

This is the best recipe!  I've wow'd friends and family - they think I'm a gourmet!  Definately use FRESH cilantor though (it is much more flavorful).  Also - don't let it marinade too long (or the lime will cook the tuna prematurely).

A++++
You can't go wrong with this recipe!  REMEMBER to only marinate for 20 minutes or less - otherwise - the lime juice cooks the tuna.
I put ours on the grill - only turning ONCE and cook time = 7 minutes for med-rare.
I topped it with a salsa I made using mango, tomato, avacado, red onion, spring onion, cilantro, small jalapeno, salt & pepper and topped it with lime juice.  ummmm ummmmm goooooooood
After taking his first bite - my b/f asked it there was ANYTHING he could do for me.  THIS RECIPE ROCKS.  Thanks!

This is the only grilled tuna recipe everyone in my family will eat.  I cut back on the Old Bay just a little and use fresh cilantro when I have it.   I try to use sashimi grade tuna when I make this and grill the tuna about six minutes per side for medium. I cut the grilling time to five minutes when using tuna medallions. Very quick and easy recipe.

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. I made it exactly as described, except that I used fresh cilantro instead of dried. The result is thoroughly cooked tuna steaks in a delicious marinade. I can’t speak to leftovers since we both finished ours off in one sitting! I didn’t find any of the flavors particularly overpowering. Definitely a recommended recipe when looking for an easy, healthy, quick dinner.

Tasty! Marinaded the tuna for about 10 hours - can't see that 20mins would do anything much. Cooked it in the Foreman, and it turned out great. Thanks!

This was fantastic.  We used the marinade on wahoo steaks (similar in texture to tuna; different flavor) and it came out wonderfully.  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband loved this recipe! He was so excited about it. We love tuna steak, so it was great to find a recipe that actually tastes great! I thought it was a bit too salty, but if the hubby likes it...must be good!

This is easy and good.  We did not have fresh cilantro so used some fresh basil and parsley, which I realize changed the flavor but was still good.  I also sprinkled rice wine vinegar over the tuna steaks just before cooking.  We cooked in a grill pan on the stove - searing about 4 minutes per side.  We prefer our tuna rare and it was a little overcooked, so we'll shorten the cooking time next time.

Awesome!! I didn't have any limes so instead I used 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I think I used a little too much old bay because it was a tad on the salty side, but other than that it was excellent. I will definitely make this again.

I accidently added too much old bay (turned out a bit salty) and marinated longer than it said- the acid did start to cook the tuna so it ended up a bit overcooked..but the overall flavor (minus the over old bay) was very good and I plan on using this again for other meats!

This is a great recipe - I have made it many times.  It is the first time I would describe a fish recipe as "craveable".  It is tangy - which is what I love about it.  I broil mine in the oven for the same amount of time that the recipe says to grill it, and it turns out great.

Just made this tonight on my Foreman grill and, as to be expected, it was the bomb.  I added a splash of reduced sodium soy sauce and 1/4 T of brown sugar to the marinade and it was outstanding!  First time using the Foreman for tuna steak and I'm impressed!!  

I have made this time and time again - First discovered it on Old Bay's website and now it's a tried and true recipe. Very easy with great results!  I didn't alter it at all; you don't need to.

My husband and I enjoy this recipe a lot!  We have served this to friends too, and everyone has commented on what great flavor.  Makes for SUCH a better flavor that the usual 'teryiaki marinade' I was using before for tuna steaks.  I follow the directions exactly, they need no altering!

I only marinated this for 13 minutes, but the lime was still the only thing I tasted in my tuna.  It pretty much destroys the taste of fresh tuna, which is a shame since it is a very good and pricey fish.  The overall result was still alright, but next time I'll try something that doesn't overpower the tuna so much.

Wowie! We have never eaten tuna steaks before and did not know what to expect. This was terrific! We cut back the marinating time to 10 minutes, as others had recommended, but did everything else as directed.
My daughter was the first daring one to try a bite and she said, "Holy smokes! It is a fish that tastes just like a steak!!"
MArvelous! We will eat this regularly!

Delicious and fast. I don't think the cilantro adds anything, but the old bay and lime combination is delicious. 10 minutes in the marinade is sufficient.

I was looking forward to a good meal after reading the reviews, but I was VERY disappointed.

Yummy!!  I took the advice of some others and only marinated for 7 min otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I think next time I will marinade 10-15 min.  I will definately make this again.  My hubby LOVED it!!

Very good.  Used on swordfish steaks.  Didn't have any limes or cilantro so substituted 1/4 cup lemon juice and mixed in some thyme and crushed mint.  Great flavor, marinade enhanced the swordfish flavor very well.

This is a great recipe that my husband and I enjoyed a lot.  We've made it twice in two weeks!  It's perfect for a very fast and healthy dinner.
