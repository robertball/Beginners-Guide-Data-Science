Wonderfully creamy with a delightfully fresh banana taste--nothing beats ice cream with a cooked custard as its base.  I scaled this down for my Cuisinart ice cream maker, using the ratio I like of 2 cups cream to 1 cup half and half. I prepared the custard as the recipe directs (be careful not to let it boil!), strained the mixture through a fine mesh strainer, then chilled it in an ice bath. When the mixture was cool I added the last cup of cream and the banana--didn't bother blending the two in the blender--then chilled it for several hours in the refrigerator. Finally, once the ice cream was churned, I turned it out into a large chilled bowl and stirred in the chopped walnuts as well as a good cup of chocolate fudge brownie chunks. I served this to four adults,and this was so good they all went back for second helpings, surrounding the ice cream container like kids!

The recipe is another great way to use up ripe bananas that are sitting around in the kitchen. Beats making banana bread every time the bananas go too ripe. My family loved the recipe, but since they have a sweet tooth, I added dark chocolate chips and marsh mallows to the mixture before freezing.

The banana custard flavor of this ice cream is awesome, but I didn't like the consistency that I ended up with.  I usually make my ice cream without eggs and it ends up smoother.  This one seemed kind of icey.

This is an amazingly delicious ice cream. I made it exactly as written, but didn`t have an ice cream maker, so just put the custard in the freezer. The banana flavor is so rich, the texture is very creamy, nuts give an extra kick, although the ice cream will be delicious without nuts too. This is one of the most delicious ice cream recipes I`ve tried.

Oh my goodness this is wonderful!!!  I'm in heaven!  This ice cream was easy & quick to make (quick once it got into the ice cream machine, at least!) - worth the wait for the original mixture to cool off.  It's creamy and definitely banana-y.  I had to make a couple of adjustments just because of my fridge contents - I only used 7 egg yolks, instead of the 8 called for, and I put in an extra banana.  It's GOOD!!

Incredible! This was my first attempt at making ice cream. If I hadn't seen it come out of the ice cream maker I never would have guessed it was homemade. Wonderfully creamy! Certainly an indulgence food that I will need to limit to special occasions though :)

This recipe is perfect. Nice and smooth and creamy. To enhance flavor and crispness I simply toasted the walnuts before adding. Great recipe!

Great banana ice cream!!! Good base flavor for all kinds of stir-ins. Halved the recipe and added an extra half a banana, and a dash of vanilla. Will make this all the time!

I had some half and half that needed using up, so hunting through AR I came across this recipe.  I have not made ice cream for a long time, so I followed the recipe exactly, other than halving all ingredients to fit in my 1.5 quart ice cream maker (it fitted in perfectly).  I did add just over a teaspoon of Banana extract.  I chopped up the walnut's slightly.  I just loved the taste of this ice cream, perfect.  This really will become a summer favorite!

Absolutely amazing ice-cream!  I followed the recipe exactly, but mixed in added chopped brownies at the end.  I made another batch but mixed in chopped graham crackers at the end...both variations were great!

I have been making homemade ice cream for over 30 years and at last have found a recipe that is  versatile and absolutely ravishing.  I'll be the first to admit that there are a few steps you must take to reach the end result, but are well worth the time.  I have made vanilla, banana and strawberry all 3 turned out just fine. (Make the custard the day before to save time.) "If" you have any left overs, you will be please to know that the smooth creamy texture never breaks down. I tested the banana by placing a small cup in the deep freeze for a week and it was just as delicious as on day one.

This came out great for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I came up short on the heavy cream and had to use about 1/4 cup more half n half instead.  My consistency was perfect and it had great banana flavor.  We ate some right out of the ice cream maker that night, and it was good, but it was even better the next day.  I will definitely make this again.  Very easy and very tasty!

Perhaps the best ice-cream ever.  I did change to 1/2 and 1/2 for all the dairy as I don't think the extra fat in heavy cream was necessary.

Very good! I don't like the texture of bananas but since they were puréed it made a nice consistency. The ice cream came out creamy and not hard. I used pecans instead of walnuts and added dark chocolate chunks and mini marshmallows. Everyone loved it.

The is the best homemade banana recipe I've ever made/had.  Easy to follow instructions.  The ice cream is perfectly creamy and has a nice banana flavor.  I did omit the nuts.

Extremely popular at a summer get together, and none was left. While liking it, I thought it needed something else like a chocolate sauce swirled into the ice cream, or topped with a hot fudge or caramel sauce. Makes 2 quarts.

This recipe is just ok. I think if I make it again I'll double the bananas. The flavor was too subtle. Also it's annoying how the recipe leaves you with extra. I filled the ice cream maker and was left with about 3/4 of a cup of  the batter. Too much to waste but not enough to make another batch out of.

My first attempt with this recipe, and it turned out wonderfully! Took it to a church picnic, and there were no left overs!  Consistency was perfect, and the flavor was just right.  I used three bananas, and didn't have any walnuts, so used pecans.  Got several compliments.  The process was time-consuming, but results were well worth the trouble.  Thanks for sharing!
