Nice tasty kebabs and easy prep items. Only thing I had different was the amount it made.With all the same ingredients (could only find regular Johnsonville brats),I manage to make 8 long kebabs. 7 adults and 3 kids loved them so this recipe is a keeper.

Don't even second guess brushing barbecue sauce on brats and vegetables.  I was a rock star with this tonight! Maybe it was the Corky's barbecue sauce from Memphis.  Or maybe it was our own Johnsonville beer brats from Wisconsin. Whatever the reason, these were, as my mother-in-law put it, "suberb." We had these with "Scalloped Potatoes for the BBQ," a recipe also from this site.

this wasnt enjoyable. the bbq sauce over powered the veggies and meat. you just shouldnt put BBQ sauce on brats is what it is........side note......my husband liked them. not loved, but liked. maybe its a guy thing?

Great summer dinner! I did change a couple things though - I used regular bratwurst since that's what I had on hand, I used Sweet Baby Rays Original BBQ sauce, and I put each type of veggie/meat on it's own skewer to allow for more even cooking.  I served them with grilled corn on the cob.  Everything was so colorful and tasty!

Absolutely delicious! This was my 1st time making kabobs, Husband and guest gave several compliments. The 7 yr old cleaned her plate and my 3 yr old who is hard to get veggies in ate all but 2 bites! Definitely will make again, It made 10 kabobs using 5 brats. I did leave off the onions because we only like well cooked onions might try w/ them next time

So I really only used this recipe for the idea...but it was such a good idea I'm posting my review for it...I used turkey kielbasa instead of brats to cut down on the calories, and also used Sweet Baby Rays Honey Chipotle BBQ sauce. I pan friend them on the stove (it was raining so I couldn't grill outside) and then finished then off in the broiler. They charred so nicely I didn't miss the grill and my picky husband even went back for seconds. This turned out to be an inexpensive, low calorie dish I'll definitely make again!!

This is a good recipe, but if your ever in Wisconsin and bring some Bob Evans brats to a cook out we will laugh at you.  Get fresh local brats if you can, it will make a huge difference.

I don’t believe I’ve ever had a brat kabob, so I thought I’d give these a try.  I couldn’t find Bob Evans Beer Bratwurst in the two major grocery stores I went to, so I bought a different one.  I used red, yellow and orange bell pepper, rather than the green.  And I used another brand of BBQ sauce.  I skewered the veggies, separately from the brats to assure the veggies would remain crisp tender.  I was a little skeptical about BBQ sauce on bratwurst, but it was actually quite good and a little different.  I served this over jasmine rice and we very much enjoyed our meal.  I would make these again.

DELICIOUS! I couldn't find Bob Evans brats, so I used Johnsonville Beer Brats and pre-cooked them. I did intend to use the mushrooms, but there was no room, so I skipped them, lol. These had wonderful flavor and everything went very well together. Oh, and I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. This was a definite winner, and I will be making them again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
