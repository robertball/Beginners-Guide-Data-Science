Very easy to make - my boyfriend even helped. I love that it is No Bake!!! Used a chocolate pre-made crust store bought just to save time - fabulous. I left it in the freezer for at least 12 hours (overnight) and it was perfect. I used powder sugar instead of granulated sugar to make it more smooth. It does melt fast.

This recipe turned out so yummy! Much better than I had expected. I followed the recipe but I had no heavy cream and couldn't get to the store. So I used half evaporated milk 1/2 regular milk and 1 tbls butter melted. I slowly added this to the creamed mixture and it still turned out WONDERFUL! I will use the heavy cream next time. As for the freezing time I found if you freeze it uncovered it froze faster and more evenly. It was huge hit at our dinner party. We will be making this regularly!

Very yumalicous! I didn't have a blender cuz i was over at my boyfriends making it. i got it to a paste and just added it that way and still turned out very well. I added partial raspberries on top after an hour in the freezer. Make sure to cut the raspberries when frozen way easier! Definitely a party pleaser!

The flavor was great but for some reason mine didn't set. After taking it out of the freezer it melted all over. Not sure what I did wrong?

Took a chance & tried this out for a family gathering. It turned out really well. It didn't freeze up as hard as I imagined it would but it was good none the less. I did a few things different. First I added 1 Tsp vanilla to the egg mixture.I also doubled the crust & used a 9x13 pan. Next I used raspberry jam instead of frozen as it was all I had on hand. I got many raves but in my opinion the frozen raspberries would be better because it wouldn't be as sweet as jam! Thanks!

This was a very good recipe but I had to double the crust because it just wasnt enough to fill the pan. Big hit thanks!

It was very easy to make and super yummy. I have never made cheesecake so if I can do it so can you.
