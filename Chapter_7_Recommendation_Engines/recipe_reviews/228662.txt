Simple and quick to make. Very tasty and healthy too. When I have more time I plan to make it with all fresh ingredients. Thanks for a delicious meal.

This recipe is very good to me but my brother hated it. I think if you love paella you will like this. I would love to try this with mixed seafood.

This was a very quick dish to make.  I used frozen stir fry peppers/onions, cabbage and a bag of frozen collard greens.  I used crushed tomatoes, liquid smoke, minced garlic and several Mrs. Dash blends to taste (Steak Grill, Garlic, Table blend) and Old Bay seasoning.  The mackerel I used was plain and not tomato.  I make another similar dish with kale or collard greens and tilapia fish.  I like to serve with gumbo vegetables and tomatoes with balsamic vinegar and hot sauce.  GREAT!  I hadn't had mackerel in decades and it's better than sardines, but not as good as red salmon to me.  My husband liked it better than I did.  The canned fish definitely takes away from the dish.  I would make it again because it's FAST and my husband really liked it.  :)

Great! I subbed canned tuna for the mackerel and added some African hot sauce for some extra flavor. Thanks for sharing.

This is a warm your belly meal! A great way to use canned Mackerel. It is also an inexpensive healthy dish. One note for those like me who need to learn things the hard way: Drain the mackerel before adding it to the tomato sauce pan. If you don’t, the taste of fish is strong. Also, this full head of cabbage meal makes a full pot of soup. Next time I may try half the cabbage because my family is small. I also added cracked black pepper, a chopped carrot and a chopped celery stalk.

Made it just as instructed and it's quite tasty and a fine way to prepare mackerel. Next time, perhaps I'll jazz it up  bit with some sliced olives and a hotter sauce. Served it over brown rice and had myself a good lunch.

I wasn't expecting that much, but this was great.  We served it with home-made foo foo, a perfect complement.  We also added chopped shelled pumpkin seeds.  I would make it the same next time, but might remove the backbone of the canned mackerel.  We were all thrilled with this.
