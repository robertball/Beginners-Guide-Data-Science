I really loved this recipe. The combination of dates and coffee is great. However, I did make a couple of changes. I added 1/2 cup more dates and I tented the bread with aluminum foil half way through baking.

What a terrific recipe! I have made it quite a few times since I saw it on All Recipes a few months ago. It is dark and moist which is what I have been looking for. Most date & nut breads I've tried are light in color and not nearly as moist as this one. I tried baking it in the little mini pans and it comes out perfect. It makes about 2 or 3 mini loaves (fill about 2/3 full so they don't drip over) and bake at he same degrees between 45 to 60 min. Great for Holiday gifts. I also added a few extra dates and chopped the nuts coarse by hand to give the bread a nice crunchy texture. Tenting with some foil half way through is a suggestion from another reviewer that is helpful since the bread will get dark fairly soon in the cooking process. A MUST TRY recipe for all you date nut bread lovers out there! THANK YOU Karen for submitting this WONDERFUL recipe!!

This wonderful bread is dark and moist (almost cake-like) and is so easy to make. I am giving it out as Christmas presents and everyone who has received it asks for the recipe. Thanks so much for posting it.

I used only 3 Tbs of sugar but it turned out just as sweet as I wanted it to be. I may use only 2 Tbs of sugar next time. 
For coffe, I brewed espresso and diluted it with hot water. I really love the taste. Thanks for the great recipe. This is the keeper!

I thought this recipe was very good.  I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and used 1 cup of brown suger instead of white sugar.  I also tossed in some currants.  I made muffins instead of a loaf of bread.  This made 17 muffins baked at 350 degrees for about 17 minutes.  Very moist and yummy.

This is a wonderful recipe! My aunt has a thing for dates and she just about died when she tried this!  I made a bunch of loaves for christmas and handed them out as gifts.  I've also used vanilla nut coffe along with a few others for variety.  (I make this bread ALL TIME!)

This bread is really good, almost a gingerbread flavor I found. I was worried when it looked like I had mud in my mixing bowl but it turned out delicious. I didn't bother with the parchment paper and had no problems. Make sure to use really strong coffee, because it adds a lot of flavor. Unusual, delightful taste!!

Seemed almost too thin when I poured into the loaf pan but it turned out great.  Great taste and texture.

As Pennypilaf pointed out in her 12/2/2004 comment, I am one of those people who didn't like this bread.  It turned out moist and everything; I just didn't like the taste. And this was frustrating because I really love good coffee and I also love dates. Sorry, Karen.

Tasty! I made a few changes to "healthify" it. I used 1/3 cup brown sugar (I wanted it to be bread rather than cake), 1/4 cup applesauce in place of butter, raisins instead of dates, 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup white flour, and added in a drizzle of honey and lots of ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and other "gingerbread" spices to taste. The result was delightfully gingerbready! Next time I will leave it in for less than an hour so it is a little less dry, and use less salt.

I baked mine in a small toaster oven for 50 minutes instead of an hour and it turned out fine.  Smaller ovens concentrate the heat better I suppose.  I left out the dates because I could not find any at the time.  I would make this one again, but make the coffee flavor a lot stronger.

This is the dark date bread that I remember from my childhood. It is also very similar to a bread that my neice used to make. (but she guarded that recipe from everyone!) So glad I tried it. The  coffee gives it that extra something and makes it the dark color I remember. Going to make this for our cookie/candy/bake sale at church next month!

This is a great recipe.  To make it even better, make a brandy sauce and pour it over the cake/muffins when they come out of the oven.
This is great for Thanksgiving, Christmas or a special occasion.  Serve with clotted cream.

Sauce:  1 1/4 cup  soft brown sugar
1 tablespoon  butter
3/4 cup water
1 cinnamon stick
1 teaspoon vanilla essence
Pinch of salt
1/2 cup brandy
Method:
Heat the butter, sugar and water and stir until the sugar disolves.
Increase heat and boil for 1 minute and add the cinnamon stick.
Remove the mixture from the stove and stir in the brandy, vanilla and salt.
Leave to infuse while the cake is baking.
When the cake is baked, remove the cinnamon stick from the syrup and pour over the pudding.

Delicious!
I didnt have any nuts around so i left those out, replaced the dates that i didnt have with a mixture of raisins and prunes, and also swirled some cinnamon into the batter. Turned out wonderfully!

I tried this recipe and love it. I cheated and baked it in the bread machine. OOooops! a large section stuck to the bottom but tasted so good. Its wonderfully moist and has a rich flavor. My 3yr old loves it toasted with butter...he thinks its chocolate. It must be good for a 3yr old to eat dates! I will make again for sure.

Very very good. I used high quality medjool dates and pitted them myself. The loaf was absolutely delicious I thought.. it almost tasted like chocolate. However, you will find a few people who do not care for it. I will make it again for me, but I won't give it out as gifts like I had planned.

The coffee gives this bread a great flavor (I used decaf coffee) and the texture is wonderful.  I ate the leftovers with a little bit of whipped cream cheese.  Had my family and friends over for dinner and everyone requested the recipe.   A++++ recipe.  Thank you Karen for sharing.  I'll make this recipe again and again.

I too love this recipe!! But I have a different take. I searched recalling (barely) the ingredients I knew from old Pillsbury recipe book I'd lost long ago and MOMSRIGHT popped up. FANtastic! My Mom prefers walnuts and I recall my Pillsbury recipe used-4 cups-in ONE loaf pan. Can you imagine? Well, walnut and sick-to-death-of-jellied-fruit-fruit-cakes will tell you--its a master stoke of a replacement! carefully combine 4C of whole walnut halves (English, not black) into the recipe last and then fold into your pan.   YUMMM  Thanks, MOMSRIGHT

Terrific.  I did mistakenly use 4 TBSP. of butter in this recipe.  I added the coffee/date mixture all at once and had to work a bit to eliminate lumps from the batter so next time would add it gradually.

I substituted white sugar with brown, used a Batangas Brewed Coffee granules (the famous Philippine Kapeng Barako). And omitted the nuts.
The loaves were really glossy and dark, rustic-looking. And tasted like fruitcake. It’s a perfect Holiday gift indeed and the taste is exquisite...

My family (including my toddler), and coworkers love this bread. I also added an additional 1/2 cup dates and tent the bread with aluminum foil half way through, I’ve found that tip to be very helpful and would recommend that :)

Not only is this is a unique & delicious quick bread, but because of all the dates, it's very filling and you don't get that carb-hangover shortly after.  Love it!

I followed this recipe but used brown sugar and 1.5 c of dates. It is very moist. I have to say, though, that I couldn't taste the dates and I was looking for a good date bread or cake. It tasted ok, just  not at all what I was expecting.

This is my new all time favorite holiday bread recipe.  So delicious and takes me back to fond childhood memories of wonderful date nut bread served at a lovely tea room my mom used to take to lunch sometimes.  They served it with cream cheese spread which goes really well with this bread.  Such a quick and easy recipe and really delicious!  I highly recommend it.  I think even if you aren't a big date fan, you'll love this bread.  Freezes really well and  great for gift giving.  I make it in mini loaf pans.  I split the batter in half before adding the nuts and put walnuts in one half and pecans in the other half.

Best date nut bread I've ever made! Rich, moist, and delicious. I substituted walnuts for pecans because that's what I had on hand. No doubt I'll be making this regularly. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Very good.  I made it vegan by using earth balance spread and 1/4 cup applesauce + 1/2 tsp extra baking soda in place of the butter and egg.  I also used date sugar (ground dehydrated dates), whole wheat flour, and stovetop-brewed "cowboy" coffee with great results.

I reduced the sugar to 1/3 c soft brown sugar because I read some reviews saying this was quite sweet and wanted something not too sweet.  Its taste is great because the coffee comes through and it is not too sweet, but the texture was very tough on the day. It was great the next day though. I may have over-mixed, or maybe it was because I used margarine.  I also did not find it as moist as everyone else.  I may make it exactly as per the recipe and give it one more shot (got lots of dates at home at the moment and would like something healthy, not puddings)!

A very good bread.  I made it on Christmas Eve and we have 2 pieces left. I am hiding these pieces for Christmas morning breakfast for myself(don't tell anyone).  I totally enjoyed this bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

I approached this recipe expecting to only make a few modifications. Mainly, I didn't want to use coffee as the liquid as I wanted more pure date flavor to come through. I ended up modifying it more because I felt the batter seemed too "soupy" after I'd mixed it up. 

I ended up using a cup of boiling hot whole milk instead of coffee, using brown sugar instead of white, adding an extra tbsp. of butter, adding an extra half cup of flour, and about a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.

Making these modifications caused it to rise well and not turn out as dark as the pictured loaf. It was very good and not the least bit dense. Those who were unhappy with how dense the loaf was may want to add just a bit more fat and more flour.

This did not bake properly.  I had it in the oven for longer than the specified time, and the middle was very doughy.  The taste was ok though, on the ends where it was baked!

Very, very good. You can really taste the coffee. I left out the pecans, and I made nine muffins instead of a loaf. I baked them for 30 minutes. Perfect!

I made this recipe, but made it as muffins.  Baked for about 25 minutes vs. the hour for the loaf.  Brought them to work and my coworkers went crazy for them.  The coffee is such a great counterpart to the sweetness of the dates.  Very moist and flavorful!

Delicious!!! I used more dates and chopped them finely. It was moist and very tasty. You could really taste the coffee.
As for loaf breads...I usually cook it at a lower temperature and for a bit longer then suggested as I find they never get cooked correctly in the middle. I did it with this. Perfect!!!

Yum! It doesn’t taste like the coffee but it adds a warm/cocoa-y impression. 

Alterations to recipe: 1 1/2 cups chopped dates, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1/3 cup dark brown sugar. Replaced 1/2 cup of white flour with sprouted whole wheat flour. Sprinkled top with a dessert spice blend that had cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg, sugar. Baked in my trusty OLD dark metal loaf pan and it was nicely done in about 55 minutes.

Very good nut bread.  I used dried chopped figs because that what I had and it was delish.   Maybe I'll try a little dash of cinnamon the next time I make it.

My whole family LOVED this bread! The first attempt I followed the recipe, the second time I did 1/2 honey 1/2 sugar instead of a full cup of sugar. I think it was even better! Next time I think I’m going to just go all honey. The second time I also blended the coffee/dates coursely instead of chopping the dates, it gave the bread a smoother consistency instead of chunks of dates that sank to the bottom.

The only change i made was decreased the dates to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup apricots which added just a bit of tang. Great recipe, very moist and delicious.  Thank you

This the best quick bread recipe I have ever tried. It is moist and delicious! I will never made another banana nut bread again!!! The coffee gives it an almost smokey flavor. My husband ate it all in three days!  I did add about a cup and a half of dates, rather than the cup. 

I made it a second time, and added unsweetened coconut flakes. It made the bread a little more dry, but the flavor was fantastic.!  I should also note that I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, and 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour, as I do with most recipes.

I was in a hurry trying to toss together a quick and easy sweet snack and this coffee date bread was perfect! I chopped up the dates and heated them up with the baking soda in the coffee to save time. Everything else was so quick and easy that in minutes it was in the oven! The pan was a bigger, shallower dish, so it really only needed to bake 45 minutes from the time I turned the oven on to a knife inserted in the center came out clean! I took one slice, cut it into thirds and tried it plain, which was moist and flavorful, one with just butter, which was delicious, and the third piece with butter and honey, because dates and honey just belong together and that was pure bliss!! Enjoy this delicious recipe for yourself!!

Delicious bread, I couldn't really taste the coffee like I thought I would so will make again with stronger coffee.  I added an extra half a cup of dates and it turned out wonderfully.

Can I give you six stars? This was quite simple to make and unbelievably delicious. The strong coffee blunts the super-sweetness of the dates in a great way. I used a combo of slivered almonds and whole cashews for the nuts. My son sliced off a piece and put it into the toaster and loved the crispier edges--toasting made the house smell so good again. This is a really, really good tea bread. Maybe next time I might add some grated orange peel just for a variation but the recipe written as it is will do just fine.

I tried this to go with orange marmalade. I didn't have parchment paper or vanilla. I put a little orange zest and juice half an orange. it came out perfect.

Awesome flavor! it was real good and I'd make this again for sure. Only thing I changed was to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and add 1/4 cup flour. this way they came out great and not as super sweet. Thanks for the good bread.

I made this bread today…and in almost 50 years of baking it's, I really think, the BesT ever. Oiling the pan made the outside just slightly crispy…while the inside was moist and way past delicious. At one point, I wondered if there would be enough liquid in the recipe…but after stirring…it was perfect. Thanks MOMZRIGHT!

Really loved this recipe, I had to cook mine for an hour and 15 minutes though to cook all the way through. I also added brown sugar and cinnamon to top the bread. Definitely a great recipe and will make again the next time I get dates.

I just needed to get rid of these dates...nobody likes them in my family (and I suppose these dates were not of the best quality). And I hoped that pastry with dates would be better than dates themselves. It's a most disappointing delusion. If you don't like some foodstuff just stand it as a treat for your guests or throw away after all. But don't use it in your recipes, you'll just waste all other ingredients. 
Anyway I baked this bread. Used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and other 3/4 cup of white sugar. Well, that's too much, the bread with all these dates and sugar is over sweet. I think 1/2 cup of sugar (no matter white or brown) will be enough. But anyway it's not bad, it's moist and tasty...quite good for the date bread.
I won't bake it next time not because it's a bad recipe but just because I don't like dates.

This bread was excellent. The only change I made was by accident-- I poured the batter in the pan and put it in the oven, and realized two minutes later that I hadn't put any pecans in. Instead I ended up sprinkling some flaked almonds over the top and gently mixing them in, so as not to disturb the edges already touching the pan. People were fighting over slices of this. Thank you!

I liked this recipe.I also changed a little bit to suit my style. I added olive oil instead of butter, put brown sugar, and replaced all purpose flour with wheat flour. Even then it came out good, Thanks.

I added coconut, cut the sugar in half and added a teaspoon of cinnamon.  It's a little drier than most of my breads turn out but pretty good!  Next time I'll add some applesauce.

My husband's word for this bread was "scrumptious"!   I wasn't sure if my baking soda was "young" enough so I added 1 tsp. baking powder.  I'm picky about my date nut bread and this is the best I've tasted.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I used splenda because I am watching my calories; didn't think it would come out but it did, and it was wonderful.  I didn't have pecans, so I used chopped walnuts. Excellent. Husband loves it!  I will always be making this.

Very good! Looks great, dates are delicious. Very runny when pouring it into the pan, and for me took just over an hour to bake, but the result was very well received by all! Thanks.

I was looking for a recipe made with coffee as I lost my original recipe so I thought I would try this one and it came out pretty good. The only thing that was wrong and it might have been my fault as the sides of the bread were too dark so I think I should have baked it less.  I will definitely make this again because it was moist and had a nice flavor to it.

This was great. I do wish it was a bit more moist but it was good all the same.
