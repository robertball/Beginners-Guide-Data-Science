I used old fashioned oats and they turned out great. More crunchy outside but chewy inside. Better texture on day two.

A very good recipe! I have made it twice now, the second time with my 11 yr old granddaughter. It's an easy one to make with kids especially when short on time

I'm not a big fan of peanut butter with chocolate, but my hubby is so I tried these.  He liked them but I thought they were way too sweet.  I also thought the peanut butter really overpowered the chocolate flavor.  Maybe more chocolate and less peanut butter would improve it.
