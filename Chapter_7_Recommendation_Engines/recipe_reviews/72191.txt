I read the reviews and made it a little bit different too.  I made a bit of a cheese sauce.  2 tablespoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of flour and a 1/4 cup of milk then I put in the can of mushroom soup, and about 2 tablespoons of sour cream.  Then I add shredded cheese, cheddar and monterey jack.  I also added for the spice about 3 tsps of Montreal Steak Spice.  It turned out really well that way.

This was ok...honestly it tasted a lot like the Hamburger Helper box stuff.  I don't like using my "good ingredients" and getting that end result.  Very cheesy as another reviewer said...and didn't taste a whole lot like philly cheesesteak to us.  Thanks anyway for the post.

I made this for my 80 year old dad and hes not shy about telling me if he likes something or not. He liked it. I used a box of velveeta mac and cheese for the macaroni and the cheese then I added  two handfulls of Mozzarella cheese..and a clove of minced garlic.  It was pretty good. Thanks!

I used yellow peppers for this and Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom. Nice flavors, really cheesy. A good from scratch way to copycat Hamburger Helper.  Thanks for the recipe.

One of my hubby's favorites.  I use ground turkey and Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom instead of regular.  The first time I made it with just the regular Cream of Mushroom, it was very salty.  I have also used whole wheat pasta as a way to make it a little healthier.

First, I didn't measure my macaroni - I used 1 pound, which I believe is very close to 2 cups.  As is, it wasn't cheese enough for me, so I added a cup of mozz./prov. blend shredded.  That really helped out.  It is still a little bland for me, so next time I will add beef bouillin, to help the beef flavor stand out.  Good start, but needed some modifications for my taste.

Wasn't bad... was pretty comparible to a name brand boxed dinner where you add meat though.  My husband called this a chuckwagon dinner and gave it 3.5 stars.  My 4 yr old and 2 yr old ate it like there was no tomorrow... that's good enough for me to make it again!  I didn't have cream of muchroom soup so I used cream of potato which actually gave this a really nice hearty flavor.  For the noodles and processed cheese I used a box of velveta shells and cheese and it did the trick wonderfully.  I also omitted the green pepper as I don't have any and my kids wouldn't eat it anyway.  This is a keeper strictly for "in a pinch" but it lacks ebough flavor to keep it in my recipe book for good.

This was quick, cheap and easy.  Gourmet it is not, but is anything with processed cheese food expected to be gourmet? I would make it again.

I am from PA, so I love Philly Cheesesteaks, and this was a nice alternative!  I used Velveeta shredded cheese instead of cubed...it was hit with the kids too!

This was pretty good for a fast and easy meal.  It DID taste kind of Hamburger Helper-ish, but I was kind of expecting that based on the ingredients involved.  I certainly knew that it wasn't going to taste like a true Philly cheesesteak.  The only change that I made was to add a few extra seasonings.  My kids loved it and DH and I ate it, so I will keep it on hand for nights when I'm feeling uninspired.  Thanks!

Well, tonight I made this for dinner and it was a HUGE hit with my husband! He said it was a definite do-over and he hopes we have it over and over and over. He also said it is one of those recipes that you can add whatever you want to it to change it up, and he is right! Tonight, though, I followed the recipe exactly. I am NOT a fan of "processed cheese product" and that was a big turn off for me so next time I will use 1/2 real cheese and 1/2 "cheese product" for the creamy texture to see if I like the flavor better. I think pepper jack cheese would make a real statement with this dish as well. I am definitely going to be making this again..and again..and again....! Thanks for a quick meal that was a hit!

Not a bad recipe all round, I didn't add the green pepper because I didn't have any on hand. Everything else was okay, wish there was more spice/flavour but would make this again and change it up a little.

I followed the recipe but I found it a bit dry to serve. I mixed up an extra can of mushroom soup and milk and added it. This made it perfect. This was what I've been looking for.

This was a pretty good dish and I would make it again.  I did not have a lot of Velveeta on hand, so I mostly used shredded Colby jack cheese.  I will definitely make it again but will probably tweak it a bit to give it more flavor.

We thought this was a good, basic, quick and easy weeknight meal.  As others have said, it is very much like a hamburger helper meal, but it's not processed powdered "stuff"...it's real ingredients.  So, being "like" that is okay with me, as long as I'm not eating a bunch of chemicals!

Our kids (9&7) enjoyed this as well, with our 7yo picking out the peppers.  I'll make this again.

I have made something similar using Cream of Chicken which adds flavor plus use Shredded Cheddar for the cheese, and instead of adding macaroni, pour over cooked noodles, and top with shredded cheddar and brown in oven. Have served to the ladies in my card group, and they truly enjoyed it.

This was a good meal.  I used bow tie pasta because that's what I had.  I'm not a big fan of processed cheese, so I just put in a couple handfuls of shredded cheddar instead.  As casseroles go, it's good.

It was okay.  I didn't really get a "cheesesteak" feel from it.  It was good once - but I doubt it'll make it into my regular rotation.

Too cheesy, so if that is what you are looking for, you'll love it.
