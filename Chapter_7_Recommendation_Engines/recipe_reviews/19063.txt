This recipe was a bit disappointing for me due to the other reviews.  It's good, but it's missing something.  It definitely needs some salt and I would most likely use real whipped cream instead of cool whip in the future.

VERY Peanut Buttery, everyone better absolutely love peanut butter for this to go over at your next party. I used 10 chopped Reeses Peanut Butter Cups instead of the peanut butter chips and I salted the filling to taste (because I thought it tasted a little flat). The next time I think I will whip 8 oz of heavy cream instead of using the cool whip. The real test is when I serve it tonight to my niece and nephew who are peanut butter addicts!!!!

Haven't had this yet, but had the stuff on hand, so I am having it for dessert tonight.  I love peanut butter and cream cheese so it has got to be good.  I will let you know.
