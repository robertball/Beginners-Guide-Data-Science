One word, awesome!  I added some red bell pepper, some basil, and topped with sharp provolone cheese instead of the parmasean.  There were no leftovers even though it was just me and my husband - - - it was that good!

It was good, but not amazing.  

Pancetta Bacon: It will be very difficult for most people to find at the local grocery store.  It is a fancy style of bacon that is made from the same cuts as standard bacon but is generally more expensive and curred over a longer period of time using salt.  Regular bacon will suffice.

This recipe was interesting and had good flavor but lacked the kick I usually look for.  I DO recommend everyone trying this at least once.  This will not be a part of my regular rotation.

My husband and I LOVED THIS.  I'm a very inexperienced cook, and my new year's resolution was to cook a lot more. This couldn't have been easier, and the taste seems sophisticated, to my inexperienced palate. I would even serve this to my mother in law, if she weren't a heartless hag!

This was good but made only two servings.  I used procuitto instead of bacon.

I used 4 cheese tortellini & I didn't have pancetta so I subbed some diced prosciutto instead. I'm pretty sure that the reviewers who said that the 2 tbp. olive oil was a typo & that balsamic vinegar should be used instaed are correct but I love browned butter & took the suggestion to add 2 tbp. of that (in addition to the balsamic vinegar.) I also added some minced garlic & some italian seasoning. This was far from bland...even my 3 year old grandson liked it. But he has a sophisticated palate for his age & he is very appreciative of anything we cook together. All in all, it was a nice change of pace for lunch.

This was really fast and easy.  We probably waited too long after sprinkling on the balsamic vinegar to eat it.  The vinegar had soaked into the pasta and wasn't very strong.  But this was a great way to cut out the fattening alfredo sauce I usually serve with tortellini.  I will make this again.

This recipe is SO easy!  I doubled it and served it to friends, one evening, for a last-minute dinner party.  I couldn't find the pancetta bacon at my local grocery store and didn't have the time to go to the Italian grocer so I substituted proscuitto ham for the bacon.  Everyone raved over the recipe.  It's definitely one I'll use again and again...next time with the bacon, though!

This recipe is so quick and easy - and was met with rave reviews from my husband and three boys (5 years old and younger).  I varied from the recipe by tossing the pasta with browned butter instead of olive oil.  Yum!

I cannot say enough good things about this. I have no idea what pancetta bacon tastes like, but regular bacon seems to work fine...I would give 20 stars if I could. I used Schwan's 6-Cheese tortellini and added the tiniest dash of garlic powder; everything else (bar the bacon) was as stated. Also it was super fast, I walked in the door and 35 minutes later I was sitting down with a plate! Awesome. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe! :) UPDATE: I made this again for a friend, this time I added a chopped roma tomato and some corn. Great addition to make this a complete lunch, with a side of fresh baked bread.

I substituted bacon, but recently spied pancetta in the grocery store, so will try that.  This got rave reviews from the guests I served it to.  I was sad there were no leftovers.

YUM! We really loved this! I love tortellini - and it's easy, another big plus in my opinion :) I had to use prosciutto in place of the pancetta bacon so I don't know how that compares, but we thought it tasted great. We'll have this again. I might like to try adding spinach next time, the flavor would work well with spinach.

Wow! I have been making this dish for years so it's nice to see a recipe for it. I first made it when I didn't know what to do with some odd ingredients I had but when I put it all together it worked. 
Variations I have made: 
As others have said I think the pancetta is the best but you can use bacon or prosciutto. 
Olive oil or butter can be used to brown the onion. 
For more flavor: Add garlic salt (or powder), pepper, and whatever other spices you want to the onion/pancetta mixture! For a mild kick paprika is a nice addition. ... my boyfriend often likes to add hot sauce on occasion. 
**You can also add some of the balsamic vinegar so the onion mixture near the end of cooking to reduce it a little which makes it sweater

Very delicious! Relatively easy to make with changes. Next time I'll cook the panceta first. It seemed to take forever and the onions were done long before it was. Also, the adding the tortellini's back to the fry pan is completely unnecessary and messy. They stick the bottom and everything is already warm anyway. Lastly, I won't add the parmasean.  It didn't really add anything to the recipe and wouldn't be missed.

I made this but added to it.  I have a simliar recipe that calls for ground italian sausage, sweet red pepper and broccoli.  It's awesome. You have to like the Balsamic vinegar to truly appreciate.  The broccoli florets hold the flavor and are the best part.

This is a wonderful recipe. I fry up regular bacon, chopped into small pieces, along with the onion. I add the olive oil again once I put the tortellini and the bacon/onion mixture together, then toss with the vinegar and top with shredded parmesan. I serve each time with crusty french bread. I love this recipe. Thank you so much for this!!! 3/6/04- I am a vegetarian now and used the meatless bacon and it was just as good! The bacon tastes verys simliar to the real thing-I added a bit more balsalmic to add more flavor- happy I can keep using this recipe with my new lifestyle.

I think part of the recipe is wrong. At the bottom, when she recommends two more TBL of olive oil, it should be balsamic vinegar. I also used proscuitto and was very good that way. Nice change from Alfredo. Double to make more than 2 servings.

I added an extra tablespoon of vinegar and cheese and it was wonderful but what the heck is panetta bacon?  I used regular thick bacon and it was very good.

My family REALLY enjoyed this recipe! It was quick and very tasty. We're huge balsamic vinegar fans so we really enjoyed the tang of it and will be making again! The directions were a tad confusing with the 2Tof oil in #3, I just used a sprinkle to "coat" the tortellinis and then added the balsamic. I also subbed bacon for the pancetta. My toddler LOVED it, I was uncertain so gave him some without the balsamic and some with and to my surprise he wouldn't eat the plain ones but devoured the ones with balsamic vinegar. Thanks for an excellent recipe!!

This was much better than I anticipated. Will even serve to guests as a special dinner option. I used regular bacon as I didn't have pancetta. I added a cube of my homemade pesto, fresh garlic and sliced fresh mushrooms with a little hit of chilli flakes. YUM, YUM.

I think the 9oz bag tortellini is a typo? The 19 oz bag lists as being for 4 servings on the bag.  Anyways, I used the 19 oz bag and it turned out wonderful.  Didn't have any bacon so left that out.  Added a little garlic and Italian seasoning for something extra.  Good recipe that you can play with.

I have tried this recipe several different times and ways and everyone has always loved it.  I can't have onions so I substituted with a little garlic salt and garnished with fresh chopped plum tomatoes at the end.  I also use just regular bacon.  One of the best dishes I have tried yet!

I just made this the other night and we loved it!!  We are big fans of Balsamic vinegar so I knew it would be good.  We like our bacon crunchy so I ended up microwaving it with the onion (and garlic that I added) after I had already fried it to get the right "crunch".  I didn't have cheese tortellini so I used some that was stuffed with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese.  It was very good.  Will definitely make this again soon!

We loved this recipe.  I made a few changes.  Someone else pointed out that there might be a mistake at the end, instead of 2 tablespoons of olive oil, I added balsamic vinaigrette.  I did not have any bacon, so I used real bacon, bacon bits in a jar.  I added a little more olive oil at the end to make it less dry.  Delicious!!

I had a horrible time with this recipe. I followed the instructions carefully and ended up with an oily, gooey mess. I am not going to try this again.

We enjoyed this, although felt it was a little dry for our taste.  It's just enough for two people, assuming you have bread or something else on the side - next time I'll double the recipe and probably have leftovers.

Simple and Delicious! I prepared this recipe for my wife and myself, we fell in love with the first bite. I added mushrooms, used regular bacon and served with garlic toast. I also used a little extra balsamic vinager when served. We both fought over left overs to take to lunch the next day.

I made this for my mother for her birthday and she loved it! It was so good! I used a 20oz package of tortellini and adjusted the ingredients accordingly, except I did add a little extra balsamic vinegar just because my family likes really flavorful dishes. I also wasn't able to get my hands on pancetta so I used a thick-cut regular bacon instead. My parents ate this up and my mom asks for it every week--definitely give it a try!

Guests were coming over for dinner.  Pulled up this recipes for a last minute dish with tortellini.  Didn't have the pancetta but had pepper bacon and all other ingredients.  My guests were so impressed with this recipe and I was too.  This is definitely a keeper.

This is a fast and flavorful dish.  However, I think that either using a basic pasta OR using some of the pasta water to make it more moist is the way to go.  Tortellini tends to be a dryer pasta and this "sauce" is also dry.  Next time I would use bow-ties AND add about 1/2 cup of the pasta water in.

So good!!!  I made this as a side dish to chicken. it was wonderful. I didn't measure the balsamic though, I just kept adding to taste. Even my husband loved it and he isn't crazy about tortellini. Thanks for this!

I did this with steak instead of bacon, because that's what I had on hand and it was still pretty tasty, and a quick and filling meal.  We used a high quality, aged balsamic vinegar which was the star in this - don't go cheap on the vinegar, as it makes the dish!

I thought this recipe was excellent. I made a few changes, though. 

First, I made it vegetarian by cutting out the bacon. Instead, I fried some red pepper next to the onion, and put some balsamic vinegar on the pepper as it was cooking. I put the balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese on to taste, rather than following the amounts. And finally, I used fresh parmesan cheese, which I think really makes anything tastier. It was great. I'd definitely make it again.

This recipe is excellent!!!  I used prosciutto instead of pancetta also and it was awesome.  I used a half a pound and a 20 ounce package of tortellini.  I also made some additions which enhanced the recipe and it was so good.

Here they are:
I added minced garlic
I added sun-dried tomatoes
I added fresh sliced mushrooms

It really makes it a meal when you add the extra ingredients and I have been letting my family add their own balsamic vinegar so that it suits their taste.

Excellent recipe...I have already made twice in the last 2 weeks.

Thank you for sharing it.

I made some enhancements to this recipe that served very well.  First of all, I doubled it-my hubby is a big eater!  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a teaspoon each of oregano, basil and garlic powder.  These additions added great flavor and texture and worked really well with the balsamic vinegar and bacon.

This recipe was okay.  My husband and I ate it, but it seemed to be missing something.  He asked me to not make it again.  If I try this recipe again, I think I might add mushrooms or, garlic or, pinenuts.

There were mixed reviews around the table.  We did add fresh spinach to the final saute and a little garlic which added to the flavors.  If you like balsamic vinegar (I prefer balsamic vinagrette for a slight sweeter taste) but overall, the members with a more developed palate found it delicious!

This is a keeper. It is a great twist on plain ole cheese tortellini. The only changes I made were to saute the onion in the bacon drippings. I also added more balsamic than it called for to give it a bit more flavor since I used a larger pack of pasta. It was a hit with my husband and 10 year old daughter who both had two helpings. Very yummy!

Quite tasty, and I will definitely make again. Though I did make some alterations. Since I have a small skillet, I cooked the bacon by itself instead of with the onion. When it was done, I removed the bacon to let it dry, and used the bacon grease to cook the onions in (also added red bell pepper and two cloves of garlic). Other alterations include adding a small amount of mustard and basil to the balsamic vinegar and adding minced black olives.

Awesome, easy recipe. Great with guests. I added a red pepper for some colour and a bit of feta cheese on top with the parmesan...its also nice with rainbow coloured tortellini and procuitto instead of bacon. Delicous!

This was pretty good for a change. I doubled the amount of pasta, pancetta (regular bacon would work just as well), olive oil and vinegar. I added a clove of garlic and some spinach. Could've cut back on a little of the olive oil and vinegar in my opinion.

It was a nice change - I thought the flavor was good. Family liked it, but didn't love it.  I didn't use bacon at all.  I knew my family would not like that, but followed all other ingredients.

This was a great recipe - I'm always looking for pasta without tomato sauce and this is a great go-to for me.  I also added peas because I think they go well with tortellini.

I didn't use any bacon, but I did add a chopped up red bell pepper. In the future, I'll probably omit that, since the sweetness of the pepper didn't contrast well with the balsamic vinegar. Overall though, it was good -- my two year old ate two helpings!

I was a little skeptical with the balsamic, but it was great! I left out the bacon (didn't want to run to the store) and added a tomato, spinach, garlic, and a little dried basil. Perfect! Some people said they thought the 2T of olive oil in the directions was an error and it should be vinegar, so I did 1T of each.

This recipe is awesome!!  I always subsitute bacon, but that's my preference.  I have added peas to the mix and it's a great way to get your vegitable in.  I cannot get enough of this recipe.  Tonight I am going to add some artichoke hearts instead of peas and see how it goes.  Thanks for the recipe.

What a great recipe!  I loved the different flavors.  I omitted the onions for personal preference and used regular bacon and it still came out wonderful!  I will be making this again.

I really liked this, and even more important, my husband liked it more!  I used 4 slices thick-sliced bacon (too lazy to go to grocery store for pancetta), no onion, and added peas & fresh basil to the "sauce."  I should have used more vinegar, but that was my own fault.  Will make again & again!  Thanks Kimber!

6/21/11 update - Husband does the grocery shopping, and I goofed by asking for 5 ounces of pancetta, rather than 5 slices.  Well, you can never have too much pork product, so I went ahead and used it all.  Still left out the onion, but stuck to the recipe otherwise.  Delish!

We modified the recipe by using regular bacon. What an excellent meal; very easy to make. My husband and I loved it. For an extra kick, dress it with pasta sauce and enjoy with slice of buttered honey wheat or pumpernickel bread.

I had not made this in a while and decided to serve it for guests last week.  Once again - RAVE reviews.  They are still asking for the recipe!  I made a few changes - used turkey bacon (one guest is on a low-fat diet).  Microwaved it and added to the onions after sauteing.  Added @ 1/4 Cup of wine and reduced it some.  Took skillet off burner and tossed tortellini with other ing. - adding balsamic vinegar at that time.  Pour into big pasta bowl and add more vinegar and cheese and toss.  Was great re-heated next day!!

This dish is okay, but I agree with other reviewers that it needs something else to add flavor.  Maybe the garlic or red pepper would help.  Is it two more tablespoons of oil later or is it vinegar?

I added regular bacon, and more than the recipe called for.  I also threw in some sun-dried tomatoes, because they make EVERYTHING taste better.  This was very good and I would probably make it again.

I made the recipe with 4 slices of chopped bacon (I had a 20oz packet of tortellini) instead of the pancetta and it was wonderful!  I also added 4 chopped cloves of garlic with the onions and bacon.

This is a very good base recipe, although a 9 oz package of tortellini is a very small serving size for 4 people. I used a 20 oz family pack and roughly doubled the other ingredients. I also added minced garlic, dried basil, & a can of drained chopped tomatoes. The results were fabulous!

I changed this a bit, like using regular bacon and plain red wine vinegar (OK, that defeats that "balsamic" thing but I didn't have any), and I added a little Italian seasoning.  It was very easy, and it's always nice to find recipes using tortellini, and it was a decent little meal, but not the most exciting thing I've made... I agree with other comments that it tends toward bland and I think just adding the It. seasoning helped.

Not a bad little meal. I recommend cutting the bacon up into smaller pieces. The balsamic vinegar on its own renders the dish a little dry and tasteless. Adding some garlic will give the flavours a lift, but next time I'll probably add a low-fat cheese sauce.

Absolutely delicious.  My sons loved it.  Although I only had meat tortellini on hand and turkey bacon (health conscious), but it tasted great just the same.  Definitely will make again and again.  This time with the cheese tortellini.

I'm not making this one again.  Although it was really very easy, I felt like it was totally tasteless.  It was definitely missing something, if not missing everything.  I don't recommend this one, I was expecting something with more taste, and ended up with a very bland dish.

DELISH!!  I've made this twice now.  I doubled the recipe for my husband and I was we're pigs when it comes to pasta.  I used cheese ravioli and a 1/2 c. prosciutto and 1/4 c. balsamic vinegar.  Flavors meld together nicely.  Will definitely make this again and again as it's easy, delicious and fast!

Pretty good. I added tomatoes and fresh basil. It's only 2 servings, not 4. Not an outstanding dish but a good standby on those nights when you have very little time.

This was really, really great! I used bacon instead of pancheta and I added garlic powder and Italian seasoning. Definitely will be making this again and again!

Delicious and so easy!  I used spinach and cheese tortellini, white pearl onions and pancetta.

Easy and quick to make with ingredients I usually have around the house anyways.  We enjoyed it a lot and will be making it again.  Much healthier than the usual cream based sauce i use.

This is my husband's favorite recipe, hands down.  It's one of my faves, too, because there's not a lot of prep and the ingredient list is low.  I keep the pre-diced pancetta or prosciutto from the deli section on hand in the fridge along with tortellini so it's easy to throw together when I haven't had time to go to the store.  I usually add halved cherry tomatoes and baby spinach at the end and cover for a few minutes in order to add some extra veggies and color to the dish.  We usually fight over the leftovers (if there are any!)

so I used a 24-oz pkg of tortellini, kept it at one large onion, doubled the cheese and balsamic, and used 10 slices of regular bacon. I also added 6 oz or so of spinach with the onion, and sauteed those separate from the bacon. That much bacon takes a long time! the end result was good but not amazing. I agree with another poster that the cheese hardly comes through and isn't worth adding. Maybe if it was shredded instead of grated? probably wouldn't make again.

This was a total bomb at my house.  My 2 year old liked it but my 9 year old could hardly gag it down.  The balsamic was too powerful for us.  Be careful with that.  My husband thought it was pretty good.

We love this recipe at our house- it's fast, tasty, and can hold it's own in a pinch or it works with pork or chicken nicely.  I use prosciutto instead of pancetta or when we're really in a pinch diced ham seared in olive oil will suffice.  I also like to include a tablespoon of minced garlic.

This was pretty good, but didn't really have a lot of flavor. I used a large onion and about 10 slices of pancetta. I used the food processor to chop the pancetta, then the onion, then cook it in a frying pan. Very easy to make, but it needs something else. I'll try it again with some variations added per other reviewers since hubby bought a HUGE bag of tortellini at Sams and there's only 2 of us :)

Very easy and extremely quick.  You can boil the tortellini and fry the bacon and onions all at the same time if you like multi tasking.  I found this flavorful and good.  I added some capers for color.  I wanted to add basil but I don't have any more fresh leftover.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was wonderful.  I had a package of tortellini in the fridge and 10 minutes to make dinner.  I did not have bacon or anything so I just made the tortellini with the olive oil and balsamic with a sprinkle of parmesan.  My kids (8 and 5) gobbled it up.  I loved it too.  The balsamic gives an otherwise boring meal that extra zing.  It was a great meal and super easy and fast.  Way better than another trip through the drive thru!

This was fantastic! I omitted the bacon, instead we had it with chicken breast, and I added a small amount of heavy cream with the balsamic vinegar to give it a thicker, creamy texture. Very, very good. We will be having this again!

Loved it! Went from stove to dinner plate in less than 20 minutes!  I used bacon instead b/c that is what I had on hand...husband raved and it was nice to have something other than white/red sauce or plain olive oil.  Definitely added to the montly rotation!

When I was cooking this I wasn't too sure whether it would be any good, but it turned out wonderful! The only thing I changed was that I left out the onions, and I added more balsamic. If you can find the pancetta, get it. It's well worth it!

This was a really good fast meal. I wanted to use ingredients I had on hand, so I substituted ham for pancetta. I also sauted a clove of garlic and sliced mushrooms with the onion and ham. I added some frozen peas to the saute mixture just before tossing in the tortellini. The balsamic vinegar added a nice crisp taste. Thanks for the recipe.

A little greasy, but fantastic flavor.  I did finish the bacon in the micro since I was having a little trouble getting it to crisp up.

Don't you love it when people completely change the recipe and then rave how good YOUR recipe is?! I will suggest two things. Use chicken/prosciutto tortellini (available at Wal-Mart) and buy a bottle of Lucini balsamic (available at SuperTarget). You won't regret it.

Great base recipe.  Made some changes. I used turkey bacon bc thats all I had.  I cooked it up with the onions and removed them from pan.  Added some sliced mushrooms, olive oil and 1 tbsp of butter and sauteed until tender.  Added a few TBSP of red wine while cooking the mushrooms.  After the shrooms were tender, I added the bacon onion mixture  back to the pan and mixed all with the tortellini and sprinkled with the balsamic.  Topped with Italian cheese crumbles.  YUMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!

Pretty Good.  Quick and Easy.  But not amazing.  I'll use it again as a quick weeknight dinner, but maybe not for company.

This recipe sounded great to me, but it didn't turn out that well.  The sauce needed more than just the balsamic vinegar.  It was too thin and the vinegar taste was a little strong.  I won't be making it again.

Not very good.  I ended up eating this alone since no one else wanted any of it.  Made as directed, just not a hit here.  Gave it 2 stars since I didn't throw it away.

Pretty good. I didn't have pancetta and mistakenly put in 5 slices of regular bacon instead. Too much bacon and too much onion for the 9 oz package. I'll make again but use less bacon and onion. Great side dish!

Very tasty, I used ravioli (meat and cheese) instead of tortellini.  This has sort of a polish flavor and reminded me of pieroghies, or sausage and sauerkraut.  Not what I expected, but quite yummy.

This was a very good meal.  I used cheese and spinach tortellini and half the onion.  I also left out the bacon.  My mother and my boyfriend loved it.  I will definately make this again.

I made a couple of minor alterations, but none that would have affected the taste of the dish (ie. I used ravioli instead of tortellini and I used bacon instead of pancetta).  This dish was not good at all - the bacon needs to be cooked before adding the onion otherwise the onion will burn before the bacon gets crispy.  As well, we found that there wasn't alot of flavour apart from balsamic vinegar - it overpowered the flavour of everything in the dish.

This was "OK" to me. My kids picked at it and my wife thought it was alright. It is kind of bland in my opinion. Very easy to make. Quick too. Just not something I will cook again.

This was very tasty and a cinch to prepare. I didn't have any pancetta so I substituted three slices of thick cut bacon. I also had to sub garlic wine vinegar for the balsamic. Even with the changes this recipe is a keeper. Thanks!

This is one of my favorite recipes! It's so easy to throw together, especially for company.  I usually use a little extra pancetta--LOVE the flavor!  Experiment with more/less ingredients based on your likes/dislikes-you can't go wrong, however, I do suggest going by the orig. receipe to get the fullest flavor otherwise you will be disappointed.  Thank you so much for a wonderful dish!

I tried this recipe, but could not find the bacon at the store.  I tried canadian bacon, as suggested by a rater.  My family did not like it as it did not have much of a taste.  My husband would not even taste it!  Maybe it's better with the bacon that it called for.
