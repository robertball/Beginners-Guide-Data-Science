This is "my" drink!  Sometimes with a splash of coke. mmmmmmm  The 2 to 1 ratio is just right.

Excellent flavor-- and just the right ratio of coffee liqueur to vodka. For myself, I like a splash of milk on top, but my lactose intolerant husband likes it as is. Also great if you use vanilla vodka... yum!
