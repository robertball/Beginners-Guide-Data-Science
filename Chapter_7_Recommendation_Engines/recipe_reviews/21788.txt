This was a good soup.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth with 2 cups of water and I also threw in a chicken boullion cube.  I added 16 oz of frozen mixed veggies and just cooked my dry egg noodles on the stove and added them that way.  It's much faster!  I thickened this with some cornstarch.  Oh, and I added 1 tsp each of celery salt and garlic powder.  I thought it had a very nice flavor and was not at all bland.

GREAT - here were my modifications....followed recipe but used chicken broth instead of water and added 1 tbls poultry seasoning.  PERFECT.  Other personal notes....4 breast halves were too much, next time I'll use three.  I thickened mine with flour - took quite a bit, but came out perfect.

I made this first about a month ago and forgot to rate it. I've made it several times since then and made it different every time. Its super yummy and cheap, too for skinny-wallet-times. I added some baby carrots and thickened it a little and we ate it just like soup with crackers. Winter comfort food. This recipe is part of my base menu from now on....

I really liked this recipe.  It's not fancy or complex, but simple chicken and noodles.  Great for a lunch on a chilly day. I used 1 T. of cornstarch mixed with 1/4 c. of the broth to thicken it up and then added the noodles about an hour later.  I didn't remove anything before adding the noodles, either. It turned out like a thick, flavorful chicken noodle stew.  I will add more veggies next time just to get those daily servings in.  Also, I only used 2 chicken breasts (it's what we had in the house) and there was still a lot of chicken.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Kathy.

I doubled this recipe and used chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts. This is a good base recipe--I did add more chopped veggies and some additional spices. GREAT for a house full of people with a bad cold.

Like SusanKaty, I'm giving this recipe five stars because it is such a good base to build from.  I took many reviewer recommendations including celery salt, a couple of bay leaves,  and poultry seasoning.  My wife had chicken thighs (8 or so) in the slow cooker without a plan.  I cut a lemon into slices and let that cook for 45 minutes or so.  Then, after taking the chicken off of the bone and putting it back in the cooker, I added plenty of chicken broth, the reviewer spices (a teaspoon or so each) and a teaspoon of chicken bouillon.  To fix the gray color, I added 15 or 20 drops of yellow food coloring.  Near the end I added 3 or 4 tablespoons of cornstarch as a thickening agent.  I added one tablespoon (mixed with a little water or chicken broth in measuring cup), to the mixture, then let it sit for 5 minutes or so.  I continued that process until the mixture is at a desirable consistency.  By the way, the lemons I used on the chicken lended a wonderful flavor that spread to the entire mixture.  This recipe seems to have a wide margin for error.  In preparing this dish--after 3 years of learning to cook, I finally felt like I had enough confidence to deviate from the main recipe a bit.  This is a keeper.  Easy, easy, easy.

4 stars...and I haven't even tried it yet! I left it in the crock pot over night and just from looking and smelling it this morning I can tell it's a winner! I did make some recommended adjustement: 2 teas. old bay seasoning, 1 teas. celery salt, 1 teas. garlic salt. I did use low sodium chicken broth instead of water. I also added young peas and carrots and omitted the onion (we're not big fans).

Loved this one!! I was able to make the best chicken noodles ever!! I like a gravy rather than soup so i added the Tbls. of Corn Starch w/ water. I didnt have any frozen noodles so I used a bag of dry egg noodles and it turned out fine, noodles were a little soggy but the gravy sooo made up for it. I also added poultry seasoning, garlic, carrots and soup base(1/2 the required amount, next time i will use all).I didnt have a problem with graying or translucent veggies?? I suppose the soup base helped with color. 4 stars since I had to doctor it up.

I gave this five stars because it is an excellent "base" for a great chicken and noodles dish. It is very close to a dish that a college friend made.You can do a stew OR a soup with it.  It was a bit bland, so we added some celery salt, a tablespoon of chicken bullion & some garlic (a must in this house). I will add more veggies next time, and cut the chicken in half and use dark meat as well as a chicken breast. And since we couldn't find "frozen noodles", we used refrigerated "fresh" noodles, and they cooked up just fine on high in the crockpot the last ten minutes. Make sure all of your ingredients are added to your taste before the noodles are added.

I will definitely use this recipe again - THANKS!

Love this simple recipe, this is my 3rd time making.  However, I’m one of those hearty food eaters who like big chunks of meat in his food so I made mine with 5 ½ chicken breasts and used chicken stock instead of water, added some celery and carrots as well as Old Bay seasoning and I must tell you it’s great.  So if your man likes his soup big and hearty then and more chicken, you won’t regret it!

4 stars after adding some seasonig. I used one large onion and it was too much onion, and I love onion!! Switch the water for chicken broth. I added celery and carrots and used dry egg noodles. 12 oz was too much noodle for me and could have used more vegetables. I added salt, pepper, garlic and some "all" seasonin (mrs Braggs). I also prepared the noodles on the stove top right before we were ready to eat and just added them to the slow cooker.   I will definitely cook this soup again!!

I added just a touch of poultry seasoning at the end to round out the flavor.  My husband really loved this, and in the crock pot it was pretty effortless to make.  Definately will use this recipe again and again.

To Above poster, she did say how she thickened the soup in her opening discription. "or sometimes I like to thicken the juice with a little water and cornstarch mixture and let cook till thick".

This is a good basic recipe, but it definitely needs more spices and a few tweaks for us.  I wanted more of a soup so I cut the amount of chicken down to two breasts, which was plenty.  I also adjusted the broth amount to about 9 1/2 cups so that it would be soupy.  I added in garlic, a bullion cube, and poultry seasoning along with carrots and red & yellow peppers (I had them on hand and wanted to use them up).  I left it all in the slow cooker on low for 10 hours, then broke up the chicken (basically by stirring it) and added the noodles.  Mine weren't frozen, just dried, and they softened very quickly.  I think we'd prefer a heartier noodle--maybe tortellini or something, bc the egg noodles were just too soft for us when we were ready to eat.  Not bad, all in all, just requires a bit of adjustment for our tastes.  Thanks for the recipe!

PERFECT for this cold fall day!  Put it all in the crock pot (on high) before heading out to a bday party.  Got back 3 hours later and pulled the chicken out to slice.  We added orzo for about 20-30 minutes and YUMMMMMM!  I also opted for 4-5 boullian cubes and some bay leaves.  This is going STRAIGHT to my favorites!  THANKS SO MUCH!

Delicious!  I was short on time and cooked on high for 4 hours which was perfect.    I used all chicken broth instead of the water, and I cooked the noodles on the stovetop and added at the end.    I also added 1 Tbsp. of both garlic powder and basil leaves about halfway thru cooking, and a 1/2 cup of fresh, chopped parsley at the end.    We will definitely make again - my hubby loved it as much as I did!!  It smelled heavenly cooking all afternoon.

Love this recipe because you can customize it any way you want - I used 3 cans of chix broth and 2 cups water, cut up some baby carrots I had left over from a veggie tray - added 2 LARGE frozen chix breasts, and set the cooker for 7 hours - when I got home from work, I took out the chix breasts and while I let them cool - I cooked some noodles - then shredded the chix breasts back into the soup - I froze 1/2 of the soup (without the noodles) and then served up the rest by putting noodles in a bowl and using a ladle to pour soup over noodles - hearty and home made tasting - LOVED IT! Thanks for the idea of something other than a roast or chili in a slow cooker!

I made this soup and everyone in my family enjoyed it.  I did add sliced carrots and 1/4 c instant potatoes to thicken the broth.  I'll definitely make it again.  It's easy and I usually keep all of these ingredients on hand.

I loved this recipe. I added fresh mushrooms and carrots so I could get a few more vegetables in. It turned out great, and my one-year old son could not get enough of this. So easy to make, and so delicious.

With some tweaking, this was a 5 star recipe for sure! I like thick chicken and noodles, so I added a tbsp of cornstarch to the noodle mixture. I just used one HUGE chicken breast, and that was the perfect amount of chicken.

I used all chicken broth... no water... and it still tasted very bland. Didn't really like it at all. No flavor at all even though I felt like I had pretty heavily seasoned it with salt and pepper. Won't make it again.

Great Base, but I put my own little twist on it. 2-lbs Breast Tenders, 3 cups water, 2 cans broth, 1 bullion cube, 1-tsp poultry seasoning, 1-tsp chopped bay leaves, s+p, 1 onion chopped, 2-celery stalks chopped, 1 can early peas, 1 can cut green beans, 1 medium size bag of dry egg noodles. With the exception of the peas, beans, and noodles. add all remaining ingredients to cooker. I choose to only add 1/2 the celery at this point with the remainder to be added when the peas and beans go in. Cook on low for 4-5 hrs. Check chicken tenderness and adjust cooking time if needed(add 30-1hr to get firm but cooked chicken. Let chicken finish cooking until finished tenderness is accomplished after the veggies have been added) Add remaining celery along with the peas, beans, and adjust taste with seasoning if desired. On low, cook for 1-2 more hrs until chicken and veggies(if you used raw or uncooked veggies) are done. Place  chicken in a seperate dish for chunking/slicing/shredding and keep warm. Add egg noodles to stock and cook on low  until about 1/2 way tender. Add chicken back to cooker and with a wooden spoon, "slowly and gently" mix(so as not to puree all these tender ingredients into mush) in cornstarch to thicken if desired, or to just simply mix back in chicken. On low, cook for .30-1 hr or until noodles are at desired tenderness. Enjoy

This was pretty good.  Like others, I added broth.  I wasn't too excited about this but everyone else in the house thought it was really good so I had to give it at least 4 stars since I've been asked to make it again soon.

Reminder NOT to use whole chicken as the little bones that fell away from the meat in the crock pot was near impossible to remove before serving.  Larger pieces of chicken (like thighs or drumsticks) or boneless (as in the recipe) will be best.

This was pretty good, but I found it to be a little bland for my tastes.  I had to doctor it up with some poultry seasoning, salt & pepper.  I thought 6 cups of liquid would be too much, so I only used 4 cups of chicken broth.  Next time I will use all 6 cups.

I made this recipe, and added a cup of frozen peas and carrots and a cup of frozen corn.  I cooked dry "shell" noodles on the stove and added for the last 20-30 minutes. This being my first time, I didn't expect much, but my husband and I really liked this receipe a lot!  Would make it again for sure.

This was very easy, but I thought it was just OK. It was pretty bland, and I'm normally a bland food-type of girl. It's probably a good base recipe. The only thing I changed was substitute whole wheat egg noodles, and add chicken  bouillion.

I haven't made this yet because I'm wondering what in the world are "frozen" egg noodles. Where in the frozen section of the grocery store would I find these? Strange. Some poeple said they have these on hand... never heard of them!

I did not like this recipe!  I'm very frustrated!  I prefer recipes that do not require being doctored up.  I tried following different peoples reviews based on what they did, but it did not work out.  Also, I wish she had been specific on how to make it thicker...by telling me how many tablespoons of cornstarch to water, as I've never used cornstarch before.  It tastes weird!  I blame that on myself for not knowing how to wing a recipe, I just wish she had given a full recipe with seasonings so that I wouldn't have been put in this predicament.  I guess its time to whip out the frozen pizza. :(

Good! I wanted a slow cooker chicken stew-like recipe, and this fit the bill. I used two chicken breasts, one can of chicken broth and one can of water, some dried onion flakes, a can of mushrooms, a fair bit of salt and pepper, and two carrots and one huge potato. I added the diced fresh veggies an hour before serving and they were perfect. I didn't use the noodles, and I thickened it with a bit of corn starch in cold water. To season, I added maybe 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning, ½ tsp celery seed, and 1/4 tsp rosemary. My five-year-old scarfed it down! Thanks for sharing the base for a great stew, Kathy!

This a great chicken and noodle recipe, but I made a few modifications.  I only used 3 breasts and that was plenty; they were still frozen when I added them and I cooked them for about 6 hours and they were perfectly cooked.  I added 2 large chicken bouillon cubes.  I couldn't find any frozen noodles, so after I took the chicken out, I added 3/4 of an 8 oz package of dry noodles and let that cook for about 30 minutes.  I added 2 Tbls of cornstarch mixed in a little water and let it cook for another 15 minutes but I think next time, I will add that when I add the noodles because it didn't seem to reach its full thickening power.  Very good and easy, perfect for a busy day.

This was not good.  If you are going to try this recipe, boil your own egg noodles.  The frozen ones end up gummy and nasty.

This soup was delicious.  I took the advice of others and added baby carrots, used garlic salt with the pepper.  I also added a can of chopped tomatoes (undrained).  I baked some crescent rolls and we had a complete dinner.  Thank you for the recipe Kathy!

Italian seasoning? Where does it say that in the original recipe? It's chicken and NOODLES, not chicken noodle soup.

I made it at 6am and it came out great! I put in the noodles at the last hour as well and its yummy! (not as good as grandmas though! :) 

I did add some carrots with the onions and celery (the "trinity" and more like chicken noodle soup.) I'll wait for about halfway through the next time, the color on the veggies is either translucent or is a little gray (I used 1/2 chicken broth 1/2 water) 

FABULOUS flavor though! Definately have again in the cooler months.

I'm not sure what happened with this recipe but the noodles practically disintigrated. The soup/stew mixture was tasty but it was all lumped together and didn't look all that appealing. I didn't use frozen noodles and mayber that's what made the difference. I will try again and see what happens.

I think I've found the cure to all colds now! Made this when both my boyfriend and I were sick; added some carrots and used macaroni because we didn't have egg noodles on hand. Wouldn't recommend using frozen noodles either, they turn out gummy just as Amanda P. said. Still really yummy though. Even better with lots of salt in there, and served with fresh bread.

This was OK to get started but not much flavor at all. Needed a lot of doctoring. I did some changing and it turned out wonderful.  I used chicken broth instead of water and used more than 6 cups. I also added additional seasonings asuch as bay leaf, garlic powder, peppercorns, etc. and added vegetables such as carrots, celery. I added the pasta when we were going to eat in an hour so it just cooked for the last hour. And I thickened it up also.

This recipe was a bit salty for us.  I would cut the italian seasonings in half and use a different soup.  If you love chicken and dumplings or another recipe that has a strong chicken flavor to everything then this is your recipe but if you want to taste something other than chicken with chicken gravy try something else.

4 stars because I did add a few things to make it 5 stars for us.  Like others, I only used two chicken breasts.  Cooked 3, but saved one back as there was plenty of meat.  Also added more celery, and carrots.  Seasoned it with garlic powder, celery salt, and some poultry seasoning (didn't measure, just threw some in.  My favorite way to cook!)  Also, switched it over to stove top to add regular egg noodles from the bag.  Used about 8 oz to make it extra noodle-y. My 5 yr old and 3 yr old gobbled it up!  This will join our list of regular meals!

I put this in crockpot before leaving for work&it cooked for 9 hours. I added a bag of peas&carrots and corn. I followed other reviewers and used old bay,poultry,soup base,garlic&1 can of broth plus 3 cups of water for 4 chicken breasts. I was out of egg noodles so I used linguini boiled on stovetop w/minced garlic&chicken boullion. It turned out good and there was plenty of liquid so 4c is plenty. Only gave 3 stars because w/out extra spices&veggies suggested by reviewers it would have been bland.

I didn't notice a mention of browning the chicken first but I did. In my 2 1/2 quart slow cooker I added 4 chicken thighs, 3 cups water with 3 boullion cubes, 1 tsp. garlic, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp greek seasoning (needs more) and 1 bay leaf. Instead of frozen pasta I boiled tri-color egg noodles. Celery and carrots are better added at the end of cooking. The chicken water from slow cooker can be a sauce by adding cornstarch. My 5 year old niece was over and ate all her chicken thigh! Yes, I would make again.

Made as-is. This was one of those recipes where easy prep makes up for a slightly bland taste. Will definately add to it next time to kick up the flavor.

This turned out really good for me. I added some chicken bouillon cubes, poultry seasoning and a little tarragon.  Next time I make it I think I'll leave out the tarragon though.  I also strained the onion and celery out of mine before I added the noodles.

Pretty good...I thickened it up with cornstarch and added a little poultry seasoning. I think that it can be doctored up with other seasonings as well...might try cajun seasoning on a cold night to warm us up! Thanks so much Kathy!!!

I added a chicken boullion (which I'm glad I did). Second, I used regular egg noodles. The soup itself tasted great, but the noodles ruined the whole thing. Egg noodles are not the right kind of pasta for this soup. If they cook too long (which they did in my case), they taste like mushy flour. It is gross. I could barely eat it and the only reason I forced it down was because that was all that was made for dinner that evening. Perhaps the frozen noodles would have made a difference, but it was so bad that I have no desire to even attempt it again.

Easy, easy, easy! This was a great recipe to make on a busy day. I just put all of this (except noodles) in the crockpot in the morning and all we had to do right before dinner was cook up the noodles and add those. I added some diced carrots to get another vegetable into the meal, and used chicken broth instead of water to get a little more flavor out of it. I do think that adding in some herbs would be good because it was just a little bland as is, but still good. My two year old loved it, ate all of his serving without complaint, but my five year old did not like the celery. To each his own! I will have to remember this one on those really busy days so I can get something on the table quickly. Thank you for the recipe, KathyLP!

I always read the reviews before trying a recipe and this one seemed simple enough. And it was. Like others said, 4 chicken breasts were too much, I used chicken STOCK and chicken broth instead of water, I added whatever frozen veggies I had in the freezer, I added some onion & garlic powder as well as some fresh garlic, celery salt, corn starch for thickening (not to mention a few potatoes) and I cooked the noodles separately because I didn't want them to get mushy. And the best part of all was someone's suggestion to add Old Bay Seasoning. It was the perfect touch. I can't wait to try this recipe again. Next time, not so many breasts (and fresh instead of frozen), maybe replacing with thighs instead, not so much garlic (it doesn't go well with chicken soup), and perhaps no potatoes, and some poultry seasoning (that I was out of).

Good basic recipe, but I, like others, prefer more seasoning. That's actually the beauty of it, that you can add what you like. My additions included 2 cloves chopped garlic, a bay leaf, a packet of Vigo seasoning (which also gave it a nice color), sage, and chopped baby carrots. Yummy! It's a rare cold day here in the south, when we can really enjoy it.

great flavor, but I found out that you must follow insturctions of when to put in the noodles exactly or it turns to mush.

I used carrots instead of celery. (We don't like celery.) I also used chicken broth and added poultry seasoning, a bay leaf, and some garlic powder. I still thought it was a bit bland, but the family liked it. With these changes, it would be good for a sick day, but for a regular dinner, I would like a little more flavor. I still give it four stars because it is easy, tasty, and can be made with ingredients I have on hand.

This was a very good and easy soup.  After reading other reviews, I also added chicken broth.  I bought a packet of seasoning from market and added about 1/4 of the bag.  My husband and 2 kids loved it, they all went back for seconds.  I was surprised how much I liked it.  We usually use a tomato-based broth for soup,so thus was a nice variation on that.

I added 2 bouillon cubes and 2 carrots to the recipe.  Also only used half of the chicken and noodle amounts.  We thought the soup was quite hearty and tasty.  Will make again.

Good.  A little bland, but I will try it again and tweak it a little.  It did take an awful lot of cornstarch to thicken it, but I may try it with 5c. of water instead of 6 to see if that helps.

Easy to make and very delicious to eat! I don't like the overwhelming taste of onions so I only put one whole onion in it and it turned out great. A family favorite!

Delicious soup! I used chicken breasts and chicken thighs. Used low sodium chicken broth instead of water. Added frozen carrots, frozen corn, no celery. Added poultry seasoning, garlic salt, tumeric, and bay leaves. Used bag of dry egg noodles instead of frozen.

Great promos often.  I have gotten photos,  photo books, magnets and calendars just for the shipping. 
I would give 4 stars, but arranging photos in a photo book or calender can be challenging and time consuming.   Not to mention adding backgrounds and titles.

I made this last night and it was very easy to make and yummy, i adjusted to what i had in my pantry to stretch the portions I added sweet peas to have an extra veggie, also added some cilantro for extra flavor and i didn't have the egg noodles so I used a different pasta that I just cooked at the end separate and added to soup and worked great! Thank you for sharing this is a keeper!

I follwed the recipe but instead of frozen noodles I just added regular egg noodles about 30 miuntes before it was done. I also added carrots, garlic powder, and chili powder. It came out fantastically! We had extra left over so we packed it up and have it ready for lunches tomorrow! I will definetly be making this again!

Very easy recipe and as others said very easy to build on!  I added two cups of chicken broth to the 6 cups of water... also added basil, parsley, and carrots but left out the onion (just because we didn't have one).  Also used whole wheat egg noodles!  We'll see how it turns out! :)

Good and hearty and easy to make.  However, I added some chili powder and cayenne pepper to make it taste more interesting.  If I was going to do it again, I would also add some green onions and some chopped carrots a bit later on for some texture.

This turned out way too thick and mushy but the flavors were there. It was good. Maybe more water next time or maybe even cook the noodles seperate then add. Ty

This is a great chicken noodle soup recipe. I used 2 cans of chicken broth and added some bullion cubes to the water. I didn't have any problem with using frozen noodles. Just followed the recipe adn added them at the end while & shredding the chicken. It was the perfect consistency for my family. A great comfort food recipe.

I really liked this recipe...I dashed in some garlic,lemon pepper, some house seasoning(paula deen's house seasoning recipe). Three chicken breasts were enough for mine but they were big. Corn starch was used to thicken the liquid into a gravy. All in all it is a great base like everyone else is saying...Enjoy!!

I used this recipe but added garlic salt, 1/2 t. celery seed and  substituted two cans of chicken broth plus two c. water, and 1 C chopped carrots.   In a rush, I also bypassed the slow cooker  and used the large can of white chicken breast instead of the fresh chicken.  I simmered all on the stove, and then added my frozen egg noodles later.  I always thicken my chicken and noodles with about two T of flour shaken up with about 1/2 C water.  I agree with most others that this was a good basic recipe, but needed more seasoning.

This was a great recipe! I made it for my husband when he was sick and it tasted so good. Based on others reviews, I didn't use the frozen egg noodles and added a little bit of Tone's Rosemary and Garlic Seasoning to the broth while the chicken was cooking. Yum! Thanks for sharing.

My family loved this recipe!  I did make some slight changes:  it tasted bland after cooking the initial 6 hours so I added two chicken bouillon cubes while the noodles cooked.  I've never used frozen noodles before and it didn't seem very appealing to me, so I put in a couple handfulls of dry bowtie pasta and cooked it on the stove for 11 minutes.  Make sure you confirm your crockpot liner can go on the stove, otherwise you'll have to transfer the soup before boiling (which is what I did).  My kids asked for seconds which rarely happens at dinner time.

Like others recommended, I replaced chicken broth for some of the water, added 1T poultry seasoning , carrots and garlic powder and cut back to 3 chicken breasts. I didn't use any noodles.  I will probably tweak it more the next time I make it but we all liked it. Oh, I added homemade matzoh balls!

The soup turned out delicious! Although next time I’ll use only 1/2 an onion rather than a full one. I added 4-5 diagonally cut carrots and 4-5 Celery stalks. I also used a small pack of about 6 chicken wings with skin along with with chicken breast strips cut into squares. I also added 4 cloves of garlic, garlic salt, a dusting of paprika and used 4 Cups of left over Chicken Bone Broth from OssoGood Broth with 2Cups Of Water. I would’ve used all bone broth but I didn’t have enough. I also added 3 chicken (Knorr - 1 Cube per 2Cups of liquid) bouillon cubes. I cooked everything in the crockpot on low for the first 4 hours and raised it to high for the last 4 hours. I couldn’t find frozen or fresh egg noodles so I used the regular dry ones, which I prepared in a separate pot, and added to the soup at the end. Yummy!

I added 1 teaspoon of thyme leaves before I started cooking this recipe.
I was skeptical about the "frozen noodles"- I put my package of noodles in the freezer for 2 hours, then added them to the broth.
Delicious recipe.  It's a keeper.

I did pretty much all the above on the recipe but used plain dry egg noodles and used chicken broth to cook chicken and at the end I added a cup of sour cream to the soup which made it almost like a stroganoff. Very tasty

Used 1 and 1/2 lbs of chicken breast, 1 box of stock and 2 cups of water with 2 bouillion cubes (could increase the liquid for soup to just 2 boxes of stock I think), added 1 TB poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper (next time a bay leaf as well).  Added 2 to 3 carrots.  Cooked on low all day, and once the noodles were added it took probably another 30-45 minutes.  The kids liked this as well.

Great basic recipe for chicken soup.  It's easy to customize it the way you and your family want it.  Substitute all or part of the water for reduced sodium chicken broth for a richer flavor.  Use less liquid for more of a stew consistency, or more liquid for a soup consistency.  As suggested by the photograph shown next to the recipe on the Allrecipes website, feel free to add carrots, but keep in mind that they will need closer to the 8 hours so that they won't be hard.  Some flavor enhancers that you might consider adding are: 1 teaspoon celery salt, OR 1 teaspoon garlic powder, OR 1 tablespoon poultry seasoning, AND 1 bay leaf.  If you want a soup with a thicker broth, you can whisk in a tablespoon of corn starch to a quarter cup of broth that you remove from the slow cooker, then add it back to the crock pot and stir.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe, KathyLP!

This was absolutely delicious! I read previous reviews and modified it slightly but not so as to re-do the entire recipe. It was so simple and delicious. I also cooked the noodles separately then just mixed everything up. My normally-picky two daughters even told me to make it again and again. Kudos for a great recipe!

Very tasty, very easy.  I cooked the chicken breasts in broth (6 cups at least).  Add some poultry seasoning.  Next time cook the noodles before adding them to the broth.

This was delicious.  I used chicken broth instead of the water and 2 large chicken breasts. . The frozen egg noodles are a must. Very very very good. I add 2 tsps of lemon juice  for a bit of acid.

made this today - so glad I read other reviews and added more spices than just salt and pepper! I didn't have poultry seasoning so I used herbs de provence (a reasonable substitute) & garlic powder. I agree that 4 chicken breasts is too much chicken! I used 3 and that was too much - next time I'll use 2.  also used chicken broth instead of just water, added carrots and mushrooms.  I couldn't find frozen egg noodles so used dry - not too bad but I will try to find frozen for next time.  overall the recipe is a great base and easy to add ingredients to your liking.

This was excellent and so easy to make. I doubled the recipe so I had enough to freeze. I used a whole chicken and used 8 cups Swanson's chicken broth and 4 cups water. In addition to the suggested spices in the recipe, I added my spice choices of curry, Bay leaf, poultry seasoning and dill. Reamers frozen egg noodles.  Great soup.

I used chicken legs instead of chicken breast.  It turned out wonderful.  It wasn't as thick as I had hoped but we poured it over potatoes and it worked out.  When we ate the leftovers the 2nd and  3rd times, it was perfect.

We loved it. I gave four stars only because noodles got gooey and most definitely could not make it through reheating for leftovers. I will make again but make noodles separately.

I always make chicken soup in the winter.  I would suggest using Frozen egg noodles.......they are thicker and don'f fall apart.  I too thicken mine and throw in some frozen peas, chopped carrots & onion.

I did make a few changes.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth, 2 cups of water and 2 chicken bouillon  cubes.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of poultry season mix.  I used 4 chicken breasts, a few carrots sliced, some celery and onion.  I did need to add a little more chicken broth at the end of the cooking cycle because it was a bit thick.  The frozen egg noodles were a hit with my husband , because they have such a creamy, fresh consistency.
Overall, with my few changes I thought this was an easy , delicious recipe and I will make it again.

Like a lot of people on here said, you can use a lot less chicken than what the recipe calls for. 

I threw in two chicken billion cubes which gave the broth more flavor. I also added chunks of tomatoes for the last two hours, which added some nice acidity and color.

This recipe needed a little more, so I used the following: 3 boneless/skinless breasts, 2 cups carrots, 3 celery stocks, 3/4 medium onion, 3 cups chicken broth, 3 cups water, 1 chicken bullion cube, 3 tbs olive oil, salt, pepper, and a couple spices I had in my cabinet. Cooked for 7 hours, shredded chicken, added noodles and served about 10 mins later. It was so yummy! Next time I will add a bay leaf and parsley for a little more flavor and color.

Like most I gave it 5 stars because it is such a good base.  I added fresh garlic, fresh thyme, and a pinch of red pepper( everyone in my house likes a little kick). Added celery and onions for extra veggies. Some chicken bullion. And cooked some dry egg noodles.  Turned out great.

It needs more vegetables.  I also used dry egg noodle pasta, instead of frozen.  I removed the chicken after cooking for six hours, added the egg noodles, and let it cook on high for about 20 minutes.  Then I broke up the chicken and added it all back to the crock pot to mix.  The chicken was great;  It fell apart in my fingers.  It needs more broth and a bit of salt, but it is easy and tasty.  

I doubled the celery and added two cups of cut carrots at the outset.  Then I added a pound and a half of frozen peas at the end and stirred until they thawed and mixed in with the soup.  Much better.

Excellent soup and really easy!  I borrowed suggestions from other reviewers and made a few modifications.  I boiled the noodles and kept them separate.  Also made a pot of rice.  

I added 16oz frozen mixed vegetables, 4 cups of sliced carrots, used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of water, juice from half a lemon  and added a 1/4 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper .

Tasteless recipe and I used the canned chicken broth and added some powdered chicken bouillon, celery salt and garlic powder.  I cooked it on the back porch and glad I did as it smelled awful as it cooked and tasted terrible, too.  Glad it was easy to make and ingredients were fairly cheap. This is the same recipe I make in the pressure cooker and it's wonderful, NOT in the slow cooker.

I think only using water is a bit bland, I always make chicken soup like this, I have found the best flavor comes with herbox chicken bouillon and also throwing a few bay leaves in

Just had this recipe for tonight's dinner. Came out Delish! This was my first time making chicken soup and my second time using a slow cooker. Very pleased with this dish. The only mistake I made was adding too much salt. (The chicken broth is salty enough)

I made this last night in the crockpot.  Instead of chicken breasts I  used boneless & skinless chicken thighs that I cut up into bite size pieces.  (seasoned them with Lawry's seasoned salt, pepper & paprika)  Left out the carrots because the family doesn't like them.  Instead I put in a bag of 15 soup beans. (no soaking required because they cook slowly in the crockpot)  I also had some fresh green beans that I threw in & I used chicken broth instead of water.  I couldn't find frozen noodles at my store, so I used regular noodles that I cooked on the stove. I decided to do it that way because I thought the noodles would get to soggy if added to the crockpot.  It was delicious!  I will definitely make this again!

It was great, but I switched it up a little. Instead of using a large onion, I used 1 cup of frozen baby onions, 1/2 tbsp of onion powder and 3 chicken bouillon cubes. I let the chicken slow cook for 11 hours and it was falling apart in the broth, so I didn't have to take it out.. I added the noodles, then separated it into 6 meals and immediately put them in the freezer. Next batch I'll remember the carrots.

I quartered new potatoes and placed those in first, then added my chicken pieces(seasoned with garlic salt and fresh cracked pepper) added carrots and celery then poured in 4c water with chicken bouillon and 2 bay leaves. Toward the end I added leftover roasted red bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions. I had regular egg noodles and boiled them separately. I tried thickening it with the cornstarch but that didn't work. I even tried instant mashed potatoes. In the end I made a roux with butter, flour, and some of the liquid from the slow cooker on the stove. That did the trick. I think cooking the noodles separately will result in a thinner broth. I will make this again. I would like to try adding a little sour cream at the end next time.

It was what I was looking for. Husband wasn't feeling well GI wise and was looking for something simple and plain. I did three breasts, six cups of water with three teaspoons chicken bouillon granules. Didn't have celery so used carrots. Did the trick. Will make again and add more next time. Good recipe.

Pretty good base recipe. I took the advice of others and added celery salt and poultry seasoning.
