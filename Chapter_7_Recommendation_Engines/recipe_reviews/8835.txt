I also cooked this in my crockpot.  However, I omitted the mushrooms and celery because I was pressed for time and found those 2 ingredients unnecessary anyway. I doubled the amount of kidney beans and added one small can of tomato sauce so that the crock pot would at least be 2/3 full... The chicken was grilled in the electric grilling machine - no plug here for brand of appliance used:)!!!! Then it was topped with sliced green onions and a dollop of sour cream. The piece de resistance: good ol' cornbread.... YES! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was a very good recipe - it lasted me for lunch and dinner (2 bowls each time).
It struck me as a little unusual, since without the tomato sauce/paste so common to other chili recipes, it was a little more like a chicken-vegetable stew than a soup/chili. The extra minutes spent in sauteing the vegetables and browning the chicken paid off in enhancing the flavors, I think. I wasn't expecting there to be enough chicken in this recipe, but it was plenty, as it turned out. It wasn't very hot, but the spice mixture was very tasty.
I think I'll make this for The Woman I Love someday soon. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was so good!  I used two chicken breasts, which i boiled and then shredded by hand.  I used a 28 oz can of chunky tomatos and a small can of tomato paste.  I also added a can of sweet corn.  Instead of chili powder, i used chili sauce, which may be the reason i got a sweet sauce, can't think of what else caused it to be sweet, maybe the tomato paste??  ...but in any case, it was great!  My Husband loved it!!!

Nice tasting recipe.  I used TVP instead of chicken and it was really good.  Red pepper tasted better than green, used a little less onion on second recipe, little better that way.  Didn't like crunch of celery, so added carrots second try, little smoother.  Spices were a good combo, could not taste cocoa powder, maybe just deepens color a bit.  Nice recipe to adjust spice on, just add more crushed red pepper or cayenne if you want it hotter.

We made this at a cooking circle yesterday.  We used chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 lbs) and a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  I added a tsp of sugar to cut the acidity, and a little extra garlic salt, chili powder and cumin.  I also had it with shredded cheddar over top. It was great, and I will probably make it again.

A great meal. My only comment would be that it is SO good that what is suppose to be 5 servings was devoured by two of us. This is a keeper!!!!!!

Great alternative to beef chili and you really can't even tell the difference. I made it with ground chicken and mild chili beans instead of the kidney beans. It turned out great!

Great!!  I left out the cocoa and used diced tomatoes instead of the whole... added an additional can of them, as it seemed a bit dry without. I also used canned mushrooms as I had them on hand instead of the fresh.  Good recipe!!

Great, especially to make and save in mini portions to take to work. All of the flavor of regular chilli, but less guilty.

Really good recipe! I used black beans instead of kidney beans, and used diced tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomotoes.  I also left out the mushrooms and celery, since we didn't have any.  It still came out well - nice smoky flavor with the paprika! Nice and easy as well.

This is so good. It was such a hit!  A nice change from the traditional beef. Even my picky husband raved about it. I omitted the mushrooms and green peppers just because we don't eat them.  Next time I'll double the recipe.

This was okay.  I had to add two cans of tomatoes, and skipped the mushrooms.  I served it over rice and it was pretty good, but nothing realy special.

My husband and I really liked this chili. I made it with one pound of ground chicken and I also substituted one can of diced tomatoes with chilis for the can of whole tomatoes, because i don't really care for big chunks of tomatoes. It came out great. I think the blend of seasonings was perfect for my taste. I will probably use this as a base for chili with beef or pork as well. I served it with toasted tortillas.

I made this recipe as a healthy alternative to regular chili. My husband hates anything healthy and he actually loved this recipe, so did my 2 year old. I added a little chipotle powder and cheddar cheese on top. I also added carrots because I didn't have celery. It was great!

VERY good recipe but, there a few changes i made that i thought made it even better. First, instead of using oil to cook the vegetables and chicken i used chicken broth (same as i do when i make stirfry), this really cuts back on the fat. I'm not a big kidney bean fan so i omitted that and added another 4oz. of mushrooms(8oz.). I love spicy food so i added extra chili powder, salt and pepper flakes. And with a spoon full of fat free sour cream on top, and fat free corn bread on the side this made a VERY GOOD meal(which my boyfriend loved),and i'll be making this recipe again and again.

Very good. I didn't have any cocoa powder so it didn't get put in. And I don't like kidney beans so I used chili beans in chili sauce. I drained them a little, but didn't rinse. Pretty healthy and substantial chili. I also made some white rice and filled the bowl with half chili and half rice and pulled in a little rice with each bite of the chili. Yummy.

Quite yummy.  I used a 19-oz can of tomatoes and a bit less chicken than suggested, and it was very good.  Spicy enough that both the "like it hot" and "not hot" sides of the family were happy.  The cocoa powder is not really noticeable if anyone is wondering; that ingredient reminded me of Cincinnati Chili, but the taste is much more like a regular chili.  Healthy & tasty with rice on the side. Make some!

This was so easy! I followed the recipe to the t, including the celery and mushrooms. I knew the mushrooms would add a rich taste and wasn’t wrong - otherwise it’s just plain ole chili! The touch of cocoa was a surprise as well but o so subtle! My hubs loved this even though he had no idea there was chocolate in it! And he’s a very discerning eater! Will make this again!!

I wasn't real fond of the flavor.  Maybe it was the cocoa powder or maybe  it just needed something else, I don't know.  It seems to have promise but I don't know how I would adjust it to make it a five star review.

This is my ultimate favourite chili recipe! I use any leftovers as a filling for tortillas sprinkled with shredded cheddar, which I roll up and put into a 9x13 ovenproof dish,  garnish across the middle of the tortilla "rolls" with some more chili and top with more shredded cheddar and bake in a 325 degree oven until the cheese melts.

This is decent. I made it in the crockpot. I did sauté everything and brown the chicken ahead of time. It was pretty good, though it had a little more of a cumin taste than I like. I noticed the picture first and was surprised that this didn't have any chicken broth. I guess I didn't realize that the picture was submitted by someone else. FYI- it looks nothing like the picture, at least the one I'm looking at. This really tastes like a smoky chili. I added sour cream to kill a little bit of the smoky taste; that's my personal preference.

This was excellent!  The only thing I did differently was to add a can of tomato paste.  Thank you!

This recipe is excellent!!  I make this always with ground chicken.  I always omit the mushrooms because my family is fussy and doesn't like them.  I've also substituted the celery for red and yellow pepper as I don't always have celery on hand.  I also use a can of regular pork and beans (Bush Home-style) because we prefer that over kidney.  I'll usually prep it the evening before and then have my daughter switch on the crock pot at noon when she comes home from school.  Delicious served with macaroni or garlic bread.

Try frying the chicken in oil with flour then adding a 1/4 c of chicken broth with it.  We loved it.

My whole family loved this. The flavor is great. It isn't hot but has a good depth of flavor. I did use petite diced tomatoes as that is what I had and I used a red bell pepper because we prefer them. I added about 1/4 cup water to make up for the lack of juice in the tomatoes. This fed 5 adults. I may double next time so I will have 
leftovers.

I didn't add the mushrooms.  I added about a quarter cup salsa verde, and 2 chopped up green onions and some cilantro after the boil.  A nice, hearty recipe.

My husband and I are trying to cut back on our red meat consumption and I am not too fond of chicken.  That being said we think this chili was Very good...I used black beans in place of kidney beans and used 1 chopped Anaheim pepper in place of pepper flakes.  I gave it 4 stars because I missed the " beefy flavor"... But I think it is very good for chicken chili.
