I agree with others who noted that if this were to be prepared with the amount of water called for it would be soupy mush. Zucchini and yellow squash already contain a lot of water, so to add any is really unnecessary. So I eliminated the water altogether, added a clove of minced garlic and some sliced mushrooms, and cooked this just until done but still retaining its shape. It turned out beautifully and the bacon was a flavorful addition. Five stars just by skipping the water!

This squash has wonderful flavor. I used pre-cooked bacon pieces and sauteed them with the onions in a tablespoon of olive oil. I also reduced the water to one cup so that it wasn't so "soupy." The squash was great over pasta and then topped with marinara sauce. A good way to give squash some flavor without all the fat of the typical squash casserole.

I have cooked squash similar to this all my life. However, I never add that much water to squash. Only a small amount is needed, usually just 1/4-1/2 cup if a lot of squash is being cooked. For this small amount of squash do not add more than 2-3 tablespoons otherwise all you will get is tasteless mush.

I was looking for this recipe. Although I didn't know it was called "stewed squash" I am happy to have found it.  My mom makes something like this dish.  I went the vegan approach w/out bacon and used olive oil.  It turned out great.  I have never enjoyed squash and zucchini like this before!  Great recipe.  Thanks!

We love squash including my one year old so I thought this would be a good way to serve it differently than usual.  It was just mush and did not have much flavor which was suprising with the bacon and onion.

I had been looking for a recipe that used both yellow squash and zucchini when I came across this one to use as a base. I did change some things. I used 1 can of Rotel Tomatoes instead of water, 4 slices of bacon(precooked and crumbled), 2 yellow squash and 2 zucchini along with 1 chopped onion and seasonings. I cooked it all together in a skillet for about 10 minutes. The dish was a little warm to the taste, but overall pretty good. I might try mild rotel next time. 
Thanks for sharing your recipe.

A great recipe for farmers market-fresh veggies! I added minced garlic and used a seasoned salt for a little more flavor. Though I didn't find the TWO cups of water to be necessary, I did add a couple splashes to the pan to help the cooking along. I think since I had small, likely younger squash and zucchini, they didn't seem to release as much of their own liquid and it was taking awhile to cook, so the water helped that move along a little faster. :)

This was good, very simple. I also did not add the water, definitely not necessary! Also added some Italian spice as well.

Doubled the bacon, cut out the water, used 1/2 cup chicken stock instead (homemade with NO salt).  Husband rather liked it; I thought it was pretty good.

I'm not really a squash eater and neither is my wife, but we tried this out tonight just to try something different and we both loved it. As others have said, I didn't think the water was necessary. After the squash had browned, I added a little just to help the cooking, but that was it. Definitely not the 2 cups. The squash tasted great!

Way too much water!!!! It is SO fine without the water. Squash has a lot of water in it naturally. So, in my opinion, no water necessary at all.

I love this recipe.  I used 1 cup of chicken stock in place of the water, added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper and 1 tsp garlic powder.  This gave it a slight kick and my husband who HATES both zucchini and squash ate it up!  Thanks for the submission!

Before adding the onion and bacon I smoked them for about 1/2 hour over applewood chips using high heat. Smoked up some garlic cloves while I was at it.  Otherwise, cook as above without any added water.  The smoke gave the dish just the right amount of back woodsy finish while still keeping the squash as the primary flavor. Very well received by all at our Thanksgiving dinner.

I love this dish. I made a few changes. I cooked 4 slices of bacon used the drippings to saute onion and garlic. I then added the bacon, zucchini and squash. Three minutes later I added about 1/4 cup of water, 1 chicken bouillon cube and some garlic and herb seasoning. It simmered for about 10 minutes. Fantastic!!
