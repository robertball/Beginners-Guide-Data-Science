OMG!! Made this pie today. SO GOOD!  We made 8 of them, we made 2 of those with splenda instead of sugar and it was as good as the original recipe.  Super easy to make.  Definitely need the deep dish crust. Iam not a big pecan pie person but I LOVED this.  Pretty rich, I actually liked the splenda version the best.

We made this on Girls weekend/Kentucky Derby weekend 2012. It was VERY good and we got a little crazy and threw in 1 1/2 cups of high end dark chocolate chips. I think it would have been just fine with the 3/4 cup. We also didn't have any bourbon and didn't want to use the vodka in it so we used two tablespoons of coffee. Great, great recipe! I also used Best-Ever Pie Crust from this site. Nice. And we got 12 slices out of this pie because it was very rich. Great with ice cream or whipped cream.

Excellent pie but extremely rich. I made it exactly as the recipe suggested. Warning: cut small slices.

My husband and I lived in Louisville for 10 years. So now when there is a holiday or special occasion my husband expects his Derby pie.  This recipe is the best I have found! Just follow it as is and you can't go wrong.  Great replacement for the normal boring pecan pie....this pie makes me a super star to my husband and kiddos! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

The pecans were almost burned at 20 minutes. That 1 hour in the oven is way too much.  Also added a pinch of salt.

Very easy to make.  I'm not a huge chocolate fan, so found it very rich, but the fam loved it.  I would not use as many chocolate chips next time.  I used Splenda in place of the white sugar and couldn't tell a difference. I agree that you definitely need a deep dish pie crust!

I made two pies. The first one I tried to put all of the mix into a premade crust and it over flowed. For the second one I saved the extra mix and made my own crust to make mini pies in a muffin pan. I baked them for about 20 minutes. I haven’t tried any of the big pies yet but the mini ones were amazing and easier to tell when they were done.

I made this for a friend who remembered having something called Derby Pie as a kid.  This luscious pie brought back the memories for him and made new ones for the rest of us! Other than adding a full cup of the mini chocolate chips, I followed the recipe exactly and served with a little French vanilla ice cream....perfect!

I'm not super happy with this recipe. I followed all directions, except the part about toasting the pecans. Another review tipped me off that 1 hour to roast pecans was too long, so I looked elsewhere for instructions, which recommended roasting at 350 for 8-15 minutes. Mine were done after 10.  Even after baking for 60 minutes, the pie was goopy and uncooked in the center, although I must edit this review to say that it did set up a bit as it cooled, though not 100%. All of the chocolate chips settled to the bottom, even though I used the mini chips as directed. I would try not melting the butter next time and just softening it. I would highly recommend using a deep dish pan if you bake this pie - I didn't have one and paid the price (my fault, not the recipe). It spilled over the edges and caused part of the crust to fall off.

Tasted okay, but all the chocolate settled to the bottom. It was like eating a two layered pie, very weird. I'll stick to my other "derby pie" recipe.

This pie is amazing, very rich, would recommend only putting the pecans in for about ten minutes and also sticking the filling in the fridge for a little helps with the chocolate chips not sinking. Oh and adding a lil more bourbon ;]]

This pie was almost flavorless. The texture was good, but the custard between the chocolate chips and pecans left a lot to be desired. If I were to make it again, I’d add cinnamon and salt to the base.

This is my favorite pie, definitely will put it in a deep dish pan next time because I had to take out almost 2 cups of filling before baking it.

this is the only Kentucky Derby pie recipe I have found that calls for 1/2 cup of flour! Result? All chocolate chips fell to the bottom and there was an inch and a half of gooey center that only tasted like flour. Do not waste your time on this recipe. There are many others online that are much better - and don't call for any flour.

This is basically a recipe for pecan pie with chocolate chips. Plus, all the pecans and choc chips floated to the top. Wish I could figure out how to get them spread throughout. All Derby Pie I've ever had is more along the lines of a deep-dish chocolate chip cookie. This was definitely not that. It was tasty! But not Derby Pie...

I'm from Kentucky and recently moved to California. I was missing home and wanted a little slice of home town dessert. This was great!! Only thing I would change I would add more bourbon because I like the bourbon flavor. This was a delicious pie. Would recommend

great flavor with toasted pecans but toast 10-15 min.  vs 1 hr. 
Bourbon could increase to 3-4 Tbsp. It took the full 60 minutes to bake till center still jiggled slightly.  Also, add bourbon flavored whipped cream to raise the bar!

I made this, I liked this... I just have one issue with it... When I made it... all the chocolate chips melted... drifted to the center and the center sunk. The center was all just chocolate and pecans.... I have no clue what I did wrong. Input would be nice.

I personally haven't tasted this pie...I'm a diabetic baker, but I've received rave reviews from my customers.  The one thing  I've found that most pies that call for a deep 9" pie shell almost always could really use a 10" deep shell so that it doesn't overflow & make a mess of your oven.  I always make this in a 10" shell and drizzle choc afterwards like another recipe showed.  It just makes the presentation even more fantastic.
