AWESOME! I made this for the first time for a pot luck at work. I made a few changes based on previous suggestions that were submitted. I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt. I used only 2TBS of lite melted butter (6 is way too much). Melted butter works better because it's easier to mix the seasonings in with the potatoes. I baked the potatoes for an hour the night before. The next day at work, I put the potatos in a crock pot, added the cheese, Ranch dressing, garlic and bacon pieces and cooked on low for 3 hours to melt the chesse. By lunch time it was all ready and it turned out perfect! I had A LOT of people ask for the recipe. It was the first dish to be completely eaten! And the best part was it was so easy to make!! The hardest part was cutting all the potatoes. I will denfinately be making this many more times!

I'm begging anyone that is about to make this recipe to please please please exclude the 6 tbsp of butter!!!  I just spooned over 2/3 cup of grease out of the pan.  This could be a wonderful comfort dish with a great melding of flavours but the butter is totally unnecessary! I gave it 4 stars cuz I will make it again, just no butter.

Delicious and easy--you will not be disappointed!  After reading several reviews with tweaking suggestions, here is what I did to produce the delectable result:  I cubed red potatoes, leaving the skin on. I cut the butter amount by 1/3, and saut√©ed 1/2 cup chopped onion in it until softened.  I then added the seasonings, and poured the mixture over the potatoes in the casserole dish, tossing to coat.  After baking, I added 1/4 real bacon bits, along with the cheese and dressing, to the potatoes.  The dish accompanied charcoal grilled hamburgers--a VERY tasty meal!  I will definitely make this potato dish again and again.

WOW! This are great! My husband goes crazy for them every time I make them. I cut the recipe down to 4 servings & used: 1 1/4 lb potatoes, 1/2 t chili powder, 1/4 t salt, 1/8 t pepper. 1/3 C cheese, 1/3 C Ranch & no butter I just sprayed the pan with cooking spray. Very delicious. I make this with BBQ pork. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Looking for another potato bake, I decided to give this one a go.  For extra taste, I added sauteed leeks and bacon at the point of adding the cheese and ranch dressing.  Although this dish was very tasty, I found that the butter made the dish extremely greasy. I felt that spraying the baking dish lightly with oil would have been adequate, and that the butter was really quite unnecessary. I made the dish a second time, completely omitting the butter, it was definitely less greasy, hence a much healthier potato bake.  The chilli powder gives this dish a bit of oomph and was a great addition.  I will definitely make my version of this dish again.  Thank you for the recipe.

I've made this dish numerous times now and like to  tweak it a bit here and there. I usually cut the chili powder and butter in  half, use mild cheddar instead of Monterey Jack  and add some season-all, celery salt, garlic and paprika.  Also good to add: sliced leek, chives or green onions. Lastly, we prefer Ken's Ranch over Hidden Valley.

Husband and I loved this dish, my picky 10 year old didn't, but I'm not sure if he actually tried it or just looked at and decided (which he does quite often).  I did change one thing, instead of using butter, I mixed the potatoes and seasonings in a ziplok bag with olive oil - I wanted to make it a little healthier.

I am rating this at 4 stars as I made it EXACTLY as written.  Liked this, but sure didn't love the sheer amount of greasiness that comes with using 6 tbsps of butter, hence the 4 star rating.  Since my initial foray into this recipe, I have since reduced the butter to 1.5 tbsps of butter and I cannot detect any loss of flavor.  HELPFUL HINTS:  Use Simply Potatoes with onions for ease in preparation and homemade Ranch dressing and Pepperjack cheese to increase flavor.  Thank you Jennybrianne for a different way to prepare a side dish staple!

I cut this recipe in half. I used organic red potatoes and instead of bottled ranch dressing, I used my own homemade out of scratch dry ranch dressing mix mixed with a third cup each of lowfat mayonnaise, reduced fat sour cream and fat free plain yogurt. We thought this was good but we all agreed that it would have been better had the potatoes been mashed with the butter and ranch dressing, then spread into a baking dish with the cheese on top. I think it could use a little more spice, too. Maybe some chopped chives?

The family loved these! I made just a couple modifications. I used 2 bags of frozen cubed hash browns and just let the bags thaw on the counter for an hour or so before mixing with the seasonings. Added 1/4 c green onions, chopped and 3 T of real bacon bits. Also, used 3T butter and a few drizzles of olive oil.  Then because the of using the hash browns just let it bake 30-35 minutes before adding the ranch and cheese. Everyone went back for seconds!

Try using Gold Potatoes instead of russett.  Since submitting this recipe a few years ago, I've switched to using Gold and I love it even more.  I've also decreased the amount of butter to 3 tbsp. I've added in crumbled bacon a few times.  I'm glad so many of you have liked it.

This dish was awesome, and I will definitely make it again.  Other than the tedious chore of peeling and cutting potatoes, prep was easy and the cooking times were accurate.  Definitely a keeper!

Soooooo good!!!Used a little less butter and didn't measure the ranch, used just enough to coat the potato.

We doubled the cheese (love it) and reduced the butter a little bit.  I also reduced the chili powder...not a huge fan of it.  Turned out really well.  Thanks for the post.

I already reviewed this once, I just wanted to add a suggestion -- instead of using plain Ranch dressing, try one of the flavored varieties now available. I used "Spicy" last time I made this, and it was delicious!

This is a home-run!  I made this for a large group of teenagers and they loved it!  I used a 5 lb bag of russets, peeled and cubed them.  Put them all in a large bowl and tossed with olive oil and the dry ingredients. I then baked as directed. I used no butter and used seasoned salt instead of regular.  After the hour was up, I mixed in a bag of shredded mixed cheddar cheese and a bottle of light ranch.  I then put it all in a crock pot on warm because I was transporting it to a dinner.  It was the hit of the dinner and a perfect take and go dish for a pot luck dinner. Next time I will try with a spicy ranch as someone suggested.  I bet that is amazing.  Thanks for a great recipe!  This is a keeper!

Made this dish instead of my old potato casserole standby for a dinner with the neighbors.  Everyone loved it!  I followed other reviewers' suggestion to cut the butter by 1/2.  I also sauteed 1/2 an onion and a tsp of minced garlic in the butter, mixed in the spices (I used Montreal steak seasoning in lieu of the salt and pepper) and then poured it over the potatoes in the buttered dish.  Came  out perfectly. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Mmmm, this was good. I omitted the butter completely and used onion salt instead of normal salt. I also sprinkled some chopped green onion over the top of the potatoes to add some colour.

Awesome!  Here are my revisions:  Use red potatoes, they hold together better.  Melt the butter, pour on top, toss the potatoes.  Evenly sprinkle the chili powder, salt and pepper and toss again.  Everything is now evenly coated.  At the end, after the cheese and dressing are mixed in, cover the top with either French fried onions or plain corn flakes.  Yum!  Yum!

My boyfriend and I brought this to a little bbq with some friends of ours and I'm pretty sure this was the favorite dish of all! The girls and I were already picking at it while the guys made the burgers. There were only 6 of us, and there was nothing left to take home! I threw in some bacon bits and topped it off with a little sprinkling of cheese. Thank you for this wonderfully simple recipe Jenny! UPDATE: I made this a second time for my boyfriend and his family, definitely sub the salt with seasoning salt or leave it all out, turned out really salty the second time I made it.

Great recipe...with my own sensational twist. Tried several times as is, delicious. Then had a bright idea (happens once in a blue moon). My fav dressing is Ken's Sweet Vidalia Onion. So I substituted that for the Ranch. All I can say is that once you've had it this way, you'll never go back! Other than that wouldn't change a thing except as others have noted to consider reducing the amount of butter to just enough to coat the potatoes, @ 3 maybe 4 Tbsp. A small prep tip that might come in handy is to put the seasonings in a bowl, then add the potatoes and mix thoroughly to coat, followed by folding in the melted butter. This helps cover the surface of all the potatoes evenly. Then scoop the potatoes into your baking dish and finish preparing per directions.

changed the recipe a bit just to add in more flavor and to use what I had on hand. Came out AMAZING and will be doing again. First I added 1 tsp. onion powder as well as 1 tsp garlic powder, used 1 tsp creole seasoning along with the chili powder. Baked for 1 hr. Instead of adding a whole bottle of ranch dressing I used fat free sour cream and mixed in a ranch packet along with the cheese. It came out PERFECT and flavorful creaminess! 




 with adding in about 1 tsp onion powder as well as 1 tsp garlic powder.

No dressing so subbed 2 tbl dry ranch mix, omitted salt and pepper and added 1 tbl cajun seasoning instead. After cubing potatoes ( 8 red potatoes) I put them in a tupperware bowl with 2 tbl (NOT 6) butter, microwaved till butter melted, put in seasonings and stirred to evenly coat. Sprayed 9x13 with pam, baked potatoes for 45 minutes, they were fork tender, added shredded cheddar (what I had on hand) and put back in oven for 5 minutes. I like the chili powder in this recipe :) Thanks!

great potatoes, I did not use the whole bottle of dressing, maybe a cup full was enough. I have prepared these the night before and left in the fridge ready to bake the next day, very time friendly recipe

Per other reviews PLEASE omit the butter and salt, the cheese has enough grease without the butter and the Ranch has enough salt.    I made a breakfast casserole out of the left over potatos in the same dish.  Gently smash down the potatos in the dish.  In bowl mix 6 eggs, 3 Tbsp of sourcream (or add milk), precooked bacon, 1/2 cup of shredded cheese and some tarragon.  Put in fridge overnight and it is ready to bake in morning 375 oven for 45 minutes.

These potatoes were great!  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings (just hubby and me).  Sliced the potatoes instead of diced with skins left on, added 1/2 sliced red onion and reduced amount of butter.  Only cooked covered for 45 minutes (1 hour at 400 degrees seemed too long).  Added extra cheese and topped with bacon bits.  Delicious!

OMG YUM! I'm tellin' you. This was great! Even my husband, who only likes mashed potatoes asked me to make this again. Make sure you cut the potato pieces small. And I used a little more chili powder, added some garlic powder, and only used about 3 tbs of butter (that i also cut into small cubes and spread evenly over the potatoes. Then i mixed the cheese and ranch together and just put on top of the potatoes, and put back in the oven on broil to give the cheese a little golden color.

I got TONS of compliments the two times that I've made this dish.  Didn't have chili powder, so I improvised with seasoned salt, pepper, paprika, cajun seasoning, and garlic powder.  Then I roasted the potatoes on a baking sheet to crisp them a bit. Next, mixed in the ranch, cheese, chopped green onions, and bacon (used salad topper for time saving). SO good!  Didn't even use the butter the second time and it was just as tasty

Good basic recipe; after reading other reviews I went the melted butter route and used less of it.  Also used seasoning salt instead of regular salt.  Happy with the results!  Thank you!

I cut this down for me and my two year old. Did add the onions and bacon bits as suggested in someone else's remarks. This was a WONDERFUL dish. Will definitely be making it again. Adding it to my family favorites. My two year old gobbled it down. And he usually won't eat any potatoes except mashed or french fries. Thanks for the great recipe. :)

Very Good! I read the reviews and did add more Ranch dressing, used seasoned salt and a bit more chili powder and it turned out great! I also used the frozen potatoes which cut prep time and baking time down considerably. I made this for my in-laws and husband for a birthday dinner and everyone loved it!

as written, this is a 3.5.  I've since worked on this and now think I have it.  Add about a quarter cup of finely minced onion, 1/4 finely minced celery, and 2 cloves of minced garlic to the initial potatoes.  Salt, pepper, and maybe garlic salt & paprika. Cover the potatoes in olive oil to lightly coat and "season" with a bit of melted butter.  The butter shouldn't add anything more than a bit of flavor, not grease.  Store the cooked potatoes overnight in light ranch dressing (about 7 oz. or less) and some of the cheddar cheese.  Finish the following day with lots of cheese and bacon bits.

This is an easy potato dish, full of starch creating a great comfort food. I admit, though, that it's a bit heavy for my liking, but for those people who love the heavy foods, such as biscuits and gravy or mashed taters and country fried steak, this would probably be a winner. The kids love this stuff and half the time prefer eating it to the entrees I prepare. Does that mean I should work on my entrees??!

I have now cooked this recipe about 14 times since finding it since it is now in demand wherever I seem to go. I took the advice of the other posters and cut back on the butter; also added bacon bits both mixed in and thrown on top. Everyone has pretty much had the same response to this dish: it is like a baked potato ONLY BETTER!

I made this for a Christmas party and everyone enjoyed it.  I will definitely be making this on the regular.  I made a slight adjustment by using taco seasoning instead of chili powder since that is all we had on hand.  Also, used less butter as others have suggested.

Delish.  I used 1 tsp chili powder, because I use the chili powder I get at the Indian grocery store, and it was still HOT.  I also added in 1/2 of a chopped onion mixed in with the potatoes.  Per previous reviews, I halved the butter and used lite Ranch.  This is a keeper.

I made this for a potluck, and it was tasty. I reduced the butter like other reviewers suggested, and I'm glad I did! I didn't peel the potatoes either, and it turned out just fine. The chili powder and ranch dressing give this a nice flavor, but I think next time I'll add some onion and bacon to give it more of a baked potato kind of taste. This recipe is a great base to work from.  The leftovers were delicious too! I heated the potatoes up, added crumbled bacon and scrambled eggs and it made a really tasty, filling morning meal.

Too much butter as written. I used olive oil instead and mixed the oil, spices, and potatoes in a bowl prior to putting in the baking pan. Added a few more spices and the potatoes were awesome!

I mostly followed the recipe & took a few tips from the reviews. I reduced by half for our family size & used a 2 lb. bag of baby red potatoes because that was what I had on hand. I combined the dry seasonings in a small bowl, put the cubed potatoes in a ziploc & poured 2 tbsp. of melted butter on potatoes then added the seasoning mix. Much easier to make sure everything is coated that way. I also did follow the suggestion & substitute seasoned salt for regular. This recipe was very simple to make & flavorful. Thanks for sharing it!

This was great!  I added seasoned salt and cut butter in half as suggested, and also added 1/2 a cup of diced raw onions into potato mixture at the beginning.  These were great even before adding the ranch and cheese- they'll be my new go-to potato recipe!

Let me just start this off by saying this...AMAZING!!! Hands down the best potato dish I have ever had.  I made a few changes to accommodate what I had on hand.  I used yukon gold potatoes.  I sprinkled them with chili powder and season salt.  Next, after the potatoes were done cooking for an hour I added homemade ranch dressing.  I only had about 1/2 a cup of dressing so I added milk to that to make it go further.  I then only had monterey jack cheese so I added that to the potatoes.  Talk about amazing!!!  This was a hit with my husband and my 5 year old son!  Definitely will be keeping this in my arsenal of favorite recipes.

I omitted the butter as many other reviews suggested and found it too dry. I put in about 4 Tbsp butter while mixing in the ranch and the cheese to get the texture I wanted. I then put it in a crock pot on warm so that I could take it to the in-laws for dinner, and I dont know if the crock pot contributed to the dryness, but by the time we ate it, it wasnt creamy anymore. Also, the warm ranch dressing flavor was slightly odd. Still tasty, but I will go back to cheese hashbrown casserole for next time.

Probably not the most healthy side dish I could make, but my kids will eat it so I will cut waaay back on the butter and use a good homemade dressing.  It was delicious.  I topped with Panko breadcrumbs just to get it a little crunch (because my son like it.).  Excellent recipe.  I will probably add in some of the Oscar Meyer bacon pieces next time and shred in a little onion (because my son likes the taste, but not the texture.)

I agree with others - this does not need all the butter.  I used 4 tbsp and next time will use even less.  The chili is a nice touch!  Pretty good recipe!

This was a little disappointing and didn't have as much zip as I was hoping it would.

These were pretty good, but seemed to lack seasoning.  I took the advice of others and cut the butter down to 3 Tbsp, but that was even too much and was still floating around the edges.  Next time I'm going to kick up the seasoning to make these spicy and add some green chilies and jalapenos.

OMG! This is not a dieter's recipe but definitely sinful indulgence! Added bacon too to make it even more naughty (but oh so good, as bacon makes just about everything yummier!). A little goes a long way in this recipe. Family loved it.

My BF is not a big potato fan and when he walked in and smelled these cooking he had to know what it was!  These were awesome!  Will make these a regular in our house!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe while on vacation and didn't want to have to bring along a big heavy bag of potatoes so I planned on buying the small precut ones at the store.  They didn't have them and all I could find were the tatertots so I tried it with them.  So good! I crumbled them up and baked the entire thing like the directions say. It added an extra crunch and were a big hit with my family.  The tater tots also made this a very fast and easy meal to prepare. Great for a big group of people.

Very Tasty! I loved the combination of ranch, cheese and spices! I will probably cut back on the butter next time, but really enjoyed it as written.

Easy & delicious!   I used fat free ranch dressing and only added about a tablespoon (or maybe even less) of butter, following the many suggestions to cut back.  I also used cheddar cheese, since that's what I had on hand.  This one is a definite keeper!

Waaaay too much prep time.  If I were to make this again, I'd just boil chunks.  It'd be faster & maybe better, too.  If you boil, add a little vinegar to the water.  It will help with keeping them white & slightly firm. Time 2:  Tried these again - to use up frozen shredded potatoes for hashbrowns.  'Can't say my review changed.  'Just not that good.  Not bad, but not worth making either.  'Did use up my hashbrowns though, but they weren't a hit with those either.

I used a little more than 4 pounds of potatoes, only used 5 tablespoons of butter and a little more cheese. It was good. Might make again.

3 out of 4 children liked this, and one parent (me), all in all it was a good solid side dish. However, none of us could taste the chili powder in the dish at all, don't think it did anything to the over all flavor of the dish. So in my opinion, it either needs to be omitted or increased, if increased omit the salt. The overall taste was for us, the cheese and ranch dressing. Would make again.

Very yummy!  This was a hit at our ANTI-Superbowl party.  I'd add a little more chili powder though...needs a little more "heat".  Thank you for a great recipe, JennyBrianne.

This was really good! I peeled the potatoes and cut the butter in half. Also added bacon like other people suggested. Next time I may do all of the butter because it was a tad dry. Very yummy and will definitely made again!

Excellent - I made it with no butter (just no-stick spray on the pan), and it was plenty rich enough.  The kids proclaimed them the best potatoes they've ever had.

WOWSERS! I plan on making this often! As per other reviews I used half the amount of butter, which I melted & then mixed with the chili powder/salt/pepper before tossing with the taters to give better coverage. Also, 1/4" cubes seemed really small so mine were more like 1/2 - 1" sized & cooked perfectly in the time suggested. I also subbed extra sharp cheddar cheese. And it turned out YUM YUM YUMMY!

Definitely a crowd-pleaser, but it was much heavier than I typically prefer. It can easily be made with half the butter, low-fat cheese, and low-fat ranch. Nobody misses a thing!

Not only am I giving this recipe five stars because it tastes good, but now we can say it is award winning!  I made this for a 'bake-off' competition at my work and am happy to say it won first place in the side dish category!  I prepared this dish with the skins on the potatoes and added about a package and a half of cheese.  I cooked it in the oven that morning and warmed it in the crockpot on low for three hours until lunch.  My pot not only burned everything on the edges but also contained potatoes swimming in a brown and oily mess (I guess from the cheese and butter sitting on low for too long).  HOWEVER, by the end of lunch time the entire pot was *empty*, and I had compliments on the dish for two weeks afterwards!  I made the potatoes a second time for my family at home, and they came out simply fabulous. This recipe is a must-try!

Absolutely delicious!  I made a few modifications -- added 1/3 lb. cooked and crumbled bacon with the dressing.  I also used 8oz of low fat sour cream, about 1/3- 1/2 cup skim milk (enough to make it the right consistency), and a package of ranch dressing mix (3 tbls)in place of the bottled dressing.  Served it with smoked ribs and my guests went wild!!!

This was really good and relatively easy to make. The chili powder gives it a very interesting flavor, but the dish does seem to be lacking in something. I'll try this again and add some bell peppers and a little minced garlic.

This recipe is really easy to make and follow, it was delicious, and a hit with my family.  I would definitely make this recipe again.  I added a bit more salt and chili powder than the recipe calls for because of my personal flavor preference for potatoes in general.

This was delicious!!! I didn't have colby-jack cheese so i ended up using sharp cheddar and mozzarella. I didn't use as many potatoes so I used less butter but the same amount of ranch and dressin.  Will definitely make again!!!

This was a fabulous change from the routine hash brown casserole with sour cream and soup.   It had great flavor, and I was able to lighten it up with reduced calorie dressing.  I did skip the butter in favor of a touch of olive oil, and I added some diced onions to the potatoes while they were roasting.   My family has said that it isn't a meal without potatoes, and this dish kept them happy.  Thanks!

I made this tonight and it was great. The only change I made was to use 1/3 of the butter. I kept the rest of the recipe the same. We will be adding this to our regular menu.

Awesome! I made this tonight with a few tweets. I used 1/3 butter as recommended and I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. I also used regular cheddar cheese because that's all I had on hand. I only used half of recommended for ranch and I added some New Orleans Cajun seasoning to enhance the flavoring. It was not spicy, just perfect. Next time I will try with bacon.

Every time I make this dish my family loves me even more for it. I use this for work pot lucks and holiday sides. I'm thinking the next time I make it (this week) I'll try adding some bacon to it. I always try adding and making changes to the recipe and every time is a success.

I usually make everything from scratch but tried this recipe on behalf of my kids who like to put ranch dressing on their potatoes. Very amazed that DH liked it more than anyone and asked me to save the left overs for him to eat the next day. I followed recipe except left out the butter. This is an easy dish to bring to a pot luck or holiday dinner.

Everyone said that they liked the potatoes. I halfed the recipe since I didn't want lots of left overs but somehow put the whole 8 oz of cheese so the cheese was a bit to much. I will definetly keep this in my menu rotation. Very easy to make too.

This is one of the best potato dishes I have made.  Another reviewer was right in that the chopping of the potatoes is the hardest part so the second time I made it, I used a chopper and that helped out greatly!  I made the exact recipe for 5 adults and went very quickly.  I doubled it the 2nd time around for 12 people and it went even faster!  I also baked the  potatoes the night before and put them in the crock-pot the day of my party and added the cheese and ranch and I also added bacon crumbles.. YUM-O!

We were a little disappointed in this.  I thought it was WAY too salty.  Sadly, I didn't read any reviews before I made this and so added the entire amount of butter (which like everyone else says, is not a good idea)  I agree with other reviewers too, that the warm ranch made the recipe taste a bit weird.  In addition to the chili powder, butter, pepper and salt, I also added some chopped onion, onion powder, and garlic powder.  I added both motz, and sharp cheddar on top.  Like I said, with the combo of all the ingrediants, it was very salty.  All three of my kids didn't like this at all and asked me not to make it a second time.

I've made this twice, the first time cutting butter down greatly and we couldn't get enough of it. I made it again with all cheddar cheese (all i had) and still cut the butter down...it was totally different than the first time. Not sure if it was the cheddar or if I didn't cut the butter down enough, but it was horrible. Grease was pouring out of the sides and pooled on top....it was soggy with grease!! And totally inedible. So....cut butter down (or emit!), use right kinda cheese.....and, I would allow yourself a little extra time and cut potatoes a little bigger. I think it does more for the taste and maybe helps soak up some of that butter! but your bake time will increase!

Loved it! My family devoured this dish. Only changes I made was I used Lite Peppercorn Ranch, cause that is what I had on hand & used less butter. Will make this again, and recommend to anyone thinking about trying this recipe!

This was a tasty potato dish and a nice change from regular au gratin potatoes. I halved the recipe and used 1/2 packet of ranch seasoning mixed with 1/2 cup buttermilk. Yum!

Yum! I made this over the grill, (Cooking the potatoes in the microwave until fork tender first), I mixed up everything except for the butter which I forgot and the cheese which I added the last 5 min on the grill to melt. I omitted the salt and didn't miss that or the butter. Thanks for the recipe:)

These potatoes are a new favorite side dish at our house. My kids really like the addition of ranch to the potatoes. I didn't use quite as much butter per other's reviews.

great everyone loved it, including my daughter who is a very picky eater!  We are Lacto-Ovo Vegan and this recipe was a great side dish.  I read many of the other reviews and I put only half the butter it called for, but it still was rather greasy, next time I will try omitting the butter all together (this is why I only gave it 4 stars because just to much butter!)

SOO yummy! I was running low on time and needed to fix something that would last my boyfriend and I a couple days, so I grabbed a rotisseire chicken from the store, shredded it up and tossed it in there with the cheese and ranch. I threw it back in the over according to the recipe and it, was, awesome!! The boyfriend loved it. I agree though, maybe a little less butter.

This is a good recipe. I have made it twice now and I like it the second time better. I put more cream cheese (whipped for a more smooth creamy texture), sour cream and butter. I didn't bake it the second time. I thought going exactly by the recipe and putting it in the oven dried it out. Don't put it in the oven and it comes out so much better.

This was terrific! I will make again and again! I am always trying to do something different with potatoes, as my husband and I both love them and have some sort of potato every night, now this recipe is definately in that rotation. I didnt change a thing.

Made this for my church small group dinner tonight and it was a hit! It was the first dish empty and I had several people ask for the recipe. I decided to omit the butter after reading the other reviews and instead tossed the potatoes in extra virgin olive oil along with the spices. Also subbed season salt for the regular salt. This dish is delicious!

Very good - my only complaint is the amount of time it takes to cut potatoes into 1/4 cubes!  I'm thinking it would be VERY helpful to just buy frozen potatoes next time...otherwise my husband and I (and company who was over)really enjoyed these!  (And didn't notice an overwhelming amount of butter, either...)

I have made these a couple times completely omitting the butter. I spray the potatoes with olive oil then season. To prevent sticking I use the Reynolds no stick foil. Comes out great each time!

Halved and made in 2 quart dish with glass lid instead of foil. Used food processor slicer with potatoes quartered. This just wasn't for us. Thanks!

This was so much better than it sounded (and it sounded good).  I only used 4 T of butter that I melted and sauteed some finely chopped leeks, added the spices and then poured over the potatoes and stirred to completely cover them.  Once they were done, I added the ranch dressing, cheese and some real crumbled bacon.  I will definitely make these again.

I like cheesy potatoes and was looking forward to giving it a different flavor with the ranch dressing... unfortunately, we didn't like this at all.  I used a good ranch dressing and followed the recipe exactly, but the flavor was off.  Not our cup of tea.

I used a little olive oil on the potatoes and omitted the butter, salt, and pepper. They turned out great.

I really liked that I could bake the potato cubes instead of boiling them, as most recipes have you do. I left the butter out altogether after reading the reviews, and this was still very fatty (and I never really eat low-fat per se). I thought it was very good, but lacking something. Maybe onion or garlic? Definitely something I'll keep and tweak.

i made a few changes, but im sure no matter how you make this it will turn out awesome!...i pre-boiled the potatoes. added salt, pepper, garlic powder, diced onions. baked for about 15 mins. added ranch, cheese and crumbled bacon. topped with panko bread crumbs and baked for another 5 or so minutes. SOOOO good! i cant wait to make this again! i will probably use fresh garlic instead of powder next time though.

Delicious!... I used 8 red potatos, cubed and boiled them in water until almost tender.( this cuts down on hte hour wait time). Changes, used season salt (2 tsp) and melted 4 tsp of butter to pour over.  Baked for about 15 minutes then added ranch, cheese and crumbed cooked bacon over the top. I only used enough ranch and cheese to cover most of the potatos.( About four or five squirts and two handfuls of cheese). Husband went back for seconds.

I made this recipe last night for dinner and it was really good!  I scaled the recipe to 4 services and from there followed the recipe exactly with three exceptions. I used seasoned salt, I dotted the top of the potatoes with only about 1 Tbsp of butter (which could easily be omitted in my opinion) and I used slightly more cheese than the recipe called for.  I also took the foil off after mixing in the cheese and dressing and baked for about 20 more minutes.  The end result was really good - even the kids ate it!

YUM! Just finished eating dinner and these potatoes are a 5 star winner! I cut the recipe in half and had more than plenty for my family of 5. I wasn't sure how the chili powder would taste with the dressing, but it was a nice combination! I did use light ranch dressing and cheddar cheese because that was what I had on hand. Tasted like a loaded baked potato...next time may have to add some crumbled bacon! Thanks for a great recipe!

I would consider that I made this darn close to as is, cause even though I tweaked a few things, they were mostly things that didn't really change it.  I used red potatoes since I never have russet around, and didn't peel them.  I used the Dry Buttermilk Ranch Mix from this site, mixed up with fat-free mayo and 1% milk, and then smart balance spread instead of butter, so that at least cut the fat a bit.  (I also had no problem with greasy.) So the fat really came from the cheese, and I used the cheddar-Jack I had on hand, but I think that or the colby-Jack called for would work equally as well.  These were very good - perhaps not a jump out at you wow, but very good.  I kept wanting to eat these instead of what else was on my plate.  (But I like about anything you can do to a potato, and I love cheese, so this is a bit of a given. :-))  I forgot to check them until about 55 minutes & they were already plenty done, and then another 5 for the cheese.

My family and I LOVE this recipe. I've been making it for a couple of years now. The only thing I do differently is that I don't use butter. I think the dressing provides plenty of moisture for the potatoes.

This was pretty good. I think the biggest advantage is that you could make it for a bunch of people at one time. I changed some stuff around like many people did. I added some bacon and chives to the mix. I think I wouldn't have minded just a little sour cream on top when I served it either. Didn't have any on hand so I will try it for next time. It is hard to see this really being on a healthy menu but it is very yummy. I will make this again for sure.

A definite keeper!  Made this the night before in the oven with the diced frozen potatoes - then added in the cheese and dressing and cooked on low in a crock pot for 3 hours.  Perfect!  Work people loved it and hubby and family loved the leftovers!

These potatoes are very tasty, I followed the recipe as written. I left the skins on and cubed the potatoes a bit larger, so they took about an hour and 15 mins to bake before adding the other ingredients. I greased my baking dish with olive oil, and after I added the dressing and cheese, baked for about 10 minutes more. I think next time I may add some finely diced onion & fresh parsley to the potatoes as they bake because I felt it lacked some flavor. Thanks for sharing :)

This is a keeper. Yummy. So simple to make and filling enough to be a meal in of itself. I added some leftover ham I had on hand but it would be just as good without it. And really, I think you could customize the flavors anyway you like using a different spice and different creamy salad dressing.

I completely omitted the butter and used some olive oil instead - you don't want the potatoes to dry out and you want the spices to stick! It turned out really well. I guessed on the cheese and ranch since I didn't make four pounds of potatoes. This is great!

I'm only giving this three stars because it was soooooooo greasy. It was very good but the pool of oil that it was sitting in almost made me not eat it. You can even see all the grease in the picture I took. I didn't use as much butter as the recipe stated and still very greasy. Will make again just change it a little bit.

These were great! I did peel the potatoes and cut into inch chunks. I couldn't believe the directions meant to cut to 1/4" cubes, that would be like shredded hash browns. I thought maybe it meant to quarter, so anyway I halved the recipe to try, forgot to halve the spices, but everyone said how good they were, and no, I was not allowed to change the spices! I "roast" potatoes like this in butter off and on, so didn't find anything greasy about it. I would say it was buttery. The potatoes cooked for me in 35 minutes, good thing I checked them. I only put back in for five. Next time I make a full batch, I will cook till tender and add cheese and dressing without cooking any longer. Thanks for the recipe! Good Stuff!

Beauty of this one is, no precision required.  Sprinkle and pour - whatever you think would be good.  We add the bacon bits and the french fried onions.  It's delicious.

I brought this dish to a BBQ this weekend and it was a big hit.  I made this recipe the day before and divided into two dishes instead of one large one.  I put one dish in the microwave to warm and served.  The dish was empty in no time.  I did make a few changes per other reviewers.  I used red potatoes, seasoning salt, mexican cheese mix, added sauteed onion, bacon and garlic powder.  I used "I Can't Believe It's Butter", sprayed the potatoes and mixed everything together.  Used one can of French Fried Onions on the top and cooked for 45 mins, covered.  Uncovered and cooked an additional 5 mins.  Yummy!

fab!! i didn't omit butter and my honey is more particular than i and we didn't find to greasy however we had cut the recipe in half?? don't think that wd matter however!! maybe the others used a different type of potato than called for and that cd have made a difference as some potatoes are drier than others?? i made exactly as called for and was great!! wouldn't change a thing other than i used fat free cheese and fat free dressing! will try without butter next time and c what all the fuss is about!!

These were great! I cut the butter back to 2 tablespoons and worked out great. My family loved them! If you are not a fan of chili powder, substitute a light sprinkling of paprika instead.

Mmmmmm!  I didn't have any problem with my potatoes being greasy like so many other reviewers but I did forget to cover them the first 40 minutes of baking so maybe that helped.  I didn't have co-jack so I used a Mexican blend figuring it tied in with the chili powder.  Thanks for the recipe!

These potatoes were good!  I would recomemmend less ranch dressing (half a bottle instead of a whole one) and a little more seasoning, overall.  Also, we used gold potatoes instead of russet ones, which turned out nicely.  I will make this recipe again, only with the changes I listed above.

This is a wonderful dish.  I browned some brats, sliced them and added them in when I added the cheese & ranch.  This was scrumptious.

We really liked this dish, a bit greasy from all the butter but very yummy, I don't see why the butter couldn't be cut way down or even taken out.

A great recipe that I will probably make again.  I scaled it down for just two and my wife and I loved it.  It went well w/ some pork chops we had.  I think next time I will add a little cooked bacon to really make it a masterpiece.  Well done!

This was flavorful, but did find it to be a bit greasy. I think next time I'd omit the butter and opt for cooking spray instead. I will also use a bit more potatoes, maybe mine were too small, but there was a lot more 'stuff' than potato here. I think with the above named alterations, tho, that this would deserve 4 stars.

I found the ranch dressing very salty and quite strong, so I added sour cream to tone it down a bit. However, I Made it to take to a BBQ and it went pretty quickly...
would I make it again?...
Probably, but I'll change a few things, maybe a different brand of ranch dressing and different cheese. I'll experiment

Yum! I cut recipe in half and used a bag of frozen hash brown cubes. Only cooked for 30 minutes before adding dressing/cheese. Otherwise followed as written. Perfect side dish for kielbasa.

I did not read the reviews before I made it. They are correct it is very greasy if you use all that butter. The second time I made it, I only used half the amount it called for. So much better the second time! My kids loved it!

This recipe has been a staple at our house for months. I've always followed the recipe to the letter and it's always turned out amazing! tonight however after reading some of the reviews I put a lot less butter in it and it turned out even better! if that's even possible. thank you so much for this recipe.

I make this VEGAN in a crockpot for potlucks all the time now! I usually microwave the potatoes with the margarine, salt, pepper, and chili powder for a bit first, then mix with the other ingredients in the crockpot and cook on low for 5-6 hours. For a vegan version, just sub vegan cheddar shreds (Daiya works great) and margarine for the dairy versions. Instead of ranch dressing, I‚Äôve found several store brand ranch seasoning packets that are dairy-free! Just check ingredients! I just mix the ranch seasoning with tofutti sour cream and almond milk. Everyone always raves over it! :)

I actually used a tub of Philadelphia dip (herb and garlic) instead of the ranch.  The butter I just drizzled on top, then sprinkled with cereal (krispies or corn flakes).  Also added some sliced green onions, really good and had lots of compliments.  Nice change from the regular hash brown potatoes.

Last night I made a change that cut my prep time to under 15 minutes.  My family loves this recipe but I just hated the "potato job", so I decided to try using frozen Country Style Hash Browns and it worked great.  I put the bag in the fridge in the morning then poured it in a large colander to drain, but that wasn't really necessary.  That was my final change.  I also omit the butter.  I mixed the dry spices, adding 1/2 tsp. each of garlic & onion powders, Tony Chachere's (Creole seasoning) instead of salt, with 3 tablespoons olive oil and tossed the thawed potatoes in it.  I baked them, covered with foil, and they were done in 45 minutes.  I added the cheese, ranch dressing, bacon bits and green onions and put them back in the oven for about 10 minutes.  Everyone said they were just as good as when I made them with "real potatoes".

Great recipe! I will make it again and I did go with the suggestion of less butter.

Yum! I seasoned the potatoes with ranch dressing mix (instead of salt/pepper) and chili powder, then only added cheese at the end. Served with sour cream. Definitely making this again!

Huge hit here- have made it a bunch of times as described (super good) and recently substituting Trader Joe's Quattro Formaggio (Asiago, fontina, provolone, and Parmesan) that gave it a little sharper taste that still went well with the ranch.

I just tried this recipe for the first time and it's the best one I've found! The only thing I added was a little velveeta cheese to make it creamier and bacon bits for flavor. This dish was a hit with my whole family and I will definitely use it again!

Made this to go with ham. Really good.  Made it easier and healthier:
cube & parboil 3 lbs red potatoes until not quite done, drain and let steam dry for a bit. Add 2-3 Tbsp buter, salt & pepper and toss in lightly. Put in greased (with olive oil), 9x13 casserole.  Sprinkle with chili powder to your taste. Let sit and cool until half an hour before you need to serve them. Drizzle on 1 cup homemade ranch dressing and sprinkle with 1 cup grated Colby-Jack cheese.  Bake at 375 for 30 minutes.  Everyone raved!

kids loved this..Which is all that matters in my world. I added a cut up onion to the potatoes during the first bake to add additional flavor. I also didn't have shredded cheese so I cut up velveeta and added it with the ranch.

This was great!  Like other reviewers cut back on butter.  Used, at the most 3 tablespoons.  Added in dressing and cheese but a little less than what recipe said.  I t was so easy and fed a crowd at our church potluck.  The whole dish was gone!  Will definitely make again!

The potatoes were swimming in melted butter! It almost made me gag and ruined the dish for me. I may make it again, but will definitely half the amount of butter.

Absolutely delicious! I used about 5-6 lbs of both red and russet potatoes. I also used the full amount of butter and I didn't find it to be too much (like other's mention). It seemed like a lot of it absorbed into the potatoes. I didn't put in any salt, and i'm glad! The ranch dressing has enough flavoring where you don't need to add any salt.

This was good, but I should have listened to other reviews that said omit the butter. I used only 3TBS of butter thinking it wouldn't be too greasy, but I was wrong. There was a lake of grease in the bottom of the pan, and my potatoes wouldn't even stay in place on my plate because of the grease. it slid around in one giant greasy lump. Next time I will definitely leave out the butter.

This was awesome!  I lowered the fat -- I completely left off the butter, and was so glad I did.  I used 4 cubed russet potatoes, spritzed with olive oil, sprinkled with chili powder, salt & pepper (I didn't measure), and baked only 35 minutes.  I then stirred in 3/4 cup light Ranch, and 1 cup reduced fat cheese.  Loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this differently. I made whipped potatoes and then mixed 1 cup of cheese in with the chili powder into the potatoes. I baked for 1/2 hour covered. Then mixed 3/4 cup of ranch and 1 cup of cheese together and topped the potatoes. Cooked for about 15 minutes (or until well browned) Stirred everything together after it was done. Perfect for a person who just had their tonsils out. Also wonderful without the chili powder. This is great for people who are allergic to pepper. Same wonderful taste!

This had lots of flavor with the addition of some chopped onion and a little garlic.  I used a drizzle of olive oil, instead of the butter to cut the fat and used 1/2 of the Ranch dressing and 1/2 of the cheese.  Really good!  Will make again.

This was easy and pretty good.  A little greasy, but I think I could have cut back on the butter or use so olive oil instead and it would have been fine.  I added a little bit of turkey bacon.  I will definetely make this again.

Yum! Not only was this a winner for my hubs and I, our two neighbors who stopped by for dinner enjoyed it too! This was a perfect accompainment to serve alongside BBQ brisket sandwiches and everyone agreed. :) I might even play around with this next time and use half BBQ sauce / half ranch dressing for a little kick! I pretty much followed Jen's directions to the letter expect for one significant change. Instead of cubing Russets, I purchased (2) 20 oz. bags of Simply Potatoes brand diced potatoes & onions (I used 1 1/2 bags worth and saved the rest to use later). I baked my potatoes for an hour and then added the Ranch and cheese and continued as directed. For a little oomph, I doubled the chili powder, used seasoned salt in lieu of regular table salt and added ~ 1/4 c. of bacon bits. Next time I'll use REAL bacon tho.... NOTE: Instead of dotting my potatoes with butter (this calls for WAY too much butter, IMHO), I mixed them with 1.5 T garlic infused EVOO. I think using bacon grease would also work (and would make these OMG flavorful!!!). Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, JENNYBRIANNE! These were the BOMB!!! :-)

Cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8x8in pan. Added about 2 tblsp finely diced onions to the potatoes before baking.  They were tender and ready to have the ranch and cheese added after about 30 mins.  Cooked for 5 mins longer, then under the broiler for another 5.  Family decided it was defiantly a keeper and requested that I add chopped bacon to it when I make it again

This had a pretty good taste and helped liven up the usual potato dish.  I took the advise of other reviewers and only did 2 tbls of butter, which I melted and added the spices to it and then poured over the potatoes and mixed.  Some others said they didn't like the warm ranch dressing taste and maybe they didn't put the potatoes back in the oven for the 10 minutes after adding that and the cheese because I couldn't tell it was/used to be dressing (I think it baked into the potatoes during that time).  Anyway, everyone liked them and it will be placed in the "rotation".

Very good. Everyone loved it. I followed others advice and didn't use butter. I just sprayed the pan with Pam and it turned out great.

This simple potato dish turned out way better than I had hoped. I'm choosey about my Ranch dressing, so I picked the brand I like best: O'Charley's. I did use the entire 16 oz. of the dressing in the casserole and I'm glad I did. It was rich and creamy mixed in with the melted cheese. Thanks for this great side dish that my husband and I really enjoyed!

Oh, and I didn't think the butter made the dish greasy, although the creaminess of the melted cheese and dressing would probably mean you could leave it out altogether.

I actually used Yukon Gold potatoes as I thought they would be a bit creamier. I seasoned the potatoes with some salt, added the chili powder and baked them in the oven the night before. I did leave out the butter, so many reviews seem to say leave it out or cut it back. I doubled the cheese/ranch dressing as I actually used 5 pounds of potatoes and many reviewers said, increase the amount. I added some garlic powder and minced onion. I only used half the cheese/ranch mixture to marinate the dish overnight and then to bake it the next day. I added some bacon bits before I baked. I agree with many reviewers, even though I salted the potatoes, used minced onion, bacon bits, and some garlic powder there is just something missing. You wouldn't think these would taste "flat" but they really did. Hmmm, maybe it needs a stronger cheese, but one that melts smoothly.

We thought this was good.  I'm glad I looked over the reviews before making because the 6 tablespoons of butter would of been way more than needed.

My husband loved this and said it may be his new favorite potato dish! Don't forget to spray the dish before putting your potatoes. I forgot and it was quite a mess to clean. Other than that, great side dish!

I did not care for this, but my parents really liked it.  There was a flavor in it that turned me off.  I think I might have liked it better with sharp cheese, but maybe it's just that warm ranch dressing isn't appealing to me.  However, my dad went back for seconds (and thirds), so maybe it's just me...

These potatoes were excellent, and a huge hit with my kids! I cut the margarine in half, and after reading other reviews I also made the following changes.  I added cooked diced bacon, and sauted onions and double the ranch dressing and cheese.  Delicious! Will definately be making this again.  Thank you!!!

Not enough cheese and ranch, to much potatos. I would use less chilli powder and NO butter! Also, the potatos took WAY longer than an hour to cook, and never got really tender.

These were a huge hit at our potluck event.  I used 1/3 cup veg oil instead of butter.  Added 1/4 chopped onion which added a nice flavor. I also used seasoning salt to keep it simple.  Will make again!

I picked this recipe because my 10 year old has never liked potatos, not even french fries (I know he's weird ;o). He LOVED them. In fact everyone did, will definately be making these again. Oh if you are watching your weight...this is not for you. ???

I thought these potatoes were ok.  Nothing really special about the taste.

Love it!  I use about 1/2 stick of butter and I don't add it until I add the cheese and dressing. I use kraft dressing and seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  The potatoes are super soft after 1 hour, and I cube them 1/2 inch or so.  I top with a bit of cheese and broil to brown.  YUMMY!!

Awesome potato casserole.  I used a ranch dressing with parmesan and roasted onion, I think that made the dish.

This one has winner stamped all over it.  This is such an excellent web site and being able to read the reviews is VERY helpful.  Having said that, I have a combination microwave/convection oven and I cooked the spuds for 25 minutes on the half-time setting (uncovered) and 5 more minutes on just the microwave "high" setting.  Didn't use any butter but did carmelize some onions to put on as a topping after the ranch dressing and cheese.  Wonderful dish!

This is easy and delicious.  I only used 4 Tbsp. butter & that was plenty.  Next time, I'll make sure I have bacon bits on hand.

I made this recipe for my family's Easter dinner and brought very little home. My Mother isn't much on potatoes but she bragged on how good it was. It will become a regular from now on whenever we all get together.

I made this recipe as a main course for friends who are vegetarian and they loved it. Instead of using bottled dressing I used a dry pkg of Ranch Dressing mix added to 16 oz of sour cream. The 6 Tbsp of butter called for in this recipe was just right -- not too much.

Heavenly! I made this for a family potluck and it was gone in less than 3 minutes which made some people very angry and caused family drama. lol. I too only used 2 tsp butter as mentioned by other users.

These potatoes were amazing.  My whole family loved them.  I did follow the advice of some of the other reviewers and scaled back the butter (I used about 2 T).  So easy to make and delicious!

My friends loved this. I cooked the potatoes in the oven and then transferred them to my crock pot. I heated them up on low with bacon flavored ranch and added the cheese about 20min before it was time to eat.

Great recipe -definitely a 'keeper'! Made only a few changes; cut the butter down to 2 Tbsp, cut chili powder down to 1 tsp (kids coming to dinner), used Ranch dressing with bacon (Kraft), added a few liberal shakes of 'Mrs Dash' and used half TexMex cheese (Kraft) and half Gruyere (you use what you can find in the house sometimes!) This was my contribution to a family Christmas dinner and it was a real hit! Everyone had seconds and thirds and wanted the recipe! Thanks for a stellar recipe, JENNYBRIANNE!

Very good!  I do use way less ranch dressing and whatever cheeses I have on hand.  I just use enough dressing to moisten everything and I also use a few tbs of olive oil in place of the butter.  I just cannot get over the thought of using a whole bottle of unhealthy dressing on top of a lot of butter.  My family loves it with the changes I made.

Really easy and tasty.  I just chopped the potatoes covered with a couple tbs olive oil and seasonings into a slow cooker on high for a few hours till done.  Dumped the cheese and ranch in and warmed through.  Yum.

AWESOME!  I have made this several times.  I only spray the dish with non-stick spray and omit the rest of the butter.  I have also used real bacon bits (awesome as well).  I add garlic seasoning and ground red pepper as well.

These are very good potatoes. I have made something similar in the past but without the chili pepper and it wasn't as good...so the secret ingredient must be the chili pepper!  You can adjust the dressing and cheese to your liking.

This is so yummy!  I did not want to have to peel and cut up all those potatoes so what I did was make a big bowl of instant mashed potatoes and then i added a can of potatoes and mashed all that together.  Then I added in all the ingredients called for.  I did not use bottle ranch dressing but made homemade ranch dressing.  Then, I popped in the oven at 350 degrees for around 10-15 minutes.  So delicious!  I think next time I will add in some bacon.

This gets 4 stars only because I had issues with the butter separating. It was really tasty, and I would make it again, but I just wish there was a way to keep it from getting that weird oily texture. I think a good idea might be to keep the same measurements, but boil the potatoes first, then make a roux with the butter, some flour, and some milk.... then add the ranch and cheese to the roux until melted, stir in the potatoes, and bake. This might keep everything together more. I would stir it all up, and 2 seconds later it was separating again. Looked gross, tasted yummy!

Aside from the chopping, this recipe was very easy.  I didn't measure anything and I omitted the butter, salt and pepper!  I cleaned and chopped (no peeling) a 5-pound bag of red potatoes, tossed them with chili powder and rosemary seasoning (just enough to coat) and baked them for about 45 minutes.  I baked them on a silicone liner so I didn't even need cooking spray.  Then, I scooped out the amount I wanted for dinner, mixed in just enough of the dressing (Ken's buttermilk ranch) to coat them and shredded cheese and baked them for another 5-7 minutes until the cheese melted.    My little ones loved them and they usually don't eat potatoes, except for fries.  I put the remaining roasted potatoes in the freezer so the next time I want to make this recipe, the job will be even easier!  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  I made a few changes to cut down on fat/calories...butter-flavored PAM rather than butter, reduced fat dressing and cheese.  The flavor wasn't affected in the least.  I did add 1/2 onion (chopped roughly), used season salt, and didn't bother to peel the potatoes.

I reduced the butter to 1 Tbsp, added about 1/2 cup minced onions, & 1 tsp garlic in addition to the spices listed. I also used a lite ranch dressing to reduce the calories. It wasn't bad, the kids really liked it and said they want it again.

These were awsome!!!  The only thing I did differently was cut back on the butter. Everyone loved them.  Will most definitely make again.

OMG!!!! I mad ethis last night and it was AMAZING!!! I couldn't stop eating it. The only thing I added was instead of 8oz of ranch I did 5 oz ranch to 3 oz sour ceam. ONLY because My husband doesn't care for ranch it just toned it down a bit. I will be making this forever!

As a fan of potatoes, ranch, and cheese, this was right up my alley.  To suit my family's tastes, I used less ranch and more cheese.  It was very good.  Can't wait to try leftovers tomorrow for lunch.

This was a really easy & good recipe - although very rich!  I made the recipe as is, but, I only used 2 tbsp of butter and used yukon gold potatoes.  I will definitely make this again, but, next time I will top with chopped green onions and crispy bacon.

These were really good - possibly even better the next day.  I definitely used light ranch, and didn't use the full amounts of ranch or cheese.  Hubby loved them - good for a potluck.

This was a great dish!  I did put the 6T of butter in it, but I agree that the butter is not necessary.  I didn't use any salt; instead, I replaced it with garlic.  This will be a repeat recipe for sure!

Very tasty. I made a few changes based on other reviews and my own tastes. I cut the recipe down but didn't measure anything Added some diced sweet onion and a big sprinkle of garlic power. I mixed in about 3/4c of ham.I used olive oil instead of butter. Baked about 40 minutes then stirred in the ranch dressing and a handful of cheese. Topped with another handful of cheese and panko bread crumbs and dotted the top with about 2T. of butter. Made a great main dish with some frozen peas and sliced tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe

This was very good recipe.  I think maybe I didnt use enough Ranch.  I made the ranch dressing from the packet so I could control the fat.  I used lowfat Mayo and it was very good.  I also added ham as some had suggested so I could use this as an entree.

This was an easy dish that paired well with my meatloaf and baked alongside in the oven. Mine turned out very greasy though because of the cheese and maybe Velveeta would work better? I microwaved this until the potatoes were tender and finished it in the oven. I thought it was rather tasty, my husband did not like it at all. The Hungry Teen eats everything and isn't picky hence the name. Thanks for sharing this, I thought it had some potential given a few tweaks.

I got this recipe a few years back and I am still making it! We absolutely love it and everyplace I have taken it, everyone asks for the recipe. I do cut down on the butter, by about half, but other than that I follow the recipe as written. Thanks so much for such a great recipe!

These turned out very good.  However, don't make the same mistake I did.  I peeled and diced my potatoes the night before, seasoned them with chili powder, salt, and pepper, then stored in the fridge to bake the next day.  Well, the next morning, they were all watery and swimming in liquid.  I drained them, and immediately popped them in the oven to "dry out" a bit.  Then I put them into a crockpot with the colby-jack cheese, ranch dressing, and a sprinkle of onion powder and garlic power.  I cooked them on LOW for about 3 hours, turning to WARM right before dinner.  They were cheesy, gooey, and full of ranch flavor.  I probably would have added bacon too but my niece is a vegetarian.  My whole family enjoy these as part of my Easter dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe, JennyBrianne!  (Next time, I'll follow the cooking directions as written...)

I made this recipe just as written and wish I would have taken the other reviewers advice-leave the butter out!  The potatoes were great but I had to spoon at least 1/4 cup grease from the bottom of the pan!  I wil make again and maybe add some bacon on the top but leave the butter out!

I followed the directions exactly aside from using about 1 tablespoon of olive oil in place of the butter, and we were not impressed with the results. The flavor was just okay and we all left the table feeling "heavy."

This was a huge hit! I did make a few additions. I cut back on the butter as advised by many other reviewers and I'm glad I did. I added fried crumbled bacon an dried onion rings. My BF's teen kids had thirds! We all loved it! I think this would be great with eggs for a Sunday brunch.

Delicious! Per other reviews I only added 4 tablespoons butter, which I think was still a little much. For my breakfast the next day I had a scrambled egg over the potatoes with some bacon crumbles, fantastic.

I made these the other night and they received rave reviews! The only thing I changed was that I added some chicken that I had boiled, shredded, and seasoned with the same spices used in the recipe (chili powder, salt, and pepper). It was delicious, both my husband and young son loved them. This will become a regular at our house!!

I agree with others you need to cut out the butter or cut it out completely.  I saved time cutting potatoes by using frozen potatoes for hash browns

This turned out really good. I took the strong warning of another reviewer and omitted the butter. It als would be good to add bacon to this.

I can't stop eating these darn potatoes!  I used a drizzle of olive oil in place of the butter, but other than that I followed the recipe.  I did dice my potatoes quite small, so they were done in 45 minutes.  Definitely a keeper!

My family could not get enough of these potatos. I only made a small batch for lunch and was sorry I did not make more.  I did not use the chili powder or much butter, but did sprinkle with bacon bits and topped with sour cream. I  will make a full batch for dinner tonight. Thanks for the recipe.

This was excellent!  I omitted the butter completely and added Bacon Bits per other reviewers.  However I used very little Ranch to coat them as Hubby is not so fond of it.  A great side dish!

WOW!  I made this for a trick-or-treat potluck & nothing was left...everybody loved it.  I used a 5 lb bag of red potatoes (skins left on) & used a little over 1/2 a brick of colby-montery jack & a little over 1/2 a brick of colby-cheddar cheese (I prefer shredding my own-I think it melts better).  I cooked the potatoes in the oven for about an hour, then put in the crock pot with the cheeses and ranch on low while we went trick-or-treating.  Everything was cooked perfectly when it was time to eat.  Adding bacon bits as other reviewers mentioned would've been awesome because it reminded me of potato skins.

Was a very yummy & easy side to our grilled bugers.  I agree with many of the other reviewers & think the butter can be cut down on some without sacrificing flavor.  I used a mixture of jack cheese, sharp cheddar and american cheese.  Perfect for a large group---could easily be kept warm in a crock pot.

Very good! I only used 2 Tbsp. butter because that's what I had left with the stick I was using, and because I read the reviews that say to use less. I do believe that the butter is unnecessary though, because when you eat it, there is a puddle of grease/butter left on the plate from it. I think I used a little less ranch than was called for too. I thought it was just fine, but my fiance added ranch to his, but to be fair he adds ranch to everything :P...Oh, I think I should add that the potatoes turned out PERFECT, because every time I cook with potatoes, I'm worried that they'll be dry, but they weren't at ALL. I know I can't be the only person that worries about that!  I would definitely recommend it, it's really good. It seems like one of those dishes you'd make for a family reunion or something.

Oh my goodness!  These are so good, but so rich.  In fact, they might be a little too heavy!  I even halved the butter, and they were still too greasy.  I do love the combination of potatoes, ranch and cheese (it's heavenly), but I need to play around with this recipe to lighten it up a bit.  My "inner health nut" is protesting this recipe!  I followed the recipe to a tee (except for halving the butter) and I love the chili powder!  Thanks for the great idea!

Love these!  I don't add or leave out anything in the recipe, I think it's great the way it is.  I bake the potatoes for an hour and then just mix in the ranch and cheese.  I don't worry about putting them back in the oven for the additional time.  The potatoes are hot enough that the cheese melts just fine.  Yum!

This rocks! Just finished yesterdays left-overs and it was just as good. I increased the cheese which I loved but kids thought it was too cheesey- they still gave it 4 and 5 stars though, & I just added enough ranch to coat, about 1/4 bottle. Also added 5 strips of crumbled bacon. Will definately make again!

I loved this recipe, but wanted to make it a main dish for dinner, so I changed it a little. I lessened the chili powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons and added 1/4 teaspoon paprika. I also added 2 teaspoons garlic. I omitted all the butter, but added 1 1/2 tablespoons of Omega-3 oil (nutritious and prevents any sticking). After cooking the potatoes, I used Annie Cowgirl Ranch Dressing and added 1 package of Lightlife's Smart Ground Veggie Protein. Turned out great. Next time, I may add some jalapenos or hot sauce and try fat free cheese.

I made it exactly as stated and my guests really like this side dish that we served with grilled steaks. It wasn't very spicy so all the kids ate it, although if I were making it for just adults, I would have definitely added some extra chili powder and maybe even some sliced hot peppers to spice it up some more.  Overall, fun recipe that could be altered easily to fit your wants.

There was way too much butter and I even cut the amount in half.  I was hoping the potatoes would crisp more in the oven, but they didn't.  Too much ranch for my taste, you couldn't even taste the potato itself.

I used Gold potatoes as suggested by some reviewers - one note would be to leave your potatoes in very big cubes/chunks - they cook so well in the hour that mine ended up too mushy when I added the ranch. Taste was still outstanding but the texture was like mashed potatoes...will definitely keep working on this one though! Thanks for the recipe!

AWESOME, thats the word to describe these potatoes. And so easy! 

Its just my husband and I so I bought 3 large idaho potatoes and used about 2 tb of butter a cup of cheese and just mixed in ranch until I was happy.
Didn't use the chili poweder, neither of us likes spicy stuff.

Mine did stick to the bottom, BAD. I even pamed it! Dunno what happened. So they were a bit mashed lol.

Thanks for the great recipe, try it yall!

Great recipe; I added French's french fried onions to the top to make it slightly crispy.  Had everyone at a work potluck asking me for this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

YumYumYum it was fabulous. We loved it !!! I used swiss cheese instead of monterey (we have a lot of cheese in france but not that one) and only half the required amount of RANCH dressing and it was pefect !! Thx

I thought this was way too thick and rich.  I couldn't eat it at all.  Maybe chunking the potatoes instead of shredding them would make it less dense. Using lighter ingredients may also help.

Followed the recipe, took others' suggestions and cut the margarine back a bit and melted prior to mixing with the potatoes.  Family really liked it!

This was very yummy but I thought it could have used less ranch dressing (I thought it was a little overpowering).  I will make this again but will use less next time.

My family loves potatoes, so this was never gonna be a problem when i put it on their plates!
It was fantastic!! So yummy and so cheesy!
I cooked it as the recipe follows... sort of! (but who cares if its not exactly the same??? a good cook always improvises!!) I did not peel the potatoes, listened to all the other reviews about being too greasy so when i added the seasonings, i just coated them in olive oil and added a little garlic for our taste. I used my hands to coat everything and baked as directed. I dont remember how long it took to bake as i just cooked it until the potatoes tasted perfect.
As i live in Australia and we dont have the cheese listed i just used plain shredded colby, and added a little extra pepper. The ranch dressing is ingenious though! How could you not like potatoes, cheese and ranch??
Thanks!!

I made this to go with our supper tonight and it was a great hit!  The seasonings and ranch dressing gave the potatoes good flavor, and cheese seems to make everything a little better!  I will be making this recipe again, but am planning to use less butter next time.  It was a little too greasy, and there was quite a bit of melted butter left on the bottom of the dish.

Thanks for a terrific new favorite, with one minor adjustment! :)

I love these potato's! My nephew loved the kick with the chili podwer. I used a little less butter than what was called for and they were amazing. I am asked to bring these to most of the parties I go to. I will definately make them again!!!

Awesome!!!  Tried this on my hubby and kids first, they gave it a thumbs up.  Next I made this for a huge family party and everyone raved about and wanted the recipe.  The only change I made was using peeled redskin potatoes - I just think they hold up better to the the baking process than the russets.  We needed a new potatoe dish and this was just what the doctor ordered!!!

As is - I gave it 4 stars.  It was very yummy but swimming in butter when all was said and done - YOU DEFINITELY NEED LESS BUTTER!  I loved its flavor - but literally served it with a slotted spoon to drain some of the butter off each serving.  Next time - 1/2 the butter for sure!  The flavors were delicious though and I will make it again.

This was a big hit at a b-day party I went to this pass weekend for a 7 year old. All ages went back for more.
I use bacon ranch dressing and crumbled bacon on top.

This was really good!  I just need to remember to read ALL reviews before trying something - was definately a little too greasy and I should have left the skins on because the potatoes were a litte mushy.  Overall a great recipe though, thanks!

Scaled this up for 250 servings to have at our annual pigroast.  Prep time over the usual cheesy grated potatos I have made in years past was cut drastically.  This is so easy to put together and tastes great.  I subbed cheddar for colby/jack and added dried minced onion.  Highly recommended!

My daughter and husband really enjoyed this.  I only thought it was okay.  I also left the skins on my potatoes, which was a great suggestion.  I used Cabot 50% less fat cheddar and added a couple of sliced of sauted bacon and half a sauted onion.  It was very easy though and I will likely make again since it was such a hit with everyone else.

Very good, but extremely rich.  Will cut down on butter even more next time, also the cheese too.  Might also add onions to give it more.

I've made this three times now; it was very well received in my house.  I appreciate the reviewers who recommended cutting down the butter and leaving the skins on.  I have a french-fry cutter that makes cubing the potatoes a snap.  Ends up being very easy to prepare.  Sharp cheddar is our cheese of choice for this one.

I listened to the other reviews and used only half of the butter, but used no chili powder. It was great, my husband enjoyed it also. I only gave 4 stars b/c I think a few more things can be added to this recipe to make it perfect. All in all it was great!

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!!  I made this for a cook out and it was all the rave.  I did not change anything and it was wonderful.  I thought it was going to be too greasy but once I added the cheese and ranch dressing it wasn't at all.  Totally recommend trying this recipe. You will not be sorry!

I made this dish tonite and listened to the reviews about the butter.  I added only a little over a tablespoon and they were just right.  Also, if you like a little kick - add more chili powder.  This was so good.

I've made this many times, requested by my family, but the other reviews are correct. It is very greasy and you can feel it sticking to your thighs as you eat it. If you are looking for lowfat, look somewhere else! I want to point out that someone said something about peeling the potatoes first. Are you kidding? I won't sit there and peel 4 pounds of potatoes! It is just as yummy with the peels on and you at least get a few vitamins with all the fat. No, really, fatty comments asided, it's yummy!

This got rave review at a company party! It was the first time I made it and I'd do it again because it was soo easy. The hardest part was peeling and cutting the potatos. I did use the season salt instead of regular salt as suggested by another. I baked the potatoes first in the oven, then used the crock pot for the rest of the baking and warming at the party. It went over well!

This was really tasty. I would‚Äôve like to take a photo of it but the only thing left is an empty Pyrex dish. My hubby and son both loved it and it‚Äôs important to know that my husband does not even like ranch dressing. I cut the recipe in half which was more than enough for the three of us. I left out that chili powder and butter. Turned out amazing!

I did saute some onions for my preference. Nice change in potato side dish.

Followed the recipe for the most part- I reduced the amount of butter to 4 tablespoons based on input from others.  Melted the butter and mixed in the spices.  Made for better distribution throughout the dish.  Had a packet of Ranch dip mix, so that was whipped up and used in place of bottled.  Always a hit!

I reduced the amount of butter based on other reviews but it ended up being a little dry. Next time I will either add the amount of butter it called for or add a little more ranch. Absolutely delicious, though!

Followed the recipe other than adding some seasoned salt to the potatoes. This was too rich for me. BF loved it and ate the whole thing. (I downsized the recipe for 2)

Baked at 350 for an hour. Then added dressing and cheese and cooked until melted. Also used seasoning salt instead of salt. Made for Easter dinner and it was very good.

Ideal as a companion to a roast.  Because I was making 1/4 quantity, I think I put in too much ranch dressing so it was a bit rich.  I also put in 1 T chili powder and 1/2 t black pepper and found the spice was needed for our pallet

Not too heavy; delicious and easily personalized by adding a protein or veggie. Will definitely make again. I would recommend meal prepping beforehand so all you have to do is mix together and cook when you make this dish.

My potato cubes were a lot less than 1/4 in (I think...) but it still came out okay. I love ranch and potatoes and this combines them well. As others have stated, only use 1/3 the listed amount of butter. It's already pretty oily and added butter doesn't do anything except put more fat on your belly.

This was pretty yummy!  I did half the butter and also added in some chopped onion and used red potatoes.  I really liked the chili powder flavor in this.  For us, we may of liked it better if it was a bit creamier.  Maybe next time instead of the bottled ranch, we may prefer a cream cheese/sour cream mixture, with ranch seasoning mix instead.  But overall it was a pretty good side dish and we did eat most of it..  Thank you for the recipe!

I gave it a three star because of the store bought ranch dressing I used.  I will make this again, but will use my own ranch dressing with bacon.  My grandkids loved it though. Which is s huge plus.

I love this dish and make it often. The only thing I change is I add a lot less butter, maybe only 2 TBSP instead of  6, because it can really swim in that butter. I probably add more chili powder than called for because I don't usually measure it out. Really flavorful and ooey-gooey cheesy. Tastes great with any meat you serve it with.

I thought this was delicious.  I think i'll cut back the amount of the dressing just a touch next time.  I had no left overs to bring to work for lunch. I'm thinking this was a hit!!  Thanks for posting & sharing!

I omitted the chili powder and salt and pepper.As someone suggested, I used Montreal Steak seasoning innstead.  Used only 2 tablespoons of butter.  I took to a party and everyone loved it..  I will make again.

The taste was good but a bit strong on the ranch for our liking, I will make again but I will back down on the ranch dressing 1/3 and maybe increase the potatoes. I also added my homemade bacon and it added a bit of a smokey flavor to it. Overall it was good.

yes. I cut the recipe in half and used ranch dressing made from a dry ranch mix, since I did not have the bottled ranch dressing on hand.

Very good. Did not have ranch dressing so used ranch mix with sour cream. Would definitely make again.

This came out amazing and addicting! The ONLY changes I made, substitute seasoning salt with the salt and cut the butter down to 2 1/2 TBSP. I will make this again and again and again! Thank you for the recipe!

I agree that 6tbs of butter is too much. 2tbs would have been fine. I used 2lbs of potatoes and 2lbs of zucchini then I made my own ranch with Greek yogurt. It was great!

This was very good!  The chili powder makes it great!  I'm not sure the ranch made much difference though.  Next time I will omit the ranch.

I had some extra potatoes and was looking for something to do with them and found this recipe. Since there are only 3 of us I cut the recipe in half. I used my  chop wizard and cut the potatoes into little cubes. The changes I made were: Instead of using the amount of butter recommended I only used 1 tbs and cut it up small and put it around the potatoes. I also used seasoning salt  (I like salt so I used a little more than recommended) instead of regular salt. I didn't have any chili powder so I used 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. I cooked them for about 40 minutes and then put only 1/3 cup ranch, 1/2 cup cheese and some chopped up bacon. I mixed it around and then added more cheese and bacon to the top and cooked if for another 10 minutes. It came out yummy.

Delicious!  I used a little less butter than the recipe calls for.  Other than that, I followed it exactly.  My family LOVES this dish and asks me to make it all the time.

Like others, I made a few changes for size and health reasons. I skipped the butter entirely. I used 1 bag O'Brien potato mix in the frozen bag and thawed it then tossed it with the chili powder. I baked that fir twenty minutes to make sure the potatoes were soft then stored in about 1/2c of the Ranch. I used Hidden Valley Chipotle since that's what we had and then tossed in cheddar. Baked in for a bit to finish. Everyone loved it.   I think, personally that it would've been better with a dry ranch mix. I'm not one to put Ranch on my potatoes anyways, but my guests loved it.

Just made this, except probably with only 2-3 pounds of russets. I did not peel them, just washed and cubed them up. Melted a stick of butter and drizzled over potatoes, and added the salt, pepper and chili powder. Covered and baked an hour. I thought I would need to drain off some of the butter but I didn't. Mixed in a cup of cucumber ranch and 2 cups Mexican blend cheese. I didn't even bake any longer because the heat from the potatoes was enough to melt the cheese. It was good enough that I didn't bother making the rest of the dinner I had planned, we just ate this! I love easy recipes :-)

This was just ok.  Not sure I'll make it again.  I divided the recipe into two dishes.  In the first dish I omitted part of the butter and made the second dish as per the recipe.  It was a lot of butter but without it the potatoes are not good.  I didn't care for the amount of chili powder either.

This was delicious! I made it recently for a pot luck birthday party and it was a big hit. I decided to follow the amendment of the creator and used seasoned salt instead of regular. I also chose to use red potatoes and add some bacon to the recipe  with some chopped scallions which made it look pretty and even more delicious. 

A must try. 

I will be making this again for sure, per my husbands request, which is quite the rarity because he's not a picky man. 

2 thumbs up.

I really WANTED to like this.. But the ranch totally ruined it. I eventually tried adding sour cream and mushroom soup (suggested by another cook at our dinner) to try to save this dish and nothing worked.  I won't be making it again.

I made this for the first time today and took it to a Christmas dinner .... it was a hit!  This is simple and delicious; I made a few changes: cut the butter to 4 Tbsp., used about 3/4 cup Litehouse Ranch dressing , 1 tsp. seasoned salt (instead of regular salt)and sharp cheddar cheese.  The 2 tsp. of chili powder was just right for me.  This is one of those recipes that can be made several different ways, each delicious!  Great for family or to take to a gathering.

Loved this recipe! Served this as a side for a cookout with burgers and it was a hit! The only change I made that would keep me from rating it 5 stars was that based on the reviews, I decreased the amount of butter to half the amount (3 TBSP) and that was plenty. I also used red potatoes and just left the skins on and that made it even more simple and was just fine. Thanks so much, this is the perfect side for burgers.

This is my new favourite comfort food. I made it yesterday just to have a bowl full of it. I never like leftover potatoes but this is actually better the next day! I topped it off with green onions, which makes it even more perfect! Very affordable with very few ingredients. Love it!

I mixed this up before reading reviews. I didnt measure anything really so that play into this but I didnt find it super greasy, Sure it had a little in the bottom of the pan but not too terrible. I may try mixing it with olive oil and the seasonings next time though. I added some diced ham to mine and think its pretty tasty. I will definitely make this again!

Not terrible but I won't make it again. I used 2 TBS of butter like others suggested. I also added pokska kielbasa and bacon. The best part was the kielbasa and bacon. There was entirely too much ranch, I didn't use as much as the recipe called for either. More spices would have been better.

This was so delicious!  I made it for our Mother's Day dinner today and it was a HIT! The only thing I would change is the amount of butter. I would cut it down to half the called for amount.   When it came out of the oven after the ranch and cheese was added you could see the butter bubbling on the sides of the dish (or maybe it was the grease from the cheese). I also mixed in onion powder and a few extra sprinkles of chili powder on top before I baked it. I'm going to add real bacon bits next time.

Very good.  Did not give it five stars, because I thought it needed a little more seasoning.  I added a little garlic salt and that did the trick. Followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut the butter in half.

I made this and used some of the suggestions. We like butter in my house so I used 4 huge tablespoons of butter plus added lots of extra salt. Came out perfect! Thank you so much for this recipe! Also, you can save the potato skins you removed from the red potatoes and fry them. To make potato chips!

I made this for a potluck at school and it was gone in a minute. Everyone loved it and couldn't stop complimenting me. I followed suggestions from others and cut the butter in half and all I had was sharp cheddar but that turned out just fine. I also added some dried minced onions to the top with the cheese. I think it could afford to be a little lighter on the ranch but that depends on your preferences. Could add chives or green onions and maybe even bacon depending on the day.

I diced the potatoes very fine, added 3/4 an onion and an egg, reduced the butter and mixed it all together at the same time and baked it for 25 min in a mini muffin pan. Very greasy but they were all eaten at a potluck dinner.

I used frozen shredded potatoes ILO of cubing the potatoes.  I was much faster and tastes just the same.  I cut the butter in half and it was still a little much.  I use 2 tablespoons of butter and it turns out great.  This is my daughter's favorite recipe!

Best comfort food ... EVER!  But, I agree that the butter could be cut quite a bit without sacrificing yumminess.   Used chili powder and 'kickin' chicken' seasoning.  Also, I added some ham in with the ranch and cheese and called it a complete meal with some steamed broccoli.  With all that ham, probably could have completely omitted the salt.

I recently made this for a Thanksgiving dinner at my church. I doubled the recipe, but still made it exactly as it said.  They turned out delicious! I did mix bacon in at the very end. Overall, they were pretty quick, easy to make, and everyone loved them!! I will definitely make them again!!

Yummy!  This recipe has been hanging out in my recipe box since April 2012.  I should have made this one sooner, my guys LOVED it!  I prepped the potatoes in the morning and just put them in a bowl covered with water to cut down the prep work at dinner time.  This worked perfectly, and I will be doing that again when I‚Äôm pressed for time.  I rinsed them really well and then added fresh water and put a lid on the bowl.  The potatoes did not change color when I was ready to use them.  I just drained them well and proceeded with the recipe.  We liked the little ‚Äòzing‚Äô that the chili powder added to the recipe.  The next time I think I will add just a tad more.  These were served with 'Shredded French Dip' and ‚ÄòSlow Cooker Creamed Corn‚Äô from AR and we enjoyed a wonderful dinner.

I cut the butter back to half the amount like others suggested. I did  everything else as instructed.  After roasting the covered potatoes, there was about a cup of liquid at the bottom, which i drained.  i then added the dressing and cheese.  and continued baking uncovered.  It never really dried out.  it was not good.

I made this for our potluck at church. By the time I got to it in line, it was 90% gone. Everybody loved it. I cooked the potatoes in a pan of water for 20 minutes first. Then I followed the steps and cooked it in the oven (with only 2 tbsp of butter for another 20 minutes. I didn't have any bottled ranch dressing so I made my own with the package of ranch with mayo and milk.

I took this dish to a carry in and everyone loved it.  I did change it slightly...I didn't have the right kind of cheese, so I used sharp cheddar and I added real bacon bits.  Yummy!  I would cut back on the butter next time, it was a little too greasy for me.

This was OK but nothing special.  Even omitting most of the butter it still seemed too "greasy" to me.  Probably won't make it again because there are other recipes that we like better.

This recipe was proclaimed the best potatoes I have ever made!!  I cut back on the butter a bit and they were amazing.  I also used half shredded cheddar and half shredded smoked swiss cheese along with adding bacon.  The slight smokiness from the swiss made this a real keeper along with the bacon of course!

These are good, but no one was raving over them.  Easy dish to make, which is always nice.  I used red potatoes (3 lbs, so I cut back slightly on the cheese/dressing).  I used about 2 T butter, definitely no need for more.  Another reviewer said they precooked in oven and then put in crock pot with dressing/cheese.  That would be a good idea for a make ahead dish that also alleviates oven space.

I heavily buttered my dish, then melted about 1 tbsp butter and mixed in the seasoning. It made a paste that I stirred into the potatoes.  I used fat free cheddar (what I had at home) and fat free ranch.  Hubs and I liked it, kids weren't thrilled, but they're kids.  The chili powder definitely gave it a different taste, and I think would go best with a grilled meal, as stated above.

If you make these in the crockpot, which I would like to since I have limited oven space, how long did you cook them and I assuming you did it on low.
Please advise!!

I was asked at a party to make a vegetarian dish. I did a google search and saw this one. It was so easy to make and was a massive popular at the party, everyone wanted the recipe. Very good!

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written,except for baking time, and it was delicious! I baked the potatoes in the morning for an hour, then put them in the fridge then baked them for 20 minutes (since they were cold from the fridge) right before dinner time. They turned out perfectly tender, and they were so tasty! This is a great, simple recipe that I will definitely make again.

In the category of "actions speak louder than words" -- I made this for a post-New Year's family gathering. As everyone was standing around talking about their New Year's resolutions to lose weight, eat healthier, etc, they were gobbling this dish down.  It was so good (and loved by all), even the resolution-breakers.  Made just as written.

I used the suggestion of one of the previous reviewers and baked a 5 lb bag of potatoes for an hour and then let them cool. I then cut taters up into about 1/4: pieces and then mixed up with the spices before putting into the crock-pot with the cubed butter. In the morning, I turned on the pot to Med...as I didn't get up early enough. It was done in 2.5 hrs and ready for me to add the cheese and ranch dressing. ALL TURNED OUT PERFECT. My oldest has always been the one to make these for family functions. With working so much at the holidays, I got to take a spin. Everyone LOVED them. I also added some of Emeril's essence and all came together just great. I'll have to remember to use it for the next potluck dinner we have to go to. Doesn't take much effort to make...and that's a HUGE bonus.

If I wasn`t on Weight Watchers I coud have finished the whole pan. Though I did add garlic powder and green onions,these are a definite make again.And by the way it would have been worth the W.W. points what ever they would have been.

I really liked this recipe...with a few changes.  I was reading the previous posts about how greasy it was, so I made a few changes.  I cut the potatoes in a bowl, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil, put in the seasonings, tossed them, put them in the pan and baked for an hour. When they were done I covered them with cheese and ranch dressing, put the foil back over it and let it sit for about 15-20 minutes.  The cheese was melted, the dressing completely covered the potatoes and my family loved it.  It was very good.

I made this and agree with some others,cut the butter down by half!I also will had less salt next time as the dressing has a lot of salt in it and was a bit too salty for my taste.Overall I will make this again and it was a big hit with my hubby:)

This potatoes were great, however, I should have heeded the other reviews regarding the butter amount.  I really think you can get away with just buttering your cassarole.  I ended up pouring out lots of grease.

Really enjoyed, but then I love potatoes. Should have read a few reviews first...did not need as much butter, if any, as others have mentioned. If you use a little Pam before, should keep them from sticking, and when you add the ranch and cheese, it will keep them creamy enough to not stick. Taste is great, especially if you like Ranch and cheese, of course. Not sure if the chili powder offered anything, or maybe it wasn't enough. Next time will add further spices to perk it up more. Thanks for a keeper!

I boiled the cubed potatoes until semi-soft, drained well, then put them in the casserole dish, added all the other ingredients, mixed, and baked for 30 minutes. Easier, and soooo yummy! The ranch dressing made this fantastic.

Really great comfort food! Only change I made was to cut the amount of butter in half since several other reviewers mentioned it was greasy with the full amount called for.  I love potatoes, I love ranch, and I love cheese...so of course I knew I would love this dish. Thanks for sharing :)

Everyone loved this dish. I halved the recipe I didn't use butter but coated the potatoes in olive oil instead.  Roasted them covered for about 30mins then uncovered for another 30mins.  I then discovered that someone had been into the shredded cheese and only left me a little so I subbed about 1/2 can cheddar cheese soup.  Mixed the soup, ranch dressing and some bacon with the taters then topped with shredded cheddar, bacon and panko breading.  Popped back in the oven for a few mins then under the broiler to crisp up the top.  Soooo good!

This was a hit at our Mother Daughter Banquet last Monday!  I made one small change... I mixed all the ingredients together at the beggining for time sake (fed 158 people) and topped with pats of butter!  Rave reviews and will make it again!

We thought these were SUPER YUMMY! I eyeballed the potatoes, used 1/4 teaspoon of pepper instead of 1/2, added in a 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and used homemade ranch, so I just eyeballed it (maybe used 1 cup?). These were perfectly seasoned and we thought they had great flavor. This is a wonderful new way to prepare potatoes that I will be using again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yum! My kids rated this a 5, hubby rated it a 3. I didn't have bacon on hand so after taking it out of the oven, sprinkled some baco's on top. Hubby suggested put a dab of sour cream on top when eatting and that moves it to a 4 and puts the finishing touches on it. Thanks for a good recipe!

Simple and fast - it had a great flavor!  I will probably cut the butter down a bit more - it seemed a little too greasy to me - but overall we loved it!

I can't believe I forgot to review this, considering I am addicted to this and make it as often as possible. I leave out the chili and add 1 medium chopped onion. This has become my absolute favorite potato dish.  I could eat it every day if someone would peel and chop my potatoes for me. Luckily my picky husband loves it too, so he's easy to convince to do that job when it's a cheesy ranch potato night. :D

SOOOO good. Couldn't believe how tasty these were. I did not use butter - all you need to do is spray the dish you use to cook them in instead. I also added some minced garlic. Will definitely make these again.

My family always loves this type of potatoes. I did add a bit more ranch and  cheese and I also added bacon and green onions on top and throughout. Brought it with me to family gathering and was devoured!

Good potatoes.  We followed the recommendation to cook it in the slow cooker as our oven had a turkey in it.  We also added some bacon and onions to it as well.  It did not have an overly strong ranch flavour to it.  We also only added a small amount of butter to the cooking potatoes as many people recommended decreasing the amount of butter.

I agree with others that the butter could be left out.  I left the peeling on the potatoes and baked in the microwave then added ranch,seasoning,cheese and baked for 25-30 minutes.  This made for a quick and easy side dish.

It was pretty good. We love Ranch dressing but we felt there was too much of it. We added an extra 16 oz. of cheese on top to help compensate for that. (88)

Used whatever potatoes I had at the time. As well, I only had a small amount of Creamy Ranch so I added it to Creamy Italian and Creamy Ceasar. Very, very tasty!!!

This was really good!  I scaled it back to 4 servings and kind of estimated most of the amounts as I went.  I also added green onions at the time of adding the cheese and ranch, and this was a nice touch.  Note that the potatoes were plenty soft after about 30 minutes of cooking, so folks making a smaller quantity should keep this in mind.  5 stars, great recipe!!

I just made this for a family gathering last night.  The whole pan was completely devoured.  I also cut the butter to 3 TBSP and I added about 1-2 TBSP of hot sauce to the ranch dressing.  It did not make the dish spicy hot, but it gave it an extra kick.  I also had the idea of trying blue cheese dressing with this instead of ranch--kind of like buffalo style potatoes. May try that next time.  This dish is now a favorite!

Awesome. I mashed the potatoes leaving some big chunks and skipped the butter on top. I also didn't use all of the cheese or dressing called for in the recipe- just added them to taste. I used more like 1/2 a bottle of ranch.

I cut the recipe in half.  Boiled potatoes instead of baking them (much faster)  The potatoes kind of mashed up when stirring the butter, ranch, and cheese in so all the grease wasn't just lying in the bottom.  I did add some onion too, maybe next time will add bacon bits.

This was delicious!!  I loved this recipe.  The ranch definitely gave it something extra.  I love it.  I had to make a separate recipe for my husband because he doesn't like Ranch.  But, everyone else loved it as well.

I have made this at least 10 times now.  It is delicious.  I did find it easier to par-boil the potatoes or even boil them all the way and them throw them in the oven with the rest of the ingredients.  Thanks for sharing!

We turned this into an entr√©e by adding ground beef. First we cut the recipe in half; then, while the potatoes were baking, we browned one pound of ground beef with a little onion and some grilling seasoning. We added the browned beef with the cheese and ranch in the last step. Next time, I think we'll try a little Colby jack instead of Monterrey.

This recipe is a keeper - I have made this several times and everyone always loves it! It's great as-is but I typically add: -Garlic (sauteed in butter and drizzled over the potatoes prior to baking - replacment for the butter cubes as per recipe) -Spices: Ms. Dash Garlic & Herb seasoning, Onion Powder, Adobo (green top)

Wonderful!  Very easy to make and delish!  The kitchen smelled wonderful and I could barely wait to dig in!  I didn't use any butter in this recipe, just spray and it turned out fine.  The ranch dressing gave such a bold flavor that I didn't add the bacon that I cooked to add in - it really didn't need it. I will definitely make this again. Maybe next time to save a little time I will make this with tater tots instead of fresh potatoes.  Either way it was yummy!  I will be making this part of my normal rotation to spice up my side dishes -thanks!

These were very good!  Followed the recipe exact.  I was in a hurry, so I turned the oven up to 425 for the first 25 minutes, then turned it back done and I think they only had to bake for about 40 minutes total before they were tender and I could add the cheese and ranch.  Delish, and everyone at our potluck loved them!

Love it!  Like other reviewers, I reduced the butter.  I've prepared this dish several times, maybe adding minced parsley, green onions, or sour cream for part of the dressing.  It never fails to draw compliments and an empty dish.  Thank you for sharing an easy and tasty recipe.

This was okay, but I didn't love it.  If it were healthier, I'd probably make it again, but with all the ranch dressing and cheese, I doubt I'm going to give this another try.  It would probably be better with bacon as other reviewers have suggested.

I made this dish for mother's day this year and the whole family raved about it.  My mother claimed she liked it even better than her famous scalloped potatoes.  I made a couple of alterations to the dish.  I only added about 2.5 tablespoons of butter and they were still tender but also slighly crispy on the outside.  I also cut the chili powder down to 1 teaspoon, and added some paprika and garlic salt.

The chili powder in this dish is a strange addition (in my opinion).  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because my boyfriend liked it, and even he said the chili powder gave it "a Tex-Mex feel", and that's not what I expect from a cheesy ranch recipe.  This one has been REMOVED from my Recipe Box.

Very tasty! I wish I'd used even more chili powder. I subbed dry ranch mix for the salt, to add even more tasty ranch flavor. Out of respect for my arteries, I used olive oil in place of the butter, and much less of it. We'll make this again!

I cut this recipe in half and reduced the butter, used seasoned salt instead of regular salt and added at least a TBSP of minced garlic.  It was very good!

As other commenters noted, a bit too much butter in the original recipe. Next time I'll make with probably half of the butter called for. Otherwise, delicious! This will probably become a common side dish for my meals.

W.O.W. This was delicious and so easy. Based on other reviews, I cut the butter down to 2 tbs, which was perfect. Next time I'll add some bacon and it will taste just like cheese fries! I think you could make this in advance by cooking the potatoes, letting them cool and refrigerate. The next day, mix in the ranch/cheese, and reheat in the oven. This will be my new go to BBQ side dish. Delicious!

Well, I hate to write a negative review, but we weren't crazy about this one at all.  After reading the other reviews, I was determined that mine wouldn't turn out greasy and it didn't.  I didn't use any butter, I cut the cheese in half, but did use the full amount of ranch dressing.  One big objection for me was the color of this dish - a very blah beige.  I don't know how this picture looks so beautiful because mine sure wasn't.  Taste was sort of blah as well - no pizzaz.  Sorry, but we won't be making this one again.

Only made half a recipe and wish I would have made more. My whole family had seconds and some even thirds. We used three cheese ranch dressing since it was what I had in the house. The only thing I will change is I made them in a 9 X 13 pan and since I only made half some got a bit mushy, will make in an 8 inch square if only making half.

This is very tasty and easy to make, but I agree with the other posters who said to skip the butter-this does not need any butter in it. I made this in the microwave-I scaled down the recipe to 4 servings, then using 1.25 lbs of potatoes I cooked for 8 minutes, then added the dressing & cheese and baked in the regular oven for about 10 minutes. I did not peel the potatoes, and used low-fat Mexican shredded cheese & low fat Ranch dressing becuase we want to stay skinny. My husband said it was "great" Will make again!

These were good.  I added bacon and sauted onions.  I think next time I will cut the potatoes smaller and use more ranch and cheese.

Served this last night for fiance's birthday and really loved it.  I cut the butter to about 1 1/2 T and sauteed some chives and shallot with the seasonings before adding to potatoes.  I used a new variety (at least new to me) of potato called butter reds and did not remove the skin.  The flavor was great and even though I thought I would have enough left over to have with another meal, there is very little left over.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was awesome! I added bacon bits after pulling out of the oven -- and would also suggest adding chives or green onions -- but the kids a finicky... I really didn't measure a thing which made it super easy. I figured family of four - use four potatoes. Used the recommended amount of cheese and just covered the potatoes with ranch dressing and mixed it all up. Turned out great!

There were REALLY good!! I like a few other people made some changes. I only used 2tb of butter. Melted it and mixed it with the spices and then mixed with the potatoes. I used cheddar and swiss cheese because that is what I had on had. And I made my own ranch dressing. I will be making these again....SO GOOD!!

Everyone loved this dish.  I only gave it 4 stars because I modified it.  I used 1 Tbs. butter that I melted and tossed with the potatoes before baking- it was plenty!  I used mozzarella and sharp cheddar and only about 1/3 of the bottle of ranch.  Just enough to make it moist, but I didn't want to overpower the dish.  This dish is a keeper, and very easy.

This dish was impossibly easy and very tasty. I used light ranch dressing and added in a chopped cooking onion for flavor. THe light ranch was so good, and you can't even tell the difference! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I added a package of maple bacon, and sauteed the potatoes in the bacon fat after seasoning and before putting in the oven.  I also used ranch dip, not dressing, added the bacon and the cheese and cooked the final 10 min.  OMG!!

This was a hit at my house.  I didn't use all the ranch dressing that it called for just because my family is not a fan.  I did toss with olive oil and next time I will use more chili powder.  Great recipe!

I was actually looking for a copycat recipe for Stouffer's bacon cheddar potatoes that you can buy in the grocery store.  After adding crumbled bacon, I finally found it!  Based on other reviews, I omitted the butter completely.  I figured the ranch, cheese and bacon was all the grease I needed.  I also just eyeballed the amount of ranch to cover the potatoes generously.  This is the type of recipe that you could easily just eyeball all the ingredients and make it on the fly.  I will definitely store this one in my brain.  LOL.

It was pretty good, reduced the butter to 3tbs as suggested, and agreed it was still too much. I guess I fantasized that the butter would be absorbed, as I put in on top of the potatoes before I put them in the oven, but actually it all went to the bottom. I used the species as directed but sprinkled everything once over with seasoning salt, too. Also, I put the ranch dressing on before I put it in the oven, and that was absorbed. I will def make this again!

I used Yukon gold potatoes for a sweeter flavor.  I also used a combination of 1 tsp chipotle chili powder and 1 tsp smoked paprika for a kick.  In place of butter I used olive oil for a healthier heart version.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Yum! Hubby and I ate them up.  I did not add the chili powder (could not find it)..and they were still great.   Also baked them in a toaster oven and they came out just fine.  Plan on making these again.

I made this extremely easy recipe exactly as posted with my home made  my own skim milk/ff mayo ranch dressing) .  I made 1/2 recipe and the longest step was cubing the potatoes so small, but the results were well with this minor effort.  I  tried this the first time on company and received high praise from even the most reserved guests, including my husband!  Needless to say a keeper and can't wait until my kids come for a visit to make it again.

Great side dish and welcomed change from oven fries. Ajusted the serving size for four and eyeballed ingredients. I did not use the butter, just sprayed the potatoes with cooking spray. Dish turned out perfect. Will make again.

Absolutely delicious! This was a huge hit with our family of 8. I added 2 cups of cooked green beans and 3 slices of cooked crumbled bacon at the end with the cheese and ranch. I used the Ranch Dressing II recipe in this as well as Pepper Jack cheese.

YUMMY! I did cut back on the amount of butter by 2T and I accidentally forgot to cover with foil (oops) the first time. But to my surprise they actually turned out very good. We even ate them for breakfast and everyone raved about them. I have also made with sharp cheddar but think the colby-monterey Jack is much better! Will make again as written many more times (with the exception of cutting back a tad on the butter)

Very good recipe. Fantastic flavor!    I goofed by adding potatoes with ranch/cheese prior to baking which made it soupy when the potatoes were done.   It helps to really read the recipe  :)    Anyway, added panko bread crumbs with some addition cheese on top to absorb some liquid.  WOW !!  No leftovers.

AMAZING!  I made these to go along with chicken and my husband LOVED it.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I cut the butter to 3 Tbsp.  Next time I will probably even make it without the butter, since the cheese generates enough grease on its own.  I also added seasoning salt before baking the potatoes.  They were delicious!

Okay, not sure if it's the Ranch dressing or the cheese, but this is greasy greasy greasy!  I left out the butter completely, so I know it's not that.  After baking, I mixed up the potatoes and moved them to the side because it looked greasy . . .unfortunately, there was a LOT of grease left over.  They tasted good, but maybe I'll try with just the ranch seasoning next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and very simple. I only used 2 Tbl of butter and it was perfect. I also sauteed some onions in the butter and mixed the spices in the butter to make it easier to mix with the potatoes.

Very tasty recipe.  I reduced the butter to 2 tbl and this was still way too much, so I would definitely omit it all together.  I also added real bacon bits.  Would be great with sour cream or zesty ranch! Thanks!

This was a super side dish and the leftovers were great to take for lunch at work!  Really simple to make, just a bit time-consuming.  I used only 2 tablespoons of butter and melted it per previous reviewer's advice, plus I reduced the chili powder to only about 1 teaspoon.  So good!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

The only thing I did differently was to use less ranch because we didn't want it swimming in it. I stirred after adding the ranch (probably half the amount called for) and added the cheese and then added a "squirt" of ranch allover the top. Yummy dish! Definite "comfort food"! Thanks for sharing!!

This was excellent. I made it for a group of friends and everyone loved it! One guy even said "Best thing ever created in the history of food!" While I think that may be a stretch this dish is really great! After reading other reviews I decided to cut down on the amount of butter. I used 2.5 tablespoons instead of 6 and it was great! I agree that 6 probably would have been too much. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Yum, yum, yum!  Made exactly as written except I didn't mix the cheese in, just put it on top. I also used sharp cheddar.  Seriously good potatoes!

Delicious! As per the other reviewers - I omitted the butter. I just tossed the chopped potatoes with a bit of olive oil and the seasonings it calls for. Thanks for this easy, yummy side dish!

Very good! Will make time and time again.  Cooked potatoes in microwave instead of oven, was much quicker that way.

These were really good, kind of reminded me of a chili-cheese-fry casserole : ) Per other reviewers I left out the butter and just tossed the potatoes in a little olive oil. I used four medium potatoes, 2 tsps chili powder, 1 tsp salt and a few shakes of pepper. I didn't measure the cheese or ranch dressing, just kind of eye-balled it. These were fabulous. The cheese does make them kind of greasy, but they never said this was a diet recipe : )Good stuff, nice change of pace and easy to make. Thanks for the recipe!

This was ok, but likely won't make again -- I just couldn't get past the butter and entire bottle of dressing.  It was overpowering.  But a nice try though.

I didn't add any butter after reading other reviews of it being fine without it.  I just greased the pan with a thin layer of butter then coated the potato's in a little olive oil.  Everyone liked them.  I could't even taste the ranch on them though?  Could be because I had to let them sit covered for about 30 minutes waiting for the BBQ to be done.  The ranch got soaked into the potato's I guess.  Only the flavor should have still been there.  Next time I might try a packet of ranch seasoning.  I also added crumbled bacon and green onion on the side.  If I use the ranch seasoning pack next time, I think I will also have some sour cream on the side.

Boy was this a hit!!!  The first time I made it, I made it as written.  It was good but very greasy.  The next time, I just tossed the potatoes lightly in oil.  They were still a bit greasy because of the cheese, but much better.  My husband (who is hard to please) instantly requested that I make them again.  Score!

This was a huge hit at our party, even the guys couldn't say enough good things about these potatoes.  I noticed previous reveiws mentioned that it didn't need all the butter, so I only used 3 Tbs.  After adding the cheese and dressing, it was still a little too rich for my taste.  I might do without any butter next time.  However, the chili powder & Ranch dressing give it a really good flavor.

DELISH! I took the "quick and easy" route and used Del Monte canned new potatoes instead of fresh russett.  I was really just looking for a quick and easy recipe to use up canned veggies in the pantry, but this one's gonna be a keeper. Fresh is definitely best, so I'll have to give the russett a try next time. I sliced the potatoes about 1/4" thick, used a bit more ranch and cheese, half the chili and about third the amount of butter.

i boiled the potatos until they were tender, mixed the ingredients together, then i coated the bottom of my baking dish with butter before putting the potatos in (i used less than a tablespoon, and didnt think it was neccessary to add any butter to the potatos since i didnt bake them until tender) & then i broiled them until they were golden brown on top. my husband and i both enjoyed this, i even went back for seconds which is rare since im 7 months pregnant and cant eat much!

These are the best potatoes.  We made these a couple of weeks ago and did not have any left.  My family absolutely loved them.  We all agreed that we could just skip the main course and eat the yummy potatoes for dinner.  Made per the recipe.

A great potato dish for company - very different and simple. I measured the spices, but not much else - used two peeled baking potatoes and about 6 unpeeled red potatoes; about 4 T butter, melted with spices stirred in - stirred potatoes in a large bowl w/butter/spice mix to coat, then baked. When time for ranch/cheese came, I simply drizzled some (not all the amt called for) ranch over the potatoes then added the cheese, along with scallions and real bacon pieces. Went great with Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches from this site, and hubby RAVED!

I made this recipe without the butter, but the dressing separated and there was a lot of oil in the bottom.  Personally I thought it was a 2 star, but most everyone else liked it pretty well so I'm giving it a 3.

I think the roasted potatoes BEFORE all the ranch and cheese were better than after... my bf doesn't like potato salad so I was hoping for a substitution, but we weren't into this one.

One of the best potato dishes I've had.  I used 2 T. of melted butter and mixed in the chili powder, pepper and seasoned salt, then poured it over the potatoes and baked it. This dish turned out perfect!

I went a little less on the spices when I made this on the 4th of July and everyone loved it.  Personally, I'd like it better with a little less skin on the potatoes.  Very good!

Very good.  My husband and I both enjoyed these potatoes.  This is a recipe that can easily be adjusted to suit individual tastes.  I am looking forward to frying the leftovers tonight.  I think the cheesy goodness will be almost as good as the original dish.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Good and quick. I used half the butter per reviews and used powdered ranch mix, next time i will use the liquid because the ranch flavor wasn't noticeable but still very good.

good recipe to change things up.  stirred the potatoes a couple times while cooking.  i halved the recipe so only used 2 tbsp. of butter - 3 tbsp. would've been fine cos potatoes started sticking to the pan at the end of cooking time - not sure if there's any way to really avoid this - just have to catch it before it happens i guess.  will make again!  thanks!!

Good recipe-everyone in the family likes it.  However, I only use enough cheese and ranch dressing to make the dish just moist, and decrease the calories!

This was quite good!  I did not add the butter, and used light ranch and 2% milk cheese.  I will definitely make this again!

This was a pretty good recipe. I had to scale my recipe way down. I cubed 5-6 red potatoes, they easily cooked in 1 hour. I had to leave, then an hour later came back, threw in some ranch (not too much, maybe 1/4 cup at most) grated cheddar cheese over it, and tossed in some bacon bits. In the oven for about 10-15 mins and it was ready to go. I really liked it, my hubby thought it was "okay" but I thought the taste was quite good. I would gladly take this to a potluck or serve it to others. I served this with the Slow Cooker Barbecue Ribs from this site.

These were to die for! I actually only added 3 lbs of potatoes rather than 4 and added the same amount of everything else. I think these are my new favorite side!

awesome recipe! I come from a family of 12 kids of all ages and they all loved. it. Like many others I reduced the amount of butter, and I put in more cheese as well as some cooked onions for some added flavor. great recipe, definetly should be tried.

yummmmm!!!

We made these tonight with our soy/ginger grilled pork chops, peas and beer bread!!!  Fantastic meal!!!!!

There is just two of us, so I made half and we have plenty of left overs for tomorrow!!

It was a bit salty for me, but then I used salted butter and (real)bacon bits, which along with ranch dressing tastes salty to me...so next time I won't add any salt to the potatoes.

I had garlic ranch dressing and I added some garlic to the potatoes...next time I will add some pepper flakes too.

I used 3T butter and it wasn't too greasy, but could will reduce a little next time.

We loved it!!  Will make it again and again...so easy and so much flavor!!!

Thanks!!!!!

I would give these potatoes 5 stars but they don't need the butter! Just some cooking spray to prevent sticking works fine. The flavor of the ranch and cheese is fabulous. This side dish will be made often in my house.

This recipe was very good. The only problem that I noticed was that it seemed to be a little greasy. I will use less butter next time. I did add some real bacon pieces also. My family loved these. I will definitly make these again.

Well, I even tried a few of the modifications that other suggested. Less butter, adding bacon pieces and I added diced onion. It came out, well, just ok. 
I really really wanted to like it, but even with the modifications it was still way too greasy! some of the greasy came from the 2 Tsp. of butter used, but most of it came from the cheese. I seperated a serving for my dh before I added the ranch and cheese, and I liked his potatoes much more. Oh and I used red potatoes but that makes little difference. I'm going to try and tweak these a bit more and try again.

This recipe is really good and can be modified to anyone's taste. Measuring things is strictly optional. Bacon ranch dressing works really well and add some bacon bits too.

This is a keeper!  I used a cheddar/monteray cheese mix and only 4 T. of butter.  If you really want to add some taste and calories throw in some crumbled bacon on top. Update: Even better with red potatoes!

It was ok. I think cottage cheese would have been less oily. Next time I make this I am going to mix powdered ranch into some cottage cheese and add that to the potatoes, along with some onions. Way too oily, and I didn't add butter, used pam.

Awesome, awesome, awesome- best ranch potatoes I've ever made! (and I've tried a lot)  I followed some member reviews and pick and chose what I liked.  I would recommend tossing in a couple of TBS of EVOO and drizzling half the butter.  I also added garlic powder.  Absolutely delicious!

OK - easy and inexpensive for a pot luck.
Nothing spectacular, could add crumbled bacon and it would probably make it much better.

Served this for a BBQ and everyone loved it.  I used red potatoes and left the skin on.  Completely omitted the butter, and didn't miss it at all.  Will defintely be making again.

Only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I think it called for more butter than necessary - a bit greasy - however, this was sinfully good and if you make a slight butter adjustment this are definately a 5.

OMG! I made this tonight and it was sooooooo good! A definite crowd pleaser and kid friendly. I also used seasoned salt, and a Monterey Jack/cheddar mixture-all that I had on hand.

I made this for a potluck and everyone was asking me for the recipe.  I only use 1 tbspn of butter, I add a bit of garlic powder and I add bacon bits to the top right before serving for a bit of a crunch.  Other than that I follow what the recipe asks for and its a bit hit!!

This recipe was great. I made a few additions but the basic concept is good. While the potatoes were in the oven, I cooked some bacon and then fried some onions in the bacon grease. I mixed the dressing and cheese into the potatoes and then topped it with the crumbled bacon and fried onions. I also added some diced jalapenos(jar) to the top because we're a spicy family. It was great.

Very tasty. I used only 2 tbsp of melted butter, which was plenty. I also added crumbled bacon when I mixed in the ranch & cheese. I will definetly be making this again. I think next time I won't add so much chili powder.

I halved this recipe for my family of five (no leftovers.) Two large potatoes worked fine in a 9x11 pyrex dish. I used seasoned salt instead of plain, cut the butter down to 2 T., and added crumbled bacon with the Ranch & cheese.

I love this recipe.I pretty much did everything the same except I put the potatoes in the microwave for 3 minutes just to cook them a little.I also used seasone salt instead of plain,like others.I added 1 tsp.garlic.Then I mixed cheddar and colby-monterrey jack cheese and bacon bits together and put that over the ranched potatoes.It was awesome,some friends came over and wanted to try them and loved them so much they added it to their recipe box.

This was amazing - so delicious and easy!  I don't like spicy food so I was concerned about the chili powder.  I followed the recipe to a T anyway and it was just right for me!  I will definitely be making this again - a lot!

I loved this recipe. It gave a great twist on roasted potatoes. What I did different. In a freezer bag I put the Chili powder, Season salt ( did this as others suggested), Pepper and didn't have much butter, so I used 1 tablespoon of Vegetable oil then shook the bag to coat the potatoes. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Thank you for this recipe I will be using this one again.

This recipe had good flavor. But way too greasy for me, and I used even less butter than the recipe called for.  I will make it again. But next time I won't use any butter at all. I will also  use a cheese that melts better like velveeta or maybe even cheese whiz.

The combination of ingredients is somewhat of a turn-off, but there were so many good reviews I just HAD to try the recipe.  I used red potatoes.  Took a reviewer's advice and used only 1/2 the butter.  Imitation bacon bits on an individual serving proved to be a deliciously crunchy addition.  Still, there's just too much fat in this recipe.  Next time I will use Hidden Valley Fat Free ranch dressing (yum) and low fat cheddar cheese.  The low fat cheese does not melt like full fat cheese, so I am not sure how it would change the texture of this recipe. Since it is mixed in and not sprinkled on top, it should be fine.  I'll just have to wait and see.  I will also use low fat margarine instead of butter.  I had previously thought the ranch would make this too runny but proved quite the opposite.  It actually could've used more.  Maybe about 4 oz or so- either that or use 4 oz sour cream in addition to the ranch.  I also used a whole packet of fresh chives.  It was a bit much.   Onions and garlic would have probably been better (cooked with the potatoes).  A sprinkle of chives over the finished product would be good.

Chipotle cheddar/pepper jack would be interesting substitutions for the regular cheddar/jack.   A mix of cheddar and cream cheese might be interesting, as well.  

Very tasty!

This was different.  Excellent flavor.  I halved the recipe and used only 1 TBS of butter cut up.  I added seasoned salt and the bacon seasoning from Tastefully Simple.  Served with baked ham.

My Hubby is a Ranch fanatic. He puts on just about everything, the same with cheese. He gives it four stars because it wasn't ranchy enough. I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt and cut back to 3 tablespoons of butter. I liked it but because to the calories and fat, i will only used it for special occasions. 
Thanks

I have mixed feelings about this one. As another person said, 6T of butter is waaaay too much. I put in 3T melted, and it was too greasy for my liking. I used red potatoes, skin on, as another person suggested. The dish wasn't exactly delicious. It was just okay. I don't really think it is tasty enough to warrant all the fat calories. I might try making it again sans butter.

I made a few changes to this recipe merely out of laziness (at least I am honest!). I boiled red potatoes, omitted the butter entirely, and added chives and bacon. I also used the shredded mexican blend of cheese, and baked for 10 minutes. I found it was still greasy, of course it's likely the cheese that causes this, but it certainly didn't keep me or my family from enjoying it. In fact, the second time I made this it was because my husband asked if we had the ingredients to make it. It's a keeper in this house!

This was FABULOUS.  My family, even our picky daughter loved this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to only use a few pats of butter and then at the end added some bacon bits.  I will definitely make this again soon.
Thanks for the recipe.

Instead of baking the potatoes, I boiled them,then added the rest of the ingredients and baked for about 20 minutes. My family loved them.  Next time I will add extra chili powder, and at husbands suggestion, some chopped onion or scallions.  Definitely a hit.  Thanks for a good recipe.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I probably could have added more ranch/sour cream so it wasnt as dry but it really turned out great. I dont like how fattening the tater tots are so I may make again with different kind of potatoes.

This recipe sounded good, but no one in my family of 4 liked it.  The only thing I changed was not adding the butter, but I don't think that addition would've improved the flavor at all.  I would've rather eaten a plain baked potato.  My husband, who usually likes everything, didn't like this very much.

We love this as a different way to enjoy potatoes. Even my friend who doesn't like ranch thinks these taste good. I usually add more ranch than called for.

Pretty good recipe...it was a good change & a good side dish. My kids ate it well & there were no complaints...I also added less butter, and I used frozen potatoes which worked well! Thanks!

I thought these were very good, and so did my 5 year old. My man and my 2 year old didn't care for them. But they are very tasty, it just wasn't something they like, but I will definitely make them again when it's just the two of us!

Made this for a church pot-luck today.....I, my husband, and my 2 year old all thought this was excellent (I peeled the potatoes and followed the directions exactly).  I didn't hear any comments, but judging from the empty dish....everyone else must have liked it, too!

No offense, I may have done something wrong, however, at the suggestion of another reviewer, I tried these as they were "better than the creamy au gratin potatoes (which I found hard to believe). My daughter and I found these to be not only unattractive but a extremely mushy and just not to our liking.  But, that's just us.

These were good.  I left the skins on my potatoes and wished that I'd peeled them.  The potatoes were tender after only 45 minutes....too done really, and I was worried that I'd cut the chunks too big.  I only used 4 tablespoons of butter and it was still greasy.  Good flavor though and such an easy recipe. We all enjoyed them.  I think that if I cut the butter down further, peel my potatoes and cut the baking time down more, this is a dish that I would use for company or potlucks.  Thanks for the recipe.

Not as good as it sounded.  Took to a potluck dinner, and NO ONE even finished their first serving.  Came home with 1/2 pan left over.

This was very good.  It was very ugly to look at, but as long as you're not serving to Martha Stewart, it's fine.  Yummy, and will make again!

Creamy and tasty. Nice change from regular roasted potatoes. The only change is the toppings but nice flavor. This will be a family favorite.

Made for a family dinner and everyone raved about them! This might replace the standard "cheesy potato" recipe....

This tasted good, it was just greasy because of the cheese. I think I will make it with a different cheese next time.

We weren't that crazy about this recipe. We actually tossed the pan of potatoes. Oh well.

This recipe was quick and easy to prepare but it was just OK. Maybe I'm just not a chili powder person because I didn't like the flavor it gave to them. Although I did add ranch that already had bacon pieces in it and that gave it a really good flavor and I doubled the cheese because we love cheese!
