I have to admit that I followed the recipe loosely - scaling this down to 4 servings - eyeballing the carrots & onions, using 1 can of coconut milk (I hate to have a partial can left over that I know I'll never use up) and 2 cups of chicken broth (made with a bouillon cube & 2 cups water). I needed something that could cook itself in the slow cooker, as I spent the afternoon at my daughter's swim meet. This was very tasty, and everyone liked it. The only thing we will do next time is add a little "kick" with some cayenne, curry paste or red pepper flakes. Super easy and tasty recipe!

Pretty good for a slow cooker recipe! I used an Indian spice mix I had instead of the curry powder. I agree that the sauce was a bit thin- maybe some potatoes would thicken it up next time?

anything in a slow cooker is delicious, but this one needs more flavor.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. It was pretty bland and needed a lot more salt (and other seasoning). It was more broth-y than I expected as well. I just put in chicken breasts without browning them first and then shredded them before I served it. I also added some baby zucchini to get some more veggies in it.

I found the same as others - there was a lot of broth, closer to a chunky soup despite adding less broth, and it needed more flavour. I sauted the chicken with a few chili flakes but I would definitely use more next time. It is a good basic recipe.

Its had a weird taste to it, I think it might have been the coconut milk.
