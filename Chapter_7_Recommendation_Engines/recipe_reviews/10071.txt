i've been using this recipe for the last 4 years and will continue to do so as long as i keep getting requests to make them.  they are time consuming but well worth it, i promise :)  the wreaths are fragile so you really have to let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet for at least 10 minutes before moving them to a cooling rack.

These are my kids favourite Christmas Cookies.  My kids loved rolling the little balls.  A little trick I use so they don't fall apart is to flatten them a bit with the palm of your hand.  They still look nice and taste the same and they don't fall apart.  I have never had any issues with this recipe and have never added an egg to it in order to keep the dough together.  These also make really pretty spring flowers and you just need to change the colours of food colouring

I added 1 egg to the creamed butter along with 1 t. peppermint extract (instead of adding the extract after the flour).  After reading the falling apart review, I figured it needed an egg. I had to add 6 drops of each food coloring. I did leave cookies on cookie sheet for 10 min before moving to racks.  They are worth the effort - very festive.

This cookie just was not for me it does not have a lot of flavor even after I doubled the pepermint extract.  Once they were backed they fell apart and you could not even tell they were shaped like candy canes or wreaths.  Will not ever use this recipe again.

Absolute favorite Christmas cookie. Couple of tips though:
1. Use unsalted butter 
2. Get some help rolling out the balls
3. Use a bit more food coloring for richer colors
4. Press the balls together some to help keep them from falling apart

Mine didn't stick together so each piece of the wreath fell off. Tasted ok.

I love these melt in your mouth cookies. They come out very pretty in other colors too. They look like flowers. When making them as flowers I use real vanilla or almond extract. I have no problem with them coming apart. Just make sure you push them together well when forming them. I will continue making these delicious cookies.

My cookies tend to come out hard on bottom and soft on the top, so I flipped the cookies and let them cook on both sides. I live at altitude of 5000 ft and did not adjust this recipe. I did not end up doing the wreath, but did round cookies with this recipe. I doubled to peppermint (I love peppermint.) The cookies came out tasting great! Thank you!

I grew up on these cookies (hi Judy! ) and loved helping my mom make them. Yes, an extra pair of hands helps however my mother never shied away from a challenging recipe. I find them delicious, never had a major problem with them breaking and they melt in your mouth!

Since it seemed the main problem was getting the dough to stick together, I just made small cookies with a teaspoon size cookie scoop.
Drizzled cookies with powdered sugar/milk glaze then dipped in crushed mints.

These cookies did not stick together at all... even after cooling, just as another review had stated. I, too, doubled the peppermint extract amount, but they still had no flavor at all. I will not use this recipe again.

It took quite a while to make all the dough in the right colours and arrange them into the wreaths. For all the time it took, the cookies were a little weak in terms of flavour (not very sweet or very minty). I wanted to try making the dough into candy cane shapes as well but it was too dry. Some modifications to the recipe may be called for.
