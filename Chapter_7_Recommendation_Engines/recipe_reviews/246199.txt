It tastes very good however the recipe should have made mention that you need to cool the Jell-O before adding it to the set layer or it will dissolve and melt which is what happened to my Jell-O. The orange and green Jell-O then turned brown as it all mixed together. It tasted good but was not pretty like the picture. Next time I will not bother layering the orange in the middle but just add a little triple sack to the margarita Jell-O recipe and have the entire jello green. Then the Jell-O will set up in four hours instead of 12 as the original recipe calls for.

Three different steps, takes a bit of time. However, they are a hot with everyone I served them to.
