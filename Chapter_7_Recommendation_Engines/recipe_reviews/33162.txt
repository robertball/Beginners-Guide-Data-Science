The recipe is good.  However, I had to make some adjustments.  I used Fiber One and safe to say, the first time I made it, I had the same results as the raters before me.  This time I used HOT coffee (boiling hot) and soaked the fiber cereal in the coffee until it was mushy, then followed the rest of the recipe.  Good Luck!

Absolutely AWFUL!!  Very dry & tasteless.  I checked ingredients to see if I had missed something.  Everything exactly as given in recipe.  Can't even give this one star!

I didn't care for these very much.  The flavoring was good for bran muffins but mine turned out really dry.  I wonder if they would have been more moist if oil was used instead of butter.  My 1 and 3 year old kids liked them though.

These muffins were very dry and bland. They had a horrible flavor and I followed the recipe exactly. They also didn't rise. I do not recommend this recipe.

These muffins were dense, did not rise, and I would not make them again.  Needs more liquid (much more).  Disappointing.

After reading all of the low rated reviews and trying the recipw myself, I tweeked this quite a bit.  I love the idea of using coffee in the ingredients!  I would have to give this one a 2 star rating, sorry.  But it put me on the fun road of creating just what I was looking for!  I think I'll end up posting my tweeked version!  Thanks

Easy to make.  A little time consuming, yet if you are making more than muffins, this recipe definately helps with other kicthen tasks.   I used flavored coffee and it gives the muffins a small hint of flavor.

I've made this recipe a few times now and really love these muffins! I use Greek coffee, and oats instead of bran. I also add a little extra buttermilk (or plain yoghurt, depending on what I have available), vanilla essence, and dried cranberries or raisins, and whatever nuts I have. I don't leave the batter in the fridge but bake them straight away. These muffins are awesome for breakfast or an afternoon snack with a cup of  fresh coffee! Thanks for sharing :)
