Made this for my mom on Friday night. She said it had a good punch, but the fruit kept it nice and light. The flavor was very good. I did not add the raw sugar to the drink, but I did rim the glass. It turned out to be very pretty.  I found the process of freezing the slush to take the full hour, but once it was appropriately slushed up, it layered beautifully. I thought the brandy layer was very small in appearance compared to the orange, but the flavor turned out to be right.
