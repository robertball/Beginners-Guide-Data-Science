Too chocolatey for me.  But otherwise very good. I followed another reviewer's advise and decreased the chocolate to 2 tsp and that makes it better for me.  Also, I increased the milk to a total of 1/4 cup and it's almost like Coffee Bean.

If you like a really strong chocolate taste...stick with 1 Tbls. If not 1-2 tsp. might be sufficient enough.  Starbucks at home!! Thanks Johanna

Contrary to most of the other reviewers, I don't think this recipe as written is anything close to Starbucks.  However, it is a good starting point.  I'd recommend these changes:
1) Use about 1/2 a cup of extra strong coffee, instead of a full cup of regular.  Brew with the same amount of grounds, just half as much water.  This mimics espresso.
2) Use a lot more milk.  Starbucks mochas are mostly milk, with espresso added.
3) Do use the full tablespoon of both chocolate and sugar.  
With these changes it came much closer to approximating a Starbucks mocha.  I enjoyed it!

this recipe is perfect!  I love cafe mochas from Starbucks, but hate spending $3.00 on one!  This is just as good, and so inexpensive.  Thanks for a great idea!  And I did add a full tablespoon of cocoa to mine, I love the chocolate flavor!

Pretty basic mocha recipe. I suggest you 
do what I did and mix the dry ingredients together and wisk them into the hot coffee in a saucepan, then add a little vanilla flavoring.

Pretty good.  I love coffee and I love flavoured coffee even more.  I did use the full 1 tablespoon  of cocoa and loved it.  Instead of milk though I used my french vanilla flavoured dairy creamer.  I also added extra sugar.  I tend to like my coffee a little sweeter.  All in all pretty good!

Fantastic! I have a little trick for mixing the cocoa with the liquid, as sometimes this can be quite difficult. Mix together the cocoa, sugar, and cinnamon if you add it. Pour in a tiny bit of milk and stir to make a paste. Slowly add the rest of the milk and then the hot coffee. Mmmm!

I thought this was very good...but I did not add the 1 tablespoon as directed, I used 1.5 teaspoons instead. Also I think it would be good with vanilla or rum flavoring added!

Some mornings I just need a kick in the rump to get moving, but I don't like the taste of coffee so I usually don't have any. I decided to give this a try the other day, and was actually pleasantly surprised. I liked the strong chocolate flavor in the coffee, and I replaced the sugar for 4 packets of Splenda. I think the only thing I would change neext time is to use a vanilla flavored creamer instead of the milk to wrap all of the flavors together better.

The only reason I put 4 stars is because I don't really like coffee. But this was good. I reduced the cocoa powder to 1 1/2 tsp and just put in as much milk as I thought it needed. I think it was much better than regular coffee and will make it again.

Love this drink.  One thing I did different after the first time was to put coco and sugar and milk into the mug stir and microwave for about 20 seconds then add coffee. Made mixing everthing together easy.

I have tried a few coffees on here and I didn't care for this one. It tasted like a watered down coffee with unsweetened cocoa. The flavors really didn't come together. Even with the sugar, which I don't normally add to my coffee, it seemed to not be very sweet. It was like drinking coffee water. I could mess with it and add a flavoring or syrup, but as is without additions, it strangely has no taste. I drank one or two sips and then the rest got tossed.

im sure this is better with sugar and whole milk, but if you use skim milk and 2 teaspoons cocoa and splenda, you have a 18 calorie drink with 0.5 grams of fat :)

Very good base recipe!  I think it is fine to 'fluctuate' with the ingredient amounts used (some folks prefer their coffee stronger/creamier/sweeter), and still give 5 stars.  My taste buds are pleased with 2 cups reallly strong coffee, 1/3 cup warm milk, 2 tsp cocoa powder and 1 TB sugar...what a delight from my own pantry, everything on hand.  Thanks for sharing!

Palatable, but the cocoa powder makes it gritty. I wonder if a chocolate syrup wouldn't suit this better. It's easy, and maybe I'll make it again. But maybe not.

This was good.. Not enough to warrant 5 stars but still very good.. Also, I cant honestly give 5 stars because I dont make it as stated anymore.. I put in a tsp of instant coffee, the cocoa and the sugar and enough milk to make 1 mug.. Then heat in d microwave till really hot.. quite different to this recipe but it started out here. I love it like that and drink it often..

I made this coffee several tomes, and made it using 6-oz. of water, 1 TBSP. of NESCAFE' DECAF instant coffee, 1 packet of SACCHARIN SWEETENER, 1 TBSP. HERSHEY'S SPECIAL DARK instant cocoa powder, and 3 TBSP. of 2% milk.  Heated the coffee in the microwave, then topped it with Reddi Wip Whipped Topping.  I preferred the coffee with the changes I made.

This was pretty good- I just had a bitter after taste in mine that I could have done without, but I am certain it's the type of coffee I used.  Next time, if I use the same coffee, I'll add more sugar- even though it really has quite enough sugar.

I used nondairy creamer, which I stirred into the cocoa before adding coffee.  I find that the cocoa dissolves better.  The proportions are good.  Thanks.

I thought it was excellent for something so easy. I used half and half, but didn't change the recipe other than that. Next time I think I'll use my french vanilla creamer just to see. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow..almost like starbucks, except I don't have to pay $3.50 for this.  I used 1/2 Tblsp of cocoa powder, 1 Tblsp of sugar and 2 Tblsp. of milk.  To prevent the lumps I crushed the cocoa powder with the sugar using a spoon to make the mixture a little more finer, and it turned out fine.  And don't forget to top it with whipped cream!

I am a mocha fanatic, but there are no Starbucks where I live. This a great, and healthier, alternative. I used a creme brulee flavored coffee, and heated the milk before adding it. I also used 1 tsp of sugar and two packets of splenda,and added a dash of cinnamon. Following other reviewers' advice, I mixed the dry ingredients and milk into a paste before adding the coffee in order to avoid lumps. A definate keeper!

Bland, bitter and way too chocolate tasting. If I wanted hot chocolate, I would have made it. Wasn't that great, sorry.

It may be my cocoa, because it's old, but I found this really bland and bitter.  I had to add another tsp. of sugar to balance it out, and up the milk to 1/4 cup, and I usually drink coffee without any sugar in it.  I'll try again with new cocoa powder and see if that helps.

So simple, so great! I truly enjoyed this. However, I added more milk when I made it to avoid the bitterness of the coffee and unsweetened cocoa powder. Other than that, I thought it was delicious! I will be making more of this in the future :) thank you for sharing the recipe!

sorry i hate to give a bad rating. I really didn't care for it sorry. I made no changes. It ended up tasting like cocoa water to me. Maybe a really strong brew wouldn be better?

1 Tablespoon cocoa powder is too much, and it needs more milk and less sugar, for my taste.  I'll try 1 teaspoon cocoa, 1-and-a-half teaspoons sugar, and some extra milk (flat, not rounded spoonfulls.)

Oh my gosh. I *never* review recipes, even though I use this site all the time. I have to say something about this one, though, simply because it's day 3 and I've found myself unconsciously reaching for the cocoa powder every morning. I rarely drink coffee-pot coffee; I prefer AeroPress or an espresso. However, my roommates make a pot every morning, and there's always a cup or two left when they're done. This recipe is quick, easy, absolutely delicious, and almost as good as making a real mocha with the fuss of the espresso machine and milk steamer. Plus, I don't have to clean all that up. 

The recipe isn't finicky, in that you can just use a large spoon to guess at 1 Tbls of cocoa instead of pulling out your measuring spoons. I also use 3 cubes of sugar instead of measuring that out. One thing I did change: I use half-and-half instead of milk, because that's in the fridge and no one here drinks milk. I've found that going over 2 tablespoons is fine.... I just fill a cup about 5/8 full of hot coffee, stir the cocoa and sugar into the coffee and make sure they dissolve, and then fill with half-and-half until it turns the creamy colour I'm looking for. Mmmm. Divine.

I ran out of creamer and thought I'd try making my own flavored coffee.
This was far more delicious than I anticipated! I had a latte size coffee cup, so adjusted the amount of ingredients accordingly. I also LOVE nuts with chocolate so added a few drops of pure almond extract. (I wish I knew how to get the almond flavor "toasted".

Five stars because it was super good for the ease it took to make. I substituted a spoonful of Swiss Miss for the sugar and unsweetened cocoa, which might be gross for some, but how easy can you get? I'd added hot cocoa mix a long time ago and thought it was gross, but I didn't understand how key it was to add milk.

This recipe blends better if you heat the cocoa, sugar, and milk in a saucepan to make a chocolate syrup, especially if you want to refrigerate the mocha coffee, to drink it later, cold. Otherwise, you end up with alot of the cocoa powder on the bottom of the container.  I use this recipe to make cold mocha coffee and add more milk to it, to suit my tastes.

This was quite good but I customized it by adding two tablespoons of chocolate syrup instead of the white sugar because I love chocolate and despise granules. Quite fantastic, will make it again and again! I just wish I had some whipped cream to throw on the top. :)

Really good!  I'm more of a chocolate lover than a coffee lover,  so I used the whole tablespoon of cocoa, plus another teaspoon.  Maybe next time I'll add a little bit more.  I used a packet of Equal instead of the sugar and added probably 1/4 milk and a teaspoon of coffeemate.  Yum yum.

Yum!! I've been looking for a coffee drink I will like because I love the smell but hate the taste. I got my first taste of a mocha last week and decided to look it up since my visiting family left their coffee behind. I will probably drink this every morning now! It is definitely sweet, but I really like sweet.

OK for an at home mocha.  I followed the quantities given in the recipe exactly except I tried other's suggestions of mixing the dry together and making a paste before adding the coffee- there were no lumps, but it still had that powdery texture in your mouth. Half and half tasted better than (whole) milk.  Starbucks is much sweeter and smoother, but this is OK for an at home alternative.

Really good if you don't like coffee! With all the cocoa powder, it was more like a hot cocoa with a hint of bitter coffee flavor. I added a little bit of vanilla and sprinkled some cinnamon on top so it smelled (and tasted) amazing!

This recipe is perfect. I'm a dark chocolate person so the chocolate flavor is great for me. I used Penzeys natural high fat cocoa and milk warmed and frothed in my verismo. I like that this recipe has about half the calories of the Starbucks version. As a variation, I've added a drop or two of peppermint extract and candy came sprinkles for a peppermint mocha.

Its okay, not great, it's a little on the bitter side. We use to live in Washington state and I would always get my mochas from Whidbey Coffee - the BEST mochas I've ever had. They beat Starbucks hands down.  Anyway, I'm trying to find a recipe that comes close and this isn't anywhere near it.

Great recipe.  I mixed the powder, sugar, and 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream (not milk) together in the coffee mug first.  Then microwaved for about 20 seconds.  Finally, I poured in the coffee.

Loved it!!  It was the perfect balance of chocolate to coffee ratio!  Half the time when I go to Tim Horton's and I order a Mocha...the hot chocolate machine has run out of syrup which makes my drink neither taste chocolaty or like coffee!  I will Forever make this drink in my mug at home!!  Thanks a million for sharing!!

I brewed flavered coffee, Chocolate Mocha instead of regular (Columbian or Costa Rican for us). I also added 2 tsp as others are suggesting. Instead of milk, I used NF half & half.  Tasted good.

I enjoyed this very much- though I prefer half and half instead of milk(personal preference, as I like my coffee creamy).  Thanks for this simple recipe, it makes a great quick treat.
Edit: I make this all the time now with instant coffee, but I like to cut the cocoa down to 2 tsp and add a pinch of salt and about a half teaspoon of vanilla extract. My favorite - and if I want it iced I just use a little hot water to dissolve things then fill up with milk. Yum!

This tastes just like what I buy for $3.50 a cup at my local coffee house!  It is just what I was looking for- great taste that is not sickeningly sweet, and much cheaper than buying out!

This is now my favorite coffee recipe. It's easy to make and tastes delicious. Prior to this, I had been using packets of instant cocoa in my cup of coffee. I will be making this instead from now on.

Very good, but HOLY  it's chocolatey! WOW!!!! Almost too much, and I looooovvvveee chocolate. I did the thing that someone previously mentioned of adding another tbsp of sugar and it evened it out just fine. Now it's delicious!! :-)  I'm sure it can't be too good for you considering all that sugar, but hey, neither are the ones you get at coffee bars, right??

I made this for my husband. I don't really like coffee much, but he does and needed some extra energy for long shifts he was working. This recipe was nice because I could make it easily for him instead of spending money on a Starbucks Frappaccino or something. I started with the recipe as is, but he thought it needed more sugar and less cocoa. The second time I made it I tripled the recipe, but added less cocoa, more of everything else, and some vanilla. I also added a pinch of salt. As someone who doesn't like coffee AT ALL, I actually sat down and ENJOYED drinking a hot cup of this. My husband liked it too, but he added ice to his. I'm still looking for something more to make it perfect for him, but I thought this was really good.

LOVED this with a couple changes. I kept the cocoa at 1 tbs, upped the sugar to 2 tbs, and 3 tbs milk. The extra sugar evens out the cocoa taste to me. I will be trying it with splenda next time to cut back on the sugar. It was chocolatey, but balanced and that was just what I was looking for. I will definitely be keeping this around as a special treat. Who needs starbucks anyway???

Awesome recipe! I followed it exactly except I substituted Splenda instead of the sugar. It is very chocolate-y but that's what I was looking for. I topped it with some whipped cream and it was to die for!

This was a very good mocha for a simple home-made recipe.  I like it because it calls for simple ingredients that I'll definitely have in my kitchen.  I tried the full amount of cocoa and didn't think it was too chocolaty at all.  This recipe isn't nearly as good as a mocha from a real coffee shop, but it is very good.

I had to add an extra tablespoon of sugar and two extra tablespoons of half and half to make this drinkable, it wasn't nearly sweet enough to be a mocha in my oppinion but I think I like the cocoa addition.

This is a great start to the day. I used 2% milk, but the coffee had a bitter edge, so next time I will use half and half instead and see if that smooths it out. I usually use mexican chocolate to make this, I have never done it from scratch before. Just add a little cinnamon to it and it is almost the same. Thanks Johanna, this was great!

If you decide to follow previous reviewers' advice and make a paste of the cocoa, sugar, and milk before adding coffee and find you have problems getting them to combine, take my advice: microwave the mixture for 15 seconds and it will come together much easier. I use a whisk to ensure there are no lumps, and it's so easy to blend in the coffee and extra milk. I learned this many years ago when I was making microwave hot cocoa and it's very effective. Thanks for sharing, Johanna! I might try using chocolate syrup next time!

As per others' advice, I made the cocoa-sugar-milk paste before adding the coffee. I found that it was still a little lumpy at the end, but that was to be expected. A spoon is definitely recommended. I thought I'd figured out the ideal ratios for a delicious mocha on my own but this was even better one! This is a great, simple recipe which I will use again.

This is a wonderful full flavored drink. I don't add as much cocoa and I add more sugar and instead of milk I put in 2 tbl of powdered creamer. Awesome drink for the early morning work days at the office.

Great!  Just like the coffee shop - add a drop of whipped cream to the top and it's an extra treat.

I thought this was pretty good. I cannot say it is as good as Starbuck's but it certainly was WAY cheaper. It was pretty good though. I added lite whip cream to the top - that makes anything great!!! :) Thanks for the post!

I read a lot of reviews before making this & opted to follow the recipe, but I doubled the milk. Won’t do that again, it took away from tasting the coffee. I would suggest for those of you who don’t really like coffee to use the 1Tbsp of cocoa & 3 Tbsp of milk. To those who are avid coffee drinkers I suggest using 1-2 tsp of cocoa, & the 2 Tbsp milk. When mixing cocoa with liquid, I don’t like fighting to get those little lumps out so I mixed my dry ingredients plus a good shake of cinnamon together first, then added the milk to the mixture, stirred it, but this is the tric

a little bitter for my taste so I added another half tablespoon of sugar another one of milk and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract. i suppose you could even omit the sugar and milk and use vanilla creamer instead but it might be fine for others the way it is so taste and adjust accordingly if desired

I love how quick you and easy this recipie is. I did make a couple modifications though. I only used 2 tsp of cocoa powder as others suggested which I liked much better. Also, for me it was a bit too sugary (although it probably would be this sugary at Starbucks). I typically like 1 1/2 tbsp of sugar.

I really enjoyed it. I have used several different brands of a mocha  on the market and thought that I would look up a recipe. I did use a creamer as to milk.  Thanks, this is perfect for me.

Coffee is one of those drinks that every person has their own personal taste and knowing that this recipe is an ok as a base. I made the recipe as written. I  followed the suggestion to  mix the cocoa powder, sugar and milk  first creating a mocha "syrup" then added coffee. The results were not anything like what I would get at a local coffee shop or even Starbucks if I were to order a mocha and as written I did not like the recipe. I ended up adding some flavored creamer  to cut the bitterness and to get it to where I could drink it.

As written, I give 3 stars. With changes, it could be 5 stars... I use a cup of STRONG brewed coffee, 1 tablespoon cocoa, 1 tablespoon sugar, a tiny pinch of salt, and 2 tablespoons heavy cream. This way is excellent!

Used French pressed coffee, brown sugar instead of white and a third of the recommended cocoa; tastes just like Tim Horton's mocha. I do wish I had whipped cream with me though.

OK coffee. I followed the recipe, except for the sugar. Since other reviewers said this coffee was overly sweet,   I just used a pinch of sugar.

I made it according to the directions.  Something is missing. Not sure what though...lol. I added two more teaspoons of sugar and more one teaspoon of milk. Pretty tasty now. I like my mocha a little sweeter. 
I am new to this mocha thing and speciality drinks. 

Overall, I like it. Thank you. It saves me $4.97, ($5.40 now) at the coffee places, a 16 oz, hot mocha mocha...lol. I will use it again.

Absolute perfection! I used espresso, four shots and blended one tablespoon of cocoa with a rounded tablespoon of sugar. I frothed 2% milk, approximately 10 oz.  I added a splash of fat free half and half.

Anything that doesn't use espresso will be nothing like Starbucks, because while one user was right theirs is mostly milk, that is true of all espresso drinks other than a shot or Americano. Anything that isn't espresso you need to use much more coffee while with espresso the ratio is for a 16 oz. drink, 3oz syrup, 4oz espresso, and 9oz milk/foam depending on the drink whether it's cappuccino style, latte style or just steamed with whipped cream on top.

Thought this came out great!  I was looking for a quick and easy way to chocolate up my brewed coffee and this totally hit the mark exactly.  I did use the extra dark cocoa powder, but that was just because it was all I had.  It tastes wonderful!

Note:  To those who are looking for a Starbucks Mocha, this is not going to be the exact same thing.  Unless your order is a regular drip coffee with mocha added.  A "mocha" at Starbucks is a chocolate latte.   Which is a whole different ball game from drip coffee :).  But this recipe is a great mocha coffee!

This is one of the best hot mochas I've ever had and the first one I've ever made. I used Hershey's special dark cacoa and loved every sip of it. Highly recommended for those who need a chocolaty fix- especially with dark cacoa!

Mixes much more easily if you put the cocoa, sugar and milk into the cup first, stir until no lumps, and then pour in the coffee and stir until dissolved. Yummy!

This was awesome!  It is chocolately, but that is a good thing for me in a mocha.  I added about 4 T of milk, but kept the cocoa and the sugar the same.  This will be a regular at our home!

I used hot cocoa mix (about 1 tbs) from whole foods and half and half and it tasted like it came from a coffee shop. Yum

If you want it to taste like Starbucks, you need an espresso machine and you need a Starbucks brand coffee. You also need to steam the milk you want to use in your coffee. If I remember correctly,they use a syrup especially for their coffee, not a powder. With all that said, use a gourmet brand coffee (Starbucks or otherwise), brew it 2tbs per 6oz, then steam your milk until hot to touch. If it starts to smell funny, it's too hot and you've scorched it. If you want it to froth, tilt your container to create a vortex and keep the nozzle just at the tip of the milk's surface. Once it looks like all the froth can be made and it's almost too silent, lower the nozzle even more in and wait for the milk to get hot. You may need more milk than you'll use in your coffee. Pour the coffee OVER the ingredients (cocoa powder, sweetener), which should be in the cup already. Powder mixes better after you pour on the hot liquid, not before. For a more round taste, add a vanilla coffee syrup. I do this with nearly every chocolate drink I make. A tad of evaporated milk helps too.

Liked it a lot--as is. I also tried it with a lo-cal sugar product and a few mini marshmallows. YUM! Not a big coffee fan, but a big fan of Tim Horton's Cafe Mocha and this was close :)

Whenever I want a pretty good mocha I normally go to one of the little corner stores and get a cup, but I thought this recipe was pretty good. I'm a real chocolate lover too.

For me the coffee flavor still overpowered all of the other flavors so I ended up adding .5 tablespoon of cocoa powder and a little extra milk.  I also added some vanilla flavoring like some others suggested (after taking a sip of the original recipe!).

As others suggested, used 2 teaspoons cocoa.  Nice little chocolately flavor without drowning out the purpose of the drink:  coffee.  If I wanted hot chocolate, I would make one.  A mocha should still taste like the amazingness that is a cup of coffee!

This was the first recipe of Mocha that I tried and I love it but I also love the extra chocolate flavor..This recipe  is short sweet and simple and very easy for me to make on my way out the door to work every morning. I added my own touch to it and topped the mocha off with whipped cream and chocolate syrup which made it even better! You can use any type of flavor of syrup that you choose.

Excellent coffee once you cut back a bit on the cocoa powder. I cut back to  1 1/2 tbsp. and it was perfect.  Easy and of course cheaper than going to the coffee shop every day. Thanks for sharing!

all the ingredients perfect, but the only thing is one tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa in one cup of coffee gives you too much of an after taste of the cocoa. and you definitely need more that 2 tablespoons of milk.

Really yummy!  I subbed vanilla soy milk and added like half cup for a more creamy drink.  I would like to try espresso for a more authentic mocha next time, but this definitely satisfied my need for a coffee house coffee!  Thanks for the recipe (and saving me 4 bucks I would spend out!)

I thought this was really good!  I filled my to go mug with coffee (so I probably used more than a cup of coffee, but I wasn't measuring)  then I followed the rest of the recipe to the tee.  I no longer have to waste money and time buying coffee in the mornings!! I will make this again! It was so easy and quick!

I even used "brand name" coffee and it was just okay.  The taste was fine, but it seemed a bit grainy to me.  I wonder if this would be better if the unsweetened cocoa was replaced with chocolate syrup?  

Update:  So, I tried this instead:  2 T of "international coffee-mocha" powder mix, a 6 oz cup of coffee and some milk.  So good and not grainy at all.

Very good!  I used more like 2 cups of coffee, and 1/4 cup milk, warmed in the microwave.  Delicious!!!

This is good. This would be a great after dinner serve with dessert coffee. Ingredients are measured just right. Not too sweet, not bitter, excellent. Thanks.

This is a great and easy way to make a mocha. Just make sure you stir it up if you're sipping slowly because the cocoa settles at the bottom. I always serve with a spoon in it. Ever since I first made this, my friends come to my house asking me if I'm making coffee!

4 stars with the following changes:  1 tsp cocoa powder, 2 tsp sugar and a dash of cinnamon.  Great treat and easy to make.  Thanks!

I thought this recipe for a mocha was pretty good! The only thing is that it doesn't really have enough of a flavor. Maybe it just needs more chocolate or maybe cinnamon?
