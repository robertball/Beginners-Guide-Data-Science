Quick and easy.  I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins.

These are fabulous, I used just about 1/4 cup of chocolate chips instead of raisins and I used 3 TBS of brown sugar instead of white, then I melted some salted butter with about 2-3TBS of honey and brushed it on top when they came out of the oven. YUM!! These were sooo good!

Love this recipe.  I personally don't use raisins, no one in the family eats them in things, but these are moist and yummy.  Great with a honey butter!  And they smell heavenly when they bake.

These are really good.  I added a handful grated cheese and a pinch of dill.  Great with a hearty stew.

My husband loved these and asked if I would keep making them, yes of course, thanks Holly! Make a batch with rasins and one without, great both ways.

They tasted too much like beer for me, but since I don't like beer that much, I'm probably not the best judge. I'd like to try using wine coolers or something instead.  And I need more sugar.

Made these for a St. Patrick's Day coffee clutch.  I made them with the raisins, but did add the brown sugar and brushed them with melted butter and honey after baking them, as one reviewer suggested.  They were great and so easy to make.

These were pretty good and very easy to make.  They taste more like "beer biscuits" to me because of the Bisquick, not that that's all bad!  Good, but certainly not one of my favorites.

These were pretty tasty. Made them without raisins but wish I had added the cheese that others did. The beauty of these is their simple ingredients!

I was out of baking mix so I made my own using 'Homemade Baking Mix' from AR.  Knowing my guys would not be crazy about the raisins, I made this recipe three ways.  Without raisins, with dried cranberries, and with dried cranberries and cheddar cheese.  They were a fan of all three.  I baked in greased mini muffin pans for 13 minutes and it yielded 36 muffins.

I did add a titch more beer, and also used shredded cheese instead of the raisins.  This would be GREAT with chili!  Definitely saving this and making it again.

Much better than the beer bread mix on AR. I used the whole can of beer (which is about 1.5 cups, give or take) so I was able to stretch this to make 12 muffins. Omitted the raisins and added a cup or so of shredded mild white cheddar and a tablespoon of dried dill. So delicious! Even tastier when warmed up and lightly buttered. Recipe is a keeper!
