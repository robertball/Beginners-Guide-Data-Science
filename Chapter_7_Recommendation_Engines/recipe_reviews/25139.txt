O.K. here is my take!  Left out the peppers because neither my husband or I like them and substituted celery instead.  Did cut the recipe in half and still had left-overs!  Substituted white wine for the sherry and did not use any water at all.  I also used egg noodles and added some linguine to make up my shortfall.  The end result was "spectacular" and my husband said it was a super recipe and please, please, make again!

I didn't read the reviews before making this recipe first.  I didn't pay attention to how much it made.  We have tons of leftovers!

I ended up using wide egg noodles as I had them on hand.  I didn't add the additional 2 cups of water because the chicken broth was already watery enough.  It makes me wonder if the gal who posted this recipe intended to put chicken broth granuals or something for all the water that it calls for.  Anyway, I omitted it on my own.

I suggest using less sherry.  I used Marsala wine and it gave was too much flavor.  I can imagine the same would happen with cooking sherry.  And we omitted the peppers as my husband hates them.

Overall, we'll have it again.  But will cut the recipe in 1/2, use little or no wine/sherry, no additional water after the broth, and will leave out the peppers.

I am glad I read the reviews on this first and realized that the recipe was for 12 people. I shortened it to 6 and it was wonderful. Everyone had seconds!!  The only thing I did different is cut the water down to 8oz . The first time I made it, it was a little watery. I would definately recommend this recipe!!!

This was great!  Here are the changes I made:  Cream of Celery soup (instead of mushroom); left out all water as others suggested; boiled noodles in turkey broth (boiled turkey bones from Thanksgiving and froze broth) and used this broth in recipe;  instead of plain salt and pepper, added Creole seasoning (seasoned salt);  left out sherry; added bread crumbs to top.  This had a real depth of flavor, probably because the noodles were boiled in broth.  Will definitely keep (the modified version of) this recipe in my "favorites" cookbook.

This was really good.  I liked it and so did my husband.  Although, instead of chopping up veggies, I made it easier by using pre-sliced mushrooms and frozen veggies instead of the green pepper.  I also mixed dry bread crumbs and butter and put it on top before I put it into the oven.  This really made it good!  Try it!

This is sooo good.  I made slight modifications due to the ingredients I had at home.  I did not use mushrooms or peas.  I used Vidalia sweet onion instead of green onions.  I used a red bell pepper instead of green.  That added nice color to the finished product.  We had muscadine red wine, so I used that instead of the sherry.  Also before I found the worstershire sauce, I added a splash of soy sauce.  Once I found the worstershire sauce, I added about a tablespoon of that.  Oh, one more change.  Instead of adding water, I used a whole can of chicken broth.  Superb!  I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.

Thanks to earlier reviews, I used one cup of cut scallions (rather than a yellow or white onion), and a red pepper (rather than a green one). I also used one can cream of mushroom soup and one can cream of celery soup. I used 2 tblsp. olive oil and 1 tbsp. butter to sautee the mushrooms, onion, and pepper in, and it was plenty (you don't need all that butter). The dish was coming along just great until I added the chicken broth. It diluted the flavors to the point where I had to add more soup! Definitely avoid adding liquid to this dish. The soups will carry it just fine. I also used low fat cheddar cheese and about 1/4 c. dry sherry.

Next time I make this, I'll probably make my own "soups" to bring the calorie, fat, and sodium counts down. The celery adds a nice flavor though, so if you stay with the recipe as it is (sans liquid) I recommend replacing one can of the mushroom soup with a can of celery soup. The scallions and red pepper also add a unique touch that I prefer over onions and green pepper. 

This recipe points you in a good direction, but it needs refining to make it "zing".

Excellent recipe. Creamy and cheesy without being heavy thanks to the broth and creamed soup combo. Adding the peas and green peppers make it a great one dish dinner. I added a few tablespoons of the sherry that was the only adjustment. It gets rave reviews from my place. Keeps well in the refrigerator and we didn't mind eating it later on in the week at all!

Tres Fantastique! Fighting nearly broke out over the last serving. This was an elegant dish with the (wide, thin, long) pappardelle noodles I used. Great meal to take to someone as it can be baked at the recipient's house. I did, however, make and recommend these changes and tips: 1) replace the green pepper with red (much prettier), and shallot for onion if you have it, 2)eliminate the water, and 3)replace the chicken broth with milk (maybe even evaporated) and a spoon of chicken base/bouillon. I omitted the salt. The sauce will be perfect. 4)the peas can be optional. 5)My husband suggests a dash of hot sauce or cayenne. FINALLY, pair with broccoli and/or something (bread?) with fresh rosemary in it...the rosemary is an incredible accent!! Oh yes, I used a lot of regular sherry, NOT cooking sherry, as cooking sherry is very salty.

Very good.  I substituted white wine for the sherry and used red pepper instead of green. I also left out the Worcestershire. Looked very nice but best of all tasted very good.  I halved the recipe and it made a little over 6 servings.

Thanks Doris, I LOVE this recipe! I used a family sized can of Cr of Mushroom soup, cut the water down to 1/2 cup. I sauteed chopped celery with the onion, I didnt have cooking Sherry so I used about 3 TA of regular Sherry. I also added some sliced black olives, its delicious! For the 2 c of cheese, I used monteray jack/cheddar cheese mix.
I would recommend your recipe! PS It makes alot, I have lots of leftovers. A good way to use your leftover turkey:)

After many years of different takes on TT (my own and others' and as a kid), have to report this is absolute PERFECTION - flavor-wise, consistency-wise, and comfort-wise. Half the butter called for is more than enough. Added asparagus chopped to 1" pcs, chopped shoestring carrots and fresh baby spinach & sauteed very lightly with mushrooms etc. Used Progresso cream of mushroom soup (no msg), so additional liquid wasn't needed - had chicken broth on hand just in case. No cooking sherry in cupboard so substituted sweet vermouth. For shredded cheese, combined extra sharp cheddar and 4-cheese Mexican. If using spaghetti-type pasta, be sure to break in half or thirds (in my humble opinion, egg noodles would overpower the other ingredients) and please don't forget the parmesan on top - a crunchy treat. This recipe makes a lot & it is great the next day. Will make full recipe next time & freeze more than half. Looking for reasons to roast another turkey (or chicken) breast soon (precooked just wouldn't be the same).

Really good use of leftovers. I had to make some substitutions. Used 2 small cans of mushrooms,  red pepper, red onion, cream of celery soup. I didn't add any water, peas or salt. I think this might be good with some chopped spinach in it.

TOO MUCH LIQUID. I think there is an error in the recipe. There is no way it calls for 2 cups of chicken broth, 2 cans of CCOM soup and 2 cups of water. This is a huge portion and the picture obviously shows egg white noodles and the recipe called for linguine pasta. Didn't taste good due to the water factor. Very upset I wasted my time and my money.

I thought this was a wonderful way to use our leftover turkey dark meat (no one in my family likes it.) I had read the other reviews and so I (of course) made a couple of adjustments. First, I left out the bell peppers. I added the sherry immediately after sauteeing the mushrooms and onions together. I used a really nice dry Amontillado and adding it to the hot pan cooked out all the alcohol, leaving only the flavor. I thought the sherry complimented the Parmesan cheese PERFECTLY. I also only used one can of cream-of-mushroom soup and a whole can of chicken broth-cutting out the rest of the liquid. I added a large, drained jar of diced pimentos when I added the peas to the sauce and topped off the casserole with crushed herb crackers and Parmesan cheese. AWESOME!

Loved this one!  The key to using condensed mushroom soup in any recipe is to add sherry or wine - it takes away that artificial casserole taste.  I did leave out half the water as others suggested.  I hate soupy casseroles.  I also used red bell pepper because that's what I had on hand.

This was a great recipe!  I combined some ideas from previous reviewers and this came out very good!  I halved the recipe because everyone said there was way too much sauce.  But even after halving the recipe I still had way too many nooldles - next time I will cut back even more on the noodles.  I used 3 Tbsp of butter and sautéed the onion and mushroom and omitted the peppers.  I used 1 can of fat-free cream of chicken soup (instead of mushroom), 1 cup of chicken broth and omitted the water all together.  I added about ¼ cup of milk (to make it a little creamier) and added about 2 oz of light Velveeta cheese.  I did not add the Worcestershire sauce or sherry but I did add ¼ white cooking wine.  I also added some frozen green peas, turkey, salt and pepper and baked it.  It turned out fantastic!  Just like Stouffers!

Unlike most people using this site, I made this recipe exactly as written.  It was wonderful.  Rave reviews from the entire family.  I suspect the recipe I viewed had been corrected as there was no mention of "water" but rather chicken broth.  Only thing I omitted was the extra tsp of salt finding there was plenty of sodium in the condensed soup and cheeses.  Well done.  Loved it !!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe -- it would be PERFECT without the added water. I made the mistake of not reading the other reviews before I made it and though the flavor was great, the extra water was not needed at all and it was too runny for my tastes. I will definitely make it again, but will not add any of the water.  Great flavor, though and watch out, it does make a lot. I am enjoying the leftovers today for lunch -- yum!

This is a tasty recipe.  However, there is too much liquid for an 11x14" pan.  I would suggest either baking this in two separate casserole dishes OR if you like yours a little thicker just leave out the added water. Good overall.

I found that the additional water was a bit too much liquid. I would suggest using 1/2 as much.  Other than that, is a great dish!

This was a pretty tasty recipe - even without the chicken.  The only meat I had in the house was a couple cans of vienna sausage... soooo I sliced those up, tossed them in, and hoped for the best.  Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.  Just goes to show how versatile this recipe can be.  I didn't add any of the water (per other reviewers) and it turned out perfect - creamy but not wet.  I also used a very dry sherry and used only 1/4 cup.  It still had a nice sherry taste but wasn't overpowering.  I also omitted the salt, since the mixture tasted plenty salty enough without it.  This one's a keeper!

This ended up being a very soggy dish...not creamy like I had expected.  If I ever made it again, I would use MUCH LESS cooking sherry.  The taste of it was overwhelming.

This recipe needs to be cut in half. This amount feeds a huge family. I recommend that salt and pepper should be added before the casserole gets baked. We thought it was a little bland.

Love this recipe. We're not big fans of dark meat so this was perfect for thanksgiving leftovers.  I halfed the recipe and added more pepper and Worcestershire, then added garlic and thyme. It was delicious!

It is always SO hard to find the "perfect" yummy casserole. Well THIS is it! I never changed a thing, used my own homemade chicken stock and put it in the oven in the pan I cooked it in. Simple, yummy, a total family pleaser. Can't wait to freeze some to see what it will be like then. Just serve with a salad and say "dinner's ready"! Enjoy. The recipe doesn't call for any 'extra' water so don't know what those comments are referring to.

Chicken Tetrazzini Deluxe Haiku: "Boy, was I surprised. I had low expectations. But this was awesome!" Definitely not gourmet fare, but for creamy, easy comfort food with a light brush of flavor, this was much better than I'd anticipated. Imagine my surprise to note when I put it in the oven that I'd forgotten to mix in the cheddar cheese, and we didn't miss it one bit. (I also included several minced garlic cloves to the saute.) As we shoveled mouthfuls, we decided that if I made it again, I'd add chopped broccoli, and swap the green bell for red. Oh and as written, it's obvious that it makes a ton, so 
I scaled it to 4 servings, which was the perfect amount - I'd prepared it a day ahead and it made coming home from work a cinch b/c all I had to do was add the parmesan and paprika and throw it in the oven.

Very good - I wouldn't exactly call it tetrazzini as it wasn't very creamy but it was a very good casserole. We used whole wheat pasta and extra peas.

This dish is very flavourful and simple to make. If you do not have cooking sherry try using white wine, it works well too. This is dish is definitely something I will make again and again.

This was okay but lacked any significant flavor.  Like previous reviewers, I cut down on the water.  And even cutting the recipe in half still came out with a huge amount! Was good but don't think I will try again unless I see a version with some more spice or flavor.

Excellent recipe.  I am not a big fan of mushroom texture so I omitted the fresh ones.  I also omitted all of the water & the finished dish was plenty moist.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly & it is the best tetrazzini I have ever had.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This was the best ever - despite the fact that I changed a lot of the recipe (not on purpose - I just didn't read it through and messed up in a few areas).  It's a very forgiving recipe - I don't know how anyone could screw this one up!  First, I used a store bought roasted chicken, left out the onion and green pepper and sauteed the mushroom ahead as I do not like them too soft.  I used a healthy version of cream of chicken, and didn't even measure the sherry and worchestershire - I just guessed!  I had a lot of sauce left over that I decided to not put in the dish - it looked like too much.  But after baking, it seemed a bit dry.  So for re-heating purposes, I kept some extra sauce on the side for tomorrow.  VERY, VERY good!  My fussy 13 yo daughter really like it.  I will make this often.

I've been looking for a while for a recipe for turkey tetrazzini. The one at the middle school my mother works at is sooo delicious. I used this recipe as a guideline b/c it wasn't quite like theirs. But after a few adjustments using what I know is in their tetrazzini and from previous reviews, this was a delicious meal!
1. I cut the recipe in half and still lots left over.
2.I used egg noodles (much better)
3.I used NO fresh mushrooms, bell pepper, green peas, nor sherry.(but this is personal preference)
4.I did use water (if not it would have been too dry, sorry)
5.I used a stalk of celery and pimentos to replace the peppers/peas. 
6.Since I don't cook whole turkeys or chicken, I used canned turkey (you can also buy chicken this way. This is for people looking for shortcuts)
7.Thanks to other reviews, I too used velveeta cheese (more expensive but soooo delicious)
8.I used the Worcestershire sauce, but won't the next time. I don't like the smell or taste too much. Not needed.
9.After transferring to the baking dish, I sprinkled store bought bread crumbs (also for those who want short cuts)across the top of the casserole and sprinkled melted country crock spread and cheese on top of that.
10. I let it sit for about 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven, served with green beans and crescent rolls. 

My family loved it!

I am new to cooking and was very excited at how this dish came out. I cut the recipe in half because we are a family of 4, but I made a few changes thanks to other reviews I read:(I only used 1/2 can of water ) I did not use any sherry and instead of the cheddar cheese I used a 16oz block of velveta cheese. I also added a half cup of red bell pepper.  It took me much longer to make than the recipe says,(25 min just to saute) but worth it!!  I would definately make this again.

I'm so bummed! I wasted so much food last night. I made the recipe as is & didn't have time to read the reviews. It was a runny mess and all I could taste was the mushroom flavor from the soup. I took one bite and so did my husband. I won't be making again. Sorry. :(

Edible but nothing special. The sauce was too watery, not very flavoursome and the recipe makes way too much (even though I reduced it by half). Perhaps white rice would work better than pasta as it would soak up the sauce however I am not willing to waste ingredients trying.

I must admit, I missed the comments that this recipe makes so much!  It was very tasty -- a perfect comfort meal for a frigid evening.  I didn't use peppers and used all chicken broth instead of water and would likely cut back on the amount -- it was a little soupy.  Other than that, will use again -- likely with additions -- I like the idea of adding celery -- and remember -- it makes A LOT!  Thanks Doris.

Loved it!! I'm a college student and "beginning" cook, and I found this recipe to be fast and easy but not lacking in taste like some "fast easy" recipes.  It was really really good.  I had my neighbors coming in and eating it!

I made this today with my leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I wanted so badly to like it and based on the ingredients we should have loved it. The only thing I omitted was the cooking Sherry. I don't drink and I don't like the taste of wine in my food. So I omitted it.  It made up easy but the sauce had an odd taste...I think it was the Worcestershire sauce. I cook with mushroom soup all the time and we love it. But this didn't work for us. My kids didn't like the Parmesan on the top either. I think I would try this again and omit the cheese and the Worcestershire sauce. Also I agree with the other reviews in that this recipe makes A LOT. I would 1/2 the recipe at least until you know you like it.

I made two batches of this recipe; one gluten-free and one regular.  Changes I made: using only one can of soup and substituting one cup of cream for the other.  Using sweet red pepper with the green pepper to add a touch of color.  The recipe called for cooking sherry, because of excessive sodium concerns I went with regular--not cooking--but I think extra dry sherry would also be good.
I would add that one does need to use at least an 11 X 14 pan.  All I had on hand were 9 X 13's and the oven was a mess from the boil over. If you are feeding children I would recommend breaking up the pasta before boiling to make serving themselves easier.
Because I made both batches at the same time for one dinner, prep took longer than I would have liked, but the family said it was worth the wait.  It also freezes well for any that wondered, add a bit of milk before microwaving the thawed dish to add back the creaminess of the fresh.

OMG good!!!  My husband said that I should make it once a week.  There are only two of us, so I cut the recipe in half.  I'm going to freeze the second half today and have the rest of first half tonight with different sides than last night.  Can't wait!

I halved this & didn't add the sherry because of the kids.  If anything made this deluxe, I guess it would be the sherry.  Without that, it's like leftovers; but freshly made.  Okay, but no wows here.

I cut the recipe in half for 6, I used a whole can of chicken broth instead of the 1 cup plus water, I also used spaghetti noodles.  I would have liked to add carrots too but didn't think about it until the baking dish was in the oven. My children and husband ate it, so it must not have been bad :)

Delicious!  I am usually not a canned-mushroom-soup-casserole kind of gal, but I love this!  My husband grinned ear to ear when he walked in the door and smelled the gorgeous fragrance coming from the oven.  I modified a few things, according to other suggestions and my taste:  I used fresh whole wheat linguine, and only a 12 oz package and it was plenty; I used a little olive oil instead of butter, I skipped the water altogether, and I used a cup of white wine instead of the sherry.  Yummy!!!!  I'll be making this again!

Very good...DO NOT ADD WATER ..too soupy!  The water might help if you are using egg noodles or something thicker than linguini.  Also I would add less sherry next time.  Overall a good casserole for leftover turkey and chicken.

This recipe was so easy and so good.  It is now a favorite in my house.  I did sub wheat pasta for regular and cut down the water to half.  I used white wine instead of sherry.  Hubby is not a casserole fan but is begging me to make this at least once a week

Used this to do something with leftovers.  Had a ton of gravy left, so used that in place of the soup and topped with a thin layer of stuffing.  Don't like green peppers, so used celery instead, but thats a personal thing.  Excellent.

WOW! Super recipe! Didn't make any changes (except to leave out the water). Can't wait to try it again experimenting with different noodles. Used fettucine this time -yum! Highly recommended.

This is good, I've made it several times.  I don't add the extra water it calls for though, because that makes it too soupy for my taste.  The sherry adds an interesting flavor.

This was delicious and a great way to use leftover turkey!  I omitted the green pepper and used white cooking wine instead of sherry, and I also used canned mushrooms.  It was great!

This was a huge hit at a baby shower.  I didn't give this 5 stars because I altered it after reading other reviews saying it was a little bland.  This is what I did to avoid being bland:  I used cream of chicken (2) and cream of celery (1) sauteed mushrooms in garic then added chopped onions, added 1 herbox bouillon cube.  I deglazed the pan after with the broth (I used 2-1/2 cups of broth instead of 2) to pick up more flavor I also added garlic and onion powder and black pepper to the soup mixture.  I buttered 2 pans and heated in a buffet sterno heating unit.  RAVE REVIEWS.!!!!

I just didn't care for the flavor of this recipe.  I've made other tetrazinni recipes that are much better.  Skip this one!
I didn't add the water & it was still soupy.  Sherry flavor was overpowering.

This was delicious! I made just a couple of changes.  Instead of frozen peas, I substituted a package of frozen mixed vegetables to give it even more flavor (and color!).  I also added some yellow and red bell peppers with the green.  I took the advice of others and cut out the water and cooked the linguini al dente - it worked out very well.  I also sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on top with the parmesan.  It made a very nice topping after it was baked.  Also, be sure to use a very large pot when mixing it all up - a lot goes into this casserole!  Cheers!!

served this to my family and received rave reviews. my grandson asked if i'd make it every time they visited.  I was careful not to cook the pasta too long the first time, since it continues to cook in the sauce in the oven.  I think I'll try it with fresh pasta next time. Delicious!

This turned out great -- a perfect quick dinner to throw together after work.  My nearly 3 year old even enjoyed helping make (and eat)it.  I halved the recipe & omitted the water as per other reviews & was thankful I did.  Also, we don't like peppers so I added lightly steamed chopped broccoli instead, which worked just fine.

Great recipe for leftover turkey (in my case, turkey that had been frozen a while and was rather dry). I halved the recipe and cut the butter to under two tablespoons and it worked great. Still made a big pan -- I can't imagine how much it would have made as a full batch! Good, common ingredients; easy to prepare, and very flavorful.

I really liked this, but it makes a lot.  I have a family of 5 & 1/2 recipe was enough.  In step one, I added celery. In step 3, I omitted the water & added 1/4 cup of mayo & 1/4 tsp of dry mustard.  Also, this is very good with red peppers instead of green.  Lastly, you can't add too much cheese.

Absolutely delicious! My whole family loved this, even my 7 year old who hates mushrooms couldn't stop raving about this dish! It was also a wonderful way to use leftover Christmas turkey. I didn't change a thing, but I could see how I could experiment with different cheeses, veggies and meats to add variety to this dish. Thank you for sharing this recipe, it was wonderful! Oh, by the way, the other reviewers are right, this does make ALOT! I cut it in half and we still had lots of leftovers!

Pretty good. Added some celery in the saute, used no water, reduced sherry (not our favorite) to 2 TBLS and used red and green peppers instead of any peas. Good! However, next time, I will use no sherry...perhaps some white wine instead. And it DOES make a lot, so either feed a crowd or you might want to cut it by half!!

What a delicious dish!!  My guests all had 3 helpings, and they are food snobs.  I used  red peppers instead of green and used a little extra sherry and a little less water but I was very impressed with the results.  I look forward to making it again

Very tasty.  We made this after Thanksgiving with Turkey and loved it.  It makes a lot though, so we used two casserole dishes.  We are now making for Christmas with Chicken this time.

Good flavor, and my 2 year old liked the pasta.  It's hard to get her to eat much of anything, so I cook pasta often.  Although I enjoyed the flavor, it was a bit watery.  Maybe add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce, or omit/reduce the water.

VERY tasty & hit the spot on a day I desired 'comfort food.' At first I was concerned there was too much liquid, but after it finished baking--it was perfect. My nine-year old daughter liked it, too. Maybe I didn't rate the quickness as high probably because I started out from scratch by cooking up fresh chicken instead of using left-overs.  This one will be a repeat for us, however I may just 1/2 the recipe since there are only three of us.  I'll see how well it freezes/reheats.  Side note: I crumbled Ritz crackers on top to give it some crunch.  It was yummy!  :-)

This was classic comfort food.  I made it (halved it) without reading the reviews and used the required amount of water.  It seemed fairly watery at first but it really firmed up with the leftovers.  I used chicken sauteed with spices so that jazzed it up a bit, but any additional herbs will flavor this dish to anyone's liking!  Excellent.

Made this a second time with our leftover turkey from thanksgiving. This time i didn't add cheddar cheese or chicken broth. We didnt miss the cheddar at all. I only used fresh shaved parm on top. Used wine instead of sherry, added tons of fresh mushrooms and topped with seasoned bread crumbs. . Next time I'll add minced garlic and season the turkey prior to adding it to the veggies and pasta. Ill also used more bread crumbs. Total comfort food.

Very nice. I only read a few reviews...weren't helpful. Sherry seems to really add to a Tetrazinni dish. I used the listed cup of broth (used post holiday turkey carcass to make a broth with Mirapoix ingredients) and skipped suggested salt since the cheeses, Worcestershire sauce and soup have plenty. Use whatever pasta you have. I also halved the recipe, I have no Army to feed, or freezer.

fantastic recipe for a quick dinner. Followed the recipe pretty closely, though I halved it for the two of us. Used cream of celery soup, 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of half and half, though in the future I think I'll use all chicken broth for a more soupy consistency. I don't have sherry so I added about 1/4 cup additional chicken broth, 1 tbs of lemon juice and 1 tbs of vinegar. Used egg noodles and topped with bread crumbs and paprika. on my own plate, I added a ton of red pepper flakes because I like spicy, but even without, this was fantastic.

Really wonderful recipe.  I substituted red cooking wine for the sherry (just didn't have any sherry!) and it came out fabulous.  I added a bit more black pepper to taste..but really, this one is a winner.  Without the banking time, I think I managed to get this together in about 15 minutes.  Used leftover rotisserie chicken bits...MMM!  Thank you for the great recipe.

Wow. Not a good recipe. Soupy and bland.  After I made this, I checked out others recipes and they all called for flour.  Next time, flur to thicken the sauce.

We just ate this for dinner and it was really good. The only thing I changed was to add some garlic to the veggies and used shrimp instead of chicken or turkey just because I had some in the fridge.

This is very tasty. Followed recipe for 6 servings ingredient list exactly except for minor changes.  Left out mushrooms, don't like 'em. Sauted chopped red bell pepper and red onion until soft, added a couple shakes of crushed red pepper, salt and pepper and added the 1/4 cup table sherry and 2-3 shakes of worcestershine.  Let that cook 2-3 minutes before adding the chicken broth.  Brought to a simmer, added chicken soup and stirred until everything was blended well and bubbling.  Added peas and a couple dashes of fresh nutmeg. Then 1 cup colby/jack and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, then linguine and torn chicken. Put in baking crock topped with another 1/2 cup parmesan. Left out the paprika.  YUM!  Will make this again!

I was out of cream of mushroom so used cream of chicken and celery and only 1 can of broth. This makes a  ton but  4 of us scarfed it down! Oh and at the end of cooking I mixed melted butter and bread crumbs and sprinkled it on top, baked for five more minutes, yum!

I used egg noodles, asparagus instead of peppers, added carrots, used only one can soup, 1 cup broth, and 1 cup cheese. Substituted spinach for peas. I also added brad crumbs to the topping. It was a bit salty.

very easy recipe, I changed the order of the ingredients into the skillet so that the sherry could cook off a little. I used a package of 3 cheeses instead of all cheddar and used leftover turkey. everyone loved it.  I made it two days prior to the event and froze.

Yum, Yum, Yum, what more can I say.  Only gave it four because of the excess of water in the recipe.  It is absolutely not necessary.  I did not even use quite as much chicken brothe as specified

I can't use parmisan cheese because it behaves like MSG in the body, and I have a bad reaction to it.  So I substituted motzarella and the dish was too bland.  Probably much better with the parmisan.

I'm glad I read the reviews before trying this recipe as I left out the water as suggested and the consistency was perfect (added a bit more chicken broth and sherry instead). I made it the night before and baked it for dinner the next day and the family loved it. Also poached a chicken breast fresh from the meat dept since I didn't have any leftovers. I would make this again.

This was great!  I absolutely did not add the water - it wasn't necessary.  Aside from cutting the amounts in half since this recipe serves 12, I followed the rest of the recipe pretty much exactly and we were very happy with the results.  Tasty, hearty, and satisfying!

This was pretty good. The sauce wasn't as cheesy as I would have liked, more like a gravy. My husband said it was like a tuna casserole with chicken. That wasn't really what I had in mind, but it was still tasty.

My family and I loved it. I did use roasted garlic mushroom soup.I didn't use any water but added 8 ozs. of sour cream. The next time I make it, I will break the linguine in half just to make it easier to mix together.

Use one can of cream of mushroom and a can of sour cream for a richer flavor. Add peas, corn, celery, anything--this recipe is so versatile!  Always a hit with the family and I freeze the leftovers.

Great way to use up leftover turkey!  I halved the recipe and it filled an 8" X 8" baking dish.  To cut down on fat, I used reduced-fat cheese and soup, and sauteed the onions, etc. in olive oil instead of butter.  Like others suggested, I halved the water but will omit it entirely next time.  I recommend red bell pepper instead of green for flavor and color.

THIS WAS WONDERFUL. MY FAMILY LOVED IT. THERE WERE A FEW THINGS I DID NOT DO THOUGH. LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWER'S I LEFT OUT THE WATER AND THE CHEDDAR CHEESE. I PUT CHUNKS OF BROCCOLI AND CANNED MUSHROOMS INSTEAD OF OTHER VEGGIES. BUT STILL ADDED RED PEPPERS AND ONIONS AND GARLIC SAUTED IN THE BUTTER.YOU MIGHT WANT TO ADD A LITTLE MORE SEASONING OF YOUR CHOICE. AND SINCE EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY COOKED AND HOT, I SAW NO REASON FOR BAKING IT. JUST SPRINKLE THE ITALIAN CHEESE ON TOP AND IT'S READY TO GO.

I loved this recipe! I made a healthier version with 98% fat free cream of mushroom, fat-free cheese and butter, low fat parmeson(only 1/4 cup), Italian bread crumbs. I did not use the cooking sherry or the peas and I cut down on the water.

Very good.  Eveyone really liked it.  I did not add the water as some suggested and I felt it came out too dry.  Next time I will probably just use the whole can of chicken stock and some water (I made the 6 serving version.  I think I'll also add more onions and peppers.

This was a great recipe I must say. However, I am in the United Kingdom right now and had to tweak it to make it work with what I have available at the local Sainsbury's. Here is what I did: I didn't use any Worsches. Sauce or Sherry. Also, I left out the mushrooms and instead used a green and a yellow bell pepper. I only used about 1/3 C. of butter to cook the vegetables in. (It was plenty... however, if you use the mushrooms, you might need the 1/2 cup as the soak up more.)Also, I didn't have cheddar on hand so I used Red Leischester and it worked fine. In the end, it turned out well and only needed more salt and pepper. One final note, I did NOT like the taste of the parm. cheese on the top after it had baked in the oven. ..I'm not sure if it's just me, the cheese, or just the fact that it just shouldn't be on there.I won't use it on top again though. Blessings on your next cooking endeavor!

This was a very good reciepe.  I actually 1/2'd it because I noticed it made enough for 12.  It was very tasty.
Funny thing, I didn't have any speg. or ling. so I used bow ties...came out rather pretty.

This was an excellent dish!  I made a few changes.  I sauteed the mushrooms in butter then let them simmer in white wine.  I left out the green pepper, sherry, and onions (I HATE onions!!).  Added cream of chicken soup (since we like it more creamy), carrots and broccoli.  The only problem was I didn't make enough for leftovers!  This one is a keeper!  Thanks Doris!

First off, I thought the sauce in this was really good. I don't like turkey much, so only sampled the sauce, and don't know how it could be bad. However, my husband, who is not a picky eater, only gave it one star, though he did have a second big helping so go figure? Probably because I said I was going to feed it to the dogs, which in fact I did because even halfing the recipe, it was a LOT of food. So then we got in a big fight about it. But what's the point in taking up space in the fridge if it's not going to get eaten? At least the dogs were happy. But I would recommend trying it anyway. It made nice looking dish, and the sauce was awesome. Guess I should have put it in the freezer. Oh well.

this is a great recipe, very easy to change to your personal taste.  I've made this a few times w/out using the sherry, just added extra broth.  Freezes very well too.

I made this for a couple of friends and some children and they all loved it. I didn't add the green peppers or the water as suggested by some. The sauce thickened well but maybe next time will add about 1/3 cup water to help keep leftovers moist, not that there were too many, lol. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was very tasty.  I halved the recipe and left out the water.  I used canned mushrooms, red bell pepper, and frozen broccoli florets instead of peas.  I also added celery and black olives. I used a whole can of chicken broth because I didn't want to waste half of it, and I added a cup of milk.  I didn't have any cooking sherry, so I used 2 tbsp of white wine.  I also read several other  recipes and added 1/4 tsp of dry mustard and 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning, along with some Nature's Seasoning which is a blend of salt, pepper and other spices.  I used 2 cups of cheddar cheese, and I mixed the parmesan cheese and paprika into the sauce instead of sprinkling it on top. It was very colorful!

I had always loved this dish as a child and I was excited when I found such an easy recipe.

My fiance and I shopped for the ingredients and together we whipped up this yummy dish.

The recipe made PLENTY!  I had to stop myself from eating the whole darn pan =)

I used thin spaghetti noodles instead of the linquine pasta.  I did not add the mushrooms or the bell peppers and I substituted the cream of mushroom for cream of chicken.

I did not add the Worcestershire sauce or the Sherry.

I read the reviews before preparing this dish and took everyone's advice to leave out the water altogether and it turned out perfectly. Also used red wine in place of the sherry and thought the taste was not too strong. Everyone loved it and the kids didn't even notice the hidden vegetables!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight.  My picky eaters loved it!!!  The only thing I did different was to use egg noodles instead of the linguine.  It was a fantastic way to get rid of those turkey leftovers.

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I followed the advise of other reviews and halved the recipe, omitted the water, green peppers and peas, added a little extra broth and cheddar cheese and used a small can of mushrooms.  I also cut down on the amount of sherry because I didn't want it to overpower the recipe.  I used all dark turkey meat from three drumsticks. Can't wait to make this after Thanksgiving with left-over turkey!

This is an excellent recipe!  Of course, I rarely ever follow a recipe exactly unless I'm baking, but the general idea was really great.  I used all the water it called for and all the broth but I didn't use sherry or worstchire(sp) sauce.  I also replaced the cheddar with Velveeta.  It was the most creamy, excellent, wonderful tetrazinni I've ever had!  My whole family loves it, and it makes so much that they eat it for two days for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the late night snack.

A delicious dish!  I cut the recipe in half since the original recipe is for 12 servings.  I also substituted roasted red pepper in a jar for the green pepper.  I will definitely make this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly and I found that the dish came out rather sticky.  Actually, I'm  looking for a creamy Tetrazinni and this just wasn't the one. I will not be making this again. Sorry about that.

Wonderful taste but I agree with all of the other reviews.  CUT THE LIQUIDS IN HALF.  I'm wondering if the pasta was not to be cooked before hand and the amount of liquid she recommends would then be absorbed in the pasta.  It still had a fabulous taste and I used white wine instead of sherry and red pepper instead of green (looked festive with the green peas and red peppers).  Due try to this recipe because it is delicious but cut broth and liquid in half.

I thought it was quite good and tasty; pretty easy to put together for this rookie.
I substituted a can of cream of celery for the cream of mushroom and added a pinch of thyme.  The liquid could be reduced a bit.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  All four of us found it blah.  It need some kind of spice.
I will not be making this again.  I did freeze the remainder of the dinner and will serve it to my husband when I'm mad at him!!!!

I cut this recipe in half. I also took the advice of the previous listings and did not add any additional water. It was moist enough when I first made it. It was even better for leftovers. I would say it was good, but not great.

I cut the recipe in half . I also added no water as recommended in the other reviews.  I had regular cheddar cheese . I added the sherry before the mushroom soup to take off the alcohol using a 1/4 cup . I also did not use all the Parmesan called for but instead used a lite coating and added no salt.  It came about beautiful and was simple and colorful with an addition of multi-colored peppers. I added this one to the recipe box.  Anna H.

I used only one can of water and still thought it was watery.  I will try it again and leave out all the water.  But it was a pretty good way to use leftovers, and made a nice big amount for a pot-luck.

Delicious. Did add 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup.  But overall was really good & very easy to make the recipe your own according to your tastes.

There was no water listed in my recipe.  I didnt use peppers.  I also used chardonnay instead of cooking sherry and thin spaghetti instead of linguini.   I thought the cheddar was an odd choice of cheese; I might try shredded parm next time.  Needless to say BF ate two plates.   I cooked my chicken in the instant pot, cooled and then added to mixture.  I also used baby bella mushrooms.  It was very good!

This came out great and was a big hit. Cut recipe in half but used whole, large; green pepper and yellow onion and a little more than half the cheese. Used Monterey Jack cheese and frozen string beans instead of peas because that is what I had on hand. All other quantities were cut in half. This was really very good and an excellent dish to use up left over turkey.

This was delicious! I used shallots instead of onion & sweet red pepper rather than green (was what I had). I also added in a little poultry seasoning and garlic for extra flavour. It was a hit in my home and a great way to use up some of that leftover Christmas turkey! Will definitely make again !!

Definitely halve the recipe -- even adjusting it to feed 6 was a lot of food!  Followed all the directions except swapped white cooking wine for the sherry (pantry issues), and I didn't have a package of frozen peas, so I swapped a package of frozen mixed veggies.  Got close to "chicken pot pie" territory with that adjustment, but it was still delish!

I added crushed Ritz & White Cheddar Cheez-It crackers with melted butter for a topping. Overall a tasty casserole & a great way to use extra turkey. This makes a lot so be sure you have room in the freezer before you make it to freeze the left overs!

This wasn't too bad. I've made enough for myself and had no leftovers. Since I didn't have Worchestershire sauce on hand, I skipped the ingredient. It tasted well without it. I've used cooked chicken breast and would love to try it again with cooked turkey breast someday down the road.

I used brown rice pasta (fettuccini) and Pacific brand organic cream of mushroom soup to make it gluten free.  Also substituted chopped celery for the green pepper.  I skipped the peas and sherry because I didn't have them.  We loved it anyway.  I'll try it again WITH peas and sherry.

I've made this twice already (in the past month) because it was so delicious!  The second time, since we didn't have cream of mushroom soup, substituted sour cream and fresh mushrooms and it was still delicious.  Very rich flavor, a real hit!

My fiancee went crazy over this one!  I did alter it a bit through the help of other reviews. 1. cut the recipe in half. 2.  I omitted the broth (too much liquid). 3.  Added 1/2 cup of sour cream, teaspoon of garlic salt, kept the original amount of cheese and covered the dish with more parmesan cheese.  I promise I would make this more often!

I substituted the classic cream of mushroom soup with cream of mushroom soup with garlic.  This allows for an extra level of flavor without being overpowering.

I used white wine instead of sherry, and penne instead of spaghetti, and added a bit of dried mustard to the roux It was VERY bland. Needs lots more seasoning.

I halved it for 6 servings. I used angel hair pasta, reduced the sherry to about half than called for, and added about 1/2 cup milk to make it creamier. Delicious and a definite keeper!

This meal was great! All plates were cleared which says a lot for the 4 kids under 6 that were at the table. I omitted the bell pepper, used egg noodles in place of the fettuccine and topped with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. I also halved the recipe and used broth that I made with the leftover turkey carcass per Betty Crocker's directions. This will definitely be put into the dinner rotation.

9/25/16 I've made this many times but forget to review it. I prefer it without the bell peppers. Definitely don't forget the sherry and the peas! 7/30/18 Always a favorite! I use regular sherry, took the advice of another and use celery (not peppers), add tarragon, garlic, homemade mushroom soup (or the like), no added salt.  Wonderful...can't get enough of it.

This is good, filling, comfort food. Aside from omitting the mushrooms since we don't like them, and cutting the butter from 1/2c. (seriously? 1/2 c. of butter???) to 1 Tbsp. (just enough to saute the peppers and onions), I made this exactly as written. I had to put it into a 13x9 inch dish though, and it filled it completely. My family all enjoyed this, even my picky child ate it.

This was a great recipe for leftover Turkey.  I did alter the recipe quite a bit but only because i didn't have certain things on hand. I  used one cup of white wine and 2 cups of broth.  I didn't have any mushrooms so i used veggies on hand.  1/2 cup of frozen corn and 1/2 cup of frozen peas, diced celery and onions.  I then thought the dish lacked color so i added some diced green onions and sweet red roasted peppers along with a little parsley.  All of this was for  color but in the end it really added to the dish. Lastly, i used 2 tsp of worcheschire sauce and added one beaten egg to final mixture to bind dish together.  It seemed a bit loose and watery.  I topped with parmesean and bread crumbs. I realize i made a lot of changes and perhaps i should post my own recipe but really this recipe was the inspiration and like most cooking we have to improvise or change things to meet our family's taste buds.

I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed how overwhelming the sherry wine tasted.  I recommend using 1/2 of it or less.

Husband loved it, I did too.  I think the recipe would have been great as written, but I did make a few changes.  First, I cut the recipe in half.  I used dry sherry instead of cooking sherry because it is just plain better and instead of salt, I used Morton's Nature's Seasons Seasoning Blend (a seasoned salt which I think adds great flavor to many dishes instead of just regular salt).  Then, only because I didn't have some ingredients called for on hand, I used the following substitutes:  spaghetti instead of linguine, canned instead of fresh mushrooms (but I would always use fresh if I had them), red pepper instead of green, and a white cheddar with cranberries.  I used slightly more turkey than called for, filling a 2 cup measuring glass to the top,  Lastly I didn't measure the Parmesan cheese, but made sure that the top of the casserole was completely covered (so I'm guessing it was slightly more than what half of the recipe would have been since I used the same sized baking dish).   I'm adding this one to my favorites!   Also, Chardonnay, cheesy baking powder biscuits (or some other great bread), and a small side salad would be good accompaniments for this dish.

I've made this recipe twice now. Once with leftover Thanksgiving turkey and homemade turkey stock, and the second time with leftover chicken and store-bought chicken stock. With the turkey version I followed the recipe except to try bucatini noodles for the first time (which I loved). It turned out delicious, part of which I attribute to the homemade stock, which was very flavorful. The chicken version was also very good and got rave reviews from the family. I used linguine noodles as the recipe called for and made no other changes. I do feel that recipes like this benefit from homemade stock if you can do so ahead of time. All in all, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

As others did, I cut the recipe in half.  Here are my changes: used olive oil to sauté the vegetables, left out the bell pepper and peas. With the mushroom soup, used water and bouillon.
My family enjoyed it. Good use for leftover turkey.

This was delicious!  What a great way to use the Christmas turkey leftovers! I halved the recipe, my husband and I loved it!  As I read in other reviews, I used red pepper instead of green - made the dish more colorful.  I also added panko crumbs on the top just before baking.  I added hot sauce to the mixture - next time I'm adding more spicing - was good as is, but hubby and I like things a bit more zippy!

Well I thought I had screwed this one up when I discovered that my can of cream of chicken soup was cream of mushroom, but used it anyway and everything was really good. Like others I omitted the bell peppers and followed the rest as posted.
It was very good and I'll make it again....with the correct soup.

This was a very tasty recipe that I know I will make many more times. We liked it so much we shared some with our extended families and still had leftovers that we froze for another meal. And that was easy to do since this makes a huge amount, probably enough for 10-12 people! I didn't make any substitutions except for adding a few cloves of garlic and half a red pepper and half a green pepper instead of one while green and it was great! Definitely NOT lo-cal!!! I used Barilla pronto linguini that saved me 2 extra pans-- you gotta try all of their new pronto pastas!!! I also used my stainless steel pan to cook and transfer to the oven instead of transferring to a casserole dish. Thank you for the recipe -- I was so excited how good it tasted and turned out that I forgot to take a picture!! (Next time!)

I made this with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and it turned out awesome!  A couple differences... I used 16oz of rotini noodles instead because I didn't have spaghetti, I only had one can of cream of mushroom soup so I added a little half and half to it, also I had some leftover herbs from Thanksgiving to use up (fresh sage and thyme) so I added those in.  I also saw other tetrazzini recipes that called for panko breadcrumbs which sounded good so I sprinkled italian seasoned Panko crumbs on top of the parmesan at the end and dusted the paprika on top (mostly because I forgot to add it earlier).  Don't add the extra salt.  Parmesan is very salty so that should do the trick.  Also, even low sodium cream of mushroom and low sodium broth will add to the saltiness.  One watch out if you are using noodles other than spaghetti - it's bulkier and you might need more than one casserole dish to fit it.  All in all, this was super flavorful - helped to add a few herbs or italian seasoning to it!

Deleted green pepper, cut mushrooms to 1 cup. Used one cup 1/2 and 1/2 instead of condensed soup and thickened with 1/2 cup flour mixed into melted butter. Used 1 cup fresh, grated Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar. Split into two small casserole dishes and froze one before baking to be served later.

Great recipe!  I made it and put most in an 8 x 13" pan.  Had enough to put six more servings into another container.  Just served the large dish tonight to ten people and had leftovers  enough for four more servings.  We love turkey and this is a great way to stretch out the leftovers.  I used the new "pan size" spaghetti and it was perfect for tetrazzini.

We thought this was good, but not great. All I had on hand were whole wheat linguine noodles, so I know that probably played a role in it. it does make a lot, but we have no problem having leftovers to enjoy for a couple of days.

We enjoyed this dish. It was creamy and not soupy at all. I made it as written. I thought it was a tad salty, my husband liked it that way. I would make it again the next time I have leftover turkey. I don't understand why people give recipes a low rating when they didn't actually make the recipe as written. Stop the insanity! =p Seriously, stop it.  You didn't make the recipe. You made your own recipe and screwed it up.

I made this with one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken.  I also topped it with a healthy dose of bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and paprika.  It is now my go-to recipe for leftover turkey.

This dish is incredibly tasty.  The sherry adds a really nice touch, so I add a little more of it and less broth.  It tastes just as good after it has been frozen as when freshly made.

Kept right with the recipe, except I halved it.  You need to take note that the original is for 12 people.  I used leftover Rotisserie Chicken for mine and it was great!  Luckily the water had already been taken away from the recipe.  That's why so many comments talked about it being watery, so no need to cut back on any liquid anymore.  I loved the sherry flavor and I'm glad I stuck to the cream of mushroom, they mixed nicely.*****Made it again, but this time with Turkey breast leftovers.  Still good!!

Delicious, though 1 kid wouldn't eat it because of the vegetables.  It barely fit in my largest sauce pan so next time I'll add things like peas & sherry before the pasta to make it easier to mix.

Meh. I took the advice of some of the reviewers and used celery instead of bell pepper, and used white wine instead of sherry. I had planned on making my own cream of mushroom soup since once I did it I couldn't in good conscious use the canned stuff again. Well, turns out I didn't have enough mushrooms so ended up using Trader Joe's mushroom soup and I think that ruined it. It just wasn't that interesting. I won't be trying again.

This is a very good recipe.  It makes A LOT so be prepared for leftovers.  I used pene pasta and it was good.  It barely fit into my largest 9x13 casserole dish.  Reheats well.

Made this last night with leftover turkey. It was wonderful. Although next time I will probably not add the extra salt. It really didn't need it. I also didn't have green pepper, but had yellow. Didn't have sherry and used splash of red wine and red wine vinegar. Not sure how that effected the taste, but end result was great.

This dish was excellent.  My husband also loved it.  The sherry gives it great flavor.  The only changes I made were to attempt to make it a bit healthier - only used a quarter of the butter and then some olive oil, and used reduced sodium soup.  It does make a large amount, so good for a group, or cut in half.

Fabulous dish. Delicious, kid-friendly and easy to prepare. I used some of my own homemade mushroom soup instead of canned. It added some depth to the flavour. Wonderful one-dish meal. I will certainly make it again.

Very tasty!! I've made turkey tetrazzini for years and teas happy to come across a slightly different yet delicious alternative!! The only change I made was using yellow and orange peppers bc it was all I had (loved the peppers in it!) And I used cream of chicken instead of mushroom bc it was all I had- delish but I will try with the mushroom next time. Oh and two 7oz cans of mushroom. Love finding a recipe I didn't have to buy new groceries for!! Thank you!

Great basic recipe.  I used white wine instead of sherry (and much less than what it called for), and 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of celery.  Also substituted celery for the pepper, and used a bunch of shallots.  That's the beauty of this recipe... a great starter, you can tweak as you wish.

We liked this recipe, but it is pretty salty. I've added it to my recipe box but I will be cutting the salt out and I used boulion instead of stock. I will cut the amount to half the boulion for the amount of water in the future. I also halved the recipe after reading the reviews and we still had a bunch of leftovers. I thought this would be something my 2 year old would like since we are struggling with what he will and will not eat, but last night he decided this was something he would not eat... It was not the mushrooms because he picked those out to eat. I don't think it was the recipe. I think it was just last night. I will be trying it again. :)

Really liked this - mild flavor but very good. Only minor adjustments: did not use any butter. Used green onions instead of onions. Used roasted green chilis instead of green pepper. 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese instead of 1 cup. No peas or mushrooms (do not like those!) Mixed parmesan with about 1/2 cup or so of breadcrumbs. Otherwise, followed all instructions.

This is a delicious recipe that I made today so that I would have food for the next several days. We'll see if it lasts that long but as you have read in other reviews  each of us have done something different. As everyone else has confirmed don't add the 2 cans of water because it will be a very soupy. The chicken broth will make it a little soupy and willbe soaked up into the pasta. If you are watching the sodium intake in the recipe then you might not want to add the extra salt that is recommended because you are  using the cream soups. If you are accustomed to using cream soups you already know that there is quite a bit of salt. I did add extra pepper to this and instead of using bell peppers I used a tomato that I sautéed by itself with rosemary and dill. I may experiment next time with the bell pepper. The peas can be replaced with broccoli because  you already have a lot starches with the pasta. I didn't use the sherry as I don't keep any alcohol in the house with the exception of a rare wine. You can cut back quite a bit on the butter and or just use some olive oil. As suggested in  a previous review break the pasta in half and if you feel the need to then cut the recipe in half. It does make a lot. When you buy the fresh mushrooms (fresh is always best) a pund should do it. The cheese is not a have to unless  you absolutely love cheese and the parmessan should be shredded or fresh. If you like your food extremely hot and spicy add the some hot peppers. Bon apetit!

Very nice flavor. Worth the extra effort. There was a little too much liquid in the recipe as written; next time I will eliminate the 2 cans of water. Someone said to skip the sherry...don't do it. The sherry adds a nice extra depth of flavor. Big time kid pleaser too! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was a good dish.  I enjoyed it.  Next time, I will add some garlic and I will use red wine instead of white.  I did not have any red wine on hand.  Definitely, leave out the water.

This dish was really good!!  My 10 yr. old & 8yr. old were the true test and they wanted more.  I used cream of celery and omitted the bell pepper plus I cut the recipe in half and used a 8x8 baking dish. Great comfort food!

If I would have known this would be this good I wouldn't have only made a third of it!  I used cream of celery in place of the mushroom soup, omitted the onions and mushrooms, increased the peas, and added a bit of leftover cheddar cheese soup (undiluted) into it. Didn't add any water, added a bit more chicken broth. Didn't have parmesean so I used an Italian mix instead and sprinkiled it liberally. Made it in a deep dish pie/quiche pan and it was AWESOME!

My family and I thought this was sensational.  The recipe contains ingredients most average kitchens have on hand.  Prep was a little time-consuming, but worth it to me.

When my family hears new recipe they are afraid to come to the table, but tonight after trying this they were asking for more and there was none to be had. I calculated the recipe for 6 and I have 4 people in our family I was thinking there would be something left for lunch tommorrw but no. It did soak up the liquid though but still yummy.

I tried to make this a little bit healtier by using less butter, 2% cheddar cheese, omitted the sherry (didn't have any) & added more vegetables.  It turned out well & tons of leftovers.  Don't forget to change the serving amount... unless you are indeed feeding an army!

Following others suggestions, I left out the water but added a little extra chicken broth.  Left out the bell pepper and mushrooms, substitued Mexican 4-cheese for the cheddar and Italian 4-cheese for the paramsan.  This was out of necessity, not preference as I was tired after the holiday and did not want to go to the store.  It was golden and bubbly when it came out of the oven but the pasta quickly sucked up the liquid leaving it a little dry.  Even dry, this was fantastic.  I had it for lunch and dinner yesterday and breakfast this morning.  My husband has been out of town and due back any minutes so I am sure there won't be any left for me once he gets the first bite.  Great recipe!!

I had some turkey in the freezer I wanted to use.  We tried this recipe last night.  It was AWESOME.  I, too, put very little water in and used a can of chicken broth with roasted garlic.  This added so much flavor!  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was delicious!  I halved the recipe as others have done.  I used white wine in place of the sherry.  I used only a 1/4 can of water and used chicken seasoning in place of salt for more flavor.  Also, I used the red pepper in place of green for more color.

Everyone loved it. Made it a couple of hours ahead of time and put it in the fridge. When I came home in between the kids' athletic events to change, I threw it oven for about 45 min.  A real keeper. Thanks

Great recipe and would make again.  I halved the recipe added some extra mushrooms, used lowfat cream of mushroom, seasoned the chicken, used dry sherry (had on hand), put a bit extra cheese.  Would be a great recipe to make ahead of time and freeze.  I think I will use spaghetti noodles next time as that is what I'm used to with tetrazini.  I grew up on tetrazini this is just a fancier version of what I ate.

I thought this was decent, but a bit bland.  Make sure you like the taste of sherry (which I do) before adding it, because you can taste the flavor, especially in the leftovers.  We ate the remainder as leftovers, but will probably look for a different tetrazzini recipe next time.

WARNING -- This makes a HUGE amount.  I made it for dinner for my small family and will have leftovers for several nights.  Luckily there is enough moisture in it that leftovers heat up well and it doesn't become pasty.  If I make it again, I will cut it in half.  My son loved it, and he usually hates everything we like. I thought it was ok -- I won't rush to make it again.

This recipe was pretty good.  I took the suggestions other people said and only added one can of chicken broth because I didn't want it runny.  I also left out the peas and used Marsala wine instead of the Sherry.  Next time I will cut the butter in half.  I will make it again.

This was great! And it made a LOT! I used leftover turkey. I did double the cheddar cheese. I also used whole wheat wide egg noodles for the pasta, which worked really well. I added extra garlic powder and just a hint of cayenne to the mix, cuz it was a tad bland, to me. I used red pepper instead of green, and I think that worked really well.

I really liked this recipe after I made some changes.  I cut the recipe in half because it makes so much.  I left out the water and only used half of the broth (otherwise it is quite soupy).  I used frozen broccoli florets instead of bell pepper and I left out the worcestershire sauce.  I didn't have any sherry so I used a splash of red wine instead and I really liked the taste it added.  I had some mozzarella in the fridge so I used that combined with the cheddar.  I made this and froze it for my family to cook later and it was a big hit.  I will definitely make it again.

I liked this recipe, but will make some adjustments next time.  I didn't add the water either and thought it was plenty soupy.  I did use all the rest of the ingredients, but think I will leave the sherry out next time as I just didn't care for that taste in this. I won't use 1/2 c butter to cook the vegies next time, it just didn't need that much, also could maybe get by with less chicken broth, but I will have to see how soupy it seems. I still thought it was good and would make it again.

As I was cooking this, I thought that it would be too runny, so I left out the water, thank goodness.. it was very soupy.  Also, this made A TON of food.. I needed two 9x13 dishes.  I also would have added a lot more salt and pepper and TURKEY.

Yummy! I left out the mushrooms, but used Campbell's Golden Mushroom condensed soup. Also used Colby Jack cheese since my husband can't eat cheddar. Skipped the greased casserole dish and put my large shallow saucepan right in the oven, so I only had 2 dirty pans. Overall a great recipe which I look forard to making again. Thanks!

This was a little different than I thought it would be. You could hardly taste the chedder. I grated fresh parmesan cheese and it was so much better than the shaker variety. I also left out the water. My husband says he would eat it if it was made again.

I made this using leftover turkey. As nearly everyone suggested, I left out the water and scaled the recipe in half to six servings. The water would make it too runny and the full recipe would yield tons of food. It was pretty good, but a little bland. Next time I will try substituting celery for the peas and add red bell pepper.

used lots of suggestions from other reviewers and it turned out OK. Husband said it was kind of bland because I didn't put enough turkey in. I liked it but it was fairly ordinary.

My family enjoyed this recipe and asked that I definitely make it again.  I skipped the minced onion and green pepper and added onion salt to the butter instead.  I also skipped the sherry and Worcestershire sauce and added some Velveeta along with the shredded cheese to make it creamier and served it right from the stove instead of baking.  We shredded Parmesan cheese on it at the table.  This was a delicious way to use up leftover turkey.

This was pretty good. I didnt add water but i added a whole can of chicken broth. Left out the sherry and green pepper also. It was a little dry i was thinkin maybe it needed a little milk to make it creamy as it was not a creamy dish. I also used spaghetti noodles. I cut the recipe in half cause theres only 3 of us. I will definately make again, my husband loved it.

Mmmm---I actually left out the mushrooms, chicken broth AND water, used a little less cheese and peas than called for and didn't bake this, but rather just served it right off the stovetop!  It was great!!!  Easy and fast---wonderful.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the recipe:)

This was really good, and I could have made it better.  I didn't have Cheddar cheese so I used Mozzarella instead.  Also, next time I will use speghetti noodles. The linguini noodles were too thick.  I didn't add water like most reviewers recommended, but next time I will add about 1/2 a cup.  Overall, very tasty and my kids liked it a lot!.  Makes a huge batch!

Made this tonight with Turkey.  An amazing way to use up turkey leftovers.  Didn't have celery or bell peppers, but added a few green beans to compensate.  It is a definite keeper.  Thanks, Doris, for sharing.

I see a lot of possibilities.  How about tuna instead of chicken or turkey?  Bread crumbs added to the topping would make a more eye appealing dish.  Very economical and delious.

Like someone suggested, I only used 1 can of water but really shouldn't have used any at all.  The soup, sherry and broth really would have been enough liquid.  I used red bell pepper instead of green to give it a sweeter taste (grn peppers seem to be bitter sometimes).  I left out the cheddar and only sprinkled a little parmesan on top but I also added some fine bead crumbs and a sprinkle of parsley to give it color.  My husband loved it and asked to take some to his friend at work.  I liked it but would have preferred less liquid.  Will make again though.

I, also, did not include the water and it was still runny after cooking.  However, it does thicken as it stands.  I probably would not add the peas next time as their taste is a little too distinctive for turkey tetrazini.  Watch out for the salt, the soup is already salty - a little extra salt is all you need.
