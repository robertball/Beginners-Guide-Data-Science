This is the one my mom fixed. We packed it into a wax-paper lined angel food cake pan & after a few days pushed it out & peeled the paper off. Also, no serious chopping on the fruit. The larger pieces are prettier when sliced. It's like candy cake! Delicious!!

This did not set up for me at all, it just didn't have enough moisture. I actually did salvage the ingredients and made it into a cream cheese bar dessert.
