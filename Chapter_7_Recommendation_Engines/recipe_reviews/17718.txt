Really liked this recipe!  Moist with just the perfect amount of cranberries (I used craisins) Doubled the spices as suggested and also substituted 1/4 cup water for 1/4 cup OJ. I don't have a bread machine, so I dissolved the yeast in the warm water and let it sit, mixed together dry ingredients (EXCEPT 1 cup flour) added the butter (melted) and liquid stuff.  Then I mixed/kneaded in the last cup of flour.  Kneaded about 8 minutes (until elastic-y)and then let rise until it doubled (about 1hr), put in a greased loaf pan and let rise again (mine took about 40-50min to double) and then baked at 400F for 15 min and then reduced to 350F for 25 min (mine is an electric oven and somewhat goofy, so you might need to adjust the baking time)

This sounds great but I don't have a bread machine - will the recipe still work if I make it by hand?

Wow. This is the best bread I have ever eaten! I have had it every morning for breakfast, and now I'm making another loaf. It is even more wonderful if you add 1/2 of pecan pieces with the cranberries. I could eat nothing else but this bread for the rest of my life and be very happy.

I doubled the cranberries and the spices except for the cloves. I added a 1/2 cup of walnuts because it's all I had--it was great and 1 full cup would have been perfect.

Used Amelia's instructions for mixing without a bread machine.  Also doubled the spices- next time  I will not double the cloves- they were a bit overwhelming!  I had no craisins, so chopped up a cup of some frozen cranberries.  The bread baked into a lovely, soft loaf- perfect with a cup of tea for breakfast!

Yum!  I doubled the spices as suggested by other reviewers, and only had fresh (thawed) cranberries.  YUM!  Awesome hot, or toasted with a bit of agave nector drizzled on.

I tried this recipe over the weekend and was very impressed.  It made a nicely chewy, just sweet enough loaf although I will probably add more dried cranberries next time (a personal preference).  I strongly recommend soaking the dried cranberries to plump them before adding them to the dough.  Toasts nicely.

This recipe was very simple to put together, but I felt like it lacked spice.  Next time I make it, I think I'll double the cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  The cranberries were fabulous, though!

Great recipe.  I doulble the spices, with the exception of the cloves.  Made the bread in my kitchen-aid mixer.  Added a cup of chopped walnuts and 4 tsp. of wheat gluten.  Also followed the direction of another reviewer and baked at 400 degrees for 15 min. and then reduced to 350 degrees for 25 min.  I have been looking for this bread recipe.  Thank you for the post.

Easily one of the BEST breads i have ever had. Tastes just like if not better then the bread you buy at a bakery. I'm almost speechless. I am going to eat the whole loaf..in one sitting :) Doesn't get any better. Amazing texture, flavor, etc

My family loves this bread! I did not use bread flour, just unbleached all purpose flour and stone ground whole wheat. As suggested, I doubled the cinnamon, nutmeg, and craisens. Yummm

Made this loaf tonight for tomorrow's breakfast.  Easy to throw together in the bread machine.  Added some chopped almonds and doubled the spices.  Didn't have cloves so I added cake spice instead along with the cinnamon and nutmeg.  Baked up nice and high.  Oh, I also added some flax seed meal and hi maize flour to make it a bit healthier.

i followed some of the suggestions and doubled the cinammon and nutmeg (not the clove) and cranberries, and used the sweet bread setting. FINALLY i got a loaf from my machine that's actually GOOD! glad i tried this recipe because i was starting to give up on bread making.

A very nice bread but did make some changes so that it would work in my bread machine: I decreased the liquid to 3/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of orange juice a total of 1 cup liquid  and used all wheat flour otherwise it is too doughy for my machine, doubled all the spices like everyone else suggested.  My friend told me that I can send this bread her way anytime, she really liked it and so did I!

This is one of my favorite bread machine recipes.  I love it.  I enjoy a spicier bread so I double all the spices and add a 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of allspice  as well.  I have pre-soaked the cranberries as well as using them straight out of the bag and I like it both ways. 

I have had to reduce the liquid or temperature of the liquid to suit my climate, conditions, and bread machine.

Also, try this using this bread as a french toast -- awesome even without syrup or any other toppings.

This bread is fantastic!  Easy to make with the kids, and soooo good to eat.  I substitute the cranberries for raisins and up the cinnamon to 1 tlbs.  This recipe is also good with dried cherries or blueberries as well.

I used the fruit/nut setting (no sweet bread on mine) and it baked perfectly, no problems. I agree it needs more spice, but otherwise a nice bread.

This is a great recipe!  I actually ended up adding two more cups of bread flour because the dough was so sticky.  Doubled the spices as suggested, but omitted the cloves (personal taste).  It sounded so good I doubled the recipe.  I don't have a bread machine, but used my Kitchen Aid mixer with dough hook.  I then divided it into 4 small (half-size) pans and baked them for 35 mins. at 350.  The house smelled wonderful and the family loved it. We also discovered that it tastes great with a little leftover cream cheese frosting spread on it when warm.  I'll be making this again.

I thought this bread would be so good, esp. as I love cranberries. I couldn't have been more wrong.
My breadmaker doesn't have a Sweet Bread setting, but does have a Fruit/Nut setting. That is what I used, and it came out underbaked--had to finish it in the oven. The taste is not in the least remarkable. Like Liv-Pup said, "doughy".
I think if I were to make it again, I would use the normal setting of my breadmaker. The difference between the two is a matter of degrees, but enough to make a difference in this recipe. 
Will not try again.

Absolutely delicious loaf of bread!  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers, and doubled the spice amounts, plus I plumped the dried cranberries in water before adding to the dough.  I set my machine for a 1½-pound loaf on the Sweet Bread cycle, medium crust.  It turned out perfect, and as an added bonus, my house smelled wonderful.  This is a great bread to accompany a turkey dinner, toast for breakfast, and to give as a gift (I have done all three).

Wonderful!  I used half a cup of cranberries and half a cup of walnuts.  The house smelled so good!

Great flavor!!  I ran out of cranberries and used dried sweetened cherries instead.  I also added a little flax seed, wheat germ, vital wheat gluten and wheat bran to up the health factor.  Great!!  Will make again.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I recently bought a bread machine for myself and this was the first recipe I tried.  I double the Cinnamon & Nutmeg as others have suggested and it came out perfect!  I can't believe how easy this was.

Very yummy bread.  My bread machine didn't empty in the fruit when it was supposed to, so it was rather late when I added them myself.  So, they mostly ended up on the bottom of the loaf.  Otherwise, makes a great honey wheat bread.  I'll definitely make sure the fruit gets mixed in properly next time.

There is nothing negative to say about this bread.  Tasty, easy,great!  I actually ate this bread with a cranberry chicken salad recipe from this website and it was terrific.

This bread is AMAZING! i put all the ingredients in my breadmachine and put it on dough setting. When it was done, i took it out and formed into the shape of a loaf and placed on a pan sprayed with cooking spray and floured and baked it at 350 degrees for 32 minutes! The result is an amazingly textured, soft bread with a hint of spice! I LOVE IT!

Based on the positive reviews, I tried this for Easter dinner yesterday. It was fabulous!  A nice, dense, moist bread, similar in texture to beer bread. The flavors went perfectly with ham and scalloped potatoes. By accident, we discovered that it is marvelous dipped in a dressing made of equal parts blasamic vinegar,oil and maple syrup. The recipe was requested, and I will certainly be making this again and again!

Very tasty and made a nicely shaped loaf.  I left out the ground cloves since I didn't have them on hand, and it still tasted great.  I'll be making this again.

Made this recipe twice.  First time, very heavy and doughy, threw away most of it.  Second time, still somewhat doughy, will not be making again.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly except also added sunflower seeds.  I thought the clove would be too harsh tasting and I thought the bread would be too sweet with all that honey, but, boy, I was wrong! This bread is delicious as cinnamon toast!

I didn’t use bread machine. Proofed my yeast in the water as I prepared the dry ingredients. I added finely chopped walnuts & doubled cinnamon & nutmeg - it’s a big hit with friends & family. Next time I’ll add pistachios instead walnuts. It’s a good basic recipe

I've been making this bread for years. I usually use 1 1/2 cups of dried cranberries, but this does cause the bread to fall a bit. Regardless, everyone loves it.

This bread reminded me 100% of the texture and flavor of  "bagel bars". I made it in my Hamilton Beach bread machine. As suggested in some reviews I doubled the dried cranberries to 2 cups,  and doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg. I also added the zest of a large tangerine. I didn't add any nuts this time. I'm not sure if I mis-measured the water,  but I needed to add at least 1/3 cup more flour to make a dough ball that formed properly. Also, next time I will use the 2 pound loaf setting and medium "crust setting".The bread needed at least 10 more minutes of cooking and the top crust was very pale this first time cooking the recipe at the 1.5 pound loaf setting and light crust. This recipe is perfect for creating your own "signature flavor of bread" by adding dried fruits, nuts and flavors of your choice. We toasted it and spread it with butter. Cream cheese would be an excellent alternative to butter.

I loved it. I kept the water as water and doubled the spices as suggested. I’ve already been requested to make more. I also don’t have a bread machine so I did it manually with a kitchen aide.

I used coconut oil instead of butter. My bread machine tends to make the bread too dense with too crispy of a crust, so by adding a bit more liquid than dry (I added one tablespoon more of oil), I was able to make it soft. Great recipe-- I'd add walnut to it next time and double the spices as others suggest.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everybody raved!  I added a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg than called for.  The result was a perfect, slightly dense and very moist loaf of bread...this recipe is a keeper!

I just made this bread and used dried tart cherries and instead of nutmeg and cloves (since I discovered I was out), used pie spice and it was the best bread I have ever tasted...Thanks for the recipe..

My bread machine broke on me halfway through the first knead, so I had to do some extra work...still, this bread was worth it!  I opted to sub some OJ in and it turned out to be a good choice, adding a wonderful balance to the tangy cranberries.  Even my 3-year-old kept wanting more, which is high praise.  I'm sure it would have turned out even better if my machine had survived.
