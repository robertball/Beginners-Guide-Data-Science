Al, I joined my recipes to specifically write a review of your cocktail sauce.  I have tried making a handfull of highly rated cocktail sauce recipes I found all over the net, but I MUST say that I preferred yours the most.  It tastes great and is EXTREMELY easy to make!  To boot it only has 4 ingredients, which everyone will most likely have on hand.  The exception is the fresh horseradish.  So, I used about 1.25 - 1.5 teaspoons of prepared white horseradish which suited my tastes just fine.  Great job, keep em coming!

Wow! I will never buy bottled cocktail sauce again!  I used creamy horseradish since I didn't have any fresh and it turned out great!

Very nice!  I like the horseradish flavor that still give JUST enough bite!  I also recommend using Beaver Brand Horseradish.  I tried this a second time with HOT horseradish (Beaver Brand) and it was even better!  Thanks Super Al!!!

Simply the best! Like other reviewers, I am the only one who eats cocktail sauce so I was always buying a jar and throwing away most of it. I will forever make this recipe, exactly as written and having the simple ingredients on hand makes it so simple and much cheaper.  Thanks Al!

This is indeed the best cocktail sauce recipe!  It's the brown sugar that really ties the flavors together.  I used chili sauce in place of the ketchup as I like the chunkiness.  Thank you so much, for the recipe, Al...and good-bye to store-bought cocktail sauce forever!

I was browsing recipes for valentines day because i was going to make my boyfriend shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. I thought it would be nice to make the cocktail sauce from scratch... I was wrong.  I only added one of the two tablespoons of the horseradish and it overpowered the sauce way too much. I didn't even let him try it, it went right in the garbage.  This may be a good recipe for some but not for us.

Perfect with Ina Garten's oven roasted shrimp from foodnetwork.com.  Peeled shrimp, some olive oil, salt, and pepper in a 400 oven for 10 minutes.  Easy peasy 1, 2, 3sy!

Love it! This couldn't have been easier to make. Doubt that we'll every buy it again! With only 4 ingredients it couldn't be simpler. (We needed to make it as a last minute addition and only had prepared horseradish and bottled lemon juice  - but it was still excellent.)   Thanks Al.

Way better than any store bought Cocktail Sauce. I did do 1/2 ketchup and half Chili Sauce to give it some extra zip! Also added a little Worcester Sauce.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it was delicious! 

The fresh horseradish was super strong though so next time I will start with a little less as you never know how strong the root will be.

I make my own cocktail sauce all the time and use the same ingredients except for the brown sugar. Never thought of adding brown sugar and it was excellent. Now I will always make this recipe. Thanks!

ive compareda lot of these cocktail sauce recipes. this one is by far the most simple and acurate. i work at chilis and we make our own cockatil sauce every day there (for our fried and grilled shrimp) but all we do is 6 Tbs ketchup, 2 Tbs of horseradish, a 1/2 tsp of lime juice. all these extra ingredients are pointless. its best just the simple way. less is more. theres a reason chilis likes it the original way and so do all the customers. but like i said, of all the coctail sauce recipes on this site, this ones the best. the brown sugar isnt a must have, but im sure its really good

Love that it only has four ingredients.  I gave a five since I consider any recipe to be more a guide than gospel and I only changed based on what I had on hand.  Anyway, this is the BEST cocktail sauce!!  I used 1/2 cup ketchup, 1 pkt True Lemon, 3 tsp prepared horseradish and 1 tsp sugar.  Unfortunatly I used the last of my brown sugar in some muffins so I used white.  Hard to imagine this any better but it might with the brown.  Also, raw horseradish is different than prepared, so if using prepared start at 1 tsp and add more to taste.

Absolutely awesome - clean, astringent, full-flavored.  As noted in other reviews, that little bit of brown sugar is what makes this recipe turn the corner.  Again, as noted elsewhere, all I had on hand was (good quality) prepared horseradish (grated horseradish/vinegar NOT horseradish cream or salad dressing)  I used a scant two table spoons and probably 1/4 teaspoon lemon (cut a lemon into wedges, used 1 wedge to flavor the sauce).  I will never, ever, ever, buy the bottled stuff again.  First class!

Yum! I used about a whole tsp of fresh lemon juice instead of 1/8 to suffice my personal preference. I will surely make this again. Thank you.

This is great.  I didn't use raw horseradish, but I used hot creamy horseradish from a jar.  I only used about 1 tsp (2 tsp if doubling recipe).  The brown sugar offsets the spiciness very nicely.  I doubled the recipe to make enough for a 16 oz. bag of shrimp for shrimp cocktail.  Yum!

This is the best cocktail sauce ever. The only thing I add is a generous shaking of Tobasco sauce. I will never buy from the store again!

Didn't have cocktail sauce.  Found this recipe but didn't have horseradish.  Added some spicy mustard and a little more lemon juice.  Turned out just as I hoped!

Very good and simple.  I added a sprinkle of minced onion and minced garlic, and a dash of black pepper and a dash of cayenne.  To me, it's a nice base to customize to whatever your taste is.

Excellent Cocktail Sauce Al!! How come we can't follow you around and see what else your cooking? I wouldn't change anything on this as it is great just the way it is. However, I am a liquid smoke freak and a half teaspoon (Colgin brand) made all the difference. Thanks for sharing Al!

I added worsteshire, onion powder, and hot sauce and it was really good but a bit sweet for me.  Next time I'll try reducing the amount of brown sugar or using crushed tomatoes instead of ketchup.

Very good and so simple to make.  I used lemon juice out of the bottle and it still turned out great!  LOVE IT!  Never made it before.  Just a note...when you buy horseradish in the store...make sure you buy it nice and white, no brown spots.  :)  I will be saving this recipe and making it again very soon!

Awesome! I am always having to doctor up the store bought versions and this is great. Finally, something I don't end up throwing in the trash.  A dash or two of worstershire is good too.

Like others, I also didn't have fresh horseradish on hand, so I used prepared horseradish.  I like my horseradish HOT- the longer the burn the better!.  I use either Beaver or Inglehoffer Hot brands.  I used 2 tsp and it was only moderately tangy.  If you like really hot cocktail sauce, I'd use a full tablespoon.

I made this sauce and one other for New Years Eve, and this simple sauce won by a mile for my shrimp cocktails!  My son LOVED it, along with my guests, and couldn't get enough!  Has a great kick!  I have already printed this one to keep in my personal cookbook.

We loved this cocktail sauce. Since my brown sugar was a little "chunky" I added it to the lemon juice first. I strained the mixture through a small mesh strainer and the chunks were left behind.

Are you serious??? This is an amazing easy recipe. I too used extra hot creamed horseradish and Heinz Ketchup- I agree with OC Cook with the Heinz. It's the only good ketchup around. Anyway, this is so perfect. I didn't change anything about it other than the horseradish- only because I never have it fresh.  Will definitely make again and again. Thanks for sharing AL! Awesome!

Oh wow...what an amazing cocktail sauce. I am never going to buy store bought again! I was looking for something to dunk with jumbo tigerprawns, you know maybe like a keg style, and boy did I find it. I did use Woodman's original creamed horseradish, but waht flavors! The brown suguar adds a nice rich flavor in there. I suggest everyone try this!

I'll never buy this from the grocery again!  I always have these items around (I used prepared horseradish, per other reviewers suggestions).  Extra good with deep fried shrimp.

I realized I was out of store bought cocktail sauce so I needed a recipe with ingredients I hoped to have on hand.  This recipe was perfect for a quick fix.  The extra horseradish gives it a spicy kick.  I added 1/2 tsp of lemon juice instead of the 1/8 tsp to give a hint more of a lemon flavor which compliments seafood!  It's so easy and inexpensive to make that I will make my own from now on!

I use creamy horseradish sauce and chili sauce.  to one bottle of chili sauce, I add one or two tablespoons of horseradish sauce.  Then taste and adjust recipe to your tastes.  I just put in the horseradish sauce till it gives me a little kick.

I don't ever buy cocktail sauce so when I made shrimp one night I went looking for an easy sauce I hoped everyone would like. The ingredients are ones you have in the house. It's easy and the kids even like it.

excellent sauce, fresh horseradish makes all the difference but if you don't have any I would decrease the amount as the stuff in the jar may be hotter.

This is a delicious recipe.  I've been using it for a while and I won't buy store bought cocktail sauce.  I have added more/or used less horseradish depending in who will be eating it...I like alittle more kick.

So easy and as good as or better than premade sauces. We've substituted white wine vinegar for the fresh lemon juice when we didn't have lemons.

Tastes really good, but it's a pain to shred the ginger and more expensive to make than buying it already made.  As long as you can find a good store bought cocktail sauce that is... I use Crosse and Blackwell.

WOW!  I will never buy cocktail sauce again.  I didn't have fresh horseradish only had Heinz horseradish sauce.  I followed the recipe and did add a lil more of the Heinz HR sauce to taste.  OMG!  I will use this on my fried chicken breast or even grilled and for onion rings just like I did at Burger king (crispy Chicken sandwhich). The sauce tasted like a better version of Burger kings Zesty sauce for onion rings.  Thank you very much for sharing.

Great flavor, and I will not buy the grocery store kind again.  However, I used "fresh prepared horseradish" (the kind in the jar that you get refridgerated section) instead of fresh grated.  I think that 2 tablespoons of the kind I used is too much: 1 would be enough.  That's the only change I would make to make this perfect! Thanks Al! :)

This is great!  I made as instructed, but cut the recipe in half as I am the only one who eats it. The fact that I can make a small amount means I won't have to throw away old store sauce ever again!  This is a keeper. Thanks!

This was EXACTLY what I was looking for.  A sauce with a slight hint of sweetness and enough horseradish to give it "bite".  WE LOVED THIS!!  I'll never buy cocktail sauce again.

I forgot to buy the cocktail sauce for the shrimp I was bringing to a  New Years Eve party.  I remembered this recipe and thought I would give it a try.  I didn't have fresh horseradish or lemon so I used cream style horseradish & bottled lemon juice.  I can honestly say that it was better than anything I've ever bought and was a great hit at the party!

Excellent base recipe. I prefer slightly more lemon juice and less brown sugar. Horseradish amount called for was right on. Made this last night to go with low country boil. It was a big hit!

Today, in South Florida, I was able to buy 2 dozen Apalachicola oysters for $16. I'm one of those "wastes cocktail sauce from the store, and really dislikes the taste anyhow" kind of people. So, tried this recipe...and O M G!! Hubby and I demolished them all with the help of this deceptively simple, but oh-so-perfect cocktail sauce! Totally sold. Will never buy store-bought again. My only caution is that if you don't use fresh horseradish (cuz I didn't have any on-hand), be SURE the stuff you have is as spicy as you like it. I'm going to be more careful about the horseradish I use next time...but this Sauce is THE BOMB!!!!!

OMG!  How can something so simple be so good?  The funny thing is - I don't really care for cocktail sauce.  But this was yummy.  I didn't have any lemon, so I added a couple drops of lemon extract.  Move over tater sauce! :)

If you like a thicker sauce use tomato paste with a little water in it.

It was a good tasting sauce, but it DEFINITELY needed more ketchup. I would do at least 3/4 cup ketchup. Also, when i stored it in the fridge, it turned into a jell-o-like substance. very weird. the brown sugar maybe? sorry, but i won't be making this again

Wonderful.  I used fresh horseradish root because it was on sale but I think next time I'll just stick with the jarred variety.  It had a wonderful flavor but wasn't that spicy.

simply said: just delicious!  i live overseas where shrimp is abundant but not the sauce. and to bring glass bottles of cocktail sauce back from the states is just too much work. this really is simple to make and tastes exactly like the bottled sauces, actually better than the store bought!!!

This was wonderful on top of Connie's Zucchini 'Crab' Cakes from this site. And it was easy as can be! My only modification was using ~2 teaspoons prepared horseradish sauce instead of the fresh stuff.

I needed something quick when I ran out of steam to make something fancy with shrimp I already cooked.  I whipped this up (I had all the stuff on hand - bonus!), and added the shrimp, chopped.  I served it over a block of cream cheese with crackers and people loved it.  Good recipe to have on hand.

Perfect! Super simple and tastes just like store-bought. The only thing I did differently was using horseradish sandwich spread. It's all I had, but it still tasted great.

I've made this recipe a number of times.  Since I don't keep fresh horseradish around, I've found that regular jarred or creamy horseradish do just fine.  Awsome flavor from such a simple recipe.  Better than any I've been able to buy at the store.  In my opinion, for the best flavor, I only use Heinz ketchup.

This recipe was awesome.  I didn't measure anything and just winged it.  I'm sure I was close except for that I know I put in a little extra lemon juice and extra brown sugar.  And I tossed in a dash of Worcestershire on the last batch which gave it a little extra flavor.  DON'T substitute dried horseradish powder for raw or jarred horseradish.  It doesn't turn out the same.  In fact, it doesn't turn out at all.

very yummy - we were looking for an easy cocktail sauce where we didn't have to run to the store and this was the winner - i put in more lemon juice, but otherwise made as directed.

An excellent, traditional cocktail sauce.  It has more horseradish bite than most store bought sauces and is less sweet.  This is a definate improvement in my book!

I've been making this for many years! So much better than store bought and cheap to make. You can add a little grated onion too.

I served this at an anniversary party and everyone couldn't believe that I made it they said it was so good.  I made a large batch for 50 and I used fresh horseradish out of my dad's garden.  I only used 2/3 of the amount of horseradish recommended in the recipe and it was spicy enough.

I used cream-style horseradish instead of fresh and golden brown sugar instead of dark but it was still "super"!

Can this get any easier?  This was great and I made it in like a minute.  I didnt add the brown sugar because I feel ketchup has enough sugar as it is, it didnt need anymore.  I love this!!

Thank you Al! This is the best Cocktail sauce I've ever had! I did not have fresh horse radish so I used prepared and I did add a few splashes of Tobasco sauce because we love hot stuff. I tasted it before I added the Tobasco and it was perfect then!

I have been making this recipe for years and just realized I never rated it.  I no longer buy cocktail sauce.  I just keep the ingredients in the fridge at all times.  I substitute prepared horseradish and lemon juice for the fresh.  One nice thing is that you can vary the horseradish by the tastes of the people eating it (and your mood).  Another is you only make as much as you need.

I found this recipe to be too sweet and not spicy enough. It may be because I used prepared horseradish, (it tasted better when I added an extra tbsp to the sauce). It also might be because I didn't chill it in the fridge for long enough, maybe it takes some time for the flavors to blend together. I will keep trying.

I've made this cocktail sauce for years, and don't remember where I got the recipe...and I agree...I just made some tonight...it's great!!  Never buy store bought--once you've had this you'll never go back!  At this point I don't measure but can tell by the color and taste if it's right, and then adjust the seasonings.  The only thing I add that's different is fresh ground black pepper.  By the way...this is excellent on raw oysters.

Very good! I didn't have any horseradish sauce but I did have a packet of horsey sauce from Arby's, so I just used that! It was really good! It'll probably be even better with real horseradish! Thanks for the simple recipe Al!

It's really good. As i'm mixing I thought there was too much horse radish, and actually ended up putting more in after tasting.
 Very quick and easy, thanks for sharing.

Loved the flavor. Like other reviewers I used Beaver hot cream horseradish because its what I had. One tablespoon was enough for our taste. I'll never buy cocktail sauce from the store again.

Very good. No reason to buy this in the store. I used hot horseradish that I had in the fridge and only added a fourth of what the recipe calls for and it was hot. Everybody loved it, will make again.

I have no idea why it never occurred to me to make this from scratch rather than buying it at the store, but I'm happy that I've finally come to my senses. I used one tablespoon of the prepared horseradish, and doubled the lemon juice to 1/4 teaspoon.  OMG... soooo good.  I did a blind taste test with hubs... this vs. the store bought, and Al's won by a landslide. You'll never be able to eat the bottled stuff once you taste this. Super duper recipe... thanks AL!

I was in a hurry, almost bought store cocktail sauce, but after reading all the chemical ingredients decided not to. Found this on allrecipes, had the items listed, just made up a batch. Excellent!  Thanks for posting this Al!

I thought this was the best cocktail sauce.  Nothing needed.  Used store bought horseradish.  My husband who is extremely picky about cocktail sauce, said "that's it. Save that receipe!!"  We have had steamed shrimp three nights in a row

Quick, simple and easy. We didn't have bottled on hand and had all the ingredients to make this so gave it a try. I didn't really measure and did cut back since I didn't need so much. I probably added extra ketchup but at first it seemed strong. But that's what's great about this recipe. Make it to your own tastes!

I found myself out of cocktail sauce one evening just before dinner.  Found Al's recipe and used prepared horseradish from a jar and otherwise made it just as Al said to.  EVERYONE loved it!  I'll never buy ready made again.  Thanks Al!

Delicious!!  We followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  I don't think we'll bother buying cocktail sauce again since this is so easy and tastes wonderful.  I do think we'll need to adjust the horseradish to make it a little more child friendly though, it was a little spicy for my 6 year old.

I keep a bottle of lemon juice from concentrate in the fridge. I've had it forever. Anyway, that and creamy radish from a bottle and the rest made this delicious sauce just as good all the reviews said. I will never buy one of those silly little jars of cocktail sauce again.

Excellent! I made this for a rescue because I needed it for fried fish and my husband could not find it in the store.  I did not use fresh horseradish, (Beaver Bottled), light brown sugar, lemon from a bottle and Heinz Ketchup. I will never buy it from the store again.

I did not have raw horseradish, however,  I did have bottled.  This recipe was quick, easy and full of flavor.  I will not use store purchased cocktail sauce again, especially at home.  I like spicy so I added a little more horseradish.

This is a nice basic recipe for cocktail sauce and because it only has four ingredients it is very easy to adjust to suit your personal taste.

Super delicious and easy to make!  I used jarred horseradish, about 1/4 c, and it turned out great.

I agree, you can't go wrong with this sauce. Easy to make and stores well in a freezer for future parties. I made a huge batch, froze a bunch and used at a second party. It was better the second time around.

Crazy good! And so simple! Previously, my husband only liked 1 brand of jar sauce-- and then my local market stopped carrying it. I tried every other market in my area, but no luck-- so I decided to try to make my own.  But even better than that, I made Al's :)   I confess that I reduced the amount of horseradish b/c hubby doesn't love the kick as much as I do-- so I reduced it for him, divided the batch in half, and then added more to mine :)    Thanks Al-- I need never buy cocktail sauce again!

I have made this twice now.  The first time I bought a horseradish root and minced it as fine as I could- I didn't like the results.  I was able to find  horseradish made by BoarsHead that was just finely diced and it made all the difference in the world.  This is a great recipe and very flavorful.

This beats the cocktail sauce I get in some of those fish houses!  I used the fresh grated horseradish and fresh squeezed lemon.  The best ingredients make the best food.

Fantastic!  I'm in Sweden temporarily and you can't buy the typical "cocktail sauce" here, so I was forced to give it a try.  I actually bought Heinz Chili Sauce instead of using ketchup and it turned out fantastic!  Chili sauce is very similar to ketchup here, and if you can find it in the US gives it a much better start than ketchup.

This is the best recipe I've found for cocktail sauce, but I felt it is still missing something.  I will continue to make this recipe instead of buying sauce, but will still look for what is missing.

This recipe is the perfect basic cocktail sauce recipe. It taste like fresh store bought sauce, its absolutely delicious. You can do anything to it to make it your own. I used creamy style horseradish, which tasted amazing. I also added fresh ground pepper and red pepper flakes to make it spicier. It is awesome if you can a small amount of chopped fresh basil, parsley or even cilantro for a little something extra. I will definitely never buy cocktail sauce again.

AWESOME!  I can't even imagine buying bottled sauce again.  It is just the right balance of spicy, sweet, and tangy.  And it just doesn't get any easier than stirring the ingredients in a bowl and chilling.

i love shrimp and always run out of cocktail sauce and HATE running to the store for it. this was such an easy recipe and it is so good! AND you can customize to make it a bit spicier by adding more horseradish or more lemony or whatnot. i always have ketchup around so the only thing i had to get was horseradish (not frequently used).

This recipe was very easy and tasted just like the cocktail sauce you get in a restaurant. I will make this one anytime I need cocktail sauce instead of buying some at the store.

It’s got good flavor with the ingredients listed. I added Worcestershire sauce and Siracha. I had creamed horse radish and used half the amount listed. It was still too much.

Very tasty sauce, but I did not use fresh horseradish.  I doubled the recipe, and only added 1 T of the jarred horseradish....plenty spicy for us!

I made this recipe and the only thing I would change is the horseradish. I would use less and add more lemon juice. It was a bit spicy for my taste buds. Other than that, it was great.

I go heavy with the horseradish and lemon. Sometimes with a dash of chipotle powder, gives it a kick.

Perfect recipe just the way it is! Great that I can make my own at home that tastes as good or better than store bought. But if you don’t have horseradish on hand (like I didn’t the 2nd time I did this recipe)....I was able to use 3 tbsp of ginger paste plus a teaspoon of a very strongly flavored mustard (mine was a garlic aioli) and it came out delish!

I changed the recipe slightly since I am diabetic. I used 1 cup of reduced sugar ketchup, 1/3 cup horseradish and 1/4 teaspoon of lemon juice. I completely omitted the brown sugar. Very tasty!!

Great recipe!  I revised servings to three and reduced amount of horseradish to two tablespoons.  Very easy!  Will not be buying jarred cocktail sauce ever again.

Great recipe! You can play with it and adjust to your personal taste if you need to.  We like it as is. I had to make without brown sugar once and that was tasty too!  Will never by store bought again...way less sodium this way too!

Really flavorful. I used a tad more lemon juice and reduced the brown sugar to about a rounded tsp. I thought the brown sugar tied the sauce together.

I used Farmer's all natural horseradish (minimal ingredients) because I had it at home and couldn't find fresh when I needed it. I added a little extra for more kick - it's really yummy!
I definitely  will make it again. Way better than store bought.

A really nice sauce.  Is easily customizable for all levels of heat.  I like that I have the ingredients on hand (well.........except for horseradish.................i had to buy that).  Even those "picky" eaters who "dont like anything" thought this was good.

I have used this recipe for years and found it never disappointing. THe ONLY modification, if you will, is using Washabi  Horseradish (the green kind in the tube) in place of the raw grated horseradish. The REAL testament is that I would not eat ketchup or horseradish singularly, but combined together in this recipe, I usually eat it with my finger. while I'm making it!! Similarly, I don't eat mayo or sour cream yet when combined together in my incredible Bleu Cheese dressing... it's to die for! 

Enjoy.

I feel very repetitious after reading other reviews, but I have to say, this is the best cocktail sauce I have ever tasted, and I have tried many, many cocktail/seafood sauces!  As per the ngative reviews, I believe those individuals simply do not like "heat".   No more store bought for me!  Thanks Super Al!

Exactly what I've been searching for... simple, quick, and delicious. First time I've ever bought and shredded fresh horseradish and it was definitely worth it.  I may tweak the recipe next time just to try some different flavors, but the original is perfect.

Oh my goodness!!! LOVED this sauce! It is so easy to make, and tastes so much better than store bought. Plus, as others mentioned, you can taylor it to your tastes. I needed a sauce for shrimp cocktail, and just on a whim, looked to All Recipes. Found Al's sauce, and made 1 batch "just to make sure". The next time, I tripled it!!! I also used Beaver horseradish as we really like all the other Beaver condiments. This is so easy and so good, please try it!!!

Ahmazing!  And so easy to temper if you suffer from "wussy-tongue," as my kids  would say.  After making this numerous times, we now just eyeball the ingredients and taste until it has the right amount of zing.  Too zingy, add more ketchup.  Not enough zing?  You'll know what to add more of!  My son and I whipped a bit of this up last night and devoured a pound of shrimp between us in minutes...thank you Super Al (you certainly are!).

Cut recipe in half and it was excellent.   Bought more shrimp today so I can make it again.  I did add celery seed/celery (personal preference)  The recipe is excellent as written.  I also will be NOT be buying store bought cocktail sauce again, this was so easy and good!

I didn't go by the exact amount of the ingredients. Used same ingredients. Prepare to suit your taste. My husband and I agree,  this is the best tasting seafood sauce we've ever tasted.

I also used creamy horseradish sauce.  I will try it with the raw when I'm able to get some.  This is VERY good!  No need to buy premade cocktail sauce again.

I love cocktail sauce and make this without the brown sugar. It is still delicious. I put it on tilapia too.

This is good as is, but I like mine more spicy so I added 2 more tablespoons of tomato ketchup (1/2 cup total) and a teaspoon of Texas Pete.  That made just it right for me.  Next time I am going to try a teaspoon of red wine or cider vinegar.  Thanks for giving me a base to work with.

This is a good recipe,but we've always made our own sauce and we also add about 2 to 3 tsp Worcestershire sauce and chili sauce for extra kick. Don't think we have ever bought prepared cocktail sauce. Such an easy thing to make.  Don't know why people waste money paying for it when you usually always have these items on hand anyways.

Very good cocktail sauce, used for a party and it was sweet but I wish it was horseradishier, It was almost too sweet, but thats likely because I didn't use raw horseradish but the organic shredded stuff.

I have always made my own cocktail sauce, but felt like something was missing. This recipe has the missing ingredient. The brown sugar keeps it from tasting too acidic, simple, easy, loved it!

Tried this okay.  Made it per recipe and found it a little weak.  Then I doctored it up a bit.  Added 1 more Tablespoon of horseradish, 2 Tablespoons Worcestershire.  This made it just like I get in the store.  Someone said it was way o hot, must have a very sensitive pallet.

Fantastic!  I was out of cocktail sauce and needed some NO, so this is the perfect recipe for that!  I realized that I have been paying too much $$ for what I've had in my fridge all along!  I did use the jarred horseradish and it is great!  Thanks for such a simple, delicious recipe!  Bye, Bye store bought sauce!  :-)

This was great! I was skeptical but this really is better than store bought which always expires before I can finish it.  Made it exactly as written using the jarred horseradish.  Will make this regularly! Thank you.

I did not have horseradish so I substituted that with about a tablespoon of A1 steak sauce and about a 1/4 teaspoon of ceyanne pepper.  It runed out great. My boyfriend loved it, as did I. I will definitely be making this again for our shrimp and other finger foods.

Made this for a shrimp boil and everyone raved about it!  Followed the recipe exactly and the only thing we'd do different next time is add a bit more horseradish for more of a bite, but that is a personal preference.

Fantastic recipe.  Sometimes I kick it up a little by adding a tbs of tequila like the tequila cocktail sauce recipe from this site as well.  Depends if I have some in the house and who my crowd is.

What an amazing little cocktail sauce! Absolutely delicious---the tang of the lemon and the sweetness of the brown sugar really give it that "something extra." This is my new go-to cocktail sauce, and what I will serve with our cocktail shrimp at dinner tonight :). Thanks for the recipe!

I did have fresh horseradish but I think the jarred stuff that some people used might actually be better in this for textural reasons and because you MUST make this! So if the only reason you don't is because of the horseradish don't worry.

Wow! I just made this on a whim thinking I might want some shrimp and this is amazing. The perfect cocktail sauce. I definitely don't need to buy store bought again. Like others I didn't have fresh horseradish on hand so I used the kind in a jar. Wonderful! I highly recommend this recipe.

I am usually not a fan of cocktail sauce, but this was great!  I substituted prepared horseradish for fresh and it worked fine.  This recipe was so simple and much yummier than bottled cocktail sauces!  I served it with shrimp, and I should have made a double batch of cocktail sauce because I ran out before the shrimp were gone!

Like many others I never even thought of making my own cocktail sauce, I've always loved the can version.

I made your recipe Al and let me tell you it's amazing, simple and ten times better than any canned version I have bought over the years!!

I even made some with popcorn shrimp and brought it in for my friends at work and they were amazed!!

LOVE IT!

Very good sauce, but really spicy!  I used bottled horseradish and maybe that made the difference.  Next time, I will use half of the horseradish and go from there.  Thanks for the recipe.

Slamming!!! will never buy another cocktail sauce again.  For a little bit more bite, I used three tablespoons of hot horseradish instead of two.  And it made just enough for me, my husband's allergic to shrimp so more for me!

Perfect cocktail sauce.  I love that the recipe is for a small portion.  I used creamed horseradish and a tad more lemon juice. I bet it is even better with the fresh grated radish.  It was great on the fried shrimp and also great on the french fries.

Easy, inexpensive and spicy tasting. You can't go wrong with this cocktail sauce. I have tried it with chicken nuggets and onion rings. Yummy!
