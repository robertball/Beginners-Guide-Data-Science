My friends and I have a weekly dinner party and i tried this recipe on them.  Everyone absolutly loved it!  It got rave reviews (20 thumbs up!).  In the version I mace I left out the peperoni (we have a large percentage of vegitarians) and added fresh garlic and italian seasonings, thanks for the great idea!

These are relatively easy, but a bit time consuming (as most finger foods are).  I used my mandolin to cut the potato (only used one--we have some huge potatoes!).  For me, it would have been easier to coat the potato slices in oil in a bowl.  I thought about doing that, but didn't, and I ended up using way to much oil (didn't measure, just poured from bottle).  I used olive oil instead of regular oil.  Make sure you use large potato slices, or these won't work with the oven times.  I didn't think the smaller slices I had would be big enough, but I baked them anyway.  They made nice potato chips, at any rate.  I was distracted while making these and forgot to cut up any veggies, so I just topped with sauce, cheese, and a slice of pepperoni.  They are good, but messy, so I wouldn't serve anywhere that people are afraid to get dirty.  Bf said they were wierd.  I like the idea but I'm not sure that I'd make them again.

These were easy to make and very good.  Took them to a Superbowl party and everyone loved them.  I didn't put any pepperoni on them as there were some vegetarians there.  I used mushrooms, red onion, red pepper and olives.  Will definately make again!

These were decent, but strange. I found myself preferring the ones with less topping. They were also messy. I don't think I'd make them again.

My family loved these! They were fast, easy and cost very little to make. We used just sauce, pepperoni and cheese as the toppings and they were delicious!

These are so great. You really need to use a good pizza sauce. I used Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site. I topped mine with sauce, pepperoni and then cheese. Delicious! For the people that said they are messy... let them cool down for a few minutes.

I really liked these but yes it does get messy as the cheese doesn't really stay onto the potatoes but I think with smaller potatoes that make bite size pieces would be really good. I used toppings I normally like and spicy portuguese chourico sausage instead of pepperoni. Very interesting way to make potatoes, and the re-heated left overs were even more tender! Thanks!

This was GREAT!  I made a caesar salad along with this for a quick meal.  Going to try some additional toppings next time to shake things up a little.  The entire family loved these!  THANKS!

These were pretty good. I used canned sliced potatoes, and I was afraid the extra water content would ruin the texture. Truth is, fresh potatoes would have been better, but these were good too! The best were the little tiny ones, which were crispy.

I decided to cut my potatoes lengthwise instead of in rounds. This made them easier to prepare. I eliminated the pepperoni to cut the cholesterol a bit and used crumbled spicy vege sausage in it's place. I used button mushrooms which are small so I only needed to slice them instead of chopping and since no one in my household likes green pepper, I used sundried tomato strips (jarred in oil) and baby broccoli florets  and fresh basil leaves (cut in chiffonade)as my vegetable. I used mozzarella cheese, but made sure to buy the finely shredded one so that it spread evenly and easily and melted quickly in the oven. Oh and because I am sodium sensitive, I used 8 oz of a no added salt tomato sauce to which I added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp dried basil, 1/4 tsp dried oregano and 1/4 tsp onion powder.

I really enjoyed this recipe but felt the potato bases were a little bland. I lightly boiled the potatoes first so they were fluffy. I topped with pasta sauce, mushroom, onion and salami. I seasoned with rosemary but feel Italian herbs would have been a better choice. I chose to dip my potatoes into oil before placing on the tray which saves oil. 

Great recipe, I cooked three large potatoes for myself and the husband and we were stuffed! Will make again but next time I will probably spice the bases with all season next time.

Also, I found putting a small pile of mozzarella on top helped, mine were not messy at all!

I used leftover baked potatoes for this. I sliced the baked potato then topped with sauce, pepperoni and cheese... baked them in the toaster oven until everything was heated through and cheese was melted. Great snack!

I decided to try this because I had a ton of potatoes and pizza sauce to use up. I didn't expect it to be very good but I was so pleasantly surprised! I eat gluten free so I'm always on the lookout for dough alternatives. This sounded like someone's attempt to make something for a person with allergies...which usually doesn't turn out well...but this was great. I'd recommend cutting the potatoes a little bit thicker, otherwise they fall apart. Fast, easy, and yummy! Much easier than making dough at home, and I'd say just as good!

The adults loved these, the kids didn't. Maybe I will use different toppings next time. Not difficult to make but a little time consuming. I think they are worth it.

This was a wonderful change.  I would have never thought to do this with potato slices.  I didn't use onion or bell pepper (personal preference.)  It is kind of messing, but aren't all the good "finger" foods...=)

This was a great idea. I have to admit, I didn't follow the recipe exactly though..i rarely do. I didn't have any bell peppers, mushrooms, or onions but i did have everything else. I added some seasonings, too. My husband loved them so much i ended up having to make more of them later that night! Even my three year old son who is a VERY picky eatter loved ate several of them. This recipe was fantastic and has so many possiblities...Thanks!  Maybe next time I could do a mexican twist..using hot sauce, cheddar, with a jalapenos.

As soon as i say this recipe, I knew I had to try it.  I was not disappointed.
