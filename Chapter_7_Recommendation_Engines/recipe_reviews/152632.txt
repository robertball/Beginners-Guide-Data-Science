This is amazing.  Every time I make it I get asked for the recipe.  I use a combination of lowfat and regular cream cheese, which works fine.  I also use melted semisweet chocolate chips instead of the bakers chocolate, because I always have them on hand.

Definitely a cheesecake for chocolate lovers!  A big hit with my girlfriends. I goofed and put the 20 oreos into the batter..it still came out fine but took a little longer to bake. A few observations, When you quarter the cookies, they fall apart, don't worry. If you leave the ingred out at room temp for an hour before, you avoid cracking. Run your knife around the edge immediately after it comes out of oven. Definitely will make this again and everyone wanted the recipe.

I love this recipe and have made it a few times.  Anything that incorporates Oreo chocolate creams gets my vote.  This cheesecake is creamy AND dreamy!  I like layering a mixture of sour cream, sugar, & almond extract on top of the cheesecake for that extra umph.  As if this pie needed anymore, ha!

I have made quite a few cheesecakes, and this was definitely one of the easiest and best tasting recipies I've tried!  Excellent, excellent!  Super chocolately, creamy (with crunch from the quartered cookies), and great presentation.  It didn't even crack!

I have made this cheesecake for my co-workers on many occasions. There is never any left when our meals are over. It is worth making again. It is always a hit.

Pretty good stuff right here. :)  Taken as is, the cheese cake has a nice dense texture. But for those who prefer a "fluffier" cheesecake, I added about 1/3 to 1/2 cup sour cream.  It took longer to bake, I think about 20-30 mins extra, but it still turned out great. The outer part of the cake was a ever so slightly over cooked. Maybe that could be remedied by lowering the temperature a lil bit???  Let me know!

Absolutely delicious and super easy to make. The only change I made to the recipe is making a crust from thoses pre-crushed oreo crumbs in a box. I also used a whole box of oreos for the filling, Mmmmmm! Would definitely make again.

This is definitely for the chocolate lover who loves a very rich dessert.    I didn’t bother with a water bath but did leave it in the oven with the door cracked open for about an hour after baking.  The texture was smooth and creamy and didn’t crack.  It was heavy to me but my family absolutely loved this.

Very good, but holy mackerel it's rich. :-o I wouldn't hesitate to make this again, but I wouldn't recommend this as a weeknight dessert for two. That's what I did and we ended up throwing away the leftovers because we could only manage a few bites at a time! Perfect for gatherings though and has a smooth, creamy chocolate flavor.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Mine tasted great although cracked and was a little rough around the edges after I ran the knife around.  Will do without that part next time and see how it goes.  I got lots of compliments on it though!

I have only made one cheesecake before this one, and it was pretty easy to make.  It also turned out great!  No complaints here!
