This is great, it just works better on the stovetop, with no need to marinate.  Brown your meat (good with pork chops too) with the butter or use a little olive oil. Add the soy mixture (we add 2 tsp of minced garlic also), cook uncovered on med high turning occasionally.  It will thicken into a wonderful dark glaze and makes the meat tender and succulent!

Made this with skinless Chicken Legs (drumsticks)last night.  The trick was cooking in a low oven (325 degrees) for a long time...3 hrs. or so.  I bet it would work as well in a slow cooker.  The meat literally fell off the bones!  It was so delicious!  My family went nuts over them!  I can't wait to make these again, although I think I'll use low sodium soy sauce next time.  Fabulous!

Pretty good! Very tender and flavorful. If you like the "sweet & sour" kind of taste, you'll like it. Not too sweet, though, which is good. I loved the soy sauce added. I thought it was very yummy.

I've been making this recipe for years for parties and always get MANY compliments on it. It's a not "too sweet/not too spicy" recipe & good for a crowd.  I use about 6 lbs of chicken drumettes and then double the recipe.  I also bake at 375 for about 1 hour 45 minutes making sure to baste, and then let the pan sit for a few minutes after removing from the oven, this seems to thicken the sauce a little more - but this is not a thick sauce - it's more of a sticky marinade just coating the wings.  And then I just let the wings sit on paper towels when serving...Rave reviews every time!

I thought this recipe was pretty good!  I prepared it today and enjoyed every tasty bite.  The chicken was nice and juicy.  Of course, I did allow it to rest for about 15 minutes, so that those juices will remain in the chicken.  

My only change was that I did not use the marinade that the chicken was soaking in while in the refrigerator for 2 hours.  I have read that you are not supposed to reuse the marinade that your chicken soaks in.  I reserved some of the marinade to cook with and poured that over the chicken while cooking.

It was not too sweet and I will try this recipe again.  It went great with the green beans and brown rice that I prepared.

Oh YUM!  Tried them as per the recipe as well as another time deep frying for crispier wings as we  prefer them.  But both ways were EXCELLENT!!!  The butter makes all the difference.  Don't skimp on calories by omitting the butter!

These were tasty and a nice change from traditional Buffalo wings. They were fall-off-the-bone tender. Thanks for this recipe.

I add ground ginger to give it some zip and I delete the water from the recipe.  When cooking the wings, I place them on a broiler pan (the type that comes with your oven when you purchase it) and place water in the pan under the broiler.  This helps steam the wings.  Just before serving, I slather the wings with the sauce and continue to baste for about 30 minutes.  This results in sticky wings instead of plain wings with a thin marinade.  We serve these with celery sticks and homemade blue cheese dressing.  They are great for tailgate parties or any other party.  I prepare the recipe times four and freeze the leftovers.

This sauce is really yummy! I did add a cornstarch slurry to thicken it slightly. I am going to try roasting vegetables in this, the buttery flavor should be great with them.

I made this recipe today and it was fantastic. I did alter the recipe a little bit because I ended up making them like my friend from thailand makes hers. I add all the ingredients and 4 more tablespoons of dry mustard, 1/2 lime juice, and 1/2 cup ketchup. I did marinated it for 2 hours then put the pan in the oven for 45 minutes. Turned out great!! Thanks Shang!!

these were amazing i tried it the way Kristi B said and did it on the stov top ... browned the wings good first in a stick of butter.. removed them - added brown sugar, soy sauce, minced garlic, ground ginger ... pineapple juice (instead of water) ... and the can of chunks .. brought that to a boil and added the wings back in - i didnt really measure anything .. just used eye measurements . the sauce is thick and yummy - going to make wild rice with it .. cant wait for dinner !!!

Excellent taste, still felt I could have added some herbs for a little more flavor but haven't decided what yet. My husband thought they were perfect. I cooked mine a little different. Per advice of a previous reviewer I tried it stove-top. Sauteed a few onions in the butter, added the chicken to brown, threw in the rest of the ingredients minus the water because the chicken juices replaced it. Simmered about 1/2 hour to flavor the chicken and just before serving, I added 2 tsp. of cornstarch mixed with about a Tbsp. of cold water. Sauce thickened up just enough after about a minute and they were delish!!! Thank you for this recipe!!!! P.S. Would defiantly still be good with low sodium soy sauce but OK without if you like salt. :-)

DELICIOUS!  Followed recipe to the "t" with the exception of adding a 1' X1" piece of freshly grated ginger to the sauce mix and I opted for boneless thighs cut into 2 peices.  Will I make these bad boys again??  OH YEA!!  Finger licking good!!

Love them!  But I add some garlic powder and cook them a little longer then an 45 min (more like 75 minutes if they are the scrawny wings and an hour and a half if they they are the big juicey types).  The glaze will really get gooey and sticky.  They also remind me of the wings my friends mom used to make for us in high school.  Same flavors and everything.  Thanks for posting.

Great flavor - my teenaged son really likes this recipe.  Cooked half in the oven, and the rest in the crock pot the next day.  He preferred the oven baked wings as the others got too soft/mushy.

These wings were less than average.  The sauce was not thick enough and was not very tasty.  My family only ate a few and I am sad to say the rest was trashed.  Will not make again.

Quick & easy! I forgot to disjoint the wings, but they still turned out fine. I baked them as noted but also broiled them for a few minutes afterwards to make them crispy. Next time, I'll add garlic powder for extra flavoring.

Made this for a family get-together.  When my daughter-in-law asked for the recipe, I knew they were on my recipe box list.  I marinated them overnight and baked them 1 hr before the family arrived.  Delicous!!!!!!!!! I'm making them again for our SuperBowl Party.

These were really good. I was slightly traumatized by the disjointing process, so I may not be judging these clearly. My husband thought they were good. I only had time to marinate them for 30 minutes, but after that, I rubbed the wings with minced garlic cloves, salt, and pepper, so they weren't bland at all.

I tried this recipe last night, it was great! At first I thought I had made a mistake by fixing it, because I tasted the sauce while it was still in the pot cooking and it tasted a mess. I made a little change and added another 1/4 of a cup of brown sugar. When everything was cooked and we sat down to dinner the wings were great. Thanks

Made these for Super Bowl. They were good. We like our wings crispy, so I put them under the broiler at the end. I also had cooked them an additional 20 minutes.Will make again.

Great for the grill! If you marinate the wings for 24-36 hours, you do not have to baste. This is now a family favorite.

These are great! I marinated them overnight,
then baked. I ran them under the broiler to
firm up the sauce...yummy! These will be one of my Superbowl wing varieties!

These wings are wonderful. Very easy to make. I followed the recipe PLUS,  I added some minced garlic. I have now made this 3 times and my hubby wants them again. Great!

I changed the recipe quite a bit but loved the flavor.  I used 1/2c. hoisin sauce and 1/2c. soy sauce.  I cut back the brown sugar to about 1/2 c.  I also added about a teas. Cayenne pepper because we like a little more spice.  I also added 2 tbsp shredded fresh ginger.  I omitted the water.  Baked them with a little flour and cayenne pepper about 1hr and put in the crockpot with the sauce.  Cooked on low about 4 hours.  They melted in our mouths!

Really good flavor, but I used one of the reviewers ideas to make the sauce less saucy, so that the flavor clings better.

I overall was not too satisfied with this recipe. The sauce was too thin and a little too sweet. I hardly let food go to waste in this house but I didn't even both saving any leftovers on this one.

Using this ingredient list, I prepared these differently as it was a last-minute meal.  Instead of marinating, I baked the unseasoned wing segments on a wire rack over a baking pan (to keep them from sitting in their juices) while letting the sauce ingredients simmer on the stove.  While simmering, I got creative and added two whole peeled garlic cloves,  2 Tablespoonfuls of chopped green onion, and about a third of a cup of orange juice concentrate. With about 20-minutes of baking time left on the wings, I brushed them with a coat of the sauce, then came back 10 minutes later and just dunked the wings into the sauce, then finished them off in the oven.  Since the sauce was never used as a marinade, and it thickened up after simmering for 40 minutes, I drizzled it all over my steamed rice and broccoli and dipped my wings in it while eating. I WILL make this again and will most likely prepare it this way again.  YUM!

This recipe originally came from the Los Angeles Times cookbook, which I have had for over 30 years & that's how long I've been making these gems. If you have a crowd or potluck, this is your go to recipe. I double the recipe because you can't stop eating them.

I marinated my chicken wings for 7-8 hours and cooked them in the air fryer.  They were absolutely DELICIOUS!!  Just the right amount of “sweet” from the brown sugar.  No dipping sauce needed!

I think next time I would try this in the pan on the stove. I like a sticky wing and these were a touch watery for my liking. I did add a little garlic for flavor.

Oh man, thought I'd lost this recipe! But I found it again under this name on AllRecipes. It's great - wouldn't change a thing. I put my wings in 2 pans and bake them for 2 hours, turning at the one-hour mark. Take them out of the juice before they cool, or all the brown stickiness melts off and drains away!

This recipe was very good. I cooked them in the oven as suggested and then grilled them for an additional 10 minutes to crisp them up. The only thing I would add is some ginger.

Tasty and very easy!  I love recipes that call for ingredients that I always have, so ill be making this again. Note:  this is a sticky type chicken wing, so if you like a drier kind, you may not go for this. Great to make in large bathes for parties or guests too.  Some people fry their wings first for crispness but I found this recipe didn't really need that extra step, which saves a ton of clean up time

I made this not long ago & reviewed it, but my review disappeared.  :/  I'm good with soy-based, brown sugar wings; but I was expecting more with the addition of mustard powder.  I added more & more, but it didn't do much - & it wasn't old.  'Think I'll skip this one.

I followed the recipe as written but increased the quantity to accommodate a large gathering. Instead of baking the wings I cooked them on the grill. They were fantastic and everyone enjoyed them, even the ones that were a little charred due to flare ups. If you grill them be sure to drain well and cook on low, indirect heat. Also, next time I will reduce the amount of marinade as there was too much left over.
