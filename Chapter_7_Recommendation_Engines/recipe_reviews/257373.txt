I loved this recipe  and already want to make it again! The sauce is the bomb too! The only one thing I will change next time is that I will brown them on each side prior to adding the water. Just a matter of personal preference when it comes down to it. I will be going to the Asian market again soon to get more wrappers just so I can have these in my freezer at all times. Thanks for sharing!

This is the first time I've ever made pot stickers and I thought they turned out amazing!  I used soy crumbles instead of pork (vegetarian) and they tasted great.  The recipe makes a ton of filling so make sure you have extra goyza wrappers. I thought the sauce was too vinegary so we used teriyaki instead and it tasted great.  Overall I thought it was a fun and delicious recipe to make.

I substituted 2 tbl of teriyaki sauce for 2 tbl of the rice wine vinegar.  That seemed to please everybody!  I double the recipe and basted the chicken a couple min. before taking off the grill and served the rest at the table.  KEEPER!!!This is a 'flavor town' recipe.
