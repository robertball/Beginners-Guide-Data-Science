After reading the other posts, I was NOT going to sacrifice my pans for a 'decent' dish.  SO, I sprayed it with cooking spray, then let everything get nice and toasty.  It worked fine and I didn't lose my favorite saute pan.  The next time I made it, I revamped the entire recipe by adding fresh garlic and onion and a small squirt of lemon juice to 'carmelize everything instead of blacken everything.  That just tasted better for us.  Thanks for the jumpstart!

I was a little scared to try this but I am glad I did! This was very tasty.  I will warn you, your pan will be very dirty! But here is a great tip...

Put some dish soap in the pan and a few inches of hot water.  Boil on the stove top and the burnt on spices with just lift off.  You may need to scrape the pan a few times as well.

I added lemon pepper by accident, and it was pretty good.  I would think you can pretty much add any favorite seasoning to suit your family.  I liked the slightly "burned" or grilled flavor too.  I added about a tablespoon of white wine right before I turned the heat off to help get all the bits off the bottom of the pan; that helped with clean-up too!   I also soaked the pan over night and had no problem getting it clean.

I make these beans a lot! My husband doesn't eat green beans any other way. I add fresh garlic to the beans instead of powder. I also add a splash of Balsamic Vinegar on occassion. We really love these!

I was inspired to try this because my mother makes a similar dish.  The difference being the green beans are sauteed in freshly chopped onions and olive oil.  The garlic was a nice addition.  We prefer the flavor of the fresh onions but will now add garlic as well.  Thanks for sharing.

I cut the oil dramatically, like to a splash.  I sooo wanted to add it while the beans were "burning" but restrained myself.  The taste was good, but it did take a while to get to the "burn" stage.  Nobody commented on if they liked or disliked them, so I'll hang with a 3.  Thanks Shearyah.

I made it exactly as instructed and it was outstanding!  I was skeptical when I first read it, but this is now going to be my standard method for cooking green beans!

Excellent!! My mother-in-law cooks hers with hot Italian Sausage - an old Italian recipe - and it is fantastic.  This is healthier and very good too.  I sauted in the olive oil for a few minutes before turning off the heat, and added fresh minced garlic.

I normally don't eat green beans but i need something quick to make last night because i had an extra person coming over, I found this recipe and had the items not exactly the one's i need so i had to improvise.  I used butter instead of oil, and I used can green beans. I also added a little ground mustard and I have to say I loved them. They didnt even taste like green beans, and i'm not a fan of green beans but i will definatly cook these again.

I cut the oil a bit and added some bacon grease. I love the flavor the bacon grease adds to the beans!

These were pretty good!  I did add some chopped onions, just because I like onions, also added 2 tablespoons of sherry for a little extra flavor.

Tasty side dish, but I cut way back on the olive oil or it would have been a little too greasy for our tastes.

This is the fried green beans recipe I've been searching for! The beans still have a slight bite to them. And the aroma that fills the kitchen is amazing!

I used fresh garlic and minced onion instead of garlic/onion powder. I just followed with the recipe, sauteing the onion and garlic in the EVOO instead of the spices, then adding the beans. We liked this okay--my husband thought it was a bit greasy and I had to agree with him.

We loved this recipe.  it ended up to be slmost the same as the green beans we get at chinese places around our home. I do recommend using less olive oil on the recipe as mine ended up slightly oily.

Well first off I'll say I completely messed up this recipe. I skimmed it and then while I was cooking it I forgot about the whole burning thing. The flavor is very nice though. I drizzled my beans with olive oil then added the spices, cooked covered until they were tender. I did get some burned bits but not many. A few of the beans did get caramelized and they were very good too. Sorry! But they were tasty  anyway.

This recipe made me want more green beans, instead of HAVING to eat them!  I used only a splash (1 T.) of olive oil, it was plenty.  I will make these often.

Takes too much attention to make this dish.  The beans were not tender enough when made this way and I didn't want to risk continuing to "burn" them.  Finally had to microwave them to be edible.  Also, agree, don't like burning my pan,  it is still soaking!

My picky father even loves this dish and he's just a meat and potato type of guy, we used fresh ingredient, instead of powdered but still great tasting!

I (actually my mother) made this for me for a family gathering and got lots of compliments.  I used frozen green beens and minced garlic.

My husband & I really love this recipe.  I use a cast iron pan with a glass lid.  I also spray with nonstick cook spray.  Added zuchinni & mushrooms the 2nd time I made it.  Also, this fits our restricted diets!  Thanks!

My husband liked the flavor, but I didn't care for the "charred" taste.  I may need to sand-blast my pan to remove the burnt-on mess; I don't think that soaking the pan overnight has helped much!

This dish went over wonderfully at Thanksgiving with my boyfriend and his mother.  With some careful ingredient selection, it fit requirements of low carb and organic food!

FANTASTIC!! I omitted the onion powder and went with coarser grained salt & pepper.  I also decreased the oil some, but they were phenomenal! I made it two days in a row and will definitely make it again.

These were great!  Instead of olive oil I used garic oil that I have, and they were awesome.  So easy too!

After the positive reviews I'm not sure what went wrong here.  Was there supposed to be oil in the pan?  I just ended up with a smoky mess.  If someone can fill me in on what went wrong please do, this sounded like such a good recipe!  I'd love to be able to change the rating.

Excellent recipe!  I omitted the garlic and onion.  I gave it a splash of soy sauce near the end, and sprinkled some sesame seeds after plating.

I was looking for a different way to have green beans and these were delicious! I followed other reviewers suggestions and sprayed the ceramic lined non-stick pan lightly with PAM. These cooked up quickly. When I added in the olive oil, I didn't measure anything, I added approximately 1 1/2- 2 teaspoons of lemon olive oil. This gave a subtle lemon flavor. Liking that flavor, I decided to add fresh lemon zest from half of a small lemon along with the juice at the very end.  The juice was quickly absorbed by the hot green beans. The flavor was delicious! The entire pan was quickly gobbled up and we were left looking for more. Great post! Will definitely be making these again. Thank you so much for a different take on green beans.

what a delicious twist for green beans.  My husband and I both loved them.  We just put a little more garlic in recipe. Will definitely do again.

My family never gobbles up green beans. It just doesn’t happen here. 

Made these...they were the perfect combination of crispy, flavorful and savory. Not one piece left.

It takes a while to get the char but it's a good recipe.  I used Italian dressing instead of oil.

I didn't realize at first what all the fuss was about, until I decided to let the beans sit for longer after adding the oil to really let the flavors mingle. WOW... it was hard to stop eating this! Definitely the best green beans I've ever had.

I changed up this recipe and combined some of the ideas from the other reviews. I sauted onions and garlic in a little olive oil, then added the fresh greenbeans. When the green bean were just about done, I added a can of sliced carrots. It came out really good, everyone liked it. From reading the directions from the original recipeI could understand why pans were getting ruined.

I didn't care for the charred look and taste; by the time I got the beans done enough to eat the spices were black and tasted like charcoal.  Maybe the trick is in the timing, you don't really have times to do each phase just kind of a guestimate.  Plus my pan is pretty bad and I don't think it will come clean.

The whole thing tasted quite burned to us, although only the spices were, and I cooked it just long enough to get the green beans done enough to eat. I certainly didn't think it was worth the time scrubbing the pan. Thanks for something different, anyway.
