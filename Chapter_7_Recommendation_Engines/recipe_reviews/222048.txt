This was exactly what I was looking for! I made it a few hours in advance and let it chill, covered in the fridge. I added the goat cheese as I plated it. Served it with grilled chicken and it was the perfect side dish. My kids even went back for seconds. Will definitely add to the summer dinner rotation!

This salad was really pretty and tasted fabulous.  I used fresh beets, instead of canned.  And I didn't have enough raspberry jam so augmented it with strawberry. I doubled the salad but not the dressing. The result was a salad with lots of color and a variety of complimentary flavors. It was a hit.

Very good, the flavors  blend so good together. I used raw beets diced. I will definitely make this again.

Very good blend of flavors. I didn't have canned beets, so shredded peeled fresh beets with a coarse blade, covered with cold water, brought to a boil, drained, dumped in ice water, drained again. Used chopped chestnut and canned  wax beans-because that's what was on hand. Cannot improve on the dressing, and I will no doubt use it on other salads as well. Might try blanching the broccoli next time as well.
This would be a beautiful and very different addition to a Potlatch.
