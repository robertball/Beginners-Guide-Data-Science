Agreed that this may not be the prettiest looking dip (it kinda took on a pink color), but boy the taste makes up for that!  My brother-in-law couldn't tell me enough how much he liked it, and took what little was left home ;)  I sprinkled chopped pepperoni over the top, and served with a cut up french baguette.  Good dip, thanks Sara!

I threw the ingredients for this in my little crockpot as kind of a last ditch clean out the fridge before the new year kind of deal (and sort of a "snack-y" kind of day, really). The only thing I did NOT add was the sour cream because I needed the sour cream I had for dinner tonight. I used my own homemade pizza sauce. This smells great so far--I'll update my review once we've had a chance to taste it. NOTE: They devoured it.

This dip was very good.  I didn't use bell peppers and added chopped up pepperoni.  Served with garlic bread too.  No need to use the oven - this can be heated up in the microwave.  Reheats great too!

Pretty good dip. Used the leftover garlic bread we made for dinner with this as well as butter crackers.  Tasty stuff.  I reduced the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp and added some chopped green bell peppers and a few slices of pepperoni to taste.  Like others, just mixed it all together instead of layering.  Similar to "pepperoni dip," also found on this site. Thanks Sara.

I hosted a "Dip Party" last night and this was voted the winner. After reading the reviews, I decided not to mix everything together, as a lot of people said the color was off-putting. So I mixed the cream cheese, sour cream, garlic, red pepper flakes, and cheddar, then the pizza sauce, then pepperoni, then mozzarella cheese (left out the green onions and red bell pepper since I didn't know if everyone would like them) and baked it until bubbly and served it with toasted french bread. It was wonderful!

This was really tasty.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  Makes A LOT!!!  Next time I think I will make it in a little crock pot which will also help keep it warm and gooey.

This is just okay. It was a little bland for me. If I was to make it again I would add more red pepper flakes and maybe a pepperoni flavored sauce. I would also use my mixer to combine everything so that I did not have any lumps of cream cheese, and it took longer to bake than the recipe said. They said 5 minutes and it really took more like 15 minutes.

I am giving this 4 stars because everyone that tried it really liked it, but personally I'd give it three with the potential of more with some tweaking.  It does take on a horrible color, so I sprinkled mozzarella cheese and some pepperoni bits on top.  It definitely needs more than 5 minutes in the oven.  I'm not sure what the function of the green onions is--I probably won't use those next time.  I also might try layering the ingredients next time--putting the cream cheese and sour cream on the bottom, then the sauces, then the cheese, etc to see how that works.

I made this for the first time Sunday to bring to my 4-year-old grandson's birthday party. I left out the crushed red peppers because of the small children. Cut the recipe in half and it still made quite a bit.  I didn't have green onion, so finely chopped some yellow onion.  I used 2 1/2 small cloves of garlic. I didn't have pizza sauce in the house, so used Prego Onion and Garlic spahetti sauce and I don't think anyone would be able to tell the difference.  There were a couple of vegetarians at the party, so this worked out well for them. I would most definitely make this again.

I have always used this recipe by layering the ingredients.  I must say, it's much easier to eat when you mix it all together.  With melted cheese on top, it tends to get clumpy (for lack of a better word).  The taste is generally the same either way, but I definitely prefer mixing all the ingredients.

I would definitely recommend following the directions. I layered the ingredients (because we made this last minute at my boyfriend's for the OSU/Michigan game) and I think it would be better blended. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS either way.

Delicious dip, however it needs to be layered. I layered the cream cheese, sour cream and spices then the pizza sauce with the veggies and topped it of with the cheese. Lots of flavor and not too much work.

We have a house FULL of 18+ teenage and young adult men in the house annually for my husband's Madden Tournament.  This is a regular request from them and they ask me to make it all year long leading up to it.  This year I doubled it and put it in the crock pot.  Stirred it every 30 mins or so for about 4 hours.  They all think I'm the most wonderful cook.  Little do they know it's so easy they could make it themselves.  I'll just keep that little secret to myself.  It keeps them well behaved.  ;)

Very good. But it does need pepperone and hot sauce. I will also leave out the peppers next time. But still very tasty.

This was pretty darn good. It wasn't very pretty to look at (even with cheese sprinkled on top, haha)...but the flavor will 'knock your socks off'. I skipped out on the onions and peppers (my prefernece) and added chopped pepperoni. I served this with small sliced of toasted whole wheat fench bread.

You have to try this dip!!!!  I have served this dip on several occasions where people were eating it off thier plates with thier fingers.  It has been nothing but a huge hit.  It is extremely easy to make, and if you have any leftover, it reheats well too!  I have never felt the need to add pepperoni, but do use an entire jar of pizza sauce and extra spices.

love this dip have made it quite a few times now and am making it again today. easy and tastes great. i've never added the bell pepper (not a fan) but kept everything else the same. i find this works better in crockpot bc it keeps it hot. this is great w pita chips!

It sounded a lot better than it actually was. Everyone devoured it, but being a hard critic I wasn't impressed. The dip was rather bland. The pizza sauce over powered the rest of the flavors. It needed more of a variety of extra cheeses and maybe even little chunks of pepperoni to add extra flavor.

I made this along with three other dips for a party. It is a good base to start with but it needs a little tweaking because it was on the bland side and the flavors to me were a little off.

Was a hit at a football party!  Was kind of an odd looking color, but no one cared since it was so delicious.  I added an entire jar of pizza sauce (12-14 oz) to get more of a pizza taste.  And it was great served with tortilla chips.

This did taste exactly like pizza! Left out the peppers cause the kids don't like them. Next time I'll add chopped pepperoni and make use large chunks of frech or italian bread instead of tortilla chips

What a goooood dip!  My 13-year-old made this one for several occasions over the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays and it was always a hit.  We got many requests for this recipe.  The only change we made was to add some chopped up pepperoni to the mix.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this a few times and it's always so good. I usually toast some italian bread to dip in it. It does have a really "raw meat" pink color to it, but it doesn't bother me. :)

My middle school students made this for their cooking lab last week.  At first, when we went through the recipe, I heard the typical comments "eww...I don't like peppers, cream cheese, sour cream, etc."  However, I told them that this class was all about opening our minds to new things.

Once they started chopping, mixing and baking, you could see their attitudes changing.

When they sat down to enjoy what they had made and took their first bite, all I heard was "yum"!  These kids loved it.  It did taste a lot like pizza.

I was told they would be creating this dip for future parties and events!

This dips disappears whenever I make it! I omit the red pepper flakes (due to food allergies) and add a bit more garlic that has been roasted.

Not a 5 star dip, but pretty good.  I took this to our Christmas party and served it with crackers.  It went pretty good.  People who tried it loved it, I just couldn't get many to try it.  I will try it in a different bowl next time.  I also will try maybe slicing pizza crusts up and toasting them in the oven to crisp them up.  All in all, I will make this one again.

Was dissapointed as I didn't think it tasted much like pizza at all.  Kids loved it but it was a huge mess to make and a bigger mess to clean up.

Blah.  I was really disappointed with this dip.  The sour cream and cream cheese really over powered the flavor; we couldn't even taste the shredded hard cheeses.  It was actually bland tasting and very heavy.  Needed a lot more salt, pizza sauce, and pepperoni to make it taste fair. I threw most of it out.

If you're expecting a pizza flavor, you will be disappointed.  If you're expecting something different and yummy this is Excellent.  More of a southwestern dip without the kick.  Very addictive!!!

Very good.  Makes a lot!  I baked mine in a 9x13 pan.  I did not use the red pepper flakes, onions, or red pepper.  I did add a little pizza sauce to the top & then mozzarella & pepperoni for more color.

I made this today for my son's preschool graduation tonight night...it's about half gone already!  I used pepperoni flavored pizza sauce and didn't add any additional spices, onion, or pepper because of the kids.  I think it would be better with more sauce and lots of spices for the grown ups.  I also had to cook this at least 15 minutes.  Will definitely make this again!

very good, one alter thought, add graed cheese to the top before serving or before cooking.  It is not the most attractive looking dip, but cheese does the trick.

This is just "okay" I say.  Everyone seemed to like it enough...  But I would rather have other dips.  I probably won't make this again as there are plenty of other old standards and new dips to try for get-togethers.

I enjoyed the dip. The only problem I had is everyone thought it tasted like taco dip (?) so I think next time I will add a little more pizza sauce and more seasonings. Other then that everyone thought it was good!!

This was strangely colored and sort of strange tasting as well. I don't think I'll ever make it again.

This was a good, easy recipe that is probably great for a large crowd.  I tried to use it to get my picky son to eat it for dinner and it wasn't a big hit with him or the rest of the family.  I made it as directed leaving out only the red peppers and green onions. Added pepperoni and served with warm breadsticks.  I won't make again as a family meal/dip but perhaps for a larger group.  The recipe makes 7 cups (a lot!) so if you plan on just for your house, you might want to half it. The full batch took about 30 minutes in the oven 'til it was bubbly.

Yummy! Big hit. Next time I will definitely add some meat like pepperoni or little pieces of sausage. Definitely needs way more than 5 minutes to cook. I think next time I'd put this in a slow cooker.

I made this for our New Years Eve Party and it was a HUGE hit!!! I left out the green onions and peppers. Sliced french bread and then baked it to make it crisp. Yummy!!

I was skeptical while making this dip, but it turned out to be a big hit at my son's birthday party, both the adults and kids raved!

I thought this would be perfect for dipping garlic monkey bread into for a pizza themed dinner.  I only made half this recipe and that was  plenty, but while everyone thought it was good no one really loved it.

Nice.  We did ours without the red pepper flakes, and with pepperoni.

I made this dip for party this weekend. It was done before the late comer's arrival!! I gave away recipe to lot of people too. I added half a cup more of pizza sauce and very small pieces of red bell pepper was a good crunch.
