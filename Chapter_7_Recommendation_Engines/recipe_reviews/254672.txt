This is a hard one for me to rate and review: 1) I cooked it 20 seconds less time than stated, so just watch it. 2) I found this microwave brownie to be very delicate. It IS a mug recipe, but I wanted to turn it out and it crumbled all to pieces. Probably not a problem if eaten in the mug. 3) This recipe calls for no added sugar. It is very minimally  sweet. I would have given this 3 stars, but when I offered it to my grandson who doesn't eat a lot of sweets, he gobbled it right up and thought it was great. So, 4 stars it is!

This was the best thing I've ever made in a mug.  I think the lack of egg really helped to avoid that spongey weird mug cake texture. The NesQuick powder gave it an extra chocolately and rich flavor. I swapped the olive oil for the same amount of melted butter. So so so good.

I really liked it. I had low expectations after reading some of the reviews, but I made it anyway since I was craving a brownie/chocolate really bad. I did what one of the reviews said and cooked it for 1 min. 35 sec. and thank you for the tip or else it would have burned. I also added 1-1/2 tbs of sugar and 1 tbs of Nutella, and I think that's what saved the brownie from not being sweet enough. I love sweets so if you're not a sweet tooth person, go easy on the sugar.

It was VERY crumbly, and the taste wasn't all that great. It was OKAY, and overall not pretty good. Must improve.

This is by far the best mug brownie recipe I've tried! (and ive tried like a million of them, somehow something always manages to come out wrong) I added brown sugar (1/4 cup) and replaced the oil with the same quantity of butter(but only because i dont like using oil on cakes).
It cooked perfectly in 2 mins and the texture was great too.

I didn't have any powdered chocolate milk mix and instead used chocolate milk syrup and added it after the other ingredients along with some sugar. I also used butter because I didn't have any vegetable oil and thought that olive oil would leave a weird taste. It came out tasting like a TV dinner brownie and I drizzled the chocolate syrup on top and stirred it around a little.
