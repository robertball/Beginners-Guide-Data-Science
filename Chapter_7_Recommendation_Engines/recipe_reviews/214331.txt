This recipe was easy to make and tastes great.  I might suggest that the chocolate portion is spread first as it appears thicker and does not spread well over the cream cheese layer.  Other than that- delicious!

This was very good. I didn't make any adjustments, but be careful when you pour the chocolate cheesecake over the regular otherwise it won't layer properly. But still really yummy!

Absolutely delicious! I do wish I followed the other reviewers advice and put the chocolate layer at the bottom cause even though I spooned it on top it sank into the plain layer so my cheesecake didn't turn out looking layered all the way through. That said, the cheesecake turned out delicious! Wonderful recipe and one I will make again. Thanks for posting.

Very good, made it for the family and they loved it. I did use splenda instead of the regular white sugar and it turned out great.

Wonderful. Loved this. Made it for a party at work and it was a big hit. The only thing I'd do different next time is add the cookie crumbles right before serving so they don't get soft/mushy.

Also, I noticed people were mentioning the layers combining when they added the top chocolate layer. I just put the bottom layer in the fridge for a few minutes while I was mixing up the top layer. It seemed to be enough time to let it chill a bit. When I poured the top layer on they didn't combine at all - it worked great.

Will definitely be making this again.

Really good! It didn't have a very strong chocolate flavor but it came out great!
