This smoothie is excellent and very tasty.
Notation: you can add natural canned pineapple as well when you are short on time i tried it w/canned pineapple as well it was tasty also.

This was a nice change from your typical "strawberry, banana" smoothies.  I cut the unsweetened pineapple juice back to 1/2 c. and used 1/2 c. of plain yogurt.  With all the smoothie recipes I try from this site I always add ground flaxseed and soy protein powder.  This was refreshing.

I loved this recipe and I REALLY loved how quick it was! Like other reviewers, I used canned pineapple instead of fresh (a small can of crushed pineapple plus the recommended pineapple juice) and it tasted just great. It was so easy... open two cans, dump them in the blender, break up a banana on top, and throw a few ice cubes, then let 'er rip! Yummy yummy yummy.

My kids liked this okay. I used a frozen banana and omitted the ice. I think this would be stellar as a drink for grownups with some Malibu coconut rum!

Very good! I didn't have fresh pineapple so I used a can of pineapple chunks with juice instead. We also tried this recipe with frozen raspberries, and again with frozen blueberries. All 3 versions were a hit with us!

Yum! This is way better than I expected it to be for some reason. I usually have canned pineapple and juice in the cabinets and used that. I used the juice that came with the pineapple and what I didn't have I opened a juice. I always have frozen bananas in the house for smoothies so I used a frozen one. They make for frothier smoothies anyway. The two alone are a great combination together. I got about 2 servings out of mine. Thank you!

This recipe is just what I was looking for for pineapple and banana without yogurt, which I didn't have. I hardly ever have fresh pineapple, so I used one 20-oz. can of pineapple chunks in its own juice. The juice from the can gave me nearly a full cup, which I topped off with apple juice.

Great smoothie. I used a whole apple in place of apple juice and added a bit more ice. It was great.

I loved this recipe especially because i put in aliitle more pineapple and pineapple juice. If you put in half the banana and put in 3 hulled strawberries it's delicious.

Wow!  What a refreshing smoothie!  I used canned pineapple in pineapple juice and it worked just great.  I made it for my daughter, who loved it, but I tasted it.  When I make one for me, I'm going to try a little coconut extract or coconut rum (depending on time of day). Wow!

I tried this recipe this morning for breakfast and the flavor was wonderful! However I didn't think the texture was a typical smoothie. I think a smoothie should be creamy but this was more like a slushy.

This was yummy!  I used pineapple juice.   I might try adding some strawberries or maybe even some Yoplait pina colada yogurt.  A definite do-again!

I usually use vanilla yogurt or frozen yogurt so I was unsure about just using ice.  It was really good.  I made one, but I had to make another for my teenage daughter after she tasted mine.  I did not have either of the juices so I used orange juice instead.  Will definitely make again and plan to try with apple or pineapple juice.

My boyfriend loved this.  I replaced the juice with coconut water and added some ground flax seed and a tablespoon of almond butter to up the healthy fats.  It was delicious.

Yummy!  I wanted to lessen the fruit sugars, so I used 1% milk for some calcium in place of the juice.  I tasted it, and with some coconut, it was pretty close to a pina colada.  Instead, I added strawberries as someone suggested and made it more like an "Aloha Pineapple" from Jamba Juice!  Thanks for the ideas!

Banana & pineapple....one of my favorite combinations for smoothies!!  I like the fact that yogurt isn't required as I never have any when I want to make a smoothie but it's easy enough to keep a can of pineapple and apple juice in the cupboard & bananas in the freezer. :)

Very good! I used a frozen banana, so I skipped the ice cubes. I also had to use canned pineapple chunks because getting fresh pineapple here in January is next to impossible. I used apple juice and it worked nicely. Very light and refreshing, thanks!

This is a pretty amazing mixture of fruits, pineapples and bananas. It's one of the best smoothies I have ever made. The texture is mostly a creamy fruit concoction, but all my stars go to the taste.

I used crushed ice and one can pineapple chunks with the apple juice and cut up banana and added vanilla yogurt. Good!  Not as flavorful as o thought would be. But still nice cool refreshing drink on way to work in the mornings.

Gorgeous! Tropical bliss! I've been on the search for some dairy free recipes and I think I just found a winner. I used a frozen banana and canned pineapple, next time I am going to try adding some mint leaves!

My son selected this recipe because we heard Pineapple is a great post-workout fruit to help minimize soreness.  Everyone loved it!  I couldn't believe with just a few simple ingredients, we could get such a yummy tropical drink.  We will definitely be making this throughout the summer!

Two thumbs up!  Wanted a recipe that didn't call for yogurt as one child has an allergy to it.  This was perfect!  Used coconut milk from the dairy case not from the can instead of pineapple juice and threw in a small handful of blueberries.  Wonderful!

I modified the recipe because I didn't have everything it called for.I didn't have a fresh pineapple so I used frozen pineapples, a few strawberries, and orange-banana-pineapple juice along with a banana. IT was an amazing smoothie. Giving it 4 stars because it was kind of my own recipe. Thanks for the base ingredients. Was definately my fav. smoothie.

I cheated!!!!  I didn't have any pineapple or apple juice, but I did have an orange smoothie mix packet.  So instead of juice I used a cup of milk, smoothie mix, and ice with the rest of the ingredients and this made the best smoothie.  My kids absolutely loved it.  Thanks for the idea.

This was super yummy after a spicy supper! I tweaked it a little, using 1 cup of low fat yogurt and only a couple of splashes of pineapple juice (instead of the 1 cup of juice) from the can. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and a bit of pumpkin pie spice. (I know, pumpkin pie spice, it's weird but I love pumpkin pie!)

I will definitely make this again and again!

Easy and fast. Tips: use frozen fruit or freeze juice into cubes. This works great in the summer.  Buy fruit in season and cube and freeze on sheet pan - single layer at a time.

Wow! Delicious as is! However... I added 2 cups of liquid apple juice and some frozen apple juice, some organic raw honey, ground flax seed, and some toasted coconut greek yogurt. Can you say delicious! My son loved it! The only thing missing was sitting on an island on vacation! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very simple but healthy and delicious smoothie.  I've always frozen my ripe bananas for homemade cake or bread.  But now I've already cut them in chunks & placed in the freezer to use for a much healthier smoothie.  : )

I don't use ice cubes unless one of the ingredients is very sweet- I substituted the 4 ice cubes with 4 chunks frozen banana, approximately the same size.
*I always use frozen banana chunks (1") instead of ice when I can; they don't water down the flavor and when they warm up the smoothie retains its thickness because of the fruit. I got the tip from my brother's runner's guide- the basic smoothie recipe suggested the switch and I love it!
*2Tbsp. Honey Crunch wheat germ is the only other ingredient that goes in all of my smoothies. Even though my Ninja Pro pulverized everything before 30 seconds are up, it still adds a subtle crunch to the texture and even though very low in sugar, I still have to reduce the sweetest ingredient accordingly.

These two are my favorite in the Peanut Butter-Banana Smoothie I make.
*will go over changes when I rate that one! Yum!

This is my first review and in no way am I criticizing this recipe, it is very good, this is just my spin on it. My wife works in a grocery store and brings home fresh fruit left over from fruit trays. Yesterday it was pineapple so this is how I did it. I whole pineapple cored and cubed in the blender. Blend this up it will make it's own juice, add a few tablespoons of vanilla yogurt  to get it mixing well, throw in a couple of bananas, the riper the better, continue adding yogurt to fill the blender or get the consistency you want. I make a blender full at a time because this is my breakfast every morning so it last a couple of mornings. I usually add oatmeal to all my smoothies for the extra fiber but I did not add to this because it is pretty thick already. Thanks.

I'm not a big fan of pineapple, but this was a nice, refreshing drink. I was looking for something without milk or yogurt. I had to use canned pineapple. I used a frozen banana, and still added the ice. I only used 1/2 c juice, as I don't like my smoothies too liquidy. It was not very sweet, but that was fine for me today.

Not sweet enough for me so I added vanilla ice cream.  So many are trying to lose weight that those of us trying to gain weight get overlooked so I've found that adding ice cream to most any of the smoothies helps.

This is very refreshing! I used a frozen banana and fresh frozen pineapple. I added a splash of pure vanilla extract and apple juice. I suggest apple juice vs. pineapple because the pineapple is very strong from the fruit that if I added juice it would have been a pineapple overload! I would make this again!

I really didn't follow the measurements. I just estimated it and placed everything in my Vitamix professional series 7500, dialed it to smoothie blend and the machine did the rest. I really liked the taste! I'll do some more! A very healthy drink!

This was one delicious smoothie! My banana was frozen so I chose not to add the ice cubes; I think it came out more creamy (as opposed to frosty) by doing that. Like I usually do with smoothies, I also added a few tblsps each of ground flaxseed and vanilla protein powder. Here, I also added 1 tblsp of melted coconut oil. It was also a nice change not adding the usual yogurt. Great tropical tasting smoothie that I know I will make again! Thanks VERITY78!

I loved this. I had some leftover fresh pineapple and a banana that was starting to turn brown, so this was perfect. Very refreshing, frothy, and just simply delicious. I always throw away leftover pineapple, not anymore. :)

Great recipe!  I love to "ad lib" with recipes, so I added a splash of vanilla, half of a peeled and cored apple, skim milk, and some flax seed.  It's an easy recipe to tweak to your taste.
