I was searching for that perfect carrot cake recipe, and I seem to have found it! I chose this one after looking through the recipes on this site and the reviews. However, I did go along with some of the suggestions to reduce the amount of vegetable oil. I used 3/4 c. and the cake turned out moist with no oily taste. I also used 1 cup w. sugar and 1 cup brown sugar rather than all white. I opted for walnuts instead of raisins. It came out perfect in a 8X12 inch pan for 40 minutes in 350 degrees. I didn't try the glaze icing and went with the suggestions for the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe. I love cream cheese desserts and even though I used 95% fat free cream cheese it still tasted flavorful and rich. Awesome combination. Rave reviews came from all who tasted it.

Good recipe. Cake comes out moist and tasty. One caveat: the recipe says to leave the cake in the oven for 60-70 minutes. This is too long. I put my cake in a 10 inch bundt pan for 60 minutes at 350 degrees and the cake was overdone. Next time I plan on checking the cake at 45-50 minutes to test for doneness.

I reviewed several recipes and choose this one. I made it for my new bride who loves carrot cake.
The cake was INCREDIBLE. She says it is the best carrot cake she has ever had. The flavor was so wonderful and the cake was extremely moist. I think the cake gets better with sitting and allowing the raisins and spices to ferment into the cake... for several hours prior to serving.
I recommend adding a bit more nutmeg then called for and I also added 1 teaspoon of genuine mexican vanilla to the batter as well. Mmmmmmm Enjoy this recipe. This cake will make many new friends for you.

I reduced oil to 1 cup and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  The cake turned out very good and moist.  I will be making this again, it is now my favorite carrot cake recipe.

Hi I'm Tyler. My friend and I had to make carrot cake for our science project. We both thought it was not only delicious, but the best carrot cake we had ever tasted. One of the other teachers came into our classroom to sample some of the food and asked for a slice of our cake. He then asked us what the "orange" things were and after we told him that they were carrots, he said that he didn't realize that carrot cake actually had carrots in it. After we stopped laughing, we realized that he wasn't kidding! Anyway, the whole class loved it and the entire cake went in no time!

I used regular raisins soaked in rum, and added a few walnuts too. Really moist and tasty. I didn't make the frosting this time because I didn't have the cream cheese on hand. Next time I'll try the frosting too. This recipe beats the dried out stuff we get at the grocer's bakery any day.

Wow a keeper for sure. I used 1 cup of oil and 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar, also I baked at 350 40 minutes in 9x13. I also used cream cheese frosting. Tip: I use a Kitchen Aid chopper (any chopper will do they sell some at Walmart mini choppers for $5 on black friday) I put my carrots in there and pulse until finely chopped, work as well as shredded and a lot easier. Yummy!!!

Based on previous reviews, I made some changes: 1/4 oil with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup light brown sugar. I also used the cream cheese glaze as written. This cake was a hit at a recent party. It had just the right amount of moistness and spices.

I cooked the cake for 70 minutes and I guess that was 10 minutes too long.  After flipping the cake out of the bundt pan the outer crust of the cake was a little bit hard but not too bad.  The cake still tasted great and was super moist in the inside.  The icing was great too.

My kids loved this cake. I did use only 1c. of oil and to be honest, next time I make it I will reduce it to only 3/4c. It turned out pretty heavy and greasy for my taste. Update: We now make this with only 1/2c oil and a single serve of unsweetened applesauce. Not only does it rise better but the entire texture is fantastic!

Not as good as I'd hoped it would be. A bit dry and somewhat lacking in flavor. I'll continue to look for a better recipe.

This was the first time I've ever made carrot cake from scratch and it was delish.  So moist!!  I'm giving it a 4 star instead of 5 because I, like some other reviewers had a hard time getting the cake out of the bundt pan.  One section of the cake got stuck in the pan and broke apart.  I scraped as much off the pan and tried to put it on the cake.  With the frosting you didn't even notice it but it was annoying that it got stuck...especially since I generously sprayed the pan with baking spray.  But otherwise, it was a really good carrot cake and I will definitely make it again.  Maybe next time I'll try a square pan instead.

I don't know why it said to use a bundt pan, especially since the picture shows a round cake pan...so I used a 8x8 glass pan, and it took FOREVER for this to finish. When it was FINALLY cooked through, the outside had a very burnt look and feel, almost carmelized. I had to reduce the heat of the oven for the last 1/2 hour or so just to get it cooked through without completely ruining it. I think it should be specified how long to cook it in 2 round cake pans, not a bundt. The flavor itself of the cake wasn't that great either, even after I cut off the burnt edges. I also thought that it had a bit too much carrot in it?

Also, I used my own frosing- 16 oz. cream cheese softened, 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar, and 1 tsp. vanilla. The frosting was the best part! I used the leftover frosting on some yellow cake cupcakes I made the next day.

I wouldn't make this one again. I'll keep searching for "the perfect carrot cake" recipe. My search does NOT end here.

Very Yummy, only used 1 cup veg. oil. 1cup white/brown sugar as suggested.
used bunt pan and it gave it a very nice "crust" on the bottom, Great Texture! EASY to make, hardest part is grating your carrots!

Was very moist and good flavor; I would make it again. It was attractive on the plate; I sprinkled walnuts on top of th icing. One problem, I made it in a regular size bunt pan and it spilled over in the oven.  So next time I'd put less batter in the cake.

Why did it say to use a Bundt? I thoroughly greased my bundt with butter and the cake completely stuck. It also looked terrible...has a carmelized/burnt look to it. It tastes good; but not wonderful. I was so dissapointed with its poor apperance. I used "Cream Cheese Frosting II" and the frosting is great. I am still looking for a great carrot cake recipe.

Excellent recipe!!!  I baked it in a 9x13 pan and made my own cream cheese frosting, and my family and friends raved at Thanksgiving!  The only change I made was 1 c white/1 c brown sugar, and it came out great...will definitely make again!!!

I just finished baking this and as it was cooling, I took a piece to test it out.  It tastes like oil!  Way too greasy and very sweet!  I thought the carrot to flour ratio was off (3:2 cups), but I just kept on going (thinking it might work out) and boy, there was more carrots then cake!  I made this to bring for work, but after testing it, I doubt I even want to leave it home for my family to try it!  Won't be making again.

I love this cake and everyone I make it for loves this cake.  However, I have adapted the recipe a bit used 1/2 cup Lighter Bake instead of 1 cup of the oil, replaced 1 cup white sugar with 1 cup brown sugar, didn't have nutmeg or raisins, added some walnuts and used molasses instead of corn syrup in the glaze.  All this makes the cake a little dark, but it's yummy!

This is the traditional form of the cake and I liked it.  I've made it twice and, for me, it was simple to put together, which is great because I'm not much on kitchen stuff.  The only thing I changed was making the frosting with 2--3 oz. packages of cream cheese and adding extra flavoring to compensate. I put the carrots in a food processor, not a blender.  I also added a cup of chopped walnuts and since I didn't have any white raisens, I used my black.  I also added a dash  of ginger.  Tastes very good to me.  C. Watkins

It is a little bit too greasy. For the rest is excelent!

I reduced 1/4 cup of oil on the second try and it came out fluffier.

I will try to reduce the oil more on the next batch.

This carrot cake is amazing! usually when i've made carrot cake in the past, it's too dry or too mushy.... so i split the carrots in half... half i grated raw and the other half i steamed first, then mushed.  i followed everything else to the -T-! and it came out PERFECT. exquisite! i'll definitely make this again :) thanks for the recipe!

I didn't have the cream cheese to make the frosting for this cake, so I used a vanilla buttercream and it turned out great. I also used a sheet cake pan to cook this in,1 tbsp of sour cream, and 3/4 cup of oil like others suggested. still moist after 4 days.

It's March break and the kids needed to fill some time!  This was a delightful and easy recipe for them.  I made them cut the oil back to 1C and it was still very moist!  Flavour and texture were nice and we made it in a 9x13 without icing and it was half gone the first day!

So moist!!!  I made this for my husband and daughter's birthday.  Everyone at the party said how moist and yummy it was.  The only change to the recipe is that I didn't use raisins and I made a different cream cheese with pineapple frosting.  This is a keeper!

This is a very moist and carroty cake.
For a cool variation on this use 1.5 cups carrot and 1.5 cups shredded and peeled zucchini.  Substitute half of the raisins with dried sweetened cranberries.  These will make the cake a little smoother and milder.  Enjoy!

This is a great Carrot Cake recipe!  I've made carrot cakes for years and my family loves them so I'm pretty familiar with the process.  Now, I will say that I changed the recipe just slightly, omitting the raisins (just for preference) as well as the corn syrup in the icing (I make cream cheese icing quite a bit and find that the corn syrup is unnecessary). It's super moist and smells sooo good when it's baking. 

I like to make layer cakes so I actually made 3 layers out of this batter, and baked it for about 25-30 minutes.  Rave reviews!!

I only made the carrot cake not the icing.  I made this recipe for my mom's wedding today.  It was great everyone loved it.  I used a different cream cheese icing becauce I wasn't sure if this one could be piped and hold up well.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I soaked the raisins in water and rum extract for about 1/2 a day before hand.  Very Moist!!

I have now ended my search for a great carrot cake recipe! I did decrease the carrots to about 2 1/4 cups and added a cup coconut and a cup chopped walnuts. Instead of frosting, I made a glaze with milk, maybe an ounce of cream cheese and powdered sugar. The cake was deeeeeelish!!! Moist and so tasty. Everyone that tasted it fell in love. Thanks for sharing

Best Carrot cake I have ever made! (and I have made many) I made this for Easter 2009 and let me say this one is a keeper, it was very moist and flavorful. The frosting was great too. I added some food coloring to some that I had separated and made little carrots and border as well. My family loved it and thought it looked cute! Thanks

This cake is DELICIOUS although I followed some tips from some others used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 regular and 3/4 cups of oil instead of 1 1/4 and I made it in a bigger Pyrex rubbed it down with shortening didn't stick at all cuts without any trouble So moist and it tastes amazing!!! had to make more frosting because of the size of the container I made it in but no biggie tasted till it was perfect! If you are going to make a carrot cake, make this one! Also, cooked at 350 for 35 minutes, 60 and it would have been burnt here!

Excellent cake! I took it to a BBQ, and was scared taking a new recipe without trying it first. It was GREAT. I had just dug up carrots from my garden and had so many I didn't know what to do. Searching I found this recipe and am glad I did. I used the cream cheese glaze and it was wonderful. I also used my food processor to do the chore of grating the carrots for me. It took less than one minute!

I used 1/4 cup less oil and used store bought creamcheese icing, then coated the entire cake in walnuts.  It tasted alright, but I had big problems with the batter overflowing the pans.  You should see my oven!  It is definately too much batter to put in just two round pans!  Pretty good recipe overall, and some of my problems may have been cook error.

Overall this is a great recipe. I gave it 5 stars even though I altered it with some of the suggestions from other users. I used only 1 cup of oil and to be honest if I used the amount it said it would of been to wet and heavy. I also used a cup each of white/brown sugar.

I didn't use the icing instead I used the cream cheese icing II.

Everybody loved this cake and said it was one of the best carrot cakes they had ever had.

Thank you for the recipe and suggestions.

I made this today for my husband's birthday, his favorite is carrot cake and I have never made it before.  I also reduced the oil to 1 cup, added a tsp of pure vanilla, and I did not use raisins.  I cooked it in 2 round pans for about 30-35 minutes.  I used the cream cheese II recipe.  It was simple delicious.  He loved it and so did my kids who never eat the cake, but only the frosting.  It was moist and flavorful. Oh la, la,  Wonderful cake!

Yummy!  My husband, who's very hard to please, even had seconds of this.  I did decrease the oil to 1 cup instead of 1 and 1/4 cups.  I also baked this in a 9 x 13 pan - it took about 45 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This recipe sounded so good, I got all the ingredients from the store and hid them for several days just to bake this cake as a surprise for my husbands birthday.  I followed the recipe exactly, poured the batter into a normal-sized bundt pan (it filled it 2/3 of the way full), and put it into my 350 degree oven.  About 20-25 minutes into the baking process, I noticed some smoke coming from my oven --- the batter had boiled over (a LOT) and was dripping heavily onto the rack below and the bottom of my oven.  Needless to say, I am sitting here smelling my burnt, deflated masterpiece until everything is cooled enough to clean up.  And my husband has to pick up a store-bought birthday cake on his way home from work.  Lovely.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is so very forgiving.  I made it late one night for my family to have for breakfast the next morning because I was out of every kind of breakfast food.  I didn't use accurate measurements (just kind of eyed it) and I made a few little substitutions...and it was sooo good!  The frosting was great too.  This will end up as one of those recipes that I memorize and use as a starting point when I want to create something new.  Thank you!

I made this for a teacher appreciation luncheon at the end of the school year.  Everyone raved.  Very similar to my mom's recipe.  Easy, if you have a Cuisinart to shred the carrots!

We left out the raisins, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. Good, but WAY too oily! Like drippy on the plate after it was cooled and taken out of the pan(we used a 9x11). I would cut back on the oil next time, but otherwise the flavor was great. We did not use the glaze in this recipe, but used a cream cheese frosting also on this site.

Rave Reviews for this Carrot Cake.  Followed suggestions of others and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar, no raisins don't care for them.  I have made this 3 times now and everyone is asking for the recipe.  Used the cream cheese frosting recipe from here instead of the glaze.  Also, I baked it in a bundt pan.  Its a big hit!

YUM...MOIST...GREAT cake! Well worth making! Pared down the oil to 1 cup, then doubled the recipe for a large two layer baby shower cake, will omit 1/2 tsp of baking soda next time. I was afraid from how it smelled that it would have a baking powder/soda taste...it didn't! But I will make that adjustment as a test if I double the recipe again.

This carrot cake has been quite a hit! I've made three of them so far--one was requested as a gift for a party where it received many compliments. I reduced the sugar as suggested and used 1/2 white/brown sugar. In the last 2 cakes I did, I'd run out of white flour and decided "what the hay" and used whole wheat. The whole wheat actually came out better and I highly recommend it. Additionally,  I did not use the frosting recipe. Instead, I made a simple sugar glaze using powdered sugar and water--about 1 to 1 and 1/2 Cups powdered sugar mixed with 2 Tablespoons water. Poured over top and allowed to cool for about an hour in the fridge. Non-dairy and just right.

I didn't reduce the oil. But...i exchange 1/4 cup of olive oil mix with 1 cup cooking oil. And i add 5 eggs not 4 as in the recipe. The cake turned out to be very delicious, not oily at all. Also i add more nutmeg & 2 tablespoon of rhum..It gave more fragrant and rich flavor for the cake. One more thing...i bake it in the convection microwave oven  180 celcicius for 80 minutes. It bake perfectly!

I too, used 3/4 cup oil, and 1 cup brown sugar-1 cup white sugar, and no rasins. I added about 3/4 cup walnuts, too! It was outstanding! My family loved it and I gave the recipe to my daughter and daughter-in-laws. Even all my grandchildren ate a slice with walnuts in it! I made it in a bundt pan. It made a beautiful presentation with the white cream chees frosting drizzled over the cake!

I might try this recipe again because I think it might just be my crappy baking skills, but my cake smelled like popcorn. I have no idea why. It also had a funny texture.

This was very good.  It tasted even better the next day.  I will make this again but next time I will reduce the amount of oil down to 3/4 cup because it was very oily.

I made this specially for my dad's birthday. It came out great, but broke into two big pieces while I was taking it out of the pan.. I used butter to keep the flour on the pan, and I'm not quite sure what went wrong. The frosting tasted great and, despite appearances, turned out to be enough for even a 10" bundt cake (more surface area than a normal cake). Used 3/4 cup vegetable oil as recommended.

I didn't do the frosting at all.  Yes, I know it's tradition but I'm just not that much into frosting and using corn syrup just sounded sickeningly too sweet.  I commonly leave frosting off any type of snack cake.  This was OK but nothing exciting.  I've had better carrot cakes.  I also remembered why I never make it - grating carrots is one major hassle.

I followed other reviewers advice & only used 1 c. oil. Also 1 c. brown sugar & 1 c white sugar. I added 1/2 c walnuts. It wasn't as good as I expected. Perhaps I needed the extra oil. I did like the icing better than other cream cheese recipes suggested because it's lower in fat, with no butter. I've used the icing on other recipes. My husband loves it.

I had another recipe for carrot cake, maybe more scrumptious really but with butter in it and so much greasier! with carrots and oil you even think it's definitely healty food...you can reduce the amount of oil and I had to do without the frosting but it turned out well all the same

This is our family's favorite cake. It is moist, rich and delicious. We get requests to bring it for special occasions when we volunteer to bring dessert.  The hardest thing about it is grating all those carrots,and the Cuisinart makes quick work of that, if you have one.  Fabulous recipe.

This is a classic carrot cake without all the added stuff of modern carrot cakes (pineapple, coconut, whatever!).  In other words, the carrot cake of my memories.  I've made this several times, following the directions exactly, with the exception of added walnuts, in a bundt pan, baked for 60 minutes and it turns out beautifully.  The cake is moist but not oily.  It's good with or without the glaze.  I used this glaze, although it seemed more frosting-like than glaze, and liked it very much.  Despite the 2C of sugar, it's not overly sweet.

This is a very nicely flavored carrot cake, which easily converted to gluten-free. I chose this recipe because my son wanted to make a carrot cake without pineapple, coconut or nuts. We used currants instead of full-sized raisins, and that worked very well. Our cake was a bit overdone at the minimum time, but that might have been the fault of the gluten-free flour blend we used. We will definitely make this again.

This recipe is wonderful. I did only use 3/4 cup of oil, but added about a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts for the flavor and it turned out fantastic.

Great flavor, but still too moist, even with cutting back to 3/4 cup of oil.  I used very dry raisins, and even my carrots were a bit dry.  Maybe I should add more flour or still less oil? I baked for 55 min at 350 in a Bundt pan and the top was very done, inside not quite all the way, again too moist.  Tasty enough to warrant some additional experimentation!

I made this for my daughter's bday(carrot cake is her favorite), we all loved it. I did lessen oil to 1 cup and did 1 cup of each brown and white sugar and omitted the raisins. Delicious, will definitely make again.

This  was my first time making a carrot cake.  It was delicious.  I took the advise in one of the comments and reduced the oil to one cup.  I greased and floured my tube pan and there was no sticking.

I'm rating the cake without the icing. I only used a cup of oil and didn't add raisins because I didn't have any. I greased and floured two round cake pans to make a layer cake and had no problem getting it out of the pan after baking. This cake came out wonderfully moist, but I did adjust the baking time due to using two pans, it took about 35 minutes. I made it for a friend's birthday and he LOVED it! He went back for seconds even though he was stuffed from dinner! I used the basic cream cheese frosting recipe from this site because I wanted something thick that I could pipe a border with. It was a great pair!

Everyone that tried it said it was the best carrot cake they have ever had. The only thing I would change is that I would line the pan with parchment paper. The cake stuck to the bottom even with plenty of non stick spray and a non stick pan. I did get it unstuck by rubbing outside bottom of the pan with a cold wet dish towel.

I was skeptical how this would turn out but was pleasantly surprised that everyone thought it was good!  It it moist and I think the reason is that compared to a previous recipe that I had used which had the same carrot, sugar, oil, and egg ratio actually had half the flour of the first recipe. Next time I bake this I will increase the flour to 3 cups.

This is a good recipe, probably the best carrot cake that doesn`t use pineapple. I didn`t make the frosting and cut the cake into squares. Based on the previous reviews I used 3/4 cup vegetable oil, white and brown sugar (just 1 1/2 cup, it was enough for us) and soaked raisin. Added coconut flakes too. I baked it for 45 minutes. Came out moist and tasty.

It is a pretty good cake, lots of good smells and flavors! BUT the cake came out a little dry (did all steps listed) and the glaze is not that great. It needed more flavor, maybe some vanilla, to really bring the taste out and make the glaze nice & smooth

Think someone missed something. How about heating the glaze? I like throwing in some chopped pecans and fresh pineapple chunks in place of raisins; not a fan of raisins in carrot cake. Took off one star for the glaze. Otherwise a good recipe.

This cake was VERY moist and super tasty.  I tweaked it by adding a cup of pecan pieces and an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (just because I love cinnamon).  It was the first cake I ever baked from scratch, and it only took me 20 minutes to prep.  Super easy!

Really good!  Cut the oil back to 1 cup, but otherwise left the recipe alone.  My glaze turned slightly beige because I used too much vanilla, but didn't affect the taste at all.  Husband liked this as well...  so it's a keeper.  Will make again.

This was fabulous. I left out the raisins because I'm just not a fan. I also skipped the glaze and went for readymade buttercream frosting. Yum

I liked the cake itself, but I felt that the frosting was too sweet. But, I generally like my desserts to be a nice combo of sweet and semi-sweet, so maybe that's why.

This is the first time I made carrot cake from scratch and it was easy. I opted to use 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of oil and didn't add raisins. They came out really moist. I made them into cupcakes and brought them to my son's playgroup. They were a hit!

Addicting. I followed a reviewer's advice to reduce the oil to 3/4 cup. The cake was dense, but not as moist as i would like so perhaps i shouldn't have taken out 1/2 cup of the oil. didn't have raisins on hand. still, a wonderful cake. i used Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe.

I get so many compliments about this cake.  It has to be the most moist carrot cake that I ever had.  It's my family's favorite.  Even my mother- in-law requests this cake at every family gathering.

My mother enjoyed this recipe but I was disappointed. The cake took long to make and in the end it fell apart on me.
