I've made this twice already and it is delicious. The first time I made it, I did the following: I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and used 8 eggs instead of 6, and cooked the onion with the sausage. I also tossed in some diced green peppers and onions with the potatoes that I shredded, and I baked the crust separately. The second time I made it, I used frozen hash browns instead of shredding my own potatoes. I just tossed the frozen hash browns with diced peppers, onions, and melted butter, and baked at 375 for about 30 minutes. The frozen hash browns hold up much better than using grated potato hash browns, probably because frozen hash browns are thicker. The fresh grated hash browns were by no means bad, but the frozen hash browns had better taste and texture. Also, the second time I used ricotta cheese, and I gotta say, I liked the cottage cheese better. Again, the ricotta was not bad, but the casserole made with ricotta came out kind of spongy, if you will. The casserole made with the cottage cheese was more moist and, in my opinion, more flavorful. The cheese flavor of the ricotta was more subtle than the cottage cheese, and again, the ricotta gave the casserole a spongy (almost dry) texture.
I also agree with the reviewer who used 4 cups of hash browns instead of 3. HOMEMADE SAUSAGE: 1LB GROUND BEEF, 2t GROUND GINGER, 2t GROUND SAGE, 3/4t SALT, 1/2t BLACK PEPPER, PINCH CAYENNE PEPPER.

I still have yet to figure out why people change the recipe and then give it a bad review. Follow this recipe and it tastes great. I've tried a couple of the breakfast/sausage casseroles on here and this is by far the best one. I made it for Easter and everyone loved it. I think everyone had at least 2 (some had 3) pieces.  I will be making this again VERY soon!

This was perfect for Christmas breakfast.  I pre-cooked the potatoe shell in the oven the night before at 350 degrees and refrigerated it until the next morning.  I also mixed all ingredients the night before so that all I had to do was pour into crust and bake.  Very simple.  Hubby enjoyed this casserole better than the bread ones.  I did add some red and yellow peppers for color.  Everyone enjoyed this.  Will make again.

YUM!!!  I needed to use up some things from the freezer, and this was SO good.  I made the following changes:

-Used frozen shredded O'brien potatoes (with chopped onions and bell peppers)
-Browned the butter in the 9x13 (just put it in the pan, stuck in the oven to melt, and waited till it was brown) and then threw potatoes in, stirred and pressed in the bottom
-Baked potato layer for 30 min., then added egg layer and baked another 30
-used leftover sliced corned beef instead of sausage
-added chopped mushroom to egg mixture

My dd tasted it and said "YUM!  You're making this EVERY Sunday!!!"  She's pretty reserved, so this was huge.

I plan to make this for Christmas morning.  I will probably use regular breakfast sausage, and add green onions and black pepper.  I think I would also let the potato layer cook a little longer before adding the eggs.

This was very good....we really enjoyed this for dinner! After reading through some of the reviews, I made some minor changes.  I baked the shredded potato "crust" while browning the sausage and stirring together the casserole ingred.  I used onion powder, (family preference) added a small can of sliced mushrooms, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and used shredded swiss cheese.  YUMMY!  Mine was done in 45 min (probably from pre-baking the potatoes) and the potatoes were great! I wish that I would have seasoned this up with at least salt and pepper (definately will next time).....I assumed since the recipe didn't call for any, that the sausage and cheese would have enough seasoning.  Will definately make again!  Thanks for the recipe!

The onion was crunchy and undercooked which distracted from the overall quality of this.  Next time I'll saute the onion with the sausage to ensure it is cooked and limp prior to baking. I followed other reviewers suggestions:  used refrigerated shredded potatoes ("Simply Potatoes" brand), used sharp cheddar, substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, added a 4 oz. can of chopped green chiles, used 8 eggs instead of 6, and baked it at 350 deg.  It was delicious and flavorful.  Each of my guests went back for seconds. One guest kept adding black pepper to his portions, so next time I'll probably add some to the mixture.

Very tasty recipe. I didn't give it four stars because I think it could use some minor modifications. I would use slightly more potatoes (about four cups). I'd also suggest using cream cheese instead of cottage cheese, for more flavor and saute the onions along with the sausage. But even without the changes, it was a very tasty and easy to make recipe.

I really liked this dish. Didn't change a thing except I used sharp cheddar. Took others advice and baked the hashbrown layer by itself first. Next time I will be sure to bake on bottom rack of oven for better browning of hashbrowns. A keeper, thanks!

This is fantastic, and perfect for breakfast or brunch!  My Sunday school class devours it, it is a huge hit with the men.  I did modify a few things:  Add 1 4oz. can of diced green chiles & a small jar of diced pimientos for color.  Use frozen hash browns-defrost & press moisture out.  I also lightened it a bit by using light butter & 4 whole jumbo eggs & 4 jumbo egg whites.  This is a definite keeper!!!!!!

I made this for my MOPS (mothers of preschoolers) meeting this week & there was none left.  I did make some changes.  They are as follows:  I used regular breakfast sausage, a 16 ounce package of O'Brien potatoes (with onions & peppers), I omitted the onion, used an 8 ounce bag of sharp cheddar (2 cups), & used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  It turned out perfect.  I even made it the night before & baked it the next morning.  This would be great to make Christmas Eve for Christmas morning brunch.  Great recipe.  Thanks Bill!

This is very, VERY good.  I made it for a house full during the holidays and there wasn't a morsel left!  My relatives were all asking for the recipe!  OK, I think the reason some reviewers say it's too dry is that they bake the potato mixture first.  The recipe does not call for this.  Pre-baking the potatoes not only dries out the casserole, it shortens the total baking time which doesn't allow for the onion to soften (some reviewers complain that the onion doesn't cook all the way).  Oh, and my little nephew (who is gluten intolerant) was thrilled that he could eat what everyone else was eating!  Most breakfast casseroles call for bread.  Follow the recipe exactly, for a terrific Breakfast Casserole.  Thanks!

Like others, I tweaked this recipe a little bit. I substituted thawed and drained o'brien-style(onions and peppers)hash browns for the shredded potatoes, adding just 3 tbsp melted butter and a little salt and pepper to them before pressing them into the baking dish. Then baked that for 30 min at 350.  I browned the sage sausage and the onion together. I substituted sharp cheddar for the mild. And I used 8 large eggs instead of 6 jumbo. Don't let the cottage cheese scare you. I was a little apprehensive about using it, but once it's baked you can't tell it's in there, and it lends a really nice texture to the dish (and you can't taste it either). To the egg mixture I also added a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, a sprinkling of salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, and a couple dashes of tabasco sauce. Baked it for 55 min at 350. Turned out fantastic; great flavor and very nice (not mushy) consistency. My family loved it, and Hubby said it was a "touchdown"!  Thanks for a great basic recipe.

I keep coming back to this recipe, and every time I rate it, I lower it a star.  I think that this is a decent recipe, but it is very, very bland and really lacking any WOW.  If you are serving to small children or to the elderly it might be passable.  It is fine for getting rid of some leftovers, but as the recipe currently is, I would not serve this to guests as is.  It requires many changes and by the time the changes are made, it is a new recipe, not at all the same as the recipe here.   When I made this recipe the first time, following the recipe exactly, I felt it was bland, it lacked any flavor and definitely needed major modifications.  I added the onion and some green pepper to the sausage and cooked them together.  I ended up adding a can of well- drained diced tomatoes to the sausage as well.  I only had large eggs, not jumbo, so I used nine large eggs.  I added a bit of onion powder and a clove of crushed garlic to the egg mixture, as well as a bit of black pepper.  I felt it needed a bit of extra flavor.  I also used sharp cheddar cheese ... shredded myself, never from the package.   I used half of the cottage cheese the recipe stated, combining the other half with sour cream.  I used store bought shredded potatoes, but added some salt and pepper to the potatoes as well.  I assembled the entire casserole the night before and baked in the morning.  It takes longer to bake than the recipe calls for.  In my convection oven it took about 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Even

I have made this casserole for years and years.  IT IS DELICIOUS.  As for the person giving this ONLY ONE STAR .....  If it had been made as directed, rather than substituting almond powder for the sausage AND using butter instead of creamed corn (?????) he would have found it delicious.  With all these changes he should not have rated this recipe.

I made this casserole for our churches monthly get together after mass. I followed some of the other suggestings and melted the butter in my glass pan, added the (simply poatoes) hash browns, mixed and then patted into the bottom abd baked at 350 for about 35 minutes. I fried the onion with the sausage I used...couldn't find sage flavored so I just used Premio loose breakfast sausage. Also, I used 8 eggs. Otherwise I followed the recipe ingredients as stated and let it sit in the fridge overnight. In the morning I took it out of the fridge about an hour before, then baked for about 35 minutes. This was the best thing there! It went very quickly. Got lots of requests for the recipe. Now I'm looking for an excuse to make it again. Thanks so much!!!

I think this is my new favorite breakfast casserole, and a house full of guests this morning seemed to agree. 

Taking tips from previous reviewers, I used 8 eggs instead of six, used frozen hash browns, baked them first and browned onion with the sausage, adding salt and pepper to the egg mixture. Using what I had on hand, I used a combo of shredded Cheddar, Monterrey Jack and Mozzarella. I served this with chopped green onions and salsa, fruit and muffins. Yummy. 

Thanks!

I have served this for Christmas the last two years.  It is delicious!  The cottage cheese keeps it moist and sets it apart from other dry casseroles I have prepared in the past.  The first time, I used regular Jimmy Dean sausage, as I had never tasted "sage" sausage and wasn't sure I wanted to.  This Christmas, I DID use the sage.  It made all the difference in the world; so much more flavor.  Six people devoured the entire casserole lickety split!

Perfect, exactly as is!  (I also liked spicing it up a bit with southwestern flavored hashbrowns and mexican cheese.) It's also nice (if you have the time) to cook the potatos about 30 minutes before putting the egg mixture in, so the hashbrowns have a little crunch.  This can be done the night before.  The egg mixture can also be done the night before.

I read some of the reviews beforehand so had a plan for our tastes.  First I made the breakfast Sausage per Lee Fogle on allrecipes using ground turkey from Costco (7%fat).  It was a hit so I saved what was left-almost 1# for this casserole; I've been looking for a good breakfast casserole like this for some time.  My adaptations:  4 cups of frozen potato shreds (defrosted in the microwave), I put the butter in the pan & melted it in the warming oven, then added the potato shreds & pressed them into the pan & cooked it @ 375 while I prepared the rest.  I browned the sausage, onion, & some red & green bell pepper together.  I used 8 large eggs, 8 ounces of sharp cheddar cheese, & a carton of 2% cottage cheese, & mixed these together.  When the sausage was browned & the onion & peppers soft, I added them to the egg/cheese mixture.   Because all of this was warm (except the cheese) when I started, the cooling time was shorter, 45 min or less.  375 degrees worked well for cooking in a glass 13x12 inch pan.  One bite & family comments were - really good!  Even the picky grand daughter liked it.  I'd like to try a slimmer version using 1% cottage cheese, 2% sharp cheese, & half egg whites for the whole eggs.  I'm betting it would be just as delicious.  This is really a great recipe.    Thank you.

I've made this twice now, once for my husband's office and once for a potluck.   Both times, it got raved reviews. I use frozen hash brown, which I cook first,then flatten it to the bottom of the pan, bake it for about 20 minutes or until brown. Then I add the rest of the mixture.  The cripy hash browns on the bottom of the pan makes a big difference.

I make this on a regular basis to take to work in the morning while it's still hot.  This casserole has such a reputation around the hospital that people from all departments come for a sample and the recipe every single time.  My family thinks it is delicious and I really didn't change a single thing, other than using the dried onions sold in the spice isle instead of fresh.  I don't pre-bake my potatoes, and quite often when they are on sale I use a bag of the 'Simply Potatoes' that are generally sold close to the eggs.  If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would! I did make it recently with maple flavored sausage and it was quite spectacular.

Very tasty recipe - perfect for a late brunch! The texture was a bit different, but really nice.
I divided this recipe to make 4 portions (according to the recipe) but was really only enough for two adults (with only a little bread, cheese and veg on the side). As a side dish, it might last longer.
I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except using vegetarian sausages (which don't 'crumble' as such, so I just chopped them into smaller pieces) and adding some seasoning and dried sage to the egg mix before pouring into the dish.
When I do it next time, I will add even more seasoning. If it's for a main meal, I'd even try adding some halved cherry tomatoes to the mix. I had some on the side and the flavours worked well together.
I'd also use more shredded potatoes to create a thicker layer around the edges.
All in all, a great recipe though which will definitely be used again!

This recipe is super good! I would have posted a picture, but it was inhaled by the guys. Men! Anyway, I changed up a few things just to suit our tastes. I used mild Italian sausage because I am not a big sage fan. I added in a couple of hefty shakes of hot sauce and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I also added another egg because mine are large and not jumbo. My only complaint/concern is that it did not cook up completely solid after 60 minutes, so I nuked it for an additional 5 minutes...keep in mind that my nuker remembers when dinosaurs roamed the earth, so use your judgement there if you have the same problem I did. I did add a chopped bell pepper to the recipe and I sauted it up with the sausage and onion. Oh, yeah, lest I forget...I did not grate the onion...I'm in a 21-foot RV and nothing will run you out in the rain quicker than grating a freaking onion inside...I just chopped it up and threw it in...we like chunks of food and everyone I cook for likes onions, so I didn't feel the need to try to disguise it by grating. I also felt that the potatoes, themselves, needed seasoning, so I added sea salt and pepper to them. Like I said, my guys inhaled this and it was gone in no time flat! Thanks for a delicious recipe that will be made over and over again! :)

My husband found this recipe and thought he would try it for a breakfast he was making for 20 of his co-workers. If I could give more than 5 stars I would! It was a BIG hit with his co-workers and lucky for me there were two pieces leftover that he brought home so I could try it. In a million years, you would never guess this recipe has cottage cheese in it! Instead of chub sausage, we used Jimmy Dean's original links, which hubby cooked up and sliced into smaller round slices. We also used another poster's suggestion of using frozen hash browns mixed with the onions and butter and cooked separately in the pans for 30 minutes before adding the remainder of the ingredients. We also upped the eggs to 8 jumbos per pan. For 20 hungry men, we used 3- 9x13 pans and assembled each pan separately, rather than combining all ingredients X3. People came back for seconds and complimented my husband profusely on what a delicious and satisfying breakfast this was. Looking forward to making this again soon for our own family! Luscious! Thanks so much for sharing, William!

Delicious!!! Made just a couple changes... Instead of adding the onions to the eggs I added them and finely chopped sweet pepper to the potatoes.. I browned and seasoned the potatoes on the stove top the night before and then layered everything. Also I added bacon bits on the top. Because it came out the the refrigerator and was cold increased cook time to 1h 35min. Cover the first hour. Everyone loved this dish on Christmas morning! It was filling enough for us to make it until an early dinner but not too heavy. Will make again, may try other variations of cheese and meat for variety.

This was a big hit at a brunch baby shower.  I used hot Jimmy Dean sausage to give it a little kick.  I also used southern-style hash browns instead of the shredded type.  There was quite a bit of grease with this, but I think it would be tasty to substitute reduced-fat sausage and cottage cheese.

I seldom make any recipe more than once (there are just so many recipes out there to try, right?), but this one I've made three times in the past two months.  Why?  Not because it's fancy or has complex flavors -- I've made it that many times because it's GOOD - just plain comfort food at its best good.  (P.S.  Made exactly as instructions state)

I replaced the sausage with powdered almonds and the butter with creamed corn. It was awful - I will never recommend this recipe to anyone.

5 stars with 8 eggs, frozen o'brien potatoes cooked 30min by self (I salt pepper potatoes.), regular sausage rather than sage, and cook onion with sausage. Then mix, pour over potatoes, and cook 30-35 min longer. Very good.

I just made this dish for Easter Brunch and everyone raved! It is a definate keeper. I did incorporate a couple of the tips from other reviewers with regards to cooking the hash browns first, as well as adding 8 large eggs vs. 6 jumbo. 

Here are a couple of other tips:
1. I used the Simply Potatoes Hash Browns that were not frozen, but shredded fresh. There was no need to drain and press. 
2. I seasoned them with Johnny's Season Salt when cooking them before hand.
3. To cut down on the grease and making it a bit more healthy - I use "Jones All Natural Sausage & Rice Breakfast Links". It has 50% less fat and 40% fewer calories.
4. Tillamook Queso Blend (Monteray Jack & Cheddar) was perfect in the casserole.

My family loved this!!!  Ive made breakfast casseroles before but never with cottage cheese!!  Oh so wonderful!!  I did add 1/2 lb more sausage and I did not have jumbo eggs so I used 9 large eggs.  Also cooked hashbrowns for a half hour then added mixture and refridgerated for 12 hours.  This is a keeper!!  Thank you so much!!

This is by far the best tasting breakfast casserole recipe! I also substitued ricotta for the cottage, as no one in the house but me cares for cottage cheese. I ended up using 14 large eggs, since I wanted the casserole to be mostly eggs instead of mostly sausage or potatoes. I also salted the potato layer and pre-baked it to add crunch. I was in a hurry so I baked it at 400 for about 30 minutes, then reduced it to 375 and covered the edges to prevent over-browning, and it was done in another 20 minutes. This recipe is awesome in soft tortillas with a little salsa, and it fed 7 people breakfast for 2 days. Thanks!

I served this sausage casserole at a monthly breakfast club to my girlfriends and it was a huge hit.  I have to say that this was da bomb that day.  My husband had the left overs later on and ate about 4 servings of this wonderful dish. The recipe didn't say what size dish to put it in, so I increased the serving size to 12 and it fit perfectly into a 9X13 dish.

This is a hit! It can be made, put in the fridge the night before and popped in the oven in the morning. Good for church or work potlucks and even better for family get-togethers. We like it a little zipped up so I saute the onion, garlic, peppers before cooking the meat. It's even good as a vegetarian dish.

I took this to our church breakfast this morming and out of ten casseroles this is the one that disappeared. I got a request for the recipe. I stuck to the recipe except I did prebake the potatoes in a 450 oven for 20 minutes before adding the egg mixture and turning the heat down.I will definately make this again.

This was so delicious. I've been looking for a yummy breakfast casserole and I think I've found my go-to. I did what other reviewers said and baked the potatoes by themselves first, I would do it longer next time, I like my potatoes crunchy. I also sauteed my onions with the sausage. Also I added a red bell pepper, YUM, that added a lot. Of course I added in some pepper, garlic seasonings, perfect!

My office had a breakfast pot luck and i was beside myself as to what to make. I searched on this site and came across this recipe. I was nervous about making the recipe and bringing it to the office only because I've never tried doing it before. WOW....Let me just tell you that it was so simple to make and the best thing i have EVER tasted for breakfast. Every single person in the office asked me for this recipe. They were all so impressed, which made me feel so good that my dish was the biggest hit. The only thing i did differnt was used regular sausage instead of sage.

I had a brunch w/ 25 people and made two of these casseroles.  They were wonderful and I received many compliments and requests for the recipe!  Since the recipe didn't specify - I used a 9x13 pan.  I also used frozen hash browns so I didn't have to shred the potatoes!

Served this for Easter Brunch and it was a big hit.  I made a few changes.  As others previously stated, I pre-baked the hashbrowns for 45 min until they were just brown and crispy around the edges.  I also added red, yellow and green peppers to the  sausage while it was browning.  This was so delicious. Everyone loved it!

My 11 year old said "Mom you can make this any time". I did use frozen hash browns, used 8 large eggs instead of 6 jumbo added a bit of salt and pepper and cayenne pepper to the mix. I also prebaked the hash browns/ butter while the sausage cooked. I cooked the onions with the sausage when it was almost done to make sure they weren't too crunchy.  I have made this 3 times so far and it is my new "go to" recipe for egg bake. Thanks!!!!

This casserole is very good! I've made it a few times and it always turns out great. If your using your own shredded potatoes, you should definitely bake them a little before putting everything together, or they turn out kind of soggy..but even if it does it still tastes great. Frozen hash browns work just as good too :)

Excellent recipe.  I also did as other reviewers suggested and used more potatoes, more eggs and pre-cooked the potato for about 20 minutes.  I also added a little green pepper which really sent this over the top.  Will definitely make again.

I subtituted cream cheese for cottage cheese and cut the recipe in half (45 min in 8 in. square pan). Very yummy. I also baked the hash brown crust for 25 min before filling. Next time will use more hash browns, maybe 4 c. for the full recipe. Very filling, would work for dinner.

Everyone loved this and they had no idea that I made a healthy version.  I used 3 whole eggs and egg beaters.  I also used low fat cottage cheese and low fat cheese.  Instead of standard breakfast sausage I used turkey breakfast sausage.

This was great!  I used frozen shredded potatoes.  I cooked the onion with the sausage since I don't like crunchy veggies.  I used some colby jack along with chedder as I didn't quite have enough.  I think I would also add some pepper and salt to the mix or some type of seasoning, as I felt it needed it afterwards.  I might also add other veggies.  Everyone enjoyed it!  Thanks!

I made this casserole for my extended family on Christmas Day.  It fed about 5 adults and 3 teenagers with hearty appetites.  Not having made this before, I wondered how it would be received.  The pan was empty and my family was looking for more!  Delicious!

Absolutely fabulous!  Nice and hearty.  I made it for company and they wanted the recipe after one bite.

I make this all the time.  I has become a staple in my household.  Not only is it tasty but it goes a long way.  I make a casserole then we will heat up a slice or two for breakfast for days to come.  Great to have on hand for those busy school mornings.  I do cook the hash browns alone (w/ butter) to get them crisp for about 20-30 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I still cook it all together for an hour.  I also suggest sauteing the onions with the sausage.  I hope you like it as much as I do!

Hate bread sausage stratas!  Hate them so when I came across this recipe that uses potatoes instead of bread, I had to try it.  I liked this recipe but it didn't blow me away. I like to give the rating on the original recipe but when I make the recipe again, I'll alter it to my own taste.  So the next time I make this I will add some more spices (salt, pepper, paprika) and I'll use ham just to try something different. But I highly recommend that you try this recipe.  It is yummy and I agree with the recipe's creator.  It is a great dinner entree.

My husband and I loved this for dinner. Cooking is an art and some folks have trouble with the idea that everyone has different brush strokes. Make this as you prefer and quit whining about how you had to change it. SO WHAT.Good cooks do that as a matter of course.

Exactly what I was looking for: simple to put together and delicious! Made it a day ahead and cooked the next morning. I added diced red and yellow peppers with the onions and cooked them with the sausage. Perfect for brunch for a group!

This was great! I used the frozen hash browns with onions and peppers and added an extra egg like other reviewers said. Leftovers were just as good if not better. We had this for dinner and both my husb and kids loved it :) Can use any type of sausage flavor you like, not just sage.

I brought this to work for a brunch during the holidays and it was a huge hit.  I had several people ask me for the recipe.  The only thing I did different was use sharp cheddar instead of mild.  I made it again at Christmas and used frozen hash browns.  I made the sausage mixture except for the eggs the night before then refrigerated it and the frozen hash browns. The next morning I made the hash brown crust, added the eggs to the sausage mixture and assembled.  I had to cook it an additional 5-10 minutes but it made it quick and easy for the hectic morning.

I made two of these for a brunch my wife was serving to 14 neighbor ladies.  They loved it and most asked for the recipe.    For the record, I used sour cream instead of the cottage cheese (which I didn't have) and I don't think it had a negative impact.

I made this to the recipe and had the some of the same issues as other reviewers. I will use frozen hash browns instead and I think that will solve most of the problem I felt it was a bit oily.

Sooo good and easy!  I couldn't even tell that it had cottage cheese in it (the idea of hot cottage cheese turned me off a bit).  Feeds a huge crowd!

Subbed LF cottage cheese and LF shredded cheese, left out butter and it STILL came out fantastic. Added garlic powder and pepper.  Will definitely make again.

This is a really great recipe. I have been making it for about 2 years now when I have guests. If you make it exactly as written it is a bit too much onion for my taste. I have been halving it a lot recently and it works perfect in a 9x9 square pan with 4 eggs and 8 oz cottage cheese, everything else halved. I also use powdered onion instead of shredded most times. Everyone asks for the recipe!

this was as great as all the reviews said.  I made it for a big group of people and everyone raved about it.  I did as the reviews suggested and prebaked the potatoes for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  I also cooked up the sausage with the onions the night before and mixed it together with the rest of the ingredients to make the morning preperation easier.  I have passed it on to several people and will definately make again.

Because I apparently can't read, I put cream cheese in my batch of this casserole instead of cottage cheese. It was SOOOOOOO good. Loved this recipe!

This is the BEST!  I love it and make it all the time!  It is very easy.  I took the others suggestions and added a 4oz can of diced green chillies and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese, I also used a package of Simply Potatoes (Southwest flavor). It came out PERFECTLY!  UPDATE*  I have made this sooo many times and I have tried it many different ways and it is best the way it is written... cottage cheese and no green chillies.

FANTASTIC!  I do cook the frozen hashbrowns (O'Bien style) into the bottom of the dish (using the melted butter to coat), let cool on the stove top and then refrig. overnight - uncovered. The onion IS best cooked with the sausage and I also use 7 or 8 eggs and add a small can of green chilies.  Cook time has always been perfect.

My family loved this recipe on Christmas morning!  I never cook and this was easy!  I cooked the sausage and mixed it with all but the eggs the night before.  In the morning, I just lined the pan, mixed the eggs with the sausage mixture, and cooked!  I bet a mexican version would be stellar!

Made this for Christmas breakfast & I was NOT disappointed! It was just my husband and I, so I halved the recipe. I made a couple of minor modifications to suit our tastes. 

1. I seasoned the buttered potatoes with a few dashes each of salt, black pepper & sage. 2. I minced up some green onion and cooked it in with the sausage. 3. Added two extra eggs, since I was working with large and not the jumbo ones the recipe calls for.  

Will use this recipe again and won't wait for Christmas time to do it!

Made this for out of town guests, we all agreed it's the best breakfast casserole we'd had! I did use 8 eggs and cooked the sausage with the onion, added mushrooms and red bell pepper. Also cooked the potatoes alone while browning the sausage, about 20-25 minutes. Served 6 adults (many had two servings) plus some left-overs. Thanks so much for sharing!

This Is Straight Up A 5-Star Recipe! I Changed The Measurements A Little, Due To A Tinier Baking Dish. However, That Made NO Effect On The Outcome! It Was Absolutely Awesome! I Had 2 BIG Pieces For Dinner, & Cannot Wait To Have Another For Breakfast :D YUM!

This was the perfect breakfast for a large group who had really partied the night before. They all agreed it was the perfect hangover cure. Add some hot sauce, and it's absolutely delicious. The cottage cheese is a great way to bind it all together if you don't want to use heavy cream. LOVED IT!

Have made this 5-6 times. Sometimes use fresh potatoes - just grate and salt to reduce moisture. Also use frozen hashbrowns. Great either way. Family loves it and coworkers ask for the recipe. Easy to assemble the night before and just pop in the oven. Highly recommend. Have to keep the cottage cheese a secret or grandchildren will not eat :)

Delicious! To make things easier, I use Simply Potatoes, doubling the amount, and pre-bake for 30 minutes. I use 8 jumbo eggs and prefer maple breakfast sausage over the sage. Everyone I've served this to loves it!

Loved this recipe overall, but made a few changes.  I used O'Brien potatoes so didn't need to add the recommended amount of shredded onion. Like another reviewer, I baked the potato layer for 30 minutes and refrigerated overnight, then finished the dish the next morning. I also salted and peppered the egg mixture, and crumbled 1 pound of cooked bacon on top for additional flavor (this made it very pretty as well.) When I make it again, I will double the amount of sausage, as it seemed to have more potatoes than it needed, and although this might make the potato layer look a bit scant, I don't believe that would be a problem at all. This was very popular at my recent family gathering.

Great!  A little salt to preference and it really brought out the taste.

Good - dense, but satisfying. Good hangover casserole to make the night before a party.

This was fantastic!  I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions, such as precooking the hashbrowns "crust" for about 25 minutes, using 8 eggs and using 4 cups of hashbrowns instead of 3.  It was perfect!  We did have a few peppers added in for a little extra flavor.  My husband who doesn't typically eat eggs came back for THIRDS!  Will definitely be making this again!
Edit 2017:  Made this again with frozen potatoes O'brien to save time. Again, fantastic. Add salt and pepper, maybe some salsa after for a good kick.  Sure to please

This is great!  I have made it with both sausage and bacon... I followed what other reviewers said and did do 8 eggs instead of 6.  The frozen shredded potatoes are best when cooked for about 15 - 20 minutes before adding other ingredients.

I've never wrote a review for a recipe before but I felt I had to for this one. This truly is "THE BEST"! I made this for Christmas Eve morning, my newly married son & wife were visiting for the holidays. I have tried the breakfast casseroles with the cream soup cans and I didn't like them. You can make this one in the morning not the night before if you like. I did make some changes like some of the reviewers said...I used frozen hashbrowns (Simply Potatoes frozen)....I lined the pan w/ potatoes & butter and baked for 30 minutes and then poured the mixture in and baked for 30 additional minutes...it came out picture perfect! I used extra cheese (we Love Cheese) sprinkled on top. All I can say is it was FANTASTIC! And it tastes better after it sits awhile and tastes great micro-ed the next day! Everyone wanted the recipe! My college son wanted me to bake one so he could take it back to school! My picky MIL loved it too! She's actually thinking of different alternative ingredients to use as a dinner meal like chicken & mushrooms! THANKS FOR A GREAT KEEPER RECIPE!!

I decided to follow the recipe exactly (with the exception of using 8 eggs instead of 6 because my eggs were large, not jumbo), and I was pleased with the results. I used frozen hashbrowns. Next time I will add some mushrooms and peppers.

I used frozen shredded potatoes as others suggested and cooked the (mild turkey italian) sausage and onion mixture beforehand for Mother's day brunch. I baked the potatoes and butter for thirty minutes at 350 and added the egg mixture and cooked for 50 minutes more. Totally gone at the end of the meal. Served with a fruit salad.

This was very good and was a hit at the gathering I brought it to.  I was hesitant about making it due to the cottage cheese, but thought I'd trust the other viewers and truly, never noticed that it was an ingredient.  As with some of the other ratings, I cooked the thawed potatoes (I used a 32 oz pkg of OreIda shredded hashbrowns) in a skillet with a bit of olive oil, not enough to brown them, but just to cook/soften them a bit.  Since I used the whole package of potatoes, I added an extra egg and next time will probably add 2 extra eggs in total and as well as some additional sharp cheddar cheese.  We served this with a variety of hot sauces.

Super good.  I halfed the recipe and made it in a 8x8 dish.  I prepared it the day before and then baked it the next morning, turned out great.  This is a keeper.  THanks

excellent breakfast casserole.  I cooked the onions, sausage and some bacon, red and green bell pepper until tender.  Instead of making it in a 9x13 pan I used 2 glass pie pans (I had to add an extra cup of the simply potatos to cover sides and bottom of both) I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese salt, pepper, and 8 regular size eggs.  Made the night before, and baked in the morning.  Got rave reviews at my work breakfast meeting!

Honestly one of the best parts of Christmas this year.  We made two pans for  9 people and there was nothing left everyone went back for a second piece.  The potatos were very good in it.

I made this for a baptism luncheon (with muffins and fruit salad) and it was a big hit. I made it both "regular" and "spicy" (with green chiles and southwest style potatoes as other reviewers have mentioned). Since I needed this to be cooked when I got home from church, I pre-cooked the hashbrowns for 20 minutes at 350 degrees (mixed with the melted butter). I should have broiled it a few minutes to get them crispy, but they were done enough as is. Then I made the rest of the recipe, using 9 eggs per pan instead of the 6-8 others used. I also sub'd the ricotta cheese for cottage cheese. I did not season the regular casserole but did add coarse ground black pepper to the top of the spicy one so that guests could quickly see the difference between the two. I also saved a small amount of cheese (~1/4 cup) and sprinkled it on top. I then set the oven to start later in the day (a feature I've never used before!) at 350 degrees for 50 minutes. The casseroles were just finishing baking when we got home from church, and even pulled them out 5 minutes early because the edges were browning. Everyone loved them and went back for more. I served salsa with the spicy version. Enjoy!

This was very good!  I made this for Mother's Day brunch. I wasn't quite sure how cottage cheese would taste mixed with eggs and sausage but once served, it didn't last long.  I cheated by using packaged hashbrowns ("Simply Potatoes" in the refrigerated isle). I also cooked the onion with the sausage since my family isn't really fond of raw onions. I think next time I'll use sharp chedder for extra taste. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

The is a great casserole.  We usually have it for dinner with cut up fruit and it is very filling!  I'm too lazy to shred potatoes so I just use the freezer kind and defrost them in the microwave.  I also added green chilies to the egg mixture for a little kick.  Last night I made this and I didn't have any cottage cheese so I just added a little milk and it was still delicious!  Thanks Bill!

Unbelievably easy and so delicious!! I don't cook very much so the prep time for me was a little longer; mostly due to triple checking the directions, but I could not be happier with the outcome. 

I did modify the recipe ever so slightly -- adding some chopped kale and substituting the mild cheddar with sharp, for that little extra zing of flavor I enjoy.  

I could not believe something this good came out of MY kitchen!! My husband and I, who rarely eat second helpings of anything,  both raced back to the kitchen for more!! 

I will definitely be making this one again!!!

This is so delicious!  I have made it every year for our Christmas Breakfast.  I of course change it up to fit our taste, but even without the changes it is yummy!  I use Hot Sausage, and frozen diced hash browns with green peppers and red peppers added (Ore Ida);  add fresh sliced mushrooms, diced onions, rosemary, paprika, and a tad bit of garlic powder.  I also add mozzarella cheese along with cheddar cheese into the mix before pouring into pan, and I sprinkle even more yummy cheese over top after baking and return to oven until melted.  It's not to be added into anyone's diet plan, but once a year is worth this!

Excellent recipe I will make this again.  Made for an office pot luck and not a scrap left!  I used the fresh shredded potatoes from the market and I also added my own fresh herbs to the sausage.  Thank you this will come in handy for get togethers.

Really, really good. I had to make some adjustments to the recipe, only because we eat low sodium. I mixed regular bulk sausage with plain ground pork to lower the sodium content, I used no salt added cottage cheese, and reduced the amount of cheese in the recipe. This recipe held up very well to reducing salt content. Of course when you do that, you need to add back some flavor, so I added red and green peppers to the potatoes and served low sodium salsa on the side. Whether you eat low sodium or not, this recipe is a winner either way. Oh, one more thing. I made this for 9 servings, and baked in a 10 inch ceramic pie plate. No overdone corners and runny middle. Thanks again for the great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the suggestions about baking the hash browns a little first and cooking the onions with the sausage. I also used frozen hash browns. Otherwise, I did everything as is in the recipe. Big hit with my family.

Excellent! Great comfort food. I baked the potatoes first as some reviewers suggested, for 15 min. and then the whole casserole for 45 minutes. eight large eggs works well. The family loved it. A great recipe for guests too! Could be served for any meal of the day.

This was the first casserole recipe I've ever tried...it turned out really well. My changes: I made for 6 instead of 12; I used Gouda cheese and bratwurst (both are more local here in Holland than the cheddar and breakfast sausage) and tossed in red bell peppers. I also prepared everything the evening before, including half frying the shredded potatoes and then lining the bottom of the baking dish, and assembled on Christmas morning just before opening presents, so that by the time we were done, breakfast was ready!  Served with mushrooms lightly fried in butter and toast. Will definitely make again. Thx.

I've made this twice and it's gone over very, very well.  Neither time did I use cottage cheese and the second time I cut the cooking time to 45 minutes.  Now if my teenage boys would show appreciation for my efforts I would truly be happy.

Very good....DH "spiced" it up with some hot sauce but an excellent "starter" dish.  I do not like spicy so I would give it a 5.  Very easy and usually have all the ingredients on hand which is a huge plus.

I really enjoyed this dish. I microwaved 4 russets and allowed them to cook before shredding them and mixing w/ butter. I prebaked the potatoes for 30min.@ 350-375  before adding the egg mixture. I sauteed onions, added mushrooms and bell peppers, added a little salt to the potatoes and a little salt and pepper to egg mix and used 8 oz. of sharp cheddar instead of 12oz of mild. I baked @ 350 then 325 for 1 hour.  Dish set up well and tastes great with tomatoes.  Thanks William

Excellent base recipe! I followed others' recommendations, used 8 eggs, and pre-cooked the potatoes and onions. I diced the potatoes rather than shredded just because I didn't have my shredder on hand. The first time I made this (for a Friday in Lent) I omitted the sausage and added mushrooms and spinach. I also added a little salt and a bit of pepper. This was so great, my whole family was asking for the recipe! The second time I kept to the original recipe but added leftover spinach. Really really good, thanks!

I made this for my family on Christmas morning both last year and this year. I actually prepare the ingredients the night before and pop it in the oven first thing since it takes about an hour. Since I've only made it on Christmas it makes it more special. I didn't change the recipe at all and it came out perfect!

This was fabulous! I made it for dinner tonight. Unfortunately I didn't have onions, so left them out but threw in some chopped portobello mushrooms for texture and added the extra eggs as suggested. The family was very happy, next time I make it I will have the onions on hand, I really wouldn't change a thing, very good, thanks for posting!

Fantastic as-is, although next time I will get a little crazy and add green chilies. My family doesn't typically like quiche, breakfast bakes, etc...but they gobbled this up.

Love this recipe - it's our go-to dish for holidays and family brunch.  I tried it with the sage sausage first, but prefer regular sausage.  I also bake the hash browns for about 10 minutes to get them browning before I add the egg mixture.

I made this for a brunch and it came out well. As others have advised I used 8 eggs, frozen shredded hash browns and added green peppers. The consistency and flavors were great the only problem is that it was lacking salt and pepper. Next time I'll add bacon and pepper to the mix.

I served this for my Mary Kay brunch party and it was eaten up within minutes!!  I did however use large eggs and not jumbo ones, and left out onions, as I'm not a big onion eater.  I followed another reviewer and used the frozen hashbrowns instead of fresh.  I also used Honeysuckle turkey breakfast sausage. Definitely a keeper.

I have been searching and searching for a really good breakfast bake and this is so far my number one!  I don't understand why people change the recipe so much... if you do, then you're making a totally different bake and should just enter your own recipe!  I couldn't find the sage sausage so I just got regular Bob Evan's pork sausage.  I did add 8 large eggs since I didn't have jumbo eggs.  I also chose the O'brien frozen potatoes with the green/red peppers---it was SO GOOD!!!!

Delicious! I made this for a senior brunch. It was a hit with the teenage girls and their mothers. I used maple sausage and Ore Ida O'Brien Hash Brown Potatoes. I thawed the potatoes in the refrigerator overnight. I omitted the onion as the potatoes had onion and peppers mixed in them. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I followed suit and set my oven to 350 degrees. I used maple flavored sausage, rather than sage because it was on sale. I used the Ore Ida O'Brien hashbrowns with peppers and onions, pre-cooked that for 30 minutes. I cooked my sausage and onion together, added about 1/2 tsp. of oregano to the mixture. I used half mild cheddar cheese, half colby and monterey jack.     I'm sure this is a great recipe as is but I always have to put my own tweak on things and this is a great one to do it to, so many variations possible.     Superb! Everybody in my house loved it, even my picky 5 year old daughter.

This really is as good as all the comments suggest.  I made this for day-after-Christmas brunch for 8 hungry adults and by adding couple extra eggs, it was the perfect portion size for each person. I used "simply potatoes" as suggested by many and baked it separately for 20 min. prior to adding rest of the ingredients.   I added fresh sage & thyme to regular sausage (cause I couldn't find flavored) and, wow, the herb flavors really came thru.  I served this with a fruit salad with honey and lemon juice, pumpkin bread, and of course, Mimosa, and the brunch was a hit!  Thanks everyone for all the wonderful tips.

This was great! My picky kids even ate it. I was worried because they are not fond of cottage cheeses. It adds a creamy texture without an overwhelming taste. I did use frozen hash browns in an attempt to save time. They worked fine.

This is a an excellent recipe. I used red potatoes. I like ricotta instead of cottage cheese. The second time around I tried a sharper cheddar for more flavor. It overwhelmed it a little bit for me, but my husband liked the more intense flavor.

I confess to using frozen O'Briens Diced Potatoes with Peppers and Onions and frozen chopped onion but otherwise I stuck to the recipe exactly.  I made it on a Tuesday and froze it for breakfast, for nine people, on the following Thursday.  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again when I need to cook for a group.

I have been making this every year for a neighborhood breakfast party--always disappears. I always cook the onions with the sausage and fresh sage. To save time the morning of the party, I cook the sausage mixture a few weeks ahead of time and freeze this.  The night before the party I move it into the fridge, and it is ready to mix in with the other ingredients in the AM.  Yummy!

I also used used frozen hash browns. We loved this recipe! Don't let the cottage cheese scare you, we could not taste it and it added a nice texture to the dish. I'm making it for the fourth weekend in a row this weekend!

YUMMY!!  I made a lower calorie version and it was still wonderful.  I omitted the butter and sprayed the potatoes with Pam.  I used low fat cheese and fat free cottage cheese.  Also, I substituted 12 egg whites for the 6 whole eggs.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Used 1 bag Simply Potatoes Shredded Hash Browns (salted the potatoes), a bit more butter, 8 eggs, and buttered the 9x13 real well.  
Very pleasant taste, not greasy at all, but next time I'll add some cream, a litle too dry.

My first breakfast casserole! I was a little skeptical when pouring the mixture into the pan, but I was very pleased with the taste. I added an additional egg, and I used thawed,drained o'brian hash browns. I also baked the 'crust' for 30 mins before adding the filling. Will be making this again for special occasion.
Thanks for the recipe.

It's only been 2 weeks and my boyfriend has already requested this dish again.  I, like almost everyone else, baked the hashbrowns first.  I also added some beef bouillion granuals to the potato mixture for a little added flavor. I was pleasantly suprised how well it turned out the first time I made it.

I followed the recipe down to a T, and all it is just basically cheese omelet on top on sausage on top of hash browns, only it was a lot messier to make! Anything that has that amount of cheese would be just as good. You could exclude all other ingredients, and it would still taste almost the same. I doubt I would make it again.

It was an OK dish for breakfast, but not so good for dinner.

This was a huge success at my Bible Study Brunch!  Every lady came back for seconds!  Three things I did differently: 1. I baked the hashbrowns with peppers and onions for about 30mins before hand. 2. I used maple flavored sausage. 3. Used 9 large eggs.  I think my casserole took a little less than an hour to cook probably because the pan we already heated from baking the potatoes.  This recipe is a REAL WINNER!!

Made this for Christmas morning and it turned out great.  I did as some others suggested by browning the potatoes before adding the egg mix.  I used the Simply Potatoes Southwestern style and it gave the dish a nice flavor.  The only other addition was 1/4 cup milk.  I made the mixture the night before and it just looked to thick to me.  Also, I did add a little salt and pepper.  A keeper!!!!!!!

Yummy!  My husband and son came back for seconds! (So did I!)  I used frozen chopped onions and green and red peppers and threw them in with the pork sausage when it was almost done cooking. I only had aN 8 OZ. package of shredded cheddar and it was plenty.  I too used the fresh shredded potatoes and cooked the crust for about 20 min. before adding the sausage mixture.  It was just perfect.  Next time, I'll add mushrooms.  Very versatile recipe...thanks!  A keeper for sure!!

Yummy! Perfect for Christmas brunch. I've made this twice. The first time, I followed the directions exactly, and it came out nicely. The second time I baked the hashbrown layer first. It made a huge difference. I fed 5 adults on Christmas morning with this, and they all loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

Have made many of these, but this is the first one that comes out done every time.  Usually I have to really overbake, etc., to get the eggs in the middle done.  Not with this one.  I also use ham instead of the sausage just for ease.  Family loves it every week!

Was really good, and not overly dense. Did make few changes though..... Since the recipe did not mention adding seasoning, we added a little salt, pepper, and a touch of cayenne. Also minced some green bell pepper. Will definitely make again.

Like others, I read the reviews before attempting the recipe. We love mushrooms and green peppers, so I sautéed some along with the onions and used venison sausage. Also used a package of frozen spinach-thawed and squeezed the water out thoroughly.  I split the recipe between two casserole dishes, baked one and put the other in the freezer.  It will go in the rotation, per request of DH!

I seldom make "breakfast" type casseroles but while attempting to do the low carb thing with my diet...this recipe popped up in the search.  I made it with some changes that others suggested in their reviews...added a couple of eggs and cooked the onion with the sausage.  I used one package of the "Simply Potatoes" hash browns as the base as well.  I also added some gruyere cheese with the cheddar.  Not only was this casserole delicious last night for dinner...but it tasted just as great reheated this morning!  WIN.  Now I will put the leftovers in the freezer in single portions and see if the flavor manages the freezing process just as well.  All in all a stellar recipe which I recommend whole heartedly.  A hint on your cheese....grate it yourself, while this adds to the work a bit it will melt much more nicely.  Those pre-packaged grated cheeses often dry out a bit or have an ingredient incorporated that helps prevent sticking.

Favorite egg bake ever! I use frozen hash browns (o'brien - with the peppers and onions).  Bake them slightly the night before while I'm assembling the other ingredients. Once assembled I toss in the fridge till morning. We use turkey sausage and low fat cheeses.  Delish!!!!

Make this, you won't be sorry! Yes, use 4 cups frozen hash brown potatoes, and I added canned green chilis and some piquant peppers (chopped) from the grocery store salad bar that I wanted to use up. OMG ... two of us ate half the recipe for dinner last night and now I'm seriously considering having more for breakfast.

I've made this using this recipes for several years now. Love it! This year I did double the potatoes (which admittedly I buy already shredded in the refrigerated section at the store). This potato-loving family loved it even more! Thank you for the great, easy recipe!

I've made this recipe for school holiday events, and it never fails!   Sometimes I add some crumpled, cooked bacon in with the main mixture, and it is the best by far.  There are never any leftovers.

Twas a success!! I've combined a few of the reviews together:  Preheat oven to 375.  Add butter to pan (9X13) and let the oven melt the butter and brown it. Pull pan out add 4 cups of frozen shredded potatoes and put in oven for 40 minutes.  While that's cooking I cook the sausage with diced onion, diced bell pepper and diced mushrooms.  I strain all of that and get the juices out and let it cool off just a bit.  While that's cooling I beat 8 JUMBO eggs and mix in the shredded cheese and cottage cheese. Sometimes I'll add another smaller egg to make it a little more "wet".  By the time all this is done, I take the shredded potatoes out, mix the sausage/veggies into the eggs/cheese and pour the mixture over the potatoes.  I then put it back in the oven for additional 30 minutes.  Love it!  

It pairs nicely with a French Toast Casserole (make it the night before)

5 eggs lightly beaten
1 1/2 C. Milk
1 C. 1/2 and 1/2
1 t. vanilla
8 slices french bread cut into cubes
1/2 C. butter, softened
1 C. Light Brown Sugar
2 T. syrup
1 C. chopped pecans.

In a large bowl, whisk eggs, milk, cream and vanilla.  Put bread cubes in lightly greased pan ( 9x 13 or 2 qt casserole) and pour liquid over it.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.  In morning preheat oven to 350.  In small bowl combine butter sugar, syrup and pecans. Spoon over bread cubes.  

Bake in preheated oven until golden - about 40 minutes.  Let stand 5 minutes before serving.)

I made this casserole this morning, based on what others have tried. It was perfect. I used 4 cups of thawed hash browns and mixed them with the butter, then baked at 375 for 40 minutes. While they baked I cooked the sausage, chopped onion, and chopped bell pepper together. I mixed the beaten eggs with the cottage cheese and cheddar cheese, then added the cooled (a bit) sausage mixture. I added the egg mixture over the potatoes and baked another 30 minutes at 375. Perfect! Thanks for all the help, guys!

I made this recipe the first time for our Canadian friends. It was delicious and everyone asked for the recipe. The only thing I changed was I slightly brown the hash browns in the oven while I'm mixing the rest of the recipe. I basically mix one of the eggs, and 1/4 cup of butter and line the baking dish. Then after it's ready, I add the rest of the ingredients according to the recipe. It is great and I make it for any special occasion.

This turned out really good. The recipe is a good base to work with. I too, like other reviewers, used frozen hash browns and precooked them for 30 min in oven to get them a little crisp on the bottom. I didn't have sausage, but used bacon instead. I also added 2 extra eggs and seasonings that my family would like. We really enjoyed the texture and cheese flavor. I will definately be making this again and trying it with sausage too.

What a fun recipe with which to be creative!  No reflection on the original recipe, but I like to add my personal touch to anything I make, as probably do a lot of other cooks.  Just a great basic recipe that can be changed up with minor changes in the ingredient selection. After reading some of the many comments, may I make some suggestions for some to try:  Bland?  Use hot sausage.  Quick tip:  I have found frozen hash browns with the onion and peppers already in them.  Try different cheeses - swiss, for example.  Try different meat mixtures - maybe even Italian sausage.  Jut so many ways to change up this recipe.  Experiment, and have fun!  Five stars from me!  :)

My boyfriend loves this!  We don't modify it too much, just increase the number of eggs to 8, use hot Jimmy Dean sausage (found in meat section), frozen onions (cooked w/ the sausage in a frying pan on the stove), and we add S&P.  Our potatoes are the frozen hash browns... next time might try O'Brien as others have mentioned.  I partially defrost the frozen hash browns in the microwave, then transfer to the oven (w/ butter and S&P on top).  Cook for a little while (20 min/30 min) and then stir together so the butter is spread around.  This past time we cooked in an 8x8, it took a long time to cook because it was so thick (like an hour and a half) so next time might make it in a 9x13.  This is great reheated!  We have probably made this a half dozen times by now.  It's a keeper!

Not bad, but a bit bland, and I used onion powder (we don't do onions much in our house), garlic powder, and salt and pepper both with the eggs and the hash browns.  I also, as did others, baked the hash browns separately before adding in the egg.  I did use homemade shredded potatoes--it gave me an excuse to use my new KA shreder attachment.  :)  In my experience, however, I usually have to bake potatoes much longer than most recipes indicate.  I baked them the night before for 30 mins, then this morning poured the egg over and baked for almost an hour.  This worked well.  Our only complaint, as I said before, is that it's still somewhat bland so we used ketchup.  I'd add more spices next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a GREAT recipe... AS is. You need not change anything whatever.. and fresh shredded potato is always and is much tastier with far more substance than ...excuse me...>FROZEN hashbrowns!!!!! IF you want a great sausage casserole ...that is what this is... Bon Appetite cause it`s delicious.

Seemed like a lot of cheese, but the end result was very good.  I ended up adding 2 eggs, about a tablespoonn of sour cream and a tablespoon of minced jalapeno.

Excellent! We have used this recipe countless times! It was great on Christmas morning. I used 8 large eggs instead of 6 jumbo. I also didn't use any onion.

Made this for Easter Brunch and the family just loved it.
I used 4 cups of frozen hashbrowns thawed. Added a little seasoning salt and pepper to them and pre-baked them for 15 minutes as others have suggested. I used regular bulk breakfast sausage browned well, about 8 oz of freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese and 8 large eggs in the filling. Baked for an additional 45 minutes and removed from the oven. Added about 2-3 oz additional cheddar cheese on top and covered with foil. Let rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. Excellent flavor and texture.

This was different than the usual breakfast casserole I make and we loved it!   I used 4 cups of shredded potatoes and 8 jumbo eggs instead of 6. I also used hot style breakfast sausage instead of the sage flavored.   We will definitely be making this again. 10/19/13 I have made this many times and I am now using thawed OreIda hashbrowns.  They taste the same as using the fresh and save me a lot of time.  I also add a little seasoned salt to the potatoes and bake for 20 minutes by themselves.  I then add the egg mixture and bake another 40 minutes.  Perfect every time.

This was so delicious!  I don't like cottage cheese but used it anyway & loved it.  A few modifications - used 8 eggs total and only 8 oz cheese & 2 tbsp butter, it was finished cooking in 45 minutes.  So good!!

This was a very good casserole.  I too baked the potato layer with additional salt and pepper, prior to adding the egg and sausage mix.  However, I made this in a smaller pan because the 4 cups of potatoes didn't cover a 9x13 pan (maybe 7 x 11).  I used 8 large eggs, instead of the 6 jumbo, as others had recommended.  Because I used a smaller dish, I baked the egg mixture for 45 minutes in a 375 degree convection oven.  The next time, I will only use 6 eggs and reduce the baking time.  I also added red pepper to the sausage and onion mixture.  The next time I would use red and green peppers because it would be pretty for Christmas.  I used the cottage cheese too, instead of ricotta.  This is a good basic recipe that you can modify to fit everyone's tastes.

AMAZING & sooooooo easy!!! Made it for Christmas breakfast & it will now be our annual tradition. RAVE reviews & kitchen smelled wonderful! 

Slight changes... I used frozen hash browns - 4 c. instead of 3. 8 eggs instead of 6. Cooked the onions with the sage sausage. Added 1/2 a red bell pepper & 1/2 a yellow bell pepper, chopped, to the potato mixture. Cooking time & temp as shown.

What a great casserole.  Only modification was to use plain, reduced fat sausage rather than sage flavored.  The cottage cheese adds such a delicious, creamy texture.  I definitely will make it again and may try adding some chiles or something for little spice.  But absolutely delicious as written.

Used 8 eggs and added 1/2 bell pepper chopped per other reviews. Also pre-baked the hashbrown mixture for a bit to get a little crispy then poured the egg mix over the top and baked for the full time. AWESOME! New family fave!

This is the BEST Sausage Casserole I've ever ate. I've been making this since last summer, it is always a hit. I like to add a couple more eggs and is easily adjustable. FABULOUS! My family and friends thank you.

Excellent recipe - my guests all had 2 and 3 helpings :).  Followed the recipe as closely as possible using reviewing advice to brown potatoes, sautee the onions and use additional eggs (9 large eggs initially).  Here what I discoverd. - Used Simply Potatoes - Sotuhwest Seasoned was all that was left at the store - preseasoned added a nice flavor. - Only had 2 square pans available so increased proportionally - used 4 cups of potatoes.  Forgot to add the butter to the potatoes and added after 10 minutes by drizzling.  Left in a total of 20 (which is NOT enough..) -Added diced leftover ham and one additional egg to 1 pan - this slightly eggier version was definitely better -When reheating them today I used a fry pan and ended up actually browned the potatoes - WOW a nice difference!! Next time I am going to leave the potatoes in the oven until they are truly BROWN - excellent flavor. However recipe was still great even with the lesser cooked potatoes - the browned ones just added a extra touch - but I love all fried potatoes soo.... This recipe has infinite possibilities can't wait to try a vegetarian version as per a previous review.

The only thing I would suggest would be to cover with foil for 45 min and then take off the foil during the last 15 min to get a lightly browned surface. Next time I would like to try a little smaller casserole dish to get a higher casserole. I used diced ham which was extremely good. Like the hint of browning the potato bottom first and using 4 cups of  O'brien(w/ peppers & onions) hash browns (frozen or the fresh which is what I used)  All n' all I would do this again. Now I have my Christmas brunch recipe! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Discovered at the last minute that guest of honor at brunch was a vegetarian! So, instead of sausage, sauteed mushrooms & garlic. Added pre-thawed frozen spinach to mushrooms- Did the potatoes exactly as recipe. Added mushroom spinach mix to eggs plus the onion, chopped red pepper, 1 jalapeno & finally some smokey paprika with chipotle peppers. Cottage cheese is hard to find here in Spain, so used cream cheese with the cheddar instead. My meat-eating friends all demanded the recipe as well as the vegetarian, so if anyone wants a veggie version this can be a start! Truly delicious

I made this today for Father's Day and it was delicious! I sautéed the onions with the sausage to soften them up, and added a bit of broccoli and spinach for some colour (would have added red pepper but inlaws are not a fan). Next time I will add a bit more potato, but that is only a personal preference. I need an excuse to make this again!

I made exactly as directed, the only difference being is that I assembled everything the night before, and just increased the cooking time by about 30 minutes because it was cold from the fridge.  Made this for some girlfriends who stayed the night, and everyone loved it!!  Very filling, and reheated well too.

This was so easy and delicious.  The only change I made was to use 7 large instead of 6 jumbo eggs and used frozen hash brown potatoes thawed in microwave. It is very convenient to be able to put this together in the morning instead of having to do it a day ahead of time too.

This was amazing! I've been searching for a recipe like this to add to my repertoire. I made this for Christmas brunch and it will be a new tradition! I did follow others advice and added onion and green pepper to the sausage and cooked them together. I also prebaked the hash brown crust for 30 minutes as others suggested. Thanks!

I made this the night before so I could pop it in the oven Christmas morning and it is a great recipe. The only thing I changed was I used beef sausage and it was awesome! Our whole family loved it. It will be a regular recipe in our home.

We really like this recipe. The flavors are excellent. It would be a great dish for a brunch or to take to the office. The only thing I change is to bake the potato crust on its own a bit to get it to crisp up and brown a little before adding the rest of the ingredients. In our oven, this casserole cooks in about 50 minutes, not the full 60 like the recipe states.

Use SEVEN eggs and you can definitely chop the onion.  Buy a bag of shredded Simply Potatoes (non frozen) at the grocery and use that.  So good, a huge hit :)

I made two substitutions in this recipe.  I used ham instead of sausage and shredded mozzarella cheese instead of the cottage cheese.  It was very good.

This is excellent!  I'm a new cook, so take what I say with a grain of salt (so to speak!)  I made this for a potluck at work, and it was gone before anything else on the table.  I found out at the last minute that my cottage cheese was bad, so I substituted sour cream, which, apparently, was fine!  I also addedd grated bell pepper for some extra flavor and color.  Plus a bit of hot pepper sauce.  I did cook the potatoes and butter for 30 minutes prior to adding the other ingredients, as others suggested.  I will say, the butter does not mix well if you grate the potatoes the night before and refrigerate them.  Next time I will plan differently, and probably butter the pan, like some suggested.  Also, I will add fresh black pepper next time.  Definitely, there will be a "next time", though!  (also, I used 8 eggs and sharp cheddar cheese!)

I have made this for numerous brunches and potlucks, and everyone always wants the recipe!  It is delicious and very quick to throw together.  I do saute the onions with the sausage, though, as I am afraid of getting a raw onion taste.

I've made this twice, and am waiting for another dish of it to finish baking right now.  It is the best breakfast casserole on this site.  I made it the 1st time for guests, and all told me it was delicious and  a few asked for the recipe.  All the flavors mix well together while they are in the oven, and it comes out a cheesy, flavorful, hearty meal.  The shredded potatoes mixed with the butter makes a perfect crust.  I never add any other veggies, and I think bell pepper would add a contrasting flavor, however I haven't tried it. It's a meal all by itself, no need for any other meats or breads to go along with it.  Enjoy!

We enjoyed this one!  I was nervous b/c my husband and I don't really like cottage cheese (I used low fat small curd) but you don't really taste the cottage cheese at all.  I highly recommend pre-baking the hash brown crust.  I did at 350 for about 20 mins and should have done it for longer until it was really nice and golden.  Once I put the filling in, I cooked it for about 45 mins on 375.  Turned out great!

This was delicious!  I used southwestern style hash browns (in the refrigerated section) to add some kick.  This only took 30 minutes to cook for me, I did, however, change a couple things.  I did use the refrigerated potatoes instead of frozen.  Also, once I pressed the potatoes/butter in the pan, I put it in the oven while I finished browning the sausage and mixing together the egg mixture.  The cottage cheese I bought for this recipe was spoiled so I just left it out and added a little more cheese.  Added fresh spinach to egg mixture for some yummy super food.  It was great!

delicious!  and just as delicious re-heated.  My husband ate almost half of it the day I made it. Very easy and the only thing I added was a dash of dry mustard.

YUM! This is definately a keeper. Perfect for dinner & holiday mornings. I am for sure going to share this recipe with my family (SO much better than my sister's breakfast casserole)
**I used low fat sausage and it still turned out great!

I recently made this, and my in-laws were so impressed! I modified it slightly, using 7 eggs instead of 6, and using about 4 cups of frozen hash browns (which I had defrosted). I also used low-fat cottage cheese and added some chopped green pepper to the eggs. It was delicious, and I'll definitely make this again!!

I really loved this one. The potatoes had a great flavor, the cheesy texture was delish, and it was easy to cut. I made this the night before and baked in the AM. It was marvelous!

Yummy! This is a great casserole. I was a little worried about the cottage cheese, as my family members are not fans of cc, but we all loved this! I didn't have any left over as everyone went back for seconds or thirds. Great for a brunch.

This is by far my favorite breakfast casserole ever!  I made it exactly according to the recipe, and I loved it, and my husband who doesn't really feel one way or another about food, actually said he loved it.

Halved the recipe, and it still didn't get finished at our house.  Dryer than I like, and just ok flavor.  I've tasted a lot of these breakfast casseroles at MOPS meetings, and this one just didn't impress me.

I sauteed an onion, garlic and bell pepper together with the sausage the night before like other reviewers have suggested. Not only was this really tasty, but it cut down preparation time the next morning. I used frozen hash browns, which I pan fried before putting everything together. Next time, though, I will bake and use freshly grated potato instead. YUMMY recipe; thanks for sharing!

very good! used fresh shredded store bought hash browns for the crust and found that prebaking  these is not necessary. They sort of started to burn around the edges toward the end of the hour of baking the casserole.  Increased the egg to 8 as mine were just large. Came out very nice and was tasty.  will certainly make again.

This was yummy, I think the cottage cheese makes the whole recipe.  I used frozen shredded potatoes, fried them in a pan for a little while then put them in the pan.  I forgot to add the butter, but I didn't miss it.  I might try tater tots in place of potato next time.

Delicious! Excellent, although I changed things a bit. I don't like sausage so I used bacon and didn't have cottage cheese so I used some sour cream.  Used frozen shredded potatoes and fried them for awhile before adding to the butter and allowed it to bake a little while in the oven.  This made for a crunchier crust. Mixed onions in with the potato layer and added them and diced chilis in the potatoe mixture.  Used a cheddar/monterey mix. Served with sour cream and salsa; wonderful! Hubby and I almost ate the whole dish but we decided to save some today for breakfast. Will definitely make again!

We loved this breakfast casserole!!

I was not so sure about the cottage cheese and almost did not make this dish because myself and other members in the family dislike cottage cheese.  But I have to say I am glad I overlooked it! This is delicious and you couldnt even taste the CC just the cheddar!! I am sooo glad I made it! And this dish will be an occasional Sunday morning favorite in my house!!

When I made this recipe, I was worried about the cottage cheese in it.  My husband and son don't normally eat cottage cheese.  I didn't say a word about it and they both LOVED this casserole!  It is definitely a keeper!  I like it better than the one I have made for years and years.  We all loved the hash brown crust.  I used frozed hash browns and pre-baked them as suggested in other posts.  This is a wonderful recipe!

I really like this recipe a lot and it is really popular with my family.  I tend to like things with a little kick to it as some of the other reviews stated.  Simply Potatoes also sells a Southwestern style of hashbrowns and they are really good with a little spice to them.  Not hot but just a little something without having to add a lot of salt, etc.  Also, I have added mushrooms and peppers (saute with onion and sausage) to this as well and sometimes serve it with salsa on the side.  Really, you can do just about anything to it that you want...it's pretty versatile.

I've made this 4 or 5 times now and I like it, but I can't get the potatoes right.  They taste soft and damp and take on all the egg.  I think I'll try pre-baking the potatoes next time.  We add a healthy squirt of hot sauce in with the eggs and then serve it with fresh fruit and hot rolls from the oven.  Even with the potatoes not crisping up, my family prefers this to the bread casserole breakfasts!

This recipe rocks.  I made it for mothers day and the whole pan was scarfed down.  Was a little leary with no spices but I followed the recipe (used sharp cheddar instead of mild) and it was fantastic.  Glad I didn't add any extra salt.  Thanks.

WONDERFULLY EASY TO PUT TOGETHER.  USE THE "SIMPLY POTATOES" IN THE REFRIDGERATOR SECTION.  I ALSO ADDED CHOPPED GREEN CHILI. IT CAN BE SERVED HOT OR COLD; FOR BREAKFAST, BRUNCH, SUPPER OR SNACK. TASTES GREAT, AND HAS BEEN A HIT WITH EVERYONE.  A BEAUTIFUL DISH THAT WILL GET THE COOK MUCH DESERVED ATTENTION.

I have used this recipe every since William Rossbach posted it.  I use it every time I have overnight company and I want to serve them something great. Don't change anything.  You can add anything you want,veggies, mushrooms, other meats but it is great as is. You might need to adjust the time cooked or the oven temp. but that is just a difference in oven temps. If you change anything you still need to give this recipe a 5 star because you changed it so you don't know how his recipe really taste. There is no way to ruin this recipe. I have cooked longer, shorter, used different ingredients, doubled it.  The thing I really love about this recipe is you can fix it the day before and pop it in the oven before guest get up.  When they are ready you are ready. Great recipe....

Great recipe!  Very tasty, easy to prepare. My family loved it, including my children.  The only thing was it took longer than 1hr. to cook through.  So, if you are making it, plan on a longer cooking time.  My french toast that I served it with was done a LONG time before my casserole, but all-in-all I would recommend it and will make it again.  It would be great for a luncheon and/or a brunch also.  It makes a large amount.

I love this recipe! I often make it on the weekend and  eat leftovers for breakfast during the week. The only thing I change is adding more eggs. I usually use 10-12 eggs. This makes the dish a little more substantial. Great recipe!

I added red peppers and mushrooms. I used frozen cubed hash browns instead of shredded. I prebaked the potatoes from frozen for about 20 mins before adding the sausage mix. Turned out great!

Loved this recipe!  As others recommended I baked the hash brown crust first to just browning then added the egg mix and finished baking.  Also made my own "sausage" using recipe from another review (tyvm).  1 lb ground beef, 2 t ground ginger, 2 t ground sage, 1/2 t pepper, 3/4 t salt, pinch of cayenne pepper.  This casserole was a huge hit for a group of 12 kids.  Will definitely make this again.

I make a large batch in a 9 x 13 pan with 10-12 eggs, increasing the shredded potato amount, keeping the sausage amount the same, with less cheese (6-8 oz for all of it).  Very good, I make this for dinner sometimes.

I've been making this recipe every Easter and Christmas for 3 years now and I finally printed the recipe because I am always looking for it. The things I do differently are cook the onions with the sausage and use 8 eggs. It is so, so good and have not yet come across a better breakfast casserole in my life. Thank you for this delightful recipe!

Absolutely awesome! I've never been much for cooking but I've been attempting to broaden my horizons a little bit and this recipe was one of my first tries at something new.  It was simple to make and it's incredibly tasty.  I used fresh potatoes and ground them, as well as the onions, in a food processor to make for a smoother consistency.  For the sausage, I used a one-pound sausage log which, I think, works better than sausage links or patties which would then have to be ground up.  Although the cook time says one hour, with a well pre-heated oven mine was done at 45 minutes.  We ate this for dinner but it would easily work as a breakfast, brunch or lunch item.

As other reviews have said bake the hashbrowns with butter for 30 minutes and then add the other ingredients and bake for 30 more minutes. I added 3 roasted pablano peppers from my freezer and it was great!  Definitely will make again.

Overall, I think this recipe makes a good template for a sausage casserole and would make it again with a few tweaks "to taste". As it is, it is a little bit on the bland side, great for pickier eater though so if there are people eating who like milder flavors, this is great. I made a few changes to test try and found I like the more robust flavor better. I used sharp cheddar instead of mild cheddar. I also sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top to make a crust. I increased the recipe to 8 eggs with a pre-baked the potato shell as previous reviewers suggested with shredded hash browns. I also added diced green and orange bell peppers. By mistake I bought a pineapple cottage cheese and had my daughter measure and add that ingredient. She put half of the amount in before I realized the mistake and ended up substituting the other half of the cottage cheese with plain Greek yogurt. The basic recipe is pretty forgiving, and to cut the sweetness of the pineapple, I added a little dash of hot sauce. This version turned out pretty spectacular. As I said, the original recipe is a good starter template for a custom sausage casserole. I just like a brighter flavor. I would suggest adding fresh herbs to garnish.

Made this for Xmas morning, was easy (love easy) and pretty good. One of the kids had 3 helpings I believe, and the picky daughter had 2. I didnt have small curd cottage cheese, so I used the large curd, turned out well.

I am eating This. Right. Now. My sister has made it a few times and each time I can't stop eating it! SO delicious. She made the recipe exactly as written, except she bought hash browns "Obrien" (diced potatoes with the peppers in it). I only logged on here to save this in my recipe box, but thought I'd review it as well. One of the best breakfast casseroles I've ever had. You cannot go wrong with this one.

This came out great!  Cooked the sausage with the onions the night before, but put everything else together the morning of.  Added some salt, pepper and garlic salt and used 4 cups of hash browns.  Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was pretty delicious! This is what I did - considering the reviews and the original recipe; with some modifications - I took 1 pound of lean ground beef and cooked it on a skillet with half of a sliced onion. I added some sage, paprika, a bit of spice (I added a bit of cajun spice - just to make it spicy and mimic "sausage"). I preheated the oven and put frozen shredded potatoes in a casserole dish; mixed it with the melted butter (just melted half of the amount of listed butter in recipe in microwave for 30 seconds) and popped it in the oven to let the potatoes crisp up before adding the egg mixture. I added 8 eggs (instead of 6, per reviews) and ADD salt and pepper - it was not mentioned in original recipe. I used cottage cheese - I thought the texture was great in the end result. I used a four-cheese shredded cheese. I baked it for 45 minutes - pierced a fork through the middle; you'll be able to tell it's cooked because everything is smoothly browned. Make sure to salt and pepper the shredded potatoes as well - I did not, and the was the only thing I could say was "off." It was AWESOME though!! Super good recipe! **You could make a healthier version if you added some green pepper, red pepper to the onion when browning the beef. You could also cut down the butter listed in the recipe and just make sure there's enough to coat the bottom. Also - drain the meat after (you could sub the meat. with ground turkey!)

This was a very good recipe.  Taking the advice of others, I chose to tweak it by 9 x 12 glass casserole dish spraying it with cooking spray. Then I shredded a block of sharp cheese (16 oz.), browned and crumbled 1 lb. maple flavored sausage, cracked 12 large eggs and beat them, added 1 teasp salt, 1 teasp. dry mustard, 16 oz. of small curd 4% cottage cheese, and 3 cups of hash browns with onions (or half a bag of frozen hash browns - but defrosted).   Mixed altogether, and baked uncovered for 1 hr.15 min, until the eggs were done (set), in the middle.  Used as breakfast for a group of men camping out, and they loved it. Could serve with hot sauce, salsa or catsup, but very good just plain. Very tasty warmed up.

Fantastic recipe, seriously so good. Every time I make it, I'm surprised! The only changes I make is only 2 tbls of butter in the potatoes and I add whatever veggies I have on hand into it. Perfect as written though. Make sure you thoroughly drain & press your potatoes!

I used 93% lean hamburger for this rather than sausage, and it was truly delicious!  I even used non fat cottage cheese and non fat cheddar and it was still great.  We love this for breakfast, lunch or dinner!  Thank you.

I used 10 large eggs and frozen shredded hash browns. It was a super hit with my family!  I put the hash browns and butter in the prepared pan and heated in the oven until butter was melted and potatoes were thawed. I stirred the potatoes and butter together and spread them out before adding the egg mixture.  Cooked in about 45 min and disappeared quickly.

I first made this in 2008, and it's been the only breakfast casserole I make ever since. I do fry up my potatoes before I add them, though. And sometimes I'll use fried tater tots instead. But even just following the recipe, it's a winner.

Very yummy! I used Italian sweet sausage, ricotta instead of cottage cheese, mozzarella and parmesan in place of cheddar, and onion powder instead of fresh onion. I combined all of the ingredients with a bag of frozen diced potatoes and a few more spices (garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne) and baked it up. My kids liked it so much they said they would eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert!

we love this... easy to make ahead and pop in the oven in the morning.  I used 12 large eggs and only 8oz of shredded cheese, everything else just as written.  I do not pre-bake the "crust". Also, even straight from the fridge, it bakes in less than time than the recipe states.  Use this often when we have company and want a hearty breakfast without a lot of fuss and mess in the morning.  Everyone who tries it, loves it and asks for the recipe.  Holds up great to being stored as individual servings for busy mornings.

Great recipe for any meal. Did add 8 large eggs. Cottage cheese was perfect and did bake the potato crust for 30 minutes at 350 first and then added the egg/sausage mix. Baked 55 minutes at 350 and came out wonderful. Also add salt/pepper/garlic powder to the eggs (1/4 tsp).

Just tried this recipe and it is the BEST one I've had yet! Small changes: took other suggestions and used eight eggs, also I used southern style hash brown frozen potatoes because that's all I could find, and added diced green and red peppers (about half a pepper each). I also sauteed the onions and peppers in with cooking the sausage, drained it, then layered on top of the potatoes, then poured the egg/cheese mixture over everything. Thank you for such a good recipe, and thank you to those who said "don't leave out the cottage cheese"! Personally I hate cottage cheese (and prob would have left it out), but after reading so many reviews that warned not to, I decided to go with the recipe. I already plan on making this again for our Christmas morning, to go with my home made cinnamon rolls (also from all recipes: cinnamon rolls 111) they too are the BEST! Thanks again!

Absolutely fantastic.  I've made other breakfast casseroles from this site before and this one is the best.  The cottage cheese gives it a totally different texture but not flavor.  Much better than the egg/milk combination.  I used 10 eggs and added mushrooms and sweet pepper, but those were my only changes.  Do not change a thing -- just add to it.  You will not be disappointed.

This was a perfect Sunday breakfast for a weekend at our cabin. I substituted potatoes O'Brien in stead of shredded potatoes. Also added crunchy bacon bites. Delicious!!

This is the best breakfast casserole I've eaten yet, and I've eaten a lot of them. It's easy and fairly cheap to put together, and my husband and 6-year-old eat it with gusto every time I put it in front of them. We eat it more for dinner than we do for breakfast! Highly recommended; this one is going to the top of my go-to list.

This is a really great recipe base. Like other reviewers I made some changes and used a lot of them already suggested. I added mushrooms, green pepper and 10 eggs instead of 6 (I know 8 was also suggested but with the added ingredients, I needed more eggs), sharp cheddar cheese and I added about a tsp of salt and a tsp of garlic salt. I sauted the green pepper, onion and mushrooms before adding them to the egg mixture. Since I live in the UK, the frozen shredded hash browns aren't readily available here. Instead I used a bag of patty hash browns (like the ones you can get at McDonalds), fried them and smashed them up. It worked really well! I may try it again with the shredded potatoes but I'm liking my accidental discovery.

Good for Christmas/ Thanksgiving morning. The recipe needed a few more eggs, and I added a little salt and a lot of pepper.  I also sauteed the onions before adding them.

My family and I absolutely loved this, and it was easy to make.  I used spicy sausage, and next time I think I will add some diced red and green peppers to spice it up a little more.

This recipe is EXCELLENT.  You had me at "sausage and egg."  A few modifications - Used 7 jumbo eggs, added chopped onion and green pepper to potatoes.  Like other people, I used frozen potatoes and that was fine.  I did not use ANY butter, just sprayed the pan with butter flavored non-stick spray and it was perfect.  Like others did, I cooked the potatoes onion and pepper for about 25 min before pouring the egg/cheese/sausage mixture on top.  This was so wonderful in every sense - smell, taste and it looks good too.  The egg part has the consistency of a quiche so next time, I might toss in some broccoli and bake it in a pie shell.  This makes a full pan, so you'll have lots to share.  This recipe is a keeper!

Fantastic - I shredded the onion with the food processor before the potatoes.  Added a bit of onion to the crust.  Baked the crust for 1/2 an hour by itself.  Added the rest.  It was awesome.  My two picky kids didn't even ask for ketchup, and my picky husband who usually eats only a little had FOUR peices!  A win all around!

A winning recipe with the whole family - from the one year old all the way to dad!  Make this with cottage cheese with chives.  Great flavor, easy and healthy!!  I typically use frozen shredded potatoes.

On Saturday night around 7pm I remembered I had to take something for a Sunday School breakfast the next morning.  Since I was already out and near a grocery store I googled and found this recipe. I was short on time and it was getting late so I opted for frozen hash browns, but I let them thaw before using, and changed nothing else on the recipe.  I made it that night (it was so easy), stored it in the fridge and cooked it the next morning.  It was a hit with not a bite left!  I had 3 people ask me for the recipe before Sunday School was over!  This will be my "go to" breakfast casserole from now on!

I'm not a big fan of breakfast casserole.
But this was good. I enjoyed it a lot.
Small changes
-sauted onion with sausage.
-Prebaked potatoes in butter.
-(Had no cottage cheese, so) used cream cheese instead.
-(Had no jumbo eggs, so) used 8 large eggs

Overall this was rather good, but it needed salt and we topped it with salsa for some more flavor. We did taste it before adding those things, so it wasn't like we didn't try it the way it was supposed to be. I will make it again, but will add salt before it bakes and have the salsa handy.

This was really good! Granted, it's loaded with calories, so that may be why! I made it EXACTLY like the recipe said and took it to a volunteer breakfast. Everyone raved over it and asked for the recipe. It was so easy that I'll definitely keep it on hand when I need to feed a crowd.

My family loved it with a few changes. Several will not eat cottage cheese, so I baked the hash browns for 15 min while browning the sausage with onion. Drain and spoon on top of hot potatoes. Then I used 8 large eggs beaten with 1/2 pint of milk, salt, pepper, dash of red pepper and paparika. Mix in 1/2 the cheese. This mixture was poured over the potatoes and sausage. The rest of the cheese on top. I baked it covered at 375 for 40 min then uncovered for last 20 min. Let cool for 5 min before serving.

LOVED THIS! I did however use cream of mushroom soup in place of the cottage cheese because my family does not like cottage cheese. I had considered using sour cream but didn't have enough, may try it next time. 6 eggs was just right for my casserole and I used frozen hashbrowns. Will make this again.

This recipe earned rave responses when I served it at my women's breakfast meeting.  I didn't make any changes, but I purchased frozen shredded potatoes and let them thaw instead of shredding 3 cups of potatoes.  It is great and easy recipe!  Five stars for sure.

This is my go to recipe for a crowd for breakfast or brunch.  It's okay to use frozen shredded potatoes.  If you also serve other things, like English muffins and fruit, it easily serves 15-18.

We made this recipe with 8 jumbo eggs and had tabasco sauce on the side.   It was delicious!

I added more potatoes just because we had them, along with some salt and pepper and extra butter mixed in with the potatoes.  
I mixed it up in the evening and popped it in the oven in the morning.  What an easy way to start our Christmas morning!  This was absolutely wonderful, and I can't wait for an occasion when I can make it again.

Made this per recipe although I did use frozen hash browns. Used for tailgating and it was a hit. Will definitely keep this recipe.

Yummy!  I wound up ditching the cottage cheese (I hate it) and used 10 eggs, some milk, and added ham and extra cheese.  I used the suggestion to cook the hashbrown crust first and it all turned out awesome!

I made this casserole as Kassie had suggested frying the frozen hash brown's w/onion first. For extra kick (this recipe is somewhat blah) I served diced canned tomatoes with green chilies, on the side. Ya gotta try it!! Sandy

I love this recipe, have made it several times.  I make exactly as said, but use a bag of fresh hashbrowns.  I have also used egg substitute, low fat cottage cheese, low fat cheddar and chicken sausage and it turns out awesome, my husband loved it too.

This is an amazing brunch dish that my whole family loves.  I made it first for Christmas morning and I have made it twice since.  I also decided to cook the potatoes a bit first, so I prepare them in the dish and season with some seasoning salt and fresh black pepper and pop them in the oven while I prepare the rest of the ingredients.  Very yummy!!

I followed the suggestions of several commentors and used ricotta in this recipe with great results.  The only thing I would do differently next time is bake the hashbrown crust for a bit longer before adding the egg mix.
**Editted to add**  The second time I made this I used cottage cheese, and found that I prefer the ricotta.  Also, I added some chopped fresh spinach and a couple of seeded diced tomatoes and it was great.

I did the 8x8" pan version.  Half the recipe with 2 cups potatoes & 4 eggs.  I also added 1/4 cup of tri-cut peppers (green, yellow & red).  I used regular sausage and next time I'll try Sage.  It was EXCELLENT and done at 55 mins.  I will try doing the potatoes seperately as suggested by other reviewers next time.  We topped with with a dash of Franks Red Hot because it needed some seasoning.  This will feed 4 people.

I too thought this recipe was great with a few minor adjustments.  I used 3/4 of a bag of Ore-Ida hash browns as the crust.  I cooked them according to directions and lined the bottom and sides of the casserole dish.  Made the egg mixture the night before so I could just pour and cook in the a.m.  Had some left over bacon from the day before so I broke that up and sprinkled on top of the casserole before cooking.  Had to add about 20 mins. to the cook time.....but it turned out fantastic and everyone loved it!

I served this for Christmas breakfast this morning. Everyone liked it, and they all came back for seconds.  My son won't eat onions, so I sauteed them before adding them to the mixture. That seems to make a difference to him.  Next time, I'll add diced green bell peppers, and maybe even some canned green chiles.

I put this together Christmas eve. I used frozen hash browns and  baked them  30 min at 350,mixed the other stuff in a bowl and refrigerated everything. Baked it Christmas morning and everyone loved it, especially my newly pregnant daughter-in-law. Thanks for a great recipe!

YUM! Changes: I used chicken and turkey breakfast sausage, 8 extra large eggs, fresh sage, pepper and a Trader Joes smoked cheese mixture. Teenagers and adults both enjoyed it for Xmas brunch!

This turned out great even though I did not have everything...No sage sausage at the store so I added some sage from the spice rack to regular sausage. Forgot to add butter but did spray baking dish beforehand. I did not have cottage cheese so left it out. I suggest a bit of milk as a sub. Used 8 large eggs & some salt and pepper too. Browned the sausage well in a large fry pan, spooned it out then pitched in the hash browns and browned them up a bit then lined the baking dish with them, pressing them down. Pour in the rest, pop in the oven, set the timer, go open Christmas presents, timer goes off, set dish to cool, pop in some biscuits. Everybody loved it.

So even with the mistakes I made (forgot the cottage cheese, forgot to add the onion), this is fantastic!  I didn't peel the potatoes either.  I just grabbed my box grater and had fun.  It took about 3 potatoes and was about 4 cups.  I added more eggs because I didn't buy jumbo.  Can't wait to make it the right way for New Year's brunch!

I really enjoyed this recipe since I had many of the ingredients already in the house. The other stuff I was missing, I could easily make due with last minute substitutions. For example, I substituted the cottage cheese with cream cheese, skipped the onion, and used mozerella instead of cheddar. I also used 12 eggs to fill a large casserole dish to make it go farther. The kids loved this and it was very filling. The cream cheese was a nice contrast with the sausage and complimented the potatoes I shredded by hand. Next time I will likely skip the sausage and add chopped spinach and cream cheese as a mixture and top with mozerella. The possibilities are endless!

Very good Breakfast idea!! The sage flavored sausage really put the cherry on top (IMO). Followed the recipe as shown and I am glad to say I will make this on a regular basis now. Thank you for sharing this. A+

My hubby and I live with his parents and their 15 year old, and I make dinner a few times a week, so I'm always on the hunt for something easy and yummy. The ONLY changes I made: I cooked the onion with the sausage, and baked the potato 'crust' first for half an hour. I don't know if baking the potatoes really helped all that much. They didn't get crispy like I thought they were going to. I might have cooked them longer if I had time. I just cooked the rest of it anyway. I actually thought I had overcooked it, because all the edges were brown, but it was great. I served it immediately because my father in law was already home from work, and dinner is usually done by then...so I was trying to get it on the table fast. It was WAY too hot to eat right away! After about 10-15 minutes it set up and wasn't as blazing hot. It was SO good. I cut everyone a serving size (according to 12 serving sizes) and my FIL asked...can I have more or are you saving the rest for something? I said "Eat up!" and they did! There were only 2 servings left at the end of dinner, and that was with 5 people! (3 guys, 2 women). The guys ate a ton! I served it with cut apples and grapes.  I was going to add some green chiles...but didnt have any. Maybe next time. Good with hot sauce if you like hot sauce on your eggs. Yummy!

One of our weekly breakfast favorites.  I use turkey sausage and omit the butter.  I just put the potatoes in a greased pan, then mix the other ingredients and pour over.  The cottage cheese melts everything together and makes it a creamy casserole.  Thanks!

I made this exactly as written other that I used reduced fat pork sausage. Although it was a bit bland, I will definitely make again, but I will add scallions or green chilies.

I think the flavor of this dish all depends on the sausage that you use. I followed the recipe, except I used 4 cups of frozen shredded hash browns and only an 8 oz bag of cheese. I also added 8 eggs and it was great!

I made this for a breakfast potluck and had several requests for the recipe. The only thing I changed was that I used a frozen o'brien potato mix and omitted the extra onion. I only had large eggs in the fridge, so I ended up using 8. Absolutely delicious I will be making again as soon as possible.

Wow...this dish was absolutely amazing!!! The only things that I did differently were omitting the onion all together (my hubby is not a fan of them), beat my eggs with about 1/4 cup of milk before adding the other ingredients and stirring all together and I added a 1/2 tsp of Ground mustard. I took this to my MOPS meeting this morning and the ladies raved over it! Delish:) Thanks for sharing!!

This was good but had a very strong onion taste. I am not an onion fan but everyone else really liked it. I omitted the sausage and used pre-shredded potatoes. I cooked the potato layer the night before then added the egg mixture on top and put into the fridge overnight. I let it sit out for a bit in the morning before putting it in the oven. Came out fine. I will make this again because it was easy and most people seemed to like it. I might try without the onion.

This was wonderful! I sauteed the onion with the sausage, and baked the hash browns for about 35 minutes before adding the other ingredients. Also added some hot sauce (pairs great with eggs). Much better than the recipes with bread. It sliced perfectly.

My husband really liked this and I was surprised because he is a traditional, bacon or sausage, eggs and pancakes guy.  I made two pans for Christmas day and served it again the next day with pancakes. I holds up really well and tastes as good or better the next day.
I also have made it for Father's Day breakfasts at church and it's always a hit.

Absolutely amazing!  Used frozen hashbrowns to cut down on time and baked in the oven for about 10 minutes prior to adding in the mixture.  I only used one 8 oz package of shredded cheese in the mix, then used the remaining cheese on top of the casserole.  I will definitely make this again and again!

Very good!  I pre-baked the hash browns as recommended by reviewers.  Next time, I'll try it without the pre-baking.  I added mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions and sausage.  Very, very yummy.  This ones a keeper.

Tasty. I don't like doing egg casseroles that have bread in them so this is perfect. I used frozen potato hashbrowns as other suggested... measured out and let them thaw overnight. Used dry curd cottage cheese (similar to ricotta) because that's what I had on hand. Used 8 eggs because this calls for jumbos and I had larges. Sets up nicely... not runny at all. Good flavor although if I make it again I'd likely add some salt and pepper. Overall a good recipe. I think this could easily be mixed together the night before as well making for an easy breakfast in the morning.

Easy to make.  I wasn't overly impressed, but I didn't use the Sage Sausage (the grocery store was out).  If you have a home full of people to feed or need a dish to take to work for a pot luck then this is the perfect recipe.

Really delicious. I used left over ham because I didn't have sausage.  We ate this for dinner - but would be an awesome breakfast casserole too.  I used fresh shredded potatoes and prebaked the crust as suggested.  I used 8 eggs instead of 6.  I added some pepper, red pepper (just a dash). So tastey -- will make again!

Made a half batch of this in a 8inch square pan.  I was attracted to the recipe because it is gluten-free.  It tasted really good, the egg, cheese, cottage cheese combo was really good and are things I always have on hand.  Would have perhaps liked the potatoes to crisp up a bit, so may try what the others did with cooking the potatoes a wee bit first.   Made no subs, it was fine, adding only fresh ground salt and pepper.  Since it's cheaper and healthier, shredded ingredients myself (maybe added 3 minutes to prep time?)  Only took 2 potatoes.  On the whole a very economical meal that was enjoyed by the whole family.

LOVED IT! Went pretty much by the recipe. Needed more hash browns to cover the bottom of the 9 x 13" pan, but it was still incredible. Boyfriend lapped it up it, too, and he doesn't usually rave about my cooking. LOL. We will make this again.

Great Recipe!  Followed the suggestions of other reviewers and baked the shredded potatoes alone while I prepped the other ingredients. Sauted the onion together with the sausage. Also added salt, pepper and a bit of Mrs. Dash. Baked it in a stoneware casserole dish with a lid, and the egg mixture puffed up and browned beautifully, with potatoes crisping up nicely. Husband and 4 yr old daughter loved it and had seconds...will make again!

Delicious, even more than I expected. My wife loved it too and she's not normally as much of a potato fan as I. Naturally, I made a few modifications: used turkey italian sausage because that's what I had; added garlic and chopped jalapenos; left out the cottage cheese because I didn't have any; and finally, baked it at 425 for 40 minutes because I was impatient. You might call this a resilient recipe.

FIVE STARS!  Only because:  I made this recipe for the second time this morning.  The first time I followed it exactly only pre-baking the the hashbrowns.  It was just O.K....although my family appreciated it, I felt it lacked flavor.  This time, I pre-cooked the browns, added more seasoning with some of Emeril's Original Essence, and freash ground pepper, used low-fat cottage cheese and instead of sausage, I fried up some center cut bacon.  The positive comments didn't stop--once I stopped patting myself on the back, I let the family chime in.  They absolutely LOVED it!

My husband rated this recipe for me(after reading the fat and calorie content, i opted for a bowl of cereal)! He enjoyed it very much. I halved the recipe and made it in a pie plate and it looked great. As many others did, i precooked the potato crust. I added chopped green pepper(sauted the onion and peppers) and a few splashes of hot sauce to the egg mixture. It smelled great(way better than my cereal)!

This was excellent!  I used regular pork sausage instead of sage only b/c I'm more likely to have that on hand, and I used 3 cups frozen shredded hashbrowns b/c it's easier.  It turned out great!

I made this for Christmas morning, and everyone really enjoyed it.  We don't care for the soggy-bread casseroles, and thought that the potato layer was a PERFECT substitute for having any bread.  It fed six of us - four of whom are grown men with good appetites - while still not ruining our appetites for Mama's delicious Christmas dinner!

Finally! I found the egg dish I've been looking for! I'm not sure what it is -maybe the cottage cheese -  but this will be my go-to breakfast dish! I pre-cooked the hash browns for about 8 minutes, then baked at 375' for 35 minutes. It was almost done, so I turned it down to 250' because we weren't ready to eat so soon. I covered it with foil and it sat in the oven for almost an hour! And it turned out perfect! Thank You for a new favorite!

I made this for the second time last night and my 5 year said  "Mom food should not be this good".  The first time I made it i did not read the directions well and I mixed all the ingredients and baked it.  The second time I put the potatoes on the bottom like the recipe says.  They were both delicious --  the kids liked it with the "potato crust" better.

Delicious casserole.  The best part is it's soooo easy to extend if you need to feed more just by tossing in a bit more of everything, it doesn't need to be at all exact.  My guests couldn't get enough of this dish and my husband who isn't a breakfast lover can't stop talking about it.  I use frozen hash browns and regular sausage.

First: I used frozen shredded potatoes as suggested by some. I also added onions to this and lined a 9x13.  Precooked for 30 minutes at 350. Then put together remainder using vegi sausages - excellent. Cooked additional 30 min. at 350 and it was done although an additional 5 would have worked too. Perfect for group of people at home or office.

Great recipe for a crowd! I followed the suggestions on the board and baked the potatoes first for about 30 min., then added the egg mixture and baked for another 30 min. The crust was nice and firm and the egg mixture stayed fluffy and didn't get overcooked.

Very good and easy to make.  All I had on hand was sharp cheddar and ricotta, so I had to substitue for the mild cheddar and cottage cheese.  Still delicious.  My husband and I both liked it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is definately a keeper.  I was a little worried this might be greasy but it wasn't at all.  I have used pre-cooked sausages cut into bite size pieces and crumbled bulk sausage.   Both are fantastic!!!

This casserole set up well and has good texture, but it just didn't taste good to me.  My husband said it was good, but not great.  We cook alot and usually aren't disappointed in the highly rated recipes, but this one was a real disappointment.  It simply lacked flavor.

Awesome recipe! I only had 8 oz of cheddar, but I didn't miss the extra 4 ounces at all. I did add some pepper and some garlic powder to the mix. My boyfriend thought it was delicious as well, and brought some into work for his co-workers.

This was an okay recipe.  It was definately filling and easy to make.  My husband and son liked it, but I thought something was missing.  It needed some other flavor but I can't figure out what.  I might make it again to see if it's better the second time around.

This recipe is "ok" - definitely needs seasoning added to it otherwise it is a bit on the bland side.  We did like the top of the casserole being crunchy when it was done baking.  That was a nice texture contrast.

I made this for a recent party.  15 girls aged 12 to 13 and it was a complete hit.  I prepared it the night before and popped it in the oven the next morning.  Even the girls I knew were a little picky, ate it all.  I accidentally mixed the shredded onion with the potatoes, and it still tasted great.  This is now a brunch "go to" favorite.

This is major comfort food, very hearty and filling.  I double the meat as my sons like it best with more meat.  Eat sparingly though, I bet this one will pack on the pounds...

Great recipe-- threw it together for company that was unexpected.  Everyone loved it. Used NY Sharp Cheddar and frozen hash browns to make it simpler to do. Defrosted them to get moisture out and also baked alone for a bit first.

This was really tasty. I used only 8oz of cheese because even that was A LOT of cheese. I also used a vegetarian bulk "sausage". My picky 5yo son gobbled this up and my husband thought it was terrific. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because we thought it could used chopped sauted onion instead of the grated onion.

I made this according to directions, and with the advice of other reviewers, added some salt. I still found it quite bland and ended up putting a lot of salsa on my plate to flavor it up. Not bad, but I'll probably try another breakfast casserole next time. **Update: I started making this before checking that I'd already done it once before! Since I was already baking the potato crust, I made sure to try and counter the blandness I'd experienced before. I had o'brien potatoes, so that helped. Then I used some very sharp cheddar, and sauteed the onion with the turkey sausage I was using. With plenty of salt, pepper, and a few shakes of hot sauce in the egg mix, this came out decent. The base recipe is no more than 2 stars, 3-4 with modifications.

Due to other reviews, I browned hashbrowns first and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added some additional seasonings.  Very good!

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit - either prepared the day before or the same day.  I used to make one with bread and began using this one because a friend of mine has a child that is allergic to yeast.  I don't think my family or friends will let me go back to bread now!  I substitute any kind of cheese on hand for the cheddar - it all works and is a real crowd pleaser.  Hats off to the submitter.

Shredding the potatoes was a little messy and time-consuming, but this is quite a tasty treat in the end!  I made it for a mother's day brunch, and my family loved it.  Thanks!

My morning guests absolutely love it!
The only addition I made was I added fresh sliced mushrooms.
It is simple to prepare and delicious.
This recipe is a keeper!!!

I made this for two different times for two different brunches during Christmas.  One I made with Maple sausage and the other I made with regular sausage.  Both casseroles dissapeared quickly, but I think the regular sausage went over better (I preferred the maple).  I used the non-frozen pre-packaged shredded potatoes and they worked great.  I did bake them for 30 minutes before hand.  This is a great recipe to feed a crowd.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is pretty good.  A little too much onion flavor though.  Next time I make it, I will cut that in half.  Also, next time to save some time, I will use frozen shredded hash browns.  Instead of sage flavored sausage, I just used regular flavored breakfast sausage.

Everyone raves about this everytime I make it. It is fabulous and easy to make! I substitute hot sausage (since I don't care for sage) to give it some added flavor and a little kick. If my mom is in town I use mild or regular sausage. I use the potatoes o'brien since we like the chunkier potatoes and  peppers. I still add a few fresh cut onions and change up the cheese to whatever I have on hand, usually colby jack. I've tried numerous recipes but this by far is the best tasting and gets the best reviews from my eaters!

A pretty good recipe. It was a little bland, I had to add a little salt and pepper to my plate. Otherwise, easy and delicious. I baked the hash browns in the pan, added the egg and sausage mixture and refrigerated overnight until we were ready for breakfast in the morning. It took 10-15 minutes extra too cook. Next time I'll fry up the hash browns first, they were a little limp.

Made this exactly like the recipe and it wasn't good. The sage sausage was overpowering and ruined the recipe for me. I would definately substitute to regular sausage and I would change the hashbrowns to something with onions or peppers in it. Was disappointed and I wouldn't make this again.

Very good!  I made this for a football party and added 1 red pepper, 1 green pepper, and a cup of sliced mushrooms.  Next time I'll cut the butter way down to reduce the fat.  Oh and the shredded red potatoes were a cinch in the food processor!  I didn't even peel them!

Wow! I know this is the best breakfast casserole I've ever made, and possibly the best I've tasted. I did not have onion on hand, so I used dried minced onion, and it worked wonderfully!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

My family loved this recipe.  I followed the other reviews, and let the hash browns and butter "crust" bake for about 20 minutes while I was browning the sausage and preparing the filling.

Wow this is so good! I used tator tots instead of shredded potatoes, and I used 1/2 cup of milk, and a 1/2 cup of cottage cheese. I didn't have sage flavored sausage but it tasted great with regular. Also, I left out the onion and used onion powder instead. I will be making this again and again.

I made this for breakfast when we had company and took the suggestion to cook the hashbrown potatoes for a half hour first and then add everything else and cook for another 30.  Turned out wonderful and everytime I make it I make sure I have the recipe!

I wanted to make something for my sister in law for Mother's Day tomorrow and thought this looked good. I was a little nervous about taking her something I'd never made before so I decided to make hers in a smaller pan and make me a small dish tonight so I could try it. This was so good! I wish my little dish had been bigger, but then I would have gorged myself. I only made slight changes to the recipe. For me, eggs and potatoes have got to have some salt and pepper, so I added a little to each mixture. I also mixed a few onions in with the potatoes and used sharp cheddar instead of mild. I've got my fingers crossed that my sis in law will invite me to eat breakfast with them in the morning!

Really liked this. I baked the hash browns about 30 min before pouring the rest over the top. It really needed some salt and pepper. Over all a good meal.

I made this for Easter breakfast.  Used 9 eggs and substituted ham for sausage (also having sausage biscuits and gravy).  Used frozen hash browns with onions and green peppers and baked for 30 minutes as previously stated.  I thought this was a rather bland bunch of mush.  Maybe because I used ham.

Yummy! Like others, I prebaked the hashbrowns and butter for 30 min at 375. I cooked the onion and sausage together. I used a cheddar-jack cheese mixture and used 8 large eggs. Everyone at my brunch asked for the recipe.

I had a brunch one Saturday morning and thoguht I had prepared for it well enough. However, I slept through my alarm, my son was a wild child and when it came down to it, there was no way everything could have been ready. BUT...this recipe was a lifesaver. It took NO TIME to prepare. Even though it was quick, it didn't lose any quality. It was excellent and I plan on cooking it again. Hopefully soon:)

I wasn't sure if this was going to turn out well, but it was a GIANT hit!!  I fried up the hashbrowns first to make sure they did not come out gummy since I made this the night before.  Also, I only used half of the sausage and substituted half a pkg of bacon cut up and fried.  DELICIOUS!!

Wow - really is a bowl scraper.  Used the bag of Simply Potatoes hashbrowns I found next to the eggs at the market - came out great.  I found the hash browns on the bottom did not brown at all, so next time I will try blind baking them first and then adding the topping.  Guests at my breakfast table loved it and remarked "All you have to do is chew" as your whole breakfast (hasbrowns/eggs/cheese/sausage) is already make into a single item for you.

Giving it a 4 out of 5 - only because it was only a 5 after modifications made.  As per other reviews... I cooked hashbrowns first for about 30 minutes and then even broiled for an extra 5 or so to get extra crispy. Increased eggs to 8 - add a can of green chiles and a tsp each of salt and pepper. Also used a "mexican' blend cheese. After that - it was fabulous!! Will probably try it with ham or bacon next time (only because I am not a huge sausage fan).

This is an excellent casserole!  Made it when my daughter and her family were here to visit and it was enjoyed by all. Followed the recipe as written except that I layered the sausage because it was still too warm to stir into the egg mixture.  Next time will perhaps decrease the butter to 3 tablespoons to reduce the fat content a little and may add some mushrooms or zucchini for some veggies.  Hearty enough to serve for dinner.

I made this for dinner but it was more of a breakfast dish.

Because many others said it needed a little something extra, I used Potatoes O'Brien instead of shredded potatoes. I also used sharp a cheddar instead of a mild cheddar cheese.

It had an impressive flavor. The family loved it.

Very good recipe! I did a few alterations -  I cooked the potatoes just a little before I baked the casserole.  I also added green chilis to the eggs to give it a little kick.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a success at our last family brunch. I added some red bell pepper to add color. As another reviewer mentionned, I had to decrease my oven temperature to 350 degree. I guess it would also be excellent with bacon instead of sausage!

This recipe was excellent.  However, I would suggest heating the sausage at medium heat rather than medium-high heat as suggested.  The meat was burned when I cooked it over medium-high.

This was a big hit for our Christmas morning brunch. I used pre-packaged shredded hash brown potatoes to save time and energy, and they crisped up beautifully while baking. Very nice flavour!

Another AWESOME recipe!  I can usually judge just by looking at the ingredients if a recipe will be a winner in my house or not.  I had NO idea this one would be so well received though!  I made it the day after Christmas as a brunch. It takes a little time to make it but the final product looked just splendid and tasted just great!  I am going to try a few variations on the recipe just for fun, but it truly is wonderful the way it is!  Thanks for sharing:)

Excellent recipe!  Made this Christmas morning and got RAVE reviews from ALL.  The only thing I changed was that I did not use sage sausage.  My mother and I are not big on sage and so I just used the regular Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage.  Next time I will try it with Maple sausage...YUMMY!

This was very good. My whole family liked it. I gave it four stars because I found it waaaaaaay too greasy, but maybe that´s just because of the kind of sausage I used. Overall it was a great recipe which I will be most definitely making again. THANKS!

Wow!  This was a wonderful, easy to make dish and my guests loved it!  I agree that the potatoes are such a nice change from the bread-egg dishes.  I couldn't find sage sausage so I just used plain breakfast sausage, I meant to add in dried sage but forgot.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

no one was overly enthused about this dish.  we added some extra spices; sage, cumin, salt and pepper.  i would make it again, but try to tweak it.  might try adding more egg.  serving with a dollop of sour cream...

Excellent!  Used frozen hash brown pototoes seasoned with Wildtree Herbs' Home Fries Seasoning Blend, added about a cup of chopped onion to the egg mixture.  Delicious!

This is a great recipe, super easy, even after using real potatoes, the onions really add something and the sage sausage adds just the right bit of different flavor.

This recipe is just GREAT!!! It's such a welcome change from the monotony of "breakfast casserols"  No soggy bread, but crispy crunchy hash brown.  I made the recipe exactly how it was written, and I would say it's just perfect!!!wouldn't change anything about it.. My family loved it, and I'm sure that it will now become our new Holiday traditon.  My family thanks you  for sharing with us Bill.

My family loves this recipe.  We made it Christmas morning and no left overs. I used frozen hash browns, otherwise I made recipe as written. Yummy! We will be making this again.

I've made this multiple times now. I've taken others' suggestions and added 2 additional eggs as well as another cup of frozen hash browns and baked the hash browns/butter combo for about 30 minutes. 
The last time, I also added some whipped cream cheese that I had in the fridge. Every time, it's been very good!

The first time I made this the I used ricotta and used 8 eggs.  It was a little dry but that may have been me overcooking it.  I also cooked the potatoes first.

I used O'Brien potatoes instead of shredded potatoes, and didn't put in any other onion than what was with the O'Brien potatoes.  This is a great recipe, and I will most certainly make it again.  Perhaps with spicy sausage next time.  I just used regular this time, and it was still very good.

First time I made it followed recipe exactly it was delicious but far to rich for our tastes. I now omit the butter and cottage cheese. Used sharp cheddar, bit of hot sauce. Occasionally I add cooked spinach. Recipe is quite versatile. Everyone really likes it and it’s great  for leftovers makes for very fast and filling breakfast. Thank you for posting such a great recipe.

This is really good. Trying to figure out what was missing. Maybe  top with hot sauce or ketchup. Don’t get me wrong, it is really good, but I think the ketchup or hot sauce would take it over the top. Great for a group. Love the cottage cheese. I cooked the sausage with a chopped onion and red bell pepper. Stored in the fridge overnight. Next day I greased a deep dish 9x13 and poured in a big bag of O’brien potatoes. In a separate bowl I beat 8 eggs and cream cheese. Then added sharp cheddar, and the sausage/onion/red pepper mix. Baked at 375 for an hour.

Made same changes as others suggested...8 eggs, pre-baked the potato crust @ 350 for 35 minutes, sauteed onions and red bell pepper with the sausage, sharp cheddar and added some red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Turned out great

I made this with a few tweaks. First of all I used a ton of seasoning. Secondly I used 4 cups of frozen hash browns instead of 3. I seasoned the butter that you pour over them with chipotle seasoning, salt, pepper and garlic. I used 1/2 cup of cottage cheese and 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of all cottage cheese. i feel like some cream of mushroom soup would be delicious in this also. It was so good. Next time I will use more egg, and more veggies like peppers, spinach and maybe some tomatoes as well.

I have  made this for a few years. It's an all around good recipe that always turns out good. Sometimes I add. some canned green chiles and a few shakes of your favorite hot sauce to the egg mixture. You can use different meats or none at all. It's a keeper.

This is my absolute top favorite for taking to work. I'll add an extra half pound to a pound of meat and I have found it better to mix the potatoes in with everything else and to split it between a 9X11 pan and a smaller square cake pan. It's not as thick but makes it stay together after freezing and re-heating instead of splitting into layers and falling apart.

Absolutely delicious! I did cut the recipe in half since there are only 2 of us. In a smaller pan, it was done in 30 mins. We both loved it and will definitely be making it again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Well I screwed it up! I mixed the shredded potatoes together with everything else. But guess what? It was still DEEE-LISH! Ive made it both as per directions, as well as the 'mistake' way. I actually kind of preferred it all mixed together!

I've made this recipe many times. It's perfect for the weekends for my husband and I. We have so many places to be first thing in the morning on Saturdays and Sundays (swim meets, baseball games, basketball games). I can focus on getting the kids fed and ready and my husband and I can heat a slice of this up and take it to the game and have a delicious breakfast on the run. I have added chopped bell pepper and diced mushroom for variety. It's so Good! I also use 8 eggs and a bag of frozen shredded potatoes. Leftovers go great in my husbands lunch. He takes lunch around 10 am so it's a good meal (he works on a golf course). Its great to heat up after I get the kids off to school and Mama can sit back and enjoy :-)

So good and so easy!! I like to mix ingredients he night before so I can just pop it in the oven. Turns out great, can also substitute riced cauliflower for the potatoes to keep it carb free. If I’m particularly lazy I’ll even but cubed ham to mix in instead of cooking sausage!

Moist and delicious! The only things I changed was adding an extra cup of frozen hash brown potatoes with a 1/2 cup of butter instead of a 1/4 cup (the extra butter makes it easier to form the shell). I also cooked the onions with the sausage....this is one of the best breakfast casseroles on this site!

Made for our church's Easter potluck this morning. Rave reviews! I followed other reviewer's comments by increasing to 8 eggs, using frozen hash browns, sautéing the sausage and onion together, melting the butter in  the dish while pre-heating the oven, and then cooking the hash browns first for 30 minutes.

First I did as other reviewers and cooked the potatoes while I was frying the sausage.  There wasn't nearly enough potatoes.  Don't be tempted to add salt as the cheese and sausage give more than enough.  This was very rich and somewhat greasy so I don't think I'll make it again.  If I do, I will add a lot more potatoes.

It really wasn’t that hard, and I’m new to cooking. I made this to help my wife cook less and she was so thankful. It’s not like, super amazing tasting because I didn’t use sausage with strong flavor. Next time I’ll make it with maple sausage like the recipe says!

Very good casserole! I served this as part of a 'Breakfast for Dinner' get together and everyone loved it! When I try new recipes I always have like, 5 bowls on my counter. This was no different but 3 are adequate! 
Bowl 1)
I used a large bag of Ore-Ida shredded hash browns (about 5 cups), I followed others suggestions and buttered 13x9 glass dish and spread hash browns into it and let set up in oven for about 15 minutes. Added garlic powder, salt, pepper
Bowl 2)
10 large eggs beaten, with salt and pepper to taste.( Biggest change because of large group.) 
Bowl 3)
I sauteed a freshly diced jalapeno with 1/4 cup purple onion with regular flavored pork sausage. Let it cool BEFORE adding to egg mixture! Fold into to hash brown dish. Took about 55 minutes to cook. The texture was beautiful, a little darker than I wanted, so I covered with foil for final minutes. Garnished with more shredded cheese(YES!) and served. LOVED by all 17 of my guests. Thanks for the recipe! No photos - it was gone!

Will definitely make this again.  Thank you so much for a fantastic recipe! 

I had some cream cheese in my fridge I needed to use up, so I substituted the cottage cheese with 16 oz. of cream cheese - thinned a little with sour cream to get the same consistency.  Next time I'm going to try the cottage cheese.  I got some pre cut peppers and onions at the supermarket and sautéed them with the sausage.   I also used the pre-shredded but not frozen hash browns - (like Simply Potatoes but used store brand instead) - and pre-baked the crust for 30 minutes.  Topped it with cracker crumbs to keep the eggs really moist underneath and add some crunch.

I mixed this all up the night before because I'm trying to prep to meals on nights I have the time to cook.  My family was raving about it  served up  with flaky layers biscuits.

Before making this I changed quite a few things and then served it to a group at church. It got rave reviews. I prepped what i could the day before, then mixed and baked the casseroles the day I served. I cooked the sausage and poured off most of the fat and chilled it. I cooked double the onion in the remaining sausage fat and chilled it. Next morning I measured out the fat and added butter needed and tossed with potato cubes and baked in greased pans while I mixed remaining ingredients, substituting sharp cheddar, 9 large eggs, and adding 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Once in pan, I tossed well and baked. Even the kids were saying they loved it!

Love this recipe, especially when traveling. No need to buy a bag of flour just for a half-cup, or a whole thing of spices just for a tablespoon. Everything here can be bought at the store with no leftover/extra ingredients (okay, maybe you can’t buy a half-stick of butter). It’s also extremely easy and feeds many. About to make it again, maybe my 10th time, and felt compelled to review it.

LOVED THIS Dish!!!! 10 Stars!!!!
Husband loved it, and said it tasted like Quiche!
I followed the recipe as noted in the steps listed.
I did one check at 40 Minutes into it to see how it was doing.
It took 55 minutes to an hour to cook as well.
I did the "Toothpick Test" and the toothpick stood up straight.
Yes, waited the 5 minutes and then shared it with him.
Husband doesn't like onions, so I cut that amount in half and he said he couldn't taste it. So, it turned out wonderful.
Next time I try it, I might add broccoli, as that is a husband favorite too. And, boy, was this easy. I'm excited to have been so successful with this dish. Truly amazing. Thank you for your donation to Allrecipese.com !

This is now my go-to brunch recipe. I cook the sausage and onions on the stovetop first. I add eggs as the last ingredient to the mixture to give the sausage and onions a chance to cool before touching the eggs

I made a few of the changes as suggested by others but nothing drastic that I think changed the overall taste of the casserole (I increased potatoes to 4C, and baked the potato portion for 30mins before adding the egg mixture.  I used maple sausage (and cooked onion with the sausage) and we loved it.  I also used 8 extra large eggs.)  Great recipe ... would be easy to modify based on individual taste.

Delicious. The only change I made was 7 large eggs instead of 6 jumbo. I get my eggs from the chickens next door and they don't do jumbos. Oh and I cooked the onion with the sausage. Even better the next day.

However tasty, and I stuck to the ingredients given in the recipe, it came out a little too moist and mushy for my liking. I cooked the casserole for another 15 minutes and that seemed to firm it up a little bit. Did I do something wrong? Perhaps another attempt to get it right may help? The overall taste makes me want to give it another try?

I love this recipe so much! Everyone does! I have never sent a recipe more than this one. It’s so easy to make and makes great leftovers. Changes I make: I just eye the cottage cheese. I do less than called for. I also add a can of green chilies sometimes two.

I had tater tots instead of hash browns and they worked nicely. A few people in the group were low-carb so on a third of my pan I didn’t put potatoes on the bottom (did butter all over bottom of pan) and still baked up nicely. Had a couple slices of provolone that I tore and mixed in with the eggs, with cheddar shred on top. I got several compliments.

I have been making this for several years ever since I found it on Allrecipes and am just getting around to reviewing it because I had a request to make it. My now 15 year old daughter wants it every day that we have a special breakfast like birthdays, Christmas, 1st day of school, etc... 

I follow the advice many have offered. I put the butter in a baking dish and let it melt while the oven is preheating. Then I add the potatoes and onions (and sometimes green peppers) and bake for about 30-40 minutes (long enough for them to be cooked and hopefully a little crisp - usually on the edges crisp). I do use 8 eggs instead of 6. I put the mixed ingredients on top of the baked hash and onions and bake for another 30 minutes or so until the egg is baked. It is delicious and family and guests raves over it when they eat it.

This recipe is great and people love this when I make it.  I do variations at times.  Sometimes I use Tator Tots instead if hash browns.  I switch the cheese, meat, and sometimes add vegetables.  As long as I keep the measurements the same it is great.  It is a great recipe.

Excellent (at least mostly)  Gluten Free breakfast casserole - no breaded ingredients.    Very flavorful, easy to make.    The only change I made was to use regular sausage instead of sage as I am not fond of sage.

I made this for a brunch party that I hosted and the casserole was empty in a matter of minutes. This will be my new go to recipe from now on and has since removed my other favorites from my list. My modification was using already frozen hash browns for ease and pre baking it 350 for 30 minutes and putting garlic salt and pepper on the sausage mix as other reviewers have suggested. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for Easter.  I didn’t follow the recipe fully.  I did 12 eggs as mine were on the small side.  I did 16oz of cheddar cheese.  I used thawed hash browns and just eyeballed the amount.  Added a bit more butter.  I also added heavy whipping cream and just drizzled it over the mix before refrigerating it overnight.   Everyone love the casserole the next morning.  Things I might do differently next time just to add a variety to the mix...add some red peppers and sauté those with the onions.  Maybe include a more flavorful shredded cheese.   It’s a wonderful recipe as is or can be spiced up if you like.  Will definitely make again.

I used Jimmy Dean maple flavored sausage, mexican blend shredded cheese, and hashbrown O'Brien.  Also, added salt and pepper to taste.  Cooked the hashbrowns for 30 minutes and then another about 50 minutes with the egg mixture.

Used mix of cheddar and provolone, and frozen spiced hash browns in ours, other than that recipe as is. Great recipe. Will do again in the future while family and kids loved it.

The beauty of this recipe is that you don't have to let it set in the frig overnight.  Also, you can add pretty much any-
thing that goes with the other ingredients, I didn't but you totally can!  It freezes well and taste wonderful!

In order to properly rate this, I made it with all of the ingredients listed.  It was amazing.  I have made at least 20 of these casseroles since November.  Simply shredded potatoes makes it even easier.

I can't even begin to count how many times I've made this since we found the recipe.  It's a crowd favorite, no matter the crowd.  A hit with adults, kids, TEENS, foreigners, potlucks, in-laws... it's guaranteed to please and ALWAYS beckons for a second helping!  It's requested for breakfast, lunch, brunch, or dinner.  Anytime is a good time for this recipe.  :)

Turned out great & everyone loved it. But, I didn't have white onions or cottage cheese so I used green onions & fresh ricotta cheese instead.

Just served this casserole  for Christmas Day morning breakfast. I prepared it the night before and baked it in the morning. Wow! My family raved. I used 1/2 pound of breakfast sausage in half of the casserole and cubed ham in the other half. I can't tell you how much we enjoyed it. We even had some leftovers for breakfast this morning.  This will no doubt be our go to egg casserole going forward! Thanks for a really yummy recipe!

This proved to be a great easy casserole for a nice dinner.  I added sautéed mushrooms.  Next time I will use 1.5 lbs. of sausage for extra flavor.

We made this casserole on Thanksgiving weekend for a hungry crowd. Made it exactly as the recipes written. Huge hit. Many came back for seconds. Not a piece left over.
FYI people when you review a recipe that's been altered or changed it's no longer a fair review of the recipe. If you want to write a review of the recipe at least make it as per the recipe otherwise write your own recipe and review that.

We made this tonight and my husband told me that I can make this anytime. We read some of the comments and baked the “crust” for a half hour before putting the egg mixture in to cook. We didn’t have any potatoes so I used hash browns, I read the recipe wrong (I thought it was 6 cups potatoes, not 3 cups), so we used more butter, eggs and cheese. It was delicious.

great tasty recipe if you tweak it just a bit. I spice my potatoes, use green onion, add maple syrup to the cheese/egg mixture. I have also added mushrooms occasionally but it is good without too.

It's nice to have a simple and yet delicious dish to make. I especially love it not having many ingredients as those are my favorite dishes to make. I will definitely be making this again. I made this dish with Giant Eagle Sweet Italian Sausage. Yummy!!

I make this casserole several times a year since finding the recipe. I'm making it now for my husband for Father's Day! It is our favorite breakfast casserole!

I used yellow stone ground grits, a little cajun seasoning, and some Tabasco sauce to kick up the flavor.  Great brunch recipe!

Love this casserole.  I made as is the first time, and made small changes the second time.  I used 6 regular eggs and the 16oz cottage cheese.  I chopped the onion and pan fried it with 1/2 lb of turkey breakfast sausage.  I added dried sage since I can't get the sausage called for.   I used frozen hash browns, thawed.  I used less butter with the hash browns, about 2 tablespoons, and I baked the hash browns in the casserole dish first until lightly toasted on the edges.  I used about 1/2 the amount of cheese.  I had extra hash browns, so I pan fried them a little bit and then put them on top.   I thought we would have leftovers, but everyone kept eating it until it was gone.  I will be making this again and again.

Another great recipe on allrecipes.com.  Thanks for the recipe!  My daughter does not like cottage cheese so I made a small portion without cottage cheese but she liked the part with cottage cheese more.  This is just a good solid recipe!  I will be making it a lot.  (I used hot jimmy dean sausage because that is all I had and I will continue to use the hot sausage.  I think it gives it a little kick).

I made it for Easter breakfast.  It was a hit!!  The only additional items I added were garlic and onion powders.  I had a 20oz bag of hash browns, and added the entire thing.  I used sweet Italian sausage instead of hot and made it in a larger casserole dish instead of pie dish.  Added a mix of 3 types of cheddar cheese, and added some on top with about 15 min before done baking.  The leftovers this morning were delicious!

This is probably my favorite breakfast casserole I've ever eaten! My husband and I are on a diet, so I used veggie sausage instead and it was honestly the first time I've had it in a meal and couldn't tell that it wasn't real sausage. Very flavorful, perfect consistency, I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. LOVED IT! I can't even imagine how good it would be if I'd used real sausage ??

Very tasty - I pictured it coming out juicy or watery - not all - nice firm dry texture - I also thought it might not be enough hash browns but it turned out to be a good ratio

I used several modifications, including several others have mentioned: 8 large eggs instead of 6 jumbo; frozen hashbrowns partially pre-baked before adding the mixture; 4 cups of hashbrowns instead of the 3 in the recipe; I used green onions and threw them in uncooked; substituted hot Italian sausage without casing; added a couple teaspoons of black pepper; added half a package of chopped spinach. The Italian sausage provided all the spice and flavour one could want for this casserole. Yes, delicious and a definite keeper.

Very tasty!!! I made this for dinner and  was looking for something to do with sage sausage (mistakenly bought instead of regular sausage). I took a few of the reviewers modifications - I added 1/2 red pepper to the sausage and cooked it with onions.  I also added dill weed to the potatoes (I always add dill weed to shredded potatoes).  I also cooked the shredded potatoes first for about 30 minutes, then added the sausage and cheese mixtures and baked for another 35 minutes.  Whole family really enjoyed!  I will definitely make this again. 

This makes a lot, so we will get to enjoy again this week for lunch or dinner.

Parbaked the shredded potatoes for 30 mins, as recommended by other reviewers.  Sautéed the sausages with onions.  I will use more onions next time since cooking it mutes its flavor a lot anyway.  Followed the rest of steps, per recipe.  Really easy but good results.  Recipe will surely work with many variations.  Love that!

Omg! so to start we like a lot of egg in our pie so we used a dozen large eggs. I'm also going through a cumin phase so I added salt, pepper, and cumin. it only took 45 min to cook in our oven and I did NOT precook the hash browns. 

we are definitely adding this to our menu

This is a great alternative to the bread sausage cheese casserole and family with gluten allergies can eat it too!   The only thing I did different is take the suggestion to just mix all of it together instead of making the hashbrown "crust."  Turned out beautifully.   Making it again this morning!

This was delicious!   I used prepackaged, refrigerated hashbrowns so that I didn't have to grate potatoes.  Worked great.  Made the recipe exactly as indicated other than that, it was a hit!  Everyone ate seconds!

The only changes I made was using frozen shredded potatoes, baking before putting the egg and sausage mix in and using regular breakfast sausages. It was a huge hit! I will make this again, probably even for supper!

Easy recipe to make,  I use as part as our Christmas breakfast.  I usually prepare it the night before and put it in the oven when we wake up Christmas morning to open gifts.  That way I can spend more time with family and less time making breakfast.

I made it with butternut squash and it  was  easy and fabulous! I  roasted the squash with olive oil and seasoned to taste with onion powder,  garlic powder, salt-and-pepper. Crowd pleaser. 
No one, not even the kids knew it was squash. 
This recipe is a keeper for many years to come!

Very tasty.  One thing I will do differently is brown the potato and butter mixture in the oven before putting in the rest of the ingredients.  The potatoes were soggy, I did not like this texture.

I made this for the first time, and it was a hit!   I used more hash browns, baking some as a crust according to some of the reviews I read.  I had part of a bag of hash browns left, so I just threw them all in (thawed), on top of the already baked hash brown-butter "crust", and then the egg/sausage etc. mix on top and baked.  It was flavorful & easy.  I also sautéed the onions before adding them to the egg mixture - we don't enjoy "crunchy" onions.  I can see adding some additional seasonings - it could definitely handle additional spices if that's what your family likes.  We enjoyed it!

I totally agree with those who've baked the potatoes first. I did mine about 25 minutes, until they turned  just a little brown. It gets rid of a lot of the  water that's in a potato.

As for being bland, yeah, it is. That's what makes it a good recipe. You can do just about anything you want with this and it'll come out just fine. Different sausage, different cheese(s), a little sour cream, whatever you like.  Just don't put too much cottage cheese in it. I"ve put a layer of poblano peppers, quartered lengthwise, on top of the potatoes.  That took care of the bland.

This recipe must be tweaked!  The sage sausage like the recipe says to use is a must.  Definitely saute the onions in butter first.  Then instead of mild cheddar use sharp cheddar cheese and use a full 2 cups of it.  Add a chopped green pepper and salt pepper.  Yummy with those changes.

I think I would just chop the onion. Shredding it seems to make it taste too oniony for my family.

I am not a big fan of cottage cheese.  I substituted with the same amount of cream cheese, and it is SO good! just a tip for others who may not like cottage cheese.

Made this for work, everyone loved it...it was a huge hit, will definitely be making it again. 
I took previous advice and used frozen hash browns, and cooked those the night before.  I cooked sausage and onions together,  mixed up all the other ingredients  and refrigerated over night.  The next morning I assembled it all and baked it for 1 hour.   Took it to work right out of the oven, Perfection!!!!  Thanks.

This was a good and easy casserole that I would make again. Note that it does taste salty from the sausage and cheese (I did not add any extra salt) but it was a hit anyway.

Great recipe. I sauteed the onions and some diced bell pepper, cooked the hashbrowns to slightly crispy before mixing in, and added a little milk. It was excellent!

I made 2 dishes for my husbands office last nite and baked them this morning.  They all loved it.  I added a few extra ingredients. I added a small can of green chilis for a little spice, salt and pepper.  I didnt have cottage cheese but did have rocatta cheese. I added 8 eggs instead of 6 and also added 1/2 of a large can of evaporated milk for extra moistness. This recipe is a  keeper and will make it again for my family soon.

I served this for brunch and it was a big hit.  I had difficulty finding shredded potatoes so I went with the suggestion to use frozen hash browns.  Excellent.  I made everything a day and a half before -- cooked the hash brown  crust for about 20 minutes and combined the sausage mixture in another bowl, then refrigerated everything until the morning.  Then I combined all ingredients and cooked it according to the instructions.   I just heated it up this morning and it was even better as left over.  I will make it again for sure.

I've made this a couple times and I've improved on it ran time. Started using spinach and corn and peppers to add more color and flavor and used hash browns instead of potatoes. Really easy to make love using this recipe

I have made this breakfast casserole so many times and always get compliments.  It is super easy.  I have made it the night before and just heat up in the morning.  I have also made it the morning of and give myself an hour and a half to prep and cook.  This type of casserole you can tweak (if you have left over peppers and onions, if you have different types of cheese and also if you use different potatoes for the bottom).  I have also added milk to egg mixture only because I needed to feed more people.  This is a keeper.

This breakfast casserole was extra yummy the first time I made it. The second time I made the breakfast casserole,   I prepared it the night before, and was slightly disappointed because the potatoes turned a grey-ashy color. Although it tasted good,  it definitely lacked appeal because of the presentation.

As shown I would rate it a 4.  Doctored up per the reviews a 5!  I also added the onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, 9 large eggs, cayenne, a titch of flour to the potato mixture, diced chilis...hold on...is this a different recipe?  Any woo...it was delicious. OH, and did I mention I used Wright's bacon in addition to the sausage?  DEE-LICIOUS!!!

I have made this recipe a number of times with a few variations.  It turned out great as written, was good with both freshly shredded or frozen potatoes,  we also liked it with a couple extra eggs, and sautéed onions (sometimes peppers too) with sausage.  You can't go wrong with this dish!  I made it a number of times for potluck breakfasts and it was always a hit!  I serve it with a little dish of salsa verde to spoon over each serving and that is a delicious addition!  Definitely recommend this one!

Absolutely delicious!   I followed the advice of another post and used frozen hash browns, cooked them separately in the oven for about 30 minutes and then added my egg and sausage mixture.  However, I over cooked mine according to the recipe because I was only suppose to cook it an additional 30 minutes, but because I set the timer instead of the cook timer, the oven cooked  past the 30 minutes until I made it back home, which was an additional 30 minutes.  To my surprise "Dinner" wasn't ruined.  I had to stop myself because it was that good.  Great leftovers for breakfast.  I will definitely be making this again.

I rated it four stars because I altered it. I cooked the hash browns in the pan in the oven some, used 8 eggs, a jar of green chili's and a mixture of Mozzarella,Colby Jack and Sharp Cheddar. Also I didn't mix the meat in with the egg mixture, just put it on top. Added some garlic powder, red pepper and black pepper. Everyone loved it! Will make again for sure.

I did use 8 eggs instead of 6, used all half & half instead of milk and used scallions instead of regular onions. It came out great, very tasty. BUT, I have to say that I usually use Non-Stick spray but since the shredded potatoes were mixed with plenty of butter, I didn't think it was going to stick to the pan. I was so wrong!! So, just make sure you use non-stick spray before placing the layer of shredded potatoes.

I made this twice - once following the recipe with DivineHealth7's modifications which was pretty  great! The second time I decided to modify to fit my organic lower fat /lower carb diet. I like my food spicy too so I wanted to kick the heat up !  I substituted the potatoes for sweet potatoes; I used 1.5 cup liquid egg whites plus 2 whole free range eggs;  I made the sausage myself from organic ground turkey, sage, thyme, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes and a little honey;  I added extra onion, some jalenpenos, mushrooms and green pepper; I used 6 oz of grass fed baby swiss and organic whole milk small curd cottage cheese.   Baked the potatoes and butter in the pan for 25 min first, then poured on the filling mixture, topped with the grated swiss and garnished with green bell pepper rounds.  Yummy!!!

This is delicious and filling.  Per suggestions: I used 8 eggs and 4 cups of frozen hashbrowns and cooked the onions with the sausage.  I browned the butter in the pyrex in the oven and then tossed the hashbrowns.  I baked the potatoes for 30 minutes.  And then did baked an additional 35 minutes with the egg mixture.  Great dish - we had it for dinner!

I make this at least once a week. Everyone I've ever made it for loves it. It's great if you make it exactly as written(except add 2 eggs always) but you can really experiment too, very forgiving. Tonight, at husband's request, instead of hashbrowns I covered the bottom of the pan with a layer of bacon, cooked it for 10 min in a 375 oven, drained the grease,  then poured the sausage/egg over the bacon and cooked as usual. The men loved it. Great recipe!

I didn’t have fresh potatoes on hand so I substituted Idahoan Instant 4 servings as the foundation. I also only used about 3/4 pound of diced link sausages and it was plenty of meat. My family loved it. Will definitely make again. Also used fresh sage! Lovely!

Fantastico! I made it for supper one night and my husband had a billion pieces. I would highly recommend lightly salting and precooking the potato/butter layer before you cook the casserole. Also, cook the cut onions along with the sausage.  This cut casserole cooking time down to closer to 30 minutes (I cooked until it temped at 170) and the potatoes were nice and soft.    I did add some seasoned salt and pepper to taste, but I'm guessing that's assumed. Well done!

This was my first attempt at an egg bake and was a huge hit for Christmas with my family.  I used frozen hash browns like some others.  It turned out great and I will definitely make it again.

We added dehydrated onion (in place of the raw onion in the recipe), red/green bell peppers, garlic, ginger, oregano, onion salt, and pepper to the meat.  And additional oregano to the potato crust.  Followed other users advice and cooked the potato mixture at 350 for 40 min. before adding the meat mixture.  Then cooked the final dish for 45 minutes.  Also used sharp cheese instead of medium.  This was a crowd pleaser for my family, we'll be making it again.

I love this recipe!!!  We used to always make the breakfast pizza II recipe with the crescent roll crust but I love this one more because......it's Gluten Free and not expensive!!!!  I use regular store brand hash browns and mix with the melted butter and put that in the oven while I brown the sausage.  I like how the cottage cheese melts away and you can't see it so my picky kid doesn't know there is cottage cheese in it.  This is a very filling meal and we serve it for dinner.  I've made it about 3 times now.

This was delicious & super easy. I just threw tater tots in the pan (subbed for shredded potatoes) & premixed the other ingredients. New Years morning I just poured the sausage mixture on top & baked! I did sauté my onions with the sausage & would suggest doing the same.

Glad that I read the reviews and added some flavor with Garlic, salt and pepper. Still seemed to be missing something. Was not bad, but I would use less potatoes next time. My kids ate it with ketchup. Simple recipe to follow.

Made this for a Christmas day brunch.  I had bought fresh pork sage sausage that came in a 1-1/2 pound package, and there were lots of folks coming over, so I increased the amount of all ingredients by 50% except the shredded cheese and the eggs.  I used 16 oz shredded cheese and only 7 eggs.  I will say, using the 3 cups of potatoes the recipe called for would NOT have covered the bottom and sides of my 9x13 glass casserole dish.  For convenience I had bought a 32 oz bag of frozen hash browns (the grated style).  I made sure they were completely thawed, and at or a bit warmer than room temperature before mixing with the melted butter.  That amount was perfect for making a thin but complete crust on the bottom and sides of the pan.  I let the potatoes come up a slight bit higher than the filling, which worked perfectly, as they were nicely browned and crunchy.  I mixed the sausage, cottage cheese and shredded cheeses well and added the eggs after, just until incorporated.  Since I had increased the recipe by 50%,  I thought I might have to add 30 more minutes to the cooking time, but it was cooked perfectly at just over 1 hour.  The guests loved it.   After we got done opening presents, we migrated back to the kitchen and the third-pan that was left disappeared!  This dish also maintains its heat long after taking from the oven -- great for a brunch or open house.

This casserole was delicious for Christmas Eve breakfast with only minor changes! I just used potatoes o'brien (with onions and peppers) instead of hash browns, and I think it gave it a perfect kick.  I did bake the crust for just a bit before adding the egg mixture, and I used 8 eggs instead of 6, as others suggested. Everyone loved it!

It tasted really good but I did what others did in that I pre-baked the hash browns because I like them crispy. I used 10 large eggs because it just looked like it needed it. As for flavor issues that others had, I think it goes without saying to salt and pepper eggs and potatoes. I did. Added salt and pepper to both the potatoes and the egg mixture. I recommend using sharp cheddar cheese and when it was done I topped it with some sour cream and green onions, super yummy!

I actually would give this 4.5. Followed the suggestions and used frozen shredded hash browns (thawed) and prebaked for 35 min. Cooked onion, mushrooms, and green pepper with sausage because I'm a veggie girl. Other than that, made as is, everyone loved it and had seconds. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was a great breakfast dish!  I read all the reviews and made these changes: I did what many reviews suggested of 1)cooking the onion ahead of time with the sausage 2) added more sausage 3)upped the eggs to 10 large 3)used one bag of Simply Potatoes Shredded Hashbrowns and cooked ahead of time on bottom shelf for 30 minutes at 375 the night before and added all the other mixed ingredients and added to hash browns and refrigerated the night before 4) I added tobasco, garlic, pepper and chopped raw green onion (1 bunch) to egg mixture.  Next morning I cooked at 375 for 1 hour and 40 minutes....it was amazing!   The cottage cheese sounded odd to me but it was exactly perfect.  I found the Jimmy Dean sausage in sage flavor and it was excellent.

So, when I first started making this, I stayed straight with the recipe, except for the sage sausage.  However, in trying to eat a little healthier, I've started putting veggies in it.  Still one of my favorite breakfast foods! The best recipe is the one you can tweek every now and then.

My family loves this. Great for any meal of the day, but we love it for dinner. Can be served with hot sauce (for my husband) or maple syrup (for the kids). Only change I make, cook the onions with the sausage.

I make this casserole all the time for family brunch. There are never any leftovers...it is that good! I would recommend using a bag of tater tots instead of the shredded potatoes. I just cook tater tots according to package directions and then press into baking dish. It is so much easier than browning potatoes. Thanks for a great recipe.

I would definitely make this again for my growing boys!   I used 1 1/2 lb cooked ground beef with a little Italian seasoning instead of the sausage. I used sweet potatoes on the bottom rather than the traditional shredded potatoes that are called for.

I added two extra egg, and substituted cream of mushroom soup for the cottage cheese. My family does not like cottage cheese. I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and a bit of cayenne pepper. We plan to make it alot more.

I made this for my family and everybody loved it. I just used cream cheese instead of cottage cheese but I'm sure it would have been great either way! :) I put onions and green peppers on half because of my family preferences. I will definitely make this again!!

Very good! Made it by the recipe but did increase to 8 eggs. Everyone even my picky husband said it was delicious. I put it together the night before to cook the next morning for a large family breakfast. Awesome!  My family did suggest when adding more eggs also add more sausage. Normally I am not a fan of cottage cheese & I usually sub ricotta in other recipes, but after I read previous reviews I decided to give it a try & I'm glad I did. Melted cottage cheese is smoother & creamer. I think it added to the cheesiness of the dish.  Next time, if I don't have to make it in advance, I would like to bake the the hash brown "crust" a little before adding the egg & cheese mixture to make it a little more crunchy. I will definitely will be making this again!

Pretty good! not the healthiest in the box, but tasty. i recommend low fat everything, if you can find it, because it's fattening to begin with and there's tons of flavor anyway. I added a can of cream of chicken soup, which was good, but I also added shredded parmesan. problem is, I put the parmesan on before baking at all, which was a mistake. after 55 minutes I had to pull it out because it was so brown on top, and the inside was soggy. still tasted good though!! next time, I'll add the parmesan ~40 mins in and bake it a little longer than an hour

This was easy and tasty with a few changes.  I used frozen hashbrowns for crust and seasoned them with salt and pepper.  I sauted my onions with the sausage.  I seasoned my egg mixture with garlic powder, a bit of salt, paprika and pepper.  I also put a little layer of 4-cheese mexican shredded cheese on top.

I made this for a work breakfast this morning, and everyone raved! They cleaned the pan in record time. My only changes were using frozen shredded hash brown potatoes--which worked great!--and adding some chopped red pepper and garlic salt  to the meat mixture. I used 8 large eggs rather than 6 jumbo. I can't wait to make this one again!

Made this for dinner last night.  It was wonderful!  I didn't have jumbo eggs, so I used 9 large eggs and reduced cheese to 8 oz.  I served with salsa and hot sauce.  Had the left overs for breakfast this morning.  Would be perfect for a church potluck!

My whole family loves this casserole; even my husband who won't eat cottage cheese. I have tried fresh potatoes and frozen- but I always prefer the frozen. They taste much better and the consistency is also better. We love to have this any time of day.

I love that you can use pre-shredded potatoes and that it can be made the night before and baked in the morning. The kids loved it as much as the adults and the chef can join the party for a change.

I thought this was an excellent base to which a person could make changes.  I used it to get a good start on a breakfast casserole that, with my changes, my friends raved about at the brunch I took it to.  I upped the hashbrowns by a cup, I used 8 eggs instead of 6, I used 8 ounces of sharp cheddar rather than 12 of mild, I changed the yellow onion to green onion, and I added diced red and orange peppers.  I added some extra flavor with dill and garlic salt.  For the potato layer, I added salt and pepper along with the butter.  I add all of my other changes to the eggs.

I've made this recipe twice and both times I served it, it was thoroughly enjoyed. This is the first "breakfast" casserole that I've ever liked. It's delicious. For the sake of time I used frozen hash browns in place of shredding the potatoes myself. I learned that this "improvised" step works best if you thaw the hash browns in the microwave, then mix them with the melted butter. I also baked the hash brown/butter mixture both when frozen and when thawed, for 20-30 minutes, and I honestly don't think baking it separately even matters. I only used three cups of hash browns, but if you want to push that mixture up the sides of the pan, you'll end up with spaces between the the hash browns, so for this step adding another cup of hash browns may eliminate that problem. I've cooked it for an hour, and also for close to an 1.5 hours. I enjoyed it both times, but I feel the consistency is much better when cooked 20-30 minutes longer than the one hour called for in the recipe instructions. If serving this to guests, cooking longer than one hour may be better, since the resulting "thicker" consistency may be more pleasing to most palates. Though I haven't done it myself, I truly think that this will turn out well if you follow the recipe, making no additions/changes. The combination of flavors is very pleasing.

I've made this probably 10 times at this point. This time I used the leftover christmas ham instead of sausage. It was so good! I use bagged shredded potatoes. I always bake them in the pan first and add a little creole seasoning to the potatoes. The rest of the recipe I follow exactly as above. I highly recommend this breakfast casserole. It also heats up really well for breakfast the next day.

This dish is so tasty and easy. I used turkey sausage to lighten up the calories a bit, 8 large eggs because I never have jumbo, and 1 tbs of onion powder because i cannot eat onions. Came out beautifully. Boyfriend said it was excellent. Thank you so much!

This is definitely one of the best recipes I've tried in a long time!! I followed it the letter except for one thing, no potatoes because I'm on a low carb diet.  I found it easy to prepare and bake and it was a total hit at our family celebration.  Thanks William Rossbach!!

This is my favorite breakfast casserole and my family is in agreement.  I don't like the ones with the bread or croutons so this one is perfect with the hash browns.  It's great the second day too!  I didn't alter anything.

This is my go-to breakfast casserole. I always use frozen has Browns that I thaw and partially pre-bake as a crust before adding the additional ingredients. I tried it using ricotta cheese once and it came out spongy with a much drier texture. I definitely prefer cottage cheese. The cottage cheese makes for a much more moist texture. My husband LOVES when I make this casserole!

Used pre-packaged (refrigerated) shredded potatoes, sharp cheddar, and 1/2 the cottage cheese. This is delicious served with a sweet/spicy salsa if you want a little extra kick.

I'm not a big fan of breakfast casseroles but this recipe was really good! The only modification I made was using frozen hashbrowns because I used all the potatoes in a soup the other day. Also, I cooked the sausage the night before. Next time I would like to cook the sausage then caramelize the onions to make it easier in the morning.

This is an excellent dish to cut up and take to work! I've been trying many breakfast items lately to satisfy my hungry husband at work and this has become his new favorite. I've found that using 4-5 cups of potatoes makes a better crust (use another Tbsp. of butter) and as someone else suggested, I bake the potato crust for about half an hour while I prepare the rest of it. My only other change is adding some seasoning with garlic powder and S&P to taste. This casserole also works very well with leftover ham or a Cook's ham steak. After it cools, I cut it into squares, put those in plastic sandwich bags, and my husband just heats it in the bag for a minute in the microwave at work. This is a very yummy breakfast or lunch dish that I will continue to make for years to come! Oh, and some hot sauce or fresh salsa adds a nice touch!

Just an ok basic recipe for a large crowd. Extremely bland if you don't add salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder plus extra veggie. I usually modify recipes and still rate well if it is a good starting point but I can't over look the no salt or pepper. Flavor-wise I would rather just make eggs, with sausage and potatoes separately.

I love this recipe. Turned out great on my first try. I happened to have Portuguese sausage on hand so I used that and it was perfect. A little spice goes along way. Great for Christmas morning or anytime you need a great, easy breakfast dish.

This turned out so good, loved it!  I used spicy sausage and frozen hash browns (thawed of course) and it was perfect!  Will definitely make again.

We love this for breakfast or dinner! I have made it several times, and the only changes I've made were to use real potatoes chopped in little squares instead of the frozen hash browns I assumed the recipe called for. I see now that the recipe doesn't say anything about prepackaged potatoes. I also omitted the butter on accident the first time and found we liked it without. I also add a little salt and pepper to the egg mixture. Overall it's a superb recipe!

GREAT!  The only change was cooking the potatoes for 30 minutes at 375 before adding the egg mixture.  Also used 8 eggs.  I also cooked chopped green onion with the sausage.

I made this one weekend for my sister so she could have food for the work week. That was over a month ago and she continues to ask for this dish. It's awesome! She's still a picky eater as an adult so whenever she asks for a meal repeatedly, it must be awesome. I used green onion sausage that's sold at a local grocery store. Pretty much the only change I've made.

Excellent recipe exactly as is.  I like to add jalapenos to give it a little spice.  Sometimes I use bacon instead of sausage, sometimes I use both.  So far, whatever substitutions I've made have all tasted good.  Thanks so much for sharing!

One of my kids go-to favorite. I also precook the hashbrowns. I have made this with parboiled sliced potatoes as well as mashed depending on the kids' request.

Great recipe!  Everyone was a fan of this casserole.  I used turkey sausage instead of sage breakfast sausage, and used medium cheddar instead of mild.  Great casserole!  I did find it tasted even better when served with salsa.

LOVED IT!  The 3-year-old ate every bit - PERFECT. My only tweak was putting in some leftover fried zucchini and rice from the previous night's dinner.  I did boil the potato about 30 min. prior to shredding it, since it was a big potato.  I don't know if I should publish this or not, but hubby had HORRIBLE FLATULENCE after eating... so bad that he would not dare eat it the next day at work for lunch :(  But he loved it the night of cooking - eating two helpings.  [3-year-old and I weren't affected in the same manner - LOL!!]

Substituted broccoli for the sausage because we don't eat meat.  Followed other reviews and added onion, increased eggs to 8, and precooked the potatoes (sub tater tots).  I thought it could have used a little salt but still very tasty.

I made the modifications that people suggested. Cooked the onion with the sausage and added diced green peppers and used 8 eggs. I also used turkey sausage because I don't like beef. It was FANTASTIC. I topped it with a southwestern black bean salsa after serving and it was seriously like heaven in my mouth. Even my two year old ate it with zero complaints.

Easy and good, two of my favorite combinations. I've made this several times. I make my own turkey sausage (sage, poultry seasoning, ginger, salt, pepper to taste), double the eggs, use almost one whole bag of hash browns and let them bake until they are light brown (then let them cool down), at least one cup of onion and voila - it is really tasty!!! You could tweak this to include red bell peppers for color or whatever you like! Definitely in the recipe box!!

Excellent! I tried this for the first time today. I didn't change a thing but next time I will add peppers, mushrooms, and maybe some ham to give it a little something different. I will also cook the potatoes before adding the other ingredients next time! ;)

Amazing tasting, great recipe! I made a few substitutions. I used organic frozen hash browns, italian breakfast sausage and green pepper instead of onion. I also sprinkled some of the shredded cheddar on top and some bacon pieces. Definitely will make again.

I asked my husband to purchase these ingriendents and by the time I got home from work he was mixing away. This is an awesome recipe. Simple and delicious. The only thing we did different was use maple sausage. And the left overs the next day were even better. Will be a weekly recipe in my house.

Not a big lover of sausage so used 1 lb. ground beef/pork combo.  Sweated a whole medium onion & three cloves of garlic and added 1 tblsp of crushed rosemary & 2 tblsp of sage to meat add flavor.

so easy. I made a 'crust' with the shredded potatoes and butter and browned it first in the casserole dish. While that was going, I browned the sausage with onion and poblano. Then I mixed all the wet ingredients. I layered the sausage mixture over the potatoes and topped that with a thin layer of salsa I happened to have. Then I poured the egg mixture over it and baked for about 35 minutes until the egg set. It's VERY good. It's sort of like a breakfast version of a shepherd's pie. I make breakfast for the week on Sunday, but because this is so good, it's only lasting until wednesday. 
I followed DivineHealth's tips for using the cottage cheese and cooking the onions with the sausage. Her review is very thorough.

I really like this recipe. Cut it in to 6 pieces and refrigerated them for ready made breakfast this week. Good stuff. The only change was that I used regular sausage instead of sage, but that was just because the store was out of the sage sausage when I went. Will make it that way next time.

Wow was this GOOD.  My husband loved it.  The green chilies are a must. And it's high-protein, low carb. Now I am wondering if I could substitute sausage with tuna?  or try seasoned hamburger for a Mexican flare?  hmmmm

If you can't find a store that carries carrageenan-free cottage cheese, then substitute the cottage cheese with a carrageenan-free brand of sour cream.  Tastes fantastic! I cut the amount by half when substituting, but the whole amount should work great too.  I also double the onions because onions are so healthy and give an extra punch to the finished flavor!

This was good. I felt like the egg mixture could've used a little more seasoning, even with the sage sausage. A little salt and pepper or something. I didn't think of it until after it was in the oven. Overall very good, though.

Loved this dish. Served it to weekend guests and there were no leftovers. For ease of preparation I used frozen, thawed hash browns instead of shredding my own. Will definitely make it again.

very good. I used the diced "simply potatoes" and sour cream instead of cottage cheese because I didn't want to run to the store, also used turkey kielbasa, because it was there. Also added 1 red pepper and a chopped onion.  This can be quite a versatile recipe.

This is incredible! Thank you for this recipe as it was awesome. And yes, change it up some too. Like the idea of the frozen hash browns. Made your original and changed it up some, used some ham too. WOW, this is a dinner staple here with my fresh eggs as well as a wonderful breakfast... but those fresh eggs get eaten in the AM here!
Oh and the addition of some sweet red and green fryer peppers are delicious.
Thank you for the GREAT START OF GOOD EATS HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Never would have thought to use the cottage cheese!!!

I had frozen tater tots so I used them instead of the shredded potatoes. Increased the eggs to 8. Added green peppers with the onion. Added diced tomatoes on top. It was delicious!! Everyone loved it. Especially with some hot sauce! :)

Yum!  The only modifications I made were to saute the onion with the sausage as in some of the other reviews and I used frozen shredded hash browns(thawed and pressed).  My husband and I thought it was very tasty.  Would definitely make again!!

This is really yummy.  I made it with more potatoes - probably 4-6 cups and added the onions to them and baked for about 30 min first. I also added 2 more eggs just because I needed more to feed my family.  It is a little bland. But we just sprinkled a little salt on each serving and that was great! 
I can see that you could do lots of variations with this: different cheeses, bacon, adding veggies (I'm thinking broccoli!).

As is, I would rate it about 3 stars, but it could be a 4.5.  It wasn't as flavorful or as moist as many casseroles are.  It definitely needs salt and pepper.  I'll probably add more eggs next time as I used the 6 jumbo and it still didn't taste very egg-y.  I may also brown the onion with the sausage next time. I definitely enjoy that there is no bread, and everyone who ate it liked it.

This was a hit with my family Christmas morning!  Since we had no whole potatoes left after Christmas Eve dinner, I ended up using left over garlic mashed potatoes to line the bottom.  I also cooked the onion with the sausage and added salt and pepper to taste based on previous reviews.  The result was delicious!  The potatoes were already perfectly seasoned and added such a nice taste to the overall dish.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Made exactly as written, just used muffing cups instead of 9x9 pan. I recommend filling about 1/2 way so they don't spill over.  Tasty fall treat!

I have made this a couple times now with a few tweaks and everyone enjoys it.  The main thing I do differently is I just slice up baked potatoes and line the bottom of the greased pan, season well, and bake until lightly brown while I cook the sausage, onion, and green peppers (my addition).  To assist with browning I use a light mist of cooking spray on the potatoes.  I stick with 6 eggs and slightly less than 16oz of cottage cheese, but I use a 9x9 instead of 9x13.  It does take longer to bake than recipe calls for in my oven as well.  Next time I might even add some mushrooms!

It was very good but bland. I added a lot of spices too. Next time I will add more. Husband and son loved it though. I also made a seoond batch with sauted mushrooms and onions. I liked that one even better and it is vegetarian.I think it was the teriyaki sauce that I used on the mushrooms.

This recipe is simple and awesome.  I followed it to exactly as stated above, except half monteray jack, half cheddar.   I could bump one of these out in minutes if I had a food processor but I only had a hand grater but it was worth the work.   If you're on a diet then keep shopping for a recipe.  
Perfect superbowl food.   It would also be good for a family breakfast. I doubled the recipe and Im freezing one, see how it turns out after being thawed.  If I remember I'll post back about my frozen results.

This recipe's a keeper.

I didn't have any potatoes so I used diced hash browns instead. It was simple to put together and fairly quick. We both enjoyed this very much. I know the leftovers will reheat really nicely in the nuker. This will definitely be made again and probably I'll use the hash browns again.

Loved this - although the thought of warm cottage cheese terrifies me so I simply upped the amount of potatoes, added in a little cream (about half of a small carton) and used those within the egg mixture instead of cream cheese.  
Next time we're going to make some pico de gallo for it too.....it was a little one note with flavor.
But still, the cook time was perfect, the food fed us for several days and best of all.....my coworkers loved the leftovers!

Happy Easter!  Made this early this morning for our Easter breakfast prior to church.  Everyone loved it!  Wish the potatoes were a little crunchier, but I'll bake them for a while next time before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also cooked the onions with the sausage.  I'll probably use more onion next time too.  Thanks for a great start!

This has become a holiday family tradition for us at Christmas and Easter.  I use a sweeter sausage, like Maple, and double the cheese.  One 12 oz bag in the casserole and one on the top!  Broil it at the end for a few seconds to get crispy cheese... yum!

This is an easy, delicious, filling recipe that quickly goes into the oven. My husband has asked for it several times since January, when I first tried it.  We don't care for sage so I use regular mild sausage.  I don't change anything else.

This recipe is quite tasty. It has become one of my familys favorite "breakfast for dinner" recipes. Im not really sure why reviewers are complaining about its dryness from the eggs. The recipe calls for jumbo sized eggs. The size of the eggs makes a difference. If you use the jumbo eggs like the recipe states then its perfectly fine. But you will not get the same result with smaller eggs. I dont understand why people expect it. But this is very good and my family will continue to love this recipe as I will keep making it over and over. :o)

All your favorite breakfast foods rolled into one!  Did the hash brown crust separately throwing in some onion and red bell pepper, salt & pepper.  Used the 8 eggs.  Was worried it wouldn't all fit in the pan, but it did, BARELY! Scrumptious!  Will make again for a brunch crew.

This is fantastic.  I used Simply Potatoes shredded hash browns and sauted the onion with the sausage.  Next time, I am going to use sharp cheddar and try southwestern shredded potatoes.  Cooked it for breakfast for Christmas  morning and it was a huge hit.

This was a huge hit.  I would like to try to make a few in smaller loaf pans for everyday breakfast.  I made this along side a french toast casserole and it was a wonderful savory complement to the sweet.  I will definitely make this again.

I used maple flavored sausage, 3 cups of O'Brien potatoes and since those had onions in them, I didn't add any extra.  As far as cheese, I used a Mexican blend that was finely shredded... and since I took my eggs out of the carton, I didn't know if they were jumbo so I added one extra to the mix.  This was DELICIOUS!  I liked that every could top it with whatever they wanted.  I used picaunte sauce, my husband his favorite habanero Tabasco sauce and my boys ate it plain.  We will definitely make this again and am glad to have 1/2 for leftovers tomorrow morning!

My whole family loves this recipe for a breakfast dinner.  I follow a Candida diet, so I omit the cheddar and cottage cheese.  I usually cook a spaghetti squash in place of the potatoes and add some Nutritional Yeast Flakes to add some cheesy flavor. I make "sausage" from a ground meat in place of store bought as well. Regardless of the changes, it still tastes great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a quick and easy breakfast casserole. I like it the original way and I like it with substitutions/additions (such as ham for sausage, different cheeses, vegetables, more eggs, etc.). It was perfect Christmas morning. My husband and I made it together (he cooked the sausage, I assembled the rest). I put it in the oven and we opened presents and enjoyed some time together. When the oven timer went off, we were ready for breakfast!

AWESOME!  We loved this tonight for Brinner, even though it seemed like I kept messing up the recipe, it was delicious.  I grated two super huge baked potatoes into a casserole dish, then poured the melted butter on them, I forgot to grease the pan and I baked for about 20 minutes at 375 then added the rest of the ingredients and baked for 35 minutes.  It came off the bottom of the dish just fine in the end.  I used a little over half a pound of sausage and 6 large eggs.  I cooked the onion with the sausage.  I was skeptical about the homemade hashbrowns and the cottage cheese seemed gross but I put it in anyway and the flavors were a perfect blend.  My husband loved it as well, and said the sausage really made the dish.  I can't wait to make this again it was so fun and yummy!

My family really enjoys this recipe.  I have made it several times now.  Sometimes I use the sausage and sometimes I use diced ham. I also add just a little dried mustard to the egg mix.  We eat this for dinner and breakfast/brunch.  It is very filling and easy to make.  Thanks for sharing!

Ok. This was an excellent recipe and I didn't even follow most the reviewer tips. I did however make it vegetarian and it still turned out great - I used frozen veggie sausages. Cottage cheese worked fine for us.

I made this for dinner one night-something different. It was easy to make and everyone loved this dish. It is one of my favorites. Next time I make it I will add more cheese to make it even cheesier.

I doubled the recipe and made it for my husband to take to work. He said it was a hit and everyone LOVED it! He wants me to make it again just for us to have at home. I did use frozen hasbrowns and browned them in oven before adding egg mixture. I also used the zesty sausage they sell at Costco.

I made this recipe for a church gathering and it dissappeared! I recieved several requests for the recipe. It is also fun to add personal twists to add to the flavor. Lots of fun!Will keep it in my recipe library from now on. Thanks!

TOP OF THE LINE! I've tried several breakfast casserole recipes on this site and this is DEFINITELY the one I will use from now on. I made the recipe as stated, however I did brown the shredded potatoes for a little bit in the oven before pouring the rest of the ingredients into the casserole dish and I made my own breakfast sausage using fresh ground pork. I don't like all the added MSG. My son can't get enough of this and is begging me to make it again. Terrific! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as stated and it was just lacking a bit of kick.  I will probably add a few more spices or spicy elements (green chiles, spicy sausage, etc.) when I make it again.  It's definitely a great base recipe!

I didn't really care for this breakfast casserole. It was very salty and perhaps could've used some bell peppers and more onion. I made it with the Creme Brulee French Toast for Easter. I definitely preferred the french toast!

Delicious!  This is extremely flavorful and a great option for breakfast.  I used frozen obrien potatoes with green/red peppers and onions, and Italian sausage.  The only thing I would do next time is reduce the amount of butter by half.  Other than that, a really delicious dish.

The BEST casserole dish ever. I have made this several times and everyone devours it. I'm not sure how anyone can say anything bad about it! I do saute the onions with the sausage and prebake the potato crust sometimes adding chopped green pepper to the potato crust. Absolutely DELICIOUS!

this was pretty tastey but all the butter on the potatoes along with the sausage made for a very greasy dish, although very tastey.

This was so easy and yummy.  I bought sausage links instead of ground (my bad) but, just cooked and then chopped them.  Will add more next time...maybe even double.  Cut recipe to serve 4.  Then it called for 2 eggs, I used 4.  Had O'Brien potatoes which worked great. As suggested by others, I baked them for about 20 minutes before adding the egg/cheese mixture. Since I had cut the recipe down, it was ready in 45 minutes.  2 men gobbled the whole thing!  Will make again for sure.

I made this just as the recipe was written...The only thing I did, was I halved it as it is just the two of us...It was really good...We ate ours with salsa on top...This went to my "keeper" file...Plus, making it in a 8x8 pan, I was able to bake it in my toaster oven to save on energy...

The kids liked this.  Don't know if the fresh potatoes were so wonderful.  Mine were grey colored in the finished casserole and mushy.   Would probably use frozen hashbrowns if I made again.

My husband loved this. If you are looking for, well... sausage, eggs, potatoes and cheese, then you'll love it too. It baked well and was good for leftovers for several days after. No alterations necessary.

This was my first run-in making a breakfast casserole.  I used frozen hashbrowns as the base instead of shredding my own potatoes.  It was a little greasy from the sausage, but the flavor was wonderful and it was even great as leftovers.

This recipe was fantastic, and SO easy to make.  I followed it exactly, except I didn't have Jumbo eggs (I had only large) so I added one extra large egg to make up the difference.  I would proudly serve this casserole to guests for breakfast or brunch.

This is the best breakfast casserole I have found so far.  Made it for my husband and three sons (12,11,4) and it was loved by all.  Then made it for my company (we do Friday breakfast potlucks).  I made one with sausage and one substituting ham, and both were gone in 5-10 minutes.  It's not fancy or difficult to make, just yummy for all ages.

This was good. I followed the recipe, except left out the onion (not big on onion for breakfast) and seasoned the potatoes with garlic salt and pepper. Next time, I think I'll try to pre-bake the potatoes like some of the other reviews suggest.  Thank you for sharing!

I also precooked the hashbrowns (I used O'Brien potatotes). Drained the cottage cheese before mixing. I served this Christmas morning which made life sooooo easy. My kids flipped a coin for the last peice. I wished we had some left over, because my guess is that it reheats nicely. I'll have to make it again and hide a peice to be sure.

I love this recipe and have made it with no changes at all and then adding a few favorite spices. Great for company and wonderful as a quick breakfast. It keeps very nicely and love it for a quick breakfast for the early risers. One of my favorites. I have to add to my review and say I make this all the time. My family is not one for cereal, so I make it and keep it in the refrigerator. It reheats very well. Since we like a little kick to our food, I use Hot sausage and add green chili once in a while.

LOVE this recipe.

Typical to my style, I altered it a bit.  In our opinion, it made it more interesting.

The first was to add some spice - a little salt and ground black pepper, since we used turkey breakfasst sausages, which aren't very salty.  

Second, I didn't grate the onions because I don't know how, so I cut them in tiny pieces.  

Before placing the potatoes on the bottom of the dish, I sauted them on a little EVOO (somewhat healthier than butter), to a rosy, crispy state.  Then, without mixing in the butter, laid it on bottom of dish.  

Prior to placing it in the oven, I beat the following together:  3 eggs (I was using Large instead of Jumbo eggs), 1/4 cup of 2% milk and 2 large dashes of (a very common, popular brand - TC) 'Original Creole' Seasoning.  This, I poured over the casserole ingredients, slightly lifting the ingreadients already in dish. This allows the liquid to combine further downwards into the casserole ingredients.

I baked it at the prescribed 375 degree, preheated oven for 55 minutes.  Sprinkled some more cheese on top and baked it for another 18 minutes.  (Please note I live at a high altitude, therefore you might want to lower the time somewhat to compensate for lower elevations and sea levels.  Things up here seem to cook slower.)

Thank you for this fine recipe!  Making it with what I had available, I ended up with 8 oz cottage cheese and 8 oz cream cheese - probably better your way, but still delicious.  I bagged up some to take to work in the mornings. Thanks again!

This was a hit in my house! I generally follow the recipe as is (unless out of an ingredient)& recommend considerations for future cooks.  As is, the recipe is excellent! However that said, I did decrease cooking time to 45 min & reduced temp to 350 @ the end cuz it looked like it was cooking to fast in my gas oven. I'll likely use frozen (thawed) hash browns in future cuz they're firmer & will consider letting them brown a bit in the oven (mixed w/ butter) to add a little crunch. Thanks William!

I substituted 4 ounces swiss cheese for part of the cheddar and , added added chopped green & red sweet peppers, 1/2 can of chopped mild green chilies for a little kick.    Also added fresh mushrooms, sauteed w/the sausage.  Very Good!  Next time I'll add a couple more eggs and cut back on the potatoes.

This recipe is really easy and just delicious. I made it for a breakfast at work and it was a smash hit. People are still talking about it over a month later. The only thing that I changed was instead of cheddar cheese I used the Mexican cheese.

Yummy!  This was a great "breakfast for dinner" casserole!  The only change I made was to sub ricotta for the cottage cheese.  I will definitely try it sometime with the cottage cheese, but I had ricotta, so that's what I used!  Keeping this one for sure!

Very tasty. Only thing I changed in recipe was cottage to ricotta because my husband doesn't like cottage cheese. I also added chopped red pepper to the mix. Will definitely make again. The whole pan was eaten in 24 hours.

This is definitely one of the better sausage casserole recipes that I've tried.  I didn't use the sage flavored sausage but just the regular original flavor.  I also used sharp cheddar...just a personal preference.  I made this the night before and just popped it into the oven the next morning.  Definitely let this sit...more than 5 minutes as it tastes better, in my opinion.  Heats up really well the next day.

This is the BEST breakfast casserole!  This is the second year I have made this for Christmas breakfast and we have decided it will be a tradition.  We make ahead the night before, use store-bought fresh grated potatoes, and use chopped onion.  Thank you for such a delightful, tasty dish!

Really great even my husband loved it.  I made it with ricotta cheese and turkey breakfast sausage and the shredded southern style potaoes from the bag with the bell peppers in it.  I served it with cinnamon roles! All I can say is Delish!  I will make this my regular Christmas breakfast meal.

This receipe was excellent.  I have made it several times for family members and friends and get many compliments every time.  I switch it up occassionaly and use bacon instead of sausage which is just as good.

I cooked this for a large group of Wyoming ranch hands and got RAVE reviews, was even asked if I catered...
I served with cinnamon rolls, from this site, for a wonderful brunch after working cows on a cool fall morning, it was sure a hit.  Will make this a tradition on Christmas morning, as made the night before and the flavors were out of this world, so the kids can ejoy their Santa gifts while breakfast cooks and I won't have to get up at 4:30 a.m. to prepare.  THANKS!!!

A great alternative to the breakfast casseroles that call for bread cubes! I prefer this much more. It is quiche-like and you can modify ingredients to your own taste. Don't undercook though.

This was great!  My mother-in-law loved it even better than her own breakfast casserole!  I couldn't find sage-flavored sausage, so I used original.  I followed all the ingredients to a 'T'.  I assembled the casserole the night before and then just popped it in the oven in the morning.  It was great - I had no left-overs!  Definitely rely on this recipe for your holiday company.

Followed recipe exactly and turned out delicious.  Next time I might try to spice it up a little with some cayenne pepper.

I thought it was good but my husband loved it.  A little too greasy tasting for me but it is made with sausage.

I actually doubled this recipe to serve 9 high school football varsity linemen.  They have a "pancake breakfast" every Saturday a.m. and rotate to a different lineman's house each week.  Last week it was my turn and I made this casserole for them.  Between them and my own 5 kids and husband, they polished off the entire thing in one sitting. Said it was the best breakfast casserole they'd ever had. I am now making it for the second time for family coming into town.  Breakfast is my "specialty" so I now have a spectacular recipe to add to the list. This is a great one!

This is a great breakfast recipe and is great to feed crowds (it really holds its heat). I followed others suggestions to add salt and pepper and I cooked the hashbrowns for 30 minutes while cooking the sausage and chopped onions. Then I added the mixture to the hashbrowns and cooked until done.

Great brunch recipe.  I took it to my Bible Study brunch, and there wasn't much left.  I'm not usually a big baked egg fan, but this was really good.  The cottage cheese is undetectabole, but necessary. I used frozen hashbrowns, warmed them up in a pan with the butter and then baked them for about 20 minutes before adding the filling. I'd cover the top with tin foil for the last 15 minutes or so to prevent over browning.  I also used egg beaters along with a few whole eggs.  This is a keeper.

This always comes out amazing. Great for church breakfast or breakfast at home. It is a bit time consuming with all the prep, but so worth the results. The key is the sage-flavored sausage. It makes all the flavors come together fantastically!!!

My husband needed to bring in a savory breakfast dish for his morning staff meeting, so I made this recipe and doubled it.  I used preshredded hash browns and shredded cheese to make the dish come together even faster.  I left out the onions for fear that some at the work place could not tolerate them. I received raving reviews.  This is a great recipe to have for feeding large groups of people at breakfast time!

i used maple flavored sausage and loved the taste of it with the eggs.  the recipe was so easy and fast to make!  but next time i would maybe add some bacon, dry mustard, and maybe green pepper.  seemed like something was missing, but it was still very good!!

Wow!  This was terrific!  The only thing I did differently was add some chopped red and green bell pepper and use frozen hash browns.  While it was cooking, I thought that the next time I might try it with Chorizo and chopped green chilis to give it a Southwestern kick.  After it was done and tasted, I decided that I'm going to leave it just the way it is.

I made this dish for a baby shower, and it was a HIT!  Everyone wanted the recipe, and it was completely devoured!  The only changes I made were: I used regular breakfast sausage, and frozen hashbrowns.  I softened the hashbrowns just a bit by putting them in the skillet and warming them up so they were more pliable.  I also added more hashbrowns to thicken the bottom layer a bit.  I did add a teeny bit of dried sage powder to the sausage, and it turned out fantastic!!!  I took the advice of another review, and made this the night before I needed it, and it still was amazing.  This is a KEEPER!  Thanks!

Excellent breakfast casserole.  I took this to an event and it was devoured.   Like other reviewers, the cottage cheese was a turn-off, but it is undetectable in the final product.   I will definitely make this again and perhaps try assembling it the night before.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years and this year my hubby liked it best...so I am re-writing my review.  I bought frozen shredded potatoes & cooked the crust at night time - then refrigerated the crust separately from the egg mixture.  Then Christmas morning I just dumped the egg mixture into the already baked crust.  I baked the potatoes for about 30 minutes or so at 350 - then let it cool before putting in refrigerator.  Also....I chopped the onions and cooked them with the sausage.  I also always add 8-9 eggs.  I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

Followed directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing!  This was one of the best breakfast casseroles I've made, and I've made a lot.  A food processor w/ a shredder attachment mades the job easier.  I just pressed the potatoes with my hands to squeeze our moisture.  The final product is fabulous.

My husband and I have been searching for a good breakfast casserole recipe and this one is it!! It was DELICIOUS!! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used 1/2 cheddar cheese and 1/2 mozarella cheese and added a few dashes of onion powder. Also, I recommmend watching the casserole closely when baking it because it only took about 35-40 minutes to cook in our oven. We will make this again!!

I am still cooking this recipe but it smells and looks soooo good. The shredding was tiresome but I bet the fresh ingredients are worth it. I will prepare a little ahead next time but this was a supper in a pinch on a Friday night. I followed the recipe exactly!

This was so easy to make and tasted great.  I'd never made an egg casserole before and this recipe couldn't have been easier.  Like most everyone else, I used packaged fresh shredded potatoes (southwest variety) and precooked them before adding the egg mixture.  I will make this again - it's a great dish for a crowd.

This was the best breakfast casserole I have ever tasted. The whole family loved it. You couldn't tell there was cottage cheese in it. I will make this over and over again!

I didn't bother peeling the potatoes before shredding them in my food processor, but will do that next time.  The skins made the potatoes a funny color.  I will also probably bake them  beforehand so they are crispier.  I used 8 large eggs.  I didn't think this had the best flavor, but my husband had seconds.

I loved this.  Great comfort food (potatoes, sausage, cheese, etc.) but also an interesting, pleasant taste (maybe from the cottage cheese/cheese combination).  Can't wait to eat it again.

Love this recipe!! I made two batches for our company pot luck - one with the sage sausage and the other with the spicy sausage and added a can of diced chiles. Both dishes were scraped clean and now everyone is asking for the recipe. I will definitely be making this again. Perfect for Christmas morning.

I thought it was okay, but after the rave reviews I was expecting more. It was simple to make and it is nice that it can be made in advance. I might make it again.

This was my first time making a breakfast casserole, and it was yummy!  I added in a can of green chiles, and that really added to  the flavor.  Next time I might season my potatoes a little bit before putting them in.

This was a very good casserole. It was almost a little dry, but very good. I got a couple of compliments on it. I did cook it at 350 degrees. Next time I will try it with a pound of crumbled bacon.

I thought this was very good put possibly missing something.  Maybe some red and/or green bell pepper???  I will make this again though and maybe just add a little hint of something else to it.

This recipe was a big hit! I made it for my family and picky boyfriend and everyone loved it! It was a last minute entrant to my lineup but ended up the star! I served it with waffles, bacon, home fries, cantalope, strawberries and whipped cream. 

The only thing that confused me was the shredded hash browns part. Make sure they're defrosted.

I'm going to give this 4 stars. It actually didn't quite come out the way I expected but it was still pretty good. I scaled the recipe to half and use maple sausage which might have made the difference. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. The hashbrowns didn't quite crisp up either. My 2 year old daughter absolutely loved it though and kept asking for more.

Exceptional! Very easy and tasty! I fried the sausage the night before so in the morning all I had to do was throw it together and bake! I used frozen hashbrowns to save time and substituted Ricotta Cheese for Cottage Cheese with wonderful results. There wasn't one bite left! Thanks for the post!

Easy to make and as always:  better the next day...if there's any left.  Used Italion sausage instead of country sausage.  Maybe a dollop of sour cream or salsa on top for a little more ooomph.

Love this recipe! Have made it 4 or 5 times, and it is delicious. If you add more hash browns it is not as crispy- a little too mushy.

I am a vegetarian so I rate preparation a 5- my meat eaters rated the taste a 4/5. I have never made a breakfast bake like this so this will be the basis of comparison for all other similar dishes. 
I got a request to make this again, by the family.

This was a nice twist on a familar brunch casserole.  I liked using the shredded potatoes rather than 10 or 12 slices of bread like other casseroles use.
