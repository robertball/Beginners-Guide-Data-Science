I followed the recipe exactly except for the topping.  I didn’t have mini chocolate chips but since it was Halloween, I crushed two Butterfinger minis and sprinkled them on top. My husband loved them and said I’m not allowed to share with anyone else:).

I picked this recipe because Gheradelli is the chocolate I usually use for baking or for a treat.. I    made 18 little bundt cakes with this recipe, for my daughter's community service group, and it was a hit.But, I had an issue with both,  the batter and the glaze, they  were too thick ! I had hard time filling the mini bundt pan. I had to use a spoon to spread the batter in the bottom of the pan. For the glaze, I had to thin it out with 2 tablespoons of  hot milk. Next time I will use extra large eggs or reduce the flour little bit.But for glazing, I will use my usual ganache..

It turned out great.  Only could find Hershey’s semi sweet chocolate chips   It was moist and yummy. The grandkids gobbled them up.  Just the right size

Very disappointed.  Made the recipe for a dinner party and it was dry and kind of flavorless.  A cross between a cake and a cookie but not as good as either. I would not recommend this one.

Very easy and cute little cakes to make for Easter. I know the grands will love them. Personally, I prefer the taste of “real” icing drizzle as opposed to melted chocolate chips.

Made exactly as the recipe was written.  Got rave reviews from everyone.  Will definitely make them again.

This didn't work at all. I don't know what I did wrong, but I ended up with cookie dough! I followed the recipe exactly. I realized that there was only vanilla and eggs as the liquids, nothing else. I added about 1/2 cup of milk, and it got more liquidy but stayed the same flavor. In the oven right now, hope it works.

Made with milk choc chips since I had a bunch already.  I’m sure semi-sweet would have been delicious.  Easy to pull together, and I’d recommend microwaving for 30 seconds just before serving as the cakes can seem a little dry otherwise
