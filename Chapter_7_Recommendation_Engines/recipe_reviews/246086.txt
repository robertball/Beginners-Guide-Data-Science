I followed this recipe exactly. I used Sweet Mango Chutney. If I was to make it again I would try Hot Mango Chutney to add more flavor. It was a touch on the bland side. Definitely need to add salt to help bring out the flavors. Served over rice!

3.9.16  I bought the smallest head of cabbage I could find, but maybe it still was too big because all of a sudden, the cabbage was taking over everything (used about 3/4 of the head).  Started out with just 1 tsp curry powder, tasted, and then added the second tsp (curry flavor was spot on IMO).  Made as written, tasted, and I added 1 more Tbsp of both the ketchup and the chutney.  Also, it was looking VERY dry, so I added a little water to help cook the cabbage.  I thought it needed some type of garnish, so I added a little toasted coconut.  Have no idea if that’s keeping with tradition, but we liked it, and I’d add it again.  Bottom line, we liked this a lot. It’s nice to occasionally step outside your comfort zone, and this was a step out for me!  Joan Wagner Teller, thanks for sharing your recipe.

I used a bag of cabbage and it was just the right amount. I used a full pound of ground turkey and I probably should have increased the seasonings a little bit. I served it over a little bit of brown rice to make it more filling and that worked well but it still was only 4 servings.

Really good and tasty. Even my daughter loves this and she "hates" cabbage.

Used a Madagascar curry powder and it missed the spot, next time I'll use a Bombay powder and add some sweet curry powder to balance it out.

Really yummy. Similar to a dish my mum used to make when I was a kid. That means 60 years ago!  Only two changes I made were ground turkey (a little healthier) and fruit chutney (was all I could find in my supermarket). I used plenty of curry powder and it was excellent. Didn't feel it was fair to give 5 stars as I changed it a bit.

This was much sweeter than I anticipated. I added extra curry powder and some cayenne pepper which simply turned it into a sweet heat. If I make this again I'll omit the chutney and ketchup.
