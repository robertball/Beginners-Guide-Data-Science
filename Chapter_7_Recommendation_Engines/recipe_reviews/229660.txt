Instead of mayonnaise, I tried this with whipped cream cheese. Very tasty.

A great way to use leftover turkey and cranberry sauce.  I used miracle whip on both sides of the toasted bread.  We all loved the crunch that the walnuts added.  One person used toasted pecans and said it was very good, also.  Definitely a little different twist for a leftover turkey sandwich !

A very tasty sandwich.  I toasted the walnuts in a non stick pan with a pinch of sugar.  Mayonnaise and cranberry on both piece of bread.   I make a similar sandwich with cream cheese and cranberry sauce mixed together which is very good.  The addition of toasted nuts is great.
