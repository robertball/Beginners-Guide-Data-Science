What this recipe is lacking is instructions!  The gelatin has to be dissolved in boiling water, the filling needs to cool before adding the eggs, and the eggs need to be REALLY stiff before folding them into the pumpkin mixture.  I used 3/4 cup of sugar and still found it a bit too sweet, and used 1/2 tsp salt to balance it. I used cinnamon, ginger and cloves for spices and pasturized egg whites.  LOVED it - reminded me of the pie my Aunt made when I was a kid!

Great recipe. I used pasturized powdered egg whites to make it safer to eat.

This pie is SO light a fluffy! I've never much cared for regular pumpkin pie, it's too heavy after a big holiday meal, this pie is the perfect replacement! exact same flavor but more of a mousse consistency.

This is a great recipe.  My Mom made it this way for years; nobody ever had a problem with the raw egg whites. However, if you're concerned about them, you can buy pasturized egg whites at some grocery stores.  Use those instead.  The powdered egg whites are not very good at all.  Also, it works well with a cup of sugar instead of 1 1/4 cups.  A bit less sweet, but after a big Thanksgiving meal, that's ok.

Thanks for sharing a great recipe! Messed up and added all the sugar in step 2, was able to get some back out. Added what I rescued out to the egg whites in step 4 and it still turned out! It firmed up after chilling and was a hit!

I followed this exactly as written. I was anxious to try this as it allowed me to use up the leftover evaporated milk I had from another pie recipe. It was a little too sweet for us and even after hours in the fridge, it was barely set. There are too many steps so I'll stick to my pumpkin chiffon pie recipe from Better Homes & Gardens cookbook.

My grandmother would make a pumpkin chiffon pie for Thanksgiving. I remembered it being the only pumpkin pie I ever really liked. This particular recipe yielded the BEST PUMPKIN PIE EVER!!!!!! It took some effort, but in the end it was light, fluffy, pumpkin-y, heaven. I will try to post a pic of our creation if I can...

I don't know why this recipe doesn't have a total of five stars.  It is fantastic.  My mother has made it for years and I have taken up her tradition.  It's the most light and fluffy pie you'll ever have.  Then once in a while you make a regular pumpkin pie which is fabulous, but just totally different from the chiffon.  It's a little extra work, but it is wonderful.

Pretty much the same recipe as my Grandmother's Betty Crocker cook book from the 1950s!  You do want your pumpkin mixture to cool until it's just warm so you don't end up with your egg whites cooking into solid clumps before you can get them folded together.  My favorite pie!

This is the absolute best recipe.  I made this a few years ago, and then couldn't remember where I found it.  My husband has been asking for it ever since!  The only thing is the raw eggs, but if there's someone there who can't eat it, there's usually another dessert they can have.  It's worth it!!

Not for someone who is a novice baker. Too many things left out like chilling the egg whites before beating, and how thick is thick? Approximate time in the double broiler would help. But it is delicious!

This recipe has been in my family my entire life.  I make it every year without fail.  It is our family's preference over traditional pumpkin pie.  However, we use Graham Cracker crusts, not pastry crusts.  It is WONDERFUL!

I’ve made this pie for decades...with one exception.  My family uses a ginger snap crust.  It really highlights the flavor and creaminess of the filling.  In fact, I’m making yet another this year!

This was delicious made as is.  Probably one of the best pumpkin pies that I've ever made.  I put the filling in a store bought graham cracker crust cooked first with brushed egg whites and cooled.  It took awhile to thicken in the double boiler but the end result was fantastic.  The spices were spot on as written and a very flavorful pie. Will definitely be my go to recipe for the holidays.

I found this to be too light and fluffy for the graham cracker crust I used. The chiffon and the crust separated when attempting to serve it and it came out very messy and unappealing to look at. I think I'd prefer to find some kind of pumpkin soufflé next time, and perhaps use some type of graham type sprinkles to garnish the top. Overall, not my favorite recipe.

Maybe I should not have used fresh pumpkin.  It did not set up quickly . After about an hour I put the mixture in the fridge and left it overnight.  Then it was no longer  runny and the recipe could be completed.  The flavor is very good and it looks pretty . Next time I guess canned pumpkin would be a better choice.

My mother cut this recipe out of the newspaper, at that time it was called Mrs. Eisenhower's  Pumpkin Chiffon Pie. She was the First Lady at the time. My Mom and I made this pie every Thanksgiving but we put chopped walnuts in the bottom of the crust when we baked it. It adds a little extra crunch and a toasted nutty flavor. Wonderful!

#1 dissolve gelatin in BOILING water, while mixture is cooling, not in the beginning of the recipe.
#2 be careful to add half of the sugar in the mixture, and reserve the other half for the egg whites.
#3 recipe makes more than what will fill a 9" pie pan and is a waste to have to dispose of the rest. 
With modifications it's a great recipe!

Just made this with homemade, fresh pumpkin puree (: Excited to taste the pie once it's done firming!
