It was great!  I don't like ricotta cheese so, as usual, when I see a recipe that calls for it I add more mozzarella.  :-)

This turned out much better than I thought it would.  It was pretty easy to put together and I liked that I could just walk away from it while the crockpot did the rest.  It does make a lot, but my neighbors didn't mind eating the leftovers.  Great recipe!

I used 2 jars of sauce and also used extra lean ground beef and extra lean turkey sausage.

I followed this recipe exactly as it was written and it turned out terrible.  The noodles were mushy and it had way too much mozzerella.  That made it almost chewy.  I also followed the cooking directions exactly and it was burned around the edges.  Will definitely not make this again.

The texture and the end result was nothing like I expected.  I will go back to baking my lasagna in the oven.  Easy - but unedible!

Next time I make this I plan on doubling both the sauce and meat amount. The recipe yeilded a very dry and noodle dominant lasagna. I think having more meat and sauce will make it much better the next time I make this. Good recipe to build off of.

As usual, I remove the ricotta cheese and replace it with a Mozzarella and Parmesan mix.  This recipe tasted good but was very dry.  Next time I will double to sauce.  Easy to make as well!
