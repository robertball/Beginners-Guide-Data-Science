11.10.2016 - Delicious and very easy to make! At the request of my husband, I added a little grated Parmesan/Romano to 2 of the breasts, but all the others were made according to recipe. I wouldn't change a thing! 5.9.2018 - I have made this a few times in the last two years, but had small sage leaves this time, and added two small leaves p/chicken breast. Wish I could remember the pre-packaged prosciutto brand I used to get, but tried a different one from the deli as I couldn't find the package. This makes a difference to me in the dish as I could barely notice prosciutto was in the chicken this time. I did add some grated parmesan cheese on top before rolling up the chicken breasts. Also, lightly seasoned outside of chicken breasts with salt and pepper first. Still a good recipe, but get a decent prosciutto.

Saltimbocca in Italian literally means "jumps in the mouth",  and that is just what this did! Tender and juicy, and very flavorful chicken dish. Traditionally this is served as a "secondo", or main course - after the "primo" or pasta course. Being that it was just our family, we ate this next to our pasta! Grazie,  Aldo, for this authentic Italian recipe!

I followed the recipe except I omitted the sage for allergy reasons and added sun dried tomatoâ€™s and Swiss cheese prior to roll up. I tied the rolls with string and grilled until done. Very good.

This was good; I used a chardonnay for the white wine.  It didn't blow me away but good just the same.  Didn't have fresh sage so sprinkled the chicken with dried before adding the prosciutto.   Easy peasy too.
