These are absolutely delicious! I read that some reviewers' cookies were coming apart, so I added 1/8 c extra flour as recommended and I made sure that I rolled the cookies into tight balls before placing on cookie sheet. I also reduced salt by half, due to reviews that the cookies were too salty. Will make again and again!

This was a big hit with my students. The first batch came out a little too flat, though (not like the picture). I added 1/4 cup more flour and 1/2 cup more oatmeal, and that made them nice and big (still chewy) without being too stiff. I'll certainly be making these again.

These are absolutely delicious cookies.  We love cookies that stay soft, and these are perfect.  I read the reviews before I made them, and used 2 tablespoons less margarine than called for.  They didn't spread flat at all, and the texture is soft and chewy.  I baked them on my air bake cookie sheet and it took about 16 minutes.  I also chopped up the walnuts real well, and every bite has bits of walnuts in it.  Delicious!!!

This was a very nice, basic, oatmeal cookie.  I am waiting for the second batch to come out of the oven now...  It upsets me when people rate recipes that they have made changes to before they have even tried it.  If you have made changes, then it is not the same recipe, and you should be submitting a recipe instead of a review.  I followed this recipe as it was written, and they are a very nice oatmeal cookie.  For those who thought they spread out to much, look at the picture.  Mine turned out exactly like that.  If you don't want a flat cookie, find a different recipe.

The cookies are tasty, but they took really long to cook at 325 degrees, about 20 minutes. I tried turning up the temperature to 350 degrees the second time around and the cookies baked for about 15 minutes. The texture of the cookies was better that way; still chewy but not too sticky.

I am always searching for the ultimate cookie recipe that makes a good snack for me. After going through all the reviews of this oatmeal recipe I went to work to create my best cookie ever. Instead of 1 cup of butter I used just 1/2 cup and used pure cane sugar instead of brown sugar with just 3/4 of a cup. I added 2 cups of unbleached flour with 3/4 tsp of  baking soda and small amounts of nutmeg and cinnamon. They were easy to mold and came out very shapely with a good chewy texture. I did not add walnuts but I added 1/2 cup of craisins to the  recipe which came out very well for the first time making these cookies. I hope to make these oatmeal cookies again.

Easy to make and good results.  I used some applesause to top off my butter and it worked out well.  I don't think it was an overly chewy cookie though as the recipe claims.

This recipe is a keeper. They do come out flat and take a long time to bake (15-18 minutes), but they are super-tasty.

Good basic recipe, not much different from the others, but very tasty and chewy. The cinnamon adds a good kick. My kids love eating them when they come home from school.

These are good, but I bet would be 5 star if I had used real vanilla extract! Its so expensive right now so I bought imitation and will never do so again, it doesnt taste like anything. Anyway,about the cookies-used choc. chips instead of nuts, only 1/2 tsp salt and left out the cinnamon. Scooped 'em with my pampered chef cookie scoop, got exactly 3 doz. they took the whole 12min to cook, didnt flatten out much at all. My husband likes them so this ones a keeper.

Good taste, but flat.  I followed the recipe except left out the cinnamon and nuts, incread flour by 1/2 cup, increased soda to 1 tsp and only put in 2 1/2 C oats.  Also cooked with 1/2 margarine 1/2 butter to hopefully not have them spread as much.  Also chilled well and still spread.  A good tasting cookie, but not the best in appearance.

My poor mom made these cookies while watching a T.V. show. Unfortunately, she got side tracked and added the oatmeal, but forgot the flour! The result was oatmeal pancakes. But, believe it or not, they were delicious. Thin, chewy, with crispy edges, but good. She made them again the correct way and this recipe is now our new favorite recipe. They are perfect.  She did omit the nuts, but added raisins. So, even if you screw the recipe up, it still tastes good~

An acceptable cookie but not one I'm likely to make again.  Given other reviewers' remarks about the cookies being flat I upped the baking soda to 1 teaspoon and that took care of that issue.  A teaspoon of salt was too much, and to others who try this recipe I'd recommend using half that. Normally a little salt makes flavors come alive, but in this case I have to think that too MUCH salt has the opposite effect, as these were kind of flat tasting.  Finally, since I used chocolate covered raisins instead of walnuts I omitted the cinnamon.  But if I had used it, it wouldn't have been two teaspoons, it would be half that as well.  Glad I tried this recipe, but for me it's not a keeper.

Followed the recipe exactly except instead of nuts I used butterscotch chips and white chocolate chips. They turned out great, the whole family loved them!

These were pretty good though I did use yogurt spread instead of butter to reduce the fat.  I used 1/4 cup more flour per the advice of another reviewer and they still fell apart.  I baked them on my stone for 14 minutes.  I'll make them again some time.

These were very tasty for such an easy recipe! High altitude adjustments: reduce white sugar to 1/3 cup, increase flour to 1 1/2 cups, temp to 350.

Very NICE recipe!  The vanilla and cinnamon give it a wonderful flavor.  I was determined to follow as written but I got concerned when mixing the ingredients about the amount of salt and the amount of flour-so I added about 1/8 cup of flour and went with 1/2 tsp of salt instead of a whole tsp.  Also, I substituted a couple of handfulls of raisins for the nuts.  I used a larger spoon when dropping the dough, and wound up adjusting the cooking time to 16 minutes.  I am a firm believer in lining pans with parchment paper, so when I was tinkering with the timing I kept checking until I could see that the tops of the cookies were not glossy anymore and the edges around the bottom were lightly browned-this yields a moist cookie with a faint crispness at the bottom which is my idea of cookie heaven.  These cookies turned out beautifully and this recipe is now officially how I will obtain my oatmeal raisin cookie fix for the rest of my life.  Good one, thanks for sharing!

Good recipe! My first time making cookies from scratch. I used a little more flour and oatmeal too to give it consistency. I substituted choc chips instead of walnuts cuz I dont really like nuts in my cookies. I cooked half the batch and refridgerated the rest. For those who say these cookies come out flat and fall apart, this is true. I had to bake mine for almost 25 minutes or so. However, I made the refridgerated batch a few days later and they came out even better. I rolled the second batch up into little balls before cooking and they came out perfect!!

I made these w/o nuts for a dinner party and they were a big hit.  My husband loved these cookies and he is not an oatmeal fan...my 2 year old kept asking for them long after they were gone.  I did have to bake them quite a bit longer than the recipe stated though.  I want to try them again with nuts and raisins.

My husband and our neighbors (impartial critics) LOVE them. The texture was not to soft or to crispy. I made some a bit larger and put vanilla ice cream between them for oatmeal ice cream sandwiches.... DIVINE.

These are delicious... read the review made me scared... I realized that my batter was a bit runny so I added a 1/4 c more flour this is due to my butter sitting out too long. Secondly I dont have time to fiddle with recipies so I cranked the oven to 350 cooked heaping table spoons of batter on the sheet to make large cookies... stick to the regular cooking instructions if you are making smaller cookies... ENJOY...

Great cookies- changed a few things though, used 1/2c butter + 3TBSP olive oil (just because I only had 1 stick of butter around), increased flour to 1 3/4 cups added about 3 1/2-4 cups of old-fashioned oats, and cooked for 13 minutes.  I used a melon baller to dole out approx TBSP sized cookies, and they barely flattened out, cooked perfectly.  Nice and chewy, stay together well, and  taste great!

This is a delicious cookie (the cinnamon is a great addition), but the final product is so soft that it falls apart as you remove it from the baking sheet.  It also took 15 minutes to bake and maybe should have baked even longer.  I'm not sure what the solution is -- a higher cooking temperature, more flour in the batter, or something else -- but I'd prefer a cookie that comes off the cookie sheet intact.

Made the recipe as written.  Bland, dry.  This does not do justice to what an oatmeal cookie can be.   8/12/12-Accidently made these again when in a hurry to find a recipe.  Omitted the cinnamon and raisins due to personal taste and used old-fashioned (not quick) oats and chilled the dough overnight in the fridge.  I still found these to be a hard, dry cookie that didn't spread.  The taste is okay, not great.  After cooking the first batch of tablespoon-sized cookies for over 20 min at 325, I up'd the temp to 350 and was able to get a chewy cookie with browned edges in 15 minutes.  I hope to not make these again, but tend to read through other's reviews without checking my own.  They are edible with coffee, but not even average in taste and texture.

Truly chewy and very delicious.  These cookies do not get flat if you bake them as directed, which is not true of so many oatmeal cookie recipes.  Good also (for non-cinnamon lovers) w/out cinnamon and with half vanilla and half almond extract.

I agree with what everyone else has said, these cookies really are the best I have ever had.
 I used regular oatmeal instead of the quick kind, and I added two cups of chocolate chips. Also, I had to cook these for 14 to 15 minutes instead of the recommended 12. Overall these cookies are excellent. I'm hooked now, thanks for the recipe!

We've made it with many variations on the walnuts, adding one or more of: raisins, walnuts, chocolate chips, cranberries and so on. Two alternatives we also like (and lowers the fat/cholesterol) is to substitue the margerine with applesauce and add (optionally) shredded carrots (quantity up to you). If you do substitue, keep in mind that it will be more chewy and more like a soft granola bar. Also, you don't have to substitute all, you can use part margerine and part applesauce, as long as the total measurement remains the same.

I like these cookies because they are not too sweet.  I do not have a sweet tooth, but DH does, so this recipe is the perfect compromise. I love the nutty flavor.  I followed the recipe as written, and the cookies did not flatten.   My 3 year old and I had fun making them.  They turned out a little on the small side, but I guess that's what happens when you have a little helper!

Been trying several oatmeal cookie recipes and so far this one is the best. The butter and cinnamon really improve the flavor. I added 1 tsp of cardoman which was just a bit too much. Next time, I'll cut it to 1/2 tsp. Also, I accidentally added too much soda - a little slopped out over the 1/2 tsp so I had maybe 2/3 tsp of soda. The cookies turned out well.

These were excellent. Im 17 and made these for the family last night just without the raisins. They loved them. I did what some of the people in the other reviews did, and added 1/4 cup more flour. Excellent and delicious. Will be making these again. Thank you. They were so chewy and came out the oven just right.

Not the best, IMO. I tried to incorporate the changes people suggested and I think that if a recipe requires so many alterations to make it "good", it probably wasn't a keeper in the first place.

Very good.  Great with a cup of pecan pieces and some baking raisins.  I prefer to use McCann's Irish Oats quick cooking--seems like bigger oats and yummier less mushy cookies.

used 1 and a half cups of flour.
used almonds instead of walnuts and increased the quantity of almonds added.
added raisins and dried currents.
added 2 table spoons of peanut butter.
cooked it for fifteen minutes.
used only half a teaspoon of salt.
used only one egg.
also used self raising flour instead of baking powder etc.

got good results, great cookie texture and if your cookie is crumbling use your head and put fewer nuts in add more flour and another egg. though their should be no problem as i only used 1 egg and extra nuts. i also rolled the mixture into balls and then flattened it after placing it onto the cookie tray and giving them space is essential since they spread. the result was an exceptionally good cookie with excellent almond-y/nutty flavor.

mmmmm, these cookies truly live up to their name. i rounded off 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon & 1/2 tsp. nutmeg for additional spice plus stirred in a handful of golden raisins with the nuts. i love texture: semi-crisp outside & chewy inside. many thanks for this keeper, beatrice!

Excellent, I made these for my husband, leftout the walnuts and added mini chocolate chips to half of the batter. The cookie was soft and chewy in the middle and crispy on the edges. Th cinnamon was a nice extra touch.

This recipe is always a hit!  I've taken it to the office a few times and people always want the recipe in droves!  I usually add 1 cup of raisins as well.  Makes a flavorful, moist cookie!  Sometimes I drop by a tablespoon for larger cookies.

I like trying different cookie recipes, and when I got a request for oatmeal craisin cookies, I used this recipe. To my surprise (I'm not an oatmeal fan), the cookies were eaten immediately! I was asked to make desserts for a big party at university, and I baked 800 of these cookies! 
I substitued craisins for nuts, and experimented once with adding rice krispies, too - it was good but be careful not to add too much or the cookie will fall apart. Also, I found that I had to bake the cookies for almost twenty minutes! It was difficult to tell when they were done, but that's the way it is with all oatmeal cookies. They come out very mushy, and you need to wait for them to cool before removing them from the pan or they'll fall apart. A great recipe!

I made these with my 2 yr old son and they turned out wonderful.  Between my husband and son there was only 1 cookie left from the first batch (12 cookies) by the time the second came out of the oven.  I did use a little leff salt then it called for.

I found these to be too salty - even with using unsalted butter!  I shouldn't have strayed from the recipe on the box of Quaker oats.

I'm not sure why other reviewers had so much trouble with the cookies crumbling. Mine were very moist and pretty tasty. The only thing I would say is that they were way too salty for me. I would lower the amount of salt to 1/4 of a tsp. and maybe cut out some of the butter.

The cookies were ok, but I had to kick them up a "healthy notch". I cut the 1 cup of Brown Sugar to a 1/2 cup. The 1C. butter became 1/2C. Smart Balance and 1/2C. Grape Seed Oil. The 1-1/4C. flour became 1-2/3C. 50/50 White/Wheat Flour Blend and 1/3C. Milled Flax Seed. The 2 Eggs were changed to Egg Substitute. 2C. of steel-cut oats soaked in 1C. Low Carb 2% Milk. No salt. No nuts. 1/3 bag of mini chocolate chips. 375° for 30 min. YUMMY !!!

Goooood Cookie!!  Like others, I added about 1/4 cup more flour - but I had no problem with crumbling, except when I tried to take them off the cookie sheet right out of the oven, when I should have waited for them to cool first.
   As for cooking time - all ovens are different, and you just have to use the suggested cooking temperatures and times as a BASE to work from - I had to lower my temp to 325, and they cooked the suggested time.
   As for those people who had problems, it sounds like they may not have measured their ingredients correctly . . . . as there far too many RAVES for it to be the recipe.
   I will make this over and over!

This is the first oatmeal cookie I tried from this site, and it smelled so nice while baking! I didn't have any walnuts so I just chopped up a chocolate hazelnut bar to replace it. It turned  out great! Oh, after reading other recipes, I also added about 1/4 cups of flour, which perhaps wasn't necessary... Next time I make it I might put in speculaas spice instead of cinnamon. It's something typical Dutch, a mixture of powdered cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, white pepper, ginger and cardamom. It smells terrific!!

Good Cookies!!  After reading some of the other reviewers notes, I used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. crisco and 1/4 c. more flour, cooked them for 15 mins., and they turned out great..... I also omitted the nuts and added about 1 c. of raisins.

Theese cookies tasted delicious but the texture was a little off because they were a bit too chewy and they would fall apart in your hand, but i think it might have been because i made them too big. Next time i would definately make them smaller, but overall everyone loved their taste.

The best oatmeal cookie ever!  I've made it a few times and had the same problem as other reviewers with the cumbly texture.  I now use 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. butter flavor Crisco, and increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups.  The cookies are still moist and chewy, but they don't flatten out and they stay whole.

THESE COOKIES ARE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!  My whole family loved them. They were chewy just as described. They baked perfectly, and weren't flat at all! I substituted the nuts for 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and they were great! I highly recommend these! :-)

In an effort to make my husband and daughter a healthier cookie, I changed a few ingredients - AND WE LOVE 'EM!   Substituted a 1/2 cup almond flour for some of the regular flour; substituted coconut oil for half the butter; substituted liquid Stevia for the white sugar (verify equivalencies); used regular oats instead of quick-cook; added 3/4 cup chopped carrots; baked them for 15 minutes. Moist, substantial and delicious.

I would have put one star but that states I couldn't eat it which wouldn't be true... Definitely didn't like! These were just too cakey- very dry... just not a "cookie" at all. Kids and hubby like flavor but consistency is terrible! Will not make this recipe again!

These were excellent!  Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I omitted the walnuts and instead put in about 2/3 c of crushed up Health bars.  This is my new favorite oatmeal cookie recipe!

My cookies also were thin and fell apart.
The first batch tasted wonderful. I added 1/4 c. flour and 1/4 c. oats after the first batch. It helped but they also fell apart but not as bad. The flavor wasn't quite as good as the first batch.

I don't know  why but these cookies came out too salty and needed to be flattened out a bit, I use an ice-crean scooper so they will be uniform so the first batch came out balled. Not sweet enough.

Replace 1 1/4 all-purpose flour with 1 1/2 Oat flour , Replace brown sugar with turbinado sugar, skip the white sugar all together. Reduce salt to 2/3 tsp.  Does not really need vanilla extract either and taste pretty good with chunks of dark chocolate.  This revised recipe is great for those who are on the genotype diet and are gatherers.. otherwise just a healthier way of making yummy cookies.

Awesome cookies!!! When i made them i threw all the ingredients (except the oats and walnuts) into the food processer and mixed it that way, then i stired in the oats in walnuts... that definatly cut down the prep time to about 5-10 minutes

Added a little more flour which made the cookies puff up more.  Then sprayed the bottom of a flat bottom glass and dipped it in sugar to flatten the cookies down.  This seemed to cut the cooking time down a little and added a little crystal sugar glaze.  I also used lard instead of butter or margarine.  Overall a great recipe.

My family and I really enjoyed these cookies!  I am not a big fan of nuts, so I added a 1/2 cup of semi-sweet and a 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips into the batter and they turned out great.  These will definitely go into the cookie rotation.

These were delicious! I took a tip from another reviewer and used 2 tbsp less butter, and I also used a cup of raisins instead of nuts.  They weren't flat at all, and they weren't overly soft, just nice and chewy, and they stayed that way for a few days.

This is truly an excellent oatmeal cookie. It came out very chewy. My son loves them. I, as suggested by another review, also added an additional 1/8 c flour and did only 1/2 ts salt. I live in the mountains so I had to cook them about 20 minutes.

Great cookies! I followed the recipe exactly, except didn't add any walnuts because I didn't have any. They baked & stored just the way we like them -- soft inside and just the slightest bit crisp on the outside. Delicious!

These were "okay".  Nothing too special.  My seven year son goobled them up, but he pretty much will eat any cookie.  They baked up a little flat but they were still chewy and tasted okay.

Not sure why everyone having probs with this recipe, mine was perfectly fine, they were not flat or runny, I did use soft but COLD butter and didn't put the batter on a warm cookie sheet either. They were cooked in less then 10 mins all 3 trays. I am not a big oatmeal cookie fan but these are quite nice and grand daughter loves them. 
To the person who said these were reasonably healthy due to oatmeal and nuts, I think the high saturated fats and high sugar content kills  any healthy thoughts.
I changed nothing and followed recipe to the letter.....

these turned out great and it was my first time making oatmeal cookies. I used raisins instead of walnuts everyone kept coming back for more will make again maybe next time i will use walnuts and raisins. I used walnuts and raisins half and half. and I find it helps if you melt the butter first in the microwave when mixing.

I used Splenda in place of the white sugar, and instead of adding the whole quick oats, I grinded them in the blender to make a flour. These cookies were delicious and my family are ready for more.

wonderful!! very tasty. Husband really enjoyed them and he is very fussy.He even asked me to make them again which made me very happy! I did add dried cranberries , milk choc chips and a few sunflower seeds to the basic recipe and only used half a cup of walnuts. I also feel this recipe is very good value for money as you get a good quantity.

These were delicious.  I halved the recipe and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ginger.  They were really good.  Next time I might try less sugar and add some raisins and extra nuts.

The name says it all.  I hope that I never bother with another oatmeal cookie recipe again.  I have made these with regular oats when out of quick and it worked fine.  Have added chocolate chips and raisins and both were wonderful.  These are crip on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  Really wonderful!

These cookies were very good.  I also added a little more flour as other cooks had done.  I guess it doesn't matter where a good recipe comes from but this recipe is virtually identical to the one on the lid of Quaker Oats!!

I should have read the reviews prior to making these. The taste was very good, but the cookies took way longer than the stated 12 minutes to bake AND
they fell apart quite easily in my hands, although the next day they seemed more "cohesive" than when I first took them out of the oven. I added chocolate chunks and chopped walnuts. I took them to the office and everyone raved! Next time I'll follow the suggestions about adding shortening and more flour.

Very tasty and soft.  I made them last night, cooled them completely, placed them in a ziplock bag, and had one with my coffee this morning and they're still soft and yummy.  I didn't have nuts, so I left them out and the cookies came out great!  They are a little salty, but that could have been a measuring error.  I'd  definitely make them again.  Thanks!

The name says it all.  I have no idea what the other where saying abount texture but this was darn close to a perfect oatmeal cookie.  The only modification I did was to cut the cinnamon in half.

Makes a nice firm, chewy cookie.  I only made half the recipe which made about 2 dozen cookies. I also added  some white raisins.  My husband raved about these cookies. I usually don't care for oatmeal cookies, but I have to admit these were very good.

Very good taste!  However, as many other readers found, the first batch was runny and flat.  After adding 1/3 c. more flour, they came out perfect.  Maybe the recipe is for "Scooped flour" (putting the cup measure into the flour and scooping it) instead of "spooned flour" (fluffing the flour and spooning it gently into the cup).  I will try scooping the flour the next time and see what happens.

GORGEOUS!  Everyone has already said it but this is a fantastic recipe.  I used all butter instead of margarine and added nearly a cup of juicy California raisins (to me, you just can't have oatmeal cookies with no raisins).  Perfect!!!  I will be making these often.

Great recipe.  My preference of cookies is chocolate chip cookies; however, this oatmeal cookie was/is so good that my position has changed.  I like Chocolate chip cookies and THESE "Excellent Oatmeal Cookies".  Add 3/4 cups of raisin to the mix, and it's all good from there!

I have made this recipe many times and they are definitely the best oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted. Everyone who's tasted them agrees and I have shared the recipe with many (always giving credit to this site.) They stay chewy for several days (although they don't last long at my house!) This last time I made them, I added 1/2 cup of the new Hershey Cinnamon Chips along with 1 cup of raisins. Delish!

Excellent cookie, just as titled! I made minor adjustments based on what we had, otherwise I followed the recipe.
We were low on butter, so I used 1/4c of butter and 3/4c coconut oil. I used kosher salt instead of regular granulated salt, and instead of walnuts I used a fancy dark chocolate bar I cut up. Wonderful!

I will definitely keep this recipe.  I used King Arthur's Gluten Free Measure for Measure flour in the exact measure of the regular flour and I'm telling you, they turned out like the absolute best oatmeal cookies I'd ever had.  This recipe is perfect!  Thank you so much!!! Unfortunately I'm unable to upload a picture but these are excellent!

Yup, I absolutely LOVE these cookies! I followed the recipe exactly, although I did add 1/4 tsp ground clove just because I love the flavour. Not too sweet as I thought they might be when I saw the amount of sugar, chewy inside with a crispy edge, and not too oily or dry, just the right amount of moisture for my taste. I think I will continue to use this as my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe. And I just might try adding a few dried cranberries and ginger! The recipe seems versatile enough to be able to change it up if you want to experiment. Thanks for posting!

I added craisins and dried cherries instead of raisins .  The cookies were delicious.  I found that the baking time was a little long in my oven.  You have to watch these carefully, the line between done and burnt is thin.

I followed this recipe exactly. The cookies are really delicious. Mine turned out both crispy and chewy. I think they have a nice sweetness but are not overly sweet. I found that if I used a  dark metal baking sheet, the cookies baked more quickly. And I found that using an air-baking sheet required a longer baking time. Like another reviewer suggested, I tried using a cookie scoop to measure an equal amount for each cookie. After I scooped the dough, I rolled it into a ball and placed the balls on a regular stainless steel baking sheet.  Thèse cookies were perfectly round after baking. They were all a consistent size. I would make this recipe again and I would even include it in my holiday baking. I would even try making bigger cookies to use for making ice cream sandwiches. I think they would be gréât with vanilla or strawberry ice cream. Thanks for sharing this gréât recipe.

Wish i could give them 10 stars! One of the best oatmeal cookie recipes we've ever tried! The ingredients take just a few minutes to put together and the cookies bake up beautifully!! And this is coming from someone who is without her Kitchenaide stand mixer and oven right now!! I whipped this recipe up by hand, and baked the cookies in my Black and Decker toaster oven. I had to let the cookies bake a little longer (about 5-10 minutes more) just because I was using a toaster oven. But my daughter couldn't wait to devour them as soon as they were done!! I divided my batter in half and added raisins to the first half, and chocolate chips to the other half. ??

Yummy! I used walnuts raisins and dried cranberries (totaling 1 cup). Rather than adding extra flour and oats like some ppl did, I used slightly less butter and sugar. They weren’t runny at all! Very good and will make again.

Very yummy. They're chewy, sweet, comforting, and delicious. Only recommendation I have is to use unsalted butter and optionally 3/4 butter instead of 1 cup to reduce fat. I used salted butter and they were a little on the salty side.

Will definitely be making them again!

This was a big hit, I made it a second time because I got so many requests. Sweet and chewy, we got rid of a lot of extra oatmeal with this recipe. One tsp sized spoonfuls is too small though, you end up with cookies that are only an inch and a half wide. Go for a tbsp, it makes a normal sized cookie around 3 or 4 inches wide. Makes great ice cream sandwiches with a little vanilla ice cream.

This recipe is excellent I have made this oatmeal cookie recipe for the last 6 yrs and I would change nothing about it.  I always get raves on this cookie recipe.  It works with or without nuts.  I will keep making it.  Thank you for sharing.

I made this without the raisins (I don't care for them) and the cookies came out great!  Sort of a spice-oatmeal cookie. I took them to a BBQ and they were a hit.

Made as others suggested by increasing flour to 1.5 cups and baking soda to 1 teaspoon. Then I chilled the dough before forming into balls and they cooked fine, not flat. I made may balls larger than suggested about a large tablespoon and cooked for 18 minutes at 325. They came out perfect . The taste is still a touch less buttery than I like, might add more butter next time

These are beyond good. They are even better the second day. I am mad at myself for making them (and eating about two dozen!). I added 1/8 cup of flower and pounded the walnuts to smithereens, in a baggy with a soup can, before adding them. So buttery and texturally ideal.

we love this cookie. Chewy yet crispy. 
Baked 12 minutes on 325 as directed. Used a 1 1/2 cookie scoop. Had no trouble with flat cookie. I did use earth balance spread instead of butter though.

I cut the recipe in half and added just a little extra oats and flour and, instead of nuts, I added white chocolate chips.  They did not fall flat and were nice and chewy!

Great oatmeal cookie recipe. The only thing I changed for fewer calories was I used a half a cup of butter and  substitute the other half for plain Greek yogurt. Everything else I followed exactly and they came out so chewy and perfect.  I've been looking for a simple chewy oatmeal cookie and thank goodness I finally found it. Thank you !

Very good.  I used raisins instead of the nuts, and yes, you have to bake them at 350 for 14 minutes.  Perfect amount of cinnamon.  Easy to make.

These turned out fabulous! I actually ended up cooking the cookies for a little bit longer than 12 minutes, and despite other reviews, they held together great and overall are possibly one of the greatest cookies I have ever had. Instead of walnuts I added cinnamon chips, and that was the best. This is a wonderful recipe.

This was a very good oatmeal cookie. The cinnamon added great flavor. People have suggested chocolate and butterscotch chips and I would also suggest raisins. Any of those additions replacements would be delicious. Very easy to make.

I added white chocolate chips and dried cranberries and omitted the nuts, everyone loved them! I think they have a great balance of a salty and sweet flavor. These truly are excellent cookies.

I think this recipe was really great!! I'm a novice baker, (extreme beginner) but this turned out good. I cut the recipe in half b/c I was only cooking for one, and added a little more flour based on the other reviews. I know this kind of changed the recipe, but it still turned out with a great flavor and consistency. Mine were a little cruncy on the edges, but the center was moist and soft.

I made these exactly per the recipe except I used regular oats instead of quick-cooking oats, since that was all I had.  I pulsed the oats, 1 cup at a time in food processor, until the oats were about 1/2 original size.  These cookies were excellent. I will make them the same way next time. I may try pecans next time, although the walnuts were delicious, too. The cookies did "come apart" slightly immediately after baking, but they "came back together" after cooling.  Just use a nice thin, flat spatula to remove from cookie sheet. I tossed in 1/2 cup raisins. Yum! Thanks for sharing, Beatrice.

These were really good cookies. They are chewy and soft. I added about a cup of white chocolate chips to the batter and they were really good. I'm going to make a batch with raisins. Yum-o!!! They do need baked a little longer than recipe suggested.

Vveerrryy good, though I added 3/4 cup flour, and a handful extra of brown sugar and white sugar (to see if they would be fluffier than the other reviewers experiences). I also took another reviewers advice and baked for 13 minutes at 350 degrees. They were a great succes!

the recipe is great but I hate walnuts and not into cinnamon... I was really looking for a good basic core recipe I could mess with and this was it.  I tweaked it a bit to fit my tastes and made a customer version, and it turned out great and so different from normal oatmeal cookies!

This is a very good oatmeal cookie. You must bake it longer than 12 minutes. I baked it for 15 minutes @ 350 using a non burning cooking sheet. This is a healthy cookie since it has oatmeal and walnuts.

I made this recipe according to the directions but baked the cookies at 350 and they took just under 10 minutes and turned out wonderful.  Might try 325 next time just to see what happens.

If your cookies are flat, it's most likely because your baking soda is out of date. Mine turned out very plump. However, due to some complaints about the cookies being TOO soft, I used slightly less better and slightly more flour. Mine are chewy, but a tad dry. Next time I plan on using a stick and a half of butter and a quarter cup of applesauce. I might try putting some chopped apples as well.

These cookies are amazing.  Especially if eaten out of the freezer (the only way I can keep stuff fresh).    Make sure you do not use instant oats.  They will turn out ok but not amazing.    I added a dash of nutmeg and raisins to mine.  They are so good!  My friends keep asking for them.  Thanks :)

Great cookies! Hard to find a good oatmeal recipe that stays soft & chewy. Omitted the nuts due to allergy, but added 1/2 cup of mini dark chocolate chips. They spread a bit, but nothing unmanagable. This is replacing my current oatmeal cookie recipe.

I'll give this a three,this was a good recipe but it just didn't stand out to me,I only used one cup of the oatmeal,I think 3 would have been too much and I used macadamia nuts also. I don't think I'll be in a hurry to make this one again.

These were nice oatmeal cookies, but not excellent.  My husband really liked them but I thought they felt like they wanted to crumble when you picked them up.  I also substituted 1 c raisins for the nuts.

These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made (and tasted)! The recipe is very easy and foolproof; you can't go wrong if you follow it exactly. And thank you for an oatmeal cookie recipe that doesn't have raisins. I can't stand the stuff! I will be making these very often!

While the flavor was nice, they fell apart.  After all the effort, all I ended up with was crumbs.  I added vanilla pudding mix to help make them soft and stay together.  I'll look for another recipe.

The cookies were doughy in the middle and fell apart entirely too easily. The taste and smell was decent, but not recommended for giving away. Choose another recipe for a firmer cookie.

Let me explain why this recipe only gets two stars. First of all, a 5 star recipe doesn't need any modifications.. and to me this recipe needed a few changes, like extra flour.  The cookies were not chewy as promised. I was looking for something new, and this recipe was not it.  This recipe is not AWFUL, but not great.

I didn't care for these right out of the oven. They were fragile and didn't have
a chewy texture at all. They were much better when they cooled....they ended up with the chewiness I was expecting. Thank you!

Great basic oatmeal cookie.  Substituted raisins for the nuts.  Tasted good....but like there was a little "something" missing.

Delicious!  When I took them out of the oven, I thought they were not completely cooked, but I allowed them to cool and they were amazing!  My husband, kids and I ate the whole pan full of cookies before they were cool!  I will double next time!

These cookies needed more sugar, I added more flour like everyone said and they ended up tasting floury and bland.  I didn't add much more and I had to add more sugar at the last batches so it had some taste.  Atleast they were healthy :P  I used eggbeaters and light margarine.

These cookies lived up to their name. It was the best oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried. I prefer them without nuts, so I left them out and added raisins. They were chewy and moist.

I had the same problem as some others...flat and needs to bake longer.  Maybe I will try again using 1/4c more flour.  I didn't really care for them...sorry!

My first batch was a little too crumbly and thin, so I added about 1/4-1/3 cup more flour and then they came out great. Nice and chewy, and tasted good. They took about 15 minutes to cook rather than 12 though.

These are great cookies!  I can't eat nuts, so I omitted them, substituting 1 cup of raisins.  To keep them moist, I put the raisins in a microwave safe cup, covered them with water, and microwaved them on high for 1 minute.  I let them stand for 5 minutes, drained the raisins and added them to the dough with the oats.  Delicious!  A keeper.

Very good! Like many other reviewers, I had to bake the cookies 2-4 min. longer and found the texture to be a little crumbly. However, the flavour is excellent! I added golden raisins to the batter and it was really good. Definitely worth making!!!

These are indeed yummy and chewy.  Mine got a little flat and took 18 minutes to cook, but as long as they stay soft I don't care!  I loved the vanilla and brown sugar taste.

OH MY GOODNESS!! Sooo good! I have NEVER been able to make a good oatmeal cookie.. Using my new airbake pan, I made these, turned out beautifully. Only cooked for 12 minutes, even tho could have went for longer, so glad I did because of carry-over baking.. Put on my cooling rack and theyre perfectly browned on bottom and so delicious. I omitted cinnamon and used walnuts, usually dont like walnuts, but taste blends awesome in this recipe!!*****

These TASTE wonderful, but I found that mine went flat during cooking and got rock-hard once they cooled.  Perhaps I used too little dough for each cookie? -- I got 5.5 doz instead of 3.5 like the recipe says.  I guess I will try them once more, but I'm not sure what to do to "stay out of the rocks"!  These disappointed me - I hate MAKING cookies, but love EATING them... so, to me, these weren't really worth the effort...!

I modified this recipe slightly.  I used 1/2 c. toasted oats, 2 1/2 c. regular and I cut the amount of salt in half.  I also added coconut to half the batch.  After cooking, I piped melted white chocolate on the coconut ones and I piped melted butterscotch onto the regular ones.  A tasty cookie.

This recipe is a great base for some yummy drop cookies.  The first batch we just used pecans, and it was ok.  The second batch we used butterscotch chips and pecans, for a very yummy result.  The third batch we added chocolate and peanut butter chips for a peanut butter cup delight!  I also used almond extract in the second batch in place of the vanilla.

I eliminated the cinnamon, since that's not my favorite spice.  Because I live in Colorado, I had to increase to cooking time by 3 minutes.   These were excellent.   My other half is enjoying them tremendously.

I guess I messed this recipe up by adding extra sugar.Cookies were very very flat and crispy. Taste was excellent though. I'm considering crumbling cookies and adding to another desert. Hate to throw them away but noone will eat them. But like I said, tasted wonderful.

Completely awesome!  I subed choc. chips for the walnuts and also raisins.  Not a problem.  Stayed chewy and moist, this would have to be the best oatmeal cookie I have ever tasted!

I must have done something wrong.  My cookies were very dry.  It was like eating oatmeal right out of the box.  My daughter and I had fun making them.  I will try making these cookies again.

Very easy recipe, with great results.  Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I will definitely make these again.

I thought these cookies were pretty good!  We are not a very "salty" family..and these had just a bit too much salt for our tastes, next time I will just decrease the salt.  And there will be a next time. :)But they were nice and chewy!

I made these with part applesauce and part butter. They are more cake-like than I like but they are still good. I will probably use only butter next time. I added raisins and even some carrots (my kids love them and don't know they are so good for them:)

I will make this cookie again--I made them as a thank you for our swim teachers (high school and college students), the students ate them all up!!  My two younger daughters were the taste-testers, one of them said it tasted yummy like snickerdoodles with the cinnamon.  I added butterscotch chips and omitted nuts.  They all wanted more, next time I will have to double the recipe.  They were all gone in one day!!  :)

I went looking for a chewy oatmeal cookie, not the cake kind and boy did I find it! This recipe is DELICIOUS! It was easy for me to let my daughter help me to because of the simplicity of the recipe. 
This is the BEST oatmeal cookie I have had in long time. I am glad you shared your recipe with us.

This was my first attempt at an oatmeal cookie and I love this recipe.  My husband is very picky and he just raves about these cookies.  I have made these with raisins instead of nuts, and without raisins or nuts and EVERY time, they are wonderful.  Thank you for sharing.

Wonderful cookies!  I added more oats to replace the nuts for my walnut hating roommates.  Super kid friendly, meaning college kids ;-)

An excellent cookie.  Easy to make, simple ingredients and a cookie that disappears very quickly.  My daugher loves soft chewy cookies and these were a big hit.  This is a recepe I will use often.
