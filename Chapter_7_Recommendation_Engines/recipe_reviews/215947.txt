Really enjoyed this recipe.  Only used a different cheese b/c I had it on hand.  I love chicken parm., and this is different.  I think I like it more.  It is a lot lighter meal to have and very tasty.

I skipped the breading and used skinless chicken breasts. Tasted great!

me and my big sister Xoei made it without the dried basil and the red pepper flakes. we also didn't have tomato soup so instead we used tomato sauce and 4 ounces of water and Italian seasoning. it was amazing we will make again!

Very good and I'm pretty picky. I marinated the chicken before browning in olive oil, garlic, onion powder, and Italian spices.

Easy Easy Easyâ€¦Browning the chicken was the longest part.  Four kids very happy and husband ate the rest from the pan.  I did put it in the oven to melt and get bubbly.

Forget The skillet. Except for the cheese, simply throw it all into a slow cooker for 10 hours. Delish!!!!!
