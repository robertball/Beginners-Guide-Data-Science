This was very easy! We used only 1/2 tenderloin and halfed the recipe. Then the "rub" we used half and left the rest fresh for dipping after the meat was cooked. Also cut the cooking time down to 35min. It was wonderful! Unusual to cook the Avocado but tasty never-the-less. This is worth a try if you are looking for an EASY new way to do a tenderloin! (We also used 1/4 of Santa Barbara sauce in place of the 1/4 steak seasoning. Santa B. sauce is a cross between salsa and steak sauce. This seems like a negotiable part of recipe)

Loved this recipe!  I used Worcestershire sauce since I didn't know what "steak seasoning" was but the "bite" of the Dijon mixed with the coolness of the avocado made a wonderful complement to the tenderloin.  And so easy!

I don't normally eat roast so perhaps this is why I did not like it.

This was really good.  It translated well to two individual tenderloins grilled under the broiler.  I didn't taste the avocado outright, but I'm sure it affected the overall flavor.  The Dijon was prominent and I liked how it tasted with the filet.  I used Paula Dean Steak Seasoning.  I will make this again!
