I tried this with diced chicken instead of ham and added diced green apple. I cut the mayo in half and substituted  light sour cream. The crunchiness of the almonds and celery was nice, but this dish still lacked flavour. The taste of the cider vinegar was not pleasant. Not a bad recipe, but needs some variation. Needs flavour.

I gave this 3 stars based on the recipe, as written.  I've since modified the recipe to suite my family.  I added 2 red delicious apples (diced and dipped in lemon juice), cashews instead of almonds, red onion, Craisens instead of cranberries (less tart), and reduced the amount of cider vinegar and sugar.  This recipe is a good jumping off point - modify to your liking.

Very tasty. I used 2 cups turkey, veganaise, 1/2 cup green pepper and red onion. I used 3 T of the vinegar and no sugar but I donâ€™t like things sweet.

I used diced chicken that I had left over in my freezer (and added a little bit more than indicated for more protein in my one dish lunch). Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I loved it! It IS rather sweet, but that can be easily adjusted for those who wish. I like more crunch, so next time, I will add more celery and almonds. But this recipe is easily adjusted for individual tastes. (Update: The sweetness was toned down considerably several hours after the pasta sat in the frig. My dinner meal was much less sweet tasting than it was at lunchtime.)

My husband loved it, I think it needs something for a little more zip- maybe chopped  red onions?

Really good.  I added a little extra mayonnaise.  The sauce was a little too sweet for me.

I used to purchase a cranberry almond pasta kit through a kid's fundraiser and LOVED it. Found this recipe through google search.  It's great! I'll make a smaller portion of the dressing mix next time, but otherwise I loved it! I skip the celery.. simply because I don't like celery.

I would do 1/2 cup mayo, 1/8 cup vinegar and 1/8 cup sugar.  I also added about 1/2 cup of fresh chopped basil which gave it a wonderful basil flavour.
