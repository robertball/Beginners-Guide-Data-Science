Perfect recipe--my mom made these cookies and they taste just the same. You have to bring them to a FULL boil and then boil one minute, they won't set up right otherwise (i.e. you'll get goop).  Also, use quick cook oats. The old-fashioned oats will give you a chewy, uncooked texture.

I mix the cocoa (about an extra tablesoon) in with the sugar, BUTTER and milk before boiling, to eliminate lumps from the dry cocoa.  Otherwise, spot-on, and killer NoBakes!!!

Thank you for your pinpoint perfect directions.  I did bring the mixture to a full boil just before timing, and I did use quick cook oats.  I made these for the first time last week, and my family and all my drop-by guests loved them.  Very easy to make.  A keeper!

Ive been using this recipe for years, but just now signed up on the site.  I love this recipe, although I usually add a little more peanut butter and a little less sugar.

I've been making these for years and love them. I just wanted to mention that if you don't like chocolate they are just as good when it's left and it doesn't effect the texture. I've also added nuts or raisins to the chocolate cookies for a different taste. Great little cookie.

These go quick no matter who you're serving them to!!  One year we made them as holiday gifts for my daughter's teachers and added a pretty card with the recipe on it - it was a hit!!  Super-easy recipe and I usually have all of the ingredients on hand, so I can make them when I get a craving!!

We made this recipe last night. Talk about goop. I am not sure what I expected. The taste is good, so I think it would be a fun toddler type recipe, but for adults it was laughable. I wish I could give advice on what to do to make it better, but truth be told, I don't think there is a way.

Made these and they were just like the ones I remembered from my childhood 35 years ago. Not quite Proust's madeleines, but close! I mixed the cocoa into the butter/sugar/milk mixture before I turned on the heat.

OK, but not brilliant. Maybe better for kids, but not a cookie to serve to adults. It was a little more like chocolate icing with oats in it, rather than an actual cookie.Very quick to make!

I thought this was a very easy and quick recipe and they came out great. I made sure to stand by the stove and time the boiling exactly. I didn't have vanilla extract floating around so I just threw in some cinnamon and it added a great extra flavor. Next time I might try experimenting and subsitute the milk with chocolate or vanilla soy milk to see if it'll give it an extra boost of flavor. I made them big so I definitely didn't get 48 of them.

I made it as the recipe called. Found them too sweet, and not enough peanut butter. I adjusted the sugar down to 1-1/2 cups, and added an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter. I also added cinnamon. It's a nice touch! A small note of cinnamon at the end!

I have made these cookies all my life, since 8th grade, everybody in my family loves them. My son in California keeps begging me to ship him some. We like to call em poop cookies (because the 1 person that didn't like them, my ex, called them sh*t cookies lol) I like to make a double batch and cut out 1 cup of oats, they are perfect like that for me and my family. Oh yeah, and 4T of cocoa is 1/4 cup!!!! Easier to measure that way! Delicious!

This recipe is yummy and super quick! I think I made my cookies a little too big because I only made about 2 dozen but the recipe says it makes 3-4 dozen. The recipe doesn't specify type of rolled oats. I used quick cooking oats. I am definitely going to be making these again!

This is the first time I have made these. I am very happy with the way they came out. The directions were very easy to follow, the only thing I did different was I poured the liquids over the oats made it easier to stir. They remind me of my grandmother's. I cant wait for my family to try them. Thanks

I made a few preference changes to this recipe and enjoyed them thoroughly. An additional teaspoon of vanilla, and substituting dark cocoa which I added to the first ingredients prior to boiling to ensure no lumps in the process. I believe I would drop the sugar to 1 1/2 cups if I were going to use regular cocoa.

quick and easy. make sure you bring the sugar/milk/butter to a full rolling boiling before counting the minute. i actually used half regular oatmeal and half flax seed and cranbury oatmeal. delicious and added nutrition!

Every time there is a family party, I am asked to bring these.  They look like you spent a lot of time but, they are so simple.  I like to refrigerate mine so they harden a little.  I have also added Chow Mein noodles which gives them more crunch.

These were easy to make.  The cookies can be shaped better after they cool on the paper a couple minutes.  They taste much better after sitting in the fridge all day.  They are sickening sweet with a very soft texture, more like candy than cookies.  A little too moist and sugary for my taste.  It was fun to try, but one of my kids wounldn't eat them so we won't be making again.

Every time I have made this recipe it has come out perfect. Not too gooy and not too crumbly.  You just have to know when to start timing the boiling process. I have had so many people request a copy of this recipe.
