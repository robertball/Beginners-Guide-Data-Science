Great flavors and so easy to make. A couple of months back I stumbled upon the  garlic and herb Jack cheese so I already had it on hand. For the buns I always keep a bag of RhodesÂ® bake N Serv soft dinner rolls on hand and they bake up perfect in the CIO in a 9x9 baking pan. I did the burgers 6 minutes turning at the 3 minute mark and they came out perfect and juicy. Thank you Cliff for a great recipe and "Welcome home brother!"

It was delicious! I made it for my little sisters birthday (we were barbecuing) and she LOVED it! My mom even asked for the recipe, and she isn't even a cook! One thing I did differently was I used cheddar cheese, but it still tasted amazing! I can't wait to make this again!

WOHOO!  These were great!  My son, who isn't a slider fan was completely won over by these little gems.  He ate his...and mine.  The only change I made was using regular Romas instead of Heirlooms, simply because that is what I had.  I can't wait to make these again with all sorts of different cheeses!  Thanks!

These had great flavor and were very juicy. The induction oven and this recipe makes a great combination for a great burger! I had never heard of garlic herb cheese before and was excited to try something new on my burgers. I had some frozen roll dough that I baked up for the buns. Prior to grilling the buns I brushed with melted butter instead of using the spray and sprinkled with garlic powder. I also used the butter on the veggies before grilling. When I think of slider I think little but these "little" gems were far from little. Even though it is a 4 oz. burger they're quite large. I'm not a huge fan of warm tomatoes but decided to try the recipe as is. The warm kind of "mushy" tomato was a delicious addition to this burger, no need for ketchup and much fresher tasting. The method for cooking the onion is spot on, not crunch and not mushy, just perfect. Love the gooey 'hidden" cheese in this. I made one without bun for me and hubby gets the buns! Good either way! And the grill marks! Love the grill marks! Cook time was spot on all the way around! Great job Cliff!

I love sliders and stuffing them with the herb & garlic cheese put them over the top!  They were juicy and full of flavor.   I didn't grill the tomatoes, but, the onions cooked perfectly.   Thanks for the great recipe!

Juicy burgers at it's best. If you are looking for a great way to serve up some burgers at your next get together this is it.  I can see this being a hit for the kids. No more eating only half a burger. I used premade slider buns brushed the buns with melted butter before toasting. I could not find the herb and jack cheese so I used half pepper jack and half colby jack (half a slice per burger) went great with some mac and cheese. Quick easy meal to get dinner on the table quick.  Thanks for sharing.

These make great game day food.  The CIO does an excellent job on burgers.    I opted to not grill the tomatoes but the grilled onions were great.

These were delicious! I love how quickly everything came together. To the meat mixture I like to add a tiny bit of water to keep them moist  and make them easier to work with. I couldn't find garlic and herb pepper Jack so I had the deli thinly slice me some garlic cheddar and pepper jack cheese separately. I cut each slice into quarters and paired them one with each. Heirloom tomatoes didn't look great either so I bought mini orange and yellow tomatoes instead. I used olive oil and salt and pepper to season the tomatoes and onions instead of cooking spray and I added 2 minutes to the onions after flipping them. I used Hawaiian rolls and brushed some butter on them before cooking them. When I assembled them I added some sriracha mustard to each mini burger. These turned out fabulous! The Panasonic oven makes these so easy to put together.
