This is the first time making these bars, but I am having trouble with the recipe.  It says to use 1 package of yellow cake mix.  Now, am I supposed to actually make the yellow cake mix according to the box/package that it comes in and then start following the Rolo recipe or only use the yellow cake mix powder itself and then start adding the nuts, butter and milk, etc.?? If anyone could give a hand, it would be greatly appreciated!  Good Day and thanks!

I have not made these myself.  My sis-in-law mentioned them to me and said they are DELICIOUS!!!  I will be making them soon.  Anyway, I wanted to post so that anyone making this recipe will not be confused.  You do NOT make the cake per the box.  You just add the butter and evap milk.  Follow the recipe from there.  Hope this helps!

These are very good bars.  Even my husband's grandmother asked for the recipe.  When she's impressed I know it's a good thing!

I too was confused exactly how to make this recipe.  I did not mix the cake mix with anything but the evaporated milk & melted butter.  I changed it some too.  I did not add the nuts and used a butter pecan cake mix instead of yellow (it was what I had on hand)  (((next time I might try chocolate)).  I also did not cook the first layer at all.  I just layed it all and cooked it about 25 minutes total.  It turned out fine.

These were very good everyone liked them.  the only part that was time consuming was cutting up the candy. Next time I might try chopping them in a food processor

These were very easy to make and tasty too! My family doesnt like nuts, so I
left them out. The end result was a chewy chocolate and caramel bar with a bit 
of a crunch. Yummy!

Excellent cookies. Received rave reviews at the party we were at. I omitted the nuts due to a nut allergy and they were terrific. I would love to try them with the nuts too.

Good but very sticky and hard to get out of pan.  Doesn't make a pretty presentation.  Easy though and the flavor is great.

This recipe did not turn out at all!  The bottom was over-crispy and the top was kind of mush, and they didn't look very nice.  We ate two.

I saw the reviews on this cake and couldn't wait to make it. Well, I have to tell you I was very disappointed. The batter was hard to work with. (very thick and sticky.) The cake when it was finished cooking and cooling was hard to cut and chew.I did give this 2 stars because my 5 year old daughter had a great time opening and counting the rolos.

These were good however  the bottom layer became almost over done while the top layer was still on the doughy side, next time I think I will bake the bottom a little less and leave it in the oven a little bit longer with the topping on.  I will definitely remake this, everyone loved it even though it didn't come out quite right still tasted good.

These are okay.  I didn't have any rolos, but I used caramel filled Hershey Kisses, which are basically the same thing.  Most of the flavor that you get is just boxed cake mix.  Most of the caramel melts out of the candy and so you don't get a lot of that flavor.  My kids did enjoy a few pieces in their lunches, but I most likely won't make again.

Yummmmm!  I made these with a Devil's Food cake mix and left out the nuts due to allergies.  Also, used mini rolos to avoid having to cut them.  So easy and they turned out fabulous!  Tasted like a caramel brownie but with a devil's food flavor.  Highly recommend!

These turned out so hard, no one could eat them without breaking a tooth off . . . I think there is something incorrect in the cooking instructions.

The best caramel brownie bar ever! This disappeared fater than anyother desert I have made for my DH. I bought a package of rolos thinking they were his fav. I was wrong, he doesn't even really like them. So, I was happy to try anything to use the bag. I made many changes so that I could use what I had at home. I had a chocolate cake mix and I didn't have any nuts and I used up all of the bag of rolos.  YUM! It was the best caramel brownie type of bar. Next time I will make it for company so that I don't have a chance to eat half of the pan.

I followed the directions, but still found this hard to spread into the pan, and "dollap" once I baked the first half. THe end result wasn't pretty looking at all, I actually made buttercream frosting to cover it up. I would have only rated a 2, but my husband really liked the rolo candy idea. If I ever make again I'll use an extra cake mix!

I haven't tasted what I baked yet, but they look delicious! A nice addition to my annual cookie boxes! One thing to note, I found the dough to be extraordinarily sticky. What I'll do next time is use the first baking time to prepare little balls of the remaining dough. It should be easier to drop the individual balls for bake #2. Might make it less frustrating. Overall, easy and I'd definitely try again.

I read the reviews (too sticky, too gooey, too sweet) so I used half the # of Rolos - and I added the top batter before baking. Came out perfect (23 mins. bake time), tasted great and looked beautiful.

What? I think I triple checked the recipe if I was possibly doing something wrong because it was very hard to spread. Man, I had my eyes on these for a long  time and Im just so disappointed. There's some flavor in there, I just won't make it again though.

It was impossible to spread the batter with only 1/4 butter. I doubled the butter and the recipe turned out great. It saves time to cut the candy before unwrapping it, though you have to check the caramel for foil fragments.

I love everything about this recipe. 1) Requires few ingredients 2) Incredibly simple to make 3) Delicious! I think 25 min was a little too long (at least for my oven). Next time I'll check on them after 20.

I didn't have cake mix on hand (it was also too late to go to the store), and so I used a recipe I had for Homemade Yellow Cake Mix.  Unfortunately these bars turned out more like a chocolate toffee cake than a cookie bar, but it tasted good all the same.  I figure next time I'll actually try using store bought cake mix.  If it still doesn't turn out as expected, I think I might just use the rolo's in place of choco chips in a Chocolate Chip cookie recipe.

My niece Jessica made these for a dinner party as written and they turned out wonderful.  Several of our family members are asking for them again.

These aren't as sweet as I expected. They taste better when they sit overnight.

This recipe is so much better if you use a devil foods chocolate cake mix.

I adjusted this recipe but I'm giving it 5 stars because I'm sure it would taste just as good made exactly as the recipe states.
I used a moist chocolate cake mix because it's all I had on hand. I also used the mini Rolo candies instead of cutting up the regular sized ones.
when it came out of the oven, I sprinkled mini marshmallows on top, then put it back in the oven for a few more minutes - just until they puffed up. I took it out and used a greased spatula to spread the marshmallow until it covered the entire top. Then I popped it back in the oven on broil until the marshmallow was slightly toasted.
Once cooled, I drizzled melted chocolate on top.
This tastes similar to a brownie, with chewy edges and a yummy s'mores flavored topping.
It was an easy recipe that my young kids enjoyed helping me make. I will definitely make this again.

Four-star based on my review, and based on family reviews from our Christmas party.  Everyone really liked these the most, and there were a lot to choose from.  My 10 year old daughter made these and she could pretty much do it all herself.  I helped with the 'dollops' after cooking and chopping.  They came out great and are still pretty good 3 days later. Be sure to really just drop the teaspoon-fulls in the second baking step. It makes a difference.

You can half the Rolos as suggested by some reviewers, but whole ones work fine too.  They for an A+ rating from several 14 year old boys!  Goo

Great recipe, very easy.  I made ours without the nuts and used small peanut butter cups cut in half, a big hit with our crowd!

This is a really "blah" recipe that doesnt have hardly any flavor. I  used a different candy that was pretty much the same and it still was nasty.  Use a different recipe.
