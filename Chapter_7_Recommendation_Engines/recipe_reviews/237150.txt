This was a surprisingly good, yet easy macaroni and cheese pizza:) My commissary in Germany doesn't sell cavatappi pasta, so I had to use plain elbow noodles. I used a cup of noodles, cooked them to just al dente, and once I added the cheese sauce and butter, liberally added salt and pepper:) I also used quite a bit more than a half cup of shredded cheese, as I wanted the browned cheese on top! Overall a pleasant surprise and my husband, 2 year old son, and I really enjoyed it!

Very good. I am a 16 year old and I was able to make it. I love mac and cheese and pizza so combining these made me so happy!! Def would recommend.
