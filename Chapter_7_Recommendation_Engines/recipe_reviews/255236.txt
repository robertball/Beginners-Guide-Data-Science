I am the author of this recipe and I want to add a couple notes.  Generally I make 2-3 batches of dumplings for each whole chicken.   If you like more dumplings than chicken,  boneless is probably the way to go.  If you use a whole chicken get a roasting chicken, not a fryer. More fat, more flavor.   Don't scimp on the flour.  This dough can get sticky and flouring your surface will prevent it from sticking to your counter.  Also the more flour, the thicker your soup will be.  If you choose to add frozen veggies it is important that you add them BEFORE the dumplings and that you bring the broth back to a boil.  The dumplings must be dropped one at a time in boiling liquid. I hope you enjoy!

Love love love this recipe! This is where my heart is! With so many people trying to recreate the wheel, this was a comfort recipe and a comfort food. Love this technique,  I love using the broth to make the dumplings! If you think your dumplings will be plain Jane, you're so wrong. The seasonings of the broth transfer right over to the dumplings. I used left over chicken breasts and drum sticks. Deboned them then threw it all  (bones and all) in the pot to boil and make a broth. Pulled out the bones with tongs before adding dumplings.  Whole family ate it and loved it. Thank you so much! This is definitely a keeper. I feel recipes like this are hard to come by, felt like it came with a little peice of history. (For me. I realize this maybe old hat for some.) Couldn't be happier. Next time I will take a picture.

I made this for my mom on her 69th birthday. I added fresh peas and sliced carrots. She said that it was just like her grandma used to make for her birthday when she was a child.

Perfect comfort food and my kids said it was just like Cracker Barrel but better! I’d never made dumplings and they were easy and came out perfectly using this recipe. Even my mom (who is an incredible cook that makes everything from scratch) asked for the recipe. Classic and delicious!

Have made this a few times... absolutely delicious. It is better than Cracker Barrel. I however did not add the lemon and added some frozen peas.

Loved the dumplings this way!  I did use boneless chicken breasts and cooked them in the crockpot with broth and the lemon, then I continued the dinner on the stove and added more broth and veggies. Yum!

This recipe is very similar to the one my grandma taught me.  The broth makes it the best.
  Season your broth because that is what your dumplings will taste like.  My recipe uses an egg in the dumplings but that is the only difference.

This recipe is the way I make my chicken and dumplings, it's no fail, and delicious.  The only thing I'd add is to be sure to let the dumpling dough rest for about 20 min or so, the dumplings will roll so much easier.

I had doubts about putting lemon in the soup, but I did... don’t make the same mistake! Tastes horrible! It’s bitter and sour! Would’ve been much better without

THIS IS DELICIOUS! I love cooking the whole chicken and making this deliciously flavorful broth. And using the broth to mix into the dumplings is a genius idea. I made as directed the first time and every time after that I’ve doubled the carrots and celery and like it even more. The house smells so wonderful and I look forward to making this every time.

I felt that this was a rather easy recipe for the dumplings...I tend to be scared away from making scratch dumplings/pie crusts/etc. because I haven't always had the best results.  But the dumplings were delicious!  I added garlic powder and extra pepper and they were so tasty, plus I really truly love the flat or "slippery" dumplings best.  Big balls of dough (i.e. drop dumplings) are not my cup of tea. Sadly, I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of a bone-in chicken so my broth was seriously lacking some flavor.  That was MY fault, but next time I know better.  I thought this was rather easy and hassle-free.  Thank you for a delicious recipe!

First time making this. Followed the directions all the way and was not impressed. I thought it would come out thicker but it didn’t. I thought it was lacking flavor. Will not be making it again.

I love these dumplings and I sometimes make fluffy ones but I think you should change the name or add in the description that it is a recipe for hearty homemade noodles or noodle dumplings or something similar so the people will know its not a fluffy dumpling it's a dense flat dumpling.  Otherwise it's a great recipe. People should know that they can add more and different kinds of vegetables if they like after all it is soup :)

I loved it,  this is just like my grandmas.  i used chicken leg quarters and doubled everything so it made a huge pot...at the end of cooking before you take out the chicken you can throw in a few bouillon cubes if its  not seasoned enough for you or try some Bells chicken seasonig...    LOVE THIS  LOVE THIS LOVE THIS !!!!!!!

I have made this recipe several times.  I strained the broth after the chicken was done.  I also juiced the lemon--did not use entire lemon.  Just like CB chicken-so good and NO leftovers!  The dumplings are not supposed to rise--they are like thick noodles that cook down to thicken the broth.

I would recommend not leaving the lemon in while cooking the chicken. It's way to acidic. Other than that it's a fantastic recipe! Making it again today for my family(minus the lemon).

I gave it 3 stars because it wasn't awful, but my family didn't care for it. The general comment was that it tasted like chicken pot pie filling. They aren't fans of that either.

I am making this right now and I find the recipe is too vague. Roll out dough into a large rectangle???how about how thick the dough should be. I have added more seasoning to the broth because a pinch of salt seems like nothing. I cut the dumplings into circles just because. oh, and I added a bit of baking powder too the dough because you should. when I first looked at it It looked good, but now I am leary. I'll let you know. so my dumplings didn't rise at all. I think next time, make a dough more like a biscuit dough, and drop spoonfuls in, as I have made other dumplings this way. this is the first time a recipe on this site has disappointed me.

I made this recipe as directed except that I added a bag of mixed vegetables.  The dumplings were heavy and not too appetizing.  I won't be making this recipe again.

Not much flavor. Added a bit of salt, that helped a lot. Needs more vegetables. When you think you have enough, double it. Will make again but I’m thinking about pan frying the vegetables with soy sauce for a little extra salty flavor. Why not.

Followed the recipe to the letter and found it to be a bit thin. Next time I’ll add more veggies to make it heartier (I’m thinking some mushrooms, more carrots and celery, and whatever else is in season).
