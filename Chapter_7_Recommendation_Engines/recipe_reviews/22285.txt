I'm sorry to be the one to give it a bad rating... I have never given anything on this site a poor rating... I usually just don't rate, but I was really craving shoo-fly pie, and I was so disappointed with this one.  I ended up throwing it out after one slice.  It could be an okay pie, but I don't consider this shoo-fly pie.  I think the best recipe on  this site is Grandma's shoo-fly pie (you have to hyphenate the shoo-fly to find it on this site).  It uses shortening instead of butter and an egg. The consistency is not right, and neither is the crumb topping.  I'm from Lancaster, too, and I've never had a shoo-fly pie with this consistency before.  Guess I'll be back in the kitchen making a different one tonight.

This is the best kind of pie ever.  You have not lived until you have had Shoofly Pie.

I can not seem to duplicate the awesome shoofly pie in Pennsylvania Dutch country, but this one is certainly the closest I have ever found!  I actually used a graham cracker crust, as it was all I had, and I think it absorbed a lot of the liquid, so it came out more like a cake, but still wonderfully sweet!  (Note, when using an 8" pie plate, cut down the recipe to about 2/3 of all the ingredients listed, ie. 1 cup=2/3 cup, etc.) I will use the unbaked crust next time, and I'm sure it will come out just as good.  Don't be alarmed if the layers aren't quite layers.  I alternated layers like the recipe describes, but it ended up looking like a bunch of crumb topping mixed with the liquid molasses mixture.  It still came out great!  I agree with the other reviews, Shoo Fly Pie is the best pie EVER!

I had an entire bottle of molasses expiring so I decided to make this pie. My step father is from PA, but said he disliked the pie when he had it there. BUT I made this recipe and I swear he ate half the pie! Very easy to make, quite tasty and although mine didn't look very much like the picture it was still good. I didn't know how to tell when the pie was 'done,' and figured when the goo started pouring over the edge I should take it out. It left the bottom part a little gooey, but I really like that. ALSO I made a graham cracker crust and it came out ten times better then the butter crust.

I've made this about five or six times and each time it gets rave reviews from family and friends alike. It was a huge hit with my Vietnamese neighbors on the 4th of July at our yearly block party. Definately one of my favorite desserts too!

I grew up near Amish Country, so I've seen and heard about Shoofly Pie for ages... never tried it until now, though. SO good. Very simple/wholesome taste. I made my own flaky crust to go along with it, since I prefer that to a store-bought variety. Taste best when eaten warm (ice cream on the side, if you want a real knock-your-socks off combination).

We have enjoyed shoo fly pie many times at a friend’s house, and my son requested it as his “cake” for his 8th birthday yesterday. Lacking my friend’s recipe and any experience baking a SFP, I chose 2 well-regarded recipes and made Shoo Fly Pie V alongside My Grandma’s Shoo-Fly Pie and had a taste test with 8 raters ranging in age from 4 to 60.  Grandma’s was the clear favorite, but could have been gooier.  Let’s just say no one has asked for a slice of either leftover pie yet today.
Pie V baked up like a cake (amazingly with no eggs) and the cinnamon tasted wrong in a SFP.  Pie V was also a deep brown while Grandma’s had the sandy top I was expecting.  I wish the recipe had more of a description of the pie at the point it should be removed from the oven.  At the 30 minutes specified in the recipe, Pie V was completely liquid, so I left it in until it just jiggled a bit. Perhaps that was too long and the cause of the major texture problem and unappealingly dark color in the finished pie.  Grandma’s was removed at exactly the time called for in the recipe, but again, firmed up too much as well.  I’m giving Pie V 2 stars in case the error was mine; but really I’m just going to throw it out  -- not worth eating.

This is a fantastic recipe for shoofly pie. I grew up in South jersey, and we would visit Lancaster County, PA every year.  While there, my main target had always been a shoofly pie.  This recipe is a breeze to make, and comes as close as I can remember.  If you like a dry bottom pie (as opposed to a wet bottom), just cut back on the liquids.  You can't go wrong on this recipe.  I made it for the first time for Thanksgiving, and it turned out GREAT!

This was a big hit, even with my mother who claims to dislike shoofly pie.

I had never made nor eaten a Shoofly PIe, but I am a molasses fiend so wanted to try this.  I really researched all the recipes for Shoofly Pie trying to find an authentic recipe.  It was delicious!  This pie is really molasses-y, gooey and rich.  My pie did not set up well like the photo; it was runny even after cooking for longer than the recipe stated.  However, my son and I inhaled this pie within a few days by ourselves!!

This is an authentic PA Dutch recipe.  My only problem was that it took much longer than 30 minutes to bake.  Mine wasn't fully baked until more than 40 minutes.

This was easy and delicious.  Although I could not get it to "foam" it turned out great.

I altered the recipe a little (combined it with another high rated recipe here).  It turned out beautiful!  Definately a keeper!  Thanks for the inspiration!

I made this recipe and the My Grandma's Shoo-Fly Pie from this site on the same day to compare.  The Grandma's pie was more traditional, but I liked this recipe better.  However, since there are so many wonderful desserts out there that I love, I most likely won't be making this again.

Just like my Mom’s! I used all molasses instead of part corn syrup. Delicious !
