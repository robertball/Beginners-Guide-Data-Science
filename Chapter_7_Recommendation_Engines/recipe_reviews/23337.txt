I took the repeated suggestions of other reviewers and added 2 T. of vegetable oil and 1 tsp. vanilla. For more intense "chocolatiness" I also added 1 tsp. of chocolate extract. I don't know if these additions and changes were necessary, but I do know this was one fantastic cookie! Everything was just perfect--it's an attractive cookie, perfectly shaped (I used a small ice cream scoop), kind of almost pebbly on the top. The texture was also perfect-- a little crackly, chewey on the outside, and melt-in-your mouth soft on the inside. Instead of chocolate chips I used chopped Andes mints, and the taste combination was out of this world, with no hint of cake mix taste. The flavor variations with this recipe are, of course, endless, but I enjoyed this combination so much I don't know that I'll bother trying it any other way. I do know, however, that I won't be making this with a yellow cake mix as the cake mix taste is hard to cover up. I also know this is only the first of many times I will come back to this easy and delicious recipe.

Oh man, this is the BEST basic cake-mix cookie recipe.  I love strawberry cake, so that was the mix I used and added 1 cup white chips and 1 cup pecans and it made the most yummy cookies.  I used a 2 tsp. scoop and made 44 2-inch cookies.  I've noticed with this and other cake mix cookie recipies that the cookies do not spread while baking, so unless you want puffy round drops, you need to flatten the cookies out a bit before you put them in the oven.

WOW WOW WOW!  I've been a baker all my life and wanted to find an easy cookie recipe to make with my 4 yr. daughter and this one takes the cake.  I've tried 3 other cake mix cookies from this site, and this is by far #1.  You can use any kind of cake mix, I like Butter Yellow because is gives a nice buttery taste and I took another reviewer's advice and added 2 tablespoon oil.  This keeps the cookie SUPER moist.  Definitely an 8 min. cookie if you want moist & chewy and stays this way for days--if it last that long in your house.  Great to make with kids, many variations possible and good for giving or when you're in a pinch.  Look no further for the 'short-cut' cookie recipe!!  I love these! (and so does my waistline)- Aahh!

My grandma taught me how to make theses when I was little. You can use any flavor cake mix along with 2 eggs and 1/2 cup oil instead of butter. You practically can't mess these up! I love to use butter pecan cake mixes or red velvet with cream cheese frosting! My husband likes a spice cake mix with a packet instant oatmeal, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup riasins. They seem to stay soft even without being sealed extra tight. My best advice, don't overbake them and you'll never go wrong. A great thing to experiment with, get the kid's involved!

If you don't want the cookies to be "cakey" then only add one egg or add just the yolk of the second egg.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I also gave it five stars.  I made two batches the first batch I added 1T. of oil and a 1t. vanilla.  They turned out, but they were a little airy and not really smooth.  The second batch I did as lesleysalyer recommended - I added 2T. of oil and 1t. of vanilla.  They were delicious and beautiful!  Thanks Lesley for the recommendation!

Mmmm...talk about soft cookies! I followed what other reviewers were saying they did and used 2tsp. Vegetable oil and 1tsp. vanilla. They were super easy to make and came out perfect! The only cake mix we had on hand was the Pillsbury devil's food cake mix and they turned out great. I brought them to a family BBQ where they were given rave reviews! If you're short on time then these are the cookies for you.  I gave it 4 stars for the quickness it takes to make them and great taste! I would definitely make these again if I was running short on time and needed cookies fast. Thanks a lot for the recipe Kristi!!

Not Good!  I used a duncan hines dark chocolate fudge cake, 1 tablespoon of canola oil, instead of 1 cup semi-sweet chips only used 1/2 cup. Replaced 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chips with peanut butter chips. 1st tray 3" cookies baked 10 minutes...very flat and bottom over done, 2nd tray 2" cookie-pressed top down slightly - baked 8 minutes--very flat and overdone on the bottom. 3rd tray--2" cookie, baked 8 minutes - centers raw (all three trays were baked on a SILPAT and dark cookie sheet, as well as oven thermometer reading 350 degrees. 4th sheet - 2" cookie, baked 8 minutes using parchment paper...not much difference than the other 3 attempts. Not a good chocolate flavor or even a good looking cookie  Good thing the cake mix only cost .88 cents!

i give this five stars because they were incredibly easy to make and really good. i had my doubts when i was mixing them, they seemed really dry, but i added 2 tsp. of oil and 1 tsp. of vanilla and they were really yummy. i used some kind of triple fudge cake mix with chocolate chips already in it - delicious but a bit too rich. would try a plain chocolate or devil's food cake next time. maybe some heath bites...thanks kristi for a super easy recipe!

HELPFUL TIP FOR THICK AND CHEWY: I was worried about mine turning out flat like many users said but I think the problem is they are overmixing.  Use room temp butter, and as the directions say "STIR" with spoon not mixer.  After you've "smushed" in the butter into the batter, and the must add 2T oil, and 1t vanilla, THEN add the eggs and chocolate chips.  I also then stick this in the fridge for 30 min or even overnight when I'm preparing ahead ...or in the freezer for 15 min.  I bake for 10 min (my oven is quick).  Basically if you let this cool on the cookie sheet for 15 min. and the middle is still too gooey, just stick it in the oven again, and add 4 min.  I do this with any cookie recipe, and always works.  I posted 2 pics.  One after not putting in fridge BUT NOT OVERMIXING, and then ones left in fridge plus NOT OVERMIXING.  Clearly a difference in thickness.  My husband likes flat and chewy, and I like thick and chewy, so both work! You can use yellow cake mix w/1/2C oats and 1/2C chocolate chips.  Yum! A wonderful fast recipe with many ways to experiment!

This cookie is delicious! I found that they made 40 cookies rather than 24 cookies for me, which also lowered the calories to about 100 calories each which was a nice bonus. These cookies *are* light and kind of airy which I really like about them. They are also chewy and delicious! A lot like a chocolate brownie. Great recipe and sooo easy!

I hereby dub thee Lazy Cake & Bake cookies, and therefore I LOVE them! Add the 2T veg. oil and 1t vanilla extract, it does ensure moist cookies. I did a choc. fudge cake mix with 1t of mint extract and walnuts - AWESOME. Also did a butter yellow cake mix with Ghirardelli choc. chips mixed in - equally AWESOME! So many variations for time-challenged and kitchen-intimidated persons like myself - I can't wait to try more!

These came out really well.  After following the recipe, I added 2T of oil and 1t of vanilla.  They have a different texture than regular cookie dough cookies, but it wasn't like cake either.  Kind of in between. Good in a pinch if you are craving cookies and don't want to start from scratch.

Great moist cookie if you like soft & chewy.  I used Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe, Devil's Food Cake Mix and replaced chocolate chips with peanut butter chips.  I added no oil-just the 1 stick butter and 2 eggs - like the recipe says.  I spooned the batter out on the cookie sheets and baked at 350F for 10 minutes.  The dough spread out easily but didn't totally flatten, nor burn on the bottom.  These came out perfectly for me.  I just made cookies again this time using Pillsbury Moist Surpreme (with the pudding in the mix), Golden Butter Recipe.  I used 1 stick of butter and 2 eggs, but I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla, 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts and 1 cup choc chips.   I did not add any extra oil.  I dropped by tablespoon and baked for 12 minutes at 350F.  Again I got a nice, spread cookie ~2 inches in diameter with a golden-brown bottom.  I don't think the extra oil is needed for the pudding-type or extra moist cake mixes.

The possibilities are ENDLESS with this recipe.  I've made these cookies five times in the last two weeks and, so far, my favorite is butter pecan cake mix with white chocolate chips and walnuts.  The kids like them with chocolate cake mix and either semisweet or white chocolate chips.  I plan to keep making these with different combinations.  In every batch I've added two tablespoons of vegetable oil and one teaspoon of vanilla.  Also, my cookies take between nine and ten minutes to bake.  Great recipe; definitely a family favorite!

I just finished baking these cookies and I have to say-- THEY ARE FANTASTIC! I've made a few batches of really good cookies from recipes I've found here. But this one, by far, my family's fave. And I felt like I was cheating because it's such an easy recipe, but you couldn't tell by the flavor that it is boxed cake mix! Yummmm!

I added 2 tablespoon of oil and added 1/2 cup of walnuts too. Those were my only changes. Next time I'll try white choc  and raspberry chips.

These cookies are amazing!  My son picked lemon cake mix with white chocolate chips and we grated some lemon zest in the dough and he won a blue ribbon at the fair. Not to mention appreciation of my co-workers when I took some to work.

The cookies spread out and flattened a lot, and the flavor was just so-so.  Really need more cocoa or something to give them flavor.

This recipe is great. I did a chocolate cake mix and added Toffee Chips. Soooo good! Everyone at my job ate them, and they ask me every week to bring in some more.  I can't wait to try out a batch with lemon cookies -and red velvet with cream cheese frosting! Yuum!

This is SUCH a great recipe.  I do use 1/2 C oil instead of butter though.  I also have tried this with spice cake mix---yum, and with Funfetti cake mix and added coconut to that, YUM YUM!!!!

Awesome!  Used milk chocolate cake mix, added 2 tsp oil, as other reviewers suggested, used 1 cup M&Ms instead of chocolate chips.  Recipe made exactly 24 cookies, baked them for 8 minutes, looked underdone but came out perfect after sitting.  Kids gobbled them up, and I think they were even better the second day.  So easy, I will be making these again soon!

I decorate cakes and have found that Betty Crocker has by far the best tasting cake mix on the market.  It also makes the best tasting cake mix cookies. I use different flavored cake mixes and they all turn out great.

So many reviewers said to add 2 tablespoons of oil plus a teaspoon of vanilla extract, so that was what I did.  I like to bake most of my desserts from scratch so I felt a bit like I was cheating by using a boxed cake mix... but the cookies turned out SO GOOD -- soft and chewy!  I've tried many good from-scratch cookie recipes but they're never this soft and chewy.  I know many friends are going to ask for the recipe once they try these cookies and I'm going to have to sheepishly say it's actually a boxed cake mix!  Anyway, I was able to get 25 3-inch cookies and they spread to just the right thickness on their own -- I didn't have to flatten them a bit before baking like some reviewers had to.  I added walnuts along w/ milk chocolate chips and they were picture-perfect.  I baked at 350 F for 10 minutes and at first, they looked as if they might be a little under-baked or too gooey, but after they cooled completely, they were perfect.  Put them in an airtight container and they were still super soft and chewy the next morning (didn't harden up).

I loved this recipe.  I also added about 2 tbsp. of oil and used the toffee chips and chocolate chips I had in the house (approx. 1/2 a cup each)  and they were delicious.  The first pan to go in oven was scooped and left rounded ... they did not flatten much and took a good 14 min. to bake.  The 2nd pan I flattened with a fork (much like peanut butter cookies) and they still took  12 min to cook.  They may seem underdone when they come out but aren't!!! They stay good for about 3 days...but that is the limit so eat up!!!

These were not the best cookies, but did in a pinch and were mildly chocolaty. I imagine there are variances based on the cake mix used.

Not very good. Found the cookies to be very very very salty. This may be just me being sensitive to salty baked goods (I don't usually add as much salt to cookie recipes as it calls for) but I probably won't make these again unless I'm desperate for cookies. Will just go the from-scratch method next time. Good thing the mix only cost me $1 and it was quick and easy!

Family loved these cookies.  Used milk chocolate cake mix and semi sweet chips.  Can't wait to try chocolate fudge cake mix, semi sweet chips and pecans next time.  I think one of the tricks is to soften the butter, but not melt it.  I used a hand mixer, baked for 10 minutes (8 wasn't enough in my oven--made them too gooey in the middle) and let them cool completely before removing from the pan.  They didn't spread much, but because of the thickness, they were very soft in the middle.  Even with the mixer, these did not turn out "fluffy" (thank goodness since I don't like fluffy cookies)  They were fudgy and yummy.

A great, simple and tasty recipe! I didn't change a thing. The cookies are oh, so chocolaty and puffy enough but not cake-like at all. I look forward to changing out the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips! Yum!

These cookies are delicious and super easy to make-- I like to make these with my son. I followed the recipe but added 2 Tbsp. oil, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 box of instant pudding mix. They came out soft and chewy and yummy.

OMG these are YUMMY!! I used a chocolate cake mix and added a tsp of vanilla and 2 tbsp of oil. I also used 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk, rather than 2 whole eggs, because I didnt want the cakey consistency. Instead of chocolate chips, I used chopped white chocolate and dried raspberries. Baked for 10 min and they are PEFERECTION!!! A thin crisp outside and chewy soft inside - like a delicious brownie cookie - and so very easy. My 3 yr old practically made them herself!! I bake for others a lot and these not only taste wonderfully but they LOOK beautiful as well. Thank you this is a KEEPER!!

I thought these were going to be a flop. The batter was so thick I couldn't even mix in the choco chips. Several were left in the bottom of the bowl. Mine also didn't spread at all, I had to smush the second batch down. This might have been because I used a Reduced Sugar Devil's Food Mix. The finished product ended up being pretty tasty though, like a small brownie bite. I notice a lot of people adding oil & vanilla, I would probably do that if I did this again.

This is an amazing cookie! Super moist and gooey inside and slightly crispy & chewy on the outside. I used a 9oz box of devils food cake mix to yield 16 large cookies. (I can't make more than that.. I would eat them all in 1 night!) Here are the subs I made to get the calorie per cookie to 100: 9oz devils food cake mix, 1/3C Light I Can't Believe its Not Butter, 24g pureed prune (3-4 prunes, reconstituted in a little hot water, blended) 3Tbs semi sweet choc chips & 1 bar (34g) sugar free dark chocolate, coarsely chopped. Used 1 egg and added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. I baked them 10 minutes on parchment paper (they still looked underdone) but after resting them 2 minutes on the sheet & 2 minutes still on the paper on a wire rack, they were perfect! Perfectly spread, crackled tops and slightly gooey inside even after a day. They are so decadent and chocolately and wonderful with a glass of pinot noir at dessert time. My friends can't believe they're made with prunes and cake mix or that they're low cal and more heart healthy than your average cookie. I love this recipe... thanks for the inspiration :)

This is a good start to your basic cake mix cookie recipe, but I made the following changes:
1 egg, plus 1 egg yolk
1 tsp pure vanilla extract

I always beat the softened butter together with the dry cake mix until crumbly (any cake mix will work---even store-brand) and add the eggs until combined. I then add the vanilla and fold in chocolate chunks/chips etc. 

Using a 2 TBSP cookie scoop, I place them 2" apart on a parchment lined cookie sheet and bake for 12 min @ 350F.  These will spread, and result in a cookie that has a crispy outer shell and chewy inside. 

These are my go-to cookies for bake sales as they are quick, easy and inexpensive, especially when making 20 dozen.

I use a lemon cake mix.  They are FABULOUS!!  My daughter and her friends beg for them.  Even people who don't like lemon want the recipe.  Obviously leave out the choco chips. Serve plain, sprinkled with confectioners sugar, or drizzled with a glaze.  Any way they are GREAT!

Turned out perfect. Used "confetti" cake mix with vanilla chunks. I found using 1/2 cup oil instead of butter eliminated the need for the 2T oil. Used cookie scoop and flattened slightly with glass dipped in flour.

Wow! Easy and delicious! The cookies had a tremendous chocolate taste! The cookie stayed moist, and not that dry, crumbly texture! However, the cookies were moist and flat (it spread). Please use MINI CHOCO CHIPS! Its even better!   I will bake these again but maybe add oats or flour so its a thick chocolate cookie.

Holy cow!!!  So easy and so good!  I followed the directions from the other users by adding 2 tblsp. oil and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I used chocolate cake mix and white chips in one batch; and the other batch with chocolate cake mix and Andes Creme de Menthe chips!  My eyes rolled back in my head.  :o)

I tend to overbuy cake mixes when they go on sale for under a dollar at the grocery store and this is the perfect way to use them up!  I used Duncan Hines Chocolate Fudge cake mix with Reeses peanut butter chips.  The kids LOVED them.  I thought they were pretty good.  I'd make this again, esp if I was in a big hurry or really needed to use up those cake mixes.  Also came back to add that this recipe made over 40 cookies for me as well and they were pretty good sized.

This is an very easy quick I need a cookie now fix. The girls loves them and the neighbors kids, but some said they has a salty taste. I think next time I'll try adding some Brown sugar.

A quick and convenient cookie recipe when you want cookies fast! I used only 1 egg and added 1 tsp of vanilla. Instead of adding the suggested oil (more fat and calories), I melted the margarine in the microwave for 1 minute at 50% power. It mixed up great. Then drop by teaspoon fulls onto the baking sheet and flattened slightly with the bottom of a glass coated in sugar. I used a yellow mix with chocolate chips. They were ok. Chocolate Fudge with peanut butter chips were outstanding. Lemon with no chips were like lemon sugar cookies. Next is spice mix with added oats and white chocolate chips, then strawberry with white chocolate chips.

I am so glad I tried this recipe!!! I have tried several different chocolate cookie recipes and was dissapointed every time. They always turned out hard or the flavor was terrible. And not being a big fan of cake mix cookies, I never thought to try chocolate cake mix instead of regular chocolate cookie batter. I bought several boxes of Betty Crocker cake mix on sale, so that's what I used. Then after reading some other reviews, I made sure to add 2 Tbsp vegetable oil and 1 tsp vanilla. I also substituted the baking Andes mints for reg chocolate chips. I used my small pampered chef cookie scooper to make the balls. 9 minutes was the magic time for these cookie in the oven. My first couple pans experienced quite a bit of speading because the batter had become warm, but after putting it in the fridge for a little bit they came out wonderful. Very easy to make, got lots of compliments. You couldn't even taste the cakey flavor. They remained soft and chewy for days (I made mine 3 days ago). A friend said using butter yellow cake mix with butterscotch chips and adding a little cinnamon makes a good combo as well. I am so happy I've finally found a good chocolate cookie recipe!!

Super easy and very good.  I made two different batches:  One with lemon cake mix, then rolled in powdered sugar.  Then one with a Cinnamon Swirl cake mix and then rolled in cinnamon sugar, which ended up tasting very similar to a snickerdoodle - DELICIOUS!  

Thanks for a great base recipe!

I LOVE this recipe!  It is quick, easy, and delicious.  I always add the 2 tsp. of oil and 1 tsp. of vanilla as recommended in other reviews.  I've been trying all different combinations and haven't had a bad cookie yet.  My favorite: If you like german chocolate cake, you have to try this - I mixed a german chocolate cake mix, 1/4 cup brown sugar, chopped pecans, coconut, and the other usual ingredients.  I rolled the dough into balls, then rolled them in coconut, and baked.  It is a cookie that tastes just like the cake!

I have been looking for a good cake-mix recipe forever! Big huge tip, don't mix two boxed at the same time unless you have a heavy duty mixer. I did two by hand and my arm fell off. I also recommend to not use the pudding in the mix ones, they turn out kind of doughy.

Yum!!  Rich, soft and chewy, like little brownie bites.  I used devil's food cake mix and mini milk chocolate chips.  Mine needed to bake for 12 minutes.  This would be amazing with chopped Andes mints instead of chocolate chips.  I love how versatile this is.

My 9 yr old and I made this recipe with a strawberry cake mix and white chocolate chips for a class cookie exchange for Valentines.  We didn't alter in any way.  The cookies are great and all of the kids loved them.

These have become our family's favorite cookie!  These are the softest cookies, even days later (if they're around that long!)  I ommitted the chocolate chips, and added 2 tbsp. vegetable oil and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I also shaped them into balls, rolled them in powdered sugar, and flattened them with a fork.  My eight year old son and four year old daughter helped, and we had a blast with very delicious results!  Thank you so much for the recipe, Kristi!

Oh, my goodness!  This just became my favorite cookie, and I have been making all sorts of cookies for years!  So easy to make, but so moist and chocolatey...  I omitted the 1 cup of chocolate chips because I used a triple chocolate fudge cake mix with chocolate chips already in it.  Instead of butter, I used margarine because that was what I had on hand.  I followed other reviewers' recommendations and added 2 tablespoons of canola oil and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  The dough was still so thick that my hand mixer could not handle it.  I ended up using a wooden spoon to finish the mixing.  I scooped the dough by leveled tablespoonfuls, and the batch yieled about 40 cookies.  My baking time was about 11 minutes.  I will definitely make these cookies again in a few days for Christmas!

I gave this recipe 5 stars. I wasn't too sure at first because the batter was so thick but I used the triple chocolate cake mix with chocolate chips already in the cake mix and added 2tsp of oil and 1tsp of almond extract and they turned out good. The next day they were even better. They were soft and chewey. Kids loved them!

These are perfect as is. I was making a bunch of treats for an activity with teenagers, so I made three batches. I tried adding the oil as suggested to one batch, and they came out more flat and chewy. Good, but when I made it with only the butter, they came out so much better.

These are hands down the best cookies. Super easy, and people LOVE them. 8 minutes is perfect. I added a couple tablespoons of leftover coffee to give it a little bit of a kick. If you love moist cookies, these are for you!

I ran out of sugar and wasn't able to make the cookies I wanted to, so I made these to take to my MIL house for Sunday dinner. I am so glad that I ran out of sugar. These were so good! I followed others suggestion and added 1tsp of vanilla and 2 Tbsp of oil. Everyone loved them and commented on how moist they were.

I needed cookies for a church BBQ and so I doubled the recipe and used 1 box of strawberry and 1 box of white cake mix. I used white chocolate chips and some mini dark chocolate chips. I just had one warm out of the oven and it was great! I didn't add any oil or vanilla like some of the reviews recommended but I think they turned out amazing! Only thing is that I'll make them smaller next time, they spread out on my baking sheets a lot. Thank you for this, I'll probably make them more often than I should!

I made these with my daughter and they were very easy to make, however, I should have followed the rating advice and added the vegetable oil. They were very dry and britlle, my husband said "they taste like sand in your mouth"! Guess they would be good with vegetable oil? I will try that next time.

Best double chocolate cookie ever!  I couldn't make more fast enough.  I too followed others' suggestions of adding the veg. oil, except I used Canola oil and vanilla.  Great and easy recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you!

I have tried many cake mix cookie recipes.  This is my favorite.   I find that using the butter makes a chewier cookie.

Just stocked up on cake mix that was on sale. used Butter Recipe Chocolate, mixed 1 t. vanilla, 2 T oil, 2 eggs, 1/2 c butter per other suggestions (total, not in addition to original recipe). Mixed in 1 cup butterscotch chips and 1 cup marshmallows. Baked exactly 10 mins. yes the marshmallows mostly melted but hubby and son said they were awesome! Lots of great variations - thanks!

OK, I have to admit, the first time I made these, they turned out horrible! The package of cake mix that I used was only 16 oz., so the proportions were off, and then I left them in the oven for too long, so they got really hard. I was ready to throw away this recipe, but I decided to give it another try. I used a different cake mix (Dr. Oetker's organic chocolate cake mix), and I substituted coconut oil for some of the butter. (Coconut oil is VERY good for you, and it's also great for baking!) I threw in a mixture of bittersweet chocolate chips and white chocolate chips, as well as 1-2 tsp. of peppermint extract. I baked them for exactly 8 minutes, and they came out perfect. They taste just like thin mints! Oh, and I got a whopping 50 cookies out of this batch!

These are INCREDIBLE! I added 3T of vegetable oil to the mix since it was rather thick. It shouldn't be possible to make something that tastes that good in five minutes of prep time, but it is!

WOW!! I used Pillsbury Moist supreme chocolate devils food. I used the stick of butter 2 TBS. oil and a tsp Vanilla. I formed into a ball about 2 inch, then flattened them out a bit. Added some pecans on top and pressed them in. They remind me of brownies! The taste is AWESOME and the texture perfect! I cooked them at 350 for 8 min, then let them flatten out for a few minutes before putting them on a cooling rack. These are now my FAVORITE cookies. Thank YOU!

This is so conveniently easy. I love baking recipes that don't require me to take out my mixer (under my blender, under my crock pot!). I followed this to T. I don't feel it requires oil like others suggested. I added chocolate chips to half the recipe and the other half I added butterscotch chips. It made 44 cookies that puffed up, not spread. yum!

Nice and easy cookies.Great activity with the kids. I used mine as cookie sandwiches and followed the information of a previous review and used oil instead of butter. One thing I would say is to sift the cake mix as it is hard to get the lumps out. But other than that...will definatly make this again!!

I somehow got a cake mix and found this recipe trying to figure how to use it.  This is a great recipe for quick easy cookies.  Does not have the same greatness as made-from-scratch, but is valuable when in a hurry.  I used cherry cake mix with chocolate chips - flavors blended well.

I used a chocolate cake mix, followed the recipe adding: 1 t. vanilla,brown sugar, but instead of the oil that some are adding I added a scant 1/4 cup sour cream.  Refrigerated dough and baked as directed.

I have also tried Cake Mix Cookies I and III, they were both good, but so far these are my favorite.  The dough is easier to work with not too stiff or crumbly.  The cookies turned out nice and moist and they spread some without being too loose.

These are so easy, I also added the 2T of oil and the vanilla and some cinnamon and I melted the butter, I didn't put that many chips in, I didn't measure I just threw some in to give it a little something extra.  The only chocolate cake mix I had was double pudding so I used that.  I made big cookies so I barely got the two dozen I used a big cookie scoop so I left them round and I baked them for 10 min., and my niece said they tasted just like brownies, which we liked so this recipe was two thumps up and extremely easy.   I great recipe for kids and easy clean up since I didn’t even have to use the mixer I just stirred it up in one big bowl, scooped and baked.  My niece calls them the chocolate brownie cookies.  They were so dense and moist.  I may try adding a little baking powder next time to see if they’ll rise up a little more.   I always use a silpat on my cookie sheet so I never worry about my cookies sticking.  I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is so easy and there was a lot of taste for very, very little effort.

This aren't terrible at all, but they're not really what you get an idea of at the word "cookie."  They're quite light and airy.  However, I do think this would be the perfect recipe to follow when making those cupcakes cooked in an ice cream cone. :)

I gave it 5 stars because it's very quick to make and tastes nice and chocolately. I took the leftovers to work two days after I made them and they were on the "firm" side, but I just spritzed some water on them and they were moist and chewy again - magic! I got quite a few compliments on these. Try it!

I made this with Betty Crocker chocolate cake mix, 1/4 cup white chocolate chips, 1/2 cup chopped up Palmers peppermint bark and 1/2 cup semi sweet chips. Like many other reviewers, I added 2 tbsp. oil and 1 tsp vanilla. I also used 5 drops peppermint extract. I used a small cookie scoop and baked them 9 minutes on parchment on a true cookie sheet (rimless). I let them cool 2 minutes on the sheet and then on a rack. I really liked how they turned out especially the white chocolate against the dark brown. Soft and flat and chewy! Yum!

So easy and so good! I used a devil's food cake mix with peanut butter chips, they turned out perfect! I used a half cup of oil plus 2 T. and a t. Vanilla as others suggested. I've also made them with a strawberry cake mix with white chips. The possibilities are endless!

Sooooooooo, I needed something quick and tasty for my son's potluck tomorrow for teacher appreciation week (the teachers get to have their own lunch getaway while the students do a potluck). Anyway, I figured I had cake mix and all the other few ingredients needed to give this a try and I did! BOY AM I GLAD I DID!!! Simple, no fail, tried and true recipe here! I followed the directions to a "T", but I added white chocolate chips to my fugde mix and they are moist and delicious! Why haven't I done this before?? Give it a go, you won't be sorry! (My next batch is about to be done in 5, 4, 3, 2, (ding)

THESE ARE AMAZING!!! These are hands down, the BEST cookies I have made in my entire life!! And not only the BEST, but the EASIEST! I'm still in disbelief of how simple these were to make, and how good they are!! My husband agreed!
I even made sure they were extra high up off the counters this time so that our fur-kid didn't stand a chance.  I followed the recipe to a T, and I might have been a little generous with the chocolate chips, but I'd do it all over again if I could. 

I used Betty Crockers Triple Chocolate Fudge Cake mix with semi-sweet choc chips, and my husband said they taste like cocoa pebble cookies :)

I'm very excited to make this recipe over and over, and use different cake mixes and different chips. I just need to think of what I'm going to tell people (including my husband) when they ask how I make them. No way in hell I'm telling them they were this easy to make!!

Basically, I made 4 batches.  The first was with a brownie mix due to my error - don't use they will be flat.  I read the reviews and took their word at adding the 2T of oil and 1t of vanilla. I will also add to make sure to use butter and not margarine. After my brownie fiasco,(they were delicious just not presentable) I made the cookies using Betty Crocker Yellow Super Moist cake mix.  I mixed everything (by hand)except the oil and chips. I added Heath toffee bits.  The cookies turned out nice and made about 40 cookies. I actually rolled them in a ball and they turned out fine. The next batch I used a store brand white mix. I mixed the oil in with everything else, just to see if it made a difference. It didn't seem to.  I used butterscotch chips with those, but for some reason it took longer to bake these cookies. Those also made 40.The last batch I used Better Crocker super moist white with no egg yokes and margarine (country crock light).  It turned out more creamy and less dough like. I let it sit a bit to stiffen up. It helped. They came out just fine and made 36. Great, fast recipe.

Wonderful recipe!! Made these with a devil's food cake mix and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Added the t of vanilla, t of choc extract and T of oil and these were the best chocolate cookies I have ever eaten. They are not super sweet which is the way we like them. The flavor is a lot like brownies. 

This is a keeper! Thanks very much Kristi!

These were just eh. I followed the advice and added 2T of oil and some vanilla and they still turned out pretty dry. Not what I was looking for. I had my heart set on chewy cookies, but live and learn! Not like I threw them away or anything.
Update: didn't realize I had made these before when I threw them together a few minutes ago. I used another reviewer suggestion and only used 1/2 cup of oil and two eggs, added mini chocolate chips and chopped pecans and they turned out great! 8 minutes and cool, light and airy yet still a dense cookie. Looking forward to trying other flavors!

These are good. I did follow other reviews and added 2 tbsp of vegetable oil. They do spread out quite a bit I would use a dark pan vs light pan). I stored them in a Tupperware container, and they still tasted light and fluffy after a week.

Super easy.  I thought that these would be rich enough so didn't add the chocolate chips, but did add 2-3 tsp of peppermint flavoring.  They taste really close to girl scout thin mints, yummm!

I used 2 eggs and 1/2 cup shortening or oil.  The cookies rise more and are moist.  Also, I take them out when they are not quite done and let them finish baking on the tray while it cools.  SOOOO GOOD!!!

Dealing with reality, cake mix cookies are not going to taste homemade, but like cake mix. So, my 4 star rating is based on the recipe, not the taste. I felt the mixture was a bit dry and added a little vanilla for some extra liquid (and flavor). Outside of that, it is what it is--a very quick recipe for cookies that are chewy and taste like a cake mix. That's what I wanted the evening I made them.

ok these arent' the best cookies in the world but they're FAST!!  seriously it took me about two minutes to prepare them!  I used oil instead of butter and used reeses pieces instead of chocolate chips.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla as per others' suggestions.  I used my smallest ice cream-style scoop - they baked up perfectly -  the kids loved them.

Five stars based on the rave reviews I received. I made these for Christmas, so I used dark chocolate fudge cake mix and mixed in a whole package of Nestle mint & dark chocolate chips. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 2T of oil and 1t of vanilla; however, mine spread quite a bit in the oven and ended up pretty thin. Perhaps my butter was too soft? In any case, they looked pretty and smelled delicious and everyone told me they tasted great. I would definitely try this with gluten-free cake mix so I can eat it next time!

Very easy and pretty good. I felt like I was cheating! Mine spread with no problem, I made mine small so I could put 3 at time in a muffin cup, after they were done, to put in cookie tins.

This is the only review I have ever written because they are so bad.  These cookies did NOT work for me!  I added the 2T oil others suggested and baked them the full 10 minutes.  They are so SOFT that they crumble and stick together.  They are basically crumbs.  Will not use again.

I just made a batch of these cookies for a friend of mine who's leaving for his BMT next week and wanted to, I guess, "pig out" one last time before leaving. For such a simple recipe, these cookies are superb! The dough is great for shaping by hand (with damp/wet hands, of course!) and they taste great. Although they came out a little cakey, I was kind of expecting it; after all it IS a cake mix. Great recipe!!

These cookies are awesome!  I added 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and white chips as other reviewers mentioned.  I also added 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder to bump up the chocolate taste.  Took them to a cookout and got rave reviews.

I have made these cookies often, and I change it every time.  I sometimes add a teaspoon of espresso powder and use white chips instead of semisweet.  These are really yummy.  I have also tried red velvet cake mix with white chocolate chips.  Very Yummy.

made mine as a traditional chocolate chip cookie with a white cake mix and semi sweet chocolate chips.  I have to say they were definitely fast and easy though mine still tasted a bit like cake mix which disappointed me some. Used the store brand boxed mix so that could be the issue.   Would love to try these with chocolate cake mix next time and white chocolate chips.  Made mine with smart balance and egg beaters so they were slightly less fat grams.

4 stars for the few ingredients and quick prep time. They tasted good for a quick substitute. I did as others suggested and added an additional 2 tbsp oil and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I used BC triple Choc cake mix, 1/2 C Choc chips and 1/3 C + 4 tbsp chopped maraschino cherries. Next time i'll do devils food. The triple Choc was way too much. And this coming from a pregnant person craving Choc. I baked on parchment paper. I varied the batter size scoops. Using ~1+1/2 tbsp of batter and placing in mounds size of 50 cent pieces they took 11-12 mins @ 350. 2 tsp size scoops plopped in mounds took 9 mins@  350'F. They do flatten and spread out. I let them cool completely, for 5 mins, and removed immediately off parchment w/ no issues. BUT do not stack them. They will stick together b/c they are a mix between cookie and cake like. So separate w/ foil or parchment when stacking. The size of your cookie (or any food for that matter) will alter baking/cooking time. Smaller= shorter and bigger vol=longer. Also, if using convection in the oven, the fan circulates the hot air, so the temp needs to be dropped around 325'F possibly. I worked in a bakery for 8 yrs and they use convection. Since the cookies were super chocolatey I made some into ice cream sandwiches w/ vanilla ice cream and some I used a light cherry flavored frosting. Since it's so hot the ice cream one's were much more appealing. Thanks for sharing a good/quick recipe.

I made these exactly to the recipe, but decreased size and got about 48 cookies.  They were absolutely incredible and I love a one-bowl recipe!
They were a huge hit with my family - perfectly chewy.

Another fan of this recipe here! Used a BC Super Moist choc fudge mix and 1c Ghirradelli chips. I also added 2T oil and 1tsp of vanilla extract. Baked for the 8min, and a little larger size (24 cookies from this recipe), they came out just the way we love our cookies- just slightly undercooked in the center, chewy when cool. They were cakey and light, part of that maybe due to the 2 extra-large eggs I used (oops) instead of 1 plus just the yolk of the 2nd. Oh well, they are yummy just the same! can't wait to try again with a different cake mix and my 6yr old :)

these are so good!  I used cherry chip cake mix with white chocolate chips (everyone loved these, they couldn't figure out how I made them!) and devil's food cake mix with semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips.  They were a hit!  And they are most definitely EASY!  Will make again.  Thank you!

They were tasty but a bit too cakey for me. I forgot to add the oil as suggested. I wonder if that would have made a difference.

Great recipe!  If using a version of Chocolate cake mix, try rolling your cookies in powdered sugar before you bake them...you won't be disappointed!

I make cake mix cookies all the time.  To avoid the cake mix taste, add a few drops of mint extract to chocolate cake mix, or a few drops of lemon extract to yellow cake mix.  For most cake mixes, 1/3 cup of oil is enough, or use orange juice (1/2 and 1/2) with oil.  I always have people ask me for my recipe when I serve cake mix cookies!

excellent! I normally make cookies from scratch,but wanted something quick one night to satisfy a craving. The only changes I made was to add some vanilla and coconut extracts, a couple of tablespoons of oil, and walnuts. This is a great recipe that can easily be customized to your preferences.

First time making these.  I didn't read any reviews first, so had to double check the recipe after making the cookies and reading the reviews!!  I had it in my head that the recipe called for oil instead of butter.  I did decrease the oil to between 1/3 and 1/2 c.  I also added Andes mint chips instead of chocolate chips.  Oh, also....I rolled the dough into balls and flattened them slightly with the bottom of a cup dipped in flour.  They were AMAZING!!!  So, if you're in a pinch and don't have butter, oil works great!!  :D

What an easy cookie mix!!  I love how you can tweak this with different cake mix varieties and add-ins.  I made batch using devil's food cake mix, 1/2 cup of apple sauce, 2 eggs, and a LOT of chocolate chips.  I made a second batch using a spice cake mix, 1/2 cup apple sauce, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup raisins, and 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips.  Both turned out GREAT!!  They don't spread out much, so if you don't want thick cookies, you should let the batter warm up a bit or press them down when you put the dough on the cookie sheet.  I got great reviews from my family & friends for both cookies.  I also think these cookies (the chocolate version) would make great "whoopie pie" cookies!

Modifications: Added 2 Tbs vegetable oil. Variations: Strawberry cake mix with white chocolate chips. Devil's food cake mix with chocolate-coated raspberry baking bits.  Strawberry one turned out excellent. Spread nicely, was crisp on inside and chewy inside. Chocolate one didn't spread very much (probably due to the larger sized baking bits), so I pressed the down a bit in later batches. Cooked just fine. I had both types in the over for 8.5 minutes per batch of 9 cookies.  Will definitely make again, because I usually have these ingredients onhand, and it's super easy to mix up and bake.

definitely use an ungreased cookie sheet - not a silpat or anything like that or the cookie won't cook.  i used a silpat with my 1st batch & they were not good b/c they never cooked, even after much longer in the oven.  used an ungreased sheet w/my 2nd batch, and they were perfect!  delicious!  i used devil's food cake mix w semi sweet chips & craisins.  YUM.  i'm now baking spice cake w raisins and am sure they'll be great too!  need to bake mine 10 mins.

Fabulous. I did a batch with Pillsbury Devil Food Cake mix and peanut butter chips. One of the best cookies I've had! The next week tried with a Betty Crocker Devil food cake mix, cookies came out flat and not as good. Go with the Pillsbury.  I added 2TBSP oil and 1 tsp vanilla as others suggested. Really just a perfect little cookie.

I made them just as the recipe stated except, I wasn't paying attention and poured the WHOLE bag of mini chocolate chips in (oops).  Turned out great.  Very gooey and chocolately (used a Duncan Hines Devils Food mix).  Needed something quick and easy and this was perfect.  Dough was very hard to mix at first, ended up using my hands, so next time I will use my mixer.

OMG these were SO good! These will be my go-to cookies for the kids lunches.  Very quick and delicious.  I didn't have butter, so I used butter flavored Crisco.  I also had to add a little bit of water to get it to mix.  Way to thick, but my eggs were small.

These cookies were absolutely fantastic.  They tasted like cookies from a cookie shop.  They were seriously amazing and oh so soft and chewy!  Definitely add the extra oil with these cookies.  It helps them stay soft.  These cookies only lasted 2 days because they were soooo good!  Please don't hesitate to try these because you will not regret it!

These spread a bit too much for my liking, even after I chilled the cookie sheets before dropping the dough onto them.  However, the flavor and texture are good, and they're a nice, quick recipe for big groups or last-minute occasions!  I tried Red Velvet mix with cream cheese frosting (yum), and Swiss Chocolate mix w/ chocolate chips (yum!).

This cookie recipe is great if you are in a pinch! Or even if you just want some quick cookies and happen to have a box cake on hand! I did as others did and added a little bit of oil to mine to help bind it together. I took mine a step up a notch and filled the cookies with the flourless peanut butter cookie recipe from this site, and then rolled the balls of dough into sugar. In the words of Paula Deen--YUMMMM....! Thank you Kristi for submitting this quick recipe!!

Yum!  I like to use this as a cheat recipe for chocolate crinkles.  I use 1/4c margarine and 1/4c veg oil instead of butter, roll them in powdered sugar and bake.  A quick and easy chocolate fix.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

Count me in as another devoted fan of these cookies!  I have made both chocolate w/M&Ms and yellow cake mix w/M&Ms and LOVED them both.  I did add vanilla and a small amount of oil per others suggestions, and also used melted butter, since that helps make cookies chewy.  I bake 1 sheet of these and then scoop the remaining dough on another cookie sheet and freeze.  Once frozen, I bag up the cookies and then I can bake just a few at a time whenever I'm in the mood :  )

I added 1/4c brown sugar as the original directions suggested, and 2T oil & 1t vanilla, as the other reviewers suggested, and it turned out great!  I baked the first couple batches for 7-1/2 minutes, then 6-1/2 minutes for each additional batch--any longer, and they would've burned.  I used a strawberry cake mix with 1/2 bag semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 bag white chocolate chips.  Just like someone else mentioned, I got exactly 40 good-sized cookies out of this recipe.  Great recipe; thanks for sharing!

These cookies were amazing and super easy to make.  I followed the advice from other reviewers and added a bit of vegetable oil and vanilla.  They came out perfect.  I took them to a pub quiz and they were gone within ten minutes.  Will definitely have to make again!

Yummy!  I made this recipe just as is but with a little less than a cup of chocolate chips and it was really good.  Will try the oil version to cut down on fat next time.

I'm another one of those people who read reviews, but rarely find myself writing 1. What a surprise! I've spent many moons looking for a store-bought gourmet cookie recipe and this is one that's semi-homemade. I feel a bit like a cheater, but hey, I don't think anyone will be able to tell. They are sooooo yummy and very easy and fast to make! Thank you!

This is the recipe you need for that last minute bake sale that you just found out about! This cookie is as close to the best in brownie as you can get! Firm enough to pick up but melt in your mouth moist and gooey tender. Chocolate perfection. I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe. I cooked them at 350 for 9 minutes because I have a hot oven. Just ccok them until they are set not brown. 1 minute to many will make a huge difference. Let them cool. There was no cake mix taste at all! This is a great secret emergency recipe for bake sales, class room parties,potlucks, guest coming over with short notice, new neighbors and hungry after school children. The hungry children can even be taught to make it themselves in minutes. With an 88 cent mix and 1/2 hour you have lots of fantiasic "homemade" cookies. I even wipped up a second batch while the first was cooking without difficulty.

These really exceeded my expectations!  I doubled the recipe (added vanilla) and tossed it in the KitchenAid stand mixer . I used two boxes of Pillsbury Moist Supreme Devils Food Cake & I added in a whole bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and half  bag of mini M&M's, which was the perfect amount for a double batch.  I slightly pressed the cookies with the bottom of a cup after placing on the cookie sheet and baked for 8-9 minutes. These were thick, soft, good looking cookies that tasted just like yummy brownies.  I will make these often & am looking forward to trying other flavors.  Thanks for sharing this  recipe!!!

I admit I was a bit skeptical before I made these cookies.  That all changed after I tried one of these little bits of heaven.  They are so chocolately (used B.C. chocolate fudge) and chewy with a brownie-like texture.  You can't even tell these were semi-homemade and every bit as good as homemade.  I can't wait to experiment with other flavors like butter cake mix with pecans.

I make these all the time for Christmas Cookie Exchanges. It's like a brownie-cookie. I like to underbake them just a little so they are a little gooey and soft. This is great for people like me who always keep a box of cake mix in the cupboard for a quick treat when money is tight. You can also substitute one stick 
margerine for the butter, to keep it on the cheap.

When I made them today, I added a half of an 8 oz. bag of chocolate covered 
espresso beans. Turned out great, as always.

Awesome! Used this recipe a couple times when the kids feel like something sweet and we don't have any desert handy. Have used all different kinds of cake mix and "add-in's". Takes only minutes and they are delicious!

Very easy and delicious with Betty Crocker Devil’s Food Mix. I found it tasted best with the following changes: chilled dough in freezer for 10min before use, greased the sheet before use, added 2 teaspoon of vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and 1cup of chopped walnuts. They were delicious I left them out on the cooling rack and they were practically gone within the hour.

My daughters had a sleepover last night and this was the recipe I chose for them to make themselves because there were only a few ingredients.  WOW! I didn't expect much, but these were absolutely awesome.  The cookies, once they cooled, were moist and chewy and delicious, reminiscent of the old "Grandma's Cookies" brand, but without the odd aftertaste.  They were sweet, but had just enough of a salty flavor from the cake mix to offset the sweetness.  Semi-sweet chocolate chips made the cookies rich and wonderful.  I've made countless homemade double chocolate chip cookie recipes, but this one is the tops, and we'll make it again and again.
Thanks for a great recipe!

My goodness, of all the chocolate chocolate chip cookies Ive made from this site, these are BY FAR THE BEST! The others were good, dont get me wrong! But these are sooo moist! I added 2T of oil, and 1tsp of vanilla and semisweet choc chips!MAKE SURE To refrigerate this cookie dough till firmer and able to make more cookie like rounds on parchement.  The first attempt they came out flat.  Definately cook about 8 mins only, they still will look slightly underdone, but they wont be.   Great cookie, thanks!

This concept makes the best cookies. I use yellow cake mix and TONS of chocolate chips.The secret to big thick cookies is to chill the dough for 30 mins before baking. I then bake them until just set and let them cool. The result is a thick, soft, moist amazing cookie.

Like many that came before me... I also added 2T oil and some vanilla.

The best thing about this recipe is it's versatility.

I made my cookies from a spice cake mix.  I added mini chocolate chips, walnuts and raisins.  I also punched it up with some pumpkin pie spice.

They are easy!

Some pointers that others have mentioned:  The dough is very stiff, a hand mixer will likely not be able to handle it.  My stand KA had no problem.

The chocolate versions are a bit sweet.  A lot depends on your mix choice.

It is a little cake-ier than many cookies... I have no problem with this, but if you do, change the recipe to one egg and one egg yolk.

Quick, Easy, AWESOME!!!  These are so simple you'll feel like you're doing something wrong but they always turn out perfectly.  I have used chocolate cake mix as directed in the recipe, but also spice, lemon, and strawbery.  They were all great.  I also like to buy a tub of premade frosting, melt some in the microwave, and drizzle it over the cookies after they cool.  I let the frosting cool and they are ready to go.  This recipe makes a lot so it's good for entertaining as well.

Used a white cake mix, topped cookies with a walnut half. They were very easy to make, the texture was great and they looked delicious but my wife and I both found them too sweet, not a cookie we would serve company or make again. Maybe the chocolate mix makes the difference.

Excellent recipe for FAST cookies. I have used different cake mixes, and my family really enjoys the carrot cake ones with cream cheese frostings not to mention the spice ones with the same frosting.  I also added 2 Tbs oil for added moisture.  This is a must recipe for any cook.

Yes, they were super easy to make but they weren't even edible.  They were SO grainy.  I hate to say it but they really tasted like you just mixed butter, cake mix, and eggs together if that makes any sense.  It was a big dissapointment since they were so easy to make!!

This gets a 5 for ease of preparation and modifiability (lol). I used yellow cake mix (regular 515g box) and added 1 tsp. vanilla extract. Divided the dough in two. In the first half, I added about 3/4 c. toffee bits. Yummy and not overly sweet! The dough is very sticky, though, so it is easiest to work with it chilled. It did spread and the top crackled nicely. In the 2nd half, I stirred in 3/4 c. peanut butter, rolled into balls, and pressed down with a fork. This dough was much less sticky and easy to work with. Bakes to almost 2x its size & makes yummy peanut butter cookies. So easy! NOTE: wait for cookies to completely cool before removing from cookie sheet, otherwise you'll leave behind bits of cookie. *** I have to update this review because the toffee bit variation is the best damned cookie I've had in a long time. I flatten it and it turns into a sweet crispy deliciousness. Everyone loves it.

Thanks Kristi for the recipe the are great, really easy to make, stays fresh and you really cant tell they came from a box. I just used  pillsberry chocolate cake mix, no nuts or chips, great just plain. Also added a little vanilla and almond and cooked for 9 mins. This recipe is a keeper , thanks for sharing. Also added 1 tlbs of oil and rolled the cookie  in a little ball before bakeing.

5 stars for easy, quick, and convenient, 3 stars for taste = 4 stars. Mine came out really sweet - better than I expected though. Kids loved them. I used a yellow cake mix with pudding in it, cup of milk chocolate chips, and a tsp of vanilla. Baked for 10 min on an airbake sheet. Will make again for the kids, but not for me (haha yea right!).

We can't get enough of these cookies. There are so many possibilities, and I think that's what I like most about this recipe. My husband raves about every batch of cookies I make, as long as they're from this recipe! It's so easy and user-friendly. Definitely a keeper and great to have on hand when you need a quick treat. Thanks!

Instead of chocolate chips, I substituted Mint Caps (little pink, green & yellow mints with the white beads on the botttom).  They turned out FABULOUS!!  Must try!!

This recipe makes the softest cookies I have ever had! I always roll the balls of dough in powdered sugar before baking. It makes them very pretty and adds a very nice taste to the cookie.

I was in the mood for cookies and had a cake mix and found this recipe, and it is GREAT!! I was worried they wouldn't taste like "real" cookies, not to worry. This was my first time making cake mix cookies. I did add 2tbs of oil and 1tsp vanilla and Irish cream per another reviewer.I used yellow cake mix and followed everything else. Definitely worth trying!!

These cookies were delicious and so easy.  I don't have a stand mixer so I don't do many "homemade" cookies, but this one was perfect for my little hand mixer.  I used a German Chocolate cake mix and added the brown sugar and peanut butter/chocolate chips.  They were DELICIOUS!

I made a variation of this recipe. I used a white cake mix, added a 12/ tsp of almond extract and green food coloring. Rolled them into balls and then sugar and finally placed a red candy heart in the center. In honor off the Grinch!

My first time making cookies from a cake mix.  My family loved them and didn't believe I made them myself.  I did make a few changes.  I used Betty Crocker triple chocolate mix and only half the choc chips.  I melted the butter because I couldn't wait for it to get soft, and only used 1 egg because I wanted them chewy.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and 2 Tbls of oil as suggested by others.  I made large cookies, so only got a dozen, and had to bake them for 11 minutes.  Thanks for the recipes and ideas!!

I had a box of Key Lime Cake mix I wanted to use up. Added the extra oil and to this mix I added lime extract. 

The first batch I sprinkled with raw sugar. I tasted one and it was ok but it needed something else.

The second sheet I rolled the dough in the raw sugar and then flatten the cookie- tastier cookie.

Easy recipe and good way to use up extra cake mixes.

Great easy delicious recipe! I add a couple tablespoons of oil to keep them moist.  Don't overcook, they won't seem done when your timer goes off but they will set up after they cool.

So it's Christmas eve, and I wanted to make a quick easy cookie. This one fit the bill simple, yummy, and something I could do with my 6 year old. I must say I am very impressed! I didn't follow the exact recipe.  Like most folks I added the 2T of oil (Canola) and 1t of vanilla. Highly recommend it and will make again. Santa has a nice little treat waiting.  Happy Holidays

These cookies are excellent, do add 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 Tbs of oil, they will come out perfect.  This is so easy and fast that my 12 year old son makes them by himself, today he made chocolate cookies with peanut butter chips... mmmm heaven.

Very good. So simple to make. I added walnuts and rolled them in icing sugar before I baked them. I baked them at 325 for 10 min since my oven seems to burn cookies on the bottom when I use recommended temps.

It doesn't get easier or better then this! This one is going into the recipe box for a quick recipe for when I get a chocolate craving! And since cake mix often goes on sale for a $1 I can stock up next time and get creative with flavor combos. This time I used Dunkin Hines chocolate cake mix and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp of instant coffee. After they cooled (too soft to eat out of oven) I liked zapping in the microwave for 10sec to get that out of oven goodness effect. I also tried them with Nutella spead on top....OMG addicting! Maybe its better you don't try it cause you'll be hooked!

I thought they they tasted good, but you need to spray the pan with something or use metal pans, not stones, they want to stick to the pan. Also you should not store them in an airtight container, or stack them on each other because they are so moist that they will stick together.

FINALLY, a chocolate cake-mix cookie recipe that works!!! For many years I've been making the recipes that call for 1/2 cup oil, instead of butter, and they always end up flat and crispy. These turned out soft and fluffy. The only thing I changed was that I used 1/2 cup semi-sweet and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. I'll definitely be making these again soon!

This recipe goes to eleven!  I made this simply to use some leftover ingredients.  The result was the most soft and beautiful cookies I think I have ever made.  I melted the butter completely, and the cookies turned out with the perfect shiny crackly surface that I thought I would never achieve.  The combinations are endless, the recipe comes together in a snap, and the results make you look like a fabulous cook.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

The cookies turned out perfect! I used Duncan Hines double fudge cake mix and peanut butter chips. Some other reviewers added 2 tbsp. of vegetable oil, I opted for coconut oil! They were baked thoroughly and to perfection at 9 minutes. Soft and moist - will definitely make again!

VERY PEDESTRIAN COOKIE. I knew this going in but I was looking for something easy and fast that tasted pretty good. I never expected to knock this out of the park but I wasn't expecting a flop either. This was a flop.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added 2 tablespoons oil and some vanilla. I didn't have chocolate extract on hand and I wish I had -- these needed it despite using a Duncin Heinz rich chocolate fudge cake mix. I make my cakes from scratch now so I can barely tolerate the mix stuff anymore and this is why -- they lack flavor. I knew better and am kicking myself for even trying it. I also added almost a full box of Andes mints like the first reviewer did but they need at least two boxes. I think the chocolate chips would have been better because they might have improved slightly on the chocolate flavor this so desperately lacks. My oven is powerful and I should not have baked these at 350. They flattened out and got crispy that way and I used two eggs and some oil plus buter so that should NOT have happened. The second batch I baked at 330 and had to take them out half raw to avoid them getting crispy on me.  Don't waste your time with this when there are so many other good cookie recipes out there. What was I thinking?!!!!!!!!

Not a perfect cookie, but I thought it was pretty great in a pinch.  I followed other advice and added about 1.5 T of canola oil and 1t of vanilla.  I also only had jumbo eggs, so I added one whole egg and an extra yolk.  I used a 1.5T scoop and these spread to about 3" round without being flattened at all, but I had to cook, rotating once in the oven for 14 min to cook fully.  I used "Betty C" triple chocolate mix.

These were surprisingly good!  I love to bake and I pride myself on making everything from scratch, but I had a box of cake mix lying around from a gift so I thought I'd give this a try.  I used shortening instead of butter to keep them from flattening out.  I also added the 2Tbsp of oil and 1tsp vanilla like everyone suggested.  Fudgy and delicious!

Fan-Freakin-Tastic!  I followed other's advice...1/2 c oil, 1 egg, cake mix, 2 tbsp water, 1 cup of mint choc chips into Betty Crocker Triple Choc Fudge cake mix. Baked at 350 for 9 minutes. The cookies turned out thick and chunky looking with the right amount of crunch on the outside and little bit soft on the inside.  I don't care for chewy cookies so these were perfect. One of the cookies didn't get any mint chips and I tasted it "plain"...the taste was a little dull as other's have reviewed.  These cookies are best with something incorporated into the batter...nuts, pb chips...something. This is how I will make cookies from now on.  Love this!

Fantastic. They were THE first to go on a tray of 200 cookies. They were soft and chocolatey and stayed soft for days. Great "go to"  cookie recipe.

WOW!! I loved this recipe!!! I followed others advice and added 2T of oil and 1t of vanilla to the recipe and it was great!! It make 30 cookies and I baked both sheets at once. I left the racks to close to each other so, the top sheet looked "cracked" (like others said) but the bottom sheet looked too moist so, I turned the oven off and left it in there for 3 mins. It still didn't come out looking "cracked" but I could tell they were done. Oh man the difference was delicious. The 8 min "cracked" cookies were gooey but the cookies that stayed in the warm oven for 3 extra minutes were perfect. I honestly can't believe how good they came out. Not cake like at all and they spread quite a bit. I really don't like baking cookies but I have to admit that hubby will go nuts for these and because it's such an easy recipe, I'll be making them ALOT this holiday!

I really liked these! My first attempt was using chocolate cake mix using 1/2 cup craisins and some chopped pecans. They turned out great! I can't wait to stock up on cake mixes when they go on sale!

These are the least expensive, fastest, easiest, tastiest cookies to make. Thanks to other reviewers, I tweaked the recipe a little and now think of them as "One Cookies"...One chocolate cake mix, one stick of melted butter, one egg, one tsp. of vanilla, one handful of chocolate chips. So easy to clean up...One mixing bowl, one cereal bowl (for melting the butter), and one spoon. I was done mixing before the oven was done pre-heating. And there is no need to drag out the electric mixer. My new oven is very accurate (yay!) and they bake at 350 for 9 minutes.

This recipe Rocks!  My hubby and I are both diabetic, so I used a Sugar-free cake mix, added the oil some recommended below and used sugar-free candy (Reece's Peanut Butter Cup minis) and the cookies were awesome and guilt free!  Thank you so much for sharing it!!

I made these tonight and added 1 tablespoon oil and a teaspoon of vanilla per another review's suggestions. I used a box of German chocolate cake mix and added dark chocolate chip and pieces of caramel.

I took the advice of others and added 1sp vanilla and 2tb of veg oil.  The oil made them greasy and too soft that they folded over when you picked them up.  Next time I will use less oil or none at all.  The taste was good though.  I used Devil's Food cake and white choc chips.

Amazingly quick to make.  A great fallback as these are ingredients that we'd always have on hand.  I too added 2 TBSP veg oil & 1 tsp vanilla but it still tastes "cakey" to me.  I think that I'd follow the advice of 1 egg+1 yolk next time instead of 2 eggs.  Used 1/2c dark M&Ms + 1/2c semi sweet chips and would just use the chips next time (the M&Ms made them a bit too sweet.)

I've made these cookies 3 times now (chocolate with vanilla frosting & sprinkles, chocolate with mini Reese's pieces and funfetti with matching frosting) and I've received RAVE reviews every time! The possibilities are endless with these cookies. Took 10 minutes to bake (the funfetti took a little longer) but seconds to disappear. This is my simple quick go to cookie recipe.

OMG these are great. I used Devils Food Cake and a 10 oz. pkg cherry chips, and followed the directions. Mine took 15 minutes to cook as I used a stone to cook them on. So quick and easy!!!! Made 55 cookies with a small pampered chef scoop.

I took the suggestions of adding 2TBSP of oil and 1TSP of vanilla. My kids love the cookies and I don't find them to sweet considering its pure chocolate. I had to bake the cookies longer then 10 minutes though to get them fully cooked.

Great and super easy recipe.  My daughter (2yrs) and I just made these! YUM!  We added 2-3 Tbl of caramel to the batter, and they are awesome!  Love how easy it is to change this recipe up.  I'm already thinking of new combos.

Christmas variation with candy cane kiss.  I made with a devil's food mix and added the 2T oil- which kept the dough a good consistency.  Made them for Christmas, so when they came out of the oven after 8 minutes, I added a Hershey candy cane kiss (white chocolate mint with red stripe and candy cane bits)- helps if you refrigerate the kisses before putting them on the hot cookies, so that the kiss maintains it's shape.  These were very easy, festive and yummy.

I did NOT like these! Surprised since most of the reviews were so wonderful. I don't know if it was specifically the chocolate cake mix, but they came out salty while at the same time cloyingly sweet. They were crumbly while at the same time cakey. Wouldn't make again.

I have a brand new oven and i had to bake them for 30 min. and they were still not fully cooked! So i had to broil them for about 2 min. Okay.... Not the best recipe because mine ended up being very doughy from the inside and rock hard from the outside.... But 2/7 people liked them so i must have done something right? Not recommended.

Used Duncan Hines, Devil's food Chocolate, with a small/medium ice cream scoop.  Did not have to flatten, before baking, like others.  At first, I accidentally used 2 sticks of butter for one recipe, thankfully I had another box of cake mix.   I was wondering why the first batch was so buttery.  LOL   I did use 2 Tbls of oil and 1 teaspoon of vanilla, per suggestion.  Also used powder sugar on half of the cookies for a crinkle look, per another reviewer.  Definitely add the chocolate chips.  Good cookies.  Would make again.

WOW WOW WOW incredible cookies! I just made these with devil's food cake mix, rolled into balls and rolled in sugar and they're incredible! They look like they belong in a magazine and taste like heaven. I live in a house with 8 boys and they always enjoy when I cook, but they were REALLY wowed by these :)
The batter was quite stiff, but other than that, these were simply amazing. Thanks for such an easy, wonderful recipe!

I made with orange cake mix and white chocolate chips - I added 2 tablespoons of canola oil and 1 tsp vanilla extract like the others suggested and they turned out amazing!  Only thing, someone said they don't spread - that must be if you don't use oil.  My first tray spread into each other, so I had to space them out better on the second tray.

If I could give this 6 stars, I would!  These turned out so well.  Fresh out of the oven, I already ate 3 cookies because they were that good!

Like other reviewers, I added canola oil and vanilla.  I added oil just because they still seemed too dry as a stirred the dough.  I let my cookies rest on the sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool.  They turned out exactly how I like them: spread out, gooey, and slightly crispy not cakey and puffy.  I WILL be making these again!

I added some almond extract and I used 60% cocoa chocolate chips.  They are so easy and quick to make.  I made them for a retirement party and my family ate so many I had to make more.

This is ALWAYS a favorite at Christmas. People always look for the white cake mix cookies. I made a few changes, veggie oil makes the mix too heavy and doesn't come out fluffy. I use butter crisco instead of butter, three table spoons of water and three egg whites. This recipe is the best out of all of them! ?

After all the stellar reviews, I was surprised when these cookies turned out to be just... ok.   I used triple chocolate cake mix (with peanut butter chips), but they weren't very chocolatey at all-- just kind of bland and generic-tasting.       If I were to do it over again I'd probably add chocolate chips, as well, for an extra burst of flavor.   But I'll probably be moving on from this recipe.

I took the advice of other reviewers & added 2T oil & 1 tsp vanilla. I used a Devil's Food Cake recipe and white & milk chocolate chips. YUMMY!!! I think we'll go through at least a gallon of milk with these. They're so good! Easy recipe, especially with kids.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would! I came across this recipe while looking for a simple cookie recipe that I could make with my 6 yr old daughter. I love to cook, but I'm not big on baking and had never tried a "cake mix" cookie recipe before. These are sooo delicious and simple, I can't remember the last time I actually ate a cookie (I'm not a huge sweets fan), but I find myself sneeking in the cupboard for these! They are moist and keep for a long time just in a ziploc bag. My favorite variation is devils food cake mix, half a cup white chocolate chips, and half a cup chopped walnuts. I also add the 2 Tbs. veg oil and 1 tps. vanilla extract as suggested by other reviewers. These taste better than bakery cookies and they are the ONLY cookie that I make. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!!

Great recipe! Just took these out of the oven and my house smells great (-: I added the oil & vanilla like other reviewers. I also added 1 to 2 Tbl flour to make the dough a little less sticky and easier to work with.  Thanks for posting this one; It's a keeper!

A quick cookie batter to whip up.  My cookies spread a lot,  I'll have to space them further apart for next time.  I followed the advice of others, and flattened them, and they came out pretty flat.    I chopped mint chocolates in half and used white chocolate chips and nuts in the other. These cookies were "fluffy," and "airy."

I didn't really know how to rate the original recipe, since I strayed so far from it!  Made these using a Duncan Hines Devil's Food cake mix.  Added the Reviewers' recommended 2 T. oil and 1 t. vanilla.  Also added a pinch of salt and about 1 t. instant coffee granules mixed with a few drops of water.  (These are difficult to mix - make sure your butter is room temp - my arm was sore from mixing!)  Cut dough into thirds and made 3 different kinds.  Craisins, white choc. chips and walnuts; Skor candy bar; Reese's Peanut Butter cups.  I baked them all for somewhere between 13 and 15 minutes.  The craisin cookies were quite soft after cooling.  The Reese's and Skor cookies were more firm, but still soft after being completely cooled.   I ended up putting all back into the oven on 200 for about 15 minutes.  Now I have pretty crisp cookies!  This was quite a bit of work, but they taste pretty good with the add-ins and now I know what to do.  Don't skimp on the add-ins!  *****Also wanted to mention that these puff up quite a bit while baking, but start to flatten as soon as they come out of the oven.  I used a small cookie scoop which worked nicely and didn't flatten them at all - they spread out on their own while baking.  Perhaps adding a little flour would them stay a little puffed-up?  Also, not a strong choc. flavor, but could add cocoa or choc. chips.  I posted a pic.  Made about 33 cookies.

These are delicious! I'm so confused by the reviewer who totally changed the recipe and then gave it a very low rating because they turned out horrible. I've made these MANY times and every time people rave about them. It's a very simple recipe. No need to add anything. They are amazing!! But if you're going to totally switch the entire thing around, don't be surprised if they come out "flat" and "raw" like. But for everyone else, these cookies are fabulous. I've made them with chocolate cake mix with chocolate chips, strawberry mix and white chocolate chips, carrot cake mix and white chocolate chips, white cake mix and chocolate chips and red velvet cake mix and white chocolate chips to name a few!

I'm only giving this recipe 5 stars because of the heavenly taste, but the cookies were very flat once they settled and easy to break. I added about a tablespoon of oil because of the batter's dryness. Then I topped the finished cookies with whipped buttercream frosting from a can. They did taste great.

Great as a bar cookie!  I added 1/8 c. brown sugar, 2 T. oil, and 1 t. vanilla to a dark chocolate cake mix with dark choc chocolate chips.  Lightly pressed into greased 9x13 cake pan, pressed walnuts lightly over top.  Baked 20-25 minutes at 350 until toothpick came out clean.  Friends loved it!

Good recipe - I did as others recommended and subbed out the butter for 1/2c oil - added semi sweet chocolate chips and white chocolate chips - these were devoured. Woot!

oh my, these are wonderful--if you're a chocolate lover.  i had to extend the baking time a bit but could just be my oven.  they were soft & gooey before i extended the baking time which really doesn't bother me but i wanted them to be more firm so i could box them up for friends/family.  this is a family favorite now! i did follow the suggestions to add the oil since the batter was quite dry.

These were fantastic and delicious!  I cooked the first batch the perfect amount of time (about 8 minutes) - they didn't seem cooked all the way but they turned out perfect so even if they don't seem done, they are!  They tasted like a brownie - chewy and soft.  I added the suggested recommendations of 1 tsp vanilla and 2 Tbsp oil and they were perfect. I totally recommend this recipe.

Like everyone else, I added 2 T of oil and 1 tsp of vanilla... AWESOME. Instead of semisweet chocolate chips, I used a special seasonal Nestle bag of mixed dark chocolate/mint chips. They tasted like a soft and chewy version of Girl Scout Thin Mints!!! Everyone loved them. Also, the recipe made about 44 cookies (using a small cookie scoop), not 24, but the cooking time was right on = 8-9 minutes for me. Thanks, Kristi!

ive been trying all the recipes for these trying to find the best. tonight i had to improvise so i used 1/2 stick butter 1 egg and 1/2 c choco chips. ive noticed that they all come out relatively the same no matter if its 1 or 2 eggs. ive also done one i used a whole stick of butter in. these recipes are VERY forgiving and definitely worth a try.

Fantastic cookies that are amazingly simple to make! I also added 2T oil and 1T vanilla.   Will be trying this again with different variations!! Next time I will melt the butter instead of softening. Thank you!

WOW. This cookie was extremely delicious! Instead of the chocolate cake mix and chocolate chips I used carrot cake mix with white chocolate chips and they were insanely good.  I found that the batter was a bit thick and the chips didn't really adhere well to the batter nicely, so I added some vegetable oil and everything turned out fine. My first 2 batches were without the vegetable oil and my last batch and a half was with the oil, and they both turned out excellent. I also purchased sqeezable cream cheese frosting that comes in a whipped cream spray type bottle, so people can just put on frosting as they desired. The cookie tastes perfectly fine without the frosting, but either way is delicious.  I ate about 6 of these cookies in one night and my dad ended up eating about 12! Needless to say, they didn't last very long and were so rich and delicious!

I was not a fan...I tried to use applesause as a healthy alternative instead of the oil/butter.  The cookies stuck to my cooking stones and they never "hardened".  They just stayed way too moist and sticky!  I most likely will not make these again!

I consider myself a pretty good cookie baker, and these totally flopped. Kind of embarrassing, since these are supposed to be a no-brainer to make. First time in a LONG time I threw the whole thing away.

I use this recipe all of the time and have made a plethora of alterations, depending on my mood. I've used white cake mix, chocolate cake mix, added peanut butter, added coffee, etc. It always turns out perfectly and everyone else always eats them up.

This was awesome!! I picked this one for the kids to use at our youth bake sale. They were so easy for the kids and they tasted GREAT! The only diff I made was that I added some vanilla. Will use this again and again.

These cookies received a better response than any I've ever made. I used Devil's Food Cake mix with the crushed Andes' Candies. (as a previous reviewer had tried). The batter seemed really, really dense so I actually added about 1/4 cup of sour cream. The finished product had an unbelievable texture, size and (most importantly) taste.  I made them the next day with the same cake mix but used peanut butter chips. The jury's still out on which we like better. ;) Thanks for such a great recipe!!

I used the suggested addition of 2Tbsp oil and 1tsp vanilla. These are so good, and easy to vary. I like them with butterscotch chips instead of chocolate!

Fantastic cookies! I used a devil's food cake mix & mint chocolate chips. I also added 2 Tbsp. vegetable oil & 1 Tsp. vanilla (as per other reviewers) to the mix. I used a tbsp. to scoop cookies onto pan & they turned out the perfect size for us. I cooked them for only 8-10 min. since we like them soft & gooey! Thank you for my new favorite cookie recipe!!!!

Wow! these are soft and good cookies. They are quick too. I put 2 T spoons of oil, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, t spoon of vanilla exact, and I used yellow cake mix.I also used the whole bag of chocolate chips. I preheated my oven to 300 and baked them for 20 minutes. They came out great. I will make these again using different cake mixes. Thank you.

I can appreciate that this is a quick, easy recipe, but it really is nothing special. The cookies have very little texture or flavor, which in retrospect isn't surprising considering the main component is cake mix. I don't give many bad reviews, but I think the overall rating is off-kilter. These might work for you if you're in a pinch, but I wouldn't say they are good cookies.

Very good cookie and LOVE how quick and easy they are!  I have made cake mix cookies many times, but with 1/4 cup oil rather than the butter.  I like this version better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I also added 2T of oil and 1t of vanilla.  They turned out excellent when I baked them for 8 or 9 minutes.  Today I decided to make them again with the added oil and vanilla, however; I decided to use an egg substitute and they did not turn out anywhere near yesterday's batch.  They ran all over the baking pan and were flat.  Plus I baked them for 10 minutes and took them out, only to find them undercooked.     So definitely use 2 whole eggs add the vanilla and oil follow the original recipe and people will be begging you for more!

First i must say i am an old fashion make from scratch dessert person and was very skeptical but these really impressed me, they were really easy and very tasty. These were soo easy and very good. *HINT* melt the butter completely, so there is more liquid to mix the batter, i made three batches, 1 with milk chocolate cake and 1 cup semi sweet chips, 1 with butter pecan added 1/2 cup chopped pecans and topped the cookie with a pecan half, and 1 with strawberry cake and mixed in 3/4 cup white chocolate chips. I would recommend 1/2 -3/4 cup of either chocolate chips or white chips, i felt 1 cup was too much. The strawberry cake makes a pretty pink cookie which little girls love! I think this is easily adaptable to any cake mix! All three batches made exactly 24 cookies. Darker pans take a minute or two less time.

I wanted some quick cookies and all I had was yellow cake mix, so I followed this recipe with the yellow cake mix, dried cranberries, and pecans. I added about a tsp of almond flavoring and they turned out wonderful! Super fast and easy for when you need to fill up the cookie jar. My husband loved them.

This is the easiest cookie recipe ever!  I took the other reviewers advice about the tsp of vanilla and 2 T of oil.  I made mine with chocolate cake mix and added the Andes mint chips.  They were like chewy thin mint girlscout cookies.  I would make a batch and they would disappear as soon as I pulled them out of the oven.  Mmm mmm good!

I made these cookies using Duncan Hines devils food mix.  I took the advice of other reviews and aded the oil and vanilla.  My oven was at 350, but I had to cook them for 13 min or more and even then couldn't get them off the Pampered Chef baking stone because they were underdone.  They taste good, but I think the oil made them too moist.  Next time, if there is a next time, I will follow the original recipe.  Hopefully they will turn out much better.

Absolutely delicious.  This is the easiest cookie recipe I have ever made.  I made two different batches because the variety of cookies is endless.  Marble cake with peanut butter pieces....and chocolate with chocolate chips.  I think I will be more creative next time....

Doesn't get any easier than this! and boy are they GOOOOOD.  Chocolate is by far the best flavor to use as far as taste, although it works well with any flavor cake.  I prefer this recipe using butter to the numerous ones I've seen using oil. I did add 1 tsp baking powder and it worked very well.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I followed the other reviewers' advice and substituted butter for 2 Tablespoons of oil and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.    I had to make a lot of cookies, so I made one batch with a yellow cake box mix and one with a dark chocolate one.  I then made ball shapes with half of each, for a black and white cookie.  They look and taste fantastic!

My husband really enjoyed these cookies, I thought they were good-not great.  I did have a little oopsie, imagine with 3 kids in the kitchen having that happen:)  Somehow, I had in my brain that I needed to use 1 c. butter.  I didn't realize until after I already had it partially mixed that it was only 1/2 cup. I was nervous that the cookies would be a total disaster. They weren't they did spread obviously, but no so much that they were ruined. I used chocolate cake mix, and added Andes mint chips.  My husband wants me to accidently use 1 c. butter every time. I would like to try it with just one (save as much as we can on calories and our arteries)!

It's a brownie cookie! Fudgy, sweet, soft. So easy to prepare I almost felt guilty! I won't give anyone else the recipe, they think I made them from scratch. Don't start eating these unless you're prepared to gobble up more than one. Extra special with milk.

Oh my, this was delicious and a HUGE hit with my family. I used Lemon Supreme cake mix and just added the butter and eggs. I then made a simple icing using powdered sugar, vanilla and milk. They were so rich I could only eat ONE! But oh, they were SOOO good!

I just made this recipe this morning and I had to say thank you to the original cook that submitted this recipe and to those that added helpful hints, so THANK YOU! This was soo easy, used Devil's Food Betty Crocker, added the other's suggestions (of using 2 T oil and 1 tsp. vanilla) & then added holiday swirl chocolate chips. They turned out absolutely delicious and are very festive for Christmas Eve. Thanks again and Happy Holidays to all the cooks who are slaving in the kitchen over Christmas dinner and to those who are feasting on the wonderful recipes like these and all of the rest on this site. Merry Christmas!

These are so good!  I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips, what a great combination!  The batter seems to stiff when you are mixing it, but they turn out perfect without any additions!

Not a big fan of these. To me, the fact that they were made with cake mix was obvious in both texture and taste. I was in a hurry and needed something quick, so that's why I chose to make it. But I prefer cookies made from scratch, I think.

SO SO GOOD!  My 6 year old helped me make these and they were so easy (and innexpensive) to make.  Much cheaper than buying cookie mix or pre-made dough.  They are super soft and moist (mine baked for 9 min).  I used Pillsbury dark chocolate mix along with mini chocolate chips.  I also added in the 2 tsp of oil with the butter.  I will be making these again soon!

We cleaned out the pantry yesterday and found two boxes of german chocolate cake mix that go bad in a couple weeks. My family asked me to find something to do with them so i decided to try these. They're not the most amazing baking feat i've ever made, but they are pretty darn good. I used a cup of pecans, since i'm out of chips, and they came out realy nice. They're soft and moist on the inside ((not undercooked)) and crispy along the edges. 
If they're burning on a dark pan or non-stick pan make sure to turn your oven down 25 degrees. I did, and they're sonderful.
Thanks so much for sharing! They're going on my holiday cookie sharing list.

These are good and very simple.  I chilled the dough for several hours before baking. I think that helps them from spreading as I like cookies round and puffy.  I baked them on parchment paper and mine took closer to 12 minutes each batch to bake.

I've been looking for the perfect boxed cake cookies, and I think I've found it!  I used Devil's Food Cake (chocolate cake), and mint chips (Andes Creme de Menthe chips).  If you're a mint person, you will LOVE the combo!  
The most easy and tasty cookie, I highly recommend!

I just finished baking these, and I am very impressed! I just so happen to have all the ingredients in my house and it's my cousin's bday tomorrow, so I decided to bake them for her and I'm so happy I did! I love how moist they turned out and I can't wait to make them again. One thing I learned was that if I dropped the dough by the spoonful in mounds, they pretty much stayed that way but if I flattened them a little, they get too flat and become very delicate. So, I'm guessing the way to go is somewhere in between to get the right size and shape of the cookie.

I love this recipe. You can use so many different kinds of cake mix and different variations of add ins to make this one yours. I always get compliments on the devils food and chocolate chips though. It only takes a few minutes to mix up a batch for suprise company. I always buy at least 10 boxes of cake mix when it's on sale for $1 so I always have it on hand.

I'm a big fan of this recipe and share it with everyone i know! I've tried several different versions, using yellow cake with chocolate chunks (everyone else liked this but i thought the cake flavor was overpowering); spice cake with white chocolate chips (my husband LOVES this one); and my favorite, strawberry cake with vanilla icing! DELISH!

These were a hit at our BBQ. I followed the recipe with one box of Betty Crocker chocolate cake mix and Ghirardelli choc chips. I added a tiny bit of oil and it was perfect. I made one batch chewy and one batch crispy by leaving it in longer a couple more minutes so that all people could be satisfied.

I'm in heaven right now! I used yellow butter cake mix, added 1 T. of oil, and 1tsp. vanilla. For the last batch I threw in sprinkles, those were my favorite. I ate 3 in a row!

I don't think adding the 2 Tbsp. oil worked for our batch- either that, or these do need to be chilled for awhile.  Our cookies came out completely flat.  They did taste like flat brownies, though, and my kids thought they were great (but I just think it's because they'll eat anything with sugar!).  I wasn't impressed with the flavor- I'd rather have a real brownie than a flat brownie-flavored cookie.

Wonderful recipe.  I wanted something quick and this was certainly it.  I used an organic cake mix and added the chips and walnuts.  Turned out awesome.  I always add 1tsp of vanilla extract to my mixes.  The family loved them.

I made this recipe last semester in the dorm's kitchen. They were fast to make and not a big mess, so perfect for college. They were also delicious. My two roommates had them gobbled up in no time. Unfortunatly I had to deal with the ingredients that I could find at the convenient store near campus, which only had yellow cake mix, eggs, and butter. I also frosted the cookies with vanilla icing.

I just made these easy & yummy cookies using Triple Chocolate Fudge mix.  The sheep that I am added the 2 T. oil and 1 t. vanilla just in case.  I sustituted 1/2 c. chocolate chunks and 1/2 c. caramel bits for the 1 c. regular chips.  After plopping standard cookie scoops on insulated baking sheets, I pressed about 5 caramel bits and 2-3 chocolate chunks onto each cookie top.  These little gems took about 10 minutes to bake with 3-5 resting on the sheets before removal.  The recipe made exactly 32 cookies.  Results?  Deeeeeeeelish!

Great cookie!  I followed others' suggestions and added 2 tsp oil and 1 tsp vanilla.  I've had a few recipes that called for less than a full bag of chocolate chips so I used those up.  Added semisweet chocolate chips, mini chips and some white chocolate chips.  Definitely good for a chocolate lover.  I had an idea for a variation, white cake mix and the peppermint chips they sell during the holidays.   I think those will be so yummy!

I used yellow cake mix. I also used the two tablespoons vegetable oil and two tablespoons vanilla and the 1/4 cup brown sugar. I added chocolate chips and heath bits. My cookies took about 12-14 minutes to bake. When I was finished I made cookie-wiches out of them. I put two together with frosting in between them. I used chocolate frosting it was very good.

This is the easiest cookies recipe I have found! And the cookies taste great!! I used yellow cake mix and added coconut flakes. Will continue to experiment with different combinations and additions (nuts, raisins, etc.) Thank you for posting the recipe!

I'm wondering if they forgot an ingredient because I always had to add about a cup of water, give or take. But after that, they turn out great. I added chopped Andes mints. (you can find them pre-chopped in a bag) Of the three types of cookies I gave people for X-mas, this was the highest rated and easiest to make.

WOW!! How simple and delicious. I used a Devil's Food Cake mix, left out the choc chips, added the 2 tbs oil and 1 tsp vanilla. I also had on hand a container of milk choc frosting. To thicken up the frosting I added confectioners sugar then frosted the cookies. I then sprinkled crushed candy canes for color and an extra Christmas flavor. They were a hit.

I used 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk, rather than two eggs, then eventually just kneaded this with my hands to mix well.  I thought it was far too dry and didn't want dry cookies, so I took previous reviewers' advice and added some oil.  I didn't measure, I just added a little at a time until the batter seemed moist enough.  Also added about 1 tsp of vanilla.  I did press the dough down just a little, not much, and 8 minutes precisely did the trick.  You must let them cool on the pan, give them time to set.  Quite a delicious, simply treat.  They're soft and rich, just as expected.

I am VERY impressed by the outcome of these easy cookies!

A few modifications:
1. Used Reduced Sugar pillsbury cake mix.
2. Used extra 2 T Smart Balance oil per previous recommendations.
3. Used 1/2 c Smart Balance oil instead of butter as I was out!
4. Used M&Ms...do NOT add a cup of M&Ms as they do not hold onto the dough as well as would chocolate chips.

I will be making these OFTEN as they are DELICIOUS.  Thank you for the recipe!

This cookie is like a hybrid between a brownie and a thin chewy chocolate cookie.  I used applesauce instead of oil and they are very moist.  After placing the first batch in the oven I realized I forgot the add in vanilla and cinnamon.  

With or without the adjustments these cookies are great.

I just made these cookies and I must say this is the first time I've ever made cookies from a prepared cake mix.  This was so easy and so very delicious.  I plan to give them to some of my neighbors.  I do recommend  to add the 2 Tab. oil, 1 tea. vanilla, and change the eggs from 2 to 1 whole egg plus 1 yolk.  I also added 1 cup chopped walnuts.  If you like a lot of chocolate chips, I would add another 1/2 cup to this recipe.  These taste homemade and just like a brownie.  Thanks everyone for the hints.  This is my first experience with this site and I must say - Bravo!

These cookies are addictive, but what chocolate isn't? I only gave this recipe 4 stars because it really isn't out of this world, it's pretty great though. I used chocolate cake mix and mini chocolate chips and it made about 30 cookies. I used other reviewer's suggestions and added 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon vanilla. These cookies are extremely sweet and yummy, they taste like a brownie. I feel like they're missing just a tiny something to make them spectacular though, maybe some sort of spice?

I love the fact that you can do so many variations with this recipe. I used chocolate cake mix and did one batch with peanut butter and chocolate swirled chips and one batch with white chocolate, semisweet chocolate, and walnuts. Next time I think I'll try cherry chips with chocolate cake mix. 
I'm sure these would have been great... had I been able to figure out a good cooking time. 8 minutes was WAY too much for my oven, but at 7 they seemed undercooked. I'll try 8 next time, but maybe lower the cooking temp. a bit.

This recipe is so easy I let my 10 year old make these cookies.  I added walnuts and chocolate chips.  My 7 year old flipped over these cookies.  He told his sisters they were the best cookies he ever had and he couldn't stop eating them.  Don't know if I should thank you or not because I know my daughter will want to make these all the time.

What a flop! Due to egg allergy used egg substitute, 2 tblspn oil and because the mix was still too dry, 2 tbslpn milk. The submitter only wrote by "spoonfuls". I've never made cake mix cookies, so I used a tablespoon. Big mistake. Use TEASPOONS here people. My balls were too bit and mine spread flat across my whole pan, didn't maintain their shape or rise a little. I had to cook them for longer. Kids are disappointed. Next time I'll just make the cake. Thanks anyway.

They were chocolate-y, but were a little dry.  It kinda tasted like I was eating a big chocolate chip.

These were lots of fun to make and tasty.  I did, however, have some  trouble when baking them. I took the first tray out at 9 minutes, and they looked great.  Then, a second later, they all went flat.  Nice a chewy around the edges but soft in the middle with a cake batter flavor.  The second tray went in and I set the timer and wandered away.  The ringer was off on the timer, and when I remembered them, they had baked for 15 minutes.  These came out puffy and crinkled but cooled to be crunchy but tasty.  My 7-year-old had lots of fun helping me make these.I'll work on the timing.  Thanks

Very easy recipe...great for making cooking with kids.  I thought that the cookies taste okay...not great.   I thought it could use a bit more flavoring...and of course I didn't read the previous reviews before I made these.  I do agree that a bit of vanilla extract would perk up the flavor enough to make them really tasty.

YUM!  I used German Chocolate Cake Mix and semi-sweet chocolate chip cookies. Didn't change the recipe at all and they were perfect.  I made little sundaes with them by breaking them up a bit (they're so soft and moist!) and putting peppermint ice cream and a dollop of whipped cream on top.  FANTASTIC!

Used yellow mix, the 1/2 c butter, + 2 T oil, 2 eggs, coconut and semisweet chips.  Fantastic!!  I didn't think they needed the vanilla someone else recommended.  Will be trying other variations!!  Great recipe!

These cookies are so easy to make and taste absolutly wonderful I made 24 servings of four different kinds of cookies. Raindow Party Mix with Milk Chocolate; Chocolate Fudge with Peanut Butter; Strawberry with White Chocolate; French Vanilla with Toffee. I would have to say that my favorite was the later but all of them went just as fast as the others. When you eat them warm they taste absolutly devine but a little less like a cookie. After they sit for a little while you can't even tell that you made them from a cake mix. So many people told me that one of the kinds of cookies made their top 5 list of their all time favorite cookies. These will be a staple in my house!

Easy and yummy.  I have had something like this before, but I had no idea how easy is would be.  If the cookies are soft when you take them out of the oven, don't worry, they cool in 20 minutes to perfection.

This is just the simplest and quickest cookie fix ever! We love home made cookies and this saves me alot of trouble when I don't feel like mesuring too much. I use butter flavored Crisco for crispy/chewy cookies (more volume too) and the Swiss Chocolate cake mix is our big winner for double chocolate cookies. I love to add a cup of pecans (or other nuts) as well. A family favorite!

As everyone else has said, very easy recipe to whip up with limited amount of time.  For some reason, my first batch spread quite a bit, but the second batch baked up nice like I was expecting.  The only difference was the first batch was on an insulated pan.  I used PAM on both.

YUM...these cookies are awesome!  So easy and versatile, you can use whatever you happen to have in the pantry!  Today, I used a spice cake mix with cinnamon chips. SO DELICIOUS. I'm also making some with dark chocolate mix and mini chocolate chips. I can't wait to try those too.....THANKS!!!!!!!!

These were delicious and easy. And they really do stay soft for days. I've made this twice so far. Both times with chocolate cake but once with peanut butter chips and once with semi-sweet chips. I preferred the peanut butter.

YUm YUM!  Used Duncan Hines chococlate cake mix w/peanut butter chips.  Batter is very thick, but cookies turned out moist and chewy.  Don't be thrown off by the thickness of the batter!Cookies are awesome!

Delicious cookies! They came out soft and chewy, and were super easy.  There are so many variations that can be done with this, I can't wait to start experimenting!

So good, I also add 1 tsp. vanilla and 2 Tbsp. oil to this recipe and the cookies come out great everytime.  The possiblities are endless with all the different kinds of cake mixes out there and all the things you can add to them.

easy and quick.  I used golden butter mix and butterscotch chips.  Flavor was good but I used margarine in lieu of butter and therefore they spread out quite a bit.  I have subbed margarine in other cake mix cookie recipes without that problem.  Very versatile recipe.

I must agree that these are great. Being the chocoholic I am I did make them how the recipe reads. Next time I am going to try with Peanut butter chips. I also had to cook them longer then the recipe says. My first sheet was pretty raw in the middle.

My husband and kids absolutely love these cookies. We've tried it using lemon cake mix and strawberry cake mix without the chocolate chips. Both of them were excellent!

This is a great recipe, but I made it better by adding some of my own ingredients.  I used 1/2 cup of butter flavored Crisco and 2 Tbs. of vegetable oil.  I happened to use a spice cake mix and added raisins, a small bit of powdered cinnamon and cloves.  I baked the cookie until it was firm on top but still soft to the touch.  When cooled, I drizzled on some icing.  Everyone I know wants this recipe.

Yummy and easy!  Very chocolatey.  It made double the amount indicated.  I used margarine instead of butter; added 2 T oil and 1 t vanilla as others mentioned.  Also used a plain chocolate pudding in the mix type cake mix.

This is a great recipe.  It is very easy.  I got this recipe from a friend who found it on this site.  She added the 2T. of oil and the 1t. of vanilla, but instead of choc. chips she added the Andes Mint Chips instead.  Delicious!!

Easy way to make cookies.  I used olive oil (the extra light tasting kind for baking) and they were yummy.  Did not stay around long.  My favorite combo is devil's food cake mix with semi-sweet choc chips.

These cookies were very moist and incredibly easy to make.  My kids loved them so much, that my son had me make them to bring to school for his birthday.  I made them with the chocolate cake mix and chocolate chips and they came out perfect.

Used devils food box cake mix and whites chocolate chips. Simple to make, but nothing special in the taste. Maybe it will taste better using another cake mix flavor. 
The cookies came out soft, & batter did not spread while baking. So they were kind of misshaped and clunky-looking. Not a pretty cookie!

I used Pillsbury’s Gluten Free Confetti cake mix and added 1/4 bag of chocolate chips.  It held solid and upright.  The result was a soft and cooked through delight.  One of the best GF cookies I have ever had.  I made them for the office, and everyone loved them.  I didn’t tell them they were Gluten Free until they ate them.

Wow, are these good!  I used a Devil's Food cake mix and followed the recipe directions.  Then I also added 2 tbsp. of oil, 1 tsp. vanilla and a partial bag of chocolate chips.  Used a cookie scoop and baked the cookies for 10 min.  When they came out, I let them sit on the sheet for 5 full minutes before moving them to a cooling rack.  They taste like moist, chewy brownies!  Definitely the easiest cookies I've ever made.

Update:  I made these a second time and used a Red Velvet cake mix, a bag of White Chocolate Peppermint M & M's and a leftover partial bag of mini chocolate chips.  I still added the oil and vanilla and baked for 10 minutes - they were wonderful and very festive looking.  I also realized how important it is to leave the cookies on the cookie sheet for a full 5 minutes after taking them out of the oven and before transferring them to a cooling rack.  Do not get anxious and skip this step!

Good place to start but I should have read the reviews. I like that this recipe used butter rather than oil and I made it as directed In this recipe.  The cookies did turn out very cakey.  Not bad if you just need a fix for a sweet tooth and aren't too picky about the texture.

It’s 3 stars because I was not impressed. It was easy and quick but even my kids didn’t gobble them up. I made it with a chocolate cake mix and white chocolate chips. I may try it again using a butter cake mix. But I won’t ever do the chocolate again. I even added vanilla and 2 tbsp oil as many suggested so if that made it better than I’m glad I added them:|

I also added 2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil and 1 Teaspoon of vanilla, and these are so awesome!  I always use Betty Crocker Super Moist Triple Chocolate Fudge cake mix, and my usually “only-regular-full-ingredient chocolate chip cookie” husband LOVES them.  He didn’t know they were a cake mix cookie till after I received his review :) 

They also definitely need to be baked for at least 8 minutes, and rest for 5 on the cookie sheet, so don’t try to rush anything!

Hi all.  These cookies are awesome. I made them last night for my 2 y old grandson and he was eating them hand over fist. I have read in some reviews that they added oil and vanilla. Not sure why. It doesn’t need it.  I used yellow cake mix and chocolate chips.  To one review I read not sure how it failed for you  coukdnit have been the 88 cent mix. Use the better mixes like pillsbury or Duncan Hines Betty Crocker.  I can’t wait to try more.

Delicious!!  So easy the youngest of kids can help. Hubby is diabetic so I used sugar free devils food cake mix and sugar free chocolate chips. I do recommend blending ingredients with a fork, my hand mixer couldn’t quite cut through the butter. Will definitely make again!

I added 2 T. Oil and 1t vanilla. My cake mix was 15.25 ounces so I added mix to get to the quantity called for. My cookies were a little crumbly and didn't spread well on the cookie sheet.

Only added a stick of butter & the two eggs. Chocolate & Reese peanut butter chips, strawberry & mini chocolate chips & white with sprinkles dipped in sugar. They're pretty good & easy, just stirred them up with a wooden spoon. I used silicon baking mats & it took 10 minutes to cook them.

I had some leftover chocolate frosting and was looking for something different to do with a devil's food cake mix.  This recipe was a great idea!  I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil instead of butter, added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of baking soda.  Also mixed in  toasted pecans to half of the batter.  Baked at 350 for 9 min. The cookies came out great, crispy around the edges and soft in the middle. Sprinkled toasted pecans on top of half, sprinkles on the other half.

This is the second time I made these cookies. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The cookies were good but came out puffy and tasted more like a brownie. This time I used Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate cake mix and as 1 reviewer suggested only one and half eggs. Since I was short on butter I used 1/4c of butter and 1/4c of lard. I creamed the butter and lard together and then added the egg, mixed thoroughly and then added in the cake mix and chocolate chips. The batter was fairly stiff and had to finish mixing with my hand to get everything incorporated.  I dropped by spoonful on a heavy baking sheet and baked for 9 minutes. The cookies came out perfect! Crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the center. They are really the best and super easy to make and easy on the budget!

This is very easy and versatile cookie recipe that lets you whip up some chewy, soft and yummy tasting cookies! On a trail basis,I had used a box of German chocolate cake mix with a cup of flaked coconut to use up. I added that along with 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of coconut oil, as suggested by other reviewers otherwise, I followed the rest of the recipe as directed. These cookies lasted 1 day in my house! I plan on making these again with a double fudge cake mix and make mini Whoopi pies with a brown butter filling. The possibilities are endless!

these are dangerously good. I added salted caramel chips and SKOR bits because I had them handy. Amazing! Definitely let them cool completely so they stick together.

This made awesome cookies I love them. I definitely will be using this method for many more cake cookies in the future. I've used this one twice now. The first batch I used devil's food cake mix and 1 cup milk chocolate morsals. They turned out devine but don't stack them together after cooling as they stuck together lol ooops. The second batch I used strawberry with pudding in it cake mix the 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 cup of a mix of white chocolate, milk chocolate and mini semi sweet morsals. Turned out beautiful and my daughter calls them unicorn cookies. Both batches made about 36 cookies using a 2 tablespoon scoop and baked for 12-15 minutes. Happy Baking.

One of the other reviews suggested adding oil and vanilla, so I did too.  They came out perfect!  I am now considering adding spices that are used in Italian meatball cookies to see how they turn out. Thank you for the inspiration.

I made cookie bars with the same recipe (using a 13 x 9 glass dish) only increased baking time to 18 minutes.  So easy and delicious.   For less sugar, I used the dark chocolate Betty Crocker cake mix and dark chocolate chips.

Followed recipe as stated and added 1 t of vanilla and 2 T of oil as other reviewers suggested. Sticky dough was a little difficult to deal with. They were excellent! Received lots of compliments! They were very moist and had a slight crunch on the edges. Pull them out when they are just set and leave on hot pan to cool for several minutes. YUMM! Will definitely make again!

These are 5 star ease, 4 star tasty.  I did use 1/4 cup corn oil and 1/4 cup butter and added 1/2 cup each of chopped pecans and chocolate chips, plus 1 Tbsp water to get dough consistency right for "drop and bake".  We ate them in 1 day!

I use No Name brand for the cake mix, it's less than 517grams, so I add from another box.
This recipe is so versatile, you can change the topping with whatever you like. My favorite is i change the butter with coconut oil, and the chocolate chip with shredded coconut. I also like to use chopped nuts and cheese, it's my second favorite.

I just made a batch of these to take to work.  I didn't feel like looking for my usual cake mix cookie recipe and this may be my new favorite.They are so quick and easy. I used a carrot cake mix,  added a tsp of oil per many recommendations, 1 grated carrot,  and white chips.

Awesome recipe. I made it with strawberry cake mix and they turned out great. My bake time was 10 mins. They were too soft at 8 mins but that could be my oven. This is definitely a keeper recipe!

I will have to cook mine longer (5-10 minutes), as at 10 minutes they came out soft.  Having cooled them completely, they were still too soft.  That makes me believe that they are under-cooked.  Maybe they're not.  Maybe that's how they're supposed to be.  Still makes me uncomfortable.

After reading way too many reviews I told myself to just do it!  I used a 15.25 oz yellow cake mix,  2 eggs, melted the butter, added the 2T canola oil along with 1t vanilla. Mixed by hand and threw in 1/2c chopped pecans. Rolled in cinnamon sugar mix and baked 10 mins. WOW! Instant Snickerdoodles, and loved the addition of the nuts. Just try  any variation you think of. Totally worth trying.

This recipe makes great cookies!!

I tried to reduce the butter, but as I was mixing it it seemed too dry, so I ended up keeping it at a full stick. Adding the 2T oil & 1t vanilla seemed to be an important addition to this recipe, because they turned out great this way.  One reviewer said to reduce the recipe by one egg white, but I used 2 large eggs and my cookies both held together well and were soft and chewy.  I do agree with the reviewer who said to flatten out your dough balls just a bit, and if possible refrigerate your dough balls a little bit before baking. I did one batch room temp and another 15 minutes of refrigeration after forming teaspoon balls, and they both turned out great but the refrigerated dough cookies were a bit prettier -- more perfectly round. 

I used Immaculate brand all-natural chocolate cake mix, Kerrygold grass-fed unsalted butter, organic Canola oil, and Trader Joes bourbon-based vanilla.  I topped my cookies with chopped walnuts, which for this recipe I think topping the cookies will work better than mix-ins. 

Really great cookies. I'm going to keep this on my short list.

I've tried a few different cake mix cookies and they always just tasted like cake. The recipes I used always called for oil so I thought I'd give this one a try since it didn't call for it!  I used a lemon cake mix with white chocolate chips. They turned out great! Even the boyfriend loved them and he normally despises these cake mix cookies!

Yum! great recipe! I will definitely make this over and over again. I used Duncan Hines devil's food cake mix, added the two tablespoons of vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon of vanilla as suggested by other reviewers. I also wanted them extra chocolatey, so I added 1/8 cup of cocoa powder + 1/8 cup of brown sugar. They were super chocolatey and with M&M's and chocolate chips thrown in, they were definitely a hit in this house and with the friends who were lucky enough to get before all the cookies disappeared. 350° for 10 minutes in my convection oven, made 36 small-cookie-scoop-size cookies.

My brownie mix was 18.3 ounces so I added and extra 1/4 cup of flour for a total of 1/2 cup and  I was out of oil so I used melted butter.   Adjusted the baking time to 10 minutes.  They came out perfect.

Easy and delicious.whole process done in 1/2 hour.Didn't alter recipe much, just a tad less oil and added butterscotch and chocolate chips.Baked for 12 mins,which was perfect for my oven. Can't believe I havn't tried this before.So many possibilities with different flavored cakes. Will definately make and use this recipe alot!!! I have a feeling some of my old cookie recipes will be staying in my recipe box unused as many are time consuming This is for you if you want a delicious cookie that is super quick

Great, very rich chocolate cookies.  Let the butter and eggs comes to room temperature.  The butter must be very soft.  I added 2 tsp. of oil, 1 tsp of vanilla, and the chocolate chips.  I also frosted about 1 or 2 minutes after they came out of the oven.  1 can of frosting barely covered to boxes of cookies.  I cooked 8 minutes.

They are amazing! Fluffy and a hit with the cookie monster... 
I did make a few changes. I added 1 TBSP vanilla, 1 TBSP veg. oil. And a dash of 1% milk. The batter was too thick otherwise. 
I used a Dunkin Hines pink cake mix. And with the chocolate chips they would be amazing for Valentines Day. 
I saw some reviews that they were too much like a cake. And well, it's a cake mix and cookie recipe.... It's gonna be fluffy and airy like a moist cake. If you're expecting a crumbly cookie, this isn't it.

I used Betty Crocker chocolate fudge cake mix and baked the cookies for about 12 minutes and they turned out perfect, I was kind of worried at first because the batter was very hard to mix and I was worried there wasn't enough wet ingredients but they turned out delicious! Definitely making these again!!

I used 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp of oil instead of butter, 2 beaten eggs and 1 tsp of vanilla. 
My add-ins were 1/2 cup each of butterscotch chips, sunflower seeds and raisins . They came out very well . Thanks to whoever said not to overmix.

I took the suggestions of others and added 2 T of vegetable oil and 1 tsp vanilla.  Also, I melted the butter rather than just softened it (made stirring it up by hand easier).  I used a white cake mix and added milk chocolate chips and they were DELICIOUS!  I have also used chocolate cake mix with white chocolate chips - equally good! The most important thing is to not over cook them. I found in my oven that 8 minutes and 10 seconds is the perfect amount of time. Any more and they aren't as chewy-gooey and good... Every oven is different so keep a close eye!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe, even though I did make a few alterations. In my cookies I added 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and for the chocolate chips, I did 2/3 semisweet and 1/3 white. These cookies will make a statement at any get together!

Followed other reviews and added 2T of oil.  Very quick and easy cookie, with very few ingredients needed.  They were a little too sweet for my taste, but my children loved them.  i used a tbs for my scoop, and they were perfect size.

Great cookie.. made exactly like directions above with Devil's Food but had to bake for 14 min.  2nd batch made with 2T oil and 1t vanilla to French Vanilla cake mix and turned out just as awesome.  Both ways are fine with me and boys in my house loved them. Next time will make different flavor variations. This one is a keeper!!!

I only had a 16 and some oz. box mix and forgot to add the chips. They were soft and delicious. Had to cook for 12 or so minutes. I will try these again with different boxes.

I make this recipe all the time with different cake mix flavors.  Instead of using butter, I use 1/3 cup of canola oil.  I bake for 6 minutes then start checking (You don't want these to overcook.) Mine are usually ready at 8 minutes. Let them cool on the cookie sheet ( I use a silpat) -they will continue to cook a little bit this way. Combo's that work for me:  Yellow cake w/choc. chips, chocolate cake w/walnuts or white choc chips, cherry chip cake is a winner with no additions, or funfetti with no additions.  Try a spice cake with raisins and instant oats for an oatmeal raisin cookie.  Everyone who tries these loves them!

I also added about a tablespoon of canola oil and about a teaspoon of vanilla. I used the medium sized scoop from PC, and baked these whoppers for twenty minutes. BIG HIT! I used a red velvet cake mix and put cream cheese frosting on the cooled cookies. YUM! Thanks!!

Perfect recipe to make with your little ones! I used white cake mix bc it's what I had on hand, but wanted choco cookies so added 1 1/2 T cocoa powder. I followed suite from the reviewers and added 2 T veggie oil.  Also added about 1 T almond extract and some left over mini m&ms.  The kids and I rolled them into tiny balls which ended up making the perfect kid sized cookie!  Sprinkled with powdered sugar and nestle quick mixe together.  YUM!

Perfect! **Remember to check your box of cake mix! Mine was smaller than the recipe called for so I added flour to make it 18.25 ounces. Other than that I mixed in softened butter first by using a pastry cutter. Then added the rest of the ingredients. I did add 2 Tbs oil and 1 tsp vanilla like others suggested. Will make again!

It was easy, but just okay.  If you love a super soft cookie, this is for you.  I like my cookies a little crispier.

These are delicious cookies! I would reccomend adding 2 t. oil, 1 tbsp vanilla extract, and I would say cook for a little bit longer, because of the extra liquid added. Altogether, this is one outstanding cookie!

I made these for a Cookie Exchange and barely had enough to bring after the kids (and I) started taste-testing!
I used Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge cake mix and added 2T oil and 1t vanilla, as suggested by other reviewers. Instead of chips, I chopped up 1 (3.5 oz) bar of Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark. I baked for 11 minutes. By doubling the recipe, I got the 6 dozen needed for the exchange, plus a few extras for home. They turned out a bit flat after cooling, but moist and DELICIOUS! A big hit!

These were awesome!  I tweaked a bit with the suggestion of using the oil instead of butter & 1 egg plus one yolk.  I added a Tbsp of cocoa, a Tbsp of 'sea-salt chocolate sauce', half a cup of sliced almonds and only half the chocolate chips.  You would NEVER know these came from a cake mix! The dough was stiff but I worked it by hand then rolled into a log with waxed paper and sliced off the cookies.  I got 32 cookies out of it and they were absolutely BEAUTIFUL and chocolatey!  Mmmmm...thanks for the recipe and tips!

I just made these & naturally I didn't read the instructions correctly & after reading the reviews about adding 2tbsp. oil & 1 of vanilla, I didn't add the butter the recipe called for. And I added a bag of chocolate & peanut butter chips & also a half tsp. of cocoa powder & omitted one egg white & they turned out excellent! Even my husband said they were good & that means something when he thinks something I baked taste good...LOL. I never bake cookies because I'm terrible at it but needed these to take to a wedding & I'm so glad I found this recipe.

Easy, simple, super quick.  They were so soft and delicious.  Usually after the cookies cools it gets somewhat harder but not these, the next day they were still soft like they had just come out of the oven.  Just found a new time saving desert, they come out perfect everytime.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first time making cake mix cookies and it was delicious! It was very moist and fluffy which I enjoyed thoroughly. I made a batch with m&ms and a batch with cranberries and almonds. Both were delicious and a hit as refreshments for an event I put on last week! I'll be sure to making these more often! :)

Very nice cookie. We used butter pecan cake mix with milk chocolate chips. Yum. I added 1tsp vanilla, and 2 tsp oil as others have suggested and it worked well for me. I also checked them at 10 min. and kept a close eye on them. Will make these again for sure.

YUM!  I made it just as written with a Duncan Heinz devils food mix, using 1/2 c. grapeseed oil and 1 c. white chocolate chips.  The dough was really greasy, but the final cookie was really good.  I only baked them 8min and they turned out perfectly soft.  Maybe almost a little too sweet with the white chips.  Next time I'll try the lesser amount of oil and adding vanilla mentioned by other reviewers.  This was an easy, quick and tasty recipe!

ok, i just tried this recipe. WOW, REALLY EASY AND QUICK!!! As a mother of three i do not have much time so i look for the simplest and fastest recipes. I used Betty Crocker's Golden Vanilla cake mix and as others sugested i added some vegetable oil (1tbsp). it took about 10-11 minutes to get the golden colour around the edges and i got 3 dozen of DELICIOUS  cookies. this is surely going to be one recipe that  i will use frequently!!!!THANK YOU!!!!!!

I have made these before but today when I needed to make these in a pinch (a group my daughter's friends came over) I had to improvise a bit.  I only had one egg!  So I used the 1/2 c butter, one egg and then used 1/4c (just slightly more) of applesauce. I didn't even have apple sauce around, but I DID have apples.... so I sliced 2 apples,sprinkled with a bit of sugar and cinnamon and cooked in the microwave for a few minutes.  I mashed those, added to the rest of the ingredients and viola... I had great cookies for the kids!  I love this recipe cuz it is so easy!  (and **usually** have the ingredients around to make at any time!

These were good. Tasted like a brownie not a cookie, which I suppose should be expected. Simple and Easy. I prefer brownies because you can sink your teeth into them but that's just me. Everyone else LOVED them

This cookie is absolutely wonderful. I used 2T of oil & 1t of vanilla extract as others recommended. I baked them for way longer then 10 mins. At 10 mins they were way too soft and they fell apart when trying to move them off the pan. 20 mins was perfect! I stronly recommend for an easy & delicious cookie recipe!!

This recipe was super easy and great if you're short on time. Of course, they aren't quite as good as made from scratch cookies...it's particularly noticeable in the texture of these cookies but I think that's acceptable seeing as how fast you can make them. I took the advice of others and added a little extra oil and vanilla and they turned out nice and soft.  Will use again!

Oh, Yum!  I made two flavors of these and I keep picking at them to decide which I like better!! They are very different, but equally delicious.  I am using these as treats in the hotel welcome bags for our wedding.    I used Betty Crocker yellow cake and added about 2 cups of prepackaged dried fruit (mango, cranberry, golden raisin mix).    I used Betty Crocker devils food mix and a little less than 2 cups of white chocolate chips.    I also added 2 T vegetable oil and 1 t. vanilla.   Thanks for the easy, delicious recipe.  Can't wait to try lemon ones. :)

With the oil and vanilla addition recommended by other reviewers this is an awesome, quick, and tasty cookie recipe! I used Devil's Food Cake mix and they were fudgy like brownies.

I used actual browny mix instead of cake mix and all the suggestions the others provided (like 2 teaspoons of oil/ teaspoon of vanilla) and I guess if you use browny mix you're going to get brownies. They're ok  but I know next time i'm going to follow the recipe to the E because I wanted cookies not brownies, but no complains:)

Great recipe.  I used a triple chocolate cake mix and made them into ice cream sandwiches.  I added the 2 T oil like suggested and the cookies spread more than I wanted making them a little flat which was fine since they were used for sandwiches.  But, I think that next time I'm going to try it without the extra oil.

These are GREAT! Slightly chewy on the outside and very moist inside, they literally melt in your mouth. And they are SO EASY! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was PERFECT- wouldn't change a thing! Next time though, I might add chopped up Andes mints just to mix it up a bit. I will make these often!!

Very yummy and super easy cookie recipe! I added chopped pecans instead of chocolate chips. Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 peanut oil, plus added 1/4 c brown sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. Rich, soft, and deliciious!  Where's the milk?  NOM NOM NOM

Very easy and moist. I also added the extra oil and the cookies turned out perfectly. The options are many as far as add-ins (nuts, cranberries, raisins etc with different cake mixes). This recipe is a keeper.

These turned out great - I followed everyone's advice and added 2 tbsp of oil, and the cookies turned out really moist.  I also used a white cake mix and reese's pieces instead of chocolate chips (taking them to a function where there some people who don't like chocolate - yeah, they exist).  They came out wonderful!   This is a fantastic versatile recipe - and SO easy.

I used Duncan Hines fudge brownie mix (family size 19.8 oz).  Added 2T softened butter and 1/4c. oil in lieu of 1/2 c butter.  I also used 1t. vanilla as recommended.  So yummy.

Made this with strawberry cake mix + the chocolate chips.  I added maybe a T of oil when it was challenging to mix,  but I probably would have been fine without it.  Bakes up well in 8 minutes, the cookies spread just the right amount :)  I try to avoid using mixes in general, but this was super easy + delicious!

Yummy.  We made this with only 1 egg, and they were delicious--the right balance between cake and cookie.  Soooo good fresh out of the oven.

I made these with a devil's food mix and butterscotch chips and had my 3 and 4 year old help.  Super easy and delicious.  I also took the recommendation of others and added 2T canola oil and 1t vanilla. I used a scoop and got 40 cookies out of the batter.  I will definitely be making these again. Super kid friendly and oh-so-easy!  Thank you, Kristi!

These are probably the best cake mix cookies. They go a little flat because of the butter, but it's that very butter that gives them a richer flavor than the ones made w/oil.

I chose to make these cookies with a Pillsbury Moist Supreme Strawberry cake mix.  I followed the rest of the recipe but added 2 Tbs. of oil and 1 tsp. vanilla, as suggested.  For me the recipe made 2 1/2 dozen and cooked for 11 min.  The  bottoms of the cookies turned slightly golden while the tops of the cookies remained pink, sprinkled with chocolate chips.  I wanted to try something different and these actually taste quite yummy.  Mostly soft with a crispy bottom.  My kids really enjoyed them.  Next time we will try them with a chocolate cake mix.  Quick and easy, thanks!

these were fabulous! I liked them better than cookies made from cookie mixes!  I used a Duncah Hines fudge cake mix and added 1tbsp of oil and a handful of milk chocolate chips.  They took a little bit longer to cook (more like 12- 15 minutes)...just watch for the crackling and you know they're about done.  Thanks!  SUPERB.

I added 2T oil and 1 tsp vanilla extract as has been suggested, and the cookies were nice and soft when they came out of the oven, but hardened completely within a few hours. Now, personally, I have no problem with a crispy cookie, but based on the other reviews, I think they were supposed to remain soft. So now I am left wondering whether they are crispy or just plain dry! (The flavor is very good though).

These are AMAZING! I live at a high altitude (above 6000ft) and usually have to make cookies from scratch and then add and subtract ingredients. Cookies are usually moist for a day, but then harden the next day. These, though, are so moist, chewy and downright YUMMY!!! I made the recipe AS IS. This is one of my favorite new recipes, and so simple! Thank you so much for sharing! I used dark chocolate cake mix this time with dark chocolate chips, but look forward to trying this with strawberry cake mix in the very near future!

I thought these were excellent. I did what others suggested and added about 2 tbsp of veggie oil. My boyfriend and I made giant monster cookies (we came out with about 20 of them from the batter) and left them in for 9 minutes, then let them cool on the sheet and they turned out perfect. Nice and soft, but not so soft that they fall apart before they reach your mouth. This was so easy, I'll definitely make it again, and may even try other cake mixes.

These cookies were it....truly amazing.  Following the recomendations of previous reviewers I made the cookies by doing the following:  1 Bx. Devil's Food Cake Mix, 1/2 cup no cholesterol vegetable oil, 2 medium eggs, Milk Chocolate Chips, & crushed walnuts.  Every thing was mixed together and placed on parchment paper.  10 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees was perfect.  My hubby says this is the perfect way to make gourmet cookies.  Thanks for posting.

As other reviewers suggested, I also added 2 Tablespoons of oil and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I used a gingerbread cake mix and 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips. The texture is perfect, exactly what I wanted.

pillsbury > betty crocker. i followed the recipe as exact and they turned out pretty good. i felt they were overwhelmingly sweet, but that's just me! everyone else loves them. they are more cake feeling but the way i see it is: it's the softness of a cake, hardness of a cookie -- hopefully that made sense :P

What an easy and versatile recipe, not to mention inexpensive.  This holiday season, I've made spice cookies with craisins and walnuts, chocolate with mint & dark chocolate chips, white with red and green m&m's, red velvet with white chocolate chips, and my favorite - yellow with chocolate chips.  They're so moist and delicious, that I'm having trouble keeping enough around to give to others - we keep devouring them!

** A tip - before handling the dough, spray your hands with cooking spray - this way, the dough won't stick to your hands.  You'll have to reapply the spray quite often though, because this dough is very sticky!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, I followed the recipe exactly and the batter/dough was very sticky and really hard to work with.  However, the cookies were very good and in one batch I added coconut which I really liked.

Wow!  These delivered super moist, chewy cookies.  I used a spice cake mix, substituted the butter with 3/4 C pumpkin puree (may explain why they are super soft, but I like them like that!), and omitted the chocolate chips.  I topped the cookies with a bit of cream cheese frosting (from this site) that I thinned with some milk.  Super easy and super delicious - I will definitely be making these often!

PHENOMENAL!!!  I followed the advice of others and added 2 TBS of oil & 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  I made 3 different batches, one with Devil's Food cake mix, another with butter yellow cake mix, and the last with butter pecan cake mix.  All were fantastic.  I got TONS of compliments on them (I brought them to my hubby's work) and made them again the same week just to have more for ourselves at home.  Both the chocolate and yellow took exactly 8 minutes to cook, the butter pecan took about 10.  I will never make another cookie again, this was way to simple and way to good to waste my time with anything else!

This worked great and was very easy! I added the oil and vanilla and flattened them a bit as suggested by other reviewers. I didn't have a cake mix but had a chocolate chip muffin mix so used that without adding extra chocolate chips and baked for 10 minutes. Made 28 small cookies.

I made a cookie tray for my son's graduation and these were a hit.  I changed the original recipe and followed viewers suggestions and added 2 T Vege oil and 1 tsp vanilla.  I also added Andes Mints instead of the semisweet chocoate chips.

yummy! these are really good, kind of any easy version of the chocolate crackles my mom makes. I did add the suggested 2 tbsp of canola oil and 1 tsp vanilla. I also tried both rolling them in powedered sugar and sifting p.sugar after they were done baking, both turned out great tasting.

Great recipe.  I added 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon water.  I added the chocolate chips and marshmellows to one batch. The second batch I added walnuts.  This is the easy way of making cookies in a hurry.  Will do them again.

This is a good basic recipe - there are many variations.  My grandson likes to make snikerdoodles with white or yellow cake mix and roll the balls in cinnamon & sugar.  Because the cake mix is real sweet, I mix the cinnamon 50/50 with sugar.

These were GREAT! The batter is kind of difficult to mix at first. I would suggest mixing the eggs, butter, reviewer suggested 2T of oil and 1tsp butter together first so the dry ingredients get wet faster. Overall, it was incredible. Kids able to help, which was a plus for them.

I followed the basic recipe as written.  We made these in a kids cooking class that I teach and they were delicious!  We made several variations: chocolate cake mix with peanut butter chips, yellow butter cake mix with mini M&Ms, yellow butter cake mix rolled in cinnamon/sugar, and my favorite... yellow butter cake mix rolled in peppermint candy sprinkles.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe and I love that you can customize it to suit your tastes.  Very versatile.

Instead of butter, I mixed 1/3 C oil into a box of milk chocolate mix, vanilla, dash of instant espresso powder, eggs, crushed Heath bars and a handful of pecans. Refrigerated the dough overnight and was able to form stiff balls before baking. Crusty outsides with soft, tender insides. Will make again when too lazy to bake from scratch.   Update: While just okay warm or at room temp, these cookies taste amazing frozen! Chewy and crunchy with the pecans and toffee. Perfect summer treat.

I made these for a group from my church going on a mission trip.  All I heard about was how good the cookies are!  I used Pillsbury Moist Supreme cake mix (the one that has pudding in the mix).  I made some with the Devil's food mix, and also the Classic Yellow*.  I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla.  They said these were the best cookies they ever had.  *I also use this cake mix to make the Self-Filled cupcake recipe that you'll find here on All Recipes.  Those are always a big hit too!

Pretty good if you need a cookie in a hurry. We used red velvet cake mix and added 1/2 cup white chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  I used 1/2 TBL oil and 1 TSP vanilla. Consistency was fine, minimal spreading of cookies during baking.

I used these using a cinnamon swirl cake I had in the cabinet. They are the easiest cookies. I dont like crunchy cookies and they are soft and ooie-gooie. I did add the suggestions of oil and vanilla. They took about 10mins.

Turned out really good.  I also added the oil and vanilla as suggested.  I baked for 9 minutes and I probably should have gone for 10.  I think they are still a little too soft in the middle for my liking, but I'm sure my husband will gobble them up when he gets home.  I will definitely try again with another flavor cake mix.

i thought these were great... i did only use one egg both times i've used this recipe to avoid the cookies being too cake like as some other reviewers have mentioned (and i dont think its neccessary to add any oil or vanilla flavoring to add moisture... if you mix the ingredients with your hands it has the perfect consisitancy, not too dry and moist enough to be just a TINY bit sticky, and wont make your cookies flatten out so much when you put them in the oven). the first time i made this i used a betty crocker triple chocolate fudge cake mix that already had mini chocolate chips added in the box. the second time i used a betty crocker lemon cake mix and didnt add any chips or anything to the mix. both times i shaped the mix into balls (about 1 inch thick) with my hands and rolled them in sugar before baking which make 50 cookies per box. i also used a dark non-stick pan (sprayed with pam!), so i baked my cookies at 325 degrees for 10 minutes. both times the cookies came out wonderful. this recipe is so easy, and the cookies come out very tasty! i'll be using this recipe several times over again w/ all sorts of cake mixes, thank you!

These are the best cookies! I put a Tablespoon of vegetable oil in while mixing, it keeps the cookies moist! I also use Milk Chocolate chips chopped up in small pieces & whole chips on the top of each cookie. I recommend this recipe to everyone!

I tried the 1 tbls of oil like others suggested, but i don't think it was necessary. My cookies were a little too soft and a little too flat. I think these would taste better with white or milk chips in my opinion. I also tried pressing them down a little, but it wasn't necessary. These are definitely more like brownie cookies.

I made these cookies for myself because I am the only person in our home that likes chocolate but somehow I only got a few!  My hubby and his crew ate them in no time and asked when I was going to make more.  I took the suggestion of adding vanilla and oil but the oil made them too wet.  Next time I won't add the oil.

So good!  I took the advise and added 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp veg oil.  Also did 1/2 cup chocolate chips and a 1/2 cup butterscotch chips.  The 8 minute version was tastier than the 9 minute version.

Yes this recipe was fast and easy to make, but the time they are in the oven needs to change. I put them in and set my timer and I came back to my stove smoking and my smoke alarm goin off. I just wasted all those ingredients for burnt cookies. Not sure if I will try these again.

These are so great!! I did two different types: strawberry mix & devils food mix and used both white & semi sweet chocolate chips for both. They came out amaaaaazzzziiing! I also used the vanilla and oil as suggested. The only problem I had was when I used my pampered chef stone....they spread too much and fell apart. I can't really use that dozen. :-( You must try this easy delicious recipe!!!!

Super easy, very yummy.  I used Betty Crocker Dark Chocolate cake mix.  They sort of reminded me of oreos so then I found a nice buttercream recipe on allrecipes and filled the cookies for sandwich cookies....better than oreos!!!

I used a Dr. Oetker Organic Marble cake mix with coconut butter and 2 eggs.  I did add 1 tbsp extra virgin light olive oil since it was dry as a bone when mixed.  The kids seem to like these, but I do not.  I am not a cake fan at all, and thought this might be a way to have a good use for a cake mix.  I will not be making these again.  I just found they taste too salty for me.  I will take the time to make cookies the old fashioned way.  This one was just not for me.  Simple and easy just not the thing.

Like many users I also added 2T of vegetable oil and 1tsp of vanilla. I also substituted the butter with 1/2 c. applesauce since I have to watch what I eat most of the time. These were really good, really really moist too! I'll probably go back and try them again following the directions exactly, just to see what the end result is. These are excellent!

So good! I love the versatility of this recipe. I use this recipe as a base to make my "hot cocoa" cookies. I add a little vanilla and fresh coffee to highlight the chocolate, along with other ingredients. Great for dessert or even a bake sale.

easy, fast, yummy for a soft cookie. I drizzle chocolate on the top and it makes it a prettier cookie. I did add the vanilla and oil as suggested by other reviewers. Thanks for an easy cookie!

Very easy and tasty.  To get a better shape and thicness, I refrigerated the batter for a couple hours before baking.  When placed on the sheet in balls, they pouffed up while baking then dropped to a nice thickness when removed from the oven.  I did one batch without refrigeration, and they spread too thin and broke easily.  Like others suggested, I added 2 T oil and 1 t vanilla.  I used Devils food cake mix and white chocolate chips.

I have made these many times and am ALWAYS told they are the best cookies ever tasted. I've made them as chocolate chip cookies AND as sugar cookies. For sugar cookies, I simply omit the chocolate chips and frost them with tub frosting. DELICIOUS!

This is a good cookie considering how easy it is to make. They turned out very soft, so you might really like them if you are a soft-cookie person. I used Devil's Food Cake mix and white chocolate chips. I baked them for 11 minutes each, and they turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

I used Betty Crocker Triple Chocolate Fudge and peanut butter chips. I only had unsalted butter, but I don't think that really mattered. These are better than the cake mix cookie recipes that call for oil. I think the butter makes it better.

If you like brownies, then this is your cookie! I always use Devil's Food cake mix (Betty Crocker is the ONLY brand I'll buy) and Nestle chocolate chips. I followed this simple recipe exactly and had some bangin' cookies. They taste better after they cool.

Yum, yum, yum!  This recipe makes really delicious and perfectly round cookies.  I added 2 T oil and 1 tsp vanilla as others suggested.  I'm looking forward to trying different cake mixes, soon.

The only reason I gave them two stars was because they were easy, probabaly too easy to be true. These cookies were not good at all.  I wasted good plump pecans on this recipe. Cake mix isn't sweet, so the cookies weren't sweet at all.  They were too cake like and the color was off, kind of grayish.  I won't make these again...

Very good cookie! I loved the simplicity! Extremely easy, slightly crunchy on outside and very moist and fudgy in the center. I did not try making as original but did add the 2 T veg oil and 1 tsp vanilla as other reviewers suggested. The only negative thing I can say about these cookies is that they are very flat. But the taste and texture is very good. I will definitely make this again.

I absolutely love this recipe, and I have tried them all kinds of ways. Our personal favorite is probably strawberry cake mix with chocolate chips, though the chocolate cake mix with butterscotch chips are a close second! I followed others suggestions about adding a little oil and vanilla extract, and they're much less sticky that way. I also experimented with making them in muffin tins, which was a big hit. They need to cook a bit longer, and yield close to 2 dozen. These are a regular treat out of my kitchen!

These were excellent.  Followed the instructions (other than adding the vanilla as others suggested) and they were scrumptious!  I feel bad because I didn't leave any for my son:(, but I couldn't help myself.  I don't really know if the vanilla actually made a difference.  Next time I will make it without.  We made some with peanut butter chips and some with white chocolate chips.  We found the peanut butter chips a little over powering.  This is a keeper.

I made these cookies for a bake sale at school and they sold out very quickly! I took other reviewers' advice and added the 2 T oil--made the cookies very soft and chewy. I used devil's food and white chocolate chips. The ultimate test was when my boyfriend ate one and immediately had a smile on his face.  This recipe is a keeper!

Next I am going to try using a spice cake mix with walnuts and raisins, maybe with some cream cheese frosting.  This is a great base recipe for all us who love to bake but don't have the time.

I like this recipe because you can do so many versions of it. I read the other reviews regarding the use of 2 tbs oil and 1 tsp vanilla extract and decided to trust them and add the ingredients. The cookies came out very moist and I will try to do another batch w/o oil to see if it firms the cookies up. They were delicious and I am going to make some red velvet cookies with white chocolate chips for Valentine's Day.

Good recipe, but I guess I'm a bit of a cookie purist. These get points for looking great and tasting....Good. However I think i'll be going back to Chocolate Chocolate chip cookies 2 from the allrecipes website. These just didn't taste homemade. Glad I tried them though, if I ever get in a bind and need cookies fast this will be my go to recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Everytime I make these, they get devoured! I love how soft they are and how soft they stay! I got creative and tried different variations, they always taste awesome - the possibilities are endless! Vanilla cake mix with white chocolate chips, Chocolate cake mix with peanut butter chips, and so on! Excellent recipe!

My 7 year old son and I just made these cookies using triple chocolate fudge cake mix and heath toffee bits adding 2T of oil and 1t of vanilla as suggested by other reviews. I don't think Santa will have one bad thing to say about these cookies tonight. :)

These were very chocolately!  Followed recipe and turned out delicious!  Also made with strawberry cake mix and white chips and yellow cake mix and chocolate chips.  I would recommend NOT adding vegetable as this makes the cookies too greasy.

Very easy to make - the best tip is to know your elevation - you may need to add 1/2 cup of flour to the mix to insure full not flat cookies, also know your oven! those are the 2 most common mistakes people can make - I move around and visit alot of places so try one batch and then adjust by adding flour or changing the tempature of the oven

These cookies are amazing!! I don't even like chocolate cookies, but was asked to make some, so I decided to try this recipe. Well, they are absolutely delicious! I did add the 2T of oil and 1t of vanilla, which made them so moist and delicious. Once I put them on the cookie sheet, I just slightly flattened the tops...they came out perfectly crispy on the edges, and chewy in the centers. Just the right height, too. I can see that this recipe will become a cookie staple in my repertoire...next time, I'm going to add almond extract for that almond-raspberry taste! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very Easy recipe!  Worked out great, I didn't have any chocolate chips so I put walnuts and it was a nice moist cookie...It also wasn't too sweet.  It made it perfect to eat with coffee or milk.  Thainks!

OK YUM. Have made this a couple times now. Our favorite is to make it with white cake mix and use white chocolate chips, 1 tsp of  vanilla and 2 Tblsp of oil. Perfect every time. As soon as they come out of oven we dust them with fine grain sugar. SOO good!

This recipe is a pretty good starting place.  I was just looking for something quick to throw together at the last minute to take to a church potluck, and this fit the bill.  I used Betty Crocker milk chocolate cake mix, and I had several mix-ins in my pantry that I used.  I added white chocolate chips, dark chocolate chips, caramel chips, and toffee bits.  I also added about 2 Tbsp of canola oil.  The cookies look a little cakey and didn't really spread out at all, but they're delicious.  This is a really versatile recipe that you can use for a million different flavor combinations.

I used orange cake mix and chocolate chips for Halloween.  Very easy!  The orange cake batter was a little too artificial for me.

I really enjoyed this recipe, it was very easy and I love anything that comes out well with minimal effort. I would suggest that you be careful what kind of cake mix you use, because some of them have a more salty taste because they're supposed to "taste like butter" or have a dark chocolate flavor. If you taste your mix and it's a little salty, I would recommend either more brown sugar as suggested in the recipe, or using more chips (I definitely would not recommend cutting the amount of chips). I used a dark chocolate mix that was a little salty, so I used white chocolate to boost the sweet flavor and they came out very well. I also moved my baking rack up one to prevent the bottoms from burning. My cookies were crunchy when they came out of the oven. I was fine with that, but I stored them in a plastic container overnight and now they're soft and chewy.

These cookies were YUMMY!!!  I just got done making a batch.  They are so simple to make and come out soft and chewy, but not flat.  I added tbsp of veg. oil and 1/4 tsp. of vanilla as others mentioned.  I also added choc. chips and vanilla chips.  One batch made about 50 cookies.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are AWESOME!  I was looking for something different to do with cake mix and this was it!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the suggestion to add 2 tbsp oil which was a great suggestion.  These cookies came out moist and delicious.  I will definitely make them again.

The dough was extremely thick, so I couldn't stir in the chips. I ended up adding the chips to the outside/top of the cookies. They flattened out better than I thought they would, but they were still more dense than I personally like. Not the worst cookies ever.

These are L-O-V-E-L-Y! I'd been craving some chocolate cookies for a few days but didn't want a complicated recipe. I stumbled on this one this morning, got a pack of Devil's food mix and hey, presto! They're gorgeous, easy and quick. However, I forgot to put the choc chips in - don't ask me how!!! I can only imagine how wonderful they'll be when I do them right! And the house smelled delicious too!

I did not add any oil or vanilla, but made the recipe as written (except I had no chocolate chips) and my cookies still came out extremely moist and chewy and I cooked them for 10 minutes. I actually think I could've left them in the oven another minute or two.

This is a recipe I will be using for a long time! I made 2 seperate batches, one was devils food cake mix with Andes mint baking chips and the second was chocolate fudge cake mix with shredded coconut. I did not add oil as others suggested and they were perfectly moist. The mint ones were divine! The coconut ones however left something to be desired. I will definitely be making these for get togethers and so on in the near future. I look forward to taking this basic recipe and changing it up many different ways! Thanks!

I'm still learning how to make sure these cookies are cooked, but not burned. The timing is hard, but even when they are too mushy or a little overcooked, I can't stop eating them.  Absolutely delicious.  Try white chocolate chips instead of regular ones.

I couldn't believe how easy these were.  My youngest son kept telling me about these cake mix cookies that one of his friend's mom makes - now I know why he boasted about them!  This recipe is so easy, it only makes about 2 1/2 dozen which is perfect for my husband and I.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Used chocolate cake mike and peanut butter chocolate chips. I also made the recommended changes, adding vanilla and oil. I really didn't care too much for these. They didn't even taste much like cookies, more like a really dry brownie. However, my husband and toddler loved them (why I'm rating four stars instead of three).

I used a Milk Chocolate Cake Mix and added 2 tablespoons oil and 1 teaspoon vanilla. I baked them for 8 minutes and they came out just right. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe, but these were not that great.  They seemed kind of grainy.  Maybe it was the mix I bought, but I won't make these again.  I'd rather make them from scratch.  It may take a little more time, but worth it in the end.

I following the recipe, but used triple chocolate cake mix, added 2 T  oil, and approximately 1 1/2 cup shredded coconut.  These were excellent and a huge hit!!!  I think the coconut was the key to making these

These were so quick and easy. They were delicious. The first batch I made I flattened them out so they were a little more 'crisp' but the second batch I left a little more rounded and they were a little 'chewier' which we preferred. Great recipe and guaranteed to turn out.

I really doubted that these would come together with so few ingredients but they really came out great. I recommend these are in for the full 10 minutes. These are almost the consistency of brownies, but in a cookie shape.

Very tasty, moist, and chewy. The downfall is that they were flat. I followed a few different reviews, and used margarine instead of butter, added 2 Tbs of oil, 1tsp of vanilla, and 1/4c of dark brown sugar.

Golly, gee whiz, oh wow, these were delicious! Reading reviews I did add 1 tsp vanilla extract but I used a Betty Crocker Super Moist cake mix and decided NOT to use the oil; I'm glad I didn't. I also chilled the dough for about 30 minutes before dropping them on cookie sheets. It helped with the stickiness. I wound up with 40 cookies. These were very good! Thanks for the recipe. Will use this again!

GREAT recipe, I used a chocolate cake mix and once I flattened then a little I dropped them into cinnamon sugar before putting them on tray.  Turned out crispy on outside but lovely and soft on the inside.  I didn't use all the mix at one time so the left over, I rolled in baking paper and left in the fridge till the next day.
Would definately recommend and will definately be using this recipe again.

Amazing! Amazingly easy, used little ingredients & delicious!
I used Betty Crocker Super Moist Triple Choc. Fudge mix & mint chips, yummy!

I followed the recipe as well as added the recommended 2T oil (I used Canola) and 1t. vanilla extract. It was perfect! I put big spoonfuls of the dough on the baking sheet (making 24 3 in. cookies) and baked them for 11 min. in my pre-heated oven & they were perfect. No hard edges or overbaking!

These aren't as dense as typical cookies, a bit more airy & light. I could eat the whole batch! Thanks for this great keeper!

These cookies are so easy and taste great! I used peanut butter chips - yum - and mint chips another time - yum!
I added some vanilla extract to them. 

Don't be alarmed when the batter is super sticky and thick. That's just how it is and it will make a great cookie!

I just made these cookies.  I needed to use a bag of caramel chips that had reached their expiration date.  I added the extra 2T of oil and 1tsp vanilla.  The cookies spread out a bit more than I had hoped so next time I will try it without the extra oil & vanilla.  Also, next time I would use the recommended 1 cup of chips.  I HAD to use the whole 11 ounce bag of chips due to expiration and it really is too much, like eating candy more than a cookie.  Still the recipe was easy and I can see how it could work great with some tweaking.  I baked mine 12 minutes and used a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop.

I was out of flour and wanted to make cookies.  This was the first time to try the cake mix for it and was very skeptical.   I don't even like soft cookies and loved this as it looked like a cookie but was like eating a little brownie!  Not what I expected but so much more :)

Love this cookie!  As suggested by others, I added 2T oil and 1t vanilla, as well as one egg and one egg yolk.  All I had was a spice cake mix, so rather than using chocolate chips, I added 1C raisins and 1C chopped nuts.  I used a cookie scoop and mine cookies took 16 minutes per batch.  Could be my oven or the scoop.  Either way, they were really good!

Good stuff. I added 2 tbsp. organic coconut oil (Nutiva brand) and 1 tsp. vanilla. I used a stick of organic butter for the butter as well. I chose a devil's food cake mix. I didn't eat many of these because standard cake mix is horrible for you, but they were quite tasty. Cook for 8 minutes and then let sit on the pan for two minutes before putting on wire racks to cool the rest of the way.

Very good, quick, and easy. My two year old enjoyed helping me make these! I thought they turned out very soft and chewy just the way we like them. I used butter recipe yellow cake mix with chocolate/white chocolate swirl chips. Used 1/4 c. margarine, 1/8 c. canola oil, 1/8 c. shortening. I'll definitely be making these again when I need cookies on the quick.

I used red velvet cake mix because we made them around Valentine's day, kids loved them, but adults (including myself) thought they had a bit of an odd flavor. However, I'm not good at baking and these turned out, so that bumps this recipe up from being a 3-star.

A super easy and quick way to make cookies with little ones. My 3 and 5 year old both loved the fact that they could mix it all by themselves and I was not stressed out about remembering a list of ingrediants.  Used organic cake mix to cut back on some of the preservatives.  Will do again!

Very good for a fast chocolate cookie.  My 3yo helped me make them.  We got 32 cookies out of the batch.  I followed the suggestions to add 2T oil and a teaspoon of vanilla.  I'm thinking next time I will just use more butter, and double the vanilla.  Although mint extract might be good!

This recipe was such a big hit! I used a double fudge cake mix and followed the advice of others by adding the 2T oil and 1tsp vanilla. I also added a dash of salt because the mix was too sweet for my liking. I have a magic bullet which I love dearly and used it to grind up green mint m&m's to a powder which added a delectable taste and green specs in the chocolate color. I also tossed in a handful of mini chocolate chips. Everyone loved the taste and asked for another batch immediately!

My kids and I made these cookies on christmas eve and they were wonderful. We loved how quick and easy it was. We used both semi sweet chocolate chips and chopped walnuts oh yeah and we used what we had in the pantry, german chocalate cake mix. Great recipe.

These cookies turned out great!!  Moist and chewy.  I baked them for 8 minutes and they came out perfect!  I only changed one thing. I only had a little choco chips, so to a 1 cup measure I added white choco chips and peanut butter chips to make a full cup. Not only was it colorful but gave great flavor!  VERY GOOD!

I made this recipe with the additional oil as indicated by other reviewers and a pinch of salt.  I then added a 1/2 bag of York Peppermint Baking Pieces instead of choc chips. If you haven't used these yet they are wonderful.  There are about the size of a small button and are perfect for baking.  I also drizzled a little white chocolate over the cookies when they had cooled to make them look festive.  These cookies were so good my family could not keep their hands off of them.  Even my husband, who rarely eats cookies, was sneaking them off the plate.  So 2 thumbs up on this easy and wonderful recipe and please try it with the York Pattie chips!!  They are FANTASTIC!

These were very tasty.  I used some of the other tips and added 2 T of oil and 1 t of vanilla to the mixture.  I made one batch with devil's food cake mix and dark chocolate chips (a HUGE hit at the holiday party I took them to), and another batch made with red velvet cake mix with white chocolate chips, which were also delicious.  Good, easy to follow recipe with great results.

I tried this, and surprisingly didn't love it. I used to have an excellent Cake Mix Cookie recipe that may have spoiled me. :) I followed the recipe exactly in the beginning, but ended up adding oil when mixing. The cookies didn't end up being very smooth, and seemed a bit too thick. I want to try this recipe again, maybe with different mixes/additions.

This was allright!  I used a Butter Yellow cake mix and took others' advice and added 2 Tbls. oil and 1 tsp. vanilla, as well as a good sprinkle of kosher salt, thinking it might balance out the "too sweet" of the cake mix.  I had to use more than one measly cup of chocolate chips, though.  I like my cookies chock full of chips.  Everyone really likes these cookies and I like how easy they are.  Sometimes I just don't feel like the whole "from scratch" process.

Good soft brownie like cookie.  Added 2 tbs oil as reccomended below, and they were soft, but not too cake-y.  Will add white chocolate chips next time to mellow it out a little.  The plate was spinning at the office ... only one left - and that was mine.

these were pretty good.. i used a dark chocolate cake mix.. i didnt have any chocolate chips, but these were sweet enough without them.. i added 1/4 cup of brown sugar but then the mixture was too dry so i added just a little bit of milk.. turned out ok.. but very cakey (hence the name CAKE MIX COOKIES) =]

It is okay and like lots of people said, cakey. I added the extra vanilla and oil and varied my cooking time from 8-15 minutes in different batches and it still tasted cakey or undercooked. My boyfriend calls them cookcakes. I would rather just buy cookie mix or frozen cookie batter.

I thought these were not very good. I was asked for the recipe by a friend which is the reason for 3 stars.  I would only give 1 star.  They are easy but very runny.

My family loves these cookies and they are very easy to make. You can use any flavor of cake mix and add whatever goodies you want.

Sooo good! They're best right when they come out of the oven. However, they stay very moist and chewy even a couple of days after baking. My boyfriend loves them :)

WOW! This cookie is awesome! I used oil instead of butter, and added 1 tbsp of vanilla extract like most have done...My brother and my boyfriend gobble them up as soon as I put it in the cookie jar!

Moist, chocolatey cookie.  I added 2 tsp. oil and 1 tsp. vanilla. This recipe yielded 32 cookies and took 14 minutes to bake.  Quantity wise, I think the recipe would been more satisfying in cupcake form.

It's very good and super easy.  I also added two tablespoon oil, and they all came out nice and chewy.  Next time I'll add some nuts.

Recipe was too dry, would not incorporate all of the cake mix without additional liquids.   Did not use pudding mix, yet came out terribly doughy.

These were just way too sweet for my taste.  Even my sweet tooth husband and son didn't really like them.

Super easy & yummy! I baked these cookies for a party and everyone loved them.  My friends described the cookies as a combination of a cookie and a cupcake.

Made it with vanilla cake instead of chocolate.  My husband found them a bit dry but my kids loved them.

This is a great recipe! I have tried many variations, including adding one half cup coconut. It worked out very well. Thanks so much.
