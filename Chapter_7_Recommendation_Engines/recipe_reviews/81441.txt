Overall good recipe with a few adjustments. I read all the reviews and combined thier advice. I halved the recipe and made smaller patties, 10 in all. I also added diced red pepper, cilantro, green chiles, and chili powder. To the sour cream sauce, I added red pepper and cilantro to give it a nice color. Also I found that searing the patties made them stay togther better. And don't forget to microwave the sweet potato as stated

This is my all-time favorite meatless recipe. DO NOT pre-cook the yams; you don't want a mushy cake. DO brown very well (just don't burn them like I keep doing); the thinner you make them, the easier. It seems that the lack of flavor noted by others comes from UNDERCOOKING the patties. breadcrumbs, or gluten-free breadcrumbs. For a gluten-free version, I have used quinoa instead of **And here is how I ADORE the sour cream topping: leave out the jalapeno, add a generous sprinkling of salt and extra lime juice, as well as some of the lime ZEST! and garnish with, or mix in, chopped cilantro. No blandness here.

Very, very good.  Try these, they are worth it -- quick, good, and healthy.  Don't skip the lime sour cream -- it goes great with the cakes.  I microwaved the grated sweet potato for 1 minute before mixing in because I wasn't sure how well it cook in the broiler.  Watch the time -- it did not take as long for me as it says.

These were good, and I'll make them again. I shredded the sweet potato and made the sour cream topping the night before to save time. I followed the other suggestions and made these changes to the recipe: use 2 eggs in the bean mixture and also add to the basic recipe 1 can mild diced chilies, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp coriander. I also used 1Tbsp jarred chopped jalapenos instead of fresh and it was really mild so I'll add more next time. I'll also add some cilantro next time. This recipe made 18 patties (golf ball size when I scooped them out) which I flattened. I had to move the oven rack to the middle because they burned otherwise, and then I baked them for 7 min on one side and 4 on the other. They were good, but needed more spice. Also, next time I'm going to make them much thinner/flatter and add more salt & pepper (I only used 1/4 tsp of each).

I brought this to a very foodie (berkeley, CA) potluck party and it was the first dish gone. People loved it! I added about a 1/4c chopped red bell pepper and a small can of diced green chiles which i think was perfect. Also to the lime sour cream i added a bout a 1/2 tablespoon chopped cilantro and a couple tablespoons finely chopped red bell pepper for color.

WOW! These were amazing! I made these Friday night and by Saturday afternoon they were gone! My boyfriend and sister ate them all! I made a second batch Sunday and froze them so I could have them for my lunches. I also loved the sour cream mix, but my sister preferred salsa with it. I cooked them on the stove top, only because the second I turn on my broiler the fire alarm goes off :( I also followed others advice and used two eggs- they were perfectly moist! Aside from that I followed the recipe exactly. I'll be making these again!

I didn't have sweet potatoes in the house and these were still very good. I added more seasonings including chili powder and used whole wheat flour in lieu of the bread crumbs. Made a really nice, healthy lunch Christina and thank you!!

Love these! Modifications from others that are essential: microwave the shredded sweet potato first, two eggs, red bell pepper, chili powder, and definitely smaller cakes.

I also used an immersion blender to get the whole mixture more broken down. And most importantly, I was able to make good flat cakes that hold together with one simple trick: put them on the baking tray as balls, not flattened at all. Then, before you flip them to brown the other side, just use the spatula to smooth the ball down into a patty and flip. They are much more able to hold together as a patty when they are mostly cooked.

These were a surprise hit; we loved them!  The lime sour cream was the perfect accompaniment. I did not change anything and I did not precook the sweet potato and it did not need it.  I will use these as an appetizer and as a main course.  Kudos!

Really tasty, healthy recipe.  I did not pre-cook the sweet potatoes and they turned out fine.  I made about 20 small patties and I think they turned out crispier and cooked better this way.  They were enjoyed by vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike at a dinner party along with fish tacos.  They're also good with melted, crispy cheese on top.  I thought they made good leftovers, just warm in a pan the next day.  You must make the cream for topping, it really adds to the taste!  Will definitely make these again.

Used the recommendations of previous reviewers.  Sauteed red bell pepper along with the onion and microwaved the sweet potato for a minute.  Also added oregano, coriander, cayenne, and fresh cilanto to the bean cakes.  Added fresh cilanto to the lime sour cream, too.  I wish I had also added a small can of chiles as one reviewer had mentioned because, although the flavor was great, they were dry.

Delicious!!!I altered the recipe a little by taking away the jalapeno, as I am very sensitive to spicey food, anyway the cakes were delicious, I did add an extra egg, which made it very moist.  This is a keeper and the teens loved it!

I am going to give this 5 stars because my husband, who does not eat black beans at all enjoyed this very much.  So did my 11 year old son.  And for me, that makes this an EXCELLENT recipe.  I prepared this exactly as directed.  Thank you for sharing.

These were amazing! I made half of the recipe because there are only 2 of us, but used the whole egg. I also used a little jarred jalapeno in the sauce and the patties, as we are not fans of very spicy food. Half of the recipe made 4 good size patties. The sauce is incredible, I'll be using it for more than just this recipe. The balance of flavors is just perfect, and so unusual. The sweet potato is the perfect counterpoint to the heat of the cumin and jalapeno, and the lime sauce is the perfect complement. We both loved this recipe, and will be making it again soon! Thanks so much for sharing.

I substituted green chiles for jalapeños and made them in a skillet as you would for latkes.  Delicious!  Thank you for this wonderful and healthy recipe!

This was a good jumping off point with a couple of modifications after reading some of the reviews. It sounded like it needed a little more flavor oomph, so I did 1.5x the spices and added some cayenne because the serrano chilis I used were the wimpiest ones I've ever tasted! I also added some cilantro because we love it. I didn't bother to sautee the chilis or onions and garlic and they were just fine in the finished cake. I also subbed some oatmeal for the bread crumbs for extra fiber. I do think next time I would microwave the grated sweet potatoes to avoid the slight starchy flavor. That could be due to the grater size - the large Cuisinart blade.I doubled the recipe to have leftovers to freeze and so used 3 eggs, but next time I think I would use 4 to hold things together a little better.  I used the non-stick electric griddle and "fried" them with just a hint of olive oil to brown them. (Our broiler sets off the fire alarm even with no smoke!)  But this was a great option for a vegetarian meal and it was really satisfying! Thanks!

Yet another Meatless Monday. These cakes are a tad on the "sweet" side. The recipe definitely needs something else to balance out the sweetness of the yam.

****BEST VERSION***: I've made these about 5 times now and everytime I find a way to improve it.  The last time I made this, I must say blew me out of the water!  For a dinner for two, I halved what the recipe calls for.  Best adjustments so far:  add ground coriander (same quantity as what you use for cumin and added at the same step as when you add the cumin), grate the yams then microwave for 50 seconds before mixing in, and because the recipe is very mild I increased the jalapeno to 1.5 times what they call for and chop them more roughly so you get more bits of spice, increase the garlic to 1.5 times what they call for and roughly chop them, and the most important change i made was to FRY THEM! in a frying pan with a couple tablespoons of olive oil each side until nice and crispy dark brown.  Helpful hints: use your hands to mash everything together (it's much faster than using a spoon), then use an ice cream scooper to scoop them onto the frying pan then mash them down with a spatula.  I think this version really enhances the flavor of this recipe.

These were SO fantastic!  My boyfriend and his roommates were grilling their "manly meat" for dinner and being a vegetarian, I decided to make these as my meal.  Needless to say, the guys ended up eating these instead of their grilled meat!  No joke!  In fact, my boyfriend requested that I make these again just last week.  The only thing we did differently was to add more lime juice to the sauce.  This gave it just a bit more of a bite!  We enjoyed these without microwaving the sweet potato and really keeping an eye on them in the broiler.  Do be cautious as to the size of the jalapenos (obviously) as the second time we made them, we got brave and ended up with our mouths on fire!  Thank you SO much for the great recipe!  I have a feeling I'll be making these a lot in the future!

Very Good! I used 2 eggs and used rolled oats in place of the bread crumbs. I also added a chopped zucchini and red pepper. I sauted these vegetables with the green onion and sweet potato, and mixed everthing else together to combine. I froze the extras. (I did not make the sauce)

The recipe appeared a little time consuming, but once I actually had all the ingredients on hand, it didn't take long to throw together at all!  These were really healthy, and packed with delicious veggies and flavors.  And the lime sour cream was divine!  My husband and I loved these--I'll definitely make them again.

I love this recipe. It is a new favorite of mine and my daughter. I added a little extra bread crumbs (about 1/4 cup) after I made my first test patty. It wasn't necessary. The test patty was delicious. I just wanted to make the finished patties a little more firm. This probably would not have been needed at all, if I had drained the black beans a little more thoroughly, but I couldn't find my strainer. I also fried, instead of broiled the patties because my oven always sets off the smoke alarm. Funny, another reviewer said the same thing. Anyway, I fried the patties on medium heat with a little olive oil, they came out delicious.   This recipe is definitely going to be a new staple in our house. The cooked patties store in the fridge and reheat great. I just take a patty out of the fridge, heat it in an ungreased pan and chow down. These are way better than store bought veggie burgers and if you make a bunch ahead of time, they are just as quick and convenient to make.  Oh, and definitely make the sour cream sauce with the recipe. The sauce was yummy and a wonderfully perfect topper for this patty.

This is fantastic!  I added white cheddar cheese to them when they were done baking, and put back under the broiler for about 10 seconds! GREAT DISH!!!!  Oh, and I did not cook sweet potatoes before mixing into dish, they were perfect just the way they were!

Really, really good! I didn't have the jalapenos so I added some cayenne pepper instead. Microwaved the sweet potato as suggested and the texture was perfect. My kids (4, 3, and 1) loved them. The lime sour cream was fantastic, even without the jalapenos. I would give this recipe 6 stars if I could!

Too spicy for our 4 year old, but my husband and I loved this recipe! I followed it as written and the cakes turned out moist and flavorful. We didn't have any trouble at all with the sweet potato being hard/undercooked. The 1 egg seemed to bind the mixture well enough. The sour cream mixture was superb with the cakes--definitely try it as well. Excellent new recipe that will made it to the dinner table regularly from now on. Thanks! **Note: I used 2 semi-large sweet potatoes (grated them in a food processor) and they yielded 6 cups. I froze the extra two 2c measurements and hope they will use well next time I make the cakes.

These are really, really delicious.  I use 2 lbs. of dry black beans (soaked overnight and simmered 1 hour = aprox. 12 cups of beans) and two large sweet potatoes and roughly quadruple the other ingredients.  I end up with around 70 patties, pig out, and then freeze the remainder for future quick meals.  The sauce is especially good made with fresh cilantro, extra lime, and Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.  So good!  Thank you!  P.S.- I don't find it necessary to precook the sweet potato, I just broil them on the middle rack for the suggested amount of time and they come out perfectly.

Once upon a time there was a sad, lonely can of black beans in a pantry. It dreamt of the day it would become something much more than the sum of it's parts. One day a beautiful maiden plucked out the can of black beans and magically transformed it into the most deliciously fantastic black bean cakes ever made then married it to a perfect sauce and they lived happily ever after.

Pretty good recipe! I had to make quite a few changes because of what I had on hand - substituted 2 chipotle chilis for the jalepeno, oats for the bread crumbs, diced red onion for the green.  I also microwaved the sweet potato so I didn't have to grate it. I pureed the sweet potato, onion, chili, spices and 2 eggs, then added them to the beans and mashed, then added the oats.  I also pan fried them in a little olive oil so I wouldn't have to turn on my oven. The cakes have a smoke flavor from the chipotle. I substituted lemon juice and chipotle for the sauce - I would recommend following the recipe, my sauce wasn't that great.  I think these would be great as bite sized appetizers with a dollop of guac and sour cream on them!

Quite nice. Approved by daughter and husband. Easy to make and could make any number of variations. I made it as written, with only a couple of changes. I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and put about 1T of cilantro in the cake. Served with lime cilantro rice and corn on the cob. Would love to try it with shredded sharp cheese in the burger. Will try it next time.

I made a half batch and turned it into 3in round thin cakes(12) because I wanted them more of a crisp texture than I've had before. The sample cake was bland and the sauce dominates. I'm rating together(since that is the recipe). I ended up adding some coriander, chipotle chili powder and diced red pepper to give the cakes more flavor which I thought helped but the sour cream still dominates the flavor. I brushed on a little olive oil,grilled them rather than broil and it took about 20 minutes. Even though it's very good, I think I would prefer a little different sauce for these cakes so you can taste their subtle flavor, maybe a mild chipotle sour cream.

These are great - and the lime sour cream puts them over the top.  I serve these on a bed of greens with salsa and  sliced avocado. Top with a cilantro as well as the lime sour cream. 
To spread up preparation time - try using a food processor for the jalapenos, scrap out and chop the garlic, scrap out and chop the sweet potato.  
You can play around with the amounts a bit as well as add cilatro and or peppers and or chilis.  It still comes out delicious!

I thought this recipe was wonderful for those who need a healthy alternative! I have been eating healthy lately and this was a nice dish to cook for a small gathering. The leftovers will make for great lunches at work! The only difference I used was a can of kidney beans because I did not have 2 cans of black beans, just 1. It tasted great so I don't think the type of beans used makes much of a difference! Loved the special sour cream too. Overall there was a mild spicy heat coming from the cakes but even my cousin, who hates anything jalapeno, enjoyed these. Thank you for sharing a keeper!

Amazing!  I made this almost exactly as the recipe with a few minor adjustments - extra egg per suggestions, and added some different chili powders, along with some fresh cilantro.    Absolutely amazing recipe and one that will go on my list for the future!

These are very good.  To make these vegan omit the egg and use cashew cream or vegan mayo for the lime cream.  As many reviewers recommended I cooked the sweet potato and mashed it before adding it. I added canned green chilies to the bean mixture to make up for the missing egg moisture.  I cooked this in non stick pan instead of the broiler-  It was just too hot to turn on the broiler.  We will have these again.  mmmm

Very good! I used dry bean instead of canned and boiled the sweet potato before mashing it. Instead of the topping (don't like sour cream), I used some mashed avocado and put it in a half a pita. It was a very satisfying meal.

These came out slightly crisp on the outside and mushy on the inside.  They didn't hold together very well. They weren't cake like at all. It was as if I had put scoops of frijoles on a baking sheet and broiled them. These need something to give them more structure.

These were a hit at a recent party. I made small appetizer size patties and they didn't want to stay together and it seemed like I had to bake them a lot longer than the recipe says, but the taste was great. The lime sour cream was a perfect compliment to the cakes. Very good.

This is a great base recipe, so thanks!  Once i made these with regular potatoes because I didn't have sweet.  I've made them with sweet potatoes as well and like them both ways--- I'll probably go with sweet more often because they are more nutritious.  I halve the recipe as it's only my husband and I, but still use a whole egg.  A bit more cumin, a dash of cayenne and about 1/2t chili powder to spice it up a bit for us.  Love them!

amazing and versatile recipe. You don't need to microwave your sweet potatoes, they cook up nicely in the oven. I recommend adding green pepper and cilantro to the sour cream. I also added half the green pepper to the cakes. I would recommend making this cakes flat because they will crisp up better while broiling. I'm a lacto-vegetarian and I don't eat eggs...I just added a bit more bread crumbs and they held together just fine.

These cakes are great! I cooked them for a vegetarian/organic cooking contest at work and took first place! I took the advice of previous reviews and added oregano, coriander, cayenne, and fresh cilantro to the bean cakes. I also made them golf ball size then flattened. I brushed the cakes in olive oil since they looked a little dry. The best part was letting them sit overnight to enhance the flavors! Heat them up in a microwave with a wet paper towel and a lid to lock in moisture. Don’t skip on the lime jalapeno sour cream sauce. I found this to be great and can’t wait to try it on the family.

After reading all the rave reviews of this recipe I was excited to try it. However, after making it exactly as stated, I was disappointed, as were my guests.  The cakes don't seem to have enough flavor.  The lime sour cream is awesome and was the only saving grace for this recipe, but as is this recipe is just too bland.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written--how could you rate a recipe that you changed first??  My family loved it and so did the kid's friends who were visiting.  Definitely a winner!  Moist inside, crunchy outside, and the sauce was a great mild & creamy flavor.

Prep took longer for me than stated. From start to finish it took me a little over, an hour. I followed recipe exactly and thought they were delicious, although next time I will add more spices(and we are not ones for real spicy dishes). IMO these defintely need a sauce as they are a little dry and the sour cream/lime/jalepeno was a very mild, nice sauce. I really liked broiling instead of frying too. Thank you, Christine, I will make again definitely!

I thought it was very good, I've made it a couple times and it's taken a little bit of time to get consistencies right when they cook but I'd recommend this. I took out the jalapeno and added about a tablespoon of Djon Mustard and some extra cumin and chili powder and it came out very well with just enough kick.

After reading some of the reviews from people that didn't like this recipe, I decided to try this recipe anyway. I didn't follow the measurements exactly and used Panko bread crumbs and serrano peppers I had marinated in wine vingegar. I also kept the consistency wetter. I coated them lightly with flour and did fry them in minimal olive oil and drained them well. I think they were absolutely delicious, even though I did not make the sour cream topping. I'll give the topping the next time I make this recipe.

Wow. These are really good! The sour cream is great. Since I usually make a half batch, I just use a whole egg, and the patties stay together just fine. I also broiled them a little longer, as I wanted them very crispy.

These make delicious black bean burgers! I've even made them without the egg to take to a potluck for a vegan co-worker. Didn't hold together quite as well, but good enough to keep their shape. They were a hit!

Great recipe. I made the cakes as written except used serrano and anaheim chiles from my garden, the jalapenos aren't producing yet. :-) Also I had panko on hand so that was what went in there, it gave a great texture.  The sour cream sauce I subbed serrano and lemon juice, limes aren't ripe yet. It didn't have enough something for me. Tried to kick it up with spices. I think I'd prefer an avocado sauce next time.  Solid recipe. I liked the texture with the raw sweet potatoes and the mashed black beans (used a potato masher) and broiled. Sure, it would have been crispier if it had been fried but it was solid as is and healthier Husband says texture was awesome, he's a meat eater and says he wants me to make it again as a burger next time.  Will definitely make again.

This was very good.  Next time I will chop up some more onions, garlic and jalapenos.  I also think I would like them pan fried in some oil instead of under the broiler.  Thanks for sharing- my dd actually thought they had meat in them:)  Make the lime sour cream sauce makes them good!

These are excellent!   I did add a bit of lite Bleu Cheese crumbles to the "bean batter". I tried pan frying these in a small amount of olive oil, seemed to give a bit more crunch to the outside of the cakes, though they are delicious broiled too! The Lime Sour Cream is YUMMY and I added finely chopped cilantro to it as well.

Mmmmmm, these are good! The only change I made was after I shredded the sweet potato, I cooked it in a skillet for just a few minutes to soften. Also used green chiles instead of jalapeno bc that's what I had on hand and less than 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to save some calories. Reheated well the next day, which is a bonus to me! Good recipe, will make again!

Boil the potatoes!  These were great.  I decided that boiling the potatoes was easier than grating them so that's what I did. The cakes held together well.   Not fond of cumin so I used smoked paprika instead. No bread crumbs.  I made half a recipe of the cakes using two medium sweet potatoes. I made a whole recipe of the sour cream sauce and added an avocado to that.  I used a stick blender to puree the sauce.  I had sauce left over but it made a yummy salad dressing for the next day.  The leftover cakes were delicious right out of the frig.

i made these for a pot luck, and while they were well received, i would not call them "spicy". i made them appetizer sized and got about 40 little cakes. i sprayed the cakes with olive oil and browned them in a non-stick skillet, which gave them a nice crispy crust without any mess (or risk of burning!) i did add a second egg - they would have been too dry without - and i used gluten-free breadcrumbs. will definitely make again!

I became a member on allrecipes just so I could rate this dish, it was that amazing.  Other than topping it with fresh mango & avocado salsa, I made it to the recipes exact instructions.  I don't know if I've ever had a meal with so many different and complimentary flavors.  It is FANTASTIC!  I love the idea someone posted of making them bite size for an appetizer too.  Thanks for posting this fabulous recipe!

These were amazing.  My husband made these for my Mother's Day dinner (this was actually the first recipe he's cooked in his whole life!) and they were to die for.  The lime cream is a must with these.  Fresh lime zest really adds a kick to it, and he added more jalapenos than what was called for.  I just hope he is willing to make these for me again soon--I'm craving them already!

Use 2/3 can of refried beans and 1 can of rinsed and mashed black beans, 2 Cups shredded sweet potato, 1 cup of chopped cilantro, 5 cloves minced garlic, 1 sliced and seeded jalapeno, 1/2 tsp. red pepper, 2 tsp. cumin, 2 beaten eggs, and 1/2 cup rolled oats.  In skillet with 2 T. EVOO, saute garlic and jalapeno.  Add sweet potatoes.  Cook for 10 min. on med.-low heat.  Remove from heat.  Let cool for a few minutes.  Add Everything to mashed beans and mix well.  Put mixture into refrigerator for at least an hour.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Pat out into 16-18 patties.  Bake 20-25 min. turning over midway.  The 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 chopped cilantro, 1/2 lime juiced and zested, sauce is really good.

I enjoyed both making and eating these versatile little cakes! They were very easy to make and I can see lots of potential for other flavors, such as making them with ginger instead of cumin for an Asian style cake. Mine turned out rather dry, though, so I will likely use less breadcrumbs next time. I was a bad girl and didn't make the lime sour cream but instead served it with fresh home made guacamole on top and it was super yum!

Really good!  The jalapeno-lime sour cream was a good match and countered the heaviness of the cakes well.  After mixing the bean cake ingredients together, I cooked one small cake to check the flavor.  It was pretty bland so I added more cumin (about 1 T), plenty of oregano (2 T), some cayenne (1/2 t?), fresh cilantro (1/4 c) and garlic powder.  There was a lot more flavor than the first cake I baked, so I would defintely recommend checking the seasonings with a small amount before cooking them all.
Thanks for a nice change of pace!

This recipe is awesome!  Even my non-veggie friends liked it.  The prep is a bit time consuming (esp. grating the sweet potato) but its worth it.  The lime sour cream is a great touch goes perfectly with the black bean cakes.

We made this recipe and it turned out so delicious.  There are many steps involved but it was worth it.  My vegetarian son loved it!  The spicy black bean cakes bake in just 8 minutes.  They look like they could be made in advance and frozen.  The sour cream lime topping was delicious.  Will definitely make again.  It was a hit!

The flavor was excellent and flavored sour cream was perfect topping which I may try on other recipes.  Only comment is that the cakes didn’t hold together as well as I expected.  Next time, I may increase the egg or decrease bred crumbs slightly. Also, may place at ~ 6 inches from broiler.  Were a little too browned/blackened.  Only effected presentation, taste was still excellent.

After making this recipe so many times this year after discovering, felt I should review. First, thankful for all prior reviews, as I always find them helpful in making to suit my taste.  So, my take on those:  Yes to the 2 eggs, Yes to extra EVOO (i double it when sauteing and also use a tad more on the pan when broiling), Yes to adding fresh cilantro to both the sour cream and the bean cake mixture, No need to precook the grated sweet potato, Yes to doubling the cumin.  I've also not had a problem broiling them.  I think if you're smoking, it's too much oil on the sheet, possibly.  Since making this so many times, I've had the need to modify for various reasons (out of something, forgetfulness, or food sensitivities).  Those that work and don't work:  Lemon in place of lime in the sour cream. I was out and hesitated to try, but almost think I like it better, a tad tangier, either is good.  Yellow onion in place of spring, not awful, but stick to spring when possible.  I'm not much on measuring, so added too much grated sweet potato once, not recommended....again, not awful, but not as good.  On the other hand, was out of sweet potato once, so made all bean and just added more panko (preferred bread crumbs for me) and they were still good all bean.  I don't care for fresh garlic and it does not like me, but with the amount called for, knew better than to omit garlic completely. So, I shake in some minced garlic and it works well.  I forgot it once, not as good. So if you hav

These turned out really good.  I agree with others that the spices can be kicked up just a notch.  I am trying to eat more vegetarian meals so these were perfect. My kids, who are not joining me on my quest, liked them too.

I thought these were really good.  A little on the crumbly side (I must have done something wrong), so I melted a little shredded cheddar on top.  We had them w/ regular sour cream & salsa.  I would def. make these again!

Been wanting to try a vegetarian burger for awhile and this one really hit it!  Fast and easy to mix together, but it did need a little more heat to spice it up.  I added some chili powder and a bit of pickled jalapeño as well.  And the sour cream sauce really took it over the top; I did add some very finely minced lime zest to the sauce too.  Will be using this quite often!

I liked this recipe. The taste was good. My kids thought that the sweet potatoes was cheese - so I didn't correct them. My only complaint was that they were kind of dry. Without the sour cream they would have been too dry. I did flatten them pretty thinly but I am wondering if cooking them in a no stick pan would work better. Also - don't make them too far in advance.

We used black beans that were dry and we soaked and cooked them, but I don't think it would matter. They were amazing. During lent we will definitely be having these on Fridays. Don't skip the sweet potatos, they add a lot to the taste and texture. A great meatless alternative and the yogurt dressing is the bomb.

Mmm-mmm-good! Didn't give 5 stars b/c I adjusted. Halved the recipe. Skipped bread crumbs (g/f plus it didn't need 'em) and the sauce (time factor). Added ground turmeric. Fried on top the stove. De-lish! Excellent recipe.

This has become the meatless staple in my carnivorous household. They are less healthy, but super yummy if you fry the patties in vegetable oil.

I have made these many times and love them.  To cut down on the prep time, I have started putting the sweet potatoes in a food processor rather than grating it.

Tasty vegetarian option- the lime sour cream is a must!  I was surprised by the sweetness the sweet potato added, but the flavor (with the jalapenos and spices) was good.  I made the cakes smaller than recommended and broiled them.  I might try frying in a bit of oil next time to get a crispier cake.

These were absolutely amazing. We like spice, but I felt 2 jalepenos were fine - and I was happy I made that choice. Didn't have a problem with the uncooked sweet potato. This got my take-out happy fiance to eat and enjoy something healthy - this will become a week night staple.

Love this recipe!  I always double or triple the recipe because they refrigerate and/or freeze wonderfully.  

I did add additional spices (coriander, chile powder, cilantro) to give it more kick.  One time I only had one can of black beans so substituted with a can of pinto beans and the result was great.  There was no real difference in the final taste. 

I soften the grated sweet potatoes in the microwave as others suggested & also softened the black beans to make mashing easier.  And, used two eggs as others suggested.

Because I like my green onions fresh and crispy, I added those to the lime sour cream with a little fresh cilantro and used sweet onions in the cakes. 

I baked mine at 425 degrees for time indicated instead of broiling.  I prefer a moister patty.  

Wonderful recipe.....LOVE IT!

I held back on the heat with these since I didn't know how spicy my guests liked their food, but they were still delicious. Next time I will crank up the jalapeno and cumin. the sweet potato adds a faint sweetness that gives a nice balance with the spice. And the lime sour cream really is a must.

Great recipe. I adjusted this to create a three-bean cake (kidney, pinto, lentils), omitted the jalapeno and used basil. Next time I will use black beans and try something else, but the outcome was delicious this first time around.

Followed recipe, decreased jalapeno peppers by one.  Added cilantro to the sour cream dip.  Watch your broiling time or where you have your rack placed, mine were starting to get a little crispy.  Will add avacado to my dinner serving tonight.  Very nice recipe.  Love the sweet potatoes in it.

I too added another egg, and used panko instead of the bread crumbs. I used both the broil method, and I also baked another batch at 400. Next time I'll use the food processor to combine the jalapeno and sour cream for the dip so it's a bit smoother.

I didn't precook the sweet potato, and don't see how it would've helped. The texture was very nice. Agree with others that it's the lime sour cream that makes these stand out.

I sauteed some garlic, jalepeno peppers as suggested, then in one bowl, took a half of can of black beans, some garlic and seasonings, along with the egg, some flour and breadcrumbs, mixed it all together and made patties. Once made, I fried in canola oil. It was soo amazing. My mixture generated 3 burgers. One I ate and two I left for dinner and lunch for another day. Thanks for the great recipe. Oh i forgot i added the fat free sour cream but didn't add jalepenos. I was too fast for myself. These are sooo good. Since I didn't have the yam, i skipped adding that. Will try that on the next go around.

These were pretty tasty but lack a little texture.  Made this recipe exactly as stated except I cooked them in a skillet with nonstick spray to get the sides a bit crispier.  I think my salt and pepper "to taste" was a bit off since I had to season with both after the cakes were cooked.  I would guesstimate 3 tsp of each are needed.  Next time I will try replacing the bread crumbs with oats or brown rice to give them some chewiness (otherwise kind of mush).

These were GREAT! The sour cream sauce really made the dish...dont skip it. I didnt have any jalapeno peppers so I used hot red chillis and it turned out beautifully. I will make these again, for sure.

my oven must run a little hotter than most because after 5 minutes they were nearly on fire. Despite this, they turned out great. I added chopped cilantro to the sour cream which turned out delicious!

I would eat these every day if I could - they are soooooooooo good! I've gotten my sister addicted to these too. If you're using dry beans, make sure you cook them through very very well and mash them very very well, or you will have spicy black bean hash instead of cakes. Fantabulous!

This recipe is great! I usually make it as it it written but, I have also used it as a stuffing for portobello mushroom caps. It was an awesome main entree. I made it totally vegan for friends by using silken tofu with a bit of extra lime juice for the sauce, matzo meal instead of traditional breads crumbs and oat flour for a binder. It didn't change the flavor one bit. It's a permanent fixture in my recipe box.

despite my intstincts I made this recipe as is. It turned out dry and stringy. I did not like it. The idea was there but there are a lot of things i would change to make it again. I would bake or boil the sweet potatos before hand, mash them and then add the black beans and put through a food processor to create a smooth mixture. Add all the rest of the ingreediants except the bread crumbs and then roll balls into crumbs and bake that way.  I think it will come out much better the next time i make it using the above directions.

These are great!  I microwaved the sweet potatoes as suggested and used Non-fat Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream for the sauce recipe.  My husband has asked for them again and again.

Excellent all the way around.  I used most of the modifications suggested and they were great.  I cooked mine on the grill instead of under the broiler.  About 8 min on Med before flipping for the final 4 min - worked great.  Definately don't skip the lime sr cream

We are a family of carnivors that are trying to cut down on the meat.  This was not bad, but no mistakin' this is a patty of beans.  Not sure what I was expecting.  We may try it again, but I will try to fry them next time, I think it might give them more depth.

After preparing and tasting this recipe as is I thought that it would be an excellent filling for a burrito.  Ran to the store and grabbed some 8" flour tortillas and a avocado.  Layered the  warmed burrito with brown rice, spicy black bean cakes, lettuce, tomato, avocado and topped with the jalapeno sour cream.  Muy Delicioso!

A DELICIOUS way to use the sweet potato I had on hand.  It was a great addition to the black bean cakes!  I skipped on using the jalapeno pepper but used a bit of chipotle powder instead to add a little pepper spice.  Really liked that the onions were sauteed prior to mixing with the black beans, but next time I think I'll also saute the grated sweet potato with the onion briefly before adding to the mashed beans.  They were a little bit crunchier in the cakes than I had hoped.  (The sour cream dressing thinned with a little more lime makes a great salad dressing, too!)

These were good and I will make them again.  They were quite dry and fell apart easily, so next time I will try using 3 eggs to help hold them together.  I will also use more Jalepeno to make them more spicy for our taste.  The sour cream (I used fat free) was very, very good with them.  But, next time I will use a bit more lime juice and Jalepeno.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy. I love black beans and sweet potatoes, but it would never have occurred to me to eat them together. Followed the recipe exactly, just microwaved the sweet potato for about 2 minutes per someone's suggestion. Both my husband and I thought they were delicious.

These are great!  I like the sweet potato in them- adds texture and a bit of flavor.   Made them without the jalapeno and they are still very savory with just the cumin.

I did a different sauce:
1 ripe avocado
1 C sour cream
1/2 bunch cilantro
1-2 Tbs. lime juice
1 tsp. minced garlic
salt to taste
Process all ingredients in food processor until blended and cilantro is chopped.  Very tasty!!

grated the sweet potatoes small pieces and make small paties that are not thick and add tabasco sauce instead of jalapenos. You cand add fresh coriander to the sauce and i did not put hot stuff into the sauce so it's refreshing.

Added 1 T. chili powder and 1 t. ground coriander.  I'd also recommend microwaving the grated sweet potato.  I made this twice, once substituting 1/4 cup soy yogurt for the egg - both ways turned out well.  Wasn't crazy about the lime sour cream, instead I served with plain sour cream and salsa.  Will definitely make again.

YUMMY! I added a considerable amount of cayenne pepper and some oregano to spice it up based on previous reviews. My husband and I like spicy. I would probably leave it as is (or close to it) if cooking for guests. Also, I fried them using a bit of olive oil because I don't have a broiling pan. The result was slightly crispy on the outside and softer on the inside. Other than that I left everything the same and it was delicious and beautiful! Served with the equally tasty lime sour cream sauce dolloped on top with a side of rice. I thought the garlic sounded excessive but even with the six cloves it was far from being a predominant flavor. It all blends together quite well.  This was a very satisfying vegetarian meal and will be served over and over again in this house. What a great find!

Very good. I halved the recipe, so using one full egg made it a little extra goopy, but it turned out fine. I think the sweet potato dampens the heat of the jalepeno, so I was sorry that I left it out of the sour cream. I was low on cumin, so I did a little bit of that, a little coriander and a little cilantro and it was good. Ate this with wild rice.

These came out dry and pasty. I followed the recipe exactly and expected them to brown during broiling, however they didn't.  If I make these again, I would fry them in a skillet with a generous amount of oil.

I really liked this recipe. They were an appreciated offering for my vegetarian friends.  I followed the recipe mostly- substituted a pasilla pepper and used much less cumin (it can really take over the other flavors). I used my immersion blender to mash the beans (some left whole). I broiled 12 “cakes” as per directions, ran out of time and needed to go to my party. The next day, I fried the rest in a lightly greased pan (browned on one side, flipped, covered and let cook on low heat). I think the pan fried “cakes” were better. For the sauce, I basically made tzatziki- no peppers but cucumbers (salted and drained), garlic, lime juice and sour cream.

Loved the combination of flavors! But there wasn’t enough moisture to make patties or successfully broil and flip them. I put it all in a skillet and fried it like hash browns.
Will try again and reconfigure.

This was my first dive into the vegetarian world.  This was really good, and has been requested to be put in the rotation.  Which it will.  The sour cream sauce makes the dish in our opinion.  Very good

This turned out so yummy!! I used my food processor to grate the sweet potatoes and then again to mash the black beans instead of a fork. I didn’t have any chillies so I added chili powder and cayenne pepper powder and some extra green onions.  I also cut the balls in half and made 16 of them. I left them in ball form under the broiler for 8 mins on parchment paper then  flipped them over and smashed them into a cake and broiled for another 3 mins. This worked out perfectly!  I doubled the amount of sour cream because I know I’ll use this on a lot of stuff. I also doubled the lime juice (8-10 tsp for 1 cup of sour cream) and added lime zest and cilantro. It’s perfect!!  I served with a bit of meatless queso and garnished with chopped tomato. This will definitely be a new go to dish, even after lent!!

A definite hit. I only used 1 large jalapeños split between the cake and the sauce. My wife found the sauce too hot. Next time I will leave it out of sauce and double it up in the cake.

Pretty easy to make and very flavorful.  The jalapeno sour cream adds even more spice!  I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream and it worked just as well.

My husband is trying to remove carbs from his diet, so I rinsed and dried the sweet potatoes, and omitted the bread crumbs.
This made it necessary for me to bake them a little as well as broil them to keep them together a little better!
Overall, a successful first try, and a meal we both enjoyed!

I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream for the sauce and 2 eggs in the cakes.  I baked on my stone in the broiler - turning after 8 mins...total about 15 mins then put them in the oven at 450 for another 5-7 just to firm up. 
They were awesome - and had a nice crunch to the outer side.  My husband was very skeptical - and couldn't stop saying how good they were - he is not a spicy foody - but these weren't over the top spicy and he is looking forward to having them again anytime.  Thank you for a great healthy alternative to meat!

Easy. I added a 1/2 c shredded carrots and an extra egg. Very tasty. Better with the sour cream on top. Kiddos eat all organic and the 7 & 9 yr young liked them.

The lime sour cream is a great addition!  Easy recipe that I made even easier by used canned sweet potatoes.  I think it helped with the consistency as one egg and amount of bread crumbs in the recipe did not seem to want to hold it together.  They were not completely falling apart but maybe two eggs would be better.  Definitely needed more then the time listed to be crisp and easy to flip as well. This recipe might just replace frozen!!

Very easy to make and yummy!  We ate them for breakfast lunch and dinner.  My only note is to make them a little thicker next time.  I tried to make flat like picture and they fell apart really easy.  
Great taste though!

Very good! I used less jalapeño because I don’t like things too spice but I think if I had used a whole pepper in the sour cream and two whole peppers in the beans it would have been fine for me. 
They were a hit. I made them smaller so they’d feed more people but in doing so I had to lessen the broiler time by at least 3 minutes.  If you make smaller cakes, watch your broiler carefully!!!
Will definitely make these again!

These were good, if a little bland. I wish I had seen some of the other reviews and added a few more things to it. I did love the lime jalapeno sour cream! I topped these with some shredded  pork, avocado and green salsa, and it was an amazing combination.

I didn't have jalopinio peppers so I used hot sauce. Fell apart when made it. I kept pressing  it back together  when i cooked it. Maybe another egg would help. It was delisious.  I'm making it again.

I made the mistake of not rinsing and draining the beans well enough. I think that is why it ended up a bit too wet. Flavors are awesome. Easier than I thought but I am not fond of broiling. Next time and there will be a next time I will add another egg. Oh and I substituted crushed corn flakes for the bread crumbs so it would be gluten free. Really great flavors. I’m gonna have to pay more attention to the consistency before forming the patties

This recipe is a keeper!.  I added the extra egg, as previous reviews suggested, and added a bit more jalapeño peppers.  The patties are a bit crumbly, but very tasty.

We made the bean cakes for dinner last evening.  I didn't change anything in the bean cake part of the recipe and swaped greek yogurt for the sour cream in the topping.  The flavor was good and they held together fairly well during cooking.  Everyone enjoyed them and we will definitely make them again.  Thanks for the recipe!  Also wondering what people think about freezing them for future meals.

I really like this recipe.  The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because I didn't think they were spicy.  Next time I will also add some red pepper flakes.  Definitely will make these again!

I loved this "clean eating" recipe! to make it a little more heart healthy, I omitted the salt and found I didn't miss it. I also omitted the pepper because the jalapeños gave it enough spice. Instead of the lime sour cream, I made a garlicky cilantro serrano pepper Greek yogurt dressing. They were mildly sweet, savory, and zesty and paired well with the aromatic fresh cilantro dressing. I will definitely make this again.

Made these tonight - quite tasty, but my husband cooked them in a cast iron skillet on the grill and I think he got them a bit too crispy!  But the reason for the 4 star rating - I need to play with the seasonings to satisfy our tastes.  Loved the idea of adding the sweet potato - lends a touch of sweetness, and some added nutritional value.  Oh, I didn't have any bread crumbs so used ground flax seeds - similar texture, binds like bread and better for us (also a good option for those people who have issues with gluten).  Also, next time I make these I will add a bit of lime zest to the sour cream mixture, along with some chopped cilantro; might add some chopped cilantro to the bean cakes, too - I'll just have to see if it sounds good at the time!  Thanks for a good starting point!

These were such a huge hit! I used the food processor to shred the sweet potato and to mash the black beans. For the adults I added some siracha before baking. I made 20 small cakes. I made these gluten free with gluten free breadcrumbs but I think quinoa would be fine. I also added a second egg. Thank you!

So yum! Took the suggestion of cooking the cakes in ball form instead of flattening them and they did stay together. These were even better the next day (and cold!)! Grating the sweet potato was a pain but it was worth it. Only used 1.5 jalapenos but otherwise followed the recipe. Thanks so much!

My husband is a serious carnivore and was hesitant to try this recipe, especially since he's not a real fan of sweet potato, but he gobbled them up and even my picky two year old ate a patty and a half.  Per some of the other reviews, I did nuke the sweet potato shreds in the microwave for a minute just to help them along (I don't see why you couldn't throw them in the pan with the other vegetables and achieve the same thing if you wanted to avoid an additional step).  I also used two eggs since the complaint tends to be that the cakes are a little on the dry side.  When mixing, I dumped the beans into my Kitchenaid mixer first and used the paddle to mash the beans (because I'm lazy), then added all of the other ingredients, as written. The sauce was very good. I think next time I will try to add a few more spices to the patty; without the sauce, I think the patty could be a little bland.

I made a half-recipe of this. I enjoyed the taste. Mine were a bit crunchy-for some reason I used a large grate, not a fine grate, when grating the sweet potato. The mixture was a bit dry even with a full medium-sized egg in the half mixture, so I added a dash of Worceshire (sp?) sauce and a couple teaspoons of water. I did use Panko for the bread crumbs, so that may have contributed to the dryness. I cooked one on the stovetop to try right away and enjoyed it with the sauce. I loved the sauce BEFORE I added fresh lime juie. After...eh. I felt I lost the taste of the sour cream and jalapeno when I added lime juice. I made another for supper, served with rice and corrots.  I will definitely make these again, grating the sweet potato finer abd omitting the lime in the sauce.

I made some adjustments based on the reviews I read but really liked this recipe. I used half a red onion as that is what I had on hand as well as some canned jalapenos rather than fresh. I also added 1 Tbsp cayenne, chili powder and oregano as well as some cilantro paste (about 2 tsp). I put everything including the spices, onion/garlic mixture, potatoes and black beans into a large bowl and used a immersion blender to combine. Despite some reviews, I only used 1 egg and 1/2 cup of panko and felt that the texture was very good and not dry like other black bean burgers I've made. I used a little less than a half cup of mix per cake and still came out with 12 rather than 8 which is fine as I'll freeze for lunches etc. I used my broiler as the recipe stated. The cook times seemed accurate though I recommend using the full 10 minutes for the first side to make sure everything sets before flipping. They weren't as crispy as I thought they were going to be but I like that they don't use a lot of oil to cook. Also, just as a tip, I used a small food processor to grate/shred the sweet potato as well as chop up the onion which was very helpful in making this a quicker meal. I used plain greek yogurt with lime juice and zest rather than the above sour cream mix since I spiced up my burgers. Thanks for the recipe and helpful reviews!

Very good. I didn't have any jalapeno's so I used a can of green chili's and I was also out of bread crumbs so I just ran some crackers through the food processor. I did not precook the potatoes and I am happy I didn't, I think it would have made them too mushy. I also added extra lime juice to the sour cream. I will be making again but I think I will cook them on the stove top instead of in the broiler. The sour cream is a much have.

These were fantastic!  After reading the reviews, I added another egg and replaced some of the bread crumbs with oats.  I refrigerated the 'dough' for a couple of hours, so I had no problem with them falling apart.  I did not cook the sweet potato as others suggested, and it came out great.  I did not broil them, but rather cooked them at 425 for a little longer than the recipe stated, until hot all the way through.  This prevented them from drying out as others have noted.  The Lime Sour Cream is amazing!  Served the cakes with curry couscous and steamed lemon broccoli - amazing.  Even the carnivore bf loved it.

Great recipe! Because I am a vegan I omitted the egg and added an egg substitute. Didn't take away from the flavor at or consistency at all! I also added some diced cilantro to the cakes as well at the sauce... I find cilantro adds a great compliment to any Spanish inspired dish!

Awesome recipe ... only problem I encountered was they seemed a little dry - tended to crumble apart - could be because I adjusted the recipe down to 2 servings and the ingredient amounts may have been slightly off.

I made smaller patties to serve as an appetizer for my dinner group. They loved them. I think the lime sour cream truly makes them. The cakes themselves were very good. I will definitely make them again.

I thought these cakes were really good. I was surprised to read reviews that said they were dry because mine weren't dry at all. The sweet potatoe added a nice surprising sweetness. I thought they had lots of flavor. Will definately make these again.

Made a 1/2 recipe for the two adults in our house. Subbed the jalapenos in the patties for green pepper, since hubby doesn't like spicy. Didn't need to nuke the sweet potato at all. I baked mine on a cookie sheet since I had other things in the oven, and it worked well.  Made sure to spray the cookie sheet a second time when I flipped them.  Also, didn't have lime juice, so used lemon instead in the cream...would've preferred the lime, but the lemon still tasted good.  Served with a peanut butter slaw...the contrasting flavors worked well together!

Maybe I did something wrong-- I cut the recipe in half, except I used an entire egg, but these turned out terrible for me. I also added red pepper and cilantro and perhaps I used too many veggies. Not sure, but these didnt form balls for me, or really patties, I sort of just had to clump them together. they totally fell apart. The flavor was good, but they certainly werent "cakes".

I made the patties just like it says, and they came out terrific!  I skipped the sour cream, though, and made them into veggie burgers.  The patties are the perfect size.  I will definitely make these again.

Lots of yummy flavors. My family really likes spices so I doubled the garlic and added lots of cilantro to the burgers.  I wasn't crazy about the sauce UNTIL I tried it with the burgers......very nice!

I made the recipe exactly as written.  It was ok.  For a recipe that has onion, jalapeno, and garlic in it, there wasn't a lot of flavor.  The sour cream was excellent, though, and was the one thing that made the dish interesting.

Pretty good...would have been better if I had added the seeds with the jalepeno since I like it spicy. Omitted the egg,and used shredded zucchini and chopped mushrooms instead of the sweet potato. I also used panko crumbs. I halved the recipe and made 4 decent sized patties. Topped with salsa. Will make again.

this was a great alternative to having a black bean burger at Chili's!  Next time I need to use more jalapeno peppers...I cut down to one huge one and it wasn't enough.  I think I would make the sauce a few hours or the night before so that the flavors would be more intense.  This is a really good recipe for a vegetarian alternative.

I actually think these were like a 3 1/2.  I don't know what I did wrong but they didn't have a ton of taste to me and didn't hold well together. I added red pepper flakes and extra cumin.  The sour cream sauce is the best part.  I'm going to go back and read the reviews b/c I want these to work!!

Great recipe. If you chill the mixture before making them into patties, they hold up better. I fried them in a bit of olive oil and they turned out perfectly. Substitued the sour cream with low fat yogurt. Think I will try making these a bit smaller and serving them as appetizers.

i was disappointed.  I wasn't a fan of the consistency with the shredded potatoes--maybe they would have been better if i cooked them with the veggies, but as written these were just ok. i won't make them again, but i'll finish up the leftovers.

These get 5 stars for how good they are for you and are tasty as well. The only thing I did differently is added canned chopped jalepeno since there was a recall on fresh jalepenos. Made them nice and spicy. Though I do have to say, I had quite a time not breaking these apart when trying to flip them and they took much longer than the 4 mins stated or they would have been mushy. I finally figured out at the end that when it came time to flip, I put a piece of foil (with little oil) on top of the cakes and flipped pan and all, making it easier to heat the other sides. Then I carefully slid them off of foil when it was done and they stayed in tact. I tried frying these in a pan with a little olive oil and that did not work well at all. It just soaked up the oil and stuck to the pan. I will have to try the pam next time, but I may just stick with broiling them.

This is an awesome!!! Instead of using the oven, I sprayed a skillet with Pam and cooked on both sides for about 4 min. each at med high heat. I don't even like sweet potatoes, but man, this recipe is yummmmy! My friend, who doesn't like sweet potatoes either, loved this recipe as well! I made extra and put in a bowl in the fridge and cooked 2 days later for another dinner!

These are very tasty. However, my cakes turned out dry. I made smaller sizes for dipping, so maybe that's the reason? I also added extra garlic and green onion, and a little bit of salsa in the mix. Definitely make the lime sour cream; it's fantastic.

This was truly fabulous. My skeptical husband was even impressed, and did not mind that we were having a "veg" dinner.I was a little nervous about how this was going to turn out, and,after reading the reviews, I decided to leave out the jalapenos from the sour cream, I substituted four egg whites for the one egg, and made about eighteen thin patties. I will use this recipe again and again, it's going into the rotation for sure! Thanks!

These were really great.  I've never had anything similar.  I made a few changes.  My sweet potatoes were really large so I actually ended up tripling the recipe.  I microwaved the grated sweet potatoes for 1 minute as mentioned in other reviews.  I had 20oz cans of black beans, so I used 2 of those and 1 can of refried black beans.  I did not mash the regular black beans, so in the cakes you had whole beans plus the refried black beans helping to hold it all together.  I added lots of jarred jalapeños and a little bit of juice from the jar.  DH and I both really loved these.  I wrapped this & put them in the refrigerator and hope they are just as good reheated!!

I worked at a restaurant years ago that served spicy black bean cakes. Ever since then I have been looking for a good recipe to curve my black bean cake cravings. This recipe isn't really close to the one at the restaurant, but it is still pretty good. Next time I make these I think I will add one more egg to make them a bit moister and maybe try frying them rather than using the broiler. This was a nice quick and easy meal, not to mention healthy for us. I didn't use the topping that was suggested but rather topped mine with guacamole since that was how they were topped at the restaurant I worked at.

I've made this recipe TONS of times! I usually halve it down in size because it yields a big batch (halving the recipe would give you about 6-7 patties that are two and a half inches diameter). 

These are great to bring to parties too, since they bake in so little time (and are easy to warm up once already baked!).

For those who are wondering, this recipe comes straight out of the Martha Stewart "Great Food Fast" cookbook.  But, regardless, I made it tonight and thought it was quite time consuming.  I should have read the reviews here first because they do turn out quite bland. As many previous reviewers have said, the lime sour cream really makes the recipe.  Don't skip that!

I made these tonight for my family who all have different tastes and everyone gobbled them down. I used less jalapeno  just to be on the safe side because mine were rather large . Next time I'll use the full amount.   A delicious and healthy recipe!

They tasted good but they were a little dry.  Maybe because I used cooked dried beans instead of canned.  I would probably try this recipe again.

I loved these. Really good with the sour cream. I got half fat sour cream and it tasted perfectly fine, I didn't miss the extra fat! I made a side of quinoa cooked in chicken broth to go with these cakes. To make again for sure!

Much better than I'd expected they'd be. Even my picky kids loved these. I used only 2 jalapenos total in order to make the flavor milder for the kids. Still, the dish was flavorful enough for my husband and me. Will definitely make again!

FANTASTIC!!! I made this last night for my girlfriend and I. We both loved it. Not really spicy, so you may want to add a little something if thats what you really want, but wonderful flavor. My girlfriend's cousins (4 and 6) came over about the time we were finishing dinner and tried it and both liked it alot. Thought mashing the beans before adding the peppers would make for better conistancy, and though it "did" it actually made the patties taste not quite as good and not cook quite as evenly so I recommend following the directions for that part too :). I will DEFINATLY be making this again!

I was disappointed with the texture, expected them to be crispy/crunchy and instead the bean cakes were mushy.  The flavor was good- my husband and 2.5 year old daughter liked it.

Very interesting.  I don't usually like sour cream dips, but decided to make it anyway since other reviewers insisted that it was "key" to the dish.  I made the cakes smaller than suggested and still had to broil them longer than the recipe stated; but it all turned out well in the end.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family really liked these served with rice and salsa. I had a 19 oz. can of black beans so adjusted the other ingredients accordingly, although I still used 1 whole egg.  The broiler wasn't working so I cooked these on an oiled, non-stick electric griddle.  The recipe, even though I reduced it, yielded 8 good size cakes.

This was excellent!  We loved it!...  I added fresh cilantro on top of each cake and only used one jap pepper beacuse that was all I had.  The lime sauce with the sweet potato makes for an interestingly fabulous taste and it is healthy to boot.  Thank you,we now have a new dinner staple!

These turned out way better than any black bean cakes I've ever made.  Other recipes call for pan frying the cakes.  They always end up sticking to the pan and falling apart.  These did not stick (I used cooking spray instead of oil) and did not fall apart.  I would have given this recipe five stars but the cakes did end up a little more bland than I would like, despite my adding about 1/4 t. of both chili powder and cumin.  If you like spicy food, be gererous with your spices!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made the cakes very small and got about 10 using half recipe.  I plan to make even smaller ones to take to my office holiday party.  I also used regular (fat) sour cream for the sauce.

After the first 2 steps, i was very impressed with this recipe: the onions, garlic and cumin smelled and looked great... but something went wrong after that bc these patties came out very dry and their texture was, well, less than appetizing.

This was disappointing. The lime sour cream was good, but the bean patties were dry and didn't have as much flavor as I expected. I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I would add a lot more cumin and garlic (believe it or not). Unfortunately, these don't make good leftovers either.
