Very Good & Easy.  You can make the filling ahead of time. I have made this recipe several times and it is always a big hit.

I have made these countless times. I have found that if you double the filling and spray the wontons with cooking spray BEFORE you fill and bake them, they are SOOOO GOOD! I also bake them at 375 degrees for a little less time. I have used yogurt in place of the mayo.

I found this recipe a while back and people always ask me to bring it. I've never had trouble with my wontons being too hard when I baked them like another memeber had posted. I have also made these ahead of time and reheated them in the oven and they taste just as good as if they were fresh. One thing I do do differently is I use 1 can of crab meat when I double this and I also use Mayo not miracle whip.. Very Very good recipe for get togethers oh and I make sweet and sour sauce 1 to go with them

I have made this many times and always get request for the recipe. I make mine into pockets by folding over into envelopes. These reheat well. I have never had them get hard. You can drop them into frying oil to reheat but this adds to calorie count!

I served this at a party and the platter was quickly emptied. I made as directed except I followed another reviewer's advice and baked the empty wontons wrapper in the mini muffin pans for about 8 minutes. Bake again after you fill them. I only used a spoonful for each shell and there was enough filling for 24 shells. Don't forget to make a sweet N sour dip to go with it.

Easy to make and pretty to look at, but that's the best this has going for it. Being easy to make is not enough to call something great. What did this really need?  The fat, flavor and crispiness of deep frying!  Edible but not a suitable "rangoon" surrogate.

These were good, but I will use less Miricle Whip next time.  That flavor was a little too much for me.  

This also has much more crab than a typical Chinese restaurant crab rangoon.  So if you want more of that style, I would half the crab.

These were very easy and delicious. My only complaint was that the bottoms got very greasy, but that's probably because I used regular cream cheese & mayo, both very fatty ingredients!

While the flavor of this was great, the texture wasn't.  Maybe since I made these ahead of time so I wouldn't be preparing while my guests where there is why.  The wontons got soggy, not crispy.  Probably won't make this again.

I don't think wonton wrappers were meant to be baked.   Mine turned out all hard and inedible.  The filling was pretty tasty but I think next time I will fry these.

I just made these..I cook the wontons at first without the filling for about 4 min or til edges start to brown..I used regular crm.cheese, imitation crab meat, cut small, a little mayo(only a little cause mayo kinda overpowers it if you use too much!!), Some shred. cheese, and a few I added a bit of cream cheese w/ chives(which I preferered over the regular..) I liked it and my 12 year old son ate 4!!Mine was crunchy so i don't know why peeps say it's soggy..

I found these to be very bland, but that's just me! Second batch was done with precooked wonton wrappers, about 6-7 mins.  Added to the cream cheese mixture was lemon juice, Old Bay, hot sauce, dill, black pepper and more seafood seasoning.  Baked for 8 minutes more and they were the biggest hit of the party!  I had tons of filling leftover, so I toasted some baguettes, topped with the crab mix and some cheese.  Awesome!!  Good base recipe for tweaking!

It's crab rangoon-ish, but definitely not the real deal. I so wanted it to be too, because it is so easy. I did half the crab meat as others suggesting, but I don't think making it to recipe would have helped. The Miracle Whip messes up the flavor I think. The shells are what's really off. I tried the muffin pans, triangle folds, the little flower folds like most restaurants do. Nothing made it taste right. I'm thinking there's no way around frying them unless you're willing to compromise on the taste and you expectations of what crab rangoon should be.

These are pretty good, but I would leave out the miracle whip & add a splash of soy sauce. Top with a dollop of sweet & sour sauce & you won't even miss the fried version!

Read existing reviews noting complaints and suggestions.  I used mini-muffin tins, sprayed a non-stick spray on each and was able to close the wonton to create wonton most like the "fried" ones without the guilt!

I tried it because it is baked instead of fried.  Big mistake.  THE Won-ton wraps were as hard and tasteless as cardboard.  I even cut down the baking time by three minutes.  The filling was very good, using mayo instead of miracle whip.  I made a second batch, using the tiny frozen salad shrimp, and fine choped chives.  GREAT filling, and less expensive, too.

I only gave this 3 stars for the following reasons: I did not care for the miracle whip (I should have heeded the warnings - bad me!- and used sour cream or mayonnaise instead) and added sugar. Also, I just folded mine into little rangoons-not in cupcake pans, added sugar (I like mine a little sweet), and I put them on broil for a few minutes. These definitely have the potential to be good. I did not have a problem with the texture of the wontons as some. With the changes of the mayo instead of miracle whip and added sugar. I would make these again, however, of course, they're no fried goodenss of the chinese buffet, lol.

these were good! i did both the mini muffin style and also baked folded over like a mini turnover.  I liked the folded over better (will fry next time as well).  I might use the imitation shredded crab next time instead of canned.  The crab flavor was really mild using the canned.  I will make again giving it my own twists!

I have made this for baby showers, holiday parties, and appetizers to Asian meals. I always get complimented on them, but they're so easy and much healthier than the traditional fried wontons. I have found they even turn out well with fat free cream cheese and light miracle whip. I serve them with a side of dipping sauce and there's never one left over. Very tasty, pretty, and health conscious. I highly recommend. Best when hot from the oven!

I thought these were great. I love the fact that they turned out crispy but I didnt have to fry them. Very easy to make as well. I added some Old Bay seasoning to mine and used regular mayo instead of Miracle Whip, since I dont like it. Will definitely make again.

These were a huge hit at our New Year's Eve party.  And they were sooo easy to make.  I was able to make several more than the recipe indicated, which was great!

These were pretty good and easy.  I do think they would be better fried, but they were still very tasty. They were a bit soggy on the bottom but that is to be expected.

My husband couldn't get enough of these when I made them. They made me sick because I ate too many. I'm not big on seafood but these were delicious. I just found the wontons were a little crispy where the points stuck out. Maybe next time I will brush them with butter.

Very, very good!  My wife loves crab rangoon, and this recipe worked well at home.

used 3 or 4 green onions and mayo instead of mircle whip, some garlic powder and hot sauce, put a dash of hot sauce on top when serving for a kick.next time I'm going to try herbed creamed cheese

These were pretty good for what they are - baked crab rangoons!  They'll never match up to the deep fried ones, but still made a nice casual appetizer.  I made a few as stated, but also wanted to experiment making the normal triangle shaped ones, as well as "purse" shaped where the corners of the wonton wrapper are pinched together around the filling.  The filling leaked out of both of those a bit, but they still tasted good.  Next time I'll just follow recipe as stated, as those turned out the best. And no problem for me as far as wontons getting too hard - they were crispy, but not hard.
