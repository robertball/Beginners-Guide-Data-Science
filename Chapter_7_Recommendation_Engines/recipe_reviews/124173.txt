Great recipe!! I did add to the dish. I didn't have leftover chicken so I pan fried with a little olive oil two small chicken breasts seasoned with garlic powder and pepper. Cooled and chopped.  Also I used a small onion, chopped and 1 small pablano pepper, chopped.  Then I added 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning.  Also, I had a Mexican cheese blend that I thought would be good. Be sure to bake the pie crust until it is lightly golden brown, this add a crunch to the dish. Really yummy!!! Served with pinto beans and a small green salad. Thanks for a great Tex-Mex pie.

I thought this was fair... for all the calories, I probably would choose to make something else next time.

This tasted very good, my husband and I both had seconds and my 7 yr old cleaned her plate. It was very easy and quick to make.

Delisious!  Could you maybe had some other veggies to it?    It's great none the less!  I used a thawed 9 inch pie crust but even a homemade pie crust would work.  It really doesn't have to be "baked" before you add all the mix into it.  It does bake in the 25 to 30 minutes time.  Not sure what the author meant.  SUPER SUPPER!

I really liked this recipe.  Mine was a little soupy, but perhaps this is because I used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and light sour cream.  I also added taco seasoning, so I appreciated that comment from the other user.  Sorry--I'm not a mushroom lover, so I substituted a mixture of sauteed red pepper, red onion and green pepper instead.  I will make this again.

This recipe was just OK.  Boyfriend liked it and would give it 4 stars.  I thought it was missing something.  You want to cook your pie shell about half way then put the filling in.
