I have tried and made many different hummus recipes.  And by far this is the best ever.  It is really really good. It deserves more than 5 stars!!

I make a new type of hummus almost every week for my husband. I rarely eat any, but he eats it all. He says this doesn't taste like any one thing, but it isn't very hummus-y. Having been married a long time, I can translate that to mean: "Where's the garlic?". If I were to make this one again, I would definitely add 3-4 cloves of garlic, minced. Thanks for the recipe!

I had to try this just to see how maple syrup would taste. I really modified this recipie though; omitted fennel, tahini and yeast. It still turned out pretty good. The maple adds an interesting tone to it.

Great smelling hummus, and I like the color, too!  I had just finished drying my tomatoes when I tried some of them out in this recipe!  I omitted the maple syrup because I thought it would be too sweet!  This is delicious!

I'm so disappointed! This recipe sounded so good and I followed this recipe to the letter but it was so thick it burned out my blender motor. I then used a small food processor and didn't have much better luck. I kept having to add more lemon juice, olive oil and tablespoon after tablespoon of water. It was awful to smell and taste. I really don't know what went wrong.

The color is beautiful.  I'm okay with the maple syrup but but the fennel makes it a little weird. I like the idea of skipping the fennel and syrup and adding a little garlic. Next time.
