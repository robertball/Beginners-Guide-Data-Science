I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe! This is the only way that I make my Tiramisu. Sometimes I use cocoa powder in place of the grated chocolate. What originally attracted me to this recipe many years ago, was that it does not use eggs...This is the BEST! :)

Easy and turned out great. The only thing is: I had to use more than 8 oz of espresso because ladyfingers absorb liquid very quickly. I'm not sure I would use so much espresso next time. Maybe next time I would even do one layer soaked (like the bottom layer) and the second layer unsoaked because although I love espresso it was slightly overpowering. It still gets five stars because it is so incredibly easy with no baking required. Can't beat that!

So good, we loved it! I only needed 1 oz of chocolate. I think I would've preferred cocoa powder overall though. Will definitely make again, thanks for sharing!

This IS the classic Tiramisu recipe...except the chocolate should be substituted with cocoa as some have mentioned. But this is by far the BEST Tiramisu ever (and I've made & eaten many)

PS...If your ladyfingers are too soggy then you are letting them soak in the espresso too long. They are like sponges so just dip them for a few seconds.

Recipe was easy to follow.   I sprinkled cocoa over the entire top quite liberally, giving it a  great presentation. Decadent. I will definitely make it again.

SO delicious! It was a huge hit at my dinner party, everyone was asking for the recipe. The only thing i changed was using cocoa powder instead of the grated chocolate which i think made it more authentic.

Excellent easy recipe. I did change to Tia Maria instead of the amaretto. I like the added smooth coffee flavor it adds!
