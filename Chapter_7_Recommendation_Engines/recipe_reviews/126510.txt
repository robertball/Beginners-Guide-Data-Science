Gorgeous fudge I love it, I did think that it may have been better if there was more of the butterscotch.  It was quite difficult to cover the chocolate layer.  Next time I will double the amount.  Also allow a little time for the chocolate layer to cool before adding the butterscotch layer.  I allowed 15 minutes in the fridge, but this was not enough as the chocolate layer was lifting when I was trying to spread the butterscotch.  I don't like nuts so I used heath's toffee bits as a sub.  Good overall fudge, just know I will me making this again.

I wasn't crazy about this. It lacks that pure, melt-in-your-mouth texture you can only get from butter. It's almost a little rubbery although fully edible. But if you're a bit of a purist about fudge, I'd suggest trying a more traditional recipe.

Easy to make, hubby really enjoyed these.  Might save a little more of the condensed milk for the butterscotch half next time as it was rather thick.

I used white chocolate and omitted the nuts--the results were fantastic.  I used my stove instead of the microwave.

I made this for Christmas around the same time that I had made a Cappucino Fudge from Annie's eats blog . I must say that the texture of fudge that is made with marshmellow cream is so much better, it's silky and smooth, this fudge not so much. It's okay, and I did get some complements on it but I'll stick with the Annie's eats recipe.

This recipe is so quick and easy.  The end result is a great fudge that isn't too sweet to eat.  The butterscotch makes it awesome.  I used whole pecans in my chocolate layer instead.  This is a holiday keeper!

Amazing!  Super Easy!  I was short on time so I put it in the freezer for the first hour and then the refrigerator for the last hour. :)  Still came out great!  I'm also reccomending this to my friend's daughter for her class bake sales.

Of course, I'm sure all fudge is delicious. The two-toned colour of this fudge is eye-catching. I substituted the semisweet chocolate chips for semisweet Baker's chocolate (1 cup chocolate chips = 6 oz Baker's chocolate). It was easy and sweet. NOTE: the second time I made it, I didn't stir too much once the chocolate was almost melted, and it turned out much creamier.

Lauren loves. Did toffee instead of walnut. I'd like to try caramel. And I like my fudge a little softer.  Made with little caramel balls and oh so good.   Best at room temp after chilled.
