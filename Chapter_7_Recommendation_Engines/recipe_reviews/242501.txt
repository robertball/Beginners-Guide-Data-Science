I made this and let the sirloin marinade for 8 hrs. The sirloin came out full of flavor and tender.

Tried with a few variations - sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, pineapple,  etc. Turned out OK. This is a good recipe to 'wing it'; different fruits and vegetables also work IMO.

Cut Onions in eighths  instead of slices and added quartered potatoes I had parboiled. Enjoyed.

I omitted the  mushrooms and used only red and orange bell pepper with red onions on the skewers. Absolutely delicious! Hubby loves them!

Followed as written  with no changes.  Vegetables  absorbed the flavor better than the  sirloin .  Husband  didn't care for it.  Might try fresh minced ginger next time with marinating  all day instead of 4 hours.

Fast and easy.  I used bourbon marinaded sirloin from Food City.  I substituted olive oil for the veg oil.  Brushed this marinade on while grilling keeping everything moist.  Turned out GREAT.  We will use this one again.
