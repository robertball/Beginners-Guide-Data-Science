Cake very moist. I found it excessively sweet with the two cups of sugar. I will make it again adjusting the quantity of sugar probably by half.

Very moist and sweet.  My husband and I enjoyed it, but were a bit surprised by the cake consistency...ours turned out almost like what you'd expect from pecan pie.  Don't forget to add the sugar in with the other ingredients!

I wasnt very happy with this recipe. I was so excited to make it because how great it looked and the reviews were positive. I found it having a bland taste, it was very gritty/crumbly. the topping was great though. it added flaver to the top of the cake when it sunk in. The icing didnt really wow me. I tasted a bit of it once creamed together, I felt the need to add a bit of milk to it. Then I heated it for about 45 seconds in the microwave. But my husband and I only ate one piece each.  I was going to recommend this to my sister but not now.

My co-worker brought this cake in to work, it was so good I asked for the recipe. It's heavenly! She did say she'd cut the sugar down next time (it is very rich and can cover the apple flavor), but the mixture that you pour in to the cake is so delicious and gives the cake this melted coffee-cake topping crunchiness on the edges. Also, she added milk to the icing, since the mayo and vanilla aren't enough to make the glaze.

The directions don't tell you to add the sugar. And it is on the ingredients list. And the icing needed milk to make it smooth.  I added 2 tsp. Vanilla and 1tsp. Mayonnaise and 2 cups of powdered sugar.

This cake is an over kill.  It was so sweet that we didn't really eat much of it. The cake is good but not great and the additional saucing is not good and not necessary.
