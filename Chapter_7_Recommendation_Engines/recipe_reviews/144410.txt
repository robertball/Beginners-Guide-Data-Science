I am giving this recipe 4 stars with the following modifications.  1.  you do not need to boil the vegetables just be sure to cut the fennel thin and add it first to be sure it ends up being tender.  You can also use frozen beans.  2. Do not use 1/4 cup of oil, I think it was way too much. 3. 2 min prior to turning off the stove add the basil with sun-dried tomatoes in oil.  4.  serve and add feta cheese (a little goes a long way) I just used 2tablespoons.  Look forward to making this again!

This recipe was fabulous- can be a side or a full meal.  I added two small cloves of fresh garlic and minced onion for added flavor (since I can't have pepper).

The fennel, basil, and feta combined perfectly in this dish. The market didn't have green beans, so I used swiss chard instead. I sauted the fennel without boiling it, and it still came out nice and tender. I think this would work well with any green veggie--asparagus, spinach, etc.

Great side dish for Thanksgiving or any  meal! I tripled the recipe for our large group.  Everyone loved this!  The flavors work perfectly together and would be a great accompaniment to just about any meat.  I had to use 2 skillets due to the amount I made, but it worked out fine.  I had to make them a little ahead of time, so after boiling, draining & then tossing with olive oil & sauteing, I transferred to a large baking dish, covered with foil & kept warm in the oven for about 20 min.  Just before serving I sprinkled with the basil & feta and it worked out fine.  Will definitely make this again!

So easy to prepare, and it tasted as good as it looked. Great way to get your veggies! (I subbed Pam for the olive oil to cut down fat and used dried basil instead of fresh and it was still a total hit.) Will definitely make this again!

I just "discovered" fennel and this is the first recipe I've tried. It's wonderful! We've had it 3 times in the last couple of weeks and it's always delicious. Goes especially well with sausage or pork chops. A keeper!

we both really really enjoyed this and its our favorite green bean recipe. we dont really like green beans or licorish (fenel) but we loved this dish. adding tomatoes at the end is a must, and it doesnt need that much cheese.

This was very good.  My husband who usually likes only the basic of ingredients in a food even enjoyed them.  The only problem I had was the amount of olive oil seemed to be a bit much so next time I will cut it down.  But other than that good job!

This recipe is so special that we felt like we were eating at a gourmet restaurant.  I used fresh beans, basil and fennel from the garden.  I had been looking for recipies to use the fennel and this one will be a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

There is not many recipes for cooked fennel but I love this vegetable and enjoyed this recipe since it keeps the lovely flavour of the fennel intact. Everybody at the family gathering loved it and came for seconds.

I added ground turkey seasoned with salt, pepper, and sauteed with garlic. Then I added this all on top of a bed of penne. The resulting olive oil sauce was very good so I wouldn't decrease the amount of olive oil suggested.

This was my first time eating fennel. Recipe is a great way to use it! I did add some sliced tomatos in the last step and they added a great color and taste. Not sure I will make this often as I don't usually have fresh green beans or fennel but definitely something for a special occasion.

I will have to make it a second and third time to really review it well, since I modified it a lot the first time, but I can't wait, because fennel and basil with fresh green beans is WONDERFUL, and the feta cheese was a big hit.  I used fennel seed and dried basil, so let me get back to you.....

This was my first time cooking with fennel and this was amazing! I added 3 baby bok choys to this in addition to the fennel and green beans since I had some leftover that needed using up. Highly recommend this recipe and will definitely make again!

I'm always looking for great healthy side dishes. This is a winner!  Boiling the vegetables softens them nicely . I use very little olive oil to save calories . Think stir fry. Low calorie , great flavor, high nutrients, and even my teenager likes it. Tip: don't tell them it's fennel until they've eaten it.

These were good. I did not have fennel so I would bet they are better with that ingredient. I am going to try this recipe again when I have some.

I'm new to fennel. I was disappointed when it smelled like licorice because I don't care for licorice. But after it all cooked together, WOW, what a nice surprise! I didn't add the cheese because I'm lactose intolerant, but it didn't even need it. I leave out a star because I wish the recipe had given more information and specifics about chopping the fennel. I went too far up the stalk and it got a bit stringy. With that said, it was totally worth it. I ate over half of the batch for lunch by myself. I will definitely make this again and maybe even to impress someone for a nice dinner!

Easy to make and SO good! I used garlic and herb feta to add a little more flavor :)
