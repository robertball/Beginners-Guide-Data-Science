Very simple and very tasty!  I recommend putting the filling mixture in a large ziplock bag and cutting a corner off so you have a "pastry bag" type thing to pipe the filling in.

A WINNER! I made only a few chamges....I used 2 jars of sauce in their entirety; halved the amount of spinach called for and added a half pound of sweet Italian sausage (crumbled and browned)to the filling.  We are hosting a dinner party next month and this recipe will be on the menu for sure.  My Italian husband pronounced this a "keeper" (trust me, HIGH praise!).

Came out perfect.......way easier than trying to stuff cooked shells with filling. Also, to make it easier on me I put filling ingredients in a zip lock bag, snip one corner with the scissors and squeeze into the shells.

Recipe was easy, the sugar must have brought out the cheese flavor??  I used a combination of ricotta and cottage cheese and used only about 8 oz of spinach and more sauce.  I also made a whole bunch of "make ahead" by stuffing the manicotti and kept them in the plastic tray that came with the manicotti and into ziplock bags.  I left the make ahead stuff (without the tomato sauce) in the fridge overnight and then put them in the freezer.  To rehead: take out the frozen manicotti and cover it in the tomato sauce the evening before to let it thraw and cook it according to the recipe direction, my husband and his family raved about it, even the kids ate it!

This is a wonderful recipe. I would suggest, depending on your taste buds, decide if you would prefer a sweeter Manicotti or not, the sugar did not agree with my taste for Manicotti. If people think it has a bland taste, it not just about the taste, it's supposed to be mild on flavor. It's more about texture. I added Cottage cheese, because my hubby loves it. And I could see from the start that one jar of sauce just wouldn't due. I love lots of sauce so I used two. I noticed that the spinach kept the mixture moister longer, so this is good recipe for a nice moist Manicotti. I pre-boiled my noodles as well, for about 3-5 min. to get them prep and ready (I was in a rush to get it done).  The noodles were still hard enough for me to put the mixture in. I used one of those cake-frosting bags. I was nervous about that and by the end there was a bit of a mess, but I got those shells full! :) I would make this again without the sugar completely and use more cheese!! Lots more!! To thicken the sauce, add a little Parmesan before you put it in the oven to bake. Don't forget the Italian sausage. I bake those before I bake the Manicotti. This way you don't have unwanted grease in your Manicotti. After I take the cover off I bake the sausage with the Manicotti for the 15 minutes. Yummy!!

I was VERY disappointed with this dish!  Served it last night for dinner guests, and was sad to see they didn't clean their plates!  I found this dish to be dry.  The long cooking time is required to cook the noodles, but by the time the noodles are done, the sauce and filling was dry and crusty.  THUMBS DOWN...

I loved this recipe! It takes just a few minutes to prepare and stuff the shells and best of all it doesn't create a huge mess in the kitchen if you do it before bed like I did. Like another person said, I would add more sauce as it cooks because the noodles on the outside got a bit tough. It called for 12 shells and I used the entire package as there were only a few more than 12 and I had plenty of the cheese mixture. For those not so fond of spinach, like my husband, he recommends using half the spinach or better yet none. He thought it would have been good with just the cheese mixture and then adding ground beef to the sauce. So next time I make this, I might split the cheese mixture in half and use spinach only on my half. I could make 2 dishes with half spinach and half plain cheese and try freezing one. This is also a great dish if you need to deliver a meal to someone in snap.

Awesome!  I made this the night before (and used 1.5 jars of sauce, and half the spinach, as some recomended). We had company over and there was nothing but positive comments! The ziploc was also a great idea!  This is 100% a winner!! Will make again, and again...

Average.  Sugar made it too sweet and I would cut back a little on the spinach.  Use plenty of sauce as it tends to be dry.

This was nice and easy.  I used mild Italian sausage but will use HOT Italian next time because it turned out a little bland.  This was good manicotti - not excellent - but I gave it four stars becuase it was so quick and easy and you can make it a day ahead of time if you know that you're going to be in a pinch.

This was SO GREAT!  I have been searching for 'make ahead' meals, and this one tops the list.  I put it together Monday evening (took 15 minutes tops- only things I altered was adding a pint of small curd cottage cheese and omitting the sugar...ended up making enough manicotti to freeze half for a meal later on!), then put it in the fridge.  Tuesday afternoon I called my son, who was already home, had him place it in the oven and turn it on.  By the time I got home, it was 15 minutes til done- just enough time to throw a salad together!  Tasted just like my mom's manicotti, and it's very similar to her recipe- I just never knew it could be so easy and that you didn't have to boil the noodles first.  This will probably be a once a month meal for me (and we'll actually get TWO meals out of it, I love it!!)
Thanks for the great, easy recipe!!

I like the idea of preparing it the night before and throwing it in the oven. I gave it 4 stars b/c it was too sweet. I will try it again, but reduce the amount of sugar at least by half.

Made this for Christmas Eve for the family.  Nice and easy.  I made it the morning and cooked it at night.  Easy to do, tastes great.  Needs more sauce though than what the recipe calls for if you want it to stay moist baking.

I tripled the recipe and put two in the freezer so I got a "three-fer" for almost the same amount of work!

The only thing I did differently was to leave out the salt and sugar, since most jarred spaghetti sauces contain plenty. I used Prego - their regular ol' flavor that comes in a Costco-sized jar - and the taste was just right for my family.

This was just plain "OK." I think the amount of spinach is just fine if you like spinach like we do. The problem I found was that it is bland. I would maybe add some chopped garlic to the cheese mixture and perhaps some parsley too. A little more salt as well. With those changes in mind, I would make it again.

I tried this with low-fat ricotta and was excited to make and eat it - I thought the sugar would give it a different flavor.  Well - it was different, but neither my husband or I cared for the extra sweetness.  Next time I'll do without the sugar.  Thanks, though.

I've tried this with manicotti shells and for making stuffed shells and prefer the stuffed shells but either way is delicious.  I've used fresh grated Parmesan and the stuff from the can and it's great either way, I just use mozzarella on top if I'm using the canned stuff.  I love making a double batch the night before we have company coming and so I can focus on other things the day people arrive and just pop this in the oven for dinner.  Normally when I ask my husband what to make for dinner he'll say something along the lines of "I don't know, everything you make is good" but this is one dish he will consistantly request if it's been a while since I last made it.

So good.  Although I didn't go by the recipe I still loved it.  I went by other reviewers tips and cooked the shells first, stuffed shells and cooked right after adding everthing to the casserole dish.  I was VERY pleased with the resaults.

A great idea, and I will probably make something like this again, but I found it really lacking in taste. It needs garlic, onion, and more parmesan, at least. You can't rely on the sauce alone for flavour.

Loved this recipe.. Like others that tried it, agree with these of the Make Ahead Manicotti.. I made a double batch and used spinach in half.. Used home made sauce.. and a pastry bag to fill.. Easy.. Used the sugar but think I will omit it next time do to my sauce had a tad bit of sweet flavor already.. I used half of ricotta and half cottage cheese.. Taste was wonderful.  I am going to serve some tonight and then freeze the rest.. Thanks for posting this..

Spend a little time making your own shells and it will go a very very very long way in improving your manicotti.  get rid of the sugar its totally unecessary.  If you have lots of time get a store bought sauce and a smaler piece of pork and simmer the sauce with the piece of pork in it for a few hours.  Then you will  have REAL MANICOTTI!  Good quick version though, minus the sugar.

Excellent! I've served it for multiple crowds and it always get good reviews. I like it because it can be made ahead of time so the work and the mess is done before your guests show up. It also freezes well but be prepared, as it takes about twice as long to cook when frozen. 

My tweaks include: using 2 jars of sauce, not quite as much spinach, added mushrooms (canned or fresh), and lighten up with skim ricotta, egg substitute and reduced fat mozarella. In a pinch I've used shells rather than manicotti tubes.

I may have done something wrong but my pasta stayed hard and chewy/crunchy.  I would make this again but boil the pasta first.  My other complaint is that it was kind of bland for us.  I love spinach and the flavor was not bad at all, just not very exciting.

We love this meal!  It's easy to make and delicious.  I do suggest putting more sauce on the bottom so it won't burn.

I took the advice of others and used half the spinach and double the sauce, and this was delicious!  I have now shared this recipe with many others who have then shared it with even more people and everybody loves it.  I poured a few spoonfuls of Alfredo sauce over the tomato sauce to give it a bit of a "blush" taste...MMMM good!!

This was certainly easy enough. I left out the spinach because my family doesn't care for it. I also omitted the sugar and it was not missed. I did find the manicotti shells to still be a little gummy even after baking for an hour. I used two jars of sauce so it was all well covered. Wouldn't stop me from making it again though.

Loved it! I made mine the night before then just popped it in the oven an hour before dinner.  Super easy and very tasty.  I took the advice of others and put the filling in a ziploc bag so I could pipe it into the shells.

This recipe is so incredibly good!  My husband loved, loved, loved this recipe.  I did not have manicotti at hand so I made a "lasagna rolls" version. Amazing!

This technique makes this ideal for midweek meals. I used freshly grated parmesan instead of the stuff in the bags. If you don't want to deal with stuffing manicotti, just switch to shells.

Delicious -- super easy to make and enjoyed by all.   I used a generic brand spaghetti sauce with it and it was awesome served with breadsticks.

Fantastic recipe! I'm in charge of the menu at the adult foster care house I work at and this is a favorite there.  The staff loves it because I make it in advance, so it's easy for them... all they have to do is toss it in the oven.  There are never any left overs when this dish is served.

This is sooo tasty.  I added lots of sauce and seasoning to the sauce because I just don't like sauce straight from the jar.  But WOW, I will make this more often.  I made the manicotti on Tuesday afternoon and cooked it Thursday evening.  You have to try it.  I put parm and mozzarella on the top.

I L-O-V-E this recipe!  I use fresh spinach, add mushrooms and play with different types of cheeses and shells.  Always tastes great.  I recommend pre-boiling the shells.  This is a good company dish - looks elegant.

What a terrific, simple recipe.  My first time making any sort of baked pasta, and this turned out fabulous - it was completely devoured, despite that the number of servings far outnumbered the number of guests!  Instead of frozen spinach, I used fresh, bagged spinach (rinsed, spun, and then shredded small by hand), but only about 2/3 of the 10 oz package.  Aside from that I followed the recipe exactly, and it was exactly as good as I could have hoped.  Simply great! :)

I really liked this recipe, although I think I will reduce the spinach next time.  I loved not having to cook the noodles, and the end product was delicious.

Growing up I've always loved stuffed shells. But I only made them on special occasions because of all the work. Now, with this recipe, I've already made this meal over and over. It makes about 30 shells. I use two jars of sauce. Each person usually eats about 5 shells. And the next week, it's such a treat to have as leftovers. When reheating, I add half a jar of sauce ontop along with some fresh parm. cheese. Great with garlic bread and salad. I already have people asking me for this recipe! Thanks for sharing it. A+++++!

Loved this! It was so easy and as I had never attempted to make Manicotti before I was kind of nervous. I shouldn't have worried though as the results were awesome and very filling. My whole family and a couple of passing friends gave this a serious thumbs up tonight. I made 12 but put some in the freezer as was suggested by another reviewer. I also added chopped mushrooms to the mix and I think that helped with it feeling as though it had more body. 

Would recommend this dish and eat it eat any day of the week!

A nice do-ahead dish. I followed others advice and added a bit more sauce. Also, I forgot the spinach, but added a bit of fresh fennel and oregano.

This recipe was wonderful! The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because I did have to add some things to the sauce to make sure it stayed "saucy" enough after cooking.  I used 1 jar spaghetti sauce, 1 small can tomato paste, 1 can diced tomatoes with the juice.  This made for perfectly cooked noodles, and plenty of sauce left after cooking.  I left out the spinach, added the entire 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese to the mixture and put mozzarella cheese on top instead of the Parmesan.  My family LOVED this!  This is a keeper, and will be made again and again!!

This is the most ingenious recipe.  I always hated how manicotti got really watery after baking if I boiled the noodles first.  Not only are the uncooked noodles easier to pipe into, they hold up after baking.  The refrigeration allows the flavors to meld, and gives a finished restaurant quality product.  My husband and I are vegetarian, so we add morningstar crumbles to the sauce before baking and this makes for a hearty dish that please both veggies and non-veggies alike.  The spinach mixture would make an excellent lasagna as well.

I love spinach, but my son and husband do not, so I made half with spinach, and half with ground beef.  I cooked a pound of ground beef.  When I made the filling, I split it in half.  I put in half the cooked beef in one half of the filling, and put in half the spinach called for in the recipe in the other half.  I put the remainder of the cooked beef in the sauce.  I used more cheese than called for in the recipe, and also used 2 jars of sauce as others had suggested.  To fill the tubes, I put the fillings in the plastic bags, which worked well - be sure to cut only a small hole in the corner.  I enjoyed making this in the morning, then only having to pop it in the oven in the evening.  Served with a green salad and garlic bread.  Yum!

I made this recipe in large quantities and it turned out very well.  I gave it 4 *'s because like other reviewers, I thought it needed more sauce (which I added).  I froze it before baking, and next time I would add even more sauce towards the end of the baking time because the top of the shells got hard.

Great recipe and easy to make. I do us fresh chopped spinach for taste and texture. Also I split the manicotti before filling them, using a ziplock bag. There easier to fill with pre measured amount of filling and then roll up like a Cannelloni.
Thaks for the recipe Sandir. iota

A keeper.  I used halved the number of shells, and the amount of ricotta and spinach. I added half a pound of sausage.  I had plenty of sauce with one jar.  A good make ahead dish.

This were pretty good.  I have used other better manicotti recipes in the past.  Although it requires another step I think pre-boiling noodles is needed.  These just seemed too dry with a bit too much spinach.  Don't plan on trying these again.

My fiance and I both loved this recipe; the ricotta stuffing is especially flavorful as pointed out by my finace who said he is used to bland fillings.  Tips: I would definitely use the plastic bag idea since stuffing the manicotti is the only tricky part of the recipe.  I also used a lot of pasta sauce as suggested by others so there was no problem with it sticking.  I also added some minced garlic to the ricotta filling and sprinkled additional parmesan and mozzarella on the manicotti during the last fifteen minutes of baking.  Definitely a keeper!!

Really good!  I've made this many times now.  I like to add some cooked chicken breast and definitely a little minced garlic.  Use a gallon ziploc bag with the corner cut out as a disposable pastry bag to make it clean and easy to fill the shells.  I always use part-skim mozzarella and the lower fat ricotta and get a very creamy, tasty result.  Some reviewers complained of the pasta not being soft enough.  If you make sure that you really cover it with enough sauce you won't have a problem. You will need 1 1/2 jars to do this.  You've got to make it ahead and let it sit in the fridge.  If you bake it right away the pasta will be tough.   Great to have a recipe I can throw together in the morning, come home and put in the oven, go to watch my son play high school sports, come home and serve!

I really loved this recipe. It was very quick and easy. I had plenty of filling for 14 manicottis instead of 12. Use lots of spaghetti sauce though. I didn't use enough on the bottom and it stuck to the pan but it didn't burn. It is a very filling and satisfying meal. It made the whole house smell wonderful. Add garlic bread, a salad, some wine and you have a terrific meal.

GREAT CHOICE!!!I mixed all of the ingredients in the morning and let them sit in the fridge while we were running errands.  The slight firmness made stuffing the shells easier, and splitting up the time preparing was nice. Used jumbo shells instead of the manicotti shells.  Used a bit less spinach then the receipe called for.  I made the Penne Vodka Red Sauce instead of store bought sauce.  It was awesome.  Will make again and adapt part of it in my lasagna.

I have to agree with other reviewers that stuffing an uncooked manicotti shell is much easier than stuffing a cooked one.  But even after sitting in my fridge overnight and most of the following day, the edges of these were still hard after baking.  I think that you really need to drown the manicotti in the sauce in order to get all of the shell to be soft.  We cut a little of the edge off, and every other part was devoured.  My kids loved these.  One other change I made was to add in some fresh spinach that I sliced very thinly and then added to the cheese mixture.  My kids didn't even know it was there, and it was an easy and delicious way to add some green to their meal.

I accidentally added more salt than the recipe called for, so that was my own fault but this dish was absolutely delicious!  I was afraid of not cooking the manicotti first but it cooked perfectly in the ovn :@)

I had some filling left over from another recipe and so i found this recipe...it was still the same filling, spinach, ricotta, eggs, etc.

i thought it came out good. i did follow the suggestion of prefilling the manicotti and freezing it until later use for the following week. i just took out of the freezer and put in the tray and covered and baked...it did take a little bit longer to bake, but was good overall and great to do ahead and on a busy weeknight.

Make sure to use enough sauce. Mine came out a little tough. But the flavor of the filling was delicious and a great way to make my hubby eat spinach.

This didn't work out for me. I think my mistake was that I used a sweet basil sauce and that, coupled with the sugar, made for a too sweet dish. The noodles didn't cook well either--they turned out a bit gummy (the sauce covered the noodles well).

I have made this twice so far and received rave reviews each time!  I added a little more sauce than called for and used two different kinds in one dish: four cheese and garlic.  I also added about 1 extra cup of mozzarella.  We are cheese lovers over here!  :)

This was good, but a little dry.
I always make my manicotti or lasagna with raw pasta, it just seems to save that step.
I would mkae again, but add more sauce.

My husband loved this! It is very easy to prepare and has great flavor. Another reviewer had said that it could be frozen, so I did just that with half of the recipe and it tasted fine. Not great, but good enough when time is running thin.

Yum! I made a few alterations, I cooked my noodles first, because I was in a hurry to get dinner on the table.  I also used cottage cheese rather than ricotta because my husband prefers it that way.

This is truly one of the easiest recipes I have made.  It appears you put a lot of work into it but you really didn't.  The taste is exceptional.  My whole family thought it was great!  The tip about using a plastic bag, removing the air, and cutting the tip off to fill the shells is a lifesaver!  No mess.

I have an Italian friend that told me to use egg roll wrappers instead of pasta shells.. It works "fantastico".. Just put the amount filling you want and roll.. Bake with the seam side down.. Quick and easy.. I did delete the sugar.

I really liked this recipe.  It was easy to make a day ahead and then cook when you wanted it.  Not sure it was anything special, but a good solid manicotti meal.  Hubby said it was better than my lasagna.  Only thing I did different was add more ricotta in mix and add moz cheese on top with parm.  Anyway, thumbs up.

Very yummy.  I added a bit of water to my sauce before pouring onto the noodles, and did not have any problems with it drying out.  So much easier than making manicotti with cooked noodles...I'll never do it that way again!

This is a keeper recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except threw in some extra cottage cheese that I needed to use up and it turned out fabulous.  I doubled up the ingredients so I could freeze some for later.  
Put them on a cookie sheet to allow them to freeze and then put them into gallon bags so I could pull out what I needed for that specific occasion.  
Great way to get your kids to eat vegis too!

This was awesome and really easy!  I consider myself and intermediate cooker and this was wonderful!  My husband loved it also and neither of us eat spinach. (We used it though) He thinks he has to have meat in everything too.  I used meat flavored Ragu.

This recipe was excellent. My family enjoyed it and are asking for it again. There were very few leftovers that were devoured the next day! I made the manicotti the day before, sprinkled the parmesan on it and popped it in the oven. Quick and easy for a busy week night. Thanks for the yummy recipe. I will make it again very soon!

The first time I made this.. it was perfect. The second time I decided to change things around a little (added more spinich, cheese, etc.) and it turned out just okay. A little time consuming.. but worth the effort!

This recipe was definitely a hit with me and my family!!  The prep was easy!  I did follow the suggestion of a few other reviewers and used 2 jars of sauce, and I am glad that I did!  One jar never would have covered it.  I also ommitted the spinach and added 1 lb of lean browned ground beef as I am feeding two men that want their meat!  They both loved it and this recipe has become a staple...I have to make it at least twice a month!!  Thanks for the recipe and all the great suggestions from the other reviewers!

I really liked this & so did my Mother in law.  My husband did not like as much & says to stick with the stuffed shells recipe that I got from this website.  Next time I make, I will use more sauce as 1 jar didn't seem to be enough, reduce the ricotta, add more motzarella & bake for a little less time.  That may make it more cheesy & more saucy.  Overall I really did like this dish & would make again!  My husband is not a big Italian fan.  He said this seeemed like a dish you would get in a restaraunt, I see this as a compliment!

This is a great time saving recipe.  I don't like cooked spinach that much and I LOVE this recipe! Here are my "tweaks" to offer: 1) I add crumbled and browned italian sausage (turkey or pork) to the mix to make it more substantial since my guy likes to have meat on the table! 2) I definitely think it needs the extra sauce. I use 1.5 jars. Using the jumbo pasta shells makes this the simplest recipe ever. I usually make this on Sunday night when making Sunday dinner so that Monday night's dinner is a no-brainer!!  Oh -- thanks to my bookclub friend Misty for passing this along!!!

I was in a rush, so I cooked the shells and tried to stuff. Stupid idea because I made a mess! Also added italian sausage and my family really enjoyed it.  Will make again. Thanks!

I loved this!  It made me feel like an all-star chef!  I used swiss cheese instead of mozzarella and I added onions and minced garlic!  I appreciated the idea to use a ziploc bag to fill the shells and I thought they were full...but they still came out flat...and the recommended amount of sauce wasn't sufficient - especially for the bottom since some of my shells (the ones on the outer edges) stuck to the foil.  But in all, a great recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing!!

This dish is very good and an excellent make ahead meal.  I used one baking dish but poured spaghetti sauce on one side and alfredo sauce on the other side.  My dinner guests liked both, but the alfredo sauce side was a hit.

It was delicious! I used a sweet marinara sauce with it to compliment the sweetness of the manicotti. It has a very different taste which is refreshing.  I used a zip lock bag to put the filling in which was much easier than any other way.

I added a pound of ground beef to the filling and boiled the shells for 2 to 3 minutes.  Next time I will take others advice and use more sauce.

Great recipe! I had enough filling to fill some extra shells. I wasn't too sure how they would freeze but decided to try it. They freeze beautifully! Next time I will double the filling mixture and freeze some shells to have on hand for even quicker prep.

Wonderful dish that will make company think you slaved in the kitchen! Even my carnivorous husband loved it. One tip- use a slender baby spoon to stuff the manicotti.

Wow, my whole family loved this.  There were no leftover to be found.  Using additional sauce did keep the shells from drying out.  This is a keeper for us.  So easy to make up on Sunday and then bake later in the week.

I thought this had good flavor.  I love that it can be made ahead- I made it the night before and it turned out perfect.  I doubled the recipe and used 3 jars of spaghetti sauce.  I also substituted cottage cheese for ricotta (nobody in my family likes it) and added a pound of hamburger and a pound of mild Italian Sausage.  It may have been too much meat as I had quite a bit of filling left over for a lasagna.

I have used this recipe twice now and it is awesome.  It is quick and simple for mom's who have their hands full!!  Added suggestion..  add meat to your mixture..  cook ground beef or mild italian sausage and don't forget the garlic!  It comes out real rich and tasty!!  The family loves it!

My daughter is starting to like spinach. Since I put the spinach mixture in a baggie and cut the tip, my daughter enjoys stuffing the mixture into the manicotti!

I substituted browned ground beef for the spinach in this dish and it tasted great. I also sprinkled some mozzarella on top along with the parmesan. It's a keeper.

Tastes good, easy to prepare but mine didn't look very nice. I would never serve to company. I put some extra sauce over the manicotti to hide the pasta because they collapsed.

First of all, I ended up with a bowl of extra filling.  Luckily I had extra manicotti shells (I adjusted the recipe for 9 servings, meaning 18 shells.  I used 23 shells and still had enough for a few more!)  Secondly, it wasn't very flavorful.  I realize that had a lot to do with the plain store-bought sauce.  But plain store-bought sauce is what makes this convenient and you don't want to start changing that around, so something else should have been done to add more flavor.  I will probably make this again with the modification of (1) less filling ingredients and (2) adding some fresh garlic and maybe even jarred pesto to the filling to bulk up the flavor.  It was nice to do a make-ahead, though.

Meh. This was so-so. Both my hubs and I thought this was edible, but agreed that we'd pass on ever having it again. Oddly, this reminded me of all the frozen (manicotti) entree's I've tried in the past that I didn't like one bit. All the reviews are right - OMIT THE SUGAR! It gives the pasta a sweet taste that just doesn't belong (as subtle as it was). I BY FAR prefer my Pampered Chef florentine stuffed shells recipe. It takes a little work to prepare, but is OH SOOOO GOOD!!! Since I like idea of stuffing uncooked pasta shells (it makes filling a LOT easier!), I might give this another chance using my PC stuffed shells filling recipe instead. NOTE: A few reviewers suggested using a large Zip-Lock bag to "pipe" your filling into each manicotti shell. I agree. Simply snip the corner and use it as a pastry bag. A simple garden salad and garlic bread rounded out our weeknight meal. Maybe this will float your boat, but it left us sorely disappointed. Thanks anyways, Sandir. :-)

I absolutely loved this recipe!  How easy to make ahead and throw in the oven later for an easy dinner.  I don't think I'll use the sugar next time, but other than that, it was very good.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I also added 1/2 lb of Italian sausage, as well as using about 1 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce, and then about 2/3 spinach. I boiled the noodles for about 4 minutes... that might have been too long b/c some fell apart, but when they are baked, they kind of fall apart anyway. I baked them for 30 min covered, and 10 min uncovered. Delicious!

I made this for my boyfriend's family (all 10 of us) so I had to double the recipe... They aren't huge eaters but we barely had enough... if you want to make this for a large group plan for 2 1/2 times the normal amount! Other then that, everyone LOVED it! I did take the other user's advice and cut back a little on the spiniach and then went overboard on the sauce (a good thing to do). It really was such a simple recipe that looked and tasted amazing!

When a recipe gets so many good reviews, and then I don't really like it - I assume I did something wrong.  However, I just didn't care for this recipe, and do have a different "no boil" recipe I like, so probably won't make this one again.  Husband pronounced it "good".

This is the recipe my college daughter misses most about not living at home anymore.  I do use it as a basic guideline. For example, she likes me to increase the sugar and to add Italian sausage. I omit the spinach.  I have also learned, over the years of making this, that I don’t have to use the egg mixed with ricotta and it tastes just fine.  As it is written, the recipe is superb. For my daughter’s tastes, I made the modifications above.  This recipe is so easy to pop in the oven after a long day. The younger kids like to help stuff the shells the night before.  I also highly recommend Paul Newman’s Sockarooni sauce to top this with in your dish.

I used 2 jars of spaghetti sause (I like the Prego Farmers Market) and used a little more mozzarella in the mixture.  I also needed it for that evening so I baked at 350 degrees for an hour.  This was so good. Even reheated the next day was just as good.

I made a double recipe for a potluck. Everyone enjoyed it, not a speck of leftovers to bring home.
Problem, frozen spinach tasted like weeds and too much stems, am I too picky ?
I made again tonight using fresh spinach trimmed off stems with scissors,, cooked in a dry skillet. Used home made spaghetti sauce with Italian sausage.
Pretty good ! ??

This is a great recipe.  I hate trying to get the cheese into a cooked shell.  I just used 2 jars (24 oz) of sauce so that the shells would cook and soften totally and it worked like a charm. I only put it in the refrigerator for about 3 hours as I did not read the instructions too closely.  I guess I missed the "make ahead" part.  It didn't matter.   My husband loves cheese manicotti and he was thrilled that I finally found a great recipe for it! And BTW, I use an iced tea spoon to put the filling in the shells.  It works like a charm.  I fill one end and the fill the other until the manicotti is filled.  Very simple.

I loved this recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing.   I did run into a problem piping the cheese into the pasta.  It's hard to do one handed with a plastic bag and the filling is pretty thick, so it can pop a weak bag.  I bought a piping kit which is really pretty cheap to find on Amazon for less than $20.

The recipe turned out great and the dish was delicious. Even though I used smoked Gauda cheese with the Mozzarella it was still amazing. I sense I will be making this once again in the future.

My family prefers their manicotti saucy, so I added a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce with sautéed onion and garlic,  and added basil and oregano to the jar of prepared pasta sauce.  This has become a family favorite.

I love manicotti so much, and I'm so excited to finally have a way to make it so we can have it on a weeknight! This recipe was almost perfect. The only thing I would change would be to not add the sugar, or at least not as much; I really didn't like the sweetness. And maybe add a clove of crushed garlic. Definitely put it in a ziploc bag and pipe in the filling; much easier!

So good!  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and only put 1/2 tablespoon of sugar in the filling and it came out great!  The only other change I made was to add less spinach than called for.  I will definitely make this again and again!

This was a big hit with family and extended family.  I only used 1/2 the spinach and I think it was the perfect amount.

This was excellent!  I also used extra sauce and it was easy and wonderful.

I love this recipe! It was delicious the first day and the second day! I did use extra spaghetti sauce, I used 2 jars of 16 oz instead of 1 like it says, only because I didn't want the noodles to be dry.My husband loved it too, that does say a lot! This sure will be a recipe I use over and over again!!

Yum!  Took this to an office potluck and it was a big hit.  Made some extra for my family....my 4-year old, who doesn't eat anything, enjoyed it, and my hubby, who doesn't like spinach, loved it as well.  Thanks!
