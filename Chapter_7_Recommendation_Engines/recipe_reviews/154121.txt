My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  I doubled it, using 1lb ground bison and 1lb ground turkey.  Everything else was the same.  I was going to take leftovers to my parents house for dinner, but there wasn't enough to take!  Very good.

This was good.  I didn't find an anaheim pepper, so I used 1/2 a jalapeno and 3/4 a green pepper.  It was a bit too spicy.  Next time I think I'll leave the jalapeno out.  It was a little too overpowering.  We tried this a second time and substituted a cubanelle for an anaheim pepper.  It was good, but still a bit spicy.  I think next time I will cut back on the red pepper flakes a bit.  My two young children thought this was too spicy.
I have made this many times and have made changes to suit our taste.  I use a cubanelle pepper, a poblano pepper, a banana pepper, and a bell pepper.  I use a bit less than 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.
Note: 1/28/17. Doubled.  1 T chili powder.  1/2 tsp crushed pepper. 1 1/2 tsp cumin.  1/4 tsp cayenne   1 cubanelle.  1 banana pepper.  1 green pepper.  1 Anaheim pepper.  1 orange pepper.  2 onions.  Black beans instead of chili beans

Great chili!  I used buffalo, but this recipe is perfectly suited for any game meat or even regular burger, not just buffalo.  I shortened the cook time by using the stove top rather than a crock pot.  I simmered it in a large pot for about 45 min and it was perfect.  My biggest surprise was that it wasn't as hot as anticipated, but I should point out there is an error in the ingredients list. I followed what was written in step one and went from there.

This was delicious. I'd give this a five, but I'm not sure how it would've been if I'd spiced it up as much as the recipe called for. With a baby in the house, I thought it best to tone it down a bit. :)  Otherwise, fabulous!

I don't know how you could say this didn't have much bite.  I made a double batch, and while I doubled most of the spices, I stopped at one poblano and one Anaheim pepper (both fairly large).  Even so, I added more tomatoes (sans chilies) to turn down the heat.  We have a small chili cook off with friends on an annual basis, and I took first place with this tonight!

Great Recipe. I doubled the batch using one pound of Bison and one pound of lean ground hamburger. I took it to a large Super Bowl party where they had a chili contest (18 entries) and won first prize. The cumin is listed twice on the recipe. I used 1 tsp of cumin for the two pounds of meat (double recipe)

Couldn't get buffalo at my store, so made with beef. Husband said it tasted like Stagg chili (which to him is a good thing.)

This is very good chili.  I got about 7 servings out of the recipe (1 cup per serving).   Not sure how the nutritional data came up with such a low calorie and fat amount, but it's still acceptable to the diet.

This was very good.  The only changes I made was using a jalapeno because there were no Anaheim chiles and I cooked it on the stove because I didn't realize it was for a slow cooker.  All the better!  I served it over rice.

Absolutely deelish!  My favorite chili recipe I've ever tried.  Good enough to show off to company for sure!  I didn't change much other than tossing in a few dashes of my favorite hot sauce and I doubled the garlic.  We cleaned out the slow cooker with this stuff.

This is a fantastic recipe, and I don't normally like chili. We didn't have to change a thing. It has been added to the winter rotation.

Definitely a keeper! I made this chili tonight. The only thing I did differently was to make it on the stovetop, like another reviewer did. It was so good, I had seconds! I can't wait to try it tomorrow, since it's supposed to taste even better the next day. I wanted to point out, like a couple other reviewers, I thought there were typos in the ingredients list. This is not true. If you read the directions, you will see.

I used 2 anaheim chiles, 1 jalapeno, and added a small, diced zucchini at the end.  Besides a bit of salt, this chili had a great taste.  My husband has informed me, it is now part of the repetoire.

Wow, this chili is awesome! I did not have the green chilis on hand, but I know this chili will be made even better when I make it next time. I added a full onion and much more garlic. I also topped with cheddar cheese and some chips from the bottom of the bag.  This chili is awesome and very filling!

Really like this recipe. I omitted the Anaheim and as I enjoy a little more heat, substituted a serrano pepper and added 2 t. of paprika for added color/flavor. I cook it on the stovetop; simmering for an hour after browning the bison and adding the remaining ingredients. Without the beans, though. Real Texas red NEVER has beans in it!
It is a good, easy and quick recipe. Try it!

Great recipe. The Poblano pepper really gives this chili a great flavor. The only thing I added was a  jalapeno pepper and a little water as the mixture ended up being a little thick.  I also used all organic hot chili, and kidney beans instead of regular. I also used organic tomato paste instead of Soup to cut down on the sodium.

This is great recipe! I had to use hamburger instead of buffalo and tangerine tomato (orange tomato) soup instead of regular tomato soup. It was so good and I'm sure it would have been even better with the ingredients for which the recipe called.

A big hit with my bison loving family!  I eliminated beans and doubled bison, due to a food allergy. I also cut back on the chiles, as I am overruled 4/5 in my house regarding spiciness.  We served the chili over pasta, with toppings. It was easy and delicious!

This was a great hit.  This isn't a real spicy chili recipe on its own, but since its chili, that is quite easily adjusted as necessary.  Also, keep in mind buffalo is typically more lean than beef, so be a bit more attentive than you would ground beef, unless you're well acquanted with buffalo.

Thank you Cornpop, we loved this recipe! I made it as described with the exception of black beans, I did it unplanned and for some reason I had none. I substituted frozen black eyed peas. Also, I used a bit more onion and garlic for personal preference and I had frozen some fire roasted poblano and Anaheim chilies that I used instead of fresh. I thought the seasoning was spot on but spicy is good in my house.I served it with cilantro, sour cream, and a bit more diced fresh onion. So very good and even better leftover!

This was surprisingly awesome.  I was worried that it would be too spicy, but it actually turned out to be perfect ... a nice amount of heat but it did not overwhelm the flavor.  I think the cumin gave it a nice smokey flavor too. The only thing I changed was I used a full onion and 2 anaheims instead of 1 anaheim, 1 poblano.  Came out great.

This was quite good, even though using what I had on hand did change it. In the first place, I NEVER use canned soup...too many carbs. I added a jalapeño per another's suggestion and left out the red pepper flakes. Added Emeril's essence. Instead of the soup, I used diced organic tomatoes and a bit of tomato paste. The taste was surprising. I will definitely make this again.

We made this recipe for a neighborhood chili cook off...and won! Lightened up on the cayenne pepper, since we we were catering to an unknown variety of palates. Will make again! I’m already eyeing a chili cook off at work....

This was great and easy. I made some adaptations bc my husband is dairy free and my son is 5 years old. I used a large can of diced tomatoes and added 2 T of Ghee instead of using Tomato Soup, which I couldn't quickly find without dairy or some other ingredient he can't eat. I also refrained from adding the chili powder or the cayenne so I could taste it first and make sure my little boy would eat it. It's honestly great without that added spice so I left it as is. Also, I cooked it in about 45 mins on the stove as well...following another reviewers suggestion. I find my crockpot makes my ground meat crumbly sometimes in a way I don't like. So I prefer the quicker method.

This was surprisingly disappointing.  I rarely say that, but after 8 hrs in the crockpot, my canned beans were too mushy and there was an odd vinegar flavor.  I was bummed since it was my first bison chili.  Tomato soup didn't seem like the best option for the tomato base.  I won't do that again either.  Tomato sauce is a much richer option.

I made this recipe in the crock pot, using a can of mixed beans and a can of black beans for the beans & a can of stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato soup. I served the chili with a dollop of sour cream and freshly diced tomatoes on top.  My boyfriend loved it and said it could be in a restaurant, it was so good.

I love this chili. It's not very spicy as written, but the flavor is great. If your store doesn't have poblano peppers, you can use pasilla peppers instead. Though the names are sometimes used interchangeably (like sweet potatoes and yams), they're not the same thing, but they're close enough.

I add habanero hot sauce at the end to get the desired level of spiciness, so I have more control over it. I recommend Desert Creatures Black Widow’s Kiss hot sauce, which I buy online. It's very hot, so you don't need to use much, and it has a great flavor. I don't recommend Tabasco, or any other hot sauce that's more vinegar than heat. I want the chili to taste spicy, not taste like vinegar. If you'd prefer to use fresh peppers for the spiciness, you can add a diced jalapeno at the beginning of cooking for a little kick.

I've made this with ground bison, but I've also used ground beef. I prefer it with bison, but only slightly, and both versions are delicious.

I always double this recipe; the recipe as written probably only feeds three adults and this is delicious the second day anyway.

I only used one quarter of the two peppers in this. And I added one cup of Shiner. And it was awesome. I am truly truly thankful. I won the freakin chilli cookoff at my church. Thanks again. I'm getting the app to this site if you have one.
