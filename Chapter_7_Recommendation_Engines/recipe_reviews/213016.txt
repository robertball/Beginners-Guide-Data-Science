I made this tonight for a special meal for my husband. The flavoring was very good, but I was surprised at just how much pasta was in this dish. I might try customizing it with more sausage and celery, but overall it was very warm, very spicy and an excellent blend. Very filling. I used regular hot sausage. The seasoning was perfect. I made garlic bread to go with it, which fit nicely. Thanks for the holiday submission!

DELICIOUS!  I substituted hot Italian venison sausage for the turkey sausage, but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  It was fantastic and the leftovers were even better!  Disregard the other reviews that say it is just okay and give it a try; you won't be sorry!!

This was really good!  The only thing I changed was adding a small can of tomato sauce to the broth, because I knew my husband wouldn't like the tomato chunks, and then a little bit of pepper.

This is a great recipe for something fast, healthy, tasty, and inexpensive.  It was very tasty, though not AMAZING, if you know what I mean. I will certainly be making it again, though. I added some kale I had so as to have a green vegetable in the meal, and it went well. Be sure you have a big enough skillet! This recipe really does have 6 servings.

This is a really good recipe. I did not give it five stars because that rating should be saved for a knock your socks off dish. It had good flavor and I liked the components of this dish.

This recipe was pretty good but I know why it calls for low sodium broth.  Too salty...  Oops.

Really delicious with a 6 oz can of tomato paste & mild sausage!  I used about half the pasta recommended & the dish turned out really well.

Very good! I used regular Hot Italian Sausage which spiced it up a bit. Good way to get those New year's Black Eyed Peas.

I changed some ingredients to this recipe due to leftovers that were in the fridge. Instead of pasta, I used white rice. Also, I used the standard Italian seasoning instead of oregano. I bought frozen peas and cooked them with the onions and some minced garlic. Just before the peas were done, I sauteed Kielbasa sausage instead of the hot sausage, with the diced tomatoes and more seasoning. I did not buy the low sodium chicken broth but it was not too salty. In fact, I used more minced garlic in the sausage mixture. When all this was done, I mixed it all together in a large pot. My husband (he doesn't like the peas) and I enjoyed this meal a lot. Even my husband liked it! It was something different for the traditional black eyed peas meal and left some for the next day.

I LOVED this recipe!!! I have a ton of black eyed peas leftover from our church pot luck, so I've been scouring the internet for recipes to use them in. This is a winner!

I used the 8 oz. of pasta like the recipe called for, and I thought it was just right (I actually probably used a little more). I broke each into 4 pieces.

The only differences I made was to use Kielbasa and tomato sauce, since I didn't have those specific ingredients. Yum!

I used mild italian sausage and left out the celery just because I didn't have any but otherwise followed the recipe.  It made a very tasty meal...and clean-up was a breeze since it only dirtied up one pan to make this!

I was so nervous on how this would taste because I accidentally bought regular chicken broth instead low sodium and some reviewers complained of saltiness. So I diluted the stock (60%broth/40%water) and it turned out great!  That's the only change I made. Hubby says it's a keeper.

My 12 yo son went crazy over this.  He said it could be a lot worse, but still be really good... hmm, I'll take it.   I used regular Italian sausage and added red pepper flakes for some heat.  I used angel hair pasta and simmered it, covered, until the broth was mostly all soaked up.

This was really good! My husband even commented that he liked it, which is rare. I used Italian beef sausage instead of turkey.
