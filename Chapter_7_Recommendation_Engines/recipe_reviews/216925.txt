Made with Sirloin Tip so the kids would eat it.  Made a great stew with a combination of favors.  Easily enough for two meals for a family.  Served with soda bread.  Thanks for the recipe.  The fire-roasted tomatoes add more than plain tomatoes.

Wow!  Amazing.  It has so many layers of flavors.  I would definitely make this again.  We did use lamb, but I think it would be just as good with beef, however my husband disagrees with me ; )  
One change we made is that we only used about half the rutabaga.  Once we got it all chopped it was just so much and didn't look like all that chopped rutabaga belonged in the stew!  We used the fire-roasted tomatoes that the recipe also calls for and I do like some kick to my stews, so we really enjoyed it, but if you don't like spice, then use a can of regular diced tomatoes.
One more thing... it needs a bit more juice or water.  Ours was really thick.
I can see this recipe becoming a family favorite.  Thanks so much for creating it JG!

I questioned the addition of rutabaga...and I'm a big fan of rutabagas...and cut down to half the amount called for.  I found myself picking out the rutabagas and set aside to eat separately.  The rest was very good but just can't give it 5 stars...sorry.

I made this tonight. It was really excellent. I made the following modifications: I used 3lbs of bone-in lamb stew meat. I put the salt and pepper into a Ziploc bag with 1/2 cup of flour and shook the meat cubes in it and knocking off the excess before browning in the bacon drippings.  I omitted the tomatoes and oregano. I used 1/2 the amount of mushrooms and 1/2 the amount of barley. I used very small baby red potatoes which I left whole rather than cubing. I added 1/2 cup of home-made demiglace when I put in the broth, for color and richness. For the thickening slurry at the end I used some of the leftover seasoned dredging flour to mix with the reserved Guinness. 2 tablespoons was enough since the barley has some thickening action. The lamb got so tender  most of it fell of the bones making it easier to eat. My girlfriend's mother came to dinner and had seconds, which is rare for her. Even with 3 of us eating two servings each, we have plenty of leftovers. I will make this again.

This was a wonderful hearty meal! I used parsnips in place of the rutabaga and fire roasted red peppers in place of the tomatoes and reduced the barley to 2/3 cup. I will certainly make this again it was a huge hit!

Went to the butcher and got fresh lamb and some good Irish beer, made a loaf of Irish potato bread and we had a great meal. I would recommend this to anyone, we had our good friends over for supper and they loved it.

My husband gave me grief about buying lamb because it's so expensive where we live, but after having this stew he asked me to make it again 2 days later, but with even more lamb.  It was a huge hit with everyone, will be making this again & again!  Thank you so much for sharing!

The final product was pretty tasty, but this recipe is somewhat labor-intensive for a one-pot meal.  This was a hearty and satisfying meal in the end, and the leftovers were great heated up for lunch the next day.

I can't believe I haven't rated this before now. My family loves this stew. It has become an annual St. Patrick's meal, along with Guinness cupcakes. No changes required.  Sometimes I'll buy bone-in chops, brown the bone with the meat, and simmer the stew with the bone to get the rich marrow flavor as well. It's definitely not a requirement, though.

This was really good, even after I made a bunch of alterations.  I didn't know I was making this until I decided to make it at like 5:30 pm. Lol. Anyway, no Guinness/equivalent, so I used a hawaiian IPA. Used dried herbs. Boyfriend can't have onion or garlic;  subbed chives and a drizzle of garlic flavored oil. Didn't have called for tomatoes; used rehular canned ones. Boyfriend also can't have barley,  so I subbed in rice. Didn't have a rutabaga (& don't personally care for rutabaga in general), so I subbed in about 1/4 of a celeriac. I didn't even need to thicken the stew. It's so good my boyfriend went out of his way to walk across the house and tell me. ?

Outstanding!!  This was not only my first experience cooking with lamb, but it was my first time every eating lamb.  I wanted a hearty stew to serve 8 guests that we were having over for dinner.  This one looked the most appetizing and the ingredients were mostly things I had on hand, with the exception of the lamb and the rutagaga.  This meal was a huge hit, from the very minute everyone walked in and inhaled the incredible aroma coming from he kitchen.  I would make this again in a heartbeat and I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks, JG, for making my first taste of lamb such a memorable one!

This was excellent! We left out the rutabagas and added a bit more potato. We also used some San Marzano tomatoes we had on hand instead of the fire roasted tomatoes. And, we used dried herbs instead of fresh, as we also already had those on hand. We did not add the flour at the end, but the broth still had a nice thickness from the barley. We used a nice coffee porter from a local brewery instead of Guiness. All in all very tasty!

Anything that gets my lamb hating family to eat lamb (told them it was beef) gets 2 thumbs up. Amazing flavors. For those that think it's a lot of work all I can say is that's how you get all those amazing flavors . Sure you can dump it all in a pot at once but it's NOT going to have all that flavor.

This was perfect for a chilly day.  I had some leftover flat milk stout and this was perfect way to use it.  I added a couple sweet potatoes as well.

I totally skipped all the directions and threw all the ingredients in the pressure cooker.  Omitted rutebaga and mushrooms added a few more carrots and potatoes.  Used sweet white onion, fire roasted tomatoes with garlic and 2 T rosemary garlic seasoning mix.  Oh yeah, also shortcut with the beef stock, just added 5 cubes beef bouillon and water to cover instead of stock.  No beer on hand, but added 1 c. White wine.  Also bought quick barley by mistake but it was fine.  Delicious and a nice change from the usual beef stew I make this time of year.

Great taste and ingredient list. I forewent the rutabaga because i didnt have it on hand.  I would be interested in finding a less labor intensive way to prepare.  Maybe by using a slow cooker.  I will play with this recipe again but taste 5* steps/work/wait 3*.

Wow! This was terrific! Hearty and very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, only subbing 2 Parsnips for the Rutabaga cause that's what I had on hand. Used Lamb Seasoning from Penzys on the farm fresh lamb stew meat I had.

Excellent! I had a few variations which didn't detract from the dish: didn't have bacon but used a little bacon fat, dried herbs instead of fresh, didn't have pearl barley on hand, I used the full amount of Irish turnip (like rutabaga) and even added a small parsnip and more carrots, ordinary chopped tomatoes. The Irish stout was great. The sauce tasted bitter to begin with but after a long slow cook it was perfect. This is a keeper - and will replace all my other Irish stew recipes. Thanks for sharing.

Never follow a recipe exactly but this was delicious. Hearty stew for a cold winter night. Family said it is definitely a repeat meal.
