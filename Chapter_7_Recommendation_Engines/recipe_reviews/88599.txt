My boyfriend said that this recipe is "the perfect blend between sweet and spicy."  Also, it is lovely on the bed of fresh lettuce leaves.

I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this is a delicious dish! Somehow all those ingredients worked. As is, I give it 4 stars. With the following adjustments we agreed that it would be a 5... added a little pineapple juice to the dressing, too thick to "drizzle" otherwise. Sprinkled some cajun snack mix over the top to add some crunch as it is a very wet salad. My dad also thought adding some sunflower seeds might be a good addition, although we did not try it. Definitely recommend this, it was a hit!

This was pretty tasty!  I halved the recipe and even then used only an 11 oz. bag of lettuce; I'm glad I didn't use more lettuce because it would have been sort of dry.  I was leery of the ingredients, but the taste was good.  Made it for Mardi Gras dinner, and I'll probably make it again in the future.

This was really good and different. I served it to go with red beans and rice. It was a great meal.

Loved this! I even added some of the pineapple juice to the dressing and it really fit everything together! I may add more things to the salad now after trying it, but I loved it!

This was a good recipe.  Not too spicy, but nice flavor.
