I can’t thank you enough, Chef.  My first time making homemade phyllo, and it was perfect.  I picked up a package of store-bought phyllo and it was full of undesirable ingredients; I feel much better using this recipe.  I couldn’t believe that the circles didn’t stick to each other while rolling them out together.  Thanks for giving me the confidence to do something that I’ve been putting off for years.

It was like magic! I always hate admitting I can't make something by having to buy it every time, and if I knew phyllo dough could be so easy I would have stopped buying it ages ago.  The video was perfect too: very helpful, not too fast-paced or painfully slow and entertaining. I made it to use in Bulgarian Banitsa in honor of Baba Marta and my husband was very pleased. So was I! My brother also loves Eastern European cuisine and cooking and when I sent him a picture of my hand through the dough he was satisfactorily envious. :)

This was surprisingy simple enough. I didnt even have cornstarch on hand so I rolled the sheets with plenty of plain flour for dusting. As a result, I couldnt go as far as I'd have liked but now I know the recipe and technique works as stated, and I dont know why I waited so long to try homemade phyllo.

Wasn’t as flakey as I’d like for pot pie, but it definitely tasted great! Maybe I should roll even thinner next time!
