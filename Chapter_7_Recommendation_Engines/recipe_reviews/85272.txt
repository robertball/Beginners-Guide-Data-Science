A good basic coffee cake recipe that should be in everyone's file.   Made as directed (fruit added to taste) it works well.  Cannot understand how a recipe can be rated when someone takes is apart by the seams and doesn't even follow it. Sorry to complain, but this is annoying.

Ok, so I made so many changes, but it turned out great, so I will share them all. First, for the cake, I used 1/2 cup of un-diluted frozen orange juice concentrate. I creamed that in with the butter, sugar, and eggs. I also added a couple tsps of vanilla at this point. I increased the sugar to 3/4 cup, because I used frozen cranberrys as the fruit, and as we all know, they can be VERY tart. I used sour cream instead of yogurt because it's all I had on hand. Finally, I stired the frozen cranberrys (About 1 cup) right in to the batter. I greased a spring form pan, and poured the batter into it. I creamed the cream cheese mixture together as directed and poured that over the batter. I added some nutmeg and probably twice as much butter as called for to the crumb topping, and sprinkled that on the top. (Note: next time I make it I will deffinetly use white sugar instead of brown for the crumb topping) I baked it at 350 for probably 45-60 mins. Once out of the oven, let cool for at least an hour before removing the outer part of the spring form pan if you choose to use it. It works wonderfuly, but needs time to set. Anyway, turned out FAB! Served it with some good vanilla ice cream, and every one LOVED it! Play with this recipe to make it work for you. It's deffinetly worth it! :)

There is a problem with the directions of this recipe.  Step 5 should read:  Beat in half the dry ingredients, followed by half the yogurt. Beat in the remaining dry ingredients, then the remaining yogurt.

I made it using orange marmalade for the fruit filling and overall it was pretty good.  I will make it again.

I will not be making this again. I pretty much followed the recipe, but I added some vanilla and butter flavoring to the cake part, because other cooks said it was bland. It wasn't bland so much as it was  crusty and I had thought it would be cakey. The cream cheese filling was good, and it did set as it cooled, not runny at all, in fact I could have cooked it less and it would have been fine. The crumb topping wasn't very crumbly; the butter just absorbed the flour until it was a paste. Cinnamon and brown sugar were not the right offsets to the flavor of the cream cheese. I would instead sprinkle the cake with powdered sugar a la Entenmenns cream cheese coffee cake. I may try the filling with another coffee cake recipe, or i will just keep looking.

Not always a successful baker, so followed the recipe EXACTLY using the fruit preserves and cream cheese options. Turned out perfect. Guest loved the crumbles on top nice and plentiful.

I was scared to try this, but glad I did!  It is SO good!  I brought it to easter breakfast and everyone loved it!  I was very nervous when spreading the batter onto the foil, it seemed very sticky, but I went for it anyway, and it turned out beautifully!  This is a real keeper and I will be making it again.  Everyone was impressed!

The cheese is the best part, I will propably make this again with a different batter. I always think coffeecake relies too much on the topping for flavor, so I always add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and I did one and half on the cheese filling with chocolate chips on one side and cherry preserves on the other.  Note about preserves - the amount listed may not provide much flavor.  I would suggest fruit instead, frozen, fresh, or re-hydrated. Ditto other's comments on the topping burning. The batter cooked up fine, but was so thick I had trouble getting it in the pan.

This was a rich coffee cake, and very good. I used chocolate chips for the flavor layer, and oats in the topping. Next time I'll try it with jam. 
The crumble topping is delicious, but burns very easily, so be careful. The cream cheese layer is wonderful, and almost makes the cake taste like a chess square. A note about the cake batter: it will be very thick and seem almost too dry when you are mixing it, but will bake up nicely. The cake itself is moist when it is served hot, but does dry out quickly. That's OK, just serve it with coffee!

i agree that it's not right to review a recipe if you don't make it according to specs. i'm not a pro at cooking but i depend on recipes and the reviews. but when the reviews are more ??? then the original recipe i get frustrated. but this recipe is great and in my basics-which a newcomer like me needs. i wish tho that if the recipe is doubled then the cook time reflected that. i so get that mustered. i have a house full of boys that are very patient with my cooking but they eat more than most of the recipes serving size!! BUT THEY LOVED THIS!! i love it when i get it right!!! i doubled the recipe and cooked just til it stopped wiggling when i shook the pan. NOTHING LEFT FOR BREAKFAST--WOOHOO!!!!!!

This turned out great but I had to cook it over 60 minutes.  I used vanilla yogurt because that's what I had.  I would have added vanilla to the cake batter if I had used plain yogurt.  Also, rather than jam, I used frozen raspberries and mashed them a bit (less sugar that way and saves my precious homemade jam for a more worthy use).  Oh, and I skipped all the extra work with the foil and served it straight out of the 9x9 pan.

Great coffeecake. Here are the options I used: 1/2 cup oatmeal & about 1/4 cup roughly chopped walnuts (nuts added BIG flavor), 1/3 less fat cream cheese (no problems) & for the optional fruit filling, I used about 85 grams blackberries. (Because they were frozen, I tossed them in a bit of corn starch & a pinch of nutmeg & chopped them up. (My note for next time is to add a bit of orange zest to the blackberries.)  I baked it in a 9-inch springform cake sprayed with Pam (no sticking problems).  I definitely felt it was bakery quality & company worthy.  Thanks!

Fantastic coffeecake! I used cream cheese and toasted almonds as my variation, and there were no breakfast leftovers.

As others have said the cheese is great!  However the batter is lacking in flavor and moisture.  The crumble is good if you don't melt the butter just soften it. I will definitely use the cream cheese filling again I might try to adjust some ingredients to get the batter moist.

This was fantastic!! I made some peach compote to put on the cream cheese filling layer and it turned out to be the best desert I've ever made. My mom and I were instantly discussing what other kinds of compote we could put in this delicious dish!

Amazing and simple.  I made the recipe without any changes and used applebutter for my fruit.  My husband is begging me to make it again!  We (just the two of us) ate almost all of it in one sitting!

This was a huge hit in my office! (TGIF Cake!) The cream cheese filling was amazing, and I used a homemade strawberry/pineapple jam. I did add a bit of cinnamon to the cake batter, too, based on other reviews of cake being bland. I did not find it to be bland at all. My one complaint was that after cooking for 45 mins, the cake was still runny according to my fork test. So I left it in longer and the sides and top ended up a little too done, while the middle is still a bit soft. Probably because I only had an 8" square pan, not a 9"... next time I will either get a new pan, or lower the oven temp and bake longer.

I made this today, adding optional ingredients of chopped almonds in the crumb topping, cream cheese filling and raspberry/strawberry fruit and preserves. I did not understand why the recipe did not call to add the yogurt and all the other wet ingredients to the creamed butter/sugar/egg mixture, so I did it anyways. Then I mixed all the dry ingredients together and added them to the wet ones. There didn't seem like there was much of a batter layer, but it fluffed up very nicely once baked! I thought this was tasty but could have been better if there was some sort of spice added to the batter. The toppings were good, but the cake while light and fluffy, was kind of bland. I will make this again, but alter it by adding sour cream instead of yogurt, and I will make sure I add cinnamon, nutmeg, and maybe some candied minced ginger.

The concept of this coffee cake was good, but the cake portion is to dry for my family's taste. Chilling overnight resulted in a bit more moist cake, but still not what I was hoping for. I followed the recipe as written except that I added some fresh raspberries to the cream cheese layer since we had those on hand.

Soooo good! I used all the filling options, and definitely think they're all needed for full flavor (beware though: give yourself a solid couple hours from start to finish!). The only thing I would change would be to add an all-over layer of raspberry preserves (or whatever the cook chooses for that layer), rather than just dollops. This layer brings out the refreshing aspect of the coffee cake, and helps balance the cream cheese and cake layers. Also, I only baked for a half hour, but my oven is pretty hot. And next time I would use the foil technique, just so the cake doesn't keep cooking once it's taken out of the oven.

The crumble topping is good. The cream cheese topping is good. I used raspberry preserves, which was perfect. The cake was a disappointment though. It's really dense and low on flavor. I added 1/2 cup more white sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon to the mix but it didn't help. I'm not sure how to fix the cake mix but I will try the recipe again someday with some modifications.

I am not a great baker however this turned out beautifully.  Follow the directions exactly and it is a winner.  7/10 ~ to add folks love the crumble topping so I use it all the time with any recipes that call for it.

I love this recipe the combinations are endless! I used the oatmeal in the crumble topping. I actually ran out of cinnamon so I used a packet of cinnamon spice instant oatmeal and it worked great! For the filling I did the cream cheese filling with raspberry preserves and chocolate chips because raspberry and chocolate is a favorite combo of mine. It came out delicious definitely a keeper next time I will try a different variation. This coffeecake would even be good just with the crumble topping and basic batter as well.

I often dissect this recipe and use the crumble topping for pies and muffins.  The flavor combination is really well done for this recipe.

My whole family loved this cake!  it came out great and was very moist.  I did make a couple alterations, I decided to make it strawberry banana flavored so I used strawberry creamcheese for the filling and instead of plain yogart I used strawberry banana, also I mashed up a banana and added it directly to the batter with the yogart rather than on top of the creamcheese.  It was very delicious!

This is awesome.  All you have to do is use your imagination.  You can incorporate different flours, different cream cheese fats ie. non or 1/3 or full, You can incorporate different fruits, nut butters, jellies.....It is all up to you .  I love this recipe.

The cake portion was dry and flavorless, the cream cheese was grainy after baked.  Getting it out of the tinfoil was near impossible.  Safe yourself the time and effort.

I thought this was rather bland, and was disappointed that I couldn't really taste the cream cheese filling as much as I would have liked.  Lots of work.  I did substitute a half cup of sour cream for the yogurt, since I didn't have any yogurt on hand.  It was a moist, if bland, coffee cake.

Followed recipe almost exactly - didn’t have yogurt so I used sour cream and baked it in a springform pan.  The choices I used were oatmeal and cherry preserves.  I will definitely make this again

I did make a few adjustments based on previous reviews; almond extract in the batter and a little almond or vanilla in the cream cheese filling helped a great deal.  It still was too dry and heavy for my taste, and the topping  came out hard.  If you end up refrigerating this cake, I suggest microwaving it slightly before serving.  Not good cold.

I made this with an all-purpose gluten free flour and certified gf oats and it turned out great!  I was so happy to eat "pastry" with my family, and they loved it too.  I added a splash of almond extract to the cake batter and used lingonberry preserves for our Christmas breakfast.  I also used ginger instead of cinnamon in the topping, it didn't give a strong flavor, but I prefer it to cinnamon with berries.

Delicious and easy to modify. I found the crumb coating too sweet and cinnamon-y the first time, so I changed it to a half cup of non-packed dark brown sugar and only 1/4th teaspoon cinnamon, and then it was perfect. I also doubled the strawberry preserves because I felt there wasn't enough the first time around. The yogurt in the cake makes it the perfect texture, and the cream cheese is divine.

Without the modifications below to the batter to make the cake moister and fluffier, this is a 2 star cake. 1st try was very dense and dry. Start out by getting everything else ready, crumble, cream cheese mix (I add a little almond extract, if I am making blueberry then I also add blueberry extract) 1st, I used cake flour, adding about 3 tbsp per the conversion formulas I find online (1 1/2 c Plus 3 tbsp) also used 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, not 1 1/4. Let the butter come up to room temp before creaming thoroughly. I use about 7 tbsp, not 5.  Use 2 eggs instead of 1 and separate white and yolks, put yolks into butter mixture and cream thoroughly, add the sour cream (didn't use yogurt). Add half the flour mixture (SIFTED), mix gently, then whip the egg whites till they peak. Gently fold in to batter with all remaining flour. Just mix/fold until all ingredients incorporated. Fill pan/pyrex, add cream cheese, then fruit, then nuts, then crumble. I don't know if our oven has drifted a bit, but I bake at 360 not 375, 55 minutes, let it cool down and get the heck out of the way. The original recipe needs AIR to make it fluff and also was very dry. After I master this to my expectations I am going to try the raspberry cream cheese recipe. (A different coffee cake recipe.) I am just about there. I've made this 4 or 5 times.

I made this with raspberry preserves, but I kind of drizzled it around because I like a little bit of fruit taste with each bite.  I took it to work because I knew I wasn't going to eat the whole thing in one day.  It was a hit.  I am glad one reviewer mentioned the directions being wrong (thanks).  I also have to agree that for my personal taste the cake batter was missing something.  I used foil like the recipe said to, and I had no issues with getting it off of the foil.  Thanks for the recipe.

Not horrible, but very bland. I made it with the cream cheese filling, the cake and the top- nothing extra. It really needs something, the cream cheese filling was really the only thing that gave it any flavor and the topping became tastless and a bit to hard.

After reading reviews about the cake layer being dry, I switched the yogurt with sour cream. Thought the higher fat content would make it moist. It didn't work...it was stil very dry. My plan is to find a different batter recipe and keep the cream cheese, fruit and crumb topping as is.

I was looking for a way to use up some left-over pineapple preserves and found this recipe. I won't make it again. I thought it was dense and dry, and not very tasty. The cream cheese filling was good, but everything else kind of killed it for me.

At first I didn't think this was going to work as the cake batter was quite dry and the cream cheese mixture very runny. Once cooked, the cream cheese, preserve, crumble topping was very nice (I used strawberry jam). However the actual cake batter was rather bland & tasteless. Probably wouldn't bother making again.
