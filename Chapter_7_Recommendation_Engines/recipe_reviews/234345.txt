These were just ok for us.   I was surprised by how runny the batter was and added a bit more flour, per the cook's notes, but it didn't seem to help.  The pancakes were really really thin (almost crepe-ish).  The nutmeg overpowered everything else (and I used a super scant pinch).  While I appreciate the change of pace, these just weren't out favorite (but they may be yours, so give them a try!). THANKS for the recipe!

April 11, 2017: I am reading reviews here. My thought regarding the thin batter is the difference in flour based on relative humidity. The buttermilk in this recipe was regular low-fat, all mixed Minnesota buttermilk. I recall in some areas of the U.S. there is thin buttermilk with butter chunks in it, and it never worked right for me when I cooked with it (and I could never drink it). And, all vanilla is not the same. The types of products used when trying a recipe make a difference.

I am the author of this recipe. This is a reprint of my recipe. The original recipe page had my photograph. This page did not have my photograph, and it was so long ago I had to download from my old recipe page.
I now eat gluten free and dairy free. I have done many versions of pancakes with my diet restrictions. All are based on my original recipe here.

Really nice, fluffy pancakes.  The vanilla flavor was almost too strong for us, even after cutting back by about 1/2t.  We also added about 1T of honey and 2T of pureed apple, and a little extra flour to thicken the batter (we like thick pancakes).

I just made these. Omg they are sooo delicious.  Finally a recipe that's has a unique taste from original pancakes. The nutmeg is a slight hint and the buttermilk makes it moist.  Very simple recipe. This ones a keeper

Big problem with the volume of milk in the ingredient list. I thought there was something wrong, but I'm not much of a cook, so I thought I just didn't remember what it was supposed to be. It was so runny that the first couple turned out more like crepes than pancakes. Being that I'm not very experienced, I tried to thicken it up by adding some more flour to it. That was not the solution. they looked like pretty pancakes after that, but the texture was like rubber.

They were really gummy inside, not sure if that was a user error. :-) But I agree with the other posts, not fluffy very thin crÃªpe like batter.

There was way too much milk. Thus, making a batter as thin as water.

I added a little bit of sugar and a touch of cinnamon, they were yummy and didn't need syrup.
