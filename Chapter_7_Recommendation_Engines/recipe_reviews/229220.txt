Great recipe - perfect for a quick lunch or snack! I swear you could put just about anything in a Grands! Biscuit and it'll turn out delicious. I sometimes use Swiss cheese or Cheddar instead of American, but just about any variety of cheese you have on hand will do in a pinch. My niece just loves these! She likes hers served with a side of ketchup and mustard for dipping....

I made this as a quick breakfast "sandwich" for my husband and two boys. I used sliced sharp cheddar instead of American cheese. They seemed to like them, enough to where there were no leftovers. I'd like to figure out how to get scrambled egg inside of the sandwiches without them being too full.

The family was not all that impressed by these.  One said they were too salty - one said they needed mustard and one had no comment.

Let me start by saying I don't eat meat but the sandwiches looked delicious so I used cheddar and pepper jack cheese in my sandwich. Although I didn't use meat, I felt like the sandwich still needed something else. I think it would be great with tomatoes and onions. It's a good base.

Hubby gave this a 5, and I gave it a 4 on taste alone--for concept a 5.  I will make these again for lunch, but next time it will include some mustard and some pepperoncinis.  I used some leftover Honeybaked ham for these.  Thank you for this!  I think my granddaughters will love these, and like I've said in reviews before, what else matters than that?!

I added spinach leaves inside these for an extra boost, and everyone loved them.  Even my toddler ate them, spinach and all!

These were good but you can only eat one. If you could cut one biscuits worth of dough in half it would be a lot better, not so bready.

These were fine for quick and easy.  We thought they were a little heavy on the cheese and they looked done on the outside but were a little doughy on the inside.  I might make these again with less cheese.  The kids didn't love them.

I made these for a quick and easy brunch for myself, my boyfriend, his brother and a friend. We all enjoyed them, and everyone gobbled up their sandwich. Nothing fancy, but not bad when you want a hot breakfast without slaving over the stove or when you're looking for a snack that's a little bit different from your average ham and cheese sandwich.

Great quick and easy recipe for lunch or dinner. The kids loved them. I would definitely play with the cheese next time I made this. Cheddar would be lovely. When making these I put the biscuit into a ziploc bag and flattened them out, it's easier and quicker then doing it with your hands.

While these took me a little to prepare then I thought they would, everybody loved them. I really liked the fact that they seemed light compared to a heavy sandwich.

The trick is to get the biscuits flat enough, and to get the right ratio of biscuit to filling.  In my case, I didn't do either very well.  This is OK if you want to fuss with a sandwich, but usually my sammies are grab and go.  I used the reduced fat whole wheat Grands, and subbed provolone, because that is what I had on hand.

These need some tweaks. I made the recipe as written and the american cheese (kraft singles) oozed out when cut in half and the ham when left sliced whole came out with the first bite.  If I made these again I would try a different cheese like cheddar, swiss or maybe munster. I also served these with dijon mustard because they were pretty blah and plain as is.

I kept the grandgirls last night for a sleepover. They came up with the idea of having a breakfast party. So I decided to have Grands Ham and Cheese Melts, Grandwich Breakfast Sandwiches, and Grands Mini Pizzas. Grands for the Grands breakfast party was a hit! The ham and cheese melt was my husband's favorite of all the recipes I made.

Too much biscuit for these. The Ham & Cheese Melts definitely needed something else to add to them - maybe mustard.

Made these for lunch and got 4 out of 4 thumbs up. I'm going to try different meats and cheeses next time. Fun way of having an ordinary sandwich.

Very good.  The ham made it a little watery, but I think if I had let it sit for a couple minutes it would have come back together.  Next time I might try cheddar or swiss cheese.

I made these for breakfast and they turned out great. Since we don't care for the taste of American cheese slices, I used co-jack.

Only thing that I could think of adding is marinara or pizza sauce with them, it is to die for together.

My family love these. But I change it a little bit. I used leftover Christmas ham, not deli ham. Also I used shredded cheddar instead of sliced cheese. Came out great. A new recipe I will use again

My husband, best friend and boys really enjoyed this. I liked it OK. I would definitely fix it again for them, though :) Quick and easy (maybe next time I will try another cheese, I think that was my one hangup.)

Good in a pinch - I think different fillings would make me like it more.  The processed cheese was just too much for me.  I used leftover ham that I had baked the prior day.  I won't give up on the idea, I'll just use different fillings and forgo the american cheese slices.

We thought these were great! It's nice to know that with a few simple ingeredients (that I always have on hand), a warm, satisfying lunch is only a few minutes away. Made as written, and they came out perfectly~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I tried Pillsbury Croissants instead and rolled hem around the meat and cheese.  Because of that some of the dough was undercooked.   I used cheddar instead of American Cheese.   I also added sesame seeds to the top of the egg glaze. They did look pretty.  My husband and I liked them, our two young kids did not.  They were having a picky moment, not the fault of the recipe.  Will probably try again.
