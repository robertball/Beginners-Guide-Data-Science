nacho cheese works much better... i also prefer ground beef or refried beans to the chicken but thats just personal opinion.

I was happy to find this recipe again, as I used to make it all the time and then lost track of the recipe.  I was surprised to see the low reviews.  Every time I make this, I get rave reviews!  It's a nice, easy recipe and a little different from the traditional beef nachos.

Unlike a lot of the other reviews, I really liked the cheddar cheese soup. I thought it was similar to queso. Which is a very authentic mexi flavor cheese. My entire family really liked these. I will however, add a can or two extra chicken.

This was not my liking. I would suggest using velveeta or shredded cheese & cut up a rottiserie chicken from your local deli.

This tasted fairly fake because of the type of cheese used.  I might try this again using fresh cheese in a short of fondue type form.

I used fresh chicken, not canned, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was ok. Not a fan of the cheddar soup, like other reviewers stated I'd prefer Velveeta.

Easy recipe but would not use cheddar soup.
