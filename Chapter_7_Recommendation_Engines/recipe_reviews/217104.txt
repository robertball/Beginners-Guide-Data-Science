We had this drink in a bar in Knoxville, and I was so excited to see the recipe.  My husband LOVES Mezcal, and this drink is the whole reason he bought me Aperol.  I would recommend good vermouth, which I currently donâ€™t have.  I used Hornitos Reposado tequila, but will try with a Plata, I think that might taste even better.
