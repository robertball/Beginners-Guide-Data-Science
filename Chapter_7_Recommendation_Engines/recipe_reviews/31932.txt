I was a little skeptical when I saw that ketchup was one of the ingredients, but I wanted to try something new & I had a pound of ground beef to cook.  I was pleasantly surprised by the way this turned out!  I didn't think it was too sweet, probably I used a bit less ketchup than what the recipe called for.  I also used fresh red onions & Parmesan cheese, since that's what I had on hand.  I didn't have bell peppers but next time I think peas would be a good addition.I know I used more than 1 cup of macaroni, but I just eyeballed it so I don't have the exact measurement.  I will definitely make this again!

A little sweet but great!! I used more noodles, increased the bell pepper, reduced the ketchup to 1/2c and a little more cheese. Also, instead of dry minced onion (1 cup? WOW! but a little too much for me!) I diced some onion and sauted it with the beef. I'll make this again for busy evenings on the go, and perhaps I'll take the tomato soup suggestion, just to see if it improves even more! Thanks Eileen!

This was okay but I added jalapeno, onion, garlic, 1Tb. Chili powder, Cummin, to the meat while browning.  No bell pepper and my family loved it.  It is zippy now.  Ace

Yummy!  My mom used to make this for me all the time when I was a kid.  She didnt put the potato chips on top but they added just the perfect touch.

I made this today for dinner and we loved it!  The only thing I will do different next time is leave off the potato chips.  We didn't like the texture it gave.  Otherwise, excellent!

I made this for dinner last night and it was very good.  My husband really liked it.  I did as the other reviewer suggest and used tomato soup instead of catsup.  I go to a lot of potlucks amd this is a dish I will diffently make to take to them.  It was very easy to make.  The potatoe chips really add to the dish.

I grew up with this casserole as the staple my family too to reunions! I love it. What I do differently though is use some American Cheese in addition to the cheddar. It adds a creamier texture. Also I add a bit more ketchup. It adds a little salt.

Happened to have all the ingredients on hand so I tried this. What a nice surprise.  I think the ketchup gave it a good flavor.  Also the chips worked, my 11 year old thought it was cool.

I used to make this for my kids when they were little (it was out annual trick or treat night dinner) and they loved it.  Back then i used ketchup and thought it was good but the taste of the ketchup was overpowering.  As someone suggested, I tried tomato soup and it was much better.  Also, I doubled the cheese and used a mexican cheese blend, used red peppers instead of green and sprinkled some fresh parmesan cheese on top

Good.  Next time will follow previous reviewer and use tomato soup instead of ketchup.  (Ketchup was a little too sweet.)  Used whole wheat elbows.

This has a new name in our house.  MIRACLE Mac!  We have 3 picky kids and they all asked for seconds of this.  It was the first night in I can't remember how long that I was able to put food on the table and NO ONE asked to be excused right away!  Thank you atriumlady!

I altered the recipe a bit. After adding 1/2 c. of ketchup, it was too sweet for me so I added 2 tbsp of chili powder, a dash of paprika,pepper and two shakes of hot sauce. To add color I added mixed veggies.  The family loved it! It was like mac and cheese meets hamburger helper. I will make again.

I was flustered with a whole house of weekend guests and this was so easy and fun to make I was amazed! I did use tomato soup and I put some cajun seasoning in this. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 13 x 9 inch pan. Everyone LOVED it and they're picky eaters. I think that with this recipe the more chips you have on top, the better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My husband went back two more times to load up his plate! I did add twice the noodles since I just had spiral ones in the house and not elbow mac. I also only had shredded parmesan and used that instead of the cheddar. It looks like in the photo that they used regular chips and I used the rippled kind. I like them better for breading since there is more to them. 5 stars! Great meal!

This was a very good recipe but I did make some changes. I used fresh onions and garlic that I sauteed before adding them. I also used tomato soup to cut down on the sweetness and added more cheese.

I added some minced garlic to this recipe, a little pepper, and added some freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the potato chips before popping it back into the oven.  After all the additions I still felt that this recipe was quite bland and very Hamburger Helperish.  My husband, being a big fan of Hamburger Helper loved it and had seconds.  I did not care for it and will not make it again unless my husband requests it.

This is a pretty good recipes!!  I cut down on the ketchup just a little and I really enjoyed it.  My husband wasnt crazy about, yet he ate 3 helpings!!  He said it was growing on him.  The chips on top make it delisoully different.

My husband and I thought this was a pretty darn good comfort food.  Yes, a little hamburger helper-ish but at least the ingredients don't come in a box and powder packets.  Due to others recommendations I used about a 1/4th of a cup of ketchup and this was a good amount for our taste.

This was a really easy, cheap meal, and the ketchup gave it a really good flavor. My kids liked it, and I can see making this a lot when I'm pressed for time and unable to find stuff to cook, as I always have these types of ingredients on hand.

My husband did eat it but I thought the ketchup made it way too sweet.  Maybe it would taste better with tomato soup instead of the ketchup.  I put crushed Ritz crackers on top instead of potato chips.

This a great casserole, easy to make.  I used tomato soup and a touch of ketchup.  Next time I'll play around with more seasonings-maybe chili powder, paprika or taco seasoning.

Seems like it could use a bit of seasoning of some kind... I used egg noodles, no green pepper (didn't have any), and instead of chips, I put French's Onions on top. Would like to try using tomato soup instead of ketchup next time too.

I think that this recipe would have tasted better without the ketchup. Also decrease the baking time to 30 min.

I have been making this for years.  My recipe calls for 2 T minced onion and that's plenty.  I also omit green pepper as my kids don't like it.  Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly and we love it.

I quite liked this and so did the rest of the family. Next time I would leave out the potato chips though - I thought they tasted odd.

This was far too sweet and had too many onions.  I don't think we will be finishing this because it was awful.  Using tomato soup and reducing the onions to 1/4 c. or less would be a big improvement.

This recipe is good comfort food. Simple to put together. I added some chopped celery and skipped the peppers as i added a can of mexicorn for a veg. I also took input from others and used tomato soup instead of the ketchup. Served with corn muffins and green salad. This made alot for 4 people! Will take leftovers to work and share tomorrow.

Thank you!  Husband and picky eater son liked it.  I changed the recipe a little.  I used basic cream sauce instead of Cream of Mushroom soup and based on previous reviews, used less ketchup - husband said it needed more ketchup so I will try it again.

Very good and simple recipe. The only thing I would change is to put a bit more milk in it. Otherwise this is a keeper.

I have been making this recipe for many years; I have the very old Betty Crocker recipe box from about 25 years ago, and this recipe is one of them.  My 4 kids have always loved this dish, as do my hubby and I.  Fairly quick, no unusual ingredients, and tastes yummy!

Thought this was pretty good, I used velveeta cheese instead of the cheddar (had to use it).  Added some mixed veggies.  Some more seasonings, garlic powder, paprika and some others.

I have always loved this recipe!  We went vegetarian a couple years back and have not used this recipe since....until tonight!  I substituted the beef with brown lentils.  IT WAS PERFECT!!!  We don't, however, use it with chips.  Tried it a few times but it tasted much better without!

When making this today, I noticed that I had 3 opened jars of homemade salsa in the fridge that were all almost empty. I substituted the salsa for the ketchup...Really kicked it up a notch...Awesome

Hubby loved it, although he thought it was a little too sweet with the ketchup. We're going to reduce the amount of ketchup we put in it the next time we cook it. We also added onion and garlic, and we substituted the cheddar cheese for velveeta.

This turned out pretty good since I was in a pinch.  I really have tried to stay away from soup recipes, but do keep some on hand when in a pinch.  This turned out pretty good.  I did add some garlic and extra cheese.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe was great! My fussy 3 year old ate a whole plate. I usually don't like to alter recipes until I have tried the original - but I had to make a few changes due to available ingredients. I used penne noddles (1-1/2 cups)I didn't have minced onions so I added French's french fried onions, and lastly instead of plain chips I used archer farms maple bar-b-que. I think the flavored chips added alot. It was very delicious and simple to make.

My husband and I thought this was pretty good, but I did change it up a bit.  I used about 1/2 of a large sweet onion, chopped, I also added 1 tsp minced garlic from the jar, and I used roasted red bell pepper instead of the green bell pepper.  I cooked all of this with the meat.  I decreased the amount of ketchup to 1/3 cup, and used 1/2 the amount of topping, which I made from ritz crackers and cheese pringles.  My husband said it kind of tasted like lasagna.
