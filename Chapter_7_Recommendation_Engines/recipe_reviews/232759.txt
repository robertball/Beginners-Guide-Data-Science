I used Truvia instead of sugar to reduce calories, and I put the garlic in the blender along with all of the other ingredients (I like garlic!).  Nice recipe, good consistency, with just the right amount of tang.

I switched out the white sugar for honey and used 3/4 of a cup, it was way too sweet so added in about 1/4 cup more vinegar. It was really good. Next time I will cut the honey to 1/4 cup and see what we think. It is a keeper for sure!

I loved this recipe.  I added a little horseradish to it, which balanced the sweetness perfectly.
