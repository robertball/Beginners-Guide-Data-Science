I've made hot artichoke dip so many times but I'm surprised to see no garlic. I also add minced onion and I love how the mayo gives it a nice tangy taste. Tip: I use my Crock Pot Dip Master at parties to keep this warm the entire time. I just plug it in and leave it. I usually have to make an extra batch to keep on reserve because it goes so fast! I just made some Pita Crisps to go with this dip for tonight's party. I'll post the recipe. They are really easy to make and really good!

This is delicious.  My husband can't eat that much spinach, so I was trying to find another artichoke dip that didn't have that as an ingredient.  I was glad that I found this one.  I only made a few changes to the recipe.  I used fresh mozzarella and some cream cheese. I also added a little garlic (rarely make anything without that). It turned out great.  Thanks for the post.

This is the best artichoke dip I have ever had.  I used frozen artichokes because I don't think they taste so vinegary.

This is fantastic!  The only changes I made to it (after reading reviews) were to add 2 cloves crushed garlic, a generous pinch of kosher salt, and instead of using plain mozzarella, I substituted Kraft Italian Blend Cheese.  That made all the difference.  Also, use fresh grated parmesan, not the kind in a jar.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

This dip was gobbled up quick at our New Year's Eve party!  Be sure to serve this dip hot.  I didn't care for it as much when it started to cool down.

I found a recipe just like this on this site a couple years ago and recently lost the recipe card it was on. I was happy to see this one cause it's almost the same as the one I lost. I omit the parsley add two cloves of pressed garlic to the recipe. All my friends and family love this!! Even people who say they don't like artichokes can't stay away from this dish!!

Incredible!!!  I made this for a Baby Shower and even people who turned their noses up at Artichokes LOVED this dip!  I did add a little garlic and onion powder, but other then that followed the recipe to a T!

I wasn't a fan, but hubby liked it. I made it in the crockput so it would stay warm, but the texture still wasn't right. As for the taste, it's possible that I'm just not a fan of the canned artichoke hearts. It was my first time trying them.

I love this recipe. It won over fellow artichoke dip lovers. However, I have added tomatoes on top right before serving.

My Go-To for holiday horsd'oeuvres. This is a real crowd pleaser. I learned this recipe nearly 10 years ago from my grandma and I have been making it ever since. To make it look extra festive add a sprinkle of paprika to the top for a red green affect. I like to serve this with freshly baked warm French bread! The real great thing about this recipe is the portions are so easy  to remember that you don't even need to write anything down! It doesnt get any better!

Since I forgot to buy mozzarella cheese at the store, I had to substitute cheddar since it's all I had on hand.  It was still a huge hit on Christmas Eve and very delicious.  This will definitely be my artichoke dip recipe from now on...but, I will use the mozzarella next time.

Had this as an appetizer for a dinner party! Awesome! Served it in a small crock pot to keep warm(that is key) and served with mini bagel chips. Those were the best. Would def. make again. I did add a little garlic powder to the recipe and next time I think I would cut the recipe in half because it was a lot of dip. Especially if you are serving as an appetizer for only a few people. But if its a large party go ahead and make the full recipe. Everyone will love it. So cheesy!

Because i read other reviews that it wasn't flavorful enough, i added 2 minced garlic cloves and did half mayo/half ranch dressing. I also threw in my favorite pepper jack cheese for a kick... The result? SOOOO good! :) my family gobbled it up in about 10 minutes, so i'm thinking this is what i'm bringing to the party this weekend! :) i'm only giving it 4 stars because i had to modify it

This recipe is really forgiving - I ran out of mayo, but it turned out fine. I added garlic powder, but I think that I will add fresh garlic next time, as suggested in a previous post.

This is the best of all the artichoke dips recipes I tried (at least for my taste). Just made for a trial run (will be taking to Christmas potluck).  My family is gobbling it down now.  Added the garlic as someone suggested and also put under broiler for a few minutes to toast the top.

Excellent. I cut all the ingredients in half since I didn't need but enough for two. Turned out great. As another reviewer noted, it's better hot so keep that in mind when serving.

This is a great appetizer that is super easy and a real crowd pleaser.  I did add a few cloves of minced garlic as well as some garlic powder, and I also added a few squirts of sriracha for a little zip.  Served with tortilla chips.  You can't go wrong with this one!

This was great! i added 2 cloves garlic and a little onion, but it probably would have been just as good without it! So cheesy and tasty!

I made this for a neighborhood Bunco night. It was good fresh from the oven, but as it sat, it got hard and not very pleasing to the eye. It still tasted good, but not really easy to snack on politely.

I saved this recipe to my recipe box 3 years ago.  I have made this at least a dozen times since then.  Follow the recipe exactly.  This dip is fantastic.  My wife was a diehard spinach dip person until I made her this.

This is the same recipe that my family ALWAYS uses to make to dip and it is by far the best! Sometimes a little garlic gives an extra kick, but it isn't even needed.

Really yummy, but missing the "extra something."  Next time I'll try adding garlic.

I love that this dish doesn't include spinach. It is cheesy and rich but irresistible. A big hit with guests.

Mine came out very salty. I added chopped tomatoes and it balanced it out perfectly.

I just made for a football party and everyone loved it. I baked it in a pie dish and that worked out great. I did add garlic powder and a can of sliced water chestnuts. Everyone said I must make it again and again.  Paprika on top and it was beautiful!!! Love it-Make it!!!

Here's a new twist to this favorite app. Par bake it in the dish then spread about 2/3 of the dip on a Boboli pizza crust and bake for 12-15 minutes. Cut it in pizza slices and serve with the remaining dip on the side.

This is a good dip but it needs garlic and if you want to add a little kick - put some green chilis or jalepenos in there.

I have made this recipe for family, parties, and baby showers and everybody loves it! I have never made it with the parsley though, I have always used garlic salt when combinig all the ingredients and sprinkle it on top with left over mozzarella for more flavor. It always is a hit!
