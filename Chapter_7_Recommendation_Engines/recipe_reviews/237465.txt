Tasty! Hubby thought it was a little dry, but I thought it was fine. I had some leftover ditalini in the fridge, so I just used that, which made this so quick to put together. I did use shredded light velveeta, b/c I have no luck w/ cheddar melting good for me. I topped it w/ some shredded cheddar and panko. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this last night and WOW is it good!!  Never would have thought that mustard and hot pepper sauce would add such punch!

The only change I made was to toss the pasta in fried butter with garlic (to add a bit more flavour to the noodles) and I topped with bread crumbs / sliced tomatoes / parm. cheese / salt & pepper.

One thing I have a problem with is with the cheese and how it stays in shredded "strips" in the casserole... next time I will pre melt the cheese so it is smooth and creamy before adding to the noodles.

My family thought this mac n cheese recipe was awesome!  I haven't found one they like, so this is amazing.  I did add a little more milk and low fat cheese to make it a little creamier, but other than that, it was perfect!  Thank you for submitting it!

This is a great basic mac & cheese recipe.  The only suggestion for a change would be to sprinkle a layer of grated parmesan cheese over the top.  This recipe also doubles very easily so I usually make a double batch.  It's an often requested item when we have neighborhood gatherings.

This is an excellent style of Mac & Cheese. I made some adjustments.  I reduced the milk and added 12 oz  of evaporated milk and added 6 oz of sour cream.  I then took it to our bowling Christmas party and got many requests to make some more.

This was very yummy!  However, I did make some modifications.  I added about a third more cheese and 2-3 tablespoons of butter--it was not dry at all!  I also used Dijon mustard and cumin powder instead of hot sauce. Finally, I put a layer of Parmesan on top to give it a nice crusty brown top. Delicious and easy!!

I added diced honey baked turkey ham and added a little garlic salt to taste.  I used shells instead of elbows and it works just fine.  My family loved it and the smell is really great

Turned out good but you definitely need to add extra cheese and milk. I also sprinkled some cheese on top. I would recommend if you do add mustard to go very light on it. Overall it was very easy to make and very yummy.

I found the recipe subpar.  I was looking forward to splurging, calorie wise, by having a creamy, cheesy, and overall delicious macaroni and cheese.  However, sadly that is not what this recipe proffered.  The macaroni and cheese was dry and not creamy by any means.  My significant other liked the flavor, but agreed it was not what he had in mind.  If I make it again, which is highly unlikely, I may not include the eggs.   **Please note I did increase the serving size (increased it to 12) and that may have contributed to the lacking outcome.

So easy and delicious! Doubled the recipe and added a 1/4 cup of bread crumbs to the top. Also cooked covered for 30 minutes and only uncovered for the last 15 minutes.

This was devoured by my husband; full of flavor and foolproof. We did add 4 slices of bacon chopped up before baking, and it made it extra tasty. I also baked it in a 9 inch glass Pyrex dish and it made the sides and bottom slightly crispy; just the way I like it.

It was very good. I did change it up a little. I used a 2 cup measuring cup & filled it with sea shell macaroni. I used 2 cups of cheddar cheese & maybe a fourth of a block of Velveeta cheese shredded. I used 2/3 cup of milk & 1/4 cup of milk & an x-large egg. I like Ritz crackers on top of mine so at 40 minutes I took the dish out & stirred my Mac-n-cheese & added my crushed Ritz crackers. After I had put mine in a regular baking dish, I saw written in small, pale print that it’s best cooked in a clay baking dish on 425 for 1 hour.

Love the creaminess of this recipe. I added a big dollup of sour cream. Next time I’ll use a little less mustard. Overall tasted great and you could probably use pretty much any cheese.

Made this last night! It was tasty, but a little dry. I doubled the recipe and in the future, I would not double the mustard as I found the flavor a bit overbearing. Also, I passed on the hot peppers since my 6 year old doesn't do spicy

I was disappointed in this recipe and won't be making it again. It did not have the creaminess I like in mac and cheese. The flavors were just so-so and didn't make you want to take another bite.

The cheddar cheese just does not work for me. I did reduce the amount of cheddar, and added mozzarella.  I used 1c whole milk, added diced plum tomatoes then baked for 45 min.  Hot and bubbly, though a bit bland and on the dry side.

I doubled the recipe and used more milk for a creamier taste and substituted in honey mustard instead and also used slightly more cheese and baked for thirty min. Hands down best Mac and cheese!

This was a great recipe! Everyone at the table loved this homemade version of mac and cheese! I had thought I had mustard in the refrigerator but I didn't, so I compromised and use some honey mustard (haha) and everyone said it gave the dish just a slight sweet taste.

I loved this recipe.  I added the tablespoon of mustard.  It was great and I don't even like mustard.
