I have faithfully made this pie for Thanksgiving every year for the last 40 years...except this year. I guess I was in a creative, experimental mood and so I tried a different recipe. I thought it was quite good, as did the others at the Thanskgiving table, but we all agreed I should stick with the good ol' Libby's pie. As they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Everything you'd want in a pumpkin pie is right here in this classic and traditional recipe--smooth and velvety  texture, the perfect blend of spices, and it always turns out great. There was really no reason to  try a different pumpkin pie recipe in the first place, and there's still no reason to try another pumpkin pie recipe. This will resume its place on the Thanksgiving table next year! (Many years ago my mom told me to add a couple tablespoons of rum, and I've always thought it made this pie just a little bit better :)

I've used this recipe for almost 30 years but I use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar in place of 3/4 cup white sugar called for, and serve with a dollop of ginger or cinnamon flavored whipped cream. Yummy!

I have used this recipe for almost 50 years.  You simply cannot improve on this filling!  However, I do not like soggy pie crusts so I solved this problem years ago by adding 1 Tab. instant flour to this filling and making it "crustless."  The consistency is still just as creamy, and it slices beautifully.  Just be sure and butter your pie plate.  I bake it at 350 for 55 mins.(center should be set and when pie is shaken gently, should not jiggle.)   Saves a LOT of calories and fat grams!  I make this pie all year round - not just during the holidays.  Try this method; it will work for you!

This is the BEST pumpkin pie! I use this recipe year after year. BTW (by the way), don't substitute pumpkin pie spice for the individual spices, they are part of what makes this pie a winner every year!

I've used this recipe for pumpkin pie since I made my first pie at 13. I've always loved it, but this year I wanted to try something a little different. I was browsing the recipes and after reading the reviews for this one, I realized I don't need another recipe, this one is great. I do add a little nutmeg and I go kinda heavy on the cinnamon because I like my pies spicy. I also cover the edges with foil for the first 25 minutes to prevent the crust from burning. This year might try adding a little vanilla too.

it tasted perfect, but I think maybe i will reduce the amount of evaporated milk it calls for because the mixture seemed watery.  on the other hand, was it suppose to be that watery?

This was my grandmother's "secret" recipe, and she was by far the best pie-maker I ever met. I went and asked my mom for my grandmother's pumpkin pie recipe, and she said, "Just look on the side of the Libby's Pumpkin can!" I was shocked, but have never found a pie that was spiced just right like Libby's. Not too much of one spice...perfect. And it even tastes great with a premade crust (which my grandmother NEVER did!).

Libby's is a staple in our house for the holidays!

This is the only recipe I've used for several years. I've recently started using only 8oz of evaporated milk and it is perfect. The 12oz. it recommends in the recipe is just too much. You get too much extra filling for a deep dish and it comes out very soft. So if you want a pie that is a bit firmer but still soft try 8oz.

This is a staple at my house for the holidays. My mom has always used this recipe, and now I do, too. This is also really good using sweetened condenced milk (not the entire can)in place of the evaporated milk. I found that out by accidentally grabbing the wrong can out of the cupboard!

Great basic recipe for pumpkin pie! I slightly tweaked the seasoning as I like my pie "spicier", but this recipe will still delight as is.

For those of you who have never made pumpkin pie before (as I had not when I discovered this recipe), be sure to cover your crust edges with foil when baking or they will burn.  

Also, I was not prepared for how watery the mix is before you bake it!  I panicked and re-read the instructions about 3 times because it was so liquid when I poured the mix in the pie shells.  Not to worry though, I got perfect pies! :)  Just a tip from one pie novice to another.  ENJOY!

My father made the world's best pumpkin pie!  Our family would salivate at the thought of a big piece at the end of our holiday meal.  We all came to find out after he died that all he did was used the Libby "Famous Pumpkin Pie" recipe - with his special touch....... a dash of vanilla.  He told people it was an old family recipe he could never divulge.  Dad was quite the character, and dearly missed.  But somehow when I now make this recipe I feel him standing there with me.  Thank you Libby for that oh-so-special memory!

I noticed that a few reviews suggested adding a bit of flour to thicken the filling, but my mom and I have always made the filling thicker by using half as much evaporated milk as the recipe calls for. It has a richer, more "pumpkin-y" taste. It will also be spicier because there is less milk.

I live at 5,200 ft. alt.  I've used this recipe for 40 years (my mom before me), always making two pies at a time.  I don't put spices, etc. in separate bowls; I just put the pumpkin in my bowl & add everything else to it (I don't beat the eggs before adding them either).  I then mix it all thoroughly & pour into my homemade unbaked pie crusts & have always been praised on the taste of the pies & crusts.  The one problem I always had was that the pies would not set in the time listed on the recipe.  I would bake as instructed, checking them when the recipe said; but they would always be soupy & would take at least another hour of baking time beyond what the recipe said before they would set, to the point that I would have burned blotches on top of the pies (my mom had the same problem).  It made no difference what stove I used (gas, electric, propane, various houses, apartments, & mobile homes).  Then quite by accident 11 years ago (while living in a camping trailer, cooking on propane), I got distracted & the pies cooked at 425 for an extra 5 minutes.  I freaked out, thinking that I had burned my crusts, but I went ahead & turned the temp down to 350 & checked them after they had baked 45-50 minutes, expecting them to be a soupy mess as usual.  To my surprise, they were almost set & only needed about 10 more minutes.  Since then, I have baked my pies at 425 for 20 minutes, then lowered the temp to 350, & my pies have been perfect in approx. the time listed in the recipe.

I use this every thanksgiving, and it's always a hit. The only thing that I add is a thin layer of ground up pecans, brown sugar and butter on the bottom. Pre bake the crust with the pecans for 5 minutes, then take it out and add the filling. When you cut it open, there's a wonderful crunch at the bottom!

Ah, the Libby's pumpkin pie recipe. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water, and I get all sentimental, remembering past Thanksgivings with family and friends, making these wonderful pies.   The only tweak I would make to this recipe to step it up from good to amazing and life changing ((not really, but it makes for a darned good pie)), is to double all the spices and add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of allspice. You get a fantastically spiced pie, and suddenly people will be requesting your pie over anyone elses!

I've always used this recipe, with one VERY off-the-wall change. Look - the Libby's pumpkin in the can is great, because it's 100% pumpkin with nothing else added. And guess what, pumpkin is not only good for you, but it tastes GREAT! That's right, pumpkin tastes GREAT as a vegetable or in pies. So here's my one change: CUT each of the spices in half (1/2 tsp. cin., 1/4 tsp. ginger, 1/8 tsp. cloves). GUESS WHAT - you'll get a pie where you can actually SAVOR the pumpkin flavor. I've done this for years, serve with whip cream, and my guests always rave about it - WOW, it tastes like a PUMPKIN pie, not a SPICE pie with some soft orange filling. I'll stop my rant now, and happy Thanksgiving everyone. ***EDIT*** A few more tips based on other reviews: for frozen crust, use deep dish and take it out of the freezer when you start making the filling. It will thaw so you can bend up the edge to add more capacity. If your hand isn't steady, fill the pie as much as possible, put in the oven and use a turkey baster to top off the pie will filling. (Squeeze GENTLY so you don't spray your oven with filling!!) For baking time, after turning down to 350, I let it go for 60 minutes. The pie should have an even, puffed-up dome over the entire surface (including the center). A knife stuck in the center should come out clean. If not, let it go an extra 5 minutes and test again. When done, the surface and crust will NOT be burned.

I have to say that I do not understand the ratings on this one at all. Sorry. Sure, there are worse recipes out there, but there are others that are so smooth and meltingly creamy that blow this recipe out of the water. This pie is dense and heavy compared to many others. I also find that adding just a few small candied yams to a pumpkin pie deepens the flavor without anyone knowing that there is anything in there but pumpkin. Using freshly minced ginger is far better than the dry spice as well, IMO:)

Best Pumpkin Pie ever. Grew up on this stuff for over 44 years. My mother has changed things up a bit that makes this the best.  She uses 2 tsp of cinnamon added to 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, Add 2 tsp of real vanilla to the wet mix. Sprinkle cinnamon on top of the pie before cooking. Makes all the difference in this pie.  I, being a diabetic, replace the sugar with Splenda and it tastes great! No difference and it's sugar free. Always use home-made crust and Extra Creamy Cool-Whip to top.   I can eat a whole pumpkin pie by myself. Love it!

This is awesome! I used a premade crust (not a deep dish one) and there definitely was too much filling for the crust. But I just poured the rest into a ramekin and baked it alongside the pie... ended up with an amazing pumpkin pudding. Baked it for 50 minutes. Didn't change a thing and will definitely make this again and again!

very good and somewhat easy. I lightly cook the pie shell before filling and then keep it covered the whole time to keep from burning the crust. It comes out fine. I also use Splenda in this recipe and it works great.

I grew up with this recipe and was so upset to discover that in Scotland they don't sell tinned pumpkin!! It was too late for me to beg family to send some over, so decided to try and make it with fresh pumpkin. I'm so glad I did, I love it even more with the fresh pumpkin!! So I tried it 2 different ways, the first and least successful way was to boil the flesh, this made it really watery. The other, far more successful way, was to bake the flesh with the skin still on. Bake until soft, then scrape flesh from the skin into a sieve over a bowl. Using a spoon or spatula, rub the flesh through the sieve...this is VITAL, don't be tempted to process it in a food processor or by using a hand blender, as you won't like the finished pie filling's result. Do the work, it's worth it.  By sieving it, you remove any fiberous bits and get a very silky pie filling.  I then go on to put the sieved pumpkin into a bit of cheese cloth to drain excess liquid from the pumpkin to make it thick like the tinned pumpkin is, but this step is not vital, and can be used without draining it's liquid. Then simply follow the Libby's pie recipe...but my family and I LOVED the results from using fresh pumpkin so much that we will never go back to tinned pumpkin again.  I cook extra pumpkins & freeze in measured quantities for use whenever I'm in the mood for pumpkin pie or little pumpkin tartlets.

Great pumpkin pie - just like my grandma used to make!! - I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar as someone else suggested, kept spices the same.  I used a frozen pie shell and kept it frozen just until I used it and the shell was not soggy at all.  I did have to cover the edge of the crust with tinfoil for about 1/2 of the cooking time to keep it from over browning.

I made this today and it is SO good. I did make changes based on others reviews. I know people don't like when someone changes things, but that's one reason I make sure to read the reviews! Sometimes the changes/advice make all the difference. 1) I heated up my pumpkin, and spices (I used 1 teasp of cinnamon and 1 teasp of pumpkin pie spice)and sugar on the stove (Let cool before adding eggs & milk). I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and the rest of it regular sugar, but I doubt it makes any difference. 2) I brushed egg white on the bottom of my crust to keep it from getting soggy (I used a pillsbury dough crust that you just unroll) 3) I did NOT use the whole can of evap. milk. I only used 1 cup of evap. milk and it was perfect. I also added a capful of vanilla. After I reduced the temp to 350 I only had to cook it for 50 min. I turned off the oven and left the pie in the oven.
TIP: I thought I would put my foil around crust before I put the pie in the oven, I would rather put the foil on a cool pie plate than a hot one. But this is not a good idea. My foil just pushed down the pretty crust pattern I formed. It's worth it to let the crust bake and firm up before you put on the foil. My whole house smelled so wonderful while this was baking. I topped it with cinnamon whipped cream. I don't even like pumpkin pie, but this is just so so so good. Serve warm. Enjoy! Oh, I think chopped pecans would be good in this, maybe lay them on the crust before pouring in the filling.?

This is the best pumpkin pie recipe around - as long as you do one thing: use fresh pumpkin!  I substitute 2 c fresh pureed pumpkin for the can of Libby's.  Perfection!  It is soooo much better with fresh pumpkin.  That said, use this recipe!  You will not be disappointed.

Really good flavor and set up well.  Only complaint - I bought a 9 inch deep dish crust and I still had about 1 1/2 cups of extra filling that wouldn't fit in the crust!  I baked it in a glass dish and it was still yummy.  Also - be sure to cover your pie crust with foil to keep it from getting too brown!

I made two of these pies for Thanksgiving last year and both my family and my in-laws commented on how much they liked it.  They've all made pumpkin pie before, but I think the big difference is that they use pumpkin pie spice and this recipe calls for separate spices.  The separate spices have a stronger taste, which balances out the sweet, creamy pumpkin.  I even bumped up the cinnamon and added nutmeg.  I plan to make it again this year!

A perfect recipe, foolproof. I put everything in the blender and mix it all at once. Then pour it into the prepared crust. Easy.

Don't forget about  pumpkin the rest of the year.  I don't save it just for holidays. For a quick, rich treat, follow the recipe and make whatever changes you want in spices and sugar (I've even used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 brown sugar). But forget the crust!  Much easier to put in a 2 or 2 1/2 quart casserole dish and cook as you would a pie: done when the knife comes out clean.(But it won't spill over in your oven!) Imagine the calories you save by not eating crust. Serve as you would a custard or pudding, then top it off with FF Cool Whip and a little frest grated nutmeg!  Thanksgiving any night of the year.

Even though this recipe has been reviewed to death, I must add that this is THE basic pumpkin pie recipe.  It is very simple to make & turns out great each time.  Creamy with just the right combination & amount of spices - get fresh individual spices and not the all-in-one pumpkin pie spice.  It is watery however; don't let that scare you, it firms up nicely in the end.  Also, there seems to be a little leftover filling - do not overfill your pie and make sure you get the DEEP dish pie crust.

Turned out great only made 4 changes:
*used tradional pie crust - don't like alot of filling
*used 1 small 5oz can of milk
*used half sucanat/half white sugar
*used 2 tsp of cinnamon and added 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice to ginger and cloves

This will be the only pumpkin pie recipe I ever use, although I will try with fresh pumpkin instead of can

The only thing I do differently with this recipe was taught to me by a friend who learned it from her grandmother.  You'll have to start in advance because it spreads it out over a few days, but all of the flavors blend and mix so much better!  Day 1: Mix pie filling according to directions & refrigerate overnight. Day 2: Pour pie filling into crust & refrigerate overnight. Day 3: Bake pie & serve.

Very good pie recipe, rave reviews!  On the can purchased here in the UK, it said to bake the pie crust alone for 10-15 minutes at 425 before adding the filling, then reduce the oven temp to 350 and add the filling then bake 40-50 minutes until done.  I did do this, and highly recommend.  It prevents the crust from getting soggy due to the wet filling.  Good suggestion!

I couldn't find a good sweet potato pie recipe-used this one. The only thing I changed was to use pumpkin pie spice(2 1/4 tsp) in place of spices and 1Tbsp flour(my batter was to runny) and of course sweet potatoes-This made enough for 2-9inch pies

Great!! Super Easy, the only thing I would change is making it the night before your occasion, it tasted even more heavenly the next day!! I substituted Pumpkin Pie spice instead of the individual spices. Perfect amount for a DEEP DISH Pie, as it calls for. Will be making this one again before Christmas!

This is a pretty good pumpkin pie recipe. I always add extra spices to it because I like my pie full of flavor. I find this pie kind of average. To make it extra special I suggest doing something to it to make it shine more. Like using a spiced crust or something. I would use this recipe again only because it is simple and can be modified any way.

Absolutely delish!  I used a pre-formed pie crust (I forget the brand) and it came out perfectly.  I also used the nutmeg whipped cream, which was easier to make than I thought it would be, and that made the whole dish that much better.

Excellent.  Top notch!  But we use half the evaporated milk.  We get the 30 oz two pie can and it calls for 2-12oz cans of evaporated milk but we only use one.  For one thing by the time one is mixed in it already looks soupy and secondly the filling wouldnt fit in two 9 inch deep dish pie crusts. It barely fits with the 1 can of milk.  So why does the recipe call for so much milk?   Does anyone else have this problem or reduce the milk?

I made 2 pies - but left out all spices except for the cinnamon, I made these for a PreSchool Thanksgiving Feast and didn't want it too strong or "spicy" for the little ones. They loved it! :)

This is the classic and always great pumpkin pie from our childhood.  Perfect recipe every time. Be sure to get the deep dish pie crusts as it makes a lot of filling.  If there is too much filling for the crust, put it in a small pyrex dish and bake about half as long as the pie.  It makes an excellent custard that the kids who don't like pie crust gobble up.

This recipe is perfect period. I had never made pumpkin pie before even though it is my favorite and said I would make it for a Christmas dinner. It was delicious! Everyone thought I must make it all the time because it tasted so good! Thank you so much for sharing!

I've made this pumpkin pie recipe for over 20 years and it's always perfection.  For diabetics, I have substituted the sugar with Splenda and used low fat evaportated milk, and it's still fantastic.  This year, I will try it with Stevia.  I also cover the pie crust with foil for first half of baking time to avoid burning the edges.

I think this is probably the only pumpkin pie I've ever had (though I really want to try a little something different, maybe nutmeg or more cinnamon). The only problem I had with this recipe is that I always have much more pie mix than I do pie crust...

Okay. I made this recipe and the Perfect Pumpkin Pie recipe from this site, just to compare and make sure I made the best one possible. The Libby's recipe had, by far, the best flavor and texture. Absolutely perfect!

This is the pumpkin pie recipe I grew up with. My mom's "secret" is that she halves the ginger and the cloves---but never the cinnamon. She loves the taste of pumpkin and by doing this she lets the pumpkin flavor dominate.

This recipe is the only pumpkin pie recipe I'll use. I omit the cloves and ginger. I do increase the cinnamon a bit and add about a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. If I have extra pumpkin filling left after filling my pie plate, I just pour it into a little baking dish and cook it along side the pie. But watch it closely because it will cook faster then the pie.

A very thoughtful blend of spices. So easy to make Ive memorized the recipe. When Im in the store I just ask myself if I want pumpkin pie and can then just grab the ingredients. Dont overfill the pie when pouring.

This is the BEST and EASIEST pumpkin pie EVER.  Seriously.  The spices are just perfect - not too much cinnamon or anything.  So good and takes just minutes to put together.  I will be making this every Thanksgiving and anytime I am craving some pumpkin pie!

Amazing and easy! I added nutmeg to the mix and will increase the spice measurements next time. (We love a heavily spiced pie.) I had leftover filling so will make tartlets with it. Huzzah! Incompetent-cook proof :)

There is too much evaporated milk, resulting in way too much filling for a 9-inch deep dish crust.  It also made it very watery and took much longer to cook than the recipe says.  This may have something to do with my oven too.  Next time, I would decrease the milk.  The crust burned as well due to the extra time in the oven.  Another reviewer suggests putting foil on the crust for part of the time, to prevent burning.

I made this pie as called for, with the deviation of adding the puree, spices and salt to a pot and warming them over the stove on medium heat and then cooling in the frige prior to making the pie.  It makes a world of difference!  My pumpkin pie addicted friend said that this was the best one I had ever made.  It turned out super moist and looked nice with no cracks (I let it cool in the oven for a bit before pulling it out).  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and simple. For crispy crust I took the advice of another blogger's comment and it worked on my premade refrigerator crust:  After arranging and fluting the crust in the foil disposable pie pan, I brushed the bottom and sides with 1 tablespoon melted real butter.  Then I put the crust back in the fridge while I made the filling. I also preheated a large cookie sheet in the oven at 425 and then set the pie crust on it right before filling.  Filling changes I made: I doubled the spices and added even another teaspoon of cinnamon.  I also added 1/4 t of allspice. Used 1/2 cup white and 1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar. I wish I would have covered my crust edges with foil BEFORE I put pie in the oven like a previous reviewer did. I did it 1/2 way through the baking time and that was a PAIN! Next time I'm going to add a 1/4 t of orange extract to see if that is good. This is no fail, but the original recipe would be too bland for me.

I don't know what recipe my family has been using all these years, but it was my duty to make the pumpkin pie this year. As I had no "family recipe" to follow, I used the one on the back of the pumpkin can (also the one found here!). I got such rave reviews - even from people who don't normally like pumpkin pie! - that I couldn't believe it! The pie was perfectly set (not dry or too soggy) and the spices were perfect! I will DEFINITELY be making this again. I served it with fresh whipped cream.

I've made this recipe for a couple of years now. While the original is good, I prefer to add more sugar and spices to give it more flavor. I also add a bit off allspice and nutmeg. Turns out great!

My only complaint with this recipe is that I had way too much filling for my deep dish pie crust. It baked up just fine, but I had to pour a good cup of filling down the sink. I also doubled the spices...when I put the amount that the recipe called for in, I couldn't even smell them in the filling. I've never made this particular recipe for pumpkin pie before, and I'm not entirely sure that I will make it again. I switched out dark brown sugar for the white sugar, which is something that I always do with pumpkin or apple pies, that is jsut my taste preference. I don't have complaints with the taste, that's great, my main issue was with how much filling I had to dump down the drain. The cooking time was spot on, so I will use that in another recipe. Oh, well...I'll just continue on with my search for the perfect pumpkin pie...thanks for trying, Libby's!

I wish I could say I loved it, but I just didn't.  When I saw so many positive reviews I was excited to try it. It came out fine, it looks beautiful and has wonderful consistency.  But as another reviewer stated, it's just missing something.  Can't put my finger on it. I don't know if it needs more sugar AND more spice or even something to make it seem creamier.  It's OK.

We thought this was great, it is a traditional pumpkin pie.  We did increase all of the spices because we happen to like it that way.  One note, next time we would probably decrease the sugar - it was a little sweeter than desired for us.  We also made this from a fresh pumpkin - very easy to do, throw cut up pumpkin (with skin) into a stock pot and cook.  It is very easy to remove skin after cooked.  Also, we used an immersion blender to purify the pumpkin and remove any lumps!

Really good taste but found it was slightly underdone at the minimum cooking time. The knife came out clean, but the finished product wasn't "solid" enough for me although others in the family loved it!

Let me start of by saying that I can't stand pumpkin pie. I LOATHE it.  However, every thanksgiving my family wants me to make them a pumpkin pie, since I guess my pies rock. XD I don't know exactly how this one tasted... but I ended up making THREE pies with this recipe. My family loved this pie so much, I'm going to have to make it for Christmas too.

Great, traditional pumpkin pie!  Only change was to replace the sugar with Splenda.  I had to bake this one a little longer than time recommended.

This is the best recipe for pumpkin pie! No need to look further. Be sure your spices are fresh. It's worth the cost to buy new ones. It makes a huge difference!  Very easy foolproof recipe that you can count on every time.

This is the perfect, classic pumpkin pie in my opinion. I have tried and made others, but none have ever topped this recipe. This is the recipe my Grandmom has used for many, many years, and I continue to do the same. :)

Best Pumpkin Pie I've ever had! I do add a little more sugar and spices, sometimes sprinkling cinnamon and sugar on top. It gives it a nice autumn look and heightens the taste and arouma even more!

I made this for thanksgiving for my husband and he really did not like it. He said all he could taste was the orange juice. So if you use this recipe I would suggest not using the orange juice .

I just wanted to say that I have always used this recipe for my pumpkin pies, and it always turns out excellently!
I also want to add that by simply replacing the sugar with granulated splenda (the kind that measures cup for cup), this pie also tastes amazing - you can't tell AT ALL that it's sugar free unless you actually try one right after the other.  And let me say, I hate anything made with artificial sweeteners, and I still liked it and couldn't tell the difference.  I made this pie sugar free last thanksgiving for my mother-in-law who is diabetic, and she was not the only one who ate it!  The pie was gone by the end of the night (and there were 4 other non-sugar-free pies to choose from, including another pumpkin that wasn't sugar free!)
This would be a fantastic recipe to use for diabetics, dieters, and sweet-toothers alike!  For christmas I will be skipping the non-sugar-free one and just making one with splenda!

The BEST! I add a little more ginger and clove to taste and often use 2% evaporated milk. This pie comes out perfect everytime and tastes wonderful. I serve with whipped cream and sprinkle with cinnamon.

I only use 1/2 cup sugar & I use brown sugar instead of white.  I also omit the cloves, my mom doesn't like them so I've gotten used to leaving them out.  I don't know why anyone would buy a pumpkin pie when they are this easy to make & taste so much better!

The pie is delicious. It took a little bit longer than stated but maybe by 5-8 minutes. I covered the edges of the pie crust after about 25-30 minutes to avoid burning. I also used 1 3/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the ginger/cloves/cinnamon, as stated on the Libby's can for substitution. Serve with whipped topping!

A reliable favorite.  I do split the sugar 1/2 white 1/4 brown.  Sub Evaporated for almond milk (or soy, rice...) and eggbeaters for whole eggs.  I also add 1/8 cup bourbon and skip the salt.  I throw in a tablespoon of flour to balance the added liquid.  Delicious!

One Thanksgiving eve I was baking pumpkin pies and I use this recipe.  I discovered that I did not have any canned milk.  I used Coffeemate Hazelnut creamer and it was awesome!  I have made it with the creamer ever since.  When people eat my pumpkin pie they always say "this is the best pumpkin pie I have ever eaten."

i HAVE USED THIS RECIPE FOR 90 YEARS!  It's darn snappy!  But instead of pumpkin, i have always used yams.  Instead of sugar we always use maple syrup (from a maple tree), and the top should be crispy!

This is one of the best pumpkin pie recipes I have tried.  The only modifications I made were as follows: 1) add some nutmeg (less than 1/4 t), and 2) add slightly more cinnamon.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Great pie.  I didn't have cloves so added nutmeg instead.  Some do's: Do, prebake homemade crust.  I made a graham craker crust and just let it chill first - it was soggy.  Do let the pie cool in the oven for a while - no cracks.  If you have time, mix the pumpkin and spices in advance and let them sit in the fridge for a bit - heating canned pumpkin on the stove with the spices was a good tip as well.  Enjoy!

As always, perfect! I use pumpkin pie spice and extra cinnamon, even a dash of nutmeg. Love it!

i absolutely love this recipe.  i add about 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the pumpkin mixture and it is sooooooooooo good.    pie crust can be tricky... take the pie out after the first 15 minutes of baking, and wrap a piece of foil around the outside of the baking dish, and folding over to cover the exposed crust (but not touching!) .  This will prevent the crust from burning.  reduce the oven temp as instructed, and put the pie back in to finish baking.  Be gentle!  the filling will slosh!

The Best Ever!  I have used this for many years.  I do have a few variations.  Substitute half cream and half premium eggnog (or if you love rich all eggnog) for canned milk.  I also like a little nutmeg in the pie.  Brown sugar makes it richer.  Sometimes a topping is good, my favorite is pecans, brown sugar and butter mixed together to make a crumble.  Mix 1/2 cup soft butter and half cup brown sugar to course consistency add 2/3 cup   course chopped pecans. Gently cover top of cooled pie, put under broiler until starts to bubble Bubble about 3 minutes.  Cool. ENJOY THIS BEST PIE EVER

I was raised on this pie. This is the exact recipe, right off the can's label, that my mother, grandmother and great-grandmother always baked. I've experimented with many different pumpkin pie recipes and though many have been delicious, THIS is the quintessential Pumpkin Pie Recipe. Stop searching for another, and enjoy this foolproof classic!

I do change this one quite a bit to make it my Grandmas recipe, its only half a can of evaporated milk, and we are not fond of the other spices, so we use only Cinnamon and make it 2 TBS. I have several people who ask me to make this every year and they use to not even like pumpkin pie, its amazing what moitting the other spices and adding extra cinnamon does for the recipe!!! Try it and see how people rave!!!!

This is the only pumpkin pie recipe my family will let me make!  I make 2 pies at a time, doubling all the ingredients except the condensed milk.  It makes the pies a little richer tasting.  I'm always asked to bring the pumpkin pies for get-togethers, everyone wonders why my pumpkin pies are so much better than theirs!  At our fall church social, I usually take 6-8 pies, and mine are always the first ones gone.

Wonderful recipe! A great classic I must say. Made it for my family to celebrate the beginning of the week and oh,  they loved it! I actually used my own homemade pumpkin puree and I personally think the flavor is so much more delicate and delicious!

I've been making this pie since I was old enough to stand up and roll pie dough!  This is the recipe my mother always used, and I've always used it. I was looking for something different this year but after reading what "naples" had to say, I said "what's wrong with me?"...if it aint broke don't fix it. I will continue to make this again this year. Last year our dear friend Karl said it was the BEST pumpkin pie he'd EVER eaten...what a compliment!  Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!

The BEST and most SIMPLE pumpkin pie recipe ever!?! For a twist, my husband made a graham cracker crust. Refrigerate the pumpkin pie until it's completely cold before serving. Serve with a scoop of cool whip-it was DIVINE!!! My husband and I ate the entire pie in one day!?! Am DEFINITELY buying more ingredients to make more this week!!!! :D

Cooked at 425 for 15 min then 350 degrees for 48 min. Perfect. Will have to remember next time to leave the height of the pie dough (I wasn't sure if I should fold it over I forgot the batter rises slightly while cooking. I might consider tenting the edges with foil next time too.

I bake fairly often, for a guy. I just flat out love to eat. My wife seems to enjoy almost everything I bake, especially this pie. I bring the cloves and ginger up 50% to give it added kick. Nobody has complained yet.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year and right off the bat I realized i had made a mistake and did not buy the deep dish pie shell but shallow ones so i made two thinner pies.  I put foil on the crust so it didn't burn.  Then I was so busy doing other things that when my timer went off i just turned it off without taking the pies out, i remembered soon after and they ended up being a bit overbaked but on turkey day they got rave reviews.  A very delicious and forgiving recipe if the pie is overbaked.  Will definately be my go to pumpkin pie.

Every Thanksgiving I make 12 or more pumpkin pies so after dinner every family group should be able to take a pie home w/them :>) This is the only basic pumpkin pie recipe i've ever used. I do change it a lil though I take out the ginger and cloves and add 1t vanilla. I split the sugar 1/2 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar (dont fill the cups alll the way to the top though) in the yrs i grow new england pie pumpkin, jarradale squash, acorn, butternut, cinderella squash or other good pie pumpkin or squash I use 1/2 Libbys canned pumpkin and 1/2 any of the mix above (after baking it dwn to smooth consistancy then put in blender 1/2 libbys 1/2 squash mix let cool) add rest of pie ingredients and pour in crust :>)

Made 2 of these pies for family and they raved!  I followed the recipe for the most part, making a few minor changes.  I like a lot of spice in my desserts so I added more than the recipe called for of the cloves, cinnamon, sugar and ginger.  I used both brown and white sugar.  I added a healthy splash of vanilla extract to the pumpkin filling as well.  Instead of using evaporated milk, I used a can of Fat Free Sweetened Condensed Milk I had on hand already.  (I would have used ½ a can if I were making just one pie.)  As the recipe stated, I also used DEEP DISH PIE CRUSTS and had no problem at all with overspill in my oven.  My family loved it and a few said they never liked Pumpkin Pie but really enjoyed this one!  (Reportedly, “Everyone can’t make a good Pumpkin Pie”)

Excellent.  Mine had to cook a total of about 1 1/2 hours -not sure why but the finished product was perfect!  My only change next time will be covering my crust a little earlier since it got a little darker than I like due to the longer bake time.

Made my very first pumpkin pie using this recipe. My hubby and I have a major sweet tooth and I LOVE using brown sugar so I added 2/3 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup white sugar. Yes, it turned out VERY sweet, but we loved it. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. It turned out delicious! Now my oldest sister isn't the only one in the family who can make pumpkin pie!

Super easy, low fuss, and always a crowd pleaser. I don't let my wife chase me out of the kitchen on Thanksgiving until I have this one done.

I love this pie recipe and have made it many times.  Once I forgot to add the milk and it was still good.   I have made it without a crust both in the microwave and in the oven, which cuts down on carbs and fat.  I have made it with just cinnamon and ginger.  Recently, I have been using Penzeys Pumpkin Pie seasoning.  Delicious.  Sometimes I use 2 tablespoons sugar and 1/2 cup splenda.  This pie is hard to mess up.  It's so good.

Excellent! I added a splash (1 tsp) vanilla which really enhanced the flavor. I used fresh pumpkin and everyone raved over the pie!    For the fresh pumpkin I bought a small "pumpkin pie pumpkin" also called a "sugar pumpkin" (they are small and more tasty). Split it in half, bake face down 350 deg for about 45 min.  The skin will fall right off.  You can freeze any extra for up to 3 months.

I just out the 5th one I've made into the oven. Fantastic recipe. There is really no wrong way to make this delectable pie. The only change I make is to decrease the amount of milk (I use around 2/3 of a can). Perrrrrfectttiiiioonnnn!

Awesome recipe.  I made the mistake of picking of up a graham cracker, non deep dish crust and we had too much filling.  It tasted fabulous though.  Already saved in my recipe book at home.

Turned out great! My husband loves pumpkin pie and devours grocery store varieties in a couple days. He requested a homemade version and I tried to oblige, never having made this type of pie before (I'm not a fan of pumpkin pie). Following the advice of other reviewers, I substituted 1/2 c brown and 1/4 c white sugar and added 1 tbsp flour to increase density, 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg, and 2 tsp vanilla extract to the wet mix. Covering the crust edges with foil for the first 25 minutes to prevent it from burning was great advice! (I made the No Roll Pie Crust recipe on this site.) I used the whole can of evaporated milk because otherwise the mixture only filled the pie plate halfway. Next time I’ll try just using half to see if it amplifies the pumpkin flavor. My husband said it had a fluffier, airier consistency than store-bought pies and that the flavor was subtle, yummy and "homemade tasting".  My brother-in-law, who also loves pumpkin pie, ate it with his hands. I guess that's a compliment to the recipe! Will definitely make again.

easy & yummy - followed other reviews & used 1/2 cup br sugar and 1/4 cup white - also used 2 tsp cinnamon & 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (made my own with recipe on this site) came out nice & flavorful.  Used fat free evap milk & didn't change taste or texture.  Used frozen deep dish pie shell & had quite a bit of batter left over so I greased a small pyrex dish & baked it alongside the pie so now have pumpkin pie & pudding!! Very good & easy.

I was going through an old recipe box from mid-1970s, entering some as personal recipes.  This exact one I had taped to a card, well used and well loved.  Foolproof and delicious everytime for decades!

This is my 'go to' recipe with just a couple revisions. Since we don't do white sugar in our home, I substitute 1 cup real maple syrup. I add one mashed/baked sweet potato to compensate for the liquid then double the cinnamon and cloves and use 1 TBS. of fresh grated ginger which bumps up the spices a notch.

Any other pie just does not taste right!  I now do use Splenda instead of the sugar (same amount) and it is wonderful.

My absolute favorite thing in this world for the last 40 years! As a Halloween born baby, this has even taken place of my birthday cake. When I was 6 my mommy made these pies for Thanksgiving dinner and I got out of bed and spoon ate one whole pie only leaving the crust behind! I'm in love with Libbys recipe and nothing compares to make it and share memories with your kids!

5 stars, definitely.  I've used half and half in place of the evaporated milk (I didn't have evaporated milk) and it came out beautifully.  Very creamy.  My family and guests raved over it.  Either way it's a perfect pumpkin pie.  I've never used anything but Libby's Pumpkin for 50 years.

I love this recipe! Perfect just the way it is.  I do not like reviewing a recipe based on any changes so my 5 star review is based on the original recipe.  I was feeling a bit brave today and I am one that likes a little bit more spice in my pie and I have found that doubling the spices (ginger, cloves, & cinnamon) and adding 1/4 c sugar makes it oh so good!! It was perfect!! It added the perfect amount of spice without taking away from the pie. Love this recipe just the way it is or with the added spices and sugar!!

its a classic recipe. I like to add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the spices. Also this is good with all white sugar, all brown sugar, or a mix of both. You really can't go wrong. I've even used a subsitute for evaporated milk with no problem. 2/3rd cup nonfat powder milk to 3/4cup water makes 8oz of evaporated milk.  1/3cup powder milk to 1/2 cup + 1/8th cup of water , mix together to make 4oz.

I just made this with fresh pumpkin and it is the best pie I've ever had!  The only difference was I used 1 tsp pumpkin spice and 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 of the sugar was brown (as one reviewer suggested).  Amazing how great the fresh pumpkin makes it taste!

The flavor was great. I used 2% evaporated milk and it worked just fine.   My only complaint is that the crust was mushy. I wonder if precooking it a little would've helped.

Mmm...yummy. I did the brown sugar/white sugar mix, 3/4 can of evaporated milk, and 2.5 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. Very tasty, but really soft. I just wish it was a little more firm, I may add a little less milk next time.

This is the only pumpkin pie recipe I use!  I do use 50% more spices just to add to the flavor.  I also add a tablespoon molasses, just because my mom always does that.  :) Oh, and if I'm cutting calories, I make it crustless.  Just spray the pie pan with Pam and bake according to directions.  It works GREAT!

I do not eat pumpin pie but I made it for my family since they all love it.  It's the first pie I have ever baked.  I did make one mistake though...I bought a extra thick graham cracker crust instead of a "pastry" type crust...my family loved the mistake.  We will definitely be making this again!

Awesome, awesome, awesome....my son just about ate the whole pie himself! Did not change a thing and to make things easier, I just used the ready made crust you can get from the dairy section of the grocery store.

I love this recipe! It's the one my family has used for years. The only change I make sometimes is to add more spices, but it's great either way. I might try the suggestion of adding a little flour to the filling and leaving out the crust some time since I don't care for the crust part anyway!

What an amazing recipe! A real keeper!  I doubled the recipe as I wanted 2 pies.  In the doubling of it rather than add 2 cans of evaporated milk I put in 1 can of evaporated milk and 1 can of Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk - amazing! Also I added extra spices except for the cloves as I didn't want my pie to too dark.  I also added about 1 tsp of fresh grated nutmeg and 1 tbsp of flour as suggested by one other review - so easy to cut - that definately firmed it up and prevented it from being the slightest bit runny! I served this with maple flavoured whip cream! To die for!  My guests last night said "This is the best pumpkin pie I've had in my whole life!" You won't be dissapointed with this recipe!

I prefer this recipe to Eagle's. Now Libby's makes an easy pumpkin pie mix that includes the spices to make pies even easier. If I am really hungry, I omit the pie crust and simmer everything thing else in a pot until hot for a makeshift pumpkin pudding.

I have made all types of pumpkin pies over the years; I have used praline toppings, layers of cheese, you name it. In the end, my family asks for this simple, perfectly spiced pie.  After this year's Thanksgiving dessert buffet my neighbor asked to take the rest of this pie home!

This is by far the best recipe I've ever found for pumpkin pie. I prefer to substitute some of the white sugar with brown sugar and add a little extra cinnamon. YUMMY!!

This pie turned out really well even though I didn't read the directions on how to mix it up.  I just dumped all the ingredient into the bowl and then mixed it. On the second pie I followed the direction to the letter and the pie's didn't turn out any differently.  Really easy and good tasting pumpkin pie.

I have used this recipe for over 30 years and have to make it every year for the Holidays.  I am the pie maker for all of the holidays.  This is the same recipe I think my grandmother used. I am the youngest in the family and they all say "It is just like Grandma Welding's"

Went over well at Thanksgiving.  I'll have to play with the recipe as I think that high altitude has some effect on the baking time.

I’ve made this pie several times now and it’s delicious! You can tell it’s done by gently shaking it. It will wiggle a little but won’t wave like a liquid. It’s great as is, but I followed the suggestion of another reviewer this time and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar and you can really tell a difference and it is perfect that way.

Love this. I’ve noticed that this recipe fills a nine inch pie shell COMPLETELY and if you are using a flimsy aluminum pie tin, it’s impossible to pick up the uncooked pie without spilling everywhere. My solution was to reserve a generous portion of the filling—at least one cup—and then poor it into the shell as soon as t’s in the oven. You’ll probably need to remove the top rack to have room for this. This gives me a little room for error and saves a lot of mess!

Takes perfectly like the kind your remember. I always end up with a little extra filling left over, though, but I add the leftover filling to other stuff like my muffins for extra flavor.

My first time making pumpkin pie and it was delicious.  I had fun trying this recipe.  I did not have ground cinnamon, so I took out my mortar and pestle and started pounding my cinnamon sticks until it was finely grounded.  The taste of this pie made it worthwhile.

This is my go to recipe for Thanksgiving pumpkin pie. It's so easy to make, and everyone always loves it. I increase the cinnamon just for our personal tastes and add a dash of Mexican vanilla. You really can't mess this recipe up. Just be sure to bake the pie on a cookie sheet. The filling will go up to the very edge of the crust and may overflow a little bit since it's a runny batter. Sometimes I leave out 1/4 cup of the filling to keep that from happening. If you want an easy, foolproof recipe, this one is hard to beat.

A great recipe!!  Did add a bit extra of the spices since we like a bit stronger spice flavor.

Every year the family calls me and asks are your bringing that secret recipe pumpkin pie!  I smile and tell them it would not be a holiday with out it!  The only thing I do different is do double the amount of spice I put in there!  I think it gives it some extra zip

I love this pie!  My husband and I attended a Thanksgiving dinner, and we decided to bring this pie.  Little did we know that two other people brought pumpkin pies also!  Out of the three, ours was definitely the best.  The only change I made was to switch up the amounts of ginger and cloves, because I don't really like ginger so much.

I hate pumpkin pie.

This pumpkin pie is the first pumpkin pie in the history of pumpkin pie that I have not hated.

In fact, I enjoyed it.

IT RULES.

The pie was a hit! The only change I made was cut the sugar in half, and it turned out to be the perfect sweetness for our taste.

So easy and was a hit.  I subbed about 8 oz. sweetened condensed milk for evaporated milk.  Also baked the crust for a few minutes by itself before filling, based on tips from others.  Used fresh ginger, and this was perfect.

Great pie!  I ran out of eggs Thanksgiving Day so I  substituted with flax seed.  The spice combination was perfect; all this pie needs is a dollop of whipping cream on top.

This is the very best pumpkin pie recipe ever! I grew up eating my mom's pies with this recipe, and I've made it countless times myself. A little real whipped cream is all the embellishment it needs. I have successfully made it substituting fresh milk for the evaporated with no problems, too.

I've been using this recipe for 30 years and no one has ever grown tired of it.  I usually buy the big can of pumpkin and make two pies, but today I only needed one pie (plan to make pumpkin roll with the other half of the can).  Not to make myself sound too dumb, it was nice to print this recipe for just one pie and not have to calculate down from two pies.  Thanks.

This has become a classic in our household.  My mother made this for our holiday celebrations beginning in the 1970's.  I still have her "Libby's Famous Pumpkin Pie" pie pan she got from sending in Libby's labels.  I know that my daughter and future daughter's in law will be making this for years to come!

I have tried many pumkin pie recipes through the years, but this is the best.  I made two pies today, and they were so good, I couldn't hardly stop eating on them.  Me and my husband say it is the best we have ever eaten.  The pies came out of the oven perfect.  Went by recipe completely.

I decided to try something new this Thanksgiving as my 10yr old daughter & I were making dinner together for the first time. The pie turned out great and is so easy next time she can make it herself. Cheers to new traditions!!

I actually really dislike pumpkin pie, but always have friends nagging me to make one during the holidays.  This is the easiest pie to make ever!  The filling takes maybe 5 minutes and I get a ridiculous amount of compliments on it and requests for more.  I always go a little heavy on the spices.

Great pumpkin pie! I made this for my guys at work and it went so fast! I am not even a pumpkin pie fan and I thought it was great! I did use less milk than it called for but not that much less. I am glad I did because when I poured the mixture into the pie crust it completely over flowed! And I did add a little more cinnamon than it called for...thanks for the recipe.

I made two pumpkin pies from this recipe and they were both absolutely prefect! I didn't change a thing and wouldn't. Fantastic! I had a little extra filling so I greased a small stone ware dish and baked it in there. Yummy! Pumpkin pie without the crust.

I made this for the 1st time this year @Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Like some of the others who left a review I used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar and it came out perfect. This was simple an easy for me to make being a not so great cook.

I followed the recipe exactly, except at the end of the baking time, I turned off the gas and let it cool in the oven. Your pie will not crack that way.   There may be better recipes out there for pumpkin pie, but I haven't found one yet. Its easy to make and tastes wonderful just as written. 348 other cooks agree.

Fantastic recipe.  I needed to cook about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for, likely due to oven temperature variation.  Next time I might add just a bit more spice otherwise the recipe is absolutely terrific.  I received many compliments!

My favorite recipe for a pumpkin pie!  This recipe is by far the best!  I have made this version of pumpkin pie for at least the past 10 years.  Only once did I stray; I decided to try a pumpkin-cheesecake pie.  It was okay, but just not the same if you're wanting that "pumpkin/spice" flavor.  This time I added one tablespoon of rum to the recipie......can I say YUMMY?

I was horrified when I got back from the store and realized I had no ginger. But substituting pumpkin pie spice worked okay. My boyfriend called it "absolutely delicious" when he usually just says everything is "good". I also used little individual graham cracker pie crusts. Next time I will use ginger and I bet it will be even better, if that's possible.

I use to make pumpkin filling from scratch and one year I didn't have time to cook fresh pumpkin and used Libby's. Everyone remarked how delicious my pie tasted! The only change I make is half light brown and half white sugar and I omit the cloves

I always use this recipe, but I have to use coconut milk in place of the evaporated milk.  Our son has sever life threatening food allergies (allergic to milk and peanuts).  So this one small modification makes it so everyone can enjoy this fall tradition.  I also whip up some coconut cream to make a nice topping.

My mother made this recipe all her adult life, and so have I.  It's a classic.  The only thing I do a little differently is that I never use ginger, I substitute a half teaspoon of allspice instead.  It gives it a unique flavor without distracting from the wonderful classic recipe.

I made two of these last year and am making another one (possibly two) this year. When I first made it I couldn't believe how easy it was to make a pumpkin pie and it tastes perfect! However, I did also add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg because I like the extra flavor. It's in the oven now and I can't wait to dig in!

It is hard to improve on perfection! I made this pie in a graham cracker crust from this site. Turned out picture perfect! Only change I made was one suggested by one review of 1/2c brown sugar and 1/4c of white instead of the 3/4c of white sugar. Great flavor. I'll be making more of these this month!!

This is a very good recipe, have used it for years.  The only one better is the one on the back of the can of Royal City brand Pumpkin, unfortunately it is very difficult to find.  If you can find it, try it, you'll love it.

THE BEST!  I've been using this recipe for years.  I always use the large can of pumpkin to make two pies because one is never enough in our house! To "benbauer"...I also end up with too much filling for two pies.  Not sure if its because I only use the frozen deep dish crusts (never been a from scratch crust maker), but I just spray a small pie plate and bake the extra filling in that and have an extra crustless mini pie...yum!

If you want a traditional pumpkin pie, this recipe is it.  I make this exactly as directed, but in my oven I need to bake an additional 60 minutes after the oven temp is decreased to 350.

My son does not eat the pie crust----so I always make this recipe and just bake it in a Corning Ware pan without the pie crust.  He calls it pumpkin pudding and has asked for it this ways for years.

I bought a deep dish crust, however, I still had way too much filling (about 1 cup extra). My whole family seemed to like the pie.  It was not what I expected though.  It was much lighter and creamier in texture than the store bought variety and it was also a bit less sweet.  Although not quite what I expected, the taste was excellent.  I would make it again.

really good flavour & lovely soft texture. I used light brown sugar in the filling and made it using a honey-graham wafer crumb\brown sugar pie case which just melted into the filling. Delicious - even my very picky 5 year old loved it - she said it tasted "like gingerbread-man pudding".

you can never go wrong with this recipe. I always substitute the evaporated milk for condensed and it makes the pie very moist and sweet. I also substitute pumpkin pie spice for all the spices called for in the recipe.

There is nothing like the famous Libby's pumkin pie recipe.  I made this for my mother in-law, who is 86 yrs old. She is into the everything's better homemade, so don't tell her I used store bought pie crust. I got her approval, and then later found out that she uses this recipe too, except she does make her own pie crust with LARD, like they used to do more, back in the day. From her time to mine, the recipe remains the same, no need to change perfection. That is why it's famous. 5+ stars, worth saving.

Easy. Perfect. Delicious. I made this using Libby's pumpkin but I put 1 can Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated. No sugar needed. Put the salt, cinnamon and instead of ginger I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. 2 eggs. I didn't use a deep dish! The regular pie shells work best. My husband said this was the best pumpkin pie he has had.

The best pumpkin pie recipe I have found so far!  I think using all the individual spices instead of pumpkin spice makes the difference!  I added a pinch of nutmeg as well and made it with a graham cracker crust from Henry's.  I used mostly brown sugar and a little white sugar.  I also only used 3/4 of the can of evaporated milk and added 1/4 can of sweetened and condensed milk.  My boyfriend is a pumpkin pie lover and he said it's the best one he's ever had!!  :-)  That was quite a compliment so this one's a keeper for sure!

This is my go-to pumpkin pie recipe.  Always turns out perfect.  I tear strips of aluminum foil and cover the crust for most of the baking process, and only uncover for the last 10-15 minutes because somehow the crust always seemed to burn before the pie was completely cooked through.  But now with the foil, perfect pie and crust, every time.

My mom makes amazing pies and this is the recipe she always uses for pumpkin pie.   My husband has developed a dairy allergy and I've found that soy milk works great as a substitute for the canned milk. It also turns out well using Splenda.

This is the recipe I always use for pumpkin pie and it's fantastic.  I made it this year with a gingersnap cookie crust (2 cups finely ground cookies plus about 1/2 cup of melted butter)--mmmm.  A great combination.

An old time classic that I made this year with the input of Muscleman. I made exactly as recipe indicated except I thought I had ground cloves (they were whole) so so I added a little Nutmeg in its place. Less spices do enhance the flavor or the pie.  Delicious and a nice ending to a turkey dinner. Thanks all!

My mom has made this pie since I was little and now I make it for my family.  The only thing we changed is the cooking time, I like a firmer pie, so I bake it 40 extra minutes.  Yum! Oh and I freeze these all the time, but we really don't like crusts all that much, so we don't care if the crust separate, we don't really care how it looks, it still tastes just a wonderful and when it is first bakes, just without the crust.

This recipe is pretty much The Gold Standard for pumpkin pie.  Hershey's has a recipe for Perfectly Chocolate Cake on the back of their cocoa container that I think is the same quality (recipe is on allrecipes.com).  When a company puts the same recipe on the back of their products for YEARS you gotta' know they're 'on' to something!

My two year-old daughter and I made this pie together and she had only one thing to say--"Mmm Mmm Pie"!  She ate two pieces herself and the family polished off the rest.  Perfectly spiced, light, and creamy.  A definite favorite, my daughter cannot wait to make our next pie!  We used a crust from the dairy section of the grocery store in a deep-dish pie plate which held all of the filling quite easily.  My crust was browning too quickly, so I draped a piece of aluminum foil over the pie halfway through baking and it turned out great.

Do not ignore the calling for a deep dish pie crust.  I made the mistake of using a standard crust and it spilled over. Yikes!  Otherwise the pie is great.

This was actually one of the first pies I ever made as a teenager! It's great for a just-starting out cook, virtually foolproof. When I made this, I used pumpkin pie spice and topped it with Gingered Whipped Cream.

The perfect pumpkin pie.  We have always used this recipe.  I usually add a full cup of sugar because we like it sweet.  I can't bring myself to try another recipe because this one is great.

I make this pie for the holidays every year, and we love it! However, I substitute the cloves with nutmeg. I also made a mistake and left it at 425 degrees for the first 30 minutes, changed it to 350, and baked it the rest of the 15 minutes or so (until it wasn't VERY jiggly in the middle). It came out GREAT!!! It's very soft and creamy!
I think I'll try the 2 T. cinnamon only next time. I still might add a little nutmeg, too.

My specialty is usually sweet potato pie, but I have to make pumpkins as well around the holidays, and this recipe fits the bill nicely.  A great, flavorful pie thats easy to make.

Tried and true recipe.  This makes a perfect old-fashioned pumpkin pie with the perfect amount of firmness and texture and flavor.  Don't try to "tweak" this one...it is perfect "as is".

An excellent pie recipe. I found it on the can of Libby's pumpkin, and then found it here and thought I would rave about it. I hadn't made a pumpkin pie before today (I've made lots of pies, but this is my first pumpkin), and it turned out great. I had problems with the crust browning a little too much too fast, so I covered the crust with foil and kept baking it, keeping a close watch on everything... And it turned out amazing. I like my pumpkin pie cold, so I stuck it in the fridge (after cooling on the counter for a couple hours) for four hours, dabbed some Whipped Cream (recipe from this site) on it, and enjoyed! My husband, who isn't a pie fan, ate two pieces! Thanks for the recipe!!

I love Pumpkin pie, Libby's has always been my absolute favorite, even compared to fresh pumpkins.  On the Libby's can it has alternate directions also, and that is the one I follow.  On the can it says you can subsitute Pumpking pie spice instead of ginger and cloves, YUMMY!

Without a doubt, this is THE classic pumpkin pie recipe. I didn't change anything except I cut back on the evaporated milk a little. It's not necessary to adjust the seasonings at all... you can't even taste the cloves in the final result (for those of you who don't like cloves).

I have used their canned pumpkin for over 40 years.  I modify the recipe (I accidentally had to when I was young as I did not have all the correct ingredients) and it is perfect.  Instead of using  2 cans of Evaporated Milk, I use 1 can of evaporated milk and a 1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk.  Makes a delicious (a little meatier) firmer pie.

This is the Libby's canned pumpkin pie recipe we grew up with -  delicious and simple. The ONLY change for ME now is that I don't use the entire can of evaporated milk anymore - it's just too thin that way. I use about 2/3 of the can.

Delicious.  The baking time at 350 (after the initial 15 minutes at 425) is consistently closer to two hours.

Excellent recipe. Made it twice. It fills 2 pie crusts or makes 36 pumpkin tarts.

The recipe my mother used and the recipe I've been using for over 50 yrs. The only change I make is to add cinnamon to the spices. Am always getting asked for the recipe.

I can taste the cloves and the pie does not taste very good. I will have to find a different recipe without cloves.  It also took much longer to bake.  I made my own whipped cream which was yummy and helped the taste of the pie.

I used this recipe for the first time. It was very easy and the pie tasted very good. I pre cooked the crust (425 for 8min used a fork to poke holes on the bottom and sides of crust) prior to pouring in the filling so the crust wasn't soggy. Next time I make this pie I plan on using less evaporated milk I think it was a bit too soft for me. And add more cinnamon since I couldn't taste cinnamon much. But this is the best tasting recipe I've used so far.

Made this as the leaves were falling off the tree yesterday. Smelled and tasted like Thanksgiving! Very delicious. I added a slight dusting of nutmeg to the top as that's how my grandmother made it. Classic.

I'm 33 years old and have made this every Thanksgiving and Christmas for as long as I can remember. Rather than making one deep dish pie, I've always used 2 regular crusts, which is really convenient considering pie crusts come 2 in a pack. The amount of filling is perfect with the same amount of baking time and all. I put foil around the outer edge of the crusts so they don't get too browned. Now that I have a daughter (she is 7), I passed the tradition on to her and we call them Kaylee's Pumpkin Pie bc she's always so proud when she makes them lol. This Christmas Eve, rather than regular cookies like everyone leaves for Santa, she will be setting out a slice of this wonderful pie with some Yoohoo to wash it down haha.

Not bad, I think I actually used 14 or 14.5oz of pumpkin and used a pre-made graham cracker crust which was just perfect for the amount of filling because I opened up the foil to hold in the excess...anymore and it would have flooded over.  I also followed someone's suggestion of heating the mixture of pumpkin and spices to help blend all the flavors and allowing it to cool before mixing in the eggs.  It seemed a little bland in comparison to the 'Perfect Pumpkin Pie' recipe, but after trying it on a different occasion, it's just not as sweet and plays more on its pumpkin spice flavor. The recipe mostly lost stars because I definitely had to bake at least an extra 20min for it to bake through, and I can also see how many people would say that the filling was way too much for a 9" pie crust.

Great flavor, but it took much longer to cook than the recipe said (30 min more). Perhaps it was because of our higher elevation.

I don't like pumpkin pie... not in the slightest. Neither does my mom, yet every Thanksgiving, she requests this pie. It's the only pumpkin pie she'll eat! I do add a couple more dashes of spices to the mix because my mom prefers it that way. Sometimes I throw in a dash of nutmeg as well.

I find that this pie needs a slightly longer bake time the suggested, even with the 15 minutes at 425. Or it could just be my over! It will also bake up fine if you skip that 425 and stick it right at 350. It took an extra 20 minutes.

I have been making the Libby's Pumpkin Pie since I was a teenager.  My mother insists on it for her birthday as well.  Per my dad's suggestion one year, I added a dash of nutmeg.  Just a dash.  It rounds out all those wonderful flavors!

This pie was delicious!!! I have been using Mrs. Siggs' pie for a few years and I wanted to try something different. As much as her pie was great, this is better! Really big hit! I followed to recipe to a T except for using the nestle evaporated milk, I figures it wouldn't make a difference. This is a fantastic pie! You should definitely try it!

This is the recipe mom used as long as I can remember. She didn't like a lot of spices so she doubled the cinnamon and left out ginger & cloves. I like this recipe as written. Can't get much more simple. Mom added a tsp of vanilla and I do too. Always a hit!

Amen to this recipe, it's my favorite too. However to make it EVEN more EASILY, simply prepare it within a 2 quart pitcher and blend with an immersion "stick" blender!

This is a really good recipe.  You can turn it into a really GREAT recipe by substituting the spices in "Pumpkin Pie Spice II" by Jacquie on this same web site.

I have tried other pumpkin pie recipes, but I always come back to this one.  I use a little less ginger than is called for because I feel like it can over power the pie, but other than that it's perfect.

This was my first time making pumpkin pie. I followed the directions exactly except I used a graham cracker crust because I don't really care for it any other way. It turned out amazing and my Father even said it was better than his Mother has made all these years. I will be making this again and SOON!

This Pumpkin mixture came out perfect for my pie crust I made and formed a perfect pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving! Not too sweet and not to salty everyone ate and loved it! Although I had to by some spices which were expensive I was curious to see how the pumpkin pie spice by McCormick would have turned out with it instead but didn't use it because it was missing cloves which defintly added the perfect spice to this pie! I was scared the mixture was too liquidy when I added the carnation milk but it wasn't when it finished baking.  I'm rating this 5 stars because it came out perfect and I didn't find any problems or anything wrong with it. :)

This is the ultimate pumpkin pie recipe, I've been making it for over 40 years and my mother was making it before that.  This Thanksgiving I made one of this recipe and another from a different recipe on another site that sounded a little more exotic with the addition of cardamom and lemon zest. The Libby's Famous Pumpkin Pie won hands down, no contest.  My mother used to make a variation on this recipe by separating the eggs and beating the whites until stiff to fold into the pumpkin mixture just before pouring into the pie shells, baking temp and time the same.  Made this way, the great classic taste is retained while giving it a light, almost fluffy, texture.

Great pie! I used my homemade pumpkin puree and that's definitely the way to go. I reduced sugar too, sometimes even by 1/6-1/4 cup, depending on the pumpkin. Sugar pumpkins are so sweet to begin with there is no need for that much added sugar. I used a mixture of brown and white sugar. I increased the amount of spices very slightly and added a couple of dashes of nutmeg. This will be my standard pumpkin pie recipe from now on.

I try other recipes but always come back to this recipe!  You can't lose with it.  

I precooked the frozen unbaked pie shell first...pierced it a few times with a fork and then baked for 10 minutes at 400 degrees.  

While the crust is baking , I warm the pumpkin puree mixed with the spices and salt on the stove top and then let it cool.

I love this recipe. I have been using Japanese pumpkin for the last three years instead of the traditional pumpkin and found that it makes a sweeter filling. I believe Libby's pumpkins are Dickerson squashes. My aunt faithfully uses Dickersons every year.She has been growing them in her garden for quite some time. She just turned 80 this year.  She was the one who informed me about Libby's recipe. She also has been using it for years and loves it.

This is the same pumpkin pie my mom always made... reminds me of home ;)  FANTASTIC!  I like to cook my own pumpkin, so sometimes i'll use fresh pumpkin instead...ounce for ounce as the recipe calls for, works perfect every time!  I think it tastes better with fresh pumpkin, but that's because i'm a pumpkin fanatic!  Really, this is a great pie no matter how you slice it ;)

Just ok, the leftovers got stale in the fridge.  I did substitute some of the sugar for brown sugar.  Think I'll stick with the recipe on the back of the can.

Classic pumpkin pie recipe! Just added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar as well. I covered the crust with foil at the first 15 minutes in the oven. It turned out wonderful!

Tried and true! Who knew that the best pumpkin pie recipe was on the side of the can all along! I WOULD suggest placing the pie on a cookie sheet before filling it and placing it in the oven that way you won't have a huge mess if any spills and I would NOT suggest using pumpkin pie spice in place of the individual spices, there's a difference. I also always end up with a bit of extra filling as others do also so I guess it's normal. If you remember you could use that extra filling for tarts! This is definitely one of our staples during the holidays.

This really is a classic pumpkin pie recipe; gotta love it.  I did use an equal amount of fresh (baked and pureed) pumpkin and not canned.  Tasted great.

Perfection! I try a new pumpkin recipe quite often but this one is always on the menu. My kids would throw a total fit if I were to leave it out. This year I tried a much higher rated pumpkin pie recipe and I had a taste test with the kids and grandkids. Hands down the Libby's came out on top. Thank you Libby's for a wonderful product and a wonderful recipe!

My family gobbled this up this Thanksgiving and gave it rave reviews!  No leftovers here.  Why buy a pre-made one from the store when you can have a fresh, extra delicious one with minimal effort?  Highly recommended.

delicious! sweet with the perfect blend of spices.   It is also very easy to make, I just found out last night that we would be staying home for thanksgiving and the pie is already made.   I recommend actually using the Libby's (R) filling though because other canned pumpkin might not have as good quality or flavor.    Absolutely love it!

I'm sorry but for some reason this pie came out almost awful for me. My husband loves pumpkin pie and I have another recipe I use but I wanted to try this highly rated one.... it came out too spicy! i dont know what I did wrong, and I'm sure it was just my measurements. I'll have to play around with this more and re-rate. but I see everyone else enjoys it so i'm not going to bring down its ratings because of my own mistake!!!! :)

Fabulous! I don't like pumpkin pie, but I couldn't stop eating the batter. I made it with sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk, and it was light and creamy. However, this recipe change recquired and extra 10-20 minutes of baking at 350 degrees.

Great pie.  I used fresh pumpkin (bake in oven, halved and covered with tin foil).  Better with a few tbsp of rum added.

Great recipe. Simple to follow, however the amount of milk as listed made my "tester pie" too soupy. The custard was not as firm as I like. I reduced the amount of milk by 1/2 can and the pie was perfection!

This is a fantastic easy recipe! made it 4 times in the last month, even for a get together and everyone loved it, I use the bigger can and doubled the rest of the ingredients and it's enough for 3 pie dishes. I also add pecans or walnuts or pumpkin roasted seeds on the top, it makes it look fancy.

I have been eating this pie since I was a child.It has never failed and it is as fond a memory as you could posssibly hope to have at any dinner table regardless of the time of year.I do not understand anyone giving this pie anything under a five star when most pumpkin pies are derived or compared to this one.It is essentially were most other pumpkin pies started their evolution ,families adjustment adjusted THIS recipe to a families cultural,religious,ethnic touches to make it theirs.This is as American as Apple pie in my opinion and we did the same to it.Ain't it great.

My mom always made this pumpkin pie recipe at Thanksgiving and at Xmas. I have had lots of other pumpkin pies--other people's homemade pies and storebought pies and bakery pies--but none of them bring back memories the way this pie does. It is an awesome recipe that is only lacking a pinch of nutmeg to make it perfect!

With the current pumpkin shortage, I wanted to include a revision I made to this recipe that worked wonderfully.  I followed this recipe exactly except that I substituted red yam for the pumpkin.  I baked two large red yams (wrapped in foil, baked at 400 for an hour).  Then I split them down the middle and scraped out the flesh.  I mashed it well and used the exact same measurement as the pumpkin.  The pie came out very nice and no one even knew it wasn't pumpkin.

Third time's the charm.  This tastes bland as is.  I did 2.5x the amount of spices, so 2 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/2+  a pinch of ground cloves, and a teaspoon of nutmeg.  The pie tastes great and "has a kick".  Also,  I don't know whether it was because i tried to use Low Fat Evaporated Milk the first two times, but the pumpkin mix was far too watery (even when I added cornstarch) and took much longer in the oven.  So use the regular Evaporated Milke.  Also,definitely go slow when adding the milk.

This was a great, simple recipe for a first-time pie maker! I made it with a store-bought graham cracker crust and my boyfriend loved it. I will note though -- I doubled the recipe to make two pies, and I had to cut out some of the evaporated milk because it would have gotten to be too runny. I recommend cutting the liquid down to say 12oz per pie instead of 15oz.

This pie was great for me and my family. I definitely think that this recipe should call for two pie crusts though, because I had so much filling left that I actually made another pie. That, and it could have used a little more spice in my opinion. Next time, I'll add more cloves and pumpkin pie spice, and cut down the evaporated milk just a tad. I'll definitely make it again though!

I must have been one of the first people to use the recipe on Libby's can of Pumpkin in 1950. Any time I tried something different for Thanksgiving, my son would always say: "Mom, why don't you jjust make the pie we love?" It is foolproof and can't be improved on.

The only reason that I am only giving four stars is because of the cooking time. I refuse to believe that anyone cooked this pie for only 50 minutes. I used 3 cup pie plates, and they still took an hour and a half. If you want pumpkin soup, follow the recipe.

My first pie ever! The recipe was amazingly easy to follow and the consistency was perfect - not mushy, but not overly solid like cheesecake, either. I've never been a huge pumpkin pie fan, but this one won me over. Serve with some whipped cream and you're good to go!

This came out very tasty and delicious  The only changes I made was to add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp of ginger turned out great.  I also used 1 of those larger graham cracker crusts.

this is the best pie recipe. i however only use the cinnamon spice. i omit the other spices. it tastes delish. i made this over christmas to take along to a party and i am getting calls for the recipe. i use the fat free evaporated milk and it tastes the same. so if you on a diet or watching your weight, try and use fat free milk instead. it is even better than some stores and restaurants pie. this is definitely a keeper and a repeat user.

I've been using this recipe for many decades & it is the best.  Even though Libby has cut 1oz of pumpkin puree from the can, it is still delicious!  I often make this using fresh pumpkin (2 cups puree),  add a little molasses & go a little heavy on the spices.  This recipe cannot be beat.  One can always put in their personal touch (or not), such as vanilla, nuts, or extra seasoning.  Either way, you will be very very pleased!!  Homemade pie crust makes for the best pumpkin pie.

First time I made pumpkin pie was for Halloween. Awesome recipe. One thing though, I always have mix left over. What am I doing wrong?

I love this pie! I made this one and The Brown Family Pumpkin Pie this year and tried them both side by side. The Libby pie won hands down. Stick with the traditional pie! The only thing I do different is that along with all the regular spices I add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. I also make my own whipping cream. 1 C Whipping Cream (unflavored one in the carton), 1/4 C white sugar, and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Whip until peaks hold but be careful not to overwhip or you will get butter. I used Never Fail Pie Crust II.

I thought about using a different recipe this year but decided to stick with this one and we were not disappointed. This is creamy, delicious and a classic recipe.

My mom changed this a bit: in place of the white sugar use 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  Also, if the mixture is too thin add 1 or 2 tablespoons of flour to create a bit thicker consistency.  This is the one we have every Thanksgiving - it is the best!

I've used this recipe now for a few years and I LOVE it.  I always double it, use two 9 inch deep pie plates and two 796ml cans of pumpkin though.  My family loves the amount of pumpkin and using more of that makes the pie not too sweet, which is perfect for the whipped cream.

Last night I made my first attempt at Pumpkin pie. This recipe was so easy and so delicious! It bakes up so nicely and has a wonderful texture - not too dry our soupy. No wonder this recipe has such great reviews!

My first attempt at a pumpkin pie and I wanted to try before Thanksgiving!  It turned out really good with this receipe but was missing a little something.  I think next time I will take another suggestion from one of the other reviews and a little brown sugar.

A classic, always turns out fantastic! I use the premade crusts you buy in the dairy section, and you get a winning pie every time.

This is the recipe that my Grandma, Mom and now myself.  I like it because it always turns out and I can cheat and use a premade pie crust and everyone loves it.  Only thing different I do is add a dash of nutmeg.

The Timeless Classic.  Have tried other recipes but always come back to this one.  My 12-year old daughter took over the pie baking duties last Thanksgiving and wowed everyone with her first pie.  Her great grandmother asked what bakery made the pie!

Count me as another fan of this pie.  This is the best pumpkin pie.  I have made it for years.  I also like to try other types of pumpkin pie -- like with a pecan topping or with a layer of cream cheese. But I have never made any pumpkin pie recipe that people like as much as this one.

This has been my only pumpkin pie recipe for over 30 years.  I've never even wanted to try another because this is SO good.  When the pie comes out of the oven I dust the top with cinnamon and that gives it a nice appearance.  Otherwise, make it just as it is; it's wonderful!

A classic!  My husband asks me to make "my pumpkin pie" several times a year.  I omit the cloves and add a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also use a premade graham cracker crust thats been brushed wth egg white and blind baked for 5 minutes before I add the pie filling.  Mmmm mmmm good!

I remember years ago asking my Mom for her special pumpkin pie recipe and discovering that she used the one from the Libby's pumpkin can!  The only thing we do differently is use 1 1/2 tsp of cinammon and omit the cloves and nutmeg due to personal preference.  I always tell people that I love pumpkin pie, but the truth is that I love THIS pumpkin pie - there are many others that I've tried and didn't like at all.  It's excellent with Cool Whip on top.  Yum!

This was the first pumpkin pie I ever made.  While it was a breeze to make for a novice like me, I was disappointed when the filling settled into a thinner layer.  Next time I will double the recipe as suggested. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices  -- very good.

Since I don’t have a mind that memorizes recipes, it is nice to have what I consider to be the best pumpkin pie recipe easily accessible if I happen to buy a different brand of canned pumpkin than Libby’s. Thanks for submitting this!

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made. Used this recipe for the first time and everyone loved it. I substituted the pie crust for an xl graham cracker one as people in our family hate pie crust. It looked a little brown but everyone loved it!!

I added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg for more flavor and used heavy cream instead of evaporated milk for creamier and smoother texture (I read on some blogs/reviews that evaporated milk can make the pie watery) and it was delicious! Everyone in my family loved it!! Two of these mixtures filled 3 aluminum pans with the prepared pie crusts. I used 2 of those prepared pie crusts for the lattice of my apple pie so for those dishes I made a homemade graham cracker crust which went SUPER well with the pie - I definitely recommend this pie with graham cracker crust!!

This is my go-to recipe for pumpkin pie.   I leave out the extra sugar, bc my family doesn't like things too sweet.  When my daughter was 5 and she was on "chemo", this was ALL she wanted to eat. She told me the other day that she ate 9 pumpkin pies that holiday season..!  She's all grown up with three girls of her own-  I attribute her recovery and health to the pumpkin pies! :)

Best pumpkin pie EVER! Mom would always use this recipe for pumpkin pies and now for 30 years I have also. But now I've had to make changes to the recipe on the can, since I am a diabetic. I always make 2 pies at once,  using half Splenda (3/4 cup) and half Splenda brown sugar mix (3/4 cup) for the total of the sugar ingredient. Mostly everyone that comes over for Thanksgiving are diabetics too...Also, I put the remaining pie mix into a buttered custard cup and bake along with the pies so that I get a reward sample before serving to everybody else!

Hmmm... I found this to be bland and not quite sweet enough. I am not someone who loves super sweet desserts, either. Maybe my spices were too old?

I have been making this recipe for a long time except I like to experiment. I add mini chocolate chips to my pie. I have for about 15 year's. Sometimes milk chocolate sometimes dark chocolate. My family won't eat plain pumpkin pie anymore lol.

This is the best pumpkin pie recipe,  my mother and grandmother both made this recipe and it always a big hit for all the family get togethers!  * Two exceptions to this recipe I make though is I cut the evaporated milk by half and double the cinnamon to make a more firm pie filling.

This recipe is amazing! I never used to like eating pumpkin pie, but this recipe was too good to pass up. I did use sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated, and it made it sweeter and delicious!

Turned out well with good flavor. I added pumpkin spice. Family loved it. Definitely place in fridge for several hours if not overnight. My first attempt but I’ll make it for Thanksgiving.

This makes a great pie, very traditional. We like ours a bit spicier so we double the spices and it's even better.

A wonderful pie as I remembered.  I always add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon as we love it.  I also bake my own pie pumpkin which my husband says takes it to the next level.  Will make again and again.

Wonderful recipe! First time I have made a pumpkin pie. The only thing different I did was added pumpkin pie spice and vanilla flavoring and followed some of the other suggestions of reducing the amount of milk. The recipe turned out great! I had to make 2 pies within a week due to family demand, so will definitely make this again! Thank you for this recipe!

I HAVE BEEN USING THE LIBBY RECIPE FOR YEARS.  HOWEVER I LOST MY COPY FROM THE TIME AND ENDED UP HUNTING THE NET.  I WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN I FOUND THIS ON YOUR SITE.  ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION IS THAT IF YOU LIVE IN CANADA, BECAUSE SOME FOOL DECIDED WE SHOULD GO METRIC, THE SMALL CANS OF PUMPKIN ARE NOT REALLY 15 OUNCES, THEY ARE ONLY 13 OUNCES WHEN MEASURED.  SO YOU WILL NEED TO ADD ANOTHER 2 OUNCES OF PUMPKIN IN ORDER TO GET THE SAME PIE.  

I HOPE THIS WAS OF SOME HELP TO THOSE OF US WHO CANNOT GET REAL LIBBY'S PUMPKIN ANYMORE.  BEST PUMPKIN PIE EVER I PERSONALLY THINK

This is the recipe I grew up with. My mother made it every year for Christmas. We never used canned pumpkin, though, always fresh butternut or gooseneck squash, baked and cooled ahead of time. Put everything in the blender, though light on the spices, and it always made the perfect pies

Instead of 3/4 cup of white sugar I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar. Also cooked my pie crust for 10mins at 350 degrees before adding pumpkin filling. I always cover my pie edges with foil and remove it 10-15 minutes before pie is is timed to be ready.

This was the best pumpkin pie  that I have made in years. I made it on a whim because I had an extra crust left over from thanksgiving. Turned out great and I was pleased.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out great! I used organic pumpkin and spices and it made it pop with flavor! I will definitely make it again. Be sure to wrap the outside crimped crust with foil so it doesn't burn. I forgot and it got a bit too done but it didn't burn. Overall, this was an excellent recipe.

This was the first pumpkin pie I ever made and I'm still using this recipe.  I've only made one change and that is to add a tablespoon of molasses to the mixture.  I did this first just to deepen the color when one can of pumpkin was unusually light in color.  It tasted so good I've done it ever since!

I made this last year for the 1st time exactly as written and it came out great. Made it again this past Thanksgiving and accidentally bought graham cracker crust, but it still came out just as delicious, if not more. I also forgot the cool whip but it was not necessary. I will stick with this recipe forever!

I confess; this was the worst experience I have ever had because I did not properly read the directions and ended up with twice as much pumpkin pie filling as I should have had but I also added brown sugar and added something else but can't remember what it was.   I made the crust from scratch and when I loaded the filling it was still kind of runny and overflowed the crust.  This should have been awful but it TASTED, tasted, great.  Family of 18 were in hysterics as I told them my step by step disaster and shocked they loved to flavor.

I used others’ tips when I made this and it turned out great.  I used Ruth’s Grandma’s pie crust recipe (with butter flavored Crisco).  To better blend the flavors, I warmed pumpkin, spices & 2 tablespoons of rum in sauce pan and let it cool before mixing in evaporated milk and egg.  It was delicious warm from the oven!  I’ll be making this every Thanksgiving.

Delicious! Everyone loved this pie. I just made it for Thanksgiving. I made some minor changes because we like our pumpkin pie a little bit more spicier.  I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 tsp of ginger and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I didn't have any ground cloves. Also,  the last time I made this pie, my son remarked that it was a bit wet. So I just used 10 oz. of Evaporated milk. I covered the pie's edges after the first 15 minutes. It was ready in about 45 minutes.

I used only 8oz of evaporated milk. Also, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar. It came out amazing. First time ever making pumpkin pie and it was fantastic. Just the right amount of spice and pumpkin taste. Pie wasn’t too dense either. Just perfect. Definitely going to continue to use this recipe. I also cooked the pumpkin on the stove on low heat with all the spices mixed in to make sure it didn’t taste too canned.

Made the crust but instead of 2 pies I made one large pie with 3/4 of the filling, and baked it for an hour.  Make sure to insert a knife into the center to check if it's ready (comes out clean)

I have used this recipe for a very long time! I've made a few changes though. I've replaced the ginger with nutmeg and the cloves with allspice then sprinkled allspice on the top before baking to give it some color.

This recipe is so consistently good. I did change it up a bit because of several reviews. 12 oz of condensed milk equals
 1 1/2 cups. One reviewer suggested using approx 1 cup instead because it was a slightly thicker consistency and a nice texture. It made an excellent pie, still plenty to fill a 9 inch pie plate. It doubled to fill 2 9in plates and 2 ramekins of just pumpkin mix. Another suggested to cut down a bit on spices to let the taste of the pumpkin come through. That worked out well also.

I have made this pie two times:  once with this recipe; second time using sweeten condensed milk instead of the evaporated milk and did not add the sugar.
Both pies were very close, but people who compared adults preferred the sweeten condensed milk version.  Kids liked the pie with the added sugar a little better.

have been making this pumpkin pie since I was a little girl helping my grandmother in the kitchen. I always beef up the spices a little more than called for and depending on the size of the pie plate, will use 4-6 eggs

Lovely pie. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, but that change is certainly NOT necessary.

Easy, cheap, and quick. I used a graham cracker crust and it wasn’t a good match. I’d recommend a frozen pie crust or homemade one

So yummy, I added some of my own touches and I also made mine in a free standing pie shell that I blind baked for   15 before I added the filling. Also added pumpkin flavored seasoning to my Whipped topping.  Did will be making again!

I followed the crustless version but decreased the sugar to one half cup, used one tablespoon of regular flour and baked in my convection oven for about 48 minutes. It was a nice golden brown and came out of the dish nicely. When cooled I sprinkled with a little cinnamon sugar around a solid pumpkin shaped cookie cutter impression in the center of the pie. My mom always used this recipe so we’re in the 50+ year tradition too!

This was exactly the Recipe I was looking for! I wanted my Mum's Recipe & after looking through her old books, I remembered that it was on the inside of a Libby's Pumpkin Tin...didn't think Libby's was still around!  The Pie was a delicious trip down Memory Lane!

Yeah guys, this recipe is foolproof. I have NEVER baked a pie before, period, and this pie came out so tasty that I am trying hard to resist eating the entire thing myself (currently on my third slice). So delicious and moist. Required a bit more time in the oven than the recipe called for (it took about an hour and 10 for it to fully cook) so, just allow some wiggle room time wise just in case. Will definitely be making for Thanksgiving this year!

A good basic recipe, it has been on the back side of the can label for years. It works well with either honey or real maple syrup in place of the white sugar also.

I loved the flavor and in the end it turned out pretty good.  However, all the filling didn't fit in the one pie pan and after cooking the correct amount it still seemed pretty runny... I was so confused when I read all the reviews where it turned out perfect for everyone else.  Then a few days later I realized I used my 29oz can of pumpkin instead of the 15oz can called for. LOL  Other than that, I followed the cooking instructions exactly and didn't add any more/less of the pie filling, milk, or eggs.  I ended up baking it at least 30 min. more than stated before I gave up and took it out.  It did set up eventually.  Surprisingly, we ended up really liking it! LOL But next time I'll remember to use the SMALL can of pumpkin. ;)

This was such a yummy pie and not too hard to make. It’s even better after a day or two in the fridge and with some homemade whipped cream. I just used whatever pumpkin purée I could find though, no need to use that specific brand, I always find it a little silly when people put brands in the recipe.

QUICK! And as someone who's never had pumpkin pie before and has only has sweet potato pie before this is much better than I expected. Instead of 12 oz Carnation evaporated milk I used 8 oz Pet Milk evaporated milk. - The other 4 oz went into bbq meatballs - Great and festive. Sweet potato pie is still my favorite though but more laborious. I prefer this pumpkin pie with "cane sugar"

Perfectly custardy - not too thick but not too thin! Sweetness was also perfect but if you want it to be more of a dessert pie I'd recommend adding 1 cup of sugar instead of just 3/4ths.

This is going into my favorites.

I usually make the pumpkin pie from scratch, but this year since we were hosting our French cousins, I bought the canned pumpkin. This recipe was superb. Will definitely use this again in the future.

This is my go-to pumpkin pie recipe. Instead of using canned pumpkin I did use fresh, substituting one pie pumpkin per can of pumpkin. It's delicious and I've already made it twice this year.

My son made this for our Thanksgiving dinner.  He put it in a walnut gingersnap crust and, instead of using powdered ginger, finely chopped crystallized ginger and used that.  It was terrific.

I made this pie this evening and it was easy to make. The recipe states it makes a 9inch pie so I doubled the recipe because one of my friends wanted one too thinking it would make two 9inch pies and I ended up with two 9inch pies and two 4inch pies.

Best pumpkin pie ever! Much better than store bought. Also, I didn’t have any cloves so I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and added another 1/4 tsp cinnamon.

My 9 yr old daughter made this for Thanksgiving tomorrow. I’ve used this recipe in the past and it’s her favorite. Followed the recipe exactly and it looks beautiful!

My first time making pumpkin pie and I decided to use this recipe. It turned out absolutely amazing. I did follow some of the other users' advice and only used 8 oz of the evaporated milk. I also added a heaping tablespoon of flour to the filling to help thicken it up. Texture was perfect, nice and firm, not too watery. I also added some nutmeg for another layer of flavor. MMM! So good with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Will be using this recipe again and again. Also cover your pie with foil for the first 15-20 minutes to avoid a burnt crust.

The flavor was great but the filling seemed too watery.

Maybe less condensed milk or longer bake time.

I have had this pie for Thanksgiving for years. My mother always 
made it. Now I make it,it is the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. The only thing I do different is I use  1/2 cup sugar and whole milk.  I also heat the milk to hot and stir it in a little at a  
time. It makes a very creamy pie.  CFC
PS My mother would only use Libby pumpkin. That is what i use because it is the best.

Very good; my hubby and I finished it in half a day!  Instead of cloves, I added nutmeg and extra cinnamon. I also took another reviewer’s advice and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar. Super good recipe!

There’s a reason why this is a classic and it’s simply the best recipe for pumpkin pie. It always turns out perfect. Like another suggested, I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar. It really makes the pie extra tasty and I got several compliments on it. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices and that was just fine. I will never use a different recipe.

I don't know what I am doing wrong, but the consistency is not turning out right! I followed the suggestions and used 8oz of condensed milk and added a little more spice and the pie still is too fluffy! It looks and smells amazing but I can seem to get it right

I find myself not using the entire can of evaporated milk. This recipe used to be for a slightly larger can of pumpkin 15.5 or 16 oz.  But since the can size has reduced to 14.5 oz you have to adjust the milk accordingly. Otherwise this is my go to version.

This was my first time making pumpkin pie.  I'd like to have homemade pumpkin pie each Thanksgiving and avoid the lines at Bakers Square so I'm practicing early in the year.  That being said, this recipe needs some improvement to be as good as the Pumpkin Cream option at Bakers Square.  My family loved it but maybe I'm being picky.  I'll definitely try this recipe again.

Love this classic recipe.

Only things I did differently, was to bake at the 425 temp for 20 minutes, instead of 15. This seems to make a difference living at a higher altitude.

Also, I added 2 T of spiced rum to the filling. 

Husband said it makes the perfect pumpkin pie, and he is not normally a fan of pumpkin.

I used an extra large graham cracker crust, only 8 oz of milk and added a pinch of nutmeg. I mixed the pumpkin and sugar (1/4c white, 1/2c brown) with a stick blender then heated it on the stove for 5 minutes once it started to bubble. Baked as directed and it finished in 40 minutes at lower temp. Delicious and will make again.

It was really super easy and very yummy. I accidentally used Carnation sweetened condensed milk instead of Carnation evaporated milk. I don't know how much of a difference it makes, but I would definitely make it again.

Very good and easy!  Followed recipe exactly.  Just covered the crust edge with foil for the first 30 minutes of baking to help keep it from burning.  Even with a deep dish crust, I had an extra 1/2 cup filling.  Baked that in a sprayed mini loaf pan for a shorter time  (until a knife inserted came out clean).  Yummy and nothing was wasted!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm 47 and have been making this for years.  My grandma (now 91) showed me how to avoid a soggy crust.  Before adding the evaporated milk, heat it up in the microwave or on the stovetop.

This turned out pretty awesome, for my first pumpkin pie ever! I used my own recipe to make a gluten free pie crust, but the filling was fabulous.

i do love the original Libby's pumpkin Pie recipe. nothing else seems to have the perfect combination of cinnamon, clove and ginger. Taste buds are definitely in over drive every time we make this.

This wasn't terrible but I think pumpkin spice would have tasted better.  I thought the clove was overpowering.

No changes! And for the love of God, do not substitute "pumpkin pie spice" for the spices listed in this recipe. This is really the best tasting pumpkin pie ever. Set your time for the minimum amount of time and check for doneness regularly. Don't worry, you can hide the test holes with the mounds of spray whip cream that go perfectly with this pie.

I had a couple cans of Trader Joe's organic pumpkin puree in my cupboard, so looked up this tried-and-true Libby's recipe because the recipe on the can didn't look "right" to me. Also, the TJ's pumpkin is rather like when raw pumpkin is cooked down, a little on the watery side with some fiber strands. Anyway, I've made a pie two separate times since they turn out nicely, though not quite as firm as I remember Libby's being. I trust the recipe now for when we have fresh pumpkin.

The pie shells need to be deep-dish and/or 9", or there will be left over filling. I had a small ramekin that I filled up and baked along side the pie for the same amount of time. (Hubby piled coffee ice cream on top and scarfed it down in the middle of the night!  He needs those calories, I don't!)

Perfect balance of spices/flavor and consistency!

Personally, even though I used a deep dish crust I ended up with a bit too much filling for one crust. I made 3 batches which made 4 pies. 

I see some people had problems with not setting in the middle, major boiling over, or thinking it's too watery. If you don't fill your crust to the point it spills when you move it, keep it about a quarter inch from the top, I find the pies cook great and thorough, although I usually end up cooking for 15 min at 425 and the close to an hour at 350, a bit longer than the recommended time. The filling will be pretty thin to start. 

If you still have problems with your pie setting in the middle try making sure you're crust is thawed and not frozen when you fill it. 

This is by FAR my favorite recipe for pumpkin pie! I always brush the crust edge with beaten egg before cooking to get it nice and golden and we top with Cool Whip in our house! :)

It was a very good pie, it wasn't great only because I was craving a little more flavor or pop, perhaps adding a bit more spice or flavoring the whipped cream. Overall, this was a very good pie and I think I will continue to use this as my base recipe and make small modifications.

I made this with 8 oz. of evaporated milk and I am glad I didnt used the full 12 oz.  The pie pulled away from the crust so I think I cooked it too long.  Overall, great flavor.  I just don't like the "mushyness/babyfood-like consistency" of pumpkin pie.  That is probably with every pumpkin pie recipe, not just this one!

As most pies are way too sweet to me, i reduced to 1/3 cup sugar, 6 Oz evaporated milk. Make the crust by following "Peach Pie with Sour Cream" from gen500. Came out great, loved it, will make again. 
Pie crust : 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup butter, cut into chunks, 1/2 tsp salt, 2Tbsp sour cream, put all in  in a food processor; pulse until mixture comes together in a large ball. Press dough into prepared pie dish to form a crust. 350F bake for 10 mins. Add filling, 350F bake 50 to 60 mins.

I loved this recipe. I made the crust myself and par baked it so that it wouldn't be soggy. I made a few changes to the filling. I omitted the evaporated milk and sugar and replaced them with a 14 ounce can of sweetened condensed milk from Trader Joe's. it turned out amazingly! I cut it shortly after I took it out the

This pumpkin pie was easy to make and was a hit for my family. However, as I was pouring the pumpkin mix into the pie crust, I noticed all the spices clumped together at the bottom of the bowl. A tip for anyone making this for the first time: After adding the evaporated milk and mixing, use a large spoon or utensil and scrape the bottom of the bowl. Other than that mishap, this pie was great and I would enjoy making it again in the future

My first time making pumkin pies and everyone liked them. The only changes I made was reducing the sugar to 1/2c  and for spices I just used 2 tsp pumkin pie spice. My filling cracked about 10 minutes before I could get them out of the oven. Still tastes great but ruins the aesthetics. I hid the cracks by serving with a dollop of whipped cream.

I made this recipe with my daughter and it came out good with Libby's pumpkin or store brand pumpkin Our family loved it add some cool whip or ice cream for a special treat. Also had extra pumpkin mixture made pumpkin pancakes with that.

This is a wonderful pumpkin pie! I made my own gluten free short crust pastry from another recipe, but the filling on this one is excellent. I actually did a taste test between a pumpkin pie made with sweetened condensed milk and one made with evaporated milk and this one won in my books.  The filling is more like custard than a pie made with SWM, so, I will be using this recipe from now on, yum!

This pumpkin pie is delicious and easy to make. When I asked my brother what he wanted for his birthday, he immediately stated that he wanted "that really good pumpkin pie".  Two thumbs up.

My mom has made this pie for ever and now it's time for me to start. I made it once before thanksgiving just to be safe and then for thanksgiving I made it in individual tarts. Very very good both ways. This recipe just brings back great memories from the taste. Excellent !!!

I use this recipe every Thanksgiving.  However, I use real pumpkin that has been steamed down into mush & drained.  I add 1/4 cup more sugar (because real pumpkin is not sweet).  I like to use deep dish pie pans because the real pumpkin takes longer to cook.  Cook until a butter knife comes out clean from center & top is just staring to get a golden brown.  I make homemade crusts as well.  Been using this recipe for over 20 years and usually I make 4 pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving.  Not one is ever left over!  LOL

I used 1 29oz can of pumpkin,  1 12oz can evaporated milk, used 2 1/4 tsp Pumpkin Pie spice in place of the individual spices, and doubled everything else. Perforated the bottom of TWO unbaked pie crusts, filled them, covered the edges with foil, and placed them on a cookie sheet. Baked at 425 for 20 mins and at 350 for another 40-50 mins. Cooled on a rack for 2hrs. Perfect!

Classic pumpkin pie. So good! I turned the temperature down to 350 a little early and put tin foil around the crust part way through to avoid burning.

This pie was pretty good.  It really tasted like it was missing an ingredient to me though.  But it was still a good pie and I would probably make it again if I can figure out what ingredient is missing!

This is my favorite pumpkin filling recipe. I did make two changes, though. I used some brown sugar with the white sugar, about a 50-50 mix, and instead of evaporated milk I used 1 1/2 cups of half and half. Everyone raves about it!

The filling is amazingly creamy but make sure to cook until it does not jiggle. 
Tip: Cook pie crust before adding the filling

I make this wonderful pie every year at Thanksgiving, and it's a big hit with everyone. I do cut back on the spices (cinnamon, ginger, cloves) by half. Sometimes I leave the cloves out entirely. Wonderful pie!

Used fresh pumpkin puree (baked in oven first then blended).
Used half a can of condensed milk ipv evaporated.
Used pie shell from bumleberry pie, baked blind on 350 degrees for 15 mins, then continued pie at 350 for following hour. Even when inserted pin came out sticky but once left to cool set perfectly.
Perfect crust, lovely pie. Will try less sugar next time.

This makes an amazing pumpkin pie! It's delicious. I added a dash of nutmeg to the spices. Don't skip the individual spices! It's worth it in the end.

I, too, have used this recipe for years as it was recommended to me when I was first married....over 50 years ago by my mother. The only thing I sometimes do differently is to pour the custard into custard dishes & bake.......no crust!  We love pumpkin & it is a treat to have it this way, too. A nice dessert for any meal!  I put the dishes into a baking pan & pour water around the custard cups to bake. Then set timer to 30-45" & watch closely. Baking depends on size of custard cups. When knife comes out clean, it is done.

I made this last week and it was a success. I don't know if it was beginners luck as I have never made pumpkin pie from scratch before. ( we baked our own pumpkin, no canned stuff, and I even made my own evaporated milk) it was delicious! i did however use a part brown sugar. I am making this again this weekend!!

I have made this recipe for over 40 years now, and it is the absolute best.  It has spoiled me for any and all other pumpkin pies.  In fact, my husband brought home a store bought pumpkin pie the other night and we were so disappointed, I'm making this one today (hey, we need something to use up all that whipped cream we had left over!)  The only thing I do differently is to use pumpkin pie spice - since the recipe calls for a total of 1 3/4 tsp of spices combined, that's how much pumpkin pie spice I use, adding more to taste if necessary.  GREAT recipe and timeless!

This recipe was so easy, and the pie was delicious!! I used the store-bought pie crust that you unroll and place in the pan. I sprayed non-stick spray on the pan before setting the crust in it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I'll be making this again soon!

It was such an authentic pumpkin pie. Always gonna make this again! To get out the canned flavor from the pumpkin I decided to cook it first on heat with the cinnamon and everything - it really helps. Pumpkin Pie. Is there anything they can't do?

My grandmother made the best pumpkin pie, but no one ever asked her the recipe, we just ate it.  One day one of my cousins asked her what her recipe was and her secret was that she used the Libby's pie recipe for canned pumpkin (not pie filling), but added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of ginger to it.  I've taken the recipe one step further and substituted brown sugar for half of the white sugar.  The pie gets these nice brown spots on the top when you bake it from the coarse bits of brown sugar and the flavor is incredible.

I used Ruth's Grandma's Pie crust: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/15995/ruths-grandmas-pie-crust/?event8=1&prop24=SR_Thumb&e11=pie%20crust&e8=Quick%20Search&event10=1&e7=Recipe&soid=sr_results_p1i1

Hubby's the baker normally, but I decided I wanted to make pumpkin pie (he makes apple pie for our thanksgiving). This was my first attempt and it was so good I looked like a pro! I read lots of the reviews and went with the recipe as is except adding 1/2 tsp of allspice to the ingredients. I used an electric handheld mixer which gave a smooth result. It is very "runny" after you mix all the ingredients but it comes out perfectly if you follow the baking instructions.  I doubled the recipe and made one deep pie and one regular. To avoid the mess I used a soup ladle to add the mixture to my crust and filled almost to the top. The deep dish one took 60 minutes to cook, the other 50 minutes. A comment about the deep dish pie recommendation in the recipe. Deep dish pie plates are deeper (and some are larger) than deep dish pie crusts that you buy in the frozen section. I used a crust I rolled out myself and put in my deep dish pie plate. If I'd used the type in the aluminum foil from the frozen section I would have had too much filling for two of those.

I make this pie every year, and the only difference I make is using fresh garden grown pumpkin instead of the canned.  We love it!

we use this but take the eggs and separate them and beat the whites till stiff peaks form and then fold them in and then bake the same as before...it will make three pies instead of two and makes them more of a chiffon pump pie...more lighter and fluffier...

It's great, but be sure to follow the recipe. I didn't have ginger, so I used store-bought pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Not a good idea. It turned out great, but it would've been so much better if I had just used the actual spices.

This recipe is not the original Libby recipe that I use... That one used 3 eggs and 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.   It also had a tsp of vanilla.  Start baking at 425 degrees for 10 minutes and 40 minutes at 350, I think that helps keep the crust flakier.  This version has more depth of flavor, but overall, we love a simple straightforward pumpkin pie recipe and this one fits the bill.

I like a spicier pie so I added 3/4 tbsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg with 1 full tsp of ginger. I use fresh pumpkin as it tastes better. Substituted brown sugar for white, will make again.

Super easy to make and super tasty. I ended up having to cook mine a lot longer than instructed though. Just make sure you watch that the middle is done all the way through before taking it out of the oven.

Added a little nutmeg and less ginger.  Used gingersnaps to make a crust for one pie and regular homemade pie crust with butter shortening for the other.  Both pies were great!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year using a Marie Callendar's frozen (thawed) pie crust and it was simply marvelous. I didn't change a thing and won't in the future. I did cook it just a tad bit longer. Wonderful pie, thank you.

Absolutely perfect pumpkin pie! I made this the day before Thanksgiving, I used a homemade crust, and it makes all the difference in the world. Don't change a thing on this recipe, it is a great one as is! Yummy pie for Thanksgiving, with a bit of cool whip on top.

This is the quintessential pumpkin pie recipe.  It is easy to make and nearly fail proof.  It's so easy that I would trust my guy to make this and he is not a baker at all.  I only gave it 4 stars as a changed a few things.  I only used 1 cup of evaporated milk which made for a more substantial filling that did not melt as it set out.  I will likely increase it 1 1/4 cups, the next time.  The full 15 oz can of evaporated milk is a bit much.  I also decreased the spices by nearly half as I wanted the pumpkin to shine through.  In all, it was a nice pie and one that is easily modified.

I this this recipe - it's easy, classic and right on the back of the can! The one change I made this Thanksgiving was this - instead of using evaporated milk, I melted the same amount of vanilla ice cream and used that instead. Made it nice a creamy and just a little fluffier

Perfect recipe!  This was so easy and came out wonderfully.  I did add a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg for some extra spice, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Only problem I had was using a regular 9in pie crust, I had a ton of filling left over that I just had to throw out.  Next time I'll try to track down either a 9in deep dish crust or use the 10in.

I made the pie following directions. Delicious! I used a store bought Graham cracker crust. I had some left over pumpkin mix so i made crust and put it in a cupcake tind . It made six. They were Great. I plan to make them again. The pie crust i made was from All Recipes.com . Instead of shortining i made it with butter

EASY, CLASSIC and PERFECT!! The only changes I made were using 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of individual spices, used homemade pumpkin puree which was not as thick as canned so I decreased evap. milk to 9 oz.

I honestly don't understand why so many people give this recipe 5 stars.  I have made pumpkin pie for years and decided to try this one given the amount of stars it got but was very disappointed with it and it was mainly because of the evaporated milk.  It made it soooo watery that the pie itself ended up mushy.  I personally don't like a mushy pie to the point it almost melts in your mouth when you're eating it, so if that's the consistency you like, go for it.  But even after I had it in the fridge overnight the pie was just pure mush as soon as you try to cut a slice.  Hated it.  Flavor wise, it's pretty good so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars.  But then again, as long as you use cinnamon, ginger and cloves, you're safe as far as flavor goes.

this recipe is the "one"! i tried a variation last year but Libby's recipe cannot be improved upon. It may have to cook a bit longer than stated but i think that varies due to oven and weather differences.

This recipe was very good... I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving.  I always take pictures but this time my pic just didn't look good, so I didn't post :( Yummy pies though!

So glad to find this recipe on here!  It's the same one that is on the back of the Libby's can, but we recently started to buy organic canned pumpkin, and didn't have the Libby's can to refer to this year!  This is the only recipe I use - I tried one other one once and it didn't turn out as creamy or dense as this one.  Highly recommended!

So good! Light yet full of flavor. Can't get much better! I made two and used fat free evaporated milk for one of them... couldn't tell the difference.

I made this today, the day before Thanksgiving because it was my first time.  I added about 2 tbs of flour and about 1.5 tsp of molasses, and a bit of nutmeg.  My kids loved it, especially my three year old.

Note:  It did take longer to cook/set.

i made two pies..  when i came down in the morning, i found that my husband ate the ENTIRE inside of one of the pies and left only the (store bought) crust.  at least he put the crust back in the fridge.. :)  needless to say, it was a great pie filling..

This pie was good.  Didn't taste much different to me then any other pumpkin pie.  I will say this. My 3 yr old made it. I helped by measuring things and helped stir every now and then. But he did it, and I enjoyed the quality time we had making this pie.

This is the best.  I lighten it up with fat-free evaporated milk and about 1/2 cup sugar.  i also use fresh pumpkin instead of canned.  A winner every time.

This recipe is fantastic...and so easy. I decided to try it before Thanksgiving to see if I'd want to serve it to my guests, and I definitely will.  This is easy and foolproof.  I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks to Libby's.

Easy, fun to make, the BEST!!! I have been making this recipe, just as is, for many years now. I have made other recipes for fun, on occasion, but this one truly is the best pumpkin pie recipe. I have made it with evaporated skim milk & egg beaters & it is still yummy. Haven't tried it with Splenda yet- maybe someday...
