This was really good.  Fairly simple to prepare.  I had to look at another site to figure out how to roast the poblanos though, as I'd never done it before.  All I did was wash the peppers and put them in the toaster oven on the highest setting.  The website said to leave them in until the skin starts to have black bubbles on it, then turn the pepper and roast until there are black bubbles on that side.  I got nervous and took them out a little too early,  I think, so the skin didn't come off quite as easily as I'd hoped.  The flavor of the dish is amazing--just the right amount of caliente.  I think next time I'll put the tomatoes in the pan at the end to cook them a little rather than put them on cold as garnish right before serving.

Simple recipe and delicious; plus you can tweek it and use a light cream cheese if you eat a bit healthier and it still tastes great. I didn't even roast the chiles either, just cut em up and tossed em in. I served it on a bed of rice, makes for a good dinner. The tomatoes on top is a must, finishes it off great.

This was good! I used a bit more cooking creme then it calls for but I also had added extra chicken.  I served it over mashed potatoes & it was good! Defiantly will make it again!

This was delicious!  Next time I think I will do chicken breast only instead of a whole chicken cut up.  I made a slight change bc I could not find the cooking creme.  I used an 8 oz container of whipped cream cheese and I added another Tbsp of milk.  Turned out perfect!  I served the chicken on a bed of lightly seasoned rice.  I might shred the chicken next time also.  Reheating was easy and it still tasted great!  I reheated in the oven covered at 350 for about 18 - 20 min.  I would recommend this to a friend, already have actually!!
