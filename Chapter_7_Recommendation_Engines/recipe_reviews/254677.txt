I liked this glaze a lot but to me it tasted a little too sweet and like powdered sugar. I would still use it again tho!

I loved this!  And my husband couldn't keep away!  It has the moderate sweetness and feel of a mix of banana bread and cake.  It used up some of my old yogurt and bananas, and was easy to make without a stand mixer!  I made the icing with regular milk and sprinkled coconut and sliced almonds on top of the glaze - it was beautiful!  Thank you for the recipe, I will make this again!

Good way to use up old Greek yogurt. My hubby liked this more than my usual carrot cake.  But the allspice made this flavor a bit older so the kids weren’t fans.  I’ll keep this recipe as an ole standby for expiring Greek yogurt, but i won’t exactly run out to get ingredients just to be able to make this again.
