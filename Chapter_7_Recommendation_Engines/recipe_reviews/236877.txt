I am giving this a 3 star but it could easily be a 4. Avocado even with lemon or lime juice will brown - to me this is NOT a make ahead dip unless the avocado to totally covered in sour cream etc.... to block the air from oxidizing the avocado. Canned beans already have plenty of salt as does the taco sauce. I don't think this needed 2 cups of cheese - I used about 1/4 cup of grated cheese and it was more than enough. As written there are just too many 'little' things that are not quite right. Layered dips are very easy - I don't suggest holding Avocado overnight unless you absolutely must.
