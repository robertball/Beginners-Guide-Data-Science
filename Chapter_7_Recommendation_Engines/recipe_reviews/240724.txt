I LOVE these! They taste like real pancakes and yet have only 3 tablespoons of flour and no sugar. They are easy and quick to make, and I like them with just a bit of butter for topping. This is a great creative healthy recipe. I will say that the serving size is ridiculously small--I eat one whole recipe, which makes 6 small dollar size pancakes--myself. I also use a whole small banana instead of half, so I won't have half a banana sitting around left over. You can cook these with just cooking spray in the pan, which should lower the fat content

These are a decent gluten-free pancake. I used coconut flour in place of the all-purpose. 
These definitely have a strong banana taste, so don't expect them to be like traditional pancakes. 
They cooked well and the kids thought they were okay.
If you want them to be nice and fluffy be sure to whip your eggs really well before you  add any other ingredients.

I made these this morning - first time making this recipe and I find that the pancakes are very dense. Maybe I did something wrong but I followed the recipe exactly. I was hoping that the pancakes would be fluffier but they were falling apart on the grill. Any recommendations? I want to love these but it just didn't work out well for me!

these were pretty good..i cut this down to 2 servings and it made two smallish pancakes.. i think i would have liked it a little better if it called for mashed banana instead of chunks but i think that's just personal preference.. i completely forgot to add the honey but did add honey and maple syrup on the finished product.. threw in some chunks of dark chocolate but think milk chocolate chips would have been better.. also added some pb2 powdered peanut butter that was chocolate flavored but i didn't really taste it in the pancakes.. maybe 1.5 tsp was too little.. either way this is what i was looking for.. ty for the recipe

When I made it, they took SO long to cook, and were still doughy.

Made a double batch. Used egg whites instead of whole eggs. Delicious results! Will try adding pumpkin pie spice next time.

The taste was very good -lots of banana flavor- but the texture was kinda off. Some of the pancakes looked like pancakes and others -well they just looked like a glob. It might be partially my fault due to my lack in flipping skills and the fact that I substituted wheat germ for flour, but still, they were a little thin for my taste too. I will definitely use this recipe again, I'll just make a few adjustments.

I actually rate these 3.5 stars, but I rounded up instead of down because I don't want to kill this recipe with a low rating. I used a gluten free flour and I forgot to add xanthum gum, so mine were quick to fall apart. I found that keeping them small and cooking them on low heat was the secret to getting them to cook right. The batter was a bit thicker than I prefer. Taste wise, they were pretty good, but not fab. I tried these because I had some pumpkin that I needed to use up. But I like the Deliciously Healthy Paleo Pancakes With Banana and Walnuts recipe better than this one, which is a similar-type recipe. (As an aside, I thought paleo meant no grains? Even if you substitute some almond flour, I don't think you can call it paleo since its still got regular flour? Maybe I'm wrong?)
