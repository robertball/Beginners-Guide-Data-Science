I loved this because it was quick and easy. To my surprise my kids loved it too.I used fresh spinach not frozen. I added salt and pepper and a pinch of dried oregano. I also added a fresh diced tomatoe to spinach while i sauteed it. I served it with a squirt of lemon, that just topped it off. Yummy!

For a great meal throw in some diced plum tomatoes when sauteeing the spinach.  Then add cubed, marinated, grilled chicken breast and top it all off with feta cheese and some sliced black olives from the deli, not those canned things.  Good enough for my Italian brother-in-law. Mangia!

Easy to prepare but needed more seasoning.  Added some season salt and salt free garlic and seasoning mix.  My daughter added parmesan cheese to her plate.

This is a start to a quick and easy recipe. I had fresh spinach, so I used that instead of the frozen. I added some canned, diced tomatoes, and more olive oil than called for. I used shredded Parmesean rather than the powdered kind. While eating it, I thought it needed a texture... I opted for creamy and added a touch of sour cream, of all things. I actually really enjoyed it with the sour cream! I LOVE sour cream, though. May not work for everyone. Just a suggestion! As stated, I agree with the other reviewers that said it was lacking moisture and flavor.

Are you kidding?  This was incredibly bland and dry.  Like mixing a bunch of plain pasta with plain spinach, except with a hint of garlic.  It tasted good when I added a bunch of butter and salt, but then again, plain pasta tastes great with enough butter and salt.

Tasty!  I added cooked chicken breast cut up in bite size pieces and a can of undrained diced tomatoes to serve it as a meal.  The tomato juice added a little sauce that otherwise wasn't there.

Good basic recipe but I agree with others that this did lack a little flavor.  I served it with the Tomato Chcicken Parmesan (from this site) and was the perfect side dish for that. IF you want lots of flavor, I would recommend making Suki's Spinach and Feta pasta which kind of picks up where this recipe leaves off.

Pretty good, I added a squeeze of lemon and some pepper with parm cheese on top.  You could even add a bit of salt if you really wanted.  It's good by itself, however the only complaint I got was...."where's the meat?" Chicken would be best, cooked in white wine with garlic and rosemary.

I loved using this while doing Body for Life.  I added nonfat cottage cheese in addition to plum tomatoes and fresh spinach with whole wheat pasta - a healthier alternative to adding cheese

This is a great recipe but since my boyfriend doesn't love spinach - I cut the amount in half and added in artichoke hearts and some parmesean cheese...amazing!

A great base recipe -- I used angelhair, and added some butter, tsp of white wine, oregano and extra garlic, with a bit of salt when pan frying the spinach. Topped with a bit of parmesan and it's the perfect lunch!

Ok, for people who hate reviews on changed recipes.  Read no further.  For people who like to note changes, I loved this with the changes I made half based on other reviews and half based on my favorite garlic and oil pasta.  Use either 1/2 cup oil OR 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup butter (which I used).  Also I used 6 cloves of garlic.  Sautee garlic until light brown and add salt and pepper to taste and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes.  Also I didn't drain the spinach to capture the juices and make it less dry.  When I served it, I added a dollop of spaghetti sauce and grated parmesan cheese.  Garlic bread on the side.  A garlic lovers dream dish.

This recipe would not be very good if you followed it exactly. However, with modifications, it was very tasty.

I used fresh chopped spinach, 5 cloves of garlic, extra butter and olive oil, roasted pine nuts, and served it with some fresh grated parm.

For an entire pound of pasta you need more than just 1 tablespoon. I kind of lost track how much I used because I was using a stainless steel pan and didn't want it to stick.

This pasta was great.  I did make a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I used fresh spinach sauteed in peanut oil with minced garlic and quartered cherry tomatoes.  I also seasoned it with salt, pepper and let it simmer with some splashes of balsamic vinager.  After stirring in the cooked pasta I put some swiss cheese on top.  That part didn't work so well, so next time I will be using grated parmaesan instead.  I just didn't have any available tonight.

I used fresh spinach and fried everything in a mix of olive oil and a vinaigrette salad dressing. The vinaigrette added a great zing! I also fried the pasta long enough so it was a little crunchy. Will make again!

This was excellent! I used fresh spinach, organic coconut oil, and lemon olive oil (Wegman's),  sea salt, fresh ground pepper, and a grinding of nutmeg. After mixing in the pasta, I stirred in some italian seasoned diced tomatoes. I didn't have any parm, but I did have goat cheese crumbles, which worked perfectly......and topped it al off with a grinding of Olde Thompson Italian Seasoning. YUM!

This was SOOOOO easy! It's going to be a go-to side dish, or maybe even a main meal, if you toss in some shrimp or cut up chicken. I topped it with  Parmesean cheese.

This was not bad. I added a little bit of onion and a can of diced tomatoes in with the spinach and some left over chicken. Next time I'll add a little crushed chili pepper to spice it up.

I could only give this recipe 3 stars because I had to add my own touch to it. In addition to the ingrdients I use chopped tomatoes, salt, garlic powder and parmesan cheese(freshly grated of course)

I listened to the other comments for this recipe and added chopped chicken and parma. cheese.  I then doctored it up by cooking the noodles  and chicken in chicken broth and added a little sprinkle of salt and oregano.  I also threw in more garlic, and sprinkled some pepper over the top before serving. Everyone in my family really liked it. I plan on making it again!

I thought this was okay, it looked good on the plate, but it was pretty bland. I will make it again, except I'll use salt and more garlic, maybe the tomatoes will help.

I did use broccoli and chicken.  Using the dream fields angel hair pasta, made this a great dish for diabetics.

We really liked this recipe.  Quick, healthy and versatile.  I added  broccoli that I had steamed in my microwave until crisp tender. Then added it to the the garlic in the saucepan to cook further.  Added the spinach for a quick cook and then the spaghetti.  Fast and delicious.

This is a good start but I think it would have been very bland without the modifications I made.  I added 1 diced tomato, some salt, pepper, and basil.  With those additions it was amazing.

Added pancetta or small cubed baked ham with the garlic in the oil, salt and pepper, dash of nutmeg and a couple of pats of butter after adding the pasta to make the sauce a little richer.  If its too dry after adding the pasta use a splash of olive oil or pasta water, but don't get carried away.  You of course need plenty of grated Italian cheese on the pasta.

Tried leogrl's version and loved it. I added a little sea salt too. I had a taste and couldn't stop eating it. Also, I didn't have time to let the spinach thaw so I microwaved it for about 2 mins. Thawed perfectly and no water to drain or absorb. Last thing: I sliced the garlic rather than mincing it. Will prepare this one again and again!

Very bland. Everyone giving it good reviews is saying that they added stuff to it, which is what I had to do. My husband's response to it, even after I added extra olive oil, chicken, and sea salt, was, "It's edible". I had to agree.

Like many of the other reviewers, this recipe can be quite good with a lot of additional ingredients. I added garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, and a tablespoon of white wine to the fresh garlic. Plus a can of garlic and olive oil infused diced tomatoes. Overall, its a tasty way to eat spinach.

Great as a side dish... I used fresh spinach. The second time I added some fresh mushroom and tomato slices to make it a little heartier.

I gave it 3 stars because I had to doctor this recipe.  It is slightly bland as is.  I added grilled chicken and parm cheese.  Also I cooked the spinach longer than it said because I do not like crunchy spinach.  Next time I will add a seasoning to the pasta also.  Great recipe once things are added to your liking.  My one son loved this.  I will definitely make it again.

I agree with others that this is a bit dry.  I added some Parmesan cheese while the pasta was hot for an extra flavor boost.  Next time I will definitely add chicken for it to feel like more of a meal.

This is very good, however, I made some changes.  I added a little dot of butter to the olive oil for flavor, and topped each hot serving with parm cheese.  It was great!  You can also use broccoli if you haven't any spinach on hand.

Great start! I added more oil and garlic and mussels.
