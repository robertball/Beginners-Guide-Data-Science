i used a store bought graham cracker crust and it only took maybe 5 min to make it was so quick and easy! i used more like 1 1/2 c. peanut butter and when i put it in the crust tasted some out of the bowl and the cream cheese was so overwhelming still,  but i put it in the freezer anyway and when we ate it about 7hrs later it was perfect! i could just barely taste the cream cheese so i'm glad i didn't add any more peanut butter. but i would definitely recommend if you're using a graham crust to increase the PB. my DH thought it was one of the best desserts i've ever made!

YUM! Crust was too thick in a pie pan so I put it in a small rectangular baking dish (12x7.5) and it was perfect.  Tastes good the first day but is even better the second day...if it last that long.  I used fat free cool whip and it was fine.

I make this all the time.  If it's too rich with the nutter butter crust or if you don't have time, a pre-made pie crust works well too!

I made this pie for my family and they loved it.  It was very easy to make.  If you have kids and a husband that love Nutter Butter cookies then you will love this recipe.

this pie is AMAZING.  easy and scrumptious... i found this recipe online about 7 years ago, and i have made it dozens of times since. a family and church pie auction favorite! perfect just the way it is.  i like to top it with the remaining Nutter Butters.. makes it distinctive-looking!

Had good flavor, the cream cheese over powered the PB a bit. It was really hard to cut into and serve, don't know if I would freeze it next time. We only finished half of the pie, had to throw the rest out. I don't think I would make this again.

I've made this pie several times, definitely one of mine and my family's favorite.  If you don't want the extra expense of the Nutter Butter's you can use a graham cracker crust, and it is still good.

I have made this pie several times for my family and they absolutely love it.  I usually make it in a 9x13 pan and only put the crust on the bottom. Works great both ways.

After having a peanut butter pie for dessert on vacation, my husband was anxious for me to recreate it at home.  I tried 4 different recipes before I came across this one.  It is outstanding.  Only thing I add is the home made hot fudge on All Recipes that you make with condensed milk...I drizzle the hot fudge on each slice when serving.  Nothing like chocolate and peanut butter.  Yum.

I made two small changes--I cut the sugar back to 1/3 of a cup inside the filling and I drizzled melted chocolate over the top before sticking it in the freezer. To say that we liked it would be an understatement. Over half is gone in less than 24 hours!

Delicious! Almost tastes like a pb cheesecake. Next time I will start with 15 cookies and add as needed because the crust was too thick and I only used 20. I will definitely make this one again.

This pie was very good, but oh so rich! I used the graham cracker crust instead of cookies for cost reasons. Be sure to cut pieces small to avoid a major sugar rush. I think I may fiddle with the recipe to cut some of the sugar down for my family - but again, very good!

Try subbing 1/3 cup of sugar + 1 1/2 tsp vanilla + 1 cup of sour cream + a pinch of salt for the cool whip topping - it's tangy and delicious! Also, store-bought pie crusts work just fine but the nutter butter crust is WAY tastier, it's definitely worth it.

I added a thin layer of hot fudge topping over the crust, before adding the filling and also drizzled some over the Cool Whip before serving. Also, because a few folks in our group have to eat gluten-free, I made a different crust for them using GF animal cracker crumbs, peanut butter & butter. Yummy!!!

Sooo easy, yet so delicious!  I made it with a conventional pie crust, rather than a cookie crust; and I substituted Splenda for the sugar in this recipe.  Can be frozen or refrigerated.

I have made this recipe several times and I still love it. I keep thinking about adding chocolate in some way, but it is delicious the way it is. My five year old describes it as peanut butter cheesecake. :)

This is a family favorite. Yes, it is very rich, and  called “Nutter Butter “ for a reason. Substituting Graham cracker comprises the integrity . The crust is supposed to be thick. For an extra treat, I’ve put crumbled Reeses Peanut Butter Cups on the top. The frozen pie  has been part of my dessert repertoire for years .

I make this for my daughter every year for her birthday, which is the 4th of July, and who wants to be in the kitchen too long.  This recipe is perfect for summer and easy to do.
