I was out of ricotta so I tried this recipe and my family loved it! I used Barilla basil and tomato sauce in a jar and even threw in a cup of leftover spaghetti sauce. I used parmesan from a package- finely shredded. I have a "scratch" lasagna recipe that I have used for years that my family liked but never have I had so many raves. Going in my recipe box!

I am not a huge fan of ricotta so I tried this recipe out. The lasagna was very tasty and had tons of flavor! My boyfriend was skeptical about the sour cream but it was delicious. He ate almost half the entire dish! I followed the recipe to a T and the only suggestion I would make is boiling the pasta for a little while longer so that it is much softer and easier to cut with a fork when done. It does not quite taste like traditional lasagna, but it will definitely be making its way onto my dinner table again. Thanks!

this was great! i did change it up some, i left out the olives and i used half sour cream half riccotta, and i also used a bigger can of tomato sauce and increased the amount of spices in the sauce. i put a lot more mozzerella in it when i made it for my brother, but i like the amount in the original recipe. i'll be keeping this one!

This receipe is sooooooo good!! I do not care for ricotta cheese or cottage cheese so I have never found a lasagna that I liked until tonight. I did make a few changes to the receipe only due to the fact that I did not have all the indredients on hand. Instead of making the sauce I used a sausage onion spaghetti sauce that I had in the panty (it had chunks of tomato, onion, and sausage in it). I also used a 'hot' pork sausage. After the first bite my husband and i are hooked. I will be making this dish again and again!!! Thank you for sharing!!!

I have made this recipe several times and love it! I follow the recipe exactly except I omit the olives (although I would like them, my family wouldn't) and use fresh basil when I have it. This is the best lasagna recipe I have made, thank you!

Not only is this very tasty, it solved a huge problem for me ... my kids hate ricotta and I had pretty much given up serving lasagna at home.   While this does not have a completely tradititional feeling, it is very good, and it's an easy lasagna to make as well.   Like many of the other reviewers, the only change I make is to leave out the olives.

I found this when I promised my husband lasagna but then realized I had no ricotta!  I used my own homemade Italian sausage sauce and did not use olives. The only part I did use of this recipe was the cheese mixture...Wow! So I am rating this entire recipe 5 stars because that alone is worthy.  I have made this twice...once using regular extra wide noodles and once using no boil noodles.  They both turned out delish!

This was pretty good, but still didn't have that "something" that I've been looking for.  I found the sauce to be very bland, even after adding more spices to it.  I can say, though, that the sour cream was very good and both my hubby and I were quite pleased with that. I just need to find that really good spaghetti sauce recipe and this would be perfect.

I found this recipe in a panic because I did all my shopping and came home WITHOUT my ricotta or even some cottage cheese.  I used the "Ingredients" feature on AR and came across this delicious recipe.  I used my own sauce mix and subbed this sour cream mixture for the ricotta.  It was a hit--and even better the second day!

Very good! My husband does not like Ricotta Cheese, so this was perfect. I plan to omit the salt next time; it was not needed. I also used no-boil noodles and it came out perfectly.

Great! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used no-boil noodles and cut out the salt from the sour cream mixture. Sour cream is an excellent idea and the texture from the egg made it very ricotta-like (much more so than cottage cheese). I actually found this recipe while searching for a main dish with green olives and I loved the little bite they gave it. I'm bummed I couldn't get a good picture of this, but will try next time I make it. The guys loved it, so it looks like that will be soon. Thanks for the recipe!

It's a wonderful recipe, finished in only one seating ^_^ thanks so much for sharing... I never made Lasagna so I really wanted to try this out. I had to cut the ingredients to half coz I wasn't looking at the quantity I needed when buying the ingredients. 
Anyways, this recipe is very fitting for customization so don't fret so much. 
I also had to customize, I had no parsleys, I added italian seasoning instead (saw from another lasagna recipe). I also didn't have Pork Sausage, So I used Sweet pork longganisa (a philippine equivalent of chorizo). I added tomato paste too for a stronger flavor.

I made this lasagna with fire roasted diced tomatos, 1 medium spanish onion, 8 cloves of garlic and a dash of worcestershire sauce.  My  wife and I consumed the entire pan in 3 days.  A simple and fantastic recipe, thank you for sharing this with us.

I've been searching for the perfect lasagne recipe, and this is it! Not watery, sliced perfectly, and looked beautiful. My family loved it.Very easy to make. I didn't have sausage so I used all ground beef, and it tasted fine. I added a little more cheese on top to make a good, thick layer. Definitely keeping this one.

My whole family LOVED this recipe! Even my mother in law! I used no-cook noodles and an Italian cheese blend. I think that cheese with the 3/4 cup parmesan made it a little too salty, my own fault. Next time I will use regular mozzarella. Awesome recipe!

This was a very nice change from your basic lasagna.  I actually used chorizo sausage as I didn't have pork sausage on hand - so I added a little Sazon (seasoning) to the meat, as well as a few more latin seasonings.  I used more meat (as I like it meatier.  I'm also going to play around with this and add a little chipotle w/adobo sauce to the sour cream mix for a little smoke/heat next time.  Thanks so much for the recipe !  [Don't omit the olives - it adds so much flavor with the beef]

This was the first time I ever made lasagna. I tried this one because of the reviews and so glad I did it was great and easy..I was very successful in making this lasagna. Everyone raved about it and the pan was empty at the end of the event. Will make again. I'm so glad I doubled the recipe for a large size lasagna...next time I'll make two. I left out the salt and olives.

This was great!! I was craving lasagna and didn't have ricotta cheese or cottage cheese so I decided to give this a try. I normally use the "Worlds Greatest lasagna" (I think that is the title) recipe that is on this site and it turns out great. My husband didn't realize I made a different lasagna and he said he thought this was my best yet. I told him it was because it wasn't the same recipe.
A couple of things I did different which was just because of what I had on hand was.... used ground turkey (full pound) rather than ground beef. I used hot Italian sausage instead of pork sausage. I also used extra spaghetti sauce and swiss cheese. I added more seasoning because the sauce I had on hand was really bland. I added fennel too. Left out olives.
Overall I don't think any of these changes really made a big difference. I think the recipe would be great if followed exactly. I will definitely make again. Might try same recipe with cottage cheese just to see if it is so good because of the sour cream or if it is the overall recipe that is great.

I've had a good lasagna recipe for the last year that calls for cottage cheese or ricotta. But most of the time I don't have these two ingredients on hand, so I really wanted to give this sour cream version a try. 

I followed the recipe pretty close, I only added more garlic. 

The verdict? My family loved it! I didn't tell them initially what diary product I used so they were quite astounded by the addition of sour cream. It is rather hard to tell sour cream apart from cottage cheese. Ricotta, on the other hand, has distinct characteristics that the other two cannot create. Anyway, the flavor was exceptional and I am extremely happy with the results. Since I always have sour cream in the fridge, lasagna will be made more often.

This was the best lasagna ever! I did change it a bit though which is why I only gave it a 4.
My changes are as follows:
Sauté 1 finely chopped onion, 1 shallot, 3 cloves of garlic, 2 tsp oregano & 2 tsp basil, a handful of fresh chopped parsley and salt and pepper in 2 tlbs butter. When this started to sweat I added in 2 links of chopped up hot Italian sausage (I’d rather a piece of sausage then it crumbled up in my sauce) once this was cooked through maybe 4-5 minutes I added the ground beef & cooked until it was browned. I didn’t drain the meat. Then the diced tomato’s, the tomato sauce as well as ½ can tomato paste. I cooked on low for 2 hours. I also made some really small meatballs starting by frying them and finished cooking them in the sauce.
For the cheese filling I used ½ container of sour cream & ½ container of cottage cheese, 1 egg, mixed in the parm & mozza and some S&P.
Baked in a 350 oven for 45min (covered) then turned the oven up to 425 and cooked for another 10-15 minutes uncovered until it as brown as you like. Let sit for 15 minutes so the cheese can set.
My hubby said it was the best he’s ever had!!! It was delish!

This is the best lasagna I have every tasted.  We used stewed tomatoes and it worked great I strained the tomato mitxure as I layered it together.  This was super easy to make it didn't take as long as they said it would.  I remember having lasagna once from a restuarant that was amazing and I think this was their recipe, it was fantastic.

If you don't wanna use Ricotta but want the real lasagna taste, this is the perfect recipe. This will be a regular in my home.

Really liked this lasagna, the flavor was awesome. I omitted about a cup of the sour cream mixure and used less noodles. I have never been in to lasagna with ricotta in it and am so happy to find a recipe that I really like without the ricotta. I also would have never imagined loving the green olives since I do not eat them normally but it really adds a unique flavor to this dish.

I omitted the olives, simply because I forgot to add them.  I had already made  the "Field Grade Spaghetti Sauce" recipe from this site, so I used it and it worked out great.  No more cottage cheese in  lasagna for us, the sour cream is wonderful. This will be my go-to recipe from now on!  Our guests raved and took the leftovers home with them.  Thanks for sharing!

Really good flavor! This morning hubby stated he was hungry for lasagna so I thought I'd surprise him with a pan for dinner.  As I pulled out my ingredients, I discovered my ricotta cheese was not good so I pulled up AllRecipes and found a recipe that did not call for ricotta or cottage cheese (I can't stand cottage cheese).  This was perfect.  He said I could make this recipe again, even though it had no ricotta cheese.

First, I didn't follow this recipe exactly because I omitted olives because I don't like them much. I like ricotta and didn't have ricotta on-hand one day; and I was happy to find this recipe since I had sour cream on-hand. I was hesitant about the flavor and was pleasantly surprised at the result! My hubby really liked the lasagna too and was surprised that I used sour cream. One suggestion that I borrowed from a friend is to add thinly sliced carrots to the sour cream (or ricotta) mixture. Carrot adds a crunch, orange color interest and perhaps nutritional value to any lasagna. I also want to try small cuts of broccoli florets in the sour cream (or ricotta) mixture. This would sort of incorporate the feel of a veggie lasagna into a traditional meat recipe.

I havde made this recipe 20 times and I always omit the olive. I also layer it a little different. With that said I get so many compliments. I was told the other day by my son's teacher that it's the best she's had in her whole life. This is by far the best Lasagna I've ever had it is even better than Bertoli. I will always make this recipe and definately reccomend it to everyone I meet. Thank you for posting this recipe on here the world is a happier place because of it.

I love this recipe!!! I have picky eaters at my house so I use only jar tomato sauce (2 jars)and no other tomatoes.  I also omit the salt and use only ground beef, or half ground beef half ground turkey.  It came out very salty using regular sausage and adding salt.  I use barilla no boil noodles and it turns out great.  Very delicious recipe, a new family favorite in my household!

I personally didn't like the use of the sour cream at all. I was super excited at 1st because sour cream is way cheaper than ricotta and i always seem to have it. But i just didn't like the texture and unfortunately it didn't seem to have much flavor and i used all the spices...My family didn't hate it. neither did I but i certainly didn't love it. I will do this again as a last resort.

I'm not a big fan of lasagna so I tried this approach to see if it made a difference. I followed the recipe perfectly and I was really surprised by how much I like it. The sausage and the olives give it an extra special kick.

I made this recipe without changing a thing, except I substituted Gluten Free Rice Lasagne Noodles. Even though they were no boil noodles, I boiled them anyway (7 mins) because the cook time for the lasagne is not very long.  What I love best about this recipe, is that there was no bubbling over into my oven.  I truly love this recipe and so does my husband.  I love the texture more than the clumpy cottage cheese I've tried with other recipes.  Thank You, this now my new GO TO Lasagne recipe.

absolutely amazing!! few things tho, I didn't use olives. I put a tiny bit of ricotta with the sour cream and added a few more spices. thing was I had to add more meat. i don't know if they call for extremely thin layers but with the layers I made I had to make more meat with sauce to finish the top layers. overall amazing! my whole family loves it. my fiance begs for it lol

Big hit with my family. Even our 5 year old cleaned his plate! Made as is.  Was also tempted to leave out the olives. As odd as it sounds, go ahead and throw them in.  They add fantastic flavor.  This was better than the lasagna I've been making for years!

WOW! So very good! Best lasagna I've ever had, and my mom's recipe is amazing (ricotta). The sour cream is key, don't sub this! I changed the recipe to use what I had on hand and reduced the servings to 6, although I still was able to make a 2-layer lasagna in a 7X11 dish and a 3-layer lasagna in a bread pan to freeze. Soaked noodles in hot water in sink for too long, about 45 minutes, made them noticeably chewy but didn't ruin dish, will do for 15 minutes next time. I browned venison with chopped: med. onion, 3 cloves garlic, can of mushrooms, and sprinkled with garlic powder. Used veggie pasta sauce, added 1/2 small can of tomato paste to thicken, 2 cans original Rotel, no parsley, double the basil. This sauce looked quite runny, but definitely thickened up nicely after 30 minute simmer. Followed sour cream sauce as directed but cut salt by 2/3, per other reviewers recommending to leave out all together. Added pepper until speckled throughout. This sauce was VERY runny, I thought I did it wrong, but assembled anyway as directed. Added 7 minutes to cook time at directed temp. Ready in 2 hours. This was delicious. My 2 yo has been fighting me for days on just about everything and inhaled this with a happy dance. Can't wait to have next day and from frozen. Will update.

This was one of the best lasagnas I've ever made.  From the reviews, I was expecting a fairly different flavor but to me it just tasted like great lasagna, minus the "grittiness" of ricotta.  I don't mind ricotta but I sometimes don't like having to buy it just for lasagna when I already keep sour cream on hand for a lot of things.  This is now my go-to recipe.

Fantastic. I don't like ricotta or cottage cheese so this was perfect.  I used ground turkey and turkey sausage. I didn't put the olives in, but if you like them I bet they would be good.

Tasted like a classic lasagna (I omitted the green olives). The texture was great, and it held together really well. I didn't have any lasagna noodles so I substituted it with small shells (I used about 12 oz and cooked them al dente like you would the lasagna noodles). I layered them in the same way and it turned out great. I could still cut the pieces into squares, oddly enough. (I thought it would turn out to be more of just like a casserole consistency.)

My husband was skeptical at first, however, this recipe was a hit.  I omitted the olives, but otherwise made it exactly as recipe is written. It was my intention to bake it and let it sit overnight (things like this are so much better the next day).  However, when I came down to put it in the fridge, my DH had already gotten some of it!! LOL!!  We had the rest for dinner the next night and he even took some to work.  His co-worker (who is a bachelor) thought it looked so good that he asked if he could have some if any was left. He loved it as well.  This is a keeper!!

loved it. made many times. I add a little ricotta. Haven't used the green olives yet - keep forgetting to buy.  It's a basic lasagna that everyone will like - even picky eaters that don't like spicy or sausage or garlic flavors. And its just foolproof to cook. I always take plates of it to the neighbors for easy lunch the next day!

1st time I have ever made Lasagna.  Amazing.  Always had the traditional Lasagna my mother made when I was young, so thought I would try this out.  Followed exactly and it was outstanding and a nice, relaxing dish to make.  I have been thinking about doing it again here the last few days.

This was the best lasagna I've ever made! Very delicious, the whole family enjoyed it.  I love that there's no ricotta or cottage cheese.  The only changes I made were to use garlic salt in place of salt (and I used less than called for) and all we had was lowfat sour cream (couldn't tell it was lowfat at all!).  It was easy to make and came out perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Loved this. I doubled the meat quantities  (hate, hate, hate recipes that use odd amounts like 1/2 lb of meat or 1 cup of tomato sauce) . 
Because of that I added an extra 14 oz can of tomatoes. And tripled the herb amounts. Otherwise I made it pretty much down the line. Love the twang the green olives add.
As I type this I'm having leftovers for brekkie. Lasagna, it's not just for dinner anymore.

I had fun making it. I made 2 for the freezer.. SO by the time we get around to eating them. .. {On one of THOSE nights where I HATE the kitchen,The stove, & Especially the Dishes UGG.  And just NEED a break} The flavors should be melded perfectly!! Super Excited about that!! These were super simple to make, and the ingredients  mainly were already in my cupboard or fridge.. Also the price is right.. What it cost me to make 2 lasagna, I could get maybe one of those freezer lasagnas at the store. These are so much better!!

Like many others used a jar of pasta sauce, no olives, instant lasagna sheets and a mozzarella / cheddar / parmesan mix on top (still 250g) . Otherwise, followed the recipe and it was fantastic, everyone loved it. Will now be my go to lasagna  recipe. Will only use half the salt though,  sauce jar has a fair bit too.

For anyone who wants metric use around 500ml sour cream, 500g mozzarella (halved, as per recipe).
 
Thanks for this great recipe!

It was great! Another review said it's not like regular lasagna, but still good - but I would say I didn't notice that it was not like regular lasagna. It was great and great for when you don't have ricotta on hand and need a spontaneous lasagna!



We made it with Italian sausage (instead of ground pork and beef), jarred spaghetti sauce (instead of making our own), only one egg, and less sour cream. I would say the sour cream modifications were the only important ones - I think we had about 10 ounces of sour cream, and then I added the remainder of a tub of cream cheese, maybe 2 ounces.

Super good. I didn't tell my family that I used the sour cream rather than ricotta cheese, and they didn't notice a difference. 
I even used low fat sour cream and saved a few calories!! It was moist delicious.

I have nothing against ricotta but was intrigued by this recipe. I'm so glad I tried it! It was delicious and I will be making it again. Next time I will definitely cut the salt in half...the olives and sausage made the dish salty enough. And I think I will add mushrooms to the red sauce.

Oh goodness,  this was awesome!  Super tasty and my new go-to recipe for lasagna.  Who knew you could use sour cream!  So happy to find this recipe as my hubs dislikes ricotta cheese, and I didn't have cottage cheese on hand.  I made the recipe as written, but omitted the olives (disliked).  Threw on some parsley as my "pretty it up" garnish.  ....gotta go, time for 2nds!

This was very very good.  It is a nice twist on traditional lasagna.  Since I'm the only one in my family that likes ricotta, this recipe was perfect.  I used tomato sauce from a jar and it was still very good.

If I could give this 100 stars I would!  This is the only lasagna recipe I use now!  Whenever I used to make 'regular' lasagna, mine would always, without fail, turn out too dry... no matter how much liquid I would add.  But not with this recipe!  Wow... just amazing!  
My few changes do not change the integrity of the recipe... such as no sausage (can't eat it so just use ground beef), no sugar (not needed), no olives (no one likes), I use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream (no flavor change at all just better for you).  There is no problem with using GF lasagna noodles either.
To be fair, there have been a few times (like when on vacation) that I couldn't remember exactly what was needed so just used a jar of spaghetti sauce.... it didn't matter... still turned out great!
Thank you for the awesome recipe!

This was soooooo good! My husband and I both dislike ricotta cheese, so this was a very pleasant surprise. I used chicken instead of pork and beef, and added spinach, mainly because it was what I had on hand. And for the record, my husband strongly despises olives, and he still loved this dish. For the reviews complaining about it being bland...well, add the seasoning to your own tastes! Oh, I also added a little more sauce. This is a wonderful wonderful recipe with tons of room to add and subtract as you will. Thanks!!!

My husband, who isn't usually a lasagna fan, enjoyed this version.  I thought it had great flavor with no overpowering seasonings like some other recipes. My only changes were that I used all ground beef (don't like pork), omitted the olives and used a 40 oz jar of marinara sauce in place of the sauce & tomatoes which I thought was perfect. I added all the seasonings called for. Oh & I used half sour cream & half ricotta (probably a little extra of each). Next time I will cut back on the salt to 1&1/2 tsp as I though it was just a little too salty (may be because I used a marinara sauce). I will definitely keep this recipe!

This was a great recipe! Turned out great. I tend to change recipes based on what I have in the pantry/fridge. I used one 15 oz.  can tomato sauce and one 15 oz. can diced tomatoes. I also used 1 lb hamburger meat. Turned out great.

A different twist to lasagna.  I only had 8 oz. of sour cream, so I made up the other 8 oz. with Greek plain yogurt.  Omitted the olives, due to personal taste.  This was very good, but I missed the heavier taste that the ricotta cheese gives the cheesy layer.  But, I usually have sour cream and/or Greek yogurt on hand, so I would make this again.  I let it rest for 10 minutes when I took it out of the oven, before cutting.  Loved the way it set up, cut and served.  I made three casserole dishes out of one recipe.  One for us, my in-laws and son and DIL.  Served ours with cottage cheese,'Open Faced Mozzarella Sandwich' and 'Easy Fried Eggplant' both AR recipes.

Wasn't trying to alter this but had to use what was on hand. For meat we had some store prepared cheese and bacon burgers that I fried and used. I had a jar of garden chunky spaghetti sauce in the fridge I needed to use up. Only had 8oz of sour cream, so used 8oz of plain low fat yogurt we had in the fridge. Mixed that with celery salt and the eggs and pepper. Also used oven ready noodles. Put it all together and was cooked and ready in 30 minutes! So good!

Family really enjoyed, except for the chunks of tomatoes but I couldn't even taste them. Were trying out lasagna recipes, we would make this again.

I will be making this again soon.  I used non-fat greek  yogurt rather than sour cream.  My husband who loves sour cream didn't notice the change up.  I also used the no boil noodles.  It made for a very easy and quick meal.  I made this in two 9x9 pans.  I baked one and froze the other for a easy future dinner.

This was great. LOVE the cheesy-ness. The only thing is that I think I need more tomato sauce. I used the oven ready lasagna noodles and I think those soaked up most of the sauce.

Let me say this dish looks awful, but tastes GREAT. I'm used to making very pretty traditional Lasagnas but this one stood out. When I made this my husband said flat out this is how I want my lasagna from here on out. I thought maybe he was being nice but my mother in law came back and asked me for the recipe repeatedly. AS others have said i omit the olives (for my picky kids sake)

This recipe was excellent! I made it for my boyfriend and family and everyone loved it. I didn't boil the noodles I just soaked them in warm water. I also didn't use pork sausage and just used a pound of ground beef. I would absolutley recommend this recipe for others to try!
