I made this pasta salad last night for dinner it was really good. I follow the recipe, with the exception of adding some siracha to spice it up a bit. if your family doesn't like things spicy make it the way it is, it will be delicious.

Not a lot of taste. I was excited about the coconut milk and ginger but both flavors were so subtle that it left the pasta salad bland.
