Very quick to prepare and a tasty sauce. I also whipped this together when I was out of barbecue sauce (and Tabasco), so added 1/2 of a finely diced chipotle pepper (drained off the adobo sauce), and used a sugar-free ketchup, because husband needs to cut down sugar.  Chipotle added a nice underlying smokiness to the taste, I would recommend it. Simmered it for about 35-40 minutes, because I needed it that night. It was quite good even the same day, but was definitely a better sauce the next day, worth the wait. It was a hit, and will make it again. Thank you for adding it.

Delicious. Tangy and sweet and very zippy! I reduced the Tabasco by half so there would be a higher chance that my kids would eat it. I made it the night before, and then used it on beef ribs in the crock pot. Wonderful flavor! The ribs are gone, but I've been eating the leftover sauce on rice all week. I'll make this again any time I need a bbq sauce and have time to let it sit all night.

This is the best barbecue sauce recipe ever.  I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled it as I was making it for a pork butt in the slow cooker.  The aroma in the house made us craving the pork all day. I used about a cup of it to cook the pork in and added more to the pulled pork when I served it.  DELICIOUS! Why buy those expensive sauces with lots of additives when you can make a great sauce with ingredients I have in my pantry.  Thank you Havicc.

I made it as written, except for the white wine vinegar because I was out.  The apple cider vinegar I subbed worked great and the sauce was so delicious it will be the only recipe I will use from now on.  Thank you for sharing it.

I have a pork shoulder in the Crockpot headed towards pulled pork.  I wanted a special barbecue sauce.  This is an excellent basic recipe - all the important elements are there.  I did tweak it a little and it is AMAZING!  I used a little less worcestershire sauce, fresh minced garlic instead of granulated, used Sriracha instead of Tabasco and added some onion powder and two bay leaves.  THEN, I added two tablespoons of Jack Daniels whiskey.  I've decided to make a huge batch and keep it in the fridge.  It is SO good!

This is the BEST recipe! I love the flavor of Sweet Baby Ray original BBQ sauce. This tastes like it except without the nasty corn syrup/high fructose corn syrup in it. I have a bad allergy to corn products so this is my go-to BBQ sauce. I love it so much! Thank you for this recipe :) I will use it forever!

Very nice barbecue sauce. Not too sweet. I used fresh garlic instead of dry because that is what I had. I grilled some baby back ribs and basted them generously with this sauce and it was ONO. Thanks for sharing Havicc Brine!

Very good and easy to make!  I ended up using Rice wine vinegar because that's what I had and it was still delicious.  I think you could experiment with using different vinegars if you wanted to.  I think this is a good all around bbq sauce!

I mostly followed this.  Except I whisked the ingredients in the bottom of a crockpot, added another half cup water, tossed in some  frozen boneless skinless chicken pieces and refrigerated overnight.  Cooked all day on low.  Used a little arrowroot to thicken, adding another half cup of water in the process.  

My family believes they would be happiest if I made this 4 days a week for the rest of their lives. 

Impossible to add a photo because there is nothing left.   I am going to used this for a OAMC recipe.  Will work great.  I like being popular.

I made this today.  I substituted the hot sauce with Frank's Thick Hot sauce.  I decreased the ketchup to 3/4c. I added rice white wine 1 TBL. 2 T Brown sugar. I didn't add garlic because I had garlic in my dry rub. I used dark molasses. cooked 20 minutes. Used right away basting ribs every 15 minutes. ( I dry rubbed my ribs the night before. Placed in a broiler pan with 1/4 c red wine vinegar and filled to top with water, lightly cover with aluminum foil, bake at 375 for an hour and half. Then basted every 15 minutes for 45 minutes.

It was a little bland as written, but I added another tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce and 2 tablespoons of mustard, and it was great.

I have been using this recipe for a couple years now, it is by far our favorite.  It has just the right mix of flavors, and I almost always have the ingredients on hand, although I sometimes substitute honey for the molasses and minced fresh garlic for the powder.  It works well on pork, beef and chicken, in the crockpot, on the grill or in the oven. I have tried using it without refrigerating it first, it's good but best when it has a chance for the flavors to blend.

This is a really good sauce.  I made it just as described, except I used a bit of cayenne pepper instead of tabasco (no tabasco sauce in this house!).   I am really looking forward to having it tomorrow!

My first attempt at BBQ sauce.  I followed the recipe to the letter and loved it.  Agree with leaving it overnight.  It certainly tasted better for it.  I'll definitely use this one a lot.

Tasty.  Bottled BBQ sauce usually has smoke flavoring, which is a no-no for people allergic to MSG.  I forgot Worcestershire, but it turned out well anyway.  To give smokiness I subbed chipotle pepper.

Really nice. Much less boring than the typical barbecue sauce. I prefer my bbq sauce on the spicier, less ketchup-y side of the scale, and this was just right. I started out making a small batch for a sandwhich, then tasted it, and wished I had made a lot more!

I made this for a company party and got RAVE reviews! I followed the recipe to a "T" with one small change. I had smoked some pork shoulders for pulled pork and was left with some wonderful smoky drippings! I added about a tablespoon of the drippings (fat skimmed of course) to the sauce, wow! It totally lifted this already AMAZING sauce to a new level!

This is an excellent BBQ sauce.  I tried it once, liked it and then made it again the next week.  This time I quadrupled the recipe so I would not have to keep making it.  I used regular garlic (in jar) instead of granulated garlic.  This sauce is worth keeping and I will not be buying store bought any more.

This is a quick and tasty basic sauce.  It is very easy to add your own "twist" to this recipe.  I added 1 teaspoon of cloves and a tablespoon of honey...very good!

Loved it and used it on Slow Cooker Barbeque from this site and used more to drizzle over the sandwich which was on a potato roll and had slaw on it. Delicious!

Great sauce ... I used it for BBQ beef sandwiches that I made in the crockpot. Can't wait to use it for all my other BBQ recipes! No more store bought for us!

I made this sauce for the first time this weekend for use in making ribs in the slow cooker.   They were a huge hit!    I don't like the thick sauces that seem to have become standard these days, and was very pleased with the consistency.    The straying I did from the recipe was that I used crushed dundicut peppers to give it the kick instead of Tabasco.   It was simply outstanding!

Absolutely fantastic! I make it all the time. Most recently put it in some pulled pork for a potluck, there was no more pork left! Would absolutely recommend!

I made this sauce but made a few mods when making for the first time- 1) I was making sauce for pulled pork so I quadrupled the recipe. I made 4 lbs kid pulled pork and did not have any sauce leftover. It’s too much water, I cut the amount in half. 2) it’s far too bitter with the amount of vinegar-I doubled the brown sugar. 3) I used honey Dijon instead and it works much better. 4) I used two cloves of garlic in the sauce, and 1 T Cajun spice, 2T hot chili powder, 1T mild chili powder. After boiling then simmering, I ran it through a strainer to remove the garlic bits then cooled completely, and placed in a plastic Rubbermaid 1/2 gallon water bottle and closed the lid. It was perfect the next morning. You could cut the vinegar in half instead of doubling the sugar, but the vinegar really is needed. I could probably just make my own recipe from this but it’s a solid base to start from then tweak to your own specs.

Use this as my base sauce. Usually make about 2 gallons. I only put in water to clean out bottles of ketchup and mustard. We like a thicker sauce. Also, use apple cider vinegar.
We will take about a quarter of what we make and add honey to it, for a sweeter taste.

OOOOOOOKKKKKK this BBQ sauce is amazing! Thank you very much for the recipe! Only changes I made is regular mustard instead of Dijon and Sriracha instead of Tabasco because of what I had on hand. Everything else exactly the same. Side note- it does have a bit of a kick that kiddos might not be a huge fan of. I bet it'd taste just fine without the pepper and hot sauce.

I usually go to my favorite rib place to get a cup or two of their sauce when I need it. I decided to make my own barbecue sauce to jazz up crock pot beef I made for a crowd. This recipe is easy to adjust for serving size. It was simple to put together, and suited the varying tastes of the group. I prefer the consistency to bottled sauces, which are too gloppy for me. It can be easily adapted to personal taste.

Better than Sweet Baby Ray because of the freshness factor. I followed recipe until I discovered my brown sugar hardened to a brick. Couldn't find my hammer and chisel, so  I used white sugar instead. I think the molasses more than made up for the missing brown sugar. After simmering, I decanted half the sauce in my slow cooker of shredded pork and cooled the rest in fridge. Sauce was sassy and fresh both ways.

I found a recipe for  slow cooker pulled chicken barbecue, but I didn't have the sauce handy so I made it! I was missing a few of the ingredients for the recipe so for wine vinegar I substituted apple cider vinegar and some Chardonnay.  The sauce was amazing and so easy  but make sure to check the ingredients you have on hand just in case.

Very easy, and tasted wonderful on my boneless short ribs!  I didn't have brown sugar, so substituted an additional half tablespoon of molasses and 1 teaspoon of  white sugar.  I didn't find that the amount of hot sauce called for was too much; provided just a tiny amount of heat that was just right.  Will be making this one again!

I was confused!  I wanted sauce for my calzone and looked up barbecue sauce instead of pizza sauce.  I'm over 65; it happens!  Anyway, I made the recipe almost exactly as stated except I used white wine instead of the vinegar and regular mustard instead of dijon.  Extremely easy and delicious!  And it worked on my calzone!

The sweet/tangy/spicy ratios were just right! I had to be creative with ingredients because of what I had on hand, but it turned out great anyway (lemon juice instead of vinegar, a couple spoons of salsa instead of hot pepper sauce, minced garlic instead of granulated). Yum!!!

Great sauce and so easy to make!  I used it to to make pulled pork and everyone said it was my best pulled pork yet (I previously used store bought BBQ sauce).  I did decrease the salt and hot sauce (for the kids) and eliminated the mustard due to an allergy and it still came out great.  Definitely a keeper!

Awesome zippy barbecue sauce! Simply put, you're quite possibly just not human if you don't like this sauce. I made it exactly as written and simmered shredded chicken in it. The sauce soaked into the chicken making it incredibly juicy, tender, and loaded with zippy flavor. This is one that will absolutely, most definitely be my go to BBQ sauce. Thanks a gazillion for sharing it!

Quick, easy, and tasty.  I left the water out, heated the remaining ingredients to boiling in a skillet along with shredded left-over chicken and frozen snap-peas, and served over jasmine rice.  Delicious!

This is the best barbecue sauce I have every made, bar none. It tastes like it has hint of  liquid smoke -but it does not. Everyone who tastes this raves about it. I'd give it 10 stars if I could - it is that good. I've made the recipe exactly as written about 5 times. It is a winner. No changes. I double the ingredients every time.  Wonderful right out of the pan but even better the next day as the vinegar has mellowed and flavors have blended so that it is hard to pick out any ingredient that is in it. Superb and super simple.

So delicious! I won't buy bottled sauce ever again. Pure ingredients without a bunch of additives and overload of corn syrup. Also, this sauce sticks nicely to meat on the grill.  I used Frank's Red Hot sauce instead of Tabasco and the results are fabulous!

great sauce! my husband says it's mandatory to make this sauce for my barbecue,  but what's it the same day not the next day. the vinegar flavor is there if you use it the same day and not refrigerated.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and it was just enough.  If you are serving more than 4 people, consider increasing the recipe even more.

Amazing! I didn't think I had any BBQ sauce so I made this. After it was cooling on the stove I found a store bought bottle in the fridge. I compared the two. The homemade sauce was a million times better than the popular store brand! Definitely making my own from now on!!

Delicious blend of flavors!  This will be a go-to sauce for me.  As with most any sauce I make, I add a bay leaf.

Used it for pulled chicken sandwiches, cut back on the hot sauce a little for my picky eaters but otherwise was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again.

Great! I substituted in regular mustard, a healthy squirt of Sriracha sauce, and a few cloves' worth of minced fresh garlic. I usually don't particularly care for barbecue sauce, so this is a great find.
