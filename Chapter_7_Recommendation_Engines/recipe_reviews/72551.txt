Both ways of preparing are delicious.  When peppers are on sale I buy a large quantity.  I wash them, dry slightly, and oil them on the outside.  Place them in a cookie sheet and broil them on high.  Do not walk away, open door, check and turn as needed to brown all sides.  When skins are almost black remove from oven, place in plastic bag to loosen the skin, then peel the peppers. Now you can freeze them, single layer on a cookie sheet, after that place in freezer bag.  Then when you feel like having one they are ready.  They will keep for months in the freezer.

This is a great recipe!  Very authentic, I lived in Mexico for 8 years and this is right on the money!  Here's another tip for those of you who do not like battered things.  Follow the same instruction here (toasting and removing the skin( but instead of coating the chiles, cut them into strips and fry them with strips of onion.  Once they are cooked, add the cheese and some cream.  This makes a nice gooey mess that you can eat in tacos.

This tasted great but what a mess.  I learned afterward that you can just broil the pepers in the oven in order to blacken them.  Much less messy and probably better for you.

Just a little tip on charring peppers:  Heat up the old deep fryer and deep fry peppers a few at a time, drain on paper towels, let cool and skin.  Oh so easy! and so much faster than the other ways. The oil does NOT soak into the peppers.
Learned this from a pro cook in South Texas!

I blackened my peppers under the broiler instead of in a frying pan.  I tried removing the stems and seeds after blackening and steaming, but the pepper tore up pretty easily, so I would do it beforehand next time.  I dipped each peeled pepper in an egg wash, rolled them in Panko bread crumbs, and baked at 350 for 10 minutes rather than frying.  Delicious!  It didn't taste too different from restaurant chile rellenos but was much healthier without all the oil.  That said, this was quite time consuming, but they were fun to make.

I also broil the peppers using a small toaster oven.  Try Pepper Jack cheese, makes for a nice flavor!  I also choose to bake rather than fry.  Also try sauteing some onions, fresh tomatoes (chile serranos if you like HOT) with a little water and chicken caldo (broth). Pour this ontop of the poblanos while they are baking in the oven, or add the poblanos to the mixture in the pan, cover and allow the cheese to begin to melt! Add freshly chopped cilantro right before serving! YUMMY!

I'd definitely like to keep experimenting with this recipe. I read other variations that said broil the peppers for 5-10 minutes until the skin is black then remove it under running water instead of frying it twice. I decided to broil it (didn't see the point of frying it, stuffing it, then frying it again?)and place it in a tightly sealed bowl for 30 minutes to steam the skin off and this way worked really well for us. I used flour and egg for the batter to make it more substantial also. I think this frying method is perfect, but next time I will try harder to find the cheese recommended in this recipe. All I could find was queso fresco and it didn't melt well or taste very much like the restaurant versions of chile relleno that we are used too. Thanks for posting this recipe, DH and I order these every time we go out for mexican!

This is a fine recipe. Mine is simpler. I don't bother charring and peeling the peppers. I put them in a toaster oven and bake until they're soft. (Slit them first so they don't burst!) Let them cool, then take them out and seed them. Fill them with whatever cheeses you have around. Bake again until the cheese is melted. I know the true Mexican method is probably better!

Great recipe.  The hardest part is blackening the peppers and getting off the skin.  After that, it was easy and delicious.  I always order these when we go to Mexican restaurants, but now I can make them at home.  And, I like the thin crust this makes.  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

My husband and family are from Mexico and his mom just got here not long ago and taught me a recipe close to this. The differences are she likes to use Cotija cheese. Preferably freshly packaged at a mexican store and the she will coat the stuffed poblano with a thick coat of wisked egg whites before flouring. Then after browning them she adds them to a thickened tomatoe soup like base consisting of tomatoes, cumin, onion, garlic, and salt and simmer for a few minutes. Yes, its a mess but well worth it.

these peppers were wonderful, it was my 1st time making anything like this & I found it wasn't that difficult and everyone loved them (I even added some seasoned browned beef to a few of the peppers when stuffing with the cheese).

Made Pork Carnitas last night and fixed this for the side everyone loved them. It was a little spicy for some but it was GREAT.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe. I followed the insructions to the letter, but I suppose it's possible that I did something wrong. I had trouble blackening the peppers equally on all sides and removing the skins. Then, when I heated the oil and fried the peppers, my house filled with smoke! My poor dogs fled the kitchen (which is a first!), fearing for their lives. The flavor was nice— surprisingly mild, but it just wasn't what I was hoping for.

I really liked this but I like more of a batter. But these were so good that we thought about chopping them up and making nachos!

My grocery store doesn't carry pablanos so I tried the recipe with jalapenos.  Following the advice of another cook, I blackened the peppers in the broiler which worked well.  They were still a bit time-consuming.  Per the alternative cooking methods I dipped them in egg white first and used mont jack cheese.  My husband loved them but these will have to be just a once in a while venture.

Didn't have Poblano peppers, but we had some long orange sweet peppers from the farmers market. Great recipe and the family loved it. Added a mild salsa verde as a dip, and it was a home run
