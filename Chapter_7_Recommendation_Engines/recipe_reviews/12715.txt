This is a five star recipe -- with the following changes:  add 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and italian seasoning.  I actually added 2 tsp italian seasoning and 1 tsp pizza seasoning, as we like lots of seasoning.  Since we have a toddler, we also chopped the onion fine and processed the tomatoes into smaller bits...she ate it up.  Served over brown rice.  We all agreed, it was delicious!

Excellent!  My husband is still raving about this fish.  I used thick cuts of Cod, and italian style diced tomatoes.  Added some extra seasonings, as suggested by earlier reviews, and--most importantly--added about a pound of raw shelled shrimp at the same time as the fish.  Loved the fact that this dish is SUPER quick and very healthy!

Absolutely delicious and so quick and easy.  I used tilapia fillets, Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, chicken stock and kalamata olives.  My husband, who isn't a big fan of fish, loved it.

This was a horribly bland recipe. I won't say it was totally bad - it served as a pretty good base but I really had to doctor it up with LOTS of fresh herbs, salt & seasonings. I would make it again based on my own ingredients but not as it is shown here on allrecipes. Sorry.

I love this recipe but have modified it some - I skip the onion and use chicken stock instead of the wine.  I also add a can of sliced mushrooms and use italian style canned tomatoes.  To finish it off I thicken it a little with some corn starch just before serving and serve over rice made with the rest of the can of chicken stock.  Very flavorful.

This was very good.  My wife is not a big fan of fish, and she said this was delicious.  Used haddock, and omitted the olives.  Threw in some Italian seasoning and parmesan cheese for added flavor.  The leftovers heated up very nicely in the microwave.  I'll be making this again.  Loved how fast it was to make, as I have a busy schedule.

I am a firm believer in rating a recipe as it was written.  With that being said, I would give this recipe 4 stars based on the written recipe.  4 stars because it was quick, healthy and the ingredients are something that I usually always have on hand which is always a plus for any recipe.

Once it was done, I thought it needed to be tweaked a bit, so I added red pepper flakes, pepper & Italian seasoning to the mix.  These additions helped it to not be so bland.  I served the mixture over a bed of fresh spinach and added a pinch of parmeasean cheese on top and wellah . . .  turned this recipe into 5 stars! Too bad the battery on my camera was dead because this looked really fancy on my plate.

Next time I think I'll add fresh mushrooms - and trust me - there will be a next time for making this recipe.  Thank you for sharing Bonnie.

I've made this several times using different types of fish (cod, pollack) and my husband loves it. I use Italian seasoned diced tomatoes for added flavor and serve with couscous.

I make a variation of this dish and would agree that as presented, I too would find it bland...but then I like heavily seasoned and spices food. I recommend cooking the cod in the oven wrapped in aluminum foil as I like to get the excess liquid out. 

In a pot I use canned diced tomatos (to keep prep fast) that are already seasoned with basil and garlic and then add alot more basil, oregeno, garlic and crushed red peppers. I also add some anchovie paste that provides a little saltiness. I add slides olives and mushrooms and spinach and simmer. 

At the end I add the fish that has been drained and just toss and serve.

I doubled this recipe and served it to guests yesterday.  While I agree that it's very quick and easy, it is very bland.  I added chopped green pepper to the onion and garlic, and I seasoned with salt, pepper and Italian seasoning, but still found it to be rather unexciting.  There's definitely something missing.  My guests, however, loved it, and two had second helpings. *****UPDATE!**** I had leftover sauce which I reheated and let it cook down to a very nice texture.  The ingredients blended beautifully and the sauce was a 10000% improvement.  Now I like this recipe, and will certainly make it over and over.  I've upgraded my rating to 5 stars!

This is a great fish recipe to have on hand. My husband and I found it to be very tasty and it was easy to make. I'd suggest adding some salt & pepper and possibly some italian seasonings.

I live 20 minutes from the nearest store, so I adapted this recipe using ingredients I had on-hand.  The sauce was addicting, and my 7 year-old ate every bite!  I used 4 frozen tilapia filets; hunts diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano; and a sweet, white table wine. Because the wine was sweet instead of dry, I added garlic salt, cajun spice and lemon.  We do not care for parsley so I used a little rosemary and thyme from my garden.  We licked our plates!

The trick to this dish is to not overcoook any component. Fire roasted tomatoes, salt and some Italian seasoning are nice additions to the original but this is an excellent fish entree. I've made it many times, all to rave reviews !

This should be in the Hall of Fame! The only thing I changed was, instead of using white wine, I used white sherry, and I added italian seasoning and an extra clove of minced galic (we love garlic). Even my 11 yr. old son who HATES any kind of fish, loved this! I would give it 5 stars just for that! I served it with egg noodles instead of rice, I thought it would go a lot better, and it was GREAT. I also served it with an italian herb salad with crusted bread YUM!!

I added diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning instead of plain and it was very good! I also added some sea salt as well. Be careful not to overcook the fish though as it cooks quite quickly.  I would definitely make it again!

Fast and easy.  We love it.  I didn't have fresh parsley and canned tomato, so I used dried parsley and freash tomato.  It still came out delicious.

We loved this!  I used tilapia instead of cod – any firm white fish would work.  I used fresh basil rather than the parsley, because my tomatoes were already seasoned with garlic, oregano and basil.  I made the sauce early in the afternoon.  When it was almost done I thickened it with a water/cornstarch slurry – just enough to give it some body.  When it had cooled somewhat, I covered and refrigerated it.  Then at dinnertime, I just brought it to a simmer and popped in the fish.  Dinner was on the table in a flash!  Excellent flavor for so little effort, a repeater for sure!

This was good and extremely quick, great for a weeknight meal. I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes since that's what I had in the pantry. I also used liberal amounts of Italian seasoning, and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes. I subbed chicken broth for the white wine, and used kalamata olives. This was very good sprinkled with a little bit of crumbled feta cheese. Hubby didn't care for it, but he loathes fish.

Pretty good base to start with, but could use some dressing up. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, which i roasted in the oven with basil, garlic and olive oil.  I seasoned the fish with more basil, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes and a little old bay seasoning. I also used kalamata olives, which were so yummy! In the future, I would add some mushrooms and maybe some artichokes, which my husband loves.

I always try a recipe twice if there are other recommendations before giving a low review. The first time I used haddock. The filets are thin so they cooked pretty quick but I found the combo with tomatoes a little odd tasting and bland. Next time I used cod, roasted and upped the garlic and added fresh basil. That made it less bland but it still seemed off to me. Maybe try a spoon or two of tomato paste and caramelizing the tomatoes.

My daughter has recently declared herself a vegetarian, but does not like veggies.  This makes it hard to find something she will eat, since she doesn't like fish either.  This fish recipe is one that she requests NIGHTLY.  Delicious - even I eat it.

I used blue hake fish from Schwans.  My only addition was a can of mushrooms and I used chicken broth since I don't have any wine.  Served over angel hair pasta since we had rice the night before.  Will make again for sure!

I have made this a few times and we love it. This recipe works with many types of fish. Will be making this again and again. Thanks for this great recipe Bonnie! UPDATE: I forgot to mention I use the tomatoes with onion, celery and green peppers in it. It has more flavor!

Oh man, I am an executive chef now with this recipe!  I was amazed at how easy this was to prepare and the taste was excellent!  I used tilapia because I am a poor college student and it costs half as much as cod.  It still came out flaky and juicy.  Just pair this meal with a glass of the wine you use to cook the dish and you'll be all set for a lovely, restaurant quality dinner.

Great flavor.  I added fresh basil, oregano, and parsley.  I would simmer for a bit longer to evaporate some of the liquid.  I served this over rice.  Very GOOD!

This was really good.  I didn't have any black olives...so I just omitted them.  I used tilapia fillets and they turned out so great.  Will definately make this again.  Thanks

This was an excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe as stated.  I served the fish with mashed potatoes, asparagus and texas toast.  I would recommend serving with a bread so that you can catch all of the juice.  Both my husband and I commented that it was the type of meal we would get at a restaurant.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe and also looks appealing to the eye.  I remember a TV Chef saying once "You taste it first with your eyes" and that's what made me try this recipe.  It looks wonderful and it tastes great too.  I did add some salt to it, but that's the only thing it needed.  It is wonderful.

Excellent!  I used cod for this recipe together with a can of diced tomatoes with roasted garlic and onion.  I still used the onion and garlic called for in the recipe and did add just a dash of red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.  I served over/with thin spaghetti and we gobbled it right up.  It only took me about 30 minutes to get this on the table so this is a great weeknight meal for us.

Truly enjoyed this recipe.  I used kalamata olives, which added saltiness.  I also used canned stewed Italian tomatoes.  Next time I will add capers, and think it will be perfect.  Will make again.

I just finished eating this for dinner. This was really good. I did add Italian seasoning to a can of fire roasted tomatoes, but I failed to add the white wine. Even without the wine, this was a really flavorful and light dish. After I pulled up the cod, I added some shrimp to the left over fluid. I served this over top jasmine rice recipe from the site.

I had better expectations.  There wasn't much taste so I added soy sauce. Didn't like the black olives in there so much. Had it on a bed of rice, it was okay all together.  Don't think I'd make it again.  Thanks anyway.

We love this. I've made it quite a few times and have liked it. It's quick & easy. But since I've read more or the reviews I added the fresh basil & oregano as well as kosher salt & pepper. Also added shrimp to make it that much yummier. I serve it over rice. I'm sure I will keep tweaking it. But that keeps it interesting.

This was pretty good for a healthy dish! Subbed the wine for chicken broth since that's what I had on hand. Added some Italian seasoning like other suggested and a dash of hot pepper flecks for a slight kick. Will make again.

My stove top has not been working so I made this in the oven and it still turned out great.  It was even simple enough for me to remember without having the recipe in front of me either. Super simple/quick and delicious, will make again!

Oh my. So good.
I substituted lemon juice for the white wine as I had none in the house. And still, incredible....
This is my 4 yr old's favorite dish, he says not ONE word until his plate is clean. Served over basmati or cut up spaghetti. Delicioso!
Thanks Bonnie ;)

This is such an awesome recipe. It's a great base recipe that can be easily adjusted. I like it best with Tilapia instead of cod, mushrooms instead of olives, chicken broth instead of wine, and some Italian seasoning for a little more Italian taste.

This dish begs for salt and pepper and lemon. Fresh tomatoes are also a must along with some fresh herbs. Next time I would bread and fry the fish fillets until crispy and spoon the sauce on top. And don't forget the cheese, (as shown in the one picture, but not mentioned in the recipe.) To be honest, cod or haddock is much better under the broiler or in a beer battered fish fry. Sorry.

Ok...I give this 5 stars with a few changes...I started with one onion and added 1/4 tsp black pepper, & sauteed it slowly for 9 minutes, then added 3 cloves garlic at last min so they wouldn't burn and get bitter. When I added the tomatoes (I used 1 can whole), I rinsed the olives (kalamata) (to rid any excess salt), doubled the parsley, and also added 1/4 cup chicken broth with the wine and 1 tsp oregano. I seasoned the cod with a sprinkling of kosher salt (on one side only) along with a dash of oregano and ground sage. I also seasoned 1/2 lb shrimp with 1/4 tsp of each: olive oil, kosher salt and oregano. After simmering 5 min, I added the fish, cooked 2 min, and added the shrimp (with the lid on) so they would poach. I served over brown rice with a side of asparagus. I topped each serving with fresh parsley and capers (which I also rinsed to remove excess salt). The dish was FABULOUS!! I was worried about the salt, but it turned out perfectly- serving over rice really helps with that! I cannot wait to make this again- it's light and healthy and perfectly delicious! Serve it in a bowl so your guests can take in all the juicy goodness- enjoy!!

Very good!  I use kalamata olives and I add a tablespoon of italian seasoning.  I don't add the parsley b/c I haven't had it on hand either time I've made this recipe.

No kidding this was amazing!  I'm not one to hand out 5 stars easily.  I'm also not a person to comfortable cooking fish, but I'm telling you this was excellent.  I added the 1/2tea salt and pepper and Italian seasoning as someone else suggested.  I also used Italian diced tomatoes..it was great.  Very easy.  Oh, I also used flounder fillets because they are what I found in the grocery store for cheap.  Don't hesitate to cook this, it really will surprise you.

This was a nice fish, but we didn't "ooh" and "ah" over it. I put salt and pepper on the fish before it went it, and added fresh basil to the sauce so it wasn't bland for us. I also used halved cherry tomatoes instead of the canned tomatoes, not sure if this made it better or worse. Not bad, but I think I'll stick with the recipe for Spanish Cod from this site next time we feel like something like this.

This dish is excellent and extremely easy to prepare.  To add a little pizazz, I will use the diced tomatoes with Italian herbs or I will add some basil, oregano, marjoram, or herbs de provence myself.  Catfish also works well, but you have to cook it longer.

This recipe was ok.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  If you're not a big fish fan, this is a good mild, not so fishy recipe.  I may make it again, but I'll probably add some more spices.

This was exceptional for such an easy dish! I used tomatoes with basil, skipped the olives, used frozen fish and added some Italian seasoning with the parsley. We served with couscous and steamed brocolli. Thanks a million, this will definately be a staple in our house!

I made this recipe to the specifications (plus added more garlic).  I found it bland.  However, it has so much potential that I will make it again and add kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, oregano and cayenne pepper.  I think once it is spiced up a bit this dish will be absolutely amazing.

Excellent way to cook cod; both my husband and I enjoyed it, and he's not much of a fish eater.  I did a few things differently:  I used sliced black olives, a bit more garlic, but that is because I really love garlic, and since I did not have fresh cod fillets, I defrosted some frozen ones I had on hand.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and the cod was perfectly cooked. There were no leftovers!

I am a big fan of fish and Italian cuisine so u can understand my enthusiasm 2 try this dish. However when I did, I was severely dissapointed. The fish tasted bland and the sauce was nothing more than a pasta or a pizza topping sauce. Won't do it again..

We made this with cod, omitted olives, and used Marsala wine.  It turned out very bland.  However, we fixed it with salt, MSG, pepper, and red pepper, and then it tasted pretty good.  It tasted even better the second day as left-overs.  We served this over rice as the author suggested, but pasta would probably be a lot more appropriate.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband and daughter just raved about it.  You cannot screw this up.  My cod was too thick to cook on the stovetop so I put it in the oven and it came out perfect.  I think the black olives gives it a nice little kick.  Also I think next time I will add a green vegetable to go with the red of the tomatoes and the black from the olives.

Outstanding recipe...so healthy too! Added dried basil and oregano and more olives and allowed the "sauce" to simmer for more time before adding the cod/haddock.  Once the fish is added, spoon sauce over the tops and DO NOT overcook!  Delicious Mediterranean  dish.

I've made this recipe a couple of times now. Once I used black olives; once I used kalamata olives. Once I didn't have any wine, so I used some fish broth instead; once I used some pinot grigio. Either way, this dish turns out tasty.  The only changes I made is to add the parsley last, and I add a little oregano to boost the "Italiano" factor. I serve the fish over rice with buttered, steamed broccoli on the side and a green salad. Excellent dish; I will be adding this one to my list of fish dinners.

This was a really tasty recipe!  I'm not a huge fan of fish, so this caught my eye because I thought it would help hide the fish flavor.  I was right.  If you have family members who don't care for fish, this recipe is a great choice.  I didn't change anything.  The recipe is excellent as written.  I did, however, add a sprinkle of feta over the top when it was all done.  I will be making this dish again and again!

Love this recipe!  I have used cod, haddock and tilapia and all are wonderful.  I use sliced kalamata olives in brine instead of black olives and it was delicious!

I read a lot of the reviews before making the recipe, so I used some of those ideas, plus my own instincts. I added chicken stock, Italian style canned tomatoes, and used less parsley and added fresh basil. I also used 1/4 cup kalamatta olives, instead of regular. Added parmesan cheese, Italian seasoning and other herbs/seasoning and thickened the sauce with a little flour slurry and a pat of butter. I served it with Jasmine rice and spinach and it was fabulous.

Amazing recipe! I didn't have olive oil so I used regular canola oil, also skipped on the olive, but still turn out great. Thank you for sharing!

We absolutely loved this.  I made a couple of changes, added an extra clove of garlic, crimini mushrooms, some italian seasoning, added the wine before the tomatoes and let that simmer for a few minutes, and used haddock.  Added more wine before I put the fish in, as most of the liquid had cooked off by then.  Also, used kalamata olives, which is what I assumed they meant in the first place, but I can't stand "regular" black olives as they have almost no flavor.  LOVED IT.

I made it twice.  Definitely easy and quick!  The second time I added an equal amount of basil to the parsley and thought it was better that way.  The in-laws loved it, so no complaints.

I have made this recipe before but forgot how easy and tasty it was!  I added basil, parsley and oregano to the tomato for added flavor, put it over rice and sprinkled it with parmesean cheese.  Definately will do this more often.

Pretty good! I added a bell pepper just so there'd be more veggies, and a half jar of medium-salsa. Also salt, pepper and italian seasoning. Served over rice and sprinkled some extra old cheddar on top. The spice from the salsa gives it edge :)

Substituted chicken boullion for white wine,and added other ingredients as outlined in the recipe. It was WAY too much sauce for the corresponding volume of fish called for in the recipe.  Would be much better if the sauce were reduced by at least half & if Feta cheese were added as a garnish before placing in the oven to cook.

I'm rating this for the recipe as written.  I made the onion/tomato mixture using real Calamanta Olives instead of canned black olives and it was okay but still kind of bland so I added some chopped, fresh rosemary, more garlic, about 1 Tsp. of dried Italian Herbs, a cup of mushrooms, a roasted red pepper (from a jar) a few grindings of black pepper and a quick dash of cayenne pepper.  I let the veggies and sauce simmer till the liquid was reduced before adding the fish.  I served the fish and tomato mixture with Quinoa.  With those changes, the flavor was much better and brought it to a 5 star status.

This was excellent - I added some chopped green pepper, a few sliced mushrooms that I needed to use up and some basil and oregano.  I let the sauce simmer at least 15 minutes before adding the fish to let the flavors blend a little more.  So easy and tasty!

This is a 5 star recipe for sure.  Easy, healthy and DELISH!  All three of my kids liked it which is a miracle.  I didn't have wine so I used chicken stock in it's place and I didn't have any olives, so I just left them out.  I served it over rice as recommended and it was so good.  This one is a keeper!

It was pretty good. I added extra Italian seasoning and used chicken broth instead of wine. I think I would have liked it better if the skin on the haddock was off haha idk it turned me off a oil.

This was so simple and delicious. I used fresh tomatoes from my garden.  It lacked a little salt, but was still delicious. I added extra italian seasoning and didn't have olives, but, still good.

This is a terrific recipe for something quick and easy that still tastes great and is healthy. A great base to jazz up according to your tastes. I added fresh basil, a TON of crushed red pepper, and some zukes from the garden. I topped it off with freshly grated romano and served it over rice.  A garden salad with tons of fresh veggies and a homemade parmesan vinaigrette was the perfect side. YUM!!!

Very close to a dish I've eaten at a favorite Italian restaurant.  My kids ate it without compaining which is a major accomplishment for a fish dish. I thought it was delicious although I added a little more garlic.

Love this style of cooking with fish.  Its such a light dish, but packs a lot of flavor.  I always add a few of my favorite seasonings, other than that this is a keeper.  Thanks for the healthy and delicious recipe!!

I made this in foil packets and put them on the grill, wow, delicious.  The packet made it easy to vary the recipe for my picky eater (no onions in his) and you can't beat the cleanup. A side of brown rice made the meal complete.

I used chicken broth instead of wine (although I'm sure the wine would have been delicious - just didn't have any) and substituted a medium chunky salsa for the tomatoes to give it more flavor. It definitely took on a different flavor! Overall, this was good - the sauteed onions and garlic were a must!

definitely a great recipe.  My husband loved it. I did make a few minor changes but I will definitely  make it again.  I only was cooking for 2 so I only used 2 cod filets and he ate all of the sauce he said it was to good to waste.  I lightly browned the cod in italian bread crumbs and olive oil before pouring the sauce over it.  I did add a few italian spices to the sauce as well.   It was excellent.

Wonderful dish! Use a bit extra garlic, use pre-seasoned diced tomatoes, and serve with a glass of the wine you used in the sauce. i served over basmati rice (which is kinda salty) so i would recommend adding salt to taste to this recipe

This is a good recipe but I will kick up the spice next time.  A little crushed red pepper and/or oregano or thyme could be added for some extra flavor without competing with the fish.  We topped with a little fresh parm.  Quick and easy.  A keeper for sure!

This dish was fabulous!! I added fresh mushrooms and doubled the recipe. I also used Italian diced tomatoes and a lot more Italian Seasoning. This is a beautiful dish and very healthy. I served over Zatarain's blacks beans and rice.  Wonderful!!

This is a 5 star dish!!!!  I followed advice of adding parsley, Italian seasoning in with the tomatoes and all.  Let it simmer for about 20 mins. Added Talipia underneath under the mixture and let it simmer til fish turned white.  Did add some parsesan of the top.  Served over brown rice.  Was SOOOO delicious.  Hubby LOVED it!!!!!

This turned into Greek Fish Fillets for me. I added Kalamata olives, dried oregano, salt and pepper in the sauce, then sprinkled crumbled Feta cheese over. I'm very excited about the flavor.

Loved, Loved, Loved this! The only change I made was that I used Talapia because that's what I had on hand, but otherwise, didnt change a thing. I thought this was fantastic! I am always looking for was to make fish that dont involve it being breaded of fried. I will definately make this again but will try cod, haddock or mahi mahi, or shrimp next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I rated this without trying it only to share the following: At our home, this is one of my specialties, only my version uses lots of fresh garlic, basil, sage, oregano, salt and pepper to flavor the canned tomatoes and Vietnamese cream dory fish fillets.

delicious and very easy to prepare. I wouldn't add more spices unless I want to mask the delicate taste of the cod - as we all like fish, this is not the case. and with saltwater fish we don't even add salt (you know, this is what the doctors always say - "less salt"). perfect recipe for delicate tasty types of fish. wouldn't change a thing

I made this with fresh tomatoes (I  have stored from fall garden in  our garage). I  didn't have can whole tomatoes. I  cut  reicpe  to 2 servings and used tilapia and cod,that I had in freezer from costco. I  added more seasoning -- lots of spices italain, basil and  a few dash of red pepper flakes and more  garlic with white dry  wine. Hubby especially enjoyed the olives and wants me to make this again.  Overall a very easy delicous  dish and will make again.

Easy, healthy, and cod is mild and non-fishy for those of us that don't love fish.

Takes over an hour for the wine to boil off, tasted pretty bad, even after lots of doctoring...  The fish would taste better as is, without a recipe.

This dish was wonderful. I  added seasoning, oregano, basil, a little rosemary and dill. My husband really doesn't care for rice so I used orzo.  I also used diced tomatoes with green chiles in them.  This is a keeper.

I added frozen  peas near the end because the dish needed something with "bite" I thought.  I added salt and chicken stock powder.  Skipped the white wine as I didn't have any on hand.

Have tried this twice with great results.  I do coat the fish with seasoned flour and pan fry before adding fillets to sauce.  It helps fish absorb more flavor, IMO.

I found this bland, even though I followed the directions to a T (I used cod and also took the suggestion of using the diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning). It was edible but there was nothing special about it in the least.   I think this recipe has potential though! Next time I will try it with a more flavorful type of olive instead of the canned black and maybe throw in more herbs.

This was very good.  The changes I made are  only that I added some fresh lemon juice to the sauce as well some extra garlic. I tripled the recipe and mine turned into more of a stew because the fish fell apart in the sauce but it was delicious.  Would work great as a sauce for mussels or clams as well.

Great! We made a few changes. Used red snapper, substituted Harvest Moon artichoke salad (artichoke hearts, green olives & red peppers) for the tomatoes. Also added Italian seasoning, tarragon, oregano and 1 small can of sliced mushrooms. Everything else the same. AWESOME!

A pretty good and extremely simple dish. I left out the olives, as I can't stand them, and substituted chicken stock and a dash of lemon juice for the wine, as we had none at the time, but it turned out really well. If I were to make it again, it would probably have slightly more seasoning, but as it was, this dish was good enough for me to consider it again.

This was absolutely amazing. I made the following changes: finely chopped small onion, 5-7 cloves garlic (pressed), 3/4-1 cup olives but adjust to your own taste as I love olives and others might find the taste overpowering, used the entire can of italian style diced tomatoes (juice and all) - the recipe doesn't say but I wanted be clear that you do use the juice in the recipe, 1 1/2 tablespoons of italian seasoning, 1/3 teaspoon of red pepper flakes for a little kick and 1 1/2 pounds of thickly cut cod. I simmered the sauce for 10-15 minutes, added the cod and then simmered again for another 10-15 minutes. You may have to simmer for less time if the cod is thinly cut. I served the sauce over couscous and it was delicious. I froze the rest of the sauce and the following week added 1 pound of shrimp and served it over fettuccine with some sprinkling of parmesan cheese - my S.O. and I were licking our chops and wanted more. This is such an easy and fantastic recipe that it'll definitely be in our dinner rotation.

We really like this recipe! Used marsala in place of the white wine, added the italian seasoning as suggested in previous reviews. We also seasoned the cod fillets with a little sea salt and pepper,added additional fresh garlic. I love how fast and easy it is to prepare, my husband who doesnt like tomatoes, raved. Our 12 year old went back for seconds...Thank you for posting this recipe.

This dish was a big hit. My wife described it a dish that would be perfect for an Italian bistro. She liket it so much that she blogged about it (2ndferment.blogspot).  Following some of the recommendations I read by others, I added two more cloves of garlic, added 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning, simmered the sauce for 15 minutes,simmered the fish for 5 minutes per side and used whole wheat spaghetti instead of rice. I used a 2007 Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc for the wine. It matched very well to the meal when it was served. I will definitely be making it again!

I've made a lot of fish recipes in my time, (I'm on Weight Watchers, and my hubby doesn't really like fish), but we both thought this ROCKED!   I added a mish-mash of the recommendations found here - additional spices and capers too.  We didn't serve over rice, but opted for garlic bread instead to sop up the yummy sauce. One of the best!

My husband said it was a 5, I think a 4. It is very quick & easy, but you really should use Italian tomatoes. My hubby thinks we should thicken the sauce a little. I think we should add more spice. Will make again now that I can get over the thought of fish & rice together with Italian flavors. It must be the Midwest in me.

After reading the other reviews about how bland this is, I decided to add more seasonings from the get go.  I used fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, fresh garlic, red onion, italian seasonings and italian green olives.  Pureed it all in a blender then simmered it for an hour.  I added just a tad of sugar and garlic powder while it was cooking with the cod.  Still bland.  I think this recipe has potential, but I need to figure out what's missing.  I'm giving it 4 stars.

This was super easy to make and oh so good.  I did make a few changes, as suggested by earlier reviewers.  I added some Italian seasoning blend, a little extra white wine, and then I cooked the sauce down quite a bit (simmered for at least half an hour).  I also used swordfish steaks, which, of course, required some extra cooking time, but came out really moist as the sauce was simmering on medium-low heat.  The flavor of the swordfish complemented the sauce nicely.  I sprinkled capers on top and served it up with creamy polenta and Tuscan veggies.  Very tasty!

My only modification was to use italian diced tomato. I also let the sauce simmer for about an hour to an hour to really meld the flavor. Then I steamed the cod in the sauce for about 5 minutes per side with the cover on the skillet, turned the heat off, but left the cover on while I tossed my linguine with store bought pesto, then put the cod on top of the pasta & poured the sauce over the whole thing. This was INCREDIBLE. A real show stopper! Thanks for the recipe.

Made this dish last night for dinner.  Added some italian herbs spice, chicken broth in place of the wine and it was YUMMY!  It was also so quick and easy to make.  Great for a working person who want to rustle up something quick but healthy for dinner.  Great recipe!

My family loves this recipe.  I've used cod, and left out the olives. I've made it with other fish and still came out delicious. I wouldn't change a thing.  Easy and delicious, thanks so much for sharing.

Delicious, and what's more, is really quick and easy. I followed other reviewer's advice and added Italian Seasoning, together with a bit of sea salt to bring out the flavours. We don't like cooked olives so they were left out too. It's a great one for a quick midweek supper!

This is an enjoyable and well presented meal. I halved the olive oil (to cut down on fat) and didn't miss it at all.  My husband said its a keeper.

This is excellent and serves as a nice display!  I omitted the olives (my husband isn't a fan).  Will definitely make again.

I thought this was alright.  My husband didn't like it at all.  He said it didn't have any flavor.  I think it would be better with some additional spices.  I doubled the garlic and parsley, but it just wasn't enough.  If you like fish very bland, this recipe is for you.

This is a quick & easy recipe that tastes great! You can easily pick up a one lb package of frozen cod fillets at the grocery store & don't even have to thaw the fish! I plan to use basil instead of parsley next time because I think it would work even better for my family. Thanks for the recipe!

Way to sour w/ the dry white wine and tomatoes.
I added a few tsps of sugar to neutralize the acidity and the sourness.  One thing I did like was how healthy this was though...

Fabulous, and quick!!!  I used a stew pot instead of a frying pan, chopped the cod into domino sized pieces, doubled the parsley and olives, and used a can of Rotel, instead of plain tomatoes.
When the fish was cooked, I threw in two cups of leftover rice from the fridge, let it simmer, then served it in soup bowls garnished with parsley sprigs.

Great recipe but I changed it up a bit it due to what ingredients I had available. I basically subbed a can of Rotel tomatoes w/ jalapenos and used a can of minced black olives rather than sliced. Turned out to be a zesty fish dish with a mexican flair. May resubmit it as "Fish Filets Mexacali"! Very good...lot's of sauce though...could probally cook more than a pound of filets.

This was very tasty! I hate fish and I ended up eating this for a couple of days. The sauce is woderful!! I used Orange Roughy instead of Cod. My roomate (a fish eater) loved this dish.

Wow, this definitely gets added to my fast and easy repetoire.  I doubled the fish, and used two cans of tomatoes and 1 large can of olives, chopped.  Rest stayed the same.  Served over Israeli Couscous, the boys asked for seconds, will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!  I might add a few capers next time, just for kicks.

After reading all the raving reviews, I was a little disappointed when I finally tried it out.  I used pollock fillets and chopped fresh chives instead of parsley.  The flavor was kind of bland and probably could have used some pepper.  Also, there was too much liquid in this dish.  I may try making this again, with some modifications.  I had to admit that this is a very healthy and easy to prepare entree though.

Based on other reviewer's suggestions I added a couple pinches of red pepper flakes and generous amounts of Italian herbs (basil, oregano, rosemary); replaced wine with low sodium chicken broth, and sprinkled salt and pepper on the fish when placing in the pan. I served with orzo cooked in chicken broth with basil added. Great healthy dish that is fast and yummy. When I make again I'll add more garlic and try it with wine. Thanks!

Followed recipe 'out the window'. Turned out
wonderful! Made extra onions and garlic
'cause we love them in our house. Used
dry vermouth. Worked well. This is my 
'go to' wine in just about all recipes. (Thank
you Julia).

I added a little bit more seasoning, more garlic and it was excellent over a spaghetti squash!

Second time I added chopped green pepper and mushrooms  over mixed grains and black rice.

This was delicious, super quick and easy. I did add fresh basil and think it added a nice freshness. You could do this with shrimp as well or a combo of seafood.

I agree with most reviewers here that it is light on the flavour department but delicious as a base.  I added extra vegetables for colour and variety, red chili flakes, salt and pepper.  I give it four stars because of how incredibly easy and fast it is.

This is one of my favorites on this site. It's delicious, healthy and comes together very quickly. To taste, I also added salt, pepper and Italian seasoning. I used stewed tomatoes, chopped kalamata olives and tossed in some capers as well. I've used cod twice, but I can see this with any fish that will hold up well, even shrimp or scallops. It seems Mediterranean to me. No baking or frying involved, one pan and so easy. I had it with some brown rice, but would be good with mashed potatoes or pasta. I highly recommend this! Thanks Bonnie! UPDATE 1/19/18: I used petite diced tomatoes and added a pinch of sugar to cut the acidity. I scaled it down to 2 servings and only had half of it. Trying to cut back on the carbs, I had this as-is, and it was still satisfying, delicious and filling. Great recipe!

I 3 tilapia fillets and a can of italian stewed tomatoes.  Also included greek seasoning, 2 tsp italian seasoning. No salt though because I figured the olives were enough.  I included cornstarch to make the sauce less watery.  My husband liked it better than I did.  I served it with couscous and spinach, could have used some bread.

This recipe needs a couple things and then it is really delicious - seasoning - I used some thyme and oregano.   I also made mine with cod and grape tomatoes cooked down in olive oil instead of the canned tomatoes.  I made it without the extra seasoning but when I tasted and realized it was bland so  added the herbs and cooked a few more minutes and it was very good.  I would make this again as it  was quick,  easy and healthy.

I used whole San Marzano tomatoes instead of diced and crushed them by hand before adding. I used kalamatta olives and also added about a half cup of water to the recipe. The recipe was a little bland, but was delicious once I added some salt and crushed red pepper. Will definitely make again! And so quick! Next time I'm going to add some capers. Yum!

This recipe was too bland. It really was.  Followed directions exactly and although edible, there was no WOW factor at all and really, just a forgettable dinner. Easy and quick to prepare however, I won't be repeating this one.

I am a fisherman and am always looking for good recepies for the catch of the day.  This was wonderful.  I submitted the wine with chicken stock and salted and peppered the filets and had just the right amount of spice for my liking.  This one is a keeper.

Loved it!! I omitted the tomatoes & olives b/c hubby doesn't like them & added the salt/pepper/Italian seasoning as suggested -- this dish is actually quite nice cold too.

Made this the other day and it was fantastic.  I used cod loin instead of fillet so I needed to let it cook a bit longer.  Turned out grate and got rave reviews.

Really good, light recipe... But still very flavorful (just not over powering)... I suggest adding a little salt when sautéing the onion and garlic, just to pull all the flavors together. Also, I added pepper, because I love pepper. And subbed basil for the parsley.

This was great! I loved how quick and easy it was, but still a flavorful and good looking dish! I added a little salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic powder, just to make sure I covered the "fish" taste. And I used tilapia because that's what I had.  My son gave it 11 stars! ;)

Excellent!  This has been a brutal winter and Sundays are usually reserved for grilling.  With over a foot of snow on the deck we have been replacing our Sunday grilled fish with this dish. I must say it does not disappoint!  Using cod and serving this over brown rice, I otherwise stick to the recipe (okay maybe I throw in a few extra olives) and always get rave reviews. Tasty, healthy and perfect for the diet conscious!

PS Use gourmet olives for best results. Kalamata olives are our favorites.

Making it now...  Based on other reviews, I tweeked it a bit by adding about 1/2 tsp Oregano, 1/2 tsp Basil, 1 Tbsp Capers, and 1/4 tsp Red Pepper flakes. No salt needed.  Also, didn't have diced tomatoes so using crushed tomatoes - results in a smoother sauce.  Using cod and serving over Polenta with a side of lightly steamed broccoli.  Delicious!

This dish was wonderful.  I had to make some minor substitutions to use what I had on hand, but it still turned out really well.  It had more sauce than I was expecting, but no complaints.  Husband loved it!

Awesome recipe!  and YES you do need to season this one.  I'm so tired of people saying "OH, it was bland" Hello, if you don't see salt or a seasoning salt listed, it will be bland especially if you use a lot of salt in your diet.  I always salt a little when no salt is listed...

This dish was really fantastic.  I had to use Pollock fillets because it's what I had on hand.  I did take the suggestions of other users and infused some traditional Italian flavor with the addition of oregano and basil.  I think this was a nice touch.  Because it's the new year and I wanted to hit the ground running with this whole dieting thing, I decided not to serve it with rice but instead to add white beans and artichoke hearts and serve it as more of a stew.  Garnish with a little Parmesan cheese and it's over the top.  Thank you for this wonderful rustic Italian recipe!

We really enjoyed this!  I used frozen cod fillets, and since we are a "dry" household, I substituted chicken stock with a splash of cider vinegar for the white wine;  it gave the dish just a slight edge which was very nice.  I doubled the garlic and used dried parsley flakes.  We'll definitely be having this again!  Thanks!!!

We fixed this for dinner last night and everyone enjoyed it! We used tilapia fillets and they worked well with the mildly seasoned tomato and onions. Very tasty dinner (and you can easily tweak the seasonings if you want more of something, but we didn't and liked it as written).

Added a thinly sliced green pepper and some oregano, basil, marojam, and rosemary, subbed stewed tomatos, and subbed ginger ale for the wine.  Also seasoned fillets with a lemon pepper blend before adding to pan.  Served with rice.  Really nice and really easy.  Would love to try again with spinach.

Superb.  I used half of a large onion, substituted half kalamata olives (instead of all black ones), added a Tbsp. of butter along with the oil, and used dry rose wine instead of white.  Also added some freshly ground black pepper. At first I balked at the fact that no additional salt is called for, but this dish does not need it.  The olives and canned tomatoes add plenty of sodium. (I drained my tomatoes, by the way)  Excellent flavors, especially with the subtle sweetness of the cod.  This was phenomenally delicious and we will make it again and again!

Unbelievable flavor and such an EASY weeknight meal!  I used chicken stock (Knorr's) dissolved in 1/2 cup of boiling water in place of the wine- and maybe this is why it was sooo flavorful?  It was not bland at all, as other reviewers have mentioned.  I also added a can of mushrooms and used the Italian diced tomatoes as others have suggested, plus 2 tsp Italian seasoning and a pinch of black pepper.  SUPERB dinner!!! Served over rice. Even my 1 1/2 year old daughter ate every single bit I gave her- fish, black olives and all! This was delicious!

I made a few changes: I omitted the olives (don't like them). I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and dried parsley instead of fresh. And I added Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper and fresh ginger. I served this with rice with some ginger in syrup mixed in. Overall I did enjoy the dish, but without the changes I made, I don't think it would have had enough flavor. I'll probably try some more improvisations next time. But it's definitely a good foundation.

This was absolutely amazing in all aspects.  Easy, delicious, and affordable.  I followed the recipe almost to the letter with the only exception being using feta stuffed green olives because it is what I had on hand.  I will definitely be making this again really soon.  Thanks for sharing.

Good base recipe but kind of bland for my taste. Definitely needs additional seasoning as others have posted.  I also swapped kalamata olives for the plain black olives and used seasoned diced tomatoes.  Oh and also reduced the oil by half.

Five minutes was not long enough to braise the fish. The resulting texture was not to my liking. Flavor was fine, if a bit bland.

I added italian seasonings, salt, pepper and dried parsley (don't have fresh parsley at home) as other reviewers suggested.  It turns out very flavourful from the first time I made this dish which I follow exactly to the recipes.

I encrusted the chicken and excluded the olives. Since I only had red wine vinegar, I substituted that for the dry white wine, decreasing the amount of wine and increasing the amount of olive oil. My husband said it was one of my best meals yet... I guess that means it was better than I even thought!! Great recipe!!!!!

Wonderful!  At the fish market I was torn between getting cod & tilapia (my usual)... but the guy recommended cod saying it was flakier and more delicate and would absorb the flavors more.  I have to agree it was wonderfully moist and flaky... perfect with brown rice.   Definitely adding it to my list of favorite quick & easy meals.  So quick to make and very little fuss/mess.  A keeper!

Yes at last ! I was looking for my grandfathers way of cooking cod besides just fry chunks after breading. This is the exact way and thank you for it has been so long i forgot.

Worked really well with the added crushed red pepper, salt and italian seasonings. Also used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced. Would make this again!

This dish is as tasty as it is easy.  So simple yet so flavorful.  I left out the olives because my husband's not a fan, but it made no difference.  I am actually going to try this with shrimp and scallops over angel hair because the broth would be delicious with pasta. I'm only sorry I didn't have a loaf of crusty bread to soak up every last drop.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Very easy to follow. I have made it twice since I discovered this recipe earlier this month. One warning: Be sure to have a big enough pan, so the fish does not overlap each other. Otherwise, you might end up over-cook the cod.

This was a delicious and healthy recipe.  I used tomatoes that already had basil and garlic in them and also threw in a small summer squash and sauteed it with the onions and garlic.  Yum!

We love this dish and have found it to be one of our favorites.  To reduce calorie count a little more, we dropped the olive oil and substituted a cooking spray; also used some fire roasted garlic diced tomatoes and it tastes great.

This took me by complete surprise.  This was the first dish I cooked featuring seafood of any kind, so I was nervous.  Nonetheless, it came out very good!  
Instead of cod, I used Flounder fillet.  I used green cocktail olives instead of the black ones.  Still came out absolutely divine!  The sauce reduces to an almost buttery-like taste, along with the tomatoes and white wine, this dish is complex in flavor, yet smooth on the tongue.  DELISH!

Definitely making this again!

I loved this recipe! Best fish recipe EVER!!! I did make some changes by adding more spice to the recipe. I seasoned the Cod with fresh thyme, salt and pepper and  I added red pepper flakes to the sauce and I used green spanish olives instead of black olives.  It was not only very tasty but quick and easy. This recipe is a keeper!

Cod is not my favorite kind of fish but this was absolutely delicious! I didn't follow the recipe exactly: I used fresh diced tomatoes, plus a few sun dried; I used green olives instead of black; added some freshly ground black pepper and rosemary. It had a little too much juice, next time I would use a little less wine or drain the tomatoes before adding. Definitely a keeper!

This was fantastic. The whole family enjoyed this recipe. I read some of the reviews and in line I added a little more seasoning simply because we like more seasoning than most. I didn't have a can of regular diced tomatoes so I used Italian diced tomatoes. Other than that, I simply salted and peppered the cod prior to adding to sauce and added a few extra cloves of garlic as well as a little extra oregano. Will become a go-to recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Can't go wrong with onions, garlic, diced tomatoes and white wine! I think the olives and parsley you can substitute with whatever else you have on hand or happen to like, and it'll still taste great. I've used shiitake mushrooms and green onions myself and love it.

I love this! It is so easy and delicious. It's perfect for a fast healthy meal. Over rice is my favorite because it soaks up the juices over the tomato mixture. The first time I made this, I didn't use black olives but I will next time. It looked so good without. I'm sure I'll like it both ways. *update* yes, it's good with olives. I use the Italian diced tomatoes as others suggested and it comes out perfect.

I used green onions, plum tomatoes and  chicken stock  (in place of the wine because that's what I had on hand) Also, added 2 tsp Italian seasoning.  It was was so good, served it alone. Next time I will serve it with a baguette or hard Italian bread.

My family enjoyed this dish and I enjoyed preparing it b/c it was so easy.  I didn't have a few ingredients so I substituted green olives instead of black and chicken stock instead of wine.  I cooked frozen green beans separate and added them to the pan to finish cooking, which picked up the flavors.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

We loved this...must Season the cod with thyme,tarragon, basil or similar. Also topped it with fried sage leaves -yum- served over wild rice. Also a nice side dish I served alongside was sauteed red & yellow peppers, and eggplant. This adds some sweetness since the tomato /olive sauce is salty. Outstanding meal. Very healthy but satisfying! Drink with viognier white wine.

Excellent exactly as listed.
The olives give a tangy flavor, almost too much, but we still enjoyed it. In the future I may use more olives or eliminate entirely.

This recipe worked fantastic with Sea Bass. I had double the fish so I added 14 oz of crushed tomatos.  I also added a half cup of pickled mushrooms that I had on hand a 2 tbsp of capers. The original recipe doesn't mention spices so I added sea salt, freshly ground pepper and a dash of herbes de Provence.  My wife and my guest devoured it.  This recipe is a keeper!

Yummy. I used Tilapia.  I added salt and pepper and red pepper flakes  to the fish. Used chick broth instead of wine.  I also added some anchovy paste to the tomato mixture when i read about it being a tad bland. Used fresh tomato not canned, and kalamata olives.  Add parsley last as fresh herbs loose their flavor if you cook them more then a few minutes.  Served on creamy polenta made with chi broth and topped with a   Little shredded mozzarella. Bon appetite!

Like others I used spices like basil, oregano, sage, and a dash of red pepper.  I also used a whole bulb of garlic b/c we luv it. Used kalamata olives and the fish turned out superb. A great basic recipe to adjust to your taste. Thanks

I like this recipe because it is fresh and healthy. It needs salt though!  Next time I will season the fillets ahead of time with grey sea salt and pepper to add more flavor.

This was great.  I pretty much made it as-is except that I didn't have fresh so I used dried spices, added Italian seasoning since I link canned tomatoes with it, and I used CHICKEN because I felt like having chicken.  I can't really imagine it with fish now that I made it with chicken, but once I figure out what "cod" is in Japanese, I'll try to get some at the grocery store (it can be rough getting even simple ingredients when living in Japan!).  Anyway, GREAT recipe.  Delicious.

We used tilapia, which I partly regret because it fell apart, as well as kalamata olives. It was enjoyable twist on serving fish, my olive hating boyfriend enjoyed it as well (and I got to eat all of his olives, so it worked out better for me).

It was ok.  Just seemed like it was missing something.  It really did not compliment the fish too well.  Tried salt, nope.  Pepper, nope.  Not sure I will make this again.

I prepared exactly except used whole calamata olives.  Might try tomato sauce next time and add sliced mushrooms near the end.  Dish was quick to make, my Italian mom-in-law and DH loved it and no fishy smell in the house.  Most definitely a keeper!!

I made this recipe last night and thought it was great. Healthy, delicious, easy... I did use seasoned canned tomatoes and added salt but those were the only adjustments I made. Next time I think I will skip the wine as I found the recipe did take a while to reduce and maybe add a blend of paprika and chili powder. My husband also seemed to like this dish and he really doesn't like fish.

We have made this a lot, with all different kinds of fish.  It is a very easy dish to make and great flavor, we all love it.  We also add black olives, celery, green peppers and about anything else we can think of.  Makes a great one dish meal.

Whipped up in about 15 minutes using a combination of suggested extras. I used 1/2 cup of corona light instead of wine and I served it over asparagus...the wife (who is not a huge fan of fish unless it is deep fried) really enjoyed it. Will be making again!!

This recipe was excellent! I used what I had on hand and the substitutes were Kalamata olives, Muir Glen Crushed Tomatoes with Basil, a couple pinches of red pepper flakes, a pinch of salt and several twists from the pepper grinder.  Wine was Sauvignon Blanc. The fish, FRESH rockfish.  We loved it and I'm going to serve it again for Christmas Eve dinner.

This recipe really rates 4 1/2 stars.  It's easy, delicious, and inexpensive.  In the midwest, cod is relatively easy to find as a fresh fish in the grocery.  This is a satisfying, no-brainer meal, fast to prepare on a week night.

Very good. I might brown my fish in the olive oil before starting the rest of the recipe. Only because the fish had a boiled texture that I am not fond of. I enjoyed the mediterranean feel to this recipe.

Really quite delicious and easy, with these changes: I did not use olives, but used sliced mushrooms instead (sauteed with onions and garlic), used "italian style" diced tomatoes per others' recommendations, and use chicken broth instead of white wine. Served it over cous cous, which was great!

I have been trying to get my husband to eat more fish, but he insists he hates it.  After this though, I think I may have changed his mind.  I used cod filets and added fresh basil and thyme and also fresh shrimp, served over jasmine rice.  It was wonderful!  Definately a keeper!  Thank you!

This recipe was OK.  It's a good starter but I had to add a lot to it to give it more flavor. I added fresh basil, kosher salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and extra garlic. Served it over wild rice.

This is a very good dish.  Like others, I improvised.  I used Chilean Sea Bass, and because I was making for 5 people, the recipe called for 1 1/4 cans of diced tomatoes.  I wasn't going to do that, so I used 1 can of stewed Italian tomatoes and a 6 oz jar of sun-dried tomatoes, pouring off most of the oil.  I, too, used kalamata olives and I also really browned the onions.  Last, I used a very dry sake in place of the white wine, since, for me, white wine tends to give of a sour taste.  These few changes made the dish incredibly flavorful without any added seasonings, except for a pinch or two of salt.  I served the roquefort pear salad with it and nothing more.  I would definitely make this again.

This was an excellent dish!! After I took the fish out to serve, I threw a bag of shrimp into the pan as well.  Served over brown rice with asparagus!  YUMMY!!

Very good!  Loved the olives in this.  Nice Mediterranean flavor.  I used Rock Cod, served it over rice and it was really good.  Hubby liked it too.  Thanks!

This recipe was quite easy, quick, and tasty.  The olives paired well with the tomatoes and fish.  I'm not a huge fan of fish, and this didn't make me consider eating it more often which is why I can't give it 5 stars....but it was very good.

This was very good. I used the diced tomatoes that were fire roasted with garlic (Hunts) and I used two cans and one cup of wine instead of 1/2 c.  I also used dried parsley and some black pepper. It went over well.

It was ok. We decided not to make it again. Maybe it was us? I served it on fried rice and maybe the combination of the two just wasn't working.? I followed the recipe except I only used 1/4 cup wine and added 1/4 cup broth. (Maybe we should have left the wine out totally - not OUR favorite.) We doubled the garlic & added a touch of cayenne pepper and itailian seasoning.  It should have been good...maybe without the wine?

Loved this.  It was so simple.  I listened to earlier reviewers' suggestions to add salt.  I used sea salt in the pan, and also salted the fillets.  I also listed to the suggestion to add chicken broth and just a splash of white wine.  Finally, for two of my own "twists," I used shallots instead of onion, since I use shallots whenever I can - I just love them.  I also added a pat of butter to the pan while I was waiting for my whole wheat cous cous to be finished.    It was really, really good.

This is sooooo good!  Even my neice who was over and does not like fish gave this a 9 out of 10.  I added oregano, and basil and used kalmata olives.  I have made it with both True Cod and Talapia and both are super good!  I also added scampi the second time, making this dish out of this world!  So easy and so yummy.

We added salt and pepper to taste with some Italian seasoning as well. Added one pound of uncooked, peeled shrimp in the last two minutes of cooking. My husband served it in a bowl with the sauce and extra parsley sprinkled on top. Not only did it look beautiful, but it tasted great! Even my teenagers raved.

I'm not sure if I didn't go something correctly, but I wasn't crazy about this flavor. It was a little bitter and maybe just too acidic from the tomatoes for my tastes. I probably won't make again.

This is a great recipe that you can really do a lot with.  I used tilapia and omitted the olives.  One night added some fresh green beans, another night added a little tomato sauce and topped with a little feta cheese.

This was  hit for sunday dinner. Everyone loved it and I actually liked it too. I bought half freash and half previously frozen filets but no one knew the diferance. They fell apart in the pan like salmon if it's over cooked but it still came out great. I used cooning dry white wine instead of just wine. the cooking wine was on sale. but still came out great. I served it with white rice and brussle sprouts and it was so tastey. I did find a few bones in the fresh fillet but other than that it was spectacular!

I really enjoyed the flavors of this recipe, although I did not like my fish choice.  I used tilapia and a strong "fish" taste slightly overpowered the sauce.  Maybe the tilapia I picked up that day wasn't great, but I will definitely try grouper next time.

Very good premise for a recipe. I took 2 cans diced tomatoes w/ Italian herbs and mixed them with a half container of low-fat pesto. I stirred in some red pepper (to make it spicey) and wilted fresh spinach into the mix. When it was hot, I added tilapia fillets and cooked on medium high for 10 minutes. I served this over whole grain angel hair pasta with a light sprinkling of parmesan, romano and asiago cheeses. Easy, healthy and, above all, yummy!

This was a very easy dish... a great way to incorporate a little fish into your diet!  I followed the recipe very closely, except I omitted the olives and only used about 2/3 lb of cod fillets since there were only two of us.  Very good served over jasmine rice.

Next time, as per my boyfriend's suggestion, I may use crushed tomatoes instead of diced to end up with a smoother texture instead of chunky (I really enjoyed the chunky, though).  The sauce would go great with chicken breasts, too!

This is soooo good! I omitted olives; used frozen tilapia fillets; cooked covered until fish was flaky and then added 1 lb precooked frozen shrimp (thawed and patted dry); cooked another 2 minutes until the shrimp was heated through and served over rice.

Mmmmmmmmmm!  Even my son who doesn't eat onions, olives, or mushrooms cleaned it up.  I kept really close to the recipe but used the Tilapia I had on hand.  Also, put in some sliced baby port mushrooms with the onions.  Seasoned it up a bit kosher salt, black pepper, extra garlic, and basil.  After adding the tomatoes, be sure to cook the sauce mixture down until it's no longer watery for a good consitency as some canned tomatoes have a higher liquid content.  
Without a doubt, one of my new favorites.  Thanks!

Great recipe- I'm not a big fish eater and thought it was delicious.  We used green olives instead of black olives, and hake instead of cod but otherwise followed the recipe.  The fish was moist and the sauce was just the right amount(after letting some of the excess tomato juice simmer and evaporate).  Highly recommended!

This was very good. I used tilapia instead, left out the olives and I served over white rice. If you like cilantro and use it a lot in your household like I do then you could also use that instead of the parsley. It's delicious!

My wife and I was craving for something new.  We had some cod fillets and did not know how to cook it.  I searched on net and found this site.  Wanted to surprise her and found this recipe.  It was quick and easy.  It was like we were eating at a 5-Star resturant.  We will now start using this site more often.  Whoever came up with this recipe, Thank you.  Keep up the good work.

I really liked the flavor of this recipe and it was so easy. It reminded me of an excellent lobster dish I had once. I'll have to try it with lobster some time. I used red wine instead of white. The sauce ended up a little too liquidy for me. Next time I'll use fresh tomatoes or 2 cans of canned tomatoes drained. Red onions would probably be really good instead of white.

Very tasty. I am used to eating seafood cooked like this, this dish is common in coastal cities in Brazil. Fixed it with rice for my parents, they approved it, it was a light and healthy meal. Used frozen cod fillets, took about 10 minutes to cook. And there is liquid left over, so you probably want to let the tomatoes mix evaporate a lit bit longer. But don't mess with the fish or overcook it or they will break apart. Also, I used dried parsley cause I didn't have fresh, and it tasted just like fresh.

Very easy and quick.  Added some parmensan cheese and lemon pepper to the mix as it simmered. Near the end, added a few shrimp. Served over a bed of parmesan rice with lemon and sprigs of parsely as a garnish.  A very pleasing dish, and very enjoyable.  Will definitely serve to guests.

Omitted olives as none of us like olives.  Used Tilapia Fillets, and seasoned sauce before adding the fish.  Most importantly, my two kids (2 & 5) ate it.

This was a simple and delicious dish!  I used two 7 ounce salmon fillets and cooked them about 5 minutes per side.  Chenin Blanc worked wonderfully.  If you don't like a watery sauce you should drain the diced tomatoes before use but it's good either way.

I think what I liked most about this recipe is how easy and fast it was.  I was also able to pause cooking at the point the fish is added until we were actually ready to sit down and eat.  

It really is full of flavor.  I did take others advice and step up the seasoning a bit and it turned out fantastic.  

I think it could also be easily adapted to a Mediteranian dish with green olives and perhaps some capers.  I will try to do this next time.

Yes, I will make it again.  I added some extra spices to the garlic, onions, sliced black olive in a can, and parsley.  What did I add.  To begin I used half 100 butter and olive oil mixed.  I added small amounts of oregano and thyme (small amount because they can overpower the other spices), and rosemary.  Salt and pepper should also added while it is cooking.   It turned out to be a delicious sauce for my fish fillets.

I made this and my family thought it was delicious. I used a pound each of cod and tilapia fillets, and, like other reviewers, I spiced it up with salt, freshly ground pepper, oregano, and just a dash of cayenne on the fillets. This gave the dish a nice color and a little heat. Great dinner served with rice, steamed green beans, and sautéed zucchini with sweet peppers.

So easy and really healthy. You can vary it a lot, too. We added in more herbs and Mexican spices to give it a kick, and we used fresh tomatoes (blanched and peeled) instead of canned ones.

Love this recipe. I did make a few minor changes. I sub out the sherry for white wine or vegetable broth. Which ever one I have on hand. I use tilapia instead of cod. Super good every time I make it.

My whole family of 8 loved this recipe we will definitely make it again we didn't have enough black olives to make enough as we had to use two pans to make enough for our family so we used green olives for the other batch and it was equally good just don't use as much salt if you're using green olives but otherwise we did the recipe exactly and it turned out great

Wonderful!  I made it with cod and Kalamata olives.  Used chicken stock instead white wine. Added some vinegar because it was kinda sweet.  But it’s yummy!  Will definitely make again.

Good, easy recipe but needs a little extra flavor. I'll definitely make this again but would improve it by marinating the fish in lemon juice beforehand, maybe a pinch of cayenne or perhaps diced tomatoes with green chili.

Loved the acidity from the tomatoes to give flavor to the fish but needed more seasoning like salt..otherwise it was OK.

It was okay----more healthy than frying.   Might make it again, but we like the crunchy fish made with panko crumbs.

This was very good, quick and easy.  Used fresh tomatoes, added celery and a teaspoon of Italian seasoning but didn't have white wine so I used another liquid.  I also used swai fillets and they cooked easily in the pan with the lid. The olives were a nice touch.

5 stars, with changes I made, many suggested by other reviewers.  Added fresh herbs to the onion/garlic/tomato mixture:  1 Tbsp parsley, 1 Tbsp basil, 1 tsp thyme, 1 tsp oregano; salt and pepper, and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  Used one 15 oz can of chicken broth, plus 2 Tbsp cooking sherry, instead of white wine.  Simmered this mixture for about 40 minutes to thicken and blend flavors, then refrigerated until my guests arrived a couple of hours later, and then put the tomato mixture back on the stove.  I seasoned the 4 cod filets on one side only with salt and 1/4 tsp dried oregano, and seasoned 1/2 lb raw shrimp with 1/4 tsp EVOO, 1/4 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp dried oregano.  I placed the cod in the pan and nestled it into the tomato mixture, and simmered, covered, about 5 minutes.  Then I added the shrimp and cooked until opaque.  Served over jasmine rice, with a side of corn on the cob.  Very Easy, and Absolutely Delicious!

Perfect in every way.  I used a can of stewed tomatoes because I like the taste and it was perfect.  My husband loved it a lot and so did I.

Used talapia, all I had, will plan ahead & do cod next time. Did as other viewer, who used talapia, used italian diced tomatoes & Italian  seasoning. Had to flip since my guys (Southern) won't eat anything not browned on both sides! My only problem was I didn't serve bread with it...Heaven help me! They had nothing to sop up the juices with! They !ant again!

I added fresh Roma tomatoes and Italian herb mix but would likely use just oregano and basil.  I didn't particularly like the after notes of thyme.   I also added shrimps as other reviewer noted.  Overall very tasty dish.  Thank you!!

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe except for the onion. I had no onion.  My girls 5 & 7 ate it all up.  My youngest even asked for more.  Unusual for her, as she is my picky eater.

Quite tasty!  It did seem a little bland to me, so I added some additional Italian seasoning and a bunch of capers, which really added some brightness to it.  I used some thin pollack filets, which fell apart, but I was fine with that - wasn't the prettiest dish, but it tasted good!

I agree with another reviewer.  The recipe was a good base, but bland.  I added oregano, basil, more garlic and a small amount of crushed red pepper.  It turned out flavorful, but not spicy.  Sorry.

Very tasty and simple. I used fresh basil instead of parsley and omitted olives, since I hate them. Used diced tomatoes with garlic and basil as well. Had Sea Bass and it was delish.  Yes, add salt and pepper.

Only change I made was I substituted kaalmata olives for black olives.  We really liked this recipe.  My husband said, "we'll have that again."  Next time I am going to add the Good Seasons Italian dressing and maybe some mushrooms.

We used cod, and it's not at all bland if you use seasoned tomatoes (Italian is an obvious choice) and kalamata olives.

Tried it initially with cod and it was pretty great. I'd never cooked fish before though so I ended up slightly overcooking the cod. It was still good though a little tougher than I anticipated. I just made the same base again tonight only, instead of fish, I tossed in some large shrimp, peeled and de-veined, and put it on over pasta. Fan-freakin-tastic. The only thing that might've improved it was a very light dusting of some freshly grated parm.  I can't wait to make this again!

Absolutely fabulous and healthy dish.  Always use greek/calamata olives, gives it so much more flavor, and an extra can of tomatoes for sauce for rice..  Highly recommend.

I used 1 lb of rock cod filets (2 filets) a can of organic crushed tomatoes with basil, added a hefty bunch of roughly chopped arugula from my garden, didn't have white wine so used red, added a teaspoon of spanish sweet paprika, a few branches of fresh thyme, and the olives  were pitted kalamatas. My fish hating fiance loved it! Served over rice with steamed artichokes on the side. Yum.

This was quite delicious. I used frozen cod fillets. I made the sauce pretty much as described except with green olives instead of black and added 1 tsp. Italian seasoning. Can't quite understand how anyone would find this "bland".

So tasty!  Made some with fresh cod as well as frozen.  Fresh was way better.  Adding kalamata olives adds a lot more flavor than plain black olives.  Also added a sprinkling of feta.

We really liked this alot! I left out the olives because we don't care for them.I added some chopped red peppers and mushrooms and then put parmasan cheese over all. Very Good!

Loved this dish. I have looked at this recipe for a year and did not until now. My mistake. We eat a lot of cod and this is in my top 2.

My husband liked this dish, but I felt it needed something more. I served it over gluten free penne noodles. It was a light dish, which I liked, but it just needs a bit more flavor to make this a meal I would cook againt.

My daughter is not a fan of fish, but she asks for this meal now after eating it.  So tasty!  I serve with white rice.  Healthy, too.  Didn't change a thing.

Delicious and super easy. Cooking the onions to the point where they start to caramelize adds really good flavor.

So easy and fast and delicious.  Hubs loved this.  I sprayed the pan with Pam instead of using olive oil.  I omitted the olives (don't like them) and used a 10 oz can of Rotel tomatoes as that is what I had.  I added about 1/4 cup tomato paste to make up for the tomatoes I didn't have.  Since other reviews mention a bland flavor I went ahead and added a packet of Good Sense Italian dressing mix along with dried parsley.  Used chicken broth instead of wine and sprinkled parmesean cheese over each serving.  It actually turned out a bit spicy for the kids- the Rotel did it I think- but the adults thought it was awesome.  Used cod that I mostly thawed in cold water 1st and they took about 10 minutes in the simmering sauce.

After reading the reviews, I noted that many people found it bland and suggested a host of additional seasonings to make it work. I did so, and still found it very bland. It doesn't taste bad, but it certainly isn't a memorable dish.

We have been trying to eat more fish and this is one of the best recipes I have found.  I used cod pieces to save some money and got a little over 1 lb. for under $5 and it still turned out very good!  I also added some capers.

Turned out pretty good, although because all the previous reviews mentioned it lacked seasoning...I seasoned my fish with Adobo, and Sazón before putting it in with all the rest of the ingredients. It turned out tasting good but might add a bit a salt too next time...Can't imagine what it would've tasted like without what I put though as far as seasonings!

Fun, easy recipe. Colorful and healthy. I felt it needed a little more flavor. We tried it again tonight and it was a big hit. Still could use a little more flavor. But we will definitely enjoy it again.

PRETTY good!  Not phenomenal.  It was plenty salty for me without any added salt as others suggested.  I'm not sure why as my chopped tomatoes say no salt added.  I did add some pepper and crushed red pepper flakes, as suggested.  Very easy and fast!

This was a healthy meal that tasted great.  It definitely needed some extra spices.  Based on previous reviews I added salt and pepper.  I didn't have Italian seasoning so I just added some basil (we were also out of oregano).
I would definitely make this again.

I have to admit that I didn't stick with the recipe on this one. I used Italian style tomatoes, dry oregano, and a pinch of cayenne. When I served the fish I topped each fillet with some of the sauce and some Parmesan cheese.

Superb recipe - I added some fresh herbs (rosemary and oregano) and did thicken the sauce with some tomato paste.  Everyone in my household loved this dish (even those who say they don't care for fish)!  Also shared with a colleague and she had great results as well. 

Recommended!

Tried this with tilapia, fresh tomatoes, fresh parsley, fresh basil without olives, the rest of the listed ingredients, and this was a hit!  Served over rice pilaf, made it wonderful. Even my 6 year old who doesn't eat fish, scooped it up! Yum yum and thanks for quick easy and delicious!

Great dish for when you have a fish fillet and not sure what to do with it.
I have used my imagination with this dish and added more herbs such as fresh tarragon and rosemary and I've added sliced baby portobella mushrooms. 
I would strongly recommend to use freshly cut tomatoes and not the canned type as the taste is so much better.

I was skeptical about fish and Italian but this dish was really good. I changed a few things. I used tilapia instead of cod and I used 1/2 cup chicken stock instead of wine plus 1/8 cup of cooking white wine. I also doubled the garlic and sprinkled each piece of fish with garlic powder. I also used basil/oregano diced tomatoes for more flavor and I served this over angel hair pasta sprinkled with olive oil and fresh grated Parmesan. 
I would definitely make this dish again! My husband who does not tilapia, loved it!

This recipe is a good base, but it needs tweaks to be flavourful. I used more garlic and parsley, chicken bouillon cube + water instead of the wine (didn't have any, but would definitely use it next time) and basa fillets instead of the cod (they were on sale). The result was relatively bland and soup-y, so I dissolved some cornstarch in water to make a paste to help thicken the dish. I also added about half a cup of Parmesan cheese and some Italian seasoning. I also used about two teaspoons of sweet bell pepper paste to get some of the red colour back (cornstarch and parm made the sauce very light coloured). This could definitely use a little heat as well. I would reduce some of the liquid next time (maybe use only some of the liquid from the diced tomatoes). Served this with 'Company Couscous' from AR.

Very good & easy & healthy. David really enjoyed even thou he isn't crazy for cod. He suggested this could be made with salmon. I think it'd be good with tilapia or shrimp.

Super easy, fast and good for those frozen fish fillets stuck in the back of my freezer. I love olives, so used really flavorful Greek olives. Also added oregano, salt & loads of pepper.  I cooked the onions for a good 15 minutes before adding the garlic. No wine on hand, so just used a little water. Turned out perfect!

This was perfect! I changed nothing except that I added some seasoning (salt, pepper, oregano). This was the first time I've ever made fish non-fried, and it turned out great.

Loved this recipe, has become one of my favorite go-to recipes. I also substituted Tilapia one time  as one of the other reviewers had, and a fish called Swai fish, which is another delicate white fish.  Both substituted really well in this dish. I make couscous which is quick and easy, and put that on the plate first then add the juices from this along with the fish itself on top, and it makes a really good meal. I want to thank Bonnie for creating this wonderful recipe!

All I had on hand is wahoo...which I don't care for, in fact, I'm not crazy about fish but had two for supper who were.  I have to admit this is quite edible and my quests loved it.  Served it over vermicelli and there were no leftovers!  Good recipe, Bonnie!

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish.  I didn't have the black olives.  I used 1/2 cup fresh parsley and used a garlic press to get the most flavor out of the garlic.  I added fresh ground pepper.  I served it over short grain brown rice.

I caught ling cod in Alaska and cooked it for my  family tonight.  They LOVED it.  Gave this recipe four stars only because I addded extra seasoning after readng reviews.  I seasoned the fish with salt, pepper, adobo and italian seasoning and added extra seasoning to tomato mixture.   I served it with chicken and broccoli rice and asparagus.  Yummy.

I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because I took other reviewers' advice and added additional seasoning. This would have been way too bland as-is. That said, the recipe is wonderful and the meal was delicious - even my 2 toddlers enjoyed it. I used diced fresh tomatoes because I had them. I also used some italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Next time I will try kalamata olives and some spice variation. This is one I will be making again.

I liked this recipe. My husband hated it because he said it didn't even taste like fish. I think he missed the point. Anyways, I think I would like to add a little bit more fish next time and half the topping (although the topping was the best part.) Served with rice and mixed veggies.

This was very good.  I have been using alot of baked fish recipes, because my stovetop wasnt in yet, and I have been disappointed.  However now that my stove is in, this is the first main dish I have fixed and it was excellent.  Very flavorful, very moist.  Thank you for sharing.

OMG this recipe was so easy and full of flavorl! I only substituted the cod fillets for tilapia fillets, added one tablespoon of tomato sauce for a little bit of thickness and a pinch of sazon with food coloring. I served over white rice and it was a heat, everyone loves it!  Thank you!!

This is very quick, simple, and delicious!  I didn't have any olives and it was still delish.  I added mushrooms, a can of fire roasted tomatoes, a pinch of italian seasoning, and some diced tomatoes.  Also, I used pasta instead of rice and it was perfect!  I think this would go well with just about any fish or meat.  Great recipe...thank you for sharing!  This a keeper!

We loved this recipe! Since my husband and I are not wine drinkers, I just substituted the wine with white grape juice. Instead of canned diced tomatoes, I used fresh tomatoes, diced and seasoned with salt and Italian seasoning. I also didn't have cod fish in my fridge so I used white river cobbler. I'm sure the cod fish would be tastier as the river cobbler is bland. Thanks for this recipe!

Amazing! Made with cod, used some italian seasonings and served over brown rice. Mine fell apart some, but as long as you don't use too much liquid it's not a problem.

healthy (with a little quality fat).  quick for a weeknight dinner.  a little more salt would have made it a 5, but definitely a repeatable meal.

This was absolutely delicious and so quick and easy to make. My family loved it, and they all wanted the recipe. I used chicken stock instead of wine(did not have it on hand) and it still came out great! I served the dish over white rice. EXCELLENT!

Very easy. Very tasty. I added the salt, pepper and italian seasoning as others suggested. I served over brown rice. My family really enjoyed this. This one is definitely a keeper and I will make regularly. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent. I used fresh cod fillet and probably a lot more parsley than called for but man was it good. Served over Israeli couscous that I cooked in herb boullion.

I specifically chose this recipe because I don't like fish.  It worked pretty well and I did like it!  I used spicy canned tomatoes and doubled the garlic :)

Very flavorful, light, and quick & easy to make.  I used 2 pounds of whiting fillets, so I more or less doubled the recipe and used my electric skillet.  I used 4 Tbsp. of olive oil, 2 cans of tomatoes, 4 cloves of garlic, and 2 teaspoons of dried parsley flakes.  I also used a cup of chicken broth in place of the wine, and sliced up one large white onion.  I only had one small can of sliced olives on hand, but that was plenty.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added a tsp. of salt, 1/2 tsp. of pepper, and 4 tsps. of Italian seasoning.  Served over rice as suggested.  Excellent!

Very good, but I did make a couple of changes.  I used 4 cloves of garlic, Italian stewed tomatoes, added extra basil and oregano, didn't add the olives but added a few chopped capers instead.  Then I used my stick blender and made it a smooth sauce and with those changes it was really nice!  My husband loved it and so that makes this a winner!

OMGoodness, this was absolutely the best. I am not a cod fish lover, my husband is, but after trying this recipe I am hooked.  I did use the canned tomatoes with the garlic and oregano only because they are the ones I prefer. Thank you, Bonnie for making me a cod fish lover, my husband thanks you also. He said "you could make this every night".

I did the exact recipe. It was very good and my family had enjoyed it. I will try to add more flavour next time, but in my opinion the olives and the fresh parsley are enough for this food. Maybe if I wouldn't add the olives it would need more spices.

This recipe was awesome after I did what many others have done. Spiced it up. I added 1/2 tsp Italian spices, omitted the black olives, sprinkled flour to thicken sauce(great!) , sprinkled ground red pepper. After everything was sauteed I placed half the "sauce" on bottom of 13x9 dish, placed fillets in dish and spread the rest of the "sauce" over top of the fish. I baked the dish at 375 for roughly 15 minutes. When finished I thinkened up sauce a little more and served over rice. My kids LOVED it. I put a little Parmesan cheese over top and WOW! All I heard while eating was how good it was and if there was anymore. We will definitely make this again. I think it was be great with shrimp too. I usually use these as base recipes and doctor them up. This is an excellent base recipe. A must make dish!

We don't like olives, so I skipped that part and used "fire roasted" diced tomatoes instead of regular.  Added some S&P and a little extra garlic and it was GREAT.  Easy, quick and tasty - I'll definitely make this one again!

Yeah, would have to give this a five.  I'm not a huge fish person and have never cooked fillets this way (almost poaching them in liquid as opposed to pan-frying, grilling or baking) and my expectations were not only met but exceeded.  I used cod fillets that were on the thick side so I ended up cooking them about ten minutes as opposed to the five minutes suggested in the recipe.  Like other reviewers I used chicken broth instead of the white wine but I made sure to use a reduced-sodium broth - likewise with the diced tomatoes - no salt added for those.  I kept everything relatively salt free because I used brined kalamata olives (the kind you get at the olive bar at the grocery store) and they really pack a salty punch.  I also added an extra clove of garlic and dried Italian seasoning to kick up the flavor.  A very tasty, relatively healthy & inexpensive dish!  Thanks!

A great recipe for any time of year! I made this and forgot the white wine, and added some general Italian seasoning and everyone -- including my husband who doesn't like seafood -- enjoyed it. I served it over couscous which helped sop up the juices!

I made this tonight, and loved it!  For those who don't like olives, I would suggest processing them with a few capers (6-8) in the food processor until finely chopped.  When added to the sauce they disappear, but give the sauce a delightful flavor!  My husband doesn't like capers and I don't like olives, but this way only the flavor remains.  I used pimiento-stuffed green olives.

Something was wrong with this recipe. I followed it to the letter and my husband left most of it on his plate, and with me a vegan, I cook meat and fish for his enjoyment. I think I'll try it again but spice it up with salsa in lieu of tomotoes, and as the others suggest, more spices. It seemed to bland as is.

I think as written, I'd rate this 4 stars.  It's a great starting point to add and tweak to your palate.

This has become a favorite on my house with the following changes: Add 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning and a pinch of dill. I reduce the wine to 1/4 cup and add 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I sprinkle garlic salt on the fish and bake @ 375 (for 5-10 minutes depending on thickness). Pour sauce over fish and  rice with a wedge of lemon.  Yummy!

YUMMY!  This dish is so tasty even non-fish lovers will like it!  :)  Based on some others' suggestions, I added some chopped fresh mushrooms to the mix, and sprinkled some Italian seasoning and parmesean cheese to the pan as the fish simmered.  Thanks Bonnie for a yummy recipe!

Awesome recipe.  I used sole fillets and kalamata olives, and then added some additional seasoning to suit our tastes (sea salt, ground pepper, fresh basil and italian seasoning).  Thanks for the great recipe.

Easy, healthy, and delicious! I used a red onion and chicken broth, and instead of just parsley I used an Italian Seasoning blend I made myself (a lot of it). I don't think I would have liked it as much had it not been for the additional spices. I also omitted the olives, just because I don't like them. A good base recipe you can play with to suit your tastes. My family and I have never been big fans of Italian seafood, but we loved this!

We just made this for dinner. It was a change from the usual fish dinner. My husband and I both wonder if it wouldn't better if the fish was breaded and/or fried first for a crispy texture. My husband doesn't care for rice so we used egg noodles. It was a quick and healthy meal enjoyed by us both.

Tried it just now and was excellent. Used fresh tomatoes, chicken stock, tomato sauce and puree as we did not have at home all the ingredients in the recipe. Definitely, will consider on every rushed dinner that includes fish.

Yummy! Only change was the addition of Italian Seasoning mentioned by other reviewers.  Served it over brown rice.  Healthy comfort food.

I used tilapia with brown rice for this and it turned out great. Everyone in my family who doesn't hate fish said it tasted like something you'd get at a restaurant. It was a very unique and refreshing way to serve fish as well as very easy to prepare.

This dish really deserves a 4 1/2* it is that good and so easy to prepare.  I did feel it needed a little something so I added about 1tbs of mixed herb blend by McCormick (a paste you can find in the spice section) and some fresh ground pepper.  Perfect! Will make again and experiment with other firm fish.

I really was very leery of cod and figured this recipe would not be as good as the 5 stars so I went into it with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I do Weight Watchers and this is a perfect, healthy dinner and low in Points. :)

It was terrific! I just had a second helping. I did as another reviewer suggested and made sauteed fresh spinach and served it over whole wheat couscous. I made it as written and then added kosher salt, cracked pepper, Italian seasoning and my canned tomatoes had chopped jalepenos. Delicious!

I used 1/2 the fish(since my boys and I were the only ones eating) but still used all the veggies.  I served the extra veggies over boiled potatoes. YUM!  I do agree with other reviewers this does need salt and pepper.  I had to add some while eating.  I will definitely keep this recipe and try it on my hubby!

Excellent.  Used a beautiful piece of Haddock that was so sweet and not overwhelmed by the sauce.  Only used 1/4 cup of olives which were plenty.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good. I took the advice of others
that posted and added italian seasoning,
salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and anchovy paste. Next time, I'll simmer it
to the point where most of the liquid is
asorbed to intensify the flavors, which 
will improve the dish.

Unfortunately, my family and I did not care for this.  This was very dissapointing, especially since there were so many positive reviews.  The presentation looked great but the fillets were very bland to us.  I even added an extra clove of garlic and can of diced tomatoes.  Maybe the fillets needed to marinate in something for a bit of time?  It seemed like a very healthy dish so I was happy about that.  It wasn't a complete waste, especially when the fillets were $15 a pound!

It was wonderful!! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added mushrooms and italian spices. I used red snapper fish and it was delicious. Right before serving, I sprinkled some fresh grated parmesean cheese. When re-heated, it tastes just as good as last night. This will be be added to the dinner rotation.

I served this as a soup with a side salad & garlic bread.  It was a hit for the family.  It could've used more flavor, but was still good & extremely easy with little clean up.  I did use half green & half black olives which I liked.  Next time I'll play with it a little more.

A simple and very nice way to prepare white fish.  I used Red Snapper which worked well.  I also used Kalamata Olives which we love and added some fresh mushrooms and Italian Seasoning. Thanks for the great recipe.

YUM! My hubby and I both love this recipe. We used tilapia, added 3 garlic cloves, Italian blend tomatoes, and salt and pepper. Great flavor! Served w/steamed broc, couscous (sp), and breadsticks. Delish!!! I'm a minimalist, and considered this recipe quite low-maintenance.

Tastes great.  Looks wonderful.  I added salt, pepper and italian seasoning.  Also I served it with fresh grated parmesan cheese.  My 13 year-old daughter said it was
something they could serve at a restaurant.  My 15 year-old son said "It's a Keeper"!

I was nervous while preparing this because all I could smell was the wine, but it turned out great.  Nice chunky sauce.  Pretty presentation.  I served this with white rice and steamed broccoli.

I thought this recipe turned out very well.  I had to do some slight modificaions because I didn't have some of the ingredients i.e., sub red for white wine, added mushrooms and used an italian flavored tomatoe product.  My husband really liked it and since I HATE fish, I liked the idea of "masking" the fish.  I actually thought it was very good.  Nice alternative for the Lenten season.

I made this tonight and it was a family hit. Very easy to make. I used flounder. I think next time I may try baking it in the oven and also add a bit of salt and pepper to it. I braised it stove-top ,it fell apart. Served it with couscous, steamed broccoli and balsamic beefsteak tomatoes. A healthy, tastey dish.

This was OK but had no kick.  I did substitute orange roughy, omitted the olives, & used fresh tomatoes.  Maybe adding some feta would help...
