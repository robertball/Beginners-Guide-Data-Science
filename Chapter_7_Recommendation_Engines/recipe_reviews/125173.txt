Delicious and very easy!  I did make some changes.  Living in Wisconsin, we have access to a huge variety of cheeses;  I substituted Asiago with Red Pepper for the cheddar, and I used cubes of it rather than shredded, because we like the pockets of warm, gooey cheese in the bread--used about a cup and a half of cubed cheese.  I used the dough hook of my mixer to incorporate the flour, and it worked great.  I also omitted the pepper from this batch.  I did not divide the dough in half, I just spooned it into the loaf pan.  It took about 2 hours for my dough to fully rise, and I drizzled a little melted butter on the top before baking. It made one perfect loaf of bread that we devoured warm from the oven!  My mind is already racing with the possibilities this recipe has....

I did let my egg and sour cream come to room temperature before making this recipe. I proofed the yeast in the bowl of my Kitchen Aid with the water and sugar for ten minutes, then added the sour cream and egg, then the dry ingredients. I did need a just a little more than 1/4 of a cup more flour than the recipe called for to get it to form into a ball (I didn't want to add too much flour) and jump on the hook, even then, it was a VERY moist dough. I kneaded the dough with the dough hook for five minutes. I then set the dough to rise on a warm heating pad for an hour in a covered, greased bowl. This dough did not want to rise. At all. I decided to make rolls out of the dough instead of dividing it and baking it in a loaf pan. I used my dry 1/4 cup measuring cup to get even sized rolls. I was able to get eleven medium sized rolls out of one recipe. I set the rolls in the muffin tin to rise again on the warm heating pad for another 45 minutes and this time, they did rise......slightly. I baked these rolls at 400* for 12 minutes. Right out of the oven, I brushed each hot roll with warm melted butter. For me, I was not impressed with this recipe. The dough came together easily but was more of a "batter" bread than a true yeast dough. And the sour cream overpowers every other flavor in this bread. I think it might have been better had it been half sour cream and another wet ingredient. The "peppery" part of this recipe is not very prominent, either. Fair recipe, but not a favorite

I found this recipe after trying a "Quick Cheese Bread" recipe found in a leading cooking magazine. The lack of yeast in that dough made for a too dense loaf. This one however, is the perfect balance of airy bread and gooey cheese. Definitely cube the cheese, and I found that mixing the cheese cubes into the dry ingredients to coat them in flour before adding the wet ingredients made for easy mixing. I also borrowed from the Quick Cheese Bread recipe, sprinkling parmesan in the bottom of the pan and on top of the loaf before baking -it makes a great crust. I found that a bake time of 30 minutes was perfect for the 4 mini loaves I divided this recipe into. Perfect for gift giving!

this is hard to rate, made as written -the recipe would take a long time to rise in my experience with yeast breads. The ingredients and flavour are great, I mixed the egg and sour cream together and placed in a dish of hot water to warm them to room temp. I add the salt after half the flour has been mixed in, and had to add an extra 1/2 cup or so of flour. I baked this in a high sided pie plate to make a round loaf of bread filled with cheese. The taste is great, the directions (which I rarely read and follow unless trying a recipe for recipe group) needed some tweaking.

Prepared for the Recipe Group. Hubby and son really liked this. My daughter and I like a lighter texture. I let the sour cream and egg sit at room temp for approx. 1 hr before proceeding. Proofed the yeast in 110* water and the sugar for 10 min. I followed others suggestions and used approx. 1 1/2 cups cubed (small) cheese (1 cup sharp cheddar and 1/2 cup colby jack). Hubby loves black pepper so I used a heaping 1/2 teasp. I also added about 1 1/2 TBS snipped chives to the batter. It took 1 1/4 hours for the dough to double in a 9 x 5 glass loaf pan and was perfectly done at exactly 35 minutes. Very tasty and filling. Definately better if served warm from the oven or warmed up the next day. I will make this again for the ones in my family that really liked it. Thanks for sharing!

Made for Recipe Group... I think I HAVE to give this five stars... the loaf came out of the pan at 2:31 p.m. It's now 2:47 and it's GONE. To say my family liked it would be an understatement. I liked it too, really nice taste and a good texture - I thought no kneading might make it too dense for me, but it wasn't. That said though, there were a few little comments I had on the recipe. "Dough will be sticky" in the directions made me expect that it would be a loose dough and mine wasn't really. I had a bit of a hard time "folding in" the cheese (which I cut in small cubes like most of the other reviewers) and pepper, so it didn't disperse throughout the loaf as much as I hoped. The cheese was mostly around the edges with just a few cubes here and there in the middle, and the pepper was in small deposits through the loaf. I think I would have prefered adding the pepper with the sour cream and sugar and stuff, to better mix it in. I didn't divide the dough, there's really no need. It took about 1.5 hours to rise, and I baked 30 mins. I would definitely make this again and recommend it!

Made this for the *RECIPE GROUP* I didn't like it very much. Thought it was guite boring. If I made it again I would change it up by using more cheese (maybe a different type?) and maybe putting grated parm. on top, but as is I didn't like it. Mine also came out quite dense.

RECIPE GROUP~ I made one loaf in a loaf pan and was surprised at how well it rose. The flavor is pretty good and it has a nice texture. It is reminiscent of a batter roll recipe I grew up on. My mom made the rolls in muffin tins and would add different things for flavor probably depending on what she was serving. Sometimes she added cottage cheese and chives other times it was sharp cheddar and dill weed. I am gonna play around with this next time.  It's nice to not total my kitchen counter with flour for kneading and still be able to make a yeast bread to go with a meal.
UPDATE: The morning after I made this, the bread was still tender, didn't crumble when I sliced it,and my husband said the cheese flavor was stronger. I decided to give a full 5 stars instead of the 4 rating I had first given this recipe.

I doubled this recipe to make two loaves. I also used cubed (small) extra sharp Cheddar cheese (16 oz) instead of shredded. I mixed the cheese and pepper with the flour to make mixing easier; next time I will mix in the pepper with the main ingredients before adding the flour and cheese. I'll also make three 8x4 loaves instead of two. I dusted the pans with Parmesan cheese on all sides as well as sprinkled Parmesan on the top of the loaves. Allowed 2 hours for the rise.  One note: the middle may not be done even if the crust looks done. However, I'll be making this bread again and be prepared it goes fast:)

This bread is DELICIOUS!  Moist, cheesy and airy.  I also used a cup and a half of small cheese cubes instead of shredded for the gooey cheese bites.  I did not divide the dough and it had to rise about 2 and a half hours.  The only problem I had was that the outside of the bread wanted to stick to the pan because of the cheese chunks and the whole middle came out.  We couldn't slice this bread but just dug-in instead and ate it straight from the oven.  Thank you for this recipe-the whole family gobbled it up!

RECIPE GROUP -- I brought all the ingredients to room temperature and I did cube 1 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese.  Not sure about the directions to devide in 1/2, but I just plopped the whole thing into a sprayed silicone bread pan.  Let raise for about 1 hour and then baked.  Yummy pockets of cheese and no kneading!  The yeast was perftect in this bread.  Thanks for the Recipe Sue!

I made this recipe with cubes of pepper jack cheese and added fresh rosemary and chopped garlic.  It's delicious and decadent!    I think that the slow rising time is due to the cold sour cream and egg that are added to the yeast.  If the sour cream is warmed up before adding it should speed up the rising time.  I wouldn't heat the egg though b/c that would cook it.

I made this yesterday for RECIPE GROUP.  I am not a bread baker and never have been.  Somehow that has escaped me all these years.  But, this looked interesting, so I thought I’d give it a go.  I followed the recipe, but used seasoned pepper and increased the amount to 2 teaspoons.  I made sure all my ingredients were at room temperature before I began, and once the dough had come together I did not divide it as indicated in the recipe.  I put it all in an 8x4" loaf pan and it rose beautifully in 90 minutes.  I baked mine for the full 40 minutes, but should have taken it out at 35, as the top of mine browned just a wee bit too much.  This was fun to try and we enjoyed it.  It may have even convinced me to try other yeast breads!  Four stars due to the confusion about dividing the dough.

This bread was very good and very easy for an inexperienced yeast-using-bread-baker like myself.  My only issue with the directions is that it says to split the dough.  But for the pan size it says to use this recipe would not adequately fill 2 of those pans.  I ended up putting all the dough in one pan (on advice from the Recipe Buzzers, TY!) and it worked out great.  While I was mixing, I put a pot of water on to boil, turned it off and put my dough on a wire rack over the hot pot of water.  It rose beautifully.  I'm going to make this again, but for me, it needs more pepper and cheese to earn it's name.  I might also add garlic or rosemary next time.  Good recipe which will be great with some modifications.  Thanks for sharing Sue!

Did not follow the directions as written on this recipe.  Quite frankly, as they are written, they are questionable.   Allowed the egg and sour cream to come to room temperature.  Combined the yeast, sugar and water and allowed this to sit until the yeast foamed (about 2 minutes), added the egg, salt and 2/3 cup of the flour to the yeast mixture.  Mixed together and added remainder of flour. Gently folded in 1 1/4 cups of shredded Cheddar cheese.  This is a very sticky dough.  Greased the insides of six (15 oz.) cans and filled them half full with the dough, placed inside microwave with the surface light on, covered with a cloth and allowed to rise for an hour.  Baked for 22 minutes, allowed to cool and gently removed. This made six of the cutest, moist and aromatic, round loaves.  Can't decide if the sour cream is overpowering the yeast taste - this just has a different taste from the yeast bread I normally make.  I believe garlic would have been a nice addition.  Family vote was, "This bread was just okay just average."  Thanks for the recipe.

RECIPE GROUP-This was awesome!!! I used bread flour (I always use that for bread) I took another reviewers sugguestion and I used 1 cup cubed cheddar. I loved the pockets of cheese. I also threw in 1/4 cup shredded mexican blend cheese because it needed to be used up. My family and I love garlic so I added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, it was just the right amount. Next time I might try the quick rise yeast. It did take 2 hours to rise but my sour cream and egg were cold. Mine was a little overbaked at 30 minutes so check it a little earlier. It made 2 8x4 loves for me.

I a grated blend of Italian cheeses, added 2 tablespoons of olive oil and a clove (pressed) of garlic as well as fresh chopped rosemary and used the bread machine. This was supposed to accompany chicken soup that is still in the crockpot. We pretty much inhaled the loaf before it had a chance to cool!

Worked out well for me, although it took longer to rise (2 hr). I forgot to add the pepper, and added in a tsp of onion and garlic powder.  It took 45 min to bake in my glass loaf pan.  It turned out to be a beautiful loaf of cheese bread, yum!

Made this for the recipe group.  It was good!  NEEDS MORE CHEESE!  I did an cup and 1/4 and still wanted more.  Other than that a nice crumbly style bread.  Also the directions need some attending too :)

Recipe Group selection of 9/3/11.  Have all your ingredients at room temperature before you start this bread.  If you start with cold sour cream or egg it will impede the rise.  Having said that, it still took over 2 hours for my loaves to rise. I started with 1 cup of extra sharp cheddar, but it didn't seem like enough when I folded it in so I added another 1/2 cup.  I also used coarse, fresh ground pepper, which I didn't measure so I probably used more like 1 tbs.  This baked up to be moist and flavorful.  Thanks, Sue!

I also made a few changes. First, I made the dough as directed (no cheese or pepepr) but I kneeded it for about 10-15 minutes to develop the gluten and let it rise. Since I like a very crispy crust, after the first rise I added flour coated cheese cubes (about 1.5 cups) and doubled the pepper. I divided it in half and placed it on a silicon baking sheet (which was necessary to get the bread off!) with a layer of grated parm underneath and on top. I let it rise a second time until it was about doubled. The parm gave it a great crust and the inside was still soft and tender. Thanks!

Very good flavor. Did not rise at all after 1 hour.  I ended up with 2 pieces of flat bread instead.  Will try again!

Loved it! Sometimes I add green chili, or chopped rosemary.
