I used white whole wheat flour along with the all-purpose flour in this pizza dough and really liked the end result, a chewy texture. I let my Kitchenaid mixer do the work for me, so this was a really easy dough to mix up.

I have to say YUM! My family really enjoyed this whole wheat pizza crust. It had the right texture but a nice crunch to it. I'm a diabetic and it's hard to find good recipes that don't take much time. This recipe was fast and easy and delicious, thank you for posting this

I used a whole cup of whole wheat flour and they turned out amazing. I cooked them for 15 min then froze them in my deep freeze for a quick week night supper.

seriously the best whole wheat crust I've ever tasted in my life

tip: pre-cook the dough 7-10 minutes without toppings, then take out and add toppings, cook for 10-12 minutes til cheese turns slightly golden.  PERFETTO

This was my first time making pizza dough from scratch. I was surprised when I got to the end and I didn't see any directions on how to bake it. Thankfully there were several recommendations from posters. I tried one out one night and another way the second night. The one that worked best was to bake it at 425 degrees F for about 20 minutes or until the crust & cheese are golden brown.

I really didn't think it would be as good as it was! Super easy and came out perfect! You can make it thick or thin and it's just as good.  I added some dried herbs to dough, but followed recipe exactly.  I cooked pizza 350 for 15 minutes.

To be honest I didn't expect much from this recipe. But it turned out to be the best pizza dough I ever used (and I've tried quite a few - including my "go to recipe" I received from an Italian chef). The pizzas turned out just perfect. Great texture with just enough crunch. I am definitely making it my regular pizza dough. 

The only thing I changed was using the bread machine to prepare the dough. Then I've put together pizzas and baked them in the preheated (250 C - about 480 F) oven on a pizza stone for 9 minutes.

I just tried this recipe and loved it. I try to substitute white flour with whole wheat whenever possible and this recipe appealed to me. It sounded good, and it was. I prepared it just as the recipe calls, except that I sprinkled a little cornmeal under it when I spread it out. The extra crunch was a big hit with my family. This will be my go to pizza dough recipe from now on.

Really great taste, perfect size for one pizza, just need to figure out cooking temp to get a crunchier crust... (375 for about 15-20 minutes left it soft and chewy)

I will make this again.  Rolled out and used half to line a cast iron pan and up the sides a bit and added mozzarella around edge, then folded dough over the mozza to make a stuffed crust. Put toppjngs on then cooked pizza on stove top for about 5 minutes on medium high then put the pan in a preheated toaster oven 400 F for about 20 minutes . The best homemade pizza I have made to date. Crust was crisp and chewy, not soggy, and very tasty. Great. Will make again.

Very good indeed.  I made with "Tracy Ann's favorite pizza sauce.  Perfect for Pampered Chef pizza pan.  I also added a few shakes of italian seasonings.  Def a keeper.

Overall, we liked it. I will definitely do it again, but I will not follow the recommendation to pre-cook it for 10 minutes. It caused 2 large crusty bubbles to form. (We salvaged the pizza.) I also let the yeast do it's thing in a bowl with the sugar and water for about 5-10 minutes first  before mixing with the flour which I think made it especially light and airy. Next time I will just roll the dough out, which was quite easy, instead of trying to throw it in the air.

I used this recipe to make some pizza shells on the grill.  I cooked them over hot coals until they got bubbly then I flipped them and added toppings.  They turned out great.  Just don't use too many toppings like we did, or they will get a little soggy.

The only change I made was I kneaded in the oil as I forgot to add to yeasty water before mixing into flour ..and it came out light as a feather...i also rolled out on corn meal then flattened in baking sheet.  Otherwise best whole wheat flour pizza dough ever.

This was my first time making pizza dough and it came out wonderful! I'm a beginning vegan so I am always looking for recipes I can make from scratch so  that I can be discreet with the ingredients! I did however substitute regular yeast for the "Fleischmann's brand Pizza Crust Yeast" that was fast and easy with no wait time for the dough to rise! Added all my vegan ingredients to the crust and popped it in the oven! Out came a delicious pizza that I will be making for years! Even took some to work and my meat eating co-workers even loved it too!

Loved this recipe! Perfect pizza dough especially for making thin crust like we like. It's nice and thick as a dough so it's easy to work with and doesn't pull apart or become sticky when trying to move it to a pizza stone or oven after rolling out . Love!

I made my whole wheat pizza dough as the recipe exactly without change anything just doubled the amount. I fill the topping with the jar of tomato basil and I add the 2 small cans of the slice mushrooms, and add sliced of manzanilla green olives, slice cilantro, slice ham, and the final topping was three mix of (smashed garlic with cilantro) and mix them with the mozzarella cheese, so finally I sprinkled them on the top of the pizza. I put it in the oven on 500 degrees F for 16 minutes. Wow turned so beautifully gorgeous and delicious. I'm so happy that I've tried it. My son loved it so do I. My great thankful and appreciations for All Recipes app.  .Really, they made my day full of joy.

I am not sure if it was the flour used or the recipe, but when forming for pizza, it was quick to make holes. I did use whole wheat flour not wheat flour, which may have played a role. Tasted good though! We pre-cooked at 400 degrees for about 5 minutes before topping and putting back in for 5-8 more minutes.

this recipe is great and it came out awesome the very first try. I had to use a bit more flour tho. I accidentally find out you can use this same recipe for a loaf of nice wheat bread or dinner rolls. just double or triple the ingredients for big loaves

This turned out great! We made 4 individual pizzas out of it. We baked two at a time at 350 for about 15 minutes.

The perfect pizza dough! I used it on the grill as well. Cooks evenly and tastes wonderful.

I love this crust.  I made it in my food processor which made it a snap.  It was soft and had great flavor.  Next time I am going to add garlic powder and parmesan cheese to the recipe to kick it up a notch.

Just tried this recipe tonight as a late night snack and it was a big hit.  Can't eat white flour pizza due to sugar and carbs diet and this whole wheat crust should fit the bill nicely.

I made this for my kid's and they love it. I followed the recipe exactly. I doubled the recipe and made 4 individual pizzas. A new favorite for our family fun nights.

Loved the texture of this dough. I doubled it and made 5 perfect individual-sized pizzas for us. I did need to add appr. 1/2c. more flour to get it to the point where it no longer stuck to the sides of the bowl. I used rapid-rise yeast, and turned my oven into a proofing box so it would rise faster. Great recipe. Will definitely make again!

Great, very base overall. Added about 1 cup water instead 3/4 and some spices. Mixed all in my kitched aid mixer. Will try other recipes, this one is too plain for my taste.
