I only had salted butter on hand so I used that. I ran my oats through the food processor for a finer consistancy. I also used pecans instead of walnuts. My cookies were done at just over ten minutes, not quite eleven but not exactly ten. My husband was skeptical of the oats in his beloved chocolate chip cookies (he's a bit of a cookie purist) but he thought these were tasty, as did my kids. I'll make these again.

Wow what I really enjoyed the compliments I received from making this recipe. When my boyfriends 11 year old son asked if I could make chocolate chip cookies for him. I told that I have never attempted making chocolate chip cookies before but I will try. I searched for a recipe and found this one. I followed some of the suggestions and added a lit more oats.  I didn't eat any cause at the time I was following a weight loss program.  The next day when I came back home from work. My boyfriends son greeted me and told me that he finished all the cookies but left two for me (he didn't know that I was on a diet). When I asked him how he enjoyed the cookes he simply answered beautiful. At his response I decided to forget about the diet and try the cookies. Didn't regret it one bit.

Based on the review that said they were too flat I added .5 c. more flour (just guessing) and I didn't bother to measure the chocolate chips, I just dumped a 12 oz. bag. I am eating one now and I am pleased, perfect mix of crunchy and chewy with lots of flavor.  Oh also I deleted milk and put 3 tsp vanilla instead of 2.  Also I greased my sheets just in case cos I didn't want to have to fight to get them off. Also I added about 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon at the end and that was a good addition.  They baked perfectly--not too flat, easy to get off the sheet.

Delightfully sweet, chewy and crispy.  Unusually and pleasantly light and airy.  Maybe just a little TOO sweet for me but Hubs, I'm sure, will appreciate that and "eat them till he gets sick," a phrase he uses when he really likes something. I made no big changes - just used salted butter and omitted the walnuts.  A very respectable cookie, but not extraordinary.

These are VERY good. I do think the bigger they are the better. I used an ice cream scoop to make mine and baked them for 15-16 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!!

Please use ONLY unsalted butter in this recipe !  Use parchment paper on cookies sheets.. If you alter the recipe .. please don't expect great results. Most of usunlike the cook's illustrated are not food engineers!

I rated this a 5 because my husband loved them so much.  He is the cookie expert.  I thought that it was an overdose of chocolate chips but if you're into chocolate then you'll love these. Be sure not to overbake. Thanks for the superb recipe.

I used only used 2 cups of chocolate chips since that's all there was in the bag which was more than enough chocolate anyway.  I substitued raisins for the nuts due to allergies.  These came out very flat, crunchy, and brittle (I prefer fat chewy ones).  I could not remove them from the cookie sheet until they were cooled.  I greased the next batch made larger balls, and waited for them to cool for 5 minutes which worked much better.   I didn't like them at all, but the kids cleared the plate without complaining.  Better them than me anyway.

These were absolutely great! Instead of just pouring the oats in, I ground them to a chunky flour in my food processor. I also used milk chocolate chips and caramel pieces, which resulted in a chocolatey, nutty, toffee-studded cookie. Fantastic! My whole team adored them. :]

Yikes. I chill cookie dough before baking to help them stand up better, but these were beyond help. I've never had cookies spread so thin. At first I thought I did something wrong, then I looked closer at the reviews.   With my last sheet, I made the cookies larger and they sat up a little better. Nonetheless, I thought they were too sweet and crunchy in the wrong sort of way. I recommend "Chewy Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies" from this site. especially if you chill the dough a couple hours before baking, and add an extra 1/4 to 1/2 cup of flour. They're not picture-perfect either, but they stand up better than these, and aren't so sweet or toasty/crunchy.

The best cookies ever!  The oats make them taste even chewier than the regular kind, and makes it a little more heart-healthy.  I deleted the walnuts, since my husband and I don't like nuts.  I added about 1 cup more flour, because my first batch was very watery and spread like crazy.  I definitely agree that you should grease or Pam your cookie sheet first.  To me, the more chocolate chips, the better, so I added the full 3 cups of chips.  Yum!!

I gave 3 stars because they're sweet and chocolatey --  how bad can that be?!  They're just not great.  The original toll house recipe is better.  In fact, I think the original oatmeal cookie recipe would be better and just add choc chips instead of raisins.  I'm having trouble understanding all the 5 star ratings.  I guess people have a need to believe that they've found something great after spending time making it.  They're not bad, but not great.

This really is the best cookie recipe I've ever made. I had made over 100 different ones.   I too, omit the milk and grind up the oatmeal in the food processor. PERFECTION.  And to think I only saved this recipe because my son's name is in the title! What a find.

Honestly, I have no idea how anyone has problems with this recipe.  I have made it dozens of times and it has never failed me, from the very first time I made it.  I will use salted butter, unsalted butter, doesn't matter.  I have made these cookies vegan many times (I use flax instead of eggs and vegan margarine and soymilk), I often use whole wheat flour instead of regular flour, I will use brown sugar instead of white, I even substituted the oats for bran, and every time this recipe comes out perfect...chewy and sweet and full of chocolate.  If it doesn't work for you, then you're fired.  Honestly, this recipe is a no-brainer.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe!  I don't think I've ever made or eaten such good cookies before!  I made a few alterations to it too; I put about 1/2 cup less chocolate chips (so about 2.5 cups), added 2-3 tsp of cinnamon and replaced the walnuts with dried cranberries (I also added a few extra handfuls of these).  Delicious!  I also found that if you flatten the balls before baking, they spread much more nicely and bake evenly; just a thought.  Thank you!

This recipe was totally frustrating!  I usually don't give bad reviews, but I didn't like this recipe at all.  Cookies went flat like others warned, so I expected that.  But what I didn't expect was trying to get crispy-edged, gloppy-middle cookies off the cookie sheet.  What a mess!  Once the cookies cooled, IF you could get them to the rack in one piece they stiffened up enough.  And, I'm quite enjoying eating them today - so they have really good flavour.  BUT, I can't say I'll use this recipe again.

Very chewy and rich. I made some changes though, used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of 1 cup butter and I cooked mine as bar cookies in a 9x13 pan. baked at 350 for 40 minutes. Delish!

Always looking for a good cookie recipe! This one was great--I gave it a 4 only because I made some changes. I used margarine instead of butter, omitted the milk and salt, and used 1 cup chocolate chips, 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup Halloween M n M's.  I also ground up the oatmeal a bit before I added it to the mixture. They look great--and taste good too! Thanks for the recipe!

Best cookies I've ever made!  Tollhouse, move over!  These cookies were just a little crunchy on the outside, but soft and chewy on the inside with tons of chocolate.  Perfect texture.  Didn't use walnuts.

I love this recipie!  I needed to find an oatmeal choc chip recipie better than my mother-in-laws and I found it here.  I put in 3 cups of oats (to prevent too much spreading) and only 2 cups of choc chips and my family LOVES them.

This recipe is phenomenal! I've tried many, many chocolate chip recipes and this is hands down the best I've tasted. And it's so simple. I used only 12 oz chocolate chips (because that's all I had), and baked them in a 12x18" pan for just under 20 minutes.

These are great cookies! I used half chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips and they are delicious! The recipe makes lots of cookies.

Fantastic! I will definately follow the recipe closer next time though as I failed to roll the dough into walnut size balls, dropping it in heaped teaspoonfuls instead. They SPREAD. But they were still delicious.

This was my first attempt at american cookies and they were just wonderful.  The instructions were easy to follow and the results were superb.  My children loved them - my toddler's head kept vanishing behind a cookie, it was like watching an eclipse!  These will definitely be a regular in our house.

I have made these three times now. The recipe is excellent as written - I followed it exactly twice. Most recently I tweaked it by using both all purpose white flour and wheat flour, was the best batch so far. I will make these again for sure!

If the stars went up higher, I would rate it as high as it would go.  These are the best ever & easy to make too.  I have had to make three batches in one week !! I can't keep them on hand.  I used 1 bag of white chips, & one bag of milk chocolate, omitted ythe nuts & used raisens in it's place

I made $11.75 by selling a batch of these for 25 cents a cookie! These are AWESOME! Also, I didn't have any white sugar for some reason, so I used 2 cups of brown but slightly less sugar and more vanilla, which worked really well.

I've been looking for a cookie recipe that is chewy like I like them. This recipe is exactly what I wanted. It is a bit crispy on the outside and nice and chewy. Its very chocolatey. I didn't have any problems with them spreading as some people have mentioned.

WOW!!! These were D-LISH! After losing my Mom's recipe, I sought out another.....
I opted to take the advice of many others and alter the recipe a bit.  I doubled the recipe (as I needed A LOT of cookies) I almost tripled the amount of oats (eyeballed it) added some cinnamon, and split the dough in half.  To one half I added 3/4 of a bag of chips, to the other half, I added the remainder of the chips and a cup (+) of raisins.  I omitted the nuts alltogether.  They came out beautifully.  They didn't spread AT ALL!! 
This was a WONDERFUL recipe and I HIGHLY recommend it!!!

Beware these cookies spread!!! The taste is really about a 5 but I had the biggest mess until I added about a cup more oatmeal. The cookies spread so much that they turned into more of a crisp.  Definately try this recipe but definately add more oatmeal!!

I found these needed to bake about 1-2 minutes longer than called for. However I also used 1/2 cup less of oatmeal and replaced that with 1/2 cup more flour. I then used 1 cup less chocolate chips and they still seem to chocolatey. They turned out chewy and alright. However I am still looking for a plain thin and crisy, yet soft chocolate chip cookie recipe like my grandma used to bakd.

These were quite good.  I didn't feel like pulling out the food processor for the oats but I really should have.  They are not the prettiest cookies I ever made but rich and delicious. I used one pack of chocolate chips and just under 2 cups of oats.  I only had salted butter so that is what I used.  They were better the day after I made them.  I will make them again.

I love these cookies! The only change I made is the chocolate. I used 1bag ghiradelli milk chocolate and 1 cup of bitttersweet chocolate. Mainly because I bought the wrong chocolate, but I’ll use them again. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Turned out AMAZING!!!  I was skeptical of the oats as Ive never seen them in a chocolate chip recipe but upon contemplation it sounded like a great flavor combo and IT IS! The bottoms and edges are slightly crispy but the whole cookie stays "just right" soft .

These were great and did not flatten out too much. I could have cooked them two minutes less as they got quite crunchy after a couple of days. It made two gallon storage bags full. One is in the freezer.

I made this with gluten free flour and the results were good. I cut back on the chocolate chips as I thought it looked too heavy for my liking. I was right. I only used about 2/3 of the recipe amount but found that the amount made the cookie too sweet. That's a personal preference though.

I followed the recipe as written the first time and added a little cream of tarter the second time. About an 8th of a teaspoon. They turned out "cracked" a bit more with the cream of tarter. I will add it from now on.

These are the best chocolate chip oatmeal cookies ever!  I used salted European butter and added about 1/2 cup more flour to the recipe and they turned out AWESOME.  I made the batter one evening, chilled it and baked the next day.  They are chocolatey with soft middles and firm around the edges.  Just perfect!

Not the best, but good.  You have to be very careful on the baking time as it is easy for the sugar to melt out.  The batches I timed well were good and better the next day. I think I will keep trying others, though.

i have made this recipe over and over, always get lots of kudos. i do, however, use half the amount of sugar and chocolate chips and i tend to go a bit heavier on the walnuts than the recipe calls for, and with the oatmeal you almost feel like its a healthy snack :)

These cookies were good but I still have other recipes that I liked better. They came out soft and I cooked them on parachment paper on the cookie sheet. I swear by that paper, my cookies always come out tasting better. I did not use the walnuts but I had two bags of chocolate chips with macadamia nuts that I used and everyone said that they were good.

These are great cookies!  I halved the recipe, but followed it with only two changes.  I added cinnamon and used 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 pecans.  These didn't spread for me at all.  They're wonderful!

Wow!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

these cookies didn't have the structural integrity i expect from a cookie.  they disintegrated into lacy crumbs when i tried to get them off the sheets onto the cooling racks.  they tasted good, but so do all cookies.  they did improve on the second day, and i couldn't tell you much after that because they were gone.  but seriously, they didn't hold together very well.

I thought that these cookies were great! I used extra oatmeal and my batch wasn't the least bit gooey! Perfect! I like them best straight from the oven so they dont harden.

i tried this recipe without the rolled oats (realized i was all out a bit too late). unfortunately altering the recipe like this isn't the best idea. i'm sure they would have been delicious otherwise.

Very good cookie!!  I did follow what other said and added more oats to the recipe, about 3/4 of a cup, didn't have any cookies speading more than they should.  I also didn't use the called for 3 cups of chips and 1 1/2 cups of walnuts.  Stuck with the standard 2 cup bag of chips and I only had 1 cup of nuts, so that's what I used.  I didn't find the cookies too sweet at all, they were just perfect!!

I used less sugar than what was stated, otherwise it would've been too sweet.  Not a big fan of oats, I felt 2 1/2 cups rolled oats is a bit much (just my personal preference).  Overall, not a bad recipe.

This cookie is one of the best cookies I have ever had!  My two boys love them.  It will be on my list for a very long time. I love oats so I did increase the amount by 1/2 Cup

These turned out great - even though I left out the baking soda because I didn't have any.  I would cut down on the sugar by half if you don't like your cookies too sweet.

I made these for a group of kids I teach creative writing too and they were so yummy they were getting their mums to ask for the recipe.  A definite hit!  They were a bit squishy (no less delicious), but I think that was only because they had no time to sit when they came out the oven because the kids scoffed them all so fast!  Quick and easy, and the mixture works fine if you make it the day before and stick it in the fridge until you're ready to cook it.

Very good cookies.  Super sweet and chocolaty.  Did spread out quite a bit; would definitely recommend chilling the dough before baking.

Absolutely wonderful. My mom's a diabetic, and I just bought some sugar-free chocolate chips so that I could make cookies for her.  When I used this recipe, I wasn't exact with the measurements of walnuts or chocolate chips, but they came out just fine. Also, I substituted Brown Sugar Twin for the brown sugar and Splenda Sugar Blend for the white sugar. Then, at the end, I separated the cookie dough into two bowls and put sugar-free semi-sweet chocolate chips into one half and regular semi-sweet chocolate chips in the other half. All the cookies were delicious.

This recipe comes together VERY WELL!! YUMMMMMMMY!! I am a very picky Chocolate Chip cookie eater.  If I am going to consume the "naughty" calories, I want them to be worth it... and believe me, these ARE!
