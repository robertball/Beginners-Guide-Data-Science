Love this recipe! I'm a huge kombucha addict, but it gets expensive and I haven't ventured into making the real thing yet.  This is a super tasty shortcut recipe that really does taste like the real thing! I'm not a huge fan of powdered ginger, so was a little conservative with the amount at first, but I ended up adding the full amount.  Next time I might try with a slice of fresh ginger. The blueberries give it a nice pink color. I think I will omit the lemon juice, or halve the amount from now on, just a personal preference.   Such a refreshing drink for the summer! I can't wait to experiment with flavored La Croix waters and different fruits. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

07.10.17 ~ As soon as I saw a review from LilSnoo, I knew I had to try this recipe. My DH loves the expensive version of this drink. He thought this version was 'ok' and I liked it better than the store bought version, but still can't love it, yet. I love the taste of vinegar, but have a hard time getting past the taste in the drink. I did buy a flavored seltzer water so I'm going to try this again. I'm still giving this 4-stars and going to work on perfecting it for my DH taste. Love the cost of this version, much better!
