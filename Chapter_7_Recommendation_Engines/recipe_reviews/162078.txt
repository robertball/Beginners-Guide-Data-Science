This was simple but really good. I did spread some crushed garlic on the crust after the olive oil then put the mozzarella and added some parmesean. The kids loved it!

It was so good. I put chicken on 1 because I got to small crusts. The other I put turkey pepperoni on to see what it would taste like. We loved it. I will make this again. I used minced garlic from a jar though to make it quicker for me.

This recipe is very good and easy! I used minced garlic from the jar to save some time and added some bacon and fresh basil as a topping. Delicious!

This was really good and so easy. To make it 5 stars I would add some chicken and maybe even some alfredo sauce. But still yummy just as it's written.

This is very good I love the flavor. I think I would put the garlic on and then the cheese next time and I might mince my garlic. I also will add some red pepper and italian spices.. Thanks for the recipe. I love a change from regualar pizza!

Very yummy! I used a little more olive oil than directed and topped it with bellpeppers onions mushrooms and pepperoni.... YUMMY!!! Also I used a Pisbury thin crust - baked it first til it was almost done - and followed the directions from there. It is a new staple! Thanks!

A delicious base recipe! I used a Boboli pizza crust and I added chopped fresh basil on top before baking. Also I minced the garlic and rubbed it on the crust with the olive oil.

This was perfect for us people sensitive to tomato sauce. It smelled almost like garlic bread. I grated my garlic and spread it under the cheese. Yum! Will be makung again.

So easy and tasty. Great to cut into thin strips and serve like breadsticks. Also delicious to serve with pasta. Will definitely reuse this recipe!

This was a very quick easy dinner. I used minced garlic for ease of preparation and placed it over the olive oil. Then topped with an Italian five cheese blend. Turned out wonderful should have made two of them!! Thanks so much jillytuile for posting.

For simplicity - this was great! I did reduce the garlic down to 6 cloves and still felt it was a bit overpowering (and I like garlic). I also reduced the cheese down to 2 cups which I felt was plenty. I also did not add the drizzle of olive oil at the end as I felt it unnecessary. For ease and final outcome though I felt it was a good recipe. Thanks for sharing jillytuile!

I spread ricotta on the crust and topped with shaved parmesan and shredded mozzarella. I added sliced tomatoes on top just before baking. It was delicious! I sliced the garlic thinly and placed it on the ricotta layer.

This was very easy to make. I also used minced garlic and spread it on before I added the cheese. I also added broccoli before the cheese but after the garlic. I'm not a big fan of alfredo but think I will use some as part of the sauce.
