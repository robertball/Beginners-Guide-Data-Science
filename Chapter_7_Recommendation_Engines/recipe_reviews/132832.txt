Stir Fry sauce with brown sugar HAS to be good!  I made twice as much of the soy/vinegar/brown sugar /cornstarch mixture and then tossed the stir fry with ramen noodles (cooked without the seasoning packet) to soak up all the good flavor.

I was skeptical at first when I tried this because there wasn't alot to the sauce.  I ended up doubling the sauce because I threw in extra veggies and I wanted to make sure there would be enough to cover everything.  We didn't love the sauce.  There was something missing and the rice wine was not a great flavor in it.  All we could taste was the rice wine.  I'm not sure if I will try this again.  It didn't leave me feeling satisfied at all.

I also doubled the sauce and added a tbs of hoisin sauce at the end.  When the stir fry was finished cooking I stirred in some Chow Mein Stir fry noodles.  This would have been good with broccoli and/ or snap peas.

Really neat flavour... I reduced the garlic and found it refreshing.

This was a quick and easy stir fry to prepare, and went really well served over noodles.

very good, made it this evening using bacon instead. My husband loves it. I followed what the others said and double the gravy and I added some chopped green onion before serving it. Will definitely make it again.

I also doubled the sauce as recommended, but found the dish kind of bland.  I served it over vermicelli noodles, but it was just missing something.   Probably needed a little heat, and maybe a bit of oyster or hoisin sauce.

I have been making stir-fry for years but have never used a recipe before so thought it might be fun to follow one and see how it turns out. I added kosher salt and pepper to the meat, and I added cabbage because I was unsure if mushroom and carrot would be enough.  I think I would slice the carrots next time, not shred as they just turn mushy. I threw in some chow mein noodles.  This dish was a hit with the family including the teenagers!

This was good, not great. I took some other suggestions and doubled the glaze. Before that, however, I marinated the meat and garlic in some soy sauce and a splash of EVOO, with some cornstarch and a sprinkle of pepper flakes, for about 20 minutes while I cooked basmati rice and prepped my veges. I cooked the onion, more garlic and ginger in hot oil, then added meat and seared quickly. I removed the meat, added veges, including, snow peas and some sliced red peppers in addition to carrots and mushrooms. stirred for about 3-4 minutes,  added glaze ( substituted cooking sherry for rice wine), cooked till thick and bubbly, added meat and served over rice with sliced green onion. had good flavor and texture. meat was nice and tender. Hubby not a big fan of stir fry, but had seconds.

I liked it!  But I made a few changes, based on Reviews.  I doubled the sauce and instead of Brown Sugar I used Oyster Sauce; instead of Rice Wine I used Chicken Stock; and instead of a carrot I used some fresh baby corns which I found at Whole Foods and just HAD to try them in a stir fry.  Also I used Shittake Mushrooms instead of White.  I served this with Ramen Noodles which I cooked and drained and then mixed in with the stir fry.  Oh, I added a pinch of Red Pepper Flakes and served this with crushed Peanuts which cut down the saltiness of the Soy.  It was Excellent!

Made this because I had a small amount of pork and some cut veggies to use up. It was delicious!  I doubled the sauce but I added sliced cabbage, water chestnuts, sliced green and red pepper, celery, broccoli, cauliflower,green onions and red onion. I needed to use them up. I used the carrots and mushrooms as indicated in the recipe. This was wonderful! Served over rice!

Great taste. I added some pea pods and bean sprouts at the end.  I would use less ginger next time.  It is a keeper!

Interesting.  I am making this right now, have the veggies and ham in the wok, sauce is made and I did double it and just for fun I added oyster sauce to the mix and a little extra brown sugar.  I am also making peanut sauce to go with it and am making kroepoek groot to help scoop up the awesomeness.  Starving and it smells wonderful...thanks for sharing.
