I was making 2 cheesecakes and didn't have enough cream cheese to finish my 2nd one. I went looking for a recipe that only used 3 cream cheeses and this one came up. I baked both and this one turned out lighter and better with a lot less work than my other one! I did put it in a water bath like I always do and added ground walnuts and a little sugar to the crust for extra flavor. This is a wonderul and easy recipe. Thanks for posting it is my new favorite cheese cake!

Followed the directions with no changes made. The cheesecake while baking unfortunately overflowed quite a bit - drippings everywhere on the bottom of my oven. It settled back down though. AFter baking the top of the cheesecake cracked quite a bit. The taste was quite good but there are better.

I made this recipe exactly as written. The cheesecake collapsed and the texture was grainy. I should have been wary since this recipe has been on this site for many years and has never taken off.  There are other easy and delicious cheesecake recipes out there.
