Fruity and Fabulous! This is a great chicken salad and a great way to use up some leftover grilled chicken that I hand on hand. I LOVE dried cranberries so this chicken salad was right up my alley. I chopped up the chicken and opted to used celery in place of the green onions. I also chopped up a Red Delicious apple vs. shredding it. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used Hellman's light mayo and cut it with a bit of reduced fat sour cream I also used curry powder vs. dill. I'm a huge fan of dill, but for this salad I felt the curry powder just paired better. I let this set in the fridge for a few hours, after sneaking a few bits and WOW, what a wonderful combination of flavors! This was so good on whole grain bread. Thanks Rachel for a wonderful recipe!

This was great but I did change a lot, I didn't use apples or lemon juice,  I used walnuts, bacon, celery, and no onion.  I served it on a good bread and it was wonderful, perfect for summer. Loved the dill

FANTASTIC!  What a terrific way to use left over chicken.  I didn't measure a thing because I didn't feel it was necessary.  My changes were to skip the green onion, used red apple for green apple, and almond slices for pecans.  That's because it was what I had on hand.  I love the way the dried cranberries add a sweetness and the nuts add the crunch.  Such a FANTASTIC easy recipe.  Thank you for sharing Rachel!   You made my day!!

Excellent! This is my favorite chicken salad recipe. Easy to put together, fresh and flavorful. The dill adds the perfect touch. Rotisserie chicken works well in this recipe, too and is a great timesaver. I make this a lot for light suppers during the summer. Thanks, Rachel!

I gave this recipe to one of in-house corporate cafe employees.    She made 20 sandwiches ahead of time and they all went in less than an hour!   By the time I got there, they were gone.  She has requests from all over the building to put that on the menu again!  Excellent recipe!

Very good! I made this for a picnic lunch we had at a winery - goes well with a nice cool, crisp white wine.  The pecans and dried cranberries add interesting flavors.  I made it the night before and it was definitely better after the flavors blended together.  Delicious!

I didn't have green onions or dried dill weed, however, I added vidalia onion vinaigrette in place of the mayo and it turned out fabulous!  I loved the dried cranberries in there!

Oh wow, I make a pretty good chicken salad but this one was amazing!  DH and I both loved it.  I just estimated the ingredients and left out the apples because I didn't have any, plus I don't think it would keep as well, and substituted dry onions for the green.  I also added a few stalks of finely chopped celery.  This is a keeper!

The perfect chicken salad! I used canned chicken, red apple (green would have been better), light mayo and left out the dill. My family ate the whole batch at lunch today. Wish there was some leftover!

Delicious! I made this on Sunday, and it was even better  by Wednesday. I had it in a wrap and even by itself. I left the chicken & apples in chunks instead of grinding them down. I left out the onion to avoid bad breath! It was great, and I will make it again.

This had a nice blend of flavors. I forgot to add the dill and used plain fat free yogurt(twice as much, and still a little dry) instead of mayo. I usually prefer plain yogurt rather than mayo but I think next time I'll use a small amount in the mix.  I would also add more apple since it wasn't very noticeable to me even though I shredded most of a yellow delicious. It took a couple of tries to pick a shredder with holes big enough to not make apple mush so I think for me dicing would be easier.

Made this and put it over lettuce for a healthy main dish.  We did add a little of ranch dressing over the top of the finished product.  My boys ate it up quickly and the hubby liked it- although he later made a hamburger because he was a little hungry.  Next time I will make that as a lunch meal instead of a main dish for dinner.

Great chicken salad. i did make some changes bc i always do. i used half light mayo half sour cream and a bit of miracle whip for taste. didnt really measure anything just kept adding till it tasted good. i used some dried tarragon (fresh would have been better) instead of dill weed and it added a great flavor that it was lacking before! curry would have also been good to add instead of the tarragon. i used celery instead of green onion, i used chopped red apple instead of the green (about half an apple). and fresh lemon juice bc i didnt have the lime.  it tastes better the next day. i love chicken salad and this was a great starter recipe

Served in Pita w/ lettuce.  Omitted the pecans.  Chicken breasts were seasoned with pepper, olive oil, montreal chicken seasoning, onion powder, minced garlic.  Pounded before cooking and cooked in microwave for 4 minutes, then chopped it up. Had green beans and rice with it...

I made this and took to work for dinner.  I thought I'd have enough for another meal or so, but it was so popular at my house it was all gone by the time I got home.  Thanks for a great recipe.

LOVE this recipe!  I didn't measure, just added the ingredients in proportions that looked good to me.  I substituted lemon juice for the lime juice and walnuts for the pecans.  I also didn't have quite enough mayonnaise on hand, so I added in some sour cream and WOW did that ever make the dish!  I was tasting all along and the sour cream really made a difference--I'll add that in every time I make this recipe from now on.

I’ve made this chicken salad a couple times and used a Fuji apple and walnuts since that’s what I had on hand, and omitted the dill weed since I didn’t have any. However, it still tasted delicious!! Love this recipe!!!

This is SO DELICIOUS Rachel!  My sister and I made this for a 40 person baby shower and had many requests for the recipe. We "improvised" in a few places by using red onion instead of green, non sweetened dried cranberries found in the produce department, cut Granny Smith apples in little slivers rather than shred them and used 1TB of fresh dill in place of dried (as in your notes).   Served on croissants!
This recipe will be famous in south Florida!

Yummy! My husband liked it too. The only change I made was that I used dried cherries instead of dried cranberries because that was what I had in my pantry.

Super easy to make and tastes great!  I'm a 26 year old male with NO cooking experience and I encountered NO problems!  I used chopped cashews and it came out GREAT!

I made this for a ladies luncheon at church.  Kept to the recipe exactly except I tripled the recipe.  (Used a prepared chicken from Sam's)  Instead of taking it in a bowl, I used a cookie scoop and placed a scoop of the salad in mini cupcake papers and placed on a tray.  So pretty to display them that way and since there was so much other food there, this was a perfect amount for each lady.  Thanks for a very good recipe.

DH was asking if I could make a cranberry chicken salad so I thought I'd give this a go.   We like "real" chicken so I boiled fresh chicken and found the salad to be quite dry.  Other reviews used canned chicken which is probably why they did not run into a dryness issue. I began adding more mayo and lime juice but was then afraid the mayonnaise would drown out the lovely fruit so I added a splash of whipping cream and it was perfect, just what DH wanted.

My favorite style of chicken salad. I soak the cranberries in hot water for a couple of minutes; just long enough to soften them (not mushy). I just eyeball the ingredients and it's always good. The flavor combinations are wonderful.

This salad is now my new favorite.If you don't love this I don't know what you must like. It is great in sandwiches and on toast. The texture is perfect and the cranberries added the perfect touch. Everything blended perfectly. Totally five stars. Thanks a bunch for sharing!

~sigh~ I loved this!  So good, cool and refreshing.  I used fat free mayo, chopped the apples not shredded and toasted sesame seeds in place of the pecans.  I only had a tablespoon of dried cranberries so I added fresh grapes and blueberries.  For some added fiber I added in a tablespoon of flax bran.  Served over a bed of spinach.  Delicious!

Exactly what i was looking for. Had to use red onion, as that's all i had on hand, but will use green next time. And i grated old cheddar in because i love it with apple and pecans.  I doubled the recipe, but substituted 1/2 cup of sour cream, for the extra 1/2 cup of mayo.  Thank you!

Love this salad. It's the only chicken salad recipe I will make! Easy to change up too, but I never leave anything out. Sometimes I add pepitas or sunflower seeds. Sometimes I do pecans, sometimes walnuts. And I don't like my salads too saucy so I scale back the Mayo and often cut it half and half with plain Greek yogurt. My small children LOVE it too!!!

Wonderful! Took a reviewers suggestion and added a bit of sour cream. Mine tended to need a lot more salt to add a bit more taste. I subbed in walnuts. My 4 yr old gobbled it up!

I used rotisserie chicken. I halved the green onion amount (sometimes use onion powder) and the other 1/2 I added celery.  I usually don't add apples because the cranberries are sweet enough and often I have an apple dessert.  This is easy to make for a brunch the night before and then I'll serve it with croissants.

I made this tonight for the second time. Again, it didn't wow me. My husband liked it, but he'll eat anything so that doesn't say much. I feel there isn't enough flavor from the apple and would suggest chopping one into small chunks, and not grating it. I again couldn't detect the dill amongst the other flavors. I added celery this time and left the green onion in as well, and there was still not enough other items besides chicken. I'd suggest upping the amount of green onions at least, if not adding in another item for additional flavor. Not a bad recipe, but definitely not one I have a desire to make again.

I used 1/2 of a rotisserie chicken, shredded.  I didn't have an apple so I cut up some seedless grapes and I used almonds instead of pecans.  Delicious on croissants with a slice of tomato and shredded lettuce.  It's a keeper!

I didn't have an apple or the cranberries the first time I made this. . . I added chopped green pepper. Also added a bit of chicken granules and used more pecans. The second time I didn't have a green pepper but did have an apple and cranberries:) Great both ways. I probably used less mayo . . just enough to mix. I realized I prefer chicken shredded better than cubed, and chopped apple better than grated - just me turning picky in my old age. Thank you Rachel, I'll make this again!

This chicken salad is amazing!  I made exactly as instructed and was very pleased with the combination of flavors and textures. I'll be making this again. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Rachel!

This is so yummy! I did add a bit more light mayo, since I found it a bit dry.

This was outstanding!  You can tweak it any way you like! I only made a few adjustments dictated by what I had on hand, but the apples, cranberries, and nuts (I used roasted salted sliced almonds) give this salad such great texture and crunch!  I will go back to this again and again if I have any leftover chicken! Thank you Rachel :)

Made this according to the recipe. Turned out fantastic ! I also added a celery stock. Unfortunately, being diabetic I made the second batch without the cranberries. I was still impressed. I did love the cranberries ! Excellent recipe.

Lots of changes. Used 1/4 cup mayo 1/4 cup Greek Yogurt. Added Cherries and walnuts. I cooked the chicken with olive oil rub. Added salt, pepper, garlic, and light jerk seasoning. Came out great. My wife said I should open a restaurant.

I made this recipe exactly as written for a lunch today.  It turned out very tasty.  I did not have time to cook chicken, I used 2 cans 13oz. chicken. I was concerned about using the lime juice and dill, but they added  nice flavor to the salad.

I would make again.  I didn't have all the ingredients so I used red onion and celery in lieu of green onions and apples and no dill but it still was delicious.  My 1st time making a chicken salad and I was quite pleased with the final result.

This was delicious and a big hit at my daughter-in-law’s baby shower. We served it on Hawaiian dinner rolls spread with a light layer of pineapple cream cheese.  I left out the green onions- some family members don’t like onions- but I had added a little shake of paprika to the mix. So good!

Pretty easy and delicious. I probably used a little more meat to make it less of a "paste" for lack of better word and it's pretty tasty. Also used about 1/7 of a large spanish onion, minced, instead of the green onions.

Great overall.  Tastes fantastic.  I need a way to have more moisture without adding more mayo. I'm not the biggest mayo fan.

Made Cranberry Balsamic Glazed Chicken Thighs the night before.  Deboned & Shredded the leftover chicken.  Finely diced 1/2 an apple instead of shredding  and used walnuts insead of pecans.
Turned out better than expected.  Will make again.

I love this salad idea. Because I did not have some ingredients I made few changes: instead of apple I added green seedless grape, instead of pecans I added walnuts and because I love avocado I tried to add an avocado to it. Its came out just perfect!!!

For me, I used less mayo and ALOT of lime juice to give it a kick.  I think celery, even grated carrot would do nicely in this yummy salad.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I did not have lime juice on hand and I subbed red onion for green onion.  We enjoyed our "snack dinner" after riding horses.  I will make this again.

Fabulous! Very easy and delicious. Made for girl's Bunco night, as written with the exception of using a red delicious apple and not including the dill. Everyone loved this chicken salad. I received five requests for the recipe.

I love this recipe, and in fact, it may become my "go-to" recipe for chicken salad!  You may adapt this to the things you have on hand, as I did.  I doubled the recipe, used rotisserie chicken, so no need for salt and pepper; threw the whole Fuji apple in; added a bit more mayo and eyeballed the pecans.  I love the addition of dill, and the lime juice was inspired.  To stretch it a bit, next time I will add diced celery.  Again, loved it, and thanks for submitting!

I used almonds because I didn't have any pecans on hand; i added chicken broth to make it a little wet and lightened up on the mayonnaise; and i also added a quarter of a red onion. Came out absolutely delicious!!!

Wonderful.  Reminds me of a citrus chicken salad I love near my daughter's boarding school.  She made it with some modifications: no pecans, less dill.  I might try with the full dill next time.

My favorite chicken salad.  Sometimes I add a little strawberry salad dressing  to the mayo or sweetened pecans.   Doesn't really change the  taste, just adds a sweetness that makes it a little special and great for company or for a potluck.

This is so good! We used a package of the Costco grilled chicken breast strips chopped up. We didn't really measure anything but used all the the recipe called for. Served on croissants with cheddar or muenster cheese! Yum!!!!!

yum!  I used leftover rotisserie chicken from Costco and nixed the apple ,dill and lemon juice. I used pistachios instead of Pecans. I am sure the Pecans would be delish just didn't have any at hand. Also used plain greek yogurt instead of mayo.Wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla and added some spinach.. Wonderful clean lunch!

Very good. After making the salad, I cooked and added a box of macaroni noodles and a bit of left over rice to make it more filling. I was hoping for left overs but there was none. (I guess that's ok :/ )

This chicken salad is terrific! I have been looking for a recipe to try and make it like my local hometown coffee café and this is it. My only changes were using a chopped red apple instead of green, and I added a few drops of liquid stevia to the mayo mixture to give it a hint of sweetness. This will definitely be my go-to recipe from now on.

I have had a thing for the chicken salad at Costco for a few years now. Saw this recipe and tried it out today and all I can say is WOW! Theirs pales in comparison, and it's quite a bit less expensive to make. This will be a regular menu item for us. It's perfect for a snack and is great in wraps. Two thumbs up!!

Wonderful salad! I didn't have a green Apple or pecans so I used a tart red apple and walnuts. I wasn't sure about using dill, but am glad I did--the comments were right as the dill added an extra interesting flavor.  I will try it with green apples and pecans next time. This Recipe is a keeper!

Loved it! I didn't shred the apple- just chopped it finely because I was in an ill-equipped kitchen. I think this helped with adding crunch and didn't make it watery as some reviewers have noted. This will be my new go-to chicken salad recipe!

i wanted to try something different and had leftover grilled chicken so i chose this.. i left out the apple and subbed dried cherries for the dried cranberries, which i soaked in hot water and then chopped up.. i subbed almonds for the pecans.. i felt like something was missing so followed the lead of others and added some curry powder.. that was exactly what it needed.. i don't know if the dill would be necessary at this point though.. either way, ty for something new to me

Amazing! Small tweaks I made....Used rotisserie chicken, finely chopped red apples instead of green,  almonds instead of pecans, used lemon juice and touch of apple cider vinegar to give it a kick! Did not use Dill. Husband absolutely loved it!!! Thx!!! ;-)

Delicious!  I didn't change any of the ingredients.  I shredded the chicken because that's how we prefer it, and I diced the apple because it wouldn't shred.  I served it on slider buns from the bakery.  Definitely a keeper!

"Rachel's Cranberry Chicken Salad" is quite delicious. Next time I make it I will cut my apple-juice-sweetened cranberries by half as they were a bit sweet for my palate, and also use fresh dill. Thank you Rachel for sharing your recipe.

Wow! So good! I used premium canned white meat chicken and red onion, only because that's what I happened to have on hand. Did everything else the same as instructed. Yum!!! Delicious enough to eat on its own without bread/crackers if watching your carbs.

Made this recently for a casual party and got rave reviews. I used celery instead of the green onions and put it on a hearty wheat bread - delicious! Will be making it again soon

So many apples come into my house during apple picking season with four kids. I've been searching for more apple recipes and this one is wonderful! I didn't change a thing, but the taste is easily dictated by whatever spices you used to cook the chicken.

This recipe was fantastic! My husband and I agreed that this was the best chicken salad we have ever had. I made a few minor adjustments... I purchased a BBQ rotisserie chicken from Wegmans (easy and only 4.99) which added extra flavor, also I used glazed pecans instead of plain which also added flavor. On nice thick Tuscan bread this is a fabulous lunch.

8/2014 used slivered almonds toasted in a clean frying pan instead of pecans, used celery instead of apple and onion.  doubled the dressing and used half lime and half lemon.  cranberries were great for sweetness and almonds and celery were great for crunch.  good on soft whole grain bread.  ally liked it too.

I love this recipe and my family too. I only added jalapeño peppers to give it a kick and instead of dill I added thyme and cilantro. I mixed the herbs and spices with the mayo and then mixed it with the hard ingredients. Delish!!!!

I made the recipe as written, then let it chill very thoroughly before eating. Hubby had his on toasted burger buns with a little bit of extra mayo, to enjoy the contrast between hot and cold. It's delicious any way you serve it.  Will definitely make again.

Stop reading now if you're offended by folks who change a recipe and then rate it....  I left out the cranberries simply because I had seedless red grapes I wanted to use up instead.  I used fresh dill (again, had to use it up), a whole Jazz red apple instead of 1/4 of a green one, added minced celery, substituted almonds for the walnuts - and my husband said he thought it tasted like the chicken salad at Panera!  Pretty high praise, I think.  I didn't measure the green onion, and wish I had put in more, but other than that - wonderful recipe that lends itself to being 'customized' to whatever you have on hand!  I'm eating the leftovers as I type this at midnight.

I used a whole chicken that I inadvertently overcooked (ALWAYS set the timer). I used tarragon instead of dill, celery instead of onions, and sunflower seeds instead of pecans (as those were the ingredients I had). I did use the lime juice and thought it added a wonderful component to the dish. Rave reviews from all who tried it, so I will probably continue making it this way. If I hadn’t found this recipe, I would have never thought to put dried cranberries in chicken salad – simply delicious!

I have been searching for the ultimate chicken salad recipe & THIS is it!  I didn't have green onions (used red) but will next time for sure.  Didn't use nearly all the mayo this calls for, but that's just a personal preference. Hubs & I loved this; afterwards I realized I'd forgotten the lime juice.  Ack! Can't wait to try in again & make it ALL according to the recipe.  Thank you Rachel for the perfect blend of flavors!

This was delicious!  I especially liked to hint of curry in this recipe. People who normally disliked having apples in their chicken salad loved this one.

So yummy  I did make some changes and used what I had on hand.  Absolutely one of the best Chicken Salads we have had.  Instead of dill, I used a dash of curry, no nuts (didn't have any) diced the cranberries (prefer them small) and used lemon juice instead of lime.

Excellent recipe! Was looking for something close to what I had at a theatre in my town and this fit the bill. Left out the onion and dill. Chopped instead of shredded the apples. Didn't heave pecans so used chopped cashews in mine and my son had chopped almonds. Placed some mixed greens on a spinach wrap with the chicken salad, Delicious!!!!

Delicious and easy to throw together and is particularly good as a dip for pita chips.  I was looking for a dish to use with leftover roasted chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly.  This will be our go-to chicken salad.

We are very big fans of the Holiday Chicken Salad recipe here on AR and this recipe is very similar so I decided to try it.  I can't say that I was a big fan of this one.  I really wanted to taste the apple in it and really didn't.  I like the fruit aspect in a chicken salad.  I used fresh dill which I could taste.  I'm not sure I liked that.  Overall, this salad was edible but just not for us.  I doubt I'll make it again.

I made this for my husband's pot luck at work.  I don't even like chicken salad but this one is really good.  I liked the fact it didn't have grapes(which I don't like) so that is why I chose it.  The combination of the pecans, granny smith apple, and cranberries is fantastic!  The only change I made was due to what I had on hand.  I didn't have as much mayo as I thought so I did half mayo and half plain greek yogurt.  I also used a rotisserie chicken for flavor and easy.  Placed the chicken salad on some homemade yeast rolls and YUMMY!  My husband said the office was raving!

This is the best chicken salad I have ever eaten. The green apple, lime and FRESH dill make this a memorable dish.  I made this for a party of 10 and every one of the plates were spotless when I cleared them from the table.  Thanks for sharing your creative recipe

Just made this recipe for my lunch and even though I was missing 2 ingredients (apple and lime juice) it was still a delicious, sweet and savory combination tasting chicken salad that had a wonderful crunch from the pecans. I put it on a hearty organic whole wheat bread with a strong nutty flavor and added some crisp lettuce to make a fantastic chicken salad sandwich. I will definitely keep this as a go to when I have leftover Costco roasted chicken.

This was very easy and tasted good. I did feel it lacked a little flavor so next time I would probably increase the dill and the salt. Maybe add a little mashed avocado? Not sure. I would probably rate it at 4.5 stars if I could.

I have made this recipe several times. Simmered chicken breasts in chicken broth until tender.  Left out the apple and put in sliced red grapes.  Added a little fresh tarragon. Did not add the pecans at husband's request only!

Wow, fantastick recipe! This gives a nice sweet-savory-citrus flavor to chicken salad.  I did a rough chop on all the ingredients to have more of a "chunky" homestyle texture, which I think that way you get the juicy flavor of the apple with each bite.  One little change I made was to add just a little chopped celery (have to have my celery in chicken salad!), but I followed the recipe otherwise.  This will be my go-to recipe for chicken salad from now on.  Thanks for sharing! Absolutely wonderful!

This is absolutely a 5-star recipe.  I also add some sliced grapes for a little extra.  I've left the lime juice out a few times and found that it isn't really missed.
