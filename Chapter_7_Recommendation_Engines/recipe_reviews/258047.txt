I thought it needed more seasoning so I added some onions, jalapenos, a poblano and garnished with cilantro. Then it was real good. Hubby made a burrito out of it. Maybe next time I will add some beans too.

Easy, quick and delicious. I sauteed chopped onions along with the meat and chose to use pinto beans instead of the corn..We liked it and will use the leftovers to make burritos.

I made this for my family as written for a quick lunch and everyone loved it. I topped with pico and sour cream. This would be a good easy dish to teach kids.

I made half a batch for the two of us, and maybe I used too large a pan because there was not enough liquid to make it moist.  I had to add more.  I was thinking that maybe because I added corn straight from the cob didn't add as much moisture as frozen corn would have.  I used my Taco Seasoning I from this site.  Otherwise I did follow the recipe and the directions.  This was good, and I'll make it again with perhaps a few additions/changes.  I loved the rice mixture in it!  I will buy more of that rice!  Love it!  Thanks, Uncle Ben!

My husband is not big on this flavor of food but I love it and I'm always trying to find something he will like as much as me. Well I made this last night with some tortilla chips and he had 3 servings. I will make this again!

This was so easy and a huge winner in our house. Doubled the recipe and used UB’s Basmati Ready Rice. Will make again.

This is a very good recipe if you don't have taco shells and don't feel like running to the store. I had all the ingredients on hand. Husband went back for second helping, always a positive sign. He said "this stuff is pretty good."  I also think that this mixture could be served over a bed of lettuce, and might try it the next time I make it.

I would've given it 4 stars bc it's very salty to me, but 3/4 of my family LOVED it. Like loved it so hard that one of them took all the leftovers with them when they went home. So I guess it was great! I used ground turkey and omitted the corn. Might've been nice with some black beans in it, but it also might've turned it into another dish entirely. It was appreciated :) Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and easy! Love how quick it came together after a busy day.  I'm not a fan of wild rice so I used the original rice. This would be great with beans added and/or on top of a lettuce bed.  I topped mine with sour cream and scallions, and a little taco sauce... then scooped into tortilla chips.  I wasn't familiar with this rice product but love it and will definitely use again! Versatile, easy, quick , tasty recipe!

I made this exactly as listed on recipe and it turned out amazing.  A great play on the taco.  Amazing flavors in an easy to make recipe.  This will be added to my taco Tuesday rotation.

A great recipe to make ahead of time or for a busy night. Uncle Ben's rice cooks so fast than in a very few minutes you get a great meal. I fried with the meat some sliced onions, one chopped garlic clove and a sliced poblano pepper.  I didn't get to drain any water, maybe, as other review suggested, my pan was to big for the amount of meat.  Some of us made tacos with it, others burritos and also we scooped the meat with tortilla chips. Definitely I'm making this recipe again.

This was great. Quick and easy for a busy night. I served with tortilla chips but my daughter put hers in a soft taco tortilla and that is how everyone ended up eating theirs. I left out the corn and used peppers and onions instead since I'm not a fan of corn. Also topped with a bit of Chipotle sauce. Yummy!

6.27.17  This recipe has lots of potential for varying ingredients, texture, and flavor as I think you’ll see just by the comments of previous reviewers.  I did add some chopped fresh jalapeno and some hot sauce to spice it up a bit and served with crunchy tri-color tortilla strips on the top (unfortunately, forgot to put them on when I took the photo).  On one of those evenings when you’re totally bummed out and just don’t feel like cooking, this one’s so easy (and tasty) that I think you’ll find the time.   We really liked it!

I wasn't very impressed with this.   It needed more flavor.   It was kind of blah.   I made it as directed.

I'll admit I was a little apprehensive to adding rice to a taco skillet, but, we really liked it!  All the flavors paired well together and was an easy and inexpensive meal to make.  I did add some fresh cilantro and think I would add some pickled jalapenos next time.

The reason I chose this was to show my daughter, who is in college, that quick, easy, and inexpensive can be  good too. This recipe took all of 10 minutes to make and was delicious. Instead of an entree I used the little tortilla cups and made it into a dish that we could all share. I also I did not use the pre-packaged taco seasoning. Those are always way too salty for me so I made my own. If it were just me I would add some heat to this dish. If you are ever in a time crunch and want to make something that yummy save this recipe. It would make a great dish to eat while watching the big game/race on the weekends too.

This recipe is a keeper!  It's so easy and tasty.  I swear the 90 minute rice side dishes are the best thing since sliced bread.  We loved this.

Super quick and delish dinner! I made it as written and served it with diced tomatoes, sour cream, added cheese and lots of hot sauce. Perfect after a long day to just whip up! I really love these Uncle Ben's 90 seconds rice packs. They are a staple for us now since we've discovered them.

I rarely if ever follow recipe directions and usually I'm known to change ingredients (while sticking as close to the original recipe) and this recipe was not an exception. I didn't have ground beef, so I used beef stew meat and seasoned it with a taco seasoning from a local spice shop. I cooked it in my instant pot for 30 minutes and then shredded the beef. I added the rice, corn and also threw in some black beans and cooked it on high pressure for 7 minutes. I mixed in the cheese, and added the green onions. I also served it with a bit of sour cream. This may not be what I would view as a taco skillet, maybe nachos.,.but it was yummy!

Super easy and very flavorful. I usually add garlic powder, salt, and pepper to every recipe, but didn't have to touch this one! The taco seasoning and wild rice give it just enough flavor.

I really liked the texture and taste of the taco meat with the added wild rice. The Ready Rice are so quick to make too. They only take 90 seconds in the microwave. I read the first review for the recipe that said they left out the corn. I didn't care for the idea of the corn in taco meat either. So, I used BQ's suggestion and added olives but as a garnish. I also served with small red beans and topped the taco meat with Taco Bell store brand taco sauce at the table. I would suggest some type of taco sauce or salsa. This makes a complete and filling meal. Really any taco salad ingredients or vegetables would go great. I used reduced sodium Taco Bell brand taco seasoning. I also didn't add any salt, pepper, or seasonings. The wild rice and taco packet has plenty. Thanks, so much. I liked this concept and will make this again.

Fantastic and super easy to make. The wild rice is a genius addition. I didn't add corn, didn't have any. I added black olives.
