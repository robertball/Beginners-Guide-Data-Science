This was great. The first time around, I made it as is (4 stars.) The second time, I changed the following 3 things: I omitted the water completely, swapped the mayo out for ricotta cheese and toasted the bread in the baking dish before topping it with the cheese/sauce. The bread was still soft but not overly mushy. Everyone cleaned their plates and wanted more!

I made exactly according to recipe.  I enjoyed that there weren't any "cream of" soups in this.  The recipe does need a little work.  The bread on the bottom came out very soggy making for an unappealing texture.  Otherwise, the flavor is great and the meatballs are perfect.  Next time i will probably toast the bread while assembling the other layers.

How can review a recipe you have never tried, are you professional chef, actually try the recipe before you review it.

Delicious but incredibly rich. Next time I will probably swap cooked pasta for the bread. Thanks!

Try it this way--toast the bread, top with cream cheese mixture, mozzarella,  meatballs heated with sauce, and remaining mozzarella.  Broil till melted and bubbly.

This was a huge hit with the fam!!!  So good.  I used the pre made fresh meatballs from the meat dept at the grocery but rerolled them smaller so they'd be closer to 1 inch like the recipe says.  Followed everything else exactly.  Super easy and delicious!  Great meal to bring to others.

Made it but wife didn't care for the taste of the mayo .  I added a pack of Italian dressing seasoning to the meatballs and did a half pork sausage, half ground sirloin mix.

I was in a crunch for time when I made this casserole so i skipped making the homemade meatballs and tried the pre-made fresh Italian Meatballs at the meat counter at WalMart and cooked them myself.  I also toasted/baked some frozen Texas Garlic Toast.  This recipe was awesome and so easy to put together.  the spread over the breadslices is soooo rich and creamy its makes this dish a winner.  Will definitely make this again.

Made some adjustments: cut bread into crouton sized pieces and seasoned with garlic powder and oregano then toasted them in the oven. After they were toasted I tossed them with the cream cheese/mayo mixture. I also left out the water entirely.

We donâ€™t like meatballs, so I just brown the ground beef and it turns out great. I have made it several times.

Comfort food in a pan.  What could be better.  We used a couple of suggested edits from reviewers and a couple personal taste tweaks and the resulting dish is a perfect way to warm up on a cold evening.  I cut the bread into large cubes and layer them in the pan which I put into the oven while it preheats for the  meatballs so they keep some texture.  I used ricotta instead of mayo and although I don't care for it my BF is such a big fan and it really works in this.  Lastly we also left out the extra water and put a layer of pickled banana pepper on top the meatballs and under the cheese just because we love them.

I made this casserole last night for dinner with a bunch of meatballs I had left over from Spaghetti and Meatballs (Meatball Nirvana also from this site), with a few changes made as recommended by many other reviewers.  First, I used my own meatballs; second, I bought a loaf of french garlic bread and toasted it on both sides so as to avoid the reported sogginess (to the point of being more like croutons); Third, I eliminated the water all together; Fourth, I used Fresh Mozzarella cheese (not packed in any liquid, but just fresh) and last change I made was to use Ricotta cheese instead of the Mayo.  I baked the casserole until the cheese was melted and bubbly.  The smell and taste was fabulous HOWEVER, the bread, although toasted very well, was soupy.  Because of this, the meal was just unappetizing.  Although, the taste was very good, the soggy bread ruined the entire casserole.  My husband did go back for seconds, however, he just scraped off the top of the casserole, taking just the meatballs and cheese.  The Ricotta cheese instead of the Mayo was an outstanding recommendation.  Thanks for the recommendation.

I leave out the onion (I just don't like onion). Other than this minor change, YUM! The cream cheese/mayo really make this casserole. I've made it many, many times.

Glad I read the notes from other people before making it.  Replaced the mayo with ricotta and eliminated the water all together in the sauce. Toasted my bread real good before spreading the cream cheese/ricotta mixture.  Also increased hamburger to 2 pounds, and doubled all the other ingredients. Turned out very yummy... Family loved it!

I've made this several times over the years and it's a big hit every time. I use frozen meatballs to make it quick & otherwise follow the recipe exactly. A big, fattening, yummy casserole! Great for pot lucks.
