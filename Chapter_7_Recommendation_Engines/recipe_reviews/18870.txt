I read all the reviews prior to making this dish and share the following: I did add the dash of lemon juice and the balsamic vinegar to the marinade as suggested by one reviewer; I also added two cups of water to the pan when I roasted the lamb.  I followed the advise to cover loosely with a foil "tent" and cooked the meat for 20 minutes at 450, turning it down to 350 for 1 hour before putting the heat up to 400, removing the foil and continued to cook for a further 10 - 15 minutes.  Roast was medium; I would cook about 10 minutes less at 350 to have a medium rare roast.  As also suggested I took all the marinade (cooked with the roast), added a little red wine and red currant jelly.  The roast was left to rest for 10 minutes and carved before serving with the sauce poured over.  It was absolutely delicious.  Sue from Richmond Hill

Taste buds went to heaven! We used a boneless leg of lamb, just under 7lbs. We added 1/4 c Balsamic vinegar, 1/4 c olive oil, and substituted 1 teaspoon lemon juice in place of lemon zest. We slit the roast about an inch deep all over the top and inserted lots of slivers of fresh garlic; marinated for 2 days and sprinkled with regular salt.  We placed the lamb on a rack in a covered roasting pan, added cut up potatoes and carrots, baked at 350 for 2 hours, basting every 20 - 30 minutes. We didn't need to place marinade in the middle as others suggested, and also didn't need to add water to the bottom of the pan.  We will add at least one cup of water to make gravy in the future. Moist, flavorful dish! The ingredients were a perfect blend.

Very tasty for you lamb lovers!  We added a squirt of lemon juice and 1 tbsp. balsalmic vinegar to the marinade.  Baked the lamb with the marinade in an oven bag for 2 hours at 300 degrees.  It was super tender!  Took 2c of the fat drippings and cooked up a sauce with 1c. milk, 1tbsp cornstarch, rosemary twigs, and 1tsp balsalmic vinegar, salt/pepper to taste.  A superb sauce/gravy for the lamb.  We'll use this recipe again!

My first attempt at lamb. It was fabulous. I did put an aluminum foil tent on the leg of lamb during the first twenty minutes so it would not char..I then roasted it at 350 for 1 and 1/2 hours or until my instant read thermometer read 130 (or medium rare). I added two cups of water to the roasting pan. I read the reviews on this recipe and they were right on. I marinated it for two days, the taste was fantastic. My father in law, who loves lamb, said this was the best lamb he ever had! Another point, worth mentioning, is that I purchased an "American Lamb" versus a "New Zealand Lamb". I read up on lamb in the "Joy Of Cooking" and they stated an American lamb is more tender and sweet then other lambs. I had twelve people for dinner this Easter and they all loved it! Thanks!

made this recipe for easter dinner. my wife didn't want me to do it because it wasn't her mothers recipe. she only eats lamb one day a year and wanted it to be good. she loved it even though it wasn't her mother's lamb. the cooking temperature scared me though, so it roasted to perfection at 350 for 20 minutes a pound, 135 degrees on a meat thermometer. next time it will roast at 300 degrees. it should be more evenly cooked at the lower temperature. the marinade makes for a rich savory gravy. it would be hard to improve on this recipe.

I too followed the advice of another member and put all the ingredients in the blender. Then I took a pastry brush and "painted" it on the roast.  I think this made it much easier to handle.  A couple of problems I had.  I watched the time very closely but the top of the roast did burn.  I beleive that this roast is cooked at too high of a temperature.  Normal roasting time is lower temp (325) for 2 1/2 hours.  I think that is what I will do next time as my roast would not cook through and I finally ended up lowering the temperature (because the top was burning) and I let it cook another hour.  Other than that, I thought the marinade was pretty good.

Wow. This was my first roast lamb, and it was spectacular! I made it for Easter dinner and it was perfectly caramelized on the outside, and pink and juicy and tender on the inside, with such a wonderful flavor from the marinade. I used a boneless, tied roast (about 5 lbs.), the lemon juice from the lemon I zested, a splash or two of soy sauce, and a dash of balsamic vinegar. Marinated over night, roasted 20 minutes at 425, then turned down to 350 for remainder of the time. Poured 2 cups of water to the pan, and basted with the leftover marinade a couple of times while cooking. Used a foil "tent" when I noticed it getting too brown. I also used a meat thermometer to check for doneness. Will make this again!!

Great, I cooked mine in an oven bag to enhance the flavour and avoid the marinade burning. Have made this several times.

Lamb is a favorite around our household, but had always been reserved for dinners at restaurants. I was nervous about cooking lamb, but not anymore. This lamb was wonderful, it marks the first time my boyfriend has not had any suggestions for changing the recipe. I did follow several other peoples advice and cooked it at a lower temperature (320 degrees) on the lowest rack in my oven. I also put an tent over it after it was brown to prevent it from charring. Also I made a sauce from the reserved marinade and the pan drippings that was a perfect compliment to the meat and the vegtables I served with the lamb.

This lamb roast was delicious.  I put garlic cloves inside the roast to help add to the flavor of the meat.  I initially roasted it at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes, then at 350 minutes for the rest of the time.  A 145 degree internal temperature is too low, the roast was very pink(almost red)through out.  I will try an internal temperature of 160 degrees next time I make this recipe.  Also I will add water to the bottom of the pan to help prevent the sauce from burning up on the bottom of the pan.

I have never cooked, baked, roasted or served leg of lamb before.  This year, I had 15 people to dinner, four of whom are lamb perfectionist and decided that along with the traditional turkey dinner, I would surprise them and serve lamb. For weeks, I scoured the internet for a recipe so I would not disappoint them with their lamb for Easter dinner.  I found this recipe and read the many reviews. I bought an organic spring leg of lamb from New Zealand. I decided to use this recipe, but like a couple of other readers, I used lemon juice instead of zest, added olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the overnight marinade.  I roasted it at 300 for 3 hours in a convection oven, it was 7 pounds. It was pink at the bone and medium everywhere else.  When it was time to serve it, I added fig jam to the drippings and poured it over the carved lamb on the platter.  This was a HUGE HIT!  Nobody could believe I had never cooked lamb before as it was so tender and tasty. I was still getting compliments as my guests were going out the door.  Even my husband, who does not like lamb, tried it and he loved it as well.  Great recipe and it will now be added to our annual Easter Dinner menu.  Thank you...

I used these ingredients to roast a de-boned leg of lamb, this past Christmas lunch.  It was *delicious*, even though I could only marinate it for a few hours prior to roasting (I had not found a recipe I liked until the morning of Christmas).  This is a delicious rub and you will not be disappointed with this recipe.  My whole family loved this lamb. Kudos! 

The only changes I made were to pour a cup of water in the bottom of the pan, then roast at 450°F for 10 minutes, flip, cook for 10 more minutes, flip, then reduce heat to 325°F, flipping every 20 minutes. These instructions were found in the Julia Child, Volume 2, as well as the Cooks Illustrated cookbooks.  

450°F is necessary to sear a crust, sealing juices inside and preventing the leg from drying out. Reducing to 325°F ensures a tender meat inside.  I cooked to internal temp of 120°F at the very center, while the edges were already at 140°F.  As the leg of lamb sat, it the center raised to 130°F, just like Julia said it would :) . Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Delicious.  I usually am not a big fan of lamb, but this was excellent.  I added a little lemon juice and balsamic vinegar to the marinade as suggested by others.  Added about 1 cup of water to the roasting pan, and then when the lamb was resting - I added about 1/2 cup of red wine to the sauce and thickened it with a little bit of cornstarch mixed in water.  Excellent.  Even my 10 year old son who doesn't usually eat his meat, ate his all up.  The sauce definitely makes this great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Mmmmmm!  This was the most amazing marinade-- brought out the flavor of the lamb, and kept it so juicy.  I cooked a small piece of lamb, on the bone-- just about 2 pounds, not a whole leg, but a piece of one (just two of us).  I did it at 450 for 15 minutes to crisp, then took out of the oven, added a 1/4 cup of water to the marinade and juices, and covered with a tent of foil.  Put it back in to cook for another 25 minutes at 350, and it turned out just perfect-- juicy and medium rare.  My husband took one bite and declared it spectacular-- I have to agree completely!!  Thanks for this recipe, really wonderful.

I bought a 3.3 lb roast and used the same amount of marinade.  I wanted to marinate overnight, however, fell asleep before getting to it.  I marinated a total of 5 hours.  Cooked in a roasting pan with rack, 450 degrees uncovered for 20 minutes then 350 degrees covered for 1 hour 20 minutes.  Make sure to add 2-4 cups of water to bottom of pan.  I added a combo of water and the marinade.  I let the roast sit for 15 minutes before serving.  I made gravy from the drippings.  Very yummy!  My husband does not normally eat lamb and this was the best dish of the meal!  Absolutely delicious!  Thank you!!!

I love this marinade. I usually add extra garlic by cutting into the meat and inserting slivers. This is one of my favorite meals. Also, I've never marinaded overnight - I usually do it day of. Sometimes as little as an hour and it still tastes wonderful.

This recipe is too die for!  I used a boneless leg for this recipe.  The marinade is perfect as is, I wouldn't add the balsamic vinegar or lemon juice as others have suggested.  I did put my marinade in my "magic bullet" for a couple of pulses to chop the rosemary and garlic more and to infuse the flavors better.  I let it marinate overnight and put marinade in the center of the leg as well.  I started my roast at 400 degrees instead of 450.  It would probably have been just fine or even better if you just roast it at 325 degrees the whole time.  Starting at a high heat for a portion of the time can decrease the amount of "medium rare" meat on the inside because the outside gets heated too much.  I basted mine during the cooking process and did add a cup of water to the pan to give it a bit more liquid for basting.  It didn't leave much liquid at the end but plenty for basting.  This roast, served with mint jelly and oven roasted fingerling potatoes is the perfect sunday meal.  I am still dreaming about it!

Lamb is a special treat for us.  We usually try to have lamb for Passover, and the Feast of Tabernacles. When I see one marked down I buy it and keep it in the freezer for these special occasions.  Well...here it is, The Feast of Tabernacles and we were six at our table.  Sure enough I had a six pound semi boneless leg of lamb just waiting for us.  I prepared a double recipe of the marinade and poked a whole bulb of garlic cloves into the meet.  I used my "set it, and foreget it" rottisere.  I roasted it for one hour, forty five minutes, after sitting it room temperature for about an hour.  I probably could have removed it a few minutes earlier had I used a thermometer. But I must tell you it was absolutly the most delicious leg of lamb.  Our guest devowered all but two or three pieces.  I'm happy that its left over so hubby and I can enjoy it again this evening.  By the way our little dog "Chai" (Life in Hebrew), is having a great time with the bone...happy girl.  Yes, please do try the recipe and use lots of garlic!  Thankx for the GREAT recipe.

My husband grew up eating lamb often because his family owned their own butcher shop and said this was the best lamb dinner he ever ate. The marinade is a winner! I used a 3 lb boneless leg of lamb. Made the marinade as written except I used no lemon & added 1 tablspn of olive oil. Boneless allowed me to open the leg up and get the marinade inside of the lamb and then I rolled and tied it back up. I only marinated for 5 hours in a zip lock bag and I can't imagine it being any better. I cooked at 450 for 20 min then reduced to 325 for 25 min then increased heat to 350 for 35 min. I used digital thermometer & cooked until temp was 140. Rested for 15 min. It was slightly pink and super juicy. I also added 2 cups of water to pan during cooking but next time I will add 3 1/2 cups. I don't even like lamb but I couldn't resist tasting it and I loved it. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I am no longer afraid to cook lamb :)

I tried some of the alternative cooking methods and ingredients that other posters recommended.  But I ended up doing the cooking differently from what others suggested and it came out fabulous! I would make this again!
To the marinade i added: 1/4 c honey, 1/4 c balsamic vinegar, 1 teaspoon lemon juice (instead of zest), 1/4 c olive oil. Keep leftover marinade for basting. I sliced little holes in the top of the roast and put sliced garlic cloves in holes.
Place roast in uncovered roasting pan, fill the bottom of the pan with water, not too much but enough to keep the drippings from burning in the pan. Do not cover roast. 
Make sure you place your oven rack so the  roast itself is in the middle of the oven - not the ovenrack. Roasting pans raise the meat so be sure to place the roast so the top of your roast is in the the middle of the oven. 
Preheat oven to 425, cook for 20 minutes. Lower oven temp to 350, check meat, use extra marinade to baste meat, add water to pan if necessary. 

I checked the temp and basted with marinade every 25 minutes. You will probably have to add a little water everytime you check the meat. Otherwise the drippings will burn and smoke which is not what you want. 
The meat took about 2 hours or so to be medium rare. The great thing with the roast was that the ends were medium and the middle was medium rare so if you have multiple people over this would be very beneficial.
let rest for 5-10 minutes.

I thought this was a brilliant marinade. My roast (2.5 lbs.) turned out lovely and I only marinated it for 6 hours. I too added balsamic and I believe that makes a big difference. I also used dried and fresh rosemary. I think that 450 degrees is far too hot, especially if your roast is not 5 lbs or larger. It's no wonder the extra sauce burns at the bottom of the pan!? I think 350 is best and maybe brown at 400 to start for 10 mins. Anyway, I'll run this recipe again. Oh, and don't be afraid to buy a leg with some FAT on it. That's where the flava is. Excellent.

I've used this recipe a number of times and each time it comes out delicious! I like to butterfly a boneless leg of lamb and spread the marinade over the entire piece and then roll it up and tie it with cotton string. I then cover the rolled up lamb with more of the marinade. (This works really well when you don't have time to marinate the lamb)I put it on a roasting rack and cover it loosely with foil. Be ready for LOTS of rave reviews!!  This also works great with a pork tenderloin too.

This was excellent. I made only slight alterations to the recipes. I injected garlic cloves into the meat. I also lowered my oven to 325 immediately when I put the lamb in. No other modifications. Used a thermometer to check doneness. Very flavorful. I will certainly make this again.

This recipe turned out to be an awesome find. however i did a few modifications. To the marinade I added a tbs of spicy mustard and a tbs of horseraddish. i too let it marinade for two days. i put some red baslamic vinegar olive oil and worcestershire onions in the bottom of the pan. with the drippings from the marinade it made a wonderful gravy. Everyone loved it. i did only cook at 375 for 1hr and 20 minutes.

This was an excellent recipe.  I have never made lamb before and was a little wary of how successful I would be.  Always thought lamb was something I got at a restaurant cause I couldn't make it myself.  This was so easy and delicious.  I made it for guests and they couldn't believe it was my first time ever making lamb.

I took the marinade and made a sauce that was so delicious you could have eaten it with a spoon.  Lamb was excellent!!  I cooked at 350 for 30 minutes and then turned down to 300.

GREAT recipe!  I made this --rather, a variation of it-- tonight and got rave reviews from the husband and teen-age son.  
Modifications:
I cut slits around the meat and underneath the fat-cap to insert slivers of the garlic clove and some shallots that I had sliced.
I ground pepper, sea salt, dried rosemary, sage (didn't have thyme), and fresh lemon zest together and whisked these with the olive oil, 1T of Dijon (German stone-ground) mustard, 1 T Worcestershire sauce, and the juice of 1 lemon in a small bowl.  Using a basting brush I liberally coated the meat in all the folds and outside.  I also basted the roast twice with this mixture.  (I added the rest to the glaze/sauce later.)
I also tucked some fresh oregano leaves into the folds of the meat before I tied it back together.  
I tented the tinfoil over the 5.5 Lb. boneless roast and baked at 350°F for 3 hours until perfectly done. 
In a small sauce pan over medium heat, I combined the drippings with 1T of cornstarch and whisked well (I had about 3/4 of a cup of drippings).   I then added the 1/4 c. of balsamic vinegar and the left-over basting spice (about 1/2T).  The glaze was very strong so I did not pour it over the meat, letting the guys chose how much they wanted.
I served this with roasted potatoes & carrots and biscuits.  I would've done a salad, but the guys didn't want one.  
Thanks for the recipe & all the tips from other reviewers!!  I will make this one again.  :-D

This was my very first time making roast leg of lamb, we decided to do it for Easter and it was just fantastic! Use the calculator to approximate the ingredients you need for the cut of leg you get, but you can't mess up this recipe, it's nearly fool-proof.  I did do two modifications, I did not have any honey on hand so used fresh maple syrup instead. I also oiled the roasting pan and created a bed of the thickly sliced red onions, and chopped up some fresh sage and sprinkled that over the onions. Placed the marinated leg of lamb over that and put that in the oven. The lamb juices and fat will melt off the meat and will literally caramelize the onions. Our dinner party finished it up VERY quickly. I accompanied it with mashed sweet potatoes sweetened with fresh maple syrup and steamed asparagus. A shiraz or merlot will go beaitifully with this.

Wow!  This is the very best lamb I've ever eaten!  I added balsamic vinegar to the marinade, as suggested by one reviewer, & also put lots of slivers of garlic in it(lamb isn't lamb without garlic).  I had a 4.5 lb. boneless leg, which I started at 450° for 20 minutes.  My stove has a temperature probe & wanted to cook the roast at 325°, so I tried that.  It took another 1.75 hours to get to 160° internal temperature.  There were a few places where the marinade was very dark, but not charred.  The meat was perfect, very flavorful & I did not experience any of the problems reported by others.  I served this with Apricot Ginger Couscous (also on this site), a combo made in heaven.  I would rate this higher than 5 if that were available.

I just made this.. my family loved it. I used boneless lamb shoulder (about 4 lbs). I also added some balsamic vinegar and lemon juice. I cooked it at 450 degrees for 20 minutes.. then I covered it with foil at 325 degrees for 1 hr and 15 minutes for medium rare... at 140 degree internal temperature... I came out perfect! Very moist on the inside and seared on the outside... I also rolled the lamb back up into a log...

The marinade was excellent and even as a gravy after the roast is finished. The first time I made this according to the recipe, I overcooked the lamb. The second time I made this recipe, I kept turning the lamb every 20 minutes to ensure even cooking. Then took it out of the oven when the temperature was about 125-130 degrees. It came out perfect.

delish!  I added a splash of balsamic & lemon as suggested, not sure it made that drastic a difference, but it was fantastic.  I turned it over once when it started to brown up then covered with foil once the rest was getting brown.  Baked til 135 degrees and it was a delightful medium rare, my husband said, "Is this really lamb?  It's the BEST lamb I've ever had!"  Yes it is!  Left-overs worked quite nicely into The Supreme Shepherd's Pie from this site.

Marinated lamb overnight with this marinade was a bit worried about the dijon as not a fan but wow what a taste.  Amazing attack on the tastebuds.

Really great marinade. This lamb went over really well and is definitely a dish I will make when I have guests to impress! My minor changes, based on other reviews: I used lemon juice instead of zest, and I added splashes of balsamic and olive oil, as well. I also inserted slivers of garlic into the meat. I halved the recipe, since I had just over 2 pounds of lamb. I cooked at 450 for 15 minutes with a foil tent, and then cooked for about 50 minutes at 350 withou the tent. I might cook it for a little less next time, since we like our lamb fairly rare.

This recipe was good, but not my favorite.  Next time I think I will use less rosemary and maybe more of my favorite herbs and spices and add a bit more liquid (such as worcestershire or soy sauce), but all around a great recipe.  I followed the recipe as it was written except I did not follow the cooking directions.  I had marinated the meat for about 12-16 hours, and got up Easter morning at 2 AM, and put the lamb in the oven covered with aluminum foil at 225 degrees and slow cooked it for 8 hours.  It came out so juicy, and tender it was falling off of the bone.  We could not even slice it!  I bake all of my roasts the same way except when I make them in the slow cooker!!

This was really delicious. I was on a shortened schedule, so I only marinated for 4 hours, but it still turned out delicious. I also took the other reviewers' recommendations on temperature. The first 20 minutes was at 425 vs. 450. The rest of the time was at 350 for about 60 minutes, and it turned out a perfect medium rare. You just have to have a good meat thermometer and keep a close eye near the end, as it can go from medium rare -> medium -> medium well really fast.

very nice flavor. Be sure to follow others' suggestions re: cooking temp/time and putting water in the pan.   I seared at 450 for 20 minutes and then slow-roasted at 325 for another 2 hours or so under a foil tent (I had a bone in leg, so mine took longer to cook). I checked every 20 min or so near the end with a meat thermometer and basted each time. For that last 10 min I removed the foil tent and it browned up nicely without drying out. The drippings + the water at the bottom of the pan made a perfect au jus. We didn't bother making it into gravy. We served it with strawberry spinach salad II  & deviled eggs for an appetizer.

So deLISHous!!! The best lamb I've ever made! Seriously! 
I followed some of the suggestions of those who have gone before me. I added 1/4 balsamic vinegar and the juice from the lemon I zested. I put the marinade in my cuisanart first then marinated the leg for a day in a ziplock baggie. I cooked it for 20 minutes at 450 with a foil tent.  Then at 350 for about 2 hours with the tent on about half of that time. I also marinated it every 30 minutes. After resting for 10 minutes the meat was between med-rare to medium. I also roasted small potatoes and brussels sprouts with it.  This is definitely a new family favorite!!

Wow! So tender and delicious! This was my first time making lamb and it was perfect. The only thing I would have changed is to cover it with foil so that the top didn't char. Aside from that-delicous!

Added balsamic vinegar to marinade.  Used two 6 pound legs of lamb and doubled the marindade.  Marinated each leg in a large plastic bag for 24 hours.  Tented lamb for first 30 minutes at 420, then lowered temperature to 350 and cooked for an hour, then removed tent and raised temp back to 420 for 30 minutes.  I also added diced potatoes to the pan while roasting.  Lamb came out perfect.  I cooked for a hungry and knowledgeable crowd, and got rave reviews from everyone.  Lamb was tender and juicy.  There were some well-done pieces on the ends, and some rare pieces in the middle, with perfectly medium rare to medium pieces throughout.  Flavor was perfect!  To do over, I would not change a thing to the marinade, meaning I would not add balsamic.  I also would tent 30 minutes less at 350, not add the potatoes to the pan, and baste the lamb with the juices every 15 minutes.  With these modifications this will be a gourmet recipe to add to anyone's collection!!!

I also added lemon juice and balsalmic vinegar to the marinade. I let the roast marinate for 24 hrs turning it often. When roasting I also added 2 cups of water to the pan and put white and sweet potato wedges in the pan with roast sitting on rack. My husband and sons gave this rave reviews as in amazing! I followed the cooking directions that came with the lamb which called for slightly lower temps and less cooking time and it came out perfect. I also made a gravy with some red wine and flour and water. We will never eat lamb any other way.

I followed a lot of the reviews to tweak this recipe because I was making it for Easter and didn't have room for mistakes. I used the thermometer and cooked it more well-done. It pleased even my guests who normally don't like to eat lamb. )I read the top 3 most helpful reviews focusing on the heat and moisture components).

Excellent flavour!  For those who prefer a more meaty taste, use a leg of goat (actually - kid), the flavour is only a little stronger and the meat is low cholesterol. Another alternative is to use apricot juice in place of honey.  The fruit acid cuts the greasyness of lamb - cooking slowly at low temp gives best results.

Fantastic! Was a perfect Christmas eve meal and made for a couple of days of delicious leftovers.  I used an electronic meat thermometer to ensure a perfect, slightly pink center.

Delicious! This is the first time I have roasted a leg of lamb. I added the 1 tsp of balsamic vinaigrette and substituted the 1 tsp of lemon juice for the zest. I also added meat tenderizer to my leg of lamb since I marinated it early in the morning for dinner that night.

The entire family enjoyed this recipe, even those who do not care for lamb.  Unless you like rare lamb make sure it's cooked above 145 degrees.

AWESOME recipe!  I wish I could give this recipe more stars.

I made this for Christmas dinner, along with a turkey.  The lamb was ready a bit before the turkey and when I took it out of the oven everyone (all our children and family were here) came into the kitchen to see what the delicious aroma was.  Two people had never eaten lamb.. and wouldn't - until I prepared this recipe.

I put the meat on a cutting board and let it sit and told everyone they could take a taste, if they like.  Well, the lamb never made it to the table.  Everyone, even the non-lamb eaters loved it.  I can't wait to make this recipe again.

Thanks for a great recipe.  Everyone took the recipe home with them.

This was our first experience with lamb. I purchased a 4 lb boneless leg and took off the twine before marinating. That was the first mistake. The leg was difficult to keep together. I combined all of the ingredients in a ziplock bag, put the lamb in the bag and rubbed the ingredients all over like I would have for a steak. That was the second mistake. While the ingredients did make it all around the leg, they did not disperse as much as I would like, especially the rosemary. As we are not fans of medium rare meat, I kept the leg in the oven until the internal temp was 155 and let it stand for 15 more minutes until the temp was 160. The taste of the marinade did not overwhelm the taste of the meat. For those who've never made this before, lamb tastes like a cross between a juicy slice of pork and really good roast beef. I don't know how else to explain it. It was very juicy and tasted delicious despite my mistakes. HAHA! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a heavenly dish!  I have never cooked a lamb leg before and this was outstanding!  My husband was very, very impressed.  I added 2 cups of water to the bottom of the pan as suggested by others, cooked it at 400F covered for 20 min. and then at 350F for 1 hr 45 min, turning the meat over every 15-20 min.  I did not tent it with foil since the baking dish came with a lid.  For gravy, I added a bit of red wine and some corn starch mixed with water.  The gravy was delicious but a little too strong tasting so next time I will water it down some.  Excellent over mashed potatoes.  I'm curious to try it next time with lemon juice and balsamic vinegar in the marinade, openning the leg up and putting the marinade in the middle, marinating for 2 days instead of 1 and then tying up the leg before baking.  What can I say, I read a lot of the reviews and plan to combine several of the great ideas submitted by others!

Didn't have time to marinate overnight.  Took the meat out of the freezer at about 11am, thawed in microwave, then put all ingredients with meat to marinate in one of those oven bags for about 4 hours.  Instructions for the baking bag say not to cook over 400f, so that';s what I did - cooked at 400f for about 2hrs.  Opened the bag about 3/4 of the way through and added 1c water.  Result: Pink in the centre...delicious, tender, flavorful - raves from company.  
For a gravy (or sauce) I added a mixture of about 1tbsp cornstarch and 1/4 c water to thicken and added (as per another reviewer) a couple of tbsp Balsamic vinegar.  Excellent accompaniment. Excellent dinner which I served with a salad, homemade rolls, roasted potatoes, stir fried asparagus and homemade mint jelly.  The jelly I made according to the first reviewer for Mint Sauce but I added an envelope of Knox gelatin because my husband doesn't like the watery stuff.

Loved the Marinade my roast was only 3.5 pounds but used the whole marinade and a touch of lemon Juice - marinated for 24 hours and then roasted.  DELISH and my DH thinks so too.  I read all comments b4 making so roasted at a slower heat.  Have to comment about Lamb roast leg sizes, anything larger than 5 or 6 pounds has to be a hogget not a lamb so of course will need more marination - Older :-)

SO DELICIOUS.  I had lamb chops for the first time four months ago and I really didn't care for them, so I was hesitant to try this recipe, but my husband loves lamb, so I went for it.  I must say...this is a MOST SUCCULENT lamb dish.  So good!  I gave it four stars only because I cooked it at 325 degrees for about two and a half hours and it still came out nice and done on the outside (I like my lamb well done).  I think cooking it at 450 degrees would have burned it too much.  I will be using this recipe for years to come.  Thank you.

I followed the recipe for the marinade but roasted it on the Showtime Rotisserie at 30 min per pound and I have never had better roast lamb.  My family all agreed, too, that it was the very best.  Juicy and beautifully flavored.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner, my first lamb. It was a huge success. Again,the same complaint about the charred top, needs to be watched when cooking or on the lowest rack for 425' and cooked on 375' for 1HR with at least 1 cup of water at the bottom of the pan. Other than that it was delicious.

I make Lamb Shanks all the time but I wanted to switch it up and do a leg of lamb recipe. I checked the web for a good LOL (my acronym for Leg of Lamb... Just made that up) and found this one. OMG (Nope, didn't make that one up. Hehe), this is absolutely succulent. Like others, I added about 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and fresh lemon juice (one lemon) to the marinade recipe. I baked mine in a cast iron Dutch oven (by Martha Stewart) and added a cup of water to the bottom of it before I put the LOL (going to copyright that) in. I put the lid 3/4 on roasted that baby at 375 for almost 3 hours. I basted it regularly and flipped it over to cook on the other side (which is why I think it was so juicy throughout) for the last hour. I like my roast well done, so you may want to reduce your cook time to 2 hours if you like it on the pink side. I actually didn't have time to marinade this over night, but it was a home run just the same. I paired this up with some black eyed peas cooked in smoked turkey, whipped candied yams, brown rice and cornbread. The Mister might give me a ring after this one (LOL...Laughing Out Loud, not eating on a Leg Of Lamb.. Hehe) because he loved it. Seriously, though, wicked good recipe. I'm adding this one to my catalog for sure. Enjoy!

Delicious! We will definitely make this again.  The temperature is all wrong, though!  After the first 15 minutes at 450 degrees reduce the temperature to 350 degrees.  The temperature of 400 degrees is way to hot for a roast.

Enjoyed this meal at Christmas; the combination of seasonings for the marinate was very flavorful and the roast turned out pretty moist and tender.  Will certainly use this rec again, so encourage you to try it also.  Thanks for the post!

AMAZING!!!  I only marinated it for 4 hours and it still came out incredibly tasty.  My guests were totally amazed.  I added the balsamic vinegar and lemon juice (no zest).  I accompanied it with the Oven Roasted Potatoes recipe in this website and it was a total success.  I made an aioli to go with both and baked some crusty Italian bread.  Plum upside down desert from Chez Panise's cook book.  What a hit!  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe, a definite keeper to impress guests!

I read many of the reviews before starting. First I used a butterflied leg of lamb. I spread the marinade on the meat side; chilled for four hours; then I took it out,used some twine to tie the leg closed with the marinade inside.I took the marinate that spilled out and used a brush to coat the outside of the lamb. Sprinkled some kosher salt and dried thyme and rosemary on the outside, then placed back in the frig overnight. Once lamb sat out for about an hour to bring up to room temperature, I placed on a roasting rack with a pan of water underneath; roasted for 20 minutes at 400, then turned down to 325 until internal temp reached about 135. I used an external thermometer that was set to go off at 135 then took the lamb out to rest. While resting it reached up the the 145 degrees. IT WAS PERFECT!! The key was having the water pan underneath the roasting pan. It help keep the lamb from drying out.

This was too sweet. 

GREAT W/MODIFICATIONS THOUGH... When I made it again, I substituted the honey for soy sauce (about 3 Tbsp)kept the temp at 400 until med rare. It was a winner.

Also, make sure you use a dark Dijon mustard, not the pale stuff and certainly not the yellow stuff. 

If using dried rosemary, use about a tsp and grind it to powder first to release the flavor.

Like the previous reviewer, I lowered the initial temperature to about 375 for the first 15 to 20 minutes. Then I reduced the temp to 350 and covered the lamb with aluminum foil to keep it juicy. This recipe is excellent.

I made this for my family for Easter dinner.  I used a 4 1/2 lb. boneless leg.  I was concerned that there wasn't enough marinade to do the job.  But I always attempt to follow the recipe as written the first time I make it.  I marinated it for about 20 hours.  I cooked it to medium, and it was juicy and tender.  But a little bland.  I agree with one of the reviewers who thought that the marinade seemed a little odd for lamb.  I feel it is better suited for pork or chicken. Also, it needed more marinade...the body of the marinade was 1/4 cup of honey and two tablespoons of dijon mustard.  It needed to be wetter, perhaps with vinegar, wine or even Italian dressing. We did enjoy it, with lots of apple-mint jelly, but after all the rave reviews, I was still a little disappointed.

AMAZING! I did however follow the advice of another reviewer and lowered the temperature to 350. I also put a little water in the bottom to keep it moist and basted it every 15 minutes. DELICIOUS! Will make again and again!

Made this for Christmas dinner and will serve again! Easy to prep and cook. As others note top did char quickly in the first 20 minutes and pan needed water added frequently as to not burn.(I marinated in same pan so sauce in the bottom was burning) But I loosely put foil over the top of the meat and had no problem. Towards end of cooking time I flipped the leg over. Had to cook it WAY more than this recipe states. I had an 8 1/2 b. leg. Everyone loved this dish!

As usual, I did my own thing with the basics of this recipe.  I added all the ingredients, (a little bit more, plus olive oil) to a blender. Added more fresh rosemary leaves from the stalk, which is difficult to cut...better to smush!  Anyway, after the entire sludge of all the ingredients was mixed, I marinated the meat,put it in the oven on low, then placed the extra marindade on the roast while it was in the oven baking.  Eat it rare...delicious!  The combo or the lemon  (tart), honey (sweet) and mustard (tangy) was a great combo marinade.  The garlic, if you choose to include it in the folds of the meat, doesn't really get soft because it's not in the oven that long.  Better to grind it up with the marinade potion.

My 13 year-old daughter has always turned up her nose at lamb-- until tonight!  She had seconds of this dish and loved it.  I inserted slivered garlic into the lamb and added baby carrots, quartered new potatoes, and onion wedges along with the leftover marinade to the roasting pan for the last hour of cooking.  Everything turned out great!

Great recipe for first time lamb cooks! Made this for Easter dinner with rave reviews! The flavor of the marinade is fabulous and marinating overnight is a MUST! I also made small slits in the meat and stuffed with slices of garlic that had been tossed in the marinade.  Delicious!!!

I followed the recipe, exactly.  Honey does not taste right in lamb gravy.  There is too much rosemary.  The high heat makes the roast cook fast and tough.  Next time, I'll cook the de-boned leg of lamb in a crock pot, using salt, pepper, garlic salt, a twig of rosemary.  Then, the meat will be tender and seasoned correctly.

Amazing!!! My boyfriend, who dislikes lamb, loved it. I subbed lemon juice for zest. I only had dried rosemary. I used a quarter cup of balsamic vinegar.  I added more garlic b/c I always do. I also tented the lamb.  Everyone who tried it thought it was fantastic!!

OH!! This was absolutely WONderful! I also strained the remaining marinade, thinned it with a cup of water and poured that over the lamb at intervals during cooking. This prevented sizzle splatter and made a base for THE most wonderful gravy (after I ran it through the blender to smooth it out) YUM!!

I cooked this lamb for Passover, it was a winning dish. I also followed some of the other reviews advice and decided not to darken the top so I placed the lamb also on 325 degrees and cooked for 1hr and 15minutes. I will be cooking this again

This was exceptional!  I also skipped the lemon zest and used a little lemon juice instead along with some balsamic vinegar. I had never cooked lamb before and had no idea it was so fattening!  This will definitely be a treat rather than a regular but it was delicious.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! My hubby made it last Thanksgiving for to take to a potluck dinner and of all the food there this was the ONLY item that was not left over. He added 1 tsp of cayenne pepper and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon for our taste. There was no question about what we are taking to the potluck this year.

This was my first time making lamb and it turned out very moist and tender with a delicious savory flavor. I followed the recipe, next time I will puree in the blender to chop up the rosemary more. Oh and after doing some research in cookbooks and on AR I baked at 325* for 2 hours and it was done medium rare to perfection! So these cooking times are to hot I believe.

We were disappointed with this recipe.  I used a boneless leg of lamb and cooked it for 1 1/2 hours at 325 it came out well done, and the marinate burnt so I had to add water.  We marinated it for a day and a half and it didn't seem to matter.  It made the house smell good but we will not be making this again.  I recommend the Lamb chops with a balsamic reduction.

This was excellent made with the balsamic vinegar,smidgen  of lemon juice, and about a tablespoon of olive oil. I am not a big fan of lamb, but this recipe changed my mind.  Just wish I had know about it 30 years ago. We would have had lamb more often! As others stated I used the 2 cups of water in the pan and tented with foil.

This is delicious.  Makes the lamb "melt-in-your-mouth", and very easy to put together.  My only variation on this recipe was to "stuff" the lamb leg with garlic cloves before marinating it.  (There is no such thing as too much garlic!)

This recipe was phenomenol.  It was my first attempt with lamb, and I was nervous, but I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I did take OSKRWILDE1's advice and blend all the marinade ingredients before marinating.  It worked splendidly.  Also, a few people said to watch the time so as not to overcook.  I was unsuccessful in this endeavor since my guests arrived before dinner was to be served and I was distracted.  As a result, the top of the leg of lamb was a bit charred, but this was only the fat.  (This could maybe have been avoided if I'd cooked it on a lower rack.  I used the middle rack setting in my oven.)  I just flipped it upside down to serve.  The cooking time did not result in dryness at all.  I will DEFINITELY serve this again.

Sorry this recipe was terrible.  I literally washed off the marinade after I cooked it 3/4 of the way  and re seasoned it with salt and pepper and garlic- it was much better. I had second thoughts about  the honey in this recipe , my family reaffirmed  my doubts- they did not like it at all.

I didn't have time to marinate this overnight--just about 4 hrs.  I pureed the marinade as per others' suggestions.  I also cooked it at 350 instead of 400 which seemed to be just about perfect.  I took it out at 140 and let it rest.  It was perfectly pink in the middle.  My family really liked it.

The flavour turned out amazing! I am not a real lamb fan but I loved this. I had a 5lb boneless leg roast and followed the marinating steps exactly and then cooked at 450 for 20 minutes and then at 325 for 1 hour 40 minutes and tented the meat for 15 minutes.

This recipe was awesome!  The local store didn't have leg of lamb so I used lamb chops.  It turned out great.  I served this for a small get together and got rave reviews.  Thanks for posting.

I adjusted the recipe by doubling everything except the lemon zest, but then I added 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 5 tablespoons plum butter.  I also used course grain mustard (IKEA brand) instead of the dijon style, and I was more generous with the salt (put on just before roasting).  I did not use a tent, nor any water in the oven, and I used a Fisher & Paykel Aerotech in the roasting mode (20 min high heat, followed by 1h10m at 320 degrees F).  I used a meat thermometer to measure 150 degrees F internal temp, which gave me a medium roast (I had a 5.5 pound bone-in leg).  The outside was blackened, but that was fine with me, and the roast turned out beautifully -- very tasty.  I also decided to make a mint plum sauce to go with the roast, which I made by brewing mint leaves in a cup of boiling water and adding about 3 tablespoons plum butter and a teaspoon of honey.  That was a great addition, but the lamb was delicious by itself.

Made exactly as is and the flavor of the meat was a 3.5. I'm not a big meat eater so I based the final rating because my husband ate about 2 lbs by himself. With the drippings, I made an Au Jus sauce by adding 1 package of Au Ju Gravy, honey, sugar, and cinnamon. OMGoodness was it good once it was dipped. Served with Roasted Vegetables, Radishes with Butter and Salt, and a loaf of sourdough bread.

This is the best lamb ever. I followed other reviewers cooking time suggestions and added some lemon and balsamic vinegar. Turned out great. I might try it in the crock pot next time.

Loved it.  The lamb turned out moist and tasty.  I served at Easter, and my 85 year old uncle stated that he hated lamb, and then reached for seconds First time he had ever had one that he liked.  One thing that I did was use two 3.5 lb. legs of lamb, bone in, instead of one 6-7 lb one.  It work well because I was able to cook one a little more so that we had rare-med. well on the table.  Cooked 450 for only 15 min as it was starting to look a little burnt.  Then lowered it to 350 for 20 min/lb.  Marinade made it tasty.  I added a little olive oil and tried the vinegar too.  Really put a lot of garlic and it was great!!!

I followed the recipe and added the olive oil and balsamic vinegar as the past reviewers suggested, I marinated for 3 days and yet, there was NO flavor from the marinade at all in the end product. The lamb taste was totally overpowering, I love lamb but this recipe offered nothing, as if I had just roasted it with nothing else. I give it 3 stars because I still enjoyed the end result and maybe I should have used a smaller roast for the marinade to penetrate better. I think I might try again but not so sure.

This recipe was amazing! My whole family loved it!  I marinated the leg of lamb and then put it on a bed of pearl onions,celery, and carrots in a poultry bag.  I also added about a cup of water into the bag so I would have a lot of drippings to make gravy with afterward.  I cooked down the gravy with the leftover rosemary and really made the lamb taste fabulous!  This recipe is simple but looks really impressive!

Being short on time, I was unable to marinate the lamb overnight- in fact, I only marinated it for about 2-3 hours before putting it into the oven. I substituted Rosemary (sorry) with Oregano and Basil as I can't really taste the difference anyhow. Halfway through I added a tent, as my roast was starting to look very dry on top. Outcome was amazing- even though I hadn't let it marinate long enough, the meat was very tender. And since there's so much meat, it provided quite a bit of food to last several days- an absolute must for a student with little time on their hands. (The extra juices left in the roasting pan I scooped into a separate bowl to save as sauce, after removing the fat) Also, I put garlic into slits in the meat, and it turned out pretty well. Don't forget to crush the garlic cloves, it'll help diffuse the juices during the baking process.

I intended to follow the pkg directions on my "semi boneless lamb shoulder", but I panicked at the last minute & sought out this recipe.  So, I didn't marinate overnight, I had to pulverize dried rosemary, and I added the suggested lemon juice.  My first lamb ever turned out GREAT. Starting with a 400 oven crisped up the exterior & kept the meat moist.  A foil cover is definitely a must after that.  My 6.7 lbs cooked almost 3 hours to reach 145 internal temp. then after slicing off enough med & med-rare meat for dinner, the really red center went back into the oven while we ate.  An excellent recipe.  Thanks!

Yummy! Super delicious! Doubled marinade for other uses but only used litle more than 1/2 for this recipe. Used suggestions (these are for 1 x recipe not doubling): no lemon zest 1 tsp lemon juice instead, added 1/4 c olive oil and 1/8 c balsamic vinegar (didn't want it to be overpowering), and  1/2 tsp sea salt to marinade - all in food processor, poured it over lamb for almost 24 hrs.  Did not tent or use foil. Started oven at 450 for 10 min then down to 325 (using glass roasting pan) for rest of 2 hrs (had 5.15 lb boneless leg-was about 25 min/lb)-perfect Med-Rare. Did add 2 c H2O to pan at start of roasting, red potatoes, carrots and basted 2 x during roasting. Let lamb sit for about 10 min before slicing. Added 2 tsp brn rice flour(gluten free) and juices (from sitting lamb)to liquid to make gravy-brought to boil and reduce for couple of min. Thank you for this great recipe and for all the suggestions ... definetly a keeper!

Excellent flavor.  This is the first Lamb I have cooked and it turned out wonderful.  I followed one-half the recipe exactly using a 2.5 pound roast.  I cooked for 95 minutes at 350F, let rest for 25 minutes and got a medium roast which was very tender and flavorful.

This recipe is delicious just the way it is.  I did add juice of 1/2 lemon to the marinade as well as the req'd zest.  I wanted to be sure the lamb was very tender.  This is one of the recipes you can make for the first time for guests and be confident it will be perfect.

This recipe was great...my husband just couldn't stop eating it. I did as the other reviews suggested and added a little balsamic vinegar to the marinade and a squirt of lemon juice and let it marinate for 2 days. Then roasted in oven at 350 for 2 hours (covered to retain the juices) and took it out when temperature was 135 degrees (med-rare). Had a really nice pinot noir with it which I added a generous half cup to the drippings along with some soya milk mixed with sweet rice flour to thicken and a twig of chopped fresh rosemary. It was great! Thinking of making this for the whole extended family for our Easter dinner.

I used a three-lb boneless leg.  Started the oven at 400 for first 10 mins then turned the oven down to 325 and cooked to internal temp of 145, med-rare to medium.  I had marinated in a ziploc bag so added a cup of water to that and poured it into the bottom of the pan.  After one hour of cooking (takes 1 1/2 hrs), I put another 1/2 cup water to the bottom of the pan.  Took the lamb out to set for 10-15 min to rest and cooked up pan drippings, as is, to make a tasty sauce.  Served with mint jelly.

Lamb turned out wonderfully tender after marinating overnight.  I used a 5lb bonelss leg and I added balsalmic vinegar as suggested and used lemon juice in place of the zest to save time.  I think I'd marinate longer next time, because although the marinade smelled wonderful, I couldn't taste much of it in my leg of lamb.

Awesome! I added the balsamic vinegar and olive oil like others suggested. I coated quartered potatoes and carrots with honey, olive oil, salt, and rosemary and put them around the roast.  The cook times and temps were just about right for a 6lb bone-in leg roast.  Excellent recipe.

This is a great recipe, my family totally enjoyed it today...Easter Sunday.  I did add olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the marinade as it stretched it some.  I also placed the lamb and marinade in an oven bag and marinated overnight, then roasted in the bag for about 2 hours and 15 minutes at 350 degrees, very, very tender, very moist.  I don't like my lamb pink but do like it tender so opted for the slower roasting.  This is definitely a keeper recipe.

This was fantastic. Used a couple other reviewers suggestions to add a squirt of lemon juice and a tbs of balsamic vinegar to the marinade and let sit in the fridge for about 2 days in a ziploc bag.

Reduced the heat, perhaps too much, I want to say I put it at 325 but may have been 300 -- ended up having to put it back in for another 30-40 minutes. Came out perfect then. Nice, flavorful and tender and juicy. Mmmmm. Will definitely make this again when I'm expecting more than two people for dinner.

I made this recipe for Xmas, and it was outstanding.  My only problem was that the meat was underdone, though I used a thermometer.  Next time, I'll cook it a little longer.  I agree with the reviewers who suggest putting balsamic vinegar in the marinade, injecting cloves of garlic in the meat, and using water at the bottom of the pan.  I made a mistake with the leftovers, though.  I don't have a microwave, so I reheated the meat in my oven, but that made it tough and dry.  Next time, I'll slice the servings and heat them briefly in a teflon frying pan with a touch of olive oil.  That should take the chill off without overcooking the meat.  Anyway, delicious recipe!

My husband wouldn't stop raving about this delicious recipe!  The flavors are wonderful together!  I did have to cook it longer because we like it more on the medium side.  The only thing I would suggest is to put a little water in the pan so the marinade/drippings do not burn.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Great dish, but I strongly recommend using a meat thermometer.  My leg of lamb was a lot smaller so it was done in 40 minutes.

I made this for Easter in my Rotissiere.  I followed the advice of many reviewers and added the Balsamic vinegar, olive oil and then blended it all together. I pulled the net off and stuffed the roast with garlic and a put a little of the marinade inside and then put the net back on. (tough task but worth it.) My roast was a 5.5 lb boneless and it cooked to medium-well in 1.5 hours.  I was taking the advice of a reviewer who said 30 minutes per pound in the rotissiere, but in my opinion, if you want medium-rare, 20 minutes per pound will do.  My relatives LOVED it and my husband said that it ranked right up there with one of his favorite dishes.  I served it with roated potatoes and greens (from this web site) and broccolli steamed with lemon zest.  It was an excellent meal.

I made this for Easter.  Everyone loved the flavor.  I followed the recipe for the marinade.  I slightly cooked it longer than I should have, it wasn't pink inside.  Next time I'll cook it exactly as the recipe states.  I made a gravy for it by adding water, a little balsamic, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the roasting pan after I removed the meat.  It was very good.

Best lamb recipe I have ever tried (and I cook lamb quite a bit).  The only changes I made were to add about a 1/4 cup of Basalmic to the mix, and about a teaspoon of fresh minced mint.  I also used a tad more honey than the recipe called for and stuffed the butterflied leg with about 6 cloves (sliced) of garlic.  Also I spread the marinade on the inside of the butterflied leg as well as the outside (and then used some cooking string to get it all tied back up). 

I cooked it on the rotisserie on my gas grill (250 degrees) and it turned out beautifully.

Nice and tasty - but I'm not a great fan of lemon and lamb - have made it since without the lemon, and it suited our tastes much more - really yummy - thanks for sharing!!!

I also was worried about making a lamb dish. This was outstanding,  I also followed others and reduced the heat and added water and put a "tent" over the lamb. I will make this one again.

My only complaint about this recipe was that cooking the leg for 20 minues at 450 left my roast burnt on the outside.

I made this for a surprise valentine last night.WOW! what a response!!!! It's the first roast i have ever made and it came out perfectly.
The only changes i made was I cut holes in the roast and stuffed if full of garlic cloves, and left it marinade for 2 days. While i was roasting it, i filled the casserole dish half way with water to keep the roast moist. I also smeared it with apricot jam when i grilled it for the last 15 minutes without any water in the pan. At the end, i took all the saucy water and added 2 tablespoons of gravy powder (Bisto if you can get it) and left the left overs in the gravy to keep it juicy. YUMM!!! from Nat ;) in South Africa

My cooking  tip to first time lamb cooks is to use a Reynolds bag and you just add some herbs and salt and pepper.  Maybe you will get better results.  I will be using this recipe Easter Sunday and not add or detract any ingredients just to test it out.  If we like it, I will see just what it needs for the next time.  Too many cooks spoils the stew.  And I always read the one star, two and three stars to be amused.  It amazes me how disappointed they are with a recipe.  The five stars seem to change the original recipe with so many different methods, they should submit their version of a dish.  Happy Easter and good eats!

I did as others recommended by adding a splash of lemon juice and balsamic vinegar to the marinade.  The lamb marinated overnight.  Before roasting, I made a few small slits in the lamb and poked in some sliced garlic.  To the roasting pan, I added some big chunks of carrot and onion so it would flavor the gravy

Seasoned as directed, except used 2t of dried rosemary. Baked at 400 for 30 minutes, then reduced heat and cooked at 315 for 2 hours (we don't do rare meat).  Super tender, juicy and flavorful.

Did exactly what it said and my first leg of lamb was great. Had to use a foil tent, but i guess it depends on your oven. Used a new zealand lamb very tender.

I've made this recipe exactly as written twice now and it's fantastic.  Use this, print it and put it in your recipe box.  You won't need another lamb recipe.  Even family that aren't lamb lovers loved this leg of lamb.

I made this recipe, and followed the directions exactly for Christmas last year.  This was my first Christmas dinner at my house and I had never cooked a leg of lamb.  I used standard lamb cooking guidelines with the lamb since all lamb legs will not be created equal.  The flavor was perfect, and I would never make a change to this recipe.

My first time making this recipe with two separate legs of lamb. With one I followed the recipe to the letter, with the 2nd I used orange peel instead of lemon zest and added cumin. BOTH resulted in pure DELICIOUSNESS and everyone licked their fingers! I loved it, and my personal opinion though, it needs a tad more citrus or a citrusy side-dish. Otherwise, no complaints. EXCELLENT, and I will use it again.

4.5 per Lebanese husband who loves lamb.  :) Saw later that others had added balsamic vinegar to the marinade so poured a splash over the lamb part way through roasting; I think this gave the sauce too much bitterness.  So make sure you add it during marinating or not at all.

Excellent marinade. I took the recommendations of others and added 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar to the marinade. We let the meat marinade overnight as well. Cooked at 450 for 20 min, used a loose foil tent and cooked at 350 for 55 min then removed the tent and cooked at 400 for 10. Meat was Medium when done. I will cook for less time at 350 next time for more med rare.

Made this for the first time for Easter dinner.  I did add a splash of lemon juice and a splash of balsamic vinegar to the marinade and marinaded overnight in a ziplock bag.  Based on other reviews I baked at 450 for 20 minutes, then reduced to 350 for one hour with the plan to up the temp again to finish the roast.  Mine was a boneless leg that weighed just over 4 lbs.  Anyway, I should have put the temp probe in when I decreased the temp to 350 because by the time the hour was up my roast was way past medium rare and up to 150.  The flavor was really good and I would make it again but next time stick the probe in from the beginning so I didn't fly past medium rare.

Delicious.  First lamb I ever cooked.  I added one tablespoon chopped tyme and lemon juice instead of the zest and reduced mustard to one tablespoon.  Roasted at 450 for 20 minutes and then reduced to 350 and tented lamb with foil. Cooked for one hour and fifteen minutes. Let rest for 10.  WAS WONDERFUL

The marinade didn't really penetrate the meat with this recipe.  I found it fairly bland.  Given how popular this recipe is, maybe I'm just not a big fan of lamb.

Best lamb recipe I've ever cooked or tasted!  This was a hit at our Easter luncheon today, everyone complimented me for it.  I had never made a sweet marinade for lamb, it really was perfect.  I also followed the suggestion of making the gravy with the drippings from the pan, adding red currant jelly and wine... wonderful.  I roasted red potatoes in the pan, and they were perfect with the lamb.  Cut in half, cut-side down cooking in the marinade and lamb juices... yumm!

Made this for Easter dinner. I used a 7lb boneless leg of lamb so I had to adjust the time and amount of marinade I made but other than that I made as the recipe is. Everyone LOVED this!  I think it may become part of our Easter tradition.

My first attempt at roasted leg of lamb and it was a hit!  My husband even thought it was beef (he loves beef) lol  I didn't have time to marinate overnight - just about 2 hrs and it was still great!

Since several people said that the meat did not take up the marinade, I used an injector to inject the marinade directly into the meat.  I also slivered the garlic and pushed it into slits in the meat.  Everyone loved this recipe.  I will use this as my new recipe for leg of lamb.

Amazing Recipe.   I did make a few changes, I didn't have any honey and read some reviewers used maple syrup, so I changed that.   I also used both lemon (juice of half a lemon) and lemon zest.    While cooking I noticed that some of the sauce was burning on the side of the pan.  I would occasionally add some water mixed with balsamic vinegar to the pan to help with that.  I used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 3/4 cup water and had the mix ready whenever I basted just in case I saw the sauce burning.    I cooked at 450 for the first 20 minutes and 325 for the remaining until the meat thermometer read correctly.  I basted every 20 minutes.    The leftovers were better than the first day, probably because I poured the sauce over top and let it soak in after I cut the meat.    My husband does not like lamb and even he enjoyed it.

Great recipe. Used extra garlic and rosemary and balsamic. I added the marinade to the roasting pan-big mistake, sauce was way too sweet for my liking. The Lamb was GREAT though!

Definitely a keeper!! I did not use the honey because I didn't have any...I may try to use it next time, but the lamb was delicious anyway!!! I followed the advice of some other reviews and roasted the foil tented lamb at 450 for 30 min, then at 350 for 45 min and finally removed the foil and roasted at 400 for 20 minutes...PERFECT!!!

WOW!  I normally hate lamb but make it for my family who loves it.  I made this for a family party and everyone raved over it.  I had to sample it and to my amazement, it was delicious and without the usual gamy flavor.  Excellent and I followed the recipe exactly.  Only diff was I used a rotisserie, 20 minutes on high and 40 minutes on medium.

The marinate was good, but my husband and I could hardly taste it after the leg was done because it didn't penetrate most of the meat.

We made this last year for Easter. It was great. Instead of baking it we used our rotisere on our grill, it came out fantastic!! I marinated it with everything it called for and added the balsamic vinegar and cut slits it the leg for garlic. I put the heat on medium temp about 325 and basted it every 30 min. until the temp was 145. We are looking forward to have it again this year. Thanks for a great recipe. Everyone loved it!

Absolutely delicious! I didnt have fresh rosemary and used the bottled one as substitute, didnt have lemon zest either and instead i used fresh lemon.  I also marinated for 5hrs instead of overnight.  It still was scrumptous and my family thoroughly enjoyed it. I followed another reviewers advice and put the whole leg and marinate in a oven bag and baked.  It was very moist and tender. A definite repeater!!

I beleive this recipes is not for people doing lamb for the first time. The degrees of cooking is why off i had to cook mine at 325 because at 400 it was burnin the juices and the top of my lamb. In addition the time its way off i had to cook mine for almost 2 hrs. Also, the tast was not that good.
I will never make this recipe again

Today I tried this recipe.  I read all the reviews and did some research on other websites.  Unbeleivable!!!!  I did add some balsamic vinegar and lemon juice to the marinade. I added 1 cup of water to the bag placed a rack inside the bag, tied every inch or so and cooked it at 300 for 2 hours. I also reserved 2 cups of drippings added a little red wine, some reg cream and cornstarch for a delicsious gravy

This was the first time I've made a leg of lamb.  It won't be my last!  This recipe was better than delicious!  My husband loves lamb and I made it for his birthday...he was very surprized and happy that I attempted the lamb.  Then he tasted it!  Mmmmmm...don't change a thing in this recipe.  It's perfect!

The flavor of the lamb was great, I used some Tupelo honey in the marinade which is divine.  I had difficulty with it burning in the roasting pan, though.  The lamb cooked fine on the inside, but the honey was charred in some places and left a messy clean up task.  What did I do wrong?  I will try this again if I can prevent the burning.

Delicious! I had a four pound leg, bone-in, and it was incredible! Fortunately for us, it was only for two people, so we had PLENTY of leftovers. Makes a great sandwich, too! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is the best way I have ever cooked/eaten lamb. Served it for Easter along with Janet's Oven Roasted Potatoes and home-canned Green Beans. Made a marvelous gravy in the pan the roast cooked in using a little corn starch and white wine. Kudos to Jmass for this great recipe!

This was the first time I prepared a lamb roast and was very impressed by this recipe.  My grocery store was out of fresh Rosemary, so I used high-quality dried Rosemary.  I cut the net off of my roast to let the marinade reach all parts of the roast.  I wish I would have had tied it back, as the roast was of uneven thickness and parts of it cooked more quickly than others.  In retrospect, I think I will not remove the netting and simply stab the roast to allow the marinade to penetrate.  I also cooked it at a lower temp -- 425 with aluminum over it for the first 20 minutes (as many others suggested) and at 325 until the meat thermometer read about 135-140.  Will definitely make again!

I was somewhat disappointed in this receipe, especially after reading all the rave reviews.  I marinated the lamb overnight, but the flavor didn't get in too well.  Also, I found the rosemary a little too overwhelming, so if I try making this again, I might use less of it.

I know this could have turned out better for me.  The grocery store didn't have rack of lamb, so I used lamb chops instead.  I didn't read the recipe close enough and used regular mustard instead of Dijon mustard.  I started marinating it in the morning before I went to work, but I think it would have been even better to start marinating the night before.  Also, because they were just lamb chops, I would suggest lowering the heat to 350 degrees.  I will definatley make this again.  I absolutley LOVED the smell of fresh rosemary!!

This was terrific!  I didn't have quite as much honey as the recipe called for, but it was fine.  Also, I didn't have time for it to marinate overnight, so I marinated it at room temp for almost 2 hours before roasting.  Probably overnight would have made it even more flavorful, but this worked very well.  I used the drippings and bone for a nice lamb broth which I turned into a lamb stew with the leftover meat.

I have always hated the smell of roasting lamb.  With this recipe, the aroma throughout the house was so grand that I didn't want to leave.  It tastes wonderful, moist and tender.  We will definitely make this again and again.

It's hard for me to tell you a lot about this recipe. I don't like lamb and rarely eat more than a bite or two covered in horseradish sauce. 
I 've made it about 3 times for our church and they love it. Attendance at this event has doubled since I've used it. 
Watch the temperature - I use boneless roasts. Pull out and let it rest. Check the temperature carefully, don't use beef temperatures. 
We trim the meat well. Marinate over night and roast. Happy Easter.

This was my first time making lamb and it turned out great! I used some modifications suggested by other viewers and it was a huge hit. The only issue I ran into was the cooking time. I did a lot of reading about how long to cook lamb and it took waaaay longer than I was expecting. Here is the modified recipe I used:

~2.3lb boneless lamb
1/4C honey
2 tbsp mustard powder
2 tsp vinegar
2 tsp sugar
2 tsp water
1 tbsp dried rosemary
1/2 tbsp dried thyme
1 tsp black pepper
2 tbsp lemon juice
4 cloves garlic (~2.5 slivered and infused in the meat, the rest went in the mix)
1 tbsp worcestershire sauce

I mixed everything up as the recipe suggested and let it marinate for about 2 days brushing the mixture over the meat at least once a day.

Now for the cooking time, I used a roaster, so I didn't sear it. I cooked it at 325F for about 45 minutes and it was nowhere near cooked. I wondered if I ended up with a 2.3 kg lamb instead of 2.3 lbs which would have made a huge difference...Never the less, it was a huge hit when my guests finally got to eat it! I served with a rice pilaf and lemon mint asparagus with baklava for dessert. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

Excellent!! Marinate overnight and don't overcook.  15-20 mins on 450 then turned down to 375 for approx 2 hours for a 6 - 7 lbs boneless roast. Watch very carefully and check temps

I tried my first ever roast leg of lamb (boneless) - this recipe is a winner, it came out of the oven looking like a pro had made it. My husband loved it too. I had a smaller piece of meat than the one mentioned in the recipe so I had to adjust for that - I have learned 45 minutes to a pound of lamb roast/ the last 20 minutes I covered it with tin foil. This recipe is surely going to be on our Thanksgiving table this year, so easy and can be marinated a day or two earlier.

VERY TOUGH!! I cooked 2 5lb boneless legs of lamb purchased fresh from Costco. I have slow roasted my lamb in the past and had excellent results but for Easter dinner 2014, I unfortunately used this recipe and roasting instructions.  I had a number if guests who prefer their meat medium and others who prefer well. I took the first roast out at 145C and the second at 165C and let both rest for 20-30 minutes. They carved well and looked quite pink inside. Unfortunately the meat was VERY TOUGH. Hardly any was eaten off the plates and there was much left over. There were 14 people dining. I was so disappointed.  The next day, I put the leftovers in the crockpot in low for 10 hours along with some if the gravy. After cooking in the crockpot the lamb was delicious and tender. So I would say if you're following this recipe, roast it the day before, slice it, and then cook in the crockpot for 8-10 hours on LOW.

Wow. Delicious marinade. The lamb was so succulent and flavorful. I butterflied the leg so I could get more of the marinade in the middle, then put back together and tied with cooking twine. I have a counter top rotisserie and used that and it was wonderful!

I also added lemon juice and balsamic vinegar to the marinade. Delicious. Deboned and butterflied the lamb and put it in a rotisserie grill basket to cook. Very tasty would definitely use this marinade again. Thank you.

I made this following advice to alter cooking times, add more lemon juice and add water to the roasting pan. Also because I cannot tolerate black pepper I made a substitution (which I often use) of nutmeg with a dash of cinnamon. It got rave reviews from the entire family.

I made this for Easter Sunday.  It turned out delicious.  My marinade did blacken though, so I put foil over the top for a while.   I fed 12 people and they all loved it.

WOW!!! I added some beef broth to the bottom of the pan so the honey wouldn't stick and burn and it created the most amazing jus. I also added some balsamic vinegar to the marinade. It warmed up even better the next day. AWESOME

This is a fantastic recipe and really easy to make. I wasn't sure about the ingredients at first but wow, they tie together nicely. The only thing I did different was turn it all the way down to 350 after the initial 20 minutes at 450, and I cooked it a bit longer, I think about 90 minutes. It was perfectly medium rare. I gave this recipe 5 stars becuase my 4 year old fussy eater asked for seconds, which rarely happens, let alone with meat. What an awesome recipe!

My first time with lamb and I received many compliments at my Easter dinner! However, I do not feel the marinade permeated the meat very much - I did cut slits in roast and inserted garlic and that I tasted.  I baked at 450 for 15 minutes, then turned down to 325.  The lamb roasted for hour and a half until thermometer read 120.  Wound up resting for 30 minutes while other dishes were cooking and temperature rose to 130.

I would make this again, but I skip the overnight marinade next time

this was deliciouse! i wasnt sure how it would come out with the honey, but it was so complimenting! the only down side i found was even though i cooked it exactly to 145 and it seemed a little dry to me, maybe just because i had to cook our 3lb leg for so long? (high altitude)

Very good, I marinated it for 4 hours, I am sure it will be even better marinated overnight.  I used a 4 lb leg, and it was a tad dry.  I followed the 20 minute a pound rule, but didn't include the first 15 minutes in that time, I probably should have added it in.  I will make a gravy for it next time. There will be a next time with this recipe.

This was pretty good, but a little on the sweet side for my taste. Maybe it was that i grilled this on the George Forman grill using a cubed leg of lamb so it kind of glazed over making a sort of honey crust. I even added a splash of lemon juice and vinegar since i had them handy. Still, it was delicious. I made it w/ spanish rice and salad, which is probably why it tasted even sweeter(the rice was salty in comparison). Next time i'll make this w/ white rice or potatoes maybe so it really stands out. Still, yummy. :D

We're college kids who usually live of McDs and microwaveables,and this recipe looked straightforward and  easy(big plus) so this was a treat! The combo of Dijon and rosemary was soo right... i might make this for mom when i go back just to wow her...

Was a little over cooked and we left it only for 50 min at 400.  Very sweet.  The red skin potatoes and leeks we cooked with it were yummy.  Made a gravy with the reserved juice, that was sweet too from the honey.

My first time cooking lamb, and it came out pretty good. I think maybe a little overcooked, but that would be user error. I really liked this marinade because of how well it stayed on the meat, some marinades are so watery that most drips off and is wasted. I made *Rosemary Red Potatoes* off this site as a side dish, and it was a perfect compliment! I'd also recommend lining your pan with foil - it makes clean up so much easier.

I made this recipe for the first time last year for easter dinner. It was also the first time I'd made or eaten lamb. This recipe is fabulous! I LOVE it i've made lamb several times since then and wont make it any other way.

I made this for my family's Christmas Dinner.  None of them had ever had lamb before.  When making the marinade I thought the mustard would be too strong, but the finished product wasn't too strong.  Instead of roasting it in the oven I seared it off and finished it in the slow cooker.  My family also can't stand pink meat so it was far more well done then I like it, but it was still good.  They all enjoyed it and I will definitly use this next time I do a lamb roast.

For some reason I cooked lamb last year for Easter (maybe because I don't like ham) and I was a little worried about being able to feed people. My dad told me he was bringing two bottles of wine, because he thought I'd messed up the lamb...that made me worried...my only problem was, dinner was done, lamb wasn't. Good thing my kids wanted a ham too. We did get to eat a little lamb for dinner but it wasn't enough to feed 15...but later that night my husband and I munched on it and it was wonderful! I am making this again for Christmas. The only thing I did different was I marinated it for 2 days :) it was wonderful! Can't say anything else about it! Looking forward to making it again this year!

Delicious!  Served for our Easter dinner. Even the pickiest of eaters who generally would never try anything other than beef, ham or turkey enjoyed this dish.  I used a 7 lb leg of lamb and tented it with foil to prevent the scorching of the garlic and rosemary. Took a bit longer to cook because of the extra size, but it didn't delay our meal too much.

As suggested, add to marinade 1 tsp. lemon juice and 1 Tbsp. Balsamic vinegar.  I also followed suggestion for sauce: de-fat the pan juices first, then add some red wine and 1/2 Tbsp. red currant jelly. I made this recipe with a boneless leg of lamb; two pounds served 5 adults.  Rich tasting, so make the side dishes simple.

I was always afraid of making lamb with it being so expensive and all.  I hate to waste anything because if it's not good, these people I live with will not eat it no matter how much it cost!  But this was easy and tasted great.  I used the left overs to make Irish Lamb Stew which is on this site and it was great as well.  Lamb will be a regular on our menu from now on.

This recipe was so easy to do and it came out fantastic.  I'm not a mustard fan so I was a little leery of using Dijon mustard in the marinade, especially marinating it for 2 days as suggested by others.  But, even though I could smell the mustard when it was cooking, it didn't have a strong mustard-y flavor.  And the lamb itself was so tender and juicy.  I added a little more minced garlic and olive oil, as well as some Marsala Wine (just a litte, maybe 1/2 cup) to the marinade.  I cooked it at 450 for 20 minutes then because I was kinda time-crunched, I cooked it for 360 for an hour.  I would have liked to do it closer to 325 but company came early.  Both the legs I did registered between 150 and 160 degrees and it was done evenly through, not bloody.  I got rave reviews at Easter.  A very good recipe, and a keeper at our house... thanks for sharing!

I started not to use the honey because I don't like sweet meat, but I did. I didn't even taste the sweetness. I used a meat thermometer that stayed in the meat while it was cooking. I like my lamb and beef medium rare. It came out perfectly! I loved the taste of the fresh rosemary. Good recipe.

First time trying lamb - and this was great!  I used the marinade to make a sauce by combining the left over marinade with cream and some red wine (brought to a light boil). The lamb was tender and tasty.

I read many of the reviews of this recipe before I made it and ended up being a little disppointed. My family likes a lot of flavor and this recipe just didn't pull it off. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really great. I didn't add the balsamic vinegar like some had recommended. Perhaps, that was my mistake. I also would not cook it at such a high temperature. I'll try it again, but ramp up the flavor and adjust the temp. Overall, he flavor wasn't bad, just not great. The lamb was tender and the recipe was easy to follow. Next time I think I'll add the balsamic vinegar, shallots, and more rosemary.

We tried this recipe for Easter and thought it was amazing. It made the meat very tender and we ended up not using a leg a lamb but a rib roast of a lamb. It still turned out amazing. When looking through the reviews we did add the 1/4 c of balsamic vinegar and 1/4 c olive oil. Also when cooking we checked on the meat every 30 minutes and added additional water to the bottom of the pan. This allowed for the meat to not dry out. It also helped to make the gravy for the lamb and it was out of this world. The only thing we had to adjust was the cooking time. Instead of cooking it for 55-60 minutes we ended up cooking it for 50 minutes. We could have taken it out earlier because of the internal temperature, but the meat didn't turn out to be well done. We still had medium rare pieces.

I used boneless pieces of lamb. I didnt have honey but used molasses instead. Still very yummy! I did over cook it bit. Being boneless pieces it probably only needed about 45 minutes total. Will make again! Thanks!

Very tasty! I did add 1/4 cup of Olive Oil, Balasmic Vinegar, pinch of Thyme,  & Oregano.  I also, added a tbsp more of honey.  I used Sue Webb-Smith's method of cooking, along with basting every 20 mins or so.  Cooked until thermometer read 145.  My husband really enjoyed it!

I used the lemon juice and balsamic vinegar mentioned by earlier reviewers. I also lowered the cooking temp and cooked it longer. But it was a wonderful marinade. The lamb turned out wonderful.

Family looved this Recipe! Picky eaters gobbled it up!! Tip: Placed this boneless lamb on a rack in a covered roaster after marinating it for 48 hours (not on purpose but great result!).  Roasted at 325 degrees for 2 hours. This roasting time yielded a tasty, tender, pink roast lamb! Served with green mint jelly and red current jelly, twice baked potatos and Cranberry Gelatin (from All Recipes). Fabulous meal! Fabulous marinade! Thanks for a great recipe!

Oh my goodness--this was the best leg of lamb I have ever tasted! I read another review and used a foil cover, but in addition to this, I had saved the leftover marinade and kept spooning the marinade over the roast to keep it moist. Will most definitely make this again!

This makes the BEST leg of lamb! I cut holes in the lamb to place slivers of garlic inside the leg of lamb. I also place the marinade in a plastic bag and then put the lamb in to soak over night. This way I find that you can get the marinade to coat the whole leg of lamb.

Will make again and again!

This had great flavor! I only had 1.5lb boneless leg, so I had to adjust the cooking time quite a bit. The marinade was a nice combination of mustard, honey & garlic. Will definitely keep this recipe. I think I'll try it on chicken as well.

Wish I could rave as well as others have, but truthfully, I'm not sure about this one.  This was an expensive disappointment.  I used fresh rosemary from my garden and an expensive, choice-cut of lamb, and followed the recipe to the "T".  We ended up with a lot of left-over lamb that went to waste.  My three children and husband are not picky eaters and usually willing to try most anything, but they were not impressed by this recipe at all.  Maybe I went wrong somewhere? I don't claim to be a pro-chef, but with 25 years of cooking and pleased eaters under my belt, I can't imagine what happened with this one.

This was a delicious leg of lamb. I read the other reviews and roasted at 400 for 20 minutes and then reduced the heat to 375 for the remainder. I also added the balsamic vinegar as others had suggested. The meat was delicious and tender. I will definately make it again and again.

I'll never make roast lamb any other way from now on. This recipe was amazingly delicious. I had guests for dinner and they all proclaimed it the best lamb they had ever had. Serve with those little red potatoes, cut in half and roasted.

The only complaint I have about this recipe was that it took away the gamey taste of the lamb and that is what I like best about lamb. It tasted more like roast beef. Other than that it had a very good flavor.

We tried this with a butterflied leg of lamb, since we didn't have bone-in. My husband was hesitant... doesn't like mustard and persuaded me to do only one of the two legs with this marinade. Everyone loved it, and you guessed- he was sorry we only had one!
The combination of flavors was excellent. My husband doesn't like sweet meat, and thought the honey- mustard combo was beautifully balanced. Definite "do it again" and am trying it with other meats as encouraged by some others.

Disappointing. Marinated a boneless leg of lamb for a day and a half, even cutting slits to help the marinace penetrate, and we didn't notice much flavor enhancement at all.

Keep in mind that I HATE lamb, but my hubby loves it, so I decided to make him a leg of lamb...Yuck.  

Well, this recipe was definitely a hit with hubby and two sons, one of whom is so finicky, he only heats pizza and mac & cheese!  So, naturally, I had to try some.  I don't know why, but this was the first time the lamb didn't have that awful gamey taste...I ACTUALLY LIKED IT!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I had my doubts about this recipe as the marinade ingredients were all very powerful and I was not sure they would combine too well.
Boy was I wrong, we spent the whole evening in the kitchen just enjoying the smells, and that was just when the meet was in the fridge marinating.
Then we had the next pleasure of even better smells the next afternoon, while the lamb was cooking.
Finally we were put out of our misery and I actually served the meal, I served the lamb with mustard mash and various green vegetables, more or less a traditional English Sunday dinner, and it was absolutely delicious.
Many thanks for this recipe, as you can probably tell I am a novice cook, this was actually only my second dish, cooked for my family, I am trying to get into cooking as a hobby, something I have always wanted to do.
Now onto the next recipe, where is that search button.

This was just ok for me.  I guess I thought that the marinade, because it was sweet and lemony, would be best on some other meat.  I was hoping that the predominant flavors would be the dijon, rosemary, and garlic after it was cooked, but all I could taste was the honey and lemon which just seemed odd on lamb to me.  Thanks anyways.

I made this lamb tonight and the top started to get very black after the first 20 minutes, I didn't use a foil tent like others had suggested since I wanted to give the recipe a go as is first.  My roast was just a tad under five pounds and I cooked it as suggested and it was leaning towards rare.  I think maybe 425 degrees for the first twenty minutes then maybe 375ish the rest and cook for maybe 15-20 minutes longer???  The bottom of the pan got very burned and dry also, maybe needs some liquid?  This had a good taste and with a few tweaks I will make this again.

This is fantastic everyone at Easter liked this lamb and most had never had lamb before,had about 20 adults and 6 kids. I doubled marinade, covered roast well and because it was a boneless leg I was able to get the marinade well into middle of roast. Like other reviewers I put marinade  into blender, this resulted in the rosemary having a stronger taste, next time will probably just use the 2 tablespoons rosemary and double every thing else. Roasted at 450 for 20 min. then 325 for 1-1/2 hours this was med. rare for a 5-1/2 lb. roast.

I had a boneless, butterflied leg of lamb and no idea what to do with it, especially since my family is not keen on lamb.  Everyone enjoyed this a great deal, even the suspicious kids.  I added a bit of olive oil and lemon juice to the marinade and let the lamb marinate for 2 days.  I pre-heated to 450 degrees and turned the oven down to 350 as soon as I put the lamb in.  As others suggested I added some water to the pan.  I think I overcooked slightly, but I'll correct that next time.

Fantastic recipe.  Normally when I cook lamb I rely on the veg and a sauce to make the meat taste good.  The smell as it cooks drives you mad, its so delicious!!

This recipe for lamb was a crowd pleaser! Everyone was raving, even those who are usually tough to please. I followed advice of another reviewer, who added a dash of balsamic vinegar to the marinade, and to the other who suggested adding 2 cups of water to the roasting pan. This helped create a delicious tasting sauce to pour over the lamb before serving. This recipe is a definite keeper.

this was really good! the meat turned out nice and juicy and the flavor of the marinade complmented the lamb very well. i used dried rosemary and it turned out fine. i will make this again, perhaps for a holiday lunch. an added bonus: when grilling the outside of the meat becomes nice and crunchy!

Very good taste but came out a little dry so I would suggest wrapping the whole leg several times in aluminum foil and lowering the temp of the oven.  Did that method for the second try- came out sooo delicious.

Absolutely delicious. I made this for company and everyone truly enjoyed it. The marinate was so simple to make yet the flavors really came through as it cooked. A definite favorite.

This was also my first time to cook lamb and it certainly will not be my last.  My
kids REALLY liked it, which was a big surprise to me!!  My dad was thoroughly impressed
with my cooking abilities too.  It was just like lamb that I've ordered in restaurants.

This was delicious!  It was easy to put together and was a big hit with my family.  Great dish for impressing company!  I was afraid it would be too sweet because of the honey, but it was perfect.  I used a rack of lamb instead and adjusted the cooking time.

Superb flavor!  I added 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar.  I also covered the pan with foil until the last 10 minutes and added 3 cups of water.  I recommend putting foil on the base of the pan so it's not a mess to clean.

Very tasty, we don't have lamb very often so was unsure how this would turn out, could not be more satisfied with the result. Reading the reviews I did add some balsamic vinegar and marinated in a gallon ziplock bag overnight turning and massaging it a few times. the leftovers made an amazing lamb curry a couple of days later.

I found this one of the best leg of lamb recipes that I have prepared.  It is a big more complicated than the non-marinade versions, but it produces a very nice result.

My only major variations were that I added the juice of the lemon along with the lemon zest.  I simply did not want to waste the lemon, and it seemed to work out well.  I also used the minced garlic in a jar primarily because I already had that handy.  My Dijon style mustard was Gray Poupon.  And due to my work schedule, I started the marinade process the evening before, meaning that the leg of lamb essentially was marinaded 24 hours.

My leg of lamb was roughly 7 lbs, and the recommended cooking time was underestimated quite a bit.  Instead of 50-60 minutes, it took me about 90 minutes or 1 bottle of malbec.  Use a meat thermometer so that you can plan to have your sides ready when needed.

I would recommend this recipe, and I would make it again.  I would give it  4.5 stars if possible, primarily because of the cooking time estimate being a bit off, at least in my case.

Very nice marinade. Had a 3-pound butterflied leg of lamb. Rolled it after marinating. Roasted @ 425 for 20 minutes, then ai 350 for about an hour until meat thermometer read 130. Let rest 15 minutes. Followed the marinade recipe, then added a bit of lemon juice. Husband loved it! Served with roasted summer squash from this site. Delicious!

The marinade for this is awesome! I have made it twice and each time the lamb turned out super tasty. I cooked it differently though, browned the lamb leg on all sides and the cooked it at 375F in the oven for 1 hour for 5 pounds and 1 hour and 20 mins for a 7 pound leg. Then with the drippings made a red wine based sauce with some thyme, rosemary, a bit of oil and green onions. Delicious!

I roast it in a corningware Dutch oven, taking the glass lid for the last 20 minutes to brown it, was juicy inside and caramelize the out side, always check the temperature before taking out of the oven.

Great and very flavorful recipe.  I need to find a cut of lamb that does not have so much bone in it.  Not a lot of meat in the cuts that I used.

Made the mistake of using lamb breast instead of leg of lamb -- almost no meat on it! But the marinade was absolutely delicious.

I marinated the lamb for 3 days and when I cooked it, the meat thermometer was broken so I couldn't gauge doneness. Needless to say when I cut the meat (after it sat for a couple of hours) it was still raw even though I cooked it for the time and at the temperature indicated. I ended up carving the undercookedlamb and putting the slices on the grill to finish cooking. Everyone loved it! Will definitely make it again.

I have never had lamb or roasted lamb. I was skeptical.
 I make a prime rib at home, so my spouse and I wanted to try a leg of lamb, roasted.  Used the directions on the package, along with rinsing the lamb, patted dry, rubbed with oil and scored and put in  garlic, rubbed with course salt, garlic powder and pepper, mixed and roasted adding no liquid whatsoever. Cooked according to package, starting with higher heat, then lowering the heat and roasting. Let rest in foil tent.
It was delicious, moist and tender...
My spouse said it rates just one notch under my Prime Rib (which I also got the recipe from allrecipes.)

Very good, but I did make a few changes to the cooking temp and time. I started the roast at 400 for 20 minutes then decreased the heat to 325 for another 2 hours. It was cook to medium and still juicy. I had the roast marinating for two days prior to cooking and the flavor was great. Will use this recipe again.

Excellent recipe! I didn't have time to marinate overnight so I did it for about 5 hours. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly....with wonderful results. Check the internal temperature regularly because mine cooked much faster than the recipe specified. I've added this to my recipe box as I definitely will use it again.

Surprised that this turned out so poorly.  I love lamb and have had luck with lamb chops and rack of lamb in the past, but this was so overdone it was like shoe leather!  I used a probe type thermometer to watch it cook accurately without having to poke it more than once or open the oven, so it should have been perfect.  Came out right at 145 as advised for medium rare.  Let it rest for 10 minutes.  It was so overdone it was hard to chew.  Don't know what the problem was.  I like my lamb rare or at the very least medium rare but this had no pink or red, just grey the whole way through.  Also, the outside was dried out and almost burnt.  It seemed like the honey in the marinade carmelized then burnt.  Perhaps it was my gas oven which burns baked goods, but I usually have better luck with roasts.   Barely edible unfortunately.  Obviously not the norm with this recipe looking at other reviews so something must have gone very very wrong.

I've only roasted lamb once before. The recipe was easy to follow and the results were great. Got a lot of compliments. Thanks! Only thing I would be careful about was the time to get to 145 F. It took a little bit longer than 60 mins @ 400F

I used this recipe to make my first leg of lamb.  I've had leg of lamb many times, but I had never made it myself.  It turned out GREAT!  I didn't change anything on the recipe except for the roasting temperature.  I did the first 20 minutes at 450, then reduced to 350 for the remaining time.

I cooked a boneless leg of lamb and it took more time than the recipe called for.  The lamb was very moist; however, a little bland. I served it with a red currant jelly/wine sauce.

Very tasty! We marinated it utilizing the vacuum sealer container method and it only took about 20-30 minutes to marinate.  Delish!

I had a last minute dinner party and a leg of lamb in the freezer. I did not have time to marinade, so I dropped the frozen lamb in a crockpot, made the marinade and slathered over the frozen meat, set on low and ran out the door for errands. I made a second round of the marinade to serve with the dinner and it was the hit of the night. Highly reommend this easy and delicious recipe.

It was a great meal! I had a smaller piece of lamb so could have roasted shorter for pinker but nothing was ruined. Thumbs up.

The flavor was very good. If you have a temperature probe, you'll be better off. I paired this with the "Roasted Rosemary Potatoes."  The two dishes went hand and hand.

Best leg of lamb we have ever had!  After 33 years of marriage, this was the first time I cooked the main course.  I followed the advice of adding water to the pan and balsamic to the sauce.  Absolutely outstanding results!!

What can I say...Delightful!!!  Followed the recipe with the exception that I stuffed the roast with many cloves of garlic, added water to the bottom of the pan and cooked to temp 165 degrees ( a nice soft medium)I was really proud to serve this dish.  Also, I served this with mint jelly on the side. The mint was a perfect balance to the flavor.  ps This was my Husband's first experience with Lamb and he really enjoyed it!!

Another 1st timer here, never fixed a roast lamb before.  Followed the directions to the T, except letting it marinate from late Sunday afternoon to cook time Tuesday night (actually forgot that it was in the fridge).  I am very inexperienced with roasts, and this one got charred on the top, but not TOO bad.  Its a practice roast for a small dinner party this coming weekend.  Thursday night I'll put together another roast, will heed advice of several reviewers, and hopefully it will come out a little better.  This first roast will get trimmed up and made into some lamb stew and frozen for another time.

What a great receipe!!!!!!  I will make this over and over again!  I didn't marinate the lamb over night but let it sit in the fridge for about 7 hours.  The trick is to sear the meat at a high temperature to lock in the juice.  I made this with greek style potatoes and sauted zucchini and tomatoes.  Yummm!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I tried this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was absolutely tasty!!  I used the 1 tbsp balsamic and lemon juice as suggested and I let it season for 2 days, the result was a flavorful, tasty and very mellow lamb.  I will be making this again.

Loved this recipe and it was my first attempt at making lamb! I had a 7 lb. boneless leg. As per AR reviews, I also added 1/4 c. balsalmic vinegar and 1/4 c. olive oil. I substituted the lemon zest with a splash of lemon juice, since I didn't have the zest. I marinated it for 2 days. I baked at 450 for 20 min. and then dropped it down to 325 (since I could also bake a sprial ham in a baking bag) for about 1 1/2 hours to medium. I have a family that likes their meat cooked and medium is as cooked as they get from me. It was very juicy and tender, and VERY flavorful. Everyone loved it and most of the family had never eaten lamb. Absolutely loved it! Will def make again!

Made lamb as was, with the exception I used foil to prevent burning. The lamb tasted wonderful, and the mustard was not over powering. It was wonderful.

First time lamb roaster...was nervous!  Used a bone-in roast (no shank) at 6.5 lbs. in my new convection oven.  Total cook time = ~1 1/2 hours.  Marinade was great, but I will insert garlic slivers next time as well.  Poured 2 C. water in pan and tented with foil.  Used the "Convection Roast" feature on my range and roasted for 20 minutes at 450.  Turned temp down to 400 for 30 min.  Removed, basted, added 2 more cups of water (probably used too large of a roasting pan, so water evaporated quickly), and inserted an electric probe thermometer.  Turned temp down to 350 and roasted until the temp hit 145 (about 40 minutes).  Removed from oven and let rest for 15 minutes.  (Had the meat tented with foil until it only had 10 degrees to go.)  It was done perfectly...areas of medium to medium-rare!  I tried the current jelly sauce theory, but it was quite bitter...probabaly because many of the drippings had charred.  Will try it again!

I liked the lamb and so did my guests, but the marinade didn't penetrate as much flavor into the meat as I would've thought it would from the smell of it  (I marinaded it over 24 hours before cooking). Would make again, but would revise the marinade to some degree.

This was an exquisite Easter dinner.  My grocer did not have fresh Rosemary and so I used a fresh mix of "roasting herbs" consisting of parsley, rosemary, thyme, and mint. This was the only alteration.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This was my first time to cook lamb and it came out great. The dinner guest loved it. I did add some Balsamic Vinegar and a touch of lemon juice to the marinade but other then that didn't change the recipe. Really good!!

Very tasty! I used 6 lbs lamb leg with the exactly same amount manaride, only alternation I made was inserting more garlic slivers into the lamb. The reviews were really helpful to me. I did put 2 cups of water into the bottom of my roast rack. I put the lamb in at 450 F for 20 minute without any burning( I also made a foil tent).and 350 F for rest of 2 hrs. T was 140 F when it done, but my baby thought it was too pink. But it tasted very good, and he kept eating!!

I love this recipe.  Did it for Easter for a block party this year and got rave reviews.  Did it again a few days later, cooking a 5 lb boneless roast for 2 hours at 300 degrees and liked it even better!!!  I did add a little extra lemon juice, mainly based on my preferences. I even used the marinade for a pork loin that I cooked a few days later.  Rosemary,garlic and lemon.  You can't beat it.

Very juicy and fall-apart tender. I still prefer my own garlic-roasted lamb roast to this sweet-tasting one, but this is an excellent recipe.

This reciepe is Great!
I had never made a roast leg of lamb, but wanted to have a go at making one. So i followed the recipe, (used lemon juice instead) did as instructed and it turned out to be delicious! Very moist, tender & full of flavour!
I would definately recommend trying this recipe. You can't go wrong!

Used this recipe for the 1st time my Mum & Dad came over to my new place.
Mum = Cookery teacher impossible to please when it comes to food
Dad = Very Fussy nothing spicey or with garlic or with onions or anything with a bit of flavour!!

I loved this recipe so easy and tasted great even though I only let it marinade for about 2 hours. My mum asked for the recipe (at last something she didnt know how to do better!! AND got a "not bad at all" out of my Dad which means it MUST have been Fantastic!! (Even with the garlic!)

Have tried it since leaving it to marinade longer and it only makes it better (and swapped lemon for lime because its all I had different flavour but just as good!)

I actually did two lamb legs, each about 4 lbs. and adjusted the recipe online for 12 people.  The first leg was much more tough and had more fat on it and I didn't care for it much.  But, the second leg was much more tender and juice, even after zapping it in the microwave!  I followed almost all advice and put 2 cups of water in the pan (still did burn a little), put tin foil over for the first 20 min at 450 degrees and then after another hour turned the temp down to about 330 degrees.  I will use the recipe again, but I will be careful how fatty the meat is and I might try one readers suggestion and cook in an oven bag for 2 hrs. at 300 degrees - might be more tender.  Overall, it was pretty good and all my guests thought it was really good.

Great recipe, i never cooked lamb before, so this was new for me. it came out good, though i'd suggest cooking it longer than the recipe calls for. it's nearly raw here.

This was SO delicious, I'm still enjoying it today.  I've never cooked lamb before and this recipe was perfect.  Everyone raved about how good it was and wanted to give it 10 stars if they could - thanks so much!!!
3/23 - Made it again this Easter - still FABULOUS.  Love this recipe!!
4/28/10 - Made this AGAIN this Easter - this time in the crock pot.  It was amazing.  Marinated it overnight, cooked in the crockpot for 8 hours on low.  Unbelievabley good, falling off the bone.  My favorite recipe on Allrecipes.com

This was absolutely delicious.  I did read the other comments and added water to the roasting pan.  I also sliced a long cut into the side of the leg and added the marinade into the meat as well.  It came out so much better than I expected.  This is a keeper. Thank YOU !!

Simply not as good as we expected it to be. The sugar actually caramelized and gave the drippings a burned flavor. The roast was not as moist as we liked.

I made this for Easter and it was wonderful!  I was nervous because I had never cooked lamb before, but it came out beautifully.  I did follow some of the other reviewers' advice and modified the recipe slightly.  I added two cups of water to the pan, put a foil tent over the lamb for the first 20 minutes, and lowered the temperature to 350 instead of 400 after the first twenty minutes.  I accidentally cooked it to 155 degrees instead of 130 and thought I had overcooked it, but it was perfect.  We made the leftovers into lamb pitas the next day, which was also delicious.  This will be our new traditional Easter dish!

This was a really good marinade! I didnt have ANY time to marinate the lamb and it was still great! the cooking time, which is the hardest part of making lamb for me, was perfect. I am going out to buy an after Easter lamb again just to try it marinated overnight.

Very tasty but I wish I had injected some of the marinade into the roast because it was only on the outside.  I bought an Australian boneless leg of lamb as Costco and it seemed a little fatty for me.  I guess I'm more of a steak person but good for once a year!  I did the water in the bottom of the pan but when I took it out, I noticed that it had dried and burnt at the bottom....oops.  Should have added more water, I guess.  I also tented it per others suggestions and glad I did because it got dark really quickly.  Because I was cooking other things, I had to keep it at around 375 for the whole thing.  I didn't time it, I was just watching my automatic thermometer.  Give this one a try!

WOW! Great lamb recipe. I left out the lemon zest and was only able to marinade for 6 hours, but I can't imagine it having turned out better.  I roasted the lamb in my clay cooker, fat side up, using a digital thermometer and it came out rare and juicy with a pan full of sweet gravy. Great for sandwhiches the next day too.

Even though I overcooked my leg of lamb, I am still giving this 5 stars. It was an excellent and easy marinade, and the taste was fabulous. I was sooo dissappointed that I overcooked my Lamb. However, I will try this again!!!

This was wonderful.  My daughter is usually a very picky eater, and wanted seconds.  That in itself makes this recipe a keeper, but hubby is already planning our next dinner party around this entree!  Thanks for this delicious posting.

This is a winner! I have felt deprived of lamb for years at home because of my Husband and Daughter.Well my picky eight year old gobbled it up and well my husband is coming around. The rest of the guest said it was better than in a resturant.THANKYOU!!! I did not change the recipe.It was great as is.

A long overdue review for this easy and fool proof recipe. I had been using this recipe for 6 year now. And had never change it. It is perfect just the way it is. 

Serve with roasted herb potatoes, a simple butterhead lettuce with homemade french dressing and you can impress your guest. Of course a good wine is a most.

If you are a first timer roasting a leg of lamb, this is your recipe.

Great recipe, very easy to make. I used my Pampered Chef Stoneware to make it in and it turned out Fantastic. I also used Lamb shoulder instead of the leg. We were very impressed and I will definitely make it again.

I baked this for Easter and got rave reviews! Even from a very die hard "I've never used anything but garlic in my Leg Of Lamb", friend. She even asked for the recipe when dinner was over!

The temperature of 450 for 20 is absurd. I tried that and it quickly cooked smaller parts of the roast. Cooking it at 350 for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. I also found the flavour to be bland. I marinated it for 2 days and the meat was not flavourful. I would not make this again. Lamb, yes, but a different recipe.

This was amazing!! I used balsamic vinaigrette with the ingredients and let it marinade in the fridge for two days. It took a little longer to cook, almost 2 hours until the inside was about 140-150 degrees and it was done perfect! I did add some water at bottom of pan and loosely covered it with tin foil. Could not stop eating it!

The best leg of lamb I have ever had.  So tender and tasty.  My wife loved it and wants me to make it again.  I did add 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar to the marinade and changed the cooking temp to 425 degrees for 20 minutes and then turned the oven down to 350 and cooked it until it reached an internal temp. of 145 degrees.  Also added 1 cup water to the pan.  Fantastic!

I cooked this today for Easter. It was fairly easy, however this roast was cooked too high for the time allotted. I followed the recipe however I took the lamb out at 50 minutes instead of 60 and it was over cooked. The flavor is still okay, however I highly recommend lowering the temperature and possibly the cooking time if you want it medium rare.

I didn't have time to let it marinade overnight but gave it about 6 hours. Also I let the meat reach room temperature before roasting. Couldn't have been happier with the outcome! Pulled it out as soon as it hit 145' and let it sit. First thought was, it's not going to be done. But once I started slicing, it was done to perfection at a medium to medium rare! Can't wait to try it again and let it marinade overnight.

It wasn’t bad, but I didn’t feel like it added any magic to warrant the marinating time.  Will go back to regular roasting with garlic and rosemary I think.

I marinated the roast overnight and the flavor was wonderful. I should have paid closer attention to the comments though, as the roast charred on the outside and was not done enough in the center using the temps as given. I would definitely use this recipe again.

This was my first attempt at making lamb of ANY kind.  I was impressed with how straightforward it was.  The video really helped, because it suggested adding lemon juice (recommended by one reader), which I did, and also putting foil over it if it was starting to burn.   My husband enjoyed it as much as I did.

I made exactly as written but only marinated a couple of hours.  The result was very good flavor and tenderness.  My big regret was that I did not think to line my pan with foil as the balsamic and honey combo made a very big stuck on mess!  I think I will eventually get it all off but warning to other cooks.

This was amazing! It’s an easy to follow recipe for a meal that cost you a pretty penny. My husband kids and mother in law loved it! I did add the lemon juice to the marinade as suggested by many reviewers and the meat was very tender. If you’re thinking about making this dish, think no more and just make it! I would suggest you line the bottom of the pan with foil as per the instructions. I failed to do this and it took a couple days of soaking and light scrubbing to get it off my cast iron baking pan.

The recipe is perfect. I just increased Dijon mustard, garlic, pepper, salt and rosemary quantity. I also kept it at 200 C for 1 hr 35 min for perfect pink medium rare.

I am new at this online recipe thing. I wish I had read the "most helpful" comments before hand: it would have saved my roasting pan from being destroyed by burned drippings. Next time I will 1) use lemon juice instead of zest and add Balsamic Vinegar and olive oil to the marinade, 2) reduce the heat to 400/325, 3) tent it except for last 15 min, 4) put water in the bottom of the pan (I do this for turkey, but didn't think of it in this case). My guests really loved it and I think these steps would make it perfect!

Bet leg of lamb ever.  The 24 hour marinade did the trick.  Super tender and I could taste it all; the rosemary, the Dijon, the garlic (and the ground fresh mint I added) that the long marinade infused subtly into the meat. It came out a gorgeous reddish tint with a fine crust/patina (ramped up the heat o 45 for the last 15 minutes).  I WILL make this again and again..  totally worth adding some mint to the marinade and doubling the garlic.

I changed the marinade a bit, we made this for a jewish holiday where they add honey for a sweet new year. So I added 1/4 cup of honey and a quarter cup of whiskey. I used the balsamic vinegar fresh chopped rosemary.

The honey and whiskey added a great flavour and removed a bit of the gaminess of the lamb. It also made an amazing gravy.

We didn't make any changes to this recipe except for putting it on the grill instead of using the oven.  The lamb was delicious.  We'll use this recipe again.

We substituted lemon juice for the zest (we didn't have a lemon) and added balsamic vinegar to the marinade.  It was a crowd pleaser and  we got requests for the recipe.

Very tasty!  I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used dried, and I blended the ingredients before adding the meat. And then I marinated it for 2 days. Those were my only changes.  My family really liked it, especially with the leftover marinade simmered down into a thick gravy.

I followed the suggestions to add olive oil, balsamic and lemon juice. I added a tad bit extra dijion to the marinade. I marinated it over night in a turkey bag. I cooked it at 300 degrees for 2 1/2 hours because I had to leave for church. It was medium well but so juicy and tender. I used the drippings and thickened it with cornstarch and used it as a sauce to top it. It was so wonderful. Everyone ate it even Rhodes who don't like lamb. I'm already having requests to make it again. This is going into my recipe box!

I followed the recipe exactly,  & will NOT be making it again.   It  was really bland, too sweet & the mustard  flavor just did not go well with the lamb.   I'm going back to my trusty balsamic vinegar and rosemary recipe.

I'm a over committed mom of 3 and I forgot to marinade overnight. Instead it marinade d only 3 hours. I also decided to leave the marinade on while in the oven. I set it to cook while we were at church so I set the timer for 1 1/2 hours at 350. It was perfect!!  This is now MY annual Easter lamb

Joe/Laurel were here for Passover and they all loved the lamb.  Did not have time to marinade it for overnight, but only a couple of hrs.  Had added the water.  Had used the granular Dijon.

I am on a low-salt diet and this recipe was packed with flavor, even though I left out salt and pepper, and used lemon juice instead of zest. The drippings were a great addition to the pan-fried carrots, celery, onions and potatoes served as accompaniment.

I made this following the directions, as well as the suggestions made by Sue Webb-Smith.  This was my very first leg of lamb, and I admit I was nervous.  It turned out to be spectacular!  Everyone, even the one guest who wasn't sure he would like lamb, never having tried it, went. Ack for seconds.  Thank you JMASS and Sue!

I put the roast in the roasting pan and poured remaining marinade over and around it.  By the time it had cooked at 450 for 20 minutes the marinade was completely evaporated/dry and starting to smoke.  Thankfully I was able to pour about 2 cups of water in the roasting pan to slow the process and the meat didn't not pick up the scorched taste but the "gravy" was certainly scorched beyond using.  Flavor of the meat was good but since I used a boneless leg of lamb it was very tough.  Won't use boneless leg of lamb ever again because this has happened before.

I followed the recipe amounts,  but  changed  it as suggested  on Susan's comment, added the balsamic vinegar and water and followed exactly the baking times, except baked 10 min less at 350.  Turned out fantastic. This was my first time cooking lamb.   Thank you.

Good recipe for Lamb and even use  it on Lamb shoulder steak and put the on the grill. This recipe helps with that lamb gamy taste that some people don't enjoy. Always a hit at my family Easter party and have to be sure to go with medium rare on it.

This was an easy recipe, and overall tasty. We had no complaints for our Thanksgiving dinner and it was beautiful! I added fresh sage and other herbs, which enhanced the flavor. If i do it again, I'd like to make more marinade, since you could only taste it if you hade the end slices. I'd put some extra salt in and probably try to use a mixture of marinade and broth to make the gravy. Overall, very happy.

I made the marinade exactly as written but  changed cooking technique based on another recipe.  I put the oven on broil and seared my boneless leg  on one side for 7 mins or so, then did same on other side.  I then reduced heat to 325 and roasted to an internal temp of 135, then let rest for 15 mins.  This resulted in a medium doneness.  I did add water based on other reviews, 1 cup initially, and added as the water reduced.  While the roast was resting, I made a sauce by adding red wine and thickening with a flour and water slurry.  This was my first try with a lamb roast (I usually do chops), and I would definitely make this again. It was delicious!

I made this using the marinade as a sauce to cook it in the slow cooker.  The only change I made was to add 2/3 cup of cooking sherry as a liquid to the marinade and I also made slices in the leg of lamb and inserted garlic cloves..  The Leg of lamb was boneless. Yummy.

This recipe turned out delicious.  I often struggle with getting lamb just right, but this tasted so yummy, I was sneaking pieces out of the pan long after I was full!  I'll be keeping this recipe!

I started with a boneless leg of lamb and trimmed all the fat off, which resulted in smaller pieces.  These I marinated for about 36 hours and then baked at 375 for 25 minutes.  Yum!  The only drawback was the rosemary, which gave a good flavor but was like hard little pellets to chew.  Next time I'll crush the rosemary or something beforehand.

OMG the first time making lamb and this recipe did not disappoint at all.  So tasty and juicy, I did listen to a few other reviewers and added the lemon juice and splash of balsamic to the marinade.  This lamb leg is out of this world

Made this tonight and had rave reviews for Easter dinner. Used the suggestions provided by Sue-Webb-Smith. I had to add more water to the bottom of the pan midway through. In the end I just recreated the marinade and added lime juice, red wine and butter to make a very tasty sauce. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Great flavour but the only thing was it needed to be cooked maybe 1/2 hr more.  I used the exact marinade recipe and placed all in a bag to sit for 2hours.   While cooking I did cover the roast with foil to prevent over browning and added water to the bottom of the pan.  Quite enjoyable.

I think the temp. is too high.  Next time I would try starting at 400C to sear and lowering to 325C and cook a bit longer.  I would also add broth to the pan to keep the drippings from burning.  It was delicious though!

I slit the lamb and stuff it with garlic. I also try to stuff some rosemary stigs in the slits. The flavour goes all through the meat then. I also add some lemon juice to the marinade. I have also coked this on a bed of sliced onions, it adds a lot of flavour.

This is the second time making this recipe. I also followed the suggestions of previous comments and went one step further by adding 1/4 cup Balsamic and 1/4 cup of Olive oil. I then put it through the blender before I poured it over the lamb in a freezer zip lock bag and then massaged it into the meat. This was then left to marinade for 24 hours.
The family loves this alternative meat choice.

I usually tweak recipes a bit but I kept to this one as it listed. It was wonderful and the family loved every bit of it. I made Guinness gravy to pair it with. Will be making as a yearly Christmas tradition.

This recipe is very good. Followed it as written but also followed the suggestions of adding water to the pan and baking it at 450F then 350 for an hour and back to 400F for 20 minutes. I also added a dash of lemon juice and balsamic vinegar. It was just perfectly moist and juicy. This was my first time baking a leg of lamb and got to say that it came out perfect. I would do it again on another special occasion.

I do not like lamb but this recipe made it delicious. I could not stop eating it. I omitted the garlic because I am not suppose to eat it. I used dry rosemary and I cooked it slow for several hours. I just bought another one. I hope it will be as good.

Very good!
I read reviews first and added about 1 cup of water to the pot, also added balsamic vinegar and olive oil to the marinade. I used lots of garlic to spike the meat, also added an onion. I put it into a covered cast iron casserole dish for about 3 hours on 340 F (had a 5 lbs. boneless leg) and it came out very moist and well done. Served it with fresh green beans, tzaziki, rosemary baked potato wedges (partially cooked and finished in the oven, while the lamb rested) and sweet potatoes. Thanks!

This was great. I did substitute orange zest for the lemon zest, and I also added a splash of lemon juice. I made the marinade twice, adding the second amount about half-way through the cooking time. Fantastic!

Very easy to prepare and cook.  Came out very well.
I used a boneless Australian Leg of Lamb and will use American next time.  The marinade was good but to me very basic, I prefer more of a Mediterranean flavor.  There was a net around the lamb since mine was boneless, next time I will remove this.  I let the lamb sit out for 20 mins prior to cooking, I will leave it out 30 next time as the core needed to be closer to room temp in my opinion as the center only reached 135 degrees and was slightly more rare than I'd like.  Otherwise a great recipe!

My roast took much longer than expected and it weighed slightly less than four pounds.  I will say that the clean up was tough because some of the liquid ingredients really burnt on.

I'm usually not a fan of overly sweet meat but this was perfect! I loved the cooking method, It made a nice crispy crust and tender juiciness inside! Thank you for this awesome recipe, I want to try it on chops next!

I let my lamb soak in the marinade for 2 days, but I could only taste it on the outside after being cooked.  I even put slits in the lamb.  I liked the taste, but my boyfriend said he didn't like something in it.  I'm thinking it's the rosemary.  The meat looked to be cooked nicely, but was still tuff when I cut it.  Might try something else next time.  It was ok though.

This was also my first time to fix lamb - and I must say - it was yummy and my family also enjoyed it!  I did add the olive oil and balsamic vinegar and also cut slits and inserted slices of garlic! Will definitely make it again!

Loved the marinade for the lamb.  I added a touch of balsamic vinegar as suggested by others.  I have to confess I thought it would end up being too sweet, but after roasting it turned out fabulous.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This got rave reviews from my children. It smelled wonderful but I do not eat lamb so I must depend on the rest of my family for a review. I had to cook my lamb a good 40 minutes longer to make it medium well, but I did use a bone in leg of lamb. I added about a 1 1/2 of water under the rack as the marinate and juices will soon char and burn. I also covered my lamb with a tinfoil tent to prevent any burning. Served with Au jus, wild rice and buttery lemon spinach from this site. Great Easter Meal.

Rosemary and lamb are a perfect combo. I added raspberry wine vinegar to the marinade (1/2 cup) and soy sauce (1/4 cup). Also used a mixture of fresh ground peppercorns.  After marninating overnight I slathered the lamb w/ Dijon mustard and pressed peppercorns into the mustard. This makes a nice crust.  Also, cut slits and actually insert garlic into the lamb while it marinates and bakes.  Yum!

Wow, I could not have cooked a better piece of meat.  It turned out very tender.  My guest loved it.  I marinated the meat for two days and cook it in red wine.  Thanks for the recipe, Grant

I presoaked the lamb in the rosemary mix overnight in the fridge then on Christmas morning I grilled the lamb. It was moist and part of my lamb was middle rare and another part was middle well done. My kids don't eat middle rare red meat like I do so I had to let the heat on the grill cook part of the meat more for them.  This lamb was the best lamb I ever tasted. My kids never had lamb before and they loved it.  My coworkers were impressed and thought I should opened an restaurant. Thank you so much for this recipe.  It was a hit at the party.

Following other AR reviews I roasted this at 325 for 2 hours with a pan of water beneath it.  The boneless leg of lamb turned out very flavorful and my husband couldnt get enough.  My 2 yr old, however, wouldnt touch it, and he is usually a carnivore. This recipe was easy, but not quick.  I will keep it for future reference.

I'm not a fan of lamb as it can be too gamey for my taste but I really like this recipe.  Like others I put in some balsamic vinegar and lemon juice into my marinade and put it in a tent.  The lamb came out medium and was tender and full of wonderful flavor.  I really think the marinade cuts the gaminess of lamb and the teste was wonderful.

This was great-first time I made lamb at home!  I also used this marinade for a pork tenderloin just in cast we didn't care for the lam-so we got 2 for the price of 1!!  I also, added about 1/4 c. Marsala wine to the marinade and it was great.

I'm not big on lamb but my husbands family loves it. This recipe was super easy and I didn't have to worry about leftovers. I had 6 pound boneless leg of lamb, cooked it in a roaster at 350 for about three hours, and that worked fine. I followed another members suggestion and added vinegar to the marinade.Thanks!

Made this for a large party.  The flavor was great but the lamb burned and I had to lower it to 375, 450 and 400 are just too high for roasting.  I'll try using an oven bag next time.

We cut the lamb up into pieces and the cooking time was much shorter. The lamb seemed a bit dry, but next time we will try to make sure the lamb is in its juices for longer.

The lamb was pretty good (though I cooked mine a little too long). I also made turkey chops with the same mainade and they turned out better than the lamb. It was a little sweeter than I like my meat though.

Excellent recipe! Everyone I made it for absolutely loved it. I made gravy from the pan drippings, but didn't even need it. The lamb was so moist & flavorful. A great dish I will be making often.

This recipe is not only easy but the taste is FABULOUS!  We can't wait to have the leftovers tonight.  I am going to make this the next time we have company.  My husband is not a big rosemary fan, but combined with the Dijon mustard, honey and lemon zest it really WOWS your taste buds.  We both loved it.

Well I made this today for an easter celebration for family and it turned out very good....the flavorings were very tasty...problem with the whole meal is that it turns out that my husband, myself, and our two young children HATE lamb....oops...but everyone else thought that it was wonderful. I used my food processor to make the marinade and it came out very nicely with a little olive oil in the mix. Thank you even though we didn't like lamb

I made this for Easter last year. This is incredible! I didn't have time to marinade it more than about an hour or two but it was still flavorful and juicy. I think this is the best meat dish I've ever prepared. I'm making it again for Easter this year.

This is fabulous!!!  My whole family loves this recipe, even those who usually find lamb a little "gamey" enjoy it.

We are not lamb eaters, but read this: My husband was waiting for me to make him a roast.  Well I made this one, he ate every bit for two days, practically licked the plate clean.  He said he loved the roast, I asked him if he liked "Lamb Roast" and he said no, then I told him that the roast was "Lamb".  He couldn't believe it, I will make this roast from now on!

Used this recipe on chops. Good but I still like the lamb chops with balsamic reduction better.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner.  I however did marinate the lamb an extra day and I also did as one person suggested and added some water so that it would not stick to the pan.  I had rave reviews.  I will definately use this one again!!!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly and my family couldn't have been happier about our Christmas dinner.  I served it with mint sauce, and my English husband and brother-in-law felt like they were back in England again.

I served this for Chanukkah dinner and it was a huge sucsess. I substituted orange zest for lemon only because I do not like lemon and used dreied rosemary. Everyone thought it was delicious I will make this again.

Ths was just fantastic! I added chopped onion to the marinade, as suggested by another rating. I put it on in the morning and had it for dinner. My company raved! I mixed a can of cream of mushroom soup with the juices. Delicious! I will definitely use this recipe again.

First time cooking lamb for me.  This recipe was great and very flavorful.  However, next time I will put some garlic inside the meat so the flavor will go all through it.  I marinated my 5lb boneless lamb roast for 2 days in double the amount of marinade.  I overcooked it I think though.  Next time will try using an oven bag at 300F for 2 hours as another has suggested.  This should make my roast much more tender.  I will definately cook this again and again.  I am going to try adding balsamic vinegar and lemon juice to the marinade as was suggested as well.  This is a keeper!

This turned out very good for me.  I cooked it for easter dinner and everyone loved it.  I cooked it at 345 for 25 minutes a pound until it was 160 degrees, or medium.  It was very tender and moist.. I just would have liked it to have a little more flavor.  I marinaded it for 2 days before cooking.  Next time I think I'll stuff it with some garlic cloves, and use more salt.  Thanks for the recipe, it was a big hit!

Yes, I tried this recipe for easter dinner lat night. Everybody seemd enjoyed saying" delicious and tender". But I wasn't satisfied. Even though I marinated for 2 days, the taste did not go into the middle of the meat. Maybe next time I should double the ingrediants for marinating, or put more wine to completly soak the meat.
Somebody suggested me to cook for 200C for 6hours after hight temperature.
I'd like to get some feedback.

We used the marinade to do rack of lamb instead of leg of lamb and followed the instructions. It was really good. We served as a side, the red-roasted potatoes, also found on this website. Extremely tasty. Thank you very much for this submission.

This was excellent--I'll not roast lamb any other way.  I had planned dinner for 8, but had 3 folks cancel last minute.  It's a good thing, as there was not bit of the lamb left!
