Let me just start off by saying that I have made this 3 times in 3 weeks and I am not one to repeat a recipe, let alone this often! There were some things changed, but not much. First, I used Hot Italian Sausage with casings removed instead of Andouille. Browned that with some minced garlic and onion, no butter or oil needed, and drained the meat. I added cooked bacon and this was a great addition! Used skim milk and fat free half and half, sprinkled cayenne, then with some garlic cheesy bread you have an AWESOME dinner!! (The Hot sausage does add a little bit of a red greasy layer on top- wish I knew how to eliminate that, but I don’t think it is possible with this kind of sausage, and that isn’t changing bc we like spicy!!) My fiancé begs for this now! Quick, easy, and delish!

I love this recipe, it is great to taste easy to make, I can easily serve with a clear conscience as i love food and i lover fat. I always put double cream in all my cream soups. sometimes I substitute cabbage for spinach. or bacon for sausage I always fry my meats prior to adding to the soups , I then brown my  white flour in a frying pan mix it with some of the liquids pour it in the soup to thicken it up , this makes the soup really thick. YUM YUM    thank you for the great recipe.

This recipe was really great! It reminded me of the yummy soup at The Olive Garden. It's not thick but has a good spicy flavor and tastes delicious. I took it to a church potluck and it was a hit!

I made this recipe for some clients and it was average. My professional opinion is that it was unnecessarily rich. A little goes a long way, but the bold Andouille flavor was an important element.

This soup was great!  My soup hating family loved it.  I did add some chopped celery in when I sauted the onions. When I served it I sprinkled some Cayenne pepper to my bowl after adding the cheese to give it an extra kick.

I used Turkey Polska Kielbasa.  Used half & half instead of heavy cream because that is what I had. Added ground cayenne pepper to give this recipe a little heat. Amazing recipe and Oh! so good.  I like a thicker soup so I used a small amount of corn starch with some of the hot soup that was added back to the pot to thicken.  Prepared this tonight and will have it for dinner tomorrow. Can't wait!!  Thank you! A keeper!

This is a good recipe ... i used polish sausage and little smokies and added some cajun seasoning to give it some pep. Also used less garlic. I made a big pot for our Christmas party with friends, they all loved it!

This is delicious.  My 4 yr old daughter asked if she could eat it for breakfast tomorrow.  I used polish sausage because that is what I had.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  I agree with the other reviewers that said it wasn't exceptionally "cajun" but maybe the other sausage would have made the difference.  It was exceptionally flavorful and will definitely be a regular at our house since everyone loved it.

Really good!  Although it wasn't quite as spicy as I hoped.  It really reminded me of the similar soup at the Olive Garden.

I love this soup.  To cut down on the heat I used 1/2 andouille and 1/2 beef brats.  Instead of italian seasoning I used the dried spices in the Parmesan Potato Soup recipe on this site.  2 cups of milk is way too much.  I used about 3/4 c and still thickened soup with 2 tbls of corn starch and water.  I didn't have Parmesan so I used Romano and added it directly to the soup - about 1 cup.

I got a good deal on portuguese sausage at Grocery Outlet (which I was told is pretty much the same as andouille) so I used that instead. I was trying to make this lower in carbs, so I used a full head of cauliflower instead of potatoes. I increased the chicken broth (using organic) and only needed about a 1/4 cup of fat free half-n-half to make a creamy soup and cut the fat content as well. Because I like a really garlic-y and onion-y soup, I used two onions and eight cloves of garlic. My "bunch" of organic spinach came in a package (6 oz.), which was plenty. Quick and hearty soup, made lighter with small changes. I'll make this again. It's like a kickier Zuppa Toscana. NOTE: To cut the fat a little more, I cooked down the sausage in a seperate skillet and drained all the cooked fat out, as well as blotted it well with paper towels.

It's OK. The soup itself does not have that much flavor, and it lacks depth. Too much cream/milk. I used half and half. If I made this again I would probably use half of the milk/cream quantity the recipe calls for. And I would use cajun seasoning. Also, I don't know why you would add the chicken stock 15 minutes after the potatoes. Cook the potatoes in the chicken stock. That should only take 10-15 minutes. And milk/cream should be added at the end and heated through only until hot.

Since this is such a rich soup and to cut the fat I did the following - 1 Tbsp evoo to saute the onion & garlic, 1 lb of andouille sausage, 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 1/2 cups of fat free evaporated milk.  I follow WW and 12 servings came out to 5 pts. and 8 servings was 7 pts.

this was wonderful, and exactly what i like to see in a recipe---inexpensive, simple to prepare, and delicious!!  i made a couple changes... used half and half instead of cream, and spicy italian sausage instead of andouille because that was what i had on hand, and i omitted the italian seasoning since it was in sausage already.  my husband loves this soup because it tastes a lot like the zuppa toscana from the olive garden!  i will be making this again : )  thanks for great recipe

If you are looking for a true 'cajun' soup, then you might be disappointed.  If you are looking for a delicious and hearty Italian soup then you will be thrilled.  I made my soup extra thick by adding extra potatoes, parmesan cheese, and sausage and turned it into a thick stew served with bread.  My family loves this recipe.

For those that experienced the grease on the top of the soup, I would recommend baking the sausage prior to adding to the soup. I do this with my jambalya and other recipes that call for sausage. I am looking forward to making this.

This soup was excellent and loved by all except my 12-year-old who simply does not care for anything creamy or spicy. I would have been very surprised if she did like it. I made a few changes that did not alter the basic recipe, though. One thing that I felt was important was the size of the sausage pieces. I halved them lengthwise before slicing them so they would be more bite-size. I'm glad that I did this. I also could not locate a fresh bunch of spinach other than an entire big bag, so I opted to try a box of frozen already chopped package. It was perfect and made the recipe even easier and less time consuming. I also used one more potato than the recipe called for and it could have used even more. Next time I'll add about three extra potatoes. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe. It was so tasty despite the fact that the only spice used was the Italian seasoning. The andouille sausage provided all the spice that you would need. Yummy!

Good Solid recipe. Everyone likes it and requests it even but I still feel like there's something missing. I've tried using different greenery (kale, mustard greens & collards) and I've tried different kinds/brands of sausage. If you're trying to get the taste of Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana then this isn't quite it, but it's definitely an acceptable second.

I used Italian sausage instead of the andouille. I also used Romano cheese instead of Parmesan, because I had some left over from another recipe. Family LOVED it. Told me to save in my recipes to make again. I also used a potato masher once the potatoes were soft so that it was more smooth. It's a really good recipe and you can deviate to make it fit what you already have. I loved most that it only used 2 tsp of Italian seasoning, but still came out so tasty. As another reviewer said it is very reminiscent of an Olive Garden soup.

Loved this soup.  I added about a half pound of Hot Italian sausage and about a pound of pear and gouda sausage instead of the andouille.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream, and kale instead of spinach.  I put just a touch of flour in while frying to thicken it up a little bit.  Oh, I also put a few dried red peppers from a bush that I have hanging as well as some Dave's Insanity sauce, to add a little kick.  Went great with some buttered Dave's bread.  Easy to make, and oh so satisfying.

This was very tasty soup. I wouldn't call it cajun though. It was more like Italian. Either way it was really good.

This soup was really easy to make and was extremely tasty.  I did subsitute the milk and heavy cream with 2 cans of evaporated mil, but the taste was not compromised.

I to enjoy the cajun flavor. This is the first time I cooked this and I used Louisiana "Bayou Blend" cajun seasoning in lieu of Italian seasoning and "Old Bay" seasoning in equal amounts. I also used a little Louisiana Hot Sauce. This gave it the required Cajun Flair....All my family loved it. See Photo.

I have to say the first time I made this I was saying it wouldn't work because it was bass ackwards.  But I continued with the recipe only adding a head of chopped cabbage and putting a bag of frozen corn in close to the end.  I was getting ready for card night and thought I may have to resort to another meal.  I didn't, this soup turned out great and has became my new #1 replacing the Delicious Ham and Potato Soup recipe on the site.  Since then I have made the soup several times and have made it the same was each time.  My photo shows the corn and cabbage, Oh so good...  Two thumbs up, Thanks Chris.

Absoulutely fantastic. My friend and I were making this quickly, and we had so many instances where we thought we would botch this recipe. This recipe refused to die, regardless of how badly we injured it, and it tasted perfect. I recommend this to everyone and anyone- it's just plain delicious.

absolutely AMAZING!!!!! Made this for first time tonight and was told many times that it was BETTER than Olive Garden's! I used regular ol Jimmy Dean sausage, added ceyenne pepper, used all milk no heavy cream and thickened it a little with cornstarch. You definately dont NEED the butter & olive oil, the grease from the sausage is plenty! Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!! It was also very simple to make.

Absolutely loved this recipe, but made with kielbasa instead, as that is what I had on hand.  Had to make it again a few days later for a friend who insisted I give her the recipe.  Want to try with the andouille sausage next time.

We just had this for supper this evening. Oh my goodness, it's the best soup we've ever had. I added a little more andouille and some seasoned salt and used chicken stock. Fabulous!

OMG.  This was amazing.  I have to admit I changed it a bit for what I had available.  I only had 2.5 links of chicken andouille sausage so I addded 4 strips of bacon.  I didn't have an onion so I used 2 celery stalks.  I only had fresh rosemary and thyme so I used 1 TBSP of each then 1/2 tsp of dried basil and oregano.  We ate it in rosemary bread bowls-  YUM. This will put the pounds but we don't care- this will be a regular winter recipe for us!  It is more Italian than Cajun but not at all like Olive  Garden- ew!

Absolutely delicious!  I meant to make this as a side to a main course but ran out of time to make the main dish.  This wonderfully flavorful, rich and zippy soup filled the gap wonderfully.  I entertained some family and they all loved it.  I would change it to make the sauce a tad bit thicker, but other than that, I only added a bit more spiciness to give it more of a kick.  Will use again for sure!  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Very good.  My hubby said that it was one of the best soups that I have made so far and I cook soup just about every Sunday.  I used one pound andouile sausage and one pound boudin cajun sausage.  It worked out well becausee the boudin is made with rice and when it was cooked it fell apart in the soup and gave it a great flavor and I think helped thicken the soupl.  Both kids liked it..Will for sure make again!

The basic recipe is very good, however I added a few things - chopped celery, green onions, Italian parsley, cajun seasoning, and Tabasco.  My family said this was a "keeper:.  I served it with Garlic bread with parsley and cheese.

This is an excellent soup. I have used frozen spinach and polish sausage. I doubled milk, chicken broth and Italian seasoning since I like my soups more soupy. We really enjoyed it.

So amazing . . . everyone LOVED it!  I used polish kielbasa and cooked bacon instead of the andouille sausage, and I also added the spinach at the same time as the potatoes so it would wilt.  Seriously, this soup is ridiculously good, and OMG, your kitchen will smell fabulous.

I made this soup vegetarian, and it turned out great. I love the idea of adding the spinach.  I felt it needed some seasoning since I left out the sausage.  I added Tony's Creole seasoning and a good amount of smoked paprika.  I also threw in some sharp cheddar cheese.  It was excellent!

This is so good.  I used turkey sausage, taken out of the casings and browned with the onion and garlic.  To make up for the lack of flavor there, I added red pepper flakes.  Otherwise followed exactly, and it was great.  My 18 year old son ate nearly the whole pot himself the day I made it.  Thanks Chris!

Used andouille chicken sausage and sprinkled on a bit of cayenne for added heat.  I also used frozen milk and frozen half and half, it is really tasty (eating it right now).  Can't wait to see how it is on the 2nd day. I used a teaspoon of Tuscan seasoning blend I made from the following, a recipe from a cooking class I took recently: ½ c. dried basil, ½ c. dried oregano, ½ c. dried marjoram, 3 T. dried minced onion, 2 T. dried minced garlic,2 T. dried rosemary,2 T. dried parsley,1 t. crushed red pepper

I made this for a  buffet luncheon I had and it got great reviews. I used hot links because andouille sausage was not available in my little area grocery store.  I subbed water for the chicken broth and used 4 - 12 oz cans of evaporated milk instead of cream. I added about 2 cups of spicey american cheese queso for a little twist and doubled the parm cheese.  My husband sugested next time to add bacon to it and I also thought adding shrimp, crab or musels would be good also.

I used pan sausage since I didn't have what was called for.  It was good.  However, next time I will leave out the sausage entirely.  I really liked the spinach and potato together though.  Good recipe.

I tried it again w/o the sausage.  I feel it is a 5 star recipe w/o the sausage.

I followed the suggestions of prior reviews using celery, andouille and smoked sausage. I did not need the butter and oil due to fat from meat. I also added about a TPS of tony's cajun seasoning. It turned out wonderful. My fiance loved it. We like spice and the type of sausage you use will make the difference in what you are looking for in the soup.

Yummy! I made it with regular sausage (because I didn't have anything else) and used all milk (not cream) and a bit of flour to thicken it up a bit. I also added some salt and pepper. It was very flavorful and I loved the spinach addition! It made those crappy two-month old potatoes that I had taste amazing! Overall, this was a tasty and easy everyday dish!

I'd give it 7 stars if I could! This is one of the best soups I have ever had! My husband and I loved it so much and I even took some over to my parents for them to try! I substituted the sausage for german sausage, and used red potatoes instead of russet. It was delicious and I will be making it a lot this winter!

This was delicious!  Of course, I modified it somewhat according to what I had on hand.  I diced and sauteed a half pound of bacon, drained it, and added.  Reduced Andouille sausage to 12 oz. which I also sauteed to reduce fat content.  Used half and half and 2% milk..  I'll use non-fat half and half and 1% milk next time.  Added diced celery which I sauteed with a bit of the bacon fat and onions.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes.   Omitted Italian seasoning and used Creole seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper instead.  Omitted parmesan cheese and added 4 oz. Cheddar-jack cheese.  This is the perfect fall and winter meal, served with cornbread or garlic bread.  I will be making this again.  This is my favorite All recipes recipe!

I have served this soup over a year now and everyone in my family is hooked on it. I have never had a better potatoe soup with some real kick. I have added a little more spice to it by adding a few drops of tobasco sauce and a dash or two of ground red pepper. I will make this soup for as long as I can cook!

Easy recipe. Couple of changes:
- Added flour while cooking to thicken
- Too thick as leftovers :) and added chicken broth when reheating
- A little bland, so I added a bit crushed red pepper to each bowl - YUMMY!!!

I made the soup as is and added a few more seasonings (ie: cayenne, white pepper, and paprika).  It came out absolutely delicious!  The person who earlier commented that it was like an Olive Garden soup was spot on.

Love this though I skip the andouile an use chorizo.  Make sure you cut it into small pieces and no oil or butter is necessary.  I also skip the spinach, cause I only like it raw.  Thanks for sharing!!

I had high expectations for this soup and it didn't deliver on all the lofty five star reviews. Maybe my taste buds are out protesting on Wall Street. They certainly didn't fancy this soup, though.  It was milky but not in a creamy, delicious way-- but rather, in a runny, unsubstantial way. It was flavorless despite my choosing a spicy sausage to grace it's milky boringness.  I definitely wouldn't make this again.

Great comfort soup!  I had some leftover venison sausage that I used-it was a spicy sausage-and it was perfect!  Love it and will for sure be making this one again!!!

My new favorite meal!  Wait til you smell it cooking.  YUM.  It is easily halved & a half recipe makes about 8 cups soup.  Each cup is 8 Weight Watchers Points LOL.  One time, we substituted the andouille with smoked sausage, just to make it more appealing to the kids (they don't like anything spicy), but it's just not the same.  LOVE THIS RECIPE!

Absolutely excellent soup!!  I did change the chicken broth to vegetable broth (and used 32 ounces) and then just used a quart of half and half.  Once everything was cooked and ready, I thickened the soup with a little cornstarch.  Fantastic!!

This soup was delicious! I followed the recipe, except I substituted the heavy cream for about 1/4 cup of fat-free half and half, and used skim milk for the rest of it. I also didn't have any parmesan cheese, but I didn't miss it at all.

This is a really good soup.   I opted to use Hot Italian Sausage instead of Andouille, but used cajun seasonings instead of italian ones.   Served it with beer bread.

OMG!! This was a very tasty and hearty soup. Like some of the others, I too added more heavy cream and sausage to make it thicker.  I took some to work and end of bringing the left overs to work to share. Will certainly make this again.

So yummy! tasted very similar to Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana. I used HOT turkey sausage and left the peel on the potatoes.  My husband loved it. I am sure I will make it again soon!

This is not a "cajun" soup at all, but it is still good. To make it even more like the Olive Garden soup it reminds me of I used kale instead of spinach and spicy italian chicken sausage. It was a big hit with my roommates.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and myself and it was GREAT. This is the first recipe I've tried from here and I was very pleased, my boyfriend loved it so much he ate the left overs for breakfast this morning haha. He said it was even better the next day. :) I did add some bacon and green onions but everything else I followed exactly.

WOW!!! This is great comfort food. I followed the recipe exactly. There is nothing else needed. I would not change anything. It really hits the spot on a cold damp evening. Thanks for the post. We will make this often. I can't wait to serve this to company.

This soup tasted really great! With the following modifications, it was perfect for my family. I drained the sausage mix well before adding it the soup and used condensed cream of celery soup instead of heavy cream just to make it healthier. I used one whole onion instead of half, and added a whole chopped fennel to the potatoes.

This is almost word for word the same recipe I use for Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana. Instead of spinach, it calls for 1 bunch of kale and 2 lbs of spicy Italian sausage instead of andouille. Every thing else is the same. Both versions are delicious!

Very good soup!  I was leary bc I detest cajun spiced food.  The only cajun influence here is the andouille sausage.  More Italian than Cajun, in my opinion.  Thanks for sharing & will make it again & again.

I am very impressed by this soup. I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out due to the mixed reviews, but it's one of the best soups I've ever made! I did make a few small changes to the recipe- used hot Italian sausage, added one medium leek, kept the skin on the potatoes (to add a rustic texture, plus nutrition), and I added about 2 teaspoons of chili powder to bring up the spice a little more. Also, I reduced the amount of chicken broth (only 2 cups) and simmered it a little longer (about a half hour) in order to thicken it up. Overall, a great recipe that will be no stranger in our household!

This was a very delicious, comfort food soup.  My family asked me to put it in the "make it again" book (which is actually a high compliment).  I did use creole seasoning instead of Italian, beef stock instead of chicken (only because that's what I had on hand) and half and half instead of cream.  I also added celery to the onions and garlic.  Yum!

this was an awesome soup but I needed to tweak it to make it more cajun ;)  I added 2 stalks of celery chopped fine with the onion and garlic.  I omitted the cheese and substituted the italian seasoning with 2t salt, 1t coarse black pepper, 1t thyme, 1/2t cayenne, and 2 bay leaves.

Great flavor!  I used the idea of the 4 cups of broth with 2.5 cups of evap. milk/nonfat milk.  Putting flour in the oil will make a roux to thicken the soup.  I use about a 1/2 lb of bacon instead of the sausage and it made the flavor fantastic!  Also substituted green beans for the spinach.  I will definitely make this soup again!

We both like spicy but the andouille may have been a little too spicy.  The broth was excellent.

This soup is our absolute favorite!  I have cooked it as in the recipe, which  is fabulous but once I was set to make it only to discover that someone decided andouille would make a great sandwich so was left with half.  I improvised and used 3/4 pounds of bacon along with the andouille.  Everyone liked it even better this way.  I just use the bacon grease $ eliminate the butter.  I also add a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning for a little zip.

The ratio of potato, sausage onion seemed off to me, so I added a twice as much onion (which cooks down) and this was very tasty and did not disappoint.   I didn't find it too rich, and thought it definitely had a restaurant quality.

I pretty much followed the recipe but since I didn't have cream I used evaporated milk.  It looks beautiful is really delicious, just the right degree of spiciness for me.  I plan to share it with friends, the soup and the recipe.

I just made this. Since it is called Cajun potato soup, I used Cajun seasoning instead of Italian seasoning. But I followed the directions for everything else. It is quite delicious and easy to make.

Very comforting especially on a chilly and rainy night!I did a mix of sausages and dark chicken.  I eyeballed the cream until desired thinness/thickness.

We had some leftover red potatoes and sausage from a shrimp boil and I was looking for recipes to use them all.  I'm so glad I found this one! Since they were both already cooked, I just chopped them up and followed the recipe. The only change I had to make was to use kale rather than spinach because that was what I had at home. Delicious combo of flavors!

Fantastic if you are into potato soups or chowders. I make the recipe exactly as stated except for the chicken broth. Usually I use broth made from marinated chicken for the grill or some form of broth coming from a slow-cooker dish. The dish is GREAT and have some in the freezer on stand-by all the time.

Delicious and so easy to throw together!!  I had a 14 oz. package of the sausage and some spinach to use up.  I made a half recipe with a few minor adjustments.  I used 4 medium red skinned potatoes-not peeled; I used just under 2 cups of chicken broth (didn't want to waste the can once opened) about 2 1/2 cups of fat free half and half instead of the milk and cream and about 6 oz. of spinach.  Once ready I tasted and decided to add a few shakes of salt and pepper and one packet of chicken bouillion (the salf free kind) to suite my taste.  I served it with hot garlic bread.  I think any sausage would work with this soup.  Perfect for this snowy night!!  Hubby had 2 big bowls and packed up a big serving to have for lunch tomorrow...enough said!  Thanks for this recipe-it's a keeper.

This recipe is 4 stars without my changes...

- Used about half as much heavy cream. Added more chicken stock instead.

- Left out the Italian seasoning. Added 1-2 TBSP "Tony Chachere's original creole seasoning" and about 1 TBSP dried parsley instead.

- Used red skinned potatoes, sliced, with skins left on, instead of russet potatoes.


The creole seasoning MAKES this recipe! :)

I made this for super tonight.  It was super easy, and I used fingerling potatoes instead, as that is what I had on hand.  I sliced them in the food processor and it made cute little circle-shaped potatoes that made the soup look extra nice.  Delish.

My family of 8 LOVES this soup.  It's the only one they ask for time and time again.  I used more sausage (only because the package was larger) and frozen chopped spinach because that is what I had available.  I plan on playing around with this soup a little bit this winter by making a few changes (such as almond milk and coconut milk vs. the milk and cream since I have a child with some dairy issues and also changing the russet potatoes to sweet potatoes)

Doubled the recipe and reduced the cream in half. It turned out delicious. I took this to a soup pot luck and everyone loved it! I barely had enough left after the event. A must soup to make in the fall!

This soup was yummy, but I did make a few changes.  I used 1 pound andouille sausage and 1 pound of mild italian sausage.  I would have used hot, but was afraid it would be too spicy for my 3 young children.  I also add half a pound of fried bacon.  I wasn't crazy about how thin the soup was so made a rue and added it to help thicking up the soup, more like a chowder.  I did omit the spinach because my kids wouldn't have touched the soup with it in.  It was great!  next time, I will probably make 1/2 the recipe in a seperate dish for hubby and I and add the spinach!  I will definitely make this again.

This soup is really easy and tasty. I usually use kale instead of spinach because I think it holds up better when packing left overs. I also add a little bit of cajun seasoning. It has to be really good since this is one of the few dishes I make that my husband will eat!

This was a most fabulous recipe and I found that it did remind me of my favorite soup at Olive Garden. The andouille sausage was a new experience to me. I found it delicious, however, I have some family that likes a milder taste. Next time, I will try 1lb of kielbasa and 1lb of the andouille.

This was an amazing soup. My 11 year-old raved and made “Mmmmmm” sounds while eating. It has quite a bit of prep, but not unmanageable. It let it simmer longer than stated and made it a bit thicker as it is not a really thick soup and I like my creamy soups to be on thicker side. I did use the andouille in the recipe, and it added a lot of flavor. The next time I make it I am going to try Italian sausage.

OMGosh! This was a HUGE hit here at the home front. I think this is our new favorite winter soup. Couldn't be easier to make. Loved it. Instead of spinach I used Kale and it was wonderful.

I was not impressed by this recipe.  I assumed that with the heavy cream, this would be a cream soup, but was as thin as water.  The flavor was ok, but there is a lot of Italian seasoning, to the point of excessivez

This soup was AWESOME! Thank you so much for posting this. The only changes I made were adding crushed red pepper flakes and a little creole seasoning...Super Yummy!

This recipe was WONDERFUL!!!! I don't normally comment my "fixing" of recipes, but in this case I will agree with others when they say it wasn't overly spicy. In my case, I sprinkled (a rather generous amount) some ancho chili powder over the sausage while it cooked and also added some hot pepper juice. Took the soup to a work luncheon and it was gone!

I changed it a bit.  I added 2 bay leaves, 1/2 teaspoon cayenne, 1 teaspoon dried thyme.  Omitted the Italian seasoning.  Used half and half in place of heavy cream.  Could not find andouille so I used smoked sausage.

Easy to make, and quick.  I did add less than 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne during cook time.  Mine seemed to need more potatoes, 6 medium were not near enough.  Excellent, and I will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing!

I made the soup last night and it was really good. I used the andouille sausage, as well as smoked sausage in it. My family loved it. I will definitely cook it again.

One of the very best recipes I've gotten from the internet. You can use any hot, spicey sausage you like. I used 1 that was $5/2 lb versus the andouille for $5 per lb.. Did not add butter or oil. Threw everything together in a crock pot on low until potatoes were done to my satisfaction. Used milk w/constach instead of the heavy cream & forgot to add the cheese. Served it with a loaf of french bread & butter. It was fantastic. My guests& family loved it. Absolutely will make again. Thank you for the recipe.

Tasted pretty good. Did have some grease that was on the top of the soup, but got most of that off with some paper towels. Would be good with some added bacon, and probably some celery.

I'm so happy,I made this soup tonight and I just love it! I didn't have adouille sausage,I had some deer/pork and some just plain but spicy pork sausage and the soup came out fine. My son said 'Pretty good',I'll be sure to make this again.

Good Recipe! Very filling and loved the spinach. But when I make it next time I will skip the olive oil and go with a fresh sausage for more flavor. Maybe even a pan sausage.
