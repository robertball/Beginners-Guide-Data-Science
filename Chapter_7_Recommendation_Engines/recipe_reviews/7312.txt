Important: after reading how chocolate-less this cake seemed to be I used 5 TIMES the amount of chocolate required. I followed the rest of measurements exactly (only I used brown sugar instead of white, and plain unbleached flour that I sifted -instead of cake flour). This cake turned out fantastic, moist and rich!  I added a thin layer of homemade frosting on top, although this is really optional.

I was looking for a cake with some good chocolate flavour and and this was not it.  As per previous review it is probably something children might like.

great cake. I made it for cupcakes & they turned out really good. I tripled the amount of chocolate though & I still felt like it needed more chocolate & sugar.

This is the first 'from scratch' cake that I've found, that my family likes better than a mix! It is less sweet, and more moist. We love it. I added an extra half cup grated chocolate directly to the batter (unmelted), and substituted soy yogurt for the sour cream. Also substituted 1/4 cup applesauce for one of the eggs. Delish, and healthier!

Well. The good news is, if you are an utter nimrod who's having a bad baking day and forget to add the baking soda, this cake still manages to come out right. That said, I would tend to agree that it doesn't quite deliver in the chocolate category, but if you're not looking for a cake that isn't OVERWHELMINGLY chocolately, this is certainly a good one.

Very good and wasn't greatly difficult to make.
My whole family greatly enjoyed the cake, it was moist and wasn't too rich.

This was so good!  I did use 2 cups of semi sweet chocolate, not the 1/2 cup recommended in the recipe.  I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips, instead of shaving the chocolate myself.  I LOVED IT!

very simple to makee honestly, if you dont multiply the chocolate by at LEAST 5 , then you may as well just eat dirt.. with that amount of chocolate, this cake is delicious. to make icing i use: dark chocolate chocolate hazelnut spread and butter :)

Not enough chocolate flavour! Nice texture, light and fluffy, but really let itself down with the lack of chocolate.

I made this cake for my birthday and it was amazing! Super moist, and I didn't even add any icing. I loved it! The only disadvantage is that it is very time consuming. But I think it's very worth it!

I really enjoyed making this cake with a few changes. I melted 1 pkg of Chipits milk chocolate chips, because that is what I had on hands (it comes to about 1 cup). I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and added the sour cream last, after everything. I also added a strawberry puree filling after they were baked. Pretty decent base recipe to experiment on!

This cake was light and moist, without much chocolate flavor.  I did kind of like it, even though I would definitely add a LOT more chocolate if I made it again.  But I can see how some people who aren't huge chocolate fans would find it very tasty.

This is a very good cake mix. The only reason I give this recipe four stars is because of the process of melting which takes quite a while. As I saw the other reviews, I doubled the amount of chocolate called for in the recipe.

this wasnt very chocolatey at all!  I frosted it with canned frosted and that was the best part.  I don't know why- but it reminded me of a dessert they used to make in my school lunchroom when I was a kid- only that was better!

I doubled the amount of chocolate in this and also added an additional three teaspoons of cocoa powder. I also substituted the sour cream for heavy cream. When this was done i filled it and covered it with chocolate ganache. It was definitely the best cake i've ever made.

I substituted plain yoghurt (no sugar or sugar substitue) for the sour cream and a tablespoon of cream cheese instead. Beautiful rich, yet light and spongy chocolate cake!

I give this four stars because it is so easy to make and comes out very moist and yummy.  I would give it five stars but like others here have stated, it really is not chocolatey enough and if you're making chocolate cake, you want to taste chocolate, right?  Next time I will add 5x chocolate as recommended by other reviewers here.  To make it even easier, I used Nestle Tollhouse pieces because I had them on hand and they tasted great melted. It worked just fine so no need to grate chocolate.  I also added some vanilla and coffee to the chocolate, and used buttermilk instead of sour cream because that's what I had on hand.  Also, I only used one cup of sugar (I don't like things overly sweet) and I think next time I will reduce that further to 3/4 cup. I also used 1/4 cup veg oil and 1/4 cup butter instead of the 1/2 cup butter.  Next time I would like to try plain yogurt to replace the sour cream. I will definitely add more chocolate!

I made this for my mom's birthday, and WOW!!! Per recommendations, I doubled the chocolate. I also replaced the sour cream with kiefer, and then added half a pack of pudding. I was careful to not over bake.  For the frosting, i whipped fresh cream and another 6 oz of dark chocolate.  I sliced the layers in half to make an extra two layers, and then topped the whole thing with chocolate curls.  This cake is good chilled or at room temp.  My favorite chocolate cake recipe; makes a beautiful restaurant quality cake!

great for if your running low on time, very mellow chocolate flavor, i used about 3/4 cups of unsweetened chocolate and they turned out great for a spare of the moment cupcake - baked @ 350 for 20-25 minutes

Amazing! I loved this recipe.  Very easy. I had all ingredients on hand. I used half dark chocolate and 1/2 semisweet. It was great even without frosting.

I agree with many of the other people the texture was great, but it was lacking chocolate flavor. I added Twice the amount chocolate

I read a lot of the reviews before I made this cake....added extra chocolate as many reccomended.  I found the cake still not chocolate enough and didn't like the texture... A little sponges for me.  Not sure if it was due to the extra chocolate.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to increase the chocolate to 3 cups of semisweet chocolate chips and increased the milk to 3/4 of a cup.  Only baked for 38 minutes and it came out extremely dry.  I followed everything else to the letter.  I think I should have increased the milk to at least a cup.  If I make this again, I think 2 cups of the chips would have been plenty and a cup of sugar rather than 1 1/2.  It's very sweet.

I made this for my nephew's birthday and the adults said it was the best birthday cake they'd ever had. Easy and fabulous!
