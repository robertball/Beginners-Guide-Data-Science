I'm the submitter of the recipe.  The dumpling preparation is all wrong my version is different.  You work the dumpling dough adding a bit more milk if needed to just make the dough come together.  Then ROLL the dough out to about a 1/4" thickness.  Then using a pizza cutter cut the dumplings into squares.  DO NOT DIVIDE DOUGH INTO 12 PIECES.  You will end up with undercooked dumplings.  This is way too much dough to divide into 12 pieces.

I've been making this for years and my family loves it.
 I do not use the cream of chicken as I thicken my base with broth and a a little cornstarch. I also add shredded carrots and if hubby request I add potatos.
 I use 1whole chicken. This is really good for those wintery days.
For more kick add a shake of dried hot pepper, garlic, old bay

I just made this for my family and it was absolutely delicious! I did make more dumplings because I like lots. Next time I think I'll add carrots and celery too.

Awesome recipe. First time making dumplings from scratch and they came out very good. My husband said it tastes just like his grandmas except she didnt take the chicken off the bone just served it whole in the soup.. I think I will do that next time.

Very good!  I cheated though and used canned Biscuits, I cut them into 6ths (because I bought the jumbo ones)  It turned out great!  And was so easy!

The chicken was delicious, the dumplings as written (we made 12) took WAY longer than 20 minutes to cook through. After 45 mins we decided to cut them in half and cook them (it was getting close to 8pm and the husband was starving!)
We rated the chicken about a 5 star but the dumplings about a 2. We also had to add more milk to the mix in order for the dough to bind together (it was really flaky). 
We'll try again but make mini dumplings next time :)

My family loved this recipe!  It had a real nice flavor and so easy to make.  I added carrots and celery in with the onions.  My only concern was that it might have been too watery.  I covered the chicken with 32 oz of broth and a little extra water.  Then afterwards, I added the one can of soup. It looked watery then, but it still called for 2 more cups of water.  I thought maybe the dumplings were going to soak up a lot of broth and that is why it called for so much liquid.

I made a couple of modifications, which I highly recommend and the result was exactly what I was craving; the perfect wintry day comfort food!  I added 4 carrots and 4 sticks of celery, because I just love the veggies in this soup.  I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and substituted lard for the shortening.  Lastly, I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (look for the kind with herbs) and eliminated the water and the salt.  Thanks!!  I will definitely make this again!!!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I agree with other reviewers to omit the final 2 cups at the dumpling stage. The next time I plan to add some additional veggies ,corn starch and a couple teaspoons of marjoram. Be sure to read the writers amended dumplings instructions dated Aug. 16th 2010 as the dumplings turned out well and cooked with the intended outcome.

Absolutely delicious!!  I altered it some by adding 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and made the dumplings about half the size as originally suggested.  My family loved this and it is going in my recipe box!

I had to use cream of mushroom soup as they dont have canned chicken soup at my local supermarket! (in norway). But it was very good, added some veg obviously as on its own it isnt a "proper" meal and is beige in colour lol will make again!

We really liked this.  I still haven't found a recipe that matches what my grandmother used to make, and I wish she'd written more of her old standards down, but this comes close.

I've made this twice for family dinner and it's a huge hit! Everybody loves it! I use boneless chicken breasts instead of bone in and it still turned out great! Also, instead of making 12 dumplings I made almost triple that amount, they were just a little smaller.

I decided to use bisquick instead of mixing all the other stuff,was much easier.The box said to drop dumplings in boiling stew,turn down heat and simmer 10 minutes then put lid on and simmer 10 minutes. They puffed up beautifully and cooked through in the designated time the recipe called for. Hope that helps with those that couldn't get theirs to cook through. Tasted great!

This my first attempt at making chicken n' dumplings and it was FANTASTIC! To start, I had to pour about 5 cups of water in the pot when I first started cooking the chicken breasts (I used 2) to make sure there was enough liquid to cover them. Therefore,when the recipe asks for additional water when you start to cook the dumplings, I didn't add anymore water. After 20 minutes of simmering the shredded chicken and dumplings, my pot looked like soup. I thought something was wrong so I just let it simmer for about an hour total. A lot of the water cooked down. After simmering for an hour, I turned the stove off and just let the pot sit for about another 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. In the end, the chicken and dumplings thickened up just right and was no longer soupy. Perfect!

This was the first time I ever made dumplings from scratch. What a disappointment! Due to bad weather, I got home late and did not have time to read the reviews. So, I followed the recipe as written. Huge mistake! An hour after dropping the dough into the soup, the dumplings were still raw! Cut them in half, put them back in for another 20 minutes. Still raw. In half AGAIN.

Oh my goodness, was this ever tasty! It makes a lot, so we had leftovers, which were just as good warmed up. I added some frozen peas before putting in the dumplings, and next time, I think I'll add cubes of carrot, too. This is definitely a keeper of a recipe!

This is our go - to recipe for Chicken and Dumplings. I also add chopped carrots, celery, fresh mushrooms and four cloves garlic because we like the vegetables in ours. This is the best comfort food.  We always get rave reviews when we make this for friends too.

I made this using homemade chicken stock, adding diced celery and carrots.  I didn't have time to do the dumplings so I followed one of the other reviews and did canned biscuits (large ones) cut into six wedges.  I dropped them one at a time into the simmering broth, put the lid on and cooked for 20 minutes....not done......cooked another 10 minutes, still a little soggy in the middle but the taste wasn't bad.  Next time I'll try the dumpling recipe!

I tried this recipe and it was  wonderful!  I  basically used the same recipe but adjusted the milk as needed. I also laid out floured wax paper and rolled my dough out very thin. Taking a sharp knife  I sliced into small strips and added one at a time to my broth, as the pot got fuller I used a spoon to press them down gently. I also had baked a whole chicken for dinner a couple of nights  prior and took the chicken off the bones, boiled the bones to use broth for dumplings. This tasted just like my Mom's dumplings, with a little adjusting on seasonings.

Taste is good and it's easy to make, but the dumplings (even after reading the addendum by the submitter) leave a lot to be desired. Tastes like Dinty Moore Chicken 'n dumplings out of a can.

While the dumplings from this recipe WILL rise, if you cook for 10-20 minutes, they'll absorb the broth and fall. I suggest half cooking the dumplings in the oven first to get them to rise, then dumping them in broth 5-10 mins before you want to eat.

I made this a couple nights ago. This is the best Chicken and Dumplings I've ever made! So good. The dumplings were too salty for me, so next time I will cut the salt in half, but the overall flavor was excellent.

I liked this recipe very much.  However I wanted potato added to my pot so I used a short cut and used potato filled mini pierogies for my dumpling I also added celery and some sweet peas. It was scrumptious !

Everyone loved this recipe and it was fairly easy. I used frozen chicken tenderloins because that is what I had on hand and it still turned out great. Very flavorful. The only change I would make next time is use less flour, maybe only 2 cups, because it made so many dumplings. My pot was full and I ended up throwing out some dough. 3 cups of flour was too much. I also added cornstarch to thicken it a little.

Great recipe! The few tweaks I made is: I added some chopped carrots to the fried onions and I browned the meat for a few minutes before adding the stock.  I added about half a bag of frozen peas to cook before adding the cream of chicken soup. I dropped the dumplings in by the spoonful, which about doubled the number of dumplings the recipe states, and they still took 20 minutes to cook through, so be aware. And I followed the reviewers by omitting the 2 cups water at the end. But I felt it came out too thick once the dumplings cooked through, so adjust the amount liquid to taste. I will make this again!

Even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly, it was excellent.  I do not have access to canned soups, so I use chicken bouillon and corn starch to replace it.  The dumplings turned out great rolled out and cut with cookie cutters, but  I found that the quantity of dough was just too much to put in the stew.  the extra biscuit dough was baked in the oven with goiaba jam (popular here in Brazil) sandwiched between two thin biscuits.  I'm sure caramel or other thick jams would be excellent as well.

Made this today.  ?t was great!!! I didn't have cream of chicken soup so I made a bechamel and added that to the chicken stock with some chicken bullion. I added a few carrots and celery as well.. Which my husband was not happy with! LOL Apparently in the south you don't add any veggies! Ha ha! Great recipe!
