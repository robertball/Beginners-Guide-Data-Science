Absolutely LOVED IT!!!!  I doubled the recipe.  Then added only 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar.  instead of oil I added 1 cup homemade apple sauce.  Instead of water I added apple sauce.  It turned out awesome.

I really love this bread I substituted 1 stick of butter for the oil  and poured melted butter on top and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar mixture the last ten minutes of cooking it was so good even my kids loved it. It was   like pumpkin bread but milder. Thanks  I'll be making these for gifts during Christmas!

Excellent!  I made muffins instead of bread, and my kids loved them.  I did use only 1 cup sugar, and they were plenty sweet enough.  It's so hard to find a healthy, low fat muffin or bread that tastes good- this one's a winner!

This is delicious! The changes I made were to add 1/2 teaspoon of allspice along with the cinnamon and nutmeg and used 3/4 cup each of white and brown sugar instead of all white. I used apple juice instead of water for the liquid. This is a very sweet bread, so if you don't like that you might want to try a different recipe. It is moist, fragrantly spicy and a little less heavy than a similar recipe with pumpkin would be.

AMAZING bread - 10 stars. This is so incredibly moist and tender. It's a very wet, loose batter, but no worries, it cooks up wonderfully. After the first time of making it exactly as written (which is great), I've been substiting milk for the water, and using 50/50 white and brown sugar (I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cup too). The brown sugar adds more depth of flavor.  I sometimes use a few tablespoons more of sweet potato than called for if there's a little extra in my bowl and it just adds more flavor to the bread (be sure to add a few more minutes bake time if you do this).  I also eliminate the nutmeg since it's overpowers the bread.  Cinnamon is enough spice. My two young kids inhaled this in a few hours - not knowing how good it was for them.  For healthier bakers, you can subsitute applesauce for the oil, but you will need to add about an extra 5-8 min. of baking time. Since this batter is pretty wet, I like to stick to the oil instead of applesauce.

What a great recipe! Instead of using fresh sweet potatoes, I opted for using the canned yams (you know, the "Bruce's Canned Yams). I used a half of the large can and  smashed it up. Also, instead of using water, I used the "juice" from the can for extra sweet potato flavor. This definitely cut back on the time aspect. I also decided to omit the nuts. I think I will try this with pumpkin too, or maybe 1/2 cup of sweet potato and 1/2 cup of pumpkin? Really moist and really scrumptious!

This bread came out just fantastic. A local restaurant used to sell sweet potato bread that I just loved, and this recipe is near identical to it. I modified it slightly by substituting apple juice (in place of water) and apple sauce (in place of vegetable oil). This didn't give it an overly apple flavor at all, but it kept the bread moist for a week and gave it just a subtle undertone of apple. I also added raisins, instead of pecans. It was a hit with everyone who managed to grab a slice.

I made this with canned sweet potatoes, left the nuts out, and then baked it in a Pampered Chef Mini-Muffin Pan!  I had to double the recipe because the kids kept coming!  What a great way to sneak in a veggie!

This is a great way to use up any leftover sweet potatoes that you may have.  That's what I did and my husband and children loved this bread. I'll be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic!  And easy to make even healthier.
I used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil.
I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, but with the other changes (below), next time will probably only use the 1/2 cup brown sugar.
I added 1/2 cup pineapple tidbits and used 1/3 cup of the juice instead of water. This makes it naturally sweet and you can cut back on the added sugar!
I kept the pecans - yeah, a few more calories, but nuts are good for you in moderate quantities!
(I also left out the nutmeg... I like it but felt it might be too overpowering in this recipe).

With these changes, I got 17 muffins. It took 23 minutes to cook the first dozen at 350 and 21 minutes to cook the last 5 (also at 350).

With the recipe I made, each muffin was only 132 calories (but tasted like more!). With only 1/2 cup of brown sugar, it would eliminate a further 23 calories per muffin. Awesome!

Note: You WILL need extra cooking time if you replace the oil with apple sauce, and if you add moist ingredients like pineapple.

A tip: to "lightly" grease a pan, spray a small amount of Pam on the tin, then use a paper towel to grease the muffin cups. It goes a long way with way less oil or butter than traditional greasing. Also, if you have an old muffin tray... it may just be time to invest in a new one. They're less than $10 and so worth it!

Happy Baking!
Edit: These don't rise *that* much... next time I will fill the cups and make a dozen larger muffins (obviously increase baking time!)

This was very good! Even for those who don't like sweet potatoes. I added extra nuts but I do that to everything. It is wonderful.

I made this as listed except I didn't have any nuts.  I was making some sweet potato pies and had some potato mixture left; so the potatoes had other stuff in them (nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, vanilla, eggs, butter, etc).  It came out well.  Nice, moist bread!  The next time, I used heavy whipping cream instead of water. The cream really did the trick. And instead of a greased pan, I melted 1 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp vegetable oil in the loaf pan as I preheated the oven and then poured the batter into the hot, sizzling pan. The crust was amazing!!! Because of the butter in the potatoes, the extra fat in the cream, and the oil I added to the pan, I would reduce the vegetable oil to 1/3C if using left over pie (potato filling) or if adding heavy cream.

This was really good!  I did make a few changes.  I doubled the recipe and made 2 loaves.  I used fresh sweet potatoes from the garden.  I boiled them with the skin on and then removed the skin when they were done.  I used cinnamon applesauce instead of the oil to cut down on the fat.  I also used walnuts instead of pecans, and added about 1 cup of raisins.  Really good, and a good way to use the abundance of sweet potatoes I had from the garden!

Yum yum yum!  I used half applesauce/half oil, half whole wheat flour, and sprinkled walnuts on top (easy to pick off for the no-nut-eaters).  It was delicious and gobbled up by my kids.  Best way to eat sweet potatoes that I've found yet!

This is really good. This has the right amount of sweetness and a delicate hint of spices!  Lovely!  I followed the recipe and I am very please.  The only thing I did differently is that I mixed the sweet potatoes in with the oil, sugar, and egg mixture as I believe it incorporates easier.  It's a keeper.  THX

followed other reviewer's suggestions, applesauce instead of oil, not as much sugar, half brown half white, and whole wheat flour for half of the flour. It was great!

This recipe was great! I replaced the oil with applesauce...used 3/4 cup of raw unrefined sugar in place of the 1 1/2 white sugar...a mixture of flours including spelt, buckwheat, soy, almond, and tapioca (didn't sift them)...and chocolate chips instead of nuts. Also, I made muffins instead of the whole loaf. My family ate them up and are asking for more! May try canned pumpkin next time.

A fantastic bread or muffin. When I steam the sweet potatoes I put baby carrots in too, then purée them together for this bread. I added more than called for, about a cup and a half to the mix, then added flaxseed meal ( 1/4 cup) and an extra egg to keep them fluffy. Works, even at high altitude!
We love these muffins with chocolate chips for breakfast!  Best way to sneak veggies into my picky eaters. :)

Definitely in the comfort food category.  Only thing I've ever changed with this recipe is to omit the nuts.

So easy, so good.  Apparently this would be difficult to mess up...because I certainly tried.  I forgot to alternate the water and flour mix.  Then I added way to many sweet potatoes.  Still, this recipe turned out beautifully and went fast.  Thanks for sharing Mary!

I wanted to used my leftover sweet potatoes from thanksgiving dinner and this recipe was a hit!!  Thank you!  My children don't like sweet potatoes but they gobbled up the muffins for breakfast this morning.  They were very moist and flavourful.  I added raisins instead of pecans. YUMMY!!

Made it as written (with the exception of swapping almonds for pecans and adding raisins).  This was a little on the sweet side for me.  Next time I will use less sugar

love it ! I've actually made it a few times. I roast my yams with a touch of brown sugar and cinnamon before mashing them up. I've also used cream or milk instead of water.

This was fantastic!  I followed other suggestions of reducing the sugar to 1 cup.  I substituted the oil for apple sauce and increased the spices.  Everyone loved it!!!!  Thanks!

Very tasty.  I followed the reviews and used applesauce instead of oil and apple juice instead of water.  I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon and allspice.  I also added kind of a struesel topping-1/4 c brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1T melted butter.  I sprinkled that on the top and it turned out great!

Made into muffins with a oatmeal crumb topping. I used half whole wheat & half bread flour - came out VERY tender! Needs a bit more spice!

Good stuff!  I cut the sugar back to 1 c. total and used 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown.  Mine was done in 50 minutes.  I even caught my husband (who doesn't like sweet potatoes) going back for a second slice.  Thanks!

Can I give ten stars? Made this today and cooked it in a bundt pan, then drizzled with icing and shook on some colored sprinkles. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter and left out the nuts as I didn't have any, probably would be just as good with them, but certainly this is just awesome without nuts.  I'll be making this over and over again. Hubs is usually not keen on spice-of-any-kind cakes, but this one he really liked.

waaaay better than I expected.  My sweet potato didn't mash very well and there were still chunks in the batter.  I baked it anyway and it was perfect!  no visible chunks, moist, and slightly sweet!  love this bread!

Yummers!  I used a cup and 1/2 of yams and only one cup of white sugar, but 1/2 cup of brown sugar.... so moist and yummy! p.s. there is nothing healthy about this recipe, so don't fool your self.  It's like saying chocolate covered strawberries are good for you because it has 'fruit' in it.  *sure*

I'm not too crazy about breads. Muffins are easier for me. I followed the recipe but subsituted with splenda and allspice. I poured into 12 muffin pan. My daughter loved it so much. I took the remaining 10 muffins to work and I had just sat down to my desk when someone brought back the basket. It was empty already. Coworkers obviously loved it.

These were super easy to make and tasted really good. I had no white sugar so I used 1 cup of brown sugar and I ommited the nuts because I didn't have any at home & I used muffin trays instead of bread pans- with these changes they were still so good. I will definitely make them again and next time I will add the nuts.

Was very interesting to make! I never thought about making sweet potato bread, though it caught my eye so I gave it a go. I subed some brown sugar for white and sprinkled some on top before baking. It wasn't like any other bread I've tasted before. It was good! Will probably make again when I have left over sweet potatoes.

This was so good. I followed other reviews and did half brown sugar and half white. They were just sweet enough to be a treat. I made muffins instead of a loaf and cooked for 25 min.

I really liked this bread! It's so yummy and super easy to make! The only thing I'll do differently next time is cut down on the sugar (just a bit) and the nutmeg (not a huge fan). I highly recommend baking this and seeing for yourself. I'll be baking more to give this year as holiday gifts!

I really liked this bread! We ended up with a lot of sweet potatoes and I didn't want to cook them the same way as always. I never thought to put them in bread but the bread is very moist and delicious -especially when warm. I did half white sugar and half brown though.

This was very good, though I made several changes. Just used 1 cup of brown sugar, 3/4c of white flour, 1c whole wheat flour, 1'4c ground flax seed, increased cinnamon to 1tsp, added 1/4tsp cloves, used about 1 1/2c mashed sweet potatoes (leftovers from dinner a couple nights ago), and didn't put in any nuts. It still came out sweet enough for us- as a matter of fact, my 2 1/2yr old son took a bite out of it while it was cooling on the kitchen table! I'll make it again, and probably substitute applesauce for the oil.

This was surprisingly light considering it's a potato bread.  I prefer brown sugar in my baking and I decreased the amount slightly since I was concerned it would be too sweet.  It was really good.  I made it again and took the advice of another reviewer and used orange juice instead of water and that was good, too.

Perfect when you only need one loaf of bread and don't want to be stuck with two around the house. To save time I cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave, 6 minutes a piece. You can get away with using just one sweet potato to get a cup.

I made it exactly as written the first time and it was fantastic, but 5 stars-worth when I added 1/4 tsp lemon oil and a cup of chocolate chips.  This sent my guests into ecstasy and has my hubbie asking me to make it again.  Lemon oil is not the same as lemon extract, so if you use lemon extract, use 1 Tbsp and reduce the liquid by the same amount.

Great recipe! Did like other reviewers suggested and used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I also couldn't find my nutmeg anywhere, so I used allspice instead, and did what I always do for sweet breads and used unsweetened applesauce in place of oil. Turned out great. I just made it last night, and this morning it is all gone, my kids and hubby loved it as much as I did! Thanks!

Awesome recipe!  My husband loves pumpkin bread, but it always gives him heartburn, this bread is our new pumpkin bread replacement!  It's very moist and tasty, thanks for a great recipe!

Great use of leftover sweet potatoes. I went ahead with the sugar reduction and split (1 cup total, 1/2 brown, half white) and used homemade applesauce for the oil. I also substituted chocolate chips for the pecans and they were a hit with the kids in muffins and mini loaves.

I made mini muffins.  Excellent withthe following changes:  1c white and 3/4c wheat flour instead of all white flour, 3/4 brown and 3/4c white sugar instead of all white sugar and 1/3c orange juice (I used fresh squeezed) instead of the water.  I also added about a tsp of vanilla extract, 1-2 tsp of orange zest and a little freshly grated ginger for extra flavor.  I HATE sweet potatoes, but could not stop eating these muffins.  They taste like pumpkin muffins.  You would never know they have sweet potatoes in them.   These are great!

I absolutely loved this bread! I was searching for an alternative to the banana bread I make very often and I'm sure I've found another bread I like just as much. My boyfriend said that he has co-workers who'd pay me to make it for them and even my 6 year old loved it!  First off, I've tried this recipe 3 ways: 0nce as written which was very tasty. One time using applesauce in place of the oil which was slightly 'odd' tasting and I didn't like the texture. Lastly I used 1/2 sweet potato and 1/2 mashed fresh pumpkin and it was INCREDIBLE! Next up I'm going to try a lower fat version with sour cream instead.

Delicious.  I used applesauce instead of oil and only added sugar to the sweet potatoes before baking them. It was moist, sweet and rich.

Made this today, followed recioe with only 2 minor additions, 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and about a half cup golden raisins I had on hand. It turned out excellent. I have enough to freeze (I made one medium loaf pan and 2 mini-loaves) so I will see how well it freezes. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

I added some ground cloves and used 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour and 1/2 wholemeal flour, just to give it a try. I also used craisins and slivered almonds (I'm allergic to pecans).

 Baked it at 175C for about 1 hour.  Sadly I made the mistake of misjudging the size of my pan and the bread was not done in the center! But the parts that were done were fantastic!

I'll probably play around with the amounts a bit more, but this is definitely worth a taste!

Delicious! I made a few "Natural" substitutions: I used eggs from our chickens, replaced 3/4 cup flour with acorn meal, the rest was fresh ground whole wheat flour, used garden fresh grown sweet potatoes, well water, and replaced the pecans with hickory nuts. And it was amazing!!

These are very yummy. Even my VERY picky three year old ate them. I followed the recipe except I used apple sauce instead of the oil.  I made them into muffins. It made 12 plus a mini loaf pan. It took about 30 mins for the muffins and 35 for the mini loaf at 350.  I will make this again! Anyway to get my picky eater to eat something with veggies.

Fantastic Bread!  I use 3/4 cup white sugar & 3/4 cup brown sugar.  And while you should use a toothpick to test it if it's done.  Everytime I've made this, it takes 65 minutes.

I usually avoid sweet potato/pumpkin breads because I find them to be too heavily spiced. This recipe is fabulous because the spices compliment rather than overpower the flavor of the sweet potatoes. The recipe makes a very moist bread. I chose to make muffins with the batter and enjoyed super moist muffins with just the right amount of spice. I added a cup or so of chocolate chips to the batter for a tasty twist. This recipe is now part of my permanent recipe file. Thank you so much for sharing.

We tried a yam (which is biologically similar but different from a sweet potato) for dinner tonight and no one liked it. So I used it up with this recipe. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and used dark brown sugar. It was plenty sweet. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, and subbed 1/2 cup sour cream for the 1/3 cup water. Made 12 muffins. It was ok.

Wonderful! This recipe is so moist and our family has soy and dairy allergies so I was delighted to find the recipe calls for oil instead of margarine or butter , of which I used canola oil. They are great with or without nuts. I doubled the batch and used 1/2 for a loaf and the other half for muffins. They needed to be baked for aprox. 22 minutes. Thank you for posting this delicious recipe!

**** great taste with the 1/2 tsp allspice added, but too moist in middle with 1 stick of butter in place of oil. Otherwise tasted really great.

Used 1/2 cup of apple sauce instead of oil, only 1 cup of sugar, and used 1 cup of walnuts instead of the pecans. I made them into muffins and they came out great. Baked for less then half an hour.

Just a few changes to suit my taste: 1)used half white sugar and half brown. Makes for a richer taste and the brown helps retain moistness. 2)half oil and half applesauce to reduce the fat. 3)added some vanilla. 4)used orange juice instead of water (also how I help sweeten my baked yams and apples). bake as directed and serve warmed with a little butter. It makes for a great morning meal or snack. And sweet potatoes are a good source of vitamins. Never mind the sugar :)

Scrumptious! The texture is perfectly moist. I used a stick of Imperial margarine in place of the oil & reduced the sugar to 1 cup - half white and half brown. Thanks for your recipe, Mary!

This loaf is wonderful!  It has a moist slightly dense texture like a sweet potato pound cake.  Great for fall weather!  And it is easy to make.  I will be making this again and again.

Great recipe!! The kids loved it!!  Next time will use half the sugar, though and make it brown.  This time I used half brown, half white.  I added 1/2 cup coconuts and 1/2 cup craisins. Instead of the oil, I added 1 cup applesauce.  Next time I will divide into two smaller loaves also instead of one big one.  Very moist and delicious!

Had to use up extra sweet potatoes, so we tried this recipe. Tasted exactly like pumpkin bread. Did have a bit of an overpowering baking soda? taste. But a delicious overall bread! I left out the pecans.

Very good. I took reviewers' advice and used reduced sugar to 1 cup and used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown. I also added craisins and made these in muffin form so that it's easier to freeze and take to work for a snack. Next time I'm going to add extra sweet potato.

This was wonderful!  I made it into muffins and I made it a little healthier by using only 3/4 cup of suger (and still they were plenty sweet), used fat free plain yogurt instead of oil and replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with oats!  Still very moist and wonderful flavor.  We spread with reduced fat cream cheese for a tasty breakfast!!

Great!! Soft and sweet.  I usually eat these kinds of bread with butter on it, but I didn't need any with this recipe.  My husband and son ate so much I only got a couple of slices.  I did use applesauce instead of oil, though, because I had leftover applesauce and sweet potatoes from thanksgiving.

This is so good... I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It's very moist and delicious.(It reminds me of carrot cake.)  I doubled the recipe (I left out the nuts) and got 4 small loaves out of it. I'm going to use this recipe for muffins.

I found I had run out of cinnamon when making this recipe, so I added pumpkin pie spice and a dash of vanilla (really not the equivelant of cinnamon) but  this recipe came out absolutely delicious.  My whole house smells wonderfully hours after the bread has been done. Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe using leftover sweet potato casserole from Thanksgiving.  The casserole already had pecans on the top so I just add a little more.  It came out great and really moist.  Now if I can only figure out what to make with leftover green bean casserole.

2 4 18  ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/6666/sweet-potato-bread-i/ ... This was good, but room for improvement.  I reduced sugar to 1c, increased salt to 1.2t & added 1/4t ginger.  While I'm all for sweet potato or pumpkin anything tasting like it, more spices & a bit of vanilla may be the trick.  This is a beautiful bread.  :)  Perhaps a little less oil.  Perhaps.  ;)

Excellent!  I followed as stated.  I doubled the recipe and one cup each brown sugar and white.  This made 3 small loaf pans.  Very moist and flavourful, will definitely make it again and wouldn't change a thing!

I don't understand the use of baking soda in this recipe. There is no acidic ingredient for the baking soda to react with in the recipe. I believe the baker should use baking powder and not baking soda.
Second, I use the same spices as used in pumpkin bread: cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves. Often, I simply use the commercial pumpkin spice mix to make my bread, either pumpkin or sweet potato.
Or, for one loaf of bread (9 x 5 inch loaf): I use 1 1/2 t. ground cinnamon; 1 t. ground ginger; 1/2 t. ground nutmeg; and 1/4 t. ground cloves.
I also use 2 cups of sweet potato, instead of just one cup.
I might consider increasing the salt to about 1t. , also.

I altered this recipe for a gluten free, lower glycemic and lower fat version...It was great!!  I Used 1/2 cup each of Coconut and Brown sugars, I used 1/4 Cup Oil with 1/4 Cup and 1/8 Cup Plain Greek Yogurt and I replaced the flour with a Gluten Free All Purpose Baking flour. For the water, I substituted 1/3 Cup coconut water.  I blended the everything but the flour and spices in a blender then added it to the flour mixture.  I used 2 9X3 loaf pans and reduced baking time to about 45 minutes or when toothpick inserted comes clean.

It's delicious and moist BUT waaay too sweet! Think the sweet potatoes already add a lot of natural sweetness so will definitely cut the sugar in half next time.

This was the best recipe. I did change it a little because I had no nutmeg so I used allspice and it was great. The second time I cooked it I added 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup coconut and that was great too. I also tried it using 1 cup of pumpkin instead of sweet potato and that was a hit. If you are using a loaf pan it does take a little longer than the small pans.

This is such a yummy bread, but I also cut back on the sugar.I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. Also,instead of vegetable oil, I used 1/4 cup smart balance spread. No nutmeg, used pumpkin pie spice. This is a  Nice moist bread, I will definitely be making more this coming holiday season.

This was Wonderful! I was a little worried since I didn't read the comments until after putting it in the oven that it would be too sweet due to some comments.   I'm really not a sweet lover and I thought it was great, the flavors worked very well together.  I wouldn't change Anything.  The last 15mins I did sprinkle a cinnamon sugar mixture on top and added about 1/4cup more sweet potato than it called for only because I had extra, this may have been why I did have to add an extra 10mins to the cooking time.  Just check yours with a toothpick. My daughter even said she liked this better than banana bread!

I prefer butter to oil in bread recipes, used 1 stick of Land O Lakes. I also used 1 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar (instead of 1 1/2 cups white sugar). It was plenty sweet. I like to add a rounded tsp of spices as well and added 1 tsp vanilla extract. My oh my was this light and sweet. Had enough extra for 12 mini muffins. Thank you!

Fabulous recipe! I don't normally like the typical sweet potatoes recipes but this was so different. Very sweet and moist, almost like a pumpkin bread or banana bread.

Love it! I used brown sugar (cause that is all I had) and 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour. I only used cinnamon, but did add vanilla and butter extracts. Used canned sweet potatos and used the liquid from the can for the water and ade a simple glaze for the top. This was much more a cake than bread, so moist and tender! Absolutely will be a favorite and much made! Thank you!

Really tasty. I cut back the sugar to 1 cup and even then it was just verging on too sweet, so definitely feel free to cut back on the sugar. Additionally, I only used 1 egg and then substituted the other egg with 1 tablespoon of corn starch dissolved in 1/4 of a cup water. I definitely recommend it.

My family loved it.  It was very easy to make.  I used butter instead of oil, 1/2 c each of white sugar and brown sugar, vanilla flavoring, and milk instead of water.  I made this as muffins.  I would make this again.

I wanted something different so I tried this recipe and all I can say is that it's edible, but nothing I will make again. Really just a barely sweet bread. i read that a lot of folks found it too sweet, but I didn't find it very sweet at all. Seems like it needed more spices or something.

This bread/cake tastes like Fall on a plate!  I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and substitued a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and nutmeg.

The bread came out great! But I reduced to only 1/2 cup sugar and it was sweet enough for me. I replaced pecans with sliced almonds and OMG! the whole house smell of sweet potato bread! Love it!

My three boys loved this!!  My hubby turned up his nose and said, "Eww, sweet potato bread??"  But after bugging him to just give it a try he said, "WOW!!! THAT. IS. AWESOME!!"  He then had another piece and said that he could eat that everyday.  So yep, it was a winner.  I used one cup of regular all purpose flour and 3/4 of a cup of wheat flour.  And as some of the reviewers suggested, I used brown sugar.

Oh my goodness!  This bread is so moist and delicious.  I ate 1/4 an hour after it came out the oven.  My only change was to double the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I will defintely make it again because it was so easy and good.

I made this bread on boxing day for something a bit different to go with our family Christmas supper.  It's excellent, everyone loved it and it really does freeze well.  I did however leave out the pecans as I am not a fan of nuts in my baking.

I used leftover baked sweet potatoes, half & half brown & white sugar, canola oil, added in 1/4 tsp of allspice to the other spices and substituted orange pineapple juice for the water.   I omitted the nuts, since I'm on a budget, and it was delicious without them.   Since I probably used more potatoes than the recipe called for, it looked like I had too much batter for a loaf pan, so I poured it into a large round cake pan and baked for 45 min until a toothpick inserted into the center came out clean.   My husband loved this.  The streusel and cinnamon sugar ideas sound interesting, too, I might try one of those toppings sometime.   Thanks!

I loved the flavor of this bread. Next time I will try replacing some of the oil with water or milk or add some more dry ingredients because my bread came out too gooey and wouldn't fluff/firm. But otherwise, very good.

Doubled the recipe, substituted half the oil with applesauce.  Added half cup of choc chips (for double the recipe) and didn't have pecans so had to use a nutty granola mix.  Turned out very good, very moist.  Still prefer pumpkin to this, but it was a great way to use up leftover sweet potatoes.

Subbed in 3/4 c whole wheat flour, used mashed banana instead of vegetable oil, cut the sugar to 1c and it is delicious. I think I'll make it to share with the neighbors for the holidays. Thanks!

Excellent sweet potato bread! Good texture and flavor. I tend to like things with more spices, though, so I added cardamom and ginger in addition to the cinnamon and nutmeg.

Excellent! Very moist, and it has a great crumb. The taste is very similar to banana bread. The second time I made this I added a little more cinnamon. (I love cinnamon.) My husband loves the crust on this bread.

I love this recipe,and kept all ingredients as specified except when I first made the bread I omitted the pecans. But I'm sure I'll make this again using the pecans.

I just love this bread.  It is super moist and does remind me of pumpkin bread.  I anticipated baking this and baked two medium sweet potatoes for it. A cup of mashed sweet potatoes required just one of my pre-baked potatoes.

Nice recipe, I reduced the sugar a bit, still sweet enough for my taste. I will use more sweet potatoes next time as I could barely make out the sweet potato flavor. Does anyone know if you are supposed to refrigerate the loaf? Some of the sweet potato pieces in one loaf started to look green the next day.

This is a very good recipe. I used orange juice as opposed to water, and used both butter and oil together. I added walnuts and used a large can of pre-cooked yams. Yummy! Thank you for such a great recipe... will go put it in my box now.  :)

Very yummy!! I made these a "lighter" version than the recipes also I was out of regular white sugar!  I substituted Splenda Blend for the sugar, whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour and unsweetened applesauce for the vegetable oil. I also used a container of pre cooked and mashed sweet potato found near the fresh-ready to cook potatoes.  These came out delicious and moist and not overly sweet at all! I made a double batch and pured some into a loaf pan and the rest onto a muffin tin with muffin liners.  Because there is no oil n this batter, they stuck to the papers after cooking, so I probablywill either spray the liners next time or just use the loaf pan.  These were awesome! thanks for the recipe Mary!

This was so yummy! A couple of changes I made: I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 white sugar and substituted walnuts for the pecans. Next time I will put batter into two pans so that it will bake faster. Thanks so much for this recipe.

Very tasty.  I'll definitely be making this again to use any leftover sweet potatoes.  :-)  I had to modify it a bit because I didn't have oil.  I used 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco, and it still came out perfectly.

We really liked this moist, tasty bread.  I did follow the recommendation to use half white, half brown sugar.  It took the full hour to cook and I would suggest flouring the pan after greasing.  I will definitely make this again next time we have "leftover" sweet potatoes.

This bread is soooo good! I did not have time to cook and mash the sweet potatos so I just shredded about 1 1/4 cup and threw them in at the end with some walnuts (did not have pecans). Baked it in a bundt pan for an hour, dusted it with some powdered sugar. Came out delicious!!

Excellent recipe. The bread was moist and delicious. I did not use as much white sugar as the recipe called for. Instead, I used 3/4 cup white and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I also substitutes walnuts for the pecans and it was fantastic.

Doubled the recipe.  Some changes were: 2 cups white and 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup of applesauce, 4 eggs, whole wheat flour, 2 tsp baking soda, salt, 2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp vanilla, a little less than 1 tsp nutmeg, water, and 2 1/2 cups of organic yams.  Family loved it.  Ended up with 3 large loaves and all devoured within 2 days between 3 adults.  Will make often.

Awesome bread!  It's actually exactly the same as my pumpkin bread recipe except for the amount of salt and of course using sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin.  It is moist and delicious and a great way to use up leftover sweet potatoes.

Fabulous! I doubled the recipe & altered it. For the sugar: 1 cup of brown sugar & 1 cup of white sugar. For the oil: 1 cup of apple sauce. I then put half of it in a loaf pan and the rest in pan that is for 9 mini loaves. The large loaf cooked for an hour and 15mins. The mini-loaves ONLY cooked for 35mins. Make sure to watch them in your oven! :)

I've been skimming through sweet potato dessert recipes and I've noticed something in the reviews. Some say a recipe is entirely too sweet, others say just fine, and yet others say its not sweet enough. At first I thought well that's opinions for you. But after making the batter for this bread and cutting the sugar in half, its still very sweet. I can't imagine how sweet it would've been if I used all the sugar! That being said, I think it takes experience when working with vegetables that can have a varying degree of sweetness (or any variance for that matter). I used the same potatoes for potato wedges and found them entirely too sweet. So beware! Take into consideration your specific potato. Other than that, its a good recipe. Also, if you want whole grain goodness but not the harsh taste and texture, use whole grain pastry flour or whole grain white flour. They are more delicate versions of the normal wheat grain but all the nutrition.

Reduced the sugar and skipped the pecans.  Exactly what I was hoping for.  Tastes like pumpkin bread.  Why does the sweet potato turn green after a few hours?  Not very appealing to take to a bible study, but I did.

Per other reviewers' suggestions, I reduced the sugar some (and used half brown) and used applesauce instead of oil. I also added 1/2 t. allspice. A winner! It makes great muffins by the way.

It was very easy and fast to put together. I used baby food sweet potatoes instead of cooking and mashing. I took my first one out of the pan before it was cool enough - it made the load break in half. Always let it cook.

Replaced with some whole wheat flour. Added mashed sweet potato skin and all. Could go easy on the sugar, it's a very sweet sweet potato bread.

This is fantastic bread! Very moist, great texture and easy to make. The only thing I did differently is that I mixed all the wet ingredients together, and then incorporated all the dry ingredients into it, much easier. It was perfect!

This bread is very good. I reduced the sugar to 1c. (1/2 brown and 1/2 white) and I found the sweetness to be perfect at that amount. I doubled the cinnamon, but kept the nutmeg the same, plus added 1/4 tsp of ginger and cloves. I subbed coconut oil for veg oil, and didn't add pecans as we're not a fan of them in quick bread. Baked about 1 1/4 hr. Perfect crumb and texture!

This sweet potato bread is divine! It's incredibly moist and has just the right sweetness! A staple for summer.  I substituted applesauce + a little bit of melted smart balance for the oil... perfect!

A fantastic recipe!  I've made this numerous times, and it seems to disappear very quickly.  I followed one of the previous reviewers suggestions and changed the sugar to half brown/half white.  However, I also would suggest decreasing the nutmeg down to just 1/8 teaspoon (or just leave it out entirely).

This was a wonderful bread, very moist and flavorful. I kept the recipe the same and actually made one Sweet Potato and one loaf a combination of Sweet Potato and Pumpkin. It was delicious and both loaves were gone in one day. My husband, kids and I ate it up as soon as they came out of the oven. Some whipped butter on top and my tummy was smiling.

Yah, so this recipe is pretty much awesome!  I did sub Splenda for the sugar, and instead of nuts I used Craisins. I also subbed half of the flour with whole wheat. I just threw 2 small sweet potatoes into the microwave, peeled and mashed them-super easy!  I made them in muffin tins and the kids gobbled them up!  Great taste, tender and moist!  Definately will make again! Thanks for the recipe!

I had a lot of sweet potato casserole left over from Thanksgiving so I thought, why not use it to make sweet potato bread? lol  I threw the leftover (homemade) cranberry sauce in, too! This is one  'experiment' that really worked! Changes were: sweet potato casserole instead of plain sweet potatoes, so I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and nutmeg, and I used the liquid from the cranberry sauce plus water to make 1/3 cup. Baked for about an hour and ten minutes. Delicious! Thank you, Mary!

I had 2 cups of sweet potatoes leftover from Thanksgiving, so I doubled the recipe with a few of the changes I read about in other reviews.  I used apple juice instead of water, apple sauce instead of oil, 2c sugar  50/50 white &brown and finally a 50/50 mix of whole wheat and regular flour.  I left out the nutmeg.  I made them as muffins not bread.  Jumbo muffins took 32min, regular muffins took 20min.  They were a winner with my family.

Delicious!  Try it like it reads!  This time I substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce and put in coconut milk.  Smells delicious.  I should have put allspice in it also but forgot!  Very sweet.

The bread came out really well! I made a few substitutions. I used honey instead of sugar, walnuts instead of pecans, whole wheat flour instead of white flour. I used olive oil as my oil of choice. I also mistakenly added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Ooopps!! The bread tasted delicious and was very moist. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I love pumpkin seeds, which were in the photo but not the recipe. I added seeds to the sweet potato and spices mix. Also garnished the loaf with them. And halved the sugar. Yum!

Made it for my family for Thanksgiving 2018. Everyone loved it, I had a piece and it was DELICIOUS! My sister gobbled up her piece and immediately asked for anther, even though she is a finicky eater. I would definitely recommend it! My only advice would be to double the recipe.

I omitted the nuts, though.

I used gluten-free flour, 1 cup of sugar (half white, half brown,) a tiny pinch of clove and butter instead of oil.  And 1 whole cup of chopped walnuts.  I used two 8 inch round cake pans since the volume was too much with the extra nuts.   Shortened the cooking time by 5 minutes.  Made a white icing glaze for the top.  They looked like thick, giant  cookies, which I cut as you would a pie. Very cute. I shared one with neighbors and it was a great success.

Doubled the recipe, used less sugar (1c white, 1c brown for doubled recipe) and was out of nutmeg so subbed cardamom. This was so moist, so light and so fluffy. Rose beautifully with a crisp crust. Will definitely make again.

I’ve made this recipe about a year ago and I made some changes in the sugar and spices same as I did today. I doubled the recipe, added more white sugar(1/2c more) and added brown sugar(1/2c), cardamum, nutmeg, lemon and vanilla extract. I also cooked them in mini loaf pans so it cut the cooking time down to 35 minutes.

I LOVE how simple yet so versatile this recipe is!  I used avocado oil and used 1 cup Barley flour and 3/4 cup Paleo flour mix from Bob's. I also used 1 cup of coconut sugar and since I added raising too, it was the perfect sweetness.  it turned out excellent!

Excellent recipe!  Followed the suggestion of several reviewers and decreased the sugar to 1c and used brown instead. I also subbed coconut oil for the veggie and added vanilla extract.  I threw in a dash of allspice and used coconut milk based egg nog in place of the water. Omg, what an amazing flavor these muffins had! Next time I think I'd like to add some shredded coconut and try coconut sugar as well. This is a great base recipe and I can't wait to experiment some more!

I really liked this recipe! I only had one egg and it turned out fine without the other egg. I used one cup of brown sugar and no other sugar. I also used olive oil for the oil and was worried about the taste, but it came out fine.

This is a great recipe as written. I only made one change, using half white and half dark brown sugar. The bread is moist and tender, like a pumpkin bread but less dense. Used a tsp. of apple pie spice and it came out deliciously spiced. Baked for 70 minutes in a convection oven.

We loved it! i made slight changes: 1/2 cup of shredded apples and 1 table spoon of melted butter instead of oil, only 1/2 cup of brown sugar (we don't like sweet cakes) and made 6 muffins, baked for 30 minutes. They turned perfect!

The only changes I made was 1 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup white sugar and I used butter instead of oil. Both of the changes were just because that was what I had at home. I had to cook mine for 10 extra minutes because it wasn’t fully done after 1 hour. Really really good recipe! Not super sweet but a perfect dessert with a cup of coffee or cold milk. I will definitely make this again and again!

It came out PERFECT! 
I changed it up, just slightly. I used a softened stick of butter instead of oil. I mixed both white and brown sugar for a better flavor. Half white and half light brown initially, and I play with the ratios everytime I make it. I used a tinge less nutmeg than the recipe, based on what some reviewers have said.

I also peel, cube, and boil my potatoes. Once they are as soft as I want, I mash them slightly. I also use more than what the recipe calls for, just a bit. I feel the water and extra potato help add moisture.

I used butter to oil the inside of my pan.

Amazing....
I had some extras sweet potatoes in my pantry  that were just about past their prime, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I've never baked sweet potato bread before.  I'm so glad I did.
It turned out really great and was tremendously moist.  I added some dried cranberries which added an extra layer of flavor and texture.
I knew I had a winner when my super picky  eater who only eats "beige" colored foods, asked for another sliver.
This will certainly be added to my repertoire.

Great recipe! I used walnuts instead, and added some chopped dates.  I also added a little bit of powdered clove for oomph. I've made this about 3 times now,  making a double batch each time so that I can freeze a loaf for later,  and they *do freeze well.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. It was tasty but I decided to make it a second time, taking into account other reviews. I subbed milk for water, upped the cinnamon and eliminate the nutmeg and went with half granulated white sugar and half brown sugar. My family of four inhaled the entire loaf before lunch time! Next time I plan to add golden raisins and pecans. This is definitely going in my favorite files.

I made a lot of revisions to this - I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar; instead of the oil I used 1/2 cup vanilla Greek yogurt and 1/2 cup applesauce; 1 used 1 1/2 cups white and 1 3/4 cups wheat flour; and replaced the water with applesauce.  I also made cupcakes (baked 30-35 min) instead of the bread.

turned out awesome!  I wanted to do a bread with my leftover sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving.  My son thought it was the coolest thing that I turned the leftover sweet potatoes into bread.  He said it was his favorite.  I adjusted the sugar and spice since the potatoes already had sugar and spices.  My potatoes had raisins and I also added some nuts.I wouldn't make sweet potatoes just for this but a great way to use leftovers.

We grew sweet potatoes in our garden, and have a bounty of huge ones! I’ve been looking for recipes to use sweet potatoes..and this sweet potato bread is delicious and moist! I doubled the recipe...followed it properly. My husband said he could eat the whole loaf! Next time I’d like to try using some brown sugar, and maybe add a few raisins. I needed to bake the loaves closer to 70 -75 minutes, as I used 3 of the disposable large aluminum baking pans for the doubled recipe. I’d like to do muffins next time around. I wonder how dark chocolate chips would taste in there?

Loved it! Super moist and tasty. I would definitely cut the sugar by a lot next time. Maybe use only 1 cup or a bit less since the sweet potato is already so sweet.

It was pretty simple. I doubled it and used one cup of sugar, some maple syrup, and half a cup of whole wheat flour. Also substituted shredded coconut for the nuts. I used walnut oil for the cooking oil. Probably would taste better with nuts instead. ;-)

My family is dealing with difficult times right now but that's no reason to cook. :)  The local panty I visit gives us these huge sweet potatoes (SP).  My family doesn't like SP, lol  so I searched for several recipes.  This one was such a hit with my family I've given out the recipe 4 times now along with muffins I've  baked.  I'm also giving this recipe to the panty so others can enjoy it as well.  I subbed 1 tsp of pie spice for 1/2 tsp of nutmeg/cinnamon, as well as 2/3 cup oil for a more cakish texture. This one is a winner. 
(if making muffins they only need 30 minutes (we use a toaster oven))

I created a SP and raisin garnish to Dress the muffins.

1. 2 small SP, thinly sliced or julienned 
2. A box of raisins
3. Gentle squeeze of lemon juice (maybe a tsp.)
4. 1/4 cp gently packed brown sugar
5. 1/4 cp white sugar.
6. 1/4 cp water
7.  1 tbs unsalted butter.
8. 1 tsp of vanilla and almond extract.

Bring butter and water to a boil. Stir in sugar until desolved, first brown the white. Tutn syrup down st a simmer.  add SP. Cover.  singer for about 5 minutes or until Sweet Potatoes are tender.  pour in raisins. simmer until raisins are plump.

My bread did not have a distinct sweet potato taste. And I had white sweet potatoes available which after baking, turned green! we kept thinking it had gone bad. it just looked soft and moldy. the taste was fine and it was soft and moist.... see coupled with moldy, it just sounds wrong!

LOVED this recipe. I altered it after I made it the first time, by adding allspice, in addition to the other spices listed on the recipe. This comes out super juicy and is delicious. I will continue making it and adapt my carrot bread recipe to this one as well. I like that you use oil instead of butter, and that is something I loved about this recipe.

This bread was amazing, but I cut the sugar down because it was too sweet the first time I made it. Other then that my family and friends loved it and I will be making this bread again.

I also doubled recipe to get two, 9x5 loafs and OMG is it good! I love sweet potatoes anyway but this bread is just amazing; moist, lots of flavor, the pecans add more flavor & texture....i could just go on & on about this recipe! Didn't change anything and it turned out phenomenal. Definitely going in my recipe box :)

I used purple sweet potatoes and beets, less sugar ( 1/2 c of white, 1/2 cup brown).   Coconut oil and about 1/3 c less flour.  It comes out purple.  Loved it.

A constant crowd pleaser and I frequently have people ask for the recipe. I halve the total amount of sugar (half white, half brown). I also add 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp allspice in addition to the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I frequently use half butter and half oil. Instead of nuts, I add raisins, and I sprinkle sunflower seeds on top right before it goes into the oven, which is great for presentation and adds a nice crunch. 5 stars!

I made a couple of changes to the recipe.   I used coconut oil and added vanilla and black walnut extract.  The only thing about this recipe is it doesn't tell you how long to keep it in. It says about an hour and I should have left it in for about 10 more minutes for a total of an hour 15 minutes.

I just made it. It was ok. Mine had chunks of potato in it even though I did mash it with a banana masher. I also used purple potato so maybe that's why it had chunks. But at least you could say it's unique because it came out purple.

I had leftover mashed sweet potatoes after making sweet potato pie...   so I set out in search of something to do with them.  This recipe is so easy, and so good!!  Like other reviewers, I did half white and half brown sugar...  my family raved about it, and I was asked if I'd make more!!  I think this will be a new Christmas tradition!!

This recipe is going into regular rotation! I had Thanksgiving leftovers that no one was gonna eat - roasted sweet potatoes and butternut squash, mashed with butter and brown sugar and a little salt. So I subbed that for the plain sweet potatoes, reduced the sugar and oil a bit to compensate, and it turned out really well! My son, who would not touch the mashed potatoes, ate about half a loaf in one church coffee hour.

Very good! Like others, I used 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar. I didn't have flour so I used Biscuick mix in place of dry ingredients.  I also omitted nutmeg and just used 1 tsp cinnamon.  Was done baking in 45 minutes. Yum!!

I had two baked sweet potatoes from last nights dinner.  I took the skin off and mashed them up.  I added some vanilla .   Didn't have nuts on hand.   I would absolutely make again.  Everyone loved it.  I may even try with other fruits like banana.

This bread turned out  great! I even had to substitute yogurt for eggs at the last second, and it still came out brilliantly. I added some freshly grated ginger, just because I love ginger and I thought it would go well with the other spices.

I used my leftover Sweet potato pie filling that I made from baking sweet potatoes. I added 1/4 tsp allspice and used evaporated milk in place of  water. Also, like other reviewers, i used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. I baked it in a 9 by 8 inch pan. It came out moist and delicious! I would definitely make again!

Loved it.  Great way to use one of my huge sweet potatoes from the garden.  I did half brown half white sugar.  Added a bit more cinnamon. It took my loaf another 15 minutes to bake than the directions.

I used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/4 oil, and applesauce in place of the water. I also added chopped walnuts, 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, and decreased the nutmeg to 1/8 teaspoon. Delicious. It's so sweet you can easily decrease the sugars to a total of 3/4 cup and it would be fine.  I baked it 70 minutes and it came out moist and well risen.

Great bread.  We raise our own sweet potatoes, so this is a good way to use up some of the smaller potatoes. Also don't cook with nuts so I added dried apples. Very good

I had leftover sweet potatoes so I decided to make this bread.  It was very moist and good.  Not the best bread I have had, but good.

I made a few changes by using apple sauce instead of oil, I replaced the water with milk, in addition I used chopped walnuts, not pecans. I thought the bread was delicious, I used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a 1/2 of white sugar and I still thought the bread was a bit too sweet. Next time I will use just a half cup of brown sugar.

Great recipe! I used coconut oil and substituted a quarter cup of honey for sugar. Next time, I'll reduce the sugar by a half cup. The vegetables are so sweet, it's just not necessary! I also used multigrain flour. I will definitely make this again!

I've made this a number of times, and love it just as much each time. Half-loaves have made good presents to give to relatives and neighbours as thanks. I'm going to now be experimenting with gluten-free flour, because I've gone gluten-free, and don't want to have to give up such a yummy treat! (When I have results, which might not be until summer, I'll put up another review with details.)

Two things I did: I didn't add the nuts (I saw no point, and some of the people I made it for don't care for pecans), and I found that I had to cook it for 1-1/2 hours rather than the 1 hour mentioned in the recipe. This might be a difference in ovens, but at least one that I used two or three times was new two years ago. *shrugs* Other than that, each time it turned out quite well.

I'm only rating the recipe ease not so much the taste. I normally cook for therapeutic purposes - so I may not even taste the bread. But that sugar was too much to begin to add. So, I add a 1/4 of honey and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I mixed mine in the food processor instead of stand mixer and by hand. I hope whomever I give it to enjoys.

This bread is magnificent. I read the review and used applesauce instead of oil, apple juice instead of water . I sprinkled the top with a little white and brown sugar that made a nice topping. I toasted the nuts prior to adding them to release the oils and bring out the great taste. The bread has a wonderful flavor and is so very moist.  I will also provide my tip of freezing fresh sweet potatoes. Bake them on a cookie sheet at 350 degrees till done. Completely cool and place the potatoes (still in the skins) in a freezer bag. They are ready when you need them.

Delicious! I made a ton of amendments, including swapping applesauce for some of the oil, omitting the nutmeg, adding cardamom & cloves, etc. But the basics of the recipe served well, and I'll definitely make this again. Edited to add: made again, but via the original recipe - and it was WAY too heavy and oily. I will go back to the applesauce and possibly add baking powder as well.

I have used this as my base recipe for other types of bread, e.g. sweet potato , zucchini , blueberry. You can add or take some ingredients such as only using half a cup of sugar, adding chopped walnuts instead of pecans . I will try lemon cake next .

So easy to make even if didn't mess this up. I did make some adjustments. I added a pinch of baking soda. I also made it with a cup of sugar and next time will probably make it with about 3/4 of a cup sugar because it was too sweet. The nutmeg amount that it called for made it feel like thanksgiving in my mouth.

I love this recipe so much. I'm not a fan of nuts in baked goods so I opted out of that and I don't have nutmeg on hand so I just added a little extra cinnamon. This bread is delicious right out of the oven, chilled in the fridge, or even toasted with some elderberry jam. I'm actually in the middle of making it for my third time! Everyone who's tried it has asked for the recipe or asked me to bring some over.

This is my new favorite bread! The only things I changed from the original recipe is I used walnuts instead of pecans, and I didn't use white sugar; instead, 1 cup packed brown sugar. This will be a hit for Thanksgiving!

I made this once as stated in recipe...good but missing something.  This time I did, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, organic butter stick, 1 tsp vanilla and orange juice instead of water.  Delicious!  It's sweet, but not too sweet.

Love it!!! Easy to make and taste great. Just follow the instructions to the dot. The only thing I changed is that I used half regular cooking oil and half coconut oil. I also took it out after 45 min of baking, because it started to smell like burn and turning out too dark. It was little bit too moist in the middle and the dark skin didn't taste burned and it was soft, so next time I will be baking this baby for full hour :)) Will make it again for sure!

This recipe is soooo moist and sooooo good! I did use unsweetened almond milk instead of water. Although I used the same amount of sugar as the recipe called for, next time I would probably decrease it by 1/2 cup. It was a bit sweet. Not too sweet, but to be a bit more health conscious I would use less sugar. Other than that, I was very pleased with this!!

This was my second time baking a bread.  It turned out perfect.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I used butter instead of oil.  I cooked it at 300 but that was to adjust to my oven which is off.  It turned out moist, looked amazing, taste sweet and slightly seasoned.  I like it with tea.  The next time I will add vanilla.  Oh I almost forgot I swopped out 1/3 of the white cane sugar for light brown sugar.

I make this often.  Everyone who tries it loves it!  I use half white, half brown sugar.  I use applesauce in place of oil.  I omit the pecans.  I use the sweet potatoes that are yellow on the inside (not orange, not yams).  GREAT RECIPE!!

This was an awesome recipe. I substituted parts of the flour with a combination of chia, oatmeal, and flaxseed; and parts of the white sugar for brown coconut sugar. And all the oil with applesauce instead.

Great recipe. Moist, flavorful, easy to make.  Mixed up a sweet cream cheese spread to spread on slices for a breakfast treat.  Will bake this in small loaves for Christmas gifts along with a small container of the spread.  Love it.  This is a recipe I'll bake again and again.

Modified for GF.  Used half brown sugar, subbed coconut oil, added 3/4 tsp xanthan gum as recommended on the GF flour package, and used almond milk instead of water. Result was moist, light, beautiful, fragrant, and... Only ok. I love sweet potatoes so I had my fingers crossed. Maybe when it fully cools I'll love it more.

Made this for a work project & they loved it. I used 1/2 cup brown/white sugar & applesauce for the oil. Used about 1 1/2 cups of fresh mashed sweet potato & 1/2 cup milk, instead of water. I cooked the sweet potato the night before and kept in the fridge overnight. Some of the reviews said it was a runny batter.  Mine was thick, maybe due the cold potato? It definately needed a longer cooking time 60-70 minutes, I checked it often.  I loved the pecans in it. Everyone else thought raisins would be great.  It is a very dense heavy bread. I made 2 loaves & the 2nd loaf was not eaten right away.  3 days later we ate the other loaf & it was just as moist & delicious as the first one.

My family loved this. Super moist. We call it "instead pumpkin bread." Great way to use up all those sweet potatoes at the end of the season.

Followed recipe for the most part, but used leftover sweet potatoes from dinner. They were mixed with butter and brown sugar. There for I only used 1 1/4 of white sugar. Didn't have any pecans. For a quick bread it was delish. Even the cable guy enjoyed some :)

I doubled this recipe because I had a bunch of sweet potatoes that I needed to use.  As other reviewers suggested, I used half brown & white sugar, only cinnamon, and 1/2 of the oil and substituted the rest with applesauce, and added walnuts to the top.  It turned out great.  My ends got over cooked...but I just cut those off!!! Will make again!

Delish! I did everything the recipe called for except I substituted 1/2 the oil for Greek honey yogurt. Mixed butter and brown sugar and put it on top the last 10 minutes. Great recipe!

I enjoyed making this reciepe at a whim.  The only change I made was macadamia nuts simply because I did not have pecans at the house and 1 cup sugar. Next time I will try the reviewer suggestions of yogurt or applesauce, pineapple bits... I will add vanilla and maybe some coconut flakes.  I will add 1/2 cup more of sweet potatoes as well. Lovely bread!

Pretty good.  Lightly spiced and similar to banana bread.  Subbing some of the sugar with brown sugar does improve the flavor.  If you use Splenda for the sugar and are making muffins with paper cups, spray the paper cup with cooking spray before adding the batter.  This will help with any sticking issues (I loose a bit to the paper if I don't).  I used the walnuts I had on hand.  Fill the tins mostly full with batter for a full muffin size.  Bake for 45 minutes.  Makes 6 big muffins.

This was a great recipe! I used less sugar, about 1 cup and used walnuts instead of pecans. I also made muffins instead of bread. Tasted sooo good with a little melted on it. My toddlers who do are on a veggie strike loved them. :)

It was good only because I only used 1 cup of sugar, sweet potatoes are already sweet enough. I used a golden sweet potato instead of yams. substituted the water with milk. Pureed the milk and potatoes together first. I used cupcakes instead and only baked for 30 minutes. added chocolate chips and oats on top.

This was really good.  The only thing I changed was I used leftover sweet potato casserole in place of just mashed sweet potatoes.  I had to cook it an extra 20 minutes.

I loved this recipe! I decided to double it because 1 loaf just didn't seem enough for me. Considering how yummy it is, maybe I should've kept it at 1 loaf. I baked my sweet potatoes and squeezed them out of the skin while they were still warm which kind of allows you to skip the mashing plus it retains the nutrients better. I did make a few changes to the recipe: I used 1 stick of butter instead of oil, 1 1/4 cups sugar, added 1/8 tsp ginger, and used milk instead of the water. I also left out the nuts because I didn't have any on hand. It was delicious!

I used 2 parts butter and 1 part melted coconut oil for the vegetable oil, used milk kefir instead of water (buttermilk would work too), used about 1 part of coconut flour for every 4 parts of wheat flour, substituted sucanat for white sugar, used a little mashed winter squash mixed in with the sweet potatoes, and tossed in a generous handful of chocolate chips at the end. This recipe freezes really well, so I like to triple it so I can tuck a couple of loaves into the freezer for later -- of course, I have to do it quickly and hide it in the back of the freezer before my family gobbles it all up! Next time, I might try using ground ginger instead of nutmeg. Thanks for this fabulous recipe!

Absolutely yummy.  Didn't add the nuts as my family don't like them but it was wonderful.

Was just ok.. Not a bad flavor.. But not much of one either. I cut down on sugar to about 1 cup I think anymore would not have helped. Usually a fan all the well rated recipes but this one just didn't hit the mark..

Very good and easy to make with items most people have on hand. I mashed up a small can of yams, then added a small handful of both white chocolate chips and cinnamon chips, and 1/2 teaspoon of ginger into the batter, then sprinkled some raw sugar on top and it was delicious! I mixed up butter and honey and served that alongside.

Other than adding 1 cup of pecans, rather than 1/2 cup, I made this by the recipe. My husband LOVES it! And he is not normally a sweet potato fan. I haven't tried freezing it- it is gone in 1 day!

I did 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar as recommended and used half pecans and half walnuts. DO NOT DOUBLE THE LIQUID. It looked like it would be much much too watery if I used 2/3 C. liquid (I used a juice blend). Came out yummy as cooked.

This cake was a winner.  It was so moist and light, my parents loved it.  I made a few changes: I used one cup of brown sugar and a table spoon of black strap molasses for a richer hue.

First time making Sweet Potato Bread,  we loved it.  I used peach nectar instead of water and walnuts instead of pecans.  Served it warm with some cinnamon butter.  Would be great to make for holiday gifts.  Thanks for sharing, Mary E. Crain.

This bread is awesome. I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup white and 1/8 cup brown. I substituted pumpkin butter for oil like other reviewers suggested. For the flour, I used 3/4 cup wheat, 3/4 cup white and 1/4 cup oat. I baked this in square silicone baking cups and it came out cute, like little mini loaves. I thought this would be too similar to pumpkin bread, but it's different enough to stand out.

I've made this recipe twice now and have gotten nothing but rave reviews.  However, I did alter it slightly: I subbed unsweetened applesauce for the the oil, added 1/4tsp allspice and used freshly grated nutmeg, which makes a big difference in flavor.  I love the exotic flavors these spices give, so with the alterations, I would give the recipe a 5-star rating.

Great Recipe! I made some changes which are NOT a mark against the original recipe, just personal preference. Used all unsweetened homemade applesauce instead of oil. Used 1/2 cup white sugar, total. Increased cinnamon times 2. Added 1/2 cup Oats plus 1/2 cup (shredded) Coconut.

This is the best.  I took out all the "white" and subbed whole wheat flour, brown sugar, and applesauce.  It was delicious and I gave it out to my fellow yogis and they all want the recipe now.  Thank you!

I had some huge, not terribly tasty sweet potatoes just waiting to be used, so I tried this recipe. Man oh man, is it good! I didn't use nutmeg, because I didn't have any, and I added raisins. Also I did the half brown sugar, half white sugar that people suggested. So moist! So tasty! I'm going to have to make more this weekend.

This is a keeper, I took the previous suggestions and reduced the sugar to one cup using a combination of white and brown, substituted the oil with applesauce and added some raisins for the nuts. The second time I made it I added some ground ginger to perk it up a bit.

I loved this bread. I had leftover sweet potato from Thanksgiving that I wanted to use and came across this recipe. Decreased sugar to 1c and was just the right amount of sweetness.  I added 1/2 c craisins and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I left out the nuts because DH is not a fan. This reminded me of a cross between pumpkin bread/carrot cake. Will definitely make again.

I did some of the suggestions and did half white sugar, half brown.  I used all whole wheat.  I used applesauce instead of oil.  I omitted to pecans cause I put them on top. Than I added a struesel topping of 4tb flour, 4tb brown sugar,6tb butter, 1cup chopped pecans (I used a bag of already sugared ones, yum!).  I topped the bread when it had 10mins to go. It is to die for!

very yummy! I used 1/2 of a large can of sweet potatoes and 1/3 c. of the syrup in the can in place of the water.  It was a little heavy on the nutmeg for my tastes. I'll cut it back to 1/4 tsp next time. But if you love strong spice cake type flavors, you'll love it as it is written. Also, mine stuck to the bottom of the pan and fell apart a bit when removing it even through it was well greased. Perhaps letting it cool longer in the pan would have helped? This would be great for a chilly autumn day. :)

This is awesome!!1 I made a double batch (24 muffins and a small loaf).  It will not last long.  I only used 2 cups of sugar and I used the water from the canned sweet potatoes in place of the water.  It will definitely make this for the holidays.

Oh, yum!! This is a fabulous recipe!  My husband, who hates anything to do with sweet potatoes, even had to admit this was good.   The only changes I made were as follows: (1) Use orange juice instead of water. (2) Add 1/2 cup dark raisins to the batter.  (3) Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  This recipe's a definite keeper!!

Very tasty and moist!  I modified this to make it a bit healthier and lower in calories.  I used agave instead of sugar (ratio of .5 to 1, but could maybe use even less as it was sweet enough), I used whole wheat flour, and I exchanged the vegetable oil with 1/2 canola oil and 1/2 unsweetened applesauce.  My sweet potato was also a little chunky (not completely smooth) after mashing, but it came out great!  Would definitely make again.

This is just excellent!  Noone in my family likes sweet potatoes (except for me).  But they all loved this bread.

I did cut the sugar to 1 cup in the second batch, just to save some calories.  Couldn't even tell the difference.  Wonderful!

My husband who is a picky eater and isn't a fan of sweet potato likes the sweet potato bread. Now that's saying something! Although I would have to say, it is very similar to the pumpkin bread.

This recipe deserves more than 5 stars!  It is so simple to make, and yet tastes better than any bread you could buy in a bakery.  I too used half white, half brown sugar as well as half oil, half applesauce.  Also, apple juice instead of the water.  Even my husband (who does NOT like sweet potatoes) LOVED IT!!!

I am struggling with my children eating vegetables so I was looking for a way to "sneak" them in.  This is a delicious, great way!  The only change I made was to substitute applesauce for the vegetable oil.

this is so awesome! I did use butter plus evaporated milk instead of water.  Perfect bread that I will make once a week (just to keep me in my low eating habit :))

Wonderful recipe. The modifications I made were using butter instead of the vegetable oil and using half brown sugar/half white sugar as suggested by another reviewer. The bread texture was exactly what I wanted.

Very moist. I just added 1 cup of brown sugar, one can of yams, and then used the syrup from the can instead of water. I also veganized the loaf, substituting Ener-G in place of eggs. Next time I'll up the cinnamon too.

Excellent! I cut back just a tad on the spices and was wonderful.  My 2 year old son loves this bread.
