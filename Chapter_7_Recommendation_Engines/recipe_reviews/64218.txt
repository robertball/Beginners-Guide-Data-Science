I thought I had a lot more bananas than I had, but it turned out, I only had 1.  So I used one banana plus 1/2c. pumpkin.  I didn't have plain yogurt, so I used peach yogurt.  And on top of that, I thought I had orange peel, and I didn't, I only had lemon peel!  and lastly I didn't want to waste eggs, so I used whole eggs, not only the whites.  So lesson 1 is check the pantry first!  I guess they are more of a Banana-pumpkin-peach-lemon oat muffin now....but even with all of these modifications, these muffins were delicious!!!

These are very tasty, wholesome muffins!  It was rainy out this morning and wanted some home-baked warmth for breakfast, and these were perfect!  I love oatmeal recipes, and this one is going to be added to my collection.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain, and I think it added a subtle yet tasty flavor.  The hint of orange works well with the muffins.  Will make again!

These muffins smell fantastic while baking!  I substituted oat bran for the flour and used vanilla yogurt instead.  The texture of the muffins is just perfect for those who are addicted to carbs with their morning coffee (plus it's a healthy alternative to pastries or donuts!!!).  I will definitely make these again!

This recipe made a very "pretty" muffin. I had to change a few ingredients to fit what I had on hand. I am only rating this one 4 stars as I felt it needed a bit more flavor. I used half wheat flour and half regular flour.  I dislike dates so I substituted snipped apricots. I had nonfat banana yogurt, but it was only 6oz. I used more mashed banana to compensate. My orange peel was dried and I let it sit in the wet mixture awhile. I wish I would have had fresh. It might have made all the difference. If I use this same combination of ingredients, I will use more orange, a bit more salt, and maybe orange flavor yogurt. This is nice one and I will keep it due to the health benefits and the way it presents!

I completely followed the recipe with only one exception - I added 1 tsp vanilla to the fluids.   Delicious!

These are so healthy, moist and delicious. I used 2% yogurt for extra richness. They're easy to prepare too!

This was very good. I doubled the sugar as my bananas were not really ripe, and left out the orange peel and raisins, as I didn't think my kids would like them as much. They had a very nice texture and my kids gobbled them up.

Hearty muffin and relatively low fat! Bonus that it is also yummy!  I used 6 oz lemon yogurt, as thats what I had in the house and a tad more orange zest, had a very nice citricy flavor without being overwhelmingly so.
