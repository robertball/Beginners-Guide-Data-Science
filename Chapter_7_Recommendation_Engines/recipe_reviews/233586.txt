SOOOO GOOD! I thought that I had a can of red enchilada sauce in the pantry, but when I went to get it, I discovered that it was green, and decided to go w/ it...the results were wonderful! After topping the enchiladas w/ cheese I added some chopped green onion for some extra color and flavor. The filling was delicious, and these were a huge hit at dinner tonight. I will def be making these agian~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were excellent!  I purchased rotisserie chicken at Costco.  They have the best!  Used light ranch & authentic Mexican cheese.  It's called Chihuahua cheese.  Perfect for quesadillas too.  I followed recipe exactly except I used both corn & flour tortillas.  Remember, to spray casserole dish with Pam & warm tortillas in microwave for a few seconds.  The tortillas won't break & are easier to roll. My family enjoyed them.  Looking forward to left overs for lunch.  I can't wait to make again.

Pretty good!  I made a double batch and the sauce was pretty thin.  It didn't thicken up.  If I make a double batch again, I would put it in two separate baking dishes, make it more spicy, and add more chiles.

This recipe turned out great - just what I was looking for! I used a can of red enchilada sauce in the bottom of the baking pan and poured a can of green chile sauce over the top of the enchiladas since that's what I had on hand and they were delicious.

I made this to use up the chicken from a leftover roasted chicken.  I didn't have high expectations, because I new this was a quick weekday meal, as described.  Even after my husband and I had mixed up all the ingredients in the bowl, we thought, "well at least it'll fill up our bellies." I am pleasantly surprised to say how well this turned out.  It didn't taste close to what our "taste test" was before it was put together and baked.  My family loved this and I'll be making this monthly.  It was very satisfying.  I'd put this up there with Mac n' Cheese comfort food.  ** I added 10 minutes to the baking time.

Very good and very easy.  My only complaint, isn't there something out there that tastes better than enchilada sauce?!!

This was fantastic! Instead of using diced green chili's, I had green chili enchilada sauce and it worked great.  Also, I didn't have rotisserie chicken, but some chicken breast, which I boiled in salt water.

I have made this recipe several times so it's safe to say I like it! I do usually cook my own chicken, but it would obviously save time to use rotisserie chicken. The recipe doesn't specify which enchilada sauce to use. I have always used the green because it seems to mesh with the green chile flavor best. One time I only had red enchilada sauce and did not care for how they turned out.

Good and so easy to make — the rotisserie chicken saves a ton of time.  I used the smaller tortillas and this fed 4 adults with plenty leftover.

Quick, easy, tasty! What's not to love!  I added some cumin (1/2 t.) to the mixture because I used mild green chilis.  Greek yogurt is an almost all-the-time sub for sour cream at this house.  I made half with green enchilada sauce as suggested, and half with a homemade tomato-based salsa.  Both were hits.

A squeeze of lime on top would make this a 5-star recipe! It needs a citrus punch.

This dish is soooooooo good! I am lactose intolerant but can eat yogurt, so I changed this recipe by using trader joes "yogurt cheese jalapeño flavor" and bolt house farms ranch made with Greek yogurt. I used a Costco rotisserie chicken and it was amazing!

This may not be quite a fair review, as I am the one that cooks but my husband is the one that eats meat (I'm a vegetarian) so I have to take his word for it on recipes! :) I have tried three other enchilada recipes from allrecipes, all of which had a white cream based sauce instead of the red canned enchilada sauce. Hes said this was a nice change; different. He said he really liked them, and could taste the ranch but it wasn't too much and seemed to go really well with the enchilada sauce. He went back for seconds so I know he really did like it, and it was very easy to make. I just boiled cubed chicken breasts with adobo seasoning for these.
