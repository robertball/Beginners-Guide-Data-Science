Very nice glaze - to make it a bit thicker a give it some shine I added a teaspoon of lite corn syrup.  It was perfect over "Buttermilk Cinnamon Bread" from this site.

Super glaze!!!  You can make it thin or thick.  Thick glaze will melt all around the cake.  Thinner melts too but faster and a little runnier.  All good!

This was very easy to make. I added more vanilla extract ( about 1 tsp more) and a little more milk til it was just the right consistency.

it was okay. WAY too much powdered sugar. I added extra vanilla, some melted chocolate and raspberry extract and it was delicious though!

This glaze, I think, is best suited for doughnuts or a sweet dinner roll maybe. I used this on a bundt cake- but the cake absorbed it and I couldn't SEE it on it. However, this is a simple and good glaze and I think it's worth making again :)

It's okay recipe. A little salt and a little butter is a surprising and simple improvement. About 1 teas. of butter is what I use, but that's preference.

I modified this bc I accidently made bread and forgot the vanilla extract it called for.  I halved the sugar and more than doubled the vanilla; worked fine.  Sweet yet added vanilla to my bread.  It would have been too sweet for me with all the sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was exactly what I needed to top some fruit turnovers. It was a bit thick so I had to add a smidge more milk to make it drizzling consistency. I scaled this down to half and had more than enough.

Very, very tasty but took some modification to get it right.  There was too much powdered sugar and it came out mealy so I kept adding milk until I got the creamy consistency I needed.  I will make this again, with extra milk of course.  I used it on pumpkin cake, delicious!  Thank you!

I really can't believe this came from an actual magazine or book because it's not really a recipe it's just frosting without the butter. I thought it was WAY too sugary. but other than that it was easy to make!

I made some cranberry walnut cookies that turned out to be not sweet enough, so I used this recipe to glaze them. All I had was vanilla almond milk on hand so I used that in place of regular milk and I used 2 tbsp of it and followed the rest of the recipe. It was the PERFECT touch to complete my cookies.

I made this glaze and drizzled it on top of "Jewish Apple Cake" from this site. I used soy milk instead of the milk to keep it parve/non-dairy. It was ok - the glaze did not maintain a stiff shape as i intended. Instead it melted into the cake. I guess it will need some margarine or butter added to it to maintain the shape.
