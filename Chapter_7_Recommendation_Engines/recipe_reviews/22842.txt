I did not like this pie.  I followed the recipe exactly and I took out the pie after 60 minutes of baking as per the recipe.  It was terribly overdone.  The pecans were so hard I could barely chew them and the raisins did not blend with the other flavors.  I checked my usual pecan pie recipe and the recommended baking time is only 50 minutes.  I can't imagine how awful this pie would have come out if it were to be baked for 90 minutes.  The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because my husband said that it was "all right".  But then he doesn't mind burnt stuff.  Will definately never make this again.

I took this pie to a graduation party.  There was none left about halfway through the night.  The only changes I made were these:  I soaked my raisins in bourbon (because they were kind of old) and drained them before adding them to the pie.  I used mostly light corn syrup and a little molasses, because that's what I had on hand.  And I only cooked this for 50 minutes -- that's all it needed.
