This is amazing - so unique and tasty! The hubby gave it 5 stars. My comments - watch the Caribbean seasoning. I thought it was too hot, but my husband loved it. Also, fresh pineapple is a must! I used canned, and it was still good, but I could tell that using fresh pineapple would really make the dish. And you MUST use the mint in the salsa! Finally, we sauteed the salsa for 1-2 minutes before serving. This made it nice and warm when it was spooned over the fish. Perfect!

Sorry, but we did not enjoy this one at all.  We made it exactly as stated, and used all fresh ingredients, but we did not feel that the flavors complimented one another.

YUMMY!!  Made as written.  Husband and I both enjoyed this. The salsa could be used on any fish and I found it quite addicting... I made extra and took it for lunch by itself.

This was tried while we were in the Smokies last week. Another couple came to spend the day and we all thought it was a wonderful taste combination.I used swordfish and dropped the mint. I love all the recipes I have tried so far from this website.

Excellent recipe!  I was short on time and happened to have a jar of prepared pineapple salsa on hand -- it was still a homerun!  Can't wait to make the salsa per the recipe.

The pineapple salsa amazing!  I didn't think I'd like it, but I couldn't stop eating it.  It's great with tortilla chips, and of course on the fish.

I cooked this yesterday on the grill for the 4th and everyone loved it!  I purchased a Caribbean Jerk Marinade though made the Salsa from scratch with fresh pineapple.  Two people who do not eat Tuna loved it! I also  used the recipe for swordfish steak which was delish as well.  Everyone loved a little Something Different!

Great salsa on the hot side.  I marinated the fish longer than an hour, but still feel it could be more flavorful.

The marinade was fantastic but leave the mint out of the salsa.
