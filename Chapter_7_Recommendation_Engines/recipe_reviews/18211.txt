This was great. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I used one cup of pumpkin puree. I added 1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut--a great addition that my family liked. One Tbsp. of pumpkin pie spice is equivalent to: 1-1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 3/4 tsp. ginger, 3/8 tsp. cloves and 3/8 tsp. nutmeg. Thank you, Linda!!

I've been making this same recipe for years.  I always use fresh cranberries (which I keep in the freezer and add directly to the batter) and substitute applesauce for half-to-all of the oil.  It still comes out moist, just a little less heavy.  I love this bread!!!

I had to bake this bread two different times -- my first loaf had a thick, doughy texture (probably because I only baked it for 60 minutes).  My second time, I still used one 9x5 in. pan and baked it for 1 hr. and a half, and it came out perfect. I also added 2 tsps. of vanilla extract and an extra egg. For the 2 c. sugar, I used 1 c. white and 1 light brown. The taste is excellent! If you use only one 9x5 pan, you might have to cover the top with foil to prevent overbrowning.

I just loved this bread! I did use fresh cranberries, which I rough-chopped in the food processor, and I did add a little more spice (cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves.) Also, I added 1/4 cup applesauce. The recipe yielded 2 (8x4) loaves, and 2 mini loaves. I just delivered my 2 larger loaves to the neighbors for a Thanksgiving treat! My husband and I treated ourselves to a mini-loaf, first...and it was wonderful!

LOVE this bread. I used freesh pumpkin from our fall pumpkins. SOOOO good. The one thing I would say is you would want to sift the  dry ingrediants or be sure to mix it up really well  so there are no lumps of flour. I found that with the first batch the lumps of flour never blended into the bread while it cooked and I ended up with a few dry lumps of flour in the baked bread. I like to bake extra and slice it up to freeze individual pieces to be taken out when ever I just want a nibble to enjoy with a cup of coffee.

I've never cooked with cranberries before and was skeptical about making this, but it turned out wonderful.  It's moist, not too sweet, a perfect bread with coffee or tea.  I used 2 cups of fresh cranberries and baked it for 55 minutes.  Everyone loved it.

This was a really good base recipe. When I first used it I was pretty inexperienced in pumpkin bread, but have since made dozens of loaves and learned a lot! First, I much, MUCH prefer to use fresh pumpkin puree than canned. You just cannot get the same fresh flavor from a can and, really, it's not that much more work. I highly recommend using fresh/frozen cranberries which have been roughly chopped for a really nice, tart bite of flavor in every mouthful. For most loaves I either reduce or omit the oil and add instead either apple sauce, sour cream, plain yogurt or a combo of two of those things. We like spicy bread so we add quite a bit more pumpkin pie spice and a bit more cinnamon as well. I replace half the white sugar with brown. If you change ONLY one thing, use fresh/frozen cranberries! So yummy!

This bread was very good; moist and not too sweet. I used fresh, rather than dried cranberries because that's what I had. Next time I'll use more cranberries. I'll bet using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar would make this recipe even better.

This pumpkin bread was good, but not the best. I've made tastier loaves. I think I prefer fresh cranberries over the dried ones used in this recipe.

This is a moist cakey bread, but it isn't too sweet!  It was a hit at Thanksgiving.  I cooked for the full hour and it turned out perfect!  I also sprinkled the dried cranberries on top and they turned out crunchy...that didn't turn out so well.  I would just fold the entire bag of "craisins" into the batter!

I have made this recipe twice and I really liked it the second time, after I made some changes.  The first time I used whole-frozen cranberries and the berries exploded making little pools of sauce in the bread.  I liked it, but the cranberries weren’t spread out enough in the bread.  The second time I cut the frozen berried in ½ and that was better.  Instead of two pans, (I like taller bread), I used one 9.25x5.25 inch loaf pan and cooked it at the recommended temperature for about 70 minutes.  I started checking it at 60 minutes.  Once I took it out of the oven, I left the bread in the pan and put it on a cooling rack for about 15 minutes.  Then I removed it from the pan and let it almost completely cool before I cut it.  I will make this bread again and again!  Happy eating!

Revision: after a day in the refrigerator, this gets 5 stars! I stand by the vanilla assertion though.
******
Very tasty but just a little bit bland for me. I think I'll add a tsp vanilla and a little more cinnamon next time I make it. I used whole fresh cranberries, and while it came out just fine, I think next time I'll coarsely chop them, perhaps in half, to avoid a big tart mouthful. :) This makes a great breakfast bread.

My family has enjoyed this recipe for years, but we use fresh cranberries. While it may be a tad more work, to keep them from making the bread too tart, we cut them in half or quarter them. It's the BEST!

I made this for a faculty prayer breakfast. Definitely good - love the 'twang' of the dried cranberries - I just prefer a stronger pumpkin flavor, so I would likely do 1.5 tablespoons going forward. I add vanilla to all my breads, so I did that here...I have a problem with my breads being underbaked, no matter what kind of loaf pan I use - regular, disposable foil, PChef...I will often cover the bread so the top doesn't over brown, but I usually end up with a hard crust, undercooked middle. Inspired me to bake this in a 9x13 dish and it cooked MUCH more evenly throughout - took ~ 45 minutes, and it sliced into perfect bite-sized pieces for the group I made it for!

Delicious!!  I used a few suggestions from some of the other reviewers:

-used half the amount of sugar (a little over 1 cup)
-used fresh cranberries (cut in half)
-replaced 1/2 the oil (1/4 cup) with applesauce
-used pecans instead of walnut
-baked in muffin tins for 25 min (made 20 muffins)

They came out just right -- moist, with a good balance of sweetness and tanginess (from the cranberries), and they were a hit in the office today! :)

This is by far one of the best things I have EVER baked. 
Its extremely easy, and the aroma will take over your home in the best way. 
I will soon be baking this for a little raffle I'll be doing at my baby shower. :)

What a great recipe!  I made a 9x5 loaf and 6 mini loaves. I probably could have put more batter in the 9x5 pan and only made 4 mini loaves along with it, but live and learn. The 9x5 took about 40 minutes and the mini loaves took about 22 minutes.  This smelled delicious, so I couldn't even wait for it to cool before I cut into one of the mini loaves to try it.  Will definitely make again!

The FLAVOR was GREAT, but the texture was very, very dense and moist, almost like fruit cake.  I was looking for a more cake-y, bread-y recipe.  I substituted fresh cranberries and used a blend of ground cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger in place of pumpkin pie spice.

This is a staple recipe for me for Fall and Winter. Last year I gave it as a gift to neighbors with homemade pumpkin butter. Incredibly delicious! Am making again this year. I add extra cranberries.

I made muffins instead of bread. And I used half light brown sugar and replaced the walnuts with pecans. But really, I love this recipe! It's moist and not too sweet, and really tasty.

I actually changed this recipe to make it healthy.  I substituted one cup of flour with whole-wheat flour and the rest I used organic brown rice flour.  I subbed applesauce for the oil, and splenda for the sugar, real pumpkin for half of the pumpkin, and fresh cranberries.  It came out super delicious for a healthy bread!!

I made this without the walnuts. It was really tasty, but didn't expand as much as I thought it would. I might add a bit more baking powder next time so it's a little less dense.

Fabulous recipe! I used 1c whole wheat flour, 1c all purpose flour, 1/4c wheat germ and fresh cranberries for a healthier version. I also baked them in a muffin tin for 20 - 22 minutes. They were the best muffing I've eaten.

This bread was excellent. I loved the tang of the cranberries. I modified it to cut down on the calories(to ease my guilt over slathering it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II!) I subbed whole wheat flour for white, splenda for the sugar, and unsweetened applesauce for the oil. I will definitely be making this again.

A very moist and tasty bread.  I substitute 2/3 cup natural style applesauce for the eggs and oil.  Still comes out great.

I made this bread for Thanksgiving, it was really good! I used 3 loaf pans instead of 2, just because I didn't want any issues with the loaves being too large and the middle being gooey.  Definitely will make again next year!

Update 11/26/12:  This year I made one batch of the regular pump cran bread and then I made another batch and added shredded coconut and walnuts, in addition to the cranberries (fresh chopped cranberries, not dried).  It was surprisingly delicious!  The loaves are a little on the sticky side, so definitely make sure you spray your pans well before baking to prevent the bottoms of the loaves sticking to the pan.  Also, it is much easier if you use the disposable aluminum pans.

Very yummy and easy to make. My 4 year old daughter helped and had a blast. I like that it made 2 loaves, as we were able to give one to our neighbors, but it would also be good for freezing. I think it would make a good gift for neighbors/friends at Thanksgiving or Christmas.

Very moist bread, I did make a couple changes though.  Instead of using canned pumpkin I baked my own and used that instead.  Also, instead of whole cranberries I used cranberry sauce based on one of the recipes on here.  It was delicious and makes a lot of servings.

This is excellent - I didn't have any vegetable oil, so used about 2/3 cup of melted butter and had to increase the baking time to about 75-80 minutes because it's so dense - I highly recommend this recipe!

This bread is really good.  After making it once, I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups for the next batch, didn't add cranberries, substituted pecans, used a flax meal egg substitute, and it still tastes delicious.

I always have dried cranberries on hand so when I was looking for a pumpkin bread recipe this one caught my eye.  I wasn't disappointed.  This makes a very dense, flavorful loaf.  As this recipe yields less batter than many others, I believe I will use smaller pans (8-1/2" X 4") the next time. I like a nice tall loaf! I would be really careful substituting applesauce for oil in this recipe. For a tea bread, it really is fairly low fat to begin with.

I love this recipe!!! I made muffins for Thanksgiving and my family has been requesting them ever since. I made them for my daughters teachers and they were a hit. The only slight change I made was use 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown. I also use fresh cranberries. They are tart but, so good!
I used the reynolds star cupcake tins and cooked them for 25 minutes or until the start to split at the top. Excellent!!!

This bread tastes good but the texture is so-so.  The first time I made it, it seemed a bit thick and heavy but everyone enjoyed the flavor.  The next time, I replaced the oil with applesauce and it was a fiasco.  The bread did not cook through even after 90 minutes in the oven.  I finally took it out because the top was burnt, but the middle was still extremely doughy.  If I ever made this again I would definitely use oil instead of applesauce.

I have made this recipe for the past few years, every fall, and it's always a hit! The only changes I make are that I use fresh cranberries (a texture thing, I don't like the feel of the dried) and I make my own blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger in lieu of the pumpkin pie spice mix. It's wonderful!

I have made this more times than I can count since I found this recipe. It is truly the best pumpkin bread recipe out there. The cranberries add so much flavor! I have substituted applesauce for the eggs, which worked fine and helped make it a little healthier too. Also, I think you can safely cut down on the sugar a bit without impacting the taste too much, if you are concerned about the sugar content. Using Craisins will keep the bread sweet enough.

Everything sounded great about this recipe except for the amount of sugar.  I used half the amount called for and it was plenty sweet for me.  I also used white whole wheat for half of the flour.  It turned out very tender and moist.  Great flavor.

really yummy moist bread (or should i say cake). I added 2 cups of frozen cranberries and 1 cup white 1 cup brown sugar. For anyone who can't buy pumpkin pie spice (i'd never heard of it) i used 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and a pinch of all spice which turned out great. I'll definately make it again!!

Just perfect in all ways!  Moist and delicious.  I used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" which made a perfect topping for this  Pumpkin Cranberry bread that I made yesterday.  Took one loaf to the office today -- raves reviews!!  This is a keeper for sure.

This recipe is fantastic!  I made some modifications though...Used half whole wheat flour and half white, only used a 1/2 cup of sugar ( lots of natural sugar in the pumpkin and dried cranberries), and used only 1/4 cup of oil and replaced the other 1/4 cup with yogurt.  Oh, and these are good with raisins if you don't have cranberries.  Thanks for sharing this delicous recipe with us!

i'm a 23 year old male college student with no cooking experience, and this was very easy to make.  the recipe said to bake for 50-60 minutes, but i found it took almost 90 minutes.  I also used a mixture of dried cranberries and fresh cranberries for a little extra flavor.

I made this to use up leftover pumpkin puree from Thanksgiving.  It got rave reviews.  I did use fresh cranberries because I had those leftover too.  It was an amazing loaf and I am about to make it again.  Hubby said it was the best loaf I ever made.

This is extremely dense and heavy. To me it was flavorless and almost too sweet.  I think it should have had more cinnamon and more oil.  It took about 50 minutes to bake.

This bread did not rise at all!  I tried it twice following this recipe and ended up with pumpkin bars! The first batch was super dense and the second was not much better.  I think the flavors came out nice, but it was too dense to even eat much.

Great recipe – used half oat flour half all-purpose flour, powdered stevia extract added to flours, brown sugar, cut in half (1 c), coconut oil, and used 3 cups of cranberries. LOVE IT – then the stores are carrying pumpkin bread mix starting around Thankgiving– I simply added cranberries to the mix, easier faster, but certainly not the nutrition control making from scratch.

If I could give it 4.5 I would. I followed the recipe as is and it was very good. The only reason I gave it less than a 5 was because I really wish I hadn't separated it into two loaf pans. One would have been better. It still came out really good but the loaves are short.

I brought this to work & everyone loved it. I used pecans & fresh cranberries. Also, my own homemade pumpkin pie spice. It's even better the next day. The fresh cranberries made it so moist, but tart. I think I'll try a powdered sugar glaze on it. Thanks!

Lacking pumpkin pie spice I used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp each of ginger, allspice, and nutmeg-- a good ratio.  I used dried cranberries as the recipe stated and I think that they work quite nicely.  It didn't rise much, next time I might use a narrower pan to get a higher loaf.  It might be nice with additional nuts and perhaps pumpkin seeds sprinkled on top.  Make sure you smooth the top before baking, rather than leave strange globs on top like I did-- they don't melt out into the batter as I expected.  Overall I would say that this is a pleasant-tasting quickbread and I will make it again, although I may experiement with ways to reduce the sugar.

Excellent. Just the right combination of flavors. Like others, I used fresh cranberries instead of dried, and doubled the amount (one whole cup per loaf). The berries softened and burst while baking, keeping the bread moist but not overly so. I also used a combination of black walnut and hickory nuts, which worked very nicely. Some notes:  This was just a bit sweet for my taste, so I'll use 1/5 less sugar next time. Watch your cook time (mine was done in less than 45 minutes). Make extra--this appeals on both the plate and the palate.

The bread itself is good, but I don't like it with the dried cranberries. It'd be better with fresh cranberries. Or, I should have softened them in warm water first.

I made this tonight- and I am an expert baker as well as have a husband who is a retired MASTER CHEF...we have VERY high standards...I used a stone-wear pampered chef 4 mini loaf pan and baked on 350 for 50 minutes using convection oven... also substituted raw turbinado sugar for the white sugar (same amount) and instead of pumpkin pie spice I used cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and allspice-and instead of cranberries I used 2 cups of Dried pitted tart montmorency cherries and chopped pecans in lieu of walnuts-lastly I sprinkled turbinado sugar on the tops of the batter of each loaf before baking...my husband who is NOT a huge eater- devoured an entire mini loaf before they were removed from the pans to the cooling racks- that says IT ALL... this is a great base recipe and I will be using it over and over again- with dried cranberries and other ingredients- will also be gifting mini loaves of this FOR SURE!

So the first time I made this I was so excited since the idea of the cranberries, spices and pumpkin smelled and sounded so good BUT it was a total flop!  I subed the dried crans for fresh, since I had some I wanted to use up and upped the sugar a little and decreased the liquid...I got a mushy bread.  I didn't give up and tried it again, following the recipe and got a perfect loaf that was WONDERFUL.  This is a keeper!

My husband and I really liked this bread especially when it was still warm. I substituted all of the oil with applesauce and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. For anyone interested, the whole recipe with substitutions was 79 points, divide that by how many slices you cut.

I'm not exactly how I'd rate this bread with the cranberries, but if you substitute chocolate chips for the cranberries, it is absolutely delightful. Pumpkin and chocolate is an amazing flavor combination. Also, you can substitute applesauce for the oil and cut down on the fat, but it stays extremely moist. YUMMY!

These might be the most perfect muffins I've ever made--consistency and taste wise--but I made several adjustments.  I halfed the recipe.  I used half whole wheat flour to supplement the reg. white flour.  I used sweet potato puree instead of pumpkin, and substituted half brown sugar and Agave (natural liquid sweetener comparable to honey).   And I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I used a little less oil and a little more of the puree.  And I made muffins instead of bread--baked for exactly 25 mins, they were perfect.  Made 9 muffins.

This is a winner!  Perfect balance of ingredients. I use 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 pecans just because I do so in many recipes for personal taste.  Otherwise, recipe is wonderful as is.

Great recipe and smells dee-lish while baking!  I baked entire mixture in a bundt pan. I made some small adjustments ~ instead of 2 cups white sugar, I used 1 cup dark brown and 1 cup white. Gives it a lovely dark color. We like lots of fruit, so I also added a cup of raisins along w/cranberries and nuts.

I made 2 loafs for Christmas gifts for my family. They loved it! I copied the recipe down for them. Several family members said they are going to bake this Pumpkin Cranberry Bread. It is delicious and easy to make.

We made this a few times now, Absolutely love it. Not very sweet, but the flavors are incredible. Do not use dried cranberries, substituted fresh. Great for breakfast, dessert, or a satisfying snack.

This was a very good recipe. I didn't catch the part where this recipe requires 2 9 x 5 loaf pans. The first time I made this it didn't cook correctly. The second time, I used a single 9 x 5 loaf pan and had to bake it for 75 minutes.  The next time I make this, I will follow the directions and use 2 9 x 5 loaf pans.

This is a good recipe to use if you have too much pumpkin pie filling left over from baking a pumpkin pie.

We love this recipe at our house and make it for holidays. We have an egg allergy at our house so we use powered egg replacer instead of eggs. We also use fresh, chopped, cranberries and sometimes chocolate chips.

I really wanted to love this; I love pumpkin bread in all variations. I followed the recipe exactly. The loaves didn't rise at all, which, to fair, may have been due to baking powder past its prime. That aside, the bread itself was just blah. Not nearly enough flavor. I think it needs more spices and possibly a dash of vanilla extract. I think it may be better toasted, so I'll try that, but I won't be making this again unless I change it substantially.

Made this many times, and everyone always loves it! Original recipe works well. I prefer to substitute one of the cups of white sugar with brown sugar, and a 12oz bag of fresh cranberries instead of dry. I often add some cinnamon because we love the extra flavor. I don't add walnuts, or any other nuts, because of allergies. My oven needs 1 hour 10 minutes to bake the loaves with a toothpick coming out clean.

Followed as written. Added a few more cranberries, cut the sugar just a bit. Turned out moist and great ??taste. Will use less nuts as hubby doesn't like a lot of them. Also used pecans as we have a lot of them in Texas. Everyone loved it. Will make again.

I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of maple syrup instead of 2 cups  of sugar.  It probably would have been better with more sugar, but I was trying to make it a bit healthier.

I made this recipe, but substituted dried cranberries for fresh unsweetened.  It gave it a nice tart flavor when it was done.
Note:   ( only use 1/2 the required amount of cranberries).

I used fresh cranberries & cut the sugar some. My sister stopped by & I gave her 1/2 of a loaf. She called me later & wanted the recipe!  It was moist & delicious. I used premixed pumpkin pie spice.

Excellent. The cranberries go perfectly with the pumpkin flavor. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Will mostly definitely make again. May even make some as holiday gifts.

Came out nice and moist, and everyone at Bible study loved it.  Walnuts have never been my favorite, so I used pecans instead.  I might add a teeny tiny bit of orange flavoring next time, but I'm definitely going to make it again.

First try was a little dry.  Modifying whole fresh cranberries made the difference.  I also prefer the sweeter and slightly moister pecans rather than walnuts.

Love this recipe, but I slightly altered the recipe.  Instead of 1 tablespoon of pumpkin spice, I added 2 tablespoons and instead of 2 cups of white sugar, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  I didn't have 2 bread loaf pans (only one 9 in.), so the extra batter I added to a small cake pan, spread it evenly and cooked it for 1/2 the time (while the reg. bread pan was still in the oven). Also, I didn't have nuts and I used fresh cranberries and it came out delicious! I would make it again!

You can make this lighter by replacing the oil with buttermilk, omitting the nuts, and using stevia for half the sugar.  Also, I always make this with about half a bag fresh cranberries instead of dried.  You can buy fresh cranberries during the holiday season and keep them in the freezer to have later in the year.

With some adjustments these are awesome! I used half brown sugar, half whole wheat flour, and used 2 cups of frozen fresh cranberries, and 2 tsp of vanilla. I also omitted the nuts, as a familial preference.

Excellent, moist. I substituted organic whole wheat flour, grape seed oil, added raisins and chopped pumpkin seeds, plus the cranberries and walnuts. All ingredients were organic.

It wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't bad, either. The bread was definitely moist and had a nice presentation, but it just lacked something in the way of flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, but the end product was still missing something. Since I've been craving a good cranberry pumpkin bread, I may just toss in a cup of fresh cranberries and use the Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread from this site, which has proven time & again to be absolutely divine. This was a decent recipe, but not a keeper for me.

I reviewed this a few months ago, but the review has disappeared so I'm working off of memory here.  I love pumpkin and I love cranberry, but for some reason I did not like these flavors together.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the bread came out with a nice texture.  I just really did not like the flavor.  I'm surprised and not sure how to fix it.

Holy Smokes! Addictive. Halved the recipe and also subbed 1/2 whole wheat flour, and added 1/2 tsp soda to help give it a bit of lift. Used the dried cranberries and I don't have a problem at all with the end result. Baked it in 8" square pan (couldn't find my loaf pan - how do these things happen?) and it turned out just fine - baked approx. 35 minutes. Five stars and two enthusiastic thumbs up!

My family LOVES this recipe! I always have to double it because everything is eaten within a couple of days! I cut the sugar in half and use frozen cranberries, but you really can't taste the difference. Most of the time, I will add frozen blueberries in addition to cranberries (~ 1-2 cups). This just adds to the moistness and flavor of the bread. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I've had better. I did try half applesauce half oil which others warned against so the rubberlike texture was my fault. I also used half the sugar which I would not reccomend especially if you use fresh wild cranberries. So overall not so great, I would try a different recipe next time, one that I can substitute some of the oil since that is my preference.

I am not a baker, but this one turned out! It was moist and not too sweet. I read the other reviews and decided to make one loaf in a 9X5 pan and cook it for 1 hour and 30 minutes. It turned out to be just right. I did add the foil over the top after about 1 hour. I also switched the cranberries out for raisins so it would be less seasonal and did 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. It worked so well I would make it again and again!

Delicious!!!! Very moist and satisfying. The mellow pumpkin flavor was a perfect complement to the tart cranberries. I ommitted the nuts and doubled the cranberries ( I used fresh) for 4 mini loaves. Great recipe!

This is DELICIOUS! I will be making this for Thanksgiving and for Christmas presents.  I cut back on the oil without substituting applesauce (only because I didn't have any) and it still turned out fine.  I used whole cranberries that were previously frozen and after an hour there was still a little batter goop near the berries so I microwaved each loaf for a couple minutes to help cook the goops. I definately recommend making this in double batches as you most likely have a loaf eaten before the oven even has time to cool.

This bread had a wonderful texture, no where near a fruit cake texture that was mentioned before.  I did add pecans like other cooks have, and I used dried cranberries, but I boiled them first in water so they were back to a soft texture.  I made mini loaves, and gave 2 away, and kept two.  The kids loved it, as did the people that recieved the ones I gave away.  Very good recipe - perfect for fall.

Excellent bread, I doubled the recipe and baked it in 12, 1 pint wide mouth straight side canning jars at 325* for about 45 min. Fill the jars 1/2 full, set right on the rack in oven and put the lids on as soon as you remove from oven. They'll "seal" and then you can wrap the jars with decorative fabric or whatever. Stays fresh for 5-7 days, or you can freeze it right in the jar. Fun gift. I also added about 1 cup of plain yogurt (doubled recipe) and about 1 cup of quick oats, and split the nuts between walnuts and pecans.

These come out with a great color. I haven't tried yet but the texture of the batter looks like it could be baked free formed as scones.

Awesome. Very moist, just the right amount of cranberries and pumpkin and nuts; for me, anyway. And it looks pretty just as it is. Would make a nice gift.

A wonderful recipe! I used almonds as the nuts and followed everything else and it was perfect! I am sending my husband to work in the morning with several mini loaves for all the guys; hopefully they enjoy it as much as we did.

Great recipe! May need to bake longer than stated, I recommend the toothpick test to avoid a raw center. I made mine with orange flavored dried cranberries and an orange flavor icing drizzle on top. Excellent gifts!

Sorry, but I was not thrilled with the results.  The bread has a great flavor, but I found myself picking out the dried cranberries.  Next time I'll just leave them out.

I have been making this recipe for several years now. It is one that I make at Christmas as give aways.
Everyone loves it and I am asked to be sure to make it.
I have modified it by using applesauce instead of oil and omit the nuts in case anyone has alergies. No one misses them.

I followed this recipe with few changes- fresh cranberries, more spices and half brown sugar for white.  Like another reviewer what I got was a big disappointment.  Okay flavor but the texture is way off.  The loaves rose very little (my baking powder is fairly recent, so that wasn't it). So the end result is unpalatable. I also only needed 40 minutes the oven.  Thank God I didn't sub whole wheat flour or I'd have doorstops.

Very moist and flavorful. Went great with Thanksgiving dinner. We made one bigger loaf and 2 smaller ones. They turned out well.

Awesome flavor. I cut the sugar in half though and it came out wonderfully. Also, it only took me about 40 minutes to bake (wowza!) so make sure you keep an eye on it!

This may be a bit too much for some, but I added mini chocolate chips to the batter as well and it was delicious...a treat that's spicy, tangy and sweet.

Excellent recipe!!  Moist, tasty, everything you'd want a holiday treat to taste like!  I had to substitute butter for the oil because I was out.  Still was fabulous!  (However, better warm than cold because of the butter.  Would most likely be better with oil.

Excellent bread!  Very moist.  I made this for a Christmas Eve dessert and everyone raved about it.  It was even better toasted and buttered the next day.   Thanks Linda.

I made this for a group of people, and everyone loved it - it disappeared fast!  The cranberries add a nice tangy contrast to the sweet pumpkin flavor.  Very nice for the holidays!
