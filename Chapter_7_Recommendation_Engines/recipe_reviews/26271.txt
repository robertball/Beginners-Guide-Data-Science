I give this 5 stars for it's simplicity and for being a quick meal. It has nice flavor and the kids loved it. I enjoyed it but will play with the seasonings some more to suit my personal tastes. I did decide to sprinkle chedder and mozza cheese over the top of the dish when 5 minutes were left and cover so the cheese melted nicely. It was very tasty (almost like pizza). I will be making this again.

I left out the salami b/c I didn't have any. I added about 1/2 cup more sauce then called for. After it was all mixed together I put it into a glass baking dish (sprayed with PAM) and topped it with shredded Mozzarella. Baked it til the cheese was melted about 20 min. The cheese added to the Pizza taste. Next time I will incorporate the cheese into the mixture then bake it so you get a little cheese in every bite. My 3 teenage boys loved this even my meat and potatoe loving hubby went back for seconds...thank goodness I quadrupled the recipe:) It doesn't get any easier than this! Thanks Elizabeth!

this was great and so easy. I made this with cubed precooked frozen chicken. I heated the chicken up in a skillet with a little extra virgin olive oil salt and pepper. Then added the sauce and pineapple. It made a wonderful sauce for the pasta. I also added a little parma and Mozzerella cheese mixed it all up and it was a huge hit with the family.

This is a great easy recipe! I added a little bit of hawaiian barbeque sauce to give it a little kick.

Good without salami and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese too. I wish I had thought of this on my own sooner!

This recipe was a last minute decision for me and I'm so glad I found it. I used Rotini instead of Radiatore. I also used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and an 8 oz. can of crushed pineapples. It turned out great!

This was definitely interesting to try! Some good things some okay things. The pasta and pineapple part was best. Personally I wasn t a huge fan of the salami. It might just be my personal taste but I would have liked ham or chicken as the meat. My family thought it was good.
