Just so happens, this sammie is the same in northeast MA.  I made one yesterday for the first time and a hint would be to get the rawest deli roastbeef and have them shave the meat at .04 on the slicer.  I can't get a really good cheesesteak where I live now in AZ, so I got going on my own and it came out great.  I carmelized onions, charred a red and yellow pepper.  Incorporated the prepared onion/peppers with the pan-fried shaved steak, topped with white american and it was delicious.  I will probably expand with pepper rings and different cheeses but this one was great on a sub roll.

This was the easiest steak sandwich to make and my family loved it!  I used provolone instead of the sharp Cheddar which gave it a smoky flavor.  I will fix this again.

This is the "quintessential" Massachusetts cheese steak! Pop the thing under the broiler for a few mins., if you like toasty bread. Serve with chips, pickle and a coffee shake!

Wow!  I've never had a Southeastern Massachusetts cheesesteak before but boy it sure is good.  I'm used to Philly style (Pat's or Geno's)and this is so "easy" and so delicious.  My husband is a fan of cheesesteaks so I thought I'd give this a try and am glad I did.  I bought "chip steak" which is basically sirloin cut paper thin.  It cooks in no time at all! I cut my onions and peppers lengthwise and lighty toasted my steak rolls under the broiler before piling on the ooey, gooey meat and cheese mixture. Nice recipe that's perfect for a quick weeknight meal.  Goes great with kettle cooked chips and an ice cold beer!

Used leftover london broil for this along with roasted red peppers and hot banana peppers. Pepper Jack cheese went nicely with this sandwich and so did some thinly sliced, fried potatoes. Thank you!!

it was a very good sandwich. it was very spicey, and smelled amazing while cooking. I acually forgot the cheese so it was less cheesesteak and more, well, steak. it was very easy to cook too. Steak + sandwich + spicey = the Perfect MANwich

Way to go!!!  I just love those cherry peppers in this sandwich and I add some of the juice from the jar to the pan when it's cooking.  Put a small lid over the meat/cheese and the cheese will melt faster.

If you brown the baguette on the inside, it will help keep any grease out of the bun. Also while unfrozen meat might be easier to cut, using fresh never frozen steak will ensure maximum quality. Great recipe.

Fast and Easy!!! I thought these sandwiches were great...but I did make quite a few changes. I used leftover steak. Used havarti cheese. Focaccia bread and omitted the peppers. Beyond that....amazing!

Love this recipe.  The first time I made this with a Sirloin Steak I found on sale.  I cut it really thin and then fried it up & then fried up the onion, mushroom and green pepper.  Cut open a loaf of Italian Bread and toasted it.  Then topped it with steak and veggies and put cheese on top.  Put back in oven on broil for a minute to melt the cheese.  Added steak sauce to my portion and it was soooo delicious.

Great steak sandwich, I liked the spiceyness of it. I didn't have pickled hot peppers so I used serrano chiles that I left the seeds in! The only other thing I changed was using 2 slices provolone cheese and two slices pepper jack cheese in place of the sharp cheddar. I did warm them in the oven long enough for the cheese to melt. So good!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

Fantastic!  I had a steak that was getting past its prime in the freezer and decided to make this with it.  It was so good!  I put this on my homemade french bread, sliced and toasted the bread in the broiler then added the meat/cheese then broiled it again until it was bubbly.  I made enough for the whole family and had one sandwich already made but leftover.  I craved it all day the next day and after work I stuck the leftover sandwich under the broiler again to heat and it tasted even better than the day before!  (Maybe it was the anticipation)  I will be making this often!

My hubby loved it! I on the other hand thought it was good... but not ummmm good. I would tweak it a bit next time. I would use Vidalia onion and I would not cook it till it was caramelized, but tender and juicy. I would use swiss cheese or provolone instead of cheddar. I might cut out the mushrooms. But it is all a matter of preference. Overall good recipe!!

perfect for leftover steak- i use pepperoncinis because we always have them in the house, and provolone.  I didn't have sub rolls so I made some pizza dough and turned them into calzones- DH at both his for dinner and the one I had made for lunch the next day.

Excellent recipe!  Used it more as a base.  Didn't have hoagie rolls, but we did have some onion buns that worked really well.  Used red bell peppers, red onions, and instead of hot peppers we used sweet cherry peppers.  Used roast beef lunch meat.  Also used provolone cheese as someone else suggested.  Turned out GREAT!  We'll make this again.

I made this for hubby and myself over the weekend...what a fabulous sandwich! I'm a lazy cook and this was simple and quick...met my criteria exactly! I played around with the measurements (remember, lazy) like I dumped an 8 oz. container of sliced, fresh mushrooms, used a whole sliced bell pepper and a whole sliced onion, tossed in some garlic for good measure...used a combination of sliced provolone and sliced sharp cheddar, because it's what I had on hand. Next time I think I'll get some of those cheese sub rolls or maybe onion rolls. I don't think you could go wrong with this recipe. I used about a pound of boneless chuck steak I got on sale...put in the freezer and let it get good and hard, then retrieved it and sliced it way thin (easier that way!). It fed my husband and I three times. Can't beat that!

Very good sandwich.  I put alittle bit of butter and some provolone cheese on a roll and put under the broiler until cheese melts.  I just used left over london broil and sliced it very thin.  Quick and easy meal.

Very good and easy to make. I added a bit extra peppers, onions and mushrooms. I used Golden Pepperoncini because that is what I had on hand. My kids really liked this!

My family liked this sandwich very much. I used leftover ribeye steak (cooked medium rare), which I sliced thinly and cooked through for this sandwich. I also used Provolone cheese since that is what I had on hand. The addition of the pickled peppers is what really made this sandwich great. I hollowed out the baguettes before filling them. Will definitely make this again!

A great recipe. I tweaked it a little bit just for my husbands taste, cut up jalapeños so tiny and let it melt in the cheese to which I added a little provolone. He said it was the best steak sandwich he ever had. I loved it too.

Delicious! I’m from Massachusetts, where we have no shortage of sub shops that make great steak and cheese subs, but for weeks I’ve been seeing shaved steak for sale at my local grocery store and decided I’d give this recipe a try- I’m glad I did!  This was one of the best steak subs I’ve had.  While I do try to follow any recipe to the letter when I first make it, I did have to use canned mushroom (stems and pieces) and American cheese- because that’s what I had on hand; I also skipped the pickled peppers because I didn’t have any.  Regardless this was 5 stars all the way!  I will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks for posting this tasty recipe!

I don't know what a Philly Cheesesteak is supposed to taste  like. I see some reviewers claim it's not the same, but it's the best steak sub I've had in years. The only change I made is to eliminate the 2 items that make it spicy and hot. It still had a great flavour without ithem Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Made it!  It was very good.  My wife & I are on a clean diet right now.  We substituted olive oil for butter, & whole wheat tortillas for the bread.  It would have probably been better with the bread & butter, but now we won't feel guilty for cheating on the diet!!

Loved this as written!! So yummy I used left over beef tenderloin from work. Cooked the onions first, then added the mushrooms cooked a bit then added the red and green pepper.  Since the meat was already cooked I just sliced it thin and added it to the veggies with pepperchinies (spelling ugh) salt and pepper. Once meat was hot I topped the mixture with white American cheese and loaded it into rolls!!!! So good the boys had two each, lol regretted it later but loved it!

Great Sandwhich. I used seasonings on my onions as I sautéed them. Great flavor. Also seasoned the meat with garlic, season all, salt, pepper and accent. Also used vinegar! Yum! Can substitute any cheese or a combo!

This is so easy and SO delicious! The first time I made it, I didn't add the mushrooms or pickled hot pepper. It's great both ways.

My husband loved this sandwich! I doubled the recipe and used chuck roast. I also covered the dish for the cheese to melt as other readers mentioned.  Would definitely make this again!
