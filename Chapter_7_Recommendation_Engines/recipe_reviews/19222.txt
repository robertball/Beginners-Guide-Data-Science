This recipe, we've always known as ITALIAN BROWNIES...  Not sure where that name came from...
Mom makes these every year at Christmas.  One nice adition is to sift powdered sugar over the top...  for a pretty display.  (also sweetens 'em up a bit)...
3 eggs

3 Tbsp. flour
1/2 tsp. baking powder
2 1/4 C light brown sugar
1 C chopped nuts
3/4 C flaked coconut

is my Mom's amounts, but Dream Bars II turns out really delicious too...  and less sugar..  :)  (makes up with the flaked coconut, which is loaded with sugar)  so either way, it's about the same.
Thanks for a good recipe.

I used the cocoa version and loved the flavor!  I liked the coconut in it as well.  Really yummy, but to be honest, I prefer brownies over these.

Not as tasty as I had hoped.  A little bland, but I think changing the ingredients slightly would help a lot.  Something needs to make it sweeter.

Increased all the ingredients by 1/4 to make a jelly roll pan for a potluck. Also added a package of butterscotch chips. Baked the crust for 10 minutes and the bars for 20. They were fantastic! Thank you for a great recipe!!!

My husband loved this!  Was looking for a particular Swedish dessert he liked that incorporated coconut and cocoa and found this.  Not the same one, but he loved it all the same!  Quick and easy to make.  Whipped some cream and added some vanilla sugar and sugar into it to make really sweet.  Used cocoa in this one.

I made these today for the first time and love how easy and fool proof they are.  These hold together well and taste great -- two requirements I have for a good bar cookie recipe.

This is a recipe my mother made when I was very small. when she sold her house a recipe book with many "handwritten " recipes were lost this was one of them Thank you from the bottom of my heart. We were from Missouri I wonder where the recipe started.

Could have been good, but addition of walnuts, changed the taste I was expecting.  Had a great recipe for Dream Bars from long ago, which did not use cocao or nuts.  My recipe tasted like chewy coconut and was always a hit.....

These were delicious! I used about 1/4 C more brown sugar in the base layer, left out the optional cocoa, substituted pecans for the walnuts because that’s what I had on hand, and used unsweetened coconut flakes. These bars are plenty sweet with all the brown sugar in the original recipe, and the pecans and brown sugar likened them to a pecan pie lover’s palette. Adding sifted powdered sugar to the finished product like another baker suggested gives them a more polished finish.

Tried it & gotta say I like our  very old "secret" family recipe called Dream Cake better.  Passed down thru 4 generations from Canada. (The very French canadian part) Have never heard of it anywhere else or with cocoa.  Our version has quite a bit more brown sugar, vanilla & another egg in the wet mixture.  We also add 1-1 1/2 cups of crushed corn flakes.  This makes a great crispy top layer & an ooey-gooey center.

I found that the crust remained crumbly and didn't stick to the top layer. The second time I made the recipe I just greased the pan and skipped the crust. Instead I poured the batter directly into the pan and baked for the indicated 30 minutes. In this version the recipe makes a wonderful batch of brownies.

These are to die for.  I added caramel balls and grated some dark chocolate Dove bar over them but I really think they would have been yummy without the additions.
