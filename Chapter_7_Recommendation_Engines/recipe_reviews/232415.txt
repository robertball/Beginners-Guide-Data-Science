i am cuban  we cook very simple , its better when you made a marinate like  mojo so we call it, sour orange, roasted cumin it has to be roasted so you can get the full flavor of the cumin seeds,oregano, black pepper ,sea salt ,lots of minced garlic, and a steak, we usually use a very thin steak like palomilla style(is a cuban thing) .we pound the steak with a hammer or any heavy object , then marinate into that mojo. you can after all the stekeas are marinating acut some white onons rings and dump it together, when frying the steaks  please do not let it cook all the way through, or however you like  to eat it, then after frying them set them on aside, in the same oil i use olive oil nt much just enough to give them a nice caramelized color outside, then add the onions and some of that mojo, frye the onions until translucients and then add the steaks, and tse them a bit them cover and simmer for just 4 mnts . and then.! que rico! a comer! let us eat with some black bean potage and white rice, fry green plantains mmmm yummy! i hope i help you somehow.

Used boneless NY strip steaks instead of rib eyes.  This marinade gave the steaks a flavor unlike any marinade I've ever used.  I live in Florida, so I'm accustomed to eating Cuban cuisine (and love it), but this was just really incredibly delicious.  I had to go to 3 stores to find the cumin "seeds," but I'm glad I did because that's the first flavor that jumps out at you.  Had this for dinner with black beans and yellow rice garnished with chopped onions and an ear of corn on the cob.  Just delicious.

Absolutely delicious marinade!  So moist and flavorful.  Made exactly as written, perfect for two steaks.  You might want to double for more.  Great grilling recipe, definitely a do over.  Thanks for sharing with AR.

Used Skirt Steak so I could cook it in the frying pan. It was awesome, and the hubby loved it. My version of Montreal-style seasoning has a lot of salt in it, so for next time I will use less, to get a cleaner taste.

Pretty good eats, and easy to master. The only difference I would suggest is not to use plain orange juice unless you have to. There are bitter orange products available in stores that cater to those who cook in the "hispanic" manner.... called (1) Mojo Criollo, and (2) Naranja Agria. Either one will produce a far superior flavor than plain orange. I have even found them in the bitters/mixes section of my local supermarket's wine department.

My husband and daughter liked this very well. I used all of the marinade ingredients exactly, but I marinated the steak for about 8 hours. I also used top sirloin instead of rib eye, both because of the cost and also the fat content. My family said the steak was tender. Thanks!

Awesome!  We made the following changes: replaced the orange juice with fresh lime juice and added 1/2 bottle of light colored beer such as Corona to the marinate.  Also added 1-2 Tbls fresh chopped garlic.

Some of the best steak marinade I've ever had, and I have been to very very expensive steakhouses. I followed some other reviewers suggestions and used NY strip steak instead. Followed the recipe exactly and it was soo juicy and all the ingredients just melt in your mouth. Since it's -16 degrees in Chicago I used the oven and broiled it. Ate the steak with a side of corn, roasted potatoes with sautéed green beans and carrots. I will be dreaming of this dish for many nights until I make it again :-)

A "must-make" recipe. Just made this and had to use my electric indoor (GF)grill due to rain/wind outside. I used three 1-plus pound steaks and tripled the recipe. Turned out great--probably some of the best steak I've ever had. Very flavorful, juicy and tender! My wife and I almost finished off one of the steaks before our asparagus and garlic mash potatoes were done. Oh, and the smell of the roasted cumin made the whole house smell almost heavenly. Will continue to use this recipe for my beef marinade. Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed!

Delicious marinade, but if you like a medium rare steak, take it off at 120 degrees and let sit for 10 minutes. 145 degrees with sitting will be well past  medium.

Great. I used a boneless cut of meat and a lean cut to cut back on fat. But if I gave it to someone, nobody would know it was a lean cut because it tasted so good! It was raining today so I just cooked it on the stove for about 5 minutes per side. Make sure to let it rest even if you grill it, the juices will stay inside.

Villy, the onion and garlic is in the Montreal seasoning mix and it has OJ in it, it doesn't need to be sour.  I got almost this exact recipe from a Cuban.  He used it on pork, which is the meat I have always used for this marinade, he added cilantro instead of oregano.  He didn't use cumin seeds, he used the powdered.  I had to beg the recipe out of him, and I am glad he shared it w/me because it is excellent on a pork roast shredded on a toasted bun.  I am looking forward to trying it on steak, and trying it w/the seeds and oregano.

I haven't had Cuban steak this good since our vacation in Florida! It was easy and delicious. I served it with cilantro lime rice. I put all the ingredients in a freezer bag and froze it for cooking later. I took it out the night before cooking and thawed in the refrigerator. I broiled instead of grilling. To cold to grill here! I will definitely try this again, already have it together and in the freezer! Maybe we will have a day nice enough to grill. If not, the oven worked fine and my house smelled delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this marinade.  I doubled the recipe and used low sodium Montreal Steak seasoning because that's all that was available in my store.  I added one clove of garlic minced as I love garlic.  Left it in the marinade for about 4 1/2 hours and grilled it. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. It didn't need steak sauce or any other seasoning. I definitely will make it again.

A little premature as I'm making this tonight.  I'm giving it 5 stars as it sounds amazing.  I'm using flap steak which my butcher says is similar to skirt steak.  He didn't know why you would use a cut of meat like rib eye which is usually not marinated except for maybe a dry rub.  It's already tender and has great flavor on its own.  He thought the flap steak would be very good.  Made the marinade exactly as written. Gonna marinate for 5 hours but wish I had a little longer because of the cut of meat.  I'll let you know how it turns out.

Delicious! Followed recipe exactly except used slightly less Montreal steak seasoning to lower salt intake and NY strip steak which were half price. We don't eat steak very often because the flavor can be disappointing unless you spend big bucks. But with this marinade you get great flavor and can probably use less expensive cuts if you marinate for a few hours. Moving this one to the "Keepers" folder!

This was a great change-up on our usual steak seasoning.  The only thing I did different was use regular powdered cumin, because it was all I had.  I plan to add cumin seeds to my spice cabinet so that I can try them next time.  The citrus brought a great freshness to the steak.  Next time I also want to try putting onions in with the steak to marinate and then cooking them up to serve with it.  I used ribeye, but I want to try skirt steak as the citrus should tenderize the meat nicely for a good steak sandwich.

I've made this twice, following the recipe exactly, except for the exception of using ground cumin and broiling the steak. We usually have left overs, not this time. My family ate it all! This is definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe!

This was wonderful!  I completely forgot to roast the cumin seeds, which I am sure would make them more aromatic, so I will do that next time.  I also used Spicy Montreal-style Steak seasoning since my family likes everything spicy.  

Next time, I think I will let these marinate overnight.  I marinated mine for about 5 hours, but I want to see how great they will taste after marinating longer.

This was a nice change from our usual Montreal Steak Seasoning. We added about half a cup of fresh cilantro to the marinade and it turned out great.

I had a bizarre craving for steak. Like pregnancy craving bad haha! Anyways I was looking up steak marinades and found this gem and I’m so happy I did! IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST STEAK MARINADES IVE EVER HAD! The only thing was I could not find any cumin seeds at the store I was at so I substituted it with grounded cumin. And I only used 1/8 of a tsp. I’m sure with the actual seeds it tastes more amazing but I couldn’t find any!

I can’t give it 5 stars because I did not have the cumin seeds on hand and substituted the ground cumin.  However, despite that, the steak was a huge hit in our home.  It has become our go-to marinade recipe for steaks.  It has a great flavor, tenderizes the meat, and keeps it juicy.

I use ground cumin instead of the seeds. I prefer to use fresh squeezed orange juice. Have also used this marinade on different beef cuts and also cooked the meat on the stove. No matter how I cook it there never is any leftovers ! My family loves this marinade !!

I thought it was tasty, but apparently my family doesn’t like their beef marinated in anything citrus :(.  Probably won’t make it again, but that is our preference.  Anyone who makes this is going to enjoy it if they are into food from tropical areas.

Will  definitely make again. I didn't have any rib eye steaks but used round steaks that I had on hand. Followed the recipe with the exception of the cumin seeds, I didn't have the seeds on hand but did have ground cumin. Marinated the steaks overnight

This is the 3rd time I have made it with different cuts of beef and I love it! I never considered using beef for a recipe like this, but it's very good. I would have given it a 5-star review, but no Cuban would make this without garlic. So I added a heaping teaspoon of pureed garlic, and I also used fresh oregano. Unfortunately I can't buy bitter orange where I live, so I used equal parts orange juice and lime juice. I also don't have a grill, but it turned out fine on the stove.  Next time I am going to try the recipe on butterfly pork chops.

I don't generally like my steaks marinated, but this sounded good so i tried it. I liked it quite a bit. But... did I mention that i don't generally like my steaks marinated? I decided to try it on a pork loin... and viola! It was really, really good for that pork. This will become my go to marinade for those loins in the future.

OH MY GOD!!!! This was AMAZING! I admit I was a little skeptical based on some of the ingredients however I would NOT change a thing! Made it with flank steak rather than rib-eye and let it marinate for roughly 8 hours before grilling. One of the most flavorful and juiciest steaks we have ever made. Highly recommend this recipe!

I really enjoyed the recipe but I couldn’t help but too put a tad bit of my own flavor in it. I still used a bit of my marinade and Cajun spices. My family enjoyed the change in taste and I will definitely use this recipe again. Just have to try not to tweek it a bit with my own lol.

The longer it marinates the more tender it gets.  I marinated enough to have some after 24, then 48 and finally 72 hours after I first mixed it all.  It just got better and better...the cumin-citrus mix was delish!

This was a great marinade, totally different from the normal.  I started it the night before, and flipped the meat a couple times throughout the day.  I think it would also work well with chicken breasts.  I plan to try it that way next time.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again.  I made no changes, and don't know what I would change if I did.

A very easy recipe to make.  I had to substitute lemon for lime and oregano with mixed herbs and it still tasted fantastic.  It was a meal that we had a couple of nights ago and my children want me to make it again tonight!

Incredibly delicious!  I loved the multilayered flavors.

I paired it with this recipe for Cuban black beans and also had plain white rice with the meal. My husband likes his steaks charred, hence the burnt edges.

This was just ok for us. The steak had a lot of flavor, but I think it needed salt. Too much flavor for a good quality steak. You couldn’t enjoy the flavor of the meat. It would be better with a sirloin. I don’t know what I expected, but I wasn’t overjoyed with this one. Not sure I would make again.

Really easy!   Was a hit with everyone.     I didn't have orange juice so I substituted grapefruit juice- worked well.     I marinated slice onions in the marinade and sauted them separately while the meat grilled (suggested by another reviewer- big hit).    I also made potato wedges from Russets that I started on the grill, finished in the oven, went well  with the steak.

My husband and I wanted to make a real latin dish with steak, red beans and white rice - like we get in an authentic latin restaurant. We were a little skeptical to try yet another acidic recipe involving lime juice and orange juice because of so many other failed attempts... However, this recipe is perfect! We were so shocked and surprised at how good it was! We marinated three small/medium sized rib eyes for a few days in the fridge and grilled them to crispy perfection. We were so proud of ourselves. We're making the dish again this week with black beans!

This review is for my future reference, not for people to get annoyed that I didn't follow the recipe!  I used much less than 2 tbsp of the Montreal steak seasoning.  And it was plenty.  (Used 2 tsp).   Also, I don't know what the fuss over Montreal steak seasoning is because it tasted like Mrs Dash original blend to me...,   
The steak was ok, we ate it.  But it wasn't awesome.....

One of my favorite steaks ever. Living in Costa Rica, rib eyes are not common, but we have the tenderloin available. We marinated the steaks overnight for 12 hours and the steaks were jaw dropping good. We also made another allrecipes recipes for Pacific Cuban Black Beans and Rice. Best flavor of beans and very different.

Wow what a great recipe.  I doubled and used on a 3 lb sirloin tip roast.  Marinated for about 7 hours then roasted at 350 for about 1 half hours with the marinate in the roasting pan as well.  Cooked tatters and other veggies in same pan.  Will be making again.

I thought the recipe was okay.  I will give the recipe another try but use less cumin seed as I didn't care too much for the taste.  My daughter really like the dish.  I served with spanish red beans and rice.

This is so weird. I've made this dish yesterday but I got the recipe off BJ's Member Journal.  This dish is soooo good!
