My kids loved this!!  They played with it a little at first, but really seemed to enjoy eating it more. Either way it was a hit. And it was super easy to make.

I made this for my grandkids recently and they loved the taste as well as shaping things with it.  They were shocked that they were allowed to eat it too! I scaled the recipe down to 5 servings which was plenty for the 3 of them to "test" it out. Although some of the ingredients are very sweet, there is also peanut butter and milk which adds to their protein intake. I agree, it is a wonderful idea to help younger hands develop better small motor skills and have fun at the same time! Their little hands got somewhat sticky from playing and eating this, but they didn't mind washing up when they were done. This recipe is a Great idea!

I *loved* this stuff as a kid, when my mom made it she made "fingers" and they were "p.b. fingers" to us. I am glad I found this again, she didnt have the recipe anymore and I wanted it for my kids. Thanks!
