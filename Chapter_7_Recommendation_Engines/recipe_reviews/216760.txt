This was really good! My local Meijer did not have pork belly so I used a pork loin, but I followed the recipe and cooking directions exactly. Also could not find the Bonito flakes, so I used Oyster Sauce that I found in the asain section. (I read online that was a good substitute) The sauce was delicious!! Make sure to cut the meat into small pcs so that it can soak up as much sauce as possible. Served w/white rice and steamed broccoli, sugar snaps and baby carrots. MMMMmmmmm!

very authentic japanese recipe.  We used Kurobuta Pork belly the flavor is so intense and great..Leftover sauce is good for Yakisoba or any type of Asian stir fry... or just mix it with plain steamed rice....

This recipe which I made exactly the way it is listed here is very good! It didn't get 5 stars because it is really, really sweet! My husband didn't love it, but myself and the teenage boys did. 
It's very simple and so tasty! I served it with brown rice and broccoli, and every last bit was eaten up. I would highly recommend LOTS of water before & after this dish as it made all of us very thirsty. Thanks so much!

I stuck extremely close to the recipe at hand and served this over White Rice, Noodles, Broccoli and Boneless Side Pork Meat. It was delicious. 
I saved the remaining sauce after our meal, chilled it overnight and then marinated Pork Tenderloin in it for a day. I served it thickened over the oven-cooked Tenderloin, Garlic Mashed Potatoes and a Garlic Veggie Medley I made and again, delicious!!!
My husband made me go back and find the recipe so we could make sure to use it many times more.

I used this for a sauce in a pork tenderloin and vegetable stir fry. I just made the sauce as directed and poured it over leftover cubed pork and white rice and added a package of frozen stir fry veggies in a wok. I always have leftover rice so I make alot of stir fry and this was a really good one. I bet the recipe is even better in its original form.

We loved this! I found a meat market near our home that carries fresh pork belly. I used 2 pounds of the belly so I upped the 1/2 cup of everything to 3/4 cup. I used fresh ginger instead of ginger powder & oyster sauce instead of water. So the sauce wasn't very sweet in spite of the mirin & brown sugar. And although I used a lower sodium soy sauce, the sodium punch is significant. I was informed by my husband I may have overcooked the meat a bit, but that the leftovers are his. Not that there's much, maybe enough for his lunch. Next time I make this, I'm adding mixed vegetables to the rice. This is awesome.

Wonderful recipe. I tried it after seeing it prepared in my Roku channels. I used pork loin as I didn't have any pork belly but it was a big hit!

I have a hatred for meat that is sweet tasting. I took one bite and gave it to my husband. He liked liked it, but didn't think it was anything special.

Have lived in Okinawa 28 years.  But only recently started making my own soba and other delicious local food.  Added just a touch of awamori and is delicious!

This was very good. Easy and did not take half the day. I added some garlic chili paste, a spicy pepper whole and some spices. When it was done I threw the pork belly only,  on a flat top and caramelized it then added the sauce back to it. It was over the top and crispy by doing that. I doubled the recipe. Used it as an appetizer and it disappeared so fast I had to grab a bite before it was gone. Everyone loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly. it was so good. I had to go to an out of the way butcher shop to find pork belly so just look around your town and call to see. I made it with soba noodles in beef broth with some fresh veggies.

There are 5-star recipes and then sometimes you run across Gold star recipes. This is one of those Gold star ones. It’s also highly addictive, so, beware! It has a perfect balance between savoury and sweet that seems to exhault the flavor of the pork. It went beautifully with an egg, served over soba. Method is easy even though it may seem laborious. Thank you for the recipe.

This was an excellent recipe.  Not too fussy, and a perfect way to use the pork bellies I've got piling up from my meat share!  One of the few recipes I could find that didn't take several hours marinating or resting.  I had most ingredients on hand, and just left out the Mirin.  I doubled the sugar and water because I used 2 pork bellies, but I left the soy sauce the same.  After completing the final simmer, I removed the meat from the sauce, and put under the broiler for about 5 minutes.  Served with rice.  Will definitely make again.

This Okinawan Pork recipe is awesome, I used the pork belly boiled water to cook the ramen noodles and par cooked the bak choy. Once the pork was done I spooned the sauce from the pork into the ramen mix and added diced ginger, onion, green onion carrots and hard boiled eggs, what a diversified recipe. Can't wait to play with the recipe again!

I ended up using the "pork water" to boil rice.  It was delicious and gave the rice so much more flavor!

Daughter #2 is on Okinawa with her Marine hubby. After visiting, I become more interested as the local cuisine was wonderful.  I stuck to the recipe the first time I made this. My wife and I loved it! The next time I cleaned, diced, and quickly boiled some goya (bitter melon). After the melon was drained it was added to the fry pan with just a touch (1/4 tsp) of sesame oil and briefly fried prior to adding the rest of the ingredients. If you thought it was too sweet, try adding about 2 cups of goya to the recipe. What a wonderful blend of sweet and bitter!

recently switched to Okinawa meals. I think it tastes much nicer if you avoid the sugar and add just a quarter spoon of manuka honey

I quite liked this. The first time I made it was exactly as the recipe shows, but I found the pork belly not to be as good as I'd expected. Made it the second time with pork loin and liked that considerably more. Only giving it 4 stars because it's a bit sweeter than I like, but still a recipe I'm going to keep and use again.

I used pork belly and the meat was chewy rather than tender.  I'm not sure what went wrong.  Rated this a two star because I did enjoy the flavor of the sauce.

I couldn't find pork belly in my local supermarket so instead I used boneless pork stew and sautéed it to cook it a little then put in the sause and followed the recipe after that. I then grilled up some pineapple rings in the pan I cooked the pork in, cut it up, added it to the pork, and then served it over rice. It was delicious. The sause on this was so good I just wanted to lick the bowl clean!

I grew up in Okinawa so of course I had to try it! The smell is so good while it's cooking... I have also made this adapted for the slow cooker using a pork loin. Just halve the ingredients for the sauce, make sure the sugar is dissolved in the shoyu, and pour over the chunks of pork cook on low for 6 hrs or so, turning chunks once, and when it's done, it'll fall apart in delicious pieces.
