This recipe is deliciously thick and chewy, and goes great on rice.  The words vegetarian and vegan might deter some people but let me assure you it is as good as any meaty soup. I did not have harissa so looked up a recipe and just threw in some of the spices I had that were in my cupboard and it turned out great including quite a bit of chili powder. I used tomatoes and mint from my garden.  I did peel the tomatoes because it is such a simple procedure. My husband really likes it, and has asked for it again!
