I am a former military dependent who spent over 7 years in Germany some of my fondest memories was of the food. I was looking for a quick authentic style of dish to make for my family. THIS one was perfect. I loved it they loved it and want me to make it again and again. I love authenticity of it and how easy and inexpensive it is to make. Anyone who who vairies from this recipe, in my opinion is not looking for authentic German Style food. Thank You for posting this recipe.

I felt this was rather bland and dry. If I make it again, I will add more cheese sauce, kraut and kielbasa, maybe even use sharp cheddar. I was rather disappointed as I love all the ingredients. I had hoped it would have more flavor. Sorry, just didn't do anything for me.

I have made this recipe twice now, but modifying the recipe and ingredients somewhat. The 1st time I made this, I used about 8 oz. of regular wide noodles (not Kluski noodles though), and using 1-1/2 cups of sauerkraut (but used bavarian sauerkraut, as that's what I had on hand), plus I added 1 teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder to the flour and other spices. The 2nd time I made this, I used 7 oz. of wide noodles, along with the 2 cups of sauerkraut, plus the teaspoon each of garlic powder and onion powder to the flour and other spices. Fixed both ways was good, but while I preferred the less sauerkraut and 8 oz. of noodles, my husband prefered this dish with the 2 cups of kraut with the 7 ounces of noodles. Also... I prepared the sauce in a 3 quart saucepan, and adding 1 cup of cheese to it, then stirred in the cubed sausage and kraut, and added it to a greased casserole baking dish, plus stirred in the cooked noodles as well. Topped the casserole with a mixture of 4 tablespoons of plain dried bread crumbs mixed with 2 tablespoons of melted butter, and baked it in the oven for 25 minutes. This made 6 delicious servings! If you love kraut, you'll love this main dish! One more thing... instead of Kielbasa, I used ECKRICH Skinless Smoked Sausage (a 14-oz. package). This is a great recipe! I could eat this at least once a month. Also, this recipe definitely deserves more than 5 stars, as that's how good it is. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

I used mild cheddar and may use sharp next time just to give it a little extra. I also used 2 cups of cheese and couldn't find the suggested noodles so used bucatini noodles. I mixed everything together in the caserole dish and popped it in the oven. Will definitely make again and again. Big hit with hubby & teenagers. Thanks for posting!

Delicious! I used light velveeta in place of the cheddar b/c I have better luck w/ melting it. I also cooked the kielbasa a bit in a pan to get out any liquid and to just cook it through. I rinsed my sauerkraut b/c I don't care for a strong sour taste, so I did need to add a bit of salt to compensate for that. This is serious comfort food, and I will def be making it again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made this with swiss cheese instead of cheddar.  Browned the sausage a little, used a 32oz jar of kraut, and 16oz of noodles.  Very easy to put together and tasted great.

This was wonderful. Great comfort food, thanks for submitting JustJen!  I had most of the ingredients on hand, so yes, this was very economical for my family.  My fiance agreed this was great & I will definitely make again with possibly the following changes...increase the dry mustard powder and slightly more sauerkraut. The directions were very straight forward & easy to follow. Overall, great recipe & will add to my "menu". UPDATE:  I just made this last night on a whim, it was cold & rainy & we needed some comfort :)  I only had about 1 - 1/4 cup sauerkraut left & ran out of milk after 2 & 3/4 c  so I used 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream to top it off along with a very generous T of ground mustard & my oh my. This was stupendous & we all agreed it was much better the second time around.  My fiance loved it and said "This hit the spot!"  Will make my version next time as he says the sauerkraut easily overtakes the entire dish whereas I thought I'd add more (silly me).

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used extra sharp cheddar cheese.  It was fantastic.  Perfect for these cool Autumn days.  I sent half of it home to a friend and he thought it was wonderful too.  I will definitely make again throughout the Winter.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Used just plan egg noodles as that is what I had on hand. I made just as stated but the sauce just didn't seem cheesy enough, I had to almost double it. I also added more than 2 cups of kraut just to use the whole can. I felt that was a bit much but my hunny had thirds and told me to add just as much next time. really warm comfy feeling well eating it. Now time for a nap

I used homemade spaezle instead of noodles for the pasta and it was a good substitution.  I'm not sure how it will be heated up but it was worth trying.

I made this for dinner tonite and followed the recipe as written, other than using vegetarian sausage.  It had no taste and was rather dry.  I ended up throwing the remainder in the garbage.  Thanks for posting the recipe, just wasn't good for me.

As a family tradition I try to have pork and sauerkraut for New Year’s Day.  My son hates sauerkraut but the whole family thought this was awesome! I added some cubed ham because i had some to use up.  I’ll definitely make this again

I liked the recipe when I had a bite of the kielbasa mixed with it but when I ate the pasta by itself it was kind of bland and dry. I don't want to give up on the recipe so I think next time I will make a larger batch of the cheese sauce and add more kraut and sausage. I'll try again and try to update

Needed more flavour so I modified as follows: Instead of butter I used bacon fat. I doubled the mustard and used German mustard (not dry.) I added 1t. garlic powder to the flour, and dried onion to the sauce, after adding the milk. I added quite a bit of salt and pepper to taste and used more (medium) cheddar than suggested. I sauteed farmer sausage with green onion instead of kielbasa. I used egg noodles. I ground up sourdough into breadcrumbs.  I  only used 1-1/3c. sauerkraut. It was delicious and great comfort food.

Solid comfort food recipe. To cut some fat, I browned the sausage in a no-stick saute pan and then let rest on some paper towels. Easily you could sub turkey kielbasa. Some fresh chopped parsley was a pleasant addition.

I made this with Swiss cheese instead of cheddar,  as that seemed a little more traditional.  My kraut was really plain,  so I added caraway seeds to it. 

Good flavor, but it didn't have enough sauce in the leftovers, so I've been spooning Alfredo from a jar on each portion that I reheat.  

My husband asked me not to make it again only because it is so unhealthy.  So perhaps as a rare treat,  and don't try to cut down on the sauce to save calories or it will be dry.

Big hit in our house! Used fresh polish sausage and pre-cooked simmering in beer with onion, garlic, and a sprinkle of pepper and rubbed sage before slicing. also, used Reames frozen egg noodles. The only other changes where in making the sauce I added a little garlic salt & parsley flakes, then after assembled i grated some extra sharp cheddar very funely on top. Definately a keeper! Though does requite more tie for prep

Really liked this recipe.  Made it twice and is a favorite but high in calories so only an occasional treat.
