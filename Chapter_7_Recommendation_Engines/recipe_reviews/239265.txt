This is a great recipe. My kids had no idea there were carrots in these! You can substitute coconut oil for the oil with great results.

These turned out amazingly moist and flavorful. Reminiscent of “Costco’s” chocolate muffins but much better for you. I did substitute almond milk for the milk as my boys have an allergy to dairy. This recipe was enjoyed by all ages in my house.

I followed the recipe except added a handful more, or so, of chocolate chips. These cupcakes are so moist and absolutely delicious!

I didn’t want to open a big jar of applesauce, so I made my own from some Honey Crisp apple. I increased each  of the chocolate chips and the dried cranberries to 1/2 cup.  Since I was using large cupcake liners, I ended up with 16 muffins. I gifted the muffins to a few friends and they were a big hit. Deemed a ‘do-over’. I bought more carrots and the little applesauce cups so that I can make these again next week.

These turned out so well and my picky kid ate carrots! What a great way to sneak in a smidge of vegetables. They might not be quite as decadent as a regular chocolate cupcake, but they are very close. I will be making these again!

To die for delish and stupid easy to make. Comes out moist and decadent and is inhaled by by crew and their classmates every time. I ran out of applesauce so subbed oil and it turned out fine. Also, if you steam those carrots until no longer crunchy and throw them through the puree setting in your Blender - you can make the ENTIRE RECIPE IN YOUR BLENDER. Total game changer. Thank you for this recipe - I'll quite literally never do another carrot cake as long as I live.

Followed the recipe as listed adding the cinnamon and double chocolate chips instead of dried cranberries- they turned out perfect. I made one dozen regular size muffins and six oversized ones. The larger ones only needed a couple extra minutes, I baked for the minimum time listed.

Very nice way to use up some carrots from the garden. I made these with the cinnamon, without the cranberries. Next time I will put in more chocolate chips, because I'm a chocoholic.
