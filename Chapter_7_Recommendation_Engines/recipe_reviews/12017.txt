I tried this recipe a few days ago and it is awesome.  My husband loved it and my 2 yr. old ate everything on her plate. I added freash zucchini,yellow squash,cherry tomatoes and 1 red pepper, yellow pepper and orange pepper and mushrooms in place of the frozen vegetables. I grilled the vegetables in a wok rack on our outside grill with Italian dressing. I marinated the vegetables in the frig. first for about 30 min.  And the vegetables are better the next day for leftovers ----if-- there's anything left over.Thanks so much for the recipe. It's a keeper.

Sorry, too bland for this girl.  I would recommend some additional spices such as oregano and/or basil.  Perhaps even use italian stewed tomatoes. But I'm not going to give this recipe a second chance to find out if there is improvement.  There are many other recipes out there that are similar but have much more taste.

Good recipe, but it needed some more flavor for our family.  I added italian seasoning and fresh rosemary to liven it up a little.  I have also made it using different flavors of diced tomatoes such as the garlic and onion and the italian varities.  It smells delicious when cooking, and makes a filling main dish either by itself or by adding diced cooked chicken.

I'm a teenaged vegetarian, and I thought this recipe was really easy and quick, but it didn't have much of a taste... it was good, but kinda bland, although I did leave out the onions, mushrooms, and salt because of my family's preference.  Next time I will try some soy chicken in it... mmmm

WOW!  This was a very easy recipe to make, and it tasted like something you would order at a restaurant.  The next time I make it, I will use fresh veggies to make it taste EVEN BETTER, if that's possible.  A great dish to make if your company are vegetarians.

This recipie was delicious!!!  I added a little more spaghetti than the recipie called for though.  I'm just a beginning vegetarian, so I'm not really used to a lot of veggies yet.  At first, I thought it would be too vegetable-y for me, but it tasted GREAT!  My mom loved it too.  Even my brother, who thinks that no meal is complete without meat, liked it.  Great recipie.  Thanks!

Me and my mother really like this recipe. Its very fresh and easy to make. I have adapted it a bit to our own tastes, and I must say we make it about once every week or two. Its great in the summer.

I made this for dinner when a vegetarian relative was visiting and everyone loved it! I used fresh broccoli, cauliflower, and red pepper instead of frozen and accidentally bought Italian style chopped tomatoes instead of stewed and the result was absolutely delicious. I also served grilled chicken breasts for the non-vegens and the combination was perfect.

Thanks so much for sharing....this is definatly a keeper!

I liked this pasta dish a lot. I will definately make it again. I am 17 and new to cooking, so I was kinda worried when I was making this as to how it would turn out. But I actually did it and it was tastey too. And it didn't take long at all. I really recommend this dish.

My son enjoys making this dish with me, it has a great taste and is quick & easy to make.  The best thing is you can add any type of vegetable to it and you feel good making it because it's pretty healthy, especially if you use fresh vegetables to it although frozen work well in a pinch.

This was ok, we didn't really care for it, and I won't make it again.  It seemed more like a tomato veggie slop with noodles.  I would rather eat regular spagetti, sorry.

This was a great meal by itself, but I made some changes to make it a main dish. I used flavored tomatoes like others suggested, but I also added shrimp and used green onions instead of regular onions. Instead of spaghetti, I used bow tie pasta. My husband is not a big vegetable eater, but he loved this. I will definitely make this again, as this is easily adaptable to whatever I have on hand. Thanks!!

Yummmm! I really loved this recipe. It wasn't too heavy and the juicier veggies (like tomatoes) make their own sauce over the pasta that is perfect. My family loved it when I made it for them- it was the first time I had made them dinner and they were pleasently surprised. Even my brother, a meat-lover said he loved it!

This is a great recipe.  I have even made it with other packages of frozen mixed vegetables, when I can't find the "California Style" ones at my store.  My kids really like the pasta and flavor, so I usually make it with more than 6 ounces of spaghetti.  I have used up to a pound of pasta instead of the smaller amount and it still works great!

I was really surprised at how good this was.  I love tomatoes so I added about 2 cups of pasta sauce, some fresh diced tomatoes, and about 16 ounces of crushed tomatoes (left over from another dinner.)  The garlic, tomato, mushrooms, and vegetables all melded together so wonderfully!  Thank you for this fantastic recipe.  What a great twist to normal boring pasta!

Some relatives and I enjoyed this recipe for the 4th of July.  I thought it was really good, and I will be making it again.  My favorite part about this recipe, was that besides it being good it was healthy.

It was a really easy (and fun) recipe to make, but we were still hungry afterwards.

This was an easy dish to prepare with good ingredients, but it needed a little something more for the flavor.  It was still very tasty!

My whole family loved this.  It was an impresive looking meal.  My husband travels alot on business and says this is something he would eat at a high scale resturant.  I also added fresh s and used bottled basil.  I grilled chicken w/salt-n-pepper and garlic powder and this meal was excellent:)

very good, very healthy.  As a variation you might consider adding a cut up chicken breast or some Italian sausage.

This is a very easy and fairly quick recipe to make.  My kids don't especially like the veggies, but my husband and I ate it until it was gone.
I liked it as a cold dish too.
