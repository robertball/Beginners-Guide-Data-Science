This sugar-free cookie is really good as is, but I took it a step further and used this as a thumbprint cookie, putting the indentation in the middle before baking and then filling the "thumbprint" with sugar-free jelly after they cooled. This really made a fantastic cookie even better!!!

Hello, my dad is a diabetic and wanted to make him some cookies. I made a couple of alterations to make this recipe actually taste good instead of plan like many many recipes! LOL! OK, I talk alot. . . let me tell you what I did: 
  I only made half the recipe first.
  I substituted 2 Tablespoons of artificial sweetener and used 2 Tbs of fresh squeezed orage juice. I didn't use half of that amount because I really wanted the taste of it.
  1/2 of vanilla and of course the margarine
  Instead of adding water I again used 2 Tablespoons of orange juice :)
  1 cup of flour
  Since I didn't have any peanuts or peanut butter with nuts I didn't use the egg white or the peanuts; I used instead 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter, 1/2 cup of raisins, and I grated a large, fresh orange and used half of the gratings, plus I used a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon.
  Every oven seems to cook or bake differently anyway it baked very nicely for 20 minutes. They came out soft and a little sweet because of the raisins. I will make it again.
  You can e-mail me at royalblue33179@AOL.com about my alterations in this recipe, tell me what you think. Type in the subject box peanut butter cookies.
 Goodbye and happy baking.

Something must be missing--probably an egg.  When I took these out of the oven, they literally disintegrated!  Looking at the recipe now, I see there's nothing to bind the cookies--it's basically butter and flour.  Add an egg, and these would probably be very tasty.

These are great, considering they're sugar free.  I did make some alterations: I used 1/2 C dairy-free margarine (Nucoa) and 1/2 C peanut butter instead of 1 C margarine.  I also put an additional teaspoons of vanilla in after tasting the dough.  I added 1 Tablespoon of honey in addition to the artificial sweetner.  Also, since I can't have gluten, I used 1 2/3 C brown rice flour and 1/3 C amaranth flour.  I made one tray, and was wishing they were a little sweeter, so I dipped the tops of the rest in Xylitol (after rolling in peanuts).  They come out looking glossy on top, but delicious!

This was possibly the worst recipe that I have ever tried.  It was not to our liking at all.
