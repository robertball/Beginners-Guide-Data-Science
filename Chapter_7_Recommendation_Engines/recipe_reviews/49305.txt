I made this recipe tonight for supper as a sauce for some pulled pork sandwiches but made one change.  I was not sure what brown sauce was and neither was the other person who left a review but I did notice that they said it was very vinegary and added more brown sugar to sweeten it up.  Well, for my brown sauce interpretation, I substituted molasses in the same amount called for of the brown sauce and it was FANTASTIC!!  My husband and son who are both very picky about their BBQ sauce both said it tasted very similar to the sauce used at one of our favorite BBQ hot spot restaurants.

Great sauce for last minute need, or even for a planned sauce!  I ended up using more brown sugar (about 4tbs) to take the sharp tangy edge off.  I love tang, but it was it was sharp on vinegar flavor until I added more brown sugar.  Unless the brown sauce I used was different from what was suggested.  I used HP sauce, which is what I believe is brown sauce. Overall a great and easy sauce.

Prepared this to make BBQ pork sandwiches.  Really good...sweet and tangy.  After reading some of the other reviews I did decrease the amount of white vinegar to 1/8 cup and added just a dash of ground red pepper.  Excellent taste and super easy.

This seems really easy but...What is brown sauce? I increased to 1/2 cup brown sugar and added about 1/4 cup of prepared bbq sauce (weird since the point was to make bbq sauce but I'll put it into the same category as making yogurt--you need yogurt to make yogurt).  I also didn't have dry mustard so I put in about a tablespoon of yellow mustard.  I eliminated worcestershire sauce because I was out but I think I would use it next time.  It turned out sweet and tangy.

This sauce turned out great!  I too made a few changes. Limited white vinegar to 1/8 cup, add garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne powder, and some liquid smoke.  I did not have any lemon juice or dry mustard on hand, but I am sure they would have made the sauce even better.  Also, I did increase the brown sugar, as recommended by others.  Wonderful recipe, Thank you!!

Not bad for a quick BBQ sauce...  I cut the recipe in half and used 2 Tbsp. of browning sauce and 2 Tbsp. of molasses.  It is definitely tangy so I added a little more brown sugar.  Since I felt it needed a little "something", I also added a little liquid smoke along with some onion and garlic powders.

Lovely sauce, I too used molases as I had no brown sauce. Would say it was a bit vinegary in taste so next time I would cut back on this ingredient. I also did not have mustard powder so used some French's mustard and it work pretty well.

This is a wonderful quick and easy sauce. Brown Sauce is an english ketchup-like sauce. I think its similar to brown sauce by Heinz. It's a litte too much vinegar, so I will try with the molasses the next time.

This doesn't really taste like BBQ sauce, it's very tangy.  I only used about 1/2 the balsamic vinegar and it's still vinegary.  I added a 3oz can of tomato paste, that helped a little but we won't be using this recipe again.

I love this sauce! The first time I made it I added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Oops! It still turned out amazing. I didn't use the brown sauce or add anything else.

This is a good base for a BBQ sauce.  I found it to be too tangy & too sweet.  I added quite a few things to it. Just to make it to my family style.    I added fresh minced garlic, cracked black pepper, a little bit of coffee, a splash of red wine, a squeeze of grape jelly (I know! But it is good!) and a package of Lipton's Mushroom Onion soup mix.  It toned it down and gave it a little more depth. While these flavors would seem to overwhelm and be crazy they come together nicely.  Thanks for a great base!

I also decreased the vinegar to 1/8 cup but it was still a bit tangy for my taste. My husband loved it. It was very fast.

this is sooo good!! (if you dont have brown sauce, use 1/4 cup water and 2 tablespoons gravy master) that works too!!  I tenderized a rib eye steak with a little olive oil and sea salt then grilled it for a little bit on each side then poured this marinade over the steaks and grilled on med-low for a while 
(keep checking, as too not overcook)  Excellent bbq sauce!!!!

This was a great BBQ sauce on my oven baked pork ribs. It thickened up nicely...however, although I love vineger, it was still a bit much even after adding 1/4 cup of brown sugar. So the next time I made it I switched the measurements of worchestershire and brown  sugar, but didn't change anything else. It was much nicer. Thanks.

I can't try this yet because I have no "brown" sauce.  According to Wikepedia brown sauce is also made by Heinz as HP sauce and is similar to steak sauce and is available at Amazon  I can't rate this honestly because of the unavailability in US markets as far as I know.  I am ordering some HP sauce with the other stuff I am ordering for Christmas baking.

See I always though that a brown sauce was 1 part  flower 1 part butter. That makes a roux or something like that any who cook it till it's brown then slowly mix in your beef stock if you mix in to much and want it to be thicker then you need to cook it down aka don't add no more beef stock.  So yell try that out

I could not find for sure what brown sauce was and I am not familar with HP sauce so I just whiped up some white sauce and we had spagetti.
