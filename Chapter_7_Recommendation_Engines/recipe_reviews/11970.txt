This wasextremely easy and really good  with just a few changes.  I use two cans of chicken breast, a can of sliced mushrooms, and two jars of light alfredo sauce.  I put a little olive oil in the pan, add some garlic, fry it a little, add the chicken and mushrooms, spice it up with salt, pepper, basil leaves, and some Emeril's Italian Essence, and heat it through.  Then I add the sauce and simmer.  I use angel hair pasta,only half a pound, and after I add the pasta to the boiling water I blanch a cup or two of fresh broccoli for just a minute and add it to the pan with the sauce. That's it! My family loves it and it only takes about 15 or 20 minutes.  Very tasty!

This recipe is everything it claimed to be...quick, easy and yummy, too! My husband and his friend and I really liked it. My kids wouldn't even touch it which doesn't mean much being that they are picky eaters anyway! I will definately make this one again.

Used bow tie pasta and added fresh minced garlic, seasoning salt, poultry seasoning (on the chicken breasts) sliced mushrooms and topped with parmesan cheese. Left out the vegetables. Easy when you need a quick meal.

Great recipe...the hardest part was cooking the chicken, which tells you something.

I substituted fresh vegetables and mushrooms, and it turned out better than when I did it with the frozen vegetables, but that's just a suggestion.

Please note that this recipe yields what I would consider five large portions, which I could hardly finish, after adding some toast as a side.

We really liked this recipe but I would be careful about the type of vegetables used.  I used a california blend but I wished I would have only used broccoli.  Otherwise this was easy and very good leftover as well.

I scaled this up X5 to feed 20 people....After 3 lbs pasta, there was enough to feed an army.  I didn't add the remining pasta because it would have been way too much and I don't think there was enough sauce (5 jars) to cover that much pasta.  I got rave revews and people ate a bunch, but there was still alot left over.  With a salad and side dish the original recipe easily would feed 6-8, not 4.

Really good and really easy.  I added fresh mushrooms that I had sauted in butter and fresh broccoli instead of the canned and frozen stuff.  My boyfriend loved it and I will definitely be making this again.

Easy. A jar of store bought sauce, some chicken, a box of fettuccini, and fresh broccoli florets. Kids gobbled it up.

I have a very busy schedule with a husband and 3 kids. This recipe was an ultimate EASY recipe. It was fast simple, and best of all the kids and everyone asked for seconds. This is the best recipe. VERY GOOD. I did however make a little adjustments to it. I added fresh steamed broccoli, minced garlic, chicken seasoning. It was great!!!

This was just what I was looking for!  I found someone who used canned chicken, which is what I had on hand.  I also only had canned corn and canned mushrooms for veggies, added those and one can each of chicken and alfredo sauce.  I sauteed garlic and about one half onion in olive oil, added the canned chicken, then the mushrooms, corn and sauce, sprinkled a little additional garlic powder and onion powder, it is just heavenly!  Made it up in about 15 minutes and served over curly noodles, the only pasta I had in the house.  Very good!

Very good basic recipe.  In prepping the chicken I seared a couple of boneless/skinless breasts in EVOO with some Italian seasoning, then let them cool and diced them up.  Rather than using frozen mixed veggies I used the same size package of broccoli florets.  My only complaint is that I found the recipe straight up to be too "chunky" in that there was too much stuff in the sauce and not enough actual sauce.  To fix that I recommend either holding back some of the veggies or adding more sauce.  I made the full recipe and as a single guy I'm happy to have leftovers for the rest of the week.

Very easy, but kind of bland. I think adding more seasoning - maybe garlic, basil, oregano - would improve the flavor.

I did this almost exactly 'cept for the vegs, and I added McCormick Italian Seasoning to the chicken.  It was very good.  It's a keeper for those evenings where there isn't time to make a scratch sauce.

Boil water and cook pasta. Open a jar of Alfredo sauce. Add some prepared veggies. Cut with milk without adding additional parmesan, romano, or other cheese. Brilliant "recipe!" Please check out my "recipe" for an easy breakfast--Corn Flakes with milk (beware...you will need a bowl and a spoon; a plate and fork will not work well) Please give my recipe 5-stars!

Easy and delicious! I used chopped broccoli instead of mixed veggies and added some creole seasoning, 2 tablespoons of butter and 8 oz shredded medium cheddar cheese. This will definitely be repeated in my home. Love it!

Great! My hubby Loved it! I let my hubby season the chicken so we used fresh skinless, boneless chicken breast. It gave it a great flavor!

I rate this a four souly on the taste of the meal.  Very tasty with a tomato pesto alfredo sauce.  Throw in the low cost and easy prep, this is easily a five star recipe.

It was ok. I'm not a big alfredo fan, but my friend's are. They said it was just ok...some said bland. The odd thing was the way my picker eater ate it up...who woulda thought I would be adding this to one of the four meals he'll eat? Not a hopeless recipe, probably easy to jazz it up.

I will never understand why a dish consisting of a combination of prepared ingredients (e.g. canned alfredo sauce) appears as a "recipe". A recipe site should teach how to "make" things, not merely combine them from commercially prepared components.

Please use fresh veg and mushrooms!!!!~ Canned mushrooms are awful. The recipe as is ...is ok for a last minute pantry dinner. Not in any way real chic alfredo.

Good and fast. Out of necessity, substituted canned chicken and frozen italian cut green beans. Beans not the greatest. Think peas would be better but.... Overal it was very tasty and If your going low carb, just have the topping and leave out noodles. Very low carb that way.

Very easy to make.  The only minor change I made was to use 3 chicken breasts vs 2.  The next time I may add shrimp.  I added frozen broccoli.  This was a hit in my household.  It yielded more than 4 servings.

followed the recipe to a new fault (only used more Alfredo and milk).  the only thing i would change is making a from scratch Alfredo and using fresh veggies.  besides that, both me and my boyfriend liked it and have left overs for lunch the next day.

This recipe was VERY good and so easy to make.  I sauteed the mushrooms when cooking the chicken and I really think that the seasonings I used on the chicken, had A LOT to do with the flavorful pasta.  Used linguine and at the end mixed it all together.  Will be making again!

SO GOOD!!! I had a huge, leftover, baked chicken breast & about a 1/2 pound of leftover, cooked rigatoni. I added 2 handfuls of frozen 'classic mixed vegetables' (peas, carrots, corn & green beans). I omitted the mushrooms at my wife's request (& my disappointment). As it turned out, the mushrooms would have been lost in the flavors of the other veggies anyway. We added some black pepper & Parmesan at the table. It was awesome! I can't wait for the leftovers!!!

I cubed two raw skinless boneless chicken breast halves and cooked them in a wok. Just two of us so I only boiled 5 ounces pasta and only 5 ounces frozen vegetables When chicken was cooked I added the rest of the ingredients and simmered for about 15 minutes until the vegetables were tender crisp. Both of us like it, it's a keeper. Next time I might use cooked rotini and mix it in the wok with the rest of the ingredients.

Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I liked this recipe. It's labeled Easy for a reason. If you want a challenging one, then look for one. No need to be rude when you never bothered to make it.
That said, I made it as written except I forgot to buy the mushrooms. I will next time. I chose to use peas & carrots for the mixed veggies. Yes it's easy, but I like easy recipes that don't have a lot of ingredients. Personal preference. 
I will say that adding some garlic powder & grated parmesan cheese to the sauce as well as maybe seasoning the chicken somehow would give it more flavor.  I'll make it again.

I used fresh mushrooms and made my own Alfredo Sauce (Allrecipes 'Alfredo Sauce' recipe) as I can't have dairy and switched to spinach linguine. My husband wants me to keep this recipe in the frig for bi-weekly meals.

So quick, easy, and delicious.   I use red and yellow peppers for my vegetables and omit the mushrooms.  Great dish either way.

I made this and it was delicious but I used fresh baby bella mushrooms and some fresh broccoli. Easy, healthy and quick... Also you can use cooked shrimp.

I will make this again, it was very good. Only thing I would change for next time is to use a bit more sauce. My pasta wasn't dry at all though, i just personally would like to add more. I also added shredded Parmesan cheese and mixed it throughout, then I added graded Parmesan cheese to the pasta (I did not mix the graded cheese). Then i put the pasta in the oven (on 400 degrees) for about 7 minutes just allowing the cheese to melt. I think the extra cheese added more flavor to the pasta.

This was pretty good and great for a week night dinner! I added 3 cloves of crushed garlic and a side of French bread.
