This recipe makes an awesome cake! The first time I made this, I followed the directions exactly. The cake got great reviews from friends & family. The next time I made it though, I melted one 2 ounce square of chocolate and blended it in the mix - YUM! It's even better now (especially topped with cream cheese icing)!
