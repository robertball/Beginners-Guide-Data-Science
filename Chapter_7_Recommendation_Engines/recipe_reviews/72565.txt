Well, I only had half of the fresh dill the recipe called for and thought I could make it up with dried dill. It was still tasty but would have been 10 times more so with the full amount of fresh as called for in the recipe. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think some butter is an absolute must in this dish. Other than that, it would be perfect!

this has an awesome flavour!!  I must add that you can NOT use dried dill...at least that was my mistake....the colour turned just gross!!  But, the taste remained really good.  So, stick with fresh dill and you will not be disappointed.

Not bad! I love all creamy stuff and I'm a potato lover,  but the rest of the family said it seemed too fatty to taste. I would not recommend this to anyone who is concerned about their cholesterol! Next time I'd go with 10% cream and cut that in half adding milk and yogourt for the rest, using less liquid accordingly. Otherwise the recipe is good. Just three stars because of the quart of heavy cream!

I took these to a potluck and everyone loved them.  A few changes I made was using 1/2 the amt of cream and adding some extra garlic for more flavor!  Wonderful recipe!

I likes this but would make some changes next time. I didn't read the reviews first and now would agree to used maybe 1 pt of cream for the 2 lbs of potatoes. I used per recipe and really cooked down for about 40 minutes (at least double time). the sauce thicken up a good amount and the recipe was very tasty. I also (becuase of what I had in the garden) used about 2/3 cup chopped dill and 1/3 cup chopped fresh chives. Good alternative. I will make these again because the idea is yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

Unfortunately these didn't work for me.  I would use less cream and more potatoes.

There are some steps missing in this. I wasn't sure if the potatoes should be mashed or not. Also, 1 qt of heavy cream is WAY to much. I basically made soup with this recipe. I would say cut down to 1 pt or even 1/2 pt of heavy cream, then mash. I used dry dill, and it was fine. Otherwise it tastes good. I did through in some parsley and butter.

Delicious if you like dill, which I do. Follow recipe as is and you can't go wrong.

Used 10% cream and it was tasty! I think next time I would add more sautéed onions. I sautéed mine with some butter until caramelized and it definitely added good flavour. Will make it again!
