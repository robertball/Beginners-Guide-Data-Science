Good base recipe. I always have issues with having rice come out cooked when I add it raw to casseroles. I used about a cup and a half of cooked rice from a couple nights before. I sauteed one onion, garlic and about a cup of shredded carrots and added that for a little more flavor, threw in about a cup of shredded white cheddar and sprinkled a bit on top before baking it long enough to warm all the way through and melt the cheese. I served the hot sauce on the side as I have two kids and they can't stomach super hot food. My kids and I liked this, my husband is on the fence. I think the whole amount of mayo is a little too rich, next time I might do half sour cream or yogurt. Like I said, good base recipe and a nice change from your typical tuna casserole. I'd make this again. GREAT way to use up your leftover rice from dinner the night before or from your chinese food order.

This was good and easy. I followed the advice of the reviewers and used half the amount of mayo. I added a little plain yogurt. I would make this again. I like the addition of the jalapeno

I used cream of chicken soup because I don't like mushrooms and sour cream because I don't like mayonnaise.  Other than that, I made this just as written.  It is completely different from any other tuna casserole I've ever had, so if you're looking for something new, this is a great recipe to try.  It was easy to make and cheap.

Simply delish! I messed with the quantities   of the ingrediants (double rice and tuna, not of the mayo or soup though) but it came out delish. I also used cream of broccoli instead, and instead of jalepeno or hot sauce, put some medium level salsa into it. Came out great!

We enjoyed this meal very much and the hot sauce gave it a real edge.
It was a bit mushy - possibly because I covered it while baking. We're curious to try it with pasta instead of rice. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was looking for a recipe for ingredients I already had on had.  This fit the bill perfectly.  My changes:  I sauteed onion, garlic, and a mildly hot pepper.  Together with a half can of pees, I added that to the mix.  Also, I used Bird's Eye frozen brown rice steamed in the microwave (saves the step on cooking rice).  I sprinkled on hot pepper flakes because we aren't shy about spicy hot foods.    My husband is not too keen on casseroles, but he really enjoyed this!  It is definitely a keeper.  The recipe was not mushy at all.  It might be because of the brown rice, which holds up a little better than white rice.  It also is more nutritional.  Since I am wheat intolerant, this is a fantastic substitute for the regular old tuna casserole.

pretty good. I found the whole jar of mayonaise seemed a bit much. So I only used 1/4 cup. 1 can of tuna. Triple the rice. Excellent spicy flavor. Even the baby ate some!

Easy.  Good to make in quantity. Very tasty to pile chilled leftovers onto a bowl of mesclun, radishes and tomatoes.

This is ok. It would be better with half of the hot sauce. I used Tapatio so that might effect the spice level. But, I love spicy and this was barely edible. I was practically sweating eating this.

Found this recipe accidentally, but couldn't resist the name :)  Figured what the heck, made it one night and wow! easy and a nice change from elbows or pasta.  The jalapeno is a great enhancer that I simply would never have thought of, but thanks!!  (Unfortunately, my husband wouldn't let me even allow our felines to taste test!)

I have to say, this had a good flavor but the consistency of cat food. I even reduced the mayo by half and did not cover while baking and it still came out mushy. Next time I would add at least twice the rice, if not more. I used brown rice and sprinkled some cheddar on top. The first bite wasn't so bad but neither my husband nor I could eat a lot more than that due to the gross consistency. I also used Tapatio sauce and left out the jalapeño. I like moderately spicy food and that was just about right. Will try again with massive modifications.

taste OK, but color and texture were unappealing.

This was a good alternative to tuna noodle casserole.  The changes I made was to substitute the jalapeno with a small can of green chilies and used just 1 T of hot sauce because we don't like things too hot.  I hope you don't mind but I think of  this as "Cat Scratch Fever Casserole"...lol, can't get that tune out of my mind now.

I made this with just a few changes. Omitted the Jalapeño and decreased the hot sauce (Louisiana,) to 2 tablespoons. I added a small onion, half rib of celery and green bell pepper, all chopped as well as a half package of frozen peas. Also used plenty of ground pepper and parsley on top. Baked uncovered. It turned out delicious and comforting. Was not mushy with the addition of the veggies. Will make again often!

Yes I would make this again.  I had to make it in a fry pan, and it still turned out to be a dish with a lot of flavor.  I cannot wait to fix my oven, so I can make a casserole.

Just started a Paleo diet, so this was a GREAT find! Simple to make and it can be frozen for future dinners!
