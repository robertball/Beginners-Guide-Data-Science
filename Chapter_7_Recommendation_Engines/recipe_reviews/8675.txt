Bonnie,  I certainly intend to try this recipe, but in the meanwhile...would you happen to be the daughter of Herbert and Merlyn O'Neill from LA?

I did this recipe a little differently.  I tossed the chicken cubes in cajon seasoning, then blackened them in a hot (like heating up for about 10 minutes) pan.  They cooked quickly because of being cubes so I took them out and put in the veggies to saute a little (10 minutes) before adding the white wine and chicken back in.  I left it on med. high to high so it would cook down, then after about 15 minutes added in a little cornstarch I had mixed with water so it would be more saucy.  I put the tomatos (only two romas) and parsley in last minute and cooked for another 3 minutes with the lid on.  The dish was spicy, full of flavor, and a complete meal when served over rice.  It's easy too -gotta love that.

My husband and I thought this recipe was nothing to write home about...kind of bland even though we followed the recipe to the letter.

Fantastic--we can't wait for the leftovers.  It's a filling and tasty meal that's probably safe for any palate.  Instead of using olive oil in the pan, we just cooked the chicken in the Italian dressing it was marinating in (Paul Newman's).  More specifics are we didn't use blackening spice.  Instead we used Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning and our white wine was Prosecco.  Also used red and orange bell peppers (it's a prettier dish that way).  Don't put parmesan on top and I could deal without the tomatoes as they just become lukewarm and mushy on top.  Great dish.

I made this a few days ago and really liked it.  The flavors from the peppers and the white wine really took over the dish.  I will make this again.  Prep time was a bit but the cook time wasn't bad.  Make sure you have a LARGE skillet when preparing.

My husband LOVED this!  Only I used spicy sapphron yellow rice instead of linguini, just to boost the "Cajun" touch.  I'm sure regular saffron yellow rice works well, too, if you don't like spicy.  All in all, this makes great leftovers, too!

This turned out wonderful! It was very easy to make and made great leftovers. I used Tony Cachere's cajun season, and sherry for the wine. I also used angel hair pasta instead of linguine. 5 stars and we'll definitely be making this again!

This tastes just like one of my favorite dishes at The Olive Garden.  I loved the sauce, my only diappointment, I wish I had more.  My chicken dried out a little, so next time I will leave the chicken in larger pieces and believe me, there will be a next time.

This was okay.  Not that it tasted bad and it WAS really fast and easy but there just wasn't much to it.  I added some extra cajun seasoning and served over rice pilaf. Good but it just didn't wow me like I hoped.

i made this for extended family tonight and everyone seemed to really like it.  as others have suggested, i just cooked the chicken in the italian dressing marinade to keep some of that flavor, which i think came through really nicely in the finished dish.  a few people thought it was too spicy, but i think they were just a little wimpy :)

I really liked this!  Not sure why other reviews said not much flavor - I think you really need a good cajun spice, and good italian dressing... oh, and I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh b/c I like pasta a little saucier than not.

My husband just took the leftovers out of the fridge and said "honey, what IS this?  It's delicious - so good!"  It was a wonderful dish enjoyed by my husband and 3 of my 4 kids (only because my daughter is now a self-proclaimed vegetarian who doesn't like veggies - can anyone help with this!??).  Wonderful across the board and, apparently, even better the next day!  Thank you for sharing.

I enjoy this recipe but the version that I make includes a couple of changes.  I don't care for mushrooms so I substitute fresh broccoli and I don't use linguini.  I find that penne pasta works pretty well.  Very tasty!

Absolutely delicious!!! My whole family loved every bite. 
I used rice instead of linguini but either way it was superb. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for something great for dinner!!!

Very good!  I tossed this with some linguine and added only some extra mushrooms. It was even better the next day when the flavors mellowed.

This was a great family meal.  I took the advice from another review a tripled the cajun seasoning to 2 tbsp (I used McCormick Cajun Seasoning).  I put this together at the last minute, and so I substituted 2 cans of mushrooms and frozen stirfry veggies for the fresh mushrooms, bell peppers and onion.  The only criticism was that the chicken was a little over-cooked.  Next time I'll use boneless chicken thighs in place of the breasts, and may add shrimp and andouille sausage to dress it up.

Delicious! I left out the mushrooms and upped the peppers, but pretty much left the rest of it the same. The only thing I wish I had done differently was use my large electric skillet because my pan on the stove was very, very full. Ate this over spaghetti noodles.

This was fit to be eaten by my family, but nothing to make for guests- to show off a fabulous dish. I am glad I tried the recipe to provide a meal for a night, but it will never be made again in my house.

I enjoyed this recipe.  It was fun to make and the whole house smelled fabulous.  However, no one pressed me for the recipe or asked when I would make it next.  I would say it is a nice change from the usual but an average dish.

This was tasty, but I thought it needed far more spices than the recipe called far. I was only able to find one Cajun Seasoning mix at the store, so perhaps mine was too tame. I added zucchini to this, but that was the only change I made, aside from reducing the olive oil. I'll try this again, but with some spice changes.

This recipe is great, my husband LOVES it. It has a great balanced taste and is really simple to make. The only change I made to this recipe was adding 3 times as much cajun seasoning as it called for, the  two teaspoons just isn't enough.

This was very good, but based upon the reviews I expected more.  For standard every night fare it was fine, but I would not serve it to guests.

I found this easy and quite tasty...not dry at all.  Instead of using cajun spice I used a fajita seasoning pretty liberally.  It turned out well and is likely to be used again.

Was pretty good, nothing special in my books. Apparently a lot of people thought this was a quick recipe. I found it took a lot of preparation time (lots of veggies to chop!).
