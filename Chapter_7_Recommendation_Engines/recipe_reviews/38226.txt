The licorice flavor of the anise is different and good in this recipe. I leave skins on potatoes when making potato salad.  I will be making this again, and maybe increasing the anise seed to 1 tsp.!

I love anything anise!  Thanks for the recipe Domenica.  I buy so many cookbooks and have so many appliances but I always go right back to my gramma's recipes.....a pinch, a handful, a bunch of....no measuring cups or spoons!  Maybe one day soon I'll chuck it all and enjoy the simple pleasures & treasures of a lost art....gramma's cooking!!

Its really good, I thought by adding thinly sliced fennel root to accent anise seed flavor would be good ,  it was!  Thanks for the recipe,  its a nice change from reg. (My mom's) they're both good. Your "mom's" is very simular to my mom's.
