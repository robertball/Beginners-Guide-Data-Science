My mother in law makes a similar cookie using Ritz crackers. It's crazy how similar they taste to real butterfingers... The actual hands-on time is so fast you might want to make a double batch! These are a staple at our house around the holidays. Thanks for posting!

These were yummy but not what I was hoping for. We thought they tasted more like a peanut butter cup. I think they would be better with crunchy PB instead of the creamy.
