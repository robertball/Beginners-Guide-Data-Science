This is a great option for kids! And big kids too! The bouillon gives it a nice quality. I sprinkled it on my bone-in skin-on chicken breasts but I wish I had rubbed it under the skin also. This would be great on chicken tenders or chicken fingers. It lets the imagination run wild about what else could be added. Thanks D Smith!
