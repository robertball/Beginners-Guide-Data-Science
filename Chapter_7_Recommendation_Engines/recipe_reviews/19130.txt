Very tasty, fresh, and light.  Different spin to a chicken recipe.  I would not recommend this if you do not like olives, or an overall more sour type taste, but if you do then you should definitely try this recipe.  I make chicken pretty often and this was one which stands out from the rest.  The taste of this is not what you would generally encounter w/ most chicken recipes.  Boneless chicken will not work with this; have to use bone in cuts.  The skin gives it a lot of the flavor because the sauce seems to attach itself particularily to the skin, and falls into the crevices of where the bones are.  When I was making this I thought 2 jars of artichokes were too much, however I still used the 2 and it was just enough (an extra jar on top of that wouldn't hurt either).  As I've done many times in different recipes I substituted Vermouth for the wine because it is extra dry and as a result adds more flavor.  I substituted the canned olives for premium natural organic olives from a glass jar.  I find they have more taste and are generally healthier. A

Make sure to rinse olives and artichokes.  Add lots of capers and 4 to 6 cloves of fresh crushed garlic, double the chicken broth, change the wine to 2/3 a cup and add a little extra tarragon and this is awesome.  Once done, take the remaining liquid, add a little cornstarch and thicken to taste.  Serve on the side with plain white rice.

I love this! I have a huge round baking dish that's quite unusual and I like to make this in that and put it in the center of the table when it's done.  Guests find it pretty impressive looking, and very delicious.  I adapt it to a smaller dish when it's just the two of us. I also love the suggestions people have, like sprinkling it with feta..or substituting rosemary or oregano.  I don't understand when people say they didn't like something when it's so easy to alter recipes to suit your own taste! Use your imagination and have fun, is what I say.

Followed some of the other suggestions.  I used 3 chicken breasts and 4 legs , 1 jar of artichokes and 1/2 can (15 oz) sliced olives.  I added capers, 3 cloves of garlic and instead of tarragon, I used fresh basil and rosemary.  Sauce was great but meat was a little dry.  Next time I will use boneless breasts and cook for 30 minutes.

Artichokes, olives and sauce were great over rice.

With a few alterations, this recipe turned out wonderful.  I cooked only 3 chicken breasts in 1/2 cup of wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic finely chopped and diced tomatoes on top.  I cooked fresh artichoke and removed the artichoke hearts myself for a fresh taste (this can take away from the easiness of the recipe, however...).  Then I chose to leave out the tarragon.  Served with fresh salad and wild rice, this recipe turned out great!  It probably would taste even better with capers.

Sorry, I hate to write a 2-star review, but my husband and I just didn't care for this. My mouth was watering thinking about making this, but even after kicking it up a bit with parmesan cheese and extra herbs (rosemary, basil) and plating it over angel hair pasta, the flavor didn't thrill me. I only had skinless, boneless chicken breasts on hand and quickly browned them prior to putting it all in the oven as I'm not a big fan of poached chicken, but they were dry after only half the amount of cooking time suggested (baked 1/2 hour). I'm sure bone-in and skin-on chicken would improve the chicken flavor/texture, but not necessarily the rest of the sauce. Mind you, it wasn't bad, just wasn't one I'd make again.

My husband and son request this.  It is very simple and yummy.  It is much better with chicken thighs though.  I tried breasts once which turned out dry. Great with angelhair pasta.

This is a very good dish and easy to make!  I made it for company and they loved it.  When I make it again for my family, though, I'm going to spice it up a bit.  Substituting greek olives for plain black ones would be good.  Also, adding paprika or red pepper flakes.  I used boneless chicken breasts and it turned out fine, just cooked it about 35-40 minutes.

Oh my gosh I love this recipe! The only thing I changed was the exclusion of the white wine ('cause I didn't have any and I really didn't think Capt Morgan's would be a good substitute)..I used a very good vegetable broth instead, I also added capers per another reviewer's suggestion. I couldn't believe how amazingly delicious this dish was. I'm happy of course that my husband agreed but honestly I liked it so much his opinion was merely an addendum.  I saved the left over sauce to put over rice,I just couldn't bring myself to throw any of this food away. When I make this dish next week I'm going to change the canned black olives to kalamata olives. I think they'll add a fuller flavor to this otherwise magnificent chicken dinner.

I've been meaning to send a review for this wonderful recipe now for a couple years.  That's how long I've been demanded to make it.  It's one of our family favorites.  This is the most delicious dish and unbelievably easy.  I thank you for your great recipe!! :)

I was a little apprehensive about cooking this dish because I wasn't sure if my husband would enjoy it since I am the one who loves olives and artichokes,  but the both of us truly enjoyed this dish, instead of whole olives, I used chopped up olives instead.  I think the next time, I will also use more wine and chicken stock so that we have more sauce to eat with the rice I serves along with this dish.  Really good and worth trying if you love the sour like flavors of artichokes and olives.

My dinner guests loved this recipe.  I added too much liquid my mistake as I doubled the recipe but it was still delicious.  I also added green olives and capers. It was very easy to assemble just before the guest arrived and looked as if I had worked on it all day.

This was a great and very tastey dish.  Other reviewer's comments were also very helpful.  I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic, dried rosemary and garlic powder. I also used chicken breast and it really came out wonderful. 
Thank you :)

This was a very tasty recipe!  I used boneless chicken breasts and still got great results.  I followed the advice of others who rated the recipe and sliced the olives and added minced garlic to the recipe.  This will be a recipe I'll use again.

I normally love artichokes and black olives, but this recipe was lacking something...not sure what. I think using an entire can of black olives is too much. Perhaps only half and sliced would be better. The artichokes taste wonderful with the chicken, but this recipe wasn't as great as I was expecting.

This was a really great dish and extremely easy and quick to make.  I have a baby who
only naps for 15 minutes at a time and I mananged to get it together while he was sleeping.
I only needed 4 boneless chix breasts and cut the rest of the recipe in half and it came
out great-very juicy.

It needs something.  The tarragon just doesn't go with the rest of the flavors--maybe fresh thyme or rosemary would be better.  The olives and artichoke hearts were good, but they didn't really give much flavor to the chicken.  If I made this again, I would add more herbs, maybe some mushrooms and capers--or better yet just try a different recipe!  I should mention that my husband really liked it.

Not for us ever again. Used skinless, boneless chicken breasts and maybe that was the thing. Skin would have added some flavor as well as some color to this dish. It just wasn't very appealing. Added garlic, rosemary etc. as well.

Artiochoke and ripe olive fans can't go wrong with this one. To avoid dryness, double broth amt; cover with foil, bake 30 min, then removed foil and bake a final 40 min. Use free-range chicken if precticable. We substituted thighs for more expensive breasts and it was perfect

My friend and I cooked this at my graduate school co-op for 20 people, and everybody raved about it!  Now they want us to cook for every meal, even though we're supposed to take turns!
P.S. We substituted thighs for breasts and added diced TOMOTOES & capers for color & flavor.  Yum!

We loved this!  All I had was boneless chicken breasts and just kept checking on them so they didn't over cook.  Had some fresh rosemary, sage and thyme, added garlic....mmmmmm.  I put foil on top cause we love sauce over rice.  The meat was very, very tender.

I used boneless chicken breasts, but I think next time I'll use bone in breasts.  I subbed the fresh tarragon with fresh rosemary and sage.  It was absolutely delicious!

A pleasant surprise!! Used marjoram and oregano in place of tarragon.  Also added half a teaspoon of garlic to wine/broth mixture before pouring over chicken.  The Hubs liked too!!

This is a winner! Very easy to make and tasty, but it is NOT a low-fat dish. 
The chicken definitely must be with skin and bone-in. Thighs and drumsticks work best. I did not use chicken broth  - just 1 cup of white wine. Added 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh rosemary (dry one works as well) and freshly ground pepper plus a dash of paprika for stronger flavor. Chicken had too much juice after 1 hour of cooking time - I drained the juice, flipped pieces to the other side and baked 10-15 more minutes at 500 F. This way the soggy side of the chicken formed a little darker and crispier layer. Yum!!!

Although this smelled great while in the oven, this was just too bland for our family.

This meal was quite tasty and easy. Instead of 1/2 of cup of wine and broth I made it one full cup of both. I made it with 6 chicken breasts. I only have white meat eatters. Everyone loved it. We used to juice to pour over rice. yummmmmmmyyyy

This was a hit at our Christmas pot luck.  We used all chicken drumsticks.  Also used a little more white wine than called for just to use up a bottle.  Everyone was calling it Mediterranean chicken.  Thanks!

I loved this dish and appreciated the hints and changes suggested. I did as someone had said and added extra wine and water, capers, diced tomatoes and threw in some parmesan cheese. I'm a southern cook so changing it up a bit was no problem. Thanks so much! It was a winner!

Since I was out of dry white wine and tarragon I had to substitute a semi-sweet white wine and basil/marjoram, but otherwise made the recipe as noted.  It was very good, though next time I'll use a large can of artichoke hearts as we all love them.  Very nice tang to the sauce, and the chicken was nicely tender.

This is a staple recipe in our house.  I love the combination of the artichoke hearts and olives together.  I use marinated hearts for a little added flavor, otherwise I pretty much follow the recipe.  Comes out tender and juicy.

I substituted boneless chicken thighs for the breast because breasts always dry out in the oven.  Also used canned quartered artichokes, not the marinated kind.  Plus pitted Calamata instead of canned black which are not good for cooking.  Tasty Mediterranean dish.

We really liked this one, a definite keeper!  I think next time, though, I might thicken the sauce with cornstartch and pour over it when on the plate.  Also, might add a bit of garlic powder and mushrooms.  Very good as is though!

I thought it was good but husband said the chicken was dry.  I loved the black olives and tarragon,etc. but not sure I liked the canned artichoke hearts.  The canned chokes seemed to take away from the freshness of everything else.  Wonder if sliced fresh leeks would be better?  I don't mean to be critical because we ate ALL of it.  :)

I made this for my boyfriend and we absolutely loved it! Definitely use dark meat chicken-so much juicier than breasts. I added some red peppers to the baking dish and added the artichoke marinade to the broth/wine mixture.  I added this to some pasta and threw in a small amount of flour to thicken the sauce.

6 drumsticks and 4 breasts is waaaay too much for 4 people-A meat serving should be the size of a deck of cards.  For 2 people, I used 1 boneless breast and cut all ingredients in 1/2.  I also added 1 tbl. tomato paste (which thickens the sauce a bit), 1/2 can of corn, 1/2 chopped onion, a bit more garlic, and substituted tarragon with basil.  It was pretty good, served over steamed rice.  I also cooked it for 25 minutes and it was perfect (though I prefer drier meat-for juicier meat, use bone-in breast)

LOVED THIS ONE!  The whole family ate every last bite and had been bugging me to make this again - I substituted boneless, skinless chicken breast and added an extra few tsp's of olive oil, but otherwise kept to this recipe.  No one thought it would taste good, but these flavors combined are very good.  Always looking for that 'new' chicken dish to liven things up, and this one was a total success!

Good. Not oh my good, but solid and good. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts so I decreased the cooking time to make sure they didnt dry out. I also subbed the kalamata olives for the black as it gives it much more flavor. I had some sliced portabello mushrooms left over from another dish and threw those in the pan as well. Really great "throw together" dinner with no prep. Will come back for more for quick weeknight eats.

Used with Kalamata olives this is really good. I used Beringer's White Zin for the wine in the dish and served it with this wine as I am not a huge white wine drinker. Also served with fresh green beans and sourdough rolls. Simple and elegant!

This chicken was great, very flavorful. I thickened the sauce a bit with flour, and made sure to place the artichokes and olives ON the chicken, not AROUND the chicken as stated in the recipe. This helped the flavor really sink in. I didn't have tarragon, so I used a mix of Herbes de Provence along with basil, oregano, and a bit of garlic salt. It was very flavorful!

I thought this recipe was really good.  The key to deciding whether or not this recipe is for you is by making sure you like artichokes and tangy tasting recipes.  I added additional olives b/c we LOVE them, and I didn't use chicken breasts, only legs.  I would certainly make this recipe again.

I thought this recipe was delicious! I used the advice of others and used garlic powder, basil and tarragon generously. I also used more artichokes and olives, and served with mushroom risotto. I did need to crank up the heat to 500 degrees for the last 10-15m. Yummy!

This recipe is wonderful!  I have never eaten artichokes before and they are great in this dish. The recipe is so easy and quick.  I will make it a lot...I recommend it to everybody..

I got this recipe last week and made it twice already.  It was just what I was looking for.  I made it with chicken thighs.  My husband who is a picky "steak & potato" kind of guy actually liked it.

This recipe is very easy to make and tastes great.  I would recommend rinsing the olives prior to adding them.  I made the mistake of prepping the dish and having it sit in the refrigerator for and hour prior to baking which turned the chicken a grey color.

Something good for a change.  I also added some toasted sesame seeds and fresh lemon juice to the top of the chicken.

This was really good and simple to prepare, it's also a good base to make additions to based on what's in the refrigerator. I added some extra mushrooms I had on hand. I also created a thicker sauce by removing the chicken and adding some flour to the remaining juices and a little sour cream. I put the chicken back in the dish then topped with some extra feta I had and broiled until it melted. I served this with rice and Caesar salad.

This dish is really a 3 1/2 stars for us.  I gave it a four instead of a 3 because there's nothing offensive about it.  It just isn't the most memorable dish.  My husband and I liked it, but both agreed that we wouldn't miss it if it weren't on our regular menu.  My 9 year old, however, thanked me many times for dinner and helped herself to 3 servings!  Another plus is that this is a very healthy dish.

This was good.  I used 3 breasts and added some garlic, sundried tomatoes and seasoning.  It would be nice if the broth thickened, but all in all, tasty.  thanks for the post!

I had a hard time getting the flavor of the olives and artichokes to permeate the chicken. Also canned olives are a little bland in this recipe - if I try it again I'll use fresh kalamatas instead.

I liked this recipe, my hubby hated it.  I changed it the following ways:  4 bone in skinless breasts, lots of herbs (rosemary, thyme, italian seasonings) and garlic.  I also added a chopped tomato and a little more broth and wine.  Chicken was cooked in an hour and not dried out at all.  In fact the reason my hubby didn't care for this is that he thought the chicken tasted poached.  I thought it was a good, flavourful dish and would make again if I were single ;-)  I added cornstarch to the sauce and thickened it up and served over rice.  An easy, healthy meal if you like the olive and artichoke flavours.  I also thought listed fat and calories seemed very high, considering there were no added fats or oils.  I know olives and artichokes have fat but 41 g per serving??

This was quick and easy to make, I used boneless thigh meat and added a few more spices. IT was great with herbed mashed potatoes.

This recipe was good, very Mediterranean with the artichoke hearts, black olives, and wine sauce.  I served mine over pasta to make a more hearty meal.  Next time, I will be sure to have crusty bread on hand to dip in the wine sauce.

I made this chicken for my dad, who is difficult to please, and he loved it!  I was nervous that it might turn out dry -- baking it for one hour gave me the perfect tenderness and juiciness that everyone loves in chicken.  It was so easy to prepare too!

I like this dish, but I can't decide how I feel about the tarragon.  I put it in only about half the time, leaving it out other times.  Still a nice easy weeknight dinner.

Simple, healthy, and flavorful.  I accidentally bought whole chicken breasts and found they needed longer to cook.  The chicken was very juicy and tender.  We used dried tarragon and added minced garlic, capers, sliced mushrooms, and fresh tomatoes afterwards.  This is a good recipe to experiment with different additional ingredients.  We ate it with whole wheat spaghetti and a touch of Parmesan cheese.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I make it at least two times a month!  My husband doesn't like olives so I usually omit them but it still tastes wonderful!

For anyone who loves artichokes, this is a dish you have to try. The combination of the artichokes and black olives makes for a great meal. Great dish!

This was good.  However, it was a little salty.  I think it need a lttle something to off set the salty artichoke and black olivel.  I too put the artichoke and olives over the chicken.  I made pasta but we chose to eat it with crusty bread.  I will make this again.  I think maybe some red pepper flakes or something to offset the other flavors?

Eh, this was okay. I used boneless chicken breasts, which may have been the problem. Sauteed onion and garlic in a pan before searing the breasts. Then followed the recipe. It wasn't bad but not awesome either. Thanks for the recipe though!

This was good and interesting, but I probably wouldn't make it again.  It was very easy though, and the chicken turned out very tender!  Served with brown/wild rice and steamed asparagus.

I wanted to like this - I love all the ingredients.  It just didn't taste right to me, though, and no one ate the leftovers, either. Since it has so many raves, maybe I did something wrong?  I probably won't ever try it again, though, to find out.

Good. I used Boneless Skinless Breast meat as it is all I had. This is a keeper and a good one for company! I thickened the sauce and added parmesan to the top when done. We have to eat with less sodium so I used low sod. broth, rinsed the canned olives and artichoke hearts well.

This was absolutely delicious!!! My only change – less olives (6oz).  Couldn’t stop bragging about it, and even shared the recipe with others.  The bottom line – it made me a better cook :)

My whole family didn't like this one.  The chicken didn't absorb any of the flavors and was very bland.  I won't be making this again:(

The chicken similar to poached instead of baked. It wasn't bad just not very exciting. I probably will not make this again.

I tried this last night. It was good but not as good as I thought it would be after reading all the reviews. I don't think I'll make it again because I have other chicken recipes that are better.

The first time I made the dish, the chicken breast were overcooked and dry.  The 2nd time, I covered in foil which kept the breast moist but the chicken did not brown.  My husband felt there was too many olives so I will probally cut back on them next time but overall the receipe was very tasty and different.  My grandchildren and thier parents do not like olives or artichokes so they would not eat it.
