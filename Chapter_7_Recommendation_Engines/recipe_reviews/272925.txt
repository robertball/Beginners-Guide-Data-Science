Okay, I'm one of *those* people, I admit it. I already had harissa and meatballs made, and I had to sub linguica for the sausage. And I sauteed onions and garlic. And served with basmati rice. BUT. The flavor of this stew was so outstanding I want to make it again tomorrow. I can't wait to see how good this will be actually following the recipe. Thank you!
