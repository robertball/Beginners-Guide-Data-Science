Made this last week.  Love it.  It only took 2 large (almost 4 lbs) zucchini that I grew in my garden.  I used 1/2 of a red pepper and some carrot.  The nutmeg gives it a great taste.

Made 1/2 recipe...glad I did,  1st. batch was a little too sweet for my taste - but husband loved it.    2nd batch I used less sugar and replaced nutmeg with hot pepper flakes.  That's how I'll make it next year.  Need one more cooking to give for Christmas.  Thank you.  Love your web page.  Love your recipes.

This was my first attempt at making relish and it was great...it was easy to do and I was able to make it to fit our family...I am allergic to peppers and my husband cant have a lot of onion so I was able to leave out the peppers and only do a small amount of onion...cant wait to make it again for my extended family.

Super easy and incredibly Yummy! 
I am totally new to the world of making my own Relish, pickles and canning period. This recipe was easy and turned out great! It is SUPER sweet and tangy. Perfect for that extra squash from the garden.

Lots of zucchini - what to do?  Make relish!  Zucchini- cut all pulp out, sliced in thin strips and grated in food processor.  Also added one diced green pepper and 3/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  Used what I had on hand - 1 cup of cider vinegar and 1-1/2 cups of white vinegar.

I've made it a couple of time,  mostly as written, just cut down the sugar a bit  as a personal preference.  Love having another way to preserve what's in the garden.

Yes, this is a great base for a zucchini relish that I can add celery, jalapeno or garlic to if I have any on hand. It tastes great and I will be making it over and over as the zucchinis grow. :)

I made it pretty much just as the recipe stated but added a bit more diced red pepper (more for color than flavor) and 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper for a little "zip". Terrific!

I made this relish a couple  days ago and will not make it again. To begin with, it is WAY too sweet. In addition, the cider vinegar gives it an unappetizing color.   I made the recipe exactly as presented.

very good relish.  i used white vinegar though instead of apple cider, green bell peppers instead of red and a shredded yellow squash for the color.  i was worried about the amount of sugar, but it came out great.  the spices give it a good flavor.
