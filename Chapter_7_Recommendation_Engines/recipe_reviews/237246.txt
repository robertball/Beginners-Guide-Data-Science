I followed the recipe as far as ingredients go, omitting the optional raisins. I have 3 slow cookers, but not one has a medium setting. I used the smallest one, a 2-quart slow cooker. I used the HIGH setting and stirred at the end of each hour for 2 hours. Then I turned it to LOW for another hour, stirring after each half hour segment. I understand some people do not want sugar, and I can respect that. I prefer a small amount of erythritol/stevia blend and added it at the end before I filled 6 small half pint jars. Now I have breakfast ready for the week and can add berries or nothing at all. ***Update - This is delicious cold even! A great grab-n-go breakfast!

I do something similar.... 
Raisins, cinnamon,with a smidge of cloves & nutmeg...
Into crock pot with 5 cups water and 1 heaping cup 
Of steel cut oats and raw honey... Put on low, go about
my chores, stirring occasionally, and when finished, 
Pour into a loaf pan.... Each morning slice off what I 
want, put the rest back into fridge....
Looking forward to trying the bananas .... Sounds very good....

For our house, it's not important that we leave out dairy, so I added a tablespoon or two of butter for richness. Serve it with milk or half and half and I feel like I've got Heaven in a bowl!

I'm about to make this for the third time since my first batch a week ago. I like it that much. But I prefer it minus the raisins.

I like the idea of the mashed bananas, but if the objective is to cut back on sugar, omit the raisins. I also use almond/coconut milk in place of half of the water to add protein. This also adds a creamier texture overall. 
This can also be frozen in cupcake pans. Remove single servings and reheat in the microwave. A real timesaver.

1- I use steel cut oats.  
2- I use ripe bananas. 
3- For alternative flavors, I like to substitute (fresh or frozen) blueberries for raisins...Or a pureed apple.  Be creative!

Wow so easy! I made it overnight in crock pot set on low and it was delicious, I recommend using a liner for this one as the oatmeal sticks to sides pretty well I have always wanted to make an overnight oatmeal and this was a great start!

So simple and delicious!! I often make it just as written, and other times leave out the banana or raisins and add some cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger then squeeze in some honey for sweetness. Someone mentioned leaving out the raisins if omitting sugar is your goal, but it is refined sugar that many of us are trying to cut back on, so go ahead and add those raisins if this is your goal too! This is a recipe that begs to be tweaked to your liking - add the spices/fruits/sweetener of your choice and enjoy! Oh, and it will fill a bunch of jars, they just won't be huge jars! I use the little jelly jars that hold about a cup. But this makes for a very filling breakfast, so you don't need more than a cup in the morning to feel satisfied and get on with your day! :) I also warm mine up then add some Almond Milk - yum!!!

Really like the way the bananas added flavor to the water and I added honey to taste.  When putting into 1 pint jars I would fill 1/2 and add a layer of fruit (bananas, blueberries, pear, raspberries)then another layer of oatmeal and top with more fruit.  Sent it through my office microwave for 1:45 and enjoyed a tasty breakfast!

One can say this is no added sugar, but it is definitely not "sugar free". I hope people understand the difference.

Ugh...i really wanted to like this recipe but it was yuck...i even added cranberries and walnuts and it still wasn't good...i used the steel oats and it was just glop and so sad that a bowl of instant oatmeal would of been tastier...deffinatly needed something...but didn't know how to salvage it...even tried adding some brown sugar and blue berries after trying original recipe and it still wasn't good...

This is delicious! I do add a pinch of salt to the pot. I also omitted raisins because of the sugar. Love steel cut oats. Evidently some people don't know what they are supposed to taste like. Great idea for a few days breakfast. Good with a little fruit yogurt too. You can do so much with this recipe. Thanks!

GOOD EASY  hubby really likes and I don't have to make everyday. This lasts a week.  I use milk instead of water and a good squirt of honey.

Awesome!!! I cooked it on high for 2 hours stirring about every 30-45 minutes. I put mine into 1 1/4 size Tupperware so only made 4 a little larger servings:)

I love this recipe.  I add additional vanilla and cinnamon and add 1 cup craisins instead of raisins.  I also add some powdered fiber.  Top with chopped walnuts or sliced almonds.

Enjoyed having  ready made oats on hand. I'm not sure what steel oats are, I used berry flavoured Jungle oats. The banana still goes black so the oats look grey but still taste ok. I'm going to try with blueberries next.

Sounded like a great idea but I just don't like the taste of bananas and oatmeal.  Ate one serving trying to be fair.  And, yes, it does make a lot of oatmeal. Sad.
