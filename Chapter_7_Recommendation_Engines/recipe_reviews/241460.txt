This was my first time ever making chowder it was exactly like eating at a restaurant. It tasted just like I imagined it would. I changed the fish to half a pound of lobster, three quarter pound of haddock, three quarter pound of scallops, and a pound of shrimp to make it morw chunky. it was a hit as an appetizer in a three course meal for my family.

I made the chowder with some minor changes. 
1. I omitted the saffron (couldn't find it at my local store)
2. I used tilapia instead of halibut
3. I added some imitation lobster meat I had in my freezer
4. I added extra Half-N-Half ( texture was very thick)
Otherwise, I followed the recipe as listed, and it was delicious! I've never made homemade chowder before, but thought It compared better than many chowders I have ordered in a restaurant! Great recipe!

This is the best chowder we have ever had. I added some fresh salmon cut in chunks and a half cup of corn kernels from fresh corn that we had the night before. I cut the garlic to two tablespoons  and added two cups of two percent milk to the half and half. I had no saffron. I used two cups of cooked lobster from our feast a few days ago (I had frozen it)
A decadent meal served with garlic toast and salad. I will definitely make this again (if affordable)

Pretty good. I used salmon, shrimp, scallops and lump crab meat which made it pretty expensive. Also added the Louisiana touch with some cayenne pepper and Old Bay seasoning. I will make it again. Husband loved it!

Loved this recipe! Tweaked it a little bit, as to what I had on hand. But I will certainly be making this again in the future. Itâ€™s going to be great to freeze the leftover portions too!
