This is a wonderful side dish.  I didn’t have any slivered almonds so I chopped some whole almonds and cooked it the same.  The dried cranberries add nice flavor.  I recommend watching the baking time because an hour would have been too long for me.

Delicious! I kept mine on the stovetop instead of baking it & it was done in less time. Also, used half craisin & half dried blueberries because I had them. I will definitely be making this again; husband, 2 small children and myself enjoyed it thoroughly. Might even add it to the Thanksgiving menu this year. Tonight we had it with grilled chicken thighs marinated in berry vinaigrette and a simple cucumber salad.

I don't see the point using the oven. I make this in much less time by cooking the rice on the stovetop  with the craisins and tossing in the almonds, salt,  pepper, and parsley after the rice is cooked. Results seem identical and takes much less time.

Very easy to make & tasty. We both loved this!   I prefer to make a recipe as written but I had to improvise a bit based on my pantry - using cashews instead of almonds.  Working with only a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries, I added 2 Tablespoons of sweetened coconut (after sautéing the nuts) to make sure I had a good sweet balance.  The nuts and the coconut worked well!  [I worried it would be bland and added another T of butter (to make it 4 not 3). The extra butter was unnecessary.]   Oh!  I forgot to spray the pan but it seems ok (esp w my extra butter).

I really liked it, but my hubby didn't.  In all fairness though, he doesn't like "fruit with food" (craisens) and actually, really prefers white rice.  So, I'm taking his feedback with a grain of salt.  I followed the recipe as listed other then using chopped almonds because I did not have slivered ones.  I also sprayed the baking dish with a butter-garlic spray grease, but don't think that added anything to the flavor.  I really liked the long hands-free baking time.....it gave me plenty of time to make the rest of dinner and relax a bit.  It is a beautiful looking rice dish and I'll make the side again.  I'll only 1/2 it next time....that will be more manageable for my family of 5.

Loved it!  Worth the time and effort.  I used all wild rice too.  Will try it with the mixed next time.  Great change from plain rice.

A rice cooker works best for me (including the keep warm setting), takes less time and is reliable cooked rice.  Otherwise, an awesome side.

The whole family loved this!  I didn't have cranberries so I used currants and it turned out fantastic!  Will definitely be making again.

I made this for the first time for a dinner with friends and they all raved about it. So simple ! I served with Cornish hens. Wouldn't change a thing & will definitely make again.

I did not have crasins so I used golden raisins instead. I used all wild rice, I also prepared the rice on the stove top and then tossed everything in after for a faster cook time. The flavors and textures of this dish are right up my alley, I really enjoyed it!

I left out the cranberries (personal preference) but this was the perfect side dish for salmon... Yum!  I've made it a few times now and I love it.  No guess work involved, just perfect rice every time!

I plan to make this for an important dinner and guests, so I made it first for myself. I was unsure about the ratio of brown to wild rice, but used  2 parts brown to 1 part wild and it was great.  I did not bother with the parley, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Really happy and will l be making it again in a few days.

This was surprisingly tasty! I have had several failed attempts at pilaf, most being rather flavorless, but the butter and toasted almonds really added a lot to the flavor of this recipe.  I ran out of parsley (2 TBS is a lot!), so I subbed with Mural of Flavor from Penzey's Spices, and it was a fantastic addition! Also, I couldn't bring myself to add the cranberries. I am just not a fan of that combo. I may get bold and try golden raisins at some point!

Delicious, mildly sweet. I just used whole almonds that I chopped which gave the rice a delightful texture. Otherwise I follow the recipe.

Perfect as the recipe reads. The only difference I did was brown the almonds in a toaster oven, so did not need the butter.  An hour was just the right time for the rice to be done and slightly al dente.  The almonds add texture and a nice flavor.

Very tasty.  I agree it doesn’t have to be cooked in oven. Still have to perfect the stovetop rice cooking because mine always sticks to bottom before it finishes cooking.

It sure sounded much better than it tasted. 
Next time I would make it with Wild Rice only and cut back on the almonds. 
It was good, but not what I expected.

I "veganized" the recipe by eliminating butter.  I toasted the almonds in a dry skillet. In addition, I cooked the wild rice on stove top without salt and oil.  I already had brown riced cooked and followed the recipe otherwise.  The cranberries and almonds made the dish!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Love this, although like others have mentioned, I changed the method. Threw the rice and broth into my rice cooker, dry toasted the almonds on the stove, and then threw everything in the rice once it was done. Stirred it all up and let it sit for a few minutes and voila - a side dish simple enough for a weeknight and elegant enough for an occasion.

I made this exactly as is except that i skipped the toasting of the almonds in butter. I already had toasted almonds on hand. I also added the salt and pepper to the raw rice before cooking. I liked the simplicity of this recipe and that the flavours were complimentary.

This was okay. Will most likely not make again.
