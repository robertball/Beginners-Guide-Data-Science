What a FANTASTIC marinade!  We don't eat wings very often (and never at home) so I just made the marinade (subbing out the sundried tomatoes for 1 tbsp ketchup) and added the garlic powder and chili powder to the marinade on the stove.  I also left out the cornstarch (didn't have it). Then I used it to marinate chicken breasts and steak, and holy cow!  Tons of flavour!  I went out and bought sesame oil and white wine for this recipe, and I'm so glad I did.  Thanks a million!

This was AWESOME. We made a 5lb bag of wings for two people and they were gone in 30 minutes! I followed the recipe just as it was except i used left over Reisling for the white wine. I did add a few oz. more because i thought my tomoatoe part came out too pasty. We also use Habenero sauce. That wasn't bad. I DISLIKE spicy and he LOVES it and found it was tolerable. Loved it on the grill. This is a recipe for "special" friends and would have to make another 5lbs for two more people.

The sauce was weird. Didn't even put it on the wings after I made it. Rather have the regular hot wings I guess.

Pretty flavorful.  I would probably add just a touch more soy sauce and honey, but overall very good.

This is the second time I've made this, both times using boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Due to time restraints, it only marinated about 45 minutes. This time I used chipotle powder with the chili powder and garlic pepper on the chicken. I added a couple garlic cloves in with the dried tomatoes and wine. I used less dried tomato this time and an extra tablespoon of honey. The first time I think I may have used too many dried tomatoes as I do not not know what "2 sun-dried tomatoes" amount to. I dry my own tomatoes in a dehydrator and the first time I used a palm full. This time I used about 4 pieces. I thought it a little too tomato-ee the first time but my hub thought it was perfect. I have some wings in the freezer and I will use this recipe again and try to fall somewhere in between on the tomatoes.

This was excellent! The sauce smelled a bit odd while cooking which made me nervous but there was nothing odd in the end. There was not one dominant flavor and they all mixed together so nicely. The only negative thing I have to say about this recipe is the cook time. They only need about half of what the recipe states. I don't feel the sun dried tomatoes added anything. Maybe they did but I will leave them out next time and see. These would be a huge hit at a Superbowl party. HUGE.
