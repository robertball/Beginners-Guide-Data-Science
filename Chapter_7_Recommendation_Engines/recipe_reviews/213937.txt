This was absolutely delicious.  The fruit combination was sweet, tangy and creamy all at the same time.  It has beautiful colors and came together very quickly.  Not what I would call a diet food with the calorie count plus it is darn hard to stop eating!

What a refreshing change on "fruit salad" one usually finds at a brunch. I used really ripe mangoes and grapefruit, giving plenty of juice to the salad. I am not a fan of avocados, but the combination of the three is spectacular. This dish now a regular addition to our Saturday morning waffles.

This recipe is fantastic. I usually enjoy grapefruit only occasionally with lots of sugar, but I could eat this daily! It really is the perfect balance of flavors. Very easy, healthy and fresh. Full of vitamins and healthy fats and fiber. I brought it to a family dinner and everyone raved about it.

This is really delicious and refreshing. I used a ruby red grapefruit and it was superb. I'm going to try it as a compliment to fish or chicken from the grill. thanks for the recipie.

Very refreshing. The creaminess of the avocado is there, but the taste is overwhelmed by the mango, which is not a bad thing at all.  There are probably better ways to use a precious avocado, but this way isn't wasted either. I would make this again.

Daughter loved this recipe as I can't eat grapefruit due to medical condition. She said it was wonderful and wants to make it herself! Yea for her. She said she love the contrast of the grapefruit and avocado and flavors were right on.

This was good! I used an orange as I didn't have a grapefruit. I would definitely make it again.

Very refreshing flavors; quick and easy to put together!  Will be making this more often and like the idea of pairing with cottage cheese.  Will see how the flavor improves after sitting overnight.

Delicious and easy to make!  Very fresh and light tasting. I thought it actually tasted better after refrigerating overnight.  I will serve this a lot this summer!  Thanks!

This was yummy!  I didnâ€™t use the lime juice and it still had a wonderful creamy, tart and sweet taste combination.

Delicious! My grapefruit was very pithy, consequently not enough segments, and not the ruby red I thought it was - just added a bit more lime juice for the citrus flavor. Tasted great, although not as pretty as the picture!

Very easy and healthy. I used a can of ruby red grapefruit sections instead of fresh (draining the juice for another purpose). My husband liked it and he is not a fan of grapefruit.

Although it was refreshing, I'm just not that into grapefruit and it seems like it might have been better with just mango and avocado. Sorry, not my thing.

5.9.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/213937/three-amigos-salad/ ... Who woulda thought?!  :D  'Had a mango & avocado to use; subbed about 1c canned mandarin oranges; 1/2T bottled lime juice.  'Not too sweet or tart.  Pretty, too - unlike the photo.  'Good with a little salt &/or crushed red pepper.
