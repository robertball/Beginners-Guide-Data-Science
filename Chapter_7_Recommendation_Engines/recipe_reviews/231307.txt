We thought this was fabulous-followed the recipe exactly! The sauce was outstanding.  I served it with the Jasmine Coconut rice and Asian cucumber salad from this site.  The sauce was great mixed in with the rice!

Very good.  The peanut sauce is divine.  I grilled the chicken using metal skewers.  Don't over cook the chicken as it will get dry.

Nice balance of spice and peanut taste. I served it with Jasmine rice and thai cucumber salad. I will definitely make this again. Even my picky seven year old loved it.

Made this tonight for dinner and thought it was really good.  The chicken was tender and the peanut sauce was delicious.  Next time will add some red pepper flakes for a little heat.  Thank you for sharing!

Very, very good.  I added a teaspoon of sambal (chili garlic paste) to add a little more spice.   We really enjoyed this.  Thanks!

Followed the recipe EXACTLY, as I always do the first time I try a new one to be fair to the person who posted the recipe. It was FREAKIN DELICIOUS!!! The chicken was so flavorful and the sauce was delicious. Seriously as good as any I have had at a Thai restaurant, and I have been to many. I'm sure some minor substitutions could be made without totally fouling up the flavor but do yourself a favor and try this as written first. You will not be disappointed.
*If you like extra sauce to pour over the rice make sure to double the sauce recipe.

Brilliant! The only other thing I did was to soak the wooden skewers in cold water to stop them burning. I also left the chicken in the fridge over night. Lovely flavour.

Very good, loved it. I didn't have Fish sauce so I used a 1:1 combination of Soy Sauce and Worcestershire Sauce. Adding it to my fav recipes list

I did not like the peanut sauce, it contained too much peanut butter for my taste, took away too much flavor from all the other ingredients. Maybe next time I'll try with half the amount.

I make this often as it is my youngest son's favourite Thai dish. The peanut sauce is fabulous and I choose to marinate the chicken for at least 4-5 hours. Thanks for posting.

This was good exactly as written.  The sauce is what its all about for my family so after tasting the first batch it was good but a little watered down, good for serving over rice but not so much for a dipping sauce.   So I did a second batch of sauce without the chicken stock and adding in a little hot sauce.  Will be making often.

I make this recipe often. I marinate the chicken overnight and I find the chicken is more tender and flavorful. Also, I use chunky peanut butter in the dipping sauce which gives it a nice crunch. I cook my rice with coconut milk and water and serve the chicken with lettuce leaves for wrapping. One bite and you feel like you're in Thailand! Delicious and makes for good leftovers. curry and peanut butter = yum!

I used brown sugar. Would recommend adding a little cayenne next time. And use less sugar.

Loved the video and very easy to make.
I had all the ingredients but the lime juice.
I substituted Stevia for the sugar and used brown rice instead.

I really liked it! I should have read the directions the morning of the day I made it, because I ended up not having enough time to refrigerate the chicken. It just ended up being a little bland, but the peanut sauce made up for it and the entire dish was otherwise super delicious!

This is an excellent recipe!  I made it so we could have homemade Vietnamese food.  I served it over rice vermicelli with shredded raw carrots and cabbage and poured some of the peanut sauce on top.  Definitely going to save this recipe!

Thank you for this recipe. It was very good. The food was tasty and I liked the mild spice level and creamy texture of the sauce. I've never used fish sauce. As a result of not having any, I omitted this in the marinade and only realized after tasting a piece of cooked chicken, that the recipe got its salty taste from the fish sauce. So I used 1/4 tsp salt in the sauce and it worked out well! ????

Was okay ... I had to leave out the fish sauce (I don't like fish or anything that resembles it!) and not sure what I could have substituted for that as I am sure that would have added to the flavor.   Any suggestions for substituting fish sauce?

Yummy!!! I used red curry because I didn’t have any yellow curry and it was delicious! Served with jasmine rice and sautéed carrots, red peppers and broccoli.

I made this a week ago, froze half of it (dinner prep), and at the other half fresh.  Both the fresh and the rewarmed frozen leftovers were awesome!

I'm about to make 24 servings of it for future dinners and freeze them again.  This time around, I'm leaving out the added sugar in the sauce (it was a bit sweet for us) and I'm going to swap out Hoisin sauce for the fish sauce for a little more complexity of flavor, and I'll cut back a little on the coconut milk to make it thicker and a little less sweet (not much though).

Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing it!

Satay was one of my favorite dishes at a restaurant I frequented in Seattle, WA, so I was eager to try this recipe.  I was not disappointed at all - it was just like the restaurant version.   I served it the first time over rice noodles then, for the leftovers I used Chow Mein Noodles, just for the "crunch" factor.  Next time, and there will be next time, I'm going to try, cubing the marinated chicken and grilling them on skewers with tomatoes, instead of using the oven.

These were yummy and the sauce was very good.  I made the recipe as written .  I was a little worried about the sauce being too runny with so much liquid, but after simmering it thickened up nicely.  Great summer entertaining recipe.  Thanks for sharing, AR.

This was my first time making Chicken satay, it turned out wonderful, so moist and tasty. I did take advice from other reviews, I was making this as an appetizer so I didn't add the chicken broth and added more peanut butter so the dipping sauce was thicker. I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe! The peanut sauce was divine and comes together super quick. I accidentally added an extra tablespoon of curry, but I did not regret it. It gave it a little more kick . I also didn't have any lime juice and didn't miss it.   Be sure to use natural peanut butter.

Loved it.  Wish I used higher quality peanut butter the first time though, as the cheap stuff lacked flavor.

This is amazing!!!  I followed the recipe as written except grilled the chicken skewers on a grill mat. Served with rice and a salad. So good! The peanut flavor isn't overpowering, which I like. Alot of layers of flavor. Will definitely make again!

This was a big hit with my family. The only thing I did different was to broil the chicken instead of pan fry it. And I think I added more curry powder. I didn't really measure it. But it was a great recipe and I will definitely make it again.

I used Madras curry since it was the only curry available at the store I went to. Still came out pretty good and not as spicy; just how I like it.

I made the sauce, only, to go with some leftover chicken I had on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly, and the sauce, while good, didn't taste of much more than curry powder.  It lost the subtle flavors of the coconut and lime that I expected.

I then realized that I had half-a can of coconut milk leftover that would probably go bad before I used it again, so I doubled the recipe but didn't add any additional curry powder, and was very pleased with the results.

I'd make the sauce again, halving the curry powder, and I look forward to making the dish in its entirety.

I don't understand the high reviews for this recipe.   My family loves Thai food and I was so excited to make this, but found it to be so incredibly bland and unflavorful that no matter how I tried to doctor it up, it just was not good.  All thumbs down with the family.  Would be a one star if I didn't work on it to make it edible.

The meat was tender and had a beautifiul color, but it tasted  kind of bland.  The dipping sauce was necessary to spice it up.  The next time I will use the dipping sauce as my marinade and grill it.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add 1/4 cup more chicken broth and a little hot sauce to give it some heat.  Not all coconut milk are the same texture. Mine was thicker so I had to add more broth.   We served it with rice.  The dipping sauce was good over the rice, too.

I've made this several times with both creamy and crunchy peanut butter. For a smooth sauce creamy is a must, but I found I liked little bits of peanut crunch that using the crunchy peanut butter provided. Either way this is easy and delicious.

Just made the sauce for this recipe to go with stirfry veggies--zucchini, mushrooms, snow peas, carrots, and water chestnuts.  It was AWESOME!!!  The only change I made was that I used brown sugar instead of white, and Roses lime juice instead of fresh lime.  I will most definitely make this again, soon!

Chicken marinade gives the chicken good flavor.  I missed soy a little and might try that with it next time too.  The peanut/curry sauce is great for dipping!  Not the kind of satay sauce I'd use on a thai pizza personally due to the curry flavor, but I love it for dipping my chicken skewers!

Simple and amazing.  Truly a glorious addition to my meal prep.  It takes almost no time to make and still tastes amazing even a couple days later.

The recipe was very easy to follow. However, I found the chicken was a little dry and not very flavourful- it needed more salt. Also the sauce definitely needed more peanuts and maybe lesser curry powder. I might try a variation of this recipe next time.

Absolutely amazing. Threw broccoli in with the chicken in a frying pan and ate over rice.

This is a great dish! I used a fresh (ground from whole spices less than a month ago) madras curry in both the sauce and the marinade. And I used Three Crabs brand fish sauce (it's the best).

SAUCE REVIEW: Next time, I'm going to use water instead of chicken broth, omit the sugar, and up the amount of peanut butter to 1/3 cup. This sauce is going to be great on many things!

CHICKEN REVIEW: I used plain yogurt instead of coconut milk in the marinade (because that's how most of my satay recipes go). I threw a piece on a hot grill after marinating for 6 hours and i decided it wasn't quite long enough. I would recommend overnight, or throw it together before work for that night's dinner. Great color and grill marks though!

This was awesome! I did some minor changes to save time on prep and cooking time. 1) To save on time, I used tenderloins instead of cutting a chicken breast into strips. 2) TIP: Thread the chicken pieces in skewers only if you're going to grill them. It doesn't make sense to thread them and then cook them in a skillet. 3) The store I went to only had Madras Curry. This specific brand is not as spicy so I used a lot more than the recipe called for. 4) I only had crunchy peanut butter on hand so that's what I used and the extra crunch was a hit with my husband. I don't think I made major changes. But it really is a very simple and easy recipe!

Very Good and easy to do.  I do not use skewers because I find them a waste of time.  Great with the recipe Peanut Sauce II off Allrecipes.com

My wife really wanted to go to our local Thai restaurant on Mother's Day but they are closed on Sundays.  I made this recipe exactly as described along with some white rice and grilled vegetables.  She absolutely loved it.  The kids loved the chicken but were lukewarm on the sauce but they aren't big on rich sauces. The only issue I had was that the sauce was very watery.  I added some cornstarch until I got it to the right consistency.  I also added some cayenne to my own ramekin of sauce for a little heat.  I will definitely make this again but will try a little less broth.

Excellent recipe just as good as a Thai Restaurant.  Only change I made was to use PBJ instead of regular peanut butter.  It tastes as good but minus the extra calories

This was delicious! I wish I had doubled the recipe. I let them marinate overnight. I served them with a Thai cucumber salad and jasmine rice.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I didn't put the chicken on skewers. I sprayed my nonstick skillet with pam and cooked the chicken turning as needed. Saved calories not using the oil! Thanks for the recipe.
