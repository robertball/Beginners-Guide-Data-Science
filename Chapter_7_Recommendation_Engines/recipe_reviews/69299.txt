I am Iranian,and I find this recipe missing sugar. There are different versions of this dish in Iran; at North people make it tart, in Tehran it's more sweet and in west they make it sour and sweet. I personally like the latter. For having that  fabulous sour & sweet taste you need less pomegranade paste and some sugar (usually 2-3 spoon sugar for 5-6 spoon paste for 2 lb chicken) Though it depends on your taste. Anyhow I thought you might find it work better for you.

This dish is fit for a Sultan,or the King of your house. Very easy to prepare. I served it over basmati rice. My husband is from the middle east & he said it was as good as any he has ever had!We found the Pomegranate syrup at the middle eastern store-it was called pomegranate molassas. Don't be put off by it's sweet appearance-this dish is a sweet & sour masterpiece,in looks as well as taste!

This has been one of my favorites for many years but I make it a little bit differently. First, I use about half of the walnuts. After cooking the chicken breasts, I cut them into smaller pieces and instead of simmering the entire mixture in a skillet for 20 minutes, I bring the onion, ground walnuts, chicken, pomegranate paste and a cup or two of water (until it looks soupy) to a boil in a saucepan and add a bit of sugar and turmeric. I then cover and simmer for almost 2 hours. It's ready when the mixture has thickened. This has to be served on top of plain white rice - basmati is the best.

Fesenjun over rice is my alltime favorite Persian dish. My Iranian husband learned how to make this from his father who is an excellent cook. The way they make it is the best. They fry the onion in oil along with the chicken until the onion is tender and the chicken is lightly browned. Then they remove the chicken and onions to a pot. Then walnuts finely ground up in a food processor are browned in the skillet with the remaining oil. Then the ground and browned walnuts are added to the pot of chicken and onions along with around 8-10 ounces of pomegranate syrup, 1/4 cup of sugar (if using Turkish Pomegranate syrup) and about 2 cups of water. Then it is cooked for about an hour until the water cooks down and it is thick and the chicken breasts are starting to pull apart and then it served over rice with a dollop of plain yogurt on the side. YOU SHOULD NOT USE POMEGRANATE PASTE OR JUICE! It should be Pomegranate SYRUP and you have to pay attention to where the syrup is from. If it is Iranian pomegranate syrup you probably won't have to add sugar unless you want it to be sweeter. Turkish Pomegranate syrup is more sour so you will probably want to add sugar. You can make this dish sweet, sour or sweet & sour depending on your taste as it is made in these various ways in different parts of Iran.

I am Persian, and while I was recently talking to my mother about recipes, I let her know this one came through my e-mail. When I let her know, she was just dying to know how to make it! She knows all the recipes such as Ghorme Sabzi and Gheime Badenjoon but she didn't know how to make this. Anyhow, there is too much pomegrante sauce in the recipe. She tells me it is only supposed to be one or two tablespoons. That might be why some are complaining about their food tasting funny. I just thought I would share!

I made this for my wife for Valentine's Day this past February. I was a little hesitant at first because, although I love pomegranates, my wife was only indifferent to pomegranates. We both abosolutely LOVED the flavor of this dish. We had some left and give it to my mother-in-law. She loved it too. I spent three and a half years living in Iran in during the 1970s when my father was stationed there while in the U.S. Air Force. I never ran across the dish, but when I saw it, I just had to make it. My wife is wondering when I will make it again. If you can get or make some barbary bread to go with it and serve it over white rice you will have a close to authentic Persian dining experience.

I love Fessen Jan!  I gave it four stars because it an be perfect with a couple tweaks: I add about 1 tsp. of turmeric to the onion while it is frying.  I also use (1) 16 oz. bag of walnut pieces, which renders more than 1 cup.  I pound my walnuts with a hammer to make them as fine as possible (and I don't have a food processor so I really do not have a choice!).  I use 2 small game hens if they are on sale; if not, I use 1 lb. of chicken pieces with the skin on.  I boil the meat, take it out when finished, and use that chicken stock as my liquid base for the Fessen Jan.  If it needs more liquid, I just add chicken broth, never water.  Then, into the liquid base I add: the onion/turmeric mixture, the finely ground walnuts, about ½ c. sugar, and the bottle of concentrated pomegranate paste/juice.  I do not use the full 10 oz bottle, maybe about ¾ of the 10 oz. bottle.  I bring it to a boil, reduce heat to about a 3 or 4 on the stove, and let it simmer for about 2 hours.  When finished, add the chicken or game hens.  Here are the secrets to the best Fessen Jan: 1.  Make sure the walnuts are ground so fine that when you handle it, the mass of ground-up walnuts is almost like play-doh; 2.  According to some of the best Iranian cooks I know, the darker the sauce, the better.  This is accomplished by using almost all of10 oz bottle of concentrated pomegranate juice/paste.  My father, who is Iranian (and a darn good cook, I might add!) told me that back in the day when he was growin

This is a great recipe...easy...but I always add sugar to the sauce so it cuts the tartness and the flavor becomes sweet and sour. Some may like more sugar, others less, depends on your taste buds. i chop the walnuts until they are super fine.  i love this recipe.

I was really excited to find this recipe as I love Middle Eastern food, but when I made this it was terrible.  I had guests over and wanted to make them something special, but it was a disaster. However, I do have to admit that I didn't have as much walnuts as was called for, but the pomegranate paste was just so overpowering I can't imagine that it would have mattered that much.  The dish was so tart, that you couldn't really taste anything else. Anyhow, I won't be trying this again, sorry.

Okay, I must have done something wrong, because this was bad! I have an adventurous palate, but this dish was too intense or bitter. We used Pomegranate Juice- concentrated (10 ounce bottle) that we got at our favorite middle eastern market (that's all they had and they had a lot of it), so we figured this must be it. But, again, just so bad. Please advise. Thanks.

I make Fesenjan all the time (I am iranian) and like the other person I find you are missing a few ingredients.  Try adding tumeric, salt and pepper to taste when you brown the chicken, then add a couple of spoonfuls of sugar to taste when you add the pomegranate syrup.  Also Pomegranate paste is NOT the same as syrup.  If you use paste you need only 2-4 TB as it is thicker than  molasses and will be VERY strong.  In that case also add an equal amount of ketchup and slightly less sugar.   (Paste is usually home-made.)  I also prefer the taste of corn oil in this to olive and you will note the oil will be slightly yellow because of the turmeric. You can easily skim oil off if it bothers you.   I also cook my onion and walnuts together rather than apart as it keeps the walnuts from burning and is easier to just grind them together in the cusinart.

this didn't come out as well as when others have made it, but the taste was there.  I think I needed to ground the walnuts finer.  I'll try it again.

Having read through the reviews I want to reach out with a word of warning: This dish is considered one of the "hardest" Persian khoreshes to make. I'm thrilled so many people succeeded in getting the right flavour but for those who didn't, please bear in mind it takes time to intuitively know how to create the perfect harmony between the natural secretion of walnut oil  and the sweet-sour richness of pomegranate syrup. Don't be hard on yourself, worst case scenario: Consult an Iranian grandmother.

Pretty good.  It has a very unique taste.  (I'm a big fan of trying lots
of cuisines but I've never had anything like this.)  I used pomegranate
concentrate because that's the only thing I could find, and only 7 ounces
because I figured it was stronger than syrup and wanted to be safe.
Served next to basmati rice, upon which the extra sauce and walnuts were
piled.  That worked out quite well.   I was wavering between three and
four stars and decided on four because everyone should make this at   
least once.

Instead of the paste/syrup, I used a 64 oz bottle of pomegranate juice boiled for about an hour to reduce down it down to 10 ounces. I still needed to put in a little cornstarch at the very end to thicken it slightly, but it worked just fine. I also added about 4 TBLspns brown sugar and 2 tsps each of tumeric and ground cardamom. It was a little tart, but this would have been fixed by adding more brown sugar. Will make it again, and may add in just a little bit of minced garlic with the onions to give it an extra something. (Serve with basmati rice & naan!)

Just wanted to let folks know that there is a special product (I live in France and you can only find it at Middle Eastern grocers) that is pomegranate syrup, which is different than pomegranate juice. Think of pomegranate juice that has been boiled down to its essence with sugar added. It has the consistency of maple syrup with a darker color and more intensity. I think that it would be very difficult to find in the US and this could account for the disasters in the reviews.

I doubled the recipe for guests, but used the same amount of pomegranate juice as for the single recipe.  I used water and vegeta seasoning (as I'd run out of stock) for the remainder of the liquid.  It turned out GREAT.

I was slightly concerned no-one would try it out, since it has an unusual appearance if you're not used to cooking with ground nuts, but I guess my friends are used to my wild culinary experiments, and they went for it.  It was the most favoured part of the meal, together with the Syrian beans I made from AllRecipes.  They loved it, and I did too... And it's so amazingly easy!

I liked this concept but made a few adjustments right away.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find pomegranite syrup, but I did get pure pomegranite juice, reduce it by 1/2 volume and add 1 T. sugar.  I also used boneless skinless thighs because we prefer the dark meat. I liked the taste of this and serve it with both pearl barley and again with Jasmine rice.   Unfortunately, cooking destroys the color of the pomegranite juice and the appearance is less appealing than I would like.  I did sprinkle the dish once with Aleppo pepper to add a little kick.   I will probably make again if I can find real syrup and take the other reviewer's advice to use less.

I've never had Fesenjun before, so I can't say if this was "right" or not, but I do know that it was tasty! I loved the zing from the pomegranate molasses, totally unexpected but amazing. I would make this again.

This recipe is pretty good and easy. I'm an American married to a Persian man and this is close to my mother in laws dish. In the version I make, I add a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon. I also garnish with fresh pomegranates on top, for color and it makes it pretty.

I sauted the onions briefly first and then ground it as well with the walnuts. Used tofu....takes time but definitely delicious

We did not care for this recipe at all.  I used a 10 oz bottle of pomegranate molasses.  I was under the impression that it is the same thing as pomegranate paste or syrup.  Perhaps that is where I went wrong(?)  It was way too tart and sour for our taste.
