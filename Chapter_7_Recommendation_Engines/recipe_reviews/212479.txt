I LOVED this recipe.   I put the onion, celery and apple slices in the food processor and let it do all the work for me. I also made a few tweaks. I used Italian bread crumbs, colby jack cheese and only one egg.   It came out extremely moist and flavorful. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was wonderful!   Was moist and tasty!  Better than beef meatloaf.  I didn't have bread crumbs, so I added Stove Top cornbread stuffing; didn't have Romano cheese so I used parmesan cheese.  Was good leftovers for my lunch and meatloaf sandwiches!

I thought this recipe was excellent.  I had turkey gravy on the side for those who must drown their meatloaf in something but otherwise made it as directed.  I made homemade poultry seasoning - 3/4 t. sage, 1/4 t. thyme, 1/4 t. marjoram, 1/8 t. black pepper, dash of ground cloves.  Yum!

I adjusted a few things, like I didn't have celery, so I used zucchini, and used normal mince.  I also added some ketchup and chutney for some extra flavour.  My family loved it!

This meatloaf was different.  I had a lot of ground turkey, so I had to do 3X the recipe and used a 13x9 pan. I did not have apples so I used the pre-packaged cups of natural chunky applesauce. It is super moist and almost too moist as it has the look and texture of dressing!  I served with cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes as suggested which was a good idea. But, this was just really strange and not very appetizing to me, especially the next day after it was reheated.

Love this recipe. So does my VERY picky 5 year old. Great next day. I like it so much I am making it tonight, because it makes everyone happy and full. I am going to make sweet potato fries (plain potato fries for son) and broccoli... Definitely recommend! Oh and I usually don't have Romano on hand and well not going to spend the $$$ on one dish so just use Parmesan instead and the apple I don't use Granny Smith unless I have, any apple will do IMO. : )

This was amazing.  Loved it.  The apples in it were wonderful (I didn't have Granny Smith and it was fine anyway).  My husband loved it as well.

I have been wanting to make some Meatloaf "Cupcakes" and this sounded interesting for a fall menu. This is a good meatloaf, but I did make some changes to add moisture and additional flavor. I chopped the celery, onion and apple (omitting the butter)  in my food processor and added the raw ingredients to add flavor and moisture. I used seasoned stuffing cubes instead of plain bread crumbs. This could be a very healthy alternative to beef meatloaf. I do think it needs a bit more seasoning and I think I would double the onion next time. I might add more sage next time too. I also made some whipped potatoes and piped them onto the muffin sized meatloaves and sprinkled with paprika, chives and parsley. Put them under a broiler for a couple of minutes to lightly brown. All in all a fun experiment. Thanks so much for sharing.

Great... and so nice to have a turkey recipe that actually tastes like turkey! Great served with roasted new potatoes. A variation I like is to use Herbes de Provence instead of Poultry Seasoning.  Any nice tart apple will do (the Granny Smiths being the most easily obtained of these).

This was delicious!  I didn't have poultry seasoning (and couldn't find it), so I substituted some chicken bouillon.  I also substituted Parmesan cheese for the Romano, because it has a similar flavor to Romano and I already had some.  Everyone loved it!

This is the best meatloaf I have ever made. My husband is not a ground turkey fan but loved this. Only left out the Romano cheese and used a red apple. I'm eating the leftovers for lunch today :)

Followed directions but couldn't get center to brown.  Meat thermometer read above 190F so I enjoyed with a bit of hesitation.  Flavor was good.

So good!  The only change to the recipe was to leave out the cheese (lactose issues) and to bake in muffin tins.  A new favorite!

meh. it was OK. not the greatest, but not the worst "meatloaf" I've made.  I chose this recipe because I had some ground turkey that needed to be used up, and I actually had all the ingredients on hand.  it was moist freshly cut, broke up easily, and I made a side of poultry gravy and mashed potatoes.  My 6yr old ate it, and at first he said it was really yummy, but as he ate he grew tired of it and said is wasn't his favorite and asked me not to make it again.  My husband thought it was just nice to have something different, and that it was  a good idea for a healthier meatloaf (as opposed to red meat), but not in his top tier of favorites. Overall Edible and Tasty in small doses and does well with gravy.

this was really good although a little dry.  My daughter and her friends really enjoyed it as well.  After I made it I was thinking that some turkey gravy would add the needed/missing element.  I served it with green bean casserole, cranberry sauce and coleslaw.  We always have coleslaw at Thanksgiving! :)

This meatloaf is so different!  I love turkey and just had to try it!  It comes out moist and full of flavor.  I served it with turkey gravy and cranberry sauce.  My husband and I both loved it and will make it a regular!

I made this tonight and it was so good I had to register for allrecipes so I could review it! I made a few changes since I had just 1 lb. of turkey (one egg, less milk/bread crumbs). I also used cheddar instead because I really like the turkey/apple/cheddar combo. I did homemade applesauce and used it as "gravy", it was fantastic. Thank you for this!!

We made this tonight for dinner and it was awesome. Not anything like traditional meatloaf, but tastes like something you'd make with Thanksgiving leftovers. The only thing missing was cranberry sauce!

Bland and boring.  I was worried about the apple flavor over powering this.  Worried for nothing.  This was a Zzzzzz on flavor.

Very good. Added salt and pepper. Used dried cranberries vs apple. Mildly spiced. Recommend adding more poultry seasoning if like stronger f lavors. Husband said tasted lie meat, stuffing, cranberry and potatoe all mixed together. He loved it.

I'm so confused as to what I might have done wrong. I followed the instructions to a T and the end result was very white - with some sort of congealed top - that fell apart when I tried to get it out of the loaf pan.

It was super tasty and I would love to make it again but I want to know what I need to do to make it a proper browned "loaf" ...  no one else seems to have had the same issue :-/

This was good, but I think one (major) component that was missing was salt.  After I started eating, it hit me that I must have missed the salt.  However, the recipe does not call for it.  The poultry seasoning is the only element of "taste" and I don't think 1 tsp of that is enough to flavor this entire meatloaf.  Add salt!

WOW!!! Its like turkey and stuffing all rolled into one! I followed the recipe almost to a T. Only things a did a bit different was I used Panko bread crumbs and parm cheese (all I had on hand). Will definitely make it again! I used 99% lean turkey meat and it was still moist.

My husband is a picky eater and won't touch any meat that has been cooked with fruit. Therefore, I used Waterchestnuts instead of Apple and threw in craisins to satisfy my desire for a sweet. He even ate the craisins and loved this recipe. I will make this over and over again. Thanks!

I followed recipe exactly, except used regular apple (not granny smith) and instead of poultry seasoning I used fresh sage from the garden.  This was great!  Even my picky kids liked it.

This turned out great even though I failed to sauté the onions celery and apples first because I didn’t read the directions,..so if you’re in a hurry you can skip that part throw those things in a food processor then mix it all together and it will still be great!

Substituted Fuji apple for Granny Smith, came out good, but I believe that the granny smith apple would have added more flavor.  It was enjoyed by all.

I was pleasantly surprised with this meatloaf.  It was moist and the granny smith apple added a nice taste.  I used a turkey gravy mix to pour over this and mashed potatoes.

fantastic recipe!!  I recommend making this a couple of hours early to allow the flavors to blend in the turkey meatloaf.  I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I used Poultry seasoning from AR.   I served with mashed potatoes, turkey gravy and canned cranberry sauce.  This would only be enchased with homemade cranberry sauce.  This was super tasty and we look forward to having it again.

Really great turkey loaf.  We diced the veggies really fine in the food processor and added a few diced mushrooms to the mix.  Delish!

I love this recipe - total comfort food. I used a mix of herb breadcrumbs and Italian breadcrumbs, I also used parmesan cheese instead and cooked it for 5 minutes longer...absolutely delicious!

They could place a photo of this dish in the dictionary under the word, "bland".  Quite tasteless... literally no taste.  I did not tweak the recipe in any way, I probably would use an apple with more flavor and more savory seasonings.  I'd skip it altogether if I were you.

My family loved this - but I did add two things that I can not imagine it without - salt and pepper!  Ground turkey is really bland and so hard to season, but with the addition of these 2 simple ingredients, the rest of the flavors really popped!  My kids loved it!  My teenagers said I need to make it on Thanksgiving next year instead of a regular turkey!  Give it a try with the S&P... It really enhances it!

This is one of our fall time favorites.  Once there is a bit of a chill in the air I add it to the meal rotation.  Wouldn't change thing about it!!!
