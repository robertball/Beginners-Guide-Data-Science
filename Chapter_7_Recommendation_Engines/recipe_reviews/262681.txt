This tasty Healthy dish can be served for Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner.
Very Filling, creamy texture and the flavor is over the top. The only addition I made was sprinkling a bit of Everything bagel seasoning over the top before digging in.  ENJOY!!

Great breakfast, I used two egg whites and one whole egg.
I find the whole egg makes it easier to  flip the omlette.
I used coconut oil rather then olive oil. I also added a bit each of bell peppers and zucchini, they needed using up and this was a great way to use them. 
Delicious way to start your day.
Thank you for the recipe.

These flavors all worked together well. I really liked the basil with the avocado. I have free range chickens and felt bad about discarding their gorgeous golden yolks. Next time I'll just use the whole egg.
