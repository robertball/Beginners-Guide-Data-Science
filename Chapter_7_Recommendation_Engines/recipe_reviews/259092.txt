This is a nice and light salad that is perfect for summer. I did feel that half of a red onion and 3 green onions was a bit much and that is coming from a huge onion fan. I say use one or the other and not both. Other than that I have no complaints. This was good and would be good with shrimp in it too.

The vinaigrette was a hit with my guests. I used mixed greens as I think the variety adds flavour. I left the avocados out, I don't like them, and I agreed with another review and only used the red onion.  I thought it might be better with a bit of crunch, maybe celery or jicama.
