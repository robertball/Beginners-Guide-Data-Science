I've relied on Panni's Potato Dumpling mix for many years but, since it's becoming more and more difficult to find, I'd decided to try my hand at a homemade recipe. The basis for this particular recipe is rather sound, but I, too, found them very bland. I reduced the amount of liquid for the mixture ever so slightly and roll the dumplings in my hand (approx. 1.5" - 2" round each). I've found that adding approximately a tbs. (or so; I do it by sight) each of finely-diced fresh parsley, dill and scallions, as well as adding onion or chicken bullion cubes and another tbs. or so of finely-diced scallions to the water (1 cube per cup of water) does wonders! Tried it for the potato dumplings I'd made this past St. Nicholas Day (with a Sauerbraten recipe I'd found on allrecipes.com, which always comes out great), and the dumplings came out perfect!  You can also keep the dumplings in the broth and serve as a soup.

The "Polish" store I usually buy homemade dumplings from quit selling them.  I could not find anything comparable.  So I turned to Allrecipes.  Very good...quite a keeper!  Now my family wants me to make these all the time...especially our 12 year old daughter who is a dumpling expert!  Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for something that didn't require actual potatoes because I didn't have any.  For the simplicity I didn't expect much, but these are excellent.  I actually made them with only 1 egg (didn't read the recipe well) and they turned out just fine.  Like other reviewers I had a problem kneading them.  I used my dough hook and just kept adding flour but they were still sticky even after adding almost 3/4 C more flour.  I pretty much took a spoon and dumped 6 blobs into chicken broth to cook.   They weren't pretty, but they taste great.  Next time I will make them smaller since I thought they were too big.

I agree that on their own they are bland, but I've never eaten dumplings without buttter and salt or gravy of some sort.  We will definately have these again.  Thank you for sharing.

These dumplings were not fluffy at all but I like mine doughy too.  It was very difficult to get them in "dumpling form"  they were so sticky and impossible to knead.  They didn't fall apart while boiling though.

I loved the use of potato flakes! As a college student, this recipe was pretty cheap and helped me change up my menu options. Like a few others, I had a difficult time making the dumplings because the batter was so sticky. To help, I rubbed a little bit of olive oil into my hands as I rolled them, then tossed the dumpling into some flour and rolled them some more. I did this for every dumpling. (I doubled the recipe and ended up making around 30). This really helped and allowed the actual creation of the dumplings go faster. To give them a boost in flavor, after boiling them, I cooked them in a tomato paste with vinegar, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, sliced peppers and cilantro. I let them simmer in the sauce and after about 10-15 min. the dumplings were beautifully seasoned and delicious!

Loved these!  Very easy to make and tasted wonderful.  However, I like mine a little more dense and was wondering if anyone could suggest which to increase, the potatoes or the flour?

These looked great while they were cooked but then once I took them out of the pot to drain they went flat and were so sticky. There were not worth eating. I may have done something wrong since it was the first time every that I have made dumplings...but I followed the directions to a "T" so good luck with this one!

Our family loves these.  Even my 3 year old daughter.  I used Butter & herb mashed potatoes and it gives them such a great flavor.  The regular instant mashed potatoes were bland.

I did not care for this recipe. Sticking with old-fashioned biscuit dough dumplings from here on out.  These had little to no flavor, even after I boiled them in chicken stock instead of water and added garlic and herbs to "help".  :P

This is a great base of a recipe. I tried these and first time they turned out fluffy and yet dense, strange yet delicious and very filling! After removing them from the water I put them in a pan with butter and sausage, which was yummy!

These were pretty good...kind of chewy and like a pasta pancake.  I only made them once...so I guess they weren't a HUGE hit at our house...but they were good.

This is the second time I made these recipe I followed NYC's review used milk instead of water, no eggs. I used self rising flour. I rolled the dough out and cut into strips. Really good this time. (1st time did in balls,used eggs-got 1 star hubby hated them)

I made these last night and was looking forward to however they turned out because the Maggi version is becoming harder to find (and it's expensive).

So, after reading a few reviews I added 1 tsp salt AND 1 tsp bouillon mix. I also added some chives which also helped with color. In the end, they were flavorful,

Ugh, this recpie turned out terribly! 

The mush never turned into dough, and mostly fell apart while cooking. . . after two or three of these dumplings I scrapped the idea and turned them into potato pancakes. . .which surprisingly turned out quite nicely!

Oh my goodness, these were almost a complete disaster! 

The mixture was just so sticky - I spent hours kneading them and adding more and more flour in an effort to get them pliable enough to form ball shapes.  You can imagine after all that flour and kneading how tough they were.

Maybe I did something wrong, I had never made dumplings before so I didn't know how to tweak the recipe.

I was looking for a quick & simple potato dumpling recipe to use with pork & sauerkraut like my grandma used to make so long ago. This recipe worked perfectly! Rather than larger balls, I rolled them and cut off tiny pieces before cooking and I loved them!
