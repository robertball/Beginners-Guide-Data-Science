i do not know what this is, but it is NOT tarte au sucre.
i saw it and tried it, it's not bad tasting, but i think you should give it your own name. Tarte au sucre is from Quebec, Canada and is a very simple recepie. my grandmother is from Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue and if she saw you calling this "Tarte au Sucre" she would cry.

The Maple Sugar Pie was good, but not compared with many that I have while vacationing in Canada - particularly the Quebec region.

One of my favorites. I bring one when I'm invited to dinner and ALWAYS get asked for the recipe. Although it tastes a little like pecan pie, because it's made with maple syrup and walnuts, people will say it's lighter...

Not as super-sweet as some.  I think the tea and the maple syrup tones it down a bit.  Very good though!
