This cake is way too much!  Very good and very rich. The serving amount for this cake should be doubled.  If you cut this into 8 pieces and ate your slice
You would go into sugar shock. Half the cake easily served 10 people. Its an impressive cake. Used baker's Chocolate.

This was so delicious.  I made it for a holiday get together and it was a hit.  It is REALLY rich, the chocolate topping is almost too much.  It really does taste like a buckeye!

Oh, my!  Great for those days when you need a chocolate fix!  Decadent and rich!!!  I would actually consider this more of a pie or a candy, rather than a cake.  The chocolate is so overpowering (in a good way) that I might try doubling the peanut butter layer the next time.  You really don't taste the peanut butter flavor very much.  The namesake candy for which this recipe takes it's name actually has more peanut butter flavor and less chocolate.  Either way, you can't go wrong.  It's delicious!

This recipe was soooo goood.   Very easy to prepare just a little timely with all the cooling and refrigerating so give yourself sometime.  In fact, I think it was better the next day so you can make ahead.  Tastes like gormet coffee shop or tea room dessert.   You only need a small slice because it is so rich so this dessert can feed many people!!  I will make it again!!

This is fantastic!  Made it just like the recipe said and it turned out wonderfully!  It is very rich so I cut the pieces very small and everyone loved it.  People were surprised that I had made it because it ended up looking so professionally done that they thought it was store bought.  Making it again for Christmas!
