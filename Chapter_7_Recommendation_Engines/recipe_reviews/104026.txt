Wonderful tea, the only thing that could make it better is if I didn't have to boil the water.
For my taste I put in 1/2 to 1/4 of the sugar and get twice the sweetness.  Splenda seems to disove more easily, evenly, and readily especially in hot water.

Being diabetic I am always looking for substitutes for old favorites and this fills the need perfectly! Thanks so very much! It is also good with various flavors of extracts to give some taste variety.

Not bad. We still prefer using sugar.
