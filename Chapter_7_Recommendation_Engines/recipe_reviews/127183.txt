This is a beautiful dish, and I enjoyed the paprika even more than I thought I would.  The recipe doesn't specify, but I used what I thought was an appropriate, fragant smoked Spanish paprika which was really, really good. I used the amount called for even tho' I thought it might be too much for me, but it was just a lovely, delicate smoky flavor that also lent color to the dish. Same with the chili pepper flakes - I thought I'd be sorry using the amount called for and nearly chickened out. Glad I didn't - that, too, was just right.  I prepared this with one alteration, which was simply to wait until the shrimp was nearly cooked to add the garlic, since garlic and high heat don't mix and burnt garlic is just plain nasty.  In deference to the title I chose dry sherry rather than lemon, and because I welcomed the opportunity to do something other than lemon for a change.  I served this alongside a tossed green salad which made for a lovely, fresh, light but deliciously satisfying meal.

A terrific tapas. Quick, easy, delicious, using only a few ingredients that work beautifully together. Drank a Spanish white wine from the Basque region, Xarmant Txakoli. It's a fresh, bright, lowish alcohol white that's slightly effervescent. A great complement for this.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I served it with brown rice and roasted brussels sprouts (recipe is on this site). It didn't need as much oil as stated and I wish I had used less.  I added two extra cloves of garlic and will add more red pepper the next time I make it.

Delicious!  Used Marsala instead of sherry.  Excellent accompaniment to our Pasta Pomodoro dinner.

Queen of Random Dinners here! :) this was super quick to throw together for the protein component of our dinner tonight. My boyfriend picked up (a little too much) corn on the cob for me from a local farmers market, so I made some of that and was looking for things we had on hand that I could make up to go with it. This fit the bill! No measureing, just looked over the ingredients and went with it. I have a great smoked spanish paprika that I love to use and it really shined in this recipe. I opted for lemon juice, simply because I keep forgetting to grab some sherry... lovely recipe!

Phenomenal!!  Quick and easy, loved it!  I used smoked paprika instead (love it!!), but otherwise, did not change a thing!  Excellent...would be great served over rice or pasta, although I served it alone.  Anyway you slice it, scrumptious!!

We really wish we hadn't wasted shrimp and scallops in this recipe :(  We enjoy spicy, but the heat of the red pepper flakes was all you could sense, and that's with using a scant teaspoon!  Unfortunately, we couldn't taste the garlic, the dry sherry, the seafood, or anything else.

I really enjoyed these, but boy were they spicy!  I think next time, I will decrease the red pepper just a bit.  I used the sherry in mine, but really didn't taste it.  (Though, I think my mouth was just on fire too much to taste anything).  I had them left over the next day, and I tasted the sherry then.

This was pretty good and very easy, but it just needed... something.  I served it over basmati rice.  I might try it as a marinade (or with sherry instead of lemon juice) next time.

This dish turned out just ok.  I used lemon juice instead of sherry and the lemon overpowered the other flavors of the dish.  Like another reviewer suggested, I will wait to put the garlic in until the shrimp are almost cooked because the garlic burned which likely changed the overall flavor of the dish.  I steamed some frozen broccoli in the microwave and mixed it in when the shrimp were just about cooking.

Made this with scallops. It was okay, but nothing special. The taste of the sherry didn't really come through, nor that of the garlic. The red pepper flakes seemed to steal the show, and not in a good way. Surprised that this recipe is supposedly from Spain (where I lived for more than a decade) as it was quite spicy (and I know how most Spaniards feel about the "p" word (ie. picante).

LOVED LOVED LOVED!! I used 1 lb of shrimp and also added 1lb. of bay scallops. I doubled the olive oil and added a tbsp of butter, but put the paprika and crushed red pepper as if it were a single recipe. Glad I did because it was still spicy! I served over penne and it was a huge hit in my house!

Amazing! I used the sherry, and I thought this recipe was perfect. I am a mildly spicy person, and it was not too hot at all to me; just the right amount of zing. The sauce was so good, I kept licking it off the spatula from the pan afterwards. My husband loved it too, he said it tasted like restaurant food. Lol! This is going to be one of our regular meals now. Yummy

This was good; I added half butter half oil because i like the flavor butter gives to the food.   I think I'd omit some of the paprika next time because it overpowered everything else imo!.. All the other flavors worked well though!

Fantastic recipe! I added a pinch more of the red pepper flakes and I used hot smoked paprika instead of regular paprika. I love spicy things and with the hot paprika it was perfect! I paired this dish with Ballet of Angels which is a sweet dry wine and found it was the perfect combination of Spicy Sweet!

I really liked this.  I used ground red pepper instead of the flakes, using a little less than the recipe called for because my husband doesn't like too much spice.  I don't know if the ground kind has more heat than the flakes, because it still turned out very spicy and he couldn't eat it!  I thought it was great, but I love spicy food.  So I got the whole pan to myself! :-)  Also, instead of either/or, I used both lemon juice and sherry.  I tried it without the lemon juice, and think it's better with it.  Thanks for the recipe, I'm munching on the leftovers as I type this!

Very tasty! Used just a tad less red pepper than the recipe calls for so it had a kick but wasn’t too spicy. Also waited to add the garlic until I added the shrimp as others suggested so the garlic wouldn’t burn or caramelize too much and lose its flavor. I also used lemon juice instead of sherry and it added a very nice, light flavor. Paired with jasmine rice & a fresh garden salad = the perfect summer dinner!

Overall I really enjoyed this recipe but I should have read the suggestions of other reviewers before preparing it. Then I would have known to add the garlic at the end. Because it was added at the beginning the garlic was way overcooked. I used sherry and next time I will probably double the sherry, reduce the olive oil by half and add a T of butter to the oil.

This is extremely easy to make and I love the spicy kick of the dish.  The oily sauce is great with warm crusty bread.  I chose sherry instead of lemon.

Delicious! It was nice to change up my usual garlic and lime shrimp. I didn't have any sherry, so looked up a substitute and used vanilla extract. I am interested to try it will sherry and see how it differs. Will definitely use this recipe again!

A very quick and easy recipe.  The paprika gives it such a nice aroma and you can adjust the pepper to your preferred level of spiciness.  I used a bag of frozen mixed seafood for variety.

Very simple and delicious to make for a main meal. Instead of sherry, I've used marsala cooking wine.  It tasted great and scrumptious. I've used leftover rice from when I made with leftover Swedish meatballs this week. I would love to make it again.

Great, easy recipe - good amount of spice without being overpowering. Served on top of rice.

It was delicious.  I made it with the lemon juice.  It helped to have lemon wedges to give it an extra zest.  Next time I will try the sherry.

Way too much red pepper flakes, next time I will cut it to 1/2 tsp. or less.  I used lemon juice rather than sherry.  Next time I make it I will add a 1/2 to 1 cup of white wine to give more juice to serve over rice.  Excellent tasting receipe.

Used lemon juice instead of sherry - liked it though it's not a recipe I'll likely make frequently.

I didn't add the red pepper because we don't like hot spicy dishes.  But that shouldn't have made a big difference.  I just thought the flavor was unexciting... basically paprika.  The garlic did not seem to make any statement.   It needs a sauce other than just  oil and sherry, paprika and garlic.  We did not  use the oil/sherry etc.on our rice.  It looked like pure oil.

I made this as written with the exception of reducing the amount of pepper flake a little. I deglazed the pan with dry sherry. The shrimp was served on a bed of orzo. What a tasty dish. It definitely made my to make again list.

I made it with calamari and it came out wonderful I put it on a bed of fresh spinach. I did tweak the recipe some to suit my taste but this was a good foundational start.

This was really good and quick! My whole family (with the exception of my picky 2 yr old) loved it! I used small size frozen shrimp. I made it with Saffron rice and it went well with it. I will be making this one again and again. Thanks!

Tasty, fast, and easy recipe which I served over bow tie pasta with grated parmesan cheese and roasted vegetables. Trying to be healthy, I cut the olive oil to 1/8 cup which likely increased the heat factor a wee bit. Next time I will try this recipe with the specified amount of olive oil and maybe increase the dry sherry a little bit too. Very tasty.
