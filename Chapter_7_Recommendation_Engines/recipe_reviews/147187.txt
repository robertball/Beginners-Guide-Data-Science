Absolutley amazing!  I make these almost everyweek and they are so good!  My husband adores them.  Dont make the patties too thin though because the cheese will leak out while your cooking them, and make sure you seal the edges well.

These were good, but the kids didn't enjoy them much.  I thought they were great, very tasty.  Probably not the best option for picky kids and husbands though.

This was a very good recipe!!  My husband loved it and so did I.  I used miracle whip instead of mayo and chedder cheese instead of the other because that was what I had on hand!  I served it on garlic taosted buns with tomato, onion, lettuce and the sauce.  Delicious!  I will be adding this to my recipe file.

It was ok, the flavor was overwhelming. I probably won't make these again.

This recipe is my new favorite. My husband and I loved it. I made them on my George Forman grill and it worked really well, but  I don't think I sealed the edges enough because alot of the cheese melted out however it only took 25 minutes to make!

These burgers were awesome. I made some with ground turkey and some with ground beef. They were all great and there were no leftovers!

Good flavor.  Mine however, fell apart on my indoor grill.  Still good though.

This was delicious! I will definitely make it again in the future. I did find that it fell apart a bit when I was grilling it up so definitely add breadcrumbs or egg so the meat holds together better. Other than that a definite keeper.

This is the best burger recipe. My extended family loves the burgers and they are a standard at family bbq's. The accomplanying sauce is also great!
