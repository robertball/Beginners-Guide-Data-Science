This is an excellent dressing! It's lighter than I expected and the flavor didn't overpower my salad.

This was excellent! I thought it could have used just a little more vinegar but hubby said he thought more vinegar might have overpowered the delicious flavor of the roasted peppers. This was super fresh tasting and nothing like what you get out of a bottle. I highly recommend this recipe. Thanks for sharing!
