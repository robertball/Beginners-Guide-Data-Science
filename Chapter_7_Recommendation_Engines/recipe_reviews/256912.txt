Made according to recipe, except I was concerned about the amount of spice so I only used half of the chipotle chili pepper in the sauce. Definitely a different taste. Worth making it again using the full amount of the chipotle pepper.

Loved the burger and the sauce! So good! Everything comes together quickly, so it makes for a quick weeknight dinner too! If you've never had buffalo meat before; give it a try with this burger! You won't be disappointed! (Oh, and I also topped the burgers with sauteed onions---definitely would do that again!)

Awesome burger, prepped the sauce and burgers mid morning and everything was a snap to complete for dinner. I halved the recipe with no problem at all.  The burger cook time was right on, and the flavor of the burger and sauce combo, with the snap of Dill pickle was perfect!

The spices are delicious! My kids loved them, as well. The cook time is perfect, as is the size of the burger. I will definitely make these again!

We're from Colorado, so had to try this recipe! The seasoning for the bison was perfect, as was the sauce. We served it with a pasta salad, some corn, and pineapple. Definitely 5 star!!

This was really good! I've never had bison before and we loved it! Even my 4 year old ate an entire (mini) burger. Instead of using garlic powder, I used ground fresh garlic using my mortar and pestle for both the patties and the sauce. The sauce was really good and will be great to use again (especially if you're in a pinch and are out and don't want to run to the store). I used garlic oil on the buns and toasted them in my CIO for about 2 minutes per side on the medium grill setting. Then I grilled the burgers in my CIO on medium for 4 minutes per side adding some cheese for the last minute. We served it with the pickles and sauce only and they were perfection. Really pleased with these buns and the recipe.

Great burger!   I especially enjoyed the sauce and I think that it could be one of my go-to BBQ sauces.   I want to make this sauce again, but with the addition of brown sugar to give it that sweet smokey flavor that I like so much.

We LOVED this bison burger!  The meat is perfectly seasoned, and the sauce is terrific!  The package of bison I got was 12 ounces, so I made two patties out of it but next time would definitely make three to fit the regular size of Ball Park buns.  Even with the thumbprint in the middle of the meat before I grilled it, it still puffed up quite a bit.  I cut the recipe to 3 servings to get to 2 (not sure why this problem with the serving sizes), and to make up for the added meat I used generous helpings of seasonings.  I used chipotle powder rather than the pepper itself.  Do yourself a favor and make this one soon!  Thanks, Ball Park Buns!  You have a winner in our estimation!
