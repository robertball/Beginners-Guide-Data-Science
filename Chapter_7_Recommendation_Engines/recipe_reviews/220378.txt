Very nice taste, and it rose up and achieved a nice puffy result. However, the cream cheese did not add anything at all to it, so I would totally eliminate it next time. The cream cheese chunks did not melt, just remained exactly where you placed them before baking, browned on top, and actually did not have much taste. The end result looked like toasted marshmallows on top. For someone like me who does not make French Toast but likes it a lot, this was a good recipe and one I would make it again.

To turn this recipe from 4 stars to 5 stars I made a couple of changes:  Mix the cream cheese with some sugar and cinnamon to taste and blend it by hand or with a mixer.  Spread the mixture on the bread you're using (I used cinnamon-raisin bread) stack the "frosted" bread 3 high, then cube it.  I also used real maple syrup.  It is so much better this way as there is cream cheese in every bite and it is sweetened.  1/2 cup syrup just was not enough sweetness for this big batch, IMHO.  I tried it the original way and I prefer it the sweeter way.

Fantastic and easy to make. I didn't have french bread at home, so I used regular white bread. Also, I softened the cream cheese and spread it on the bread and then cut it into pieces before placing it in the casserole dish. My kids love maple syrup, so I added 1 cup with 1 cup of milk with 6 eggs with 1 tbsp cinnamon in my 9 x 9 pan. Very moist and tasty!

So tasty and easy to make. I omitted the cream cheese for calorie reduction as per another review and increased the maple syrup slightly.
In the morning I did gently fold it over to incorporate some bread pieces that did not appear coated with egg. It was so simple for a gathering. I put into an 11x13 pan and it fed 8 people as part of larger brunch with ham and fruit and I have leftovers. Look forward to a test of reheating it for breakfast another day!
I will make this again. Everyone loved it.

I really liked this recipe a lot, but I must admit that I didn't follow all of the rules! I needed to make something quick and yummy for a faculty breakfast and I needed to make it the night before. I used a whole loaf of French baguette (16 oz.) and as I was chopping up the cream cheese, I thought it was a bit much. I ended up using just one 8 oz. package of the cream cheese and it turned out great. I also had to put it in the oven after only about 30 minutes of refrigeration with the egg, and it still turned out great. I also added a can of drained blueberries to the top for a little something extra. I got lots of compliments on this recipe and brought back an empty dish!

I cut this recipe in half to fit a square 8x8 baking pan. I did add a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and a half teaspoon nutmeg to the egg mixture. I also used REAL maple syrup. This was okay--quite soggy, maybe because it doesn't halve well? The only one who liked it was my seven year old and he asked for seconds.

Made this for supper with sausage patties and applesauce. I used double bread and no cream cheese. Also used double syrup and cinnamon. This was good and tasted just like French Toast but I would only make it again if I was needing to entertain guests while it baked.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving brunch and it was perfect! I did not use the cream cheese, just a personal preference. I also used sugar free syrup, which I increased to 3/4 cup. I am planning to make it again for Christmas morning.

THis was delicious!!! So easy because you can make it the night before!! I made sure that the whole bottom of the pan was evenly covered with bread, which means I added more than in the recipe. I then cubed the cream chees put that on top of the first layer of bread and then filled in all the rest of the pan with more bread so it was an even layer across. I added probably a cup of maple syrup instead and two teaspoons of cinnamon. It tasted as good as it smelled while it was cooking. Heated up some real maple syrup and drizzled on top. YUM!

This turned out great!! My husband has celiac disease so I made it with part gluten free bread in a separate dish and part regular loaf bread. I also used 1 less egg, which I recommend using just 8 eggs total, as it came out really eggy. I also added a dash of nutmeg and a teaspoon of vanilla.

Made this using GF bread and used dairy free Carmel coffee creamer, I also added DF creamed cheese. Very rich but yummy. Even my “I only eat gluten and dairy” people liked it.

This was very good, I followed other people’s suggestions and used only 1 package of cream cheese and in small chunks I think 2 packages would have been way too much, I also upped the cinnamon added nutmeg and vanilla extract without adding the vanilla and additional spices I feel this would have been very bland.

Loved this recipe. I doubled the eggs, and also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla extract and a little dark brown sugar to the batter. Kept in the oven on 375 for an hour. I absolutely loved it.

This was very good. It would have been nice to know to maybe spray the pan with Pam cooking spray. I was left with a pan covered with baked on bread and eggs. Other than that it was good. I'll make this again but will grease the pan with something next time

I cut corners and made a few alterations to this recipe AFTER making this the first time. Based on my families feedback here are my changes:
2 loaves cubed Pepperidge Farm cinnamon swirl bread.
(Substitution for original recipe French Bread loaf)
Philadelphia Cream Cheesecake filling (substitute for cream cheese) only use half the tub layered in between cubed bread. 
*omit maple syrup in the cooking process (serve warm on the side -very sweet)
Reduce eggs to 8 LARGE eggs. If you have small or medium size eggs, then use 12. 
Mixed into the full 2 cups of milk. Bake on the recipe settings, no overnight set needed. 
Turns out deliciously every time!

This breakfast is a tradition in my family every christmas morning. I followed other suggestions and coated the bread with the cream cheese which kept out the huge chunks of cream cheese. I also accidentally halved the whole recipe without halving the amount of bread. My husband (who did not grow up with fond memories of this meal) said it was the best he had had.

This was such an easy recipe to make! I took this to a brunch school function and received multiple compliments. There was nothing left in the pan when I left.
