PLEASE FELLOW AR USERS, PLEASE DO NOT RATE A DISH WHEN YOU HAVE ALTERED THE RECIPE AS IT DOES LITTLE TO HELP OTHERS THAT WISH TO TRY A POSTED RECIPE.  :D  Don't want to come off like a butt but it drives me nuts to see a posted recipe than a user saying deleted this/added that/changed this to that UGH  I made it as listed and while magical is not the word I would use I would call it a refreshing twist to the standard egg salad recipe.  The addition of steak sauce brought a nice flip to the standard and came off well.  I would definitely use this again. I substituted boiled fish heads for eggs and added a light balsamic glaze while mixing  JUST KIDDING  I followed it as listed and it was pretty good.

Excellent. I didnt have sweet relish opened and didnt want to struggle with the big jar for such a little bit so I chopped up a big dill pickle and used it. This was good and a new twist on egg salad.

This was way better than the mayo-relish-s&p egg salad I usually make.  The dijon mustard and splash of steak sauce give it a little tang and a lot of taste (I omitted cayenne for my toddler, so no comment on that).  The only thing I might add next time is a bit of diced onion.  Thanks Emily!

I was intrigued about the unique combination of ingredients in this egg salad recipe, but in the end it just didn’t appeal to me.   Apparently what intrigued me, the combination of sweet pickle relish, Dijon (way too much of it at that), steak sauce and dill wasn’t a good combination for me.   It’s always interesting to try something “outside the box” but in this case I’m glad I only made a small batch of this.

this is delicious although I had to increase wet ingredients for more moisture. I used potato masher to chop up the eggs to save time. Flavors went well together. Not your usual boring egg salad. Give it a try!

super quick and easy and it's creamy and delicious - I didn't have steak sauce so I used 1 tsp of worcestshire sauce + 1 tbs bbq sauce. Hint: Instead of chopping the eggs, just use a potato masher. I should have cooked the eggs for 1 or 2 minutes longer because part of the whites peeled off with the shell.

This is an excellant recipe.  The only change - I added some chopped onion.  I loved the extra flavor the mustand and the stake sauce gave it. I am sure I will be making this again.

Fantastic egg salad! Pretty close to how I normally make it, but the addition of the Worcestershire gave it that little extra something. Will make this version from now on!

This recipe was awesome. My boyfriend loved it. The steak sauce is a brilliant idea. I didn't have relish so I substituted it with a chopped pickle, which gave it a great crunch. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best egg salad we've ever had!  However, I did modify it a bit...  I added finely chopped onion, chopped water chestnuts (for crunch) and didn't add the cayenne (for the child).  Awesome!

It really was very magical, and by far the best recipe for egg salad on this site. I quest (for ten years now)  for the perfect egg salad recipe and think this may be it with one caveat, be careful of the salt as it appears to be a staple of steak sauce. I added 1/4 teaspoon of salt, "to taste",  tasted, and wow was it salty. Also, I always add chopped macademia nuts for crunch and it is possible that this did me in as they always come salted. Still, I feel like I am one step closer to the perfect egg salad, thanks for posting.

This is a great recipe. I love making egg salad but wanted to try something a little different. I loved the spiciness of it. I would not change anything about it. Thanks!

This recipe is quick to make and delicious. The steak sauce is an awesome addition. None of the ingredients really overpowers the others, it is well balanced. I will definitely make this again!

AMAZING! I believe they use this sauce (minus the eggs) for dipping chicken tenders at several restaurants in the area!! I've been trying to duplicate it forever!

No changes made and I will not be making this again and I'll tell you why.   The color of the salad was an unappealing yellow, the texture was more of a loose topping, and the taste wasn't that great either.  Enough.

Because we do not like sweet pickles, I used equal amounts (maybe more) of chopped garlic dills. I also added a little garlic/onion powder. Interesting but delicious egg salad. My son and I shared it and we both really enjoyed it. I will make it again.

Delicious and super easy.  I put a couple extra diced eggs in mine as it seemed very saucy.  It wouldn't have been bad as originally written, just not the consistency for my personal preference.

I like all of the ingredients but together it just didn't do it for me. I would increase Mayo, reduce Mustard and cut steak sauce in half.

I made this egg salad today as stated and we found it had a bitter taste, so did not like it. I added another egg and more mayo until the bitter taste was gone.

I love egg salad and thought I would try this twist. It was good but far from my favorite. I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out pretty runny. I think that's what killed it for me. Next time I will add a couple of extra eggs.

Excellent egg salad! Had to leave out steak sauce because I didn't have any. The flavor was still amazing. This will be my new go to egg salad recipe!

Hands down best recipe I have had in years. Watch the quantities as mine came out kind of soupy. Still tasted great but I will cut the liquid part and maybe the mustard as the mustard taste came through a little too much. Still it was great.

Delish.  I too added some chopped sweet onion and used chopped dill pickle.  This was great on grilled French bread.  The steak sauce (A1) really adds something.  I would have never thought of this.  Thanks!

I doubled the recipe.  I didn't change a thing except for the dill - only used half of the recommended amount (as I am not a huge fan) and didn't add salt (there was already plenty with the steak sauce, mustard and relish).  I personally thought that the Dijon was a bit overpowering, so I will definitely use less next time.  Good stuff - will be better (for my personal taste, of course) after I make my own additional tweaks.

Although it was good, it was a bit too tangy for my taste.  I also agree with another reviewer that it was too runny.  If I make it again I'll leave out the relish.

This was really delicious!  Left out the cayenne and subbed dill pickle (since we didn't have relish), but the steak sauce and dijon make it delish!  I believe I cut back a bit on the mayo as well and it was still very creamy.

It was too much dijon mustard. I backed off on it a bit per other reviews and it was still too strong. I'd make this again but probably just use a couple tsp of the dijon next time.

Flavors seem good.  This method of cooking the eggs did not work at all for me though.  Egg whites were still a little runny, and yolks were not cooked through, resulting in a soupy mess.  I will  try it again with a differed method of cooking the eggs.

An interesting twist to "plain old" egg salad.   The only change I made was using fresh dill weed instead of dry and omitting the cayenne pepper.  I  did not feel that the salad needed additional salt as the steak sauce added plenty.  I will definitely make this again as even my picky kids enjoyed it.

This is a fabulous recipe made special, I think, by the use of the teaspoon of steak sauce! I didn't have dill when i made it and it still turned out great.

Was good, not much different than how I usually make it.  I cut back a little on the mustard and omitted the sweet  relish but followed the recipe otherwise.  Couldn't taste the steak sauce at all.  Would make again adding some onion and a little more steak sauce.

Enjoyed this recipe! Next time I will use more mayo and less of the steak sauce, halve the mustard and relish. I used A1 steak sauce and I don't know if that made it taste so strong. This is personal preference of course. I would have never thought to put steak sauce in but it really adds a little bold kick. I will make this again.

My wife wanted egg salad so I found this recipe, which is quick and easy. I made it and she said, "Wow! This is really good! What did you do differently?" To which I responded, "It's magic."

I didn't quite have all the ingredients on hand, so as other commenters suggested, I substituted a chopped kosher dill pickle for relish, and worcestershire sauce + bbq sauce for the steak sauce. I used 'country style' dijon (which I like better), and mixed in a bit of finely chopped shallot. Delicious!

Eggsellent! Egg salad brought to a new level! I subbed Worcestershire for steak sauce because that's what I had and yay! for sugar free sweet relish for low carbers!

Just made it, and I think it tastes great! I didn't have dijon mustard so had to use regular yellow and used a dill pickle in place of relish, but it's still pretty tasty. I took the advice of others and added some onion- great idea! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Amazing! Ive never made egg salad before and this recipe is easy and I made it with stuff I had in the house! I used spicy mustard due to not having dijon and no dill. It was still fantastic! I added Worcestershire sauce as well. Everything was perfect...in the past I HATED egg salad...then I tried this one, and even I will munch on it!!

Typically, I love a traditional egg salad and didn't think that I'd like the extra dijon flavor in this recipe. However, I was surprised. It has a lot of flavor and tastes great!
