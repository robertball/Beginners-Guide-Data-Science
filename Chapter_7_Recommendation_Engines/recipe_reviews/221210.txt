Perhaps I really adjusted this recipe, but I really didn't think this soup was that bland.  I used Cajun Seasoning instead of Creole seasoning--what I had in the house.  I don't have chicken bullion granules; what I do have are bullion cubes, so I used 1 can of chicken broth and 4 cups water with 4 bullion cubes.  I know that ups the sodium but the last time I checked, it was a cup of water to a cube.  At any rate, I also added onions and garlic--I don't know how to cook without garlic.  I popped this in the crock pot using peas and celery instead of carrots since I didn't have those either, and hubs added chicken later on.  It turned out rather spicy and flavorful, and he keeps gobbling it up.  Thanks for the recipe!

I keep taking another bite because I'm surprised at the lack of flavor in this soup.  It smells much more flavorful than it actually is.  I followed the recipe, though I did add sweet corn, onion,  and a bit of ham base, hoping to increase the flavor intensity.  It didn't work.

This soup is excellent!  I love spicy foods and found this perfect.  My husband loved it too.  I made the following tweaks, added some chopped up ham, added one can Rotel, doubled the chicken boullon, added peas and corn. I also omitted the can of tomato paste.  I think my hubby is going to be begging for this every time I make a ham from now on.

The family enjoyed it. It was a nice change from the ham and beans I usually fix.
