I cut the amount of water in half (I thought it might end up mushy) and it worked out really well.  Sometimes I add corn kernals to the mean/bean mixture.  I recommened using ready-to-bake lasagna noodles.  My family loves this meal!  Even my 5 year old ate her whole plate!  Still tastes great heated up for lunch the next day.  REMEMBER TO CUT THE WATER FROM 2 CUPS TO 1 :)

This is exactly like our family recipe, and it is a hit every time, with everyone who's ever had it.  My favorite thing about it is that it is SO simple.  You don't have to brown beef, or cook noodles ahead of time - just put it together and pop it in the oven!  I always make it exactly like instructed.  One tip to make it even simpler - instead of measuring out or buying the spices, just add a packet of taco seasoning mix.

We loved this recipe! It was an instant hit.  I did make the suggested changes, used 1 cup of water and added cheese at each level.  My husband hates olives, so we added black beans instead and it tasted great! We also added HOT taco seasoning to the beef and pre-cooked the beef because we like spicy recipes.  It was wonderful!

This was great tasting, but I wasn't sure about the beef. Was I supposed to cook it before or during? I pre-cooked it. It didn't state anything about that in the recipe. Also, you should double all the ingredients or your not going to have enough to cover your 9x13 pan, or you could use an 8x8x2. This  did taste really good. Thanks for sharing it with us.

Took others advice using taco seasoning, pre-cooking the noodles, omitting the water, adding a can of diced tomatoes, using 2 cups of shredded pepper jack cheese for more kick.  Turned out delicious!  Very easy recipe to substitute with what you have on hand and alter according to personal taste.

Made this last night. It was a huge hit! I did make a few minor changes. I browned the beef with a large chopped onion. Instead of the seasonings, I added two pkgs. of taco seasoning and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I made 3 layers instead of two.(15 noodles). I also added about a quarter of a cup of chunky salsa to the beef itself to make it just a littlt bit moister. Instead of piquante sauce, I again used the salsa.I used four cups of cheese instead of three. One cup between each noodle layer and one for the top the during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking time. It is important to let the lasagne rest about 20 minutes to allow for easier cutting. Excellent!!!

Very good, very easy.  I made mine with taco seasoning the second time because it needed a little more flavor.

this was a good easy recipe. i also cut down the water after reading reviews. i make my regular lasagna like this- don't cook the noodles and don't buy the expensive precooked noodles. this would probably be good with chicken instead of beef and green chile instead of picante. lots of possibilities.

THIS IS DELICIOUS! It doesn't cut too well because all the juices make it a little bit sloppy- but I don't mind. If you want to bake it in half an hour: Cook the beef and beans in a pan and add half a can of tomato sauce. I also add salt and then half a packet of taco seasoning for flavor instead of the seasonings. I used the thin lasagne noodles and cooked them till al dente then layer all the stuff. I added tomato and olives to each level, as well as cheese. Cooked until the top noodles were crispy and then added more cheese and olives, and tomato sauce (hunts canned traditional) to make it super juicy and moist. THUMBS UP!

A real crowd pleaser! I do add some chopped fresh cilantro to the sour cream mixture. I never bring any home and I'm always asked for the recipe.

Love this recipe! I added a chopped onion & garlic salt to the ground beef as it cooked to give it a little extra flavor. The sour cream & olive mixture on top is delicious!

This recipe is just like the original Mexican Lasagna recipe posted on the site, but it's still great. It's easy and great. Even though I didn't have all the ingredients, I made it anyway. Easy to substitute. Easy to prepare. Just needs 1 1/2 hour in the oven. I love easy recipes!

i love this recipe, and make it often.  i'll add olives to half the pan to appease the non-olive-eating hubby, but so the kids and i can indulge.  i often sub taco sauce for the salsa - the kids are chunk-phobic so everything has to be smooth in order for them to even try it.

Really easy and good!  Husband loves it!  Used 1 can Rotel, 1 1/4 cup salsa and 1 1/4 cup water.  Also used pepper jack cheese and put a layer on top of each meat/bean layer.  Omitted sour cream/olive layer because husband doesn't like it.  I topped my portion with ff sour cream and chopped cilantro.  Will definitely make again!

This was very good. I cooked my beef before adding the refried beans & I used 3 cloves garlic and 1 package taco seasoning. Never used the oregano or cumin. I used 1 cup water and only 1 cup sour cream. Put it in a pan a little smaller than 9 x 13.

Delicious!!! What a perfect recipe! I put the cheese between each of the layers of noodles, and also added a can of diced tomatoes with Jalapenos, which I spread out between each layer. Also, I took the foil off and broiled it for the last 7 minutes to melt and brown the cheese that I put on top! I will definitely be making this again!

Fabulous recipe. I did change a few things. I added a can of tomatoes with peppers and I used a pack of toco seasoning instead of all the spices. I layerd sour cream and cheese into every layer. Turned out great!! My family loved it!

This was good but I changed it a little. I eyeballed the garlic powder and cumin (added a lot more than the recipe called for) and also sprinkled cheese over the first layer of meat/beans. Also used way less sour cream. We enjoyed this. Thanks, Janeae!

Make sure you get some sour cream mixture on your fork or else it taste like beef/bean/pasta mush.. The dairy on top made all the difference.   Definitely think the filling needs more flavor..   I used A cup less water.. I think that was a good move.   also I think this at least an 8 serving recipe.. not 6!

I made this for Cinco de Mayo party and everyone loved it!  I used ground turkey breast, fat free refried beans & reduced fat sour cream to try and make it a little healthier and you would never have known.  I added another layer between and put salsa in it.  I also topped half with jalapeno slices before melting the cheese at the end for those who like a little more kick.  I will definitely make it again.  Many asked me for the recipe!!!  Thanks for a great recipe

Like other reviewers, I cut the amount of water in half and it worked out very well.  I also eliminated the refried beans and it was enjoyed by all.  Thanks.

I really like the versatility of this recipe. I used ground turkey, and I cooked it with taco seasoning. I did not boil the noodles and it turned out great!

This was good!  I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could.  I was confused about the noodles and water- so this is what I did and it turned out perfect.  I used the NO BOIL noodles, dropped the water down to 1/2 cup, BUT I also added a can of diced tomatoes.  I also used taco seasoning and put cheese in between every layer.  I only baked it for 1 hour but it probably could bake a little longer (we were hungry!).  I will be making this again!

This was good.  We ate it all but it seemed like it was missing something.  Maybe I should have used a picante sauce with more of a kick to it?  It just didn't have that kick to it that I was hoping for.

This is EASY and GOOD - if you are using regular lasagna noodles DO NOT CUT the water.  It comes out perfect.  Like some others I tweaked the seasonings a bit and I always have to add more cheese because of all the rats at my house!:)

I'd give this a 4 for flavour, but an overall rating a 3. The mix of beans and meat is great (I used lean ground turkey instead of beef). The idea of sour cream and olives is also good. The main problems with this dish are the cooking method/time and the size of the final dish. Next time I will precook the meat, and then add mix it with the beans. I will layer the sauce, undiluted, between each layer, and pre-cook the pasta. As always, I use whole wheat pasta. I would add many more spices; even though I added more this time, it was not enough. Finally, I'd add some cheese to the layers instead of having it all on top, for a better balance. I would also add layers of cooked vegetables such as bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms. The lasagne turned out very flat, almost half the height of every other lasagne I've made.

Either I'm real hungry or this is the best meal I have had in a long time!  My whole family liked this one.  The best part is the fact that you don't cook anything ahead!  Thanks for the great meal Janae.

My kids loved this. It was easy and delicious. I cooked the hamburger to get rid of some fat and then added taco seasoning and the beans together while still warm. I used half the amount of water and added cheese in-between layers. I will definitely use this again, Thank You!

This is a GREAT dish. I did make a few changes to it....I cooked the beef with diced onion and taco seasoning before adding it to the mixture. I also added a can or corn. Cut the water from 2 cups to about a 1/2 cup otherwise it is sloppy. I put cheese between each layer and served the sour cream cold on the side with salsa and chips (instead of adding it under the cheese)....oh yeah and no olives for me! Enjoy!

This was very good.  I will make it again, but next time I will put some of the picante sauce on the bottom of the pan to keep the noodles from stiking.  Also, it might be good with shredded chicken too or instead of ground beef.

This was really good and easy to throw together. I cooked the beef ahead of time. I only needed three lasagna noodles per layer because I bought the Barilla ones that are "rolled flat" (and therefore more wide) and say that they don't need any pre-cooking. I added a little bit of cayenne pepper to the mix, and I think that this recipe would benefit from a bit more salsa. I used all Monteray Jack cheese and omitted the sour cream and olives. My husband added some sour cream separately to his portion, but I thought it was fine without. I think layering some cheese in is a good idea, as others have suggested. I'm sure I will make this again.

This is an easy recipe that tastes very good.  As others noted use only 1 cup of water instead of 2 as it says and the consistency is perfect.  For my husband and I, next time I will add a can of jalapenos because we like spicier food.

Excellent dish!  I halfed the water to 1 cup and added a packet of taco seasoning to the ground beef.  I also added one can of Mexican Rotel tomatoes just to spice it up a dish.  I will definitely make this dish again.  Hubby was talking about this dish for days and said it's now on his "top 5" requests for dinner!

This turned into a waterey soupy mess when I made it.  It is a good idea but I think the amount of water and salsa would need to be adjusted in order for it to turn out ok.  I don't think I would make this again.

The concept was great however I used taco seasoning instead of the spices. I added fresh minced tomatoes with the scallions and black olives before the cheese.  It has a nice flavor however my kids wouldn't touch it.. too many colors to digest..ha

I wanted to make something that did not make me have to go out to the store.  I happened to have most of the makings of this recipe at home with the exception of replacing refried beans with black beans, and picante sauce with salsa and it was absolutely delicious!!  My husband loved it!  It is a keeper!

This tastes delicious and I love that you don't have to pre-cook the noodles!  I did only give it 4 stars, however, because- like other reviewers- I think there is too much water in the posted recipe.  I used a slightly smaller dish (8x11) and just 2 cups of picante (because that was all I had) and it was still pretty watery even with just 1 cup of water after an hour-plus baking time.  (I do, however, realize now that the long baking time is more for water absorption than to cook the meat.)  I served this with a salad and cornbread and my family just loved it.  All in all, a great dish!

We really enjoyed this and it was so easy.  I did brown the ground beef first and added a small amt of mexican blend cheese to each layer (I still used 2 cups cheese total).  I also only used 1 cup of sour cream and 1 can of olives.  Next time I'll try using taco seasoning.

The recipe doesn't say to brown the beef first, but I wouldn't try it any other way. I browned the beef and then added the beans and spices. I also added some minced green chiles for a little more kick. I used 2 cups of salsa instead of picante and left out the olives. The dish was ready in an hour, but maybe that's because I used 9 lasagna noodles instead of 12. For the cheese, I bought a package of shredded Mexican cheese. It's good, but next time I'll use less water because it was a little runny.

This was great! I used shredded chicken instead of beef. I also added 1 tbspn of chili powder and 4 ounces of diced green chilis to the chicken mixture to spice it up. To make it a little lighter I used lowfat sour cream. Excellent. Will add to our regulars.

I made this for my grandfathers birthday dinner and I was not that impressed with the lasagna noodles. I have been told that their are corn lasagna noodles available so I will have another try or will improvise with corn tortillas. The rest of the flavor was really good. I precooked the meat and boiled the noodles and baked it for about thirty minutes just enough time for the cheese to melt.

I added cheese between the layers and jalapeno's and jalapeno juice to the sour cream.  I made it to spicy for me but husband loved it.  It would have been great without changes.

I thought this recipe was terrific. The refried beans withthe spices gave the ground beef tons of flavor. The Picante sauce and water were just enoughto saturate and soften the pasta. the olives and sour cream were a nice touch and the cheese on top really worked. 1improvement would be to add some cheese to each of the layers to give it a stringier consisency and cheesier flavor.

This recipe is absolutely my favorite ever!!!!!!!! It was fantastic!! But, I did give it 4 stars since I made some exceptions. I added taco seasoning to the beef. I layered every ingredient except for the sour cream and green onions. I only used one can black olives, and in it's place I used green onions. (This gave it a bite)I also added about a cup extra cheese. You can never have too much cheese! This was really, really good and there is a ton left over!!!

I thought this was a great dish. I made it with ground turkey instead of beef, and I did not precook the meat- it turned out fine. I also used all 2 cups of water called for, and layered the salsa/water mixture on top of each layer instead of all on top, thought it would cook the noodles better. That also worked well, and it did not turn out soupy at all. When I took it out of the oven to put the cheese on, it looked a little watery, but after I cooked it another 10 minutes and let it cool, there was no excess water to be found. Did not use cumin, didn't have any. Didn't turn out too spicy, which was good for my spice-sensitive family. Thanks!! Will make again!

This was excellent.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I made some changes.  I followed the advice of some others and cut the water down to only 1 cup.  I also eliminated the spices and cooked the meat with a packet of taco seasoning then added an additional 1 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of chili powder.  I also substituted chopped green chilis and fresh scallions for the olives.  The meal came out perfect.  Also, I noticed that the number of servings listed as 6 servings, this will serve alot more and is perfect for potlucks.  I will be making this again!

This was actually a really good dish.  My boyfriend gave this recipe a "thumbs up".  I made the recipe low fat by using extra lean beef, fat free cheese, and fat free refried beans.  I also added chili powder to give it extra spice.  i had read on other reviews to cut the water in half and I tried that but the noodles started to become hard so I had to add the rest of the water.  The mixture did come out a little watery but it was easy to solve-I just poured out the excess water and everything was perfect.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It was too bland for my taste.  I like more flavor and kick to my dishes.
     I added equal parts water and hot sauce. I did not cook the meat. I mixed the meat, refried beans and spices like a meatloaf. There was plenty of meat mixture to spread on the two layers. It is an easy dish to make and good for those who don't like spicy foods.

Ugh!  The actual taste of this dish was okay.  I added a grip of onion and used taco seasoning to the meat.  I cut the water in half and ended up with half soft noodles and half hard noodles.  I will never use this recipe again.  My boyfriend disliked it so much he went and grabbed a bowl of cereal instead.

I made a vegetarian version substituting soyriso which is a non-meat chiorizo sausage and it was great. I finished the dish under the broiler for a minute to brown the top. Also added some chopped mild green chilies on one layer.

I made this recipe and my whole family loved it. I followed the advice from some of the reviews and added taco seasoning. I also used half a cup of hot pepper sauce instead of picante sauce because I don't think you can get it in England. I cut the water down to one cup and it was still a bit soggy so I would recommend only using half a cup. All in all it was a good recipe and I thought the olives went really well in it.

The taste was TRULY GREAT, even though I really goofed up this recipe.  I divided it by 3 in order to make 2 servings.  Since I wanted to make 3 layers of noodles in an 8-1/2 x 4-1/2 inch glass bread loaf dish, I only used 3 (instead of 4) noodles.  My butcher was too generous with the 1/3 lb. of meat, so I only used 1/4 can of refried beans.  I also cut the required 2/3 cup of water in half, as others have suggested.  All this was fine and good.  BUT I USED THE WRONG KIND OF NOODLES!!!  I read the "uncooked noodles" to mean "no-boil noodles"!!!  I used 3 Skinner's oven-ready noodles, and it turned out WAY too soupy.  (Thank goodness I had cut the water in 1/2.)  I can't wait to make this again with regular old-fashioned lasagna noodles, since the flavor of this is SO GOOD!!!

I also used less water, and I also put the shredded cheese in between the layers instead of just on top.  Turned out great.  Added sourcream to each serving rather then the entire casserole.  Reheats better this way.

This recipe was awesome. I made it for a "Mexican" dish potluck. I prepared it last night (using only 1 cup water as the reviews suggested), and re-heated it today. It was a hit! Thanks Janae for posting this one.
