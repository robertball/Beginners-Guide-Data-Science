The cheese dip served in Mexican Restaurants consists of Land O Lakes processed american cheese (can be found at Wal-mart's deli and there is no sub) and half-and-half. That is it. Oh and grate the cheese instead of cubing. It melts nicely. I have searched and searched for this as well. Yummy usually I add jalapenos or a can of green chiles.

was craving cheese dip and i'm so glad i found this recipe! using evaporated milk and flour hadn't occurred to me. I added canned green chiles and not so much salsa due to what I had on hand. I think I used too much tumeric so next time I'll tone that down to my tastes. This is wonderful!

I am looking for the cheese dip served in Mexican restaurants throughout the southeast. This is NOT IT. The texture was funny (I could "feel" the flour) and the spice totally overpowered the cheese. Maybe I would have been less disappointed if I wasn't trying to find a particular result.

I loved this dip and so did my husband I did change the salsa to a fresh cup of pico de galo (available in grocery store already chopped) and added chopped jalepeno peppers for extra spice.I also used sharp cheddar and monterey jack mixture instead of pepper jack since I added my own peppers. Great recipe!!!!! a must have in your box!!!!!!!!!

This is an excellent dip! My husband likes his dips a little spicier so I just added some jalapeno seeds in with the flour and tumeric and it came out perfect. Will definately make this again. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is MUCH better than jarred queso I used Cabot pepper jack and a medium salsa and the heat and seasoning levels were great! To top it all off if you can make a simple cheese sauce you can make this dip!

I was also not impressed with this recipe and felt it tasted too floury (even after giving it plenty of time to cook off the flour taste). I also felt it was too spicy and not "cheesy" enough.

Followed recipe but the cheese still was not melted smooth. Could be the brand of cheese I used. Anyway my husband made this on a couple of times and he loves it and kicks up the heat by adding more hot sauce.

This is a super easy and yummy dip. It has already been requested by some of my friends. The pepper Jack cheese gives it a little kick and I feel sets it apart from other cheese dips.

This year I planted jalapeno peppers and never having planted them before I did not realize how many peppers a single plant will yield. I have 15 plants out in the garden and have been looking for recipes to use them in. I substituted the pepper jack cheese with 8oz of Mexican shredded blend and 8oz of cream cheese omitted the turmeric butter and lemon juice and heated the evaporated milk with 12 seeded and diced jalapenos in the microwave until boiling. Then stirred in the cheeses and a teaspoon of flour and microwaved for another minute or two. Stirred in salsa. Excellent!

We really enjoyed the smooth texture and it was just the right thickness to dip without a ton of drips everywhere. Added a few fresh diced jalapeno just because I had them.

I wish this had more flavor and I personally didn't find it spicy at all. It was creamy and easy to make. If I made it again then I would start by adding spicy salsa and/or fresh jalapenos.

Poor poor. Hated the consistency. Will have to stick with the Velveta Italian sausage and hot Rotel. Just icky. Sounded good... make a roux with butter add cream cheese salsa salt and pepper to taste. Didn t fit my taste at all. Sorry.

Im in 10th grade and i took a culinary class. The ingredient my group had to use was 4 jalape√±o peppers. I looked online ans found this. Im not one for hot foods but i would definitely recommend making this.
