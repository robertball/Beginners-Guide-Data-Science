It was delicious!  The only changes I made was I added a bit of chili powder to the breadcrumbs and baked it in a foil lined baking tray @ 350 for about 30 mins instead of frying it.

Very good recipe but could use a hair more flavor.  I baked mine (no pan frying at all) at 350 for 30 minutes, after dipping in milk then rolling in the bread crumbs.  Next time I will double the jalapenos, and also add some garlic salt and/or onion powder to the cheese mixture.  I will also dust the outside with garlic salt, to get a little more flavor out of this dish, but the recipe is a great starting point and probably great for those with less heat-tolerance.

My fiance gives this 5+ stars! I cut the recipe down to 1 serving and since my fiance is a jalapeno and spice lover, I used one whole jalapeno, which I left the seeds in. The only other change I made was to only fry this for a few minutes, just until the the breadcrumbs browned a bit. Then I baked at 350 for 20 minutes on a wire rack. This will be a "make again". Thanks! :)

This was so good!  I added bacon into the cream cheese mixture and I also baked it. The spice of the jalapeno and the smoky bacon made a delicious combo. Also used low fat cream cheese and homegrown jalapenos.  Will definitely make this again.  My boyfriend couldn't get enough.

Okay, I have yet to try a recipe from this site I haven't enjoyed making and eating!  This recipe was no different!  IT WAS OUTSTANDING!  We are partial to spicier foods, so I added extra doses of Jalapeno peppers, plus added paprika, black pepper and crushed red pepper to the bread crumb coating.  I also opted to bake it instead of the pan fry.  It was cheesy and spicy spilling from the moistest chicken! My kids had seconds and my husband thought this would be a hit at his fall football gathering!  I made it again for my parents who don't eat the peppers, substituting mushrooms and asparagus tips with the cheeses, and garlic salt and mustard seed in the coating.  Great alternative.  A recipe I will for sure be making again!!!

Excellent and simple, if you don't mind frying - and I can not imagine that a baked version would turn out tasting as good! Even Mr. "I hate yardbird" loved it. Used flash-frozen chicken filets, thawed them, and basically butterflied them in cutting a pocket because they were pretty skinny filets.  Filled the "pocket" with a seeded, intact half of a jalapeno instead of mincing the pepper, and couple TBS of the cheese mix. Held them together with toothpicks, and used a pan that can be soaked clean! The chix was preseasoned (roasted garlic); the cream cheese was a combo of what I had - whipped cr ch and onion/chive, with shredded cheddar/monterey jack.  I did pre-cook the peppers in the microwave after cutting/seeding - one minute zap.

This was awesome! The chicken was a nice balance with the jalapeno. It tasted just like Jalapeno Poppers!

This idea was good.  I had to work with a thinner portion of chicken, so I had to roll the "stuffing" up like a log almost and then roll in the seasoned bread crumbs, and I cooked it in the oven.  Was good, but needs something on the outside of the chicken, or more seasoning in the bread crumbs I made.  But the idea was great, and will just have to do something different with my bread crumbs and season the chicken for next time.

Apologies in advance: Tweaking ahead. First I wanted to bake it to make it healthier. I love the concept of the jalapeno stuffed chicken breast so that is why I am reviewing with tweaks, rather than post my own. Other than baking it at 375 for 20-25 minutes, I also added some cooked bacon to the cream cheese mixture, and I coated the breading with Frank's red hot....BUT I am sure this as is would be just as good. Thanks for the idea!!

Delicious!  Even the hubby gave it five stars, which says a lot. I did cheat and put the filling on top of the cutlets, because I wad running late making dinner.  I also added bacon bits into the filling.  Next time, and there will be one, I will allow enough time to stuff the chicken.  Definite keeper!

Since everyone said their filling was oozing out and did not have flavor, I halved the cream cheese (4 ounces), but increased the jalapenos.  I used a Mexican cheese mix.  I also mixed in some red pepper in the cheese mixture.  After stuffing the chicken, I then dipped it in egg wash, then panko breadcrumbs with chili powder.  I then baked it at 350 for 30-35 minutes.
With these changes, it was close to a 5 star recipe.  This was very yummy and easy, but a bit time consuming.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe! I wrapped the individual stuffed chicken breasts in tin foil and then baked them at 350 for 30 minutes like others suggested. Some of the filling oozed out of the chicken breasts, but they were still yummy. We will definitely make these again.

This recipe has become one of my favourites! The only things I change is add extra jalapeno for a spicier kick and I use crumbed pork rinds as the breading to make it extra low-carb. A little mixed herbs and parmesan added to the crumbs, then baked instead of fried. YUM!

Great recipe, thanks for sharing.  I loved it, and next time I'll kick it up a bit by adding more jalapeno to the filling, or red pepper to the breading.  I dipped the chicken in egg before breading to help the breading stick.

This was yummy. I pounded the chicken breasts real thin then filled and rolled them, held it all together with toothpicks. I did not fry,but sprayed with oil and baked. The only thing was the leftovers the next day weren't good. Not sure why,but the first night straight out of the oven was great. I made this along with Mexican sour cream rice from this site.

Unbelievably tasty!  I baked this on a foil lined pan @ 350 for 35 min.  Before baking I drizzled a little melted butter over the chicken, but otherwise kept to the recipe.  So good my husband & I ate 2 breasts each!  Tastes just like a jalapeno popper.

Made this for dinner and it was amazing! I opted to bake it in the oven (personal preference). I have made chicken before with fillings that always seem to bubble out, so I was anticipating this, no matter how hard I tried to secure with toothpicks. However, I had quite a bit of the filling left over, so what I did was the following: Instead of rolling the breasts in breadcrumbs, I put some of the filling on top of each of the breasts (just used a spoon to smear it), then sprinkled the breadcrumbs on top. I also seasoned with a bit of garlic powder and onion powder and a touch of cayenne. This recipe is a keeper!! *I found this recipe when searching for popper recipes. I found a copycat recipe for the sauce that Arby's gives you with their poppers, and had a bunch of that left over and was trying to find something to use the sauce with. BUT: this recipe was good by itself and didn't even need the sauce! I actually preferred it without the sauce.

AMAZING!  I followed this recipe to the letter (well, used stove top stuffing for my seasoned bread crumbs . . ) - which I usually do the first time trying one.  I agree with the reviewer who said to secure the seams well - I found it to be tricky.  Next time I may try them with bacon like another reviewer did.  This one is a keeper!  (we also put the leftover filling on crackers as an appetizer)  :o)

I was not impressed with this recipe at all. Everything oozed out of the chicken breasts and they take a lot longer to bake than 30 mins at 350. It was lacking flavor and the photos shown are not at all what it turns out to look like

We loved this, and I will definitely make this again. I did make one major change - I baked instead of fried. I used an egg wash (to help retain moisture) then applied crumbs and baked at 375 degrees for about 30-35 minutes. I drizzled a touch of olive oil on top of the breadcrumbs as well. For my family, baked was a must and I don't believe that anything was lost. Thanks!

Wow!  This turned out so delicious, and it was super easy...The only changes I made were that I used turkey breast cutlets (that's what I had on hand) and I baked them to save some calories.  They still came out great, and I didn't feel bad "too full" after dinner.  Today I took some leftovers in to work, and one of my co-workers was eyeing the container with envy! LOL  I made this with gandules verdes rice and some spinach sprinkled with goya vegetable seasoning...added a beer with lime for an epic dinner.  Thanks for the great idea!

fantastic. i added chopped green onions and a few pieces of crumbled up bacon into the mixture, and also baked it at 350 as opposed to pan frying it, and i will most definitely be making this again soon. also, the leftovers are just as good the next day when reheated, so its great for someone to take for lunch to work, etc.

Made a great appetizer. I used the method for this to make my own dish, I used the cream cheese mixture on top of bite sized cooked chicken and wrapped it in a crescent roll then baked it, so good, such a hit.

Great flavor!  I bet it would also make a sensational dip by shredding the chicken and mixing it all together.  Thanks!

OMG! This is a delicious spicy (but not too spicy) dish. I was a bit nervous about making it as I was gonna roll the filling up in the chicken rather than stuff it. I made sure I pounded the chicken good and rolled filling up in it and baked it for 30-40 minutes at 375 degrees. Turned out PERFECT! What a tasty dish - it is a keeper!

this is a goood start of a recipe but works better if you place the chicken breast on a platform and poung flat with a meat tenderizer put the jalapeno mixture in a log form then roll the whole chicken up then one toothpick if needed then roll in crumb mixture I think it works better this way other then that it's an awesome tasting thanks for sharing.....

My first time trying this, and i loved it. Tastes so juicy and the jalapeño mix was awesome. 
Definitely keeping this recipe.
The only think i would do differently is leave the veins on the pepper, to give it that kick.

My husband absolutely loved this! I thought it was pretty good but needs more seasoning on it. I think this recipe is worth trying just add some spices to it. (:

Really good. I had a hard time with the consruction of it. I ended up just folding it in half and putting a few toothpicks in it instead of cutting a pocket into it (mine were really thin). Worked out pretty good this way, some of the middle stuff came out but overall very tastey!

This was really good. Next time I will buy thicker chicken breat. I had a hard time cutting them to make the pocket. So on some of them I just did little pockets all over the chicken and it still came out great. I baked mine at 350 for 30 mintues. Next time I will use an extra jalapeno to make it a little more hot! I alos added a little cumin to the cream cheese mixture.

This was good! I added extra peppers to take up the heat as my husband likes spicy. I made a mess out of trying to secure with the toothpicks- but that is not the recipe's fault but mine. Chicken was moist, flavor was good! We enjoyed!

YUM!!!!  This is our new favorite chicken!!  I added bacon bits and some garlic powder to the cream cheese mixture just like when I make jalapeno poppers.  I used boneless skinless thighs because that's what we like, and it was absolutely amazing!  Thank-you so much for this recipe!

I made this according to the exact recipe instructions and it came out very good. Here are some things I will possibly change next time. I thought it was a little bland, so more jalapeños next time. In fact I think I'm going to double the amount. Also more cheddar cheese too. Instead of rolling the chicken in bread crumbs I think I might use crushed nacho cheese Doritos or cheese Its.

I didn't have any cream cheese so I grated some swiss. I also marinated my breasts for 4 hours in pickle juice. I make my own pickle juice (no pickles) specifically for marinating chicken. Once you try this you will never marinate chicken another way!
I baked instead of pan fried - at 350 for an hour. Came out wonderful. Next time I will up to 375 so it bakes faster. Used the pocket method vs pounding thin and rolling. Filling stayed inside the pocket with 3 toothpicks each breast.

The filling itself was DELICIOUS.  I saved myself some time and just dumped a whole jalapeno (stem removed) into the food processor with the cheeses rather than mincing it.  The final product was just ok with the chicken- not worth repeating for our family.

This was delicious.  Like several reviewers stated it is not as spicy as you might imagine.  Next time I will kick it up a bit.  I also chose to fry to brown the breadcrumbs and then bake.   I like One reviewers suggestion of switching out jalapeños for asparagus and mushrooms so will try that next.  Overall a good recipe.  Thanks.

This was excellent. I have the most picky husband on the face of the planet, and got so bored with the foods he would actually eat. Convinced him to try this one and it was a huge success for the both of us. I followed others advice and baked it on a foil lined baking sheet for 30 minutes at 350, as well as doubled the jalapeños, and added cayenne pepper to the bread crumbs. Absolutely wonderful. Adding to my favorite recipes cook book!

I sort of tweeked this recipe and a hungry panda recipe and made 2 types of jalapeno popper chickens for a dinner party that was a hit! I scooped the seeds out of full jalapenos and added cream cheese. I then rolled chicken breasts around the jalapenos (I advise flattening the chicken, even though I didn't and it wasn't totally necessary, it was just harder to roll around the jalapenos). I then wrapped bacon around half the jalapeno chickens and the other half I dipped in bread crumbs and topped with pepperjack cheese :-).

Hubby loves  Jalapeno Poppers! So this was a no-brainer recipe to try! 
I followed the suggestions of a few people and added some cooked & chopped bacon to the cheese mixture, topping it with Parmesan & cheddar cheeses. I also used canned diced jalapenos and low fat cream cheese because that's what I had. Rather than rolling the breast around the cheese mixture, I cut pockets in the chicken breast (not all the way through!) and stuffed the mixture in the pocket. I had flattened the side opposite the pocket so that the stuffing and pocket remained upright throughout cooking and wouldn't run out. I also baked the chicken to be healthier.
Served with Chef John's Cottage Fries and Cherry Crisp a la Mode for dessert.

Fantastic recipe!  My husband and I limit our carbs, so I made the following modifications:  I eliminated the breading all together.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika.  I followed the recipe for the stuffing and added crumbled bacon to the mix.  I stuffed the chicken with the mix, secured with toothpicks, and baked the chicken at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Even without the breading, the chicken was moist and delicious!  A keeper for sure!

Very good and baking it on foil made it very easy. I did add Garlic powder and Old Bay seasoning to the bread crumbs. Turned out perfect. A keeper for sure.

I had trouble getting the chicken cooked all the way through and I ended up having to bake it for about 10 minutes. Next time I will pound out the chicken a bit more so it's not so thick.

Amazing!!!  Tastes just like the appetizers!!  I used low fat cream cheese as well as low fat cheese and it was still awesome.  I also baked mine and put just a slight bit of butter on top of each one.  They came out so great and were very easy!  Highly rec.!

AMAZING! Just got done devouring this and I'm quite impressed. I doubled the jalapenos since I like things a little more spicy but the cream cheese really balances out the jalapenos well. Perfect quick dinner :)

I used monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar and it needed a little boost of flavor although the jack melted really well. I think next time i will do a 3 cheese blend w/ pepper jack, monterey and cheddar.

I'm addicted to poppers, so O....M....G!!!! I'm pretty sure this is the best chicken recipe i've had to date! i only changed a little bit of it, but it would be great without the change. instead of 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese, i mixed cheddar and pepperjack cheeses. and then i added a little cayanne pepper to the cream cheese mixture. LOVE THIS!

Everyone thought this was pretty boring, maybe not enough jalapeno?

This turned out really good!  I added green chilies to it.  I didn't fry it the whole time as I don't really like fried foods.  I did fry it for a couple of minutes to make the bread crumbs crispy then I put it in the oven at 425 for about 30 min.

It was alright. Hubby and I thought it tasted a bit bland. Maybe needs more seasoning or some green chillies.

This is very good, but they're pretty rich, so you can't eat much of it.

This turned out excellent.  The only thing I did different was after browning the stuffed chicken breasts in oil, I then put them in the oven to continue cooking.  Tastes very much like poppers!
