This is a great recipe.  I bought packaged coleslaw from the supermarket and then added the onion and dressing.  It is the best tasting coleslaw I've ever had and I'll be throwing away my other recipes for coleslaw and only using this one!

I use this recipe (with less sugar when I'm eating it) for nearly all of my raw vegetable salad dishes.  Sometimes I chop cucumber, carrot, crushed garlic and tomato and add the oil, vinegar and sugar.  For spice, I might add one or more of the following: chili pepper, herbs de provance, oregano, celery seed, pepper flakes, ancho chili powder.  When making the slaw with cabbage I use the red kind because it's so beautiful but it does need to to sit for a day as the cabbage needs time to absorb the acid of the vinegar and breakdown some of the "rubbery squeakiness" on the teeth.  I also add about a teaspoon of some fresh herb (yesterday it was parsley).  I think it needs some green herb.

Quick and easy, and mmmmm so good!  I eat it as soon as I'm done making it :)  ps.  for those of you who don't like to use a lot of oil, it tastes just as good with less oil (approximately half).

A good and easy alternate to regular creamy coleslaw, for variety, I added about 1/2 tsp. of ground mustard, a little less sugar than what the recipe calls for, and some honey.  MMMMMM.

Right now, I'm giving this recipe 4 stars but I think it will become 5 stars.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and reduced the oil and sugar by 1/2 and used taragon vinegar (3/8 c. rather than 1/4 c.).  I also added salt and pepper.  It was very, very good but I think I would prefer it with regular cider vinegar.  Next time I will try that and post the comparison.

I was looking for a good alternative to my creamy slaw that I usually make when I came across this recipe.  I used a 16oz package of slaw mix, cut the sugar down to 2 tbls, and used just shy of 1/4 C olive oil.  I also added some sea salt and cracked pepper to my taste, 1Tbls honey, and 1 tsp celery seed.  This is a great base to "play with"  The first taste was so good, I can't wait to taste it after it's been sitting overnight!

I will never make traditional mayo based coleslaw again after making this. I followed the recipe to the letter so I can fairly rate the recipe, ok, not true, I added salt and pepper to taste. This recipe is wonderful, a keeper, so thank you for posting it.

this was an amazingly good and amazingly easy recipe. I'm not a big coleslaw fan because I don't like mayonnaise. My husband was making dinner and had already shredded the cabbage and carrots (he used Napa cabbage). He asked me to look for a dressing for it and this was the first I found. I didn't add the onion, but I bet it would be good, and made the dressing just as written.  I used apple cider vinegar, since they didn't specify. Some reviewers have found it too sweet, but I thought it was perfect! I was so happy to have a non-mayonnaise dressing that was so good! I will definitely make it again. It's much healthier than the usual and so good. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that I just don't like cabbage that much.

This is a great recipe as is! For fun I added some celery seed and a teaspoon of hot curry powder. As another reviewer said - this is a great base recipe as is - but the possibilities of having fun with it are endless. Thanks for the recipe!!

After 35 years, my husband told me he didn't like my mayonnaise based coleslaw and wished I would make it vinegar based.  So this is the first one I tried.  He liked it much much better.

This wasn't like normal coleslaw, so don't go into it thinking it will taste the same! But it had an interesting flavor and went well with ribs and baked beans. I used apple cider vinegar and about half the amount of oil (I used sunflower oil) and half the amount of sugar. I wish I could have left out the sugar altogether, but it was necessary to counter the tartness of the vinegar. Altogether a good recipe for non-mayo-eating people who like BBQ :)

Great!  The hubs doesn't like mayo or mustard, so cole slaw was never an option. But I thought this recipe sounded yummy, subbed in rice vinegar, cut down the sugar as suggested, and thought it was a great light + easy side for our grilled chicken dinner!  To be perfectly honest, the hubs wasn't a huge fan, but he's not generally a fan of any veggies except raw carrots -- but he added Italian dressing and was good to go :D

Perfect and easy - I try to avoid demon refined sugar so I'll skip the sugar, use half the oil and use sweet red onions to give a bit of sweetness back.

If Balsamic didn't ruin the aestehtic I'd use that instead of regular vinegar...the tarragon idea was great!

I’ve been looking for a coleslaw recipe that didn’t use mayo and this one fit the bill perfectly.  It is quick and easy to make and has a light refreshing taste.  I like a dressing with a little bite so I only used 1/2 the sugar.  Next time I will use even less as it was still a little too sweet for my taste.  I also pre-mixed all the dressing ingredients and then poured it over the salad.

I used the ready mixed broccoli slaw so I didn't need a carrot.  I did use 1/8 cup sugar as some of the others have suggested.  This was the perfect blend of sweet and tart.  Very good recipe that we will make again and again.

I hate cabbage but I thought this was pretty good. I gave some to a friend and she said it was ok but preferred the mayo kind....

If I get more cabbage I'll probably try this again...

I am dieting so I substituted  a little less Splenda for sugar and added caraway seed plus salt & pepper. My family thought it was great and they are not on a diet.

I had to add a little extra vinegar and celery salt to get the flavor right for my husband and I. Very good!

This is a very good basic recipe, but a bit too sweet for me, so start with less sugar and add to taste.  I happened to be out of veg oil, so I used 1/8 C olive oil and 1/8 C almond oil, which gave it a wonderful nutty taste.  I also added 1/4 tsp Coleman's mustard and some ground celery seed. Yum!

This is a great slaw.  Used 1/8 cup lightly flavored olive oil, subbed 1/8 cup Agave for sugar and used half green and half red cabbage.  Very good!

Loved the vinegar flavor to this!  I served it on pulled pork sandwich.  I used a bag of pre-shredded cole slaw from the store.  I think it was equivalent to more than a head of cabbage, but still used the same proportions for everything else.  Very good!

I subbed red cabbage, which was delicious! I cut the sugar in half, and it was still sweet to my taste. Added 1/4 cup more vinegar and fabulous- thanks!!!

This recipe needs a little something else.  Not as sweet as some and not as tangy as the southern kind that goes with BBQ.  I'd have to side with those that said it is nothing special.  Maybe I will try again with rice vinegar as some suggest.  Thanks for contributing the recipe though!

I mixed Splenda and sugar half and half and just poured the oil (less than called for) and vinegar over the packaged cabbage mix with the sugar mix on top.  Had to go out the next day and buy twice the amount because everyone complained they wanted more. This is so easy and delicious.

Very weird tasting on its own. Add 1/2 tsp salt and it's perfect. Otherwise just tastes like marinated veggies, not slaw.

I prefer a more savory coleslaw and less sweet, so I omitted the onion and sugar, then added about 1/2 tsp. of pepper, and about 1/2 tsp. of salt. It was great!

I use a couple of chopped up green onions instead of generic onion, also 1 chopped apple (skin on), substitute apple cider vinegar for generic vinegar, cut back a tad on the sugar and add a touch of honey. Nice fresh flavor.

This recipe is acceptable but unremarkable.  Its a bit bland.  I made it because I wanted something healthy and low fat.  I used less dressing than suggested and like others I cut back on the sugar.  I used more veggies also.  I used a red cabbage, more carrots, red pepper, cucumber and this made it look better and its healthier.  I am going to look for a dressing which is also low fat and calorie but a little tastier.

I didn't like this at all! It wasn't tangy or tasty enough at all! I buy a vinegar & oil coleslaw at the grocery store and it is delicious, but this one just didn't cut the cake for me, sorry.

I didn't use vegetable oil. I thought it would make it oily.  I used mayonnaise, 1/8 cup vinegar because the vinegar is too strong and less than what the recipe calls for the sugar to the taste. I don't like really sweet coleslaw . I loved it.

I gave it 4 stars. Because it needs just a little salt.  I split coleslaw in half and added a teaspoon of mayo and a sprinkle of celery seeds to half. Hubby and I have different tastes. Might consider red onion next time. It tends to have a subtler taste.

I had half a large head of green cabbage and packaged carrot shreds. I needed to use up a few sweet peppers I had on hand and red onion. I took everyones advice and cut the sugar in half, used white balsamic vinegar, light olive oil and I added caraway seeds and Mrs Dash seasonings. First taste was great, tomorrow should be even better!

Wonderful though we added a teaspoon of salt and pepper. We would add more vinegar and less sugar. We also added chopped bell pepper and green onion.

So simple and delicious. I used a low-carb sweetener and added a dash of salt, pepper and celery seeds. But it's brilliant in its simplicity, so you can tweak it a little and it still works. Thank you!

I used the exact ingredients the first time I made this. I'm giving it 4 stars because Hubs and I felt that there was a little too much oil in the recipe although it did seem less oily after it sat for a day. The comments that it should be made a few days in advance of serving were right on as the flavor did improve with time. I used an old Eastern European trick when I made it to release some of the water from the cabbage. Shred the cabbage, place it in a large glass bowl, then pour enough boiling water and salt over it to cover it. (About 2 quarts of water and 4 Tablespoons of salt) Let it cool for 30 - 60 minutes, drain in a colander, give it a quick rinse and press excess water out using a flat plate. Then add the dressing.

Easy to put together and very good! After reading the reviews, I reduced the sugar by almost half (and it still had sweetness to it). I used apple cider vinegar instead of the regular type. For more flavor, I added a little celery seed, garlic powder, salt, pepper and dried parsley. Nice change from mayo-based coleslaws. I'd make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Apr 2019 - requested by my fiancé and came together really nicely!  His initial thought on the first day was that there wasn't enough sauce but after mixing it and waiting a day - there was plenty.  I see myself making this often!

I love the simplicity of this recipe. And the fact that it is vegan friendly is a plus. I did substitute 1/2 tsp. onion powder in place of the onion itself. And I sprinkled some salt to enhance the flavors.

Yum! I was looking for a no mayo recipe and found it! I halved the sugar and oil. I also added a 1/4 cup of dried cranberries and added a little salt.

This recipe is delicious. I am so happy to have found it. If you dislike mayo based coleslaw this is the one you must have. I let my coleslaw marinade overnight and it was amazingly tangy(vinegar) and sweet(sugar). I followed the recipe as written with the exception of a little less oil. Will make again and again.

I made this exactly as stated  using a 1 pound package of precut coleslaw mix. I made it the day before so the flavors could marry. It was delicious and hubby liked it better than my favorite mayo based dressing. Very refreshing. The dressing was not enough for my husband. Next time I will double the amount of dressing. I did not find it too sweet, and the sweetness level is why my husband prefers it. Very easy to make!

This, surprisingly, was very good. I liked the fact that it had no mayonnaise. Less calories and fat, but I did not put in as much sugar. One quarter cup isn't a lot, but I still thought it would make it too sweet, which it needed to cut down on the acidic vinegar taste. I used about an 1/8 of a cup and also since I did not have cabbage, I did substitute  a pre-shredded bag of coleslaw which also had carrots in it. I would make this again.

I just finished making this a few minutes ago and I'm having trouble leaving it alone long enough for it to properly marinate (that's with a "T", not a "D") and 'wilt'. I was looking for a recipe that wouldn't be too heavy and a bit different from my mayo recipe. This stuff is great! Okay, I did adjust a bit, but not so much as to completely morph it into a different recipe. I used 1 yellow packet of sweetener instead of sugar due to medical reasons and I used balsamic vinegar along with equal parts cider for added sweetness. I also added about 1/2 - 1/3 tsp of celery seed just because I love the taste in cole slaw. This might be my new favorite cole slaw recipe. Thank you for posting.

Thought it was a little too sweet so will cut down on sugar the next time I make it. I also added some mayonnaise at the end. This gave it a better flavor. Will use this recipe again. It was simple to make and my husband loved it.

Good coleslaw recipe. My guests loved it. I added cucumber to add extra crunch. I also added 1/4 cup of mayo to add a little but of a creamy texture. I recommend chilling the prepared coleslaw before serving to allow the ingredients to come together. I also used two pre-made bags of coleslaw mix versus using cabbage & carrots like the recipe calls for.

wow!  I literally made this 5 minutes ago and am eating it.  It's fabulous!  I was looking for a coleslaw recipe without mayonnaise because hubby's on a diet.  I think he will like it as much as I did.  I did listen to other posters who said they reduced the sugar by half - I also used rice vinegar.  YUM!

Made it twice in 2 weeks.  Didn't alter except bought coleslaw mix instead of shredding cabbage.  Love this with shredded buffalo chicken sandwiches.  YUM!

Made this tonight to go with pulled pork I had smoked. Everyone loved it, seriously, even the people who did they didn't like coleslaw. I used a rice vinegar flavored with roasted garlic, and only half the sugar. And more carrot and red cabbage. It was bomb. Never going to make creamy again.

I had a bag of packaged Coleslaw and I added sweet onion, sesame oil and apple cider vinegar... My husband was shocked how crisp and delicious it was.. we will not be making Coleslaw with Mayo anymore!  It's perfect for this hot summer days!!  Thanks!

Great slaw! I made this to top black bean burgers. I did follow reviewers' advice and cut the sugar and oil by half. I opted for apple cider vinegar using enough to equal the missing oil/sugar. I also made it a few hours ahead so it could marinate before dinner. It was perfect on the burgers and my teenaged boys finished off the leftovers.

Amazing recipe.  Didn't have sugar in the house, used 2 packets of Splenda instead, perfect! Used pre-shredded coleslaw cabbage in a bag so the recipe Couldn't be easier, and so delish!  Even better the next day after sitting and marinating.  Just added salt & pepper as the recipe didn't suggest that...but it was needed. Will be making this very often!

Light and refreshing!  I had a head of cabbage I wanted to use.  I normally make a slaw with a boiled oil and vinegar dressing, but wanted something quicker.  This recipe was quick and easy and tastes great without an overnight marinade.  I did substitute honey for the sugar (and think I could cut the sweetness back a bit).  I also added salt and pepper and a sprinkle of dry mustard.  (Surely, this recipe should have included at least salt.)  Glad to have a new "basic" recipe to work with.  Thanks!

I grabbed this recipe to make coleslaw for my husband never giving a thought to not having mayonnaise in it. When I put it on the table I thought he won't eat it. Well he did and enjoyed it. I will make it again.

As advised by other reviewers, I halved the sugar and oil. I added half a teaspoon of black pepper and used half an onion...the black pepper might not have made a difference (I couldn't taste it) but otherwise the recipe was great! Will make again.

Great recipe.  Definitely make this the night before and refrigerate to allow the vinegar to work into the cabbage.  Goes great with pulled pork.

Tweak Alert. We avoid white sugar whenever possible so I subbed same amount of honey. I also used red cabbage & red onion (what I had). Followed the recommendation of a buzzer and added a little horse-radish. Served this atop 'Slow Cooker Carolina BBQ' pulled pork sammie and it was the perfect accompaniment. Thanks TYRANGO

I tried it for first time and normally I do not eat coleslaw but thought I would try.  Wow I will now eat it with this dressing. Also so good I'm making it again to go with tomorrow's dinner. I also bought packaged coleslaw added a little grated onion and then the dressing. So awesome.

I'm trying to find more healthy options than the typical mayonnaise-laden potato salad, macaroni salad, and coleslaw from my grocery's deli case. I purchased a 14 ounce package of coleslaw mix (on sale for $0.99!), added about 1/4 leftover red onion, and roughly used the recipe above for the dressing. I used 3 T honey in place of the 1/4 C sugar, 1/4 c cider vinegar, 3 T olive oil. I also added a sprinkling of ground ginger and maybe 1 T of soy sauce, just to add a bit of Asian flair. It was delicious! This is my new go-to alternative to heavy grocery store coleslaw!

Delicious.  I heated the ingredients (oil, vinegar, sugar) and then poured over the coleslaw. It is quite sweet, some may prefer to use less sugar.
