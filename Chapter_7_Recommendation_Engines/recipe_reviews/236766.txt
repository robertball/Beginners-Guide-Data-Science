Made this with a 20 oz. package of cheese tortellini, a whole bunch of kale, and no meat. Also, didn't have any tomato, but did have a leek. Oh, and no LOL packets, so olive oil and minced garlic, some tarragon and basil. So with those mods, it came out really well. Sauteed sliced leek, then garlic, then mushrooms and herbs, then added the kale last. The flavors and textures blended well. My son isn't a fan of kale, so he gives it 3.5 stars, but my vegetarian daughter and I give it 5, so 4 overall.

Tasty. Couldn't find land o lakes squares so substituted 2 table spoons fresh garlic spread sold in Kroger bakery section. Great use for kale from our garden. A keeper.

I used butternut squash ravioli and asparagus because that's what I had on hand. My husband loved it and I had some buttermilk marinated chicken and that always makes chicken better??

Made as is with some kale I had gotten in a market basket and didn't know what to do with. Made as written, and my family loved it!
