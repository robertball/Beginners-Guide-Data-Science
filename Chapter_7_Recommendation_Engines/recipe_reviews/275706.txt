I've made this a few times, always with cooked chicken instead of the turkey and substituted rosemary for the thyme.

This was fantastic! I used broth instead of water and swapped the oregano and parsley for sage and rosemary (just my preference). I didn’t have the garlic base so I just added a clove of garlic. I was a little unsure about only cooking the vegetables for a few minutes in the sauce, so I sautéed them first. The biscuit topping really made this amazing! We had gravy and served it on top, yum!

I made a few minor adjustments in the seasoning, but not enough to matter to the base recipe.    Really cozy comfort food and a great way to use turkey leftovers.   The light and fluffy cobbler dough got beautifully golden and crunchy on top.

Considering I really didn’t have anything but the turkey, I improvised with a can of mixed veggies ( no Lima beans), a can of chicken gravy and mixed up something similar to drop biscuits with all the seasonings added to the mixture.

This was a perfect recipe for just the two of us.  I would say that it would feed 4 at most, as we did have a bit of left overs.  Some may like it and some may not.  We aren't into anything with too much sauce and this was a perfect recipe for that.  The cobbler topping came out really nice.  The success of a dish depends on how well received it is.  "Add this to the list!" means it was family approved.  I made this from rotisserie chicken instead of turkey, but it will be a great thing to make with Thanksgiving left overs this year!

It was easy to make & deliscious. I added leftover chicken broth instead of the water which I think added flavour.

So who doesn't love chicken pot pie and this variant kicks it up a notch on the easy scale by covering it with a biscuit (cobbler ) top.  My substitutions were a function of what I didn't have on hand.  No celery, or parsley so I substituted peas and frozen spinach. The flavour which is what its all about was great.  The recipe delivered what it promised so I gave it a five star.
