I followed this recipe, though since I was using more vegetables (broccoli and red bell peppers that needed used), I increased the chicken broth (and used stock) and used an entire carton.  I subbed white pepper for black.  Upon tasting, I found this to be a bit bland, so I added a good handful of shredded cheddar; this hit the mark.  As written, "3" stars; with the addition of cheddar, "4".  THANKS for the recipe!

Excellent and was a perfect quantity for two. Also, I used veggies broth instead of chicken to keep it vegetarian. Next time I will use shelled edamame instead of corn for a punch of protein.

I added a large stalk of celery chopped, a large jalapeno chopped finely, and a bay leaf. I would definitively make it again. We loved it!
