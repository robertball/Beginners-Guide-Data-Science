I used the recipe scaler to cut the ingredients in half so that it made one 9x13 pan full.  The combination of Mayo, cheese, and potato chips made this a greasy heart stopper that the taste just didn't make worth it.

I've had this dish before and loved it.  However, when I made it using this recipe and following it exactly (scaled down of course); I was not impressed.  I think that perhaps there is too much mayo used.  It was very soupy and greasy.

This was pretty good. My husband loved it, it had all of his favorites in it. I on the other hand didn't like that much mayo but it was edible.
