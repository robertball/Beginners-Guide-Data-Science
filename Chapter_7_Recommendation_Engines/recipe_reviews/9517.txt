I made the recipe as directed but they seemed very blah.  I decided to give it a 2nd try and made several changes.  To upped the eggnog to 3/4c, changed the vanilla extract to rum extract and to compensate for the added liquid I upped the flour to 2 1/2c.  The changes worked like a charm, the cookies were soft and chewy and very eggnoggy.  I don't know if the rum extract would have made the same impact on the original recipe but I'm not going back, the 2nd batch were gone in a flash!

this recipe was yummy but it needed just a little flare so I took 3/4 cup of confectioner's sugar with 1tsp of nutmeg and mixed about 3-4 tablespoons of eggnog into it to just make it slightly runny.  After putting it in a pastry bag with a tiny hole at the end I drizzled it over the cookies then sprinkled red and green sugar over it to give it a festive look.  It took a bit for the cookies to dry but it seemed to go faster when I put them in the oven that was barely warm after having it shut off from baking for a while.  YUMMY this way!

I did as recommended earlier and upped the eggnog to 3/4 c., and did rum extract (plus a little vanilla for good measure). I added some extra nutmeg and sprinkled plenty of cinnamon and nutmeg over the top. Tasty!

The recipe was not quite right until i changed the sugar to half dark brown and half white. I too changed the amt of egg nog to 3/4c and increased the flour by 1/4c. I also changed the vanilla to spiced rum (real thing) and topped with a wonderful egg nog flavored buttercream icing following recipe on box and also adding part spiced rum for the liquid. Its amazing how this changed the recipe. ENJOY

These cookies are delicious--slightly crispy, a little chewy, and a delicate eggnog flavor. I did bake as long as specified on the first batch, but increased the temp by about 10 degrees & baked for less time the second batch, because I like a little browner crust. I mixed nutmeg with sugar for the final sprinkle before baking. Smells & tastes like the holidays!

Great recipe. Everybody who tried them loved it, except my daughter. She doesn't like any cookies unless they have some form of chocolate in them.

A great holiday cook! I did change the baking time from 20-25 minutes to 8 minutes. I don't know if my oven is super hot but 20 minutes would have burnt the cookies. I also added frosting to some of the cookies and that was a big hit.

These are ok cookies, but I agree with others that they are missing something. I took the advice of other reviewers and upped the eggnog to 3/4c; even so, while the eggnog flavor is there, it's still fairly subtle. Increased the flour by 1/4c due to the extra eggnog.  I used unsalted butter, but added 1/4tsp salt thinking that might help the blandness that some commented on.  I also sprinkled with a mixture of sugar & nutmeg before baking.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Amanda Rose.

I found this recipe looking for a way to use up some of the eggnog still hanging around in the fridge after the holidays.  They were a hit with the neighbours with these changes; I used 3/4 cup of eggnog, 2 1/2 cups of flour and I omitted the ground nutmeg and used 3/4 teaspoon of ground gloves instead. I used 3/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and I sprinkled the cookies with cinnamon prior to baking.  EVERYONE LOVED THEM - THEY DIDN'T LAST LONG!

I tried a few different suggestions, playing with the amount of flour, etc. but could never get the consistency on these quite right.

I love these cookies. I do make a few changes, however, as mentioned in other reviews. In order to get more of an eggnog flavour, I use 3/4 cup of eggnog and 2.5 cups of flour to balance the additional liquid. I also add a full teaspoon of nutmeg rather than just 1/2. They turn sooooo good:)

These were great. I used pumpkin spice eggnog, and took the suggestion of upping the eggnog and flour. Everyone realy liked them. 
Thanks

These cookies are ok. My family didn't dislike them, but being the eggnog lovers that they are, they didn't love them either. I think the next time, I'll try with rum extract, and maybe bake them at 30 for about 10 minutes.

Bland, with a hint of eggnog flavor. Kinda like a spiced sugar cookie. 
Be sure to grease the cookie sheet!

I did not try these but I had lots of comments on them from eggnog lovers.  I liked them because they were very easy to make and I liked the long baking so I could get other stuff done while waiting.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies turned out light and airy.  Wanting to taste the eggnog, I used a dusting of nutmeg on top.  Watch the oven closely and pull out when the bottom edge turns light brown.  Try not to overbake.

The cookies were okay.  The nutmeg was a little overpowering.  Most people who ate them said they tasted more like an apple pie cookie without the apple.

These are an odd variation on a spice cookie, but they are fantastic (and ADDICTIVE).  They are creamy and spicy from the eggnog and nutmeg.  Will make every year!

These cookies are fantastic!!!!  I did up the egg nog to 3/4 cup and used quite a bit more nutmeg and cinnimon.  *(just added until i thought it tasted right)
And I sprinkled some on the tops too, before I baked them.  :D  YUMMY!

These are good with the changes suggested by others, adding extra eggnog, flour and nutmeg. (I used dark rum plus vanilla.) I would suggest using a high quality eggnog, that is thick and rich in flavor (and with the least number of unpronounceable ingredients.) I have on order Eggnog Flavor from Baker's Catalogue which I'll add to my next batch. I hope this will up the 'wow' factor.

These cookies are great!  I made a glaze to pipe on using 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 2 tbsp water.

These cookies were very simple and tastey, but they seemed like they were missing something. A nice, simple icing could have done the trick.

A crunchy very tasty cookie that is very easy to make.  These are great for gift giving since they don't easily crumble or stick together and have a great nutmeg flavor.  Bake them before company arrives and your house will smell like an old fashion Christmas.
