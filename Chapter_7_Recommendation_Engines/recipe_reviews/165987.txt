best I've found so far, ran out of triple sec though...  Also I used regular vodka because I also like traditional martini's, but I imagine I'd like it better with the citron. i used gran gala which is compared to grand marnier, although I've never had the fancy stuff so i cant say which is better. the rest the kept the same. thanks for the recipe the amounts were perfect and also easy to remember which makes me happy :)

You need to add 1 more part cranberry juice, otherwise it is too strong!

I added one more part cranberry juice and used 1/2 oz. lemon juice instead of lime.  Very very good and the second one tasted even better :)

THIS RECIPE SOUNDS WONDERFUL AS IS; however, I lacked some of the ingredients when I wanted to try it.  I used 1 oz fresh squeezed orange juice, tripple sec, grey goose vodka and cranberry pommegranete juice with twists of lemon and lime.  Loved the hint of orange flavor and citrus-- and it's not quite so boozie. (:D

I've been trying for some time to make a really good cosmo at home after my favorite bartender moved away. This is potent and delicious. Served it at a party and guests couldn't get enough and demanded to know the recipe!

Delicious! I used cranberry concentrate mixed with a little water because that is what I had on hand. It turned out very intense but, with a little more water, it was great. I also added about 3 drops of lime juice because I didn't have fresh lime for garnish.

My boyfriend and I couldn't get over how wonderful these martinis taste. We have found our new "it" drink for the summer :) Of course I didn't read the post about how the cranberry juice in this recipe should be doubled. And, yes, these drinks were killer-strong! Yahoo. And YUMMY for sure.

I  had a bottle of my favorite vodka in the freezer and cranberry juice  begging to be make into something  good to drink!  I added about 1/2 oz. of fresh lime juice since I  was using plain vodka.  It was awesome!  Best I have ever had!

I love this Cosmo!  I don't usually bother with the lime twist and I have regular vodka, but otherwise I made it as the recipe calls for and it's simply delicious!  I was making a similar recipe before but without the triple sec - adding the triple sec made it FANTASTIC!!!

I was concerned that the amount of alcohol would make this too strong for me but, by God, this IS the best I've ever had! I changed nothing and it was perfect! Thanks for sharing!

Very nice cosmo, not too sweet and refreshing.  I recommend increasing the cranberry to 1.5 oz and adding a teaspoon or so of lemon juice to sour it up a little.  Very easy recipe.

Use orange vodka - and the grand marnier is in place of the triple sec - no need to add both
