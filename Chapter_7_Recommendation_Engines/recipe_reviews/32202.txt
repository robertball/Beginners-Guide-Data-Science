This is awesome, fun, and healthy! The only change I made was that instead of making the meatballs, I simply browned and crumbled the meat in a frying pan, drained the fat, then added the soy, garlic and ginger and saut√©ed for another 2 minutes. We ran out of lettuce near the end, so we wrapped some of the rolls in rice paper wrappers, which was also delicious (and easier and less messy to eat). Next time I think that we will wrap them all in rice paper, and add shredded lettuce to the rolls. A must try!

Great recipe! Instead of making meatballs, I browned the ground beef, added 1 cup of the already cooked rice and poured the sauce  over the meat and rice.  I also added about a teaspoon of hot chili oil for a little kick.  I have eight children and they all loved it.  The hot meat mixture in the cool lettuce leaves is wonderful!

This was delicious! I added about a tablespoon of applesauce to the turkey to help keep it moist.  After rolling the turkey into ovals, I flatened a bit before skewering with 2 wooden skewers to help make it easier to flip on the grill.  We also added just a splash of rice vinegar to the dipping sauce (in addition to the lemon juice) and offered chopped cilantro and Walla Walla (sweet) onions in addition to the other add-ins.  Sweet chili sauce is a mildly spicy-sweet Asian condiment that went really well with this dish. (plum sauce would make a good substitute) For added eye appeal, we used a large round platter and lined with red leaf lettuce and placed the turkey skewers in a concentric circle on top.  Dipping sauce was served in individual bowls at each place setting.  It looked like a magazine spread!  Great company dish since much of the prep work can be done ahead of time leaving you to enjoy your guests.  I can't wait to make this again!

My husband and I have always loved eating the lettuce wraps at Pei Wei. We thought these were even beter than the ones there. I didn't think it was a lot of prep time considering it's a whole meal. I would have doen just as much if I needed to do sides as well. Low cost and low fat; with loads of good flavor. As far as other reviews saying messy; lettuce wraps are supposed to be. I suggest two heads of lettuce just to get enough of the big leaves.

Can you say "YUM"?  These were great, I just crumbled ground turkey and sauteed with soy, ginger & garlic.  Served with carrots/green onions/avacado pieces/freshly chopped cilantro and basil and basmati rice.  There were NO leftovers.

Ok give the laziest person a tough job and they will find the easiest way to do it. My grill was out of gas and everyone said the meatball part was time consuming. I pressed the turkey mixture into a casserole pan to a thickness of about 1" and then turned it over and flipped it out onto my broiler pan so the grease would drip through. Brushed the surface with a little liquid smoke diluted in water and baked in 350 degree oven for 20 min. Cut in half to make it easier to flip it over and baked another 5min and then a quick broil to brown it. Sliced it into 1" strips and served it that way. My family wasn't thrilled with the sauce so I made a quick peanut sate' sauce with a couple TBS Peanut butter, water and milk to thin it down and a little splenda to sweeten it up. served with jasmine rice, shredded carrots and zucchini as filling. They really liked it! I will make again, but may try to use tortillas or crepes for the kids next time since they are not wild about lettuce.

My boyfriend absolutely adores this recipe.  He likes the crunchy veggies and putting it all together. I think that the sauce is a little bland, and I have added ginger and garlic and hot sauce to make it a bit spicier.

The flavor was great.  I also crumbled the meat to save time and effort.  Used the food processor to slice and shred, and used butter lettuce leaves instead of iceburg. But the lettuce tore very easy and it was a lot of work wrestling with it just to get a bite.

These are great, but the raw garlic is a bit much.  I would suggest oven roasting the garlic, then adding it to the dipping sauce.  Other than that, two thumbs up!

Great flavors.  My husband and I both enjoyed these.  Grilling the meatballs was a bit difficult, but I'm sure that's our fault and had nothing to do with the recipe.  Still good as leftovers.

I love this recipe! Although I did make some changes, I use this recipe over and over. I even make the meat ahead and freeze it for busy nights. I used ground pork instead of turkey (same fat more flavor), I added chopped cilantro to the meat towards the end of cooking. Left out the radishes and red bell peppers and added cucumbers. I kept the sauce the way it is. It's a versatile recipe.

I modified it slightly.  I browned the meat in a skillet and drained it to save time.  I then let it set in the marinade, added water and simmered it on the stove.  It not only was quicker, but then I spooned the meat on just like the rice.  I am sure to get meat in every bite this way.

Great Recipe.  Followed exactly as written.  This is sooo light - perfect for a hot summer day.  The ginger is what really makes this dish.  Thank you for the great recipe.

We did not use the sauce recipe, (we purchased a peanut sauce which was quite good with the wraps) I also made a cucumber salad with white vinegar and sugar to put in the wraps with the other vegetables. Everyone enjoyed them

Great recipe, I've already made it a few times since I first discovered it. I really like it with some raw shredded coleslaw mix on it along with the red peppers. And also when I make the brown rice I include some soy sauce, ginger, and garlic in the water so make a nice Asian rice.

These were really hard to eat and an awful lot of preparation.  Wasn't crazy about the dressing.  We ended up eating them like salads.

The sauce is amazing.  Serve each filling (sliced radishes, turkey, rice, etc.) separately so that guests can assemble their own rolls.  This makes the dish friendly for the low-carb crowd who could eat this if the rice was excluded and the vegetarians who would pass on the meat.  My family loved it and we will definitely fix it again.

The flavors in this dish were just ok, and I found it incredibly hard to make.  I think the turkey meatballs were odd in the wraps, would have preferred shreded chicken or something else.

After reading other reviews mentioning the turkey was dry, I decided to use half ground turkey and half ground beef. Turned out flavorful and moist. This was a nice change for a meal.

I tried these for the first time at a really nice restraunt in Houston TX and fell in love with them.  I was really excited when I found this recipe.  I made them for a family get together and they were a hit!  The sauce was delicious.  I will definately make them again.

In taste, my husband and I would probably give this a four BUT we have a two year old and a four year old and finding something that we all like ALOT is tough.  No one is a picky eater but we all have different preferences.  My family gobbled this down like crazy and since it was so easy to prepare, cheap to make, healthy to eat, and super yummy I say five stars.

Very tasty. I like versatile recipes, and this one can easily be made for stuffed peppers, but just not forming the meat into balls. Don't be detered by the work involved in making these. They go quickly, and isn't a problem. Maybe for working moms or dads who are cooks, reserve them for the weekend. Delicious!

Lots of slice and dice but totally worth the effort.  FUN, fun, fun to eat!!!!  I read prior reviews about the turkey getting dry and didn't have any applesauce as previous cooks recommended so added 1/4 of a sweet onion diced extremely fine to meat.  Put on scewers in little torpedo shapes and grilled on high heat.  Highly recommend oil spray on grill just prior to placing meat, it keeps it from sticking and helps in making great grill sear marks for an appetizing presentation. Meat torpedoes were juicy!  In addition I made an asian peanut dipping sauce and the "Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce" from this website. Great medley of sauces!.  Definitely going to make this again and will consider grilled shrimp and chicken too for a great medley of meats!

My roommate and I enjoyed this recipe. We added a bit of crushed red pepper to the turkey meat.

I wasn't in a mood to be fussy and make meatballs, so I fried ground chicken mixture in peanut oil till done, added 2 c. leftover rice and heated.  Then added ground vegetables to heat just a bit.  I served this over shredded lettuce and made the dipping sauce into a salad dressing by adding peanut oil, a tad more sugar and substituted rice vinegar for the lemon juice.  Lemon juice just didn't sound right for Asian food!  It made a nice Asian salad.  Great recipe.

This is a great change for ground turkey! however, instead of little meatballs, I browned the meat in a pan with a little oil and garlic and lots of soy sauce. this was AWESOME!

This was excellent!  We forgot to buy Ginger, so we skipped it, and they still turned out wonderful!  We'll definitely make these again!  Perfect for a party, they looked so pretty!  Loved all the different dishes with all the different toppings

This recipe was pretty tasty. However I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and didn't make the meatballs. I should've made the meatballs, it was very messy! Also if your looking for portion control the recipe as is would be a better option.

Asian Roll Lettuce Wrap Haiku: "Bright and fun to eat. (Time consuming to prepare) But it's well worth it!" This meal made dinnertime so much fun, w/ all the colors, crunch, textures, and tastes - my daughter, well, not so thrilled about it, but she happily ate the meatballs, rice, and some of the carrots. On the other hand, I couldn't have been more delighted w/ this meal, although I feel like the suggested prep time's a bit off, as all the work that goes into this recipe, while totally worth the end result, would probably have made more sense for me to make for company, and not just a weekday w/ my small family. Loved it!

Easy, tasty, & healthy!  I didn't make the meat balls, just spooned the cooked meat mixture into the lettuce.  I also forgot the red bell pepper.  I was leery of the ground turkey, had never used it before.  I have to say I was impressed...I added a little red pepper to it and it was quite good.  Will make these again, and maybe even wrap them in egg rolls or wontons instead of lettuce for lunches.

This is hands down one of my favorite healthy recipes. I've made this many times and usually crumble the turkey and eat it in a rice bowl with the lettuce, rice and sirachi sauce. Since its just my husband and me, I always have leftover meat. I've used the leftovers for several things such as a turkey fried rice, as a stir fry with ramen noodles and I've even made asian omelets by mixing the raw turkey mixture with the veggies and sauce and mixing with the eggs and cellophane noodles.

Followed the recipe except for one thing:  I subbed jicama for the radishes for personal preference.  Like most ethnic recipes, this one requires a lot of prep work.  I found that the result was tasty, but not stellar.  It was very healthy and had a satisfying crunch, but I found the dipping sauce to be a little off.  If I do these again, I will try a sauce based on fish sauce and lime instead of soy and lemon.

I also browned the ground turkey in a pan with the soy, ginger and garlic as other reviewers.  I cut back on the fresh ginger, since it can be really overpowering.  This was very tasty and refreshing for such a filling meal!

These are SOOO amazing...I won't be frequenting my favorite Thai restaurant to order lettuce wraps when I can make these at home. I used ground turkey and browned in pain adding all sauce and rice. They were PERFECT! YUMMY!

SIMPLY AMAZING!! Definitely a FAVE to SAVE!!  Few changes though! I browned the gr turkey along with next 3 items but a little extra soy and double ginger and salt to taste;garlic the same. Used romaine and ate taco style. Veggies: chopped orange/yellow pepper,green onions,cukes,carrots & celery. Topped with a good helping of Mae Ploy sweet chilli sauce and few drops of Sriracha hot chile sauce.  YUM!! What an array of colors and a big hit at get togethers!!  Diced chicken is also great!!

This was a good recipe. But I will definitely take the advice of other reviewers next time and brown the meat instead of making meatballs.

Very GOOD!  I also just fried up the ground turkey rather than making meatballs. Next time I will tone the ginger down just a bit.  I also added a bit of chile sauce to the dipping sauce.  Delicious!!

I browned the meat (I only had beef) in a skillet, drained the grease out and then added the soy sauce, ginger, and garlic.  I also added some hot sauce.  I proceeded to finely chop the vegetables and add them into the meat.  To add a little kick to the sauce I added hot sauce, a little red wine vinegar, and a touch of honey.  Everything was delicious and I am very happy with this recipe :) -T

We loved it!  My husband was very skeptical when he saw the bits and pieces of things on the table but soon gave this a 5 star rating.  I added some chopped cilantro to mine and liked the added flavor.  I used a different dipping sauce because I wanted something a little thicker so I mixed soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and ginger with a little cornstarch and water and boiled that til it thickened. Perfect dinner for a summer evening!

Very tasty!  My family really enjoyed these.  The process was a little time consuming I may just crumble the turkey next time but the meatballs on the skewers offer a nice presentation.  I make a couple of adjustments based on other reviews.  Added chopped onion and mushroom to the meatballs along with eliminating the water from the dipping sauce and adding 1 tsp Sweet Chile Sauce.  The flavors really shine through on this recipe.

I thought these were great! As recommended, I didn't make the meatballs and instead cooked the garlic, ginger and turkey together in a small amount of olive oil. I also made the peanut sauce for family members who prefer it. Yum!

I would rate this a five, but my husband did not like the texture of the meat, so therefore it is a 4.  I used hamburger mean instead of turkey because my husband does not like turkey meat.  I garnished with everything except for the radishes because we don't like them, but kept everything else the same.  It was great.  Next time we are going to try this with sliced chicken instead!!

Came out delicious, but I made some major changes. I simply chopped up all of the ingredients and slowly sauted them together-starting with the turkey.  I also added some fresh squeezed lemon, tripled the amount of soy sauce and also added some hot sauce to it.  The original recipe is good, but very time consuming and a bit bland.  With the changes, it was fairly quick and had a slight kick to the taste.  I also skipped the sauce enterely, it didn't need to be dipped in anything. My family really enjoyed it.

These are delicious!!  Instead of making the turkey into meat balls, I browned it with green onions, red pepper, green pepper, an onion and the soy sauce and seasonings.  To serve, I tore a lettuce leaf into small pieces (it was much easier to eat this way), topped with rice, turkey mixture, shredded carrots and the sauce.  I can't get enough of this!  It's hard to believe something this easy to make and healthy can taste so wonderful!!

We loved this.  It is  little bit like taco night.  To accomodae my son, who doesn't like rice, I also made Ramen noodles.  I must admit that I liked the Ramen noodles better than the rice, though they are less healthy.  The dipping sauce was awsome.  Don't try his recipe substituting powdered garlic and powdered ginger - it won't have nearly the taste.

FABULOUS!  Didn't change a thing with the recipe.  I also had some chow mein noodles, crushed peanuts, and shredded/cooked carrots for topping.  I will definitely be making these again!

absolutely wonderful! try out all of veggies (even if you think you dont like them) they all go really well together. the sauce is perfect! only downfall... we picked the wrong kind of lettuce, so the wraps tore a bit. we didn't use the skewers, just broiled the turkey ovals.

Very tastey. I ended up using about 1 ts more of fresh minced ginger in the hamburg meat and another extra 1/2 ts of ginger in the sauce because I minced too much and decided to use it anyways.  Turned out great.  I did not use radishes just becaue I didn't have any one hand.  I used rice vinegar instead of the sugar in the sauce.  I also didn't make meatballs, I shaped the meat into rectangles.  Awesome! Thanks!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe.  We had a leftover roasted chicken from Costco with the thigh and leg meat left.  We shredded that into pieces and then added veggies and ginger sauce on top... yummy!

I took the suggestion of another rater and used rice paper to make rolls instead of using the lettuce wrap. I thought the turkey had a pretty good flavor but I didn't care for the sauce at all and that's what my rating is based on. The lemon juice didn't seem to work. I think rice vinegar mixed with the soy sauce tastes better than the water and lemon juice.

This was my first time at making lettuce wraps...but certainly won't be my last.  My husband went wild (which isn't like him) and told me to add this to his "approval" list.  I used ground pork and white rice, left out the radishes and red bell pepper and added bean sprouts and green onions.  I'll definitley add this to my make-again list.  Thanks Liz.

Loved this!  We browned the meat in a pan instead of making meatballs, and then added the vegetables to the meat mixture.  To serve, we spooned the meat and vegetable mixture over rice onto the lettuce, followed by the sauce.  Reminded me a little of the PF Changs appatizer.

Awesome!  We don't much like radishes & peppers raw, so I served it with brocoli slaw veggies & scallions.  It was so good!  To keep the meatballs from falling off the skewers I put 2 skewers through each ball so they would flip better & broiled them in the oven.

I have tried many other similar recipes like this one, but I have to say this is the best one yet. While I was baby sitting my younger brother, I made this, although he doesn't like lettuce at all, he loved it, he started asking for more.

I was really nervous about making this meal, but once the smell arose from the pan, I realized it was one of the easiest and most flavorful meals I have  made, it was a blast, and now I no longer fear making out of the ordinary meals with my meats and veggies!

This called for turkey but I used chicken, as most of your Asian restaurants have chicken wraps. The taste of the chicken ball wasn‚Äôt so bad but it was too dense and too large, even if you longated it to fit properly in a lettuce wrap. I would have liked it better if it were in pieces. The combination of spices were nice, just didn‚Äôt like the idea of the ball, made it difficult to manage as a wrap. The dip was tasty.

This recipe is so good!! I didn't have any minced ginger root so I used some powdered ginger I have for baking. It came out great. I browned my turkey, added the seasonings and then added the cooked rice to the mixture. After I added a little of the dipping sauce. This recipe would also be good as a vegetarian meal. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for posting. :)

These were good, but salty, I added hoisen sauce to the meat and rice wine vinegar to the sauce and it was still over powering salty. I also used rice papers which made it alot easier, stuff wasn't falling out everywhere (if you've never used rice paper I suggest finding out how to use them). I would suggest using shrimp to add a little sweetness.

very very tasty recipe!!! I have wanted to do make lettuce wraps at home for a little while now and originally made this for our family Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner. BIG HIT! I opted not to add the sugar to the sauce and used water chestnuts in place of the radishes as we forgot them when we went shopping :-) I made up a larger batch if the sauce - because I follow a gluten free diet I used Braggs Amino Acids instead of ‚ÄúSoy Sauce‚Äù ‚Äì same great taste but good for you  - and reserved most to add to the ground turkey meat that I browned instead of making the meatballs. After browning the meat, I added the shredded carrots, chestnuts, and sliced green onions, cooked brown rice, and some of the reserved sauce. I let it all cook together for a little longer on the stove top ‚Äì melding the flavors to one another. FANTASTIC!!! I have made this dish twice now and can see this one becoming a regular family favorite!!!

These are terrific.  I just brown the turkey with seasonings, add the rest of the sauce ingredients and combine with the rice.  My whole family loves them (even the wee ones).

Cheater Note: I have also made this using Peanut Sauce from the store on occasion.  Still super tasty and easy.  :D

Surprised how good this was! A little different than what I expected, but turned out well. Followed recipe almost exactly. Did not make meatballs, cooked veggies in with ground chicken on the skillet. Next time I might try adding some of the sauce into the meat to add more flavor and less mess. Good & will make again!

This was a good recipe.  It wasn't what I was expecting, but it was still good.  I used cilantro as part of the wrapping ingredients and that really made it closer to what I was looking for.  Good, but probably will not make it again.

Great meal and recipe - very malleable. I did follow the advice of another reviewer - browning the meat and then adding the sauce - to this I also added the green onions, minced water chestnuts and homemade chili paste. Also, I did not have the pepper or radishes so . . . I did not use them :-). A few words of caution . . . use light soy sauce or at least watch the amount of regular soy sauce you do end up using - I had a heavy hand with the regular soy sauce and ended up making it a bit saltier than necessary.

Awesome, and so pretty. I wanted to post a picture but my family was ready to eat so they wouldn't let me! I was surprised that my picky son liked the dipping sauce. I think the fun of this is getting messy! Great recipe, don't change anything.

Too many ingredients.  I used what we had in fridge, used 1 tbsp hoisin sauce mixed with 1/2 c water  and green leaf lettuce.  Plus chicken cut into thin strips.  Don't like texture of ground turkey.

This recipe was EXCELLENT but I had to modify a few things! TFirst, I made the sauce and cooked the turkey in the sauce. I used a smaller amount of powdered ginger instead of the tablespoon of fresh (personal preference). I also asdded a generous amount of Hoison sauce to the turkey/sauce mixture while it was cooking. I also served it with couscous instead of brown rice for sake of time...and served with crushed peanuts on the side (a MUST)! My husband and I had tons of fun eating this!

These were awesome.  Even my picky 7 year old daughter ate them.  I added chili garlic sauce to the meat mixture.  Only a bit though. Very good healthy and easy dinner meal.  I bet these would be great made on a smaller scale and used as appetizers.

YUM!  This was excellent! I did change a couple of things according to recommendations: I left out the radishes but added cilantro and chopped roasted cashews to the sides; added chili flakes and onion flakes to the meat and chili sauce to the sauce mixture. Will definitely be one of our favorites to make often!

I liked it..very good flavor...I didnt make the sauce as given but I did use mae ploy which is a sweet chili sauce used at alot of asian cuisine restaurants for dipping and we also used plum sauce...the stuff kept falling out of the leaves and getting all over me and the floor so I ended up just tossing it all in a bowl and tearing up the lettuce leaves and eating it with a spoon...hey whatever works right? I definitely will make this again!

These were fantastic, and beautiful on the plate with all the different colors.  I felt so healthy eating all the different veggies and the brown rice.  I think this is a great dish for casual company.  The kids ate just the meatballs with some rice and cheese.

I liked the combination of flavors. I liked how it is a complete meal.  I liked how quick it was.  I just thought that the turkey meat lacked a little flavor.  Something was definitely not right.  I am not sure what it was or how to fix it.

Simply Wonderful! I can't believe i haven't rated this recipe yet. I probably make this dish at least once a month. My family especially picky 4yr old twins and a 3 yr old will eat these in a flash. Just a great and very simple recipe. Thanks

Wonderfully simple and delicious. Only change that I made was substituting Chard in place of regular lettuce (more flavor and nutrition). Great recipe - thanks.

This was delicious! I made it exactly to the recipe and the only critique I have is that it was messy and hard to eat, but thats not the fault of the recipe. Next time I might try rolling it in rice paper like another person said they did. But it was superb!

This is so yummy. I have 4 kids under 7 and I sat there in amazement as they inhaled it. I did make chicken strips as well marinating them in the same mix that is added to the turkey, they were tasty. the kids loved the meatballs though. I did boston lettuce and used red peppers, carrots, and bean sprouts. I also did rice noodle instead of rice. Wasn't too crazy about the dipping sauce, luckily had some peanut sauce insead.

We liked these a lot they were very good and had lots of different flavors.  The only substation we made was we used a bag of broccoli slaw instead of the carrots.

This was AMAZING!!!  I can't believe how easy and healthy it is!  I did make a few changes...sauteed half an onion before adding the turkey and then crumbled it before adding the other ingredients (just gave it more flavor and consistency).  For the toppings I used, shredded carrots, green onions, water chestnuts and alfalfa sprouts.  To the sauce (which is unbelievable by the way) I did not add the water and I added a teaspoon of thai chili paste for some heat and it was perfect!  I think if I would have added the water it would not have been as good.  I will def be making this again and I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today!  Thank you for the recipe!!!

Really tasty! We loved the dipping sauce, and I followed advice to dilute with more water to taste (I added another 1/3 cup water as I had regular soy sauce not lite). Great meal.

I loved this! I used ground beef instead of turkey.  I can't believe how much it tasted like ones I'd had at restaurants.  My only complaint and it's tiny is that they are very salty.  Not sure what I'll do but next time see if I can cut that taste down a bit.

I was excited to try this recipe, as I love restaurant lettuce wraps.  It was okay, but not as good as I had hoped.  I have to admit that the radishes I had were complete duds, lacking any flavor at all, so that might have made a difference.  I had planned to follow some of the suggestions of the other reviewers, but cooking duties fell to DH for the evening, and he went by the recipe.  Definitely, fry the meat and crumble it without making meatballs.  We had the meat balls, and it made eating the wraps difficult.  Also, I'll probably mix some of the soy/ginger sauce in with the meat mixture next time.  Lastly, our market didn't have bib lettuce, so we used boston and it was too weak to accommodate the meal.  We'll try this again with some variation on the original recipe.

Wow!  This is tasty!  I like it better with rice vinegar instead of lemon juice, and I do not make meatball skewers. I like to cook the ground turkey in a skillet with extra ginger and garlic (I always use extra garlic and ginger whenever they are called for in a recipe-YUM).  The meat tastes delicious, the sauce is fantastic-the exact taste I was looking for in an Asian dipping sauce.  However, the lettuce wrap is tricky.  Maybe I should try a different lettuce, or perhaps shred the lettuce and use rice paper wraps?  Either way, this combo tastes gooooood!  I served it to my guy and his friend and they agreed.  Only complaint is it is messy to eat in lettuce wraps.

5 stars!! This is going into my favorite catagory. I made it with the turkey ground (not balled) and threw all the vegetables in with it because that is how my favorite Thai place serves it. It is messy and it should be that way! Thank you for a great recipe!

I like these a lot. I make them when my husband goes out of town because he doesn't! Instead of skewering the meat I just brown it and use the lettuce as a taco shell. It is a little more messy, but that is ok with me.

5 stars because I would definitely make again, with a few amendments. I did form the meat into balls, which I think I would prefer over crumbling (less messy). The balls needed more spice, though-- possibly double the amt. of garlic and ginger. I would look for a different sauce recipe, though this one came out okay by adding some peanut butter and using rice wine vinegar instead of lemon juice. Mostly, I appreciate this recipe as a method-- you can use whatever vegetables or wrap you want. Radishes were a good choice that I wouldn't have thought of. I used brown basmati rice, which complemented the dish well.

These wraps were quite tasty.  I browned the turkey in a skillet as others suggested, which was easier than the meatball method.  Cooking in the skillet may have affected the meat though b/c it came out dry.  Next time maybe I'll try the meatball method, but turkey is so difficult to keep moist and juicy.  Mixed some red chili garlic sauce in with the soy sauce mixture to add some heat.  We will make this again.

Great taste, but messy.  More like an Asian taco or Asian taco salad.  Doubt lettuce leaves would hold this together, and didn't have rice paper so used multi-grain tortilla.  Worked fine, but sweet taste of tortilla took a little away from the contents' flavor.  Great way to use ground turkey.

I love this recipe!  I skip the meatball making and just saute the ground turkey in a pan with the spices.  I also use rice paper wraps instead of lettuce for ease of eating.  It is a fun change to do an "assemble it yourself" dinner and this recipe is delicious.  Thanks!

This was a very good mean. It was so easy to prepare and put together. The only thing I did different was steamed up some cabbage leaves so it wouldnt be as messy to eat. I also added soy sauce to the rice while cooking for more flavor. DeliciouS

I loved this recipe!  My only complaint was that it is a bit messy to eat.  So we just tore up the lettuce leaves and ate it like a salad the next time I made it!  Thanks for the idea!

yummmy I thought it was good. Very healthy.  Not too much work...I bought pre-shredded carrots so that saved time.  

The only thing i'd like to try next time is eating it in a tortilla shell... some asian dishes actually use tortilla like shells for some meals. :)

These were really good.  I cut down on prep time by frying everything with the ground turkey, including the carrots, green onion, and bell pepper.  I left out the radishes.  Probably not worth the extended prep time, but was very quick and easy this way,  and deliciouse.

These were really very good (a lot like P.F. Chang's), but WAY too much work for a dish that costs $8 at the restaurant.

Yummy!  The favors were awesome!  The only negative was the dryness of the turney meatballs, but I guess this is to be expected with turkey.  I will definitely be making this again...

Saved this to my favorites! To make it a little faster on a weeknight, I crumbled and browned the turkey. Added the garlic, ginger and soy to the pan the last few minutes. I made up a quick Siracha mayo and spread a little on each lettuce leaf. Topped them with the ground meat, shredded carrot, green onions, lemon/soy mix sauce per the recipe and also added diced avocado. Delicious!

Very refreshing & light!  Due to being snowed in, I had to make use of what I had on hand.  I used some leftover roasted chicken and cut it up.  Sauteed the chicken with green onion and garlic, then added in the brown rice.  We used a broccoli slaw salad mix with carrots.  My 3 yo and 7 yo (who usually do not eat anything along this line) ate it up!

Fantastic!  Very similar to my favorite appetizer at a popular Chinese chain restaurant.  It's very kid-friendly to allow each person to make their wrap customized to their taste.  The sauce was amazing!!!

This was a huge hit with my picky eater husband.  I used ground chicken instead of turkey because I think it tastes better.

So healthy and easy! It was fun to purchase so many things from the veggie section.

Loved it!  I also just browned the meat to make it quicker.  I added a bit of cumin and my husband added curry to the leftovers and it was pretty good!  Would definitely make it again; may even try to do it with diced chicken.

I didn't do the meatballs but just cooked it in the pan. I also put a little bit of rice in the meat. I did not like the sauce at all. But I used someone else's review and made the peanut butter sauce. It was very tasty!

It was my first time making a lettuce wrap and I must say it turned out fabulously. The sauce really makes the dish! Like some of the others I just browned the meat instead of making balls. I also just used some frozen veggies (Asian mix) instead of fresh ones since that was all I had on hand. I then mixed the meat mixture and veggies together. Will make again!

Yummy--really hit the spot if you are going after Asian flavors (well, ginger garlic flavors). Messy as other reviewers said. I cooked it without the skewers; broiled on a pan lined with foil instead. Seemed healthy with all the veggies!

Not a huge fan of this one.  It was kinda bland and the dipping sauce was not sweet enough.  It was just salty and thats it.  I'll stick to the other lettuce wraps that we enjoy.

Not too bad.  I don't mind the meatball idea per se, but I wasn't confident about skewering them.  Nevertheless, I thought I'd try it.  Perhaps it's bc I didn't refrigerate them (made the recipe right before wanting to eat) but they slid off the skewers while grilling.  I had enough foresight to put tin foil under neath so they didn't slide into the bottom of the grill, but I think broiling or grilling on a pan or foil is good enough and they don't need skewered.  I'm not a huge fan of rice, so that part didn't do it for me, but bf seemed to really like them.  Don't know how it happened, but we seemed to have converted him to liking ground turkey.  :o)  Now for mustard . . .anyway, he really liked the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

I liked the concept of wrapping in lettuce, but these were a little messier than I anticipated - I preferred to eat more like a salad with a knife and fork. Chopping the vegetables was also a lot of work. Next time, I will definitely use a food processor/chopper (I didn't have one when I made these) or buy pre-chopped. I enjoyed the flexibility of this recipe - everyone can make theirs the way they want to. Next time I will leave out the radishes - they didn't do much for me!

Yum! I did not make the meatballs, just cooked and crumbled, it worked fine and saved time. Other than that I followed the recipe. The whole family loved it. Fun to assemble and a yummy way to get your veggies.

I did it the lazy skillet way.  My husband ate the leftovers for lunch with out the lettuce and said it was very good that way.  His boss liked the way it smelled.

Fantastic!  I was looking for something light, yet substantial, after a few days of family birthday parties (cake, fatty foods...) and this was perfect.    I'll definitely be making this again and again, and I'll also try different veggies with it as is seems very versatile.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I are in the carribbean and missing our favorite asian dishes and restaurants.  These were as good as PeiWei and we're thrilled!  I did cucumber pieces and cilantro with the veggies.

I followed the recipe to the "T" but should have done what others did and make in a pan.  The turkey meatballs fell off the skewers on the grill and were very dry.  The remaining ingredients were excellent but would be better without ground turkey cooked on the grill.

Yum! My whole family loved this recipe. I read some other reviews and made a few small changes. I browned and drained the turkey and added garlic, ginger, soy sauce, crushed red pepper and some chopped water chestnuts. I also matchstick cut some cucumbers to go with the other vegetables and added some crushed red pepper to the dipping sauce. I will definately be doing this again.

This is delicious! I am not big on any of the veggies the recipe calls for, but they are awesome together in this recipe. I used rice vinegar instead of lemon juice and added some cilantro, like other reviewers have mentioned. I also made ground turkey instead of balls.

WOW! This was delicious! Both meatballs and sauce had a wonderful, gingery zing! Don't go light on the garlic and ginger! I used ground beef instead of ground turkey. I may have over-broiled my meatballs, but with a little added sauce, they were moist again. I had a little trouble keeping the meatballs in the lettuce wrap while I was trying to eat it, but it hardly mattered! Terrific recipe, highly recommended!

I think this recipe taste okay to me. It is not something thatI would make it all the time. The turkey doesn't have too much taste to it. I don't think the PF Chang wrap is so great so maybe that is why I don't like this that much.

Read a lot of reviews and agreed that skipping the meatball step would save time. Had leftover brown rice from last nights meal so that cut out another step! They are messy but, they are lettuce wraps and very good ones at that!

This was a quick supper and although it tasted fairly decent, it was missing something. I added some heat to my bowl of dippng sauce in the form of red chili paste...it did the trick. If I make these again I may also add some bean sprouts to the wraps. Overall, a good recipe to build on.

Just tried this recipe yesterday and it came out great.  We had something similar at a Chilis once, but this came out even better, with the variety of ingredients.  A meal you can eat and get full without feeling too guilty!

Wow were these ever messy..........but GOOD!!! Next time I wouldn't bother with making meatballs, just brown it all after seasoning. Even hubby who lets nothing green but M&M's pass his lips ate them, WITH the lettuce. AND said they were good. Almost feel off the stool.............

This was ok.  I was expecting this to be excellent.  The meatball was a little bland for my liking.  We had a hard time keeping everything together in the lettuce. Very messy and prep time is consuming.  My 11 year old was impressed and she is not a picky eater.

Pretty darn good, but hard to eat. Shredding the lettuce and eating it as a salad might be a less-messy option.

This recipe was very good.  It did take a lot of prep time to chop all the vegies but the healthy meal that followed was well worth it.  I used bib lettuce and that worked well.  I also broiled the meatballs in the oven.  This recipe will probably not become a weekly staple but will make a good twice a year "something different" meal.

The meat mixture was really good and I'll use it in other things, such as dumplings.

We enjoyed this recipe but I made a few changes. I used crumbled ground pork with chopped water chestnuts instead of making the meatballs. I also added more water to the dipping sauce because I thought it was a little strong but I did not use Lite soy so that is probably the reason. Next time may just make into a salad because the lettuce kept falling apart on us.
