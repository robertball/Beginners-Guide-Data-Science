Four and a half stars!  Fills the house with appetizing scents.  Whipped cream cooked down to a tasty, albeit thin, sauce.  Will definitely make again.  Recommend adding garlic to the pan while sauteeing the mushrooms.

This needs something and I am not sure what? I had some leftover heavy cream, so I decided to give this a try. But, it is still an awful lot of butter and heavy cream for 4 pieces of chicken.  But, I did have thin sliced chicken breasts. I am not sure what the whipping of the cream did either versus just pouring it directly on the chicken. I would have to experiment with this to see what I could add. But, because of the high calories and fat added to a simple chicken breast I think I would have to think of way to modify that aspect also in order to make again.

I thought this needed a little more oomph but wanted to try it anyway.  It's ok, but I prefer my previous recipe that is similar but has a whole onion sliced and sauteed in butter with the mushrooms, then I add the cream, pour over breasts in a 9x13 dish.  Cover all with swiss cheese slices and bake.  Very rich and can be served with lighter side dishes.

This was eh and needs some more flavor. I added thyme, white pepper, garlic, onion, and green onions.  I think paprika would be a good spice to add next time. And, for a healthier option, I would probably use fat free milk and mashed cauliflower rather than using heavy cream. The cream wasn't thick and probably should have added flour.

Great, easy recipe.  I added minced garlic and sliced onions with the mushrooms.  My husband and I loved it.  I made rice with it but I think would also be good over pasta.

This recipe is a favorite. For those that want a little more oomp try adding Nutmeg and/or Allspice or throw some biscuits on top. Delicious!

I find that any time I saute mushroom, I always add a little thyme to them, it really brings out the flavor. It's just like always adding nutmeg to white sauces and saute greens. It gave this dish just what it needed.

I used drumsticks, and the mushrooms. The sauce is perfect on perogies.  Fast simple tasty. You can add what ever you want it will still be a great recipe.

I'm with everyone else, it's lacking something. I minced and sauteed a clove of garlic with the mushrooms but would recommend using two or even three. When I reheat this I'm going to serve it over rice and sprinkle some cheese and lots of salt over everything. If I make this again, I'm going to dredge the chicken in flour before I brown it.

Phenomenal! It's almost impossible to go wrong with so much milk fat in one dish. I didn't have mushrooms so I just served vegetables on the side, and the sauce was so delicious I poured it over the veggies while eating, as well as the chicken. I also didn't have seasoned salt, so I just used salt, and then rubbed Old Bay seasoning into the chicken. Worked really well, if anyone else wants to try it.
