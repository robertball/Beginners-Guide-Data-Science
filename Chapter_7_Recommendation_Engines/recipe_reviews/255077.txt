This was good and got better as it sat. It was light, had great texture, and was the perfect side for my Asian themed meal. I left a little of the peel on the cucumber for color but other than that  made it as written. I would more than likely leave out the sugar next time but that is the only change I would make. Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious and I wish I had doubled the recipe. I used regular cubes and sliced them thinly. I added fresh minced garlic to my sesame oil. Everyone loved it.

Good sesame flavor, not too strong of a vinegar taste.  I'll use this recipe a lot, it's wonderful!  Thank you!
