This was really good. I'm not a super health nut but am gradually trying to become one and so I pleasantly surprised that I liked this so well. It will be a regular at my house.

First of all I just got a massive bag of freekeh and was pretty dismayed to find out that out of the thousands of allrecipes there is just....one...containing the word freekeh!:/ So thank you to the creator of this recipe. Of course I tried this! It is cheap and easy to make. However I think "stirring occasionally" is a bit of an understatement. It might just be my poor-quality pot but the recipe began to stick to the bottom of it after about half an hour. I had to stir every couple/few minutes. Maybe it is because the recipe does not specify whether we simmer with lid on or off (I did off)? I topped with emmental!

Wonderful basic Freekeh recipe. I made it exactly as written and it turned out quite delicious! Some people add lamb or some other type of meat to this dish. But it's good with or without. Someone said it was sticking to her pan and wondered if it was because she simmered it with the lid off. YES that's the reason. Bring everything to a boil then give it a good stir reduce to simmer stick the lid on and give it a maybe only two or three more quick stirs over the next hour. The end texture of the Freekeh should be somewhat chewy like a soft rice.

This was ok. I never cooked freekeh before so I was unsure of what the consistency should have been. It was sort of like half cooked rice. The flavor wasn't bad. Not sure if I would make this again.

This recipe was great! It was my first time making freekeh. It smelled smoky and delicious and we enjoyed it with a dash of Chipotle Tabasco!
