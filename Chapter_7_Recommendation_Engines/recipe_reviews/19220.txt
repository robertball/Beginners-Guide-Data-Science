Delicious! So creamy and smooth. I left the milk out because it was already the consistency I wanted.

A great chocolate frosting recipe that's super easy and plenty rich. Just add a little more cocoa if you want more chocolate, or even an ounce of melted unsweetened chocolate. The egg and butter seemed to come together quicker once they warmed up a bit - I put my hot hands on the bottom of the stainless mixing bowl for a few minutes. This is a definite keeper!

My mom used to make these, too.  I just added some sprinkles around the edges to dress them up a bit.  This works well with vanilla wafers, cinnamon grahams, and even chocolate covered grahams.
