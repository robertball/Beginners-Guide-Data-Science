LOVED THESE!!!!! I was skeptical that there wasn't going to be enough flavor in the filling, but I was wrong...it was delicious! I baked mine at 400 degrees maybe 20-25 mins until the bacon was done. Great use of banana peppers from the garden. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
