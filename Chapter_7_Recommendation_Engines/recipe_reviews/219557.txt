I doubled this recipe for two sandwiches as two pieces of bread in my family only feed one. I used whole wheat sandwich bread (that was all I had on hand) and homemade cran-raspberry jam. The kids flipped for this sandwich--they each asked for a second.

Delicious! Peanut butter and jelly are a classic in my book, but add a little sliced banana and you have a nice treat for breakfast or just about any other time of day! It's perfect when you need something on the go or for a quick snack. I love when a few simple ingredients come together to form something so good! I'm a definite peanut butter addict so this was right up my alley.

Yes, I did just rate this 5-stars. :) A client requested this as one of her finger sandwiches for her reception; I assumed for the kids that may be in attendance, but can I just say I think it went over even better with the adults?! I used white sandwich bread, but same idea. Good stuff.
