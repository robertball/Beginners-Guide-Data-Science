Yummy.  I only used three onions but kept the sauce amount the same.  I also didn't have any fresh tarragon so I used a little dried thyme.  I had to cook it a little bit longer but I wasn't using a clay cooker.  Will definitely make these again.

Good recipe and original.  Great for those looking for inexpensive dishes.  I chose to bake all day thought and they carmelized well.  Used them on Matza as an appetizer and then on the baked potatoes for our meal.  Flavor was wonderful.

Very simple and tasty, this is a nice accompaniment to the main dish.   If you don’t have a clay cooker, which I don’t, I would increase the baking time.  Also, I didn’t have any fresh tarragon so I used some dried herbs de provence.  It worked out great.

This is an awesome recipe.  My family ate every bit of it and said I have to fix it again soon, only next time make more.  I did fix it again and put my steaks in it to marinate and they were fantastic.

This smelled fabulous while cooking.  But I did not find the taste of the finished product lived up to the smell.

Good with grilled steak.  I let them bake longer for more caramelization.

I always try to have these onions when He grills or smokes meat.  I don't keep tarragon but use a Complete Seasoning or Lawrys instead.  Wonderful, easy and good!

Absolute hit. Cut onions in half to bake so each person got a half on their plate. Scored inside rings, left outside to hold onion together.   Baked  it 1.5 hours and basted occasionally. The extra glaze was awesome on our sausage, and our watermelon!

Loved these onions!  The only change I made was added garlic salt and a little olive oil to the vinegar mixture as someone else had suggested.  Cooked in a cast iron pot, which I removed from the oven after 30 minutes, but left covered on top of the stove for @30 minutes.  They came out fantastic.  Thank you for sharing this recipe - it is a definite keeper!

This was just okay, tasty but not 'wow'. I didn't have the fresh tarragon so I put dry Italian spices instead...I don't know if that was what made it less great. Next time I think I will add some oil, garlic salt, and cook it  for 60 min instead, and see if that makes a difference.

This was okay, but nothing special. I probably won't make it again.
