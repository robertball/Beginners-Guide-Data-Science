Excellent! I made a batch earlier in the week for another recipe I was making. It turned out so well that I made 4 more batches yesterday to have on hand. I did use the nonfat dry milk the recipe submitter suggested since I would be storing it in the pantry. The one thing I did not have was the dehydrated lemon peel. What I did have was citrus acid powder (Ball brand makes it for use in canning tomatoes) and a pinch of that worked great.
