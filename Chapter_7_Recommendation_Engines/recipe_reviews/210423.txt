The first time I made this, I made it to the T. For being a dark chocolate cupcake, I didn't get it. It didn't have much of a chocolate taste. My friends loved it, but for me it wasn't all that. However, the second time I made it, I did add two more tablespoons of cocoa to make it chocolaty. A tip: if you use instant coffee such as nescafe, put in 2 tbsp of instant coffee to a little more than 1/3 cup of water and let it steam, not boil. Stir and measure out 1/3 cup and let cool. The coffee really brings out the richness and taste of the cocoa. I also recommend not to add the baking soda to the dry ingredients. I always add into the wet ingredients just before adding the dry ingredients to let the baking soda do its job properly. I hope that helps! :)

These were amazingly awesome. I wasn't sure what to expect based on the previous reviews. Some people said they were dense, but mine came out quite fluffy. After I baked them, they didn't look as nice as a cake mix cupcake would, but I piped my icing onto the tops and they were fantastic. I used special dark chocolate cocoa powder. I look forward to making these again soon.

Excellent cupcake recipe.  It is nice and dense and not too sweet so it is perfect for loading with lots of frosting.  Make sure you get the oven temperature right and measure accurately other wise they don't firm up as they should.

I didn't use coffee and I made a different frosting, but this cupcake recipe was okay at best.  The cupcakes were very crumbly and spread over the top of the cupcake pan (instead of rising).  Next time, I would go with a boxed cake mix over this recipe.

Excellent recipe! I didn't have whole milk - used 1%, and I just used my regular brewed coffee...which isn't terribly strong, and these still turned out fantastic! I didn't try the icing as I didn't have whipping cream, but topped them with cream cheese frosting. They were to die for! Almost everyone had seconds!

I was really hopeful about this recipe due to the great reviews. I'm not sure why my cupcakes turned out as a big FAIL when others didn't. The only thing I changed was to double the recipe.  The cupcakes were flat and spilled over. The worst part, however, was that you couldn't even pick them up without them losing their shape and squishing together. I ended up only making 12 and then trying to bake the rest as a small cake. I wouldn't have been so frustrated if they had at least been awesome in taste, but I thought they were a little bland...

Great recipe.  These turned out fantastic.  Followed the recipe exactly which was easy and quick.  I topped them with vanilla buttercream frosting but will try this frosting next time.

These were horrible!  I am a professional baker - followed the recipe to the tee.  First, these are NOT dark chocolate - they are barely chocolate.  The texture is crumby and not at all moist.  Like many said, they rise and fall flat.  They are more like a brownie than a cake.  Very disappointing.

I was a little skeptical at first because this recipe doesn't call for much flour. Even for regular cupcakes, I'd normally use at LEAST two cups. I read other suggestions though and because it had good reviews, I decided to try it.   The things I changed was that I didn't add any coffee and used regular 1% milk instead. However, like some of the reviews mentioned, the cupcakes did not whatsoever hold their shape, fluffed up, and went flat and spilled over. I'm still wondering why this happened especially since I followed the recipe closely besides the changes I mentioned.  However, they tasted great, but their structure was HORRIBLE. I'd definitely add more flour or something, but I don't think I'd do this recipe again. :\

I only tried the frosting, not the cake. I used with white cupcakes. Frosting too bitter for my family and ended up in trash. Other than that, it was easy to make and would have been easy to pipe had I not thrown away. Very good flavor other than the bitter part. Next time I will use milk choc.

Excellent! The coffee flavor is just perfect and the cakes were moist and fluffy.  I love that everything is from scratch including the frosting.  THIS is real baking!

These were a huge hit.  The icing is fantastic.  I chopped up the chocolate chips a bit to make them smaller and more flaky... looked pretty on top.

I have used this recipe before.  It is delicious and I added a few extra fun things this time.  Wonderful!  The cupcake is inside the Butter Cream Fondant cup with Mocha Ganache and Coffee Whipped Cream on top!

Today, I made this for my husband's birthday. It was AMAZING! I'm not an expert cook by any stretch of the imagination, but the recipe was really easy to follow and it turned out well. I made a cake instead of cupcakes and didn't wait for the icing to set...we were too anxious to eat it...and it has been tasty, moist, and held together well. I also made the cake last night and covered with a towel to cool...it didn't dry out.

If you are tempted to try this, go for it! When reading the negative reviews, you can see the people that had issues with their cakes didn't follow directions. If you use the ingredients they tell you to use (we used store brand), then you shouldn't have a problem. 

Very worth it and we will definitely be making it again!!!

I paired this cupcake with the Chocolate Cream Cheese frosting.  I added orange instead of coffee flavoring and it was a wonderful combination.  I filled the centers with orange cream butter cream with some fluff added.  All in all it was a hit!  If you mix the cocoa with a little hot water, it takes the grit out of the cocoa powder.

Much like the other reviews, I found that my cupcakes did not keep their shape what-so-ever. Also when I made them they stuck to the cupcake rapers so they did not come out clean. I also tired the frosting hoping that it would be like the frosting in the picture, it did not turn out at all, it was more of a glaze texture. I fallowed the recipe just as it said and I do not think I will make these again.

I would rate the cupcake part of these a 3.5, they were pretty tasty, but they didn't rise up very well and had a flat pancake look to the top (I followed the recipe to a T). The frosting however was 5+ stars. To make the ganache into more of a fluffy frosting than a glaze I let it cool to room temp. then put it in the fridge for 20 min. when I took it out I whisked it for what felt like forever but in reality was probably 4 minutes. The end result, the most delicious chocolate icing I have EVER made. It piped out beautifully on the the horrid looking cupcakes. The taste was rich and chocolaty and not too sweet:) I'm still searching for that perfect from scratch chocolate cupcake recipe, but this frosting is the best!

These were really good. It makes 16 cupcakes in paper liners for me. The frosting seemed like it wouldn't be enough since I wanted to pipe it, so I added confectioner's sugar. I kept adding more and more (1/2 a big bag) to get it to a decent consistency. Then I had too much of course. It would probably be good to either let the frosting sit as described or use a different frosting recipe.

These are delicious!  They came out really moist with a only a light nice coffee flavor, definitely not too strong as I had feared because I was using espresso. This is a godsend considering I was having a hard time finding a cupcake recipe without shortening that didn't just taste like butter.  I didn't use the frosting but a simple buttercream.

I had the same issue with these that other reviewers had. They turned out flat and literally fell apart in your hands. The only substitute I made was peppermint coffee creamer instead of the milk (which makes DELICIOUS chocolate-peppermint flavor by the way). There's no way I can send these with my husband to his work for their Christmas party so it looks like I'll be up late tonight making a different recipe.

These were yummy cupcakes for the kid in all of us! Made them for an early Father's Day Celebration (day before) where there were kids of all ages (from 3 to 92).  Used my own chocolate buttercream frosting and they were a hit!

this is a pretty good cupcake. :) it's light, fluffy, and moist (even without the coffee, which i don't like). the only thing i would say is that i would like more of a chocolate flavor. so i think next time i may add in something extra (to replace that coffee, too.). :)

These cupcakes are amazing! Moist and chocolaty, I followed the recipe to a T, using strong espresso and Valor chocolate powder. It's the Spanish equivalent to Ghirardelli. My frosting is perfect and I don't even like frosting! Fantastico! If you love dark chocolate then this is the cupcake for you. Thank you for this recipe, this is going to be my chocolate cup cake recipe for years to come! :D

These were very moist, but had a weird after taste. Definitely better the next day (like most cakes) but I've had better. This one does not make the recipe book.

I loved these cupcakes! They turned out great. I added some extra coco powder, flour and coffee which enhanced the flavor and made it thicker. I had no problems with the structure and everyone loved them!

Tried these for my son's wedding. The cakes are fluffy but I had the same problem with run over.  Am trying again and will put less batter in the cups.  Fingers crossed.

I've made this recipe four times following the directions exactly, each time to rave reviews and great success. I always use buttercream frosting instead of the frosting in the recipe, and the combination is excellent.

I used this recipe for a friend's birthday and they turned out wonderful! I read other reviews first and followed notes about adding in a bit more cocoa then the recipe says. I also added in the baking soda to the wet ingredients instead of the dry and because I am a Starbucks partner, I used Caffe Verona dark roast coffee as it is infused with cocoa during the bean roasting process so it really brought out the flavors of the Ghirardelli cocoa. Also, I didn't have whole milk, so i used heavy cream instead. I was worried that the cream might be too thick, but it made the cupcakes really fluffy and moist. Yumm!!

Made these Delicious cupcakes for my Dad over the weekend. Lets just say they"re all gone! So good. Recommend eating within 2 days after baking or freeze to maintain freshness.

Best cupcakes I have ever had. Whenever I get a chocolate cake craving I make these. I hate frosting so I love this frosting in this recipe because it's made from real ingredients and it's not too rich where it will make your tongue curl. Very balanced flavors and I think the coffee is very important in this recipe. Don't leave it out!

Followed recipe exactly, but doubled it..... Cupcakes were so soft that trying to remove the cupcake paper completely destroyed the cupcake.

A little crunchy.  A little of a bitterish taste.  Could have been because I didn't add mocha or salt and instead of mocha I used a little more milk.  Other than that, it tasted great and I will definitely recommend this to a friend and make it again sometime!

Thanks Ghirardelli,

First off, this review is only for cupcakes- I made my own icing because I needed to specifically decorate the cupcakes with a white icing

. Anyhow, after reading the postive&negative reviews I decided to take a go at this recipe. I made it exactly as stated. I must note that  the directions stating 'whisk' did seem somewhat open to interpretation.  The batter did seem thin using a hand whisk, so instead I used the whisk attachment on my Kitchen Aid mixer to incorporate more air & thicken the batter. That did the trick. Some reviewers mentioned that they were 'flat'. While they did not dome over like some cupcakes after filling the liners 3/4 full, the end result of a slightly curved top was fine by me. The cake is light, and a great dark chocolate flavor. These are not overly rich nor sweet; to the point where I wanted to eat a 2nd one.  They were a huge hit with my friends.. Definitely give them a try.   
 Note: For the 'strong ' coffee/espresso, I used an individual packet of Cafe Bustelo Instant Espresso. Dissolved it in 6 oz of almost boiling water, and let it sit a few minutes and then measured 1/3 cup as called for.

I thought the cupcake was very moist and was not sweet. But, it was too crumbly! I couldn't hold it without having it fall apart!

This is the best cupcake I have ever made, I made them for my 6th grade class for a holiday and added a marshmellow frosting and graham cracker bottom and garnish to make it seem like a smore and it turned out great. The cupcake itsself was really light and fluffy. I am definitely making them again. It didnt have too much of a chocolately flavor , so my suggeston would be to melt some chocolate and add it into the batter and i also added some vanilla extract

The cupcakes turned out excellent!! They were fluffy and flavorful. I used what I had at hand so there are a few changes: salted butter and not adding salt; and used 2% milk. Love the recipe. Will make it again!

I made a double batch, I used instant coffee with1/4 cup water and melted semisweet chocolate with the butter to make up the liquid volume,  and used cream instead of milk.  These came out dense and fudgy, with flat tops but tasted absolutely amazing.  They needed the better part of the day to set up so they kept shape but once icing was on no one knew and recieved rave reviews from everyone who had them.
