Delicious, and loved the pico de gallo!  They were a little mushy, so in order to cook them on an outdoor grill I had to lay down tinfoil and spray with some Pam... but it totally worked.  My boyfriend is a ketchup fan and was hesitant to eat a burger without it, but LOVED them and asked that I suggest others put Sour Cream on them as well as it makes it perfect!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I have to echo most of the other reviews.  The burgers themselves were a bit bland and could use something.. perhaps garlic salt or some spicy ketchup? The pico de gallo sauce was fantastic and really made this recipe stand out.  In fact next time I will make a little more of the pico de gallo because I couldn't stop eating it.  Served with mexican rice and chips makes for a nice mexican style meal.  Thanks!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I reduced the amount of cilantro to 1/4 cup (we are not big fans) and it was excellent. Very healthy, too. I don't think the fat content in the nutrition info box is correct. My calculations were much lower, but we ate these without the bun.

The foil on the grill is a must for these burgers, they are sticky.  They were great, I will be making these again and again.

The whole family loved this.  I didn't have coriander, but they still tasted great.  Next time, I'll buy some coriander to go with it.  We topped them with cheese, sour cream and salsa.

This should be wonderful.   I have made almost the exact same recipe for ten years and it turns out perfect, moist and juicy every time. I add a little olive oil to the meat mixture and nothing sticks.  The Pico de Gallo  is similar to the salsa I use and should be very tasty. I'll make this recipe for supper today. Thanks!

Made these burgers last weekend and froze them....defrosted today and grilled tonight on my nonstick grill. My only change in the burger itself was to omit the egg. Mixture was well moist enough to make 4 nice burgers. I loved the pico  de gallo! I used green onions in this and fresh lime juice and fresh cilantro really made it amazing. Served the grilled burger with the pico de gallo on top and served with sliced avacado. Nice texture and flavor constrast of the spicy citrus-y pico,  the hot flavorful turkey burger and the creamy avacado. Healthy and delicious!  Thanks!

Made this on my stove top grill (griddle on one side, grill on the other).  Five minutes on each side and let set for five minutes after.  Didn't have the ingredients for the pico so used salsa instead.  They were great!!

Excellent pico, not a huge fan of cilantro, so I will probably use a little less next time. Burgers definitely good for turkey burgers. Only used pico de gallo for condiment and everyone thought they were very tasty.

The Pico de Galla was fantastic.  Too much coriander though. I do like coriander and exotic spices, but this was too much for the turkey burgers.  It gets 4 stars because my husband LOVED it all.  Also, adding a some cheddar to the burgers is delicious.

This recipe is delicious! My family and I are trying to cut down on fat and the combination of fresh herbs and spices makes you forget it's low in fat. And I thought my beloved mexican flavors were gone forever! Thanks, Peach

I made it for my family and they loved it! The serrano peppers were a little much for the girls in the family, but I liked them. Other wise very good. I wish I would've made for than just one per person! Delish!

I made this recipe when my in-laws were in town and we all loved it.  The only addition made was to add a little guacamole to the burger.  Everyone loved it and we will definitely make it again.

Very tasty meal. I made smaller sized burgers using flour to form the burger so that it was not so sticky. I fried them in a little oil on both sides to seal them and then I let them cook in a moderate oven for approx. 15 mins. I placed them on a bed of fresh spinach leaves (with olive oil and balsamic oil). Then topped with the salsa. It was the best.

Left out the egg (diet) and used extra of all the seasoning.  Too much onion probably but thats no fault of the recipe- just a big onion I guess.  Pretty good flavor- not outstanding.  I did not make the pico b/c I wanted to eat these with gaucomole and salsa.  Might make again.  Quick and easy.

Tasty turkey burger, no lack of flavours which is great being it is a rather bland meat to start with. After a few crumbled burgers from other recipes, I learnt my lesson and froze the patties overnight. I put them in the fridge a few hours before cooking them to let them thaw out a bit. Works great! The patties stayed together while cooking! Instead of the pico de gallo recipe here, I used Don's salsa roja recipe - my favorite salsa. Works great together!! A dish worth a repeat!

Very good!  Bf loved the burgers, although he didn't want any of the pico de gallo.  I ate both together and thought they were both good.  I didn't use the egg in the burgers; in my opinion, you don't really need it unless you are using bread crumbs or saltines or something, which this recipe doesn't call for.  Ground turkey is moist enough I don't think you need the egg.  Bf didn't complain about them falling apart, so I think that's the key.  I also doubled the cumin--accidently, really, but it worked really well.  We both love cumin.  I subbed a small bit of jalapeno for the serrano pepper and eliminted the onions.  Very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was all right.  We grilled the burgers instead of frying and topped them with the pico de gallo and avocado slices.  The burgers themselves weren't too tasty though.  I think I will add many more spices next time.

YUM! I accidentally used cumin instead of coriander, and this recipe was still delish! Next time I will definately try the coriander though.
