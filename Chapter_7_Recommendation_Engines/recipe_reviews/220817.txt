This is a delicious recipe, and my rating reflects the taste!  I was toying with the idea of making it a 4-star review, but I just couldn't do it!  I will do things a little differently next time.  I didn't have an 8" springform but rather a 9", and I think that would make a difference because it came out quite thin.  In fact, I could almost see it in a smaller pan.  I love those cookies used in the crust part!  I rolled them in a baggie with my rolling pin, but I think I left the crumbs too big.  I also think that next time I will try baking the crust for about 10 minutes on a low temperature so it forms a sturdier crust.  I used Trader Joe's lemon curd.  I loved the use of the mascarpone, and the blueberries weren't too sweet.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a great combination!  EDIT:  This time I used a 4x8 dish and baked the crust for 7 minutes at 350.  For the filling I made Perfect Lemon Curd (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/perfect-lemon-curd/) but added 1/2 cup to the mascarpone.  I forgot to buy the frozen whipped topping, so I used someone else's suggestion of using whipping cream--1 cup with 2 tablespoons powdered sugar added.  It was perfect!  And it was a hit with everyone!  So thanks once again, dana!

This recipe is AMAZING! Oh, and it's very simple and quick to make too! Light and refreshing and very Blueberry-ee! I used Safeway Brand (Select) Meyer Lemon Cookie Thins in place of TJ's Tea Cookies. The bag was 5 ounces. The recipe calls for 4 1/2 ounces so I ate the other half ounce. Those little cookie thins are yummy! I didn't make my own Lemon Curd. I bought Safeway Select Lemon Curd in the jar. I picked the Blueberries the morning I made the Tart and they were just bursting with flavor. Made for my Book Club, the gals gobbled down every single bite and I had none left to bring home to hubby. I will be making this recipe many more times in the future. Thanks Dana for a real Blueberry keeper!

I cut the sugar a tad in the blueberry compote since cookies are sweet enough.  I heated the crust a bit.  It tastes good even if you don't let it set in the fridge since mascarpone is pretty firm.  I made my own whipped cream with 1 cups heavy cream, 1/4 pod vanilla bean, and 1 1/2 tsp powdered sugar.  Whisk, whisk, whisk.  Came out perfect.  Must try if you love creamy desserts or blueberries.

I made this and it was a rock star at our gathering. Minor change... I used way more than the recipe of the lemon curd, a whole jar. But it came out sooo good. I like tasting the lemon so it was just right for me. Everything else was the same. Enjoyed every bite. Thank you!

Everyone who tried this dish that I made absolutely LOVED it!  I used the Pepperidge Farm Lemon Cookies for the crust and it was so yummy!  I have made this 3 times in 2 weeks and I can't keep it from being eaten!

Oh, my goodness, this is "da bomb"!  So creamy and delicious,  with a bright, true blueberry flavor, accented by that hint of lemon--I was proud to take this to my dinner club, last night!  Thanks, Marianne, for your recommendations.  I did heat the crust in the oven for a bit, and I was happy with the result.  I garnished with a thin slice of lemon and a dollop of whipped cream.  Yum, yum!

This was yummy!! I used vanilla wafer and frozen blueberries and fresh whip cream as that is what I had on hand. I made it two nights in a row.

I know it's not good to rate a recipe when you made changes to it but I think even with the substitution of mascarpone cheese for cream cheese still worked in this recipe. I also added a bit more sugar to the blueberries since it was fresh-frozen and thawed and it lost some of it's sweetness. I made a rue from the blueberry juices and tripled the cornstarch since I had a lot of juice and didn't want lumps of cornstarch. I put the crust in the fridge till it was ready to use. I didn't freeze the whipped topping mixture (used whipping cream, vanilla, & powdered sugar) but again, put it in the fridge while the blueberries cooled. I let it chill overnight and had it for dessert the next day. Even by using a 9x9 glass dish, it came out beautifully and tasted amazing. My husband went for seconds even though he only ate 1/2 of what on his plate. My son said it was delicious and I agreed with him. It's a nice change by adding the lemon cookies and curd. Guaranteed to make it again! Thanks.

I loved this recipe and so did the rest of my family. I did add about 3 times the amount of lemon curd, because I love lemon!

Quick, easy and delicious. I also used heavy whipping cream, about 1 cup, but did not add anything to it. I did double the lemon curd to give it more flavor.

I made some changes, but they wouldn't affect the outcome of the recipe.  First, I couldn't find the cookies the recipe suggested.  I bought a 'lemony' cookie, but I think even a graham cracker crust would be fine.  Second, I just used a square 8 x 8 glass pan which has a lid.  Not as nice a presentation but this doesn't alter the taste.  I made my own lemon curd and added a dollop of this on top of each piece.

I had to substitute a ginger- lemon cookie for the base- it was very good.  

When I make it again I will omit the sugar from the blueberries and increase the amount of cookie crust.
