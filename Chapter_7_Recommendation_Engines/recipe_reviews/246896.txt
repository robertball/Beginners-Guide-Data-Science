So good!! I've been craving a mojito and was a little shy about trying a flavored one. I'm so glad that I did. My mom joined me out on the porch for cocktails (hers was sans alcohol... she really liked it and said it was very refreshing). I think we will be doing that again.

We thought this was yummy!  It is hard to muddle the mango small enough to keep it from clogging a straw, so sip with a thick, smoothie straw.
