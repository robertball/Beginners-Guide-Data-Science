UPDATED:  I made this again last night with the following additions & it was even better!  I added some chopped celery to the onion & garlic and sauteed in olive oil until tender.  Then added 1/4 c. sliced mushrooms & sauteed a little longer.  Set aside the sauteed vegetables and make a roux in a separate saucepan with the flour & olive oil, and then add sherry wine (1/4 cup) to the broth and then milk (cook about 5 mins, continually stirring).  Follow the rest of my review below & you'll love it!

When I reached the right consistency, I added frozen peas, chopped turkey, and freshly grated parmesan and asiago cheeses (or romano is good too).  I like linguine instead of spaghetti.  Add pepper and salt to taste.  Top with seasoned bread crumbs with melted butter on top and bake about 1/2 hour til bubbly.  Quite yummy!

I recently made this recipe with left-over turkey. I cut the recipe in half and added about 1 teaspoon of minced garlic to the butter and also some black pepper.  Another small change that I made was to put Italian seasoned bread crumbs on the top and to bake for only 40 minutes.
I was very pleased with this recipe and will serve it again!

This recipe is fabulous!  The only changes I made were halving the recipe for my husband & 2 toddlers, and it made enough for 2 meals.  I also added about 1/2 t. garlic powder, a dash of pepper, and about 4 T. of sour cream.  I also cut the cooking time down to 40 minutes, and probably will cut it down even to 30 minutes so it's a bit more soupy.  This is a really delicious recpe, thank you so much!!  I will definitely make this recipe again & again.  My 2 year old daughter had two HUGE helpings of this.

My family LOVED this one!  I did what others suggested and added a few things:  first I saute'd some onions in olive oil, then added some minced garlic, added the turkey to heat it through, added another tablespoon of olive oil with the flour and let it all cook until the flour smelled nutty, then I added some homemade turkey stock instead of the chicken broth, then the milk, and the rest of the recipe.  The only other thing I did different was that I added the butter in cubes all over the top of the dish, then added the cheese on top and baked it for only 20 minutes when the cheese was browned.  It was so rich and creamy!!  Even my girlfriend who hates turkey leftovers had seconds!  Highly recommended.

This is similar to my recipe so I thought I'd chime in with some help. I cut the butter to 4 T, add 1/3 cup flour mix. add 2 cups chicken broth, whisking constantly. add 1 1/2 cup lt cream or milk. whisk until thickened. add a dash of cooking sherry and then add 1 cup shredded white cheese (parm, mozz etc). Mix in 4 cups cooked turkey. toss with pasta, sauted mushrooms (or cooked peas) and also toss in a 1/2 small jar of pimentos and 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsely for color. put in 9x13 bake 25-35 at 400.

It came out perfect. I first read some of the reviews and followed some of the steps that the previous cooks took. I sauteed minced garlic and onions in olive oil, then added the butter, flour, broth and milk. I also opened a small bag of SWEET peas and used whole grain pasta. It was delicious!

This was very good. I only baked for 40 minutes and that was plenty. Also, I added a thin layer of bread crumbs on top. My family all rated this a 5 star!!

This is a good comfort food...super easy to put together.  Just what I needed to use up my turkey leftovers, but it made a LOT.  I'd advise baking it in a 9x13 baking dish or dividing it between two smaller dishes and freezing one for later.  Thanks, Ann!

Very good, but quite heavy on the Parmesan.  I didn't use the remaining 1/3 on the top, but substituted mozza instead. Next time, I'll cut the total amount of Parmesan back to about 1/2 cup. Like others have suggested, I added in about 3 tbsp cooked chopped onion, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, and sprinkled bread crumbs over the top before putting it in the oven at 375 for 50 mins. In the last two mins., I turned the oven up to broil, to brown the bread crumbs. Make sure the milk/stock/butter liquid is mixed in well with the spaghetti, otherwise some of the spaghetti will be crispy at the bottom. Same thing for any exposed spaghetti at the top of the casserole.

Liked it but didn't love it.  I was thrilled to have a new way to use my leftover Thanksgiving turkey other than soup or sandwiches.  I made some adjustments after reading some of the other reviews but I still found it a tad on the bland side.  I used large elbow macaroni because I think it holds cream sauce better.  Since I'm still traumatized from washing so many dishes on Tday I made the sauce in the same pot that I had used for the pasta which worked well because there's a lot of sauce and it made it easy to mix everything all together.  I used unsalted butter because I thought the chicken broth would have enough salt but now I'm thinking I should have used regular butter. I subsituted one cup of half and half for the milk (and used a cup of reg. milk). I sauteed 1 sm onion and 3 cloves of garlic in EVOO in a separate pan, then I found a small can of mushrooms so I threw that in too (sure wish I had more, they're a nice touch.  When I tasted the sauce it was bland so I added pepper and seasoning salt.  Kept testing it and kept adding more salt; then added all of my sauteed ingredients to the sauce with the turkey & pasta.   For topping I mixed parm cheese, seasoned bread crumbs and melted butter.  Cooked at 400 for 20 min like someone else suggested.  It's pretty good.  I'll have to experiment with it again.  I love the idea of using up the turkey  so I feel pretty satisfied.  I'm hoping tomorrow it will taste even better once the pasta absorbs more of the flavor.

This recipe is a definite keeper, with some modifications.  After reading some of the other reviews I incorporated their suggestions.  I sauteed onion, celery, mushrooms & garlic in a little olive oil.  Then I added the chopped leftover turkey and added some salt & pepper.  Meanwhile I boiled about 400gms linguine and drained.  In a separate saucepan I melted the butter and added half tsp of mustard powder and hot cayenne pepper along with 1/2 cup flour.  Cook this for a minute or two to get rid of the raw taste.  Add the chicken broth and milk, stirring constantly.  When thick add the parmesan cheese and stir until melted.  Now mix everything together and put into greased 8 X 11 baking dish.  
Mix panko breadcrumbs, garlic powder, paprika, basil, thyme together with melted butter.  Sprinkle on top.  Bake for 40 - 50 mins in 375F oven.

This was ok.  It wasn't bad, just blah.  I would recommend only using the white meat for this because if you use dark meat it gives it a strange flavor.  It's in need of some veggies or bacon or something.

As written, this recipe was a good base/starter.  I strarted with 1/2 cup of butter, and added 1 small chopped onion, 8 oz chopped fresh mushrooms, and 3/4 cup chopped celery. Saute until soft.  Then, I added salt, pepper and herbs to taste.  Then the flour, milk, and broth, and cheese...then turkey & spaghetti.  Just before baking, I added about 3/4 cup frozen peas.  I topped with a mixture of buttery crackers and the cheese, and baked just until bubbly, to avoid drying.  With these additions, the dish was a hit, and my 6 year old asked for seconds.

This was really tasty with the changes I made. I halved the recipe for 4 of us and there was plenty. I used 1/2 of a large onion,chopped, about 6 large baby Bella mushrooms, 2 large cloves of garlic and some leftover yellow pepper from Thanksgiving. I sautéed all of that with 1/4 cup of butter until the onion was almost caramelized, then added a little more butter and stirred in the flour. Followed the recipe from there. So good....

Very tasty served with hot crusty bread.  I cut down the flour/chix broth/milk in half and used shredded parmesean/reggiano cheese.  Also added a cup or so of peas.  My husband loved it and it will definately be made again!!

Great use of leftovers!  Easy to make and this recipe fills a 9x13 pan so be ready.  You control the creaminess of the sauce by cooking longer or less for thicker or thinner sauce.  Easy to tweak to your taste, second time around I added ground mustard, asiago cheese, white pepper and bread crumb topping.  Thanks for this great recipe!

We loved this. I added peas for color, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written. This was a great way to use up some of my leftover turkey without it seeming like "leftovers for dinner." I will definitely make this again!

I sauteed 1 onion, 4 cloves garlic, and 2 celery stalks in olive oil.  I added 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms.  I cooked elbows.  I topped with butter/breadcrumb combo.  This made a lot!  I had enough to divide it in three dishes.
**The 2nd time I made this, I used ground chicken.  It was also good, but not quite as tasty as the shredded turkey breast.

What a great recipe!  I used penne pasta and sauteed onion, six cloves of garlic, two chopped celery stalks, and red bell pepper in part butter and part EVOO. I also added marjoram, oregano, parsley, thyme, black and pepper to the roux.  Sliced mushrooms were added along with fresh steamed.  broccoli

I was looking for a way to use up some ground turkey and tried this.  I made 1/2 the recipe and it made 4 very generous servings. My husband is not very fond of ground turkey and he went back for seconds and is taking some to work with him in the morning so I'm very pleased with how this turned out! The only thing I did different other than using ground is I added some fresh basil, parsley and about 1 C. of frozen brocolli, and did not have enough parm. cheese so also added some shredded colby.  This is a good recipe to use up different veggies you have on hand.

This was very delicious!  Classic tetrazini!  I added a few seasonings like garlic salt, onion powder and black pepper.  Very yummy, comfort food!  Great way to use up leftover turkey.

Mheh.  Even after browning onions and garlic in the butter and adding spices to "bam it up a notch", it still tasted pretty bland.  The kids liked it, but the hubby wasn't impressed.

Love this recipe! Easy and came out awesome! And, no canned soup needed! I made a few modifications...I sauteed chopped celery, onion and sliced mushrooms. I also added a little tabasco to the sauce. I didn't think bread crumbs were necessary-the parm makes a delish crusty top. This is a keeper!

This is a tasty recipe.  I halved the recipe since there are only 2 of us and tweaked as follows:

1) sauteed 2 stalks of celery and 1 clove of garlic in butter for 5 minutes (wanted the celery to stay somewhat crisp).

2) added 1/2 package of frozen peas and carrots (cooked)

3) sauteed approx 1/2 cup of mushrooms in butter for 3 minutes

4) added all vegetables to spaghetti and tossed to mix before adding sauce then mixed again before putting in baking dish.   Covered with the shredded parmesan and also bread crumbs; baked for 40 minutes and then broiled for an additional 4 minutes to crisp the topping.

This recipe would also be good with chicken or tuna.   Will definitely make again.

I sauteed finely chopped celery and minced garlic into the butter and added a couple handfuls of frozen peas to the mixture.  This made a lot, so I put it in my extra deep 9x13 pan.

I'm not sure why this received so many stars--- its not a good recipe if you have to add a ton of extra things to make it taste good!!  It was a great "starter" recipe for turkey tetrazzini, but definitely needed some additions. As given here, the recipe is quite bland!!

You need to cut back on the quantity so it will fit in the dish. I modified as others did and added breadcrumb topping. I added mushroom soup and used ground turkey with garlic, onion and pepper. My husband loved the "crusty topping!" and gave it a "thumbs up." Will make again in smaller quantity.

Quick and filling weeknight dinner.  The recipe is very customizable; add veggies or don't, it's still good either way.  A great way to use up what you have on hand or leftover poultry and veggies before they go bad.  What a money/time saver!  This one is a keeper.

Really great.  I pulled it out of the oven at 35 minutes and it was completely warmed through.  I'll make this recipe a regular part of my holiday cooking.

I made this tonight with our fried turkey. It was really great. I have always hated turkey leftovers until tonight!!! I made mine almost the same as others but for only 4 people. I sautéed garlic, 1/4 minced onion with EVOO. I then threw in fresh mushrooms. I sautéed together while the spaghetti boiled for 6 minutes. After the veggies were done, I put them on warm while the spaghetti drained. I made a roux (1/4 tbls flour into melted buteter,1/4 tbls of butter. Stir until creamy. Mix in 3/4 milk, 1/4 cream slowly while stirring. Add 1/2 c. mozzarella Cheese and 1/4 Parm. stirring slowly. When it's creamy & melted, fold in onion, mushrooms into cheese. Next, add spaghetti. Put greased  9x9 pan. Add 1/2 sleeve of ritz crackers in melted butter on top mixture. Add French's fried onions to the top. Cook in a preheated oven at 360 for 30 minutes.

I would give 3.5 stars as written. Good basic recipe but rather bland without modifications.  Really does need the onion and garlic that others suggest.  Very nicely creamy and a good sauce to "solids" ratio. I made a few weeks ago as written and then broke out again for the rest of the frozen turkey.  Added one large onion (sauteed), a good spoonfull of smashed garlic from Trader Joes, a can of mushrooms (traditionally tetrazzini has mushrooms), also about 1.5 cups of diced celery (because I needed to use it up).  With these additions and a topping  of crushed round crackers mixed  with more  parm, it was absolutely delicious.  I know many folks have issues with celery...I dont think it really added alot to my bake, but we like celery and it was a tasty way to use up the rest of a head that was on the cusp of hitting the composter. The sauce is great...just needed to tweak the other ingredients for flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly and it had NO flavor.  It was bland and needed lots of spice, veggies, or something.  I noticed on the other reviews that some people add garlic or onions.   Maybe that would salvage this dish, but I doubt it.

This is a good basic recipe that can be tweaked to your preferences.  My family loved it as is.  I thought it needed a little color and a little flavor.  I added approx 1T dried parsley 1-2 tsp seasoned pepper blend to the sauce for color and flavor.  I would add peas and mushrooms next time, as suggested by other reviewers.  I might even throw in a handful of shredded carrots for color and just to sneak in some veggies.

Thank you for sharing this recipe! I've been looking for ways to use up leftovers after the holidays. 

Followed the recipe as written. Wanted to take a picture but it smelled so good couldn't wait. Served with some sautéed spinach and a poor mans garlic bun.

This is a great goto recipe for leftovers! I used turkey and the kids and hubby loved it ! Next time I will use mixed veggies instead of peas because the kids cleaned their plates, I can hide more veggies in this dish and they are none the wiser!!

Very good base recipe! I sauteed onion & garlic in the butter for a minute before adding the flour, broth, etc. I also used a can of cream of chix soup in place of 1 cup of the chicken broth. Also seasoned with seasoned salt. Next time I think I will add some celery & mushrooms. GREAT way to use leftover turkey, and it makes a TON!

Very nice, very tasty, and a different sauce for pasta than the usual red sauce.
Added garlic to onion and an extra T of olive oil when adding flour. Celery would be good here also. Read reviews -- I did take 2, 3 comments to action. Only did half the recipe, baked for 35 min.

We used Linguini instead of spaghetti. I added some parmesan cheese but also a little asiago, and added onion, garlic and 1/4 cup mushrooms. Used leftover turkey. This turned out wonderful! Will will definitely make this again next time we have leftover turkey!

Love it! The picture with the peas looked so good that I put some in mine as well. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly (cut in half)...my 8x8 pan took exactly an hour. I did make this the night before and refrigerated it till we got home tonight. None of us had ever had this particular dish before, but we all enjoyed it. UPDATE: Made this again, with fettuccine this time. Added peas again, also a dash of nutmeg, some black pepper and parsley. So creamy and delicious.

Excellent and easy recipe.  Having read some of the other reviews, I chose to add a bit of garlic, as well as salt, and small amounts of cracked black pepper, white pepper, and a pinch of red pepper. Not spicy, just delicious.

Sauteed 1 large chopped onion in 1/2 c olive oil (instead of butter) and added several cloves of chopped garlic when the onions were nearly done, then stirred the flour in.  Taste the sauce just before combining with the spaghetti, depending on how your chicken stock is flavored, you might want to add some salt (I added about 1/2 tsp) and pepper.  Also added leftover steamed broccoli florets to the mix, mounded everything into a 9x13" glass pan (it all fit, but just barely) and baked 40 minutes.  Let it sit for 5-10 minutes before serving, to absorb any excess liquid.  Husband, 5-year-old son, and I all loved it.

If you are making this, be sure to turn the butter and flour mixture into a roux before adding the broth and milk. Simply whisk them togther over low heat after the butter melts for 2 minutes until you can smell a nutty scent, then slowly whisk in the liquids a little at a time. This was great with whole wheat spaghetti. I added quartered mushrooms that were sauteed with onions and red bell peppers and also blanched some fresh green beans and added them for color. Then baked it all together. Make sure to press your noodles down under the sauce as any above the sauce will get a little crispy. Delicious!

Good base recipe.  I jazzed it up with sauteed mushrooms, garlic, and peas.  Turned out yummy, although still slightly plain.  Would probably add even more garlic plus some sauteed onion in the future.  Thanks for the recipe to get me started!

I tried the recipe with modifications.  First, I used half the butter specified, added another cup of grated parmesan, added one half onion largely diced, about 3 cups of broccoli florets and 4 cups of carrots.  I only used dark meat because it has a richer flavor.  Also, I topped it off with two slices of cheddar cheese broken into small pieces, and about a cup of parmesan (Kraft grated) and Italian bread crumbs.  That gives it a nice crunch.  I used a shallow baking dish to give more surface area to the crunchy top lovers.

This is good as a base recipe, but I wanted more healthful veggies added to my dish and followed others reviews and used chopped onion, garlic, carrots and celery sauteed in the pan first in a little evoo and butter.  Then to the sauce I added lots of herbs as I love the flavors coming out of rosemary, thyme and savory.  Pepper adds zip as well. Added a cup of peas just before going into the oven.  Topped with parmesan and mozzarella. With the modifications, its a keeper for our family.

A good base for Tetrazinni. However its really bland, but its super easy to jazz it up!

I added 1 medium diced onion and 2 cloves of garlic to the butter and than followed the recipe. 

I also added aprox 1 cup of frozen veggies (carrots, peas, beans) to the strainer and poured my cooked pasta on top - defrosting the veggies. 

I than mix my noodles with the veggies and put in a 13x9  dish. 

Added salt and pepper, Basil (1 tsp) and oregano (1/2 tsp) to the sauce. 


thanks for the share!
Than I poured over the noodles and baked at 475 for 40 minutes.

Very yummy and def a family favorite! I added vegetables to saute in the butter and also added some garlic/herb seasoning.  Topped the dish with melted butter and bread crumb topping before putting in the oven for about 25 minutes.  Easy and good!!

pretty good, only changes i made was i added a little garlic and asparagus in with it, halved the recipe because its just 2 of us. normally i like to follow recipes exactly the first time i make them that way my reviews can be true, but this would have just been incredibly bland without the garlic and veggie. still good though!

We loved this recipe!  I added sauteed onions and minced garlic before adding the other items.  I used mozzarella instead of parmesan (loved it!).  I sprinkled mozzarella cheese and panko all over the top and baked until it was brown.  I baked it for only 30 mins and it was perfect.  My daughter, her friend, and my boyfriend really loved it!  I would definitely make this again and try it with chicken too. Thanks for posting the recipe!

This was pretty good. I used Angel Hair pasta and added onion, garlic and m'rooms as per the other reviews. Glad I did too because it would have been pretty bland without. I never like cooking the pasta first as it clumps so I do it to finish at the same time as the sauce. Baked it for about 40 mins. - the parmesan crust was very good. A decent recipe.

We loved this! This recipe made good use of leftover turkey. I followed the basic recipe but made the following additions: small onion, two celery stalks, four - five fresh mushrooms and one clove garlic  (all leftover from making stuffing) chopped up and sauted in butter before adding flour. Delish!

Very delicious.  As others have said, onions and garlic in olive oil before beginning is a must.  I subbed whole wheat pasta for the reg pasta, and halved the butter (also applied on top of the dish - cubed - before the final dusting of cheese).  Still awesome.  Next time I will try to find a healthy yet comparable alternative to the butter.  Oh yeah - the protein is pretty interchangeable in this dish.

This was a very easy recipie to make, but I thought it was kind of bland, and far too much of a milky taste for me.  Not a bad recipie, definately something to build on at least. Maybe the next time I'll add some spice to it.  Thanks for sharing!

Adding a bag of mixed vegetables and topping with french's fried onions makes this even more amazing. This is also as good or better when made with left over ham.

When I saw that this used 4 CUPS of turkey, I saw my way out of the rest of my Christmas leftovers and rejoyced! :) This recipe is creamy and wonderful and makes A LOT OF FOOD!!! I goofed and didn't have enough parmesan cheese, so I used 1/3 c parm, 1/2 c low fat ricotta, and 1/2 c low fat sour cream instead. I also used reduced fat margerine instead of butter, whole wheat pasta, and added 1 tbsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp ground black pepper. I topped it with about 1c seasoned breadcrumbs and gave those a liberal spray with zero cal butter spray. It worked great, and I'll be making this again, but DEFINATELY halving the recipe unless I'm taking this to a potluck!

Perfect for using up Thanksgiving Turkey meat!! I followed the recipe as instructed only using 1 1/2 cups half & half vs the milk, and frying minced garlic in the butter before adding the turkey, flour etc. Top with Itallian bread crumbs and the remaining parmesan cheese. Baked for 35min. Delish!

Hubby & I loved it 2! Calculated for 4 servings, added chopped onion, dash of black pepper to the butter then went ahead adding flour/milk/broth. Used grated Locatelli & shredded Parm cheeses. Mixed in a bag of Bird's Eye Steamfresh Peas (cooked) and topped with FRENCH'S French Fried Onions. Baked 35 min. Yummy!

Great way to use up leftover turkey from Thanksgiving!  Very good.  I would like it better with vegetables like mushrooms or peas; my husband gives it 5 stars the way it is. :)  Only changes I made were halving the recipe, only baking for 30 mins, and topping with Italian bread crumbs in addition to the parm cheese.

Very easy and good. This is a good base recipe and can be altered to suit everyone's tastes.   I like the roux better than using canned cream of something soup; less sodium, more flavor.   Variation: add 1 can sliced mushrooms plus 1 cup chopped spinach to sneak in some veggies; substituted Swiss (Leerdammer) cheese for Parmesan. Kids and husband loved it.

OMG this was so good. I used up the turkey stock from t-day gravy and it gave more turkey flavor. Ran out of parm cheese but it was still fantastic!!! Put some Italian breadcrumbs, parm cheese and a sprinkle of EVOO. Thanks so much!!!

I halfed the recipe, and it still made enough to feed six adults with leftovers! Unless you're feeding a crowd, I suggest cutting the recipe in half. To jazz up the recipe, I sauteed half a large onion, garlic, and some celery in olive oil, then I added the butter, flour, chicken broth, and milk. I then added the turkey right to the pan and warmed everything through. I added to the casserole dish with spaghetti and mixed. I didn't have parmesan cheese so I topped with mozzarella (about 1/2 cup) and some seasoned bread crumbs, and baked at 375 degrees for 35 minutes (it was thick and hot and didn't need more time). It was quite good, not fabulous, but a nice way to use leftover turkey.

We made this like it said but we used angel hair pasta (that is what we already had-TOO MUCH!).  LIke I said we didn't 'tweek' it AT ALL-should have.  It had absolutely no flavor. Sorry to whomever thought this up.  I think it is missing some ingredients -  Don't cook much.

This was great - the whole family enjoyed it!  I used slightly less pasta, some Velveeta (just needed to use it up!)  and less parmesan (which I added to the pasta mix instead of directly into the sauce).  Next time will use some mushrooms and it will be heavenly!

Pretty good.  Used egg noodles instead of spaghetti.  Good flavor in the sauce.  Next time I would add a veggie to make it a meal by itself.

This recipe was amazing.  First of all, I stopped at my grocery store on my way home from work for a cooked turkey breast and they didn't have any so I had to settle for chicken.  So technically it was chicken tetrazzini.  Either way, it was awesome.  I followed the advice of others and sauteed an onion, a few cloves of garlic and a handful of sliced mushrooms with the butter.  I also added about a cup of frozen peas and carrots to the pasta right before it was done and drained it all together.  Absolutely fabulous.

This a winner in my home.  Never made turkey tetrazzini in 43 years of marriage.  Tried it last night but used half turkey and half honey baked ham.  My husband was the first person back for seconds.  Quite a compliment considering he's the pickiest person I know!  This recipe would be even better if sliced fresh mushrooms were added, but why mess with perfection?

Easy to make and very tasty!  UPDATE:  This is the 2nd time I've made it and for some reason it was very dry.  I'm wondering if I should reduce the amount of pasta and/or cover the casserole while cooking until I want the top to brown.

The sauce was good but I didn't like the way the spaghetti got hard and chewy on the top although I used a nice bread crumb topping.  I think I'll put extras sauce between the spaghetti and the topping next time to prevent that!  I had leftover "Amy's Delicious Turkey Bugers" and it worked out well.

I think this one is a keeper.  I cut everything in half and added some fresh mushrooms that I sauted in butter and garlic along with a dash of white pepper and garlic powder.  I only cooked my for 30 minutes and it was very thick however there is a possibility that I may have cooked the sauce too long on the stove top.  Thanks for a great recipe using all things that I had on hand.  I will definitely add this to the collection for things to make with leftover Thanksgiving turkey.

This was a great recipe. I changed it a little bit. I used ground turkey. I browned it with onions and 2 cloves garlic, added a spinkle of dried basil, plus salt and pepper. I only added a 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese because that's all I had, but added 2 cups shredded montgomery jack cheese. I mixed most of the cheeses in it .. leaving just a little for the top. Then I melted butter (maybe 4 tbs spoons) in the microwave and mixed garlic and herb breadcrubs in the butter and sprinkled it over top. Baked it for 40 minutes, cooled it for 30 minutes. It was awesome. My daughter is a picky eater, and she ate 2 servings!!

It was pretty good, with a lot of changes/additions, though. We didn't have vegetable broth so we just used mushroom broth, and it still turned out well. Added sauteed minced garlic and onions as others suggested, as well as lots of herbs (rosemary, parsley, thyme, oregano) and some pepper. Also added mushrooms and peas, and topped the whole thing off with Romano cheese and bread crumbs. Still tastes really good, but I wouldn't call it "the best". I'd definitely recommend the recipe though. It was still very tasty!

This was an awesome idea for leftover turkey! I sauted some onions and mushrooms and added them to the turkey mixture. Would be great for chicken too!

Awesome when modified to add more depth of flavor.  While cooking the spagetti, I melted butter in a large Dutch oven on the stove.  Added 2 stalks chopped celery, 1/4 cup diced onion, and 2 teaspoons minced garlic.  Sauteed until mostly softened.  Added flour little by little.  Added broth, milk, parmesan, and chopped turkey. Stirred in the spaghetti to mix well, then dumped into a greased 13x9 pan.  Sprinkled with Italian-style bread crumbs and baked 50 minutes.

Next time, I'll add peas and/or diced carrots.  Husband and picky teenager loved this and amazingly, they were the ones to suggest that adding veggies would be ok. Wow!

I've looked at a lot of the Turkey Tetrazzini recipes, and this is great. I had left over turkey, so I made my on stock for it.[ Next time will probably just used canned.] Used two cups stock and a pint of whipping cream. Also added the onions,garlic a little parsley and mushrooms. I will diffently be making this again. But maybe not with the whipping cream. It really dosen't need it.

This was fabulous - my husband raved about it for at least a week and fought for the leftovers.  I did modify a bit as others did.  Added garlic and mushrooms - would have added onions but we were out.  I only used parmasean as the recipe called for and really liked it!  It does make a lot but it was well worth the time and effort - a definate keeper from here on out when we have turkey or chicken leftovers!

Everyone said this was a bit bland so I did a post-Thanksgiving frig cleanout and added my leftover fontina and guyre cheeses for more flavor. I also added 3 cloves garlic, garlic pepper, and fresh ground pepper. I used 16 oz of pasta shells but while cooking the juices overflowed into the oven so if you use the shells, don't put the entire mix into your 9x13. I didn't do it but I think this would have been good with a little spinach added as well.

Great recipe!  I would definitely make this again but with a few changes.  I read the comments and use fewer noodles.  I also added frozen peas, sauted onions and mushrooms and garlic powder.  My 2 and 4 year old loved it!  This was very tasty and a great way to use up leftover turkey but I'm sure it would be great with chicken too.

Although this recipe sounded great, I did make a few changes. I added 1 teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder and salt, as well as pepper to taste, to the flour/butter mixture. I only added 1 cup of parmesan to the mixture and a (16 oz) package of frozen chopped broccoli,  cooked and drained. Instead of adding more parmesan on top, I made a wonderful topping of 2 tbs. melted butter and 1/3 cup of seasoned dry bread crumbs. It was absoutely delicious! I will definitely make this again.

I feel this recipe definitely needs more flavor.  I sauteed onion, celery, red bell pepper and garlic in butter and added to the cream sauce. I also added a simple crumb topping of Italian bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and butter before baking.  Turned out great!

The basic recipe is a good one, but it took the suggests in other people's reviews to perfect it.  For my small family, half of the recipe was plenty. I added sauteed mushrooms, onions, garlic, and red pepper flakes then only cooked it for 40 minutes.  It was *almost* too dry and I knew it would be more so the next day as leftovers, so when I heated them up the following night I added a few heaping tablespoons of sour cream and mixed well.  This was a perfect addition that I will do the first night next time, right before serving.  Thanks to the original cook for the recipe.

A great basic recipe -- I added peas and sauteed mushrooms and it turned out delicious! My Husband said it was the best turkey tetrazzini he'd ever had -- and that's a big compliment considering it's the dish his mommy used to make him for his birthday!

I too made this reciepe with leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  It makes A LOT of food.  I should have read more of the reviews as it was a little bland, I added some extra parmesean cheese and that helped some.  I think that next time it would be really good with some added garlic or onion and some pepper.

I had frozen cubed turkey in the freezer from Christmas and used it in this dish. Only thing I did differently was add some garlic, a lot of black pepper and a package of mushrooms.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It is easy, takes minimal ingredients, and uses my leftover turkey in a quick, practical way. Like others, I sauteed diced celery and onions in butter first, and then made the roux using homemade chicken stock. I did use 16 oz of gemelli pasta (I had no spaghetti), but that was way too much (by half). This recipe is adaptable, and next time I will use frozen peas in it. A winner as is!

I have made this 3 times now, it's so delicious love it! I follow Rebecca Joe's most helpful review you can find at the top of reviews.. I added sautéed shallots to the sauteed mushroom and celery this time and it was so yummy! I also cook the vegetable mixture in olive oil, and then only add half the butter when making the sauce. It's just as good! : )

This is bland.  If you add 1/4 to 1/3 cup sherry it improves the flavor.  I didn't mix the parmesan in the sauce, but put it on top before baking it. I also added sliced (canned) mushrooms.

This is tasty, but to me it has nothing to do with turkey!  By that I mean, yes, the sauce is fun, if you want something very rich, and my family loved it.  It's creamy and cheesey.  But I was the only one in the family who was thinking: What do these flavors have to do with turkey?  How does parmesan cheese compliment the flavor of this particular poultry?  I'd rather have this without the turkey, or maybe with leftover sliced beef or ham.  But the kids, as I say, thought it rocked, and I enjoyed it overall.  By the way, if the photo of the dish is going to include peas, peas should be listed in the ingredients.

Excellent recipe, tasty and very easy to make. Similiar to what some others have said, I sauteed garlic, onion and chopped celery in the butter before adding flour and milk. I substituted almond milk due to allergy and it came out great. Put bread crumbs on top and baked at 350 for 25 minutes, let it cool for 10 minutes before serving. Will definitely make this again. Note: this recipe should be halved unless you want a very big quantity. I used amounts as shown and four of us barely made a dent in it, will freeze the rest and enjoy another time. Thanks for the recipe!

My family gobbled this up!!  Used 4T butter and 1 onion and 1 T. chopped garlic.  1/3 cup flour, 2 Cups chicken broth, 1 1/2 c. half n half.  Used bread crumbs on top along with cheese.  Served with peas on the side to mix in for those who wanted it.

Made again this Thanksgiving and the new kids in our family LOVED it too!!  I've never had a meal that everyone loved this much!  I don't even care for it that much but since everyone else (especially the picky kids) love it...it's definitely a keeper!

Tasty dish that I will certainly be making again.  I sauteed onions, garlic and celery in a separate pan and added it to the milk/broth mixture and really enjoyed that the flavor they added.

I cooked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and then loosely covered with foil for an additional 10 minutes of baking in the oven.

Very good; easy to make.  I substituted soy milk for the milk, and just put parmesan on top so that I could have a non dairy section for one member of my family with an allergy.

Wow - this one's a keeper!  I was trying to find a way to use up an excessive amount of smoked turkey lunchmeat, and this recipe worked out great.  The whole family went back for seconds ... and thirds!

A little bland but good. Next time I'd spice it up with salt, pepper, more onion and garlic and load up on the veggies. Makes a lot!

I personally found it to be a bit of a one-note dish, a bit blah, but it seems worth 4 stars because it was a HUGE hit with the 9-year-old. I strongly recommend adding peas or other veggies to break up the monotony a bit.

This was really good! I used bow tie pasta instead of spaghetti. Just a couple of suggestions: make sure you season it with salt and pepper and bake until the cheese is melted, not for an hour! Thanks!

Really appreciate the recipe.  Never had a tetrazinni. Tasted good and really easy to make.  Probably would not make again with spaghetti but instead use a penne or rigatoni.

This was OK.    Sort of one-note flavor though.  I added herbs - thyme, parsley, a little bit of sage - and cut down on the stock and flour and milk and butter.    Far far better.

This came out REALLY creamy, even after sitting in the fridge for close to two weeks and having to reheat it every time I had a meal! Never have I made a casserole which didn't dry out after a couple of days and begin to take on the "this is definitely leftover food" taste. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and tossed in some garlic with the butter and used some pepper then as well. Sprinkled lightly with Italian-seasoned bread crumbs on top and baked for only 40 minutes in a giant 10" springform pan (it was the only pan big enough to hold everything).

My whole family loved this, even my husband who is picky about eating leftovers. He loved this use of extra turkey and even suggested we have it again soon. I didn't add anything to the base recipe, however I was out of chicken broth and used a mushroom stock intead and it was very nice. The 20 minute preeration was quick and not too messy or labor intensive, which I liked.

This is a great basic recipe. Very flexible. It's a base or core recipe that can be switched up many ways, as is evident from what other reviewers have done with it.  I love recipes like that! Thank you for posting it ANNOFBEV.  I wavered between giving it 4 or 5 stars (I rarely give 5 stars). It's yummy as is, but I prefer it with garlic, celery salt, onion powder, salt and pepper added (to the butter, flour, milk mixture). Topping it off with crushed corn flakes, bread crumbs or potato chips and butter is nice.  I've also used French's Fried Onions on top (do not mix with butter, they're fatty enough & brown up well on their own), which is very good. This has become a regular meal in our household - everyone loves it. Thanks again ANNOFBEV!

I haven't had Turkey Tetrazzini in ages & came upon this recipe.  I did everything as suggested but added some frozen carrots/peas & a small can of chopped mushrooms.  For the topping: I used Panko Italian Crispy bread crumbs mixed with melted butter.  Turned out really delicious!  I gave the original recipe four stars because it was really good to start with but felt it needed a little bit more!

Great as written!  I used mozerella cheese instead of parmesan, because that's all I had on hand.  I also added sauteed mushrooms and peas and sprinkled the top with cheese and seasoned bread crumbs.  Next time I will use the parmasan, leave out the mushrooms (they overpowered the flavor of the dish) and substitute the peas for spinach.  I'll also reduce the baking time to keep it a bit more moist.

I am giving this 4 stars as written -- it seems without the changes I made it would be rather bland.  I made a few changes that made it 5 stars.  I sauteed mushroom and onions and used half milk and half heavy cream.  I also doubled the amount of parm cheese. I felt the sauce was a little bland still and added a little extra salt and pepper.  My husband and 4yr old loved it!

So easy! Cut the recipe in half and there was enough for my family of three and lots of leftovers. Followed the advice of reviewers and sauteed garlic and onion in the butter before adding the flour and added a can of mushrooms. So yummy!

Was using over some leftover turkey breast and discovered I didn't have enough so I used up some leftover ham as well.  Also used whole wheat pasta and added some garlic, pepper, and onions to the sauce.  Baked for 45 minutes.  This fit just right in a 9x13 pan, although I didn't think it would.  Very good, will make again sometime.

Very good basic recipe.  As others suggested, I added some garlic and bread crumbs, plus a little Italian seasoning.  My picky husband had two large helpings.  I'll add even more seasoning next time.  It's a fun recipe to play around with.

Kind of bland unless you add a little something to spice it up (like peas with seasoning or peppers, depending on what you want to go for).  A great base recipe, though!

Wonderful!!   Added the garlic and mushrooms.  Substituted left over gravy for broth; cut flour accordingly. One-dish meal--boiling the pasta in largest s/s skillet and re-using while pasta drained for everything else including baking!   1st time tetrazzini maker; forever fan!

Simple and delicious, though I find it fairly plain as written. This is an easy recipe to experiment with as you cook it. I highly recommend adding a little cayenne pepper - not enough to make it spicy, but just to give it some zing. If you'd like a richer sauce, you might add cream cheese or sour cream. Mushrooms are a welcome addition. I appreciated the suggestion of topping the dish with italian bread crumbs before baking.

I've made this twice now. The only changes i made was to add 5 cloves of garlic to the butter, and used egg noodles. It was awesome! The second time i made it i went a tad heavier on the noodles and it ended up to dry and bland. Trust me, don't add extra. I also found it had better flavour with a name brand broth (Campbell) rather then with the no name. ...........Nites:  Atkins low carb version . 3tbsp butter, 3 tbsp flour, 1 1/2 cup broth. A small onion,  2 cups turkey. I mixed in half bag fresh spinach and 1/2 cup of parm. Delicious!!

High rating for the simple, easy, great tasting comfort food.  Some said this was kind of plain, but I think that is what makes it a comfort food.  I make it often for the Rescue Mission and those men probably don't want a bunch of different stuff in their food anyway.  I usually use home made chicken stock, so I have to add quite a bit of salt for all that pasta (even with the Parmesan).  I used smoked turkey (and smoked turkey stock) and it is awesome that way.  I've sometimes added liquid smoke flavoring which is good too.  Sure, it would be good with a can of baby peas, some mushrooms, garlic, shallots (would be great!), who knows, maybe even some cooked, sliced bacon.  But, the simplicity of this recipe is one of the things that makes it so attractive.  Next time I might try cooking for a shorter time as others have suggested, so that it is more soupy.

I liked it, but didn't love it.  It was bland, needed something to punch up the flavour.  I followed the recipe and the only addition to it was some garlic and onion powder.  It made a LOT !!!

We loved this recipe. We were looking for something to do with all of the leftover turkey and this one is a keeper. Followed the advice of some others and added some sauteed onions & garlic and sprinkled with breadcrumbs. It is a bit on the bland side but like Macaroni & Cheese, that is a part of the charm of this recipe. Very satisfying!

Very good recipe. Gave 4 stars because I believe it would be bland without adding additional spices. I sauteed onion, bell pepper, garlic, and fresh parsley. Also I added Italian bread crumbs and a bit of red pepper on top as another reviewer did. It turned out great. Everyone loved it.

I followed the directions and it was pretty good.  I will make it again.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to add some salt and pepper and maybe mix some more parm or some other kind of cheese in.  It was kind of bland but good. I'm sure kids would like this recipe.  We had dinner rolls and asparagus with it but would be good with a salad too.  I would recommend cooking for less than an hour as it was kind of dry.  At 40 minutes it looked pretty good so that might be a better cooking time.  Thanks for the recipe!  VERY EASY!

Not to bad for quick, I added some canned mushrooms to try and give it a little more texture and some black pepper. Ended up adding some Chipotle tabasco sauce on while I was eating it  for a little more flavor. Just kept thinking it needed something...

I wanted veggies in this dish, so after I removed the cooked spaghetti from the pot of hot water, I flash-steamed 2 cups of frozen broccoli and 1 cup of frozen peas before adding them to the broth mixture. I made a half recipe to start, with only a third of the spaghetti noodles. I added about a third of a cup more of the broth. I also added seasoned bread crumbs to the Parmesan cheese before sprinkling on top. Baked for 40 minutes.

This was very good. I did saute onion and garlic in the butter before adding the flour. I also added black pepper as well. As someone else suggested I added more cheese and topped it with Italian seasoned bread crumbs which added a nice crunchy crust on top. A good way to use up left over turkey.

Like others, I added some a clove of garlic, half of a sweet onion, both diced.  I sprinkled about 1/2 cup of Cheddar on before the breadcrumbs which I seasoned.

This was very good and very filling. Great new recipe for leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I took some other's suggestions and sauteed minced garlic and onions in olive oil, then added the butter, flour, broth and milk. I also added a small bag of SWEET peas and used whole grain pasta to incorporate some veggies & more fiber in this yummy casserole!

I used this for the base of what I made.  I wanted to use up items I had. Plus I only needed to make half the recipe. 

1/2 package spaghetti cooked to pkg directions.

1/4 c butter, 2 cloves garlic, 1/4 c flour, 1 can (approx 2 c) vegetable broth, 3/4 milk, 1 c parmesan cheese, 1/2 lb ground turkey cooked and drained (you could easily use 1 lb with good results), 1 16 oz package frozen mixed veggies steamed and drained.  

I did step three adding garlic before flour.  I also mixed flour with some broth to disolve before adding to melted butter.  I added all of the cheese in this step.  

In the same skillet I added the ground turkey to the broth mixture, then the noodles, then the cooked veggies.  

Since everything was just cooked it was relatively hot when mixed into broth mixture.  I heated through on the stove.  I didn't top with additional cheese nor did I bake in the oven.  My family doesn't care for "crusty" tops on casseroles :(.  

In the end I used only 1 pot, 1 pan & 1 strainer.  The family liked it alot.  

Just a variation

Best tettrazini ever!  was what my family said!  I changed up a couple of things.  I put a wee bit of garlic in the butter with the flour.  I used whole wheat spiral noodles since I was out of spaghetti noodles.  I substituted one of the cups of milk for another cup of broth.  I put some buttered Italian bread crumbs on top for some crunch.  I served peas alongside.  There was just three of us and we had leftovers.  The leftovers didn't last long!  We loved this recipe!

Gave it 4, because I added ingredients to make it better, as many of the other reviewers mentioned.  I halved this recipe, b/c I only had 2 cups of turkey.  I also added some onion and garlic to the butter, and added Italian bread crumbs on top.  This was the best T-Tetrazzini I have had.  I have tried others on this website, but this was the best one.  Very basic, but very easy to add to it to make it "your own".  I think I would also like sauteed mushrooms with the onion and garlic for next time....(and there will be a next time!)  It would have been a 5 star with the minor changes, without them, I think it would have been too bland for me.

We loved this recipe!! I love that it makes such a creamy sauce without the use of canned soup! I reduced it to four servings and added minced garlic, sauteed onions & mushrooms and a can of mixed vegetables although I really wanted to add frozen peas instead but didn't have any in the freezer :o( Next time I will try adding the peas for sure! We ate this for dinner and then polished off the leftovers for lunch the next day! Yummy

I made the mistake of stirring the mixture with some of the spaghetti on top.  It cooked too much and was crunchy. Next time I will leave it alone and it will be excellent.  Can't wait to make it again.

Very good base recipe.  I took the advice of many and sauted some onion, garlic, and mushrooms with the butter. I cut the recipe in half and cooked it for 40 minutes, and it came out a little to dry.  Perhaps that is because I used tapioca flour since I have to cook gluten free.  Next time, I will increase the milk and broth by 50%.  I think doubling the sauce would be too much.

Great recipe! I used a few of the modifications that I read from other reviews and tried a few adaptions of my own. I used half of the butter that the recipe called for and sauteed a half of onion & a small can of mushrooms before adding the flour. Once I added in the broth and milk, I also added in a splash or two of Marsala wine. This really added a nice flavor to the finished product. I also topped the dish with Italian breadcrumbs before putting into the oven. My oven always runs a bit low, so I cooked this at 360 degrees for 40 minutes, but it was ready around 35 minutes. My husband loved this so much, he went back for seconds!

WoW... Yum.. This was very good. I made some changes. I added mushrooms. (I sauteed them in Lite butter first then added them just before the turkey)I also used the homemade turkey broth from my leftover turkey soup. I used skim milk and added some spices (garlic, salt, pepper, poultry seasoning)I loved it!!!! I will make it every year after Thanks Giving. Thanks so much for sharing!!

This recipe is simply delicious exactly how it is written.  Don't make any modifications, trust me, it just wouldn't be as good no matter what you did.  I tried this last year with the thanksgiving leftovers and it was a huge hit that has been requested many times since. This recipe is one that will handed down for generations in my family. Seriously, it is that good.

I used mozzarella instead of parmesan, but would have preferred parmesan in this as recipe suggests.  It was a little bland.  I added pimento and mushroom as another recipe suggests.  Will definetly make again.

This is a good base recipe.  If I hadn't added peas, garlic, Kosher salt, and bread crumbs to the top though, I think this would have been somewhat bland.  With these additions it was great.  Thanks!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  My husband prefers bowtie noodles and I like the spaghetti noodles, either way it's a delicious sauce!

This was really good! My family enjoyed it.. For the chicken broth I had made homemade chicken soup the day before and used that broth that was seasoned with carrots, celery, parsley and pepper. I also added xtra parmesan to the sauce. When I tasted it... I thought it to be bland, so I added mushrooms, a small jar of pimento's, Tones Italian seasoning a little sage(I love herbs)and more black pepper. I broke my spaghetti into 3 sections and cooked up about 3/4 lb. As I gradually mixed them together it was too much pasta, so I ended up using maybe half of that, so 1lb is too much unless you like it dry. Try only half a pound, the spaghetti really absorbs the sauce. I topped it off with seasoned bread crumbs with parmesan cheese and dotted the top with a little butter. After doing these few adjustments it was a 5 * recipe! Best thing to do is follow the recipe and taste the sauce as is to see if you like it, then start adding things to your liking. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  Reminds me of Chicken Tetrazzini my mom used to make.  I usually make it with a roast chicken from the grocery store.  I always sautee some muchrooms and onions to add to the mix.

I made this for my somewhat picky significant other and it was a HIT! 

I did make a few changes: cooked several slices bacon then used the drippings to saute garlic, onions, mushrooms and chopped red bell peppers. Used about 3/4 package of thin spaghetti, a 3 to 1 ratio of fresh ground parm to preground parm, a can of low sodium cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of condensed 2% milk and then the same amount of skim milk added to the butter and flour mixture. A good amount of Mrs Dash Garlic and Herb added to that and then mixed it all up with the crumbled bacon and turkey. Sprinkled a nice layer of Parm and Bread crumbs on top and YUM...I can't wait for the leftovers!

Superb. I added some red pepper flakes and garlic to the mix to make it more flavorful. I also added peas for color and because I love peas. This was so simple and tasty.

As written, I find this recipe to be very bland. So, here are my suggestions. Fry bacon and crumble. Reserve some bacon grease and use this to saute sliced (fresh) mushrooms and onions (as much as you'd like - I use one whole, medium onion). Stir the mushrooms, onions and crumbled bacon into the dish and then season with additional spices if needed for your taste. With the changes, this can be a very good recipe. I do LOVE how easy it is to whip up, especially after cooking Thanksgiving dinner yesterday! I like to double the sauce and use plenty of bacon, mushrooms and onion. I also do not add the tomato to this dish.

The first time I made this as written.  The second time, I tried adding  sauteed onions, peppers, garlic and mushrooms.  Still wasn't pleased with the taste.  Maybe it's the turkey.  Chicken may be better.  By the way, if you try this, you will need a large casserole dish.

I added about 1 cup of mixed veggies (I scaled the recipe down to 2 people) and some minced onion and garlic powder.  I also used whole wheat penne pasta.  My 2 1/2 year old yummed it up like I have never seen him eat.  Thanks.

Very easy recipe.  I didn't have spaghetti so I used penne.  If you do that, make extra sauce.  I also added a lot of cracked pepper.  I took another reviewers suggestion of putting breadcrumbs on top.  It was good.  I'll make again.

I thought this was a very good recipe.  I didn't have any spaghetti on hand so I subsitited shells and had good results.  I also added a half bag of frozen veggies and mixed in.  I had a block of provolone cheese handy so I used some of that and got big flavor for little cheese and cut back the parmesan a bit.  It was creamy and delicious - the kids ate it all up. I also added some bread crumbs on top to make it look like a tetrazzini!  Yum!

Pretty bland. And I sauteed garlic and mushrooms in the butter before adding the flour. I would recommend more salt, garlic powder and perhaps a little cayenne or cajun seasoning.

Very yummy! I halved the recipe, and did similar to another reviewer-sauteed onions, garlic, and poblano pepper in EVOO (out of butter), added the flour and let it cook, added the broth and milk, brought to boil, then added some peas, the turkey, the cheese, and the spaghetti. Heated it through and stuck in oven for about 20 min. D-lish!

Very fattening but worth it. I cut the time down to half an hour and then put on the broiler in the oven for 4 minutes to make the top really brown. I also used wheat spaghetti just to make myself feel a little better, and added garlic and a lot of black pepper

This was pretty good, but I also added mixed veggies & breadcrumbs mixed w/ melted butter on top.  I divided into 2 pans and froze one.  I think the frozen one was better than the first.

Very tasty recipe for leftover turkey!  I used Swanson's Italian style chicken broth instead of the regular and a little extra parmesan and it was really good.  Also, it only took 45 minutes to bake.

This recipe was so quick and easy and so good!  I had some leftover lemon/garlic turkey tenderloin that I used.  I added about a cup of onions and a 1/2 cup of red peppers, along with some garlic and basil and I also used bowtie pasta instead of the angelhair.  My hard to please husband enjoyed it and I enjoyed the convenience.  Thanks

As written, it's too much cheese for me, but the basic idea was a good base for a lactose free variation but needed modifications.  I used 4 tbls each of butter and flour, sauteed mushrooms separately in olive oil and added later.  To the roux I added 1 can chicken broth and 2 c lactose free milk and left out the cheese.  I also sprinkled in onion and garlic powder as it was coming to a boil.  After it was in the casserole dish, I sprinkled a little bit of dried Parmesan just on the top and some plain bread crumbs.  Cooking time is too long - I only went 30 minutes and it was fine.

For an interesting taste, use zucchini noodles - they are awesome!

I really like this recipe, I always go for the ones made from scratch rather than cans of soup, etc.  I did follow the suggestions and added some sautéed red onion and celery, garlic powder, and frozen peas, which I think it needed.  This is a keeper!  And my hubby really liked it too.  :D

I gave this only 4 stars because I added to the recipe, it sounded too bland, but was a good base. I sautéed onions, celery, garlic, and mushrooms, then finished that off with some white wine, cooked until the wine was reduced. I also substituted a 1/4 cup of chicken stock with more white wine. I topped it with bread crumbs and crushed crispy onions, and baked for 45 min. My partner said it was the best he had ever had, I will definitely make it again, it's a great way to use up leftover turkey.

Excellent flavor but trust your instincts on the recipe times. I put the cheese on the top halfway through and it was perfect. Unfortunately, even though I thought it a bit long, I did bake it for the full hour. It was way over cooked. I would give it 45 min. next  time

This recipe, while good on its own, is just a building block. I have added sauted onions, mushrooms, peas, spinach, zucchini, whatever I have on hand. I have really loved spicing this recipe up. So does my family! I also have subbed the turkey for chicken. I just stop by grocery store and pick up a rotisserie chicken. So good

While this recipe was a little bland for my family, I gave it 4 stars because turkey can be very bland.The family loved the concept, so I tried another batch, this time using 2T dijon mustard, 1/3C white wine and 1/2 sour cream to the sauce. Reduced the chicken broth to 2 1/4 cups, and used Rotini because that's all I had. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

This was marvelous! I took advice from some of the reviewers and changed it up a bit by adding veggies. While the noodles were cooking, I sautéed half an onion, chopped, in a little olive oil until translucent, then added about 3tbs of butter and 8oz of sliced fresh mushrooms. Once the mushrooms were cooked through, I added some minced garlic, broccoli & the left-over turkey I had. Heated it through, then removed it all to my casserole dish to keep warm while I made the sauce, as directed. Once the sauce was done, I added the turkey & veggies back in to coat. Emptied the drained pasta into the casserole dish & poured the sauce over. I topped it with the remaining Parmesan, a little shredded Monterey Jack/cheddar and baked 25 minutes. Added French fried onions on top & put under the broiler for 2 minutes. My boyfriend ate nearly 1/3 of this all by himself & promptly asked when I was going to make it again!

I sauteed the following in the melted butter: 1 medium onion, diced; 1 tbsp minced garlic. For gluten free, I used Pillsbury All-Purpose gluten free flour and found that I used about 3/4 C., slowly whisked into the butter, onion, garlic. I know I have the right amount for flour added when the flour/butter mixture starts smelling like a pie crust. Note that the 1/2 C. regular flour as called for in this recipe is enough and my modification uses a different flour blend. Anyway, I slowly whisked in the 3 C chicken broth, and finally the 2 C. milk (again slowly whisking it in). I added salt and pepper to taste. Once, the mixture came to a boil, I added the parmesean cheese (I ran out of plain parm. cheese and used another parm. cheese I had on hand which had herbs in it).

EDIT - I tried to make this ahead and freeze, but found the texture of the pasta (gluten free) changed--a little too mushy when reheating. Next time, I would freeze just the mixture in a baking dish and make the pasta the day you plan to make the dish. Just thaw the tetrazzini in the fridge, make the pasta (al dente) and mix pasta into thawed mixture. Preheat oven to 350 and bake covered for 40 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking 15-20 minutes or until cheese is melted/bubbly.

This was a VERY good base recipe.  I ran out of the cheese, so I topped the miz w/ mozzarella that I had left over, along w/ some panko crumbs.
Next time, I think I'll add some veggies or something.  All in all, amazing!

Very good with a few alterations.  I sautéed some onion and garlic in olive oil and added that.  I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the sauce and reduced the chicken stock by a cup.  I added a can of peas (I'd probably add frozen instead if I make it again), and I topped the 9x13 pan with a combination of bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, mozzarella, and melted butter.  Everyone in the family (including two very, very picky pre-teens) liked it.  My two, teenaged boys asked for second helpings.

I'm rating this recipe on how it's written not what I did to salvage the dish. First off, the recipe doesn't call for any seasoning. Not even salt or pepper. So, obviously it's going to be bland AF unless you spice it up. I'd suggest something simple like thyme or maybe a Cajun spice blend. Second, the picture shows peas in it but there's no vegetables mentioned in the recipe so obviously add your own otherwise it's a casserole dish full of just bland pasta and turkey. Lastly, this tasted like I could have saved myself the trouble of making the roux and just dumped a can or two of condensed cream of mushroom/celery soup in there. I can't believe this recipe is getting rated 5 stars and no it wasn't "user error" on my part. I'm no Maromoto or Julia Child but I can definitely handle a simple casserole recipe. As written, this recipe is not good.

very good and topped this with shredded cheddar cheese instead.  Did not have peas on hand and made this Gluten Free for my family.  Used GF pasta and potato starch instead of regular flour.  Yummy and everyone loved it!

This was great!! The only modification I did was put less butter and instead of parmesan i sprinkled mozarella. My kids are not the biggest fan of cheesy casseroles big t this was just right for them. My 4  year old son had 2 helpings!

This was delicious - warm, comforting and hearty.  I topped with bread crumbs and everyone loved it.  I divided it into two casseroles - one for today and one for the freezer.

Good basic recipe, but for more flavor and nutritional value,  I sautéed 8 ounces baby Bella mushrooms, 1 large leek, cleaned and sliced thinly, 3 fat cloves of garlic finely chopped in some olive oil and butter.  Then I put the sautéed veg aside in a bowl and created the bechamel sauce.  I added the turkey to the sauce, cooked bucatini pasta al dente, added a ladle of the pasta water to the bechamel, and then combined veg, sauce and pasta and mixed well.  I had some leftover steamed green beans, so added those.  Then, I completed the last step of the recipe. Great flavor!  I agree with Julie-- half hour to 40 minutes of baking time is plenty, or it is too dry.

Alterations, b/c they worked:  1.chicken broth reduced to 2c, milk reduced to 1 1/2c, butter down to 4T, flour to 5T  3.sauteed garlic, onion, chopped celery, and mushrooms and added 1/4c white wine and continued cooking til mostly evaporated  4.cook time reduced down to 20min, which included the 5 min of broil to brown the bread crumbs.  Good flavor, but needed brightening up, so I added some lime zest I had on hand.  Really good casserole dish.  But now I realize I don't like pasta casserole dishes.  I really thought by undercooking the noodles and reducing the liquid and cooking time, I could make the pasta come out the just like it would had I not used the oven, but I still overshot.  I could try it again, but it was too much work.  It would have been easier to make the roux, mix in the sauteed aromatics, veggies, and protein, and add the perfectly cooked pasta.  Maybe someone can explain to me the point of cooking pasta in an oven.

This is how I made it, and the meat eaters in my family loved it. Second helpings all around. I sautéed a medium onion and 2 celery stalks in some canola oil until they were tender. Removed them and melted the butter in the same pan. Added 1 tsp tarragon, salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne, as well as the flour. Followed the rest of the recipe other than sprinkling the top with some panko as well as the rest of the parmesan, thanks to other reviewers. Baked for a little less time than indicated, just until the top was beginning to brown and the casserole was bubbly. Thanks for the great inspiration!

This was a great base for a recipe, but I did add things to give it more flavour.  I chopped up an onion, added some garlic, added some peas, and added some seasoned bread crumbs.  My family liked it and my husband especially enjoyed it a lot.  It was a great way to finish off the rest of our turkey from our Thanksgiving.

I would give it 5 stars with these additions:  1/2 chopped onion & 3-4 cloves crushed garlic sautéed in olive oil and set aside- add back in with pasta.  Spaghetti overcooks when baked (after being boiled) so I use rigatoni.

My family liked this dish very much.  It was so easy to put together. Next time I make it, I will try to make sure the noodles are covered with the sauce, because the exposed noodles on top got hard and crunchy, which I did not like.  My husband thought that was good, though! My changes: Used homemade turkey stock, added fresh broccoli to the spaghetti in the last minutes of cooking, put in a handful of leftover French Fried Onions and added just a bit of salt and pepper to the sauce.  I will make this again.

This was very good.  My husband made this dish on his own and it was ready when I got home.  This was a great use of leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  I will be using this recipe to use extra chicken.

I made this by the recipe but topped it with sharp cheddar cheese and it was great.  I made it with turkey for my family and with tuna for myself and both turned out really good!

I made this gluten free since my daughter was recently diagnosed with celiac disease.  I followed a few hints from a reviewer to make it a little more interesting.  I sauteed some celery, onion and garlic, then set aside while I got the rest ready.  I used brown rice pasta, and made the sauce with 1/2 cup gluten free all purpose flour in place of regular flour.  Once the sauce was done, I added about a cup of frozen peas and the sauteed veggies. It was fantastic!  Everyone loved it, including a few picky people.  DEFINITELY a keeper!

I took the advice of other reviewers and doctored this up a bit. I added garlic, mushrooms, s&p, and topped with buttered breadcrumbs. 40 minutes was imo too long it was pretty dry even then. Next time i'll try 30m. Great base recipe though -the sauce was perfect. Thanks!

I've never made a sauce from scratch before and I can't believe how easy it was and how good it tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly except changed my own veggies.  For some reason it turn out as good when I made it a second time.  But I will make again next time!

This is a great recipe for using up leftover turkey and makes a really comforting meal. I used mozza cheese in stead of parmesan, as that is what i had and it was very tasty. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

This was super easy and very delicious!  My husband said 4.5 stars!  Next time he wants me to try putting Fritos on top since it reminded him of a dish his mom made as a kid. I stuck to the recipe fairly close but the differences I did was 1/2 1% milk and the other half was half and half...I also had a cup of juices left from the turkey that I used with a can of Swansons Chicken Broth.  I also added peas...  This will be added to my Recipe box as a keeper! ;)

I've made this twice and both times it has turned out wonderful. Additions such as garlic, onion, mushroom and peas only make it better - but it is fantastic as written. The second time I made my own broth from the turkey carcass.  Excellent recipe! Goes a long way.

Needed an after Christmas leftover turkey dish.  Cooked it according to instruction,  added garlic and onion.  I went back for thirds.....the other 4 at the table politely declined seconds.  I took a poll for the rating.  I gave it a 4.  The rest 2,1,0,0.  I told everybody not to worry, I would only cook it 2 times a year at most....to which I got a a bunch of eyes rolling.  Oh well...I tried

Great basic recipe, although I tweaked to fit what I had on hand and liked my substitutions.  Used 1 cup heavy cream instead of 2 cups milk (richer, thicker), used 1/3 cup flour, used turkey stock (obvious leftover from Thanksgiving bird!), used wide egg noodles instead of spaghetti (not a tangled mess). Added sauteed onions & sliced mushrooms.  Also added small brocolli florets, plunged in with noodles near the end of cooking.  Added a pinch of nutmeg. Added seasoned bread crumbs on top per other review (definite crispy plus!).  I know...not much like the original recipe, but it shows that you can add/change to your liking.  That's why I gave it 5 stars!

Great recipe for a quick and easy dinner. Not so good for the ones counting calories though! I added onion flakes, salt, pepper and used 1 cup of half and half in place of 1 of the cups of the milk (fo a richer flavor). Perfect for using the leftover Thanksgiving turkey!

I made this pretty much exactly as written, except added sautéed minced garlic & onion, and it was a great way to use up leftover turkey. I'll probably add veggies and more seasoning next year.

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly and although it was well received I would add salt and pepper next time, as well as possibly a little more liquid as it was a tad on the dry side.  All in all, a good recipe, though, and I thank you for sharing it!

I've heard of so many people making tetrazzini out of leftover turkey, I thought I'd give it a try. It was good, reminded me of tuna casserole. It made a whole lot. More than what my family of five could eat in one night. Lots of leftovers of this too.

This is a great recipe. Take my advice though, make it just like the recipe says. The only thing I changed was the pasta. I use a large tube pasta like penne or rigatoni or mastacoli.Don't add veggies or do anything different and don't bother trying to substitute chicken. This is very popular and even gets requested. Thanks! :)

Mmmmmm I made this for dinner and it was delicious! I used turkey stock instead of broth, and it turned out great. I also followed some other reviewers  advice and sauteed celery and garlic in oil and added it in. I didnt end up using all the sauce for some reason, and next time I think I'll make less. Overall, it was great thanks for posting!!!

The sauce alone is amazing. I only gave it three stars because I felt that it needed some sort of veggie in it and a breadcrumb topping. Also this gets dry when baking for some reason. Otherwise this is phenomenal!

Delicious! We did not put it in the oven and it was excellent with penne.

Pretty tasty. Though in my opinion the sauce could use more flavor. Maybe an herb, or garlic. Something. Next time I will salt and pepper more to taste, as I followed the recipe exactly. makes a TON of food. I also added a whole bag of frozen peas. But really you could add frozen corn, carrots. etc. Very kid friendly though.

I was questioning how good this could be with so few ingredients, but tried it because I wanted to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  It was WAY better than I had expected!  In fact I am making it again tonight for the 2nd time this week!  Made it exactly as directed except that I put a mixture of parmesan and cheddar on top.  Excellent!

This was better than I expected, as I am not a fan of turkey.  I used leftover Thanksgiving turkey, added one cup frozen peas, one can sliced mushrooms and omitted the parmesan cheese and instead topped it with mozzarella.  Baked for 30 minutes.  My boyfriend loved it!  Thank you for the recipe!

This was an awesome way to get rid of a lot of left over turkey.  My family loved it!  I added garlic but stuck to the rest of the recipe to the T.

The dish turned out much too dry.  I cut the receipe in half (4 servings) and didn't notice until too late that all the ingredients didn't also half (my fault!).

This was very good. I baked mine for about 30 minutes and it was perfect after it set for about 5 minutes. It really thickened up. I, of course, used leftover Thanksgiving turkey for this recipe. Also I didn't have any spaghetti so I used a garden rotini that I had on hand. It was really good. My only thing is that it needs some more seasoning, some onion, and garlic for starters. I will be making this again, my family really liked this. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm a little surprised at all the rave reviews for this recipe.  I made as recipe written and it is extremely bland.  If nothing else it needs salt and pepper but would probably taste better with some sauteed garlic and white wine in sauce.  Will definitely not waste my time on this again.

Yum!  I can't cook but decided to try this because it had so few ingredients and i needed a recipe for my leftover turkey.  It was a great success and I feel like a little bit of a cook today.  Yay!

Per several of the reviews, I added sauted minced garlic, diced celery, diced onions, peas and mushrooms to the mix. I topped the mix with a few handfuls of crushed French's Fried Onions. It was good, but not great. Since I changed the original recipe so much, I don't know how to rate it.   I think I'll give a 4, with reservations.  Next time I'll make the very similar MVANWINKLES Tuna Casserole From Scratch, using the turkey instead of tuna.

I agree with others that this is a good basic recipe. However, I add a dash of nutmeg, pepper and 1/4 cup of white wine to the sauce and add mushrooms, broccoli and carrots with the turkey. Also, it only needs about 30 minutes to cook - otherwise it can be too dry.

Good use of leftover turkey.  I only made 1/2 the sauce and used leftover gravy for the other half.  We had freshly grated Parmesan cheese to use and it was nice and savory.  Great with a side of leftover cranberries.

We liked this a lot!  Made many of the suggested changes - added onions, celery, carrot, mushrooms.  I found I had to add "something" regarding seasoning and added Lawry's seasoning salt.   DH went back for thirds!

This is a great recipe for the most part, but I gotta say it was rather bland and in need of salt.  Next time I think I'll add garlic powder, salt and pepper to the mixture before mixing with the spaghetti.

This was really good. I added onions, garlic, fresh chopped parsely, fresh mushrooms, and peas & carrots to the sauce mixture then added the noodles. Poured it into a greased pan, topped it with the cheese and baked. I will definately make this again.

This turned out really well for me. Except I was out of the chicken broth and used condensed golden mushroom soup with about 1/2 can of milk to the mix instead. I used 1/2 cup fresh grated parmesean and 1/2 cup Kraft Italiano cheese. I also added 3 strips of cooked bacon chopped up. Everyone liked it, thanks for the great ideas everyone!

Great base recipe that allows variations. I followed some other reviewers' advice and added sauteed onion, garlic and celery, and freshly ground pepper. I was out of Parmesan cheese so I used mostly Gruyere with maybe a couple of tablespoons of Parmesan and it was GREAT, probably even better than the whole Parmesan version, in my opinion. :) Definitely not the most healthy dish in the universe but great comfort food!

I have never had turkey tetrazzini before so I wasnt sure what to expect. I wanted to use some frozen leftover turkey.  This was great.  I did what some others suggested and added onion, garlic, and mushrooms.  My whole family loved it.

YUM!  What a perfect way to use my turkey leftovers!  I made the whole dish even though there's just the two of us.  I refrigerated what we didn't eat, and in the morning, cut and wrapped individual packages to freeze.  This is a great meal!

Simple and delicious.  I do think it calls for too much pasta though - scale back a bit if you like it nice and saucy.

This is a keeper.  I used penne pasta and added mushrooms and spinach.  Even my two year old liked it.  Put some up in the freezer for those nights when time is short.  Can't wait to have it again.

Oh wow - I just made this to use up our leftover turkey. My very picky children and my husband gobbled it up.   Some reviews say it is bland - so I did add a bit of garlic when melting the butter, and this helped...but young kids usually prefer a bit bland anyways (not the word I would have used though), so it was perfect.   The only other change I made was to use one 375g package whole grain Penne Rigate noddles instead of spaghetti noodles. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I cooked for 50 min at the recommended temp and did not find it dry at all - very saucy. My husband and I mixed a wee bit of fiery jerk sauce into our bowls before we gobbled it up and it WAS AMAZING!!! Can't wait until tomorrow to eat the rest!

So simple to make! I followed others advice and started with sautee of garlic and onions in olive oil. I love how it has simple ingredients, ones that I have around.

This turned out great.  I made a several tweaks though.  I didn't have spaghetti so I used bowtie pasta, which was fine.  And as many other reviewers, I started w/garlic and onion in the pan before making the roux and added frozen peas and sliced mushrooms to the sauce along with some leftover poultry herbs I had on hand (thyme and sage).  And finally, I used a combo of panko breadcrumbs and olive oil for the topping.      But I really liked this as a starter recipe, because I was able to use up all my leftover turkey, and the sauce was really tasty.  It's so versatile, because you can play with the veggies, spices and topping you decide to use in the recipe.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I sauted onion, garlic and celery in the butter, then finished according to recipe (adding a little salt and pepper to taste).  I used fresh grated parmesan cheese on top and the stuff in the green can mixed in and it was fantastic.  Even my picky eater said "I LOVE this stuff".  It tasted great the next day too.

very tasty, i'll make it again.  I used egg noodles & I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed up some special K cereal with the parmeasan.  Definately cover with foil & 30 minutes was plenty long to bake.

Made this tonight. This recipe cut in 1/2 made more than a 9x13 dish. I did as others suggested & sauted onion & garlic. Also made a white roux in the onion/garlic with the butter & flour. Folded in 8 oz. of sour cream just before adding the parmigiana to the sauce. I had left over smoked turkey that was dry as heck, this was a good way to use it. Would suggest this for your leftovers.

This was excellent.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I did add some onion and garlic to it.  But it would have been excellent even without it.  Thanks for a great recipe.  L.

This was fantastic! I used a fried cajun turkey and halfed since there is only 2 of us.  As well I added a little dash of creole seasoning since the turkey had been previously seasoned with it.  I also added a jar of mushrooms and used angel hair so as not to stuff us too much it was wonderful.  Only 4 stars because on my second helping I was letting my stomach settle and I'm not sure the sauce will keep the turkey as moist as it was when it came out of the oven.

Delicious!  Sauteed the onion with some garlic first.  Halved the butter.  Would probably be even better with some mushrooms and peas.

I gave it the same modifications as everyone else did.  I divided mine in half and froze the other for a quick meal later.  Great way to use up those last remainder pieces from your turkey.

This recipe was no flavor & too much liquid! It needs some garlic salt, celery salt, salt, pepper & something in it besides just the boiling water for the pasta.

this was really really good!  Only thing is that mine was a bit dry when reheating for leftovers so i might increase milk and stock to create a bit more sauce next time.

Very good.  I followed the reviews including adding a diced onion and 4 cloves of garlic and sauteing them in olive oil....I used 2% milk, and Italian cheese blend in the sauce....definitely use a 13x9 pan and it will be very full!  I added a bag of sweet peas and I topped it with the italian cheese blend, italian bread crumbs, and italian seasioning...Definitly only bake for 30-40 minutes and it will be plenty done...YUM!

AMAZING!  I took the previous advice and added some onions and garlic to the butter before adding the flour, but SO good, and a great alternative to endless turkey sandwiches.

This was delightfully creamy and very yummy!  I didn't have enough Parmesan cheese so I substituted some mozzarella to make up the right quantity and it turned out great!  We will definitely make it again.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for to use on leftover Holiday turkey. The texture was great! I used Colby Jack cheese instead of the parm. cheese called for. May require a little  extra help from seasonings depending on taste, otherwise could be "bland". I tossed in some Garlic salt and lots of pepper.

Decent way to use up that leftover turkey. This recipe needs more flare. Yes to onions and some garlic, but even THAT wasn't enough. Next time, I'll add some mushrooms, use a variety of cheeses, and maybe some peppers. Some fresh herbs couldn't hurt either. This was a good "starter" recipe with plenty of room for some creativity. . . which it needs.

My son and husband loved this.  My daughter did not (no surprise there, my son and daughter rarely agree on food).  I added some chopped onions, minced garlic, and salt and pepper for extra flavor. Great way to eat up turkey leftovers.  Will make it again.

Awesome! My daughter loved it! I used high fiber pasta and my family didn't even notice. Added a little salt and pepper to my own plate but the kids got by without it. Delicious with a bag of frozen peas tossed in. I think shredded Parmesan will work better than the highly grated Kraft Parmesan.

This recipe was super easy, delicious, and easy to add to.  To make it your very own, add celery,mushrooms or red peppers.  I added my favorite, garlic for a tasty option for my left over turkey.  With this basic recipe, the options are unlimited.  Cooked as is, it is a kid favorite!

Great but just used 2 cups chicken broth (that's all I had)and 2 cups milk.  and it was just perfect, not runny, just nice and moist.

Family loved it so much after Thanksgiving, we'll do it again after Christmas.  

Cheddar and/or mozzarella cheese are fine substitutes.

I sauteed 8 or 9 crushed garlic cloves and 3 small onions and also added  ~3t. crushed dry basil, which added a nice flavor. Used Turkey broth (a can was leftover from Xmas) since I had no chicken broth.   I followed the recommendations about cooking for less time, which I did, for 30 minutes.  The pasta absorbed too much sauce and it was a bit dry.   We thought that maybe a can or two of cream of celery or cream of mushroom soup would have added the necessary "creaminess" to the sauce, which was all that was lacking in this dish.   The sauce tasted amazing before mixing with the pasta, my family couldn't wait.   Definitely will try next time, with a few more modifications. ; )

MAde according to directions with the addition of fresh garlic and onion.  This was very tasty dish but agree that it doesn't need to bake for an hour, it dries it out to much.  I did 40 and it wa sa bit dry, next time 30 min.  Very tasty!

An easy to make recipe with just a few ingredients. I made this with leftovers for my husband and I, so the recipe was halved. I started out by adding some minced garlic into the butter with a little oil, and substituted out whole wheat spaghetti pasta. I didn't have parmesan cheese on hand, so I used 1/2 c. cheddar cheese in the casserole and 1/4 c. on top, then baked for 40 minutes. It came out great! Thanks for sharing this easy recipe!

This is a good basic recipe.  I added mushrooms, garlic & onion and would add peas in the future.

This was great when first prepared, but dried out the next day.  I would add more milk to make it soupier next time.  It also makes a huge amount. I will try to cut in half the next time I make it.

Wow! Was I surprised at how good this turned out. The biggest changes I made, which I think are important, I sauteed chopped garlic and onion in the butter. (I also used less butter...about 5-6 tbs). We love garlic, so I used a lot. I also used milk instead of cream and topped it with Italian bread crumbs. I cooked it in a 9x13 pan, covered the last half of baking time. It was so good, and it used up a lot of our leftover turkey! Thanks for this great recipe! (I gave it a 4* because it needs the garlic.)

Very good recipe- my fiance's mom used to make this, so I was following up the best, and totally came through!!  I would add some onion and garlic next time, as others suggested- I thought it needed just a tad more flavor.  Thanks for sharing!!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I sauteed onion and celery first, then added flour to make roux.  Then added milk and broth.  Also added frozen peas.  Great use of leftover turkey.

Modified this quite a bit.  I couldn't bring myself to use that much butter so I sauteed onions and garlic in EVOO for a couple minutes with a tablespoon or so of margarine.  Then I added half a jar of pimentos,some frozen peas and the turkey.  After it was warmed through, I added white whole wheat flour and mixed.  I added a fair slug of cooking sherry when I added my liquids.  I added some Zender's chicken seasoning with my Parmesan for extra flavor.  I poured it over the noodles, mixed well and dumped it in the baking dish.  I didn't want it to dry out too much so I used foil. It dried out a bit anyway, but it was delicious that way.  My daughter just added a bit of milk to hers to make it creamy and everyone was happy.  Worked well.

Simple. Best if you start it as the french base sauce by melting the butter and mixing flour in slowly then add the broth etc. Also, I cut back on some of the parm cheese so it wasn't too salty and added mushrooms and peas to make a bit healther for the children. It is a simple all around good dish that all my children will eat.

Awesome recipe as originally made, kids love it, asked for seconds, and then asked for the leftovers. We've also made it half 'n' half, half as original for the kids, and half spicy.  Just add your extras to one half when moving to the baking pan.

Made this last night and used up a lot of my leftover turkey.  Yeah!  My hubby and I thought it was delicious.  My 19-year-old daughter thought it was too rich.  I did add 1/3 extra cup of parm to the top and some celery, but I don't think it affected the overall results very much (I know there are people who hate reviews that are not strictly based on the original!).  I would absolutely make this again.

We loved this dish... I was all out of Turkey so I used chicken and it was great. I cut it in half just to try it but next time I will make the full amount. Hubby says it would be good if we used shrimp. I will try it for him but I am not much of a Sea food person unless it is deep fried LOL!!! A keeper for use!!!

Great great great!!! Made this with our turkey leftovers tonight and it was perfect. I did sautee garlic with the butter and added a little salt and pepper to my sauce. Used about 1 C of cheese in the sauce and that was plenty. I did not add anything to it (picky kids) but mushrooms would be great as would peas. Will also try this with leftover ham. Thanks for an easy AND delicious recipe!

This made SO MUCH that I reserved 1/2 of the sauce/turkey mxture (w/ mixed veggies).  I'll make a pot pie w/ the other half for another night.

I also had some left over fresh herbs - I added these to the mixture.

I wonder how it would taste to substitute cooking white wine for some of the broth....

Four stars because I felt the noodles were too dry.  I lost a little bit of broth as my pot boiled over, but also, I failed to read review comments before hand which said to cut bake time by about 20 minutes.  Next time I'll be sure to read comments.

My little one, however, loved it.!

SOOO DELICIOUS! I made minor adjustments and added minced garlic with olive oil to the melted butter, and topped it with extra Parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs. Baked it for 40 minutes and it's YUMMY! Easy too!

Made this with left over turkey from Thanksgiving and it was really really good. I didn't use all the parmesan cheese it called for (just a cup and a 1/3) and topped with parmesan bread crumbs. I did sautee onion and garlic with the butter. I didn't season the chicken broth mixture, but it was still really good!

This is really good and a great way to use up leftover turkey. I love turkey sandwiches, but after awhile you need a change after having SO much turkey. So I make this recipe when my husband gets burnt on the turkey sandwich. I don't change a thing, follow the recipe to a T and it's great every time!

Really great way to round out "turkey season" by putting the lefovers into this habit-forming dish. I followed the original recipe but added a couple shakes of nutmeg and some salt and fresh pepper to the sauce. Our two picky-eater kids couldn't stop picking at it!

Delicious and easy - I added some shredded Cheddar cheese on top (ran out of Parmesan) and it was well-liked.

Family loved it.

Use half olive oil, half butter.
Add roasted pine nuts, 2 cloves minced garlic (sauteed), 1 Tbl fresh parsley, 1 tsp salt, pepper.

I needed a good idea to use my left over turkey.  I thought it was good! Because I had it on hand, I used the turkey drippings instead of the chicken broth, and I also put garlic in with the butter. I crumbled buttered bread crumbs on top and my guests were very happy! Thank you!

This is a great recipe for using up leftover turkey!  My husband really enjoyed it.  I basically followed Rebecca Jo's review suggestions and then split the tetrazzini into two 8x8x2 pans and put one dish in the freezer.

Awesome!  I had baked a turkey breast and then put in crock pot the next day in broth & butter so the turkey was already tender and flavored.  My family loved this.

This was good and very easy.  If you are looking for a really really good chicken tetrazzini to serve to company, do yourselves a favor and try Giada De Laurentis's chicken tetrazzini on the food network website.  It's by far the best I have ever made.  A bit more time consuming but well worth it.

Fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly except used fettucini instead of spaghetti and added paprika to the top before putting in oven. Rich, delicious, and easy to make. My girlfriend exclaimed, "Fantastic," after she took her first bite, which sums up this recipe and was a great compliment! Thank you!

This recipe was fabulous! We have about 20 people over for Thanksgiving every year and end up throwing away a lot of turkey, but not last time! What a great way to use up dark meat. Truly delicious. Save the white meat for your sandwiches, and the dark meat for your Tetrazzini! This is now an after Thanksgiving tradition at our house.

Made a few changes - I made a Turkey for Easter and instead of the 3 cups of chicken broth, I used 2 cups of the turkey drippings from the pan and 1 cup of chicken broth.  Also, I didn't bake it for 1 hour - I don't think it needs this long because  everything is already cooked - so I just cooked it about 30 minutes until everything was hot and bubbly.  I added an onion and 3 cloves garlic which I sauteed in the butter. Absolutely delicious and a great use for leftover turkey, but I think the recipe as written would be slightly bland.

This recipe was pretty good. I used garlic chicken broth instead of plain. Im glad I did because without the garlic I think this recipe would've been very bland.

Next time Im going to add in sauteed onions and Asiago cheese. 

Overall it was pretty good and I'd make this again. My family liked it also.

I didn't like this... it wasn't bland because I added sauteed onion, garlic, mushrooms, and extra salt. It tasted really good before I baked it. After it was baked I just didn't like the texture. I thought the spagetti would get all yummy and crisp on top. It didn't, if I were to make it again I wouldn't bake it.

This was an OK way to use up left over turkey.  I made it because I had every ingredient and didn't have to run to the store for anything.  My children ate it and my husband liked the garlic in the recipe.  One hour to cook is WAY too long, I cooked it for 40 minutes. Not a good left over because it's too dry by the next day.  I'll probably make this again because it is an inexpensive meal using many of my pantry items & left-over turkey.

This was a great base recipe, but would make it healther and add a pack of frozen peas and carrots towards the end of the sauce before pouring it in the casserol dish. 
The dishes were wiped clean and we barely had any leftovers! 
Very yummy, thank you!

Another reviewer was right.  Should have used half the pasta.  Although it was very good still I would have liked it to be a bit more saucy.  BUT it is a casserole not a sauce to go with pasta.  I added onion, garlic, 2 cans of mushrooms and peas.  It made a tonne!!  Great for our leftover New Years turkey.  Thanks

I started to make this with our leftover turkey and realized the turkey was bad. So I had to use what I had available, which was tuna!! I ended up using three cans of drained tuna and it turned out really well. My 2 year old loved it!! Which is a miracle to get her to eat anything! I will definitley try this again...maybe with the turkey this time, or maybe even leftover ham!!

Good way to give leftover turkey a new taste. I added extra spices to the mix like salt, pepper, onion powder, italian seasoning and garlic. I didn't have spaghetti noodles so I used elbow macaroni instead. Tasted great - even my picky eater cleaned his plate. Now that's saying something.

This was a good base.  I added roasted vegs, more garlic and onion, and made a few of the other changes suggested by others.  But the best change I made was the addition of roasted squash leftover from Christmas dinner -I scooped the flesh out and just folded that in with everything else.  It gave it a really nice sweetness, and snuck vegs into the kids.

Good, easy basic recipe but if you just follow the recipe it is very bland.  Needs salt, pepper, garlic, and probably a little onion powder or something.

This recipe is so much better than the one I grew up with ( olives, pimentos, condensed soup). I did add sliced fresh mushrooms and extra cheese. I will use this recipe every time I have leftover turkey. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good.  David liked it.  I added sauted mushrooms, onions, and garlic.  It made a huge amount.  Use a really big baking dish or two smaller ones.

Sorry, I thought it was bland. I had to add two teaspoons worchestershire sauce and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper.  With the additions I liked it, but next time I would add more things like sauteed mushrooms or something.

This is a great recipe, but I made a few modifications like some of the other reviewers. First off, there is not enough sauce for this amount of noodles, so i would cut the noodles in half, only use half the package instead of the whole thing. I added some garlic powder, chili flakes, dried thyme, sald and pepper to the sauce. I even needed to add more salt after it was baked. Oh and I also peas to the sauce. (Frozen peas)I sprinkled bread crumbs on the top before baking like another person recommended, and only baked for 30 minutes. Next time I will saute some onions and garlic with the butter, and maybe add mushrooms. This is a great recipe! Its nice because you can add what you like.

I don't think I've ever seen a Turkey Tetrazzini recipe without mushrooms -- or, for that matter, any vegetables whatsoever. Sounds kind of boring.

My whole family loved this recipe, as we had a lot of leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I did saute onions and garlic and fried some bacon to add to it as I thought it could be a bit bland without, and as I said it was a big hit. Will definately use again!
Thanks

The flavor is good, with added onions & mushrooms ... but I cut the pasta in half & still should have doubled the sauce!

Thank you so much for this FABULOUS recipe!  My husband is not a big fan of turkey anyway, so I needed something good to get him to eat the leftovers... He (and both my boys) LOVED this dish!  They all even ate leftovers of the leftovers!!!!

The only thing I did differently was that I used rotini noodles instead of spaghetti because that is what I had on hand... and I threw in a package of frozen peas and carrots to sneak in some veggies!

I made this recipe because my daughter is breastfeeding a new born and I new it would not have anything that could cause the baby gas.....it was very well accepted. I did  make more sauce so it, but still found it not quite enough. I think the next time I will lower the amount of spegetti I used, because it made an enormous amount. I also added mushrooms and petite peas. Tonight for leftovers I will make some more sauce o pour over the serving.....I will definitely make this again.

This really has a wonderful taste.   However, it makes too much food for us so I will cut the recipe down by half next time.   I think you could use this with Italian sausage and it would be wonderful.

I modified this according to a co-worker's recipe...I added green olives and mushrooms. But next time I will probably omit the green olives, it gave it to overwhelming a flavor of olives.

I really like this base recipe, but I gave it four stars because I think it needed some improvement. I went with a lot of the other suggestions and added some cheddar cheese, mushrooms, green peppers, garlic, and some spices. It really made for a good dinner. Also, I cut the spaghetti in half, and it made plenty for my regular casserole dish.

Pretty good. Def saute some minced garlic and onions before you do the other stuff. I added Majoram and ended up with a pretty tastey dish. Good way to use those left overs.

I found this meal to be incredibly bland... even with the added onion, garlic, and curry powder.  If I make this again, I'll have to add some serious spice.

Excellent!  I sauted 2/3 cup onions chopped, 3 cloves garlic chopped and 10-15 mushrooms sliced.  I substituted the parmesan cheese for half cheddar and half swiss cheese.  Then baked it in an 8x12 baking dish at 400 for 20 minutes.  Best turkey leftover recipe ever!

Good basic recipe, followed it except I used half Romano and half Parmesan and I seriously doubt I used as much as the recipe called for, the baking time is too long, or it needs more moisture before baking, next time I will have at least another cup of cheese sauce, but there will be a next time. I served this with fresh whole cranberry sauce and a salad. Both of my kids liked this as well

I added fresh mushrooms to this dish and I thought it was delicious.  My husband liked it (he gave it 4 stars), but he thought it was a bit bland.   Next time I will add the sauteed onions and garlic like others suggested just to give it a little more flavor.  I wasn't at all disappointed, however....I still went back for seconds.

Great use of leftover turkey.  Kids & husband all loved it.  Not the most flavorful or exciting recipe but it did the trick.  Used half cheddar and half parm cheese - that's what I had on hand.  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a delicious and hearty recipe. Everyone in my family loves. The recipe also made better leftovers with a thick and hearty sauce. The only problem I had was the size caserole dish called for was not big enough and caused a mess in the over. But other than that it was a great meal.

I picked this recipe because my husband and I LOVE parmesean cheese!  We loved it, although next time I would cut down on the baking time and add some salt, pepper, and some kind of veggie.  Otherwise it was very good.  I may take the advice of some of the other reviews as well in sauteeing some onions & garlic as well.  We will be making this one again! :-)

I have followed the recipe as printed several times and it has always been a hit at home. Yesterday we had company company from away and I had a lot of left over turkey. IIn place of chicken broth, I used 2 cans of mushroom soup, 2 cups of milk and various chopped vegetables. WOW! some hit every one wanted the recipe. Next time in place of noodles I will try rice.

This was a quick and easy way to use up leftovers! Though I did use real butter, I substituted skim milk and the sauce was still thick and creamy. I also added garlic powder and fresh black pepper. I have 4 little picky eaters and they, as well as my husband loved it. My 18-month- old even had seconds!

YUMMY!!!!After reading other reviewers' suggestions, I did add onions and mushrooms sauteed with garlic and some frozen peas. I also added a few  tablespoons of sour cream before I baked it as another reviewer suggested. It came out very creamy. One other change I made was in the cheese. I only had a little fresh parmesan on hand, so I also used some fresh grated asiago. The flavor was wonderful! My husband doesn't like spaghetti noodles, so I substituted mini lasagna noodles and they worked great! Leftovers reheated wonderfully as well - I again added a little sour cream prior to reheating to combat dryness. Even my very picky 3 year old loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!

Great way to use up leftovers.  Recipe reminds me of an alfredo sauce.  I did follow others suggestions and added sauted onions, mushrooms and garlic.  Consistancy was not too thick.  I only baked long enough to melt and brown parmesan on top.

I added more chicken broth and only baked it for 45 minutes.  I also added a lot of garlic and onion powder.  The taste was good, but it was too dry for my taste.

I did make changes per my families tastes added peas and carrots ,garlic and cheddar and parmesean mix on top and broiled it the last few minutes to brown the cheese and it was scrumptious... Great way to use up turkey.

What a simple and tasty recipe.  If you're having a hard time thinking of something for dinner and you want it to quick and easy, this is the dish.  Good reviews from the family.  After some discussion, we decided crumbled bacon and sauteed mushrooms and onions would make a good addition.  Though everyone was happy with it just as it was.  Enjoy!

Yum!! This is delicious as is...I added leftover veggies as well. In all honesty, I used some leftover penne pasta in place of the spaghetti. Win win situation!! Thanks for the post.

I really liked this recipe.  The only changes I made was to add some diced onion, celery and carrots.  I sauteed them first and then continued with the recipe.  Also I used 2.5 cups of milk and .5 cup of heavy cream.

This was very good.  I made it ahead on Christmas Eve morning so I could just stick it in the oven when we returned from Mass.  It was a hit with everyone and very convenient, easy to make.  I tried some of the suggestions in other reviews and first sauteed some onion and garlic in olive oil.  I also topped it with shredded mozzarella instead of parmesan.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

No changes to recipe.  I don’t eat meat but made this for my husband who does.  Turned out great.  Didn’t add mushrooms as he won’t eat them but very easy to make and it satisfied a picky eater.  It’s a winner.

Eh.... I mean if you have THAT much leftover turkey and you've already used it in 2/3 other better recipes, give this a try. Otherwise, move along - there's nothing to see here. However, if you are desperate enough to try it, here's what you should know: It is pretty lackluster, bland even. I was low on parmesan and had some leftover feta, so I added that. It helped some. I didn't want to add any veggies because my 18 year old son eats like a 3 year old, so I added some spices. Paprika was okay, but decided to add some nutmeg and that  punched it up a bit. Cajun spices and red/green/yellow bell pepper would have been a good option too. Just nothing special if you don't fix it up.

This dish was very easy to prepare. I added some leftover veggies from our Thanksgiving dinner wich made a good addition to the dish, but otherwise I followed the recipe as it is here. My husband enjoyed it and asked me to prepare more dishes like this; I thought it was on the bland side, but will make it again and experiment with ways to enhance its flavor. I would have  given it an additional half star if that were an option.

This was okay,  I would make it again but with some changes.  I did find it kind of bland.  And when baked there was a lot of hard pieces of pasta that dried out.  I would suggest maybe putting some shredded mozzarella cheese on top to prevent it from drying.  I did add some  sauteed onion, mushrooms and celery.  Garlic as well.  But needs more seasoning.

I make this every year with the leftover turkey.  It is excellent and the whole family loves it.  I add onions, celery, sherry wine to the broth and milk, and top it with bread crumbs.  I only bake for 40 minutes.  I might try adding cheese next time.

Very good. Followed directions exactly, except added minced garlic. Next time I will try adding some vegetables. Thanks!! Panko bread crumbs on top (sprayed with butter spray) with little shreeded cheese. This time added peas, mushrooms and onions. Served wth garlic bread. Its a hit with out additions. Makes ALOT! Family of 4 could eat this days.

Delicious!  My picky eater kids at it too!

The recipe is fairly basic so I would suggest adding some more flavor either when you cook the turkey, or by adding some celery, onions, mushrooms, onion, herbs or spices, et.  

I also added the bread crumb topping and used a combo of milk and heavy cream.

The only change I made was I added sun dried tomatoes, and this was fabulous.

Easy and delicious. I used half and half  instead of cream. I actually realized I was out of Parmesan and so left it out and it was still great. I threw in some peas for good measure! Will definitely make again.

A winner! Looking for “mom’s” flavors so I added sliced sauted mushrooms and a 1/2 c sweet sherry or wine. We will make this again!

I did a gluten free version which was very tasty - and my boyfriend didn't even know it was gluten free!
Used GF mini shell pasta, almond milk, GF flour and GF bread crumbs.  It took a while (maybe 20 min) to get the milk/broth/flour mix to boil and get thick, but thankfully it worked:-)  Also added sauteed mushrooms, peas and onion. I did have to bake it the full hour, unlike other reviewers who cut to 40 min.

Excellent way to use up that leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  I sauteed onions & shitaki mushrooms and added them with the turkey which rounded out this dish.  I'll definitely make it the weekend after Thanksgiving next year!

I used some of the tips that Rebecca Jo suggested. Sauteed chopped celery, onion, garlic in olive oil...then added sliced mushrooms and sauteed until mushrooms are tender. Then made a roux and added the sherry and milk. Lastly added some peas with the turkey and Parmesan. Topped the dish with more Parmesan and some panko bread crumbs.

This recipe is great for leftover turkey! I did add a can of mushrooms to the sauce mix. My only other advice would be  is NOT to add the pasta to the baking dish (using a 9x13 pan isn't enough room to stir and coat the pasta with the sauce). My recommendation is grab a big bowl add the pasta and sauce to it - stir well to coat all pasta and then pour into 9x13 pan, add cheese topping.

There are a bunch of tetrazzini recipes on AR. I chose this one because it did not use canned soup, so you have more control over the fat and salt situation. It was easy to put together, the white sauce comes together easily. I made the base recipe as written and added sautéed baby Bella mushrooms, onion and garlic. I added cayenne for a little kick. Husband loved it.

Good base for this dish, but it definately needs some additions. We love mushrooms and onions in ours which I fried in the butter before adding the flour. I also added garlic and a dash of worcestershire and some cayenne pepper. I was out of milk but had 1/2 and 1/2 which made it pretty rich but delicious.

Delicious recipe. I doubled the ingredients so I could make two pans worth. I ended up with extra sauce that would not fit in the pans so I made a third later. I followed other suggestions to put in frozen peas, Italian seasonings and chopped onion and garlic to the recipe. This would also be yummy with chopped spinich. I used half and half instead of milk which helped to make the sauce thicker. I used a rotisserie turkey breast to expedite the cooking. This would be a great Thanksgiving left over dish. I will make this again.

I made this last night with a few changes. I sauted fresh garlic and diced onion, celery and a handful of spinach til soft, then added the chopped cubed turkey to mix. In a separate pan, melted margarine, added 1/4 cup of flour and 2 cups of milk making a roux, then added 2 cups of chicken stock, not 3 cups..and grated parmesan cheese til thickened. I cooked whole wheat pasta, drained it and added it to the turkey mix, then the mostly thickened sauce. I transferred to a baking dish, covered and cooked at 350 for 30 minutes. Hubby said was the best whole wheat pasta dish ever, 2 thumbs UP!

Delicious! I gave it four stars because it needs some doctoring up--like others, I added garlic and mushrooms. Also added frozen peas. I cut back the liquid by a cup and added a panko crumb crust to the top. Will definitely make again! Oh yeah--even though parmesean is salty, you will need to add salt and pepper at the end or the white sauce is a bit bland.

We didn't have enough Parmesan cheese so we used 3 cups of grated marble cheddar instead, and we also added 1 cup of frozen peas.  The recipe turned out *fantastic* and will be our go-to recipe for leftover turkey.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly as is, but cut it in half for just the two of us.  I  would probably use less peas the next time.  My husband never eats casseroles, but he loved it.  Will definitely make this one again as we always have either turkey or chicken leftovers.

Very good but I didn't like the parmesan cheese on top - next time I'll put cheddar and bread crumbs to melt/brown when heating it up.  I cut it in half and still had leftovers.  Great way to get rid of that turkey.

This is a good base recipe to start, but does invite some additions for personal preference.  I started by sauteing one small onion, 2 stalks of celery and 2 cloves of garlic with the butter in a saucepan.  I added the flour along with 1/2 tsp black pepper and 3/4 tsp sea or himalayan salt.  Stir to cook out the flour for a couple of minutes before adding some homemade turkey stock and the milk.  Simmer until thickened, then stir in cubed turkey, parmesan cheese and about 3/4 cup frozen peas.  Toss with the cooked pasta (I used linguine) and place in casserole dish.  I had some leftover bread stuffing that I made into breadcrumbs that I used to top the casserole with before baking.  Delicious comfort food and a great way to use up leftovers!

Excellent with the additions of onion, celery, garlic, and half a can of mild green Chile's. Sprinkled with parmesan and mozzarella and bread crumbs. Also used white wine to substitute for some off the chicken broth. And. I added some Italian herbs to the mixture. It was fabulous! We each had three servings.

I used leftover Thanksgiving Turkey picked off the bones for this one. In a stock pot, I softened chopped celery, sweet onion and sweet peppers, 8 oz of sour cream, 2 cans of mushroom soup, 2 cups of homemade turkey stock, garlic powder, thyme, pepper, mushrooms, peas and carrots. If you do not have peas or carrots, broccoli would do nicely as a substitute. I did not use any sherry. (No need for extra salt with all the soup mix and cheese in this.)  I put cheddar cheese and parm cheese on the top, and then covered in homemade bread crumbs. I used egg noodles for the pasta part. 350 degrees for 20 minutes uncovered in the oven. I used a huge lasagna glass pan for this dish and we have another day of leftovers that will taste even better than the first. Everyone in my family had second helpings of this dish. It was a hit!

If it's not easy, I don't make it.  I LOVE this recipe! Easy and soooo yummy!   I might add some crushed Ritz crackers to the top next time to make a little crust; but really, this recipe is great, as is!

Hello first time I made anything like this!! My son is allergic to milk, but he now can eat it with lactase, and my late husband didn't like casseroles. I had left over turkey roast, so I decided to give it a shot! I used almond milk, I noticed the vanilla, but no one else said anything!! Needless to say, it was a HIT!! my 5, 6, 9, and 12 year old boys LOVED IT!! I didn't really do anything different except added a little garlic and onion powder, and added half a bag of frozen peas! The linguine pasta was the key, please you that!!

Amazing! I made mine gluten free using Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour and it was fabulous! Only other additions were some minced garlic, fresh spinach, and cheddar on top instead of bread crumbs like others suggested.

My Mom used to make Turkey Tetrazzini every year on the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  We loved it.  Have tried a few recipes over the years and this one is the best by far. I omitted the  peas but kept everything the else same.  Wow, did it come out great.

This recipe is wonderful!  I did add frozen peas, which actually shows in the picture, but isn't in the list of ingredients!  I also added water chestnuts!  It truly needed some spices though... salt, pepper, garlic... !  It was soooooooo good!!!!

God Bless,

I used real butter, heavy whipping cream and extra parmesan cheese, this gave it a richer flavor! It was great!

Needs a liitle extra flavor to taste (especially pepper) but my youngest, who will eat what she doesn't love but certainly would not get seconds, got thirds!  AND ate it as leftovers with neither complaint nor looks of near death...  It's definitely going in the regular rotation of recipes.

A great dish to use for leftover turkey.  A few changes - I had made bone broth with the turkey bones so I used that instead of chicken broth. This made it much more rich. Also I added some garlic salt about 1.5 cups of mixed veggies to it. I didn't use foil and did 375 for about 50mins. Added a little more fresh parmesan cheese to the top and brown a bit longer before serving. It was delicious! It was even better the next day!!

I thought the spaghetti pasta was the wrong type of pasta for this dish. I will try a flat noodle next time. I also thought the ration between milk and broth & the cheese resulted in a very thin sauce. I followed the recipe to the letter and was left wanting. Probably wasted a lot of turkey as we didn't save the leftovers.

I am not an experienced cook. But this recipe was excellent. I used a few hints from reviews - added sautéd celery & mushrooms plus peas as I assembled everything. And added 4TBSP sour cream. I also added bread crumbs to top with the cheese. I could not believe I had actually made something so great.

Loved it. It was the 1st time I made it. I forgot to add some frozen peas. They look good in the photo. Did add small can mushrooms and 1/2 a chopped red bell pepper. I also ran about 1 cup short on broth so It was not wet at all. But it was still a great meal (twice) and I will use more broth and some peas next time. Thanks ANNOFBEV.

The dish turned out very well.  Because there are only 2 in my family, I cut the recipe in half.  I also add 1/2 cup of frozen peas and 1/2 cup of slivered almonds.

I made this recipe with a few additions.  I sautéed a about a cup and a half of sliced mushrooms along with finely chopped shallots then added one cup of white wine and cooked it dry.  Then I added the flour and cooked it then proceeded with the recipe.  At the end I added a bag of frozen peas, combined it with the pasta and baked as directed.  It was very good and should be served right away.  I would make it again.  It does not do well leftover.  The pasta absorbs the sauce and is not nearly as good as freshly made.

This recipe was good as written, however, it was very bland.  The second time I made it I modified it somewhat by sauteing 1 cup each chopped onions and celery, and 8 oz. fresh mushrooms and 3 chopped cloves of garlic in the 1/2 cup butter.  Sauted veggies until soft then added 1/2 cup white wine and cooked until most of the wine has evaporated.  Added 1 tsp. each salt, parsley and rosemary, and 1/2 tsp. each white pepper and thyme.  Cooked for 1 minute, then added the flour and cooked until it smelled like pie crust (1-2 minutes).  Slowly added the cold milk and then the chicken broth.  Cooked until thickened.  Stirred in 1 cup parmesan and removed from heat.  Added the turkey, spaghetti and 1 cup peas.  This makes a very large amount so I split it into two 8x8 buttered dishes.  I baked one for dinner and froze the second one to use later.  I topped each with some Italian bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  Bake at 375 for 30 minutes, or until browned and bubbling.  My husband said this second try was "wonderful".

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and realized while it was baking that I did not add any seasonings.  My husband and I liked it okay since I served it with a really good garlic toast.  I liked making it and will make it again but next time add at least salt, pepper and garlic.  I did love how creamy the sauce was and the parmesan was great.

Didn't have Parmesan to shred  - used grated Romano/Pecorino mixed with some finely grated Parmesan.  Also used only 12 oz of spaghetti (that's all I had in the house.) Added a few pepperoncini flakes and a dash of coarsely ground  black pepper.  Turned out quite well.

This was good. I added frozen peas like the picture. and a little white pepper. Used poached chicken instead of turkey. Will definitely be making this dish again.

I thought it was bland. I don't like a lot of seasoning in food, but I thought this needed more flavor. Don't think I will make it again.

I tried to make it per recipe but used a packet of onion because it was what we had on hand. Layered the noodles and a package of mixed frozen veggies. Used most of the sauce and sprinkled with the cheese. Baked it in a large casserole dish for the allotted time and everyone loved it. Even my husband who isn't a fan of veggies!

I added a cup of thawed frozen peas and used turkey broth instead of chicken.  This was a great change of pace for turkey leftovers. I would make it again, and the only thing I might do differently is add a bit more cheese, or perhaps add some shredded cheese instead of the grated. It just needed a bit more cheesy flavor.

I added chopped celery and used turkey stock instead of chicken.
This was a very good, tasty recipe, a nice foundation for something amazing. Will tweek it with mushrooms, maybe carrots and/or peas.

Yum! The whole family loved this one. I have to say that this is based on the changes I made. First, no cheese whatsoever as we have a dairy allergy in the house. Second, when mixing together the pasta, broth mixture and chicken/turkey, I also added in some canned green beans, canned diced carrots, frozen peas, mixed-up pepper, minced garlic and onion powder. Third and last of all, I felt it should have a little crunchiness on top (since the Parmesan was omitted) so I combined unseasoned stuffing (dry bread cubes) and 1/4 cup of melted butter in the food processor, ground it up a bit and distributed it over the top. I halved the recipe, put it in a 9x13 baking dish and baked for 30 minutes. DELISH!

After reading other reviews, i decided to "tweak" the recipe.  I sauteed mushrooms, onions and garlic in olive oil.  I also added 1/2 cup of  white wine and only used 1 1/2 cups milk.  I also added peas.  Used thyme, basil, pepper and adobo.  Reduced the baking time to 40 min.  My family didn't complain about it, but despite all the tweaking I did, when asked, my hubby said it was still bland.

Turkey Tetrazzini is not a dish that anyone is supposed to gush all over!  Served the week after Thanksgiving and in school cafeterias all school year long,  this is one you usually see and yawn.  Please, make this as written and just taste it!  It's tasty and creamy and easy to make.  Hope it works with chicken, so I can have it all the time!

I used the stock recipe and everybody liked this (including two pre-teen kids) but if I make it again, I'll undercook the spaghetti so it doesn't get too soft while baking and add a cup of frozen peas.  And maybe a little less parmesan cheese.  And maybe some mushrooms.

Only four stars because I made several changes as this recipe seemed to bland.  Added onions and peas, and used a can of cream of mushroom soup and a cup of sour cream in place of the milk and flour.  Also added a cup of mozzarella cheese.  Turned out great and wife loved it too.  Next time will try adding some bacon too.

This recipe is not good as-is. It needs veggies and seasonings. I prefer sauteed onion, garlic and mushrooms as well as a bag of frozen peas added to the roux. Then I add salt, pepper and a little cayenne and nutmeg. I also prefer a panko/butter/parmesan topping instead of just the parmesan. Also, I skipped the milk. The sauce didn't need it.

I made the basic recipe according to direction; however, I  sauteed onion and garlic in the butter, then added bacon and 8 ozs of peas to the mix. It needed another cup of liquid because it came out a little to dry for my grandkids, but the flavor was exceptional!

I had chicken and turkey from Thanksgiving to use up so I found this recipe that didn't make use of canned cream of whatever. The only item I added was a few shakes of poultry seasoning and a clove of chopped fresh garlic to the sautéed butter onions. I added some shredded Colby cheese,and cheddar on top with canned parmesan,( that's all I had on hand). Baked for 45 minutes and it was bubbling,creamy delicious. My husband said we will be having our leftovers used this way from now on.

I'm sorry to say....but this dish (as written) was pretty  tasteless!  Previously, there was no mention of adding in any fresh herbs, in order to make this dish even more tasty.   My recipe came out great!   Take heed , as this dish needs a lot more flavor!

Will make again, with amendments.
Always try a new recipe in half, so as not to waste food if it's a toss.  Also read the least positive reviews first, to get an idea of what others have written.  In this case, they were mostly consistent with no flavor, and a blah taste.  So, here's what I did:
In evoo, sauteed onions, garlic, celery, jarred roasted red peppers.  Added half a bag of frozen peas & carrots, plus salt and pepper.  The photo shows peas but recipe does not.  I wanted the delicious taste of sauteed veggies plus color, otherwise this is an all-white, bland-looking dish.
Also had on hand fresh rosemary and basil from the holiday, so added that as well.   Used more broth and less turkey also.
It ft perfectly in an 8x8 Pyrex glass pan, cooked in a convection oven at 325 for 50 mins.  Hubby enjoyed and will definitely do again, but will substitute cavatappi pasta for easier serving.  
With these amendments, it's worth another try.  Otherwise, not.
Enjoy and good luck!

Will definitely make this again. Easy! The only small thing I did different was add a little bread crumb before putting it in the oven. Really good recipe! Will try with chicken next time just for something different.

This will be made again.  Very good, but bland.  Needs onions, garlic (a lot) and perhaps asparagus instead of peas.  Hot pepper flakes would enhance flavor.  Dark meat turkey was fine.

Have made this recipe many times.  What I like is that you can vary the meat (turkey, chicken, or ham), the cheese (cheddar, Swiss, parmesan, asiago, Romano), or the pasta (spaghetti, linguini,  bow ties, etc) and have different dish.  I always add frozen peas or green beans and make a topping using bread or cracker crumbs  that have ben mixed with melted butter and some of the grated cheese.  Just add a salad -- fruit or green -- and you have a wonderful meal.

Nothing special but not bad tasting. Like others have said, it's a good "base" recipe. Definitely needs some kicking up a notch. I'd throw in some veggies depending on what you like...mushrooms, peas, etc. The one thing I would change for sure is the spaghetti. It has no place here. You should use fetuccini or linguini pasta.

I didn't have turkey so I used chicken breasts that I cooked. Next, I added two cloves of garlic and onion to the butter. Then I also added mushrooms and peas to the white sauce. Equal parts seasoned breadcrumbs and Romano cheese on top with one T butter. Tasty!

I've made this recipe time and time again. My family just loves it! I like it because it helps me get rid of our leftover turkey. (There's only so many sandwiches you can eat! lol) The only thing different that I do is add a bag of frozen peas & carrots to it. It just looks better with a little pop of color.

Solid recipe with popular changes -- Sauteed 1/3 cup diced red bell pepper and small dice onion and 1.5 cups of sliced mushrooms. I strongly suggest reducing the amount of cheese to the taste instead. Finally dropped in 2 Tbs of sherry toward the sauce.

The only change I made was using fettuccini and adding frozen peas & carrots for some color. I also followed the advice in one review that said to place a thin layer of Italian breadcrumbs on top. What an amazing pan I pulled out of the oven. Not too hard to make but so easy to eat! My husband went crazy over it, will definitely make again!

This recipe as written is a little bland but is easily punched up to make a delicious casserole. I sautéed chopped onion and celery with 2 cloves of garlic until tender.  Then I added a small can of drained sliced mushrooms. I added a T. of Worchestershire sauce to the sauce then topped the casserole with seasoned bread crumbs before baking. It is a very tasty use for leftover chicken or turkey. My family loves it.

I love this recipe; it is easy, quick and a great way to use up leftover turkey!  I love the cream sauce.  I use half & half rather than straight milk to make it a little more creamy.  I have some picky eaters in my house and they loved this dish.  They even ate it as a leftover, thats how I know they really like it, LOL!

I've been looking for a great turkey tetrazzini recipe and this is it!   I never follow a recipe exactly, so changed up a few things, and my family loved it and told me to make it again.  =)    We have a large family so I doubled it.   My changes are below:

I sauteed two onions and about 8 cloves of chopped garlic in the butter ,   before adding the flour for the roux.   Didn't have any chicken broth, but I did use 9c water and 9 chicken boullion for the stock.  Did not use olive oil as I stick with one oil/fat when preparing a dish  Instead of regular milk I finished up the whipping cream and half and half left in the fridge, simmered for awhile and chopped rosemary and thyme in the sauce.   Had no parmesan cheese so the middle layer was shredded cheddar, which worked really well.  The only change I'll make in the future is saute fresh mushrooms in the beginning, maybe add frozen peas and carrots to the sauce before layering.    We also may like it saucier, so a couple more cups of broth/boullion possibly - but it was terrific all the same.  Wonderful recipe!!

Added celery, onions, and peas and used homemade turkey broth.  I think the next time I might try adding a little soy sauce to give it a little zing.

We love "Turkey Tet".  We are only 2 so I recalculated to make this for 4.  This was always a hit on my company's dining room menu, and remembering that there was always chopped green pepper in it, I added some ( I understand you can use rinsed pimento instead), chopped onion, chopped celery and 1 small can mushroom stems and pieces and topped it with buttered Panko breadcrumbs.  Fabuloso!

Followed others suggestion to saute onion and garlic first, then I added flour.  Cut recipe in half, used 1/3 cup parmesan.  Added 1/2 cup peas. Sprinkled on Italian Bread crumbs and a bit of mozzarella.  Good way to use up turkey.

I fused Rebecca Jo's Review suggestions. I suggest only 1 stick of butter, and 4 TBL of olive oil, instead of the 1/2 cup of butter. I will reduce the milk by 1/4 cup next time to offset the sherry (great add Rebessa!)

This was okay to use up leftover turkey, not sure I'd make it for any other reason.  It was easy enough and fairly quick, my husband ate it and shrugged his shoulders at me, my teen daughter picked at the smidgeon she took and then made a bowl of soup, and I ate it because I'd already cooked it.

I did make a few additions. Sautéed some onion, celery and mushrooms in the butter. Used a parm/romano cheese blend. Very good

Awesome with a few changes. This was too boring so I doctored it a bit. This will fit a 9x13 pan FYI. I sautéed 2 stalks of celery and a big pack of fresh mushrooms in EVOO till tender and added a cup or so of frozen peas. I set those aside and made the recipe as directed but added kosher salt to taste(it really needed a bit of salt). I also used 2 cups of Italian 5 cheese blend on the top(found in the "bags of cheese" section of your local market). I mixed Italian bread crumbs in a few tablespoons of melted butter and browned them in a frypan and sprinkled them on the top for some crunch. Tetrazzini needs a crunchy top!! Viola. A Firehouse favorite is born. You can also use chicken or tuna to change it up a bit.

This was yummy. Everyone in my family loved it. I added mushrooms and broccoli and a little bread crumbs on top. I cooked in an 9x13 baking dish and was worried it was going to bubble over, but it didn't. It made a ton, 4 of us didn't make a dent in it.

Works great with rotisserie chicken! We like to use angel hair pasta and add 8 oz sliced mushrooms,  a cup of frozen green peas, garlic, and onion to the mix.

I did follow some recommendations, and sautéed celery, onion, and garlic to add to the sauce. I did not have any chicken broth, so substituted 2 cans of Campbell's chicken and rice soup. It turned out just fine!

I made this dish today and it was great.  I did add some extra ingredients.  Frozen peas 1/2 cup, 1 cup of frozen spinach soften and drained and fried mushrooms. I small package. cleaned and sliced and fried ahead of time.  This added color and vegetables to the dish.  If I make it again I would thin out the sauce more and then if it needed thickening I'd add more flour.  But it had a very good taste and serviced about 8 large servings. I also used white and dark meat.

It was really good, I've never made turkey tetrazzini before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I added a little salt and pepper and a tiny bit of garlic powder because I thought it was a bit bland, I feel those additions were very important.  I also felt it could have been "saucier" but my husband said it was better than his mothers, so I guess that's a good thing.

Have made this dish several times and my family enjoys it.  I've used ground turkey but tonight will use leftover turkey and turkey broth.  I can't begin to see why it would take one hour to bake.  Everything is already hot.  I put a crumb topping on it and just do it until the crumb topping is golden brown.  I have also added celery and/or mushrooms(if I have it).  I don't put in near as much parmesan as it calls for but just 'eyeball' it.  As written, it is a bit blah but needs seasoning to taste.

I've tried this recipe as is, and I also tried it a few times with shrimp and fettuccine.  I'm actually making it again tonight.  cut the shrimp into bite size pieces.  It's a favorite in our household.

Perfect. Just like mom used to make growing up. Nearly identical in fact. These days I like to smoke a turkey and I use about 5 cups instead of 4. But I've tried it before with the exact directions and it came out just as amazing as I could have hoped for. This is a great recipe to try your own variations with.

This was the bomb.com!!!!  This dish did not last long, in fact is disappeared within an hour.  I basically stuck with the original recipe, but I did make a couple of changes, ONLY because I had some of the ingredients leftover from Thanksgiving cooking and I didn't want them to go to waste.  (1)  I used:  1 cup of half-n-half , 1 cup of milk and for more flavor, I used have 2 cup of chicken broth (I had leftover, (whatever was left in the box)). (2) I added 2 can of cream of chicken. (3) I took the advice of others, and sautéed 1 cup of onions, 2 cloves of garlic, and 1 cup of celery.  Oh, and since I am gluten free, I used gluten free spaghetti, instead of the regular spaghetti noodles (no one could tell the difference). It came out perfert, with all of the liquids that were used, it DIDN'T come out too liquidly or soggy.   My family and neighbor wanted me to make another pan, but I was all out of leftover Thanksgiving Turkey.  LOL!!!  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

This was exceptionally easy and consumed quite a bit of leftover turkey. I had tons of leftover gravy and I used 3-4 cups of that as my base (basically the same thing as the stock and flour-butter rue). I used heavy cream instead of milk and penne instead of spaghetti (had them on hand). It came together quickly, smelled heavenly as it baked and I didn't feel like I was eating turkey and gravy (AGAIN). I added frozen peas (in the photo but not in the recipe) which was a nice add. Served with a simple salad of arugula and parmesan cheese with Trader Joe's Romano dressing.

This Recipe is great! I changed veggie/wheat pasta, half the butter, sautéd turkey breast in coconut oil, skim milk, half the cheese and 30 minutes baking (at altitude). I added garlic powder, salt and pepper right before baking.

I put this in a 9x12 pan and it only needed 1/2 hr of baking. Added green peas.  This worked well when halved for our family of four. NEXT: Used ground turkey instead. Added peas, sautéed mushrooms and onions.

I cooked up some red pepper, onion and mushrooms.  Flavour was great but i found it a bit dry.  Next time i would add more chicken broth and only cook one half hou.

Perfect for leftover turkey...Love it!!  I think I enjoy this more than the big turkey dinner itself.  :)  Thank you for sharing!

A family favorite that even my picky husband liked! Added frozen peas, thawed and cooked, just before baking. Also added a few ingredients based on other reviews: sour cream, garlic, salt, and pepper. Yum!

This recipe was such a hit! I followed the recipe exactly, but then added sautéed onions, mushrooms, bell peppers and garlic, and also some black pepper (about 1/2 tsp) and cayenne (about 1/4 tsp) for a little kick. I pride myself in my cooking, but this was so good, I could hardly believe that I cooked it! I'll be reserving this excellent recipe for extra-special occasions. Thank you for a delicious crowd-pleasing recipe!

The new app makes reviews a breeze. This is my first one and totally worthy because I ate the whole dish in two days, I'm also 5'3 and 110 pounds so that says something! I halved the recipe and put garlic and onion powder in the roux mixture along with a little thyme. I mixed a third cup of Parmesan into the roux, and then I put some additional Parmesan and breadcrumbs on the top of the mixed casserole. When ready to bake, I covered it with foil and baked 20 mins. Took off the foil and baked for an additional 15 minutes, and then turned on the boiler for 2-3 minutes until the top was golden brown. Delicious and no leftovers for my   DH who just came home from business trip!

This was great! I made a 10 lb turkey for Easter dinner, because my fiancé and I don't like ham. Needless to say, there was a lot of leftover turkey meat! I halved this recipe, and got 6 moderate sized servings. I added a chopped onion, 1 stalk chopped celery, 1 tsp poultry seasoning, pepper (no salt since parmesan cheese and chicken broth make it salty enough) and 1/2 cup green peas. Sprinkled with some panko bread crumbs. 40 minutes in 350 degree oven, then let sit for 15 minutes. It was amazing! Next time, I may add a couple cloves minced garlic and reduce the butter and flour to 3 tbsp each. Halving the recipe was a good idea, although I think this would freeze well so it may be worth it to make the whole amount.

This recipe definitely needs a little help. I cut the recipe in half since I was making it for only 2 people, but based on other reviews I added 3 large cloves of garlic and about 1/3 of a white onion and sauteed both before adding to the sauce at the beginning.  I also subbed some low-fat cream cheese for half the milk. Additionally, I added in peas and broccoli.  It was still lack-luster. I think it could use a little cayenne pepper and maybe some bacon!

Let me preface this by saying my husband hates baked pasta and LOVED this dish. Okay, now onto what I did. 

I read through the reviews and added the onion, celery, carrot and garlic, and some dried Italian seasoning along with the peas that were recommended. Then, as I was making the roux and had just added the chicken broth, I found out we were out of milk. So in my haste I added a can of Golden Mushroom soup, stirred it up and prayed for the best. Also, I didn't have that much Parmesan on hand, so I added what I had along with some mozzarella, and stuck it in the oven. 

DELISH!! My toddler scarfed it, my husband had seconds, and it was awesome! Pure comfort food. Definitely making this one again! Thanks!

Great base for a recipe but needed a lot of tweaking. Read a lot of reviews and added salt, pepper, sauteed garlic, peas, and mozzarella cheese since we don't care for a strong flavor of Parmesan. made the whole recipe and then divided it in two. Still have more tweaking to do when we bake the second half. Adding bread crumbs or crackers is a MUST. Both my husband and I agreed that is what really makes this recipe pop/

Loved this! I halved it and added 1 tsp of garlic powder.  Ran short of the parm so subbed some dubliner hard white cheddar. Added a few frozen peas too but it's not necessary.  Used bow tie pasta cause thats all I had. It came out like a mild garlicky mac and cheese. Finished it on the stove top instead of the oven because I was in a rush to get it on the table.  Perfect post tday dinner!

All in all, this wasn't bad. I followed the recipe for 4 servings. I added a little minced garlic to the butter for flavor. After reading the reviews, I was concerned with it being too dry. I added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. I also added a 1/2 can of peas. While mixing everything, it still seemed too dry. I added a little bit more milk. I also topped it with some Italian bread crumbs. I baked it at 350 for about 45 minutes in a 13x9 glass dish lightly sprayed with Pam. The flavor is decent, but it still came out a little too dry for my taste. Maybe I cooked too much pasta? Not sure. I will definitely make this again though. Just gotta play with it to get the right consistency, but it's a good start.

Loved the recipe and the use of my leftover turkey.  Added garlic powder, pepper, salt, oregano and parsley to taste.  Did as someone said, added plain bread crumbs, then parmessan cheese.  Only baked for 40mins at 350.  Loved it.

This was yummy! The whole family loved it. Great for leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I added 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas which gave it just what it needed. I made the original 8 serving recipe and thought it would be way too much for the 4 of us but it was so good that everybody had seconds!

Recommend  adding 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.  Also sliced fresh mushrooms makes it very tasty.  With a toss salad and garlic bread…. a super easy supper.

This was a great way to use up some leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  Hubby loved it.  I following others' recommendations and sauteed some garlic & onion first and added frozen peas with the milk. I only had it in the oven for 30 mins and it was fine, not runny. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a little more flavour, it was still a little bland, needed some spices/herbs

After reading that some cooks thought this was a little bland - I used buttermilk instead of regular milk - adds the zing that is missing for some!  Also - when you put the pasta and turkey in the baking dish - add extras - like peas, pimentos (for a little color!), and mushrooms.  If you used canned mushrooms - remember to add the liquid to the buttermilk mixture before cooking!  Also - I use Wondra instead of plain flour  and mini fuslli instead of spaghetti.

This was amazing. I followed suggestions; halved the portions, added sauted onion/celery/mushrooms, topped with bread crumbs, and reduced time to 40 minutes.  The other mod was using homemade turkey stock.

Thanks for this.  It's a keeper!

2.Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Drain, and place in the prepared baking dish.
3.Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour. Mix in chicken broth and milk. Cook and stir until the mixture comes to a boil. Stir in about 1 1/3 cups Parmesan cheese, and remove from heat.

Pretty good casserole.  I sauteed some garlic with the butter for a little more flavor, and added some salt, pepper and frozen peas to the roux.  Everyone liked this and I could see myself making it and freezing for nights when I'm too beat to cook. Mixed the remaining cheese with some fresh bread crumbs for a topping.

Great, basic recipe. I added homemade croutons (cut bread into cubes, melted butter and mixed) to the top after baking for 30 mins. I then added the xtra parmesan called for on top of the croutons and baked another 30 mins. Otherwise, I followed directions exactly and it was good. Think I'll make with Rotisserie chicken next time.

I think that this is an excellent base recipe but the cook does need to add a bit of creativity and imagination. I added sautéed onion, red pepper, mushrooms and frozen peas, and I topped with crushed cracker crumbs. This filled the largest casserole dish that I had, and the finished product was a huge hit!  Excellent!!

Yum!  I've wanted to make Turkey Tetrazzini for awhile now; I had leftover spaghetti and turkey from Thanksgiving this year so I decided this would be my first "leftover makeover."  My hubby & son both enjoyed it and it was simple enough to prepare. I appreciate that it doesn't call for any canned "cream of" soups but rather has you make your own cream sauce (sans chemicals).  It is a little bland as-is; next time I make it I'll add some onion, garlic, herbs, and black pepper to give it a bit more flavor.  But even so, it made for a very nice dinner.

Yummy!  I added the celery with the onion and garlic like other reviewers said, and also added a bit of shredded mozzarella when I added the parmesan into the sauce.  I topped with leftover stuffing rather than breadcrumbs, and only baked for 30 minutes.  Delicious - but it makes a lot!  I'll have to freeze at least half the casserole.

This is an easy and excellent recipe that fed my family of four for two days and they loved it! We used a little more parmesan cheese than the remaining 1/3 cup for the top. It turned out really scrumptious and was so simple.

I like this recipe because the bechamel sauce is from scratch, not from a can, so it just tastes cleaner. I've never made tetrazzini before and my boyfriend and I loved it. I didn't have enough parmesan so for the balance of the cheese I just used cheddar, which was delicious. 

I thought salting the pasta water and the cheese would provide enough salt but, next time I think I'll just add a teaspoon of it.

Terrific!  I cooked a bone-in turkey breast in a slow cooker and was looking for a leftovers solution.  This was quick, easy and delicious!  I even added some vegetable puree from my baby's homemade food for extra nutrition.  My husband and I both loved this recipe.

Solid basic recipe. I cut it in half and made the following mods ... delicious!

Eliminate butter. Cook 4 slices of bacon in skillet until crisp, set aside. Saute 1/2 of a chopped yellow onion and a chopped carrot in bacon fat until soft, remove with slotted spoon. Proceed making Roux,  then sauce, simmering until slightly thick. Turn off heat and stir in 1/2 cup each frozen peas and frozen corn. Chop bacon and combine with all other ingredients, including onion and carrot. Finish as originally directed by topping with remaining cheese and baking until brown, 35-40 mins.

Make this recipe your own.  It's a great base recipe, which you can tailor to your own preferences.  
I don't like it when a reviewer gives it five-stars with X number of changes, but in this case, everyone can make it differently and it will still be good, because it's a solid base recipe.  
(For the record, I added peas and mushrooms and had company last minute and thus added a can of chicken, etc.)

My family really liked it and it was easy.  A bit of a flour taste, will cook the flour and butter a bit longer next time before adding the chicken broth and milk.  I halved the recipe for my family of 4 and made in an 8x8 pan, cooked for 35 mins.  Wondering if I could just make two 8x8 pans next time and freeze one?  Really good!

This recipe was a hit with me, my hubby and our 15-month old son! The only changes I recommend is to add 1/2 cup to 1 cup each of the following:
-chopped celery
-diced onion
-chopped mushrooms 
You could also do canned mushrooms. I found these to add a nice taste and texture to an overall delicious recipe (and a tasty way to sneak veggies in!)

I also bought deli turkey and chunked it up myself, super easy!

The recipe as written is a good basic comfort food meal. That being said it REALLY improves when suggestions of previous raters are implemented. I made it as written the first time and second time around made additions. Much, much tastier the second time. Great way to use up leftover turkey.

Very great recipe. The sauce wasn't overly impressive at first, but after cooking with the noodles and turkey, it was amazing! I added onion and Italian bread crumbs and will add mushroom and some other type of veggie the next time I make this. I believe this may even taste great with canned chicken. This is a keeper.

I added seasonings to the sauce, but I love to use a lot of seasoning, so to each his/her own. I think baking this for so long made it a bit too dry, was like eating noodle paste instead of something creamy. Would rec decreasing baking time/temperature.

Well, I'm not a left over Turkey lover, however, my 3 Children and husband LOVED it, It's a feast quantity, but when it's reusing something you're not going to eat, I was a delicious very cheap way of reusing the Turkey and well they all had 3rds.  We're allergic to cows milk, so I used Soy milk and goat cheese, and a sprinkle of pepper.  OK, I enjoyed it too...

This was a good way to use up my turkey leftovers.  I sauteed some onion and garlic in the saucepan before melting the butter.  I also added some seasoning and some white wine.  When I mixed the sauce and the pasta I threw in a cup of frozen peas.  Overall it was a little plain, but still tasty.

I made this recipe with chicken and added some buttered breadcrumb topping -- not much -- and it browned up nice & golden..  My husband and grandson loved it.  Everyone had seconds.   Very good dinner.

Of all the Turkey Tetrazzini recipes on this site, this one is THE BEST.  Have made it many times and it never disappoints.  Most of the additions by other cooks sound fine but it works perfectly as written. I always add the peas.  Thanks for the pictures.

I added celery, onion, and peas as others suggested and still found this very blah, it definetly needs more seasoning and mine was also surprisingly dry I think that using less noodles may help and adding sour cream before cooking.  I also reduced the cooking time to 35 minutes.

great EASY recipe.  EASY being the word. All of the other additions take an easy quick recipe and make it longer  and more work which I don't think was the intent of the recipe!!

This was an ok way to use leftover Turkey. I added peas because there was no veggie and they worked well. I must have done something wrong because when I added the parm to the sauce it didn't melt through just got all clumpy, so I had giant clumps of parm instead of it nicely melted throughout. Despite that the dish was still pretty good. I thought the 5 cups of liquid would be too much but it was perfect.

Very Good. I did alter the recipe a bit, added sauted mushrooms & peas. I did make the roux, but added some cottage cheese to the liquid mixture. You don't see the cottage cheese, but it does add a nice rich favor. Oh yeah, I spiced it up just a touch with crushed reds. Yummy!!!

I replaced 2 c milk with 1 c half-and-half and added 1/2 c velveeta (what I had on hand). Big hit with my husband and picky 2-yr-old. I love that this recipe doesn't use a canned soup so I know exactly what's in it. Will make many times! Thanks!

very bland, even with inclusion of garlic and onion to the sauce.  Turned out quite dry after only 40 minutes.  Would double the sauce in the future.

This was delicious-plain and simple!  I used leftover turkey, and added peas for a little crunch and color.  The sauce was beautifully creamy.  It was done well before an hour though, and you wouldn't want to overbake it.  Wonderful recipe!

This was delicious. The only changes I made were to half the butter, use chicken stock instead of broth, and add veggies (asparagus, fresh mushrooms, peas, and carrots). I cooked 1.5 lbs of boneless skinless turkey breasts in a aluminum foil "tent" with spices and a bit of butter and chicken stock for 30 minutes at 350F. Fabulous flavor and creamy consistency!

This dish was divine!  I used another subscribers suggestions and added onion, garlic, celery, mushrooms and sherry.  The only other thing I changed was I used homemade turkey stock instead of chicken broth and added a little more salt to compensate for the lack of salt in the the stock. I will definitely make this again.

This came out pretty good with a few tweaks. I used medium whole wheat shells, which held the sauce nicely. First, I used half chicken broth and half white wine for the liquid portion. I added a can of mushrooms, a can of peas, and about a cup of frozen corn niblets. I used about 1.5 cups of shredded swiss, about .5 cup cheddar and a sprinkle of pecorino romano. To cope with all the extras (and all that cheese!) I added another .5 cup chicken stock. I baked it a little longer so the liquid would thicken up more. But all in all, a good base recipe, and great on a cold day!

This is a fabulous base tetrazzini recipe, thank you!  Like others, I added some peas & grated carrots for colour & flavour.  Along with a healthy "dash" of nutmeg which made the dish come alive!

This was pretty good.  I sauteed an onion and added salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I also added a light dusting of bread crumbs on top.  It looked like chicken spaghetti but, with all that Parmesan, it tasted much better.

Great recipe! I added some bread crumbs and italian cheese on top, and I only baked it for about 30 minutes instead of an hour (enough to brown it a bit). I can see myself adding broccoli or some other veggies next time.

Halved the recipe.  Still made a meal for 4 easily.  Added saluted onions, garlic & mushrooms and a few fresh green chilis.  Was still on the bland side.  Will add red pepper flakes and more seasonings next time.

My wife enjoyed this very much. I liked it but not as much as she did. With my limited kitchen skills, I followed the recipe exactly--except I halved it. Next time I will try adding some veggies to give it more texture and additional taste.

This was a hit with my entire family.  The reason I am giving it only 4 stars is because it was a little bit bland tasting...but it was still excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding almost 1/3 cup more flour.  Will definitely make again!

I made this and it turned out teriffic. I loved it. I did add in some other spices, since we like our food spicy. I also reduced the amount of butter in it.

So good!  I love that this version does NOT use a can of cream soup!  Much healthier.  I will use this again with leftover turkey or chicken.

I used Swiss cheese instead of Parmesan (we ran out of the Parmesan), used rigatoni instead of spaghetti and it was wonderful. I think the only thing I added was some salt.

I added sauteed leeks, mushrooms and zucchini, and grated carrots to the dish before baking it to add color and nutrients. Also a dash of italian seasoning. Switched parmesean with cheddar. Loved by the baby, too.

A flavorful dish when there is enough parmesan cheese added.  I reduced the recipe to serve 2 and didn't bake it. Served the sauce spooned over the spaghetti instead.

blandest dish I ever made, even with adding cooking sherry, black olives, half and half, and parmesean bread crumbs. This dish needs something, I don't know what, but it has NO kick whatsoever. Visually appealing dish, though.

A great dish that will make you want to eat those Thanksgiving leftovers! If you use homemade stock instead of the broth, make sure to salt this puppy! I forgot and it was a bit bland, but that was my fault and the salt/pepper shaker fixed that right up!

I liked it a lot but my husband and son weren't impressed.  Next time I'll add some cream of mushroom soup and a little garlic.  It reminded me of a nice alredo sauce with turkey.

This one is a keeper!  Easy to make and tasty.  I did saute some onion in the butter first.  I also added some chopped up celery before baking which added some crunch that my family loved.  A bit too much spaghetti, I would have preferred more sauce.  I used fresh grated parmesan and it was delish!  I am going to make some more sauce for the leftovers because it is a little dry today.  I added some breadcrumbs and butter on top for topping.  Still have leftover turkey and I am going to chop up and freeze so I can make this dish again.  Thanks for sharing!

Simple ingredients and recipe.    Be prepared to use several bowls.     I think a little less spaghetti would be better would help it "fit" into the casserole bowl.    I used another reviewer's idea and put a moist mixture of italian breadcrumbs and olive oil crumbled over the top.    Yum!!!

I added pees, mashrooms, onion and garlc. I used teenfoil for the first 30 min. The dish turned out good but the trick is it is the best left over dish I ever had. For some reason it tasted better next day and the next day.

Wow, just not that good. It wasn't bad, it was just missing some spice, some flavor. I did add onion and garlic as others suggested and some peas to bake, but it was just ok.

I added frozen peas and frozen asparagus, the latter cut into one inch pieces (because I did not have mushrooms, a tetrazzine staple).  It was a great, colorful addition.

Pretty good there was too much parmesan for our taste so I cut back on that and added mozzeralla cheese to the sauce to make up for it. Will make again though.

What a great way to use leftover turkey. I did cut the recipe in half and made a few additions. I added sauteed onions and minced garlic and added a little Italian seasoning. I topped it with bread crumbs. I only baked for 40 min. and it turned out really good and not too dry. Will be making this again.

Very good.  Followed a few of the other recommendations, but can't remember which ones...sorry.  Not so helpful.  :)  But a good, solid dish.

Not so sure what the rave reviews were about. I didn't think it was that great. It had an ok flavor, I added mushrooms, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. It was still missing something. I might make again with a few more tweaks. My 11 month-old loved it!

I followed the advice of others and added onions and garlic to the early mixture and then breadcrumbs to the top before baking. Delicious. Will definitely make again.

Some of the spaghetti on the bottom was burnt, but other than that I guess it was an alright way to use leftover turkey.

3 stars for taste but 5 for the recipe. I only cooked it for 30 min. and added some bread crumbs and table spices to the cheese on top, plus some frozen peas for veggies and color.  But, my family did not enjoy it. I threw out a lot from my kids plates and the rest of the pan is sitting in the fridge two days later.  I don't think I will make this again, it just did not meet my family's tastes but the recipe came out perfect. Sorry!

This was great for using up left over turkey.  I went with some previous suggestions, such as using minced onion and garlic in a little olive oil before making the sauce.  Easy and my family enjoyed it.  Will make again next time I have leftover turkey.  Thanks.

I just made this recipe and was not impressed. I read several other reviews about it being bland so I added garlic to the butter and sauteed. I also added cajun seasoning, which usually takes any recipe to the next level, as well as bacon. After all the tweaking this was still bland! I'm not sure I'll try this one again.

My picky husband loved it!! I added crushed cornflakes to the parmesan on top and drizzled some melted butter before baking.  Very cheesy - great comfort food!

This was the best tetrazzini I've made.  I halved the recipe because in the past, I have not had luck making it.  It was great and the kids loved it.  It was creamy and everything blended perfectly - Thanks for sharing!

I found this to be a very good recipe. We all liked it very much.  Mine only had to bake for 45 minutes in a 13 x 9 pan.I will definately make it again.  Thanks!
