What I like about this recipe is that it is super fast and easy. I did add some dried minced onion and some garlic powder. I did not pre-cook the potatoes. Instead I covered them and cooked them about 55 minutes.

These were rich and delicious.  I only had one can of cream of chicken so I used a can of cream to replace since I had nothing else.  I usually shy away from changing anything the first time I try a recipe, but I really wanted these and it was Christmas, I didnt want to run out! I was going to slice them at first but decided to follow the recipe and cube them, so good...this will be a staple for holiday dinners to come!

I scaled down the recipe to feed just two.  I had 1/2 of a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup to use to I basically quartered the recipe.  I also used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I added a healthy bit of dried minced onion.  The end result was very good and I would make this again.  I made the mistake of starting the boiling of the potatoes too late for dinner so they didn't get quite done and I had to cut them up while still hot but that was my fault.  I also did not put cheese on top of the potatoes, just dumped all of it in the mix.  I think they would benefit from some bread crumbs, preferably Panko, on top but again that is personal preference.  Thanks!

It was easy to put together and smelled delicious!  I sliced my potatoes instead of curbing them.  However, the taste was not remarkable.  It was flat.  Missing something, I'm not sure what but I'm definitely going to try them again and play with the ingredients.  Super simple recipe!

I really liked how easy this recipe was.  While I liked the potatoes very much, the family not so much.  Added minced onion and garlic, still a little on the bland side. Needed an additional 30 minutes of cooking time. Will make again for a crowd.

My kids gobbled this up. I sliced the potatoes before boiling them and added sausage & peas. There was nothing leftover. I don't think I'll ever buy scalloped potatoes in a box again. This was so simple & so good.

I used 6 lbs of potatoes and 2 bags of bacon bits.  I also mashed them instead of cubing them.  Great flavor, even without the bacon.

This is an easy recipe that the family liked, however the potatoes weren't soft enough even after boiling first and then baking for 45 minutes. I will make this again, just allowing a bit more time to boil the potatoes longer.

This almost exactly the same recipe I've made for years.  The only difference is I use more cheese and a bunch of sliced green onions.

Totally a new go-to side for the non weight watchers! Delicious and not difficult. I sliced the potatoes instead of cubing for a more scalloped approach and finished the top with panko and French’s onion for extra crunch.

Hunks vs. slices: it’s all about the ratio of potato to sauce in each bite. This recipe is easy and delicious, but I might use slices next time.

This was a last minute dish,  it tasted totally 
Different than my regular potatoes.  I added black pepper  and a little less sour cream.

Pretty good!  I used my spiralizer to cut the potatoes and as others suggested, I didn't boil them first just baked in the over however it did take 1.5 hours doing it this way.  Added some Parmesan cheese and a little garlic salt.  Will definitely make this again.

I cut up the potatoes before boiling which made it quicker and easier. Must add green onions and then it's perfect.

Easy and delicious. Add sliced onions and minced garlic for extra flavor. Recipe is good as is though!
