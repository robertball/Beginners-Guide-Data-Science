I just happened to have alot of fresh green beans that I wanted to cook when I came upon this tasty recipe.  I broke up the brittle while it was still warm, which made it easier to seperate but as it cooled its was harder to brake up, next time I'll just chop it into smaller pieces and save my hands. love it!

I LOVED the flavor combination of the beans and the salty sweet almonds, but I seemed to have too much area that was brittle but no nuts and that was too hard to eat with the beans.  Want to figure out a way to get that same flavor and the crunch of the nuts without the hardness of the brittle

Wow, I've been missing out all these years--roasting green beans is definitely the way to go! After reading the reviews, I decided to omit the brittle, but I still wanted the flavor, so after the beans were roasted, I tossed them with agave, then added the nuts (which I toasted in a dry skillet while the beans were roasting). I'm sure pure maple syrup would work as well. I used both almonds and pecans. The overall salty-sweet nutty flavor was just excellent!

Delicious! This was the first time that I roasted green beans... usually, I boil them... but from now on, I will always roast them. The almond brittle is a nice addition to the beans. My only problem is that I had a hard time trying to break it with my fingers. I guess I could have put it in a towel and smash it with a hammer, but I didn't want to ruin my countertops.

This is a yummy recipe that is great for special occasions, or just something to go with a simple meat dish.  The almond brittle is easily made ahead of time, so the dish goes together quickly. The only problem I had was that it was hard to eat the brittle with the beans - it rolls off your fork.  This is a small complaint as the overall taste is very good.

Made as a side to our Christmas Prime Rib, simply delicious, the almond brittle was easy to make and added a sweet/salty crunch.

Good.  I was a bit surprised bf didn't complain about the almond brittle in with the beans, but he ate it all up. My sugar and water mixture never turned a golden color, but it did boil and turn to candy, so I guess that works well enough.  Roasting the green beans is easy enough and  I like how it turned out. Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious! Next time the brittle should be crushed up more for my taste so I would chop the nuts finer. It was hard to get a piece of brittle and a green bean at the same time.

Great, easy variation for green beans!  I only used 1/4 cup water to make the brittle.  I love roasted green beans, but have also used this brittle with cooked frozen petite whole green beans.

it made everything too mushy and the recipe called for too much salt.
