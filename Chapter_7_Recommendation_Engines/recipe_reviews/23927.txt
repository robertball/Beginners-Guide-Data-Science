Thanks for posting this. I think it is very much like the recipe on the Chex cereal boxes but I could not find the one I cut off the box and I was making it with Crispix cereal and it is not on that box. I always put in 2 cups of Honey Combs. Everyone loves the little bit of sweet mixed in. I usually double the spices and use a whole stick of margarine. I've also added Honey Nut Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. My son told me to leave the Cinnamon cereal out from now on and he is the one who eats most of it. We all prefer it to the store brought brand.

This is a great snack and it freezes well too if you want to make a big batch.  I din't change a thing except omit the bagel chips and used only cashews.  My only question...isn't this the same recipe that is can be found on the chex cereal boxes during the holiday season? I checked my boxes and although the "recipe" for Chex Mix wasn't listed on the boxes I had purchased, I'm pretty sure it tastes the same as their recipe...therefore, I didn't find it all that "unique."  Still, I personally like this over the store-bought/pre-mixed Chex Mix but I think the two recipes are one and the same.

Fabulous for on-hand munchies.  I put Tony Cachiere's instead of seasoning salt to give it a little kick.  YUM!

This is almost identical to the traditional chex mix from the Chex cereal box. The only difference is the additional amount of garlic powder. If you like traditional chex mix with a touch more garlic, you'll enjoy this. We enjoyed it.

Its good.  but we like a stronger flavor in our snack mix.  Going to try doubling the seasoning ingredients and see if that suits our tastes more.  It is yummy, the flavors used work well!  Just not as potent as we personally like.

I doubt anyone out there makes this the same way. I always add Cheerios to mine, usually double the seasoning and add a little bit more butter, and leave out the nuts and sometimes the pretzels. I did try it this time with Honey Combs, fantastic! What a great idea! I melt the butter and mix the seasonings and pour over the cereal mix, it incorporates better.

This is a good recipe and a clear cost savings over buying the pre-packaged stuff.  It's easy to make.  I have made this twice, so far.  The first time I used the 9 x 13 baking dish, as the recipe advises, and had to divide the mix into two pans to be able to do it.  Didn't work very well.  This time I used an oven-proof Dutch Oven pan.  Each time I stirred the mix every 15 minutes and added 15 minutes to the baking time when using the Dutch Oven because of the depth of the pan.  
My family would like a bit more flavor/seasoning so will experiment with that.  But this is a very good base from which to adjust to suit your individual tastes.

I have absolutely become addicted to this!  I do double the seasonings since we like a little stronger flavor.  I also have added 1 teaspoon dried mustard and a dash of paprika.  I make a big batch to take on road trips, but it's usually gone before we reach our destination!  Thanks for posting Tawny.

A few years ago I started substituting the 'corn on one side, rice on the other' cereal.  A box contains over 9 cups, so you get the same great snack w/o having 3 partial boxes of cereal to deal with!
