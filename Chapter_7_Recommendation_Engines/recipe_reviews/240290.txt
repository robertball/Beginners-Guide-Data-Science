I can't believe it!  This is my Dad's scalloped potatoes recipe.  He died when I was 11, (I'm 58 now) but one of my fondest memories as a little girl was sitting at our kitchen table together and him teaching me how to make this recipe.  No measurements were used, just peeling and slicing the potatoes and onions and layering in the casserole dish with sprinkled-on flour, small pats of butter, salt and pepper (on each layer), then pouring milk on top just until it peeked through the potatoes at the top.  Sometimes he put pork chops on top before baking.  Best scalloped potato recipe ever!  (Miss you Dad).

I make a roux (using the butter and flour), add it to the warmed milk, and season the cream sauce with the salt and pepper.  I layer the potatoes and onions to the nearly the top, slowly add the cream sauce till just even with the top row, and bake for an hour.  Same ingredients, but a with a consistent cream sauce and great taste every time.

I make scalloped potatoes almost like this every time....however I chop the onions and add some Parmesan - layer like this....potatoes, onions, S&P, sm. chunks of butter, 1.5 Tbsp. flour, 1 Tbsp. Parmesan, then again - finish with Parmesan which will brown up nicely - & milk just to the edge of the top layer. I don't bother heating it up either. Pop in the oven (on a baking sheet to catch drips)and bake at 350F for probably 1.5 to 2 hrs.(poke a fork in to test doneness). Let sit a bit to let liquid absorb into potatoes! Im' 72 & my mom, grandmother always made them this way. You can also add bacon bits for a nice light flavor and to change it up a tad. My hubby hates Parmesan......& so far has never realized it's in there!!

I used to sprinkle the four on each layer but now I put couple spoons of butter or margarine in a pot and add about 3 tablespoons of flour and melt together,then pour a little milk at a time to the thickness you desire remembering that it will get thicker as it cooks. I also put some cheese of choice in with the sauce and then layer the potatoes with onions and salt and add the sauce. It comes out the same each time.

The key words in the recipe above is "as needed"--and a bit less always worked for my grandmother, my mother, myself and probably my kids who are also great cooks.   A roux works for me too, with a portion of it on each layer, and a bit of extra milk over all.  The milk provides the browned skin over all the potato slices. Today, we rarely peel potatoes, and they are most often "organic" so sliced,well-scrubbed, unpeeled but "edited" from zits and eyes, works.    To get to au gratin, just cover the dish for the last 20-25 mins. of cooking with your favourite grated cheese mixture.   Hey, works for us!

janebp, this is my idea of scalloped potatoes.  Other recipes call for so much cheese they become au gratin. This to me is a true scallop potato recipe.  Very good!

This is my mom's recipe too..she used to cover the dish with foil to speed up the cooking a little then take the foil off to allow browning.

Almost identical to my mother's recipe except she used corn starch instead of flour. I've never had better scalloped potatoes and even though I use the same recipe they never turn out quite the same as hers. Reading the review below about the father-daughter making the potatoes at the kitchen table brought tears to my eyes because I completely understand. We all have special recipes that "belong" to our parents and will forever be associated with them.

I grew up eating scalloped potatoes this way and I've tried lots and lots of other recipes for scalloped potatoes and always come back to this.  They bring back such good memories.  If I have ham I put ham in also for a complete meal and just add a vegetable.  This is the way scalloped potatoes are meant to be!

Awesome taste. Different types of potatoes will cook differently and not  absorb all the milk. I use russet potatoes and 1/4 cup less milk. I have learned never to use a metal pan either as it doesn't seem to bake properly.

I have used a similar recipe from the 1979 Betty Crocker Cookbook that I received as a Wedding gift 36 years ago. It called for 2 lbs potatoes, thinly sliced, 1 medium onion, chopped, 3 tbs flour, 3 tbsp melted butter, and 2 1/2 cups scalded milk, salt & pepper. Make 3 layers of everything in a 2 1/2 qt casserole dish. After scalding the milk (which I now do in the microwave)pour it over all & cook for 1/2 hour covered & 1 hour covered. About 8 years ago, I forgot to add the onions. I decided to try just mixing it all together without the layer & it worked perfectly. I no longer bother to layer it all. My family loves black pepper, so I use a lot of it and no salt. Noone ever noticed the change of mixing it all together :-)!

I cooked for 70 minutes, and it still had quite a bit of milk that needed to cook down.  Since the potatoes already were cooked, and I didn't want it getting too brown, I just spooned off some of the liquid.  One thing I'll do in the future is add more salt, since I didn't sprinkle enough on each layer.  Sliced the potatoes and onions in the food processor, so not having to make a sauce (saved myself a dirty pan) made this pretty simple and quick to pull together.

This is like my Mom's and Grandma's scalloped potatoes, too.  With one exception, when they used milk they made a roux to thicken the sauce and only about 2 cups milk.  For holidays and special dinners they just used butter and cream for a sauce.  My version on this has a twist: 2 lbs baking potatoes and 1 lb. sweet potatoes, thinly sliced, 1 large onion thinly sliced, 1 1/2 to 2 cups heavy cream or half and half, 6 to 8 Tblsp. softened butter, salt and pepper, 1 tsp. herbs de provence or dried thyme. Layer 1/2 white potatoes, dab with butter, lightly season with S & P, and pinch of herbs. Then in layers 1/2 onion, sweet potatoes, 1/2 onion, 1/2 white potatoes.  Between each layer dab with butter, sprinkle S & P lightly, and add pinch of herbs. Dot top with last of butter. Then gently pour cream over casserole so it covers about 3/4 up the side of potatoes.  Bake 40 minutes at 400. Both Grandma and Mom like me to make the holiday potatoes, now.

Nice flavor, but a little too much liquid.  I ran the onions and potatoes through the food processor so they would be the same thickness.  The processes of making this dish is very easy and the taste was very good.  But, I did have an issue with too much liquid.  Next time I will add some flour to the milk, before heating, to make a light roux.  This paired nicely with a baked ham using 'Ham Glaze' from AR.

This is the very recipe my mom taught me and is my favorite scalloped potatoes except I do not use as much milk; I have been making it since at least the 1970's.

This was exactly the way Mama made her scalloped potatoes... So now it's exactly the way I make mine... But like you said: no measurements. Just start  slicing, sprinkling and dotting until you have as much as you want.  I just guess at the amount of milk to heat and if it's not quite enough to cover, I just add more cold. So easy and so good! Thanks for sharing!

This was exceptional!  My mother used to make scalloped potatoes, but I never cared much for them.  My mother-in-law always used boxed potatoes.  Too salty!  I've used another recipe for years.  I decided to try this because it was faster to prepare:  I didn't have to par-boil the potatoes or make a white sauce.  I usually have to ask my husband if he liked something.  Halfway through dinner he asked me, "Is this your usual recipe?"  I told him it wasn't.  Then he said, "These are really good!"  Wow.  I'll definitely be making them again!  The only change I made was to use condensed milk diluted with an equal amount of water since I don't have whole milk in the house.

Thank you so much for a plain, traditional recipe!  I have tried over and over to get the proportions right to make these just like my father-in-law but never got it quite right.  And other recipes I have found online use canned soups or white sauces.....not what I remember frog ears gone by.  This one is simple and straightforward and turned out great.  Heating the milk does make a big difference.

Wonderful recipe! After making 5 or so times, I have made the following adjustments. As suggested by a previous reviewer, I make a roux with the butter and flour in a saucepan before adding the milk to make the sauce to pour over potatoes just before putting in the oven. Because I like a lot of sauce, I use the amounts of flour, butter, and milk given for 8 servings while keeping the amount of potatoes the same. I also salt each layer of potatoes with Lawry's garlic salt. In my experience, you should allow at least 2 hours for baking- they are almost never done by the time stated.

It's like I make, only after each layer I sprinkle some Paprika over it and that gives it a wonderful flavor.

My Mom made her scalloped potatoes the exact same way. Sometimes she just poured the milk over the top, but I remember her also making a roux.  She sometimes added leftover ham in between the layers.  Brought back childhood memories.  Thanks for the recipe!

I live alone so I cut this recipe in half.  Recipes here can be adjusted for different servings, a handy feature.  I made this half recipe exactly as written. Although I must admit, I added a 4 cheese lasagne mix that you can now find at the stores. I sprinkled a medium amount over the top during the last 25 minutes of cooking. Janebp's Mom's scalloped potatoes are among the best I have tasted! I baked them in a 1 and 1 half Qt baking dish @ 375 degrees uncovered for 60 minutes. Potatoes were tender, great flavor and the cheese browned perfectly!  
Thank you Jane for sharing the recipe.

This is basically my recipe that was how my mom made these... give or take a few adjustments in measuring . However, we never added onions but DID add cut up ham in the layers. Having ham for Easter and will make this as a meal in the week following!

I made this today exactly like it's written. Baked it in my deep cast iron frying pan. It is delicious! It will always be my "go to" for scalloped potatoes.

These are the ingredients my mom uses for scalloped potatoes and how I make them (except no heating of milk and using lower fat milk). We also do not measure ingredients. Just add what looks right. They are delicious on their own or served with ham or with diced ham included in the potatoes.

This is the same recipe my Grandma and Mom made and now I make too.  We also cook up 2 packages of porkie breakfast links and add them to the mix. Or we use leftover ham like from Christmas or Easter.

This is delicious without adding anything to it. I did add small chunks of ham and a thin layer of shredded cheese to each layer of potatoes. It was bubbly with cheesy goodness. Served with broccoli. It was a hit!

Recipe was good, but somewhat plain, but I guess that's what scalloped potatoes are? I think it needed a little more flavor somehow. I think I'll try au gratin next time

This is a very good recipe. I didn't have whole milk, and I used half and half and cream. I cut the butter to 3 tablespoons. I liked the idea of mixing the flour with the milk rather than sprinkling it on. It's best to mix the milk with the flour a little at a time, otherwise, the flour will clump. I used a mix of russet and Yukon gold potatoes. I let mine sit for about 10 minutes before serving.

This is the way my mother-in-law made her potatoes and the way I have been making them for my husband for 36 years.  The only difference in I chop the onions finely - for my husband.  I would love to have them sliced.

Totally YUM! I halved the recipe for two people but kept the 1/2 onion broken into rings. I thought a 1/4 would not be enough. I made it exactly as written, finely slicing the potatoes and using hot milk to pour over until just level with the top layer before baking.  I baked it a little longer than the recipe stated, until the top was nicely browned with crispy bits on the edges.  I thought  sprinkling flour over each layer might have created lumps, but not at all. The sauce was very creamy and enough so the potatoes were not dry. Beautiful.

I changed it by making a roux (using the butter and flour), add it to the warmed milk, and season the cream sauce with the salt and pepper. I also sautéed the onions first. Then I layered the potatoes and onions making 3 layers and poured the sauce over top. Same ingredients, but a with a cream sauce and great taste every time. I have also made this by adding 1 1/2 cup of grated cheddar cheese to the sauce. Yummy.

I made half of a recipe.  Added more milk to get to the level of the potatoes.  I baked it at 325 degrees for 70 minutes,  because I had meat cooking at that temperature.

This is great. Scalloped potatoes do not have cheese! I followed the recipe exactly except I did make a rue with the butter and flour and added the milk to the rue (Old habits die hard). This is everything I hoped it would be. Can't wait for the next pot luck!

My Mom made this all her life in a Brown Betty casserole dish. In addition, she always put 3-4 bone-in pork chops on top, in a single layer, adding enough milk to almost but not cover the meat. That way the chops browned on topside and something about sitting in the milk made them tender. She had many requests for her "scallopers".

Made it with the layers of potatoes and onions. Sprinkled each layer with salt and pepper. Then I made a roux with flour and butter added about a cup of half n half and a cup of milk until the sauce was starting to get a little thick then poured over the potatoes and topped with Parmesan cheese. Baked at 375 for about 50 minutes, until it was browned on top. It was DELICIOUS!

I made this for the family, and they loved it!  Just be aware that this dish requires every bit of the time listed.  I had some potatoes that needed to be used, and I sliced them on the mandoline.  Followed the recipe, but I just eyeballed the onion, also sliced on the mandoline.  Very good flavor, not runny, everyone thought there was some cheese in the recipe, but no, I didn't tweak.

Made per recipe and it turned out perfectly.  You can adjust the amount of onions to your own liking.  If you use a mandolin to slice potatoes this will go quickly and potatoes will be uniformly cooked.  We put it under the broiler the last few minutes for a nice brown topping.  I actually had been making this without a recipe for many years!

THANK YOU!  I'm not sure why people don't seem to know the difference between scalloped potatoes and au gratin potatoes, anymore.  When I went to search for a recipe similar to my mother's, that I grew up with and that I've forgotten myself (as I haven't made it in so long)... It took me forever to find a recipe that didn't include cheese! I couldn't believe that people don't seem to realize that cheese is not in scalloped potatoes! THIS IS  the recipe that I was looking for. It's amazing how some of the most simple recipes are the most delicious.  Anyone looking to make a ham? This is the recipe for potatoes that needs to go along with it!  Yes, au gratin potatoes are awesome with ham, as well and I don't mean to snub scalloped potatoes cheesy cousin.... But for this meal I was definitely looking for scalloped potatoes. Thanks, 
again... My family is Long gone which leaves me with great appreciation for any bit in life that brings me back home, again.  If you are someone that has not made potatoes in this way before, it may seem odd, but don't be fooled by other recipes...  When making a nice, no lumps and bumps, creamy sauce, it seems counter-intuitive just layering the potatoes with flour, milk and butter Believe it or not this is the best way to make these potatoes. Somehow, it's like magic. Many recipes will call for monkeying around, making a roux and it's just absolutely unnecessary. I truly like this version up scalloped potatoes much better and it has nothing to do w

DELICIOUS!!! I am in my 50s, and I have never made these kind of potatoes.  I was a little nervous as it was for dinner guests, but even though I was winging it as a newbie, they turned out to be absolutely fabulous.  You can teach an old dog new tricks.  I will be saving it for special occasions as it was quite a bit of work for an old dog with the main course and dessert and all.  We don't usually eat such heavy foods these days, so I will be sure to make it to impress the young folks with better metabolisms:) Yummo!

I brought this scalloped potato dish to our family Thanksgiving dinner tonight!  But I stepped it up a bit. Some may say it’s not very healthy but I think once or twice a year we deserved to taste something so simple made luscious. I substituted the milk with 33% cream, yes, whipping cream and added 1cup of half and half to increase the liquid. I covered the casserole with foil for the first hour of baking then removed the foil for the last 45 minute, to brown the top. Total baking time was 1 hour 45 minutes at 375. Wow! They were creamy and delicious !

This is a great SCALLOP POTATO RECIPE... If you want cheese--- its another recipe entirely-- with a different title.   Tennis shoes are not sandals!!!!   True scallop potatoes do not have all the grease and calories of the cheese!!!

For the purest scalloped potato lover this is the recipe. It makes me nervous to see the liquid bubbling while baking but then the thickening takes place and all is well. I used roasted garlic seasoned  in the layering process. Perfect for Easter!

This is very similar to the recipe I've used for years, minus the onion. In recent years however, my own recipe hasn't been as good as usual. I'm convinced that whole milk made the difference as another reviewer suggested. I also added shredded cheddar cheese to each layer because my family prefers that. Everyone said they were the best scalloped potatoes ever. I did bake them about an hour and ten minutes. Also sliced the potatoes fairly thin using a mandolin. A big thumbs up!

These potatoes were EVERYTHING! I had to stop myself from going back into the pan for  a third serving.  I served the potatoes with slow baked country style bar-b-q ribs.  I read many of the reviews before preparing it and I really liked the idea of making a rue to be added to the potatoes and onion so I did just that. To make the rue I used about 4 tablespoons of flour and about the same amount of butter. I  slowly added 2 cups of 2% milk once the flour and butter cooked a bit.   I also browned the onions in butter before adding the potatoes.  I layered and then forgot to season with salt and pepper so I end up mixing it. I covered it with foil and cooked it @350 for about an hour. After the hour I took the foil off and let it cook 15 more minutes for browning.  I also let it sit for about 10 minutes before serving.  It was so creamy and hot.

I wanted to try a different scalloped potato recipe and I followed this one as written, but my potatoes turned out with a strong flour and milky taste.  My mother's recipe makes the sauce on the stove using the flour, butter, salt and pepper, and then pouring it over the top, and I should have stuck with hers.

I  don't like scalloped potatoes. It's milk and potatoes, might as well just mash them. Anyway, I tried this. I didn't use onion  because my oldest doesn't like them. I used 1.5 Tbsp of onion powder, and 1.5 Tbsp of garlic powder. 
They.
Were.
Amazing.
I'm doing this again.

This is the closest recipe I could find to the scalloped potatoes my Mother used to make.  It was my favorite comfort food as a child.  However, my mother made a roux and then a white sauce to pour between the layers of potatoes and then on top, which is what I did too.  I think it must give it a creamier and more consistent texture than adding the flour, butter, and milk separately.  Also,  I think it's easier.  The only other change I made: my mother and I diced the onions and added it to the white sauce.  My son is not a fan of onions (nor was I as a kid). This way, we get the flavoring of the onions, without any objections about having to eat onion.

Wonderful recipe. Be sure to add enough salt to each layer. The first time I made this, I was concerned about oversalting it, and it came out pretty bland. The potatoes will absorb the salt like crazy, and the milk will dilute it, so salt and pepper freely.

I sautéed the onions in olive oil and butter, then added a lemon pepper seasoning to it while the onions where cooking. For the potatoes I stuck them in the microwave and cooked them for 10 minutes, then ran them through the food processor. Mixed mushroom soup, milk , lemon pepper, grated cheddar cheese and sour cream together. Mixed it in with the potatoes and baked it at 350 for about 30 minutes or so. It was yummy!!!!!

Perfect.  Just like my mom used to make.  Only had 2% milk.  Still came out rich and creamy.  Done in 60 minutes.  Not bland!  I was very liberal with the salt and pepper.  Sprinkled paprika and yeast flakes on top.  Easy, fast, delicious and makes a beautiful presentation.  Add any spices or herbs that you like to switch it up.

Wow! Fantastically easy! Used a mandoline to slice, easy peasy. I followed another's suggestion and made a white sauce with the flour, butter and milk and added the salt and pepper to the sauce. I didn't put it back on the stove to thicken, but poured it over the potato/onion layer, making sure to cover all the top potatoes with a bit of sauce. I measured all the ingredients as per the recipe and even weighed my potatoes, lol. I accidently left the pan in the oven for an hour and a half and it still came out great!

This was very good scalloped potatoes. I totally agree adding cheese makes it Augratin...a very different recipe. I don't use very much salt usually. But, Potatoes always seem to need more salt than I usually use. Also, I think 1/2 onion is way too little. I used 2 large onions which adds a lot of flavor.

Made this today for Easter dinner.  Like another recent review, I agree that 3 lbs. of potatoes thinly cut was way too much for a 9x13 pan.  It took A LOT more than 3 cups of milk to fill up the pan, and even though I was very liberal with the salt and pepper, the dish still lacked flavor.  It also baked for about 90 minutes and still the potatoes were barely tender.  It sounded good, but I'll try another recipe next time.

For whatever reason, 3 lbs of thinly sliced (food processor)potatoes didn't even come close to fitting in my 9x13 pan. And the 3 cups of milk I heated covered about half of the potatoes. I had to split the pan and ended up using approximately 9 cups of milk between the two. I would also suggest being very very liberal with the seasonings in the layers. I also had to cook it quite a bit longer than the 45 to 60 minutes. The sauce thickened up nicely though after sitting for a few minutes.

As others have said this is how my mom and grandma always made their scalloped potatoes except they never warmed the milk. I do the same except I add the cheese for au gratin since my kids are cheese-o-holics. It's wonderful either way. I may try warming the milk before pouring it over to see if there's a difference. Thanks!

This is exactly how my Mom made scalloped potatoes and she learned it in the 1930s from her Mom.  She sometimes used cheese as additional layers. Delicious.

These potatoes are great. Followed the recipe, but made the sauce  and then poured over the potatoes and onions. Second helpings all around the table. My eight year old grandson says it's a WINNER!

Wasn’t sure at first because the recipe and directions were so simple, figured they would be bland or watery... they were amazing. I gave them a good stir and let them rest about ten minutes before serving and they were perfection! This is my new go-to potato side dish.

Really great! Made it vegan by using plain unsweetened soy milk and earth balance butter. I used the roux method instead of layering the flour and butter, but I kept the measurements the same. This will be a regular in our rotation.

Protect the bottom of the oven, it bubbles over but it is super simple and delicious !!
The butter step is easier if you melt it and pour it. 
Next time I'm going to add a layer of grated cheese in there! and maybe on the top too!

This is just like my grandma used to make. The one tip I’d give to people is cut the onion paper thin and they melt away leaving an amazing flavor.

This is the way my Mom made it when I was little, but she switched to the white sauce method later in life. I prefer this way even if it looks a little funny. I don't add the milk quite to the top as I make a big 2 quart dish and it would boil over. One really good addition is onion salt. It makes a world of difference in the flavor.

I made it with sharp cheddar and no salt seasoning like Mrs. Dash. The next day, we added lump crabmeat and more cheese to it. It was HEAVEN!!

Basically the same as my Mom's (whose recipe I had misplaced).  I added the following like my Mom always did:  between each layer of potatoes et al, add a layer of sliced ham and then sprinkle that layer with some dried mustard.   It's a great way to use up those leftover spiral hams or other big hams.

This was good, but I had a couple of problems.  The amount of milk (3 cups) was nowhere near enough to cover the potatoes.  I think I had to use close to 5 cups.  I may have used a little more than 3 pounds of potatoes, though, so when I make it again, I will make sure I don't quite fill the pan.  Since I used so much milk, the amount of flour wasn't enough to thicken the sauce.  So after about 45 minutes, I sifted about 4-6 Tablespoons of flour on top of it and made sure milk was spooned over the top of the flour and put it back in the oven for about 35-40 more minutes.  Thankfully, that did the trick and it was done just in time for a funeral potluck.   Next time I will add some more seasonings, too...possible some garlic powder and a bit more salt and pepper than I used.  I tend to not add much salt to recipes, but this one needed a bit more.  All in all, a good recipe which I will make again. Thanks.

I made a roux sauce with milk, flour and butter as others have done.   I would add a pinch more salt.   I added water to the flour to get a smooth liquid before I added to milk and butter.

I used a mandoline to slice my potatoes and onions, thin slices and layers with flour and butter and a little cheddar cheese and seasonings, milk, into the oven....yum. 

I forgot to heat the milk...  I will next time.

I had to adjust the length of time I roasted this in the oven because of altitude.  I cooked at 375° for an hour,  then bumped temp to 425° for 1/2 hour.  

Easy recipe and my family loved it.

Very tasty....however, next time I need a bigger dish.  I added diced cooked ham & the pan boiled over.  No biggie...needed to clean the oven anyway!  Would definitely make this again, but for just two of us, I might cut the recipe in half.

My family and I didn't like this dish and I love potatoes! I omitted the onions because my son doesn't like them, so I added onion powder instead. I also added a sprinkle of bread crumbs and crushed croutons. on top just before baking. When they were done, I tried them and thought them on the sweet side. So, I sprinkled parm and black pepper on top. Still, not enough to be floored. If I try these again, I will omit the onion powder.

I've made this twice. The first time it was more runny than one of my children prefer, so as another cook suggested, I used only 2 cups of milk. I didn't adjust the flour, but next time I will. However, in my opinion, it was delicious either way.

Make a roux (using the butter and flour), add it to the warmed milk and season the cream sauce with the salt and pepper.  Layer the potatoes and onions to the nearly the top, slowly add the cream sauce till just even with the top, and bake for an hour.

DELICIOUS!  This was my first time to make scalloped potatoes from scratch.  I followed the recipe as written.  I used 6 medium-size russet potatoes, thinly sliced with the peelings on.  It was easy to make and a big hit with my family and guests.  I served it as an accompaniment for roast beef and steamed carrots.

I cut the recipe in half for me and my husband, which is the perfect amount for us to have it for two meals. I also used almond milk as I am allergic to dairy and it's still very good. I love this recipe, it's so easy and delicious.

This is the recipe my mom always made when I was growing up.  Unfortunately I was out of onions, so I used a spice mix with onion in it.  I also cut the recipe down because only my daughter and I would be eating it.  I baked this in the toaster oven and it came out great.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I cook my onions in the butter before I add flour. I used half and half instead of milk for a little richer flavor. I sprinkle a little grated Italian cheese blend on the potatoes. But mostly the recipe is solid. I make a cup of white sauce for every 2 potatoes used or 1 large one. Can't have too much sauce sometimes.

Very good & easy. I won’t need to follow a recipe after this time because it’s THAT simple! I did put it under the broiler for a couple  of minutes at the end just to get it nicely browned on top. Delish!
Paired it with burgers & steamed broccoli.

Accidentally, I forgot to add the flour to the last two layers, and it still turned out nice and creamy.  We had leftover ham from a few nights ago, and chopped it up and added it after it came out of the oven.  Tasted great!

Delicious!  I recommend that you make a roux with the butter and flour, then add your milk (I used 1 cup of half and half and 2 cups of skim milk) and heat it then pour it over the potatoes.  I also added a touch of nutmeg to the milk mixture.  Rave reviews!  Will definitely be my new recipe for scalloped potatoes.  Thank you!

I followed the advice of some comments and made a roux to pour over the potatoes in stages, rather than the individual components.  I also added shredded cheese on top for the last ten minutes or so.  This turned out great, and will be a regular side item for gatherings.

They were ok - I have made better ones.   They were a bit bland.   I added a little Parmesan cheese think maybe next time I will add some more onion and some more cheese.

I had lost my mother's recipe and was looking for one to make do in a pinch. Obviously, everyone is accustomed to their own parent's recipe but it seemed odd that the recipe calls for the ingredients to be layered like lasagna and the hot milk poured over it. It makes more sense to cook and thicken the sauce first and pour that onto the potatoes. I was willing to try it - maybe even save time. However, it just didn't look quite right when it came out of the oven. It was edible just not great. Also, the finished product was bland.

Very good recipe but I agree with others it comes out best if you make a roux with the butter and flour to make a cream sauce. A little sprinkle of parmesan between layers works wonders too! I found making the roux with 9 Tbs. of flour was WAY too thick, probably cut the flour in half next time as it was too dense.

These are easy and delicious scalloped potatoes! Didn’t change the ingredients but made a roux with the butter and flower then added the milk (I used skim), then poured over the potato/onion layers.  I’ve made it a few times, making a larger recipe to freeze some for another time.  Still delicious after freezing and reheating!

This was bland, and tasted like milk and flour. We had to season it more with salt and pepper and put shredded Cheddar cheese on top upon serving.

I used 6 tablespoons of flour which was still too much, so next time I will use less. I also used one cup of heavy whipping cream and 2 cups of milk which made it even more delicious. I used various seasonings in the layers, and a bit of cheese on top after taking it out of the oven. It was a great hit! Thank you for the recipe.

I made this recipe last Easter. The only thing I change was that I substituted heavy whipping cream in place of the milk. They were absolutely delicious. Creamy and rich

This is a good basic recipe, but it is extremely bland and high fat.  It need something additional.  Whatever that something is can be to your taste. I did make the white sauce first  as suggested and the texture was good.

I was not pleased with this recipe at all. The dish had to cook over 2 1/2 to be fork tender, and they came out super bland from the amount of salt the recipe called for. I would definitely add more salt and next time try par cooking the potatoes first to speed up the process.

Took a suggestion and made the roux. Came out great. Put salt, pepper and garlic salt on every layer. Making the roux was so easy and I didn’t have to play with the butter.   UCB faster. Needs a little more flavor kick so will add Parmesan with each layer next time

The exact way my mother used to make hers! I've been looking for this recipe, NOT the many that tell you to first make a white sauce. (what??? lol) For many, many years we relied on her making them for us. Now she is in her 90's & Alzheimer's has taken the recipe away. Thanks for giving it back to me!

Very nice basic recipe.  Turned out wonderful but didn’t cook in the hour.  I cranked up the oven to 450 and stirred it.  20 minutes later, perfect!  It’s a school night and I had to hurry it up after the hour cook time passed.  In the future, I think I’ll start at a higher temp and try with some bacon. :)

I had never made scalloped potatoes before and this recipe turned out great.  As another reviewer recommended,  I diced the onion added a good amount of parmesan cheese (appx. 2 tablespoons) to each layer.  Be careful to follow the layering instructions for it to bake evenly.   I also cooked the potatoes for approximately two hours to be sure the potatoes were cooked.   Comfort food at its finest!

I followed the recipe as it was written except I halved it. I wasn’t sure how it would taste. My husband loves scalloped potatoes. His mom made them when he was a child. I am glad I found this recipe because he said it was exactly like his mom’s. Thanks for a great recipe.

These potatoes are amazing! I made them for a side dish at Christmas. My daughter and I are vegan and my mother-in-law is gluten and dairy free so I made two versions; one as directed and the other with gluten free flour, vegan butter and almond milk. I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese/parmesan substitute on the top and it made a nice crispy crust. Both versions were a big hit!

I have never made scalloped potatoes "from scratch". This recipe is absolutely delicious! I needed a simple recipe to cook for a crowd. No changes to ingredients, except used red potatoes instead of gold. I did change the cooking technique. Sauteed the onions in the butter and added the flour, milk, salt and pepper to make a roux. Poured roux over potatoes, covered with aluminum foil and baked for an hour, then continued baking uncovered for 30 minutes. Recipe was doubled, so needed a bit more time than recipe stated. I will definitely make this many times over!

Tastes like Mom's. Definitely make a roux, add milk, then pour over potatoes. Runny potatoes are not as good.

I made this year's ago when I was younger,  I didn't like how it came out with some clumps,  reading some reviews I tried mixing together a roux and pouring it in,  I think I might like the clumps better lol.  I used a slicer to get the potatoes nice and thin which worked out super nice.

I used the over all recipe but added in my own touches.  I used more onion and butter.  I used thick bacon and placed the full strips under all of the ingredients in the pan.  I cut up bacon strips and added those to the individual layers.  I used mainly the ingredient info and temp settings from this recipe..  Prior to cooking-- i heated the milk and butter and poured to the dish just over the top.  I placed that overnight in the fridge and let it soak.  I cooked it the next day prior to the event.

The remarks came back as all excellent from the people dining.

I added a little garlic, and slivered onions as well as Cheddar, gruyere, and parmesan to each layer. They were so flavorful and cheesy!!!

First time making scalloped potatoes and they turned out great for Christmas dinner.  I read some of the reviews and used a heavy hand when salt and peppering the layers and added some garlic powder.  Will make again as all the family loved them.

So it was good but it was different from what I was expecting. The dish was rich and delicious but was pretty bland so required more salt and flavor. I did cook it with foil on it and then tried to let it crisp up afterwards but that didn't exactly work so maybe I just did it wrong.  If I make it again, I will make some changes.

I added additional seasoning to each layer:  granulated garlic, garlic salt and light dried onions.  I also added the flour to the warm milk to evenly distribute the flour because I wanted to avoid clumping.  However, I have not tried it the way the recipes recommends by sprinkling the flour.

I made a roux with 9T’s flour and a stick of butter, added the milk and cooked until slightly thick. Baked for an hour and they turned out perfectly. I used a deeper dish so they needed the full hour. These are just like my mom made, NO cheese.

I made this recipe tonight and it was delicious.  Very easy to make. I used lowfat milk and a bit more flour, still came out creamy.  Great comfort food or side dish.

This is my mom’s recipe, minus ham. My mom would layer spiral ham pieces between potato layers and call this dinner. I never knew most other scalloped potato recipes have cheese in them. This is true scalloped potatoes!

Like others I've seen I opted to use a roux instead of layering the flour and butter, added the milk and used it as part of the layering. Turned out great. Also added garlic powder, parmesan cheese, and shredded cheddar to each layer for extra flavor!

I made this according to the directions and measurements. I was highly disappointed. Scalloped potatoes are my favorite and this killed a fantastic dinner. All I could taste was flour. The potatoes not the onions were done. It was just horrible. I do not recommend using this recipe.

It took much more than 3 cups of milk; at least another cup or more. The 9 x 13 pan was full to the top, and the milk overflowed in the oven. It cooked through but had a lot of milk and not much flavor. It wasn’t bad, but I was disappointed.

It was incredibly filling! My family loved it. My only complaint would be it wasn't incredibly flavorful, and the potatoes weren't soft enough. (but that last bit was entirely my fault!).
I would most definitely make this dish again :)

These are really good! I layer the potatoes, onions salt and pepper and whisk the flour into the milk after I've warmed it in the microwave and pour that over. Makes it super simple and no flour lumps like others have noted. I think it could use some sort of seasoning but haven't played with that yet. Thanks for sharing!

The flavor was very nice, but I did not cook long enough.  Instead of allowing it to cook a few minutes longer, I think I rushed it.  I will try it again and cook longer.

Not sure what I did wrong, I followed the directions but the milk curdled leaving white clumps throughout the dish. The flavor is good but texture was terrible.

I found it a bit watery and bland. I recommend going for the shorter cook time, since the potatoes were too soft and mushy.

A bit flour-y and the cooking time is off. I think we were looking for more au gratin than scalloped.

I was rushing and put a whole onion in!!! It looks fine, but I shouldn’t have put more than 3 cups in because it overflowed and I had to clean my oven from the burnt smell!!! Lesson learned: don’t overestimate your cooking skills too much!!!

Thanks! Made this on Father’s Day for my boyfriend being that he was celebrating his first! I wanted to make it really special and this dish was amazing! I sprinkled some bacon on top with Parmesan cheese and it was soooo good! Will make it a household dish! Thank you!

Excellent recipe.  Followed directions to the tee with the exception of using lactose free milk.  The fact that the recipe does not call for cheese was an added plus for my lactose sensitive spouse!

I followed the recipe to a T - including the step that said to add enough milk to reach the top layer of potatoes.  To reach those, I had to add 6 cups of milk!  So definitely too runny, but I served them with tongs to keep the liquid to a minimum on people's plates, and my family loved them!  So I will absolutely will make them again and use less liquid, maybe even make a roux in order to have a more saucy sauce.  Great base recipe though, and I will tweak it as I use it more!

This is the closest recipe I could find to my Mom's. She is no longer here, so while I made this, the memories flooded back and it felt like we were cooking together! I did mix it up a bit by adding 5 strips of pre-cooked bacon, crumbled up. The flour was organic sprouted Khorasan by One Degree Organics, and I only used 4 tablespoons. I prefer more spice so I added epice marie. Next time I may add green onions. I also put 4 slices of colby cheese on top. Delicious!

These were soooo yummy!!! I melted the butter and added the flour and cooked that for a few first, added the milk and onion (which I grated). Added a little salt and pepper. Cooked until I got a creamy consistency and poured over the layered potatoes. I added a splash more milk and then popped in the oven. Will definitely make these again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Like others,  I made a roux first and poured it over each of the 3 layers of potatoes and onions. I used all purpose gluten free flour and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.    I did not add the extra milk to bring it to the top of the potatoes this time.  I did that previously and it ended up with too much liquid and I had to scoop to off.  It was the hit of our Easter dinner.   It is also good for left overs where I placed my meat in the potato mixture and baked together.

This was a big hit with my Easter spiral ham.  I stuck to the recipe except to add a cup of shredded Dubliner cheese.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe for Easter dinner with a traditional ham. I used Maui sweet onions and reduced the amount by half. I also used gold potatoes instead of russet and the texture was good. I used a covered casserole dish and took the lid off before the last 15 minutes. The dish thickened a little more after it was out of the oven. This is a classic recipe...always good!

Cannot believe I made that!  My boyfriend asked me to find a recipe for scalloped potatoes and try it. It was, well, WOW!  It was just for the two of us so I halved the recipe and used an 8X8 dish and Yukon Gold potatoes unpeeled. I heated the milk (I used half and half since that’s all we had) in the microwave before pouring it over the potatoes. I actually ended up using 2 cups instead of 1/2 of what the full recipe called for which would have been 1-1/2 cups. Baked it 60 minutes at 375. It was a little runny but, after sitting out about 3 minutes, the sauce thickened up beautifully. Unbelievable!  He said it tasted just like his beloved Aunt Skeets used to make when he was a kid.

I have to laugh *with* you since my Grandma never wrote down any of her recipes, either. "Butter? Oh, about the size of a walnut." This is essentially her recipe for scalloped potatoes as well. Thanks for a trip down memory lane - great recipe.

I like the suggestions to salt and pepper each layer as when I've made these in the past, they weren't very flavorful. I also layered sharp cheddar and chevril.  The prep and cooking times listed are inaccurate: these take 60- 90 minutes or more to prep - peeling potatoes, slicing them ( I use a mandoline), making the milk mixture (I made a roux with the butter, flour and milk) and layering, especially if you're making two pans for company.  Five pounds of potatoes is plenty for 2 -9x12 pans. My Betty Crocker recipe calls for cooking them covered with foil at 325-350 for 30 minutes, then uncovering and cooking for another 60 minutes - that seems to work. I'm cooking mine a day ahead for Easter and will take them out of the refrigerator an hour before reheating. Like so many dishes, these taste even better when reheated. An Easter favorite!

My mom made this regularly. The family loved it! She often would use leftover ham, cube it, and add it to the layers, making scalloped potatoes and ham.  One dish casserole to have with the family or take to a Pot Luck!  Delicious !

Exactly like my grandmothers recipe and she always made THE BEST!! Sometimes she would add some ham or bacon but besides that this is the recipe she taught me how to make when I was in high school and getting ready to move away. Thanks for sharing since I had not made them in soooo long and had forgotten some of the details. I did use half-n-half with some whole milk and of course real butter. The family loved it and they are all foodies!!!

I found this a little bland. I think next time I will add a little more salt and pepper and garlic.  The milk bubbled over all over the oven. So I would suggest you put it on a cookie sheet lined with foil.

I will make this again. Followed the recipe as written. Except, I substituted reconstituted onion flakes for real onion and Lactaid milk. They work perfectly and we don’t have any digestive issues.

Excellent - just like my mom's scalloped potatoes!  I do use only a tiny bit of onion (maybe 1/4 of a small one).     I'm always happy to find a scalloped potato recipe that doesn't include cheese in the ingredients.      While I love cheesy potatoes, there I times I do not want cheese in my potato dishes, especially scalloped potatoes.

I actually altered this recipe just a tad. Instead of all of that milk I used a can cheddar cheese condensed soup mix and some milk. I must say this was delicious.

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was so creamy and good. It was so popular, I'll be making it again very soon. Heating the milk was the key to a very creamy sauce forming as the potatoes baked.  Love knowing I have this recipe in my files!

This recipe came out great.  It was fairly easy and pretty yummy.  My only complaint is "salt and pepper to taste".  I would love to know how to salt and pepper something that can't be tasted until it is cooked.

This was exceptional.  I followed the recipe.....except....I used mostly half and half along with a little of my heavy whipping cream and whole milk.  Because I didn't want to use cheese (for some reason, I didn't want cheese and wanted to make the old fashioned real scalloped potatoes) I was worried it wouldn't be thick or creamy.  It was both.  I used a larger glass dish (10x13) and added enough mile/cream/half and half to just go to the top of the potatoes.  They were crispy on the top and very good.  I wish I had added more salt, but didn't want it to be too salty for my guests.  I made this with ham, green beans (cooked in bacon fat, sautéed onions, bacon bits and almonds. Along with Ambrosia salad.  It was very good.

This was a nice and easy recipe. Instead of meticulously layering, I just tossed it all together with my hands, poured the milk from the fridge right over it with salt and pepper,  and tossed it once more before popping it in the oven. What made it even easier was using my Cuisinart Pro Classic. I just tossed in whole potatoes and an onion,  and they came out perfectly sliced per the recipe.

Delicious!  For those of you concerned about lumps; simple mix your flour and seasonings together in a bowl and use a whisk to get out any lumps.  Take your sliced potatoes and add gradually to the dry ingredients, tossing to coat until all have been incorporated, then add your layers followed with wet ingredients and cheese if desired.  Turns out perfect.

Will definitely make this again! The whole family loved it.  The only thing I did different was added chopped garlic to the layers and accidentally made a different amount.  I was worried mine would be too runny since I had to add a bit more milk (apparently I didn't judge 3 lbs of potatoes well haha!) But nope they were perfect.

This was my first time making scalloped potatoes. And, truthfully, in my lifetime, I've only had scalloped potatoes about three times. But, this recipe looks so good and scalloped potatoes are a nice cold weather side dish that I just had to make this. The recipe was super easy to follow. I used my mandoline slicer and it fun to put it together. The final result was just okay. My family seemed to enjoy it more than me.

This is very tasty! I made this pretty much as directed. I added Parmesan cheese into the mix as others suggested. With the leftovers tomorrow, I’m going to add bacon bits and some chives. Delicious comfort food that I will add to my side dish rotation.

Excellent flavor and easy to make.  Time in oven a little confusing and what to look for when done.  Excellent flavor.

This is yummo.... just like Mom used to make and served with her meatloaf!  The only difference is, we make a roux with the butter and flour before adding the milk, and add chopped fresh parsley at the same time as the onions.  Thanks for posting a childhood favorite, Jane!

I added left over ham cut into bite size pieces and used minced onions since I didn’t have any onions on hand. I then topped it off with Colby & Monterey Jack shredded cheese. The boyfriend had to large helpings. Very easy and quick to make, we will do this one again.

These are perfect scalloped potatoes!! I as many tweaked the recipe as most people seem to do. I chopped the onions very fine as I like the flavour and texture better. I also coated all the potatoes with flour mixed in a separate bowl. I then warm the milk and butter and thicken it and melt in some Parmesan petals. I pour the mixture over the layered potatoes slowly to allow sauce to get to all layers. I then let it cook till done and top is brown. We love them as well will be sending a big pan full with my husband for his Canadian Thanksgiving Pot Luck at work. Best scalloped potatoes I've ever made!!

I also used a roux to make the sauce and a little extra milk to to just cover the potatoes. It came out delicious!

Just the way my mom made it.  With one exception, she added cubes of velvetta between the layers, making it thicker and creamier.  Try it.

This was delicious!! I only made some slight modifications. I whisked the milk in a saucepan with the flour until it thickened (only a few min) and covered the onions and potatoes with the mixture. Delicious. Made this last week and I'm making it again tonight :)

Delicious!  I added garlic powder and season salt to my milk mixture and left out the salt and I also added about a half cup of sour cream to my warm milk.  When I took it out the oven, it seemed a bit soupy but by the time I served it, it was the perfect consistency.

Gross. Bland. The flour gives it a pasty thick texture. Sliced my potatoes 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick and after 1.5 hours of baking they are still crunchy. Even with added cheese and lots of salt and pepper it still tastes bland. And it bubbled over and made a huge burnt stinky mess in my oven. I weighed the potatoes so I had exactly 3 lbs and there is no way all of this fits in a 9x13 dish. It was supposed to be part of a Father's Day meal. What a failure.

Oh my gosh this was the easiest and best tasting scalloped potatoes I've ever made.....my notes: as I slice each potato, I put it in a pan of cool water with some lemon juice to keep them from turning grey......I didn't have a fresh onion, so I sprinkled dehydrated chopped onion....rave reviews from my guests.  Thank you for this recipe!  I love how the flower is layered in, rather than making a roux .

Yummy!  I've made this a few times.  I prefer onion powder to the sliced onions.  I add peas or peas & carrots to make it a veggie dinner. I use corn starch or gluten free flour in place of regular flour.  I made it  most recently in a 10" iron skillet & it cooked up nicely with a lovely crisp on the top.

I would say it needs something, but not sure what. It definitely needed an hour to bake, but I'm not the best with my knife skills. I did the rue thing by melting the butter and whisking in the flour until it was a paste then added milk until it was warm and mixed well. I did however add shredded cheese because my gut said milky buttery potatoes wouldn't be that great. I will make again and maybe add some spices to the mix.

Because 18 people were going to be eating this at my son's house, I increased everything.  I used a 9x13. pan but it is very deep.  I put too much in the pan so when I added the milk to the top of the potatoes like the recipe said, it bubbled over onto the bottom of my oven, causing it to smoke.  I had to finish cooking it at my son's house and had to cook it a lot longer.  It was my own fault.  I am going to try it again until I get it perfect.  However, next time I will mix the flour, milk and butter together like some people recommended.  Hopefully, I can become the family expert at scalloped potatoes.

Loved it with one small change. Mom suggested using a béchamel sauce instead of just layering  flour, milk and butter.
Make your sauce then pour over each layer. Boy was in good!

Very good! I halved the recipe, still used half a small onion, 1/4 tsp each salt and black pepper, 1/2 1% milk and 1/2 5% light cream. Mine baked in exactly 45 minutes, I stirred it at 30 mintes and sprinkled the top with salt free Emeril's Essence. Yummy!

The. Best.  I made just a few changes for personal taste and for using up what I had on hand.  I omitted the onion because I don't care for them with potatoes.  I used less butter and flour (maybe 3-4 T of each) because I had a cup of heavy cream to use up so I substituted half the milk for the cream.  I thought with that change the full amount of butter might be too much.   I was also making a slightly smaller batch, so I used about 2 pounds of potatoes and 2 cups of milk/cream.  Loved the method of just sprinkling the flour and butter over the potatoes as I layered them.  So quick and easy. I also took another reviewer's suggestion and used my food processor to slice.  After peeling the potatoes, this literally took less than 5 min to throw together and into the oven it went.  Also took another reviewer's suggestion to lower the temp and cook longer just so everything would come out at the same time for Easter dinner, but I'm sure the higher temp and less baking time would be great also.  Baked at 350 degrees for about an hour and a half.   So So good ... there were none left.  We even scraped the bottom of the dish.  Nicely done, janebp!

I added a few less onions but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It turned out great. I would definitely use this recipe again.

It is an excellent recipe and the family that gathered for Easter Sunday dinner raved about the flavor and texture of the dish.  Definitely goes into my collection.

No changes as I love it cooked this way. Makes a great potato dish but make sure that you use warm milk.

Made as per the instructions.  It was tasty but very soupy the first night.  The 4 rating is due to how marvelous it was the second night.  I recommend less liquid or prepare the day before.

The recipe is very good , but I prefer to cook the butter, flour, milk and onions whisking to avoid lumps then add to potatoe layers and bake. Ingredients are just right though. I also appreciate that you don't add cheese to this recipe. So many scalloped potatoes recipes have added cheese and I think of that as Augratin 
.

I have made this recipe several times. My kids love it. The only touches I have added are: chopped up bacon for a smokey flavour and a dusting of cheese on top, broiled to finish crispy!

These are delicious!  I eat gluten and dairy free, so I used gluten free flour, cashew milk and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and they came out extra creamy and really, really good!  No one would ever know they are lower in calories and fat.  YUMMY!

made these twice, came out perfect both times.  You have to let them sit for at least 15-20 minutes after you take them out of the oven to let them set up.  I like the onion flavor but you could just not add them if you don't.  I used a little granulated garlic with salt and pepper.  Simple and delicious!

This came out really good. I accidentally used a Vidalia onion, which is of course much sweeter than a yellow onion. It would have tasted better had I used yellow. In any case, it's a delicious and EASY recipe. I'd definitely make again.

Super easy! I added cheese with each layer and it was great! Next time I make this I will add some seasoning....SALT, garlic, etc. It needs it. However, my husband liked that he could season his to his liking.

I made these potatoes for Thanksgiving - to have along side ham.  Everyone loved them.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I added a bit of paprika and garlic powder for each layer.  I will definitely make these again.

There was a bit too much flower but otherwise it came out fantastic. It's a very easy recipe for someone who's never cooked before (like me) :)

This reminded me of how my mom would make it too. Very simple. I used green onion and sprinkled chives on top after baking. I also added extra butter to the milk before pouring over the potatoes. My hubby said it had flavor which is good. I cut the recipe in half. I did not have any issues with it being too watery. It came out perfect! I will make it again.

Very good. I found that after the dish was out of the oven and left to sit 15 or 20 minutes the sauce thickened up nicely.

Pure and simple comfort food - great for my weekly cheat dinner! I'm not a big fan of onions, so I subbed onion powder to get a bit of the flavor in there. Also, added some ham to make it a complete meal (when paired with some veggies of course). I had to call my mom and tell her that I had made this - she was proud haha! Overall, when I'm craving some nostalgic-not-so-healthy-crazy-delicious food, this will be my go to recipe!

I added some sharp cheddar cheese on top of each layer for a more augratin taste. The potatoes were a little hard, so I would cook it 10 minutes longer the next time I made it. It was very good, but we did have to add some salt and pepper to taste.

This is how our family has made this for over 100 years. The only thing we do different is shift the flour with a hand shifter between each layer and do not heat the milk. Just pour it over cold.

I made this recipe for Christmas Day.  I added some garlic powder to the layers and then shredded gruyere cheese over the top during the last ten minutes of cooking.  I have tried to make these with a recipe from my old fashioned cookbook, and the potatoes were raw and the sauce lumpy.  The temperature and cooking time are spot on.  And, I think the heated milk IS the trick for a nice, creamy sauce.  Will definitely make this again!

I used this method because it was affirmation of how I remember Mom making our scalloped potatoes which I have yearned for often. Because I knew she "winged" it, I did the same and was very pleased with the results--even had as a midnight snack. The only reason I gave less than five was that I think I probably should have used russet potatoes to get the texture I was looking for. Since there wasn't a specific recommendation, I used what I had on hand which were red-skinned potatoes. They were more slick and stuck together than I remember so I will try again with russets to see what happens. I fully blame myself, I even thought of that but was anxious to try. Thank you, janebp, for giving me exactly what I was looking for! A true scalloped potato method like Mom's that is basic and creamy, without canned soup or cheese. Cheese in scalloped potatoes is really potato au gratin in my humble opinion. This is a keeper and a "go to" in my recipe box.

I gave this 4 stars, because I think it has great potential. I made the dish according to the "how to make video", and while it I have some minor criticisms, they are probably easily corrected by adjusting ingredients and technique. If I had read the right reviews, I would have quickly realized that making a roux was the way to go. That way the flour, butter and milk are evenly disseminated. I will also suggest using entire slices of onion, instead of rings. This should make the dish a bit tighter, allowing for less roux, and making the dish much less runny. I would also be safe to say that salt and pepper are your friends and shouldn't be used sparingly. It does need the full hour of bake time. Finally, as janebp suggests, don't think/worry about amount of the ingredients shown. Make the recipe to fit your baking dish.

I followed the advice of others and made a roux, added milk and seasonings, and then poured over top the layered onions and potatoes. What was very aggravating is that it took me almost DOUBLE the listed cooking time even though the onions and potatoes were sliced quite thin using a mandoline.  I had to crank up the temperature to 425° toward the end just to finish them, so we had steak, mushrooms, and asparagus for dinner, and potatoes for dessert. Happy birthday, Dad!  So embarrassing and unfortunate.  Wish I could subtract 1.5 stars... they were quite tasty, though.  Make these in advance and reheat is my advice.

When I went in search of a scalloped potato recipe, I was amazed to see how many included cheese.   No, no... then they'd be au gratin potatoes.  So I was happy to find this and very pleased with the results.  The recipe doesn't say it, but it only made sense to me to cover the pan with foil before baking.
