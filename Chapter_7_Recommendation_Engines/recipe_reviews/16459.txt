I did not care for this, and I should have known better than to make this in the first place when I saw the ingredients and their proportions in the recipe. I made the mistake of paying attention only to some of the 5-star reviews and not the more accurate 1-star reviews, which are VERY accurate. I agree with them completely that the mayonnaise is WAY overwhelming, Worcestershire doesn't really have a place here, the garlic is overwhelming too, and it's too thick. I tried my best to doctor it up by adding some buttermilk but, alas, the damage was already done. A horrible waste of good ingredients, particularly expensive Blue cheese. I'll stick to the one I simply throw together myself with equal parts sour cream and buttermilk,  and a LITTLE mayo. (Also, for those who are interested, salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste, a pinch of sugar, and a LITTLE splash of white vinegar)

Being a HUGE fan of blue cheese, I have made this recipe countless times- I even converted my boyfriend to blue cheese dressing instead of ranch dressing! I have tried to vary it with lower-fat items and it just didn't work- stick to the recipe and you've got a fantastic dressing. I have found that the best brand of blue cheese crumbles for this recipe is Treasure Cave, so if you can find it, try it!

I'll start off by admitting that I loathe the taste of mayonnaise.  With that said, I have to say that I just didn't love this.  I wanted to but the mayonnaise taste was overpowering to me.

Great dressing, used fresh garlic and tablespoon of lemon juice, cut the worcestershire sauce in half, skipped the salt and used about and ounce of the cheese pureed it with the rest of the ingredients in my blender, then added the rest of the cheese, turned out great.  This would be a great way for those who need the dressing in a hurry, because it already had a great flavor when I was done.

This recipe ROCKS!  The best blue cheese dip I have ever had!

I put in a wee bit less W. sauce (too much makes it a bit brown) than recommended, upped the garlic powder (Watch the amount of garlic powder though - once I put a bit too much in and it was dreadful!) and used quite a sharp blue cheese for my best results.

Any leftovers are "cut" with a bit of milk (for a thinner consistency) and used on salads.

The best bleu (not blue, but bleu) cheese recipe I've ever tasted.  I did cut the mayo back to one cup and added a bit of buttermilk to thin.  It gave it a bit of an extra tang, but not that vinegar tang which you find with jar blue cheese "wannabe" dressings.  I add a tsp of MSG which makes the flavors "Pop" a bit.  No need to increase or "up" anything. I love serving this on an iceberg wedge with some sliced tomato.

I love this and make it all the time.  It is rich, creamy and sharp because of the blue cheese.  When making dont skimp on a purchasing a good blue cheese because it makes all the difference in the world.  Also, I have read some complaints about this recipe from other reviewers.  Some state that it has too much mayo.  It does have a "mayo" taste when you first mix it all together but your not suppose to eat it right away!  Let is sit for at lease six hours, or make it the night before like I do.  Also,  yes, worchestire is in the dressing, I hate it by itself, but cant taste it when it is combined with everything.  So people quite your whinning!  Follow the directions, and let it so over night so it can work its magic.  My favorite way to eat it....with grilled jerk chicken wings:)

This is truly a perfectly classic recipe and one of the best home versions I've ever had.  William no worries.. you have it just right.  I thinned mine down with a bit of milk, but not by much.  A true bleu should be very thick.

I made this last night for a last minute casual get-together.  I made it about 2 hours before our company came by. So it wasn't refrigerated for 24 hours, but it was very good.  The flavors blend so nicely together.  My family loved it and I got loads of compliments.  I can't wait to use it again tonight!!

I don't get it! This is the BEST blue cheese dressing ever! For those of you who don't like it, I just don't understand why! Everyone has their own opinion but mine is WOW! First, you have to let this sit to "meld" the flavors. I'm not sure why people say they only taste mayo...maybe you need a better blue cheese. I also have never had this "thin out". Not sure why others did..quality of ingredients maybe? This is my recipe I have used for years! Originally called "Chart House blue cheese" from a restaurant in NYC. Flavor increases as it sets! Original recipe calls for 1/3 tsp garlic powder, which I use. I only add salt after it sits because the blue cheese can be salty.

This dressing is missing something. Perhaps some balsamic vinegar? I increased the blue cheese, thinking that would help, but it didn't. Sorry, I won't be making this one again.

This is the original CHART HOUSE BLEU CHEESE DRESSING recipe.   I made this for years starting in the 60's then developed my own.    Personally, I use the hand blender after adding the cheese and blend smooth then add some large chunks after and stir in.   Add 1/8 to 1/4 cup milk & half n half combo to thin.   Stir in well and refrigerate overnight.  Perfect for dip or dressing.

This is the dressing that we made in the restaurant for decades. It is True Blue. Some who like bottled blue cheese dressing do not like this (especially kids) it is not comparable. I prefer it with equal parts mayo and sour cream, one cup each. That is what is great about this recipe it is versatile.

Save your money and just throw a glob of mayonaise on there! I am trying to learn to make my own blue cheese and made the mistake of trying this one first. I did not care for this recipe! I wish that I had seen the previous review before trying this recipe.

I did not care for this salad dressing and blue cheese dressing is my favorite.  It just tasted like mayo to me.  Maybe I needed a stronger blue cheese.  Not sure.

Anyone giving this recipe one star probably did not let this recipe sit in the refrigerator for a whole 24 hours. The first time I made it I tasted it right away the recipe tasted of lots of mayonaise. So I thought it must be the letting it sit for a full 24 hours in the frig. that brings out the tast of the blue cheese. After a full waite of 24 hours  the tast of the  blue cheese was  outstanding.   The one thing I did  different was use a heavy grind peper that I bought at costco as I like my peper to be bigger then the tiny flakes in the can. I would not change a thing.

Did not like this. Will not be making it again. I love blue cheese but the mayo is way to over powering. I had to throw away. What a waste of blue cheese.

I really hate to give a bad rating, especially when a recipe has so many 5*'s. The flavor of this recipe is good. My problem is after refrigerating 24 hrs as directed, it turned from an extremely thick dressing to thin as milk. I was so hopeful that it would have a nice dressing consistency after sitting. Especially with so many positive reviews. I've tried other blue cheese recipes from different sources and had the same result of it turning too thin after it sat. Now, why is it out of 397 reviews, as of today, only 3 other people complained that it was runny. The people that reviewed that it was too thick, could not have let it refrigerate the 24 hrs as directed. Also, how is it only 4 people had issues with it being runny. I followed this recipe as written. I really want to make my own dressing because we follow an all natural diet. I would love to find a recipe that stays creamy without being to thick or thin.

I think the proportions of sour cream vs mayonaisse should be reversed - this tasted too much like the mayo.  I also didnt dig  it with the worcestershire.  Made another batch with a lot less mayo & w/o the worcester and it was better but still not super-fabulous like I was expecting after the raves.

After reading all the great reviews I was surprised at how horrible this was. Maybe the blue cheese I used was bad.I am afraid to make this again so I guess I will never know.

Terrific!  My hubby and I used it on buffalo chicken wraps and loved it.  It's thick and creamy.  I do add more blue cheese because we love it.  I also put it on a little romaine lettuce and truly did not need anything else on it.  It will be my bleu cheese dressing from now on since there are NO store-bought ones that are worth it.

This recipe is awesome!  Leave as is for a delicious and thick blue cheese dip.  For dressing, to make it pourable, I cut the mayo down to 1/2 cup and thin with buttermilk until desired consistency. For those who rated this a ONE star and say that worchestershire saw has NO business in a blue cheese dressing recipe should check out several recipes from master chefs. It's used frequently and most definitely adds alot of depth to this recipe.  HINT! If you don't have buttermilk (MUCH more yummy than regular milk), add 1 T of white or apple cider vinegar to a cup of milk. Stir lightly and watch it thicken!  I make this dressing hours ahead of time so the flavors can really meld together. Yummy!

This recipe tasted too much like mayonaise.  It was easy to make and i followed it to the "T". I think i'll just buy it next time.

I'm sorry but I just don't get it.  I have made this dressing twice now and it just is not that good.  The dressing is too thick and the flavor is muddied by the worchestershire and excessive garlic.

These are the exact ingredients and amounts used by the famous Chart House Restaurant.  I have used this for years and it is the perfect hostess gift over the holidays.

I made it absolutely according to the directions, jarred it, put in the fridge overnight.  Got it out the next day and it was soupy.  Not much flavor to the soupy part either.

I have been making this recipe exactly as written for a few years now.  I have served it as a dip for veggie trays at many gatherings and people RAVE about it every time.  I just attended a Kentucky Derby Party and just about every lady there asked for the recipe.  I doubled it and it still disappeared too quickly.  People will ask me what it is and when I tell them blue cheese dressing they say things like "But I don't like blue cheese dressing, this can't be blue cheese dressing because it's the best stuff I've ever tasted!"  You will never ever buy bottled blue cheese ever again.

Great dressing. I've used it with almost everything, buffalo wings, veggie platter... It's great for the "wedge salad" you see in many restaurants as well. Cut a head of iceburge lettuce in quarters. Place one quarter on each plate and top with the blue cheese dressing. Top with additinal crumbled blue cheese and crumbled bacon, and add a few grape tomatoes on the edge, and you've got a tasty elegant first course.

I cut the salt to 1/4 tsp. ( the real recipe calls for a SCANT 1/2 tsp.), cut the worcestershire sauce to 3/4 tsp. and the mayo down to 1 cup. I also add a good pinch of onion powder.

Very good. I don't recommend that you serve it after 2 or 3 hrs because it's okay. Tatses much better when it's left for the 24 hrs.

Hey, William!  Thanks for the cool, creamy, tangy "party in your mouth" dressing that tastes even better the next day.   As a low carb eater encouraged to have ample amounts of protein/fat this dressing was perfect with the Buffalo Chicken Wings recipe listed in this site.  I *love* Allrecipes.com!

The best dressing in the WORLD!!  I love thick dressing and this is the best.  Very easy to make.  Not strong tasting as some blue cheese dressings are.  Will make time and time again.  Served over lettuce wedge with chopped tomatoe as a well known steak restaurant serves.  Next time I will try using Gorgonzola cheese.  This dressing ROCKS!!

I have made this several times over the past year and it is by far one of the best blue cheese dressing recipes I've found. My husband and I both love it. I've made it with Danish Blue, Stilton, and Gorgonzola and all were tasty.  I did lighten it up by using light Sour cream and light mayo, but after a few days, it turns sort of runny (haven't figured out why yet)- still tastes good though.  I also added a 1/4 cup fresh grated Regiano parmesan cheese that really enhances the flavor.

I have an even better Blue Cheese Dressing recipe!  However I do rate this because of the difference in both ingredients, and preparation.  If you are out of an ingredient, you use what you you have on hand, don't you?

Dont look any further. This is the best.  Even better a few days later.  I used with English Stilton cheese. I also added a little half and half to loosen it up to serve with endives and roasted walnuts.  Silvia Gerber, NYC

My husband and I both love blue cheese, and this dressing is one we thinks kicks butt.  We did make a modification, though.  We like our dressing a little thicker.  I doubled the recipe and instead of putting 1-1/2 cups of sour cream, I divided that amount between sour cream and cream cheese.  It was really thick initially, but waiting 24 hours helps thin it a bit to a consistency we love.  This one is a keeper!

This is the best blue cheese dressing I've ever had. I made it about 5 times now and its perfect every time. I noticed alot of reviewers say that it tastes like mayo, which it does when you first make it.. but after the required 24-hour rest in the refrigerator, it just explodes with flavor! Very important to let it sit overnight so that the cheese has a chance to permeate its flavor throughout the dressing completely. This is the only blue cheese dressing I need, thanks for sharing it!

I halved the recipe and it was thick and creamy.  I normally use another recipe from this site for blue cheese dressing but I've become bored with it so I decided to try another one.  This was the highest rated in the search.  I however will not be making this again.  It tasted of nothing but mayonnaise.  I used full fat sour cream and name brand mayo.  I think it needs some vinegar and I'm not sure what else.

This is the same recipe I've been using for several years, and it is FABULOUS!  No added preservatives etc. ingredients you can't pronounce!  You will never buy store bought again.  Takes just minutes to make.  I do add a touch of fresh garlic. Yummy!

I found that I like the little kick that Worcestshire & dry mustard bring, but the proportions of sour cream & mayo (especially) were too much, even as a dip.  I did some more looking on this site & combined some of the seasoning from this recipe with "Absolutely the BEST Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing Ever!" - - - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/absolutely-the-best-rich-and-creamy-blue-cheese-dressing-ever/detail.aspx

Enjoyed the taste when coupled with homemade potatoe chips and buffalo wings. This was too thick to be called "dressing" was more like a dip.  Next time I would cut down on the mayonaise.

There used to be a restaurant in town called Hartman's steakhouse. They were famous for two things: fried banana peppers, and their blue cheese dressing.  If you ordered a house salad, there was as much dressing as lettuce, and a few diced tomatoes. Add some pepper, and it was heaven.  Obviously this was very old fashioned, probably from the 1950's or 60's.  Anyway, they closed maybe twenty years ago, and since then I've been looking for fried banana peppers and blue cheese dressing that reminded me of Hartman's. I used three times the cheese called for, but I think I've found one of them with this recipe.

This is the best blue cheese dressing - only needed a little milk to make more of a dressing consistency - without milk it's more like a dip.

I have been using this recipe for 4 years now, and it ROCKS! Every person who tastes it begs for the recipe. It really does taste so much better if you wait 24 hours(but who can??). The only changes I have made are to double the amount of blue cheese and to thin it down a bit with milk the next day as it tends to have a "dip" consistency.

This recipe is awesome. The consistency is perfect. I actually didn't have mustard powder, so I used some Grey Poupon instead as an improvisation. Thank you so much for this recipe. I'll never go back to store bought!

Yummy!  Used a cup of mayo and a cup of light sour cream.  I added a few extra's, like lemon juice, hot sauce, parsley flakes and basil.  I put everything into my food processor, except for half of the blue cheese.  I processed it all until smooth, then stirred in the rest of the blue cheese, to leave a few chunks.  It hasn't had time to sit in the fridge long but it's so good!

I AM THE BIGGEST BLUE CHEESE DRESSING FANATIC OUT THERE!!!  This recipe is soooooo good, so good!!!  I had to modify it a hair though!  Dont be scared to use the Worchester Sauce at all, doesnt even make it brown!  Do not use real garlic, or the whole amount unless you like it real garlicy!!!  I use about a 1/4 tsp of garlic, and it does the job just fine!  You will need to thin out the dressing a little.  Just use some milk, about a 1/8-1/4 cup will give you the best consistency!  Danish blue cheese is sooo good in it, but mix it up a little, add a little gorgonzola cheese as well!  This recipe rocks, dont change a thing, but I have tested this recipe out a couple of times before adding a review, and i think you will find this very helpful!!!  Enjoy!!!

Excellent blue cheese dressing.  Be warned the recipe really does make a LOT and it is so thick that you end up with more after you thin it.  I split it in half and only put worcestershire sauce in one half because some reviewers thought it was gross in there, then we had a taste test (the next day).  In the end I added it to the other half because we liked it better with than without.  It made it just *slightly* off white, perhaps those who thought it was too strong used a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon?  I don't know, but it didn't turn *mine* brown and it was hardly apparent except for a slight salty tang.  We finished off the leftovers by dipping sliced apples into it.  That was a great late night snack.  I wish I had some now...

Very, VERY good, and makes a great dip for raw vegetables if thinned a bit (milk works).  Three die-hard blue cheese lovers separately commented on how much they liked this dressing.  A WORLD  apart from bottled, and easy, too.  Thank so much!

This recipe kicks butt!!!  Finally, a blue cheese dressing I can make at home that's as good, if not better, than the restaraunt!  I even used light mayo and its just amazing!  Don't judge the flavor until it has all had a chance to "marry" over a few hours, even better the second day!
Thanks for a great recipe William!

I've an aversion to Worcestershire sause, so I left it out, and this dressing is OUTSTANDING. Identical to the dressing my mom made, I am thrilled to taste it again after so many years.  Bill, perftect balance, thanks.

I love this dressing, I added diced onions to it. I also used fat-free sour cream and light mayo.  It still tasted great only problem was it was to thin this way.  If someone has an idea to thicken it with lowfat ingredients let me know.  Will make again and again.

This salad dressing was great! It was a little salty so the next time I make it - I will omit the salt and maybe check for a low salt blue cheese. This recipe is a keeper!

This is my go to recipe whenever I make wings and it never fails to impress.  I change the recipe a little by using 1 cup mayonnaise and 1 cup sour cream, I use a full teaspoon of pepper and it gives it a little kick that puts it over the top.  Thanks William!

PERFECT!  Just like what they serve at the good restaurants here at the shore.  Thick and full of crumbles, not runny like store-bought dressing.  We loved it as a dressing but I will also serve it as a dip with celery and carrots sticks along with wings for football season.  Thank you William for sharing your recipe!

I've read the bad review but let me tell you someone's taste is off! When and if it gets too thick you just add a little milk until you get it to the consistency you prefer.  THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST BLUE CHEESE ON THE PLANET and I have looked and tried them. The Worcestershire sauce adds an essential taste that enhances this dressing in a way you can not tell it is in it. This is the recipe where you go out to an expensive restaurant and have that salad with the blue cheese dressing that is to die for. This is it and it is so easy to make.  I believe the bad blue cheese is called Maytag if I recall. Steer clear of it as it is awful. I stick with the Danish Blue's.

I'd give this more stars if I could!!  I've made this several times and my family LOVES it!!  It's PERFECT for chicken wing dip and last night I made the Chicken Wing Pizza recipe from this site  - using this AMAZING Blue Cheese Dressing -for the base and my whole family gobbled it up - I thought my husband would explode - he couldn't stop eating!!  Bill you should look into producing this commercially - it's WAY better than any store bought dressing that I've ever tried and WAY better than most restaurants too!!  DELICIOUS!!

What great dressing!  Only modifications were to flip amounts of mayo/sour cream at other users suggestion & I added a few dashes of lemon juice and fresh chopped parsley.  AMAZING!  (I also doubled bleu cheese - but that's just a personal preference.)  I will NEVER use another bleu cheese dressing recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is THE BEST blue cheese dressing EVER! The only additions I make are 1 Tbsp of white vinegar (for extra tang), i use a bit more blue cheese than the recipe calls for and I use fresh garlic as opposed to powder.

Seriously, the best!!

Yum! I adjusted the recipe a bit--used veganaise and lowfat sour cream. I used a tablespoon or so of the sweet spring onions and purple garlic that came in my CSA box today. Left out the mustard and added the juice of a 1/2 lemon. I mixed it in the Magic Bullet, then stirred in some additional blue cheese crumbles. It's yummy now, and I can't wait to put it over a iceberg wedge with bacon and tomatoes!!

Excellent dressing, but I suggest dispensing with the salt, as there is enough of it in the other ingredients and spicing the dressing up with a teaspoon of pepper rather than half of one and a dash of tabasco sauce.

This is the one!  I have tried many of the blue cheese dressings/dips on this site and this one is by far the best.  I too added more sour cream than mayo (personal preference) and two cloves of fresh garlic and dijon mustard instead of powdered.  I have served this dip at my last two parties to absolute raves.  It's fabulous!  Thanks Bill!

Excellent dressing.  We prefer to cut the blue cheese in half and add a little 1/2 & 1/2 or milk to make it creamier.  Perfect over a salad of fresh greens, toasted pecans, fresh pear, nleu cheese and craisins.

This is AWESOME!  It's soo easy to make and just takes perfect.  I used one substitution, I did not have sour cream so I made buttermilk (1 C half & half to 1 tbs vinegar).  The consistency was pourable and even with out the blue cheese it tastes great, I think it tastes similar to the Hidden Valley "buttermilk" variety seasoning packet.  I know this high in fat, but it's great and I'll never buy store bought again! Ten stars if I could :)

EXCELLENT ... doesn't need the salt.  I cater and have been experimenting with different dips/dressings and found that if you add 1-10oz pkg. of frozen chopped spinach, well drained to this it makes a great dip for a veggie platter or breadsticks.  Rave Reviews from my last client!  Thanks Bill!!!

Fabulous!  Only change I made was to add an extra dash or two of worcestershire sauce.  I used this dressing to make "buffalo style chicken pizza" (also on this site).  Soooo much better than any store bought blue cheese dressing I've had.

Amazing! This has a little spice to it and a wonderful balance of flavors. My husband, who is blue-cheese-phobic, even loves this. I have tried it with light sour cream and mayo, and although the flavor is still great, the end product turns out a little thinner.

I have searched long and hard for a great blue cheese dressing and finally found one! This is so so so good...the only thing i do differently is add a little less salt...only because I'm not huge on salt...but this is fabulous!!!

Loved it! Made it with Feta cheese and it was just fabulous!  Also took the advice and used it on the Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza from this site ~ it was a real success and will be used again and again! Thanx!

I love blue cheese dressing, but not the store bought kind.  Until I tried this recipe I thought I could only enjoy blue cheese dressing this good in a fine restaurant.  This dressing is perfect, the only thing I might try next time is a fine Danish blue cheese to give it a little more pungent blue cheese taste, but other than that, don't change a thing!

This deserves 10 stars. I was not a big fan of blue cheese until I tried this recipe. It is to die for! Even my kids who don't like blue cheese thought this was delish when I used it with the Buffalo Chicken Pizza recipe on this site. Thank you Bill for one of the best recipes I have found on this site!

This is so tasty! This one tastes like the ones at restaurants.  It's very rich and a little goes a long way, but I will definitely make it when I want a good, rich dressing.

Delicious. Made twice and used half the mayo and substituted the sour cream for plain yogurt. Was just as delicious and felt a little less guilty indulging.

Fabulous just as written. Perfect for Iceberg Wedge salad, or just for dipping celery and other veggies. Try with various bleu cheeses: Stilton is fabulous, as is Roquefort, St. Agur. However, do NOT use the crappy crumbles you can buy, those are rank and make anything taste crappy. Slice off a chunk of good bleu and dice it up. Heaven.

I absolutely loved this blue cheese dressing, even though I made a major healthy substitution!  I subbed all of the sour cream and one cup of the mayo for greek yogurt.  Definitely let it sit overnight to "marry".  Everyone I served this to loved it and said it tasted just like blue cheese dressing and could not detect the greek yogurt in the dish!  Yay!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, William!

I have already found this same recipe on another site.  I made it exactly as stated.  I used Roquefort and I made my own mayonnaise - with fresh eggs, lemon juice etc.  which means that it turns out a beautiful bright yellow.  It was very good.

If you are worried about fat, skip this recipe. Otherwise, get ready to never buy blue cheese dressing again! This is my go to recipe for blue cheese dressing. It's excellent on just about everything! A must try!

Yes, I would say it would be better with a tad less mayo and garlic powder.  Also the blue cheese came in a 5 oz package and we used all that.  It was good!!

Awesome! The only comment I have is for the people who complained of "mayonnaise" taste: If you are using Kraft mayonnaise or, heaven forbid, Miracle Whip, throw that stuff out and switch to Hellman's.

Awesome!  I added 2 TBSP minced onion, 1 TBSP minced garlic, 1 TBSP lemon juice and 1 TBSP white wine vinegar.  Delicious served with Old Fashioned Onion Rings (recipe on this site).  For the onion rings I replace the milk with beer.  Your man will love you forever if you make those two recipes.

PERFECTO!!!  I really like blue cheese dressing & a lot of the blue cheese dressing you buy out the store has a sweet taste to it (Wishbone). Which I have in the fridge as I type this review.. Since I had all these ingredients I decided to make it from scratch. I was only making a little so I eyeballed the proportions I had a small canister of crumble blue cheese I added at the end. It came out perfect.. I'm throwing the wishbone blue cheese dressing in the trash.

Very yummy.  Use less strong blue cheese if you don't want it overpowering.
Oh and 12 servings is a bunch.  This makes well over 2 cups.

What an absolutely perfect blue cheese dressing. I used a special blue cheese wedge that I had located at a specialty cheese store. Its flavor was magnificent. I followed this recipe to the exact, using the special blue cheese and was absolutely amazed. Thanks for a great recipe!

I really don't like to rate recipes I've altered but everones taste is a little different and I even alter recipes I've used forever because your tastes are always changing, however I think was was a very good dressing.  I did make a few modifications though.  I only used 1 cup mayo and closer to 1 cup sour cream.  I used everything else as stated except I did add a pinch of red pepper (I add this to almost everything!) and add the juice of a small lemon.  After I added the lemon juice I thought the flavor was much better.  I think the lemon juice gives it a cleaner taste.  This is just my personal taste though!

This is simply amazing as is.  If you like blue cheese you will love it.  Everytime I make it blue cheese lovers go wild.  Yummo!  It is even good with light mayo and sour cream.

I halved this recipe and the only change I made was to add a little dill for color. Holy moly is it good and I have never liked a blue cheese salad dressing. I did not thin mine down as I like my creamy dressings to be thick and this was just right for us. I added only half the mayo then tasted and all I could taste was sour cream so I ended up adding more mayo a little at a time and ended up using exactly what the recipe called for and it was a nice balance of flavors.

This is so easy to make, however, I'm not sure why it doesn't call for milk or buttermilk. It comes out way too thick to be a dressing. The consistency is more like a dip in my opinion. So, to remedy that I add about a half cup of milk. I also added a tablespoon of pepper, but that is just a matter of preference. I gave it four stars just due to the fact that as written the recipe is really more of a dip than a dressing. Would make again, but with alterations.

Great recipe.  Been making it for several years.  Used 5 oz of blue cheese because that's what was in the container and I hate to waste.  Used fresh garlic instead of powder and also added fresh parsley, some fresh lemon juice and a splash of apple cider vinegar.  Yummy!

This recipe is great for the person who does not want the blue cheese to overpower the dressing but add to it with the other seasonings.  I love blue cheese, this recipe, to me, is the perfect mix of cheese and dressing flavor.

This is the bomb!!! I have made it numerous times and because I'm not a fan of Mayo and Worcestershire Sauce...I reversed the portions of Sour Cream & Mayo, cut Worcestershire Sauce by half and doubled the Bleu Cheese!

Thank you for sharing the absolute winner with us, Bill! You're da man!

This is a great recipe for blue cheese dressing, and easy too! I even used fat free sour cream and will try fat free mayo next time. The only thing I would change is to cut back on the salt, maybe to 1/4 tsp. Some may like it the way it is, though.

Initially, I did not think I was going to give this 5 stars as it tasted a little bland when I first prepared it. I just ate more (2 days later) and WOW!  It really does get better the longer it sits!  Thanks  for the recipe.

I've been making this recipe regularly for over a year and I thought it was time that I finally put down my review. One word AWESOME. It disappears when I make it. My hubby forced me to make it with lite mayo and reduced fat sourcream once, it was find that day but turned watery in the fridge overnight and was wasted. So make sure you add in all the fat. I also use fresh garlic cloves, minced as both hubby and I enjoy garlic, but it can get strong.

very good i didnt realize how easy this would be to make and its well worth trying however if your not the average mayonnaise lover like me and my man i would lay off the 1 cup and 1/3 because  only put 1 cup in there and i could faintly taste the mayonnaise taste so i would use a little more than 1/2 a cup next time!

Used light sour cream and light mayo as that was what I had on hand.  Cut the Worcestershire amount in half and used marginally more cheese (Danish Bleu) than called for.

Amazing dressing!  Nice and chunky.  Made it for the Buffalo Chicken pizza recipe, but really enjoyed it on the green salad I made to go with.

This will be a keeper in my recipe stash.

I made this recipe to be used with "Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza" also from this site.  The only change that I made was to use light mayo.  I would suggest that you make this at least two days before you need it to get the blue cheese flavor throughout.  Earlier than this and it tastes too much like the mayo.  After two days and it was heavenly!

The best blue cheese dressing ever!  I used it to dip vegetables and buffalo wings- perfectly compliment each other.  I also dipped chicken breast in it as a base for baked "fried" chicken! The chicken was sooooo moist!

This recipe was amazing.  We love blue cheese- so we added way more than the recipe called for.  Also, we substituted dijion mustard and fresh garlic for their dried version in the recipe.  It was great!!!

Pretty good but not exactly what I expected. It was a little too thick, more like a dip than a dressing. I added a couple tablespoons of milk to thin it.

I have two or three great blue cheese dressing recipes but I felt like trying a new one since it was so highly rated.  Even though I added more blue cheese than called for this just seemed to lack something.  All my other blue cheese recipes called for buttermilk - so that might be what I miss.

I came across this recipe when trying to recreate a dressing I'd had in a local restaurant and it was almost right on. I upped the blue cheese and added fresh minced garlic and it was perfect. I've made it with several different blue cheeses and Maytag is by far the best. Great job Bill!

I made this at the last minute for a family dinner with out of town guests. It was fabulous after only five minutes and the next day after it chilled overnight... words cannot describe.  My family can burn through this dressing like nobody's business.  Make sure to use quality blue cheese it really does make a difference!! I really like mine peppery, so I use a whole teaspoon of black pepper.  So awesome!

FAB-U-LOUS!  We actually used this as a dip, since it was so thick and creamy.  (The news said a winter snow storm was coming so we actually went out and got a veggie tray just to have with this dip.)  And Bill was right:  Letting it sit overnight is a must.  I can't wait to try this again with Buffalo Chicken Pizza or just good old wings.

To make this recipe a little more heart friendly I used reduced fat sour cream and light mayo and still was very good.

tasted pretty good but i couldn't completely enjoy it knowing how unhealthy it was. i probably would have given it 5 stars had someone else made it. also, i'd use less worcestershire sauce next time.

Make it just like it says - don't thin -just enjoy.  Yum, yum.  I work at a famous steakhouse and this is almost identical.  I absolutely love it even though I don't like bleu cheese.  You gotta try this.  I doubled the recipe also and shared with my sister.  It keeps a long time in the fridge too.  Yummy

Very good.  Next time I will add a little less Worchestershire sauce.  Also, the end result is more dip consistency than dressing, so it may need to be thinned a little bit.

This is the third time I have made this.  It was good the first time and I agree with some reviewers that cutting the Worchestershire sauce in half is the way to go.  I also like to add a 1/2 teaspoon  of Balsamic vinegar.   This time I used   Lea & Perrins Worchestershire sauce for Chicken (which  I believe used to be called their "White Worchestershire") and White Balsamic Vinegar. Doing so lightened the flavor a little and the color a lot.

This is amazing. There's no need looking for a better blue cheese dressing recipe. I didn't change a thing. My husband loved it as well, and he normally isn't a big blue cheese fan. I once thought I could only get dressing like this in resturants. Luckily, I was wrong.

This recipie is the best bleu cheese dressing I have ever had.  I've used fresh garlic, and powdered garlic, both ways are delicious, but for more garlic flavor use fresh.  I also pureed about a tablespoon of the bleu cheese and combined it with the rest of the ingredients before adding the remaining bleu cheese at the end.  Thank you Bill!

This is hands down the best blue cheese dressing I have ever had. Superior to most restaurants dressing. I took the advice of others and used a good danish bleu. I've made this twice now, and it only took me once to understand that you do not crumble this cheese with your bare hands....whewww. I use latex gloves now. I also thinned it down with part buttermilk and whole milk. My husband buys heads of lettuce just to have this dressing. Thanks Bill, you've got a winner with this one.

This is by far the best Blue Cheese Dressing I have ever tried, but choose your own type of Bleu Cheese. I use Danish Bleu Cheese. 
I swear I have never tasted a Bleu Cheese dressing as good as this one. As with some of the other reviewers I changed a couple of things. I used about half the amount of Mayo, and half the W. sauce.  I substituted buttermilk to make up for the Mayo I took out. I used finely minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, and added a few dashes of Tabasco sauce (to taste). After that it was perfect for me.

I've made this recipe several times and just love it.  One thing though - make sure to use a blue cheese you really like.  I usually use a strong Danish blue, but one time I used a different kind (I think it was Treasure something or other crumbles) and it just wasn't as good.  Still better than store-bought, but I liked the dressing with the Danish cheese much better.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I left off the salt and added 1/2 tsp. minced garlic and a few shakes of tabasco sauce -- not to make it hot, just to enhance the flavors.  Put in in the food processor -- terrific!

This was fantastic!  I used a little more blue cheese, and thinned it just a little the second day.  My husband liked it, and our 9 year old son asked if we could add it to our "family favorites" cookbook.  A definite keeper for us!  Thanks Joe!

This makes a nice dressing with subtle flavors that add to the cheese flavor. I needed to add 1/3 cup of milk to achieve the right texture. Cutting the mayonnaise to 1 cup is a nice variation to cut a small amount of fat. The flavor gets better as it sits for at least 24 hours in the fridge.

Instead of regular worchestier(sp?), try using "white wine" worchestier sauce. 
The flavor is very similar and the color is light tan instead of dark brown.

I made this primarily for my boyfriend (also named Bill) because Blue Cheese dressing is his favorite and now I'm a fan too. This is really good stuff. I blended it with one of those hand-held blender stick thingies so it would be smoother....just left minor lumps. A word about salt--if your palate is salt sensitive leave out the salt until you taste it. I never bought blue cheese before, so I don't know if all brands contain salt. I checked the label on mine after the fact and it's in the ingredient list. So I recommend tasting first before salting. I also had to thin it a bit.

Good recipe.  Had to add a little milk; too thick.  Would make recipe again.  Still can't seem to find a recipe that tastes like the dressing I get off the cold shelves in the grocery, but this is the closest I have come by using this recipe.

Best blue cheese dressing I've ever had.  I never let my container run out.  When we have luncheons at work and someones bringing chicken wings I alway bring my own dressing for dipping.  Thanks Bill!

This is the best ever.  I've now been making this recipe for over a year.  My fiance makes the boneless buffalo wings and I do this blue cheese recipe.  It's an awesome combination and always a hit.  Make sure you let it sit in the frige overnight b/c it really makes a difference with the flavor.  One time I didn't make it the day before and it just didn't taste as YUMMY!!

This is the BEST!  I am addicted to plain iceberg lettuce with Bill's fabulous dressing on it.  And I know it certainly is easy to make.  Just something about the combination of ingredients makes for perfection.  Thank you, Bill.

So...I love blue cheese but I have struggled with making my own, and most of what I make I do from scratch. That said-I made it and all I could taste was mayonnaise. I was super disappointed. BUT!  Let it mellow and let the flavors meld. That super May flavor is minimized and the blue cheese flavor takes over and it’s amazing. It’s not expensive to make. Make 1/2 of the recipe, if you are skeptical. Make it, put it in the fridge and let it work it’s magic. Ideally 3-4 hours I guess. THEN try it then decide if you like it. Just a couple of modifications. I add more blue cheese that the recipe calls for. I add about 4 ounces of blue cheese and put it all in a food processor and pulse it 9-10 times and then I add about 2 ounces of crumbled blue cheese and stir it in.

Wanted a blue cheese dressing that didn't include buttermilk (didn't have any) and wasn't overly complicated. Needed to use up some blue cheese and this recipe was great and simple. Used minced garlic from a jar and half the Worcestershire. I'll save this one. It does get better as it sits. Give it that 24 hours if you can.

This has been my go-to blue cheese recipe for nearly 10 years.  It has the perfect balance of flavors.  
I typically make 2 changes... first, since I love blue cheese, I use more than 4 oz. and second, the consistency of the original recipe is very dense, so that it glumps rather than spreads. I have found that adding roughly a quarter cup of buttermilk loosens it just enough, without impacting the flavor at all.

I've been making this recipe for years and it is amazing!  It is thick just like it's supposed to be and if yours is "mayonnaisy" then you've surely done something wrong.  Be sure to let it set so the flavors can meld and don't skimp on the blue cheese.  I used Boar's Head creamy blue cheese.

Followed the recipe.  Tasted like mayonnaise with blue cheese crumbles.  It was terrible.  I bet cream cheese would have been much better than sour cream.  It was just not even edible.

The one star ratings have me confused - is it too thick or too runny? I've made this dressing numerous times and it's delicious and comes out perfect every time!  The only ingrediant I change is the amount of blue cheese because I love  its flavor so I always add more.  Make sure you let it sit in the refrigerator for twenty-four hours to enhance the flavor and you will not be disappointed. Use it for dressing or a dip - Delicious!

This is, by far, the best recipe I have used for bleu cheese dressing. Some reviewers said it had too much mayonnaise taste to it. However, it is important to follow the directions and let the flavors meld for 24 hours. This is my to-go-to recipe from now on.

I've made this recipe a number of times and agree it tends to be very thick. HOWEVER today was the best. And for those who are of the opinion that they don't like mayo my question is "are you using mayo or a 'Miracle Whip' type product?  I ask because where I've lived in recent years I've found people use the term mayo interchangeably.  Nevertheless this time I did make a few changes. First I only use BelGioioso blue cheese (it's an Italian blue cheese / Gorgonzola to be specific). I used the 4 oz. the recipe called for and blended in a blender adding a little more time 1/4 cup half and half. When I reached the consistency we prefer for salad dressing and right before removing from the blender I added an additional 2 oz. of crumbled blue cheese and just used a spoon to incorporate.   Oh regarding mayo, good mayo makes the difference try Hellmann's.

Thank you for sharing your recipe.   This is by far the best tasting Blue cheese dressing I've had in a very long time.  
As for all those on here that have criticized the ingredients and the overpowering taste of mayonnaise, you're wrong.
We upped the blue cheese to 5oz. (I like blue cheese).  After we mixed the ingredients, we did as says, "let it rest covered in fridge for 24 hours".  If you were to eat it right away, it will have more of a mayo taste.  
The wife and I  would pull it out and stir it every few hours when we remembered, (just what we elected to do).  Then at the 24 hour mark, it would be a hit.

I've made this three times and there is a drastic change in consistency within the 24hr refrigeration period. It starts out super thick, and the next day is very thin. I always substitute 0% Greek Yogurt for the Sour Cream; maybe this is a factor. Flavor is great. I sometimes add a squeeze of lemon juice. High quality blue cheese recommended.

So I made this dressing without looking at reviews, which is not like me. I was very disappointed in the strong mayonnaise flavour, I looked at the reviews and that is when I seen someones recipe for this design. I added a teaspoon of vinegar and loads of blue cheese, as I love it chunky, and what a difference!! I am not going to put a 1 rating as it was a great start for the dressing. It really does need the vinegar to offset the mayonnaise flavour.

This is ridiculously awesome. On par or better than any I've ever had, anywhere. My wife wholeheartedly agrees and loves when I make this for salads and dip. Only change I make is I add 6 Oz. of crumbled bleu cheese, rather than 4 Oz. because, why not? The container is 6 Oz, might as well make it 50% more awesome.

It's ok but I like mine better. It's 1 cup of whipped whipping cream, 1 cup sour cream, fold together and add  1/2 teaspoon worchestershire, 3/4 teaspoon garlic salt, bleu or gorgonzola cheese as desired. Place in fridge til cold.

The mayo was too overpowering and the ingredients don't balance well. If you're going to put in this much effort and cost, you might as well put in a little more effort and make a traditional blue cheese dressing.

Great recipe! I made it twice, the second time I cut way down on the mayo because I like a more milky flavor vs a mayo flavor. I didn't have any dry mustard so I used a splash of regular mustard. I used gorganzola instead of blue cheese (which is almost the same).

I really liked this with minor changes like half the Worcestershire sauce, fresh garlic and a splash of lemon. The only problem was that after 24 hours it was WAY to runny. Luckily, we had most of ours the first day when it had set for about eight hours, which is how I would do it again.

This is THE BLue Cheese Dressing recipe from which to work from.  I simply say work from, as it, gives you the basis to make a more waterier version etc.  I haven't had blue cheese dressing since moving out of America and this brought back all the best memories of ordering an iceberg salad in a diner with my parents.  Yum-o!

Awesome.  I'm an expat living in Spain where blue cheese dressing is not common and often difficult to find, and every time I get together with my American friends I make this for dipping celery in and get rave reviews.  Definitely hits the spot.

We're fortunate to have the Rogue Creamery nearby and had some of their famous blue cheeses on hand in the freezer.  This dressing/dip was wonderful served with some Buffalo chicken breasts, and when thinned down a bit, it was terrific on a salad.  The particular blue cheese I  used was pretty strong, so next time, I may reduce the amount by nearly half. I did whirl the  ingredients in a blender to make it very smooth.  Thanks for a great recipe - it's a keeper!

This simple Blue Cheese dressing is absolutely fabulous and the best part is that it uses basic ingredients that most people have on hand.  It is very thick and heavy on the mayo, but perfect as a dip for chips and veggies or great as a sandwich spread.  I used it as a sandwich spread for a Cobb Sandwich (recipe on this site) and am looking forward to having it on a burger.

As I always use recipes as a guideline rather than an exact blueprint; made this twice now. Once thinned w/heavy whipping cream (have used milk) to my liking. Also added a squeeze of lemon and two dashes of vinegar (once regular, then rice wine {as i was too lazy to get in my basement}). Using very fresh ground pepper is critical. As I'm reviewing I see that I omitted mustard & garlic, so I can image it'd be 5++ stars. Make ahead so flavors meld; serving for Mom's 75th b'day bash tomorrow on wedge salad w/crumbled bacon, diced red onion, chopped heirloom tomatoes, blue cheese crumbles & fresh cracked pepper. They'll love it; enjoy!

Wow. Seriously good.  Also, the nutritional info is based on 3.33 tbl spoons, which is 1.67 times a normal label's serving - which means it's not actually any worse for you...but way more delicious.

loved this, second time i opted for a healthier version which my sometimes "picky" boyfriend said tasted the same. I used 1 cup of greek yogurt instead of sour cream and less than a cup of low fat mayo. I would use the blue cheese to taste since every brand varies.

This is the best basic recipe I've come across.  I normally make a smaller amount and substitute a lesser amount of gorgonzola for the bleu cheese in this recipe.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good, but it was much better after sitting in the fridge for a couple of days.  It was just ok after 24 hours.  But I'm 2 days in, and I've had 2 salads today just so I could use some.  Yum!

Really it's 10 stars **********
This is almost always in my fridge! To make it easy to remember, I use equal portions of sour cream and mayo - 1 cup each and 1/2 teaspoon of everything else because I found the worcestershire a bit too overwhelming so I cut it back to half for my taste. It is a thick dressing and I suppose you could thin it a bit with some milk or buttemilk. Makes a great veggie or chip dip too!

I make blue cheese at home all the time, but this is the best recipe I've ever tasted! It was spectacular, well-balanced, and it was QUICK. If I could have given it more than five stars, I would have.

I made this with fat free sour cream, high-quality bleu cheese, and low-fat mayo.  It tasted incredibly fresh with a strong blue cheese flavor (I added extra!) I'm not a "measuring cup kinda gal" so I just used equal parts mayo, s.cream, and blue cheese with a dash of each of the spices. YUM.

I loved the taste of this recipe and it was thick when I put it in the frig, but after it set there for a few days, it got really runny.

Really good blue cheese dressing.  I used the Treasure Cave blue cheese.  Next time I will try a better quality cheese.  Should make it even better!

I am a bleu cheese lover and this was THE BEST dressing I have had!  I admit that I make a pilgrimage up to Oregon to purchase gorgeous Bleu Cheese from The Rogue Valley Creamery.  The only change I made to this recipe was in the preparation....I made BIG crumbles of my bleu cheese and used my electric mixer to incorporate all the ingredients....it left me with a fantastic creamy and chunky dressing.  I used it for a nice dip as well!

I've tried lots of recipes for blue cheese dressing, and this is my favorite.  It's also the fastest to make.    Don't go cheap on the blue cheese - the quality matters!

Great! The blue cheese dressing I have been looking for, you have to let it sit for awhile though if you taste it right after you make it, you can really taste the mayo. By 24 hours though it is perfect!

Very thick and chunky.  Remember not all blue cheeses taste the same.  If you don't like this dressing, try a different blue.  The other ingredients are a perfect compliment.

This was very good!  I did add less mayo and more blue cheese and a couple TBSP. of milk.  I have never really liked blue cheese but my husband loves and after I made this recipe it's my favorite too! Store bought stuff just doesnt compare to fresh!  We had this with chicken wings and celery/carrots.

I almost let the "too much mayo" comments on some of the reviews sway me. I stuck to the recipe except for one thing which was I had a 5 oz. container of blue cheese and that is what I used. This is unbelievably good dressing! I just do not get the poor reviews, but I guess to each his own. This is what I think blue cheese dressing should taste like. I like Marie's or Litehouse as my store bought, but this dressing is much better than both!

This is the best blue cheese dressing ever!  I love homemade dressings and this is a keeper!  I tried to reduce the fat a little and used 1/2 the mayo and added 2/3 cup buttermilk.

I really liked this recipe but "doctored" it a little after making it many times.  I start by putting a small amount of milk in a saucepan, maybe 1/8 cup.  I then add blue cheese crumbles and melt it to a liquid.  Once cooled, I add this to the remaining ingredients, blend, add additionally blue cheese crumbles and then mix by hand.  I like my blue cheese dressing overwhemingly "blue cheesey" and this has been perfect.  You taste nothin but blue cheese and it's not as thick due to the milk.  Hope this helps!

I give this recipe 5 stars because the ingredients are perfect. The changes I made are to the amounts because of personal preference. I used 1 cup each of the sour cream and mayo, 1/4 tsp. worcester sauce, 1/4 tsp black pepper and a splash of milk to make the dressing more fluid. The blue cheese I used was strong in flavor so I didn't increase it. Very good dressing. Thanks for sharing.

Wow!  Loved this dressing.  At first I was going to change the sour cream and mayo mixture amounts around as a lot of reviews suggested but then decided to go with the amounts as written.  We LOVED it!  I did make 3 changes though.  I used a clove of fresh garlic in place of the powder; switched the dry mustard for Dijon and added a little bit of extra blue cheese.  I used just a regular danish blue cheese so it wasn't very strong.  Will make a again and again.  Thanks!

I love blue cheese but don't use dressing very often because i don't like store bought. This was good but i did as some others and put more sour cream than mayo. not a big mayo fan. I also left out worsh. sauce, I may try and find a vegetarian version and see what it adds to the flavor.Also i love blue cheese and avacado together so i think next time i make this i'm going to blend in an avacado before adding the crumbles. Thanks

Whoa! This stuff rocks my world! I usually make a half recipe for when I serve Blue Cheese lettuce wedges. I also use fat free sour cream to try and cut some calories. But whatever you do, don’t even bother with low fat mayo. It’s got too much sugar in it, and spoils a good thing. Using fat fee sour cream will make it really thick. All you have to do is thin it with some milk. Also, I never have dry mustard, so I just use a little tiny dab of prepared mustard. Thanks William. This is da bomb!

I followed other reviews and flip flopped the measurements for sour cream and mayo, and used the Treasure Cave blue cheese (memories of my grandmother!), and combined in my food processor until smoother.  This is excellent!!

My husband and daughter can't stop raving.  Hubby even mentioned he had quit eating blue cheese in restaurants many years ago as it was always too strong; that's not the case with this dressing.

Add a little Parmesan to make it reminiscent of the Coco's House Dressing -- yum!!  Thanks for sharing!!

I will definitely be making my blue cheese dressing from now on.  No more store bought.  My husband and I made this up to go with buffalo wings and it was unbelievable!!  Didn't even wait the 24 hours to try it.  Makes a good portion too.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

This is the best I have ever tasted.  Even my husband liked it.  So easy to make.  We have a local restaurant that makes their own dressing and this surpasses it.  I will definetly make this again!  Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.

I haven't had Blue Cheese Dressing since I was a kid...a LONG time ago...Bill's version was much better than what I remembered.  I made this as the sauce for Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza.  This dressing is outstanding!  I plan to use this recipe for chef salad type recipes as well.  Thank you for sharing this recipe; we enjoyed this very much.

This is UNREAL! I used a little less mayo than called for. I can't get over how good this was. I fixed this last night for my husband to dip his hot wings in and I don't know if he has ever come out of his trance yet! My hubby's name is Bill, and he wanted me to tell you Bill, thanks for the recipe!!!

Wonderful! I made a few adjustments though. I used white pepper so I wouldn't have black specks in the finished product. It was alittle salty so next time I will omit the salt and I doubled the blue cheese (just my preference.) I doubt that I will ever buy processed blue cheese dressing again. The longer it sits, the better it gets!!!!!!!!!!1

Excellent... I made a few changes:  reduced mayo to 1 cup (first time I made it hubby complained it tasted too much like mayo), added 1 T white wine vinegar, added a little milk prior to serving to thin it. I can't believe it's this easy to make the best blue cheese I've ever tasted!!

This dressing is so good!  I never buy the bottled stuff anyway, it's too blah, but I didn't have a great recipe.  I made this to go with a Paula Deen recipe for the "Hottest Chicken Wings".  Awesome recipe, and I'm so thankful it DOESN'T call for buttermilk, because I don't know anyone who has that on hand all the time (at least I don't!).  Great stuff!

If I could give this more than five stars, I would.  We made this to go with my husbands special chicken wings, along with three other blue cheese dressings, trying to find the perfect one.  This one won hands down among everyone who tried it.  What a fabulous recipe!!!!

This was sooo yummy!  The only change I made was that I did 1 cup of light sour cream and 1 cup of Hellman's Mayo.  I also added tons more blue cheese.  This was so yummy with boneless buffalo wings.

Friends gave my husband a 4 1/2 lbs wheel of Stilton cheese they hand carried back from England for his birthday and other than just enjoying the cheese with bread I was looking for some other way to use it. 
Wow! What a find this recipe is! It's really the perfect blue cheese dressing. The family is going to love it. Thanks for sharing Bill!

This was soooo good.  My husband is particular about his blue cheese dressing but he loved it.  I'll never buy bottled blue cheese dressing again.  We can't quit eating it.  Yummy.  A little salty but probably because I doubled the blue cheese.  I'll cut the salt a little next time.

This was the BEST blue cheese dressing I've ever had! I followed the recipe to the letter. The dressing barely made it to the salad. My husband and I ate a whole batch on salad during a single meal. Be still my thighs! Thanks, Bill! This is a definite keeper.

This is quite thick, so I added a touch of half & half to it, but that seemed to dilute the flavor more.  And it already seems like it needs more flavor of some kind...maybe more blue cheese flavor and/or a stronger garlic flavor (like from fresh minced garlic, rather than powdered?).  PS:  This did get better overnight; maybe it needs time for the flavors to meld together.

I took the advice of JeannieBeannie a few posts down, and equaled out the sour cream and mayo, since I don't like that "mayo taste".  This could indeed be the best bleu cheese dressing out there.  I've tested a few in the past week, and this one takes the honors.

Best blue cheese dressing I've ever enjoyed.  Very easy to make.  The 24 hour waiting period is important.  Stir a couple of times while waiting.

This was really good, though it was really thick and more like a dip than a dressing.

Some friends and I compete on who can make food/dressings better, and this tops the charts. It gets even better as it sits!!
Thank you for sharing - Greatly enjoyed!

SO GOOD! I will never buy blue cheese dressing again. Everyone that is looking for a goob blue cheese dressing recipe should try this one first. You can always thin a for the consistancy you desire. Also buy a high quality blue cheese. It is worth the extra you will spend. Thank you Bill!

Let me start off by saying that I do NOT like blue cheese dressing...period.  However, my hubby and mom do (and are quite picky about it...they don't like the bottled stuff), so I thought I would try this for them.  They will not stop bugging me to make it again, and again, and again....

Yes, it's good! Use as a dip or you will need to thin it to use as a salad dressing. Easy & delicious.

YES, it's as good as everyone says!  Scrumptious as a dip for Super Bowl Buffalo chicken wings, or just as a standard dip with chips & crackers.  Yum-yum-yum!!  If you like your dressing a touch thinner, just add a splash of buttermilk.  Excellent stuff.

Excellent.  I thinned it a little bit with  whole milk.  I think it is important to refrigerate 24 hours so don't skip this step.

i don't care for blue cheese but, I made this for a birthday party and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe and as someone suggested I used white worcestire sauce.  I'm sure I will make it again.

By far better than any pre-packaged blue cheese dressing I've ever tasted.  The "sit overnight" is an absolute must...we ate some right away and were tempted to throw the rest out...but boy were we glad we didn't!!!  It was so much better the next day.  It needed thinning with a little milk each time we used it, but it's by far the best blue cheese dressing you'll ever find!  Wish 10 stars was an option!

Short and sweet...this really is the best blue cheese dressing I have ever had!  I won't be able to make it often because of the fat content...oh, well.  It really is wonderful, though.

Fantastic recipe! Don't think I'll ever buy a store brand again! Original recipe defintely makes a large batch. I scaled it to 6 servings.

You gotta try this - the blue cheese dressing you crave!  Everyone I serve it to loves it, and people that claim they don't like blue cheese taste it and always end up saying they really like it!

Hi Bill,
This dressing is WONDERFUL! I wanted to say thanks for posting it here. I don't even like blue cheese and didn't think I'd like this, but I made it for my husband. I did use a food processor, so that the blue cheese would blend better. I LOVED IT! Thanks!
My kids liked it too, but didn't tell them it had blue cheese in it.

The best blue cheese dressing recipe I've ever made! My husband-who isn't a big salad eater-had a salad 3 days in a row! Maybe next time, I'll try it with minced garlic. This is so easy, I will keep some on hand all the time! Thanks, Bill, for sharing this with everyone!

great tasting dressing.  However, for my purposes, I would have liked the consistency to be a tad thinner.  Anyone have any suggestions?  I thought maybe some buttermilk in the future?

This is by far the BEST bleu cheese dressing.  Been making this exact recipe myself for years (came from my Uncle Dave -- I thought he originated it).  If you like bleu cheese - YOU'LL LOVE THIS!!!  Can be stinky though!  LOL

This was very easy to fix and tasted just great, even though I didn't let it sit for 24 hours, I was too hungry to wait! Of course kids hate blue cheese, but that gives them something to look forward to!

Wonderful taste! I rated it a for only because it was a tad too much mayonnaise and too thick.  I would’ve used a little less mayo and some buttermilk to thin it out.

I have made this recipe for years now! It’s our go to with every wing cook out and homemade potato chips. If any changes are needed, it’s doubling the amount of blue cheese. Way to go, Bill!!

I made this for Superbowl Sunday and everyone really enjoyed it.  I followed the recipe as written and the only problem I had was crumbling the blue cheese. May have been the type I bought. This is so much better than anything bottled!

I halved the recipe exactly because its just me and I didn't want to waste ingredients if it didn't turn out. Well I'm glad I did, really thick after I made it and the next morning I checked on it and was going to stir it, pure liquid... I strained  the blue cheese out of it and poured it down the drain.

Wonderful recipe! I love a thick chunky blue cheese dressing with lots of flavor, and this did not disappoint. I dont care for most dressings available in store, I prefer Bob's brand or Marie's if I buy it. This is so much better than store bought for dipping veggies or buffalo wings. For a basic green salad, you will want to toss the dressing in because it is so thick. After reading some of the reviews, I wasn't sure if this was going to work for me, but it was fabulous!

This recipe was fine as  written. I made it and tried the dressing, but for me, it needed a little more zip so I added some vinegar to taste. You cannot go wrong either way.

After reading negative reviews saying the mayo was overpowering, I made some changes and think I nailed it. 

Drop the mayo to a scant cup. 
Reduce the sour cream to 2/3 cup
Add in 1/4 C buttermilk and just a dash of worcestershire. I kept the mustard, garlic as directed, increased the pepper to taste. Make sure you add salt! Add pinches to your taste both before and after adding the cheese. 

I took about an ounce of the blue cheese and best it into the mayo sour cream mixture until almost smooth then folded in the rest crumbled and nto the refrigerator to meld flavours. Every few hours give it a stir. After 4 hours the flavors were spot on, it was even better the next day only needing a pinch of salt. 

Hope this helps!!

My wife and I love blue cheese but most commercial dressings leave us wanting.  Checked on Allrecipes and tried this one.  Outstanding!  I added more Worcestershire sauce. Our new found passion: homemade blue cheese dressing!

Cut back on mayo to 1-Cup (we use olive oil mayo too); 1-toe of minced fresh garlic and omitted the salt. This is OMG good... even before sitting 24-hrs.

This is one of those recipes that I made "by the book"...never changed a thing!!  It turned out to be great!!  I must add though... You will be tempted (as I was) to go ahead and try some on a wedge of lettuce without letting it set for 24 hrs.  You will not be disappointed BUT... You will taste each ingredient.  After the 24 hour wait the individual items blend together to form one of the best taste in blue cheese dressing I've ever found on this contenent....!!!

Tastes a bit salty if you eat it right away (which we always do) but mellows to absolutely perfect the next day. I will never have bottled blue cheese again! It’s delish!

Love this recipe.  I chose to make it because it didn't require buttermilk and I thought the Worcestershire Sauce was an interesting ingredient.  This is a keeper.

This is a phenomenal recipe. My whole household loves it— even the kiddos. It isn’t tangy and tart like some store bought/restaurant dressings can be. I have nothing negative to say about it at all. I do buy the wedge of blue cheese and chop it up myself. I prefer that to the already crumbled blue cheese. I find that it’s fresher like that.

This is amazing! This is my first comment on a recipe on Allrecipes.. I just can’t make this one more time without telling y’all to at least try it! Being Keto.. Bleu cheese dressing is a must make-yourself addition to the ketogenic way of eating (if you like Bleu cheese of course!) try it!

Oh.....my......goodness!!!  This bleu cheese dressing is the yummiest I have ever tasted!  I’d never made bleu cheese dressing with mayo, along with the abundance of other ingredients (i.e. dry mustard, garlic powder, etc).  I so luckily stumbled on to this recipe today, and it’s the best!

This is by far the best blue cheese I have had tasted. Hope you don’t mind Bill but I have shared you on Facebook. I used 1/3 the recipe cause this feeds a farm and I just need to feed a family. Thank you for sharing. And I hope you don’t mind me sharing (with proper credit of course)

The rating is based on the rave reviews I received.  I made the recipe to dress a garden salad.  Everyone loved it.  I ran out of mayo and did not have the 1/3 cup.  The dressing was thick enough to use as a dip.  This recipe works well when doubled.

Add a little more blue cheese. And more garlic. That way it’s quite flavorful. I am convinced that this recipe is very taste dependent.

This was absolutely delicious!! I was looking for a good BC and could not find one in the store so tonight I just decided to make one and boy oh boy is this one the bomb.com !! 100% recommend but I made it with 1 cup of  sour cream and mayo - got that hint from another review and yup - hit the spot ! Just enough - but mix to taste - and yes Worschester sauce - it works...  I will have to see how it is tomorrow but it was so good I couldn’t wait and had to eat some almost immediately .. I will say it did get thick so might have to cut it a little like another review said but either way if you are doubting making it - don’t / just make it and ENJOY

Disclosure: I do not measure when I cook. However, I used the ingredients Bill suggested and only added a green onion because I wanted to. Turned out fantastic. Plus I added half-and half to thin it just a bit.

This is REALLY good!  I used low-fat sour cream and egg-free mayo (Hellman's Vegan).  I was not able to let it sit for 24 hours (only about 30 minutes) and it was still very good.
We had leftover steak from the night before so I made a salad with the warmed beef, tomatoes, cucumbers, romaine and this dressing. I said to my husband this would be great on buffalo wings, he said "this would be great on anything!)

I have made this several times. The first time exactly as noted. I then tweaked it to my liking.  I halved the Worcestershire sauce and used garlic cloves into powder. This is an excellent recipe, definite keeper. The bottled stuff now tastes too artificial!!  Thank You for sharing and as always another great successful recipe from you !!

It is a totally great recipe, exactly as written. I have 7 Allrecipes recipes saved, and this is one of them. For sure, if you are uncomfortable about fat, don’t make it, but if you are looking for flavor, this is the real thing!

This is a fantastic dressing. I followed the advice of others and added slightly less mayo. My only substitution was using celery salt instead of regular salt. We absolutely love this.

As written this recipe is terrible. You do not taste anything except Worchestershire, which I like but this is too much and over powers all other flavors. If you want to waste your blue cheese go for it. Otherwise drink the W sauce from the bottle and save yourself some time and $. I would suggest you reduce the W sauce by at least half if you are going to attempt this.

I made & followed the recipe but it was so salty that it's inedible. Disappointed especially since no one said it was salty. Would adjust if made again with this recipe and wouldn't put in any salt. Heads up.

I've made this dozens of times for dipping with chicken wings or veggies and it's perfect.  For our tastes, it's a little thick for using as  a salad dressing so we thin it out with some milk or buttermilk before putting on our salads.  Soooooo goooood

(If you're fat conscious, you can replace sour cream and mayonnaise with non-fat yogurt.)

I like it with a slightly higher sour cream to mayo ratio, and with a good gorgonzola.  Aside from that it's perfect as is!

Very good dressing. Nice and thick. I added a quarter cup more sour cream to make it thicker. I think I will add fresh garlic to the next batch. Yum!

This is a wonderful dressing. I follow it to a T....other than I add a splash of  milk (regular) to thin it down a bit. This is the best Blue Cheese Dressing recipe I have ever tried (and I am snobbish when it comes to bc dressing)... My family raves.

I made a half recipe.  Although using only 1/2 C mayo.  I also used low fat sour cream and olive oil mayo.  The Worcestershire sauce was a little overwhelming.  I would make this again, but cut back on the Worcestershire sauce.

Followed the recipe exactly and it really is the best!  The only thing I would change is adding a bit of milk to make it thinner, like a dressing. I made this for buffalo cauliflower and it went well!  I will try something another person posted about pureeing some if the crumbles.  All in all -success!  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the directions exactly and it turned out excellent. I don't understand the one star reviews. Different taste buds I guess. But me and our guests loved it.

I will never buy the bottled stuff again! This was SOOO much better.  It's a little thick for salad dressing, but PERFECT for hot wings, sweet apple slices, carrots, celery, etc.  I would thin it a little with cream for a salad.  Deep, rich, and simply divine!

Relish! Put a little bit of smoked blue cheese in with the regular. Nice taste! Great for the biggest wing day of the year, Super Bowl Sunday.

This is what I would find in a good wing and pizza restaurant to use for dipping, lots of little chunks but creamy enough for a salad, good recipe. Only reason for not giving a full five star is author didn't list what kind of blue cheese to use or at least make a suggestion, there are different strengths to choose from but at least it will  be fun trying to find the right one. I just grabbed whatever was on shelf at grocery store, it was creamy and hard to crumble, weak in taste. Hard, crumbles easy and strong is the one to use next time.

Excellent as written. I cut it down to 6 servings and added 2Tbl. of milk as I wanted it a bit thinner. For those skeptical about the Worcester sauce,trust me,you can't taste it. The ingredients meld perfectly.

I made adjustments based on other reviews. I used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream. Did not add the salt and I also used a little buttermilk to help thin. I thought it taste best after 48 hours when the flavors meld together.

I made this the other day, and it wasn't bad at all. The recipe itself has good bones, but like some people know there are alway a few tweaks needed to make something fit your own specific tastes. Next time I'd follow the recipe, but  cut the garlic powder and worcestershire  sauce down to maybe 1/2 of what is called for. I'd possibly also add a small touch of milk to make it a little more runny, and definitely use a different blue cheese, because that can alter the taste drastically. (If you live in Norway, do not use Selbu..too salty, and not sharp enough.) For those complaining that the recipe had too much mayo, I also thought the same as well when I initially made it, but after it sat for 24 hours all the flavors blended quite nice and the mayo was not overwhelming. For those saying it came out runny, perhaps you didn't follow the recipe as it was called for, used lesser quality ingredients, or perhaps you tried to substitute ingredients (light mayo, light sour cream, or yogurt), all of which can alter the consistency of something.

We really liked the taste of this recipe. As some other reviewers mentioned, it did thin out over time; however, I am fairly certain it is because I used some low fat &/or fat-free ingredients. We will definitely make this again!

Made no changes.  Absolutely love it.  My husband says he hates blue cheese, but when I put this on a pizza crust for buffalo style pizza, he loved it!!   My college aged son thinks he dislikes blue cheese as well, but he loved the pizza! I myself, use it for dipping celery into.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I was looking for a good Bleu Cheese dressing recipe and thru the ones I reviewed I ended up here. I have tried store bought brands but wanted to make my own this time, this was the first time trying and I feel this was a good choice. I read the reviews and made some changes such as using 3/4 cup mayo and 8 ozs of sour cream, left out the Worcestershire sauce and used a 5 oz container of Bleu Cheese crumbles, I used my cake mixer to whip up and I did feel it was a little on the thick side so added buttermilk in tiny batches until it got to the consistency that I wanted, overall it turned out to be a hit

This is a bad  version of blue cheese dressing. It isn't sweet like that bottled . I got a really great chunk of blue cheese at Whole Foods that was delicious. I also used Just Mayo instead of a regular mayo. If you like hat  you buy at the store this may not be the dressing for you

I liked it, but I would reduce the Worcestershire sauce next time.  I noticed another reviewer recommended this and I wish I would have taken that advice.  While very good, the Worcestershire leaves a leave after taste.  Think it would be perfect to reduce.

have made it since the 70's.. some times I half the mayo and sour cream ratio and eye ball the Worcestershire. fresh garlic squeezed or chopped to paste gives the bite and I make sure the overnight happens to mellow.. I also use Roquefort and Gorgonzola... just depends on what i have on hand..   I leave it thick in a jar and it lasts much longer  I dislike the taste when lemon or vinegar is used. I think this was added for longer shelf (fridge) life and people became used to it.  when it's time to use I take what I need out and thin only what I plan on eating with a  bit of milk or cream or again what I have.. It's a great and versatile recipe.. Thanks for putting it in writing...

First time made it exactly as written. Delicious. Next time I found myself without sour cream. Aha, I just used whipping cream with a little Apple cider vinegar in it. It was even better! I don't add the salt.

I am a huge blue cheese anything fan and this simple, easy to make recipe is awesome. I used it because I couldn't find my recipe but I'm glad I did because this is a tasty, well-balanced dressing you can use on salads, veggies, burgers etc, use your imagination.

One word... DELISH! I generally can't follow a recipe to save my life but this one I pretty much did. Only change I made was leaving a bit of the cheese out to add in  at last  step to keep it chunky... I love me some chunky bleu cheese dressing and dip.  Great taste, great texture and I'm making some today in fact. I have company coming for the weekend and he's also a bleu cheese fan. I know he's gonna love it!  I put this stuff on anything and everything.  Not an all the time thing but what a great treat! When the batch is done, so am I. I'm so glad I get to make some today... *DROOL*

I cut down on the mayonnaise and used fresh garlic.  
I then placed in the refrigerator as per the recipe.  Initial taste test right after in was made and blended was it was good. 
My daughter is the real "taste tester" hopefully she will want me to make this again.  This was so easy

My son said this was even better than California Pizza Kitchen's dressing! I did use 1 c. Each of light sour cream and Hellman's mayonnaise. ( don't even try it w/ miracle whip! Yuck!) Also, used 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder and the Treasure cove blue cheese. Everything else e same. Awesome dressing and gets better as the days go by!

Made it and ate it.  Had no time to wait.  Enjoyed it very much though I had to increase the sour cream amount to counter the mayo taste - just a little too much for me. When I make it again I'll just reverse the amounts.  It was great to have this to go with a Cobb Salad that I decided at the last minute to make for dinner.

Using a creamier blue cheese really helps to diffuse the blue cheese flavor throughout the dressing. I can't say this is the best blue cheese dressing I've ever had, but I can hardly think of others that were better, and I can think of many that were worse.

This is really good, I don't think we will ever buy bottled Blue Cheese Dressing again. This was simple to make, taste great, right after you mix it all up and I don't see how it could get any better after 24 hours, but we will see. Just try it!!

We really enjoyed this recipe just as it is written.  Mine ended up very thick because I used homemade sourcream that is nearly as firm as a block of cream cheese.  I used regular Castello Danish Bleu Cheese crumbles from Safeway and the flavor of it was very up front and pleasant.  It is important to let it set to allow the flavors to develop.  This is especially true if you use powdered garlic instead of fresh. I use Real Mayo, not strong flavored mayo like olive oil mayo or Kraft Mayonnaise (which is salad dressing and has a completely different flavor and consistency). or you will only taste the vinegary sweet salad dressing. This did not taste like bottled dressing at all.  Those taste extremely vinegary to me. This is pleasantly mild and the primary flavors are a bit salty with garlic and bleu cheese as the main flavors.  It was served alongside Honey Chipotle wings and was a hit with my husband.  I was in a rush, but next time I will use fresh garlic in place of powdered.  Other than that, no changes.

I have made this for years and I literally finger taste it as it's being made as I adjust some of the ingredients to suit my taste. And here's the kicker... Singularly,  I HATE Mayo and Sour Cream, but something magically happens when combined in this recipe. It's probably psychosomatic on my part, but this is truly the ONLY time I will eat Mayo and/or Sour Cream.  Bill, you have a winner here brother. 
Now, here's my changes: use fresh ground peppercorn and add a bit more. Absolute perfection! You're welcome.

This was a great recipe.  Only changes I made:  used about 1 cup of mayo instead of 1 and 1/3 cups, added 1 tsp. onion powder, and added maybe 1/3 cup of milk just to thin it a little.  I read how some felt the mayo was overpowering...I can't imagine this unless people have not let it set for awhile for the bleu cheese to assimilate into the mayo/sour cream mixture.  This will be my go to bleu cheese dressing recipe from now on!

Excellent.  Very rich and thick, but not overwhelming.  I used gorgonzola so the flavor wasn't quite as sharp as a deep blue might have been.  it was a hit.

Best Blue Cheese Dip Ever!!!

I've used this for years, by far my favorite dip ever.  I've considered bringing it to a restaurant as I like it 100x better than most others.

One change I've added over the years (buddy's idea), I add enough poppy seeds so that you can see black seeds throughout.  It makes a 5 star + recipe even better!

My go-to, and I registered so I could post this.  I do change a couple of things -- I use one cup each of mayo and sour cream, so I can get two batches out of a tub of sour cream (the dressing disappears before the sour cream expires), and I pump the blue cheese up to about 6oz. because I like it punchy.  Great, simple recipe, thanks!

I made this recipe 24 hours before and left it in the fridge. I changed it up by using equal parts mayo and sour cream (1 cup each) and deleting the Worcestershire. I also substituted prepared mustard for dry (oops!) and added about 1.5 ounces more blue cheese than the recipe called for. It came out very thick and very tasty. But incredibly rich. I may have gone overboard on the blue cheese (oops again.) But I want to address the issue some people have on the flavor and the texture. The recipe calls for blue cheese "crumbled." I'm wondering if people who are using crumbles are having issues. Cheese that comes already grated or crumbled has an additive that affects the flavor of the cheese. The wax-like substance coats the cheese and prevents you from getting the full flavor. I'm also wondering if this additive makes the dip turn runny as some people have noted. For me, I only use the brick cheese and mash it up by hand. I would make this recipe again, but I would use the amount of blue cheese called for instead of being lazy and throwing in the whole package. I might add a little lemon...

I make this quite often because it tastes so good. I could eat this straight from the bowl like soup! It does not have the "chemical" taste of the bottled brands. I skip adding salt, and often add extra bleu cheese crumbles only because the bulk packages at the surplus store are of varying weights. I use only Hellman's real mayo for best results. Sometimes I thin out individual servings with a few sprays of white vinegar from a spray bottle or with milk. But most often I serve as is: super thick. I haven't bought bottled bleu cheese since I came across this recipe.

Easy and pretty much the way I made it trying to figure out the ingredients in Marie's Blue Cheese.  I use reduced fat sour cream and Canola mayo and it's great.  That way it's more for the "kind of" fat conscious.

1/2 cup Sour Cream, 1 cup mayo (Hellman's gives it the flavor, 1 cup or less), 1/2 TSP Dry Mustard, splash of Worcestershire, bleu cheese, garlic powder, to taste, the pepper and the salt. Pinch of white sugar. If it too think add buttermilk but just a little to loosen it up. Add more chesses as you feel it is needed. Still missing one ingredient and I have no idea what it is, but its close!  Good Luck!

I followed this recipe to the letter. I really wanted it to work as I am a big blue cheese dressing fan. After refrigerating it for 24 hours it came out to the consistency of 1% milk. I see that only a few other people of had this problem. I understand that most people thought it was too creamy or thick. That did not happen to me. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I might've did wrong? It doesn't appear to  be rocket science  so obviously I must've made a major mistake. thank you so much.

This is a fine recipe.  I was out of ground mustard.  Just a small squirt of yellow and I was in business.  Restaurant quality.

Personally, I think this recipe is absolutely awesome.  I've made it numerous times with virtually no other changes than a splash of milk if I'm in the mood.  Yes, a very thick BC dressing...... as it should be.  IMO Bleu Cheese Dressing SHOULD be thick, not the thin runny dressing you see in many restaurants.  I love the flavor the seasonings give it, Worcestershire sauce and all!

Awesome recipe. I thought the garlic powder and Worcester added a unique backbone of flavor. I did however make one change out of necessity. No sour cream in the fridge  so I substituted it for heavy cream, which I presume made it a bit more fluid like. Delicious. I love blue cheese dressing and this is my new favorite.

This is our new favorite bleu cheese dressing.  We used it on grilled steak and on hot buffalo wings (with celery too, of course) and it was just perfect.  It has a great flavor and is plenty thick.  We will not be buying any more bottled bleu cheese dressing since this is now the flavor we crave.  Thank you, William, for sharing this recipe.

This was good, but it had too much mayo for me. I used it for a buffalo style chicken pizza recipe that I found on here, and the mayo was STILL overwhelming it all. I think next time I make this, I'd use equal amounts of mayo and sour cream...MAYBE a cup of mayo, max. Otherwise, it was great, and I don't even like blue cheese!

This is the restaurant quality blue cheese dip/dressing that I was looking for.  It comes out very thick.  Great for dipping with buffalo chicken or celery sticks.  I cut back on the mayo after reading other reviews bc I don't like too much mayo flavor.  This one is a keeper.

I let my wife buy the ingredients at Safeway, and she does not have the same taste in blue cheese that I do.  She got some whitebread blue cheese that had almost no blue in it at all.  When I opened the container there wasn't much to smell either.  Litehouse or something like that.  Fortunately, I had a 4oz tub of blue that brought the stank, and that fixed the dressing for the most part.  I made it per the recipe first and found it very bland and uninteresting.  I would have sent it back in a restaurant.  Or dipped my fries in it.  With an additional 4oz of stanky blue it was great.  Then I added a half tsp of onion powder and really didn't find much of a difference.  It's not a BAD recipe, but I would definitely cut back the mayo to half a cup instead of 1 1/3 cups.  It's probably as good as any commercially prepared blue cheese dressings as-is, but that's not really a ringing endorsement, innit.

Use 1 part sour cream to 1/2 part mayo. Use garlic salt not powder and then omit using any table salt. Use some white sugar to offset the zing of the worstershire sauce.  Mandatory to refrigerate for several hours!!

While I readily admit that I reduced the yield of the recipe, I stayed to the original proportions and ingredients.  It is not bad, in fact, it is better than most.  It is lacking something, but I'm not certain what it might be.  I suspect it may be a touch of buttermilk, but I'm not certain.  It is still a very good dressing when you have a craving for it.

I made this for the first time a month ago and sadly, I just ran out. It is the best homemade blue cheese dressing I've ever had. I can't for the life of me figure out what several people seem to think is missing. I don't think it is too mayonaisey and you can't taste the Worcestershire. The only thing to me is I will thin it down a tad, but not much. The flavors are divine and I am gonna buy some more cheese tonight so I can make some more. This is a must have in my fridge now. Thanks for an awesome recipe

This was awesome!!! My husband doesn't usually care about blue cheese dressing (always has Dorothy Lynch/French), but he raved about this. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand.

I have not been a Bleu Cheese fan. Now I am.  My wife wanted a steak salad for dinner tonight. Butter Lettuce, Napa Cabbage, red pepper, carrot, cucumber, Fresh tomato and little red potato slices grilled along with the steak. Top it off with this dressing it's 5 star! We wanted to try and recapture her favorite salad from a top restaurant.

It Turned out far Better because of this homemade dressing!

Have quite a bit of dressing left over, now it can meld the flavors as I only let it sit and chill for 3 hours for my steak salad.

Taking it and some wings to grill to a friends house this weekend. They will be blown away with this great wing dip!

Thanks!

Not the best tasting BC dressing.  I reduced the amount of mayo as others suggested and could still taste a little mayo, not overpowering with reduced amount but I can see where others write that it was just too much mayo tasting.  My beef is with the runny look/taste of it after just a couple days in the fridge, so I added some sour creme for added density, didn't really work, and adding more mayo would've just ruined it entirely.  I did use it as a vegetable dip and for that I guess it's ok at best, but definitely too runny to put on a salad.

I made this recipe and it was delicious. However when I made it the 2nd time I used a little less sour cram and added about 1/4 cup of buttermilk and that was just as nummy.

The first time I made this, I followed the directions exactly and it was awesome.  Everyone loved it.  Due to difficulty in obtaining sour cream (I live in China) had to make some modifications to this recipe...
1) 1 cup milk instead of sour cream as it's not available here
2) white pepper instead of black
3) reduced the mayo to 1 cup
After refrigeration overnight, it was thick, but not as thick as the original.  I will use sour cream when I can get it, but this is a good alternative.

I think this is excellent. Mild and fresh. Not overpowering at all. Husband is not a blue cheese fan and he enjoyed his salad. I think he thought it was ranch, honestly. You can do whatever you want with it...thin it with milk, add dill, lemon zest or whatever floats your boat. Fresh and versatile.

This is my GO-TO recipe for blue cheese dressing!  It's amazing!  I have made it as-written, and I have made it with my own tweaks.  Typically, I will add a little onion powder, chives, dijon mustard and a little cayenne.  I LOVE IT!  Cannot say enough good about it!

**I made this again recently and I still love it just as much as I did the first 359 times I made it.  I sifted through the reviews tonight out of curiosity and boredom.  I must say that the low-point reviews are so amusing and extremely transparent; transparent in the regard that if it tastes too Mayonnaisse-y, you did NOT let it sit in the fridge overnight before serving.  Do us all a favor please... If you can't follow the recipe instructions, don't put in a review.  It's not fair to those who do follow directions, to the recipe submitter, nor to the readers who have not yet tried the recipe.   It's not a truly accurate review if you haven't followed the instructions.  In this recipe, the instructions matter!!! You cannot take shortcuts on refrigeration-sit time and expect the same results as if you hadn't.  Stop being a**holes and either do it right or don't review it. Period.  

This dressing/dip is absolutely divine!!! Thank you Bill!

I was leary about trying to make this but I am very impressed with how it turned out. I didn't have dry mustard but substituted about 1 tsp of regular yellow mustard. For the garlic powder, I used 1/4 tsp of it and 1/4 tsp of onion powder. It turned out amazing. I served it on a wedge salad with crumbled blue cheese, some red onion and bacon bits. My boyfriend said its his new favorite salad!

This is a great dressing. If you mix by hand, it does need to sit in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours after you make it or it will have too much of a mayonnaise taste. If I use my food processor to mix it, I can usually eat it right away without the mayonnaise overpowering. I use it for a vegetable dip and if I am going to use it for dressing I add some milk to it and it works great. My family can not have worchestershire sauce due to dietary restrictions, so I use the same amount of lite soy sauce instead and it works great.

Awesome and easy to make dressing... We thinned it out with a VERY little bit of skin milk to make it a little smoother. Also, 4 oz of blue cheese is about 1 cup.

I really liked this dressing. I followed the recipe exactly, and, while I like the flavor, I think the mayonnaise is a little overpowering. That said, I'll make this again and play around with the proportions until I get it how I like it. (I used this on a burger, and it tasted great as is! As a salad dressing, I'll cut down on the mayo.)

Try 1/2 and 1/2 buttermilk and sour cream adding a couple of tablespoons of REGULAR mayo.  1tbsp lime juice would be OK.

Amazingly good. I did double the garlic and black pepper. I put in a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce instead of a teaspoon and left out the salt but in our household we like things spicey. Enjoy!

Amazing, sooooo good. Makes a lot, about 3 cups. The only thing i did different was I threw it in the blender with a splash of water to make it smooth and the chunks tiny. I had tried to hand crumble it, but it was still too large for my liking. Also used low fat sour cream and mayo... still amazing

This is an outstanding blue cheese dressing, as is. I've made it a number of times for family gatherings and everyone raves about it. I've made it in strict adherence to the recipe, but I've also made a few tweaks on accident and with great success.

I was out of dry mustard so used a mild dijon; I used 1 tablespoon. I also doubled the amount of Worcestershire sauce. Additionally, I used the refrigerated, chopped garlic in water. I used the equivalent of 1 glove of garlic plus add just a bit of garlic water. All of these changed thin out the dressing a bit, plus adds a smidge of acid to the mix.

The problem I had with this recipe might be that I didn't use high quality blue cheese.  After adding double the amount of cheese called for, I achieved the flavor I expect from a blue cheese dressing.

blue cheese dressing can NEVER be too thick.  This is awesome and I have made it twice this week.  I add a bit extra crumbles because I love the flavor.  Great for  wings too as it has "sticking power"

This 'dressing' is SO delicious!  It is far too thick to be considered a dressing the way it is written, so I only have it 4 stars.  After refrigerating it for 24 hours, it is more of a dip than a dressing.  I plan to add a little milk or buttermilk to it to thin it out for salads.  It really is a great recipe!

I added a bit of onion flakes and used Grey Poupon instead of dry mustard. My family loves it. I used Bel Gioioso Crumbly Gorgonzola cheese from Denmark.

With my modifications I would give it five stars.  The amount of mayonnaise seemed way too much, so I cut it in half and substituted and equal amount of softened cream cheese. I then used my mixer to beat the mayo, sour cream, cream cheese and spices together.  I added 1/2 teaspoon onion powder and did not add any worcestershire sauce, I just didn't feel this was the place for it.  It still tasted a little too much like mayo, so I added a teaspoon of white vinegar.  I then stirred in the blue cheese (6oz).  Refridgerated for three hours.  Fantastic!  Much better than store bought.

I LOVE this dressing.  Use a good quality blue cheese (I use Maytag)...don't buy the already crumbled....and you won't even notice the mayo.  I've been searching for great blue cheese dressing, and this is it!  Also, be sure to let the dressing blend for 24 hours.  It's so simple and uses ingredients that I usually have on hand.  Delicious!

This is the best blue cheese dressing I've made. The base recipe doesn't require many changes. I increased the spices to my taste, added the juice from half a lemon and increased the blue cheese. This doesn't really need salt since there's cheese. Use a good quality cheese for this one...it makes all the difference.

This recipe was fantastic. I admit, we were wondering "Hey, where's the buttermilk?". We had no Worcestershire sauce, so we substituted in soy sauce (at my request, I love soy sauce). We were too excited to let the dressing sit for 24 hours, and it initially tasted way too Mayonnaise-y. So we added a tiny bit of the heavy cream we had on hand, and added a lot more pepper. It was truly fantastic the next day.  Next time, I will: reduce the Mayo to about 2/3 cup, I'd add about 2/3 cup buttermilk, increase the amount of pepper, and most definitely increase the amount of the super-high-quality Roquefort we used!

Our bleu cheese lovin' family thinks this is the best dressing there is.  I always get requests for it, and I always double it, because it goes so fast.    (We are also a mayonnaise loving family, so the amount of mayo doesn't frighten us).    Yes, this is a thick bleu cheese recipe...as good bleu cheese dressing should be. I, too, use the Treasure Cave bleu cheese crumbles, and I just use the whole 5 oz container (actually two, since I double it).  We think the recipe is perfect the way it is.

Even folks who claim to not like blue cheese dressing have been loving this, it's so much better than anythingin a bottle or jar.  Delicious, whips up in a flash but certainly improves as it sits.  I liked the addition of a bit of fresh lemon, but I think if I'd used a crisper blue it would have been great as is.  You must like the taste of mayo to enjoy - next time I'll try it with homemade mayo too.  My favorite recipes are also the ones that I want to modify for different settings, and this one will be great for tweaking.  Yummy!

Pretty good.  Creamy and thick just like I like it but it still tastes a little too mayonaisey (I probably misspelled that) to me.  Maybe if I try it with a different blue cheese that taste I'm looking for will come through a little more.

great recipe.  i get grossed out by jarred mayo so i made my own with greek olive oil.  i used about 1 cup sour cream to 1/2 cup homemade mayo then added some 1/2 and 1/2 to get the right consistency.  not sure why the previous poster complained about the heavy worcestershire taste and brown color because mine came out perfect and white. maybe he didn't let the flavors blend long enough...  thank's bill!

I hate to burst anyone's bubble, but this recipe is exactly the same as the Charthouse Restaurant's.  Like Gulliver's, the Charthouse used to give out recipe cards with this and a couple other of their customer favorites.  It is killer, but not an original recipe and should be labeled as Charthouse's recipe.

Not bad as far as flavor goes.  I had to use half miracle whip because I ran out of mayo and added a splash of cider vinegar.

Amazingly YUMMY!!!!! We did not have a chance to let it set for 24 hours. We gave it only 30 mins till we "dived" in for some yumminess. We added more pepper and a little more garlic too.

I wish I'd found this recipe years ago--it really is the best!  I agree with some of the reviewers who say it is a bit thick and more like a dip. I have substituted buttermilk for some of the mayo which thins it quite a bit.

I don't like blue cheese dressing at all, but my husband and son love it. This was pretty good according to them, but nothing that WOW!ed them. I'll probably make this again, but I'll keep looking for just the right one. UPDATE Okay I am upgrading this recipe to 5 stars because after making it again and again, my husband says he loves it-the only thing I've done different is I add a liitle bit of balsamic vinegar. I guess that gave it a little more bite. Thanks!!

I started making this dressing a few years ago when I first came across this website. My husband said he would never eat bottled dressing again after trying it. My oldest son would only eat salad if I made this dressing, and my MIL asks me to bring some for every holiday occasion at her house. It is a bit thick but I'm still giving it 5 stars because everyone loves it. I've also subbed out the Blue Cheese for Feta and make potato salad with it.

This is easily a 5/5 star recipe. For those rating it ANY lower I would have to ask, 'did you follow the directions?' My husband and I are BIG hot wing fans and I frequently have to kill the burn with the blue cheese dip/dressing, so if anyone can appreciate a good blue cheese I certainly can. We served this at a super bowl get togther today, and before the game had even started everyone had weighed in and this recipe is KILLER!!! 5 stars all the way. Thanks!!

I for one am not a big fan of Blue Cheese Dressing. I'm very greatful for this recipe because of the simplicity and convenience of needing a little bit of dressing for recipes that you can't do without.

This is a great recipe that I can't seem to screw up.  Once I substituted an entirely different stinky wedge cheese that I happened to have in the fridge.  I finely shredded it, and it was fantastical.  Another time I used cottage cheese instead of sour cream out of sheer laziness.  Gross, right?  No!  YUM!  Of course, it is also very good if you just follow the recipe like a normal human being...

This recipe is awesome.  I changed it up a bit, I only used 1/2 tsp of worcestershire, I used 1/2 tsp of Lawrys seasoned salt in place of salt and I used 6 ounces of crumbled blue cheese instead of 4!  I have finally found the Blue Cheese Dressing recipe I've been trying to find for years!

This is THE BEST blue cheese dressing.  It has the perfect balance of ingredients.  It tastes like the kind you get in a restaurant.  For those of you who had the dressing turn thin after a day, don't use low fat ingredients.  That is the only reason that it gets runny.  Yes, this has a lot of calories, but a little goes a long way.

Perfect - the Worcestershire sauce added the perfect tang - I had a larger pkg of blue cheese, so I just added to taste (difficult to measure out ounces)

This is wonderful!  My husband and I both love blue cheese dressing a little more on the tart side, so I added 1 teaspon of red wine vinegar for that extra zip.  I'll never buy store bought blue cheese dressing again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe and I added 1/3 lemon squeezed and also reduced ingredients to a servign for 3 (since that's all the blue cheese I had on hand).  As they say in Hawaii "onolicious"

I can envision a dollop of this on steaks and hamburgers and it will probably be a staple in my refrigerator!

Really very good.  I followed advice of others and did my sour cream and mayonnaise in equal portions.  It came out very thick - good for a dip.  But I'll add milk to thin it more for a suitable salad dressing.

This is awesome dressing!! Having said that..let me tell you how I "messed" it up, LOL.
I used fat free sour cream and reduced fat mayo trying to be healthier. It tastes great, but it's actually too thin..almost runny after 1 night in the fridge. 
Moral of the story here is go with the full fat sour ceam and mayo, lol. I don't know why fat free stuff makes it runny..but it does.

I'm eating it anyway..it's just too darn tasty not too, lol.

I love this dressing! Lettuce has become an excuse to eat the dressing! I substituted yogurt for half the mayo and it is still rich and so creamy.

Oh my God!  I couldn't believe Blue cheese can taste this good-  I made it and used it on the buffalo style chicken pizza on this site- I have never tasted pizza this good.  It tasted like something out of a gourmet store.  Thanks so much Bill

Definitely best once the flavors meld. I also add I quick splash or two of Tabasco or hot pepper sauce, it just enhances the flavor doesn't really make it spicy.

oh my gosh!  this blue cheese dressing is beyond amazing.  i wish i could rate it 100 stars.  my husband and i love blue cheese dressing and we both thought this was much, much better than store bought...and better than any we've had at restaurants.  we used it for salad dressing and dip.  the only change to the recipe i made was adding more blue cheese crumbles.  yummy!

YUMM YUMM YUMM!  I used light sour cream which is not as thick so helps to thin it out a bit without altering flavor.  I also used gorganzola cheese which is a mild blue cheese, I LOVE blue cheese so I would add more next time. I ate this with celery before letting it sit and it was fabulous, can't wait to try it again after its been in the fridge for a few hours.

This is an excellent blue cheese dressing recipe.  Very easy to make.  I didn't use the dry mustard simply because I didn't have any on hand, but still very delicious anyway.  Much, much better than ANY bottled variety.

GREAT recipe. Definitely best after it has sat 24 hours. (Too early and it isn't nearly as flavorful.) I love a blue cheese dressing that has a strong blue cheese flavor, so I will add more cheese next time. I will definitely make this again!

I served this immediately after making in since I didn't prepare it ahead of time of my dinner and it was still very tasty. I can only imagine how much better it would be if the flavors had time to blend together.

Even my picky husband liked it, and he typically does not like white colored dressing.

I hate to sound like a broken record....but this was Great!!!!. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, so I used beer instead. I like garlic so I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. Thank you for posting this recipe.

My husband is a HUGE Blue Cheese Lover and very picky about what he considers to be "good". I made this the other night and he LOVED it! I have a feeling I will be making this often. I did add more blue cheese as well as fresh minced garlic. Delicious and super easy. Sure to delight any Blue Cheese Lover! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I've been making this for a couple of years now, and in the beginning I made a mistake by using one tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, I corrected it to one teaspoon and ever since this has been the best!!! Hands Down! It's the only way I'll eat salad. Thanks for sharing Bill.

This past Saturday I went to the downtown Farmer's Market & purchased some fresh Maytag blue cheese (from Newton, IA) -- & my husband says "If you're going to make it fresh, this is the only way to go."  It's so popular, most grocers carry the name brand.  Great blue cheese comes from happy-grazing Iowa cows!.

THIS IS A DIP! But it's amazing and you should make it..You can make it work with a salad, but it's THICK. Thin it with some milk if you want or use it as-is. But a keeper for sure!

Once a week is chicken wing night and we always run out of the blue cheese (even when we ask for extra).  I was looking for a recipe that was as good as the blue cheese we get with the wings and I found it with this recipe. Very, very good.

The best blue cheese dressing I have ever tried. I added more blue cheese for a more robust flavor.

Absolutely delicious!  I am very finicky about my blue cheese dressing.  I can't stand commercial bottled blue cheese dressing, and hate it when I get one at a restaurant.  Now, everything pales in comparison to this dressing.  I make it exactly according to the directions, store it in an old mayo jar, and it will keep in the fridge for about a month.  I'm never without some now.  Thanks Bill!

Awesome recipe!  I made this to go with wings for a Super Bowl party and everyone loved it.  Thick and chunky it was also amazing with veggies to dip.  I will definetly make this recipe whenever I feel like Blue Cheese Dressing.
