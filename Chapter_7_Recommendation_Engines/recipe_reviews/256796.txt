I made a partial batch of this using a spicy sweet beef jerky.  We all thought this one was really good and would make again.   I think the jerky got a little chewy in a weird way, but the taste made up for it.  It's not a very pretty dip, so you need to have people try it to see what they think---then they'll go for it!  Thanks, McCormick!

This was just okay for me. I like the jerky part but the dip itself seemed pretty flat and one dimensional.   I think the leftovers would be able to be doctored up for my taste but as is  this is not a favorite.  I did use a chicken jerky instead of beef... which was fine.. I just didnt  care for the dip part
