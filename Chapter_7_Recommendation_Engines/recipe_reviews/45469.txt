I really wanted to love this.   It sounds so good and good for me.   But it was just OK.   Reminded me too much of a bean tostada.   Couldn't tell the mushrooms were even in it.   I think I'd try again and not put the mushrooms in the processor.  Also add some freah spinach and onions maybe.   The sauce looked like refried beans.   Maybe leave the tomatoes chunkier?   i liked it enough to keep fooling around with it.   Thanks for posting.
