These little appetizers are awesome! I used my canned pickled jalapeño peppers spread the cheese mixture on a whole slice of bread and then cut into triangles after baking. Great finger food and so very easy to make. COOKINCOWGIRLS this one's a keeper!

I totally agree with lutzflcat...these little things are awesome! Not too hot or too spicy but with loads of flavor. I used some jarred jalapeños but removed the seeds and membrane. I'm sure if you wanted them hotter you could leave those in. I used Frank's redhot sauce because it's what I had and would use it again. I precut my bread in heart shapes for a Valentine appy.
