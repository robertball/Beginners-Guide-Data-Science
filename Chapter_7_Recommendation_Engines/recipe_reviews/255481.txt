This turned out so much better than I expected. I used all white button mushrooms as that is all I had and lentils instead of beans (again that's what was in the cupboard). It was moist and very flavourful. My 4 yr old ate it up and I had leftovers for lunch the next day. It was good hot or cold. I will definitely make it again!

Loved the idea of this loaf.  I did use 2 1/2 lbs of baby bella mushrooms instead just based on cost although I think 2lbs would have been enough and easier to cook off.  The loaf was moist and held together.  I served it with a lemon yogurt sauce for brightness and moisture.
