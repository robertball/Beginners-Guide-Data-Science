Can I give this 7 or 8 stars?  This.  Is.  AMAZING!  I made it once as is, and it was so awesome my meat-loving family insisted it go on rotation, even though it was veggie.  Second time I made it, I started playing.  Added strips of red bell pepper, sliced onion.  Both times, I used tomato juice instead of broth, and added a splash of balsamic vinegar and some Italian seasoning in with the oil.  Still excellent.  Would be good with grilled chicken, if you can't live without the meat. Quick, easy, delicious.   I'm making it again tonight!!!

I've been making this for years. The only change I make is I cook the tomatoes on the stove top. It is delicious, quick and light.

Very yummy recipe. Next time I will use a lot more cherry tomatoes and add even more basil. I cooked the cherry tomatoes, olive oil, garlic mix on the stove top since its the middle of summer right now and running the oven isn't worth it. Came out beautifully and is much quicker. Everyone ate up the dish quickly and my husband was asking for more but my daughter had already cleaned out the serving bowl.

This was a very good, light meal. I loved the fresh basil and cherry tomatoes. I only had a small package available, and I don't think it was 10 oz. I would have at least doubled it. They were lost in the angel hair pasta. Would definitely make again.

This is one of the weirdest receipe I've tries on this site, but it was amazingly good.  First I looked at the pasta in the pot, and thought what is my wife going to eat?, so I doubled it, next time, and there will be a next time I'll double everything, we just love this.  Thank you for this recipe

GOOD EASY. Really good and fast to put together.
A great way to use up some ripening cherry tomatoes.
Does have a light fresh feel. I did go  the parmesan cheese
way, but I think it would also be great with feta and olives.

Super easy and delicious. I roasted both garden fresh cherry and grape tomatoes and one coarsely chopped onion. I recommend using just cherry tomatoes since they were sweeter and produced more juice than the grape. I did add a small amount of pasta water along with 1/2 cup chicken broth. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Yum!

This was delicious, easy to make, and healthy. I added mushrooms and chopped artichoke hearts which added more flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Oven-roasted cherry tomatoes are spectacular on pasta!  One of the easiest gourmet meals I have ever made.  Now I make extra roasted tomatoes and store in fridge in glass jars like a compote and use on other dishes: omelettes, veggie stir fry, beans and rice dishes, you name it.   Takes everything to a new level!

I made according to directions.  I was concerned there would not be much flavor but it was just right for a hot summer evening with a glass of chilled wine. Nice and light.  I can always add more basil or garlic if I want a stronger flavor.  Very easy to prepare.

Nice recipe, and I'm not even a big fan of fresh tomatoes, usually only eat them in sandwiches or salads. Left out the Parmesan, which I dislike (I know, I know..), and added a little balsamic at the end. I also used quite a bit more basil than 3 leaves. This recipe even nuked fairly well for lunch at work the next day, though I wouldn't try to push it any longer than that. I'd suggest 10 ounces worth of tomatoes as only 1 or two servings' worth though, unless you're a light eater or accustomed to vegan or vegetarian cooking. Very quick and easy to put together.

I  have made this several times - as a side dish for my meat eating family and as a main dish for a vegetarian friend. I followed the recipe but did add more garlic and basil I have made this in the oven and it was delicious .  The oven method intensifies the tomato flavor.  As another reviewer suggested I made the tomato mixture on the stove and it was very good as well. A home run!! Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful flavor. Next time I will reduce quantity of pasta in relation to tomato mixture and will add Italian sausage either on the side or sliced in the sauce. Will definitely make again. Also, not labor intensive.

Pretty darn good as written but we've tweaked to add chopped onions & mushrooms along with the fresh tomatoes & garlic and then (oh, boy) add pesto and Parmesan.  Keep it a stove top recipe for ease and then don't have to heat up oven in summer.  Also like to break the spaghetti noodles into small pieces before cooking as it really helps to get a mouthful of everything with each bite.   We eat a lot of this in summer and will also add fresh Tarragon from the garden along with the Basil!

I made it as is.  Not much liquid to put into the skillet in the end.  More tomatoes might have made it better.  It still tasted very good, like a warm pasta salad.  It was a good side dish.

Even after reading all the raving reviews I thought this recipe would just be "meh".........was I ever wrong!!!!  I roasted my cherry tomatoes to the point of the juices caramelizing which added more depth to the flavor.   I was amazed at how delicious this was!!!   I have a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes in my garden and now have something to do with them!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I was a little skeptical that a recipe with so few ingredients could have a five star rating.  I had so many cherry tomatoes in my garden that I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did!   This is delish!   I doubled the recipe and have made it twice in two days - it's that good!

Excellent! Made exactly to recipe ingredients ... BUT doubled it (feeding a family of 4). I was truly surprised by amount of flavor despite few ingredients. Oven roasting tomatoes/garlic is key. Thank you for this delicious, easy meal!

A very good meatless meat sauce. I used more cherry tomatoes and roasted them at 400 for about an hour. And I froze the sauce before adding the cheese

I was looking for something to use up the tomatoes in my garden. This was perfect! I did my tomatoes on the stove top. This was yummy. I also added some Feta cheese on mine.  My son liked it and I ended up making two days in a row.

I was short on the cherry tomatoes, so I used a small tomato and I chopped it to the size  of the cherry tomatoes. For my liquid are used wine. Zucchini was used  for the  Pasta .It was one of the best  dishes I have made using the zucchini pasta.

This tasted sooo good!!  The cherry tomatoes cook down a lot, as expected, and since I had a limited quantity from my garden, I cubed some zucchini I had on hand and roasted those a little and added to the tomatoes and basil.  I also roasted a spaghetti squash and used as my base, for a gluten free/grain free dinner.  Delicious!

Actually I didn't really follow this recipe fully.  I took the idea because I have a lot of cherry tomatoes in my garden to use up.  I did bake the tomatoes for about 10 min.  I didn't want them to mushy.  I fried up some garlic in olive oil and then added the cooked pasta, then tossed to coat.  I then added the tomatoes and basil, salt and pepper and then tossed with the parmesan cheese .  Put it onto a plate then sprinkled some more parmesan on top and a few shakes of the pepper flakes.  Turned out nice.

I make this all the time.  :)  I also like to add feta cheese and fresh chives...sometimes add chopped pepperoni (substitute cheese and pepperoni for salt.  Amounts should be to taste, salt wise).  Yum!

This is a wonderful dish.  I as well cook this on stove top. Easy to make and easy to add to.  Try a little shrimp, scallops or whatever fish you may have on hand.  Nutritious, tasty meal.  I've made this for years with a little added celery, lemon juice, and ginger root finely chopped.  The original recipe with nothing added stands alone as a winner and what I am judging here.

I have been making this recipe for a long time. I think I first saw it on the Barefoot Contessa. I halve the cherry tomatoes and saute them in a skillet with butter, olive oil and garlic just until the tomatoes have given up their juice and the garlic,its' flavor. Add salt and pepper to taste. Sometimes I add red pepper flakes and sometimes not. I boil my angel hair pasta till dome. Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce. Sprinkle parmesan cheese. This is my go to dish when I want something fast and light.

The first time I followed the recipe and it was a wonderful side dish. Today I added some red pepper, and onion strips with left over ham chunks to make it a main dish. I made everything ahead of time this AM but kept the pasta out until it was time to heat everything together, and then added just a little V-8. Yepper - it's coming back regularly! Thank you so much for a recipe I really didn't think we'd like, but are planning on using regularly now.

This was quick and easy. I like the taste because it's not over flavored.  Next time I'll have to double the recipe. I did take one reviewers suggestion for increasing the temperature a little to 400 to save time and it came out perfect. A good change from the normal spaghetti.

I love this dish. I pretty much made it as is, the only thing I did a little differently was I increased the oven temp to 400 to reduce the cooking time. It only took about 15 minutes for the tomatoes to roast. I will for sure make this again and will probably add some sautéed onions. This is a very flexible recipe with lots of opportunity to experiment. This is my kind of fun!

I thought this recipe would be a good way to use up some cherry tomatoes I had before they went bad and I was right.  The only change that I made was that I was out of basil, fresh and dried, so I used dried Italian seasoning instead.  I also didn't add the red pepper flakes since I'm not a fan of those.  I really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again in the future.

Using fresh cherry tomatoes and basil from the garden is the key to making this fantastic!  I used a bit more garlic - real cloves I diced.  I also made my angel hair pasta from scratch.  This was a fabulous light, summery pasta dish!  Perfect for a hot summer day.  We added some grilled shrimp to it because we had it and we like it.  Yes, this is fabulous!

Simple, clean, fast and elegant.  This can fit into any occasion and any menu.  As a starter, main or side.  Personally,  a side salad and crusty bread is all that is required.

I really enjoyed this...super easy to make. I used an Italian cheese blend instead of straight up Parmesan cheese. I just added the pasta to the tomatoes after they came out of the oven and omitted the step with cooking on the stove with water.

I've got tons of cherry tomatoes growing and figured that I would try something with them in it. I came across this recipe and thought it looked good AND easy to make. BOTH accounts are accurate!!! It was delicious and my wife and I both loved it, and she can by tough to please when trying something new. She liked it so much that she's been asking me to make it again. It was very good and tasted great and a very lite and refreshing change from the normal pasta/spaghetti dinner we usually have.

This is a great base recipe...and a great way to use up all of this cherry tomatoes that are ripening.  Of course, I added chicken...and it was superb.

I've made this twice in the past few weeks, with the plethora of cherry tomatoes and fresh basil I have from my garden.  It does not disappoint!  Simple, clean, fresh dish.  I may consider adding some shrimp next time, just to make it a little more exciting.

My vegetarian girlfriend loved it and so did I for that matter! I made it almost identical to the stated recipe except that I added more fresh basil simply because I didn't want to throw it away or take the time to dry and save. Oops, I also didn't add any of the saved water. I liked the consistency without it.

So easy and super tasty.  I made this recipe and had it for a vegetarian dinner then served the leftovers as a side dish with grilled salmon the next day.  When my husband sat down to dinner he said he felt like he was in Italy it looked so authentic.  I’ll be making this often.

Made recipe as written. It was awesome except the fact that I added too much red pepper. The recipe calls for a dash and I put in about 5 dashes. Gave it good flavor, though. This dish has great flavor as well as being very pretty and colorful

I used dried basil (no fresh handy) & a few shakes of Italian Herb mix.  We have a surplus of cherry tomatoes this year and this was fast & easy and very delicious. Will make again and again. I doubled everything & am glad I did. Just a small amount leftover after dinner. We loved it!

I used quartered Campari tomatoes and added thinly sliced shallot and a little balsamic vinegar while roasting. I had to use dried basil so I mixed that in with the tomatoes as well. I added some chopped roasted red peppers and some of the oil from the jar to the sauce. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe! I took the advice of another reviewer and added onion, a little splash of balsamic vinegar and Italian seasoning. My husband even loved it and he's not a big fan of pasta. Had shrimp scampi with this it was really great! I had the leftovers the next day and they were just as good. Will definitely be making this again.

So yummy on a warm evening on the patio!!  The tomatoes got a little dry after 25 minutes, so I’d shorten the baking time by 5 or so minutes. Adding the pasta water as you like it was a good addition. It thickens as you simmer it. Add more water if needed. I had only fettuccini noodles in the pantry, but they worked fine, too.  A keeper recipe!!

I did not notice that this only served two and I was serving three people. I added pine nuts and calamarta olives to the sauce, made extra pasta and served them separately. It was delicious!  Next time I will try it without the added ingredients and pay more attention to the number of servings...

I followed the recipe to the letter.    Unfortunately, it lacked taste, very bland.    I tasted the tomato, basil, garlic, red pepper blend when they came from the oven.  All good.    But after adding the pasta, the basil and the garlic flavors were gone.     I saved it 'til next day and added a touch of Lawry's seasoned salt  and some crumbled feta cheese, then microwaved.   Delicious!

Excellent recipe. I added a little more olive oil and placed pieces of fried chicken on top. Used thigh meat instead of cutlets  and varied Panko with Italian bread crumbs. A nice variation from tomato sauce. Especially with all the tomatoes from my garden.

We have an abundance of cherry tomatoes in the garden so decided to try this recipe.  It was amazingly delicious and so easy to make. I will definitely keep it on our rotation.  I made it as the recipe stated but since we love garlic I doubled the amount.   The  roasted tomatoes become so sweet and tasty in the oven.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I make this all the time and add different veggies like mushrooms, when I have them.  I love basil, so I add more.  Sometimes I may add some pancetta or bacon!

Was beautiful.  I put in a touch too much of red pepper flakes (freshly ground).  Since I was using 12 oz of pasta (not angel hair) I almost doubled the tomatoes and garlic. I did double the oil and basil.   Think I could have used tad less basil yet still yummy.  Since I was serving to my grand babies (3 & 10) I used “Harvest (autumn) pasta” for color and presentation.  (Even though angel hair is my favorite.)  Okay, I will admit it was bust with the children (they wanted red/pink sauce) but not because of the recipe.  It was lovely to see and I will make it again (for adults!).  I served with crusty bread  and maybe next time serve with chicken or meatballs on the side?!

P.s. is tasty as cold salad (leftover).

I was attracted to this recipe because I had a lot of cherry tomatoes in my garden. After making this I wish I had planted more.
This simple recipe was  really, really good as well as quick and easy.  I find I am checking my garden often waiting for enough tomatoes to make this again (high heat has slowed down production)

I used this recipe as inspiration for dinner the other night and it was awesome.  I didn't have a whole lot of tomatoes and didn't want to turn the oven on.  I sautéed the tomatoes, garlic and dried basil in olive oil and butter and served over zoodles, which I made for the first time.  It was absolutely great!!  I will definitely make this again and again.  It is truly a great light summer dinner  that does nothing less that thrill your taste buds!!  I have already recommended this to friends!  If you like tomatoes at all, this is definitely a recipe for you!!

the flavor from the sauce is amazing. I would highly suggest though that you double the ingredients for the sauce. I personally thought that there wasn't enough for all the pasta.

Surprisingly delicious for so simple a recipe. Such an excellent way to use up cherry tomatoes when the vines are in full production. I “roasted” them on the stovetop and it worked perfectly. I’ll definitely make it again.

I used cherry along with a few other varieties of small tomatoes and a couple of small sweet peppers. I also used whole wheat spaghetti instead of angel hair, and I topped it with fresh chopped parsley.

OMG this is so good! I did double the amount of pasta, and sauteed some fresh mushroom, black olives, onions, seasoned with dried basil, garlic and onion salt, I added these along with the tomatoes and fresh basil before serving. The pasta was a bit dry so next time I would add a bit of olive oil to the pasta before plating but this is definitely a keeper!!

It was excellent. Instead of angel hair I made it with zoodles and my husband (who does NOT like zucchini) ate a substantial portion and told me how great it tasted! Forever grateful for the help to get hubby to eat more veggies!

This was perfect. I had a cherry tomato plant bursting with tomatoes, several basil plants, and garlic we had already harvested. Easy, quick and delicious.

Yum! Simple, fresh, quick. I sauteed the tomatoes so I wouldn't have to heat up the oven. Also added chicken and spinach and a splash of balsamic vinegar. Very good! Will make again

Great use of our never ending cherry tomatoes from the garden! 
 This would be a great side dish.  As a main course, it needed a little more seasoning...I would add more red pepper flakes.  I added browned ground Italian sausage to the leftovers for a spicier second dinner.

I used grape tomatoes, because that's what I had, and it was very tasty.  Will make it again with Cherry tomatoes to increase amount  of tomato and available liquid to coat the pasta.  You need to use a very good olive oil.

I loved this!  Fresh tasting and perfect for summer.
 I sliced and roasted a couple of Roma tomatoes in addition to the grape/cherry tomatoes since I had skne extral.  This recipe is a keeper!

I enjoyed this very much!  I used some extra garlic and dried basil instead of fresh, but it was scrumptious!  It used up some garden cherry tomatoes in a delicious way. I will be making it again!

I liked it. It was easy to make. I added shrimp, but I needed a little more zest or flavor. Since I don't cook often, I have got to figure it out. But preparation was easy.

Yes, I will make it again. The only change I made was to add some red pepper to spice it up. I liked it very much: easy to do and delicious.

Loved this recipe. It was simple and delicious. The only thing I did different is I kept the tomatoes at room temperature and tossed them with the pasta, a little pasta water, and fresh grated parmesan cheese. I did not reheat the tomato mixture. I put the chopped basil on top. I also used fresh garlic. I will make this again.

Made this exactly as written.  I added additional fresh basil as a garnish.  As to the red pepper flakes, I'd urge caution.  I love them and add them to all kinds of dishes.  However,  this dish does not really have a sauce so much as an "infusion".   Next time  I will add a pinch as opposed to a dash or sprinkle.  With this dish, a little goes a long way.  This dish is easy with little prep.  It is a light but satisfying summer dish.

I followed the recipe exactly, including roasting the tomatoes in the oven.  Not enough sauce for the two of us - next time I will double the amount of tomatoes but the flavour was great and the recipe really easy and quick.
