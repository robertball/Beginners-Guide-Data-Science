I'm not from the south and I've never been to the south, so I may not be the best judge, but I do really like this recipe.  I suspect I'd like it even more if I could find grits in my area that aren't "instant".  I may have to check Amazon (or *gasp* leave my area).  I served this with hushpuppies and roasted asparagus and I was very happy with my meal.

This recipe was the "bomb" easy to make and my friends and family LOVED IT. We all went for seconds with our bowls clean. I will be making this again and again.

I really liked this nice alternative to the usual Shrimp & Grits I usually make! The chilies and tomatoes were an added touch of spice in the grits while the crab brought out the freshness of the dish.
