Instead of corn oil, I used vegetable oil. I did not have flax seed, I just increased the nuts just a touch. I also used my own spices to make pumpkin pie spice. Very moist muffin, my whole family really liked the combination of the pumpkin, apple, dried cranberries and nuts. This is quite different but in a good way. All the diverse textures was lovely. I will absolutely make this again. Eight thumbs up!

These muffins are delish! Packed with flavor and fairly good for you too. I made them a little healthier by replacing half the oil with applesauce, cutting the sugar to 1 cup (could probably cut it even more), using 1 c. ww flour and 3/4 white flour rather than vica versa. I also left out the walnuts, but used a little more dried cranberries. The whole family loved these.

Loved these! I didn't have flax seed and folded 1/2 cup of pecans into the batter (personal preference). Made 12 perfect muffins!

Ooh yummy! I used homemade pumpkin pur√©e and had no flax seeds (I put some wheat germ in there for kicks). The only other change I made was by accident; my nephew was fussing as I was loading up the pan, so I forgot the walnuts :) The recipe made 12 good sized muffins with enough extra to do 11 mini muffins (I did remember to sprinkle nuts on that pan!). They come clean out of the paper wrappers, for some reason I have trouble with that, but these were nice and clean and delicious. The mini muffins I used non stick spray on, and they popped out with no trouble. The cranberries are awesome, I would like to try the golden raisins suggested next. :)

I reduced the amount of sugar, used the applesauce instead of oil, added whole can of  pumpkin, used white and wheat flour and didn't add the crumb topping.  The muffins were wonderful!!

Followed this recipe exactly and these were almost all gone at breakfast! My 16 year old, his girlfriend, my hubby, and our 13 month old all gave these a thumbs up. Super tender and moist, good flavor, and great add-ins. Definite keeper!

I liked this muffin. It makes a great morning muffin, as it is hearty and filling yet still soft with a nice flavor. I made a few changes based on what I had in the house. I only had pumpkin pie filling instead of 100% pure pumpkin. So, I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and the pumpkin pie spice by 1/2 tsp as it already has both. I don't typically see muffins recipes, with a dozen muffins, with over 1 cup of sugar anyhow. I used flaxmeal instead of the seed out of preference. I chose the optional golden raisins over the dried cranberries. I had 1/3 cup left and I thought it was the perfect amount. I also peeled the apple and did a small chop with it in my Vitamix blender on speed one. I liked that it could still be tasted versus having shredded it. That also saved time. The flavor worked well with the golden raisins. I thought they tasted a little more like apple than pumpkin, but that was no big deal. The walnut garnish was a nice addition. They took 27 minutes to bake and I just sprayed the muffin pan lightly with cooking spray and they came out of the pan with ease. I would consider this recipe again, in the fall, for a breakfast muffin. ty

Very easy, moist and delicious.  After reading other reviews, I reduced the sugar by HALF and it was perfect.  Also eliminated dried fruit and used pepitas instead of walnuts.  This is definitely a keeper.

Listen, I made this thing...just as is. I intended to keep it as a thanksgiving/winter time muffin, however, I get asked all the time to make these! The flavor is balanced. It smells and tastes delicious. This is just perfect!

I have tried several other apple and apple/pumpkin muffins recipes from this site, but was disappointed, so the search had to continue.   This recipe didn't look all that different, but it must have been because these were excellent.  I was out of linseed, so I substituted a pinch of wheat bran.  Also substituted olive oil. No walnuts, as hubby can't eat them.  I generally have some struesel topping in the freezer, so put a sprinkle of topping on them before baking.  Thanks!  Oh, and pumpkin pie spice isn't available where I live, so I used some apple pie spice (from this site) instead.

I'll start off with the changes I made: doubled the apple & flax, added 1c mini choco chips, used butter instead of oil, left out the nuts & cranberries and used fresh pumpkin puree. With that said, these turned out really nice. Moist & yummy!

This is delicious and moist, nice texture and I even forgot the spices! I still give it 4 stars. I ate mine with a bit of soft cheese to make up for the lack of spice. I am sure I will like it even more next time when I remember to put them in, ha ha, because this healthy recipe is worth making again. The chopped walnuts really make it, I would even increase the amount a bit!

Our family liked these muffins. They are moist and have a good flavor blend. I swapped whole wheat and white flour amounts to get more whole wheat and used coconut oil instead of corn oil. Chocolate chips are also good it them!

My teenage son and I loved these!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn‚Äôt have flax but would like to try it next time!  I also made my own pumpkin spice without cinnamon, since I‚Äôm allergic to cinnamon.  I will add more cranberries next time. I loved the walnuts on top! These only lasted one day in my house!  I‚Äôm looking forward to making them again soon!

After pulling out the oil with homemade applesauce, using chis soaked in water, Truvia instead of sugar, doubling the walnuts.....this recipe created a terrific muffin top which was like a soft cookie. A sign of a truly great recipe that still tastes great after all the adjustments.

My grandson and I made these with some changes due to food allergies and preferences -- GF flour, 1/4 c. honey/1/4 c. organic sugar, 1/3 c. applesauce + 2. T melted butter, flax "egg," 1/2 c. grated carrot -- the rest of the ingredients as written. Sweet, nutritious snack or breakfast. As is usually the case with my attempts at GF/egg free baking, the muffins did not brown like "regular" muffins would have and they were a bit gummy. Because my grandkids are used to this kind of food, they liked them. I ate one with them in order to rate this recipe. I'm sure that as written, these muffins would be excellent!

Really good! I forgot the vanilla, but they were still great! Moist and flavorful and the crunch of the nuts on top was an excellent touch. I will definitely make these again!

These turned out great.  I made a few substitutions though, based on what I had on hand.  Used coconut oil, yellow raisins and walnuts.  Moist, tasty and good for you.  Oh, and they smell divine while baking!
