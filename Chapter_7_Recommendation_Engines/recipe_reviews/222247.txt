We loved these! My black bean loving daughter devoured an entire burger. I chose to skip the flour and bread in favor of a bit of panko. I did still add the cornstarch. To help the burgers stay together I chilled the finished mixture a few hours then formed the parties in wax paper and put in the freezers to set up a bit more. Next time I think I will go a step further and pre bake so I can allow them to sit out a bit and dry out so they form a nice crispy outside when placed under the broiler for 10 minutes or so.

I added carrots, pre grilled corn I had left over, green onion, and garlic for my veg and to add some smoky flavor I added smoked paprika.

They turned out delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, because I don't think you can give a fair review if you change the ingredients. They were moist and tasty. I usually make my veggie burgers using chick peas, but this was definitely a better tasting burger. -Cheri

I've started making these every week to have in the fridge for a quick lunch or snack. I double the recipe and add a whole medium sweet potato (baked and mashed) and WOW! that just knocks them out of the park, adding extra flavour and some much needed moisture. These are seriously the most amazing burgers I've had. I also use rolled oats and panko instead of the bread and flour. I can't stop eating them!!

We added 1tbsp flax seed and 1tbsp chia seed for protein and froze the patties overnight. Served them on toasted bread with avacado, arugula, tomato, cucumber and scallions after frying. Honestly the best veggie burger I've ever had. Thanks so much!!

I made this with leftover black beans from black beans and rice, added a few extra seasonings, the bread and some flour, and cooked as directed.  They turned out amazing!

These are super tasty and good.  My DH thinks they are better than MorningStar.  I make a batch, cooked on parchment paper, and then freeze them in a gallon bag.  They can then be taken out individually and zapped for a minute for a hot lunch.  I use frozen corn instead of the pepper and carrots. And, I use cooked dried beans instead of canned for less sodium. Great recipe!

This recipe is by far the absolute best vegan black bean burger I have ever tried. I added a little cauliflower to give it some depth and since I am from the Caribbean I added to some fresh hot pepper for spice. This is the first vegan burger recipe that I followed that came out perfect.

I tried it last night and WOW my family LOVEDDDD them , I dont see how can you not unless you didnt follow the directions and I tweeked it. I added Jazmine Rice instead of bread crumbs, and added minced jalepinos for an extra kick.. I forgot the garlic but you literally don't have to follow the exact directions as long as you can cook somewhat.. go with what you know. I alson added lemon peper instead of regular peper .. But this recipe with spinach, Vegan cheese, Alvacodo, vegan mayo, mustard, & BBQ sauce all under the wheat bread was killer !!!! Best Black Bean recipe I've ever gotten off the internet.. Actually best black bean recipe and I love the "secret" not so secret ingredient is the Chili sauce! BOMB.COM Thankssss 
Excuse my mispelling I am a fast thinker/typer but you get it!

I did not use the seafood seasoning (didn't feel like spending $6+ on it at the store) and they still turned out great! I used panko crumbs instead of bread and tossed in an egg instead of cornstarch. I ate it on a kaiser roll with jalape√±o mustard, ketchup, vegan mayo, dill pickles, and mixed greens -- amazing!!

Absolutely delicious! I am not a vegan or vegetarian. I am just on the Daniel fast with my church and not currently eating meat or dairy, etc. I love meat so much, but this doesn't make me miss it at all. I am so happy I came across this recipe... Amazing!!!!

I wanted it as a finger food, so I made it like falafel, it was DELICIOUS! Instead of burgers, shape like teaspoon-size meatballs. Deep fry in very hot oil. They are very tasty, so don't over-do the condiments. Just serve with pita triangles & cucumber sauce (or sour cream).

I made it last night and it was AMAZING!!!! My husband likes to follow the exact recipe, so we did not make any major changes, just added some chopped mushrooms, 2 tbsp of garlic ( as garlicky as possible ),  and I added a teaspoon of hot paprika when he was not looking. 
Once we have rolled it into patties, I coated them with Italian breadcrumb and cooked them on the stove instead of the oven. Oh so yum!!!
We used Simple Truth Organic Black Beans 15oz, made 12 patties. The patties did not crumble or break apart, if the recipe is followed as it is. I did not freeze or refrigerate any at all. 2 patties alone without bread, are filling enough. As we are on a low-carb diet, next time we'd like to substitute the flour and bread with something else.

I made these (first time) for a Memorial Day bbq and everyone (even the non-vegans) enjoyed them.   I think I over-mashed the beans, so next time I may reserve a few and add them in whole just for better texture.  Also I MAY scale back on the Sriracha sauce because, for me, they were a little too spicy, but everyone else said they were great.  I may also chop the onion, green pepper and carrot in my food processor to make the pieces smaller and to save time.

This is very good...only needs 1/8 cup flour, if that.  I like another reviewers idea of using panko crumbs instead.  I may try that.  My meat-only eating husband even loved them.  I also did not have the sriracha.

I made this today.  I was dying for a burger and fries and have recently gone vegan/low fat high starch.  I made these and I am not disappointed!  Subs: instead of carrots frozen corn, instead of sirracha I added a little of my favorite salsa.  I don't have flour in the house, so used some cornmeal.  Oats instead of  bread ;) Yes, I subbed a lot, but that's the beauty of this recipe...it's so versatile and you can cook them then freeze them (which is what I did).  This recipe made 4 large burgers or 6 smaller.

Loved these.  Made as recipe calls,  except I didn't have any Chile Garlic sauce,   so I used Sriracha Mustard instead.  I also omitted the seafood seasoning,  as I didn't have any.    So I'm not sure if that made a huge difference,  but they turned out YUMMY!!   They even heat up well as leftovers too!   I've added this to my favs!  Thanks!  :)

Sooo good. Seriously, like the best thing I have tasted. So moist and yummy. This are now a staple in my family after only making them twice. The key is to really mash it all good to make a paste to keep the patties together. The second time I made them I added mushrooms, really good too.

These were really, really good!  I've never made a veggie-based burger before and it was very easy and delicious!  I'm not a huge Sriracha fan but am a HUGE Old Bay fan, so I upped it to a tablespoon of Old Bay and then added 1 more T of water and 1 T of white vinegar to make up for the moisture from the missing Sriracha.  I then dressed the bun like I usually would - lettuce, onion, tomato, ketchup, mustard, and even a little vegan mayo.  

The best part is that my 2 year old was curious and I broke off a piece and she LOVED it.  It's a huge personal win for me because the rest of the family typically turns their noses up at my veggie creations/substitutions.  A winner all around!

Next time I'd cut back on the Sriracha....one of my kids doesn't like spice at all...therefore I'd cut it back to 2TBSP.  Otherwise it was a hit with everyone!  Best vegan burger I've made!

I really love this recipe.  Very easy to make and very tasty.  Instead of a bun, I cut circles from whole wheat bread to use in order to cut down on the bread.

We loved these burgers! I mashed them fairly thin, made 8 patties. Used the food processor for all the mixing. I did not like that it called for 2 slices of bread -- in fact when I printed it that part cut off, so it came as a surprise... I used only one slice and some bread crumbs. Next time I'll use all bread crumbs and no bread. It took 3/4 cup of flour to make them just sticky, don't keep adding or they will be dry. Next time I will also freeze the patties a little before cooking--and double the recipe to save some for later!

These came out great. They were very easy to put together. The directions provided were easy to follow. My suggestion if feeding kids is to decrease the chili sauce and chili powder. I devoured within 5 minutes. I topped with a salad mix, tomatoes, sweet chili pickles, red onion, ketchup and veganaisse. Great recipe!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!  It's now a staple in our dinner rotation.  I'm vegan as well as one of my sons, and 2 of my other sons are vegetarian so this one fits for most of us.  More importantly, all of our meat-eating family members LOVE these, too! On a multigrain bun with some avocado and dijon mustard, tomato, lettuce...  WOW!

Followed the recipe and these vegan burgers turned out excellent. Make sure the patties are baked all the way through for the best texture.

With some changes I think this recipe can be far better. I made it as close as possible to the original but found out during the mixing process I didn‚Äôt have any corn starch. I also got a bit scared in mixing the flour. I felt it was just too much starch between the wheat bread slices and the flour. So I did use only 1/2 cup instead of the required 3/4 cups. In the end it turned out decent enough. But I think next time I will put it all in the food processor to make the vegetables even more minced. I want to use  panko bread crumbs also instead of the bread. I do think the amount of flour I used was perfect.  They came out moist enough and I am looking forward to making them again.

These are SO delicious! I used a food processor to blend beans and garlic and onion together for a nice mashed consistency and used an egg for lack of having corn starch on hand. Next time I will experiment with dialing down some of the seasoning- maybe half the cumin and chili powder. Also used 3/4 amount of flour called for. These also can be turned up for a great sloppy burger substitute- doused with sauces and cheese on a decadent bun or turned into a healthy simple burger served on lettuce with less bread crumbs, cornstarch and flour for max nutrition.

First time preparing this recipe. I enjoyed them,shared with my co-workers they liked them too, but we agreed that the next time I made them I'd make a few minor adjustments.

I can't give it a five star because technically, as written, it's not vegan. Whole wheat bread has dairy and eggs in it. If vegan whole wheat was meant, it should have been said. I had to adjust with oat flour, ground flax seed and some whole wheat flour.

Tastes really good! I think people can dare a bit more with spices and pepper to make the taste a bit more interesting. Keeping it in the oven for too long can make the burger quite dry. I served it inside bread together with avocado and spinach.

I didn't have any chili sauce so I put in a couple tablespoons of salsa.  I made them for a vegan exchange student and don't have a lot of vegan experience, but they taste fine.  A bit labor-intensive, but I would make them again.

This was a winner for me, my husband, AND two little ones (4yrs and 7yrs old)! I actually cooked them in a skillet with coconut oil. Trying again tonight, but going to see if they are just as yummy baked.

Really easy and delicious. I only used very little flour, formed patties then rolled in cornmeal. Froze them for 20 mins, then cooked them in a iron skillet with a little oil. This will be my go to recipe and we will have them once a week...thanks!

This was the first time I made veggy burgers and was a hit with my meat loving husband so will definitely make them again. I did them pretty much as the recipe ( added ground cardamom and possibly more garlic ). I made then the day before and allowed the spices to settle in. Fab thanks xxx

I made exact. It had good flavor but was a very mushy texture that I didn't care for.  I did refrigerate before cooking as suggested but they were still too mushy for me. A+ for flavor though.

Soooo yummy! My whole family loved it, including myself. My husband was a bit hesitant that it wasn't beef, but during supper he said it was really good, and after supper and he said they were really filling! My daughter said she really liked it but it was a bit spicy for her, so I will make a double batch next time and make a couple patties less spicy. Hopefully it works to freeze patties for another day I think bean burgers are a good idea. I will keep you all posted. This one is a winner.

Very nice! I played with the spices & thickeners a little bit: only used 1 T of Sriracha and added an extra T of water to account for the lost moisture; in place of Old Bay, used a mix of celery salt, black pepper, & Tagine Spice from Williams-Sonoma; used Harissa Spice from Williams-Sonoma in place of chili powder; used 2 T of flour instead of 1 T of corn starch; minced 3 cloves fresh garlic; only used 1/4 c flour instead of 3/4 cup because it got sticky quickly. Also cooked for 5 minutes extra on each side because they were too soft on the outside after only 10. 

It was somewhat crisp on the outside and sort of creamy on the inside. Served these on toasted whole wheat bagel thins, with a sauteed carrot and sweet onion topping. Had a side of creamy vegan broccoli soup, and strawberries with white wine for dessert. 
My mom is sensitive to spice, which is why I limited the Sriracha. However she said that it was still almost too spicy for her. I added a little Sriracha & mustard on top of mine and that was the right amount for me.

Though this yielded four solid patties, I wish there was more of a meaty texture. I may experiment with mushrooms on the inside and a bread crumb coating on the outside. Not flawless, but a nice working recipe for this veggie burger beginner.

LOVED this!  I had a black bean burger in local restaurant and looked for a recipe I could try at home.  This is perfect!  I used a Silpat mat and a dab of olive oil.  That gave it a little crisp in the oven.  Followed the recipe to the "t" and came out great.  Would love to reheat it on the top rack of the grill. Mmmmm

Rating to keep track of my small changes (the recipe is probably good as is though!)  .  I didn't have green pepper so I used a red pepper instead (diced small).  I also used panko crumbs (instead of  the bread), and very little amount of flour (it was less than 1/4 cup).  I dont like old bay seasonings so opted for smoke paprika.  I also cooked the veggies a bit in a skillet to soften.   I didnt bake but rather fried in a skillet with a little bit of vegan butter.  This is a keeper!!!

I followed the recipe except I added only about 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour instead of the white flour.  The baked well and they taste great!

These " Vegan Black Bean Burgers" had a great Tex-Mex  flavor (worth repeating)  and held together really well (great texture); however, there was a certain "rawness" associated with the flour (maybe because I only used 1T of sriracha) . The leftovers tasted much better (no "raw flour taste") 3 days later. I would certainly make an adapted version of this recipe again (no flour). Thank you jeshaka for sharing your recipe.

Instead bell pepper I used one medium size courgette, and add 2 to 3 tablespoons mustard but removed the salt from the recipe and cooked inside wall oven, 17 minutes for every side.

I made it! Instead of flour, I used 1 cup of Italian Style breadcrumbs. However, 1 cup is entirely too much. I ended up adding a little more water & another can of black beans (rinsed & mashed) to fix this. I didn‚Äôt use bell peppers. Overall, it turned out pretty good, just a little spicy for me. Next time, I‚Äôll use less chilli sauce to cut down on the heat

Tastes great, super easy to make, I substituted the bread with panko and it came out great. The patties were a bit dry but I think I added too much corn starch.

I have been trying to find a recipe that was just as good as the bean burger I had at a restaurant. Think I found it. Very tasty. The Caramelized onions gives it that perfect flavor. That along with my peppered cheese.

Nice firm patties.  In my oven I increased the cooking time by 5 minutes on each side.  I loved that these patties have the same consistency as a meat patty.  Very tasty.  Will definitely make them again.

This recipe was SO easy to make!  I docked it one star only because I thought it was too spicy (just my preference), but I do plan to make this again without the chili powder and with less sriracha.  Nonetheless, my very picky husband liked these! And I am going to take the advice of another reviewer to double (or triple) the recipe and freeze some.  I also think that the basic concept of this is so good that it would be easy to experiment by adding in different ingredients or changing the spices.  And just as a note, I didn't need to add that much flour. One reviewer commented that they were too dry, and I could certainly see that happening.  I would eyeball the batter and use your discretion.  You could even dribble some olive oil on toward the end of the bake time to moisten it up.

These were good and flavorful.  I used a green onion, skipped the green pepper, bread crumbs instead of the bread and 1 egg instead of the water and cornstarch.  I only needed 1/4 c of flour.  They held together very well.  My vegetarian son loved it.

This is a good start.  I did use Siracha sauce and they turned out too spicy.  I am even the kind of person that loves spice and puts it on all kinds of things.  It was just over the top.  I will make these again but use 1/3 of the recommended spice.

These did not taste good. They were full of heat (spicy) but were lacking immensely in flavor. I followed the directions to a T and made no substitutions. They did make four large patties though. But now I‚Äôll have to throw them away. I made myself eat like three quarters of a burger, but just threw the rest away. Quite unfortunate because I really wanted to like them.

No matter how long I cooked this stuff or boosted the temp, they still remained a paste with a thin crust.  The taste is very bland, then an overwhelming spicy aftertaste.  I spread it on a wrap and choked it down because I hate to waste food, but this is definitely not for me.

I substituted the onion and garlic for powdered versions as I didn't have them. Didn't have the optionals or the seafood seasoning either. However, I did have the chili sauce. I think the cornstarch/bread/flour combo made a great consistency. I only had to use about 1/3 a cup of flour in total. They weren't too dry, and were super tasty! This is a great budget vegan option!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I ALWAYS opt for the carrots they just add a special something. This time I added a hamburger seasoning. I have made the original recipe more than twice and I love it, but I think the burger seasoning will add an interesting spin. We'll see!

I modified this a lot- I used organic brown rice(eyeballed the amount I mixed in), and left out the carrots, bell peppers, and corn starch. I used Frank's Red Hot Wing sauce (2TBL), and the family loved them. I topped with avocado and tomato, and it worked well.

Made this for a healthier meal for the family. However I used flour instead of cornstarch as I didn‚Äôt have any on hand.  I doubled the recipe but I think I added just a bit too much chili sauce and powder so burgers cane out with a bit stronger taste than I would have liked. Also they didn‚Äôt hold together as well as hoped. All that being said they were still good and I will probably attempt at making them again and hopefully better second time around.

I made it as written except I cooked them in a 450 degree oven (I was also roasting veggies). I am not normally a fan of bean burgers but I have to say these were good. I cooked a vegan meal for friends from out of town and tripled the recipe; they were thrilled. The left over burgers have gotten spicier through the week as we have eaten them for lunches.

I thought these were phenomenal. I made it without the seafood seasoning because we don't use it, and skipped the optional bell pepper for my picky 7-year-old son. Said son has zero tolerance for any hot spices and thought they were too spicy even though I cut the chili sauce back to just one tablespoon. I will make these again but will sub mild taco sauce for the Asian chili sauce--hubby and I will add the chili sauce directly on top of our burgers instead. I cooked them on parchment in an air fryer basket and they held together very well.

I added less breadcrumbs and multigrain but also changed seasoning to sauzon complete seasoning instead seafood seasoning. Turn out great like better than beef burgers.

I've never made meatless burgers before so this was a first. Followed the recipe as is except for adding 1/4cup of corn. Found it very sticky while mixing it. Made 4 very large, heavy patties. They cooked nicely, 15 min each side and looked great! Nice n crispy on the outside. Flavour was good but had trouble getting past the texture of them, just too goopy, thick, pasty and sticky for my taste but I did manage to finish one. Have to see what hubby thinks after work but I don't think I'll be making these again, sorry :-/

This was delicious!!! I did not have the sea food flavoring, so used Tone‚Äôs 6 pepper seasoning blend instead, and wow!!! This is so good!! I cooked up a few for the week, and will be adding this to my routine.

When we made it, we could not find black beans anywhere, only red kidney beans and they were DELICIOUS!! So at least we can all know that red kidney beans work well too. This recipe is great and I'm a very picky, veggie-hater, but this is yummy

These bean burgers were very flavorful and delicious.  The consistency took some getting use, so we flattened the patties pretty thin before cooking and they turned out awesome. The guys (carnivores) made double and triple deckers and loved them!!!

Holy sriracha, Batman! These are good, but hot. Even my jalape√±o-loving husband thought they were a bit much. We're big meat eaters, and looking for ways to substitute veggies. These burgers do the trick; we will definitely back off on the sriracha though!

Amazing! Made recipe as stated only I doubled it to have enough for my big family. My 13 year old son did not believe that these didn't have some type of meat in them. The whole family loved them and I barely got a photo before they were all eaten. This will be my veggie burger recipe forever!

Really great-tasting recipe! I subbed bread crumbs for some of the flour, only adding 1/4 cup of flour and I also didn't have sriracha so I used some vinegar and chili powder

I have made this recipe a few times and the first was a bit of a flop...why?  Because I didn't follow the recipe! I thought I would "improve" the healthfulness of this recipe by using Quinoa flour - mistake!    They were simply "ok".  The next two times I made the burgers I followed the recipe pretty closely but was in a hurry so didn't add the carrots or the green peppers.  Everyone loved them.   Also, I cook my own black beans in the pressure cooker and cook them a little longer than called for and this makes them easy to work with.  I simple pile all the ingredients in a bowl and then use a hand mixer to blend them all to the consistency I like.   I then form into burgers and allow to cool in the fridge until dinner time.   All and all a very good / easy recipe and now that I have quit trying to "improve" it, it is wonderful!

I pretty much followed the recipe as written except I used pinko instead of bread.  Very, very pleased with these and I'll make extra next time for freezing. Oh, I will also try some of the suggestions of other reviewers!

These came out great. I didn't use the green pepper, and used Panko instead of the flour. I didn't get it mixed as well as I should have so they were a wee bit dry. But, when served with BrandNewVegan cheese sauce and grilled sweet onions, was pleasing. My husband added guacamole and voiced no complaints. Next time I'll mix better or add a bit of the bean juice back in.

These were very good. My meat loving husband and son said they were palatable which for them is a high compliment since we have gone mostly vegan. I followed the recipe exactly except for the seafood seasoning since I didn't have any.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

My family loved this recipe. We are new to vegan cuisine. So everyone is skeptical. However, this recipe is a keeper. I salted the minced veggies n weighed them down in a strainer to get a ton of liquid out. I add only 1/2 cup of flour and that was perfect. We cooked them on a charcoal grill and they were awesome. Ty for this recipe!!!

Flavor was great. Also pretty easy to make. My biggest issue was the binder for the burgers. I tried using the cornstarch as said but in the end it ended up as dried bean crumbs. I'm not vegan so I did add egg to help bind everything together and it turned out great. That won't work for any vegans out there but just be ready with another binder to use in case the cornstarch mixture doesn't work. Overall it was really good once I got that worked out.

I made these burgers as is.  They were delicious with nice texture; not mushy. With that being said, on bite three, I was breathing flames. Lol. Will definitely be making them again but cutting back on the Sriracha to 1 Tbsp and 1/2 tsp Old Bay (thought that was just a bit too strong).

I made this for a vegan friend who enjoyed it very much. I have now added to my week diet. I'm planning on using some of the other suggestions in the rating to see if I can make it better. - jonny

Loved this bean burger. Did it just as the recipe called and everyone raved about it. Served it with salad and sweet potato wedges. Condiments were tomato, avocado, lettuce, mustard and mayo. YUM!

Made these for my black bean loving vegan toddler. She really liked them! I swapped out the Sriracha for ketchup since I thought they would be too spicy for her otherwise. I subbed one oat bran pita for the two slices of bread, and blended the pita in the food processor before mixing it in. I only used a little flour as prior reviews said the burgers came out a little dry. I was able to get 11 mini burgers out of the recipe. Very moist and tasty!
