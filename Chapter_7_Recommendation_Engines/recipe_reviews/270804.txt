This is my favorite mayo ingredient therefore I like a lot the final flavor. I hadn't done this before so I was unaware how quick it toasts with the mayo. That said, no more than 3 minutes before bread goes dark on cooking side.

I will admit I was very skeptical. I absolutely love grilled cheese sandwiches, they are always my go to lunch. I love the taste of real butter on everything. As soon as I saw this recipe I went right to the kitchen to make it. I will say I will from this point on always use mayonnaise instead of butter. Honestly using the mayonnaise instead of butter tasted amazing, and wasn’t as greasy. I used Havarti cheese because it is my favorite, and American cheese. I made one for my daughter but I didn’t tell her are used mayonnaise instead of butter, and she didn’t even know the difference. This is how I will make my grilled cheese from now on!! Thank you so much for this recipe.

Toasts better than butter. I've done this for years. It was a happy accident back then!

If you are craving grilled cheese sandwich, this is the best tasting one by far. I like to add a teaspoon of butter inside the sandwich simply because it gives it a nutty buttery flavor.
