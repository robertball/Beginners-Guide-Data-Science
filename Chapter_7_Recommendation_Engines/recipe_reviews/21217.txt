I thought this was great - I read the other reviews and made some modifications:  I used a whole cup each of chopped onion and celery, and I used a 28 oz. can of tomato sauce.  I used fresh crushed garlic, fresh and dried basil, fennel seed, white pepper, and a pinch of hot pepper flakes.  And less salt.  I used part skim mozzarella to bring down the fat content and instead of canned mushrooms I used a pound of fresh, sliced mushrooms.  The many layers shown here by keeping the mushrooms, sauce, and sausage mixture separate seemed too time consuming, so I mixed those together, and my layers were simply pasta, sauce, cheese, repeat.  I also added some fresh chopped parsley to the top before baking it for 25 minutes.  We really enjoyed it with a loaf of french bread, and it makes lots - I'm happy to have yummy leftovers!

This is great, but the second time I made it I made modifications:  I sauteed the sausage along with the vegetables, and then just added the tomatoes and seasonings.  I made extra sauce by using a 28 oz. can tomatoes (ran them through the food processor) and an extra 8 oz. tomato sauce, adding extra seasonings as well.  I also used fresh mushrooms, and just sliced them and cooked them in the sauce.  Instead of layering everything, I just mixed the cooked pasta together with the sauce and layered that with the cheese (using lots more cheese than called for).  I ended up with two layers of sauce/cheese.  I was looking for something very saucy and cheesy, and that was pretty much perfect!

I found that this recipie didn't use nearly enough sauce.  I would triple the sauce on this. 45 minutes in the oven may also be too long.  If everything is already cooked and fairly warm, it should only take 15-20 minutes in the oven.    It came out very dry and near the edges the macaroni was crunchy.  Definitely would be better with a lot more sauce and less time in the oven.

Use hot italien sausage for more flavor; after removing from casing, brown in olive oil and a little garlic powder.

I don't use the canned tomatoes or sauce, I find that Clasico brand Spagetti bottled sauce is best because it's a little chunky and good flavor.  I always double the recipe and make two portions, freezing one.  In the process I probably use about 4 or 5 bottles of sause (28oz - I think).

Delicious and easy!  Like others, I used a premade sauce - I used Emeril's "Kicked Up Tomatoe".  The changes I made after reading the reviews was to use only 1/2 the amt. of pasta (I was cooking for 3), 1/2 the amount of sausage but used the full amount of onions (omitted the celery), used one can of mushrooms, used a 28 oz jar of speghetti sauce, the full 8 oz. of mozzarella and parmeasan cheese. I also just mixed everything together except for the parmeasan which I added to the top as directed.  It turned out perfectly - I was told it was the best ziti I had ever made and I agree.  If you are going to do the recipe for 8 servings I agree with most of the others - you will need more sauce. Thanks submitter!

We use Boca Italian sausage for this and absolutely love it.  I too use pre-made pasta sauce and I mix everything together rather than layering it-also I cover the casserole while cooking so it doesnt dry out-thanks for a great recipe!

This was a delicious recipe for baked ziti.  Subbed bottled pasta sauce and only used about 12 oz of ziti based on other reviews.  Also used 8 oz fresh mushrooms.  Fabulous!  Will repeat often.

A delicious change from regular pasta and sauce.  If you work during the week, this is an excellent dish to make ahead and re-warm.  It's also a hit at pot-lucks.

This was one of the better recipes Ive tried from the pasta site.  My picky kids loved it as did my husband.  I used packaged Marinara sauce and added it to the sausage which made it even easier.
It would be excellent to add spicey italian sausage but then im afraid it would be too hot for kids.

I had to make some revisions based on what I had on hand... I used Rotini pasta, omitted celery since I was out and used a jar of 4-cheese spaghetti sauce since I didn't feel like making the sauce from scratch. I also added some oregano, basil, parsley, rosemary, pepper & a little sugar to cut the acidity of the sauce. I just mixed everything together in my casserole dish instead of bothering with layers & baked it at 350Â° for 25 minutes in our convection toaster oven so I didn't have to heat up the entire house... Super super good!!

I make this recipe regularly.  It's easy and very tasty.  I use 28 oz. cans of both tomato sauce and tomatoes.  I also double the spices but I cut back the salt to 2 teaspoons.  I also double the onion.  I usually leave out the celery as I don't usually have it on hand.  But I have made it both ways and it is great with or without.  I always add the sauce to the pan with my sausage.  Then I mix in the pasta.  I layer half of the mixture with 2 cups mozzarella and then the remainder with another 2 cups of mozzarella and top with the Parmesan.  (My family loves cheese!)  I only bake it about 35 minutes to keep the top from drying out too much.  ***Don't miss out on the sauce by using a jar of pasta sauce.  The sauce is very easy to make and tastes great!

I made this tonight and it was great! My husband loved it too!! I used hot turkey Italian sausage, penne rigate pasta, and 1 and a half jars of Prego Tomato, Onion, and Garlic Sauce. After I cooked the sausage I mixed in the sauce and let it simmer for a few minutes. Then I mixed half the sauce with half of the cooked pasta and put it in a 9 x 13 baking dish. I put mozzarella cheese on top and then put the other layer of pasta and sauce on top of that. Then I topped it off with the rest of the mozzarella and parmesan cheese. I baked it at 350 for 25 minutes. I think 45 minutes would have been too long since everything was already cooked. It turned out perfect. I will definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe. I did add 8 extra oz of roasted garlic tomato sauce and will probobly add even more next time. I also added some fresh minced garlic in place of the celery. My husband and his friend both went back for seconds.

Very tasty, but YES, more sauce.  I used a half of jar of leftover spaghetti sauce with the tomatoes.  I added garlic to the meat instead of the powder to the sauce.  I mixed the meat, sauce and mushrooms and layered the this, the pasta and the cheese.  Next time I would mix everything but the cheese.  And I put it in the oven for only about 20 minutes.

Very Good.  I served it with a large freash salad and warm bread.  My family was using the bread to sop up the last of the sauce from the pan!

I used sweet italian sausage to give it a different taste, doubled the tomato sauce, cut the baking time down to 25 minutes. The dish still came out slightly dryish but still very good.

I followed the recipe but found that 1 lb. of pasta was way too much.  I will use less next time.  UPDATE: To simplify things, I brown the sausage with the onion, drain, then just add the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes and sauce to the sausage mixture...why dirty another pot?

This was delicious but I missed the fennel flavour that is present in the traditional recipe. I used fennel seed to compensate. I omitted the canned mushrooms and used fresh eggplant instead. To save time, I used pre-packaged grated "Italian blend" cheese instead of pure mozzarella.

This is a fantastic recipe!  It's the first time I've used tomato sauce instead of a jar of spaghetti sauce.  I followed other suggestions and used a 28oz jar of tomato sauce and a 15 oz of fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  I added way more garlic than it called for and used herbs de provence instead of oregano, because that's what I had.  The house smelled DIVINE! Great for a pot luck or make ahead and bake later kinda thing.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Wonderful dish! I did tweak it a little by taking out celery since no one here cares for it, I switched ziti for penne, and I used moose Italian sausage that we had made from the moose my boyfriend got this year. It was much easier than I expected to make and tasted great. The leftovers didn't even last very long :). Will definitely make again.

Read this after making my own...mine used fresh garlic, Swiss Chard-no celery, and all in one pot...a Dutch oven of course. Added a tablespoon of red pepper flakes and a cup of red wine and some brown sugar.  It was good

This was a great quick dinner. I made a few adjustments. Several reviews said that it needed more sauce, which I ended up doing. I also added a little bit of red wine, tbsp sugar, thyme and rosemary. When browning the sausage, I added green peppers instead of celery. My husband went for seconds and thirds of this dish! Even my 4 year old daughter who is a picky eater loved it.

This was a very good recipe with a few variations.  Instead of layering, I just threw it all together, even the mozzarella cheese.  I did put the parm. cheese on top though.  45 minutes is a little too long to cook because the ziti got crunchy.  30 minutes should do it.  Oh...I also used hot sausage (ouch).  Next time I'll use sweet or half ground beef/half sweet sausage.  A good recipe though.  Thank you, George.

This needs about 25% less pasta and then double the sauce and cheese.I also added a pinch of sugar to the sauce and used fresh mushrooms. I used real garlic also. I only cooked this for 30 minutes which was more than enough. Good recipe overall.

This recipe was okay. Tasted great, but I had to make a few revisions. I added an extra can of tomato sauce to have enough sauce. I also added some provolone cheese between the layers.

I loved this myself so rated this 5 stars and hubby thought it was pretty good.  I made more sauce and left out the mushrooms.  I also added a little sugar for my husband but he still thought it was a little too "acidic" as he likes to say.

I made this without the mushrooms and really liked the flavor.  However, I thought it needed more sauce (or less pasta).  I would make this again!

This was a nice change for pasta.  I followed the recipe except mixed everything together and left off the parmesan cheese.  I was hesitant about the celery but it added a good flavor and texture.  I don't like all the cheeses so was glad to find a recipe with just mozzarella. This tasted the same next day so leftovers can follow you to work.

This recipe is good; it is basically just spaghetti, which is fine with us.  I was looking for a way to doll up Italian turkey sausage; which can taste bland, and this did it, so that was nice.  This isn't mind blowing, but it is good.  The kids ate it up.

This was the absolute best recipe ever.  I do agree with the other people who have made this, to use the pre-made sauce.  I mixed sweet italian and hot italian sausage, giving it just a hint of spicyness.  It was wonderful.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

We were very disappointed by this because it was so salty. I would cut the salt down by at least half -- maybe do 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1 1/2 teaspoons. I love salt but couldn't handle how salty this was. The rest of it, however, is DELICIOUS. I will definitely make again but just reduce the salt. I also added 2 fresh garlic cloves and 1/2 teaspoon italian seasoning. My husband thought that it needed more cheese and more sauce. It was not his favorite, but I thought that it was pretty good with the exception of the salt.

This was so easy and a nice change of pace from regular spaghetti.  I used tricolor rotini, because I had no ziti, which was fine.  I also used bottled sauce and italian turkey sausage.  Simple and yummy!

The dish is really good but it needs more sauce!!! I put in 28oz of tomatoes and 15oz of tomato sauce and it was still a bit dry. I also added in extra seasonings- just what I had on hand! My husband and I do not like mushrooms so I put yellow corn in instead and we both love it. I will make again!

This is a good recipe, but I give it 3 *** because I modified it so much. 

1) Saute the onions, celery, and sausage together. I found the sausage had enough oil that adding olive oil wasn't really necessary. 

2) Added fresh garlic to that mixture when it was done. 

3) Skipped the sauce making part altogether and added two jars of Barilla Tomato Basil pasta sauce. 

4) Simmered that while the ziti was cooking.

5) Used one bigger dish and one layer of noodles, sauce, then cheese. I happened to have some fresh basil so I sprinkled that on top of the whole thing. 

6) Baked for only 30 minutes and that was plenty. 

It was great! A nice change from spaghetti or lasagna.

A big hit when you're making for lots of people with different tastes! I used hot italian sausage, and even guests who prefer mild food (not me!) liked it that way. I also made a more sauce, as others had suggested. I wouldn't make it any other way, or I'd be afraid it would be bland and dry. Even still, if you prefer a bit more flavour, bring some hot sauce to the table!

This is great, but I don't know how fair my review is because I made a lot of changes (due to taste and what I had on hand).  It's a WONDERFUL base recipe!  I used ground, hot sausage, doubled the onion and tomatoes, increased the tomato sauce, omitted the salt, used mezzi tubetti pasta, less mushrooms, doubled the cheese, added some fresh grated romano cheese, and didn't mix the sauce in a saucepan - I go the water boiling, then did step one, and cooked fresh minced garlic (instead of powder) with the meat, then added the sauce ingredients (and 1 tea. sugar) to it.  I layered noodles (which were done cooking when the sauce was) in a 9X13" pan, then the sauce mix, then cheese, and repeated.  I only needed to bake for 30 min.

I used tomato and basil pasta sauce, doubled the amount, used more mushrooms and doubled mozzarella cheese and meat (used turkey breakfast sausage - all I had). I also did not do layers but mix it all together. It was pretty good, easy to fix.

Very Good!  I cheated and used jar spaghetti sauce instead, and added the diced tomatoes with onions and garlic and added some extra garlic (fresh).  My husband had 2nds, and my son enjoyed it.  (He'll eat anything with pasta!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very good and very easy to make. I browned the sausage with the celery, minced garlic and onion, drained it on some paper towels, then added it to the sauce along with fresh  mushrooms. No need to dirty another pan. I also used double the amount of canned tomatoes and tomatoe sauce. Extra cheese needed as well. This works with penne or fusilli pasta as well. Kids loved it!

Too much pasta for the amount if sauce. Either reduce the amount of pasta or double the amount of sauce. There wasn't enough of it to cover the pasta so when it baked the pasta got hard/crunchy around the edges.

Made this tonight for dinner. Made a couple of changes since my husband and little one can tell a canned tomato sauce from freshly made sauce. So I made the sauce from scratch using plum tomatoes and crushed tomatoes with 3 cloves of garlic (minced) with a dash of red chili pepper flakes. I also put sliced fresh white mushrooms.

Made this for a family gathering and it went over great.  The taste and texture of this dish is wonderful.  This is definitely a keeper and has earned a permanent home in my cookbook.  Thanks for sharing.

We really liked this recipe, it had good flavor. The only thing my husband complained about was that he would have liked more sausage in it, I'll have to add more next time.

omitted celery. celery does not belong in ziti in my opinion. used 3/4 tsp. garlic salt & 3/4 tsp. regular salt. too much for me. next time i will only use 1/2 tsp. of each and go from there!

I liked this a lot.  After reading the reviews, I omitted the celery and halved the pasta.  I didn't have any mushrooms on hand, so that was out, although next time I'll buy some.  I like spicy food so used hot Italian sausage and Anaheim peppers.  (I know, wouldn't it be nice if we just reviewed the actual recipe??)

Anyway, this was a great baked ziti recipe that can be adapted to anybody's taste.  It's important to stick to the 30 minute cooking time, though, as opposed to 45.  Thanks, George, this is a keeper.

This was very good and easy to make. Didn't have any celery, so used many mushrooms. The leftovers were also tasty.

This is a very good recipe.  It's easy to make, with simple ingredients, and the end result is a rich, filling meal.  I used turkey Italian sausage, added some fresh garlic in addition to the onion and celery during browning, and some basil to the sauce.  The celery seemed a little weird in a pasta dish, but it added a nice contrast in texture to the pasta, cheese,and sausage. Overall, this dish was excellent.  This one's a keeper.

This was wonderful!  I used Owens Italian sausage, which comes in a tube like breakfast sausage, so I didn't have to worry about the casing issue.  Yummy!

I absolutely love this recipe. I have made it several times for my boyfriend and he can't get enough. The first time I made it with the hot and spicey italian sausage. Im not a sausage fan so the next time I made it with half sausage half ground beef. It turned out great!

This was really good...It is my favorite Baked Ziti recipe from this site. Although, I ran out of sauce and had to use some pre-made sauce in addition to what the recipe called for. Next time I would half the recipe, but keep the sauce the same. We enjoyed this, but it made so much we will be eating it for days!

Great recipe. Rather than make one big casserole I made 8 smaller using oven/micro dishes. Quick meals already made.- Definitely will do again.

I made this last night for dinner - awesome! I ended up adding fresh sliced mushrooms to the sausage mixture instead of using canned mushrooms, but it was still delicious! Relatively easy, a few too many dirty pans for my preference, but it was worth it. My picky toddler loved it! Thank you for the recipe!

yum, a nice pasta casserole, just what my hot sausage needed! i followed the suggestion from other reviewers about adding an extra cup of tomato sauce to this recipe. i also sauteed & stirred in a healthy teaspoon of real chopped garlic instead of using the powdered form. this dish makes a tasty leftover too. thanks george!

Very quick, easy and good.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and mixed the sauce and noodles together rather than layering.  I put in half the noodle mixture, then put down half the cheese, then repeated.  I used turkey sausage and spaghetti sauce as well.  This also makes great leftovers!

I made this last night and my family loved it. The only changes I made were to use fresh herbs and add fresh garlic with the meat and onions instead of powdered. I also made the sauce in the meat in the same pan so the flavors would blend well and I had one less pan to clean. Thanks for sharing, I will make this again!

Terrific casserole which I would make again. A few alterations...whole wheat pasta (because that's what I had on hand), 2 cloves garlic instead of powder, Sweet Italian sausage which seemed to cut down the sharp acid flavor of tomato sauces. I omitted the oregano and canned tomato products and used a jar of tomato & basil spaghetti sauce instead. I cut the salt to about 1/4 tsp. I added a bit of parmesan to an inside layer as well as on top. If making this with a pound of pasta (which I did not), I would use extra sauce as others have stated was necessary. It was just a fabulous meal.

I agree with other posters that it has too little sauce for the amount of pasta in this dish. In fact, the amount of noodles cause this to be really dry.

Excellent flavor.  Would make more red sauce next time. It was too dry, not enough for how much pasta the recipe called for.  Other than that it was great!  Would definately make again.

I thought this was great!  I didn't think the meat would be enough but it was perfect.  I added 1 1/2 cans of tom. sauce and we liked it that way.  The only thing is that it was way too salty and I used less than suggested.  Next time I'll just use 1/2 tsp.  I made this for company today and made 20 servings in 2 foil pans.  First of all for 15 adults and 6 kids I had one entire foil pan left over.  Plus there was absolutely no sauce in the pan.  I have no idea why ( I had an entire large pot full of sauce that I added).  My mom suggested using tom. pasted to kind of make the sauce thicker.  I was bummed about that part but surprisingly it still had a great flavor.  Used 4-8 oz. packs of mushrooms. just add them to the meat mixture (probably 3 would be plenty).

I added a can of Rotel tomatoes, a little more garlic powder, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, instead of celery, added 1/2 teaspoon celery seed, used 1 whole onion, less pasta and baked for only 30 minutes.  Thus the *** because I varied the recipe quite a bit after making it via as written the first time.

We really liked this.  Here are some changes I made:  We used hot Italian sausage as was recommended.  Even my 6 and 4 year olds didn't find it too hot.  It added great taste.  Also, we don't have ziti pasta, so I used some spirals - you can really use whatever you have in your pantry.  I doubled the sauce as was recommended, but didn't use it all.  If possible, I think I would add an extra 1/2 of the sauce.  I also doubled the spices in the sauce.  We are cheese lovers and could hardly taste the mozzarella even though we put 1 1/2 cups.  I would put 2 cups.  We also grated mozzarella cheese over our individual servings as a topping.  My husband is a big meat eater and would have liked more meat (I often double the meat in recipes for him) but I thought it was just the right amount.  I baked mine in a 9x13 inch dish and didn't bother repeating the layers - just did one layer of each, ending with the Parmesan on top.  I left it uncovered for about the first half, then covered with foil.  I would make this again.  It's a nice, flavourful change from ground beef dishes.

I made this according to the recipe and found it tasted good but needed more sauce.   It was just pasta, meat and cheese as far as I'm concerned.

I doubled the recipe and prepared it the day before. Great for a large crowd.  Adjust cook time to approximately 2 1/2 hours.  I bumped up the temp to 375Â° for the last hour and a half.

Great pasta bake! We skipped the mushrooms, and I think next time, would either add chopped bell pepper to the veg, or sub it entirely for the celery. 
If you don't have or like Italian sausage, ground beef makes a delicious alternate. 
20 -30 minutes is plenty of baking time - take it out whenever the cheese on top is browned.

I gave it 4 stars, because I changed it a bit.  I sliced the sausage instead of taking casing off, cooked it then cooked the onions, fresh garlic and added a red & yellow bell peppers and saute'd in the juices from the cooked sausage.  I replaced the diced tomatoes & tomato sauce with Prego's traditional pasta sauce.  It was amazing. I'm making it again for New Years.

Next time I will half  the pasta, . Then the pasta would not have been so dry. Made way too much for a family of two. I also don't see the need for layering. I could have saved a pan by mixing the sausage with the sauce.

Just made this - quite easy.   I upped the celery to 1 cup and the onion to 3/4 cup.   8 oz. can tomato sauce.  15 oz. can diced tomatoes, 1 cup fresh tomatoes chopped and 1 26 oz jar pasta sauce.  Added a little wine.  Used 8 oz. mozzarella, shredded in food processor and  1/4 parm on top.   Looks great - put in my freezer for a nice fall dinner.   Would have written this in my personal notes, but can't seem to figure out how to do this in this new web site of Allrecipes -

Wow the flavor here is fantastic! I made the following modifications: I have a household of 4 boys and a hungry dad... I used 2 pounds of mild Italian sausage, instead of mushrooms I used sliced zucchini, added 1 more small can of tomato sauce and instead of garlic powder used garlic salt as well as using 3 kinds of cheeses. Flavor was great, prep time is minimal and will use again!

I make this recipe with hot New York-style Italian sausage and 12 oz. mozzarella cheese. Also, I use about 2 cloves fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder. The amount of sauce is a little light, but it doesn't hinder the flavor. You can easily double the sauce recipe if you like yours with a little more "gravy".

Even my picky husband liked this.  I added a little sugar, maybe a couple tsp. I didn't bake it though cause I had no mozzarella, so I substituted provolone and added the pasta in the skillet.  Also, my diced tomatoes had some chilies in it which gave it quite a zing.  Thanks so much.

Rating is for the recipe as written.  Followed exactly and the finished product was edible, but pretty dry.  It  needs more sauce.  With that it would be a good dish.

After I was done with this all I had was pasta virtually no sauce with a little bit of meat, so I cooked up about another 3/4 pound of hamburger, and another can of sauce and just poured it in there. Then put in much more mozzarella, stirred it together put more parmesan on top on re baked. Turned out great. I would recommend either half the pasta or double everything else. Except for mushrooms I only used one jar. I also used sweet Italian sausage great taste.

We really loved this recipe.  My husband has asked for it now at least once a week and it has been three weeks since we made it- the first time.  We did make double the sauce as someone else suggested and used the same pan for the sausage as the sauce rather that dirty up another.  Thanks so much.  My husband actually is starting to think I can cook!

This was good, but nothing great. You definitely need to add more sauce. It makes a TON, so if you have a small family, you may want to scale it down a bit.

Didn't think there was enough sauce.  I did the layers thing, but ended up mixing everything together to try and ensure all pasta had sauce, but ended up with hard, crunchy pasta, anyway.  May try again with extra sauce next time.

I halved the recipe, used fresh mushrooms, and used onion powder for garlic powder as recommended by others.  I made it the day before cooking, and the mushrooms turned the ziti black and made it look like the ziti was molded.  Grossed people out, so don't make this dish too much ahead of time.  The bad presentation aspect is not worth a melded flavor.

I used turkey keilbasa (and just chopped it into chunks), swiss cheese, added some basil and red pepper to the sauce and used a 2 qt baking dish.  I recommend covering with foil for the first half of the baking time to prevent burning.  It was delicious!

This was a good change to how I traditionally make sausage.  I was not crazy about it, but my family liked it.  It felt that it was a little too dry and needed more seasoning.  I think next time I will add Italian seasoning, more garlic, red and green peppers, more onion and more tomato sauce.  I'll let you know how it goes!!

Excellent recipe. Thank you. I agree that it needed more sauce so I modified that. I also added fresh minced garlic to the onion and sausage. I had family in from out of town and they loved it!

I was really excited to try this dish after reading all the rave reviews.  So I made it and only changed a few things.  I didnt use celery as this just doesnt sound good with a heavy pasta dish.  I also used italian baking sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Thats it.  Everything else was as the receipe states.  It was good, but nothing to write home about. I don't think I would make it again, although it wasn't bad, it wasn't spectacular for the longer than I'd like prep time

I call this poizza pasta to get the kids to eat it. They love it and ask me for it all of the time. I ahve made several variations of this recipe and have found that the favorite is to omit the celery and mushrooms (we just don't like mushrooms), add sliced pepperoni and a little extra sauce. YUM!

I was disappointed with this recipe. I had to add a lot of sauce which, though it made the dinner better, makes the five star decieving. I like Italian sausage but I thought this recipe was pretty heavy. The basil and mushrooms were nice touches. Overall, it was ok but it definetely wasn't anything revolutionary.

This recipie is okay.  Would use more sauce and cut the bake time in half since the pasta came out crunchy.  Next time I will use bottled spaghetti sauce.

This was great. I used Hot Italian sausage, I didn't have Ziti so I used Penne I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. This was a warm and cozy Italian dinner, add a salad and some garlic bread and it's perfect. My husband couldn't stop telling me how good it was. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good.  I'm not a baked ziti fan but this was pretty darn good.  I think it could have used more sausage.  I added more sauce and didn't cook it longer than 20 min. Good recipe!

After reading other reviews I used: a good jar of spaghetti sauce, only a little over 8ozs of ziti, fresh mushrooms (yum)and chorizo sausage (what I had in the 'frig). This made a great deal of pasta and it was very good. I used a 16oz jar of sauce and next time (will make again) would use maybe half as much again. Green salad and crunchy bread, great meal.

This was very good. I did not use celery or the whole box of pasta. I used sweet italian sausage, 1 can of mushrooms, and meatless spaghetti sauce.  Next time I'll use sauce with meat.  Thanks submitter.

This was wonderful. The only thing I did different was leave out the celery because we really don't care for it. Otherwise, it was an excellent dish. Thanks for a great dish. Anne B.

This is a great base recipe. I enjoy a recipe one can work with.  I as many
others added extra sauce and cheese. I
decreased the salt to a scant half teaspoon and added hotsauce and pepper.  I also added a can of Italian
tomatoes plus a bit more Italian seasoning.  My family tends to like a
little less meat so I hope to try this
with no meat and with half the meat. I
know it will turn out yummy.  One other thing, this really does make a 
ton of food.  You will have plenty to share!!!

This is quite good, but I would make a few changes next time.  I have a wonderful sauce recipe that simmers all day and will use that for the sauce, and use more of it, I used 16 oz of mozzarella instead of 8, and use the salt to taste as I found the sauce on the salty side.  This recipe was very easy, and with more sauce and next time I'll use hot Italian sausage as other reviewers have said, I think it would go from quite good to excellent.

Read all of the reviews and took a leap of faith and made a batch for a party tonight. It was a huge success!! I doubled the sauce, sauteed fresh mushrooms and used spicy Italian sausage. The only comment that my SO (who does most of the cooking around here!) could add was he'd like more cheese next time, possibly ricotta! Enjoy!!

Yum yum in the tum tum! Fabulous recipe. I decided to use a jar of spaghetti sauce as the base and added some extra seasoning. As the sausage and diced onion cooked, I added celery seed, garlic powder, basil, Mexican oregano and a teaspoon of sugar (to cut down on the acidity).I didn't have any canned mushrooms or regular so I just chopped up on big portobella and added that while cooking. Then I put in the sauce and let it heat up a little. Added the parmesan at this point, stirred together and pour half over the ziti. Top that with mozzerella and then layered again. The kids ate this up. Even though we eat had two portions, there are tons of leftovers today. Makes a lot. Will make this again.

THis is a great recipe. I had only one can of mushrooms, but the end result was the best baked ziti I had ever made. I also grated in a little asiago cheese with the mozzerella.

I used my own leftover tomato sauce and sauted the celery,mushrooms and onion with sausage. Good and easy..
