I loved this and easy.  I had left over grilled corn and so it was some smokiness to this and instead of pimentos I added jalapeños......Yum   I  may want to try out a different cheese to this....

This casserole was a huge hit at a family gathering.  I did not have any pimentos so I substitued Ro-tel tomatoes, drained.  I will definitely do that again. Next time I will leave out the salt, if using can corn.

I didn't change a thing except I cut the recipe in half, (6 servings). I wish  I had just gone with the 12 servings. It was that good!

This recipe was delicious. Served at a family dinner and received many compliments and a request for the recipe. I cut the recipe in half and added Ortega mild green chili’s and sliced olives to the ingredients. So good!

Just made this and it came out awesome. I halved the recipe, used shredded Velveeta as opposed to cubed. Otherwise followed the recipe.

I made this the only issue was that I did not have enough corn I had to  substitute a can of creamed corn and instead of the bell peppers I added 3 jalapenos.. This as you can see made it a little creamier. It was a big hit not much leftover. Will certainly make it again.

I've made a different baked corn recipe for decades, but this one has my recipe beat, hands down. My husband loves this!  I will definitely make this over and over again!

Used poblanos instead of pimentoes (had on hand) and Velveeta queso Blanco cheese.  Delish!!  This will be a new "have to have" for Thanksgiving dinner.

Very tasty, though I'll admit I had to make a few changes.  To make it more diabetic friendly, I substituted Splenda for the sugar and reduced the amount to just half the original amount.  I didn't have any green peppers on hand, so substituted thinly sliced green onions.  And I substituted grated cheddar cheese for the processed cheese.  

It was a very interesting way to serve corn, very much like a crustless quiche.   And as one counting carbs, since it stretched the high-carb corn with lower-carb ingredients,  I could have a larger serving.  I even ate some of the leftovers reheated for breakfast.

I'll definitely be making this again and will likely use green peppers next time or perhaps a combination of green peppers and onions.  I do think that the recipe needed less salt for our taste.

This was delicious. It has an almost custard like quality to it. I cut the recipe I half and then only added a third of the sugar called for. I was afraid if I used the whole amount the casserole would be way too sweet. Also I left out all but about a teaspoon of salt.
