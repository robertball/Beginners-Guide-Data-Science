Very easy to make and yummy too!  Made a very mild flavor chili.  If you want more spice I would use a hot chili sauce or add some chili powder.

Exactly what I was looking for! This is a thick hearty chili, not soupy. Very good. Could add chili powder for a little spice but I like it as is.

The dish itself was fine.  I thought it was a too salty so I'm a bit worried how leftovers are going to taste.  Very easy to prepare, but I wouldn't recommend this dish to anyone.

It's hard to find a dish that my entire family enjoys, but I finally found one! All 3 of my kids, my husband and I love this chili. I would definitely recommend this dish. Easy and delicious!
