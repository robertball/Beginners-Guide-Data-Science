Very, very good!!  I did take the advice of previous reviews and used less sugar.   I used very ripe bananas (about 6), 1 1/2 cup sugar, 1/8 tsp ground clove, 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  The results are fabulous!  Both my girls, ages 3 & 6, absolutely LOVE this!  Will definitely be making this again!  Thank you for sharing!

Very good. I'm lazy, so I used a 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves so I wouldn't have to strain it. My kids had some warm with Peanut Butter and Co's Bees Knees peanut butter for lunch and flipped for it. I liked that this was easy enough that I didn't have to babysit it, I just had my son help me throw everything together with the pan and he was in charge of making sure it didn't burn. Nice way to use up ripe bananas. Next time, I might add a mixture of cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg. EDITED: You seriously can get by with 1/4 of the sugar called for. It really just depends on how ripe your bananas are and how strong your sweet tooth is. Now that I've made this a couple times, I like to add 1/2 c. chopped walnuts after the boiling step.

USE GROUND CLOVES, NOT WHOLE!!!! I just wasted all the ingredients and am the proud owner of three half pints of banana spiced soup because it's impossible to get the cloves out without also getting all the banana pulp after it cooks down. I really hate to rate it so low because it has good flavor but it's basically a ruined recipe as written.

My family loves this! I used ground cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg and bottled lemon juice. It's wonderful on a peanut butter sandwich, and my husband will even grab a spoonfull of it here and there. We plan to make a bunch of it and give away as Christmas gifts this year. My only question is how long the jam lasts before it gets to be too old. Does anyone know? This truly is one yummy recipe we'll make again!

Great way to use up really ripe bananas.  I added cinnamon sticks, and it came out great.  Perfect for toast, English muffins, pancakes, and of course, the good old peanut butter and jelly sandwich!  Might be a smart idea to put cloves and cinnamon sticks in cheesecloth or even a tea ball.  Straining it was easier said than done.

good, tasty.
I took the advise of serveral raters and used 1/2 the sugar and 1/2 tsp of ground cloves. My yield with the changes was 5 1/2 pt jars  I found on another site to water bath 1/2 pint jars for 7 mins  and it will keep for one year.

Lovely - just the thing for using up a glut of bananas. I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 1.5 cups of sugar and found this was just right.  I also used ground cloves (no straining) and a hint of vanilla . I simmered for only 30 minutes as the jam had thickened. I would like to know how long this jam keeps - has anyone found out?  I can see me making more of this for Christmas gifts, I can also see me making a cheat's banana ice cream by adding it to store bought vanilla ice cream.... Thanks for sharing!

This is a cool way to use up ripe bananas!  Tastes really good, but it could definitely use a bit less sugar.

I made the jam yesterday with a bunch of bananas that were on the brink of destruction.  I followed your directions most of the way.  I don't like cloves, so I  put in 1/4 tsp of ground cloves instead of the whole cloves--that was a perfect change.  Next time I might try a pumpkin pie spice to see how that works.  I also added "Ball Real Fruit Low or No-Sugar Needed Pectin" (3 rounded tbsp) which reduced the cooking time to achieve the thickness I prefer.  I added 1 1/2 c. sugar and it was still too sweet.  I'll add 3/4 c. in the future and I'm sure that will be just right.  This would be  a perfect spread for a Peanut Butter and Banana Jam sandwich.  It would also be excellent over Ice Cream.  The overall taste is that of Bananas Foster.  If you are looking for something fun and tasty to add to your cabinet, try this one.  You won't regret it. With regard to pectic purchase...it's a lot less expensive to buy the larger container of the pectin instead of the individual Surejel packets.  With the container you get about 3 times the product and can adjust it as your jam requires and it costs less then 2 times as much.  I also buy the 15 lb bag of sugar for less then double the cost of two 5 lb bags.  I have a lot of fruit trees, so I'm on my 2nd bag and the season is just about half over.  God bless you in your cooking endeavors.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

This is a good recipe . My grandkids loved it . Changed method somewhat .....Mashed the bananas together with lemon juice to stop them from going black , then  I used whole cloves and 5 sticks cinnamon , boiled them together in 3 cups water until water boiled down to one cup ( as per recipe ) , I then strained the water through a cloth to remove cloves and cinnamon sticks , added sugar to the water and stirred until dissolved  then added the mashed bananas and boiled rapidly ( covered ) for 15 minutes and it was done !! beautiful and very tasty .

Who knew there was such a thing as banana jam??  Ok so I used a little under 3.5 cups (13 small sized bananas).  I cut the cloves WAY down because cloves can be very over powering.  I used 1tsp cloves, 1tsp cinnamon, and 1/2tsp nutmeg.  I cut the sugar to 1 cup total.  Followed the boiling and mixing directions and then I popped this into my crockpot on low for 6 hours.  It made a total of 2 pints for me.  Lowering the cloves and adding the other spices worked for me.  You still get the banana-y goodness with a hint of spice undertone.

I made 1/3 of the recipe as a test run.  It was delicious.  I used all the sugar and will cut back on it next time.  I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg like some other suggested.  I look forward to having some brown bananas again soon so I can make a full batch of this jam.  It is so good with peanut butter on toast!  Great recipe!

This is a BIG hit with the kids!! They only 2 things that I have changed is adding less sugar ( 2-2 1/2 cups is what I add). Also I switched to ground cloves instead of whole. Also added cinnamon and nutmeg for an added twist. 
Goes GREAT with peanut butter or even nutella. :-)

This is so good.  I wasn't sure if it would work but I used ripe frozen bananas that I had been saving (thawed them first) and it turned out fine, a great way to use them up.  At the suggestion of others I also added 1/8 tsp. of allspice, ground cloves and nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I never cut back on the sugar since it was the first time I made it but next time I will cut it back some as it's very sweet.  None the less it is very good and I'll make it again.

It seemed a bit thin as I was pouring it into storage containers but it thickened up nicely once it cooled. This was so sweet and I only used a third of the amount of sugar. I love bananas and I really liked this even though it was so sweet but no one in my house would eat it. I ended up using it to make banana bread. Best banana bread ever.

I was looking for a way to use ripe bananas and found this very tasty on a english muffin. I cut the sugar with in half and added half with stevia sweetener. I loved the taste of how the ground cloves came through.

SOOOOO GOOD!! I cut the sugar down to 1c. 
I made a large batch and gave it away to friends and coworkers as gifts in little mason jars and everyone loved it!

I was also able to use up a ton of frozen bananas which was great! I just let them fully thaw and drain in a strainer to avoid excess water.

This is so easy and everyone loves it!  I added nutmeg and a dash of cinnimon to mine and it was the best I have ever had.
