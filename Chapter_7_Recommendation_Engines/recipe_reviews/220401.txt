This is one of the most fantastic crepes I have ever tried! The ingredients are measured out perfectly and I can remember my trip to Paris immediately when I taste them. Well done with the toppings and nice work. A treat for breakfast

Yum! Used 1c bisquick, 3/4c almond milk, & 2 eggs to make the crepe batter. Only used one pan and lots of ingredients leftover to make more tomorrow!

I was craving something with Nutella so I gave this a try. They were delicious. I did not add bacon because I do not have any but they were great either way. The only other time I had tried crepes was at IHOP and I did not care much for them so I was hesitant and only made half a batch, should of made the full recipe. While warming the bananas for my husbands, I added a few pecans for crunch and they were even more delicious. He even loved the crepes themselves without any topping. Will be making these regularly from now on

Made this recipe and it brought me back to France when I was there in 2009.  We went to a French bistrio and had these amazing crepes and these were in the same League.  The only thing missing was the  cappuccino, so next time I'll couple the crepes with a steamy cappocino sprinkled with cinnamon.   Loved the crepes!

I made this for a surprise breakfast for my teenage kids. They were skeptical about the combo of bacon and sweet but loved it! The few I made for my son, I ran out of peanut butter so topped with a scoop of peanut butter cookie dough ice cream. They have requested I make this again, told them maybe as a back to school treat next fall since this should be a once in a while thing
