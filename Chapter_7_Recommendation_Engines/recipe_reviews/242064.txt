This is an awesome rub! Coat your ribs a couple of hours ahead of time, wrap in tinfoil, wait... start an indirect charcoal grill, place foil wrapped ribs off to the side of the heat and cook for 2 to 2-1/2 hours. Remove ribs from foil and slather with your favorite BBQ sauce ( hopefully altered by you or made from scratch!) I like to lightly char the sauce 3-4 times recoating after each char, re coat one last time and bring them in to serve! Best. Ribs. Ever.

Super easy to make. My pork spare rubs tasted great. Wasnâ€™t sure why onion powder was listed twice so I only added 1 tablespoon.
