It is a terrible shame that this recipe's first review ever got it only 1 star, because there's nothing wrong with this recipe. The sauce does thicken tremendously, yes--but if that reviewer had followed through with the recipe, she'd have found out that when the thickened sauce is combined with the juicy fruit, it makes a nice juicy sauce! I made the sauce & added it to my grapefruit sections, then put it in the fridge while I did other things. A few hours later when I came back to it, the thick sauce has mixed with the grapefruit's natural juices to make a thin sauce. Then I added my mandarin oranges and pineapple (didn't have grapes) but didn't bother draining them, as I like the juice! But the sauce does work as written, tastes great, and if grapefruit wasn't such a PITA, I'd make this again :-) (BTW, anyone sectioning grapefruit, it is well worth your time to google how to do that.)

This fresh fruit salad was quick, easy, and refreshing. I will make it again. I think the sauce turns out if you don't boil it very long or very hard.

I was looking for a refreshing brunch fruit salad and decided to try this.  I thought it was really good!  I do think that you have to be careful not to cook the syrup too long or it will thicken too much.  I used fresh oranges instead of mandarin oranges.  I will use this again!

I'm not sure what happened to the sauce.  I guess I over-thickened it.  I had to throw it out because it was quite solid.  The recipe sounded good, just wish it had worked out better.
