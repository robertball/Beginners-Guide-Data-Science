Be forwarned:  This needs 8 oz. not 3 oz. of cream cheese!  With 8 oz, it is a great spin on the classic, otherwise it's fatally flawed and tastes like sugar wax.

Beautiful frosting.  Delicious and spiced just right.  Three cups of powdered sugar was just right for me too, not four, and my 5-star rating reflects that change.  I used this frosting to frost "Beer Spice Cake," also from this site, made into cupcakes. Perfect.

The allspice really adds to this otherwise ho-hum frosting recipe. I used it on the Apple Cinnamon Pecan Cake from this site. What a treat! Thanks V Monte!

I use the 8 oz of cream cheese also- makes it thicker but still spreadable. I find if I add the milk 1/2 TBS at a time, it turns out perfect. Monte- this is a fabulous frosting!

as written, this frosting is so-so.  i don't think theres enough cream cheese, and way too much sugar.  i modified by using 8 oz cream cheese and 2 cups of sugar and found those proportions to be perfect.  i used them to ice a pumpkin spice cake and the flavor combo was wonderful.  thanks!

Wonderful! However, I agree that it should say one 8 oz. package of cream cheese instead of one 3 oz. With a 3 ounce package, you can't even taste the cream cheese! Thank goodness I test-tasted it though! I used it to frost Lite Carrot Cake. It was a smashing combination! It was still super rich even though I used Neufchatel Cheese. YUMMY! I would make it again, but I'm afraid I will eat it all.... :(

I prepared recipe as written using Penzey's allspice and Philly cream cheese.  The allspice darkens the frosting slightly.  The taste was okay, but I honestly didn't love it.  Maybe the Penzey's allspice is too strong in flavor.  I guess I prefer traditional cream cheese frosting.

I loved the taste of this frosting.  My only peeve is that I do not like very sweet frosting.  I was very apprehensive to add 4C of conf. sugar.  I added the sugar to the mixture 1/2C at a time and I ended stopping at 3 1/2C of conf. sugar.  It was plenty sweet for me.  The consistency was a tad watery with less sugar at room temperature so I chilled it in the fridge before spreading on my cake.  Worked like a charm.  Give this a try on the Lite Carrot cake on this site.  A winning combination that's sure to please.

Great frosting! I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups though which i thought was sweet enough. And i didn't have allspice, so i used a combo of cinnamon, nutmeg and a pinch of ground cloves. Tastes amazing.

I give this recipe 4 stars as written, 5 stars with my changes.  I took the advice off other reviewers and used 8 oz. cream cheese and only 3 cups confectioners' sugar.  I found that I didn't need to add any milk.  The consistency was perfect for piping onto cupcakes.  I piped them onto "Pumpkin Ginger Cupcakes" from this site and the combination is amazing!  I was in the mood to try something different and I'm so glad I did!

I used 8 oz. cream cheese and only 3 cups confectioners' sugar. I found that I didn't need to add more than 1T of milk. I had enough for all 2 dozen cupcakes. Delicious, spiced just right and perfect! The consistency was perfect for piping onto cupcakes. I piped them onto "Pumpkin Ginger Cupcakes," also from this site. The combination of the cream cheese and pumpkin ginger cupcakes are amazing!

This frosting is so good!!!  I actually didn't have any allspice, so I went and bought some so that I could make this frosting.  I used it on the gingerbread cupcakes, and this was the perfect topping.  Followed the recipe exactly and the consistency worked very well for piping.  My husband was eating this straight from the bowl.

Used 8 oz of cream cheese and also added 1 tsp of cinnamon extract...only used 3 cups of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  This frosting is really yummy :)  My sister said the frosting really brought out the spicy-ness of the spiced cupcakes!

Wanted to modify this recipe to make it more of a dip --- so a little lighter, a little less intense.  I used 8 oz cream cheese, cut out the butter, easily halved the sugar.  Added cinnamon and nutmeg.

I didn't use the milk because the frosting was already thin ... I used all the 4 cups of powdered sugar and then put it in the fridge to solidify a bit.  The taste was great. I did add 6 oz of cream cheese because it tasted a little like buttercream.

Yummy! I followed the recipe pretty much except added 1/2 a tsp of allspice and then a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon instead of using all allspice. And we heavily frosted 30 cupcakes and had 2 cups left, so it makes a lot!

What a great frosting!! I used it on a carrot cake I made for my mothers birthday. I also followed anothers suggestion and used 8oz of cream cheese instead of the 3 the recipe calls for, added a little more milk & confectioners sugar and everyone loved it. I didn't save the recipe at first, & had to search for it when I made carrot bars for a picnic, you can be sure I've saved the recipe now!! Thanks!

YUM! The best cream cheese frosting I have ever tasted.  The allspice adds such a great kick to the frosting, and it went perfectly with the Best Carrot Cake Ever recipe from this site.  I'm drooling just thinking of it!

I cut the recipe in 1/2 and used 4 oz. of cream cheese (I do think that the 3 oz. must be a typo), and I only used 1 1/3 c. of powdered sugar.  I also had to do the sub for allspice, using cinnamon, ginger & cloves.  I also added a dash of nutmeg, the end result was very tasty & made a nice frosting for A-Number-1-Banana Cake.  Thanks for your recipe V!

WAY TOO MUCH SUGAR!  All I tasted was sugar, and I used 8 oz. of cream cheese. Next time I will try it with half the sugar if not less.

I love this recipe, although I did modify it a bit. I put at least 4oz. of cream cheese, sometimes more, and only 3 cups of icing sugar, otherwise it's way too sweet. It goes amazing with "Spice Cake II" from this site. Just make sure to taste it frequently as you're mixing.

Used this frosting with the Best Ever Carrot Cake and it was excellent.  However, need to double the recipe if you split the cake layers like I did.  Also, instead of using milk I had some whipping cream on hand that needed to be used so I used it instead.  Made the icing very creamy.  Served to company and they just raved about it.

This is the best cream cheese frosting I've ever tasted.  I used it on an apple spice cake and had left overs which stored really well for a week.  I then used it to frost Holiday Sugar cookies and the frosting was a perfect compliment.  I love this recipe.

Oh my goodness, is this ever good.  I am a HUGE fan of anything with cream cheese in it and this will be a new favorite.  I used 4oz fat free and 4oz regular.  So good and so easy.  A great option for spice cakes, pumpkin bars (or rolls) or carrot cake.

Great Stuff!  Although I think it's a typo where it says 3 oz package of cream cheese.  I had to use an 8 oz package to get the consistency I needed.

You have to play around with the liquids a bit but that's true of ALL frostings. For flavor this is exceptional -- I used lemon juice in place of milk as I do in all cream cheese frostings, to preserve the tang of the cream cheese. Thanks for sharing!

I used this frosting to put on some vanilla cupcakes and it was great.  The frosting was the best part and I could put it on so many things.  It was easy to make and had the taste of fall.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great frosting! As many others did I used it to top Pumpkin Ginger Cupcakes. The consistency turned out to be more of an icing than frosting. I took others' suggestions and increased the cream cheese to 8 oz. Next time I will follow the recipe exactly. If you're looking to frost using a pastry bag, I suggest only using the 3 oz of cream cheese.

Very good with apple spiced cake. I used about 6 oz of cream cheese and 1lb of powdered sugar, also added about 1/2 cup of applesauce. Added vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.

Good frosting, although I had to reduce the sugar to 2 cups instead of four. I also didn't add the other tablespoon of milk as it was already thin enough and I didn't want it much thinner. I'm putting it on the Beer Spice Cake recipe on this site and topping it off with walnuts... mmm, I can't wait until the cake's finished cooling!!

Wonderful and easy frosting!  Yes, one 8 oz. package of cream cheese.  I didn't have allspice so I used some pupmpkin pie spice I had.  Allspice is a mixture of cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg so I think you could add a little of each depending on your taste also.  I didn't have any powdered sugar on hand either so I just took regular sugar and placed in my Vitamix, added 1 T. of corn starch and blended into powder. It turned out perfect!  I used only 3 cups of the sugar and it was just right.  I also did not need to use any milk.  When chilled, it does harden, just take out a few minutes before you want to use it and whip it with a fork and it will be spreadable again.  I keep it in a bowl in the fridge rather than frosting a whole cake or loaf...that way everyone can add as much as they like.  I'll be making this again to use with many other deserts!

So great you'll want to eat it with a spoon instead of frosting a cake. Went great with the Spanish Bar Cake on this site. Also great as a dip for Molasses Cookies - could add a little extra powdered sugar and use as an icing for cookies. Used 8 oz. cream cheese and about 3 cups powdered sugar.

This frosting was really good. The only thing I changed was I halved the sugar (or else it's too sweet for me) and I used 1/4 tsp pumkin pie spice, 1/4 tsp apple pie spice, and 1/4 tsp allspice and that made it really tasty. I used it on the Fourteen Carat Cake from this site. Yum!

This was very tasty. My daughter and I were eating the leftover frosting from the bowl. I had to make myself stop. I used 8 oz of cream cheese and added the sugar a little at a time and found that I only needed 3 cups of sugar and never even had to add the milk at all. Very creamy and I had a ton left over after frosting the cake. I used this on the Spiced Banana Cake from this site (such a great combo). Thanks!

I enjoyed this frosting very much. I didn't find it to be runny at all. As long as you slowly add in your milk and vanilla. I would add more cream cheese, maybe 4 or 6oz instead of 3oz. All in all a nice frosting for Carrot cake.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because I modified it and am not sure how it would taste as written.  I used an 8 oz pkg of  light cream cheese and only 3 cups of sugar...and no milk.  It was delicious on carrot cake....definitely a keeper. *Update:  I used this almost as written - a tad less sugar and 1 T milk - as a frosting for banana cake.  It was very delicious, although I wished there was a bit more for covering the cake thicker.  Everyone loved it.

YUM!!!  I used it to top an easy spice cookie recipe I've been using for years (1 box spice cake mix, 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup Crisco, 1 egg-bake at 350 for 11 minutes).  Took the frosted cookies to a Christmas Sing at my son's pre-school and they were gone in minutes...people said they were the best cookies on the table!  Will definitely use again and again - thanks V for sharing!!!

I used 8 oz. of the lite cream cheese and although the icing was delicious, it didn't have as much of a "cream cheese" taste as some others I've tried.  The allspice gave it a nice touch and I'll probably use it again for variety.  Thanks for sharing.

This has become my standard cream cheese frosting.  It's very light and fluffy.  I leave out the spices when I frost some cakes.  As is it is delicious on cinnamon rolls!

With some modification, this frosting is great.  I agree with other reviewers that you need a whole 8 oz block of cream cheese.  I tried the frosting after using 3 oz and it was WAY too sweet (at least for my taste).  The extra 5 oz made it wonderful.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon more allspice and it still wasn't overpowering.  I think I found my go-to cream cheese frosting recipe!

This was a great recipe I used on a carrot cake. I more than tripled the allspice in mine and the flavors meld together wonderfully. I will use this again, especially on a carrot cake.

I used this recipe as a base because I was looking for a frosting recipe for a spice cake, and this sounded good.  I only had 4 oz. of cream cheese left, so that is what I used along with 1/3 cup butter, and probably about 3 cups of confectioners'sugar. (I didn't really measure it, just kept adding until consistency was right)  I didn't add any milk, but did add the vanilla and allspice.  Then, I decided to stir in some finely chopped pecans, and it was delicious!  Perfect frosting for my spice cake!

This is an awesome frosting recipe for spice cakes!  I used it on a banana spice cake also found on this site.  I used an 8 oz block of cream cheese, and the result was a rich, creamy, slightly spiced frosting. Mmmm...  I didn't even let my kids lick the bowl this time.  It was MINE.  :)

Tasty recipe. I used this on Spiced Banana Cake and it was very good. My only complaint is that it was a bit too runny, but once you refrigerated it, it hardend up a bit.

This icing tasted fantastic with Sam's Famous Carrot Cake (on this site).  I omitted the milk altogether, as the frosting was easily spreadable without it.  If you stir everything together at room temperature (completely softened), you won't need the milk.   Other than the milk omission, I stuck to the recipe and it turned out great!

It tasted good, but it wasn't the consistency I was looking for.  I used 8oz of fat free cream cheese and cinnamon instead of all spice. I added only one tablespoon of milk.  Next time I won't add the milk, it was a bit on the runny side. It tasted really really good though! Just need a bit of tweaking for our tastes.

I made this frosting with cinnamon instead of allspice (I hate allspice), used fat free cream cheese and soy milk (son is allergic to dairy), and put it on the Lite Carrot Cake on this site. I had to use a bit more sugar than suggested but it eventually came out great.  This will be my staple cream cheese frosting.

I made this for the Spanish Bar Cake recipe you can find here, and it was a wonderful icing.  We like cream cheese, so I used 8 oz. of cream cheese, and omitted the butter it called for.  It turned out very well and this is how I will be making it from now on.

Very good frosting! I used it with the Lite Carrot Cake recipe also at this site. I used 2-8 ounce packages of Neufchatel cream cheese, and instead of allspice I just used cinnamon. Frosting turned out very creamy, and not as thick as regular cream cheese frosting. Everyone loves it!

Devilishly good!  I did make a couple small changes.  Took PATRINCIA's advice on  Penzey's All Spice possibly being stronger than the norm, so I cut that to 1/2 tsp.  Used a full 8 oz brick of Neufchatel.  And, cut the sugar to 1 3/4 cup.  Thanks! Awesome complement to the Spiced Banana Cake!

Giving this 4 stars for the idea. My standard cream cheese frosting doesn't have milk, and uses a 8 oz package of cream cheese. But I love the idea of putting allspice, or other spices into the frosting. It's great on a spice cake!

This was VERY good, I just now realized that someone said it needs 8 oz not 3 oz of cream cheese...I used only 3 oz and it was quite runny...I added a splash of orange extract and it really added a little something to it!

Excellent!!!  All of our guests loved this frosting.  They were scraping the bowl hoping for more.  I used it on carrot cake this time but it be incredible on home made cinnamon rolls or as icing on iced raisin bread.

I will never use another frosting on spice cakes again!  I did thin mine with a little milk, and now I wish I hadn't.  Don't use it unless yours doesn't look spreadable.

I am only giving this 4 stars cuz I am not sure how it would be with only 3 oz of cream cheese.  I followed other reviewers' advice and made it with 8 oz of cream cheese and it was way too GOOD!!  I also only put in 3 cups of p. sugar.  I put this on 'Grammy Burnham's Molasses Cookies' from this site and it was sooooo goood!!!  I took them to work and absolutely everyone loved them!!  I will definitely use this frosting on all my spice/carrot cakes, etc.!!!

This frosting is great, especially on the "Best Carrot Cake Ever" recipe also on this site.  I typically use an 8oz brick of cream cheese since my husband likes a more tart taste.

Instead of using (4) 3 oz cream cheese, I used(2) 8 oz. I also substituted the allspice w/cinnamon. I spread this frosting on top of a zucchini cake and it was absolutely delicious. I would make this again!

This is a great frosting, expecially for red velvet cake. I left out the all spice, and just made plain old cream cheese frosting. Although it was so thick it burnt my blender out (I had to trash it), it was great. First time making home made frosting, and I absolutly loved it.

For fear of bouncing off walls with cake & coffee, as others noted I lowered sugar (1.5 c) and bumped up cream cheese (about 2/3 of 8 oz pkg, that’s all I had). Used a butter substitute, cut that back a little too.  Used tsps of milk until I got the thinner consistency I wanted.   Covered a 9 x 13 pumpkin cake perfectly.

Delicious spread over an applesauce spice cake. Just enough spice to give an ordinary cream cheese icing that "something special." If you don't have allspice, substitute 1/4 tsp each cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves (or to taste) to equal the 3/4 tsp of allspice the recipe calls for. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Always read the reviews for any recipe you decide to make.  This called for 3 oz. of cream cheese.  It really needs 8 oz. (which is one block).  Otherwise this recipe was very good.  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar top of my frosted pumpkin spice cake to make it more festive looking for Thanksgiving.  This frosting was good on it.  I would make it again.

I was looking for a cream cheese frosting recipe and saw the title of this one.  I made it with 8 oz of cream cheese and one stick of butter plus the sugar and vanilla.  I wasn't reading the recipe at the time, so I used a 1/2 tsp of the allspice.  It wasn't really enough.  I added enough to have the flakes show in the frosting.  Per my brother, it tasted really good but the allspice was not overwhelming.  I frosted the Pumpkin Ginger cupcakes from this site.   I squeezed out enough frosting to cover 26 out of my 30 cupcakes.  Maybe I over frost?  In fairness, I don't like cream cheese, so I did not taste it myself.  Bro said that I can make it again.  That says it all.

I made this exactly as written and found I needed to add about double the allspice to really give it flavor and the cream cheese flavor got lost in all the powdered sugar and it did not maintain it's shape while sitting at room temp.

I made this frosting to go with a spice cake I made. It was fantastic. I doubled the amount of cream cheese and added a bit more milk to smooth it out more (because of the extra cream cheese), but it was so yummy. Everyone loved it!

I added 8oz of lite cream cheese, the consistency looked better.  I personally thought it was too sweet, but my bf couldn't stop dipping his fingers in.  Worked very nicely for the low-cal carrot cake I made.

Wish I could rate this higher. Amazing icing and not overpowering allspice like I thought it would be. I used this to frost beer cupcakes also on this site and a red velvet cake. 2 cups icing sugar was plenty and used 8oz cream cheese. I now want to try this with the Spanish bar cake.

Delicious frosting! I only used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar but otherwise I followed just as written. I used it to top the Old Fashioned Gingerbread on this site. Perfect combo!

I used the 8 ounce package of cream cheese and cut the confectioners sugar to three cups like most suggested.  I also only added milk as needed while blending and it turned out fantastic.  I used these on the Pumpkin Ginger Cupcakes recipe I found on this site and it paired beautifully.  Thanks so much for a nice new twist on a cream cheese frosting!

Amazing!  I also upped the cream cheese to 8oz, but kept the powdered sugar at 4 cups, and no one here thought it was too sweet at all.  With the increased cream cheese I didn't feel it needed any milk.  Would have given it 5 stars if it had originally read 8oz cream cheese.  I used this to frost the Pumpkin Ginger Cupcakes from this site...was a hit at my Thanksgiving supper :)

I did make some changes. I used a whole brick of cream cheese, used 1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt instead of butter, and only ONE cup of confectioners sugar. It is VERY SWEET! Even with cutting the sugar so much. Also it was quite runny (due to Greek yogurt I'm sure) so I added a bit of cornstarch just to thicken. Because we don't like super sweet I will probably add another brick of cream cheese. Overall great idea, but definitely for those with a sweeter sweet tooth :-)

Made this for a Gingerbread cake.  Only made a half batch, had to add an extra tablespoon of milk though, was thick and clumpy.  Also used pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice since that's what I had. Turned out very nice.

This is very good.  I wasn't paying attention and put in 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of allspice.  I was nervous that I had ruined it but it is delicious.  I also used 8oz of cream cheese as another user suggested.  Great recipe.  Thanks!
