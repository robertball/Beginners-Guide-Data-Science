This soup is delicious!!!...I added a quarter of a chopped onion. I melted the butter in the pan and while it was melting I sauteed the onion and garlic in it until the onion was translucent. Then I added the chicken stock. I used pecorino cheese gnocchi and the soup turned out to be a keeper!!!... I'm working on a second batch as I had two packages of gnocchi.

I made this soup for the first time last night and really enjoyed it.  As far as soups go, this was filling without being heavy. I will definitely make it again.  *A small adjustment was made to use mini potato gnocchi as that was what was in my pantry*

This is a very simple but satisfying soup.  It can be tinkered with based on what you have in your pantry/freezer.  The herbs used can be fresh or dried.  Instead of gnocchi, noodles, rice, or even tortellini can be subbed in.  I also added a can of canellini beans, a chopped scallion instead of onion and some rosemary.  I omitted the corn.  Served with some crusty bread and butter and it's a wrap!

I thought it was a little heavy on the garlic. I left out the spinach to make it a little more attractive to the youngest kid.   we enjoyed it
