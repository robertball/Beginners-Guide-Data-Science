I liked it but I also made a lot of changes. I used up the tomatillo slow-cooked pork, braised cabbage, and tomatillo sauce I had in my fridge. I used bacon grease instead of lard or shortening. I used cornmeal instead of masa harina, since that was all I had. I also added some homemade vinegary hot sauce at the end, because we like it spicy and I loved the added zip that we got from it. My husband really liked it a lot. Next time, I would add even more vegetable toppings than I did this time and treat it like a mexican-style pizza. I've never made anything like this before, but it was a pretty easy way to use up my leftovers and made them taste even better, cooked the second time.  I will make this kind of thing again.
