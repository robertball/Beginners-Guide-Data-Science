Ok, so it takes a bit of work to make--it's not hard by any means, just takes a while. But it's definitely delicious! The flavor is just fantastic! I halved the recipe and it worked great. Took 3 hours to cook. I also don't have a grill pan, so I just crisped the skin in a regular skillet. The crispy skin is to die for! It is pretty rich, so a little goes a long way! Thank you for the recipe!
