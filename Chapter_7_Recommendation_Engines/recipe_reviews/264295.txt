This is a great sauce!!!  I cut the broth back to 1 cup and used bone-in center cut chops.  Boneless chops just don't have the flavor like bone-in.  This is good enough to be a 'rotation' meal, for sure!

Ingredients list is off quite a bit. Good recipe but bad directions. Too watery, too much cream and broth, too long cooking times means this has promise but your going to have to tweak the heck out if this to get it too your liking

Hubby couldn't stop saying how good this tasted & how much flavor it had. I baked it at 350 though & didn't let it cook after adding the bourbon until mostly evaporated. It reduced some, but wanted to make sure we had enough for gravy over mashed potatoes. We had to thicken the sauce when it was done baking so will have to reduce more liquid before adding the broth & cream next time.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  The flavor was phenomenal, and it was a big hit with the family.  The only thing I would change if I made it again is that I would add some flour to thicken up the sauce.  It was very thin and runny.  The flavor was so good, thought, that it made up for it.

This was stunning! I think the sauce could stand the addition of some corn starch to thicken it up, because as written it was a little thin for my tastes, but the flavors were so spectacular that I was CRAVING the leftovers all day the next day. I cannot wait to make this again.

Taste was good but the sauce was so thin like soup. After baking in oven i poured sauce into a saucepan and added cornstarch until it thickened to make a gravy and was much better once thickened

I made this tonight but was underwhelmed.  I cut back on the beef broth and cream but the sauce was still very thin.  My husband loved the mushrooms but otherwise the meal wasn't memorable.

Who ever wrote in a previous post saying more bourbon less cream is spot on!
