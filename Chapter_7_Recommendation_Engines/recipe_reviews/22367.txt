At my restaurant we serve a special, romantic dinner for two every year for Valentines Day.  This mousse is always the dessert.  It's so rich and creamy, it feels like silk in your mouth  I've lost track of the number of times I've been asked for the recipe.  Use the gelatin, it stabilizes the whipped cream.

By far the best mousse recipe I tried. I was hosting a party at which 2 pregnant ladies would be in attendance, so I went searching for a mousse recipe that called for neither alcohol or egg whites. I was delighted to have found this one and it has since become the primary mousse recipe in my home. I reduced the sugar amount ever so slightly because I like a more rich cocoa taste. I spooned it in to a huge zip loc bac and refrigerated to cool. When it came time to serve, I sliced the corner off the bottom of the bag and squeezed in to chilled martini glasses. I topped with a dollop of cool whip (dispensed the same way), a raspberry and chocolate sprinkles or chips and had a very simple, elegant presentation. It received rave reviews from my guests and my husband has not stopped asking me to make it, since.  The gelatin is, in my opinion, a necessary step to give it the perfect texture.  This is an easy to make moose that is difficult to ruin, and which will be sure to please your family and guests!

This was amazing!  it literally took only minutes to make, and was sooo fabulously chocolately...it held up well too, was still good after two days (I made it in advance for a meeting; otherwise it would never have lasted that long!)

Excellent!!! This dessert couldn't possibly be any easier to make, and it tastes phenomenal. I like to put generous spoonful of mousse into a glass, add a layer of fresh berries, then add another spoonful of mousse. Just before serving, I top it with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Yummy!

This is delicious! I doubled the recipe and it made 4+ big servings.  I added a dollop of cool whip to the top- next time I won't because it doesn't need it!  It's delicious all by itself.  Served with a few fresh blackberries.

I made this as a post-Thanksgiving dinner dessert this year. Given past reviews, I doubled the recipe, but it's so rich that the servings actually need to be smaller. However, we all loved it! A strawberry or raspberry puree on top would be a delicious garnish -- but this mousse is a 10 all by itself as it is!

I love chocolate mousse and this recipe is fantastic. For all who live in Australia where we cannot get Hershey's Cocoa Powder I used Cadbury Cocoa Powder and everyone said it was delicious!

Nice texture but I thought it had a little too much "cocoa" flavor.  It completed my four salad luncheon meal nicely.

This was the best chocolate mousse.  Not too sweet with in a pie shell.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a pie shell with whipped cream on top and some shaved chocolate.  It made the best chocolate mousse pie ever!

Great! No eggs, and ready in 30 min. I wanted an eggless recipe that I could feed my family. I reccomend doubling the recipe so you have a big serving for everyone, a 1/2 cup serving isn't enough! :)

Deeee-licious!  But four servings?  No way!  I used dessert dishes and got two servings.  In future, I'll double the recipe.  By the way, I served it with Cool Whip -- nice balance.

Over the past several weeks I have tried recipes that had that "rich" and "I-slaved-my-tush-off-for-this" look.  This one has it all!  It's good and best of all, it was EASY (yeah!).  One little trick/ hint: after you add the boiling water to the gelatin; make that in a small bowl, not a cup, take a whisk and whip that mixture like it stole something.  That helps to make it nice and smooth with no little lumps.  Plus, a stand mixer with a REALLY high setting (The one for egg whites, attachments/ whipping cream) makes it really light and fluffy.  Happy cooking!

Unbelievably easy but my luncheon guests thought I'd spent hours making it! Didn't use the vanilla to bring out a stronger chocolate taste and topped with fresh raspberries, and it was superb: THIS is my new "take to" recipe!!

This is THE mousse recipe you want to make for that rich, great chocolately flavor. Couldn't have been happier.  It always goes before any of the other desserts on the table.

Very tasty but also very rich.  I made it a second time and tried using part whipping cream and part milk to decrease the fat, but it was a disaster (too liquidy). Will stick to the original version.  Agree with the other reviews that recommended serving with something tart, like raspberries, to complement the richness of the mousse.

This was really good.   I did a low carb version by substituting Splenda for the sugar.   The only beef would be that the servings were a bit on the small side....or maybe we're just hogs!

One word: Perfect! (that's after following suggestions and cutting sugar to 1/4 cup..) 
The texture and taste are fantastic. It's amazingly rich for something without eggs/yolks. Easy, too. Will make it manymany times over again! 
(also i find that whisking the gelatin as suggested by a reviewer is unnecessary.. you just have to sprinkle the gelatin over the water evenly, and mix it a little before adding the boiling water)

I used this recipe to ice a chocolate angel food cake made from scratch and it was delicious! Everyone was asking me to make it for their birthday cakes and whatnot. The only thing I did wrong was not sifting the cocoa. There was little tiny balls of cocoa in the mousse but even that didn't ruin it for us.  Thank you for the recipe!!

I always quadruple this recipe to (almost) fill a standard size trifle dish, refrigerate for 30 minutes or more, then top with softened whipped topping, then refrigerate at least 30 minutes more before serving. My hubby says it's better on the second day which is a PLUS for a dinner party - Make it the day before you want to serve it, cover well with plastic wrap, (try to hide it in the frig from your family). It is not as sugary on the second day so I like to make it the day before I need it. Other than quadrupling the recipe I follow it as printed then add the whipped cream.   

I garnish with chocolate sprinkles on top of the cool whip or sliced strawberries around the top edge of the triffle dish. Everyone will think you are a trained chef and all will want the recipe. Best of all - this is so easy to make! 

My husband and our friends always fight over who gets to take the last of the mousse home (if there is any left) so last year I bought several nice, but inexpensive triffle bowls at a discount store, filled the bowls with this recipe and attached the recipe to the stem of the bowl. It was a huge hit for a (mostly) homemade Christmas gift for our close friends.

Awesome mousse. If you are a novice, make sure you remember to blend the gelatin in really well to make sure it's creamy. Even better if you let it harden for more than 30 mins in the fridge. Excellent mousse!

I have used this recipe for nearly 5 years. It is the BEST! I have made other, more elaborate versions of chocolate mousse but after this, there is no point. This recipe is easy and delicious. I never cut down the sugar because I like my desserts sweet. I can't go on enough. My family and friends love this.

Very good flavor!!  I have never made mousse before and thought this recipe was very easy- but I don't know why the geletin is required- I would leave it out next time.  My mousse was a great consistancy before I put the geleltin in.  I should have left it, but I didn't and the mousse ended up with gelatin chunks in it ruining the consistacy for me.  I blended it very well trying to get rid of the small chunks, but it was hopeless.  I did use a glass bowl and beaters that I put in the freezer for 15 min.

Unfortunately I didn't read the review from 12/24/03 before making this.  The little "bumps" of gelatin made it bad. But- the flavor of the mousse itself was exactly what I was looking for.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner for friends.  It was very good and had a very smooth texture.  I sifted the cocoa (Ghirardelli) prior to mixing.  I did not have any problems with "lumpy" gelatin after sprinkling evenly over the water and stirring well after adding the boiling water.  This was easy to make relative to other chocolate mousse recipes.  I also halved the sugar as recommended and found it plenty sweet.  As noted by others, the quantities are very small.  I would recommend converting the recipe to 10-12 servings if you need 8.

This recipe turned out PERFECT, and we all LOVED it!  It was even better with raspberry sauce that I made:

10 oz. package frozen raspberries (do not thaw)
1 Tablespoon raspberry juice or water
1 1/2 tsp. cornstarch
1 Tb. orange zest
1/4 c. sugar (more or less to taste)

In medium saucepan over med-high heat, cook raspberries for 5-8 minutes, turn down to medium and add sugar.  In small bowl combine juice & cornstarch to make a paste, add to raspbery mixture stirring constantly until thickened.  Add orange rind, cool.  Make ahead of time, keep in fridge, and spoon over mousse when ready to serve.  (Adapted from Lesley's Valentine Brownies with Raspberry Couli)

This was so awesome and so easy!!!  I never make mousse because normally it takes too long to not only make it but to wait for it chill for hours!  This sets in no time and is really easy and when you add some whipped cream and chocolate shavings in a nice glass dish or cup, it makes for an elegant dessert for company.  I will for sure make this again.  I thought it was pretty sweet but instead of granulated sugar, I used powdered sugar and it lightened it up a bit.

This whipped up nice and light.  The flavor was good--I liked the strong cocoa taste that others seem to have found to be too much.  I used some to fill cream puffs, which also came out nice.  This recipe is a good substitute for a traditional mousse if you don't want to use eggs.

It turned out perfect the first time and runny the second time but I think it was from using a plastic bowl instead of a chilled glass bowl.  Very rich too.  I'll cut back on the amount of cocoa next time but I still loved it.

Took this to an open house and it was a huge hit!  Multiplied the recipe by 4 and reduced the sugar a bit.  Didn't miss it...it was perfect.  Let my gelatin cool too much so I just stuck it in the microwave for a few seconds.  Topped it with cool whip and chocolate shavings..so good!

Am I the only one that thinks this is WAY too sweet?  Believe me...I LOVE chocolate, but next time I will use half the sugar.  I doubled the recipe to serve 4 adults and 2 children.  The texture was very nice.  I used a good quality Dutch cocoa (Van Leer) instead of the Hershey's.  My kids gobbled it down, but it was too sweet for the adults.  Like I said, cutting the sugar in half would make it perfect for our taste.

This was fantastic and not very difficult.  I modified to 24 servings and it made about 16 servings.  I cut sugar in half it was the perfect sweetness.  Used a sifter for the cocoa and think that helped a lot to keep out any lumpiness.  Also didn't have any trouble with the gelatin as long as it was sprinkled and stirred well.  You can make a garnish to stick in prior to serving with melted chocolate drizzled onto waxed paper and refrigerated.

I had never made chocolate mousse before, but wanted to make it for a special valentine dessert for my husband.  This recipe seemed simple and had great reviews.  Everything everyone says about it is true....it is easy, and delicious!  I made it a day ahead and stored it in a ziplock bag as others had suggested.  I made heart shaped chocolate cups (by painting the inside of Reynold's heart-shaped foil cups with melted chocolate and then chiling them and removing foil) and then piped the chocolate mousse into the cups.  I garnished with fresh raspberries, a dollop of whipped cream, and chocolate sauce swirled on the plate.  It was delicious and beautiful!!!

This mousse was easy, excellent, and impressed my dinner guests as well as my DH - it was perfect with coffee after a meal of lasagna.  I doubled the recipe and used half the sugar which served 4 perfectly.  I sifted the cocoa powder to avoid powdery lumps, and garnished with toasted almond slices and a dollop of whipped cream.  I will make this many times in the years to come, and want to try it as a cake or pie filling.

FAB-U-LOUS!!!!  I added 3 Tbs of chocolate liquer (maybe more!!), but you can use Amaretto, Creme de Menthe, Peppermint Schnaaps, or whatever tickles your fancy.  Whipping cream is very fickle, but WILL whip up to the right consistency with patience and the right environment.  You HAVE to use a glass bowl (plastic contains oil that will "flatten" the cream).  With a glass bowl and beaters fresh out of the freezer, you will have no problem.

BLAH! This did not work out for me. I ended up with chunks of unflavored gelating CHUNKS in the "mousse". Mine did not have the fluffyness, if you will, of mousse. VERY bad.

great taste, and very fluffy, but the gelatine went lumpy. the first time i tried this recipe the hot liquid gelatine started cooling very quickly, and mixing the mixture made it worse. i tried it again, but still came out lumpy. May try again. Thanks

Great recipe! I used splenda instead of sugar. I didn't add the whole amount of cocoa at first because I was afraid of having an overpowering chocolate taste, but I tasted it a few times, and did add the whole amount of cocoa called for. Very easy and tasty.

This is yummy! I've never had Chocolate Mousse before, so I don't really have a basis for comparison, but it was rich and thick. I would NEVER whip this by hand, it would take forever! I topped it with a dollop of peanut butter frosting (also on this site) and sprinkled with sugar sprinkles for Valentine's Day. Very good!

I cut the sugar in half as recommended at still found it too sweet and too much cocoa flavor.  It still was very very yummy and I served it in martini glasses.  I will try this again and try it with a little less cocoa.  It was very easy and I will use again.  I also didn't use gelatin~~just chilled the mixing bowl and mixers in the freezer.  It was slightly more liquidy than I like mousse, so I will maybe try beating it longer or maybe try it with gelatin next time....

VERY chocolaty, but just how i like it. Not overly fluffy but still nice. Used the recipie exactly, would cut down sugar if you dont like it rich. I also used Nestle Baking Cocoa, as that was all i had in the cupboard, which is quite strong.

I was a bit suspicious of uncooked cocoa in the recipe and ended up cooking the cocoa powder and sugar in a bit of milk. This also justified the amount of gelatine, which in my opinion would not have been required without the milk. 
Also the amount of cream was way too much and i ended up doubling the other ingredients to cut down on the overpowering taste of the cream. 
Overall good with modifications.

Amazing! I didn't use Hershey, I used Tulip Bordeaux and Rich's whip cream. Unfortunately after 2 days, it leaves "fat" feel in my mouth. Note to myself or anyone who need it: never use non dairy cream and use high quality cocoa powder. Can't wait to try this with Valrhona (too lazy to buy Hershey to the Supermarket) and anchor whip cream!

I made this for friends at a Valentine's dinner; they liked it but I wasn't happy with this mousse. The texture was way too stiff and not creamy enough; if I try it again, I'll cut the amount of gelatin in half. Normally, I love the taste of cocoa as opposed to the taste of chocolate (if that makes sense), but not in this recipe. The flavor was over-the-top, and combined with the texture this just wasn't great. I'll probably hunt for a recipe using melted baking chocolate instead.

I love the taste of this recipe but I thought the gelatin gave it a weird texture- I wanted fluffy and soft not jello-like (maybe I didn't mix it well enough?- I didn't use a hand mixer)  I'm going to try it with less gelatin.

I loved how simple this recipe was and how delicious the mousse tasted.  The first time I made it, it was just a bit too sweet for my taste so I cut back on the sugar second time around, as many others had suggested.  I doubled the recipe and used 2/3 cup of sugar and it was GREAT!  It got rave reviews from my family.

Super easy to make and SUPER rich.  In fact I had tripled this recipe because I was making it for 8 people and it turned out that even though everyone loved it, they wanted to take their leftovers home to eat later.  It was THAT rich.  Next time, I'll make much smaller portions and stick to the recipe's amounts.

This was good and very easy. Great dessert to serve after a heavy meal. I used half the amount of sugar called for so it was very chocolately, not sugary. Yum! Also, I tried this with the raspberry sauce another submitter suggested and I didn't like it with the mousse and neither did my dinner guests. It was too tart.

I'm undecided on this recipe; great texture, but too sweet as written. Using an electric mixer does produce a very light, fluffy mousse. It is also quite rich, but far too sweet for my taste. I even cut the sugar (based on a previous review)... I have not given up on this recipe, but next time I will cut the sugar to 1/3c at most...

Is there such a thing as too rich? Maybe this is it... It was delicious but they are not kidding when they say this serves four. I doubled because I thought a 1/2 cup portion of mousse would look skimpy in the serving dish. But, any more than that goes uneaten...

I made this recipe with Hershey's Dutch Processed Cocoa powder and it was incredibly rich and chocolately.  Very decadent!

This recipe is so easy and I've made it several times when unexpected company arrives. I have also "painted" cupcake papers with white chocolate and filled them w/the mousse. Topped with a dusting of cocoa powder and a fresh raspberry, it makes an elegant dessert.

Very good. Very rich. Almost too rich, but I'm still giving it 5-starz. It was very easy to make, and the firm set very quickly. Will make this again.

Wow this was very rich and chocolatey!! I did not use the gelatin. I used only the sugar, cocoa and whipped cream. I was hoping to get a mousse close to one I had had at a restaurant, it was not close but it was still good. I might make it again, but only for a special occassion

This has GOT to be the best chocolate mousse I've had... very rich and decadent... so smooth!  I'm going to use it as a filling and/or frosting... It's magnifique!  Only thing is... you must double the recipe, it only makes 2 small servings.

For taste and ease of preparation I'd give it a 5, but for authenticity I'd give it a 3, so 4 stars it is. It tastes similar to a really thick hot cocoa with the texture of whipped cream. As someone who loves really rich, decadent desserts and who has eaten their fair share of mousse, this one is just so-so. It really isn't so much a mousse as a chocolate flavored whipped cream. It tasted good, though, and came together nicely, so I will probably use it again as a cake filling or a garnish.

I didn't think it had emough chocolate taste, I melted a bar of bittersweet chocolate and stirred it in while mixing, that helped. Maybe it was too much sugar, I do like the texture though.
