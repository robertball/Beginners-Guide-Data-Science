I have been making this for a solid 5 years and has been a hit everytime!  But I always add something green, usually chopped green onions and place 4-5 stalk on top befor baking to make it visually appealing.  You can also add chopped can chiles or diced pimentos (in a jar) for great color.  And using low fat sour cream tastes exactly the same too.  But after 5 years, and using 3 different ovens, this dish always takes about 50-55 min. to bake, not 45 min.  Can also make ahead and refridgerate before you need to bake, just let it sit at room temperature for at least 30-45 min.  Great for making ahead for a dinner party. Be sure to print out recipes because you will get asked!

This really is very easy.  I wanted to "test drive" this dish before Thanksgiving and I have now made it twice for my husband.  It's made the cut!  We think that it reminds us of hushpuppies so we call it "Hushpuppy Casserole." The first time I made this I added the extra water from the canned corn, as suggested.  That made it overly moist.  This time I poured in only half of the corn water and we both thought the dish was better (it was a little firmer).  I agree that real butter is the best (but the first time I used margarine, and it tasted fine!) My mother-in-law suggested adding bacon, too. I find, depending on the dish, it might take longer to bake than you were planning on. Still, nothing beats this dish--YUM!

Has anyone ever made this in advance?  I'd like to make it for Thanksgiving and it would be so much easier if I could just make it the night before.  HELP!

I've made this casserole for Thanksgiving the last two years.  There is never a crumb left!  Everyone loves it.  I make it with only 3 TBSP melted butter and 1 egg, plus 1/2 cup chopped onion.  This makes it lighter and more savory. I bake it at 350 for 1 hour.  Another plus to this recipe is when I make it for Thanksgiving I double it and put it in my 9x13 Pyrex portable glass pan with a microwaveable warmer.  I make it earlier, then bring a great side dish that doesn't require valuable oven space!

I have found the best way to cook this recipe is to take 1 stick of butter and put it in a 9x12 glass pyrex baking dish.  Put it in the oven at 350 until it melts.  Swish it around until the butter covers the entire bottom of the dish.  Mix together the other ingredients (omitting the 1/2 cup of butter) and just pour over the top of the butter without mixing. This is the same concept as the cobbler recipe I have seen and used.  Then, just bake it uncovered until it puffs up and is nicely browned on the top. The butter gives it a crispy texture and is delicious.  I have doubled this recipe also.  Last time, I even added one egg and it didn't seem to really make that much difference. IT will be all gone I can guarantee it!! I think I baked mine almost an hour the last time. If yo double it, it may take a little longer.  Good Luck!

This is definitely on the top of the list of requests for dinner sides.  I have made it full fat and reduced fat and still have the same great response! I use a 1/2 cup of egg beaters, reduced fat sour cream and margarine (instead of butter). Bake at 375 for an hour and 15 minutes; it turns out beautifully. LOVE THIS ONE!!

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!! and so did everyone of our guests!  Not one drop was left! I would just add a bit less butter...I used a clean dish towel to absorb the excess oil from the butter on top when it was done.  added  grated cheddar cheese, chopped red bell pepper cause they are sweeter than the green ones..Other wise, leave the recipe like it is !  Thanks Ruthie, you done yourself good!  Happy Memorial Day , Yes !  Because of this casserole! IT is now a favorite of ours!~

This has quickly become a much-requested new family favorite! Nothing but compliments from everyone from grandparents through my very finicky husband and five children with completely different tastes in most things! ;) Last time added a bit of chopped onion into batter and crumbled bacon on top and it was a welcome addition. A recipe well worth trying! :)

My turn! I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 glass pan, which I sprayed with Pam instead of using melted butter. This was my batter: 4 eggs, beaten; two cans Mexican-style canned corn, to get the red and green pepper bits; 2 cans creamed corn; 2 packages dry corn bread mix; 2 cups of light sour cream; 1 teaspoon sugar; 1/3 cup of sharp Cheddar cheese; 1/4  teaspoon vanilla and -- because it's the holidays -- 1/4 cup light-style eggnog. Made it nice and moist.  I baked for 75 minutes and topped with more of the cheese at the 70-minute mark.  The potluck crowd loved it!

Even my picky son, who doesn't like ANYTHING new, tried this and liked it. Definitely a keeper.

We tried this later with 2lb of sage sausage cooked and crumbled into the batter before baking. Awesome is definitely the word for it.

It`s VERY GOOD!!!!
TIPS:  1)- Please use Martha White Cornbread. 2)- Do not mix it with any other than a simple spoon...If you do it will be just perfect!!!!(Not over mix).  3)-Add 4 tablespoons of SUGAR.4). It needs like 10 minutes extra cook.
5)- 100% better cold. Thanks very much RUTHIE!!!! I am very happy with your recipe.

I've been making this exact recipe for years WITHOUT sour cream and everyone always wants the recipe.  So, for those who don't like sour cream or can't eat sour cream, this recipe is pretty amazing without it!

This is a wonderful recipe! As other have suggested I did add the 1 tbs of white sugar and a touch more butter.  For the reviewer who asked could it be put together the night before.  Certainly!  I did it and it came out beautifully and very tasty.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I have been asked to prepare this delicious dish for Thanksgiving!  Try it.. Marty

Yummy!  This was my favorite side dish as a child.  Nothing beats a corn casserole made with fresh corn- the milk from the cut kernels provides an amazing flavor that just can't be duplicated. But this recipe is quite tasty, and it is easy enough that a youngster could be assigned to make it.  If you follow this recipe, you get a dense casserole that can almost be served like a cornbread.  Because I prefer the lightness of a corn souffle, I really cut back on the cornbread mix and used maybe 3/4 of a 6.5 oz package of Betty Crocker corn muffin mix.  I also used frozen corn instead of canned because their texture is more like that of fresh corn, and I probably used 1/4 cup more corn than the recipe called for.

I always make this just as directed, using only the ingredients stated.  This is a great recipe, easy and delicious.  My extended family always demands this for any dinner we have, and they always say it's the best ever.  I do not understand how people can say things like, "You have to really like corn to like this." Are you kidding me?  IT'S A CORN CASSEROLE.

Very easy, but you really have to love corn to love this dish.  I added some chopped onion (and used low fat sour cream), but it was still a bit bland.  I will probably not make it again.

I have made this for 15+ years now and it is always requested at family functions. Over the years, I have begun using french onion dip instead of sour cream for extra flavor and add a 1/4 c. sugar as well. It is a great side dish at the holidays.

I made this instead of baked corn for Thanksgiving and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it could be a little sweeter.  I think fresh corn would be better than can, too.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for about 55 minutes and it was cooked in the center.  I will probably make this again with the addition of a little sugar.

WOW!! This recipe amazed me! Economical,quick, and yummy! Followed the recipe except for a handful of sharp cheddar I threw in with the batter. For the record, I was really disappointed with the dish when I first tasted it. It had just come out of the oven and was still pretty soupy. After it got to room temp it had set much better. From now on, I will make this early in the day so it will be ready for dinner. Room temp was the ticket for me!

I made this for our block party and everyone asked for the recipe!  I added 1/3 Cup Sugar, 1 can diced green chilis and 1/3 cup chopped cilantro.  Great flavor and good with Mexican food.  Note-Needs to cook much longer if you double the recipe.  Very easy & I will make again.

Great recipe for many types of dinners or parties.  I always add "something green".  Either minced green pepper, minced jalapeno, cilantro or chives.  It adds some color and flavor. Some other additions through the years have been Bacon (pepper bacon is best), some shreaded cheddar cheese, or a little bit of extra corn bread mixture on the top for crunch.  In the summer time, I've used fresh corn to mix in and I always use the low fat sour cream - lastly, I've never found this to cook in less than 50-60 minutes.  Give it some extra time to get a slight crust on top and check it in the middle to be sure it is cooked through and set - otherwise it is not very good.  It is also great for leftovers!

I made this for an end of the year cookout.   I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 by 13 pan.  I left a little in the bowl because it seemed a bit too much for the pan.  It was far better than anything this simple has a right to be!  I am definitely going to add this to my Thanksgiving repertoire.

Wow, this is good stuff! The title says it all... awesome and easy.
I started out with Marie Callendar's Original Cornbread Mix, which, IMHO... is the best out there. I found out I was out of whole corn, so I just went ahead and used 2 cans of creamed, cutting the sour cream by half. Added 1/2 can diced green chiles and baked for 1 hour. Perfect.
Ruthie, thank you so much for this delicious, comfort food recipe... my hubby starts drooling each time I tell him it's on the menu! LOL

I have made this several times now, its definately a family favorite.  I LOVE this.  The second time I made it, I was out of sour cream and didnt know it so I substituted with mayonnaise and it turned out delicious.  My family prefers the mayo version, which is slightly sweeter and my Mom and Dad make the sour cream version which is a little tangy.  Both ways are sooo good.  Highly recommend this one.

Good & Super Easy. I added about
1/2 cup chopped sweet onions. This recipe is also much better using fresh or frozen corn.

I rate very few recipes especially if I alter them in any way because it is not fair to the submitter. BUT - this recipe is a KEEPER! I have had this once before in my life at a pot luck and I loved it but never tried to make it. Then I was asked to bring a corn side dish to a family get together, I didn't want to do a throw frozen corn in the microwave kind of thing so came here to see what I could see. This one caught my eye, decided to try it. WOW! Simple ingredients, so easy to put together - one bowl - one spoon - one pan. Followed the recipe exactly as written, doubled as the submitter suggested. Made and baked the night before then slipped into the oven when I arrived at my Dad's house just to warm it through. Came out perfectly moist and delicious. Everyone wanted the recipe and even my picky husband (who prefers the old frozen corn in the microwave :)) LOVED it. Thank you LETSGGGO - this is going to be one of my "go to" sides from now on.

This is an excellent recipe.  I've made it for a while and it is actually called spoon bread and the recipe is from Jiffy.  You can go to jiffy.com and get a free recipe book that comes with this recipe.  Definely a crowd pleaser.

Amount of butter can be reduced by 1/2 and still be excellent.

OH MY GOODNESS...I've made this three times before writing this, I'm hooked on this recipe!!  It's as easy as can be, as buttery and creamy and truly delightful.  It is even wonderful as leftovers for a brunch.  Please do not even think about using margarine instead of butter, it just wouldn't do this recipe justice.  I am craving it now, as I write this!  A keeper in my recipe box and one to pass down to my daughter...she's only 1!!  enjoy!

This is one that's worth the buildup.  Just delicious.  I cut fresh kernels off the cob (cook 10mins before putting in).  Made it to recipe Saturday, everybody loved it. Doubled it, added 2 more eggs on Sunday, people cleaned out the pan.  Recipe is more like custard inside, 2 more eggs is firmer but still moist.  Both are excellent.

I always dice a whole white onion, green and red peppers and sautee in with the butter before adding with the other ingredients.  The additional flavor takes this comfort food up a notch!

Well I just did a test run of this recipe this evening as I plan on taking it to a family Easter gathering Sunday.  Followed the ingredients listed, but felt it needed something else.  So I decided to add a can of diced green chilies and some cheese to the batter.  Smells awesome!!  Letting it cool down a bit before serving.  ***Update with Star Rating*** The tasting results are in - it was "ehhhh"...nothing to write home about.  Very heavy.  Definitely needed A LOT of spice (more than what I added when I deviated from the recipe a tad) as opposed to none as the recipe is written.  As my fiance said...it was a one note dish, very monotonous (corn corn corn corn and a little hint of cheese).  I can only imagine what would have been like without the cheese and green chili addition.  Probably wont make this again, unless I'm in a corn pudding kinda mood.

I decided to try this recipe for Thanksgiving. I have made it three times already! The first time I made it according to the original recipe. I thought it was a bit to bland and chunky. So, I decided to change it according to some of the suggestions given. I added 1/4 cup butter (instead of half a cup), 1/2 cup sugar and ommitted the one can of whole kernel corn. It was absolutely FANTASTIC! Almost like the "corn tamalito" from Chevy's or El Torito restaurant! The other version I made was to use 1/2 cup of yogurt instead of the one cup of sour cream and parmesan cheese on top. This was also delicious but more moist. I can't wait to make it again!

Great recipe!  We love Corn just not canned corn.  
CHANGES: used frozen corn---steam bag then put it in an empty can for measuring.   Used 2/3 of frozen tube southern style white sweet cream corn.  Smothered 1/2 sweet vidallia onion and 1/3 red bell pepper in the butter ...added to mixture once cooled.   Used Jiffy cornbread mix.   Mixed the night before then refrigerated till morning.  Baked the net day (am).

This is "oh my gosh" good! We ate it cold for breakfast the next day. Anyone who doesn't love this recipe either doesn't care for corn or is impossible to please. There's NOTHING not to love!!! The only thing I would even consider changing is using one stick of butter. Two tastes fabulous but just in the interest of health. I also used low fat sour cream. Thank you SOOOOO much Ruthie! This is absolutely to die for!

I had to laugh when I read the negative reviews.  One person said it had "too much corn in it"????  I love this recipe.  My grandma used to make a baked corn recipe, but she used breadcrumbs.  This is so much easier and equally tasty.  After baking it the posted amount of time, it wasn't golden on top but clearly set in the middle.  I turned on the broiler for just a minute and got a wonderful golden brown color on top.  The recipe doesn't call for salt, but it seemed like it could have used some.  It still is a wonderful dish to serve, especially if you're a busy mom like me and want to serve something besides plain old steamed veggies all the time.

I had a function to cook for so I decided to make this. I did 6 - 9x13s and got raves. I use Jiffy brand mix, large eggs and real butter. People need to understand this is a very moist casserole, not a hold in your hand piece of cornbread, thus the consistency. In the future I think I will try some of the additions mentioned for a change of pace.

This was fabulous! I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9X13 dish, which needed an extra 15 minutes of baking.  It was devoured by everyone, and not one person didn't comment on how delicious it was.  With the ingredients being so rich, it can't find it's way to our table on a weekly basis, but we'll definitely be thinking of excuses to make it on special occasions!

I made this last night, and between my two roommates and I, it is gone.  I baked it in a 9x13 for 35 minutes and it came out well.  Also, I had all the ingredients on hand except for the butter, so I did substitute margerine for it.  It still tasted really good, but would probably be better with real butter.  You can definitely taste the margerine.  I would make this again, even if I had to use margerine again.  It was really easy and tastes good warm or cold.

Very easy side dish to make for potlucks.  Always a hit!  Once I forgot to include the sour cream and we liked it just as well without it, so I save the expense and extra calories and continue to leave it out each time I make it.  It seems like it would be hard to mess this one up.

I have been making this recipe for years.  As others have said...it is delicious, a crowd pleaser , easy and a must to make.  I also wanted to respond to MonkeyHawk's question in 11-19-09 review.  Yes, the dry cornbread mix is also known as "Jiffy Cornbread Mix" and is what the "package dry cornbread mix" ingredient calls for.  Happy cooking.

I love this recipe, its the best one I have for this dish.  I make it healthy by using applesauce in place of butter, using fat free sour cream, and a low fat corn muffin mix.  It's delcious!

Creamy comfort food. This would be great on a cold winter's night. As it was, it was pretty tasty in 100 degree weather. My kids and finicky husband loved it, but I think I loved it the most.
At seven months pregnant, it's nice to eat something that makes me feel happy and comfortable. One word of caution, it take slonger than 45 minutes to cook. I cooked mine for one hour and 15 minutes and it was perfect. At 45 miutes it was soupy and undercooked. SO I left it in the oven and waited and waited.
This is a definite keeper and a good pick me up.

Add a pinch of salt, always a hit whether on the side of bbq, mexican food or even at Thanksgiving!  With bbq what I like to do is bake the casserole earlier in the day or the day before. Then just crumble it up into a skillet along with chopped green onions & bell pepper & give it all a quick fry until the veg's get a bit tender & the casserole bits start to brown. I love versatile recipes like this!

This was a welcomed addition to my Thanksgiving table. I doubled the recipe so I could use my 9x13 baking dish since I didn't have a 9x9. I have since bought one to use for just this recipe as a little goes a long way. I baked the doubled amount for a little over one hour and it was perfect. The amazing part was that I don't like corn bread, but it was just the right amount blended with the corn. Yum! Very easy and tasty, too. Other than doubling and cooking longer, I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. One reviewer stated that they had too much oil on top, but they also added cheese, etc. The consistency is perfect if you actually follow the recipe as written. Thanks!

Insanely yummy.  Perfect combination of ingredients, and prep is so easy.  I make this as a side dish to chicken enchiladas, spanish rice and caesar salad.  Thanks so much Ruthie for sharing!!!  ***UPDATE*** I love this stuff so much I use it as the base for my Thanksgiving stuffing by omitting the sour cream, adding an extra box of Jiffy corn bread mix and baking for about an hour and a half.  YUM!!!

I have made this dish for Christmas for the last three years and it is always a hit. Just make sure to allow time (about 20 min.) for it to cool and thicken before you serve. Perfect!

This was OK.  It just needed some more zing of some kind.  The only flavor i was really picking up was the whole kernels of corn.  And i wanted more of the creamy sour cream tangy flavor.

With a few changes you can make this look like a souffle that took hours to make!
Subsitute:   
1 - 8 1/2 oz pkg Jiffy Muffin Mix in place of the breadcrumbs
1 stick of melted butter in place of 2 eggs

Bake in souffle dish (aprrox 9" round) for 1 hour or until golden brown.

It's as beautiful as delicious.  Enjoy!

Well Ruthie, this is just about one vegetable we can all agree on..(my 4 year old would really prefer it left alone.)  I loved this casserole when my mom made for us while we were visiting her in TX.  It was almost like a corn dessert but did make a wonderful side dish.  I'm sure you could dress it up by throwing in some red or green peppers, but it tastes great as is.  I'm looking forward to sharing this at future holiday get togethers.

You can't go wrong with this, it was a hit with our family. Made as is but next time maybe jalapenos or green chili's.

My mom has been making this for years.  We all love it!  Although this sounds very minor, this casserole tastes even better when the eggs AND the butter are left out to become room temperature.

This is what we call Spoon Bread and I've been making this same recipe for over 10 years.  It's always a hit and an easy side dish.  This recipe calls for a 9x9 pan but I've always used a 9x13 pan.  And if you use stoneware or glass you can melt the butter right in the baking dish in the microwave and then add the ingredients and mix and bake them right in the same pan.  Easy enough for the novice and tasty enough to serve company.

I have been making this for Thanksgiving for at least 10 years now. My family would be disappointed if I didn't. I do mix it up the day/night before and put it in my 20 x 15 turkey baking pan (as I always double the recipe.) However, I couldn't get it to cook evenly in a 9 x 13 pan... It was runny in the middle. I also have to cook it much longer than the recipe calls for... I start checking after 45 minutes, but I usually find it takes about 60 minutes or more. Thanks for a great recipe!I also added salt.

This was really good and I'll be making this one often!  I was out of sour cream so I substituted low-fat plain yogurt and it worked perfectly.

This was great! So quick and easy. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly.  I did bake this in a 9x13 glass dish because I wanted it to bake a little quicker. I think I still left it in about 40 minutes.  I think I will always put it in that size pan because it gives more of the golden brown topping. My Hubby is not a corn bread fan, but he loved this.  Next time I will add a little black pepper and I might experiment with some green chili's. I know I'll be using this as a potluck dish!

This recipe was amazing!!! I made it for 8 people and there was enough left over (eventhough we all had big portions).
I am kinda a health nut so i altered:
used 1/2 cup fat free plain yogurt and 1/2 cup low fat sour cream
instead of 1 cup of butter i used 1/2 cup "canola oil" butter spread.
added tiny bit of sugar
Came out perfect!!!! yummie!!!

I didn't have the exact ingredients but my guests raved over this side dish.  Instead of the canned corn, I mixed sweet white and yellow frozen corn.  I added the sour cream, just one beaten egg and 1/2 cup skim milk, a few pieces of crumbled cooked bacon pieces.  I skipped the butter entirely and did not add any extra sugar, it was sweet enough. There was barely enough left on the dish - I think they were too polite to eat those last few kernals.

I read through the reviews and came up with this.   Melt butter in dish around 9 inches.   Mix remaining ingredients, except butter and add 4 tablespoons of sugar and pour over top of melted butter.   Bake at 375 for 1 hour.   Comes out with a crunchy bottom and stays together.   Yum all the way.

I didn't have Jiffy so I used the following ingredients to substitute for the Jiffy:

2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
3 tablespoons granulated sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons vegetable oil

After making this a couple of times at full fat, I decided to play around and was able to substitute Fat Free Greek Gods Yogurt for the Sour Cream.  The only trick to that is to add a Tablespoon of Vinegar to the milk and let it sit  for five minutes.  Without doing that, it makes the casserole bland.  Trust me, it's good!

I also replaced half of the butter once with coconut oil and once with butter flavored shortening.  Both are fine substitutions. 

I use a 50/50 mix of white and wheat flour and usually bake with powdered eggs (don't cringe) and this recipe gets eaten no matter how much I play around with it.  

I have to agree with (and thank) the other reviewers that this needs around an hour in the over.  I set my timer at 55 minutes and just keep an eye on it.  For those who are oven checkers, the casserole doesn't drop no matter how many times you check in on it!  Enjoy~

This was absolutely delicious. The best corn casserole ever! I added a tablespoon of sugar to the recipe, but other than that it was perfect. I loved the stiffer texture of this recipe.

I have made this recipe SEVERAL times now.  I make it every other week.  It is AMAZING!  I changed two things: I added 2 T sugar, and used 12 oz bag of birds eye steamfresh freezer corn instead of canned corn.  The sugar was a MUST it MAKES this recipe!  My family devours this!  I'd give this 10 stars if I could.

I really wanted to like this, and I did!  Even using a mix, it tasted fresh and homemade.  I chose to use frozen corn and did not thaw or cook before I added it to the casserole.  I agree with the addition of "green", like peppers or onion but I did not have any on hand.  Next time, I will add both.  Once prepared, I put it in a bowl and topped it with a cup of my favorite chili and some shredded cheddar cheese.  It was a wonderful combination for a very chilly night.

I originally got this recipe years ago from my mother-in-law, and it is THE BEST.  If you are making this for more than a group of 6, be sure to double the recipe.  Everyone wants seconds, and the recipe.  (Also great with Mexican Corn and cheese on top, and some taco bell taco sauce added after cooking.) (Great cold too!!!)

Six stars if possible. Only changes were to add half a can of the corn juice to make it more moist, and fat free sout cream. I love how the top and edges are nice and crispy but so moist and almost pudding-like on the inside.

This is a great recipe!  Every time I make it, my family members gobble it all up.  The only changes I made were to add some cajun seasoning (Tony Chachere's, of course, I AM from Louisiana) and sometimes I put cheddar cheese on top during the last 15 minutes of baking because we like cheese.  For a main dish variation, I cook up some ground beef with taco seasoning, put it into a casserole dish, and pour the corn casserole on top.  Tasty!

Excellent and easy!  I doubled the recipe and did a little changing.  I added some dried chopped onion, about a cup of shredded cheese and used (11 oz) mexicorn instead of plain whole kernel corn.  It was delicious and the substitutions and additions really added to the flavor.

A good tip to make this casserole have a little more kick is to subsitute Ranch dip in place of the sour cream. This gives it a stronger flavor and everyone I know that has tried this improved recipe over the original can't rave enought!

The title of this recipe certainly describes the taste; totally AWESOME!!!! I didn't use the can of plain corn, however, two cans of creamed corn instead. I also added some cayenne pepper for a little zip. Served it on the side with a cabbage and ham soup which balanced the meal perfectly. Thanks Ruthie!!

I have been making this recipe for years, but wasn't sure if it could be made the night before being baked.  Always an important step during the Thanksgiving holidays.  The good news is it does just fine.  I serve 30 for Thanksgiving and need all the help I can get.  I always sprinkle the top with paprika.  It always amazes me that I only make this recipe during the holidays - it's awesome and so easy!!

I made this for a friends' thanksgiving after thanksgiving and it was amazing! I doubled the recipe, used a throw-away aluminum casserole pan, and added 1 bunch of green onions plus 6 strips of crumbled REAL bacon and cooked it for roughly 1 hour and 15 minutes with 3 minutes under a broiler. It was AMAZING to say the least!! Out of the 30+ dishes, it was the only one that had no leftovers!! Winner winner, chicken dinner!! Will absolutely make this again!

I make this all the time for pot lucks and holidays and it's always a huge hit. The eggs aren't necessary, I never add them and it still turns out perfect. For those who like it on the sweeter side, instead of adding sugar I highly recommend adding honey (as I always do to my cornbread also), it's much better than using refined sugar and gives it almost a glaze on top. I also agree that this takes closer to an hour to cook, not 45 minutes. For a savory version of this I would recommend adding shredded cheddar, green onions and jalapenos if you like a little kick!

This is embarrassingly easy to make. I skip the butter and use low fat sour cream and it's still super moist and just tooooo good. I take it to potlucks and get recipe requests every single time. (you can definitely double it in a 9x13 and can make it 24 hours ahead.)

Wonderful moist side dish. Right now I intend to put a big scoop in a bowl and cover it with chili!

This was very good!  I would recommend cutting the butter next time, maybe even in half.  Here's how I did mine: I used 1 can creamed corn and then used that can to measure my frozen reg. corn. I added about 1/2 cup chopped sweet onion.  I did as a previous reviewer suggested, I melted butter in the pan directly in the oven then added the filling without mixing it.  That way a crust develops.  That may be part of the reason I had standing butter on top but I will still try cutting it next time b/c it was still good after I had to soak up all that standing butter with paper towels. Will definitely make this again!

I made this the other night for dinner, but had no 9x9" pan, so I tried a circular pan similar to the pictured one.  Unfortunately, the cornbread was still gooshy when it was time for dinner, but the parts that we ate from the edge were awesome!  I will definitely be making this again (in a larger, flat pan).  Thanks!

I made changes as suggested in the reviews - cutting down the butter and eggs.  I made this for our Christmas dinner and prepped it all a day ahead and reheated it. I don't know how it was on the first day, but it was EXCEPTIONAL with our meal.  The left overs were welcome and gone before anyone got tired of them.  I will make this again.  I think there are more things that can be done with it, such as adding cheeses or peppers to make it more of a "southwest" flavor.  My family will be asking for it again I'm sure!

Yummy stuff. Everyone devoured it. I can see how adding grated cheese, green onions, or even diced green chilis, would be dynamite. Easy to make, inexpensive. I plan on serving on Thanksgiving, it would go well with the other classics. Simple enough for weekend too. I did not follow others advice on cooking 55 minutes, I kept it at 45 minutes. I wanted to make sure it was slightly gooey in the middle. Perfect.

5 PLUS stars for this little gem...Based on the reviews, I brought this to a BBQ, and it was fantastic!! Creamy..fluffy and delish!  I did double it with perfect results. I used one box of 19 oz corn muffin mix, and measured out 17 oz in my measuring cup.Everyone enjoyed it a lot. This is a keeper for life! Thanks so much for posting it.

Saw this recipe and it just sounded too good to pass up. I had all the ingredients on hand except creamed corn. Decided I couldn't let that whip me so I used 2 cans of whole kernel corn and mixed it with an 8 oz. pkg. of softened cream cheese. Tossed in a can of green chilies, a dash of cayenne, and the rest was history. Truly a great recipe. I baked it in a 2 quart baking dish because a 9 x 9 inch dish wouldnt hold it.

I have made this twice now.  Once last week as written (except I had to use a knock-off recipe for the Jiffy mix since they don't have them in my area.)  Made again last night as another side to go with my husband's birthday meal, this time adding jalapenos lots of black pepper and a handful of cheese to the mixture.  Fabulous stuff!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. It was a big hit. VERY easy to make.

I prepared it the night before, stuck in it the frig and then just baked it the next afternoon. It was exactly the same as when I baked it right after mixing.

OMG!  This casserole is wonderful.  Easy to make.  A great comfort food.  I took it to a party and overheard one of the guests say, "I could eat this until I was sick."  Yes, it's that good.

Very tasty! Have made it a couple of times at the request of my family. Adding the sugar, about 1-1/2 tbs. as someone suggested makes it even BETTER!

I added this to my recipe box in Nov. 2001.  I'm back for it because my aunt wants me to make it for Thanksgiving.  The first time I made it, I knew something was missing.  The next time, I added 1 tablespoon of sugar and have LOVED it ever since.  My husband and I love it so much that I've had to stop making it.

This was horrible.  I served it for Thanksgiving.  No one liked it.  Most people did not try it because they said it looked gross.  The people that did try it did not like it.  My family requested that I not make this recipe ever again.  The recipe lacks eye appeal and taste appeal.

My husband and daughter really liked this, but both agreed with me that the texture is a little grainy.  It might just be the brand of corn bread mix I used (Jiffy) so I'll try a different brand next time we try it.  If you like corn, you'll like this dish.

This was a hit at our Easter dinner.  The only thing I would do diffrently is add a bit of honey to bring out the sweetness.  I doubled the recipe and had very little leftovers.  A keeper!

I thought this dish was great but I don't think it needed any butter.  I had to take it out with 10 minutes left to go and drain the buttery grease that it was simmering in just so it could finish baking.  It was sooooo greasy.  (probably not the best for our arteries).  It may have been because I used the marie calander corn bread mix from costco.  That mix seems a little moise to begin with.......

1ST the easy part: I handed all the ingredients to my 9 year old daughter and let her mix this up. She was so thrilled with "her" cooking being such a great hit at Thanksgiving. Now the Awesome part: My cousin begged for half the leftovers, my 13 year old ate all our leftovers the next day, and now just a few days after Thanksgiving my husband is begging me to make it again. I told him I would make it as is instead of doubling like I did for Thanksgiving. He said that was fine as long as the rest of us didn't want any :)

Great recipe! I used plain yogurt in place of the sour cream to cut fat/calories. Still a lot of butter in the recipe... but I did what I could to reduce the amount and still have flavor! (My husband is on a diet). I'll be making this one again! Yum!

This is a recipe I make quite often but forgot to rate. My husband and I both love this. It's almost like dessert. I add shredded cheddar to the mix and then top it with another sprinkling.  It's also good with the addition of chopped hot pepppers and onions.

Wonderful.  I added onions, can of chopped green chilies, drained, and a finely chopped jalapeno.  We love spicy food, so this made it perfect.  A friend of mine added 4 oz of cream cheese to the ingredients I added...

This is a really tasty side dish, we made it with baked ham.  It makes a corn bread layer on top with a corn pudding bottom layer. Just what I was looking for.  TIP: An 8x8 pan would be too small. I used a 7x11 baking dish and it was pretty full. Baked it almost one hour.

I've been preparing this for many years.  I would not call it a casserole....it is a cornbread.  It is cut into squares and is solid enough to hold in your hand and munch away.  It's simple to prepare and a true crowd pleaser.  Making a double recipe for the holiday.

I have to admit I was surprised at how absolutely DELICIOUS this is! Thought it would be too cake-y, but no---turned out to be a perfect side dish. I make the double recipe in a 9"x13" pan, with the addition of about 1 Tbl sugar. (Why bother with the smaller size when everyone LOVES IT???) Another plus: I make it in a glass baking dish the day before I'm serving it. Flavors meld overnight and it reheats perfectly in the microwave. Leftovers (on the rare day there are any!) also re-heat great in the microwave. It's terrific with baked ham, pork chops, turkey, chicken, roast beef.....actually, it outshines the main dish! Kids & adults love it....There is absolutely NOTHING negative to say about this dish....well, OK, a little calorie rich, but when something is sooooo good, who cares? It's one of those rare dishes that is worth the calorie splurge!  Just take that fork and enjoy!

I have made so many corn casserole/baked corn recipes over the years trying to find just the right combination that everyone loves. this is by far, the best all-around one that I've found. I have made it exactly like the recipe calls (although I do use a 9x13 pan and cook until golden brown, which is sometimes a bit longer than the 45 minutes. I have also made it with 1/2 the corn bread mix for a variation (depends on who I'm serving) and it comes out more like a souffle. Both are excellent and I pass this recipe around every Thanksgiving and Christmas when my friends call asking for "that corn bake recipe".

I follow the recipe exactly and have perfect results everytime - although I often double it for big family gatherings.  This is a request for every holiday dinner - yum!  Everyone asks for the recipe and is shocked when I tell them how easy it is and what it is made of.

This is the BOMB!!! I served this dish with tacos and it was scrumptious. I made this casserole for the first time tonight for my husband, sister and brother-in-law (he's a picky eater) and it was completely gone. I did not change anything in the recipe, however, I did bake it an additional ten minutes. This is definitely a keeper.

I have made this recipe about 6 times and everyone thinks it's DELICIOUS. The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because every time I try to double the recipe, it ends up not having the same texture. It calls for a lot of fat, so I use about 3/4 of the sour cream and butter that it calls for and it still comes out great as long as I don't double the recipe.

The corn casserole was amazing!  To make it a little "healthier", I used low fat sour cream.

I've made this a few times so i've decided to change my origional review.  I'm not sure what went wrong the first time i made but it had to be a fluke.  Its so moist and delicious and everyone who's tasted it has been impressed and wanted the recipe.  my father in law made the silly comment "its better than regular corn" lol

To make this more of a moist cornbread, use small cans (8.75oz) of creamed corn and corn kernels and reduce the sour cream to 1/3 cup.  Reduced the butter to 6 tablespoons.  I also add 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  Cook for 45 min at 350 and you've got a moist cornbread.  Very yummy!

This was different and delicious and will remember to make it during the holidays - so easy. I followed submitter's directions making a few changes suggested by our fellow chefs.  As suggested, I added some chopped onion, grated cheddar cheese and cut the butter back to 3 tbls.  (I was making a serving for 4).  It turned out terrifically - not greasy as others had stated.  Thanks submitter.

This is one of my family's favorites.  I always have to double the recipe.  My kids will even eat it cold!  My daughter claims she put on 10 pounds over the holidays just from the corn casserole.  It has replaced green bean casserole as the favorite side dish.

The "four stars" is just a personal reaction to what I perceive to be a rather bland taste to this recipe "as is", but it's still a wonderful (and after the recent dinner at which I served it, popular) dish.  I added some jalapeno peppers (finally chopped, about 3 tbsp) and topped it with cheddar cheese.  That added a nice little "kick" and some additional flavor that folks seemed to enjoy (everyone wanted the recipe!).  I also used "Mexicali corn" for some color.  By the way, I noted that some reviewers had some problems with baking consistency... I didn't find that to be a problem as it turned out nicely golden albeit with a slightly longer cooking time.  Thanks, Ruthie, for a quick and easy recipe.  Both your original and my "doctored" version will remain on the menu here for friends to enjoy!

Yuck!  The only people who will like this are those who favor the creamed corn and cornbread mix.  I took this to a party and was embarrassed.

Great recipe!  If you're doubling the recipe, make sure your pan is big enough.  I made a double batch in a 10x15 pan, and it puffed up almost to the rim during baking.

WOW!  Try it! Try it!  My family LOVES this.  I have made many many corn casserole recipes over the years-all more time consuming-but this is truly awesome AND easy.  I have made it several times already.  I think it would make a delicious and quick sidedish at Thanksgiving when time is at a premium.

This was such a great tasting and easy recipe that I could not stop eating it and all the left overs! Its similar to a corn tamale that you'd order in a Mexican restaurant, minus the masa and the hard word needed to make this! When I make it again, I will add green chilies to the mix, pour a green sauce over it, then top with Mexican cheese and voila! A green corn tamale! Excellente'!!

This was a great recipe and SUPER easy to make! I made it for the very first time for thanksgiving and I was kinda apprehensive about how it would turn out, but it was a definite hit with everyone!! I doubled the recipe and it fit perfectly in a 9x13 pan. I used someone's advice here, and put half a cup of butter in the dish to melt in the oven and mixed the other half with the rest of the ingredients. I used Marie calendar's original corn bread mix and cans of both the whole kernel corn and creamed corn. I also used a tablespoon of sugar and a splash of vanilla. I baked it for little over an hour, probably closer to 75 minutes until it was beautifully brown at the top. It came out a little swishy and it got me a little worried but it cooled down and solidified a lot more. After an hour or so, it had the perfect pudding consistency. Like I said, everyone loved it and it was the first dish to get eaten fully! :) I'll definitely make this one again! I would try and cut down the butter by half and the sugar to one tablespoon, but it's fantastic just as! Thanks for this great recipe, it really helps amateur cooks like me look better :)

I made this in a toaster/convection oven in 2 4 1/2 x 8 loaf pans.   They worked perfectly.   This is going to be my potluck dish.   I am going to work on making this as individual muffins.   It tastes wonderful.

This is a must have side dish for Thanksgiving every year for many years. I prepare it the day before then bake it on the day I want to serve it. I make only one slight alteration to the recipe; instead of plain sour cream I use Axelrod's Onion Dip & Dressing. It adds a wonderful flavor to an already great dish.

LOVE IT!!!!  I have been making this recipe for over 30 years. It was passed down from my mother in law to me. I usually make this the night before Thanksgiving and reheat the next day. I think it tastes better this way. The sour cream really works it's magic on the corn by dinner time. I try to cook at least one 13 X 9 pan in a glass dish, so I can heat it in the microwave if needed. This is so popular at our family gatherings that I now make 3 large pans, so family members can take some home!!

I think 45 minute cook time might have been a little long.  This was drier than I expected.  The taste was amazing as most corn casseroles are.  I will make this again and shorten the cooking time.

Well, I am a big corn lover anyway, but since we had an abundance of corn from the garden this summer, I roasted 4 ears of corn in the oven, then cut the kernels off of those, and measured out the corn and I would need for the recipe. I did everything else the same, salt and pepper to taste, of course, but added finely chopped scallions sprinkled over the top halfway through baking time. I almost wanted to eat half of it by myself, but restrained, and shared with the family.Haha. They loved it! Thank you for a great recipe

This recipe is excellent! Only thing I would change is I would add 1/2 to 1 cup of shredded cheddar to the mix. That is how my grandmother has always prepared it and it is delicious! Also, it does take about 10 extra minutes to bake.

I have made this recipe many times for office potlucks and holiday get-togethers. It's great to make ahead the night before, and warms up beautifully in the microwave or oven. I sometimes add diced ham and cheddar cheese for an "all-in-one" main dish casserole. The kids love it. I've found when I add ham and cheese that it takes longer to bake - more like an hour total. I've easily doubled and even tripled this recipe with great success. Just add 10 - 15 mins onto the baking time. Once you make this, you will asked for the recipe, so be prepared!

I make a recipe just like this only I like to use the Mexicorn corn. It's the corn with peppers mixed in and it gives just a little added flavor. You also have to add about 1 1/2 Tbsps of plain white sugar. And if you add some the green ends of little green onions, sliced very thin for color, it's perfect.

OMG this was so good!!!! I reduced the butter by a tablespoon and added a  cup or so of finely shredded cheddar and a small can of green chilies that I drained slightly. Beautiful golden "crust" and soft, moist interior. However, mine was in the oven for a hour with the heat on to cook. At 45 minutes a skewer still looked too damp. Probably because I added stuff. :P Residual heat let this sit in the oven to hold for dinner while I cooked other things and it reheats in the microwave beautifully. I will absolutely be making this again since this was a test run on new recipes for Thanksgiving. YUM!

Great dish for a BBQ or potluck. I doubled the recipe and put it into a 9x13 baking dish. I prepared it beforehand, refrigerated and then baked later. It needed about an hour and 10 min baking at 350. I used low fat sour cream. Great recipe that had guests raving.

I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it and put it in a 13x9 pan.  I had to bake it about an hour and 15 minutes, and it was a huge hit at our family dinner.  I will definitely make this one again, you should try it.

Easy and delicious.  I made it exactly as directed and it was awesome.  My kids ate it for dinner--- it's pretty filling by itself.  

The next time I made it, I didn't have any sour cream, so I substituted cottage cheese- EVEN better!  Not the healthiest recipe in my box, but my family loves it, so I will keep making it.

We didn't really care for this.  It wasn't sweet enough and needed some sugar.  I also cooked it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe and it still wasn't cooked in the middle.

I doubled the recipe (except the butter) and added 3 chopped green onions, a drained can of green chilis and some sauteed onions. I used light sour cream too. It made a little too much for the 9X13 pan, so baked a couple of 6 oz casseroles for a shoreter period of time. Very good, it went to 2 potlucks. Gone.. every bit.

Really easy! Add everything in the recipe and it will turn out great!!! My boyfriend's mom makes this for him (a different recipe) and when I made this for him.. he said it tasted even better!! ONLY advice I would say is that it takes longer than 45 minutes... so spread it out in a flat pan (makes 2) and it will bake through more evenly

Exactly what I was looking for.  Perfectly sweet without adding sugar, creamy but firm texture.  I baked it for 1 hour at 350 and it turned out perfect, though it seemed a little raw in the middle it continued to cook through after taking it out.  So easy too!

Doubled it and had to cook for about 1 hour in a 9X13 dish.  Delisious and easy.  This is the only left over I had to save after the clean out of the fridge.  I guess my family doesn't love corn casserole as there was tons left over but I suppose that with all the Thnaksgiving food on the table, the corn casserole is just not that exciting.  It would likely steal the show on a random work night though!

I made this yesterday and my husband loved it!  I followed a few suggestions from other reviewers and used frozen corn (thawed) to equal 15 ounces, added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese, used regular onion and some chopped green pepper (sauted til soft), some chili powder for spice and a shake of salt.  Baked for 55 min.  The next time I make it, I will go for a more Southwestern flare and add jalapenos and some hot sauce for heat.  I would also add more corn...didn't seem to be enough.

This dish is my favorite thing to make for holiday dinners & party potlucks! It's so easy to make, looks like it took a lot of work, & is delicious. I made it my 1st time, & everybody loved it. 

I followed the recipe, and double everything. Except I used less butter- 1/2 cup, and only 2 eggs. I used Martha's All natural cornbread mix instead of the Jiffy mix. Jiffy has LARD in it! I also  added some chopped green onions & mild cheddar cheese. Perfect dish. Baked it for 1 hour. Prepared it in 5 minutes.

OMG! Wow this was good. We ended up dumping this into the crockpot after not having a large enough pan for a double recipe that would fit into the oven. It was still awesome. left the crockpot on high for about 1 1/2 hours...(guessing here may have been longer we were not paying attention!).. it was in till solid. It was inhaled by everyone! Thank you for this recipe!

I don't understand how this receipe can have such a good rating.  I fixed it for a dinner with friends and nobody liked it.  It lacked taste.  It was very bland.  I ended up adding sugar to it and making corn fritters out of it the next morning.  I guess I should've read the other reviews to see what other cooks had done to the receipe to "fix" it.

I was expecting somthing out of this world, but it was just OK.  I think it needed salt.  Kind of bland and a little soggy.  Followed the directions exactly but had to bake it for a full hour before it was done in the center.  Not bad, but not the ultimate cornbread; my search continues.

A must have recipe.  Delicious and easy!  I have yet to make this for company without being asked for the recipe.  It's a definite crowd pleaser.  As others have indicated, a little green is a nice addition to the dish: chopped green onions or parsley or something, and the cook time will be closer to 55 minutes or an hour.

This was my first making a baked corn recipe with corn bread mix.  In the past I have always had it made with crackers, but I wanted to try something different.  Though the recipie was a different texture then the cracker types I have had.  It was very good, and so easy to make.  What a great dish that dosen't require much attention!  It would make a nice side dish to something that requires extra effort.  Enjoy!

I have made this for 20 years. I simplified it somewhere along the way. 1 stick butter melted, use the wrapper to grease the pan, 1 can each of ( high quality) cream and kernel corn, 1 egg, 1 box corn muffin mix, 1 container sour cream, mix it all up and bake for about an hour.  Always requested and always delicious.

Delicious!  I made this for the first time as a side to our ham for Christmas dinner.  I have to admit I was a little skeptical of all the sour cream, but I followed the recipe exactly, doubling it so we'd have enough for everyone, and it turned out beautifully.  It was moist, subtly sweet, and I could just barely detect the slight tang from the sour cream . . . perfect!  Exactly the recipe I was looking for!  Like a cross between a sweet corn bread and the Mexican corn cake you can get at Mexican restaurants.  Our guests raved about this dish.  I think it was everyone's favorite, and wound up having very little left over.  I will definitely be making this again!

My family makes this every year at Thanksgiving! We've been making it for years and I have to say it is my favorite part, although we always called it 2Corn. It can be made ahead of time and frozen or refrigerated ahead of time.  (I think it tastes better after it has set together.) I Highly Recommend it!!!! P.S. Throw some cheese on top of it with the last few minutes remaining and it makes it even more delicioso!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We have been making this for years; we call it corn spoon pudding.  Try adding some grated swiss cheese to the mix and also top with some before baking.  If there are any leftovers we like it cold as well and yes you can make it the night before and refrigerate.  Add some green chiles to spice it up.

YOU MUST TRY THIS.  I make it all the time, but it is especially great for Thanksgiving and Christmas meals. People always ask for the recipe and I know it by heart, so it's easy to pass on the joy! If you ARE making it for a holiday meal, double the recipe.  Trust me, you will not have leftovers.

This was very, very easy.  I made it just as described.  It takes about 5 minutes to mix up.  I served it warm with some honey on the side.  Good enough to be dessert!  It goes wonderfully with some pulled barbeque pork.

I served this at our office Thanksgiving Party.  Hardly anyone ate it.  It's just not very appetizing when you look at it.  I didn't like it either.  I don't understand why it gets such rave reviews.

This was super easy to make and very good.  Everyone loved it.  I added onion to the mixture, next time I may add some green chilies, but really good just as it is written.

I thought this tasted awesome.  Even my mom liked it and she never has anything good to say about anything.    Definitely going to be a keeper recipe!    And I normally don't change recipes to my liking but everyone said it needed sugar.  I just added maybe a TBS of Honey because I was out of sugar.  I think with or without it, that I would still enjoy this recipe!  Thanks!

This is fantastic! As others have done, I added 2 teaspoons of brown sugar,  salt and pepper. That seemed to give it a little more flavor.  It is a little hard to tell when it is done. Don't bother to stick a toothpick in it like you would a cake. It firms up a little after removing from the oven.  I took mine out of the oven, and shook it to see how much it jiggled. The less it moves, the more it is done. Also watch for some slight cracking on the surface. The browning on top isn't a very good way to tell if it is done or not.

This was quick and easy and delicious.  I reduced the sour cream and butter because my dessert that night was heavy.  (I also was able to subsitute the corn bread mix with corn meal.  I added baking soda/baking powder because it wasn't a mix.)  Really great recipe!  Thank you!

I've been making this recipe for about 6 years and my dad requests it every holiday.  My family and friends love it.  I add 1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese and about 6 strips of cooked and crumbled bacon just for flavor and textural difference.  For those saying it had too much corn in it....uh it's corn casserole!  Was it supposed to taste like spinach?

This has been a family favorite for years.  I live in the corn belt and always have frozen sweet corn at this time of year.  I use that instead of the canned corn.  It is delicious!!

I always make  batches of this - and we still run out!  It can be mixed in the dish you will cook it in and cooked at whatever temp. your other food is cooking at, just adjust the time accordingly. A favorite that everyone asks for again & again!

I made this for two separate Thanksgiving lunch and dinner events I was attending.  For the first batch, I followed the recipe as written, but added 2 tablespoons of sugar and baked for 60 minutes.  It turned out perfect!  For the second batch, I added half a can of the water from the corn and the same amount of sugar as the first time.  It turned out good, but the consistency was definitely better without the addition of the water.  Either way, this recipe is a winner and I will be making it in the future!

This was VERY VERY GOOD.  I made it and took it to a Thanksgiving supper and everyone had seconds and thirds and asked for the recipe.  Some of us poured gravy on it, and I told someone else that it would make a good breakfast, heated with maple syrup.  And I can see lots of different adaptations you can do with it:  add chopped green onions, add Mexican corn instead of regular corn, add a small can of jalapenos, add cheese of almost any sort.  Excellent!

I really wanted to like this recipe a lot because of the simplicity. It just didn't do it for us, less than half of the casserole was eaten at the end of our giant family gathering. I followed the recipe exactly, but my hubby said that he would probably like it more if I added some sugar. It wasn't really like a casserole at all in my opinion, just sort of a glorified cornbread. It was very easy though so that's a good thing when the holidays come around! FYI: I had to bake it for 55-60 minutes although I didn't double the recipe so make sure to allow extra time for that!

I was given this recipe by a friend of mine and absolutely love it! My husband now requests it every time we need to take something for a potluck or are having dinner guests. I like adding peppers to this, but, rather than taking the extra time to chop for it, I have started substituting Mexicorn for the regular corn. The 'something extra' this adds is terrific. I also melt about 1 cup of cheddar on this at the end of the baking time.

I've made this several times and it always gets rave reviews.  I use Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix because it's a bit sweeter than traditional corn bread mixes.  I also use fat free or light sour cream, depending on what I have.  And, I completely omit the butter and it always comes out great.  Depending on the crowd, I sometimes add minced sweet onions and/or red peppers.

Very good and VERY easy corn casserole.  Will make again.  But I may take other people's suggestions of adding some peppers  or onions to it to give it a little more flavor.

My family loved this casserole. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out great. My husband HATES sour cream but he didn't even notice it in this casserole (and I didn't tell him it was there -shhh). One thing I would suggest is letting it cool to almost room temperature before serving it. The flavor seems to get better for some reason. It also reheats very well.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have successfully substituted "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" for all or half the full fat butter and have also used plain yoghurt in place of the sour cream with great results.

I never give bad ratings because I doctor things up a bit, but since this had such I figured I didn't need to do anything to it. It would be good w/ TONS of seasoning, diced chiles, roasted red peppers, green onions, and garlic. I made this for my aunt's memorial service, and only a couple scoops got taken out of a double batch. I told people that this recipe got great reviews...they asked "where the reviews came from...probably somewhere that likes bland food". Not my words, but rather words of my family and friends.

The first time I tried this I wasn't all that thrilled, but I decided to give it a second chance and I am really enjoying this now.  I omitted the can of corn (kept the can of creamed corn), I added 1 and a half tblspns of sugar and two dashes of nutmeg, and I used half sour cream and half cream cheese.  The end result is a slightly sweet, savory, and creamy corn pudding suffle!  If you're not expecting the texture then I can understand some of the negative reviews (which was my issue the first time I made it) but if you know what to expect you can adjust the flavor to your liking.  I also used a square pyrex dish, baked it only for 45 minutes, turned off the oven, cracked it open, and let it sit in there for another 5 minutes or so.  It's perfect.

Made this Xmas eve after reading all of the reviews, noting variations. Used all ingredients in recipe, except only used 11oz can of corn rather than 15. I incorporated the following suggestions by previous reviewers. One sauteed small onion and Roma tomato.  I did add 2 tbs of sugar; next time I would add one as I prefer it more savory than sweet. Used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup cream cheese.  This worked to a very nice taste.  Sprinkled in some chili powder/cumin.  Should have added a little more; maybe a tbs. Also added a 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp white pepper.  The best suggestion was adding some shredded cheese blend on top and broiling a few minutes at the end.  This added a wonderful crunch. There were many opinions about the texture so I wasnt sure how it should turn out. I think the souffle description is best, dry and crunchy on the outside, very moist on the inside.  This is a good recipe with lots of opportunities to make it a "personal one". Would definately make it again..

Very easy to make and scrumptious!  Took less than 5 minutes to combine all ingredients.  Its very light and fluffy.  You may need to cook a little longer than 45 minutes.  The middle takes longer to cook.  I kept it in for an hour and it came out perfect! Next time I'll add some jalapeno slices for a little kick.

Like others said, this was so very easy and amazing!  We added a can of green chiles and shredded mexican-style cheese (some in the casserole and some on top).  Also took someone's tip and put in a bit of sugar.  Wonderful!

HUGE hit- made for dinner of 4 and couldnt have doubled the recipe for it!  Was the first dish gone.  I added half the juive from can of corn, 1 egg, and cute down a bit on butter.  Just keep an eye and take out when inserted knife comes clean..  Will make again and again!

I have made this recipe many times with great success!  Even my  9 year old granddaughter, who is very picky, enjoys it.  It is just as good without the eggs.

This is easy and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and took it to a pot luck. It was all gone at end of the dinner.

This was very good.  I added 1/4 cup sugar for some sweetness.  I also think I could have cooked it a little longer, it seemed a little underdone.

This casserole is wonderful.  It couldn't be easier. For the little work involved, the taste is super.  I made it for a large family gathering and EVERYONE liked or loved it -- even the little ones who tend to be picky.  I would highly recommend this dish to anyone.  As others recommended, I did add shredded cheddar cheese to the top.

This recipe was okay.  Not terribly impressed.  Added cheese as recommended by another reader.  I will admit the recipe is easy to prepare and would probably make a good side dish to take for potlucks.

This is absolutely luscious! Delicious, different and incredibly easy.I used Jiffy corn muffin mix and white creamed and white whole corn. You MUST use both sticks of butter...it does make a difference!!!! I made it the other night with one stick, thinking it might lighten it up a bit. Hubby said something was off without me even telling him. Use them both! Just eat a smaller portion. We LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

OK...now folks, if you like to cook you know it is quite rare to find a dee-lish-us recipe that is so many things... economical, pretty, easy-easy-easy, and so tastey that you're the hit of the party.  This casserole is it!  All I did to "dress it up" just a bit was to add some sauteed, chopped red pepper and a teaspoon of cayenne to the mixture.  But, honestly, it's a grandslam as is.  Thanks bunches, Ruthie!

I didn't have corn muffin mix so I used the  recipe from the side of a box of corn meal.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it came out wonderfully.  My family loved it.  This recipe is a keeper!

A classic!  I make this every year for my annual Cinco de Mayo party, jazzed up with chopped jalapenos, cheddar cheese, onions and diced green/red peppers.  I'm making it for an Independence Day party tomorrow and adding onion, cheddar and bacon.  You will make this recipe over and over!

This recipe is fantastic!  So yummy!  I did change it though -- when I went to the store to buy the cornbread mix, I saw a new product out. It was a cheese cornbread mix (I forget which brand).  I debated for a minute thinking that I should stick to the orginal recipe, but the love of cheese won me over.  The casserole turned out awesome with the cheesed flavored mix.  Give it a try!

This recipe was just okay.  It wasn't as moist as I would have liked.  I think next time I make it I will use 2 cans of creamed corn instead of regular corn.

As someone who has loved corn since a child, I knew I would love this recipe.  It was also a big hit with my family, and whenever I bring this dish to a barbecue, it is one of the first dishes to disappear.  Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

i have been making this recipe for years. I LOVE IT. I make it on nights i don't feel like cooking. An easy way to make this a main dish is to top it with chicken (or canned black beans) cooked in salsa.  The ingredients are always something i have on hand. ALWAYS easy, Always good.

I thought this was bland just coming out of the oven. However, it gets better and better with each passing day. I will definitely make this again but will add 1 TBSP sugar if it's going to be eaten the same day. Otherwise I'll make it as stated and wait one day to enjoy it. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good. However, I wish it had a more "done" flavor. It seemed to set up well and the texture felt done but it kind of had a undercooked cornbread flavor. It may have been the cornbread mix I used. I am going to try this again and see what happens.

This was pretty good. I used an 8x8 glass pan and it required 20 extra minutes so that it wasn't runny inside. Smelled delicious in the oven and look wonderful when it was finished. Thank you!

I scaled this to 57 servings, in order for it to come out in even number of cans.  It is a great favorite for our Salvation Army pitch in dinners.
I place it in two large industrial size type disposable baking pans.  Due to number of servings, it takes considerably longer to cook.  Best way to test is with toothpick, and look for golden top.   Everyone absolutely loves this gem.

I have made this a couple of times now and thought I should write a review.  I think this is a wonderful recipe and goes very well with a steaming bowl full of chili!  My husband's Aunt gave me a collection of family recipes as a wedding gift and she has a delicious recipe for a similar casserole, yet it has mayonnaise, grated cheese, chopped onion, etc.  While it tastes fabulous, I found that this recipe tastes just as great and we don't even miss the extra ingredients (or calories).  Thanks for a delicious, super easy casserole!

My 5 year old LOVED this, but she likes anything with corn in it.  My husband and & I thought it was not appetizing.  I will not be making this again. It did smell very good while it was cooking.

Just made this for the 3rd time in 2 weeks. It is more awesome each time! This last time, I followed the recipe except for NOT draining the can of regular corn; added some chili pepper, and 1 cup of shredded "Pepper Jack" cheese (monterey jack cheese with jalapeno peppers). WOW!  More pudding-ish and has more of a bite and kick! I'll be adding this to "our Hall-of-Fame cookbook"!

YUM!  Used Jiffy corn bread mix in recipe.  Unlike some reviewers thought the taste was wonderful as posted.  We love it as a sidedish on Meatloaf nights.

I altered this by using a 6oz. packet of the Martha White Mexican style cornbread mix, 1/2 cup of butter, 1 egg, 1 can of creamed corn, 1 tbsp. diced jalapenos, 1/4 cup of jalepeno juice from the jar, and 1-1/2 cups of the monterey jack cheese with peppers.  This casserole came out perfect, it was not too pepper hot - totally awesome.  I would rather have this then corn bread anytime.

I've been making this for about 10 yrs now...always to rave reviews & someone always asks me for the recipe!  Now, it's become my sister's favorite asked for side dish too!!  I found out, accidentally, that when I beat the ingredients (I thought!) too much w/a fork & left it sit on the counter for about 1/2 hr. ..& THEN put it in a 300• oven (I had just cooked chicken wings before that @ that temperature) & forgot to turn it to 350• , which is the temp I usually bake the corn casserole.  Well, the casserole actually cane out even better..  It was fluffier, moister & just delicious! Now...I ALWAYS cook it this way..I beat the ingredients, let it set on counter for 1/2 hr & bake for an hour @ 309•.

Took this dish to a barbeque last night and got many compliments, plus my husband loved it. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9" X 13" baking dish. I also substituted plain (not fat free) greek yogurt for the sour cream and added diced baby red and orange sweet peppers for some color interest. I also stirred it twice (20 minutes and 40 minutes into cooking) to speed up the center getting set.

I have made this recipe multiple times and everywhere I bring it its a hit even though it has so many reviewers it seems like everybody is intrigued about what makes this corn casserole so amazing thank you for sharing this is so easy and so delicious. 
I am usually a health nut and in order to make it on the healthier side I skip the butter on replace the sour cream for Greek yogurt same results as when I did it following the original recipe except healthier :)

I followed the recipe almost exactly, with the only changes being 1) I used a 9x12 Pyrex dish, and 2) I drained the whole kernel corn before adding it. Other than that, I mixed it up, Pam'd the dish, and baked it for 55 minutes. It came out perfectly, and my family LOVED it. It was delicious!!

This was so easy to make and taste fantastic.  As my husband said as he came back for thirds "this is addicting".  I will be making this again.  Next time I will add a can of diced green chiles to add a little pop.  This recipe has so many possibilities.  But this recipe as written is worth the 5 stars.

I tripled this for a church potluck and there wasn't a bite left! Easy to make and a crowd pleaser for sure. I added a bag of shredded Mexican blend cheese to the batter before baking and had chopped green onions for garnish. I really like the creamy texture. Next time I think I will try adding green chilies to the mix.

I use this recipe all the time for Thanksgiving or even a potluck.  We actually brought this to a friend's house tonight as a side for their ham dinner.  I follow this same recipe but always add 1/2 tsp. of dill and a 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar or cheddar jack.  So delicious!

It's easy...First time I tried it someone else made it.
So, I made it for a family party  Didn't have any left.
I used reduced sour cream...no one said any thing. I had to 
travel with it to the party keep so easy.
Just reheated it for about 15 minutes when I got there.

This recipe was such a hit at Thanksgiving last year that I'm doing a double batch this year.  Family states it tastes like corn tamales.  By doing a double batch in a 9 x 13 pan I had to cook for an hour and 25 minutes.

This is delicious. I also cut back on the butter (1/4 cup is plenty), and substituted Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and it worked out fine. Sometimes adding a bit of chopped green onion, pimento, or red bell pepper makes it more colorful and a bit more savory. It's a winner all around!

We have been making this for several years.  Always a hit! I have never used butter, but always add cheddar cheese.  About 1/2 cup for a single batch.  A guest brought this dish to our Thanksgiving dinner years ago, but she "frosted" the top with sour cream and sprinkle it with cheddar cheese and returned it to the oven for a few minutes after it was baked.

I love this but instead of sour cream I use 8 oz of jalapeño cream cheese plus a cup of shredded pepper jack cheese. My friend uses regular cream cheese & shredded Co jack cheese. I also drain the sweet corn.  We've been serving it for several years. Make ahead of time if you need too.

I've been making this dish for 20 years, or more.  I've tried corn bread mixes other than Jiffy and it just didn't taste quite as good.  For a little kick try 2 tablespoons of drained, mild, finely chopped jalapeno.  So very good, either way.

I make this often, though I've never added eggs, and I use my "summer" corn. (Corn that I've cut off the cob. About 4 ears of corn and there juices.) Amazing!

I have never even heard of a corn casserole, but had creamed corn on hand so I gave it a try.  This was surprisingly good and very easy to prepare. Needed to bake it much longer than 45 minutes however, because it wasn't browning on top.  But once it was done we liked it.

This was so simple, quick and good!!! I added sharp cheddar cheese to this recipe and my honey loved it. My family ate the pan in one night and there are only 4 of us.  This makes a good substitute for normal starches you serve like potatoes, rice, or mac and cheese.  I don't think even the most novice cook could mess this one up.  I will put this one in heavy rotation of meal planning.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!  It always disappears at family dinners and potlucks.  I always use corn muffin mix, though, which I saw in a different receipe years ago.  It makes it a tad bit sweeter.

1st time to ever make something like this. I made it for Thanksgiving since I don't serve corn very often. My family loved this! I doubled this because it is a pretty small serving. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I add a squirt of honey, 1/4 cup white sugar, and a 1/4 cup flour as I live in Colorado at 7200 feet. Everyone raved about how great this dish was. Thanks for the recipe! I use a large 9x13 dish and it fills it out nicely. Be sure it is cooked all the way through before you remove it. It should bounce back lightly at the touch and come clean with a toothpick.

I made this as stated, except added some finely chopped jalapeno and red bell pepper and some sliced green onion.  I also used 1 can of cream corn and one bag of frozen sweet corn.  I think next time I'll use two bags of frozen corn and add in a block of cream cheese in place of the creamed corn as I don't like using canned vegetables.  Made it for a family dinner and everyone enjoyed.

Great easy delicious recipe. I would've given it 5 stars if it included sugar in it! It was missing sugar but I added a 1/4 cup of white sugar and tasted delicious. If you love eating sweet corn cakes from Cheese Cake Factory or El Toritos, then you'll love this one but don't forget to add some sugar.

Yummy!!  Had this for the first time at a resturant and had to find how to make this at home.  This was it exactly!!  I didnt have a can of whole corn but I did have frozed corn.  Filled the cream corn can with the frozen corn for measurement.  Had to cook it about 15 mins longer than directed.  Turned out great.

True to its name this recipe is both awesome and easy.  I made it even easier by mixing everything in the baking dish (after greasing); otherwise I followed the recipe as written (second time I made it, I doubled with no problems, just cooked awhile longer).  My son said it was so good he could eat it for breakfast, and my eight year old grandson (our new family food connoisseur!) gave me a thumbs up and a TEN!  I really don’t see how anyone could have had problems with this one or could give a bad review! Thanks for sharing, LETSGGGO.  Cooking it again tonight for the family!

I've had this recipe in my arsenal for awhile now. It bakes like a charm, and makes a good alternative to corn bread if you're looking for something a little different! Sweet and a little squishy, but SO good!

This is a delicious recipe for Easter.  I made it exactly as directed but added in salt and pepper because I think it needed it.  I baked it for 1 hour and 10 minutes because I like my corn pudding less pudding like and more like cornbread.  It was golden brown on top and not jiggly when done enough for me.  This is a great recipe for potlucks and one I will make often.

I made this for the first time for Christmas this year. Honestly, I wasn't expecting what I got because, well, it LOOKS rather blah. I loved it! I thought it was just about the tastiest thing on the table. I made mine in a deep dish and perhaps that's why it was creamy in the center, but maybe it was because of the creamed corn. The crusty edge was oh so yummy. I added pimento for color. Next time I think I'll try adding bacon. This dish was not a disappointment in the least!

I only wish it were a little creamier, rather than cornbread with corn in it. I being from Arizona, have never heard of this stuff. At our Christmas party all the Southerners were silly excited that I had made corn pudding. The entire dish was scraped clean. No leftovers for us. :o(

I didnt make this but it is so close to my mom's corn casserole recipe that we make every year.  It gets rave reviews & there's rarely any left. My son likes it cold!
The only difference in the recipe is we do not put butter in it, but we do add 1/3 cup sugar & 1/2 cup oil. Bake @350 for about 1 hour.
It is sweet, so a little less sugar wouldnt hurt it, altho most folks do like the sweetness.

Wow this was really yummy!  This is NOT like cornbread, more like a souffle consistency.  I made this as a side with chili thinking it had more of a cornbread texture but it was delicious scooped on top of the chili.  I'll make again for sure ... it was so delicious ... but not instead of cornbread.  SO GOOD!

Really good. I didn't know what to expect. I cooked it in a cast iron pot and just placed it on the table. Stayed warm the whole meal and was all gone at the end. I will make this again.

This was a fantastic dish! The only thing I did a bit different was to add a bit of salt, pepper and maybe a TBS of Cayanne Pepper. I think the recipe as is is a bit bland. I'll be adding a bit more spice next time. But all in all was really really good!

Love this stuff!   If you're a corn lover and like a pudding texture...this is for you!  My husband is the opposite so he didn't really care for this as much as me and my daughter did. He said not to serve it to a crowd :( . I wonder if they have canned creamed corn and kernels in smaller size. That way, I can bake it just for me and my daughter.

This was good. I like mine a little sweeter so I added a little sugar and it was good. Everyone raved over it!

This was amazing!! Mixed everything until just combined - about 50 strokes. Added a little salt and pepper and a big handful of shredded cheddar. It tasted sooooo good and was a total hit at the holiday dinner party!

Delish!!!!! Followed the recipe exactly the very first time and the other batches were modified. Super simple to add things to this recipe to make it more interesting. Pineapple juice, pinto beans, and brown sugar make great additions. :)

Made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and it went over really well!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I gave it four stars because I think it does need an addition of something (as another reviewer suggested) - for a spot of color and additional flavor - mixed in.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a HUGE hit. Even my picky 8-year-old devoured it. My sister called me to get the recipe because her husband insisted on her making it for Thanksgiving with his family. Thanks for a great recipe....I did however have to bake it longer than it said, but that could have related to my sister's gas oven. Either way....5 Stars!!!!

It is exactly what it says; it's awesome and it's easy! I made this for my job's annual Thanksgiving dinner. It was gone by the end of the night. I am making this for my family's Thanksgiving dinner as well! I expect it to be just as big of a hit as my job's dinner. Wonderful recipe.

I just made this tonight, after just hearing about it from a friend. It was suggested I add an 1/4 cup of sugar, So I added an 1/8th cup. I like my corn bread/muffins on the sweeter side and I think the sugar put it over the top.

I made this today for thanskgiving potluck. Everybody love it, and wanted more. I doubled the recipes, and bake them in 9 x 13 inch pyrex pan. I used 1 cup mayonese instead of sour cream, since I don't have any on hand. I am sure it was yummy with sour cream, but let me  tell you, the result of using mayonese was awesome! so yummy that some of the people licking the pan when the caserole was gone. I will make this again and again. Thank you for submitting the recipes, God Bless!

This was surprisingly really good. I had m hesitations because it involved a lot of corn, which I have no problem with but my husband is a very picky eater. However, he raved about it! He said it was tasty and that I should make it again! I was floored! I liked it very much too. Good flavor and texture. Makes a good barbeque side dish!

Loved this recipe.  Had a similar recipe I found in Cooking Light magazine that used low fat yogurt instead of sour cream.  I used low fat sour cream and everything came out great.  I do agree with others though, the cook time is off, I did use an 8x8 pan because I didn't have a 9x9, but I had to increase my cook time by almost double!!

I made the recipe as directed, as I usually do the first time I make something.  It was pretty good for a side, but a little bland.  I will add green chilies and/or onions next time as other reviewers suggested and I am sure it will turn into a 5 star side!  Great base recipe and concept!

This got rave reviews at a recent family gathering.  People were going back for huge plates of this, even after they were stuffed!  The only reason for giving this a 4 instead of a 5 is because I think the baking time is off in the recipe.  Mine took at least an hour to bake.  Also, next time I will drain the corn, because this was too wet for me.  I added cheese, chopped green onions and seeded jalapenos for a little extra.  Good!

By far one of the best recipes I've picked up from All Recipes. Always a crowd please, no changes are needed to the recipe, great for pretty much every potluck or family gathering, and insanely easy to throw together. Thanks for sharing this gem.

Love this! Been making it for 3 plus yrs. I use half the butter, and also some of the water from canned corn. I omit the sour cream for my own taste and it comes out great. Works good in pyrex but it's even better in cupcake liners so everyone has their own piece. I just place the batter in cupcake liners and cook until a toothpick comes out clean at 350 degrees. Lately I have been adding extra ingredients like half with chopped chives and half with shredded cheese to spruce it up. Each were delicious. Great and easy recipe to experiment with. This is the dish I am always asked to bring for the holidays.

Yummy!  This recipe is beautiful in it's simplicity and so versatile!  I brought this as a side dish to Easter dinner and it was a hit.  I made it the night before in a 9" stoneware, (as other reviewers suggested it needed just over an hour to bake) cooled to room temp, covered with foil and refridgerated overnight, then reheated in the oven the next day just before serving.  Tasted great! 
I think this will be my new potluck staple, as it's so easy to make, and everyone likes it.  
I'll also try it as a simple weeknight main dish with chopped onion, cheese and ham.  So happy to have found this recipe!!!!!

This is the one I've been looking for!  I added a handful of finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I also kep in mind the 50-55 minute time; mine was just right at 55.  I will make this again.

I really love this stuff, how it has just a tinge of sweetness, and it doesn't dry your mouth out like regular cornbread does. I've made it a handful of times now, and the last time I forgot to include the sour cream and it didn't turn out half bad! Just a little denser than usual. This time I also only put 3 tbsp of butter and 1 egg like another reviewer recommended. All in all a great dish, will keep on making this forever!

I made it for Thanksgiving.  It was a huge hit with everyone else but I didn't really love it, it was decent, but then again I'm not a corn person.  A certain family member who is very snobby about their food and has high expectations loved this!

This is a very easy recipe to follow with terrific results! I brought it to a church dinner and everyone wanted the recipe. I followed the directions exactly as written, I wouldn't change a thing!  I did put it into a 2 quart glass baking dish and it fit fine.

Split ratings in my family - one daughter liked it a lot, the rest of us not so much. It was sweet, but also had a bitter taste - maybe the sour cream? Not sure, it could also have been the storebrand creamed corn. This was not for us, sorry.

Fantastic recipe. Made it for Christmas dinner and it was a hit. The consistancy was perfect and the taste was wonderful. This will be my go to recipe for corn casserole from now on.

SOOOO easy to make and so very good!  I added some diced red pepper like a previous reviewer suggested and it was a great addition.  I also doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving and found out that I really shouldn't have.  I think this would easily feed 10 people.

I was excited to make this for my dads birthday dinner and it was tasty. However, I was a little disappointed that it turned out more like cornbread with bits of corn in it rather than a casserole per say. My family still cleaned the dish it was in so i deem this one a success.  ; )  Not sure if I will make it again though.

Easy, easy and easy to make.  Served beautifully and everyone at the table just raved and had seconds and some even thirds.  Heated up well the next day, too.

This is an awesome recipe!  I loved it.  I served it with "Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken" from this site and the two were made for each other.  I made it in an 8" pan, so it did need additional baking time, about 15-20 minutes extra.  Next time I will be sure to make it in a 9" pan so it doesn't take so long to bake.  I used a Jiffy corn muffin mix, which was the only one I could find that was the 8.5 oz. size.  This is comfort food to the max!

i've made this recipe several times and we LOVE it!  however, tonight, after a day of baking adventures, when i turned my attention to dinner preparations, i found myself out of butter AND down to about a tlbs of sour cream!  but i wanted corn casserole to go with my smoked brisket and baked beans, so i decided to do an experiment.  i made this recipe without butter, with a scant couple spoonfuls of sour cream, and the addition of some really sharp wisconsin cheddar.  amazing!  who knew you could cut out all that fat and calories and still have a tasty result??  this will be something we eat a bit more often now that i know cutting out some of the less healthy ingredients doesn't completely ruin it.  the mark of a great recipe, thanks!!!

I use Cope's Corn instead of the creamed corn. For those of you not familiar with it, Cope's is a dried, cracked corn that is usually boiled or soaked before you use it. It was a perennial favorite in Ohio where I grew up. Cope's corn is already pre-sweetened, so I use plain corn meal instead of the cornbread mix. The flavor of Cope's is unique, and I think it really makes this recipe pop! Using Cope's makes the recipe a bit more work, but it's definitely worth it.

I tried this recipe out 4 years ago, and my whole family loved it.  I am now required to make this dish every thanksgiving.  I usually double the recipe and it takes approx. 15 minutes longer than stated on the recipe.  I also use light sour cream and it tastes just fine.  Last year I went a little crazy and added shredded cheddar cheese and it was sooo  yummmmm!  Great recipe!

I've made this a few times and love it with shredded cheddar mixed into the batter.  After 45 minutes, I add a little more cheese on top and bake for another 10 or until the cheese is melted.

I've been making this for over 10 years & is always requested for Thanksgiving & Christmas.  My original recipe calls for a carton of French Onion Dip instead of the sour cream.  It is absolutely delicious.

I always add 1/2 Cup (or more) diced  jalapenos to this same recipe and it comes out great!  I definitely cook it for 55 minutes as others have indicated.

This is a Thanksgiving tradition for us!  I always double it and bake in a large quiche dish or 9X13. When the top looks dry, it's done.

This recipe has been in my family for years, but varies from cook to cook. I tend to use only 1 egg, and substitute half of the sour cream for milk.

ok - this is a great side dish recipe.  EASY, quick and cheap.  very good for thanksgiving or for a hamburger cookout.  i added green onions, but think jalapenos might be better.  i doubled recipe and cooked for 65 min in a 9x13 inch pan in a convection oven.  let sit 1 hour before serving.  would prob be good / the same if cooked ahead of time and then reheated, but should be served hot.

This was very good.  I used smart balance for the butter and light sour cream and it still had wonderful flavor.  Took mine about 10 add'l min. to turn brown.  I'm sure we will make this again.  Thanks!

This is the easiest dish to make!  And delicious too!  I added 2T of sugar to the mix (cuz my family likes sweet cornbread).  It definitely takes longer than 45 min to bake, but it turned out great!

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made this for 3 family functions and it's now become a famous request and everyone loves it.  They all say it isn't dry, like others they have tried.  I do add cheese in to the mixture and it tastes wonderful.  I don't use the entire box, but most of it of the corn bread mixture...and it's great!!!  Excellent recipe and I highly recommend it to all corn fans!  Great recipe!

This was so good!  I read a lot of reviews and made just a few modifications.  I added about 1/2 tsp. sugar, 1/8 c. finely chopped green peppers and 1/8 c. chopped green onion.  I cooked it for about 35 minutes on 350.  I was also making baked fish, so I turned up the oven to 425 and let the casserole cook with the fish for another 10-15 minutes, making sure the top didn't get too brown.  Will definitely be making this again!  A huge hit!

Made for a large group, doubled recipe and it went over well.. People loved it. I did not change a thing except to double it. I try not to change it first time making something. Lots of request for recipe.I cant wait to make it for my holidays and maybe get to taste more than I got at the last function .

So easy and so yummy!! The only thing I add to this wonderful recipe is add some chopped green onions and a chopped red bell pepper. Those two things not only add some great color, but also give the dish the perfect amount of flavor! Great and easy dish to make any night of the week...and the leftovers are just as good the next day.

This corn casserole was great! I didn't make any changes to the recipe. I doubled it and baked it for 1 hour. Great to make in advance for a party as you just need to reheat it. Family loved it!

I made this Thanksgiving a year ago and am just catching up on my reviews.  I had made this ahead of time and froze it beautifully.  Everyone loved this dish tho' it seemed almost too much as a side for all the other rich foods on the table for that meal.

Really good as written. So easy, throw it all in a bowl, mix, put in a pan.  Done.  Next time I might add some sugar, since I would have liked it a bit sweeter.  A great recipe!

This was super yummy.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added some of the water from the whole kernel corn, which really made it nice and moist.  I think next time I will also add a can of diced green chiles and some crumbled cooked bacon.  We served this with green beans and the Spicy Chicken Breasts from this site.

Very good recipe.  I don't change anything except for the cooking time.  It seems to take longer than 45 minutes, but could be because of the size of dish I use.  Very tasty!

In one word:  Cornalicious!  I make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  This recipe is great and easy just as it is, but I use this as a base for many variations.  I always add one diced sauteed onion and decrease the butter to 1/4 cup (it can tend to be greasy) and always add about 1/2 pound of grated cheese(pepper jack or cheddar work very well).  You can then mix in some Rotel or just plain diced chilis.  Or diced red peppers work well too.  A couple of diced chipotles in adobo is out of this world.  Just let your imagination run wild!  XOXO

This is a new addition to our house!  I only changed two things - I don't have a 9x9 square, so I used a 9 inch pie pan.  I also followed the suggestion to bake for 55 minutes - and the main dish wasn't ready so it sat for 15 minutes.  We love this and so did our dinner guests!

I AM NOT A BAKING KIND OF GIRL , but this was super easy and made me look like a pro more than once. It baked up beautiful every time I have done it. Perfect color and flavor. This is not the thick custard type corn pudding but it is THEE PERFECT texture for me, just enough golden crust and creamy/eggy/fluffy insides. IT IS PERFECTION, follow the recipe exactly and DO NOT OVER MIX. I think if you wanted to add bacon or onions they would be great or any extra seasoning. Corny cornbread goodness in every bite =D  If you are looking for a corn pudding recipe you have found one of the best! DELICIOUS!

Underwhelmed. I don't get what all the fuss is about. It just tastes like cornbread to me.

3/10/08: Really good flavor...made in square pyrex...too much batter for such a small pan (too thick, not cooked well throughout).  Try in 9 X 13.

Excellent recipe. Took me 55 mins to get it cooked properly though.

Made it exactly as it says, but I think it needs at least 3 TBSP's of Sugar to sweeten it up more.

4.5 stars/5 stars

LOVE it. My DH said he could eat the entire pan. Very sweet, so a good compliment to a spicy side dish. I want to bring to our church potlucks, but need to take someone's suggestion and make it more visually appealing, because I think it might get passed up based on looks alone. Delicious!

I make this all the time for potlucks and Thanksgiving dinner, because I'm requested to do so. I  take home an empty dish everytime.
Update: When I'm making this for my hot and spicy chili I made just as is, but when it is a casserole for a Mexican feast then jalapenos or green chilis or green onion are a great addiition, top with a bit of cheddar cheese right out of the oven.

Based on other suggestions, I cut sour cream to ~1/2c, added ~1/2c sugar, and baked closer to 1 hour.  Final product was yummy, will certainly make again and again.

My hubby liked this better than I; I was hoping for something more resembling the corn casserole we got from the deli at our grocery store which was sweet, with almost a vanilla flavor and custard-like texture.  This casserole was not cooked through after 45 minutes, interestingly.  I think I would have to tinker with it to get it to taste more to my liking, but it is a good basic start.

Tried this tonight for the first time and it is really wonderful!  This is a very easy to fix and delicious dish.  I followed the recipe exactly but did add a tablespoon of sugar as suggested by one of the other reviewers.  Had to cook it a little over an hour but that could be due to my oven.  Thanks for a great recipe.  This is a "KEEPER"!

My family loves this moist, slightly sweet, and yummy alternative to corn bread. I had tried many a cornbread recipe and ended up with a crumbly, unappetizing mess. My mom suggested I try this one, and even though it's called a "casserole", it's just what I needed to hit the cornbread spot. Awesome AND easy!

Oh my gosh!  I made this for the kids, but my husband and I ended up eating 90% of it within the first half hour...we kept going back for more.  I will use real butter next time...although it can't get much better than this. :-)

Followed the recipe to the "T" only I added 10-15 more minutes to the cooking time as other reviewers have suggested and it came out PERFECT!  It was so easy to make and had a wonderful flavor.  This will definitely be a regular at our dinner table.  Thanks!

i haven't actually made this, but my mom makes something very similar that is delicious. she adds leftover chicken (or you could cook some up specifically i guess), a small can of chopped chile peppers and some chili powder. it's amazing. i think the recipe is called chicken tamale pie.

Yummy! I opened my sour cream to find it molded, so I used 8oz cream cheese instead. It turned out wonderfully, definitely something to make again!

I love this one.  It is a great side to basically anything.  I always have these ingredients on hand so I can make it in a pinch.

This is the absolute best corn casserole I've ever tasted--homemade or restaurant!  I can't believe anyone would want to make a corn casserole and not like this.  I used sweet whole kernel corn.  Fantastic!!!

This is one of my kids favorite holiday dishes.  I've tried several different "versions", and this one is the best.  I added 2 T of sugar and a can of chopped chilis, and it was perfect.  I bake in a shallow quiche time dish, which makes for lots of "crusty" parts, which we all fight over!

This is a great recipe!  I added onion and jalapeno to the mix for a bit more flavor.  I also added pepper jack cheese on top!  Yummy!

I took this wonderful dish to 2 small dinners for Thanksgiving. I baked it into 2-9" pie pans, one for each dinner and it worked out well (I shortened the baking time by about 10 minutes). It was easily sliced into 8 portions. I followed the recipe but added shredded cheese to the top in the last few minutes of baking. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good corn casserole recipe; however, I didn't like the way the canned corn tasted in the meal.  I will definetly cook this again - but I will experiment and try using frozen corn instead of canned next time.  But I will use the canned creamed corn.  This recipe got lots of compliments at Thanksgiving just the way it is as well!  So depending on your tastes - you may not want to change a thing.

The final taste of this dish very much depends on the quality of the ingredients.  Use corn with good flavor.  I used Libbys super sweet canned corn and everyone loved it.  If you use bland, generic corn you may end up with a bland dish.  I also added a couple of slices of extra sharp chedder cheese into the dish.  Add up to 1/3 cup of sugar if you want a sweeter mix.  This is easy to whip up in the food processor.  Just stir in the corns once the other stuff is mixed together. Cooking time for me was 60 minutes but I used a deeper casserole dish.

I have made this numerous times and we all love it.  Try it with a little bit of maple syrup on it.  It's perfect!!  I will eat it warmed up the next day and add a little maple syrup(real is the best)!

Easily one of our favorite side dish recipes.  For the cornbread mix, we used a kind that had a cinnamon in it and it was AWESOME.  I'm not sure if I want to try it without that particular brand because it tasted so good.  This is definitely a keeper...we're thinking of making this as a side dish at Thanksgiving now!

This was so creamy and delicious!  I didn't have enough sour cream to make a full cup, so I used a half cup of sour cream and a half cup of cream cheese.  I also added black pepper.  I cooked it in cast iron skillet for 55 minutes total.

My gram actually gave me this recipe and my boyfriend can't stop raving about it and wants it all the time.  We make it for all the "big" meals and bring it if we need to bring a dish to a dinner.  So easy and very popular!!  Just don't over cook, it will dry out.

Obviously, the sheer volume of 5 star ratings makes this recipe a 'must try'.  And I must agree!  I'm not a connosieur of corn casseroles, but this was awesome!  And those that tried it that have fond childhood memories of the same stuff, raved about it as well.  Thanks, Ruthie!

Awesome recipe!!! I made this for my church christmas dinner and it was a hit!  I didn't have packaged corn bread mix but instead used 1 cup corn meal, 1 cup sifted flour, 1/4 cup sugar and 3 teaspoons baking powder.

Yum!  I've made this a few times now, and it is just so delicious.  The first time I used sour cream, but I found I like using cream cheese a little better.  Just make sure you get it soft first, or you'll have a really hard time mixing it in.

This was really good and my family liked it.  I cooked it longer than the recipe said to get the golden brown top.  I made the mistake of eating it straight out of the oven.  I would wait 15-20 minutes before serving to let it build up its texture because it will taste much better that way.

This is just okay, nothing great. You must really like corn bread/muffins to enjoy this as it is very "grainy." Easy to put together though and makes a pretty presentation. We'll just stick with cream corn.

I followed the recipe exactly, however, I missed the creamy part. My husband said all this was, was corn bread with extra corn. He was right. I used the jiffy corn bread mix also. It was also dry.

This is very good! I used two cans of cream of corn and it was delicious. I may add a little bit of sugar next time to make it a little sweeter but it is fine the way it is. I used the jiffy corn mix. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Oh man was this good! After reading the reviews here, I knew it would turn out more like a corn bread than a casserole, so I split the batter between a muffin tray and an 8X8 pan. The muffins were done in 20 minutes and they were perfect! Slightly crisp on the outside and light and creamy on the inside; sheer heaven! (I didn’t share!) I served the remaining casserole portion as a side dish and it was well received. I ate the leftovers for breakfast. Clearly I’ll have to make this infrequently or my butt will get too big for my chair! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a great recipe! I was not able to find the 8.5 oz package of dry cornbread mix so I used (3) 6.5 oz packages of Golden Corn and Muffin Mix (Betty Crocker) and doubled the other ingredients. I poured everything in an 11x14 pan and baked for the same amount of time. It was wonderfully moist and everyone enjoyed it! Super recipe and so easy to make!

Excellent! And so easy! Ingredients can be put together ahead of time if you're having guests, so it's one less thing for you to do later on.

Great recipe, extremly easy.  I modified cooktime to 90 minutes and it turned out more like cornbread than pudding both times I made it.  Third time might try the 50 just to check it out.

This was a nice corn side dish that my husband and I both enjoyed. At the store I only found 7 oz. bags of cornbread mix, but that didn't seem to mess up this recipe at all. I also only had an 8' by 8' pan and this baked up perfect golden brown in that pan. The only downfall for me in this dish is it was a bit eggy. We like our corn casserole a little dryer in the middle, like Chi Chi's yummy side dish. This was a tasty recipe but I think I will keep looking for the perfect corn casserole for us.  Thanks for the recipe!

Like a moist, sweet cornbread.  Also would be nice jazzed up with some salt and black pepper, or maybe a can of chili peppers.  Mmm!

I made this for dinner the night before Easter for the family.  I used Mexicorn because it was all I had in the cupboard.  They asked to make again the following day to have for Easter dinner with the big crew.  It was so easy, I did!

Great recipe!  I made it for Easter and it was a big hit.  I added 1 can diced Ortega chili's to the recipe, salt, pepper and onion powder.  Mixed it all up and let it sit in refridgerator overnight.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks a bunch

We LOVED this....I did add chopped jalapenos and that made a big difference. Also, only used 1/2 stick of butter and used low fat sour cream. Will make this again often! It did take mine longer to cook.

This was pretty good. I had never had or prepared a corn casserole before, so I tried this one because of the high marks it received here. My boyfriend, who LOVES corn, really liked it but I thought it was just OK. Next time I think I will add some onions for flavor and texture and I will use a different brand of cornbread mix-- jiffy is too sweet. something about corn and sweetness just doesn't work for me, i would rather have a little more salt or kick with my corn.

My family wasn't wild about this one.  I'd make it again but would add a tablespoon of sugar and some chedder cheese to add some more flavor. It wasn't bad just sort of bland.

If I could give this a review with six stars, I would.  This is unbelieveably easy.  Even my finiky son-in-law (who hates vegetables) loved it!  We doubled the recipe for our Christmas dinner, and I began to wonder if that would be enough...my guests kept coming back for more.  Now if only we could get a recipe that would make spinach this palatable!

Great! I tried this out on a group of friends...a practice run to see if this would be a good Christmas dish. Everyone loved it and it was so easy. Mixed the ingredients the night before and baked it right before serving....Be careful not to overcook as it would probably be too dry.

This was ok...nothing great.  A few people thought it was good (I made it for Thanksgiving) but most said...Corn is good, Corn Bread is good..why wreck them.

Would not make again... (Two people out of 20 thought it was really really good) so it's just a matter of opinion.  

thanks.

I have been looking for a better corn casserole than the one I have made often the past few years.  This one is oooohhhh ssssssooooo much better!  The other recipe included finely minced green onion and green pepper (1/4 cup each).  I may saute the veggies in butter used in this recipe and see how it goes.  The savory/sweet taste should be yummy.

Fantastic!!  The problem with a boxed cornbread mix is that it is dry, dry, dry, but this recipe fixes that problem wonderfully.  I accidentally forgot to add the cup of sour cream.  I thought it would be ruined, but it was fabulous!  I think I will purposely omit the sour cream next time, too.

I made this for the first time as a side to dinner tonight.  It turned out perfect!!!  It looked like a moist cake in the baking dish when I took it out of the oven.  It was definitly something with a different taste.  Recipe works perfectly!!!

This recipe was delicious.  However, instead of using canned corn kernels, I used frozen sweet corn kernels (I'm not fond of "canned" veggies), blanched in boiling water.  I did use canned creamed corn though.  My pan was 8 x 8 x 2 deep, so I had to add 20 minutes to the baking time.  I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the batter for a little kick.  My mother and father loved this dish!  Actually, my chocolate lab, Mackie, thoroughly enjoyed a few bites of this too.  The casserole turned out absolutely delicious.  Next time, I'm planning on serving it with chili con carne.  YUMMY stuff!

Yum Yum Yum!! Comfort food at its best.  I've been making this recipe for over a year, and every time I make it, I am asked for the recipe.
It is incredibly easy and oh so tasty!
I usually add 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar to make it even sweeter.

I was apprehensive about trying this dish because of the sour cream-but to my delight the sour cream taste did not over power this delicious dish.  This would be great at Thanksgiving or Christmas and every meal in-between.

I've tried several other similar corn casseroles before, but this one was so tasty!  I much prefer this one because the sour cream adds flavor and moistness.  I served it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  It's extremely easy and well worth trying.

This corn casserole is a favorite at all of our holiday gatherings, and even as a weeknight side dish.  It's quick and easy to make, and popular with kids and adults alike.  For extra zest, and a little change, substitute a can of fiesta corn for the kernel corn.  I also use the reduced fat sour cream and a heart smart spread and it comes out just as creamy without the added fat and calories.

This is a great recipe.  I doubled it for Thanksgiving, the casserole dish was
empty when dinner was finished.  Every person at the table (kids and adults) 
commented on how delicious this dish was.  It is very, very, very easy to
prepare and looks so nice when it comes out of the oven all brown and puffed
up!

This corn casserole is excellent. I followed others' advice and added a small can of green chiles (mild) since I don't like spice but it gives it a nice flavor. I serve this with chili on Christmas!

Due to reviews & my experiences, I thought this would be bland without adding some things. I added 1/2 c. shredded Mexican cheese & think 3/4 c. might be better. Instead of 1 cup sour cream, I used 1/2 c. reduced fat sour cream + 1/2 cup Ranch Dip. Because I was out of fresh onions, I added some dried chopped onions.  I believe it would have been lacking without these addition. As suggested,  I reduced the butter to 5 tablespoons & believe that's enough. I also cooked it in a 9 x 13 pan & for longer than the 45 minutes.

I love this recipe. A friend shared it with me and it's now my go to side dish with pulled pork or chili! I make it without the sour cream (forgot it once and it tasted just as good) and it's delicious!!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because of the few changes I made to it. I think the biggest thing I did differently was to whisk together the sour cream, eggs & melted butter before adding the corn then the Jiffy cornbread mix. I also added a little salt & sugar & melted about 2 T butter in the pan in the oven before I put in the batter.

This is the best recipe I've ever seen for corn casserole. I do NOT drain the can of whole kernel corn because I like a more moist casserole. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

This is a staple at every holiday meal for my family!  Very easy to mix up quickly or can be made ahead and kept in fridge until ready to bake.  Reheats for leftovers very well and I have definitely eaten this cold straight from the fridge as well.  I add a dash of black pepper and garlic powder, not too much and I never measure.   Some are afraid to try this at first, but everyone loves it!

The flavor was delicious.  I had never had this sort of dish before and I was impressed how the cornbread and the corn gave it a consistency of exactly both.  I didn't know what to expect but it was very good.

I have been making this for 4 years now for Thanksgiving.  It is a hit and here to stay.  as others have mentioned in the past, I essentially double the recipe, but use 1 cup of sour cream and and 1 stick softened (microwaved) cream cheese.  I use 3 boxes of corn muffin mix (instead of 2) as I like mine a little more cakey.  I also add 2 small cans of diced chilis, and a handful of shredded cheddar. I do not double the butter as I think 1 stick is plenty.  so summary:  4 eggs, 1 stick butter, 1 stick cream cheese, 1 cup sour cream, 3 boxes jiffy corn muffin mix, 2 small cans diced chilis.   I also grease a pyrex large casserole dish with the butter flavored shortening. it is option if you want to sprinkle cheese on top.  this time I did not, just mixed some in...because it is a pretty thick, deep mix in my dish, i baked at 325 for about 45 min, then finished at 350 to help brown.  probably another 20 min.  pyrex is great because you can see the bottom through the pyrex...

This was just too bland for me, so I upped it a notch or two. 
Added 6 oz. chopped green chilies, diced red bell pepper, finely chopped green onion, half sour cream and half heavy cream. Also used one can of whole kernel corn and two cans creamed corn. I also added a few drops of Chalulu hot sauce for added flavor. For a main meal, I sometimes add rotisserie chicken or ground turkey.

I made it following exact recipe (using Jiffy mix).  I used an 8x8 nonstick gray baking pan and added about 7-8 min baking time because it looked to light when I checked it.  Pulled it out , checked the center with a fork and it was perfect!  Sweet and good.  If I was doubling, I would definitely use 2 pans for even cooking and not having to worry if it’s cooked in the middle.  I’ll be making this again!

I am sorry but this was absolutely lacking in flavour.  I feel badly saying this but it was a huge waste of ingredients.  To salvage it I crumbled some of it, mixed in tex mex shredded cheese and heated it until the cheese melted.  It made it a little better but not much.

This recipe is wonderful, and I make it every Christmas.  To BMORRIS - I have made this the day before and put it in the refrigerator over night.  The casserole becomes quite heavy, it takes quite a long time to reheat, and I was not too happy with the results.

This recipe was the bomb! It was so incredibly easy to make, and even my most picky eater absolutely loved it. Said it was his favorite! I made this at Thanksgiving and now I'm going to make it for Christmas eve dinner. It's hard to describe the texture of it but it's a cross between  creamed corn and bread.
Light and fluffy, delicious!!!!!!!! A MUST try.

I made this cornbread casserole for the first time and it turned out amazing!  Everyone loved it and wants the receipt.  The only thing I did differently was added sugar and cook it in a crockpot in the oven and kept it warm in the crockpot for my Thanksgiving Potluck at work.

I made this as written for a trial run before Thanksgiving.  It's not bad (or good). It's blah. It wasn't creamy nor was it sweet. I really like the idea since I was hoping to get my 4 year old to eat more veggies by disguising them in cornbread.  I will have to play with this recipe to make it better.

I got this recipe from a friend over 10 years ago and use to make it a lot in the beginning. Now on just special occasions since it makes a lot. I add about 1/4 cup of honey to cut the bitterness of the corn bread mix. Just a tip, if you are making this and not sure if it's done, the toothpick trick will not work since it's a partially wet dish and it doesn't brown a whole lot on the top. I just jiggle it after 40-45 minutes and it if doesn't move, it's done. I like the stir it up after about 5 minutes of taking out of the oven to incorporate the two textures together.

Followed directions exactly. Too moist, did not stick together when scooped out of 9x9 pan. Also, I cooked it for 65 minutes at 350 and it was still not golden brown on top. Had to put it in for 10 minutes more on 375. Husband recommended less corn. Next time: I will just use the can of cream corn and cook it on 375 for 50 minutes, to see if that helps. The taste was great and it was a hybrid between a souffle and cornbread.

Would have given it 10 stars if I could have! Perfect recipe as written! After reading some reviews I was nervous. Some people saying it was bland, or added green onions, bacon , chilies, etc. I made the recipe as written. Using a store brand can of corn (which was drained of the liquid), a name brand can of creamed corn, butter,sour cream, 2 jumbo eggs( which was all I had),and the "J"  blue & white box of cornbread mix. I added a couple of grinds of fresh black pepper(for the hubby, I hate pepper,so it wasn't a lot.)  Plus a tablespoon of sugar. My whole family raved about it!  I just made it ,without a warning word of "trying a new recipe"!  It was "ooohed", and "oh my goodness", what is this, "it's so good"! So good in fact, that this is the first recipe I ever rated! I always make the recipes on this site as written, and try NOT to make any changes until trying again if needed. This one is a KEEPER! Hubby already said add it to the Thanksgiving menu! Our cornbread hater of the family enjoyed it also!!! So did the neighbor I gave some too. I made it in a 8x8 pan, as that is what I had on hand. It was very full, cooked at 350 for an hour. It came out lightly crispy on top, moist in the middle, and oh,so AWESOME!

I really like this recipe.

I made just a few changes.   First I chopped up a single serrano pepper, and mixed it in - seeds and all to give a little color and kick.  I also split the batter between two pie shells.  Since it wasn't as thick I decreased the cooking time 5 minutes, and it came out great.  It's like a corny, light quiche.  :-)

Very good recipe, similar to cornbread. I did make a few modifications...used two ears of fresh corn in place of both cans of corn/creamed corn, added some finely diced sweet onion.

What I did. Doubled recipe. Used Marie calendars low fat honey butter cornbread mix. Did not use butter. Sprayed 9x13 glass pan with Pam.   Used one bag of frozen kennel born and one can of kernel corn (cheaper Safeway frozen corn).  Used two cans of cream corn.  This was good but next time trme try better  frozen corn. Added 4 beaten eggs  and 2 cups of light sour cream.  Did not sauté one sweet onion first and it was fine.  Added 3/4 of a pound crisped bacon. Next time use half of bacon inside and sprinkle top with remaininG  bacon and additional cheese on top for last 10 min. Did not sauté the onion first and it was fine. Made a lot but that was good because we had leftovers.

As promised it was a "showstopper" according to the party guest who were observed licking the plate . I did take suggestions of adding onion and cheese. I uses a combo of Vermont white extra sharp cheddar with some fresh grated Parmesan. I also followed to suggestion of placing butter in bottom of the soufflé dish but I did not reduce butter in recipe. Just put about 3 T of melted butter in bottom. I made my own creamed corn from McKenzies frozen fried Iron Skillet corn with cracked pepper. I also used 2 T sugar and Krusteaz Honey Cornbread mix( gave it that grt honey flavor). I cooked for 1h 10 min as my oven cooks a bit slow until it was set in the middle and then browned it und
er broiler.I am making again as we speak per my husbands request for New Years day.This is so easy and a real winner !

I think the name of this dish describes it perfectly!  I made this as a quick and easy side dish for a meal that contained some pretty labor intensive dishes....and of course this was the most popular dish, ha ha!  I didn't make any changes, and it was perfect.  Someone did suggest cheese on top next time, but in my opinion it doesn't need it.  I think this is going to show up often at our family dinners!

I made this  twice this week for 2 different Christmas parties -- the  only thing I did different was put 1 cup of shredded  sharp cheese on top - other wise I made recipe  as directed -- like it says its an "awesome tasting recipe" and my  dish was empty at end of the  potluck with people asking for recipe-  It will become a favorite and its so easy to assemble.

Tried this on a lark, because there should be corn on Thanksgiving.  Its now my go to for pot lucks.  Great leftovers heat it in the microwave with maple syrup, great for breakfast, second choice if the pumpkin pie is gone.

This recipe was a big hit! It went great with chili. I made it to serve 3 people so there were plenty of leftovers. I followed the recipe exactly how it was and I will make it again.

I have made this recipe every Thanksgiving for years, ever since it was printed in a local newspaper's holiday cookbook.  My family absolutely loves it!  The recipe I use has one additional ingredient, that being a 1/4 cup of sugar.  It really adds to the flavor, making it more like a corn pudding.  And, as one other reviewer noted, it takes at least 50 to 55 minutes to bake. Check at 50 minutes, but plan on it taking longer!

LOVE this!  I also replace regular corn with Fiesta corn and it turns out even better!  But if you follow the recipe exact you can't go wrong.  Everyone always asks for the recipe!

This is an amazing base for whatever your heart desires :)
I double everything in the orginal recipe then add whatever is in the pantry lol.
Usually two hand full's of fiesta cheese blend and a can of  genric Rotell. I have if you add more liquid (like not draining the corn, adding salsa, etc.) it takes at least an hour at 350' sometimes longer? Depends how moist you like yours? I've added pretty much everything to this casserole (turkey hot dogs, spam, sausage, hamburger etc.) it always gets eaten :) our favorite side dish with meats is butter beans with hammocks to flavor them and spinach with fried bacon and fresh cracked corn! 
But on that note this casserole can stand alone with a mixed salad anytime. So glad I found this AWESOME AWESOME RECIPE :)

I made this as written... I put it in a 8x10 glass casserole dish. It cooked for 50 min. and it was gooey. I put it in for 10 mins more... I REALLY wanted it to be amazing. I have corn/cornbread lovers...will update, very disappointed. It never tasted good, no matter what I did.

I've made this for at least 20yrs but I've never put eggs in it.  Everyone I know loves it.  Maybe the people who gave this a bad review should try it without the eggs.  I stir the casserole after it's been in the oven 20min, too.

My family liked it more than I did.  It was really easy to make and I followed a reviewer's advice to add something green - which was chopped green onions.  Next time I'll add some chopped mild green chiles to give it more of a bite.

This recipe is EXCELLENT! It's a family favorite. I think that 8.5oz. box of bread mix is a bit vague, as it tastes best with something like the Jiffy Brand Corn Muffin Mix (available in that size box for under a dollar, usually). Anyway, this recipe is quick, easy, fun, tasty, and a keeper for the ages... reminds me of grandma.

WOW!  Awesome recipe.  We added a bag of frozen corn in place of the canned.  I will definately be making this again!  The first time I tasted it was at a potluck dinner.  That cook added cheese to the top.  I am going to try adding bacon, just to see how it effects it.

I thought this was very good.  I did change the recipe by adding some diced onion.  Next time, I might shred some zucchini into the batter.

Really the best corn casserole!! I add 1/2 cup of diced onion and 1/2 cup of diced red bell peppers. Since I like a bit of heat, I finely mince a jalapeño pepper and add to the mix. Make sure the center of the casserole is set before taking out of oven. It seems to take longer to get the center cooked. This is a winner and everyone raves about it! (I'm sure if you made it exactly without additions it would be wonderful as  well.).

Yummy!  Definitely recommend trying this recipe.  All my kids loved it!  Husband loves the cornbread cake, so I thought this would be a great alternative to the store bought mix.  Totally better and tasted great.  Will make again.  I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream as it is much healthier and a great replacement.

This is hands down one of the easiest and tastiest dishes I have in my (somewhat limited) arsenal!  It takes all of five minutes to put together, and comes out wonderfully every time.  I've made it to take to friends' homes, my son's school events, and obviously, just for us to enjoy at dinner.  It saves brilliantly, as well; it's almost better straight out of the refrigerator!  Pairs exceptionally well with BBQ or ribs, and if you want to be "fancy", you can add some cheese.

Wonderful. I used the melt the butter in the pan trick and I am sure that saved me a lot of work. I did not have a can of corn (used one can creamed corn) and used two loaf pans and it was perfect in 45 minutes.  I loved it.  Thanks.

But drain the can of corn so it is not too mushy, also cook for at least 50 minutes.

Made as is.  This was the best corn casserole I've ever had.  Only thing I'm going to do differently next time just to see what it tastes like is adding a small amount of sugar simply because I like sweet cornbread however this recipe is awesome just the way it is.

Every time I've made this everyone loves  it. For Christmas, I'm making a light smorgasbord style luncheon & would love to make this casserole. Can it be left out on the counter & served at room temperature?

This had a great taste to it. I had it in the oven for 15 minutes before i realized I FORGOT THE SOUR CREAM! It tasted great without it, i wonder what the difference would be with the sour cream...at any rate it was a crowd pleaser. I am sure you could make this the night before and refridgerate it and bake it  for some time to warm it back up and maybe get a crisp top again but it really doesnt take any time at ALL to prep and put together and only 45 mins to cook. Also, once it has been in for its 45 mins don't be alarmed if it seems too soft or your fork doesn't come out smooth..remember the cream corn you put in :) its cooked! just let it sit and it will thicken and be yummy!

I love this recipe. I tried it today for Thanksgiving. The process was simply. The results are awesome. I decided to make this recipe, because husband does not like vegetables. I wanted something that I could make that I knew we could both eat. He loves cornbread. Putting the cornbread into a casserole made sense to me. He loves it! I will make this again soon.

Definitely a Hit !!!  Once again it Wins this Thanksgiving as a request from all my guests.  A Delicious creamy comfort dish that just brings joy to the Holidays. Do give it a little more time in the oven and insert a knife in the center making sure it comes out clean.

I have made this recipe several times now.  I just love it!  I get compliments on it every time.  Most of the time I double it for family get-togethers and even if there is some leftover, it tastes wonderful reheated.  I also cut the recipe in half and use the really small cans of corn from the store when just wanting to serve it for dinner and not have so much leftover.  Excellent recipe!!!

This was pretty good after some puttin'. I added a medium diced onion, half a sweet red pepper cubed, a teaspoon of salt and a prodigious dose of black pepper. Next time I may add more corn and a little less corn bread mix.

It was fine.  A little too much egg taste.  I added onions as some reviews suggested.  May try it again with less egg, cheese, no onion.

This is the same recipe I've made for years, and am asked to bring it to every gathering. BUT I add a pinch of salt, dash of pepper, 8 drops of Tobasco, and a Tablespoon or so of sugar, and sometimes add shredded cheddar to the top the last 10 minutes. It's great as written, but the additions give that something extra that stands out. I'll just say: one time there were 4 pans of corn casserole at a reunion, and people asked which one i made, and I always make a double batch, and there is never any left. The pickiest of eaters loved it, and literally Everytime I take it somewhere, people ask for the recipe. I discovered this in my early 20s, and my grandmother, great aunt, mom, mom-in-law, sister-in-law, aunts have all asked for the recipe, and despite it being so simple, having a signature dish that my elders loved so much, made me feel very proud. Even though they have the recipe, they still ask me to make it, Bc its 'my recipe' . And its so forgiving and so easy! This recipe will always have a special place in my heart.

Very good! Fantastic as is but even better (for us) is the addition of a 4 oz can diced mild green chiles added to the corn mixture before baking. Also when almost done we top the casserole with about 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese.

Loved this. Only thing I'd change was my choice of cornbread. The cornbread mix I used, Jiffy, was way too sweet for us. Otherwise, it had a great texture and flavor!

I made this with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and fat free sour cream.  It was delicious but it makes a lot for just two.  We had it a couple times then the rest went in the garbage.  I'll have to wait to make it again if I'm taking it to a potluck or such.

So easy and my husband couldn't stop himself from eating seconds and even thirds of it. This is sweet and it set up perfectly.  I added salt and pepper to taste to the mixture before baking.  This is going in the side dish rotation in my house.

Not bad, and very easy to make. My kids and hubby didn't like it though. Give yourself extra time to let it cook, because it took a lot longer to cook than stated (20 extra minutes).

I couldn't wait to taste this corn casserole. It is mouthwatering good!  In-expensive to make, and a sure crowd pleaser. This would be a great dish to deliver to friends who are recovering from illness, or surgery, shut-ins, or church covered meals.  It tastes as good cold as it does right out of the oven.

Its not Thanksgiving at our house without this!  I change it up a bit, though by softening an onion and green pepper in the butter and adding that to the mix.  I don't stir in the sour cream, I spread it over the top ( I make mine in a 9x13 " pan) and sprinkle sharp cheddar on top.  I've been known to add a red pepper or some green chilis as well.

My sister gave me a very similar recipe a year or so ago, and it is one of my family's favorites.  I think the only thing I do differently is sprinkle, I'm kind of heavy handed, cheddar cheese on the top before I put it in the oven.  I've also added a little salt and pepper to the dish, but otherwise it's the same recipe.

This is as advertised-- simple and delicious. Just make sure you use Jiffy corn bread mix. I made it once with a different brand of corn bread mix, and it was awful.

Definitely lives up to its name - Awesome.  I have served it several times and it is always a hit. You can make it up in advance and then just pop it in the oven when you are ready. Once I substituted Mexicorn for the whole kernel but prefer the original recipe.  I found that it takes 50-55 minutes to cook versus the 45 minutes suggested.

Best corn casserole we have found to date. We take this to all potluck dinners and family reunions.  Everyone loves it and requests the recipe. The only thing we add is a small can of diced green chilies. Very easy and quick to mix up. It's definitely a keeper!

Easy and delish!! Did susbstitue mayo for sour cream and added sugar from the reccommendations. Because is so easy to make, I may try to play around with this recipe a bit by adding a few things but it's excellent the way it is!

There were at least 3 corn puddings at Thanksgiving this year, I thought this was definitely the best of all.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Perfectly moist, melts in your mouth (if cooked peroperly through). Very simple to prepare. I used Marie Callender's Corn Bread Mix and doubled the amount of all ingredients. Made it in a 9 x 13 baking dish, baked for 70 minutes, until a testing knife came out clean and the top was lightly browned. I was looking for something a little different and delicious and this did the trick--scrumptious!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out beautifully. Followed directions exactly. My Dad has made it in the past but without the sour cream and said that he could not taste a real difference, so I may leave it out next time to save on calories and fat. Everyone loves it, especially the kids. Went well with ham.

I love this receipe.  I've made this for years, but I make one change.  I use two cans of CREAM corn and delete the kernel corn.  It's creamier.  Also, bake it in a 9x13 pan so it spreads out and cooks evenly, and NOT in a deep pan.  My in-laws hate it, but they are super super picky and don't eat much of anything.  My family loves it and I've had this at every Thanksgiving since I was little.  This recipe isn't for everyone, but is very good.

The first time I made this recipe it was close to Thanksgiving and ALL the cornbread was sold out... so I found some off brand HONEY cornbread and it was a HIT! I highly suggest using honey cornbread or adding honey to your mix before you bake! And as the other reviews suggest, it takes a little longer to bake!

Made this today in a 9x13 throw away tray and this is what I used: 2 boxes of Jiffy corn mix, 2 cans whole corn drained,  2 cans creamed corn, 1 1/2 cups of low fat sour cream, 1 stick I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (I use it for baking and it was the only butter I had), 3 packs of Splenda, 4 eggs.

It took about an hour to bake and to make it crispy on top, I reserved about 1/4 of the second box of corn mix to sprinkle on the top. The original recipe in a smaller pan (not doubled) called for 1 stick of melted butter. I don't understand how as using 1 stick for doubling the recipe was more than enough. If you are making this recipe from the original version I would suggest NOT using an entire stick of butter unless you are doubling it.

The final result was a sweet cornbread-like soufflé. It was not creamy, what I was hoping for, but needless to say it was still good and the entire tray was eaten. I brought it to a football party and it was definitely something different that I certainly will make again.

When I follow this one to a T, it always turns out fantastic. I could seriously eat this whole casserole on my own if I wasn't aware of the amount of butter. I do tend to bake it for closer to 55 minutes, but that's the only modification I'd make to this recipe.

Delicious! As I am not feeding a small army, I cut the recipe down (1 egg, 1/4 cup butter, 1 small can each of corn and cream corn, 3/4 box of corn muffin mix, 1/2 cup sour cream). I added a few slices of jalapeno, half of a small diced onion, and 1/4 green bell pepper. As the reviews suggested, I cooked it on 350 for 50 minutes. The result was great! An easy, economical, and tasty week night treat. Recommended!

I cut back slightly on the butter and used an olive oil butter stick and used egg beater replacement for the eggs. I baked for approx. 55-60 minutes since I used an 8x8 pan. Fabulous! The calories are for holidays and special occasions only! :)

This recipe is just wonderful as is.  I mixed it all together in the baking dish to save a step.  Also, you can use any corn bread mix (I used a natural brand that our local Walmart sells) that has no trans fat unlike the Jiffy mix.

I agree it takes longer to bake than 45 minutes. If top starts to get too brown, just loosely lay a piece of foil over. 

I baked until it wasn't jiggly at all in the middle and next time I'll remove when it's slightly jiggly because it continues to cook after removing from oven.

Very good, whole family loved it. I only had an 11 oz can of whole corn and it was no biggie. I did have to cook it longer, maybe 10-15 min longer for golden brown.

Yes, I agree it was a very easy recipe to make. However, I baked it for 40 minutes instead of 45 and it was very dry around the edges and just right in the center. Had to cut away about 3" from the edges. Taste was good though.

Made it tonight and it was great!  I always try to stick to the recipe, but I can't eat wheat, so I had to sub my own corn meal and flour for the corn muffin mix.  Also, I only had kernel corn, (no creamed) still tasted great!!

My husband and I didn't care for this too much. Definitely pay attention to the reviews that say you have to like your corn bread "pudding style". I certainly like mine very moist but not like pudding. I won't make it again.

I have been making this recipe for many years, and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews. It's pretty common on the east coast, but I live in Utah now, and it's always a surprise hit out here! Easy side dish, popular at holidays, and never fails.

I made this for the holidays and it was all gone by the end of the meal, this coming from people who said they didn't like scalloped corn. Try this instead you won't be disappointed.

I've made this with chopped onions, jalepenos, bacon bits, and shredded cheese added to the mix, which I believe improves the texture and taste. I also like to add a little bit of sugar and salt as well to make it more flavorful. Goes great with a meal, saves well, and makes a tasty snack too!

I loved this dish! It was very easy to make. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan and baked it for about an hour. It came out perfect. Firm, yet moist. I also added some chopped green onion like another reviewer suggested. I brought it to a family party and it was a hit! Definitely will make again.

I thought it was good but a little too creamy. I like the concept of the corn but I like it a bit drier so I would recommend using half the creamed corn proposed. I halved the butter and it was perfect. Very easy to make. Fat free sour cream works just as well!

I made this for the 1st time for Christmas.  I was in a bit of a rush and I forgot to add the sour cream.  Even with the sour cream missing, it was a HUGE hit, everyone loved it and kept going back for more.  I'll be making this as a regular addition to my recipies.

Fantastic!  We served this with a Honeybaked ham for  Christmas and it complimented the flavors well.  I believe if I serve it with a main entree that isn't so sweet then I'll add a little sugar to the casserole.  I didn't have a 9x9" pan so I used a 3 quart round casserole dish.  The casserole wasn't quite settled in the middle of course so I covered the top with foil and baked for another 15 minutes.  Perfect!  We will definitely make this again!

This is a wonderful recipe and I also make it in a slo cooker.  Put everything in the slow cooker and cook it on high about 3 hours or when it appears to be firm.  Great for a holiday dinner so you don't have to worry about oven space.

I've been following this recipe for the past two years, bringing it to family and church events - it works well every time!  I find that a single recipe does well in a glass pie dish, and a double recipe in a 9x13 pan.  I often grind a bit of fresh pepper on top before baking, also - wonderful!  (and I will admit that once I had things all set out, and the drained can of corn was by the sink and was inadvertently left out.  The dish just tasted a little more like a creamy cornbread, but it was still very good.)

I just made this dish for Thanksgiving, it was a huge hit. The different styles of corn, and corn bread made it so moist and delicious. I doubled the recipe, and so it had to cook at least an extra 20min.

Very popular for family Thanksgiving.   Doubled the recipe, put some in a 13x9 pan, the remainder in a round casserole dish.  Perfect for adult table, and kids table.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone LOVED it! Everyone went back for seconds! I added 1/2 a can of jalapeños, few bacon bits, and a handfull of cheese and it was splendid! Have a feeling I'll be asked to make this often!

Absolutely delish!!!! So very easy. I made it the day before, put it on a platter, wrapped it in plastic wrap and kept in the fridge. Popped it in the microwave for a few minutes right before Thanksgiving dinner.

I added this dish at the last minute because I wanted another color for our Thanksgiving Plate.  It was a huge hit - delicious!  Hubby said we have to keep this one on the regular Thanksgiving menu.  I added a bit of sugar (maybe about 1/8 cup), buttered the casserole dish and baked for exactly one hour.  PERFECT!

I was a little nervous, as I brought this to a Thanksgiving get together without trying it first. It was a hit! Everyone enjoyed it! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I've been making this the past few years for Thanksgiving.  My wife loves it and asks  for it all year long.  I do add 1/2 of a  diced red bell pepper and a diced medium onion for a little crunch.  I only use 1 egg and add 1 cup of mild cheese (colby or med. cheddar). It  makes a great side to poultry.

When I ask what I can bring, everyone always says, "the corn casserole!"  We have 2 dinners to attend so I make 2 double batches (1- 9X13 for each event).  There is never any left!  I have even been asked to start bringing more so everyone could have two or three servings!!!
I make it exactly how it says, and it is always great.

I enjoyed this recipe.  It was very easy to make and my guests and family loved the dish.  Its also very forgiving. I forgot the butter until 15 mins after it was in the oven then went again and put it in and it still came out nice.

Until this afternoon I had never heard of corn casserole, just ran into it on the internet. I read several reviews on different websites and it seems like its a big hit with 99% of the people.  So, I just HAD to make it tonight.  It was OK but I won't be looking for anymore corn casserole recipes.  Its nothing special, might as well just open a can of creamed corn.  Sorry.. but thanks.

This was just OK for us - I can't get past the tin-can taste of canned corn, particularly canned creamed corn. Probably won't make again.

Excellent....would not change a thing.  I used a 13x9x2 rectangle pan, baked for 40 minutes and it turned golden brown.  Let it cool for 30 minutes...tastes better after it cools down a bit..

I made this dish this evening. The only thing I changed was adding salt. I baked it for an hour and 10 minutes at 375 degrees and it was still gummy in the middle. No one liked this dish.

I was responsible some of the food  for a group breakfast last year. I made a double batch of this casserole in a large flat cake pan and served it with maple syrup. I also made pork pan sausage patties with extra black pepper and sage.  This was a BIG hit!
You can make it ahead and just zap the squares in the micro -- worl
ks well.

I read several of the recipes here and strayed a bit from all but this was the one I followed closest. It is very good and easy and would be an ideal recipe for a child or young adult learning to cook. 
I subbed a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix for the  corn bread mix. And I threw in 1/4 tsp. paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and white pepper for interest. My daughter loves corn cassersole at the family gatherings but it was the first time I'd made it. She said it was very good!

Made this on Sunday for a family get together, turned out beautifully. I doubled the recipe with no trouble, if you double the recipe, expect to cook much longer. So simple and easy to make.
It was all gone by the end of the meal, tasty.

Needs some tweaking (e.g. bacon, shallots, roasted peppers) to compliment the sweetness, but quite good flavor and texture as is.

Loved this! Was surprised at how good it was. Made a few changes. I did not have just a can of regular corn on hand so I threw in some frozen corn and added a little bit of milk. I also added some cheese and a can of green chilis. Compliments from everyone at the table. Will for sure make again!

Love this recipe.  Tried this a few years ago from a friend of mine but the only difference was they added cheese to the top during the final ten minutes or so.  I like it better this way.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very tasty!  I did add a little sprinkle of salt to mine while I was eating it to give it a little more flavor, but that is just my preference.  I followed the recipe exactly and ended up baking mine for 55 minutes.  Will make again, thank you!

Very yummy. Made this for a cookout we just had (Smoke BBQ Briskett). Everyone loved it. So I have to say it can easily compliment either a Holiday Dinner or a Summertime Cookout.

The recipe was super easy, used everyday ingredients and looked nice when pulled from the oven. My only challenge - it lacked a bit in the flavor department. Because there are so many positives about this recipe, I may try this again adding cayenne, diced green chilis and onion for a kick.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was the first casserole to go.  Felt like a fraud when I revealed how easy it was to make!  Had to make it for Christmas and again this year for the Holidays.  Too easy and so good!  Sour cream adds a nice touch.. oh and I use white corn to make it a little "fancier".  I also double the recipe and put it in a 9X13.  Turns out fine.

Instead of using one box of Jiffy corn muffin mix, I used 2. This was a huge hit! Don't serve it before the meal though, as everyone will be too full to eat the meal, as it is hard to stop eating once you start. Bake about 55 min. *****

Another winning recipe for my Thanksgiving meal. i did not change a thing.  My family and Loved it. It was so creamy and delicious! I see why it has such high ratings. I condense the butter just a tad bit.

I loved this, my sons did too, DH not so much, but he's fussy so I'm not considering his opinion for how many stars to give this :) Followed recipe closely, used 1/2 the butter though and that's the only change I made.  Very good recipe, will make this again!

This is such a great "go-to" recipe.  I leave out the sour cream so it is firmer and sprinkle paprika on top for color.

wonderful dish! First made this for a family Thanksgiving dinner about 3 yrs ago and it disappeared quick!  Make it a couple times a month at home, usually as a side to a chicken entree. Print extra copies and be prepared to pass them out!

This recipe is delicious.  We followed the recipe verbatim except for using reduced fat sour cream (couldn't tell the difference in this recipe).  We also ended up cooking it for 55 minutes because we only had an 8x8.  It was delicious and addicting...foodie be ye warned!

Very very good. I couldn't wait to taste it, and so I tasted it hot out of the oven...I was disappointed. I realized thats its like tasting brownies right out of the oven...the flavors have not settled. Once they were just warm...OMG FAB!!

I made this tonight to try something diff to bring to thanksgiving. It is ok alittle bland so i added some nutmeg and sugar. I think it needs some onions personally to make it more flavorful. But other than that it was good.

Wanted to test run before trying on a crowd. Tried to follow the recipe as written except I did not have enough plain sour cream so used some chives flavor sour cream. Might just use this flavor in the future.  Baked in a 11 x 7 pyrex which was the perfect size.   Baked the 45 minutes and a few extra to brown.  Husband liked it and so did I but I love cornbread.  Very easy, no fuss recipe that changes up a plain side dish.  Will double for large gathering.

Made exactly as recipe said except had to add an extra 7 minutes to cooking time.  This tasted alright but tasted more like just a jazzed up corn bread rather than calling it a casserole.  But as long as you realize that, it was ok.

I forgot to drain the corn and it still turned out great!  I am not going to drain the corn next time. We loved the moist consistency. It was not runny nor hard, it was just right for us. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

UPDATE: I have made this many, many times and everyone loves it. I double it for Thanksgiving. I still don't drain the corn. We love it that way.

This was really simple and delicious. My kids really enjoyed it with their roasted hot dogs and pasta salad. I'll be making this again. I did omit the sugar because I was using Jiffy's Sweet box cornbread mix. But if I were using another brand that isn't sweet, I'd add the sugar right in. Plus I believe that if you switch to a can of mexican blend corn with onions and bell peppers, it would work rather nicely.

Prepared this according to original recipe and it came out very well.  Took a little longer to cook in my oven -- about 50-55 min. Everyone liked this.  An excellent side dish for chicken or ham.

THis is SO good, Jeff even likes it. I added about 2 TBLS of the corn juice and folded in some green chili for spice. I baked it for one hour in a glass dish. VERY good.EDIT: not so good as leftovers.

I made this for a potluck and took home an empty dish.  Everybody loved this!  I did add half the water in the can of corn and also pepper and onion powder.  This recipe is DELICIOUS!  Thanks for sharing.

I baked in a 8 x 8 baking dish and baked 15mins longer. I wasn't really sure that it was baked enough. My hubby said that it was like souffle and 
my 6 year old daughter loved it. Next time, I'm gonna try with a 9 x 9 dish and still bake longer than stated 45 minutes.

This is one of our classic dishes as Thanksgiving dinner.  Great recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing.  It even works in the crock pot about 2 hours on high...Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I did not have sour cream so I used a mixture of more butter and milk. I also added two tablespoons of sugar as well. It was really good, I will definitely make it again!

It's so funny - I was going through my recipe box, and I had saved this recipe a long time ago. BUT a friend recently passed the recipe along after we had this dish at her house.  Didn't even realize I had the same recipe saved!  It's really very tasty, and toddler-approved!  I made it for New Year's Day dinner (along with Emeril's Hoppin' John), and our guests really enjoyed it as well - no leftovers!

Every Christmas I make a new dish for my family to try and they will either give me a thumbs up or down... According to them, this was a sure hit!! They loved it.  I also added about 5 drops of yellow flavoring to my batter to make sure this is a pretty yellow color since some of the other reviews said they added bell peppers or something to give it some color.  Wonderful dish! I will make this again!!

Very good!  Everyone really liked it!  I did not have corn bread mix so I made my own.  I baked in an 8X8.  It took about 10-15 mins longer to bake than stated.

I have been making a version of this recipe for over 15 yrs. My original recipe didnt call for any eggs, but often I will add (in addition to my cans of corn) a quart of my home frozen sweet corn to expand the recipe and then I will add an egg to make it set up properly. To the person to was wondering if you can make it ahead of time? SURE...mix it all up, put it in the fridge and bake it the next day, it will be fine!

This was sooooo good.  I actually followed the suggestions of a few others and added half the butter (1/4 cup) and half of the liquid from the whole kernel corn.  I had to bake it for about 60 minutes, but it really was awesome!! Everyone commented on it over and over! I will definitely be making this again!

This turned out great the other night. I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was absolutely delectable. I did cook it longer than it said because it was so creamy. Still it wasn't cooked long enough for my taste, but my husband loved it and that's all that matters! ;) Definitely a keeper in our household!!!!

I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could. I made this for Thanksgiving and MAN was it a hit. My husband loved it and took the leftovers with us camping. Even my sister and sister in law raved about it. This will be a staple at our Holiday table from now on. I made just as directed and wouldn't dream of changing anything.

I have made this numerous times and everyone had always loved it.  It is so easy to throw together that we do not wait for family gatherings to make it anymore.  I noticed a few people mention in their reviews that it was a bit bland, but I think a recipe like this is meant to be seasoned to your personal taste.  You would not just dump a can of corn in a pan and serve it without at least adding butter, salt, pepper, etc.  So, I do not know why someone would make this and not season it.  I realize the recipe does not note this, but I just assumed that was a given.  I usually add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder when I make this.  No certain measurements, just a sprinkling until it looks about right.  Also, if you are looking for a little more interest, try using french onion chip dip in place of the sour cream.

I added 1/4 cup of Splenda, to add just a hint of sweetness. And, I accidentally left out the butter. It still came out delicious - enough so that I don't think I'll add it (and the calories) from here on out. Great recipe!! Doesn't last long. :-D

I read this recipe and read the reviews.  One reviewer had mentioned that she substituted cream cheese for the sour cream.  One other reviewer had mentioned chopped green chilies.  So, I doubled the recipe, added two cans of chopped green chilies.  I used cream cheese instead of sour cream.  I used four cups of frozen super sweet corn instead of canned corn.  I ran hot water over the frozen corn and let it drain.  I added one teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  I baked the 13x9 pan of corn pudding for one hour at 350 degrees.  I took it to Sunday dinner with the family and got RAVES!!!  It is now my favorite side dish recipe.

This was not enjoyed by my family this Thanksgiving.  It was easy to make, but it needed a little something more.  I may try it again and add sauteed onions or a little cayenne pepper.

Used for Thanksgiving this year (09) and it was a hit. I had 2 bags of 6.5 oz corn muffin mix so used those instead of one 8.5 oz and added a can of green chilis.  Did not double entire recipe, just the additional muffin mix and it made a 9x13 just perfectly.  Plan to make this every year now along with the green bean casserole.

This was really good...kind of like corn bread.  I made it as a side for Thanksgiving so I made it in the crock pot since there wasn't room in the oven.  On high for 3 hours and it turned out great!

I didn't want to make this on Thanksgiving as I have had only bad experiences trying something for the first time on a holiday-now I wish I had! I made this the day after to go with turkey leftovers, and it was great!  Simple, creamy, and delicious-the perfecdt side dish.

I made this to go with our Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit. I will definately make it again. I added a big tablespoon full of brown sugar to make it sweet. Other than that, I didn't change a thing!

This was awesome! I made exactly as directed except for sprinkling chopped green onions on the top. I thought about adding some shredded cheddar but didn't, and am glad because it didn't need it! I did have to bake it about 15 minutes longer than the instructions though, but possibly due to using an 8" X 8" instead of a 9" X 9"

I also made this for Turkey Day and it was fabulous!  I think I will take the suggestion of one reviewer and add a little of the water from the kernel corn since I like my casseroles just a little wetter... followed this to a T and it was great!

made it for thanksgiving yesterday and it went in a flash, everyone loved it. i added 1/2 of the water from the whole corn as suggested by others because i wanted it soft. It was, and it was delicious. I also added a little diced sweet red pepper (from a jar) just for color. a definite keeper recipe and it is now being sent to all my sisters to add to their collections. cook time was accurate for me. thanks for this easy, awesome recipe!!

Huge hit at thanksgiving dinner.  I doubled the recipe (except for the butter, kept that at 1/2 cup) and baked in a 9x13 pan for about an hour.  Fantastic.

This is sooooo yummy!  I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and 1/2 light sour cream + 1/2 full fat sour cream.  I had to double the recipe for thanksgiving (feeding more than 6 people).  Enjoy!!

I tried this out the other day as a practice run before preparing a lot for Thanksgiving guests.  My only change was less butter (1/4 cup) and I used lite sour cream.  My husband, who usually says merely that something "tastes good," was downright ecstatic!  He had three helpings and made me promise I would make it again, "just like this."  It was what you call a winner - and a big batch will be on my Thanksgiving table.  It is in the oven now!

Delicious!  I added a little bit of sugar and also some baking powder/baking soda (because I used corn meal flour).  I also used just a little less butter/margarine than the recipe called for.  Unlike some people, I didn't have a dryness issue.  The casserole turned out pretty moist (I didn't add any extra liquid like others suggested).  Thanks for the recipe!

The title says it all! It got rave reviews from all who tasted! I did take the recommendations from others: 1/2 stick butter, 1 egg, only a little of juice from whole kernel corn, and 1/2 can of chopped green chilis. The outside cooked quicker than the middle (@ 375), but it was still tasty with the inside a little gooey. Will definitely make again, and have shared the recipe!

This was exactly as the title says -- Easy and Awesome! The first time I made it, it was more like a dry pudding, but the hubby said he wanted it to be more like corn bread, so I used more of the corn bread mix and it was just as great!

Definitely easy, my 1 yr old could not get enough of this stuff!  Made as directed, but did bake a little bit longer, maybe b/c I used a round 2 1/2 qt pan?   Good stuff. Hubby said he would eat it again.

My husband and kids LOVE corn so I thought I'd try this, I bumped it up a notch by adding half a finely minced red bell pepper, and a jalapeno out of the garden for a southwest flair. Before popping in the oven I sprinkled on some parmesan cheese and paprika over the top.  Let me tell you this smells heavenly while baking, they were all begging for dinner!  I served it with Sloppy Joes which is always a favorite. Next time I may add some sharp cheddar, we will enjoy this again soon - It was a hit!!!

This is a wonderful recipe! I first had this at a very spiffy B & B and looked for the recipe.  They had added  chopped green onions, red and green peppers--and garnished it with a whole green onion baked on top.  My own personal variation is adding a small can of chopped mild green chili peppers and using another can of whole peppers that I make into thin strips and cross hatch on top for decoration.  Regardless of what you add, it is a favorite of everyone from kids to grandpa.

Awesome and Easy just as the title suggests.  My 13 year old son says "its a keeper".  I lightened the butter by half and added half the liquid from the whole kernel corn - worked just great!

Try this for a unique taste. Replace the butter with 1/4 cup of oil, add 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/2 tsp pepper and 1 tsp of salt.  Bake for about 1 hour.  Middle should be firm.  I also double it and cook it in a 9 x 13.  Great for those non-meat lovers.

We've been making this at my house for years, where it is lovingly known as "wet cornbread". Nice at the holidays because you can make it a day ahead and cook it the next day.

My daughter gave me a version of this recipe several years ago and it's absolutely delicious.  She puts 1 cup of shredded Swiss cheese in with the other ingredients and after baking, puts 1/2 cup shredded Swiss cheese on top and it melts from the heat of the cooked cornbread.  She doesn't use creamed corn either, just a 8 oz. package of frozen whole kernel corn.  I never liked cornbread before I tasted this . . . it's not coarse and it's a sweeter version.  Yummy.

We made it for the first time on Thanksgiving, 6 years ago.  Since then, it's become a Thanksgiving "regular" -- excellent, it really is, and easy, and all I can think of to add is to make two pans, because it will be well-loved by both adults and children.

I received this recipe from my grandmother over 30 years ago, it has been a must for holidays for over 3 generations.  Although my grandmother made this with regular cornbread it is still the most favorite side dish in our family.

I have been making this same recipe for several years with one little extra ingredient: add 2 tablespoons of sugar. The sugar really boosts the flavor and makes this dish terrific. Leftovers reheat in the microwave very well, too. I serve this a least once a month as a side dish with pork or poultry. Even my kids like it!

I have made this many many times.  It is one of my husbands favorites.  I will make it one night for dinner, then he will eat it for breakfast the next day.  Cold or hot.  This is a great recipe.

I have also made this side dish for ages; an instant hit with NO left-overs!  HOWEVER: my recipe does not call for any eggs and the whole kernel corn is NOT drained.  I also use light sour cream and add some salt & pepper just to taste.  This is then baked at 350 degrees for an hour - be sure to spray your baking dish with Pam or other cooking spray!  Enjoy - this is definitely a trusty stand-by!!

A dear friend that I  met on a trip to England gave this to me in 1993 and this has been a family favorite since.  Whenever I have to bring a casserole, they will say "bring YOUR corn casserole"  I will read the other reviews, but I doubt I could do anything to improve it.

This was tasty! I cooked mine accrding to recipe, but had to increase my cooking time by 22 min. more than called for. It took awhile to be a little brown on top, but worth the wait! Also, I used low-fat sour cream and 1 egg & 1 egg white. I think it would taste just the same with 2 egg whites and less butter (maybe only 1/4 cup)to cut down the cholesterol and calories. I will try that version next time :).

A really nice departure from potatoes when you're serving pork or ham.  My kids love this and it goes together in a snap.  This is comfort food at it's best.  Great with any kind of BBQ too.

This was really a good recipe.  I doubled the recipe, but did not double the amount of butter.  I added about 2-3 TBS sugar and it was great!  I took it to a potluck picnic today and had several requests for the recipe.  Hubby had two huge helpings.  I guess that says it all :)  I usually try not to alter the recipe very much the first time I make it from this site.  But I knew we prefer a sweeter cornbread and we are watching the cholesteral here.  Again, thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good!! I followed the recipe exactly, and since I only had a 2 quart baking dish cooked for 50 minutes. The texture was very good (firmer on top, creamier in middle) and everyone loved it. Will definitely make again!

I loved this recipe even though I did change a few things. I used fat free sour cream cause that's all I had. The cornbread mix I had was only a 6.5 oz pack so I used smaller cans of corn accordingly. After mixing it all together, I thought it was a little runny so I added a teaspoon or two of corn starch. I also added a small can of green chillies,finely chopped onion and a Mexican bland of cheeses. Pinches of salt and pepper went into the mix and I topped with some of the cheese. It took about 55 minutes for it to get browned but the result was nothing short of amazing. I will now use this as my go-to corn pie recipe!

Thought this was good, very easy and quick to make.  I took others suggestions and added sugar which I think added a wonderful slight sweetness to it.  My only hesitation about making it often in the future is that it is really still very similar to regular corn bread.

This was good but I found I did not have cream corn after I had already started and had to make a change so instead of cream corn I used a second can of corn and addeda can of condinced cream of chicken soup.  It worked just fine.  I will try as written next time to see which is better.  Thanks

I received this recipe from a friend about 7 or 8 years ago and I've been making it ever since.  I've done variations of it as well- such as putting it on top of chili in a casserole dish and baking it all together.  This is so creamy and a little bit sweet....  We love this!

I always make this as a side dish to the "Slow Cooker Taco Soup" recipe also found on this site. I add a can of drained green chiles, salt, pepper, and chopped cilantro. I bake it in individual ramekins and then invert on the plate so it looks pretty. Never had a problem with dryness or blandness.

A great addition to this dish is a teaspoon of dried thyme. (Thyme and corn pair so nicely.) Like other reviewers, I found it needed an extra 8-10 minutes of baking time, but otherwise came out perfectly. It was very easy to make, and goes especially well with ham.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now (about time I rate it!).  It is the best I've ever had.  A few times someone else has brought a corn casserole when I did and mine always looked better and was the first to go.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This really is awesome and easy creamy corn casserole. I made this for Thanksgiving and my future mother-in-law absolutely loved it she said I have to make it for all of our holiday gatherings now...it's "my dish". The only thing is it says 8 servings but the way we ate it i would say 4 sevings. lol

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit, and several friends have already  requested I make another for XMas dinner. I did add my own twist, instead of using 2 cans of creamed corn, I used one and substituted the 2nd can for 1/2 a can of coconut milk..which gave it an awesome flavor..rich and delicious.

This turned out to be just pretty good. Everyone raved over, however I felt it was a bit bland. I would give it 3 and 1/2 stars but that's not an option. What I liked about it is its creaminess and it's super easy to make. I did not use canned whole corn and instead used frozen corn (I steamed it before combining with all ingredients), I used light margarine, and reduced fat sour cream, simply because those are staples in our househole. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 casserole dish for 110 minutes. Next time I make this, I would like to carmelize chopped shallots or an onion and incorporate that into the mix and add some fresh cracked pepper to taste and maybe a pinch or two of sugar.

This was really good for today's Thanksgiving dinner. I made the recipe as indicated, but baked it in a 13x9 dish for an hour at 350 and found it to be plenty thick and with a great texture without "doubling" the recipe. I may have added a tad more sour cream than called for as I sometimes skip measuring and eye things, but it was moist without being mushy or underdone. Mine was not like a pudding and again in my opinion had wonderful texture... exactly what I was looking for in this dish; I say 5 stars for a wonderful recipe!

I made this for a party and it was a big hit! I thought it was easy to make and really delicious. My only small hang up is on how much butter is used, next time I make this I think I would reduce the amount of butter. Besides that it tasted delicious!

This has been a family favorite for years. We call it "corn stuff". The only difference is that I bake mine for an hour in a round casserole dish. Occasionally I'll add a handful of shredded cheese and/or some green chili's and some shredded onion. It's a great recipe that can be quite versatile.

I thought this was simple and very good. I'm going to try some different corn bread mixes to seee which one I like the best. It took a little longer to bake than the recipe stated. But the recipe is a winner. I think I'll make it for potlucks.

This was good. It was very easy and did take about 50 minutes to cook. Probably won't make again since family says they prefer their cornbread separate from their corn. *sigh

Lives up to its awesome name and reputation, absolutely.  I took this to a funeral dinner today, and baked a small portion of it for myself last night.  Delicious.  I made a 9x13 pan, and baked for 90 min. I added sauteed chopped celery, green pepper, and red pepper. I had an envelope of "roasted corn soup" that I mixed in, dry, and I also added a 3/4 cup of divine garlic-gourney cheese that I bought for crackers.  Since it came in a 3 pack, I thought it would add a bit of the pizazz that others have said the flavor needs.  Oh, and I also added about a cup of grated low fat Mexican cheese. I will definitely be cooking this over many times.

This is a favorite for anytime of year!  Someone posted about subbing mayo for the sour cream and it works beautifully!  We have a dairy allergy, so now everyone can enjoy.

Loved it.  Very creamy and tasted great.  My 9 year old asked for seconds!  The other two children liked it as well.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for sharing.

Instead of using plain whole kernel corn, I used a can of Mexi-Corn which gave this recipe a little different taste.  I took this recipe to two large family gatherings for Christmas this year and it was a great success.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  Our Poppi said he hasn't seen this dish in a while.  Everyone enjoyed it.  This was YUMMY!  I think I will make it again for our next Christmas get-together!!  (You may want to cook it for 1 hr to an hour + 15 min.  Just until the middle stops jiggling and when you can comb a toothpick clean.)  Very easy for a beginner and it was my first time trying it!!

This recipe was yummy and so easy!  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly and it turned out great.  Based on the reviews, I baked it for an hour right off the bat and it turned out great.   Update:  After a year of making this on a regular basis, I decided to try subbing unsweetened applesauce for the butter.  It still turned out delicious and was healthier too.  I also always use light or fat free sour cream.

I made this for Thanksgiving and plan to make again at x-mas.  I added cheese to the top during the last 5 mins like others suggested!  **My only complaint was I had to bake it for longer then 45mins.  It was still jiggly & pudding like.  I baked an extra 20-30 mins and it was AWESOME!!!**

I made this Corn Casserole for Thanksgiving and it deserves 10 Stars. This recipe was fabulous and I think everyone at the party asked me for the recipe. This is the 1st time I have used this site but I am very excited about it now because my Corn Dish was the 1st to go out of any dish on Thanksgiving.

Thanks again and I look forward to more yummy recipes!

I made this for our family Thanksgiving dinner. The only thing that I changed is that I used lite French Onion Dip in place of the sour cream. Everyone enjoyed it . . . we'll definitely make it again!

I gave this 5 stars with the changes that I made to the recipe: I used 2 boxes of the Jiffy cornbread mix and added 1/4 cup of sugar.  I did not add the can of whole kernel corn. I added the other ingredients as noted in the recipe. The result is more of a corn "bread" that can be sliced and served. The 1/4 c sugar does not make it too sweet.

I am the kitchen manager of a local club where I live and can put any special on the menu that I choose.  I did a banquet for 100 people and used this recipe along with the dinner that I made.  It was a smashing success.  I am still getting compliments on it and requests to make it again.  Thanks!

This is delicious. The only thing I don't follow is to use a Jiffy Muffin mix package. I mix the dry ingredients from the Golden Sweet Cornbread mix on this site and use that instead. Oh yes- and I sprinkle a bit of sugar on the top of the batter before I put it into the oven. That's it. This cornbread is awesome!

I have fixed this awesome dish many times and just recently doubled it and served it as a side dish to our RV club at a monthly campout. I doubled it thinking that there would be some remaining and my hubby and I could have some the next day.  NO WAY!  They scraped the dish clean and demanded the recipe!   This recipes is THE BEST. On the campout I didn't have canned whole kernel corn so I used a package of frozen niblets corn with butter sauce that I had on hand and omitted the butter in the recipe.  I also used a bit more sour cream to finish off the carton. I will make this dish over and over, and always double it for company so that there will always be enough to go around for seconds and thirds!

First time making corn casserole and it turned out perfect! I added about a 1/4 C of Half&Half as my family (mainly my grandma) loves rich corn casserole. I also used about 12oz of my own cornbread "mix" (just the dry in gredients I normally use when making cornbread). After dinner with the 6 of us, there wasn't any left!

Outstanding.  I used this for a crowd and it was great - the complements just kept on coming.  For variation I have also layered this in the dish with zucchini and it got rave reviews too.

This is always a hit when I make it. I've had more people ask for this recipe then any other recipe I've tried. The only think I change is I add a hint of sugar.

Definately a keeper!! I doubled the recipe the first time I made it, and I'm glad I did!  It disappeared in one setting!!  I added 2 tbsp sugar (just add 1 tbsp if not doubling the recipe as is) and it took appx 45 minutes to bake a doubled recipe in a 9 x 13 glass dish.  This will no doubt be a family recipe from now on!  Thanks Ruthie!!

Didn't change the recipe one bit!!  Just served it for Easter dinner, it was so easy just to throw it in the crock pot. I had both sides of my family over for Easter and everyone just loved it!!   It does make a TON though....I wonder if you could freeze the leftovers?

I made this dish three times for Thanksgiving and Christmas. They always turn out really good. My husband and my in-laws really like it :)

I doubled this in a 9x13 pan for an extended family dinner.  Worked well with reduced fat sour cream, and took a little longer than 45 minutes with the large pan.  Absolutely wonderful!

Wow.  So simple!  I did a bbq fest last night, and used recipes all from this site. Baby back ribs w/ dry rub, bbq beef, 4chz mac and this casserole!!  The casserole was the biggest hit!  Don't change a thing! Update: I make this often as a side dish and therefore have to play with baking times due to main entrees.  I have made in advance, fridged it, and then baked at 300 for 1hr 30 mins and it was perfect.  I prefer this a little overcooked compared to undercooked.

This was sooo delicious!! I made some modifications, though. 

I halved the recipe but kept a whole can of creamed corn. This made it really runny and wet. If I didn't use a whole can, I'm sure it would have been more corn bread-like. 

I substituted plain non fat yogurt for sour cream. I substituted frozen corn instead of a can (no salt!). I added 1/2 a package of pepper jack cheese and 1/4 cup of jalapenos because my boyfriend loves it spicy. 

Even if I didn't make the substitutions, it would have been delicious!! I will DEFINITELY make this again.

Nice twist on cornbread.  This turned out very moist and was delicious.  I omitted the can of regular corn and also added a few dashes of hot sauce for a kick.  I baked it for approx. 50- 55 min and it was perfect.  I will definitely make again!

This is so awesome!  I have been looking for a recipe like one I had in a restaurant. It was called Indian cornbread casserole.  This is it!  Just add some pimentos and green onions and it tastes exactly the same.  So glad I found this!  Try it, you'll love it...

I doubled the recipe, but had to cook it longer since it went in a 12x8 pan. By the time people went thru the buffet, it wasn't warm anymore. It was good (like a cornbread), but may have been creamier if eaten hot.

I doubled the recipes for thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge success.  It literally takes 5 minutes to prepare.  I used homemade canned sweet corn instead of regular corn.  Also good the next day warmed up!  Will make again.

I was among the many who made this for Thanksgiving.  Mom didn't want it, because "we don't have a corn dish" for this holiday.  She, like the rest of us, was wowed.  Really good flavor. Will make from now on.  Thanks.

Oh my!  This was such a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner!  I stumbled across the recipe while looking for something else.  Had all the ingredients on hand and figured I'd give it a shot.  Every single person there raved about it and asked for the recipe.  This will become a staple in this family...I can't wait to make it again!  I made it exactly as written, though I will try it next time with half the butter to compare.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I first tried this recipe about 6 years ago for a family function. Since then, everyone in my family and extended family have asked for the recipe. Even my co workers are using it!!! It's a great side dish for special occasions.

I tried this recipe for a big get together...there was not one bite left.  And everyone was asking for the recipe so they could make it for their upcoming Thanksgiving dinners.  I also added shredded cheese on the top for the last 5 minutes of baking...delicious.

I have made this recipe every year since 2006. It's now a Thanksgiving staple and still the one dish that never has leftovers.

This was my original review from 2006...
This was so easy and so amazing. I made it last Thanksgiving and it was the one recipe I had to forward to every guest.

I followed the directions as is, and it came out perfect! (U did cook it for an extra 10 minutes though) I served this with chili and it was a hit with my all of my friends, guys and girls.  Great recipe!  I have also served this with pork tenderloin, it was great then too.  Thanks for the recipe!

this recipe is like your mommies banana poudding with extra vanilla waffers. I added a 1/4 cup of sugar and cooked it for 10 minutes longer then the r
recipe called for.  My family loved it. My husband id heating some-up now for a bed time snack . Very yummy.  I will forsure make again.

Honestly, I'm not a huge fan. I followed the recipe exactly and I simply could not get the middle of the casserole to bake through. After an hour, I finally covered it with foil to prevent the top from getting too brown, 
turned the oven to 400 and put it in for a final 15 minutes. It was finally cooked but the other dishes I had made were cold at this point. I also wasn't too excited with the flavor. I don't think I would make this recipe again... I'll be looking for a new one.

I enjoy another corn casserole from this site better, but this one is definitely easier and quicker.  This was very moist and I thought it could have cooked for another 5 minutes or so.  The taste was good, we like this on the sweeter side.  I used some other suggestions from reviewers - added 1/4 cup sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 cream cheese.  This will be great to use when I'm pressed for time, thanks!

A very tasty side dish and so easy to make.  I put chopped jalapeno peppers in this for a bit more 'kick'.  It was great and I'll be making this again.

So good, I made it just as directed and it was great. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it had to cook much longer than suggested, which made my 4th of July dinner late.

I'm adding my 5 stars to the rest of them.  This was so good.  I followed the recipe exactly - except my baking dish was 8 inches so I had to bake it an additional 15 minutes.  Some people said it came out dry, I have no idea how that could have happened, it was so moist and delicious.  I brought a big spoonful for lunch today - can't wait to eat it!!

Wonderful different corn casserole. Didn't change anything but baked for 1 hour. Update-My family request this casserole at all our family holidays. The grandchildren especially enjoy this and want it in their cookbooks to enjoy for years to come.  I always double this recipe and cook for an hour and I still run out.

Great recipe and super easy!  Even I couldn't mess this one up.  My kids loved it and they are not great vegetable eaters.  If it was just me eating it I would have used a spicier corn bread mix, but the kids like the regular.

Followed the recipe exactly as written, but something must have went wrong because it tasted terrible.  Threw it away instead of serving to my guests.  This is the only thing I have cooked in the last 7 years that my husband would not eat.

Absolutely fabulous recipe.  It makes a great side dish served with a Mexican entree like tacos or enchiladas.  A little hot sauce on top and you are set.

This side dish is quite different from anything I am used to.  It almost looks like it is too wet and mushy when you cut into it, but it tastes wonderful!  The sour cream adds a very creamy taste to the cornbread, and the corn adds a nice texture.  This is a great side dish to add to any meat (try it with the Aussie Chicken on this site!)

Every time I have made this, I am happily amazed by how easy it is, and yet how tasty. My kids love it, and I think the sour cream gives just the right balance to the sweet corn.

I made this for my mom's birthday and everyone raved - even my kids!  It was easy to make and really good.  I was a little skeptical on how the cornbread was going to rise, but it did.  I had to keep it in the oven a little longer than 45 minutes - but worth it!  I will definately make again and again!

This is a really good dish, and it's fairly easy to make. My only suggestion is to make in a long, flat casserole dish, as it will cook more evenly!

I, too, made this for the first time for Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it. I added a couple of ingredients. I was looking for a sweeter corn dish, so i added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 cup heavy cream. I didnt want the casserole to be too dry, which is the reason i added the extra liquid. It was a big hit. I heard the family commenting on the corn dish while everyone ate.

I am new to this website and usually do not try new recipes for the first time.. especially for Christmas dinner..What a huge hit this was.. I felt confident that it would be good since rated so high. I doubled the recipe and cooked exactly as said.. and the texture of this dish is yummy... My elderly mom who hates corn loved this recipe...My son who loves to cook will have this at his next supper club... This was served with lamb and could be used with chicken or beef. Bread really is not needed with this dish.. Do try this recipe...

This was AWESOME!! My mother in law needed a corn recipe to take to my mom's house for Christmas Eve Dinner so she called me and I found this for her to make. It was really, really good. She had everything on hand already and she said it was super easy to make. I will be making this for my family!!

I tried three NEW recipes from this site for a small dinner party last night and got kudos for them all.  The best was looking at the faces around the table when folks first put their forks in this corn casserole.  All I heard was "mmmms" all around.  This was unbelievably easy and tasty.  I reminded me of spoon bread.  I loved it.  The guests loved it.  This is going to be a staple around here.

This recipe doesn't need another 5 star review, but I had to put in my two cents. This is comfort food at it's finest. I have made this recipe many times on cold snowy nights and everyone loves it. I tried cutting the fat by using low fat sour cream and powdered eggs, but it just isn't the same. If you are going to make this great corn casserole cut your calories in a different dish and enjoy this one to the fullest. This is a keeper at our house.  Thanks!

Our family loves this recipe and have it at all of our family dinners. One exception to our recipe. We use only one stick of butter. Do not mix the butter into the recipe. Melt the butter in your baking pan. Mix the rest of the ingredients. Spread the mixture in the baking pan. The butter will come up along the sides. Spread it across the top and bake. This makes the edges nice and crunchy. Everyone fights over the end pieces.

This is a great recipe!  No changes needed!  I made this for thanksgiving and ended up giving the recipe to 4 people. A few people told me it was their favorite part of the dinner (and we had 13 different dishes to choose from!)

I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving.  I usually try all of the recipes at least once before serving it to guests, but by the name of this recipe, I decided it SHOULD be very good and I didn't need to try it first.  It was GREAT!!!  I did, though, add a tablespoon of sugar for a little sweetness, and it was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was definitly a favorite at our Thanksgiving table.  I will be making it again and again.  But I have to admit I added 1 Cup grated Cheddar cheese (half reserved to be melted on top) and about a quarter cup chopped Roasted Green Chilies.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and it turned out very well. I had tired similar recipes before and they had more of a cornbread texture.  This had the creaminess that I was looking for.  I did adjust the time for 1 hour.

So easy to put together and it tastes pretty good.  Next time I will take other reviewers suggestions by adding onions and maybe some chopped green chiles.

Great recipe.  It was enjoyed by the whole family.  I put it together the night before and cooked it the next day.  It took about 10 minutes longer in oven, but was delicious.

I have been making this for at least 10 years .  It never fails to please.  Try Mexican Cornbread mix to kick it up a notch. I also use Dean's French Onion dip instead of the sour cream. Any brand will work.

My elderly parents loved, loved, loved it, just as it is.  Dad gives it 7 stars!  We all liked it better the next day, after it set up.  For my taste I would like to punch up the flavor by adding come diced green chili peppers or or minced garlic or whatever flavor compliments the meal.  Will definitely make again and play with variations.

This recipe was just ok.  The texture was good, but the taste was very bland.  I think it would have been better if it had been a little sweeter.  If I ever make this again, I will add some salt and some sugar.

Very yummy!  I brought this to a pot luck and it was a hit.  Someone else brought one with onions and much of it was left.  My casserole dish was clean (even with a doubled recipe).  I used corn muffin mix.  Also, I found that it is MUCH better served at room temperature, not hot.

Took this to a potluck today. It went over very nice. It sort of reminded me of these corn pudding that you get at El Torittos. I will be making this over and over.

Wow! It's difficult to believe that such an easy recipe can be soooo good.  This recipe is great because it leaves room for substitutes - although I didn't use any this time.  I made it with a spicy main dish and it complemented it very well.  It had just the right amount of sweetness.  In the future I might add some additional ingredients that the other reviewers mentioned, especially if I am making a more subtle-flavored main dish.

Very good.  Kids loved it.  I personally would have liked a bit more spice/flavor...maybe chopped onions or green peppers?  I used splenda and fat free sour cream for a healthier dish.

I made this recipe for the third time today and realized that I needed to give credit where credit is due.  I really like it because it is very, very easy to make.  It makes an excellent side dish.  I also made it once in place of corn bread muffins.  You obviously don't eat it like a muffin, but it has a similar taste and sometimes my cornbread turns out dry; but, this is a no brainer and has turned out perfect and the same each time.  I gave this five stars because it is easy and it is good; I really can't complain.  I don't know if I would describe it as awesome, because I can't help but wonder if something added might make it better.  I think that extra something might be bacon or green chilis or red pepper.  I just haven't got around to experimenting. This recipe reminds me of a good comfort food.  I think some extra ingredients could very well make it AWESOME!

WOW...This is DELICIOUS!  Was very impressed...soo easy...and oh so good!

I didn't have a can of whole corn so I used a bag of frozen corn...turned out great!  Was worried because I thought using frozen would add too much moisture...but not a problem.

Thanks soo much...now a family favorite!

This was easy to prepare and came out of the oven looking great.  I love dishes that look and taste good.  I give it 4 1/2 stars mostly for ease of preperation and appearance and 4 stars for taste.

Absolutely awesome!! Made this for a family gathering and everyone raved over it. It's very similar to ChiChi's corn dish, just simpler. Couldn't believe something so easy was so good. I added about 1/2 tsp salt, and it came out fab!! DEFINITELY a keeper.

my family loved it, it's the first time we ever had corn in "corn bread" and i think i might leave out the extra can of corn and just used cream corn so not so crunchy. but still was great

I was disappointed after reading all of the reviews.  It was just okay.  Not really that creamy - seemed almost identacal to plain corn bread, just with corn added.  It didn't taste bad, but I was just expecting more.

I thought this was great. My husband loves jiffy corn muffins, so i used that. It was a little sweet and that was good. The kids didnt care for it-- but what do they know? I will be making this again Thanksgiving.

I followed the recipe, but before mixing everything together I added half of a chopped red bell pepper, four chopped green onions and one chopped, seeded Jalapeno.  The sweetness of the red bell pepper offset the heat from the jalapeno (also because it was seeded and the white membrain removed it wasn't that .hot).  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I liked this, but I've only made it once-- guess it was slightly forgettable. I added lean ground beef to the mix to make it more interesting, and ate it as a main dish.

I made a double recipe (based on the reviews) to take to a recent party.  Although it was all eaten up, I did not hear any great raves or compliments.  Personally I was disappointed I thought it was bland.  Instead of tasting like a souffle or pudding, I thought it tasted like corn bread muffins with bits of corn included.  Not a memorable dish!!

We loved this recipe. My 6 year old daughter even liked it (she's pretty picky). I used Jiffy cornbread mix, which is sweet anyway, and it was sweet enough without being too sweet. I'll make it again and will share it with friends. Thanks Ruthie.

Because there are only two of us, I cut the recipe in half using 10 oz of frozen corn and 4 oz of creamed corn.  It took 60 minutes to bake, but turned out fantastic.  I'll definitely make this again.

This dish is easy to make but did not turn out as a casserole. It's more like a pudding and is excellent for muffins. I used half the batter for a pudding and the other half for muffins. I thought the taste was bland (although the sour cream taste came through well): it was neither sweet nor savoury but some friends liked it that way. I will make this again if only because it is so easy to make but perhaps a little more cream or even milk next time to give it that casserole texture.

Absolutely amazing! I made this for Christmas dinner with my husband's family.  It was a HUGE hit. They took home the leftovers and asked for the recipe.  My Mom used to make a corn casserole that I have the recipe for and have sometimes made, but this one is waaaaaay better!  Highly recommended.  Didn't/wouldn't change a thing!

This has been a hit for Christmas and Thanksgiving a couple years in a row now. It is simple and cooks up really well. If you want to spice it up with cheese or sweeten it as suggested in other reviews it stands up to it perfectly! I would even suggest that you let the younger family members 'help out' at holiday time by making this recipe. It is that easy.

I made this for Thanksgiving and forgot to put any eggs in it. It was still fantastic and I was asked to make it again for Christmas dinner. My husband (who loathes anything with the word "casserole" in it) enjoyed this tremendously. I hear it freezes well but who has any left over?

This was excellent.  I made it for Thanksgiving and got a lot of compliments.  As another reviewer mentioned, I could not find the 8.5 ounce-size of muffin mix.  I bought the 6.5 ounce size of Betty Crocker Corn muffin and bread mix.  I doubled this recipe and used 3 packages of the 6.5 ounce muffin mix.  I also added 1/4 cup of sugar to the doubled recipe.  It turned out great.  However, next time I double this, I may try to add just two of the 6.5 ounce size muffin mixes because I'd like to see if it would be a bit runnier, since the title makes it seem like it's a creamy casserole.  Mine turned out more like the other reviewers said, like a very moist cornbread.  It was delicious nevertheless!!  FIVE STARS!!!

I read the other reviews and changed the recipe a little, I only used 6.5oz of cornbread mix and 1.5 cans of creamed corn.  It was still more like a cornbread, but the taste was very good.

I made this last year for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!!  Has anyone baked this in advance? It doesn't travel well uncooked, so I thought of preparing it the morning of, and baking it half through.  Any thoughts?

This is a great holiday sidedish, my family just loved it.  Especially my picky 21 year old son, who only eat broccoli, and corn on the cob.  He thought it was great.  It is so easy to fix.

I always get requests for the recipe when I make this. I usually cut down on the fat by substituting out canola oil for most of the butter and using low-fat sour cream.

To me it just tasted like cornbread with cream of corn. 
  So I probably won't fix this again!!

This is always the most requested recipe everytime I make it.  I plan on sending copies to everyone!  If you can't find the right size corn bread mix, use the Jiffy brand.  DELICIOUS!!

i highly recommend this recipe! i'm a vegitarian and made for my parents, who like comfort food, and we all LOVED it! i used a pie pan instead and it still worked perfectly. i also added about 1/4 cup chopped green onions, used fiesta corn, and added about 1/4 cup shredded mexican cheese. baked it for about 50 minutes, then sprinkled some cheese on the top and cooked about 8 minutes longer. YUMMY! inside was creamy, outside was crispy. definite five stars!

I get raves whenever I serve this.  Creamy and satisfying.  Great with ham.  And easy to make.  Had this at a dinner party with a green salad, bbq shrimp on skewers, and key lime pie for dessert.  It was a smash.

Ever bought the "home mix" of that great corn cake you get at the local Mexican restaurant, and, when eating it, thought, "Yuck, this doesn't taste anything like what I'm getting at the restaurant?"

Well, this corn casserole does taste like what you get at the restaurant.  Yum!  I made it with the Double Crust Bean Pie (from this site), and everyone loved the meal!

The only change I made was to bake it in a 2.5 quart Corningware casserole, since I only had 8x8 and 9x13 bakeware.  I added ten minutes onto the baking time, and it came out perfectly!

My husband and I enjoyed this breaded corn concoction at a local mexican restaurant for years and were dissapointed when they changed chefs and apparently the recipe.  I have been looking for this sweet corn treat to make at home.  Was delighted with how it turned out and am tempted to eat the entire thing myself.  I have served it with tacos and even as dessert.  I garnish mine with a colored tortilla chip for extra flair. Enjoy!

Did everything exactly as written and it turned out great.  It was more like a corn bread than a pudding texture, which was fine.  We really liked this one and will keep it in the rotation!

This tasted and looked just like regular cornbread.  Was is suppose to be soupy or runny?  Cause mine wasn't- it was just another cornbread recipe.

This is yummy!  I did as one review suggested and used a little less butter, but it seemed a bit dry, so will go with the full 1/2 cup.  I also added 1/4 cup shredded co-jack.  My husband said, "No cheese!"  My daughter said, "Yes, cheese!"  I will make it again.  Thanks, Ruthie!

Very good and great, easy side dish.  We all love this recipe.  Takes little to no work to prep then bake.  I have played around with this recipe since first trying it.  It is easy to add your own special twist to this one.

This stuff is fantastic!  Quick, easy, and painless, it tastes like a creamy delicious cornbread.  Make sure to let it bake to a golden color, that's the best part, the toasted crusty outside with the creamy center...makes my mouth water just thinking about it!

I followed the recipe exactly and it did not turn out right. I had to cook it for well over an hour and it was still a little mushy in the middle. And it's way too greasy with the butter. If I ever tried to make this again, I would probably use fat free half & half, and cut back the sour cream to 1/2c so it sets better. It tastes ok, though.

It was good but not great.  I'm having left-overs today with some black bean/salsa soup.  I think it would be good with some spices or jalapenos added. Not bad, though.  I'd make it again if I was having chili or a spicy stew.

My family was so tired of having meatloaf with our standard (boring) mashed potatoes so I tried this instead of the potatoes and it was a hit! The sweetness of it was a great compliment to the meatloaf and this is SOOOO simple to make!

A nice change of pace from plain old corn.  My cans of corn were both 15 1/4 oz, and I had to use an 8x8 dish.  Because of this it had to stay in the oven a bit longer, but it was delicious when done.  My 3 year old (whose favorite food is candy) and husband (who is a picky eater) both asked for seconds.  It was a perfect compliment to our 'sweet hot and spicy' meatballs.  I'll definately make this again.

So quick, easy and YUMMY! We love it and it's so great just to whip up with any entree. It's very easy to scale down too, I usually make 1/2 the recipe since it's just my husband and I.

I tried this recipe along with another one for the first time at Christmas Dinner.  This one and the other were huge hits.  I can't believe how easy this recipe was and how delicious it turned out.  If anyone enjoys the Corn "gooey" at El Torito's restaurant, then you should try this.  This is what it reminded us of.  Thanks

This was outstanding: the best corn casserole I've ever had.  Really tasty with the corn bread, great texture and nice presentation. I added a little salt and pepper before cooking but it would have been just as great as-is.  This one's a keeper!

MOUTH WATERING DELICIOUS!  I'm not a corn person but this was fantastic!  I made it prior to thanksgiving to give it a trial run & ate myself silly.  Figured I'd hold off & make it for Christmas.
Husband didn't like it when it was 1st made but left in the fridge overnight seemed to enrich the flavor & it was even better.  I had to fight my teens for a spoonful.  
I did omit the whole kernel corn & doubled on the creme corn.  Awesome!  Now printed & put into my recipe box.  Hurry up Christmas dinner!!!!  
HALL OF FAME RECIPE!!!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and the whole family loved it! It was very easy to make, and still good with lite sour cream, and vegetable spread instead of butter.

After reading the other reviews I was expecting something better.  It wasn't bad but it tasted like it was missing something.  I made it over thanksgiving and the rest of my family thought the same thing.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  Served it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I used Marie Callendar's corn bread mix for a slight sweeter taste.  No need for any additional  liquids.  This comes out moist but not soggy!  So delicious.  Can't wait to make it again.

Hubby went to the grocery store and purchased too much can corn, so I was looking for a different way to fix it. This recipe turned out better than I thought. It was easy to make and tasted great. I used a square 8x8 glass baking dish, so I cooked it for about 55min. instead of 45min. I will definetly make this one again.

This was really good.  After looking at previous reviews, I didn't thoroughly drain the corn and I added 1-2 tablespoons of honey.  My 2 year old LOVED this.  It's a keeper!

This is so AWESOME!  I halved the sour cream and added condensed milk for sweetness.  I made it twice in one week.  I'll never make regular corn muffins again!!!  Bravo!  
EDIT - My mom loves this too.  She makes it with broccoli instead of the corn and all her sisters require her to bring "broccoli bread" to every family event.

Great recipe... not for the calorie conscious, however.  I cut back a bit on the sour cream and added some shredded smoky cheddar!  Thanks for sharing!  Outstanding!

I expected this to be something you would spoon out of a casserole dish, but it was more like cutting a piece of cake.  Very tasty!

This was a simple and delicious Thanksgiving recipe. I have made it many times...try adding honey (2 Tbs.) or using a honey cornbread mix..YUM. I also made it  more savoury by adding monterey pepper jack cheese and chopped chilis. Thank you for this excellent recipe.

I doubled this recipe and I added a little bit of sugar (about 1/4 cup) and used fat-free sour cream.  It was superb and looked very impressive, kinda like a souffle.

I've made this recipe several times and everyone ALWAYS raves about it.  My brother sat down with the pan after the last family get together and finished it!  I have even made it without the butter, using fat free sour cream and egg substitute and it still tastes exactly the same.  It's just a wonderful recipe that everyone seems to love!  You won't be disappointed.

I made this as a dinner side dish the other night for my family. My husband and myself liked it very much but the kids (all 5 of them) didn't care for it at all. I will make this again, only when the kids are gone!

Excellent!  I doubled this for a lunch for some people from church and everyone loved it.  A keeper.
The only caveats I would say are: look closely at the labels of the products you buy.  In the store where I purchased the corn bread mix, only ONE was 8.5 oz.; almost all the rest were 6 or 6.5 oz.  Likewise, not all the cans of corn were exactly the size stated in the recipe.  If you must use products that have different measurements, be sure to adjust the recipe accordingly.

This has become one of my most requested family recipes, and I plan to make it again this Memorial Day-Such a wonderful sidedish to go with any grilled meat or seafood-When other dishes are taking up the cook's time this is so quick, easy and delicious and is always the first thing to go.  Be sure to double it or you won't have enough!

I thought it was really good. I liked it because it was a little sweet.  I chose a cornbread mix that had the most sugar in it but you could lesson the sweetness just by doing the opposite.

Great side dish! When I make this to serve with chili or other Mexican dishes, I substitute one can of "Mexicorn" (with red and green peppers in it) for the can of whole kernel corn. It adds some zing, and for a Christmas meal it has great festive color!

This is the best corn casserole.  It's just like my husband's grandmother used to make at family get togethers.  It is very easy to make.  I'll have to double the recipe next time.  It was gone before I knew it.

I have been looking for a corn casserole recipe similar to one that I tasted in Memphis, TN, and I think I found it with this one!  Talk about comfort food, this fits the bill.  I'm definitely going to add this recipe to my Thanksgiving menu!

We loved this corn casserole!  It is so forgiving if you don't have exactly what it calls for.  I probably change it every time I make it.  It is such a great basic recipe.  I have added different chesses, onion, green chilies, red or green bell peppers, yogurt instead of sour cream etc.  It is always good.  I've noticed  that some people add sugar.  I think that is a regional thing.  I live in South Texas and I had never had sweet cornbread until my friend from Illinois made cornbread that was sweet.  It was more like a dessert.  So to each his own.  Thanks for a yummy favorite.

REALLY easy to prepare (took 7 minutes) but needs a bit more salt and maybe another taste which I am going to work on.  I used a circular 8 inch dish which required 10 more minutes in the oven.  The texture is great and the corn comes through very well.  Just a bit more seasoning.

Mistakenly added  two cans of creamed corn instead of one of each (regular & creamed), but it turned out very well and was nice and moist with a cakey texture.

I give it 5 stars made with my adjustments. I have had creamy corn casseroles before & they are all sweet.  I don't like sweet vegetables (like can creamed corn).  I used the niblets as the recipe calls for.  Instead of can cream corn, I found a chub of frozen Southern buttered fried corn (iron skillet fried corn).  Never had it before & didn't know how it would taste but if it is iron skillet Southern fried corn, I know it's now sweet.  I used it instead of the can cream corn and it turned out delicious. Omitting any amount of sugar.

This is a staple at our house. Everyone who tries it loves it! It’s not complicated but oh so good. Sometimes I add a can of green chiles and shredded cheese too.

Followed recipe as is. Used Jiffy cornbread mix. Brought this to large family gathering. HUGE hit! Many went back for seconds of this dish specially. This is a recipe I will be using often.

My husband and I made this for the first time tonight, and we both liked it. The one thing we probably would have done is bake it a little longer. We plan on making this again for his side of the family's Christmas celebration on Christmas Eve!

I made this (exactly as the recipe directs) for 2019 New Year's Day at my brother's house. It was SO delicious (no leftovers)! In fact, it was so good, when I got back home, I made another just for me and enjoyed it in my work lunch and dinner every day for a week! We had it with Thanksgiving this week and I was asked several times for the recipe. Tasty!!

Light, fluffy and delicious. So good. I doubled the recipe and put it in a buttered 9x13 pan. I never use margarine as some recipes call for and for sure recommend using butter as this one lists. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Delicious and definitely a keeper. I have to say that I wasn't serving it right away and it did collapse a bit. So I would recommend cooking and serving right away.

Oh my gosh! I LOVE this recipe. I added a seeded jalapeño pepper (cuz I needed to use it  before it went bad) and a little sharp cheddar cheese in the recipe and on top after it baked. I didn’t have any sour cream so I used plain Greek yogurt.  Still turned out amazing! Thank you for the recipe!! Everyone loved it!!!

This recipe is very easy and tasty! I do think that calling it a casserole is a bit deceiving, though. It’s essentially a (yummy) cornbread. I made the batter the night before and then greased the dish and baked the next day. It still turned out well.

I'm so sorry I made this recipe for Thanksgiving!   I followed the directions perfectly but I didn't know you used Jiffy  Cornbread Mix, because it has SUGAR in it.  I used Bob Mill's cornbread mix and it came out just like cornbread only worse.  There was no sweetness to it and it wasn't creamy.  It tasted bland - I can not serve this to guests tonight.  It tasted just terrible!!!

Absolutely Delicious. I have to make this for my family(especially my daughter) Every Thanksgiving.   We add a little bit of extra sweetener for our family b/c we like it extra sweet.  Just a personal taste although most probably are fine without it.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving. The first year I made it as written. It reminds me of what my mother used to make when I was growing up. The only real difference was that she cooked a package of Hormel Little Sizzlers pork sausage and cut it up and added it to the casserole, and so do I now.  So good!

I made this for a work potluck and it ended up being super good, I wouldn’t call it a casserole though, it’s basically corn bread with a lot of corn hehehe. I doubled the recipe and put it into a 9x13 pan HOWEVER, if you follow the recipe, it ends up being a littttttttllle but too much so I ended up removing some from the pan so it wouldn’t overflow. I also added 1.5 TBS of sugar and a couple pinches of salt to taste. because I doubled it I ended up having to bake it for about 80 minutes at 350 degrees. The casserole is super moist so I kept thinking it wasn’t done but it was. I recommend adding the sugar and salt for a sweet and savory flavor.

I first made this last Christmas and liked it so much, made it for Easter!  Since then, we've had it a few more times and it turns out terrific!  Its slightly sweet, yet has a good texture and I was surprised it went so quickly.  This one's a keeper!

I have been making this every year for thanksgiving and Christmas for several years.   When I originally obtained the recipe from a friend, she forgot to list the egg, so for years my mother and I didn't use them.  I actually prefer it without egg now as it makes a slightly more dense/less cakey version.  Using one egg is a nice compromise.

I followed this recipe with the exception of using light sour cream and adding shredded cheddar to the top.  I also followed the tip of another reviewer that said to melt the butter in the pan and just pour the mixture on top.  I was a bit worried about it coming out bland without salt or seasoning but it was not at all!  It was very good.  It is not as dense as Paula dean's recipe due to the eggs.  Next time I might cut down on the amount of butter.

I love to change it up by adding green chiles, poblano peppers or even imitation crab meat!

This is very good. My only change...I add cayenne pepper (1 tsp) to balance out sweetness of the corn and sugar in the cornbread. For a family of four you should half the recipe. It makes a lot for a dish that is not a main dish.

Super easy to make, moist and spongy. Very delicious. I've made this recipe several times already. I always serve it with slow cooker chicken and dumplings. It's always a hit.

I made this and added 1 small can of green chilies and a cup of grated hatch green chili cheese to the mix. I used an 8x8 pan so I had to cook it about 15-20 minutes longer. But, the result was absolutely delicious! I'd make it again!

I have been making this for 20 years and it is always a big hit; and someone inevitably asks for the recipe.  My only changes are that I use two cans of creamed corn instead of just one; and I add 1/4 c. of sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly as it is and for the next time I make this I would probably add a bit of sugar. I like a sweeter corn casserole and this one was good but not much on the sweet side as my husband and I would have liked. Otherwise, it was good.

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make!  I followed the suggestion of one of the other reviewers who said to melt the butter in the pan before pouring the batter into the pan. It was wonderfully delicious, buttery and brown ( just like me!) ! I thought there might be leftovers but boy was I wrong!

I'm really confused by those who said this has no flavor!  Maybe if you hate cornbread in all its forms (and if you don't like corn, why would you even make this?). It's like a moister, dense, sweet cornbread.   I used Jiffy cornbread mix so that may be part of it, or maybe the naysayers had bad canned corn or something.  I made the recipe exactly as written, not adding a thing.  It was a big hit at the dinner party and exactly what I expected.

I doubled the recipe.  But split it into an 8×8 & 9×13 pans. Less amount in 8×8. Cooked for the time suggested. Turned out perfect for both pans. Took one for our family dinner and kept the smaller pan at home for the next day.

Came out great.  Followed the recipe as written.  However I used leftover corn from a crawfish boil in addition to the cans of corn, so it was probably little spicier and saltier than the recipe normally would have been. Still thought it tasted good.  I’d make it again.

I’ve gotta tell you.  My women’s group LOVES this dish.  We typically prepare it for our weekly book club alongside some of the most delicious culinary delights you can imagine.  Last week we had some grilled pork chops with a jalapeño/apple chutney and a cous cous medley to die for - this casserole was a perfect complement.  The BEST part of all you ask?  The ladies and I always send pictures of our morning-after “doodies” and lets just say they call me “Helen The Corn Queen” for a reason.  5 stars -3 joy!

Very good!  Nice and moist!  The only changes I made were substituting the sour cream for high-fat plain yogurt and adding enough buttermilk to make 1 cup (because of lactose intolerance), and I also added a Tbsp of sugar to add a little sweetness.  I will make it again and mostly likely will add it to my Thanksgiving or Christmas menu.

Been making this recipe for years with Jiffy corn muffin mix. (And actually have seen it as a recipe on the box) Have made it both with basically the other ingredients listed here and by using the MEXI-CORN. We personally prefer the MEXI-CORN version just because it adds that little ZIP...but...have added some green chillies when I couldn't find the MEXI-CORN. This is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS A MAJOR HIT and ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS end up with an empty pan!!!! (And never fails to shock me when some say they have NEVER, EVER had this!!!) SOOO...LOL..just blows my mind when someone posts things like "...not one person even tried it, and ended up throwing the whole thing out." REALLY??? LOL...NOBODY EVEN "TRIED" IT, and you're just gonna THROW THE WHOLE THING OUT BECAUSE OF THAT??? REALLY??? (SMH) IDK. I understand that many people have different tastes. BUT...for there to be almost 2700 comments to this recipe and practically 95% of them find this INCREDIBLE...can only imagine that those 5% that thought something like this was just BLAND, YUCK and EWWWW have to be either MAJOR GOURMET RESTAURANT FANS or SOOO INCREDIBLY PICKY THAT I WOULD DREAD THE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO FEED YOU. All I can say is...I'm a 60 yr old Momma, Grandma that has lived both in the South and Midwest and everybody thinks I'm a genious in the kitchen. LOL..NO GENIOUS here!!!! Just an old lady that enjoys spending time in the kitchen, experimenting with my seasonings, ingredients, and creativity!!!

Recently made this for a holiday party. It was a hit! I had people who hated cornbread going back for seconds. Everybody agreed it was the 2nd best thing next to the Tri Tip that was cooked. I think that’s pretty good. Anyways I used reduced fat sour cream instead. As for the cornbread mix, I used Fleischmann’s Simply Homemade Mix. It was very easy to reheat as I cooked it the night prior. Will continue to make this yearly! Also wanna try it with hatch chili’s next time.

I made this to go along with our Ham Christmas Dinner.  I followed the recipe except I cut down on the sour cream and added 1 TBSP of sugar.  It was a hit!   The texture and taste was amazingly good.

I made this for my in-laws Christmas dinner this year. I followed the recipe exact and added a bit of the green onion. My brother in-law said he normally doesn’t like cram corn/casserole, but he asked for the recipe. I will make again!

Made this last night with grilled ribeye steaks. This recipe is perfect. I added 2-3 minced jalapeno peppers that did not interfere with the sweetness factor of the corn.  It just complimented it.  We loved this recipe.  I'm sure I'll make this again and again. Thinking about Christmas Day......

This was a perfect accompaniment to my Thanksgiving dinner!  And so easy to make!  I think I will make this recipe every time I want cornbread as a side dish.  It was so moist and delicious.  Only change I made was used frozen corn instead of canned due to personal preference.

A very popular side dish with our family, both kids and adults.
I usually have to add about 10 minutes to the cooking time due to our 4500 ft. altitude here in Utah.

(4.5 Stars )

This was well received at Thanksgiving dinner as a side dish. I doubled the recipe for my guests and cooked for 55 minutes. I will do this dish again because it was tasty and easy to cook. Prepare a few hours before serving and let it set to firm and then keep warm. 

Suggestions (when you double recipe): Use 1/4 less of butter,  2 tablespoons of sugar, green onion,  2 cups  sharp cheddar or fresh parm cheese, and 1 red pepper (for coloring). 

Next time: Will add jalapenos for a kick and sausage

Edit: For the third time, I made for one serving. Used all the butter this time but added more cornbread mixing. Also instead of jalapenos, I included cooked spicy sausage. Family really liked it an said it reminded them more of a stuffing.

I made this for Thanksgiving and made the following substitutions to make it vegan:  2 egg substitutes, coconut milk yogurt instead of sour cream, and vegan butter.  IT WAS EXCELLENT!  The family wants it included in the Christmas menu!

Very easy and tasted great.  I really loved this casserole.  It was easy and turned out perfectly.  I used sweet cornbread mix, and I think that made it a tiny bit sweet which was great.  A classic.

Very easy, slightly sweet (as I like it), makes enough for a gathering.  I fried a little this morning to have with my eggs -- tasty!

Made it with gluten free corn bread mix but no one noticed the difference. It was an absolute hit at a family Thanksgiving meal for 20.

I made this for the first time for a new Thanksgiving dinner side dish.  My adult daughter loves all thinks corn related so I thought this would be perfect.  I was right!  It was a huge hit and I should have made a double batch!  I did add a 1/4 cup of sugar which sweetened it just the right amount.  Great recipe, it will be a Thanksgiving and Christmas tradition in our family from here on out.

Wow. What a tasty corn dish. I made it exactly as per recipe for Thanksgiving yesterday 2018 and everyone ate it all up and asked if there was anymore when I pkgd up leftovers for my peeps to take home. I def think it’s the parmigiana cheese that takes it over the top. So simple to make too.

Added in just a little bit of salt and 1 jalapeño. Took much longer than the said 45 minutes, more around 1 hour, 20 minutes

I made this with 1egg and half the butter.  Had so much batter that I baked half as is and added chopped onion to the rest... Both taste great. Works well with Thanksgiving turkey. Will certainly be making this again.

One of my family's favorite dishes that I make, it's always requested during the holidays. I've been making it for several years now. I use Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix, it gives it that sweet taste. Super easy to prepare!

I have been making this recipe for so long at Thanksgiving I can not remember a time when it was not on the table. I always keep the basic recipe but change it up a little by adding different spices, fresh herbs, green onions, chiles, red peppers, depending on what I have on hand or feel like adding. It is very versatile...for those who thought it was too bland...make it your own and to your taste! Great recipe that has stood the test of time.

I am going to bring this to Thanksgiving along with a salad. I didn’t have creamed corn so I used the Cream Corn Like No Other recipe. I was tempted to add green chiles but kept everything as is just in case. Thank you for the recipe!

Been using this type of recipe for years and thought I would shake things up this thanksgiving and try a this one. I only used 1/2 cup of sour cream,  giving it a thicker consistency.  Always a favorite of everyone at the table!

Followed the recipe exactly and just can't figure out what everyone is raving about. It really didn't have much flavor, unfortunately. Consistency was nice, and I liked that it caramelized around the edges. It sorely needs some salt, and something else (anything else?) for flavor! Thinking about adding some sharp, flavor packed, cheese. Suggestions anyone??

I followed the recipe exactly.  Delicious!!!  My husband, who is a corn lover, loved it.  My teenage son, who is not fond of corn, loved it.  I, can take corn, or leave it. I loved it!  So much so, I am going to make it again, and take it along to Thanksgiving!  Excellent, and easy!  Thank you!

This is a fantastic recipe! It goes very well with Thanksgiving dinner and all poultry meals, but equally well with roast beef.  I would rather eat this than birthday cake or dessert!!!

I have made this dish for every Thanksgiving the last 5 or so years, for multiple get togethers with family and friends, and occasionally just because. It really is easy to make, and it's beyond delicious! Every time I take it as a dish to pass, it gets devoured and is requested for future events. It's definitely a favorite!

This is a tried and true recipe. Delicious and comforting.  If you want to take it to the next level. Add a drained 4oz can of MILD chopped green chillies.

The ingredient list of the "Spoon Bread Casserole" recipe by Jiffy calls for using the small size cans of corn (8.75 oz. whole kernel, 8.25 oz. cream style), not the larger cans (14-15 oz.). (The latter leave the casserole too wet, I find.) The Jiffy recipe also calls for an oven temperature of 375°, not 350°. Importantly, aim for the surface of the casserole to be quite golden brown. It shouldn't still be as blond as when it first goes into the oven.

Made it exactly as written. Very bland as other reviews stated.  The plus is it's extremely easy.  If I make it again would add green onions, maybe some green chilies, canned or fresh, and a tiny bit of salt. Or any seasoning you like since this is pretty much a blank slate.  Many suggested adding sugar.  ??  Personally would not.

I used to make this years ago, (slightly different though). When I stumbled upon it I was happy. As written this is a good recipe. In my version that I got one year from a radio personality in LA  it had cheese on top and I put the melted butter directly in the pan and poured the batter on top of it. Yummy, a big hit!
Thanks Letsgggo

This was delicious and easy to make.  I thought it was a little bit too sweet and not sure how to reduce that, as it must come from the creamed corn.  Would be a great side dish for large groups.

Wanted to like it, but for my taste, it didn't have enough real taste!  It needed something else - maybe spicy ingredient, like ortega chiles, or jalapeños, or both?  Doubled recipe for six people, threw out over half of it.  A shame, but will search for different varieties of this casserole, as it sounds promising.  Try it, you may love it, perhaps I just expected too much flavor?

I didn't add as much corn because it didn't call for a whole can. I just used 1 cup of corn and 1 cup of creamed corn. Still turned out great!

Someone I know made corn pudding but couldn't/wouldn't give me the recipe. So I went online several years ago and found this recipe. It was the first recipe I made from Allrecipes  and I loved it.  Now it's one of my Thanksgiving must haves.

This has become a family fav! We like to spice it up and add a can of chopped green chilies and a cup of colby “longhorn” cheese. Fresh corn off the cob makes it ev n better!

My family destroyed this! I used Krusteaz honey cornbread mix and substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream. Other than that, I followed the recipe . It was very moist so if you don't like that I recommend baking for another 5 or 10 min depending on your taste (I didn't).  It could be because of my substitution...

Great side dish.  Everyone enjoys this dish.  Had the oven set to a temperature of 300 as I was baking another dish.   Turned out well with a longer baking time watching as the recipe states to a golden top.

The best corn casserole recipe ever.  Only use 1/2 STICK of butter, not 1/2 cup.  DRAIN  whole kernel corn.  I reserved a little of the corn liquid in case mixture was too dry.  This freezes well.  Freeze any leftovers and reheat at 375 for 30 minutes for double deliciousness.

I've made this for about 3 years now. I make as a side dish to dinner or as a dish to take to family dinners. I make it exactly as the directions say but I also add a handful of whatever shredded cheese I have on hand. I sprinkle a little on top as well. I LOVE it. I've had a few people ask me for the recipe and there's usually nothing left to take home. It tastes like ChiChi's corn pudding that they would give as a side, but more firm. I'll be making this for years to come.

Wonderful!!!!!!! I added a box and a half of corn bread mix and a tbs brown sugar. I may have added too much butter, but it came out perfect! Loved it and my entire family loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly (with Jiffy corn muffin mix), but used a rectangular glass pan (inside dimensions 7.5"x12") and baked it about 15 minutes longer because we like a bit of crust. Both my husband and I loved it! It's just a little bit sweet, and we couldn't stop nibbling at it after dinner!

Delicious!!  I cooked it for 55 minutes & it came out lightly browned on top but very moist inside. Next time, I’m going to try adding a finely chopped jalapeño for a little color.

I do not rate recipes if I alter them in any way because it is not fair to the submitter or reviewers.  If you make a change... it is no longer the same recipe!  This recipe is genuinely a 5 star recipe!  Everyone in my family loves it and it is the favorite dish at potlucks.  I love it as a side dish.  My sister has her own version of this recipe which adds 3Tb sugar (she serves it as dessert).   You cant go wrong either way.  This is a crowd pleaser!

Absolutely loved this recipe. It was quick and easy, and gently ushered me into the world of casserole-making. I'm new to the south and had no idea literally anything could be made into a casserole, so long as you had the rice and/or bread for it. I did use the general guidelines for this recipe, but I tweaked a few of the ingredients. I used sweet corn and creamed corn, and Mexican crema en lieu of sour cream. I also added 2 tbsp of sugar, just to sweeten it a touch. I baked it in a casserole pan for 35 minutes under 350, and it came out wonderfully.  I'll absolutely be making this again in the near future, and it'll become a holiday staple for sure.

Excellent. Nice corny flavor. Next time, I will try it with less and light  sour cream. I made this AS-IS and am rating it as such. I make a Mexican spoonbread that is similar in ease, but I think this recipe is even easier. Thank you LETSGGGO!!!

I made it a little healthier (no butter, a little almond milk, and plain greek yogurt for the sour cream) but if I had made it according to the directions, it would get 5 stars.  I used this version because it is almost identical to my grandma's recipe and it was always my favorite side at Thanksgiving. Hers is better than my healthy version of course.......Two years later and my 9 yr old still loves my health version.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't have a 9x9 pan so I used a larger one, and thank goodness I did! It came all the way up to the edge of my round dish as it cooked, if I'd used a smaller pan I'm afraid it would've cooked over and made a mess.

The only thing I do is double it and use  a 13 x 9 pan. By doubling I can use a whole corn bread mix. I prefer the sweeter versions of mixes. I dumpmthe corn water on the whole corn. Everyone loves this!

It's good but needs a little more flavor.  Maybe some black pepper would be good in it.

Recipe is great. I mix all the liquids together first then add to the dry. Just makes it set up better.  The family talks about this dish every year at Thanksgiving. It is definitely a favorite!

This recipe is perfect as is.  It truly is.  If you don't want to experiment and mess up a good thing, don't.  You'll end up with an amazing dish.  I personally use frozen corn instead of canned for a little more sweetness and crunch, add just a TBSP of white sugar, and sometimes melt some shredded cheddar on top, depending on whether we're in the mood for that or not, but it's certainly not necessary.  We also always double the recipe and cook in a 9x13 for maybe 10 minutes longer (do check though cause ovens vary) and it always turns out wonderful.  This is always my go to standard for corn pudding/casserole!  Thank you for the perfect recipe!  I'm making it for a potluck tomorrow in fact and I know I'll be bringing home an empty dish!

Have been making this recipe for years now. But down here in New Orleans we like our food with a little kick so I add a tablespoon of liquid Crab Boil to spice it up. The sweetness of the corn followed by the heat of the crab boil! Sure fire hit.

This dish goes great with a ham. Something about the saltiness of the ham and the sweetness of the corn just go so well together. It is one of my favorite side dishes to make for a potluck as well. Simple, easy and inexpensive but very yummy.

I liked it when I put pepper jack cheese and cut up canned peppers in it in small bits. Otherwise, it lacked sweetness. But overall, it was a good recipe to start with.

Oh my word, I've been looking for this recipe for YEARS! My ex-mother-in-law  (kids' G'ma) made it for Thanksgiving dinners and I wanted to give the recipe to my sons before I go Home, but I couldn't remember if it was sour cream or cream cheese. Lol I'm sorry, I know that's a lot of personal information, but thanks for sharing this, and it's a YUMMY corn casserole.

My dear aunt gave me a recipe for corn pudding years ago  just like this one except for the sour cream. I have made it every Thanksgiving since. Oh my, the sour cream takes it over the top! I will be making this recipe on a regular basis. It is my 'go to' recipe for potlucks and funeral luncheons.

Very good ..... I think next time I would just add 1 1/2 sticks of melted  butter.   Cooked it longer til it comes slightly away from the pan.   Added  1/4 onions I had in fridge.  Didn't precook cause they were minced.   Hubby bought large box of corn mix so it was great for church.   Great to add any leftovers.  Will make my "Janat's spicy baked beans" from this site next time to go with it.

My daughter made this as a side dish for dinner last night. We all loved it! 

I asked her how she made it and went in search of the recipe, and here it is! I'll be making this soon!

I made it almost exact to the recipe, except I didn't have creamed corn readily available. In a pinch, a can of regular old corn and a couple Tbs of sugar work just fine. came out really good! I'm definitely making this again.

Have been making this since the '70's ... my grandmother gave me the recipe, our whole extended family still  loves this ... the only thing I do different is I use Frozen Super Sweet corn ... I just don't usually buy canned corn.

I made this for the first time for Easter dinner 2017. Due to health constraints, I am not allowed corn in any form. So, I put the dish to a vote after our meal, and everyone said on our family scale of "Yuck" to "Make It Again!", this dish rated a make it again in ALL CAPS!! 
  Even though I couldn't have any of it, I found it to be a super easy recipe that took hardly any time to prepare. Especially nice when you have a lot going on during a holiday meal preparation. This would also make an awesome potluck dish!

Made this exactly as the directions were written and boy is it ever good! So simple and so tasty. Next time I might play with it a little because that's just the kind of cook I am. But 1st time make the recipe as written! I served this with baked honey glazed ham and potatoe salad. Family loved it. Thanks  this will go into rotation for sure.

Turned out great!  Add half cup sugar, strain whole corn and bake for an hour. I used foil in a metal pan with pam spray.

I have been making this for years.  Always tasty as written.  Creamy, sweet and corny.  I always use Jiffy corn bread mix and bake in a  9 x 13 inch pyrex dish.  I sometimes add minced jalapeños for another layer of flavor.

This was flipping Awesome! I had to read the instructions like 4 times over to make sure I wasn't reading it wrong... LOL because it was just so easy.  I've been looking for a corn casserole recipe for a while and so Thankful for this one!  Will be making this many, many times. I made it as is and topped it with chopped green onions- super Delicious! Served it with Thyme& rosemary pork tenderloin & mashed potatoes with pork gravy. Thank you for sharing LetsGGGO!

I doubled the ingredients but still only used one can of corn and one can of creamed corn to make a 9x13 pan. It was delicious! This is a new family favorite and pairs well with white chicken chili.

I was looking for a new side dish for Christmas dinner.  This was a hit.  I tried it per another reviewer's modification and put in only 3 tblsp butter and one egg as well as a little onion.  I couldn't find quite as big of a bag of cornbread mix so the less egg and butter worked well.  Will make again.

Was not impressed with the texture, too wet. Tasted good and most of  my dinner guests seemed to enjoy it. Guess I'm a "hold in your hand" cornbread  kind of person.

Excellent.  I see no need for sour cream. It adds nothing. If you use milk there will be noticeable difference.

I love this stuff. It's a great side dish with a hint of sweetness or add some sugar for a healthier dessert. I make this with every meal I get the chance to. 

Perfect for a potluck. Cheap and easy to make

This is way better than cornbread and way better than plain old corn.  I made this for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. It's great on its own or right in the middle of your plate of mashed potatoes, stuffing and gravy!

I followed the recipe exactly as given. At 45 minutes, the crust didn't look brown enough. So I left it in for a few minutes longer as some others have suggested. I took it out of the oven at 50 minutes. It was tasty, with no raw or undercooked flavors. But it was definitely a bit too moist anyway. I will make it again but perhaps add some chopped onions for flavor, and bake it for an hour rather than 50 minutes. 

Of course it's called a "casserole" rather than a bread, so perhaps it's meant to be wet rather than more bread-like? Any ideas?

I doubled the recipe on everything except the butter.  Like others, I used the jiffy's corn muffin mix which adds a bit of sweetness which I liked.  After reading other reviews, I baked it for an hour instead of the 45 minutes as instructed.  It turned out a bit firmer than I expected but my husband actually preferred it this way.  Overall, it was easy, flavorful and I'd make it again.

I doubled the recipe.  It was awesome. Everyone loved it. One word of advice...would be to not fill the casserole dish to the top. It boiled over the top of the dish.  It was still delicious!

So easy to make and so well received every time. For me, absolutely no need to tinker with the recipe ... but everyone has their way and the alternatives are seemingly endless.  I doubled for Thanksgiving without making any  additions or subtractions,  using a 9 x 13 casserole dish and baking at 350 for an hour and 25 minutes. There was still some butter bubbling around the corners, so I lowered the oven to 200°  And let it sit for about another seven minutes or so, and ended up with beautifully browned edges.    The really nice thing about this recipe is that it's tasty at just about any temperature, so I didn't have to ask for oven space at my friends Thanksgiving dinner.    I kept the lid on the casserole, covered it with a kitchen towel, and it was still warm by the time we all sat down to eat.

I made this once for a gather for my husbands entire family. What an unbelievable hit!!! This dish is so yummy my 9 year old couldn’t get enough of it and he doesn’t like much of anything, so picky. I also loved it and the added bonus is that is so easy to make. Thank you so very much for posting this recipe.  
This is a must make, you can not go wrong. :)

Now a standard request for all large family gatherings. I follow recipe exactly with the addition of a drained 4 ounce can of green chiles. 
First time I added green chiles I made 2 pans, one with and one without in case folks thought it a bit too spicy.
Pan with green chiles was completely gone before the pan without had even 2 pieces gone.

I have been making this recipe for over 15 years and I have adjusted the ingredients a little. I use sour cream with onion and bacon dip instead of sour cream and I add tsp crushed red pepper for little kick.

It would have been better if I  had remembered the sour cream...  Since I  like onions in everything, I  would add 1/2 diced onion and 2 TBSP  Parmesan cheese.

Really good base recipe. Added chopped green onions and extra sharp cheddar with (real) bacon bits. My family loved it!         
I'll try smoked ham next time with Swiss cheese. Yum! Great casserole as a main dish with a mixed green salad.

A hit with the whole family, and every guest I have ever made it for.  I used another reviewer's advice and melted the butter in the dish as the oven preheated, and now I make all my corn bread that way.  it makes such a delicious difference.  Thanks!

My favorite part of Thanksgiving family feasts and fall dinners. I make the recipe as above, however my mother always uses half the butter and it turns out just as good. Everyone always loves it and we never have any leftovers. For fall dinners I make, I usually couple this with the Parmesan Ranch Baked Chicken I have saved as a favorite (although I've changed it from the base recipe on this site) and homemade mashed potatoes and gravy. A high calorie dinner for sure, but it's always a winner!

I cooked this Awesome and Easy Corn Casserole.  The casserole is a nice presentation and I think it is delicious.  Adding one more tablespoon of whole kernel corn to the can required will satisfy me because the consistency will be of a little more corn for a person that loves corn.

I've made it a couple of times, everyone loves  it!  One friend I served it to has made it several times herself.  I realized that this is the recipe of an item I have frequently purchased from the deli, now I can make it any time I want.

Excellent dish! This is good if you cook it for a shorter amount (meaning the recommended amount of time) of time or if you cook it longer (until firm) and it becomes a bit more bread-like. Thin or thick - same story. I usually cook until firm. Everyone loves this dish!

Made this for our family dinner tonight and everyone loved it!  The crisp top was a hit.   Followed directions exactly for a double batch. Baked for 45 minutes and it was perfect. Will definitely  make again.

Awesomest awesome corn casserole! I freaking love this recipe....so easy to throw together, I now always keep the ingredients on hand. The only change I make is to use GF cornbread mix which works perfectly. (I've used Krusty's as well as Bob's Red Mill.)

This exact recipe has been in my family for close to 30 years. I remember my band director's wife made it for a campground potluck we attended and it was delicious! She gave us the recipe and it brings back such fond memories every time I make it. It's a wonderful side dish for Mexican dishes, Thanksgiving, or anytime really! I recommend using Jiffy corn muffin mix because it's a little sweeter than other brands. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I've been making this for years and I do it the same way, except that my recipe calls for a cup and a half of shredded cheddar cheese that you put on top in the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking time. I also use a 9×13 pan for this recipe. I've also added some crispy bacon... wonderful!

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but it was more of cornbread with corn in it than it was corn casserole.  It would be good with chili or taco soup, but not so good as a side dish.

Family loved it.  I used 3 Tbsp butter and 1 egg then cooked for 1 hour.  It sets a little as it cools.  Jiffy cornbread mix adds plenty of sweetness. Good kids dish.  If want more flavors add chopped onion or green chilis and bacon grease rather than butter.

I followed this recipe exactly and thought it was delicious. It is super easy as well. I do wonder if the recipe could do with a bit less butter, though? I'm going to try it with less next time and see how it turns out.

Simple and delicious. 
I changed one thing, instead of 1 can of regular corn, I used 2 cans of creamed corn. Oh, and 1/2 cup of whole milk. :)

This was very delicious.  I didn't have creamed corn so I added more fresh cooked corn, a couple teaspoons of sugar, and a couple tablespoons of milk.  Mmmm.....so good.

It was kind of hard to tell when mine was done as it didn't ever really get golden brown but I did the fork test & gave it a few extra minutes. It came out just fine. Very tasty & very filling!

I used the chipotle cornbread mix, added an extra egg, green onions and cheese.  I also substituted fresh corn for the canned, but still used a can of creamed corn.  Baked it in a cast iron skillet.  it is ridiculously delicious.  I've made it twice in two weeks.  Perfect as a side for bbq.

My husband loves cornbread casserole and could eat it every week if he could.  This is a great standard recipe that comes out great every time.  The only thing I do is add about 1/8 cup sugar to sweeten it up.  Also this is never done in 45 min.  It takes at least an hour in the oven and I normally have to turn the oven up to 375 the last few minutes.  Great recipe!

So delicious!  I made it as instructed and wouldn't change a thing with the ingredients.  Only issue was it did take much longer to cook.  I used a 11x7 pan and had to add another 15-20 min onto the cooking time before the edges were golden and the center cooked through.

Overall really good but definitely too much butter. Butter was the most prominent flavor instead of corn. Will make again but with less butter.  I also only used one egg since some recipes called for two and others didn't use eggs at all.

Not sure what happened but mine turned out like fluffy cornbread. I was even able to cut and serve and it kept its shape. ?? I made exactly as is so hopefully that was intentional

I have been looking for a recipe like the corn casserole they serve at El Torito Restaurants for years and I have finally succeeded!!!  I added 1/3 cup of sugar to sweeten it and it was perfect!

Very good!  We enjoyed this very much, will definately make again.  The only thing I would change is I thought it was a little bland, I would add a little salt.  Otherwise a success.

This was delicious.  I ate way too much of it!  But I have to say, it was only really good once I salted my own servings.  It is a little bland otherwise.  I recommend that you not use a smaller baking dish than recommended.  We only have 8" square pans, so I used a 9" round Corning Ware dish.  But the interior area is only 8" across, and that made the casserole take much longer to cook - more like 70 minutes for the center to be done.  Next time I'd use a much bigger dish so that it cooks faster.

This looked really good and while collecting the ingredients, I could also envision a one dish meal. So I added ham bits and baby broccoli. Substituted cottage cheese for the sour cream. Yum! Update, this has morphed into a one dish casserole that we really love. Additionally, I have added a fresh tomato and 1/2 to 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese. I use Mrs. Dash Onion or Garlic seasoning about 2 or so tsps. I use Greek Yogurt or cottage cheese instead of sour cream. In other words this is a great base recipe that welcomes additions!

Just love this....wish it didn't make so much...it's just me and the hubby...but it is just as good reheated!  I do find that it takes a little longer to bake than suggested....I've been baking it an extra 9-10 min.

Followed the recipe exactly. Everyone seemed to really like it. No complaints and I will probably make it again. I would love to add some scallions or jalapenos but my family doesn't like.

I have had several different corn casserole recipes...this is by far my favorite!  I used light sour cream and it was wonderful...can only imagine the richness of using regular sour cream.  Adding this to my favorite recipe collection.  Thanks!!

It's Easter morning, I had to try this. I did double the recipe yet only used 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup)
It's very good but as is, I would say it's a one note dish.  It could use some seasonings and like others said here, addition of onions or peppers or maybe the bacon would give it a savory twist. I didn't find it too sweet and I used sweet white corn.
It's easy to make, worth a try.
My stand by recipe here is the Old Fashioned Scalloped Corn. I truly love that recipe and add my own seasonings.

This is a family favorite. I did not have the corn muffin mix so I substituted 1/2 cup each corn meal and flour, 1 tbsp. each baking powder and sugar and 1 tsp. salt for the muffin  mix. Ithe turned out great!

This recipe isn't bad but is a bit bland.  I made it again and added 1/8 c honey, sweet kernel corn and used unsalted butter.  Tasted much better this way.

Meh. The texture wasn't as good as my regular recipe, and it was more work. Try Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole instead. Easier and better, and you don't need masa harina.

For crispy corn casserole cakes!!! 

- Omitted melted butter and eggs (too heavy) 

- Used softened butter to grease muffin tin. 

- Filled muffin tin 1/2 or 3/4 (up to you) 

- Baked at 350 for 45 minutes 

- Let cool for 10 minutes. 

- Sometimes, I add red pepper flakes or jalapeños.

I also make this in 8x8 and 9x11 pans. Always 70 minutes without melted butter or eggs. Prefer crispier edges.

My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe!  Very moist and flavorful as-is but I can certainly see myself adding cheese and diced chilies for a little kick or a bit of honey or maple syrup for a slightly sweeter  bread.  Absolutely delicious!

Took it to a potluck and it was a major hit.  I made a double batch and used 5 eggs total.  It was really nice and moist.

good! Super easy. Have been making a more complicated sweet and eggy version of corn pudding for thanksgiving and decided to give this one a try. Definitely more on the cornbread side but it was  delicious... The family was split some like the sweet corn pudding the rest liked this better. It will be tough to decide between the two dishes next year. This dish would travel well for a potluck.

Quick and easy to prepare and delicious, too!  I was concerned that it may be a bit bland, so I added a pinch of ancho chile powder and a little salt and it came out great.

Delicious. I made two batches and put each in an 8x11 glass baking dish. Doing this provided my group of 16 with plenty of food. Including choices of the good solid edges or the moist creamy centers.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it is now my new dish I take to holiday gatherings... assigned by my husband! I was worried because the middle didn't look done after 45 minutes so I kept it in the oven for about 5 minutes longer...it still didn't look done but it was perfect...nice and moist and so good. love the recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe!! I am asked to make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas and always get compliments on how good it tastes. One year I completely forgot to add the sour cream and it was still delicious! The recipe is good just as is but I do like to add a little bit of sugar to taste. Maybe 1 to 2 tablespoons.

Best I have ever made/had. I altered it as IRISHMAIDEN suggested, 3 TBS butter, 1 egg and some chopped onion. This will be a family favorite.

I bake the mixed batter in a cast iron skillet and serve it in the skillet fresh out of the oven as a side dish. Delicious enough for company.  Friends of ours call it "spoon bread".

Huge hit at dinner last night, even my picky 7 year old ate it!  I did; however, replace the butter with coconut oil and mixed in a swirl of honey, and I am definitely making this again.  In fact, everyone wants me to bring it to the work potluck next week!

This was a great accompaniment to Zataran's Jambalaya!  I cut back on the butter by two tablespoons, and seasoned with garlic and onion powder, Adobo, and red pepper flakes as we enjoy spicy food, and added 15 minutes to the baking time.  Wonderful!!!

My parents and I loved this so much that we included it in our Thanksgiving dinner this year, taking the place of my moms Corn Soufflé that has been an addition to our Thanksgiving & Christmas dinners for generations.  
The second time I made it (for Thanksgiving) I added orange, red, and yellow peppers, which topped more greatness on this already great dish.  
Also, the only thing I do extra with or without peppers, is drizzle a little bit of  honey on top before it goes in the oven! Mmmm-mmm!

I made this more than a dozen times so far. It's one of my family favorite side dishes. I used to make as is, except by using  a smaller package of corn bread mix. The brand I usually buy is little less than 7 ounces. But that shouldn't affect the recipe. 
Now a day I try to make it low fat , by using low fat sour cream, half butter and half olive oil. And even with these changes , this corn casserole / pudding  is still delicious.

I made this exactly as it is for Thanksgiving dinner. As a side dish, it was cloyingly sweet, entirely too sweet with all the savory flavors of the turkey, stuffing, etc. I like creamed corn, but in this dish it was too much sweetness.
Nobody in the family liked it.

This was delicious. As I was adding the corn, it seemed like it would be too much to add all that was in the recipe. If you don't want to feel there's too many kernels, just add less of the canned, not creamed, corn.

OK.  Had this at Thanksgiving per the standard recipe and loved it but thought to mix it up a little.  I read all the comments on this recipe from people who had added things, so decided to jazz it up tonight.  This was a double recipe tonight.  I used herbs, seasonings and aromatics this time (garlic, green onion, salt/pepper, parsley, chives, thyme) and integrated with food processor into half the butter, then melted it on the stove before adding to the recipe.  Also added chopped green parts of green onions for color and flavor.  

I also added 3 tbl of honey, used a Krusteaz Cornbread mix (15 oz), and melted the other half of the butter in the bottom of the baking pan and did not incorporate it into the batter.  Used 8 oz sour cream and 8 oz cream cheese instead of double sour cream.  Fresh corn vs. canned sweet corn (8 ears), and then two cans of creamed corn.  I left the melted butter in the bottom of the pan, and then mixed the other ingredients together and poured on top of it.  I baked it 1 hour 25 minutes (the double recipe needed it, along with the added thickness).  Had to put the baking pan on top of a sheet pan in the oven as it threatened to overflow, lol.

OMG was it good!!!!  Half the recipe went between FOUR people!  It was nuts. My husband kept eating it and couldn't believe it was based on the same one we had the other night.  I will do this again and again!

Amazing! Made for both family Thanksgivings and it was a huge hit at both. I find the cook time was about 55 minutes for me because I used an 8x8 pan. I like to add one small can of chopped green chiles (medium heat). It makes the casserole taste somewhat  like Redstone Restaurants corn bread.  So tasty and SO easy!

After reading reviews, I added half the water from the can of corn to further moisten the mixture. It took about 1 hour to bake and resulted in a moist, not overly sweet corn pudding casserole. I made this for Thanksgiving earlier in the day then just warmed it before the meal. The leftover casserole the next day tasted even better, and was tasty at room temperature too.

Cannot make enough of this at Thanksgiving.  Make exactly as written.  Change nothing.  Family (extended) ask for it every year.  Many family members now make it for their family gatherings.  A classic!  Again, do not change a thing,  DO NOT MAKE THIS HEALTHY OR CALORIE FRIENDLY PLEASE

If I could give this more star's I would.  Almost nobody in my family likes creamer corn but me and my husband.  I made this and it was sooooo amazing.  Everyone tried it and some even went back for seconds.  Most of it was gone by the time our Thanksgiving dinner was over. I will definitely make it again. We had 8 of us and this dish made plenty for everyone to have seconds if they all wanted to. Thank you so much for this and other simple and amazing meal/recipe ideas.

This is delicious! Always a winner, no matter who I serve it to. 
Only minor changes I make - mix in about a half cup of shredded cheddar cheese and add a sprinkle sugar over top of casserole before baking. It just gives a little something extra.

I love this recipe! I've been making for the past several years. And I also add Shredded cheese and bacon bits to the mix and top it with a special ingredient(crushed ritz crackers). Every time it's a favorite! And also instead of jiffy cornbread mix I use Krusteaz Honey cornbread mix. Gives it a sweet but delisous taste

My husband is the pickiest eater on the planet but he has recently decided he likes corn.  I have been experimenting with recipes to hit on something he will really like.  This wasn't it. While it is easy to make and is good, I used Jiffy brand corn bread mix and that brand is rather (really) sweet.  Personally, a corn bread mix without the sweetness would have made this better.

Just like everyone said. I made this side dish and EVERYONE wanted the recipe.  I added chopped green onion, salt, pepper and garlic.  I am going to try it with broccoli and crumbled bacon as well.  Thanks for the great staple that I can do variations on!

The first time I made it my husband said it was too bland. So I added a little can of green chilies and two tablespoons of parmesan cheese (the real stuff, not from the shaker can). I also cut the butter by half. I got a lot of compliments at our friendsgiving gathering! I will definitely make it again.

I added Mrs Dash Fiesta Lime Seasoning. Gives it a Tex-Mex flavor and a bright note from the lime. 1 Teaspoon is all you need. A big hit with family !
I also made this in a spring form pan so I could have a corn cake that was easier to cut into wedges for everyone.

I used to make a corn soufflé on Thanksgiving day but started making this recipe instead because it's so easy and delicious.  I double the recipe and bake  it directly in the crock of my small crockpot in the oven.  When it's done I place it inside the heating element part of the crockpot on low until it's time to serve.  This saves oven space.  The only change I make is to use sweet frozen corn (thawed out )in place of the can of regular corn.  I still used the can of creamed corn.

Versatile! I didn't have room in the oven so I made it on top of the stove  with a few changes. 6 T butter , 2/3 C sour cream and 3 eggs. I used a heat range of just above medium and cooked it for 40 min. The only thing I will change next time (Everyone wants it  again for our Christmas brunch!) is that I will use a double boiler because it got a bit too brown on the bottom...though my brother said that added to the flavor.

I followed someone's suggestion to use 1/2 the liquid from the corn can.  This seemed too much and it was a little soggy.  Next time I won't use as much.

I made this last two years.  First for the family and then last year for the office pot luck - put it in a crockpot and was the hit of the party.  Coming back to make it again this year, adding some green onions this year to see if it can get any better, but it was just fine without.

I have been using an almost identical recipe for years and this is a crowd favorite.  I only use 3 TBSP of butter, not a whole stick!  And I only drain 3/4 of the liquid from the can of corn which helps keep not moist.  Delish.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan which worked just fine. Low fat sour cream works well. I added about 9 green onions (which I fried first to ensure they'd be well cooked).  Fine as a side dish.

Loved this so much. I halved the recipe and it ended up filling two 6 inch ramekins. I added a bit of mild canned chiles, green onions and cheddar cheese. Along with a sprinkling of green onions on the top before baking.  I know this would be great without my additions but this made it just a tad more savory. I can't wait to make it and eat it again!

I made this a few days ago. It was super-easy and tasty although a bit too sweet for my taste (that was because of the corn-muffin mix, I'm sure).  I used a 9x13 foil pan because I didn't have a straight 9-inch one and that worked out fine. I did find it needed a little longer time in the oven to reach the "golden-brown" stage.  I would definitely make it again because its easy and speedy preparation makes it an ideal side dish for a holiday meal.

Nothing exceptional but it's certainly an easy and tasty side dish. Made this exactly as written and it was a hit with my family. They even requested it for Thanksgiving.

I doubled this and baked it for a bit longer in a 9x13. I wasn't crazy about it, but my husband thought it was good.

I love this recipe!  Ive been making it for about 20 years!  But I stir in some slices of Swiss cheese, and then lay some slices of cheese on the top and bake.  Its so good!  This recipe is always requested for special meals, like birthdays, Thanksgiving, Easter, etc.

Heaven on earth! Or should I say heaven in a casserole. Made for a large crowd and it was one of the first dishes to go.  I don't really need another excuse to make this again. I could eat this all by itself.

Delicious as written!! I made this for Christmas dinner and just now again on New Year's Eve! I used a cornbread mix that wasn't very sweet,  but it would be good with something sweeter like Jiffy. My husband suggested it would be good with honey drizzled on top.. I think you could add green chilies and cheese.. even sausage! This recipe has lots of potential and is very versatile depending on your taste at that time. It is definitely good as written too though! Oh I found I needed to cook it longer..

Delicious! I sauteed some green pepper and onion in a little bit of the butter, reduced butter to 1 stick, mixed all ingredients in the casserole dish and it turned out great! Baking time was definitely an hour. Had many comments that I need to make it again soon :)

Made as written except added 1 TBS. of sugar and doubled the recipe. I prefer corn pudding made with flour, as I thought the "cornbread" made this too dense and cake like. This was not creamy. This would be good at a BBQ and as a dish for a large gathering. 7 adults only ate 1/4 of a 13x9 pan. Baking time was 1 hr.

I doubled  the recipe and everyone loved it. I put in about 2\3 the amount of butter called for. I also put in 1\3 cup chopped onion and about 1\3 cup chopped bottles, roasted red peppers. Delicious. I cooked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

This is incredible!  I make it exactly as listed and it's so good that I would actually prefer to eat more servings of this and skip dessert. 

Some variations that might be interesting (I haven't tried yet):  roasted corn kernels; add onion; add jalapeño and cheddar cheese; add bacon and cheddar cheese.

A hit every time!  My son and daughter love it and ask for it every holiday.  My only advice is to allow lots of time to cook, always seems to take longer than expected to bake to a golden brown.

Wow this is soooooo good.  Great corn flavor.  Made as recipe directs.  I could see adding green onion or cooked crumbled bacon after it cooks.  Big hit!

Love this recipe.  I followed the recipe except I added two additional two tablespoons butter to the pan and melted this in the oven before adding the mix.  Used Corn Bread Muffin Mix instead of the cornbread and after 50 minutes of cooking, added 1 cup Colby/jack cheese to the top for about five minutes.  It turned out great.  I plan on fixing this recipe again at my annual 'New Year's Day brunch.'

Delish.  Can cook for an hour, but was definitely more like cornbread then.  Try cooking for time on recipe to get "bread pudding" texture.

This was so good.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it was certainly gobbled up.  The best comment was that it was a great alternative to cornbread which is usually dry and crumbles when buttered.
  I picked it as an alternative to cornbread stuffing which I don't like.  Will try it with jalapeños next.

I followed the recipe but my oven needed 10-15 more minutes. I put mine in a glass pie container, maybe thats why? It was still a bit wetter than I liked but everyone else loved it. BUT I make a regular cornbread, leave out the liquid and replace with a can of creamed corn and tastes the same but less wet.

We love this for breakfast!   Make it exactly as written (no extra sugar, onions, peppers, cheese) and keep it in the oven until the top and bottom (use a glass baking dish) are golden brown.   Then while it sits on top of the stove, we fix sausages or bacon and serve squares of the baked corn with maple syrup!   It's absolutely fabulous and is now everybody's first choice - even more than waffles and pancakes!

This was very yummy.  My husband liked it, but expected cornbread from looking at it when it is more of a corn pudding.  I think it tasted even better the day after, which makes it a great make ahead item.  I tried it as is this first time, but I had to cook it for about 10 minutes longer than stated.  In the future, I will try adding diced green chiles and maybe even some shredded chicken.  I will even try for a low fat version in the future.

I made this one evening when I was trying to just make something healthy for the kiddos to snack on for that day and also accompany a late brunch I had planned. I served it with a quiche and some garden salad. The kids asked me to please make it again.  I have SOOO much canned corn both creamed and whole kernel and I have bags and bags of corn bread mix from a friend who closed down her store and didn't see a big use for them. So for me not only is this delicious but so economical as well.  
The flavor of the dish was exceptional. I found it to be more like a souffle and had a very light, non overpowering on flavor. Almost French cruller ish.  I'm making a double batch in about 10 minutes. :)

This was excellent!   Everyone raved about it.  I could not find cornbread mix in Canada so I just used the recipient for cornbread on the back of the cornmeal bag and left out the wet ingredients.  It worked great.   Needed to cook for 1.25 hours @ 350

This is a bread not a casserole. I thought it would come out as a creamy corn side dish; but it was more like a corn-bread. I have added it to my bread receipes. I took suggestion of others and used 1 egg, 3 TBSP melted butter and 1/4 cup chopped onion. I baked it in a round casserole but would recommend a square dish so it can be cut as a bread in squares.

I left out 1 egg and added some chopped onion saute'd in the butter before adding the other ingredients.  It came out more like cornbread than I was expecting.  I was thinking more "side dish" - this was closer to bread.  I brought it to my cousins for Easter yesterday.  My opinion is that it was okay but the entire dish went and she had a ton of food.  Some really, really liked it - or I would probably give it 2 stars instead. I baked it in a 9x13 glass dish - maybe I should have used a deeper casserole?  Don't know but this is not what I consider great.  Sorry.  I rate them as fairly as I possibly can.

Followed the recipe except used Mexican Corn Bread Mix. This gave it a little color and the perfect taste. It baked for about 60 minutes. My wife couldn't quit eating it. It really is 'awesome'.

I have made this for the past 8 years for holidays and love it.  I will say I have never added sour cream before.  This is awesome without it.  I would imagine it might be good with it but I don't need the extra calories.  I tastes really good without it.  I will say that I have added finely chopped green bell pepper in the past but I usually use regular onion.  I also think this would taste really good with a little bacon crumbled into it!  I'm going to try that next!

We loved this! Very easy side dish and really good! We served this with smoked pulled pork and Bbq beans.  The leftovers reheated very well and had it with chili the next day! This is a keeper!!

The kernel corn really added a nice crunch compared to normal creamed corn. There was none left by the end of the meal. I also added a half can of the liquid from the corn. Perfect!

I made this for the first time for Christmas to go with a spiral ham. I used only cream corn and used half cup French Onion Dip and half cup sour cream. I always salt and pepper when I cook. Well, it was the hit of the day!

Super easy, and super good. I've made this on several occasions and prep couldn't be easier. I've even been asked for the recipe more than once. I've added a 4 oz can of diced green chilies or a chopped jalapeno a couple times and it really added to the flavor.

I made this for the first time for a large potluck gathering.  I doubled the recipe (9x13 pan) and it was completely gone.  I had several people ask for the recipe.  I will definitely use this recipe again for large gatherings. I would add though that I had to add quite a bit of time (15-20 min) to the cooking time with the larger (doubled) batch.

I'm glad to see the recipe I've used before. I couldn't remember where I put the recipe I had so thought I would check "allrecipes". I love this site. This is the exact one that I make, but I put plenty of cheese on top. The reason I like this recipe so much is that when you need a simple and so easy side, this is always a winner. Making this tomorrow for Christmas. :)

I'm not big on corn but my daughter loves it so I tried it on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it even me.  I am making it tonight for Christmas Eve.  I do agree that a little sugar and a little less butter makes it taste even better.  It does need to cook for about an hour.  This is a fantastic recipe.

I've been making this recipe for years!  Love it!  I don't use box cornbread though.  I just make my regular cornbread and all the other stuff to it.  I also add a pound of sliced & browned smoked sausage to make it a complete meal in a dish.  YUM!

I had a recipe from my mother for this dish but lost it. This one was spot on with my memories .  We always use Jiffy Mix cornbread which is a little sweeter than other brands.

Great, thank you! Mine was more fluffy than creamy, which I did like, but it does resemble corn bread with extra corn as some reviewers said. Here's the changes I made with suggestions by other reviewers:
- 1 egg, beaten
- 3 Tablespoons of butter, melted
- no sour cream
- 1 Tablespoon of sugar
- 1 Cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese 
- Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Let stand 20-30 minutes at room temperature.

I was a little hesitant about writing a review because I used polenta instead of corn bread mix (Couldn't find that in my local supermarket in Montreal... )... Well, my mom liked it but she doesn't like anything too spicy or too seasoned... My husband and I thought it was too bland. Luckily, it was made as a side dish for chili so I mixed it in my chili. Maybe with salt, onions, hot peppers... It has potential but it needs some tweaking. I gave it three stars because my mom liked it so I guess it's ok for some people.

This is a very simple and quick dish. I combined the ingredients ahead of time and refrigerated until I was ready to bake. I added a can of green chiles for some spice, but it was still a bit bland. I think that next time I will add some jalapenos in addition to the chiles since we like things with a kick.

I made this exactly as described in the recipe and it was quite tasty.  However, I should have used a hand mixer to get it really fluffy.  Instead, I just mixed it all together with a wooden spoon.  The flavors are great, though.

Total hit for Thanksgiving. Easy to make, easy to clean up! A perfect base recipe to tweak to make even extra special. I added a quarter minced onion and topped with some chopped chives to make a lil more savory. It was such a crowd pleaser. I ended making two casseroles one on Thanksgiving and one days later.

This one drew rave reviews at Thanksgiving and I had a couple people ask for the recipe. Prepped the night before and tossed in the oven before serving. The middle didn't cook up well with the allotted time and temp, but I gave it an extra 10 with broil at 350 and that firmed it up. Thank you for this. Loved it and will make it again, and again, and again...

Family loved it!!! So easy and comes out very moist and tasty! So much better than plain corn bread. I used Marie Calender's corn bread mix which probably made it a little sweeter...but still delicious.

I have made this a couple of times, most recently for Thanksgiving.  It is always a big hit!  I used Jiffy corn muffin mix, 1/2 the liquid from the whole kernel corn, and 1 T. sugar.  Also since I didn't have sour cream, I used Dannon's vanilla yogurt instead.  Turned out great!

It was okay. I made it for thanksgiving as a side dish. My family ate it all. I made it just as the recipe said. I couldn't find Marie Calendars corn bread mix but I think maybe it would have been better.. ?

Simple and delicious.  I didn't alter anything, and I loved it.  I wanted a simple corn casserole, and this was it.

Even the pickiest eaters at Thanksgiving said this was one of the best things they've ever eaten.  I made it exactly as is.  I doubled the recipe and it took about an hour and 30 minutes to bake at 350, but we kept opening the oven door.

Awesome!  Go into to it knowing this: if you are expecting or wanting a creamier texture, make sure you don't use the 8.5 oz corn bread package....us the 6.5 oz.  I read the other reviews prior and left out about 2 ounces of my 8.5 oz box when making this....perfect!!  Still had the corn bread-ish texture but still creamy enough.  I would have been bummed if it came out like corn bread.  Other than that, followed the recipe to the ingredient.

I am always determined to try new recipes at Holidays because i hate serving the same thing year-after-year.  This one was FANTASTIC.  It is simple and easy to throw together as is written.  Just to add some Cajun flare to it next time, I will probably add chopped onion, bell peppers, jalapeno peppers and maybe sprinkle some cheese.  But it is great without it.

I don't know why but I always end up changing recipes, but this had a great start base. I had a huge bag of left-over corn from a low-country boil in the freezer. (Earmarked for winter corn chowders, etc.) I add chopped fresh jalapenos, sauteed along with chopped garlic, sweet onions, sweet red pepper in 1/2 stick butter. Mix it all in bowl with one egg, a little milk, 1/2 cup (or less) 0% fat-FAGE Greek Yogurt, lots of pepper,1/2 box Jiffy cornmuffin mix (love that stuff! Prob cause it's SWEET!) some chopped fresh cilantro, and 1 1/2 cup of sharp cheeses...mix it all in a 9X13 glass buttered dish, add more cheeses on top (lightly)Bake an hour or so 350...and VOILA! BIG HIT! Making it again today by request. BTW...it  freezes well, even if it has previously frozen corn.  I always save uneaten cooked corn from cookouts...makes the best chowders, casseroles, etc. Has that wonderful Low Country boil flavor.
This is just as good with any corn, canned, frozen, etc. YUMMILY!

Loved this casserole, it is sooo easy and fast. I have my kids make it and put on the menu for thanksgiving every year. the family raves and eats every last bit. I have added things and it is good with or without the additions. I like cheese, bacon, onion and jalapeno add ins which helps give it a kick.

I've been making this recipe for 7 years for Thanksgiving and its always a hit and always requested. The only thing I do differently is the last 10 minutes of cooking I put a cup of cheddar cheese on top and stick it back in the oven to melt. It makes a great cheesy top and a moist creamy center. Two thumps up in our household.

Make it by request every Thanksgiving. I bake it so it is done just before we leave for the 30 min drive to the family gathering and when we arrive just pop it in a warm oven until dinner time.

This was an excellent side dish to bbq ribs - very yummy.  I followed the recipe this first time around, although next time I may try cutting the butter in half or a third, cause it did taste very buttery.  But if you're not worried about fat content, it was REALLY good!

This was really good and so easy to make.  I used vegan sour cream and egg replacer to accommodate food allergies in my house, so I don't know how it would have turned out if I made it as written.  I also cut the butter in half.  My husband and kids thought it was weird but everyone else at dinner liked it.  It definitely needed more than 45 mins to cook.

As everyone said - a hit with the crowd - hard to top. Next time will try low fat sour cream per other suggestions, and maybe reduce the butter.  Took about an hour to cook and was not as firm as I'd like.

I've been making this recipe for the past 7 years at Thanksgiving and Easter and it continues to get rave reviews from the family.  However, I always have to bake it longer than it's called for because I don't like for it to be soupy.

Just made this for a church pot-luck supper.  Not a bite of it was left.  Definitely a keeper. Only thing I changed was to double the recipe. It's nice to have a dish that I can brag on a little.  This will reappear at family reunions and maybe Thanksgiving. If you love corn, this recipe is for you.

I am engaged to a midwestern guy who is obsessed w/ casseroles, so I have been relying on All Recipes for some new recipes. (I tend to cook spicy food.) He LOVED this casserole and immediately said I should rate it 5/5 stars! My only change---next time I would leave the casserole in the oven 5-10 extra minutes. Yummy!!!!

This was very easy to make, but lacked a little flavor. I had to add salt and pepper to it. I didn't have any cream corn, so I added two cans of corn, a can of cream of chicken and 1/4 cup of half and half.  It turned out yummy! My family loved it! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe has become a family favorite.  It comes out perfect every time.  I have made this casserole for many friend and family gatherings and I am always ask for the recipe or asked if I will be binging the corn casserole.  This is a real winner.

I visit a local BBQ joint and one of their sides is corn casserole. I love it so much that I had to find the recipe and make it myself.  I found this recipe via Pinterest. I liked it because it had no cheese in it like a lot of other recipes did.  I made a double batch for a family picnic last week.  I mistakenly omitted the eggs and halved the butter.  Oops!  I baked it for an hour because the other reviews said it took longer.  I let it cool after baking and refrigerated until serving.  i just heated it for about five minutes in the microwave before serving to remove the chill.   It was basically "room temperature".  It turned out delicious!  Everyone raved about it.  It was the only dish on the buffet that was empty!  This dish isn't overly powerful sweet or corn-tasting.  It's a consistency between corn bread and pudding.  I didn't salt it because the canned veggies have enough sodium.   I'm going to a friends BBQ picnic next month and will definitely be making this to take along!   It will also appear on my Thanksgiving table this year too!

The first time I made this was for my son's Cub Scout Blue and Gold Banquet. I'm making it for his high school graduation now. :)
In that time, I have made this DOZENS of times: every holiday, every pot luck, every month just cause. I love it. Love it. LOVE IT. I make mine with a tablespoon of sugar just to be a little sweet. I've always used my 13x9 and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. This makes a semi-soft (while hot) 3/4" slice. I think it is supposed to be served via scoop method, out of a deep dish container but this is easier and more readily measured to make sure all slices are equal. To reheat, I just pat my wet hands on top of the slice, wrap it in Saran wrap and microwave for 2 minutes. I call that "lunch." I told you I loved this stuff! We call it Corn Thing because it isn't really a pudding and it isn't really a bread. It's wonderful. Thanks for all the years of happy eating. I imagine I'll be making this at his wedding someday. :)

This is great! I know it is good if my husband says so. I couldn't bring myself to add a whole stick of butter, so I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup canola oil. Also, I used a home-mixed cornbread mixture instead of the jiffy cornbread packet. I really liked the overall result of this. Also, I baked mine in 4 ramekins instead and it still took about 45 mins before the top started to brown. Thank you so much for this tasty recipe!

This is a holiday side this favorite. Everyone loves it; it's very easy to make. I add two tablespoons of sugar to it just to give it a little more sweetness.

I took this a potluck dinner this weekend and they ate every bit of it and then asked for the recipe.  Very easy to make and I made it just as written.  My oven runs a bit cool so I cooked it at ~365 for exactly 45 minutes.

Was very comforting dish to go with my BBQ ribs and coleslaw.  It was a cold and rainy that evening and I really needed comfort food.  I added onion and green pepper to the butter and cooked it for a few minutes prior to adding to the mixture.

Very easy to make. Followed the exact recipe except I added 4 tbsp of sugar as some viewers suggested. I love corn and cornbread and this was not a disappointment at all. Very moist and tasty! Will definitely make it again for the next gathering.

For Pikupstiks try ordering the mix off of Amazon in their food section Jiffy cornbread mix is so versatile you will use it all up. Good Luck!  Great easy recipe.  good one for kids to start with when they start helping in the kitchen!

I have made this recipe, but never put the butter in, as I just don't think it needs it. I do add chopped red and green bell pepper and chopped onions and grated cheddar cheese to it too. Might take a little longer than 45 minutes to cook, but definitely worth it.

My daughter made this for the first time as a side dish to bring to a family gathering. WOW!!! It was the star of the meal! Now we make it for holiday meals and once in a while just because we have such a craving for it. I have to admit that I even pick on the leftovers cold right out of the frig. It's a family staple now. YUMMY!

Very good, but was almost more like a very moist cornbread rather than a creamy casserole.  I didn't change a thing, and would definitely make it again the same way.  It was sweet, and I loved the kernels of corn in it. Even the leftovers were good two days later reheated in a foil packet in the oven.  My DIL couldn't stop eating it, and my son said he could make a meal of it. Hubby and grandsons liked it, too.  I'll make this again for sure.  Thanks!!

My kids who are super picky loved this. I did not have any sour cream so I used some Heavy Whipping Cream and added a dash of sugar. It was fabulous!!! We will use this again.

This was delicious!  Made it for Christmas and everyone loved it.  I expected it to be an actual "casserole" like the title says, but it came out more like corn bread.  Never the less, I and everyone else loved it.  Very corny :)

We really enjoyed this casserole.  I've made it before using only creamed corn and no sour cream.  This is MUCH more moist and yummy. We loved it!!!

I tried this for the first time and my family loved it. It was for Christmas dinner. I have never made a corn casserole (ate plenty before) and I am not at all a great cook. This was so simple for an average cook like me. I used a can of chopped chilis like another reviewer suggested and it was great.

This is the first time I made this and we all loved it. I like it a little sweet so I added about 1/8 cup of sugar, and I didn't have sour cream so I left that out also. Thank you!

My entire family loves this recipe! I double it to make 16 servings and use light sour cream. I have to make it every big holiday and never get to take what leftovers there are, if any, home with me. It is so easy to make and tastes so good!

This is similar to a corn dish available at El Torito Mexican restaurat - I did not find the texture dry at all, but I did make some changes to the recipe.

 - Used Frozen corn instead of canned corn
 - Used Jiffy corn bread mixture
 - 1 can of diced green chilis
 - Did not add sugar once I added the green chilis, but was considering it

My husband really like it and so did I.  I used an 8x8 pan and had no issues with it overflowing.

Super easy to make.  Great flavor and moist.  Even good the next day.

I used 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup. And I only use 1 egg. This is a simple recipe. Just make sure you have a good corn bread mix.

This is really an easy and versatile recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and used the canned kennel corn as well as cream corn. They stayed crunchy and it always turned out yummy... regardless of serving hot or cold! The best thing is, it can last for more than a week in the fridge!

My auntie has been making this recipe for years, but of course like most old school cooks they cannot give you the portions. lol. But this turned out great. Her recipe is a little more creamy so I might ad a little bit more sour cream and butter next time.

We liked it a lot.  I was concerned at first, b/c I had thought that the texture should be more bread-like, and it did not set that way.  I baked the second batch in a thin layer, but it came out the same way.  Definitely the written bake time is too short.  I had to do both batches for over an hour.

Every year or so I make a new casserole for our Thanksgiving dinner and I'm here to tell you this was a huge hit with my family...they loved it! I will be one we serve over and over again. It turned out as advertized and was delicious. Thank you so much for a great recipe!

My original review disappeared, so I'll try this again. This was FANTASTIC! Easily my favorite dish of Thanksgiving this year! Scanning through MANY reviews, I made mine using only 1 egg, 1 can creamed corn and measured out frozen petite white corn (it's sweeter), added 3/4 tsp sugar, a pinch of salt, black pepper, onion powder and chives, sauteed 1/2 c vidalia onion along with a 4 oz. can green chilies. Mine fit perfectly in an 8x8" dish! I baked closer to an hour, reducing the heat to 325 the last 20 minutes. Perfectly golden color and slightly crispy edges, this will remain on the Turkey Day rotation for many years to come. I also foresee this side dish on the menu alot! This also makes great leftovers, even for breakfast, when warmed and drizzed with honey. Thank you for this "awesome" recipe!

Brought this to a thanksgiving dinner (along with some other items).  It was one of the only dishes that the 15 people were raving about.  I was a little disappointed because it took the least work of all the ones I'd brought! Ha.  That being said, I think next time I will be increasing the cook time to 60 minutes or until top is nice and brown.

Wow, this recipe is AMAZING!!! I got rave reviews for this dish. I cut down the size for 8 people instead of the original amount and added 4 tbsps of sugar. It literally took me 5 minutes to prepare and it was one of the best dishes on the table. This will be a Turkey Day staple at my house from now on!

Been making this for several years.  My husbands family calls it "baked corn".  For some reason every single time I make it, it is never done on time.  I always need to cook a tad longer.  When I have doubled it I find it takes quite a bit longer.  I usually make it for Thanksgiving each year, sometimes Easter and Christmas.  Once in a while as a treat I will make it as a side dish when it's not a holiday.  I love this as leftovers, warmed in the microwave.  This is good stuff!

Wonderful!  I was only serving three, so I split the recipe in 2 9x4.5" pyrex's.  I had a 25 lb turkey in the oven and wanted the bird and the casserole to come out at same time.  So 30 till bird was ready to come out, I turned turkey so the butt(or)neck was toward oven window-i was surprised, but it fit.  And next to it, both small casserole dishes fit, but i had to turn them at a slight diagonal angle.  Took the bird out at the right time (30 min into the casserole's cook time)  and had 15 min to let turkey rest & carve meat for the meal.  Casserole came out perfect 20 min later, roughly 50 total minutes of cook time.  I figurd the extra five would be required for temperature exchange after opening oven to remove bird.  It was perfectly moist in center, browned on outside and done enough to slice into thick pieces.  Wonderful compliment to the turkey and there was not a crumb left! (of one of the two 9x4.5"'s that is ;). I loved that it worked just popping it in with the bird instead of having to wait. Thanks for posting!

This was so good. I can barely turn an oven ON, let alone cook something delicious. I even used less cornbread mix and it came out great. Love it.

I took over making this dish for holidays with my husband's family. One year, I was out of eggs and, of course, who has eggs on Thanksgiving. So, I substituted a 1/2 cup of Miracle Whip for each egg. It turned out fantastic! I only make it this way now.
Also, this is so easy that I rarely prepare ahead of time. On the occasion that I am forced to make this one ahead of time, I mix everything together and refrigerate. I leave the baking for the morning. This doesn't always work very well. It gets a bit crispier around the edges than I'd like, but not burned, so it is a little bit of a time saver.

I made this for the first time and it was great!  Not really a casserole, but it was delicious.  You do have to like corn to enjoy it though.  I had to bake mine for around 50-55 minutes, but I did use a 9x13 instead of 9x9 baking dish.  I also used low-fat sour cream.  Thumbs up!

Tastes very good but was missing something.  I added 1/2 tsp salt, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I'll probably add more sour cream or some shredded cheese.

Made this for a family dinner and everyone LOVED it!  Super easy, anyone could make this!!  I did not adjust this recipe at all.  I would, however, bake longer than 45 minutes.  Only because I like the edges and bottom a little more crispy!  Enjoy!!

I made this for the first time this New Years. My friend literally had one bite, closed his eyes and said WOW this is amazing. I had to give him the recipe on the spot. He actually made it the next day for his family and doubled the recipe, so that he could have leftovers.

Very good flavor, and extremely easy.  The only changes I made were to use only half the butter, and I added a small can of chopped chiles.  Got great reviews - this recipe is definitely going to be a regular in my rotation.  Delicious!

It's good as it is easy to make this side dish. Added a little sugar (cause I like it sweet) topped with cheese and jalapenos. I've made it 4 times already.

Made this casserole for the first time tonight.  WOWZA, it was fabulous.  I didn’t modify the recipe at all, no need to.  Definitely will make again and again.  I saved it to my recipe box.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe..

Excellent dish! So easy to make and everyone loved it.  I added a bit of fresh ground pepper and some salt which gave it a little zing.  This will be on my go-to list from now on

I made this dish last night to go with fried tilapia filets and creamed spinach.  We couldn't stop eating it. It was a little more dense than what I was expecting, based on other reviews...but very delicious regardless. I might try adding a little bit of baking powder next time just to see what happens. I will definitely be making this again. My husband is a huge corn fan.

Excellent! Very light, moist and flavorful. I made exactly as stated but doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 casserole.  I did have to bake it 1 hr. 15 min. in my oven.  Everyone at the party loved it and several asked for the recipe.  I will be making this casserole over and over.

I really thought this was just OK.  No one in my family raved at all over this (which I thought they would as creamed corn is pretty much the ONLY veggie my husband will eat).  I will probably wait a year before giving this another try-I do like corn kernels in my bread.

Made this for Thanksgiving. I am not a big fan of corn but I reaaly liked this casserole. My sister gets headaches from onions so I thought this would be a good recipe that she could eat, It is very good. I did not change the recipe in any way. I will make this again for sure.

I loved this recipe, but I did inhance the flavors by adding two tablespoons of Pimientos, one tablespoon green chili peppers, and one tablespoon of fresh red bell pepper. This spiced it up somewhat. Maybe next time I will use Mexicorn boy Green Giant.

Made this today for Thanksgiving, for the first time, and it was a HIT! I prepped it the night before, with a few revisions. I added the pepper (green, red, and yellow) and onion blend you can find in the frozen section at Kroger. I also let it cook for a little over an hour. I will make this again for sure.

My family loved this recipe! My picky 14 year old gave me a face when I put it on her plate but ate it all and asked for seconds! I did cook it for 55 minutes like the other reviews and added onion. I will definitely make this again!!

I followed the recipe exactly and baked it for one hour like others suggested. It was perfect. If I was serving with something else and wanted a side with a little spice I would add a couple of minced jalepenos.

This was super yummy!  I left the store completely forgetting sour cream, but when I got home I found some vanilla low-fat yogurt and used that instead.  It still didn't come out too sweet.  It was super creamy and had a great corn flavor.  I think this would be great with ham!  Will definately make again, but use the sour cream like the original recipe is written as.

I love corn and I love corn bread! Not many people had tasted such a casserole. It was different than the other corn pies, etc that people's mothers had made. It was sweeter than I expected. Overall- it was a hit at the potluck.

OMG!!!! Sooooooooooooo good, totally a keeper, my kids LOVED it as did I! I used Marie Callender's Honey Butter Corn Bread Mix and it was AMAZING! I, too, only used 3 tbsp. of butter and only one egg as the cornbread mix was a "Just add Water" mix therefore already contained egg, and I wouldnt change a thing!!

Everyone in my house was afraid to try this, but as soon as they did they were all going up for second and thirds. IT was really good! It's a new way to incorate vegetables to your diet and I loved it and going to be making it again and again!

Made this for Easter and it was well received, but I felt like it was missing something. I liked it enough that I will make it again and try adding some different flavors.

This was good....I'm only giving it 3 stars because it wasnt GREAT. It didn't have a ton of flavor, but the consistency was really good. I'm on the fence about it, but not sure if I'd make it again or not.

I grew up eating my mama's corn casserole and this just wasn't quite as good. It wasn't as creamy as I like. It was a good solid recipe, just needs a little tweaking for me.

I made this recipe for my Christmas brunch.  It was amazing and awesome!  After reading the reviews, I doubled the recipe and cut the butter to 1 1/2 sticks, then increased the cooking time to one hour.  I will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe! Dish is cleaned OUT when I take it for Teacher Appreciation Day! It is actually requested... "Mrs. R's corn dish" :O) Does take much longer to cook when the recipe is doubled, but gets a really yummy sweet crust.

I made this just like the recipe the only addition was a tbsp of sugar.  I did put it in the oven for 60 mins rather than 45.  It turned out fantastic and there was no leftovers!

This is an extremely easy and tasty recipe. One thing that we do is add some sugar to make this a little sweet. I have tested it several times with the family and each time it is a success.

I made this recipe nearly exactly as it called for.  The only thing I did different is add green chilies. I was still not too fond of the recipe.  I just didn't like the cornbread taste.

Great!  Made in a 9x9 glass dish and it almost overflowed when cooking but it was fine.  Cooked 50 minutes.  Delicious.

I made this last week and it taste pretty good. Just like another person on here, I added 1 Tbsp. of Sugar to it and you can really taste the corn flavor. Next time I think I'm going to use an extra package of Cornbread Mix so the texture is a little thicker but overall it was pretty good

Very good and very easy.  I added the liquid from the corn, used 1/2 cup of butter and 1  cup sour cream.  My husband, son and son's girlfriend ate two helpings each.  Will definitely make again.

This was a wonderful side dish for Thanksgiving. I did make some changes, but this is a wonderful basic recipe for you to play around with.   I did use half the amount of butter called for, and just about a half a cup of unsweetened applesauce, and it was still delicious.  I also added about a half of a cut up onion, salt and pepper to taste, and about 3 teaspoons of sugar.  There was NOTHING left in the pan after our meal, everyone LOVED it....even my picky kids!

I made this 10 years ago to try something different for a side dish.  We loved it so much, I told my family that I would make it for Thanksgiving.  For my family, it was LOVE at first bite.  Everyone wanted the recipe and now we have to take turns making it for Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Everyone still makes it as a side dish too.  You could add some cheese to the top of it during the last 10 minutes of baking.... YUM!

This is a childhood T-day favorite that my aunt stopped making. I used fat free sour cream, doubled the recipe, filled a 9-13 casserole dish, and froze the rest. Baked out beautifully (even the frozen batch turned out great). Not sure how I felt about using jiffy mix, though. (slight tang)

Wish I could give it more stars!  Absolutely delicious.  I added about 1/4 cup of chopped onion and baked for 1 hour, and it is one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!!

This one's a winner! I followed the recipe as stated and have no complaints.  It's worth five stars as written, and I think changing it up a bit by adding peppers, onions, or even some cheddar cheese would make it 5+ stars.  This is one of those comfort foods and I highly recommend it

This was really good!  I couldnt find corn bread mix so used a stove top stuffing mix instead!  I also added some onion for extra flavor!  This was a great idea!  I made it for Christmas dinner!

This was fun and easy. I am about 5 days away from pay day and we had limited supplies so I looked up what I could do with my corn mix. I found this recipe and I didn't have everything it called for. I substituted cream cheese for sour cream and I added three cups of frozen corn instead of canned or creamed corn. It turned out really good. My 2 and 5 year old really liked it.

It really is awesome and easy. Moist without being cakey. I typically half the recipe and bake in a loaf pan. I think the size of the pan is important in getting the proper consistency.

I followed the recipe but did have to bake longer then 45mins (more like 55min). It was very yummy but seemed to be  missing something after reading other reviews I think next time I will be adding 1c. Cheese and a can of diced green chili's.

Was way too sweet for me.  Could have been the corn bread mix I used.  Will try this again with a different corn bread mix - just FYI that you should not pick a sweet cornbread mix for this recipe.

This is good, I didn't have cornmeal so I just added bread crumbs to it and it worked great. I also added cheddar cheese and that made it very yummy.

This is so delicious!  I usually add a few stalks of chopped green onion and some cayenne or cajun seasoning, sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  Also yummy with some chopped red bell pepper, drained and rinsed black beans and onion.

Absolutely fantastic!  My family loved it and it was sooo easy.  I do not own a 9x9 inch pan so I baked it in a 9 inch glass pie dish and it came out perfectly - it also looked pretty in the pie dish!  Great recipe just the way it is, I'd recommend it to anyone =]

This was good. I did add some jalapenos and some dried red pepper (just a little bit) to give it a kick. Cooked it for 50 minutes instead. My daughter loved it and went for 2 helpings. A great side dish when you want something more than just 'corn'.

Deliciousness in a casserole dish! I've been making a similar version for many years; it's known as "Spoon Bread" in my family. This is ultra easy to put together and the results are yum, yum, yummy! My only suggestion is to bake it for 55 minutes rather than the 45 minutes stated.

I have been making this dish for the past few years and it is always a huge hit.  It is so easy and so versatile!  I serve it for almost every holiday.  It goes great with Turkey, Ham, Chili, Meatloaf..Tacos..almost anything.  It freezes very well for a quick mid week side.  It is easy to change up with peppers, onions, bacon..or is just perfect as listed.  Enjoy!!

Great recipe. I made this for a potluck. Everyone loved it and there was not a spoonful left.  I think the success is in the type of corn used.  I used canned corn, one can of mexican corn and two small cans of shoepeg corn with peppers and green chiles added.  Otherwise the receipe was made just as stated.  It is great and now has a prize place in my personal cookbook!

Loved this rendition!  Didn't change one thing.  Fluffy & custardy, with just the right amount of sweetness.  Thank you!!

My family and I love this dish, I have made it often, sometimes I will add a small amount of cheese to it. I agree with another member that it needs to bake longer-I bake it for an hour. Low fat sour cream is fine to use. This is a dish worth taking to a get together!!

My husband and I love this recipe.  I am vegan so I substituted the butter (margarine) eggs (egg replacer), sour cream (sour supreme).  I've made this a couple times and it turns out great.

I used vanilla Light & Fit yogurt since I didn't have any sour cream and the recipe turned out fabulous! The yogurt gave the casserole a hint of vanilla and a little bit of sweetness. I also used the Krusteaz Honey Cornbread mix instead of cornbread.

My Mother and husband really liked it. So I will give it 4-stars. I am not a big fan of cornbread and that is what it tasted like to me. I also added some green onions for coloring. All in all, I will make it again for the cornbread lovers in my family!

Easy to make, but like someone else stated "you have to like corn." I do, but I don't really like creamed corn, and unfortunately that was all I could taste.

Love this recipe and it's a hit with everyone that eats it.  I made this a couple of days ago and actually forgot to add the butter.  I couldn't taste the difference and it sure eliminates the fat content.  I do add some shredded cheese from time to time, along with diced jalapenos!  Definitely a keeper recipe!!!

I followed this recipe and I don't know..this was an o.k. recipe...I wasn't too fond of it and I actually ate a little bit and didn't eat the rest. It wasn't that it tasted bad but it was more bland than I expected. It was just different and not the corn pudding I remember as a kid. Oh well I'll just look for another recipe...

Yep, it's the best!  Super easy to make, and so hard to stop eating.  I used to make a double batch and eat it all day long for a week.  Bad, I know, but so yummy!

Served with ham on Xmas Eve and whole family loved it! Used all FF sour cream and frozen corn (hate the way canned corn smells).  Also, Jiffy brand cornbread is the correct size, the bagged kind dont have enough.

This is an excellent recipe for a cornbread/side dish but cut the corn down to the small cans.  Way too mushy if you add the whole cans especially the creamed corn.  I added just a little sugar -- very good!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my nephew told my sister that he wasn't letting me in the door for our Christmas get-together this evening without it.  Obviously it was a big hit!  I made it exactly as the recipe directs.  Haven't tried any of the suggestions yet, but some of them sound yummy.

OH YEAH!  I can always rely on this recipe.  I regularly use it with company.  The only thing is that it needs to be cooked about 15 minutes longer at high altitude.

This is the second time of making this dish. I made this for Thanksgiving and was hoping for some leftovers but my sisters and their husbands all loved it! I always get compliments on how good it is. I was asked to make it again for Christmas.

I served this dish with Thanksgiving dinner and it was gone on the first round of the table.  It's a great way to please corn bread lovers without having to bake the corn bread.

Delicious when fresh from the oven.  Since it's just my husband and I, I tried freezing half for a later date.  Hope it's as good when warmed up.

I love that this was soooooo easy!  Sweet enough (but not too sweet) and very moist!  Mine turned out as a delicious cornbread, not a "creamy" casserole.  The recipe I tried stated to drain the can of corn; however, I noticed one reviewer mention that the recipe she followed indicated NOT to drain the corn (and later tried the recipe with 1/2 the water from the can of corn).  Perhaps next time I'll try it with some of the water to see if I like that version.

A little dry, but otherwise this was very good.  I probably would make it again with possibly a few adjustments to retain moisture.

I made the recipe as written, and while it turned out okay, I wasn't a big fan of the taste.  Maybe it's because I don't normally eat canned corn.  My boyfriend thought it was okay.

Made this exactly as written.  It was very easy to make and turned out very creamy.  I agree with several others that some diced onions or green chiles would make a tasty addition.  Cheese too!  But it's still very yummy the way it is.

This really is an awesome dish.  I took one of the reviewer's suggestions and added chopped onions and chopped pimentos and a little bit of salt.  I also added some a few tablespoons of splenda(you could use sugar, but I'm diabetic and don't even keep sugar in the house). I made it a week before Thanksgiving to try it out and my husband loved it.  Took it to two family dinners on the holiday and have made one more time since then...and there were no leftovers.  And it's sooo easy to make.  I highly recomend this!

Good and super easy. Made it the day before and just had to reheat. I added green chiles to half of it to make it more fun for the adventurous. Probably will make again.

This is such a delicious side dish that I make every year around the holidays, and I think this is the best recipe.  I did, however, have to cook it a little bit longer than the recipe called for to get it done all the way in the center.  Overall, a great recipe!

This was great!  I added 2 teaspoons sugar, 1 tablespoon hot pepper relish, 1 tablespoon sweet pepper relish and 1/2 cup mexican cheese blend.  Cooked for 35 minutes and took it out to put 1/2 cup more mexican cheese blend on top and then sprinkled a generous amount of French's Fried Onions on top for the last ten minutes. WOW!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  This is great because you can add just about anything you like to it and it still turns out perfect. :)

Awesome, easy and just plain good!  I made this dish for my family at Thanksgiving and everyone raved and wanted the recipe... no leftovers here!  Though the dish is delicious I think I'll stick to only making it at Thanksgiving and for company because it does have an entire stick of butter! hah

I made this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a huge hit!  It was everyone's favorite side dish on the table, by far.  I've gotten several requests to make this for family members who want to sit down and eat the entire pan!  The greatest part about this recipe is that it really is easy -- I don't think it's even possible to mess it up!  I'm going to try adding some green veggies next time to change things up.

This was easy, quick, inexpensive and I did receive one or two compliments on it last Thanksgiving. But, I have to say, it just wasn't very exciting. It was bland and too sweet at the same time.

This was good, but it seemed to be missing something.  The flavor wasn't all there.  I'm not sure what could be added to complete it, but it was all eaten regardless.

I don't know what I did wrong, but I really didn't like this, at all. I used the recipe, as originally shown, adding ONLY a cup of chopped onions.    I found dish to be overly sweet for a dinner meal and it was more like eating a dessert. Not a good dessert, but a dessert.  Even if I would add less sugar, though, I suspect that I'd not enjoy this.

Very Good!  Lowered fat by cutting butter in 1/2 and leaving some juice from canned corn.  Used reduced fat sour cream.  Added 1 can of green chile's but will cut that in next time, overpowered the flavor.

I made this recipe for the first time this Thanksgiving, but I changed it a little and it turned out fine. I used a can of corn, a can of peas and carrots, instead of creamed corn, and added half can of cream of chicken soup, along with the sour cream and eggs, and butter. I sprinkled cheddar cheese on top. I would like to know if anyone has made changes like this before? The recipe turned out good, and everyone liked it.

Big hit at Thanksgivingdinner  table.  So quick and easy to assemble -- which I did the night before, brought close to room temp and then cooked along with other side-dishes in a 375 oven while turkey was resting.  Definitely a new must-have side dish.

Super easy, yummy recipe!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I mixed all ingredients about two hours before dinner.  I threw it in the oven as we took the turkey out.  By the time we made gravy and carved the turkey it was ready!

I made this for Thanksgiving. I accidentally left out the butter, and it still worked great! I'm gonna try it with the butter next time.

This was super easy to make and was the perfect replacement for the frozen name-brand corn souffle I could no longer find at the grocery store. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was requested that I make it for every family dinner in the future.

This was an excellent addition to our Thanksgiving meal.  Even the picky eater loved it.  I added some minced onion and chopped red and green bell pepper.  It added to the flavor and gave it a festive appearance.  I doubled the recipe, using a large casserole dish.  It required more cooking time which made the edges a bit crispy.  Next time I will bake two batches.

I made this for Thanksgiving for 28 people. I doubled the recipe into a 9x13 pan and added some black pepper, too. It was a hit! I'd definitely make this again.

Great results!  The only change I made was to top the casserole with bread crumbs.  It reminds me of a corn-oyster casserole my mom used to make.  This should prove adaptable if I ever want to add to it -- though I can't imagine why I would want to mess with perfection!

I made this casserole as part of my Thanksgiving dinner.  It was very easy to make and tasted great!  Instead of using a 9x9 pan, I used two 8' rounds.  I made one pan directly from the recipe (for my sister) and one pan with 1/4 tsp. onion powder and 1/4 of a bell pepper (for my mom and me). Both of them turned out great! I will definitely make this again!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but it ended up too dry despite my having added a can of chopped chilies (very wet) and having drained only some of the water off the kernel corn.  Perhaps I will try again with 1/2 the cornbread mix.  This had more of a feel of dressing, which I wasn't expecting.

All 4 of my picky kids liked this recipe, so it gets 4 stats.  I thought it was okay.  Taste like mushy cornbread to me.  I added garlic powder and chopped onion, but it was still a little bland. I also used 1 3/4 cup frozen corn instead of the canned whole corn.  The addition of meat, maybe cheese or other seasoning would improve this recipe, and easily make it into a main dish.  Tested out for a Thanksgiving side, but I will not use it...too similar to stuffing or cornbread dressing.  Think I will go with "Slow Cooker Creamed Corn" for a side dish...try it out if you like cream cheese!

This is a very tasty dish.  I would prefer to serve it, however, at a buffet or potluck with several other dishes.  I would not serve it as a stand-alone vegetable dish again because of the texture and sweetness of the cornbread mix (I used a Betty Crocker mix).  I will make it again, but only when I know there are other vegetable dishes being served.

I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck at work. It was not a hit...I had doubled the recipe, but less than half was eaten. The main problem was the lack of seasoning...All the flavors were very bland in my opinion.

My husband loved this, I thought it lacked a bit of seasoning and needed more corn.  I liked it better with salt and pepper.  Maybe a little sugar baked in would have been good.  I will make it again but next time will use another drained can of whole kernal corn in addition to the amount all ready in there.

I add a few drops of Tobasco, depending on your heat tolerance, and you get just a hint of heat after eating a few bites of this. I always serve it with my Southwest Pot Roast. Everyone loves both recipes.

i made this dish exactly as the recipe states and it was very tasty! next time, though, i will take the other reviewers suggestions and cut the butter in half and use low fat sour cream.. it was very rich made as-is.

My family absolutely loved this even when I was indifferent.  Came out really moist and with a lot of corn flavor.  It was easy to make so I can't complain.  Recommended for those who love corn!  I might try to reduce the amount of liquid so it comes out like a cornbread rather than a casserole.  Bon appetite!

Since we recently moved to Texas, I wanted to make something "southern" feeling as a side dish for friends. I thought this was outstanding, creamy and delicious however my fiance just said it was "OK". It kind of reminded me of the corn dish they serve on mexican plates at Chevys, which my fiance doesnt like either! If you like that, You'll love this!!

It's really not for us.  Made the recipe right, I liked the creamy flavor of it, but it did taste a little too much like corn bread.  I was looking more for a casserole dish or a corn dish, not something like corn bread.

I really enjoyed this creamy corn casserole.  I mixed a little shredded cheddar into the batter and then sprinkled some cheese on top immediately after taking it out of the oven.  I doubled the recipe and it took about an hour and twenty minutes to bake.  It was good though I think I like corn casserole II a little better.

I have made a very similar version to this (Paula Deen version) but the other didn't have eggs.  I think the eggs help give this some lift.  We all really liked it.....however, it did need to go for a full 60 minutes to be cooked through and not all sticky.  Was great with smoked brisket and a cucumber and onion salad.

I loved this.  I used less butter than called for and a low fat sour cream and it still tasted very buttery and creamy.  The texture and flavours make it very addictive!

I made this exactly as written and it was soooooooo AWESOME! I was nervous because I was serving this as a side dish but also had dinner rolls. I didn't want this to just come out like corn bread........... It didn't!!! This was soooo creamy and moist (really hard to explain) if you're debating on trying this one, do it! It's true- everyone will ask for the recipe!! New fam. fav.

I made this for Christmas party and it was gone in minutes.  When I made it I used frozen corn and made my own creamed corn.  Delicious, thank you for sharing your recipe.

Everyone loves this and wants the recipe.  I could eat it for the main course.  Have thought about adding ham or sausage to make it a complete main casserole.  Left overs are great.

This was the hit of the 4th of July BBQ!!  Since I live in Albuquerque, I had to add green chile, I kept everything else the same.  Fantastic, this will be a tradition from now on!!  Thanks a bunch!

This is a super cozy side dish!  I'm just starting out cooking and I've been making this at holidays for the past few years.  I just had my first request for it for a Father's Day BBQ!  You know it's a good recipe when people request it year after year!

I made this and it was great!  I made it with a cup of self-rising corn meal, 3 T of sugar instead of the muffin mix.  The kids loved it.  It did take an hour to cook though, but definitely worth the time.

Easy and delicious. Very similar to a corn pie I make except for the sweetness. This is a perfect everyday side dish. The only thing I suggest is if you buy salt free canned goods (like I do), make sure you add some salt to this dish

Very yummy!  Next time I'll add just a touch of seasoning: about 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t pepper.  Everything else was perfect (including baking time!)!

This recipe was great and I was pleased to find a lighter version of our old recipe.  I didn't have the Jiffy mix so I substituted other ingredients to make my own, I used frozen corn so it had to cook a little over an hour.  Also I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup non-fat plain yogurt.  Then I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup apple sauce to further cut down the fat.  Despite all my changes, it turned out GREAT!!  Next time I might go all yogurt and all apple sauce.

Certainly not haute cuisine, but just as certainly a delicious side dish for almost any meal! My mom has been making this for family holiday gatherings for several years now, and it's always one of the fastest-disappearing dishes on the table. What else can I say? It's good stuff, and it's cheap to make!

My friend made this for her daughter's 1st birthday 5 years ago and I still remember how yummy it was, so I asked her for the recipe so I could make it for my son's 1st birthday party.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!  Even my very italian Mother-in-law and believe me she is picky!!!  I did add a little sugar to it (maybe 2tbs) and it was perfect. This is definatly a keeper!!

Thanks for a great recipe that I made for Thanksgiving, Christmas and now, the New Year's dinner party for our neighbors.

This was an amazing dish! I actually didn't have enough sour cream, so I mixed in plain yogurt. It was still a rich, and very moist dish. Next time I might try a whole cup of yogurt to make this healthier.

This recipe is so simple, yet so  delicious.  It doesn't need any tweaking from the formula listed.  Just mix everything together, throw it in a pan, and cook.  How much easier can it get.

It wasn't too sweet, too dry, or too moist. What I did was used 2 cans sweet yellow corn (1 was creamed, the other was not). I also decided to add half of the corn juice that the yellow corn came. In my opinion, it was just the right amount. On a side note, the corn casserole tastes better on the days following the initial day. I would make this again, but make it a day in advance, so that it would be more flavorful the next day.

I personally don't care for this type of dish, but my family frequently requests and raves over this.  I often add chopped onions and shredded cheddar cheese.

Solid side-dish. I added 1 chopped jalepeno and about 1/4 teaspoon white pepper for extra flavor. I reduced the sour cream to 1/4 c and served more on the side. Topped casserole with two whole scallions for decoration, which also added to the flavor. Definitely will make again!

I made this yesterday for Christmas dinner, and everyone liked it. I found it to be more like a corn bread than like a veggie side dish, but it was quite good. I loved that I prepped it the morning and just popped it into the oven later. More time with guests and less cooking!

This is an excellent recipe - delicious and super easy to make.  I made it (first time)for Christmas dinner and doubled it baking it in a aluminum pan from Costco.  I did have to bake it for about 25 min longer because it didn't seem done - maybe because it was in a bigger deeper pan.

Not what I expected. Was very dense and more like cornbread than a casserole. Was expecting something along the lines of a green bean casserole except with corn.

Quick and Easy recipe. It was more like a corn pudding w/ top crust. Very good. I do think seasoning added would give it more flavor.

Easy and yummy recipe.  I doubled it and added a little extra time to the cooking time--turned out wonderful.  I also put a little grated cheese on top toward the end of cooking.  When reheating leftovers, put a little milk in the bottom of the pan--it's just like fresh!  I used light sour cream and a little less butter.

Followed the recipe to a "t", and it was a huge hit! Other reviewers who thought it needed something must not be huge corn fans, cuz it stands alone deliciously if you like corn. However, I do see how it could be a great base to play around with by adding cheese, onions, etc. This will be a side-dish staple!

Made this for our Thanksgiving meal.  Everyone loved it.  I did add three chopped green onions to mine.  I was even lazy and mixed all mine in the 9x13 dish that I baked it in. I just sprayed the dish before adding the ingredients.  Saved washing another bowl and worked like a charm.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this casserole based on the rave reviews and normally I love everything from this site. This, however, was the exception. I love corn, my kids love corn, my husband loves corn... we all hated this. I followed the recipe to a T, but it just isn't tasty enough as it is... maybe if I added cheese and bacon  or chopped chiles as others have suggested it would be better, but as is I wouldn't make again. :(

I didn't canned creamed corn, so I used 3/4 can of milk and 1/4 can of half'n half instead.  My family really like it anyway!  Will definitely fix again.

Awesome!  Yumm.  I love this recipe. I used a little less corn because I wanted to be more "bready" and  2 Tablespoons of sugar and it turned out so good.

This casserole was very moist and tasted like corn bread.  I do think it was a little bland however, and needs some more spice.  I added chopped scallions which helped, but it still needed more.

This is my husband's number one requested dish.  I doctor it up with a chopped jalapeno and about a cup of grated cheddar cheese.  Leftovers are just as good if not better since the flavors intensify.  It's a keeper!!

Have been making this for a long time.  One of my favorite recipes on allrecipes.  I love corn and this is so easy and delicious.  Can be whipped up in a second and tossed in the oven.  Yum!  I don't use a packaged corn bread mix though.  Instead I just mix up a double batch of the dry ingredients of a cornbread recipe.  I think I get more of a cornbread-type casserole than a souffle-y one, which I love!

I've been making this recipe for about 4 years now and everyone who has ever tasted it has raved about it! I also like to add some color to it by adding a can of diced green chile peppers. I have had good results doubling the recipe and baking in a 9x13 pan as well. I like to bake it until it has a nice golden color on top, usually a little longer than the recipe calls for. It is just yummy!

Hands down my favorite recipe from Allrecipes.com! Every time I make this I get the best praise, but I've only given out the recipe once (okay, so I'm a bit selfish, I admit!). I like to mix it all together in the casserole dish so I only have one dish to clean. Thanks!

This is the most delicious stuff!  I had been trying to find a good way to make corn rather than on the cob or just out of a can.  I never knew corn could be so tasty.  Love it!!

Very moist, nice change from regular cornbread. I think we may use this as a starter receipe for a SW type breakfast cornbread since we didn't like the one I tried b/4 from this website. We only had 1/3c of sour cream & I think that is really enough. It does bother me that it calls for 1/2c butter. Since the dry pkg of cornbread mix I bought wasn't 8.5 oz, we added our reg cornmeal to bring it up to the 8.5 oz called for. We'll try adding sausage, can of green chillies, cheese & red pepper next time for a breakfast dish.

Made it twice this week!  My family and friends LOVED it.  I added a can of Mexican corn instead of regular whole kernel.  I also added some chopped cilantro and a pinch of sugar as other reviewers have suggested.  So delicious!

This is a pretty good cornbread.  I used Jiffy so it was sweet and I added chopped green chile and diced green onions.  It's a good side for Thanksgiving and since it can be made ahead or even served at room temperature it's an easy dish for when your oven is filled with other goodies.  It's very easy to prepare -only a few minutes and mixed by hand -always a plus!

This was super easy and tasted great.  It was very moist and bread-y.  I could use a little more corn though.  Next time I'll probably add an additional small can of corn.

I make this dish ALL THE TIME.  It's a great alternative to plain corn.  My picky kids shovel it in.  I've had to write down the recipe countless times for folks.  I pretty much follow the recipe to a T...I have added some honey before baking, but I didn't really taste it in the end product.  ONE CAUTION: Keep your eye on it, I usually have to cook it longer than the recipe states because the middle can be undercooked.  Still delicious though!

I can't say enough about this recipe-it it always a winner! I normally double it to go into a 9 x 13 dish. I also omit the sour cream. This makes the casserole a little less pudding like, but it still turns out great!

I am always asked for this recipe when I take it somewhere.  It is so easy to prepare and tastes so good.  I add 1 TBSP of sugar.  This is excellent with everything from Thanksgiving dinner, sloppy joes, Mexican, etc.  You can't go wrong with this.

I haven't met a person yet who doesn't love this dish!  Recently, I made 32x the recipe for a casual church dinner for 240 people!  It couldn't have been simpler to assembly line the production!  Occasionally, if I serve it with Mexican food, I'll use Mexicorn instead of regular canned corn.

I added a bunch of raw sugar on top to make a sweet crust.  And when serving leftovers, I put more sugar on it before microwaving.  I guess we just like sweet corn casseroles.

This was a different way to make corn, but defninately delicious.  I used frozen corn instead of canned and light sour cream. I will experiment with using much less butter - it's very rich.

This is delicious, but really just comes out tasting like cornbread.  In fact, it's so close to the cornbread I normally make, that the second time I made it, I cut the butter by half, added cheddar cheese and a can of green chiles and I found myself eating my normal cornbread.  Nice and easy though, and it won  me some compliments at the table, so thanks!

Yum! I followed this recipe almost to the letter and received rave reviews at Christmas dinner.  Nearly everyone asked me for the recipe -- I'm glad the host had a copy machine so I didn't have to handwrite a dozen copies!
I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9X13 dish for 70 minutes.  I made the mixture as called for with the exception of adding two tablespoons of sugar, a bunch of chopped green onions, and only using 15-ish ounces of cornbread mix since that's all that was in the box.
Great recipe and super, super easy!

I made this for Christmas today. It was GREAT!!! I actually made it yesterday evening & didn't cook it all the way. I covered it with tin foil & stuck it in the fridge. Popped it into the oven this afternoon to finish cooking it & heat it up at the same time. My father-in-law especially raved about this. It will now become a family tradition.

This has become a staple at our holiday table, both at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It is a nice change from the traditional green bean casserole, and it is very easy to throw together.  I typically double the recipe and mix everything the day before.  About an hour before dinner, I put the mixture in the oven to bake.  Delish and doesn't overpower anything else at the table.

This is the simplest best tasting corn casserole or pudding that I have ever had.  Adults and children alike loved this recipe for thanksgiving and I definitely plan to make it again.  You don't have to wait for a special occassion to make this one.  This recipe is better than some others I have tried because you use 2 eggs.  Without the eggs, the recipe is too too wet and tastes not quite done even with extra cooking time.  This recipe is just perfect!!!  I highly recommend it.

I made this for a chili party I was having and this was really good.  It was a fifty-fifty split on who loved it and liked it. But at least nobody hated it.  Like everyone else says I would cook this an hour esspecially if you have a lower heating oven.  Great inexspesive way to jazz up cornbread and a good way to use up some corn.  Will make this again.

You just can't go wrong with this recipe! Here's why...
I actually doubled the recipe because I wanted it for a big crowd, but didn't have the second can of creamed corn that was needed, so I added an extra 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1 TBSP. of sugar instead. The mixture was very creamy and I was concerned about it being too moist---It was wonderful! After reading from others here that it needs a little more time in the oven, I baked it for 55 minutes. It was a lovely golden brown and mildly sweet. The inside was moist yet almost cake-like. Despite altering this recipe, it came out delicious- I don't think you could mess it up! It was a perfect accompaniament for the Bavarian Meatballs recipe from this site; It would go well with a multitude of dishes. It got a big thumbs up from the family- I will definitely be making this again!

I was worried about choosing to make something for the first time at a large gathering.  My oldest daughter and my sister both warned me they do not like corn bread and probably wouldn't even try it....it looked so good...they loved it, everyone loved it.  My sister even asked for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Instant success on my first try (at thanksgiving), and it disappeared really quick.  I added 1/2 cup sugar.  Didn't add all of the can of corn, maybe used 2/3 of the can.  Baked it for an additional 10 minutes (so a total of 55 min) than called for in the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving & it was easy and delicious!  I found this to be more of a corn bread type consistency, although I drained the corn juice.  I also used low fat sour cream and added a 1/4 cup of sugar. I will make this again although next time I will decrease the amount of butter.

It looked and smelled good but the taste was only okay.  It needed more taste.  It took about 1 hr 15min to bake.  I'd only make it again b/c it was soo easy to make!

I have been using this recipe ftom this site for the last few years and everyone loves it.  I make one whole casserole for my son at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I usually have to make some changes even to 5 star recipes, but this one is perfect just the way it is.

I made this recipe exactly as written and brought it to a potluck at work.  Everyone loved it and there was nothing left.  I made it in a ceramic dish so I could re-heat it in the microwave.  Great recipe - I am bringing it to Thanksgiving!

This dish has become a staple at every holiday event at my house the last few years. It is requested at every holiday potluck both at work and family member's houses. Great recipe!! An easy way to sneak in vegetables for those family members that don't like anything grown from the ground.

Great recipe, it's been a hit everywhere and makes me look like I can really cook. :)

I use 1.5 cans of creamed corn only for my taste and texture preference.

This recipe was great, although I thought it could have used a little salt. I also added about half of the juice from the corn so it was very nice and moist. Delicious- definately will be made regularily.

Yummy! This stuff is really good. I had to cook it a lot longer than the 45 minutes to get the top to brown but other than that it was perfect. I didn't have a can of creamed corn so I drained a can of whole corn added a little milk and put it in the blender to chop up, it still turned out really really good.

When you make something with preconceived notions you end up giving the recipe a low rating.  For some reason I thought this would be like corn pudding.  I was wrong.  I didn't like this, at all.  I did eat the portion I put on my plate so I guess it wasn't all bad.

Great recipe!  Made it with bar-b-que pork for a party.  Everyone loved it-and many went back for seconds!!

I did double the recipe for a large crowd- and only a little bit leftover!

My husband said this recipe is a keeper!

This is one of several recipes for corn casserole that I have made and it is my absolute favorite. The souffle type texture really makes it delish to me.  I added a small amount of shredded cheese to the batter just because I love cheese in almost everything.  Next time I will saute some chopped green onion in the butter before mixing. (Another personal choice of mine.) Will serve well for my church fellowship lunches too. Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious.  Have made it several times.  It tastes very much like the Pennsylvania Dutch spoonbread served at the Farnsworth House in Gettysburg, PA

I really don't know what all the fuss is here. We thought there was way too much corn. It was okay, but I will definitely keep looking for the perfect cornbread recipe.

EXCELLENT.  I made this with some baked chicken and even my picky toddler liked it.  I only had to bake it for 40 minutes, but I have a really hot gas oven.  I personally think that cheese would ruin the sweetness of the dish.  But you could experiment.. with jalepenos or green chiles and cheese for a more savory flavor.. I did not add additional sugar, my cornbread mix was sweet enough.  I also used lowfat sour cream.

Great recipe for BBQ or Mexican food. Did not use any of the canned juice from whle kernel corn.  Only used 1/2 c. sour cream, but added 1/2c. buttermilk and 1/2 c. cream cheese (blend buttermilk, sour cream and cream cheese together). Also added 1/4 c. white sugar, 1/2tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper and green chiles.  Made earlier in the day and refrigerated. Pulled out of refrigerator about 45 minutes before baking to let it come to room temperature in 9x11 pan. Baked closer to 1 hour before it was golden brown on top. Was absolutely wonderful!  More like a sweet, spoon corn bread.

Excellent but had to cook much much longer than stated. I'd guess at least and hour and a half.  Served with Honey Pecan Pork Chops and  will def. make again.

Made this for Christmas, it was almost like a firm custard.  It was ok, I followed the recipe exactly and it seemed to be the family's least favorite of what I prepared.  Doubt I'll make it again, but glad I got to try it.

Perfect...  Was the perfect compliment to our meal of smoked BBQ pork ribs that had everyone asking for seconds.  I have tried other corn casserole recipes and this is by far the best.  It set well, was easy to tell when it was done and was not at all watery because of the mix in it.

Excellant!  I baked w/several other side dishes for Thanksgiving meal.  Corn casserole needed about 10 more minutes in the oven.  I think that was because I baked in 2 qt. round dish.  This is the easiest and fastest corn casserole recipe you can make. Family loved it!

I tried this for the first time for Thanksgiving and it was INCREDIBLE!!!  It was incredibly EASY to prepare and it just got rave reviews from my guests.  Guests commented that they could just eat the entire casserole.  This casserole turns out light and fluffy and you don't feel like an overstuffed turkey after eating it.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and will become a staple dish in our household.  I'm going to share this recipe with everyone I know.

This recipe is fabulous. Very simple and easy to make, but it tastes delicious! I was hunting everywhere for a quick dish to make for a potluck I was going to, and this did the trick! No leftovers or complaints. I did bake in a 9x13 pan (plenty of batter)  for 45 min though.

yum yum yum. turned out a little on the crumbly side the first time I made it, but the second time I added some buttermilk and pecorino-romano cheese that I had on hand, plus a good bit of sugar, and it was moist and delish. I also only used one egg. my family loved it at Thanksgiving... and it's SOOOO easy.

I have tried other corn casseroles and many of them are dry.  This one is creamy and wonderful.  I like using white corn in this recipe instead of yellow.  My family loves this casserole.

My family LOVES this and I have been asked to make it for numerous gatherings. The only thing is that I usually have to bake it for almost 1h15 before the top gets golden enough. Still, this is delicious!

This had really good flavor and was very easy to make.I only gave it 4 stars because I found it to be alittle too dry.But a pat of butter on a serving helped matters along.Next time I will add sone heavy creme or half and half.

Made this as a side dish for a dinner party and it was a hit. There was none left at the end of the night. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was ok but I have had better corn casseroles. The top of the casserole burned trying to get the insides to cook. Thanks for the recipe.

A bit too dry for us.  My husband, child and I thought the flavor was good, but it needs something to moisten it. OK, but won't make again.

Wonderful.  I don't have a 9x9 pan, so I used a pyrex pie pan with a cookie sheet under to catch any runover, and it worked just fine.

Awsome recipe.  I took this to a pot luck and everyone loved so much that they asked for the recipe.  Now, whenever there is a pot luck, someone else says that they are going to make this before I get a chance...don't share the recipe.  This is extremely easy to make and everyone LOVES it.

I made this recipe for the first time at Thanksgiving and it was easy to make, easy to clean up the mess (really, what mess?) and so easy to eat.  It is now a staple at my dinner table.  I did add a bit of sugar and it was fabulous!!!

It was good but seemed to be missing something...perhaps a little bit of sugar and a little less of the corn bread mix.  Maybe I did something wrong, though it is very easy.  Needs more cook time for sure.

I have tried many Creamed Corn Casseroles over the years so my family has a lot of "experience".  Hands down, they all said this was THE best.  Works for me!  Thanks for sharing this keeper.

I did not really enjoy this with my meal only because I do not like mixing anything sweet with my meals.  It is a bit on the sweet side and it was almost like dessert for me.  I loved how it tasted on its own.  My family loved it for Christmas dinner and they ate it with the rest of the meal with many compliments.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

Wonderful recipe! It tastes like corn bread in meal form. I used mayo instead of cream and it turned out wonderful.

Good but I think it needed more cooking time although I did bake it 5 more minutes than directed.  Will definitely make it again.

Ok,  I have to say this, my kids LOVE this, and it is soooo easy.  Every time I make corn they want this instead.

My oldest liked it with less lumpy corn so I put the corn in a blender and she LOVED it too.

I also made this for Thanksgiving and people were scraping the dish to get the last bits!!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was definitely a hit!  Everyone loved it!  I used a Mexican cornbread mix and it was wonderful -- may try adding green chiles next time as other reviewers suggested.  It had more of a dense cornbread texture than I expected so I would like to make it again when cornbread dressing is not on the menu, just for more variety.  I'll definitely make it again!

This is a great dish.  I made it for Thanksgiving and my whole family loved it.  My sister even asked me to bring it a pot luck she hosted a few weeks later.  I made a few changes that other users recommended.  I used 1 cup of melted butter, added 1 tbs. of sugar, some salt, used corn muffun mix instead of corn bread mix, and I also sprinked cheese over it before and after baking (I don't think it matters what type of cheese).  I will definitely be making this over and over again.  Its a keeper in my recipe book :).

Delicious!  Was just a little bit gummy in the middle of the casserole, but I'm positive it's because I didn't bake it for the full amount of time.  Will be making again for sure, and I'll be sure to bake it for the proper time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is very similar to a recipe that we have always used sans the sour cream and whole kernel corn. I enjoyed it but my kids didn't. They thought that the cream style corn was ok but they really werent liking the whole kernel. I thought that the sour cream added a nice touch to this dish. It made the texture very smooth and not crumbly.

This one's a keeper.  We hosted our first Thanksgiving Dinner and included this -- it was probably the most well-received of everything I cooked.  I doubled the recipe and used reduced fat butter and sour cream.  Otherwise, no modifications.

This is the second cream casserole I have tried and the results were the same: good taste, but the product was gummy. Tried both nuking and frying it, but the bottom stayed unphased.
     The top, however, was terrific. Two stars were the best I could do.

This version of the corn casserole is even better than the ones that you use a can of cream soup. I was a little short on sour cream when I made this and added more corn. I made this for a pot luck served with spiral ham and it was GONE and many of the husbands there were asking for the recipe!

This was so easy to make, just put everything in a bowl, mix and stick in the oven.  I used a Mexican cornbread mix to add a little spice, doubled the recipe, and took it to work for a potluck Thanksgiving luncheon. It was delicious.  I had several people ask for the recipe. Definitely a keeper for my recipe box.

This was a fantastic dish on my Thanksgiving table. No one expected the corn on the inside, and it was sweet but not too sweet. This dish was so great great I also made it for breakfast a couple days after Thanksgiving.

This casserole had a really great taste. I should've known by the recipe title, but I was expecting more of a bread-like dish.  It was very creamy (mushy, but in a good way) dish and turned out great.

Corn casserole is my husbands absolute favorite comfort food. I have tried over 5 recipies for corn casserole.  Most were from friends or family.  Once I made this one, my husband said that this was "the one"......and now I make it about twice a month, and it is a MUST for family gatherings!!!

I added 2 TBS sugar and 1/4 cup green onions as others have suggested.  The flavor was excellent. The only minor complaint is that it was a little drier than I wanted but that maybe was due to the fact that I cooked this a day ahead of time then re-heated in the oven.

This was good and well-liked at the dinner table, but it was lacking a bit in flavor, in my opinion. I think it might be the sour cream which makes the inside of the casserole a little too bland, though I'm not sure what I would add instead.

This was such an easy and delicious dish!! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup white sugar to the recipe and then sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on top. I made it the night before and it turned out beautifully.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I sprinkled shredded sharp cheddar on top to brown, but I think I will add it to the main mixture as well next time.

My family loves this!!  Nice and firm texture, not runny like most corn casseroles.  I made one adjustment to make it creamier, I reduced the sour cream to 1/2 cup and added 4 oz softened cream cheese.  Absolutely Delicious !!  Thanks Ruthie !!

I thought this was good... although more like a cornbread pudding than a casserole.  Different but good and will definitely make again.  I added a medium, chopped, green pepper and medium, chopped, white onion.  Cooked mine for about and hour and ten minutes.

So easy!! Perfect texture, I would suggest adding a little salt and sugar to bolden the flavor, but this should be the base for all corn casseroles. Add cheese,   peppers, herbs, or for a sweeter side add honey. YUM.

I made this for a potluck. It was wonderful!! I didn't realize that here in Trinidad (West Indies) there is a dish called Corn Pie. I was told by a local boy that this was better than his mom's Corn Pie!  I'll definitly be making this again and again!

Easy to make, and was good. Not a favorite of mine, but it was good for a change from standard side dishes. WOuld be nice for a covered dish type of meal.

Everyone in my family loved this recipe.  I added some sugar and only about half of the sour cream because I was afraid it would be too sour-creamy for our taste.  Next time, I think I'll add all the sour cream to make it just a little more moist.  But still, it was very tasty even with my modifications.  I will definitely make it again.

I am not much of a corn bread person, but this recipe was really excellent. After reading other readers comments I added a tiny bit of grated med cheddar cheese, a dash of Kosher salt, a dash of sugar and I used lowfat sour cream.  It was moist, and delicious!  My husband LOVED IT, and just about ate himself sick on it.   EDITED - I now make this in my air fryer and it's even BETTER!!!

This recipe is AWESOME!  It is just like the little scoop that you get from a mexican restaurant.  It was a big hit with my hubby.  I am going to make it again this weekend for a BBQ I am attending.  It is SO easy and tasty!  Thanks!

Everyone thought it was good, but not GREAT.  I added green onions and my 4-year old concentrated on picking those out ;).  I just wish there were a way to make 1/2!!!

5 stars both for taste and being so easy! Takes maybe three minutes to get this casserole in the dish and into the oven, and it comes out delicious. Will definitely make again. Great side dish.

I can see why this got 5 stars!  It is amazing and so easy to make.  I took it to an Easter get-together and everybody wanted the recipe!  I doubled the recipe and used lite sour cream instead of full-fat.  I also added green onions for some color like another person had suggested.  (Great idea!)  My husband thought it was cornbread when he first saw it, but it is creamier on the inside.  A doubled recipe filled a 9 x 13 and two-thirds of an 8 x 8 pan.  Yummy!  Thank You!

We had this the other night for a family dinner and it was very good as a side dish.  It had just the right consistency to be called a corn casserole  (as opposed to some of the other comments) My husband ate about half the pan.

This is a great casserole!  My family (including toddlers and picky adults) raves every time I make it.  I ran out of sour cream once and used half plain yogurt and it still turned out great.

My husband, I and son all agreed, that the corn pieces needed to be out of the recipe.  The taste was good, but the texture and biting into corn constantly, made this dish horrible.  Too much corn.

Yum, this was a very good slightly sweet dish, very soft texture. Firmed up as it cooled. I used fat free sour cream and a little less butter-6Tbl. in an effort to cut some fat. Also my corn bread mix was only 6.5oz, so I think thats why mine took longer to cook about 60min.

my Mom thought that her corn pudding was the favorite of the family...not any more! I added some sugar to the ingredients and it came out wonderful. A staple to family gatherings now.

This was good, but not great. It would make a great side dish for an event. But I might play with the recipe next time because it seemed like it needed something more to be added to it. It wasn't bad though.

Soooo easy to make and a great side dish for any day of the week.. Only downside to this recipe is the high fat content which might be lowered by switching to low fat ingredients...but will it taste as yummy??

This dish was mediocre. I felt that it lacked "something", but couldn't quite put my finger on it. I may try it again, but this time I will have to play with the recipe.

This was overall good I suppose, though it was a little on the sweet side. It got 50/50 ratings on Christmas. Half thought it was delicious, the other half thought it was just ok. It's worth trying to see if your tastebuds like it!

There is a resturant in NYC called Elmos on 7th Ave in Chelsea that serves a small portion of corn casserole as a side to many of their entrees.  This tastes identical!  So good and easy.

YUM!  I made this recipe for the first time in 2003, when I was pregnant and making up a bunch of casseroles to freeze for quick meals after the baby came...and this was hands-down my favorite one. I've made it at least half a dozen times since (made it this week because I'm expecting again next month!!  Did one to freeze and one to eat now), and though the texture comes out a little different every time (due to the different brands of mixes, etc. I guess I use), it's always delicious.  Thanks so much!

Practically everyone in my family is very carb-conscious, so intitally, I considered deleting this from my Thanksgiving menu.  Carb-conscious or not, it was gobbled up.  I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing, Ruthie!

I made this in individual ramekins for our first course at Thanksgiving this year, with a little spoon of cranberry sauce, and it was quite delicious. The only change I made was to use only 1/2 the muffin mix so it would be more eggy and less bready. I would make again!

Good but this was mainly "just another side dish" at Thanksgiving.  Everyone ate it but no one really commented on it specifically.  I will make it again because my son liked it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this on Thanksgiving and it turned out, well, AWESOME!  I doubled the recipe cooking it in a 9x13 dish.  I was scared it would overflow, but it baked up with no mess! Changes: as suggested, I added a 1/2 of the corn water per 1 can of corn and added cooked, chopped bacon to the top.  Cooked perfectly and very moist.

Excellent and easy recipe... my husband loved it!  Next time I'm going to cut it down to half a can of cream corn so it won't be so moist and add some jalapenos.

THANK YOU! I've been looking all over for this recipe since losing mine and needing a Thanksgiving side dish for those who don't like stuffing.  It's not too "gourmet" for kids and adults like the souffle-like texture.  I sometimes add a little sugar or honey if I'm expecting very young children.

This is the same recipe my Mom uses.  It is so good!  It is one of my hubby's favorites, and is always on our table for holiday dinners.  Cheap and good!

This is a very good corn casserole.  I am considering substituting the sour cream with cream cheese, as someone suggested, next time.  The sour cream added a flavor that I would prefer not be there for this dish.

Like a very moist cornbread...pretty good. I didn't expect my family to be that crazy about it, but they all told me to make it a repeater. Personally, I liked it better munching the cold leftovers.

Absolutely fabulous! My husband, who does not like corn bread, devoured this. It is so creamy! I added some jalepenos the second time to spice it up a bit.

I thought it was okay, a little too sweet. My husband and youngest son were not impressed. My older son seem to like this recipe, he ate about 3/4 of the pan. When I warmed it the second night I added some peppers and it was kind of like Mexican cornbread.

Made this one afternoon, just for something to do. It was nice because I had just about everything on hand. I did substitute Super Sweet White Corn (Frozen) for the whole kernal. I also added about 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar and a finely chopped bunch of green onions. I also substituted IMO Sour Cream Substitute for the sour cream. I really like the results. Even my 5 year old is enjoying it. Thanks for the recipe

This really is more like a souffle than a corn casserole. This was very heavy on the bread and also very sweet. It is a good recipe but was not what I expected. I had made homemade bread with this same meal and it was just too much bread overall. If I make this again it will be if I am not serving bread and also if I am making only a moderately sweet dessert. The family wanted to give it a 3 but the recipe did turn out so well, only our taste buds were at fault.

Awesome!  Definitely cut the cornbread mix in half and increase the amount of canned corns.  I added about 1/2 cup shredded cheese and it was great!

Very yummy.  A family favorite.  On holidays I make as is.  But for a everyday dinner side dish I cut back the butter/marg to 4 T and the sour cream to 1/2 cup.  Still taste yummy but not as rich.

This is one of the easiest recipes I have ever made in my life.  It was delicious!  I substituted Mexicorn, the kind that comes with green and red peppers, etc. for the regular corn.  Also, I used low fat sour cream.  This will become a regular at our dinner get togethers and holidays from now on.

It was very good (even got compliments from the in-laws!), but not as creamy as I expected.

I have made this recipe several times and it is wonderful! I planned on making this at my sisters house for Thanksgiving this year and when I got there I realized I forgot to bring the sour cream. Since all of the stores were closed we improvised and used cream cheese instead. It turned out perfect!. I get compliments on this recipe at family gatherings all of the time and it is so easy to make...just combine and bake!

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving, even the people who thought it sounded 'weird' when I told them about it went back for seconds. Followed the reciped exactly and it came out perfectly moist and delicious.

Great recipe, but needed a little something to jazz it up a bit. I added a little garlic powder. I think some green onions or cheese would also be great in it. I will definitely make this again. It got rave reviews from my inlaws so I know it's a keeper!

this couldn't be easier to make, but somehow I messed up the ingredients and used creamed corn only-still turned out delicious!!  The whole family loved it, and my two-year old asked for seconds..she thought it was cake!!

Absolutely amazing.  I made this last night for dinner and have been thinking about the left-overs all day at work.  I left this in the over for slightly longer than 1 hour because I wanted it less soggy in the middle.  It turned out well -- more like a souffle, less like a pudding.  I can't wait to make this with chili!

This would have been good if I didn't add the jalapenos.  This wasn't in the original recipe, but after many reviewers suggestions, I tried it.  I liked it, but the boyfriend didn't.  Perhaps if I chopped them super fine it wouldn't have been as hot?  Otherwise, a good recipe.

Easy recipe and pretty good but needs a little umph.  Used muffin mix instead of corn bread mix.  Got a bit confused when I wrote my shopping list as description says muffin mix but recipe calls for corn bread mix?  My two little kids did not like it but my husband and I did.

My husband is a big corn fan and he loved this.
It was so easy and I'm excited to have a new way
to prepare corn since we have it so often. Next
time I'm going to add some grated cheese however
it was great just by the recipe!!

This wasn't a bad recipe, but I think I just would have liked to have more flavor.  I made it for a company Party, but we haven't tried it yet.  If it goes quickly, maybe I'll come back and change the rating.  I think I'll try it again with honey cornbread or something spicy...good if you like corn but aren't very big on "rich" tastes.

This is the same exact recipe my mother's side of the family has been using for years!!!  Every holiday my aunt cooks up this corn casserole.  It's very easy and a nice twist when you're wanting corn, but not just the same plain 'ol ordinary corn.  When my mother makes it, she crumbles saltine crackers over the top.  I think either way is great.

Loved it!! Took it to four Thanksgiving dinners including a work potluck and got wonderful comments from absolutely everybody!!  I used margarine and fat free sourcream with excellent results.  Comments ranged from recipe requests to comparisons to tamale masa.  Thank you Ruthie!!

Can I give more than 5 stars? This is great. I have been making it for every family function for the last 3 years. My 5 year old eats it on its own. I add about a table spoon of finely chopped onions & sweet peppers combined and a shake of black pepper.

This really is a very good recipe.  The thing that keeps it from being a great recipe is just needs "something".  I've tried it twice since my first attempt with much better results. The first time I tried adding a bit of sugar for a sweeter version that was very good.  The second time I tried adding cheddar cheese and diced jalapeno peppers which was excellent.

We love this as written, but sometimes add sausage and finely chopped bell peppers. Cheese is also a good addition. My kids also  like it as a dessert with sugar added.

This was really great! I have the cookbook and got it out of there. I'm not crazy about cornbread, but I really liked this and so did my husband. I'm planning on bringing it to the next potluck dinner.

This was OK but I didn't think it earned the great reviews it got.  However, our dinner guests wanted the recipe.  I think it was too dry and cake-like.

Ruthie, you're a genious! I had a guest at my New Years Eve dinner who hates vegetables (fool!) except corn. I made this for him, thinking no one else would have much use for it. People went back for thirds, and were groaning afterwards because they were so full... but no one could resist! Awesome is the word!

The first time I made this it was too "corn"y, so the second time I left out the can of corn kernels and only used the creamed corn.  I think that tasted a lot better.

I expected to like this a lot more than I did, since corn and cornbread are some of my favorite things.
I think the sour cream killed the sweetness I was expecting.  
If I try this recipe again, I will decrease the sour cream and maybe add a little condensed milk.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving. I doubled the recipe and used a 9" x 13" (3 qt.) baking dish. It took at least an hour before it was golden brown on top. Although it did not turn out like a "corn pudding" as the recipe states, and more like a corn "bread" - it still was pretty good. I would probably make this again.

This was really gross. Pretty bland and anything but sweet. Corn fritters recipe from this site is WAY better. I will never make this again. Good thing I tested this before making it for Thanksgiving. That would have been embarassing!

This was really easy to make and quite a hit at a BBQ with college students.  The sour cream gave it a rich flavor, so I personally wouldn't be able to eat a lot of it at one time, but it was still delicious!  I also doubled the recipe, and my 9x13 dish was filled to the top!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  As a variation, try cutting back the sour cream to half-cup, and add 1 cup grated chedder cheese. Yum!

I was looking for a corn casserole recipe when I stumbled upon this one.  It was very easy to make and had a pleasant taste.  I would make this again but perhaps with a little less sour cream.

This is sort of like the corn mixer you get at Chevy's mexican restaurants.  A great hit for my family and friends.  I have served it lukewarm at a potluck and it's still great.  The butter makes it a little heavy on the calorie side!  I will make this over and over again.

This is great!  I make something like this all the time--although, I use 8 oz. of French Onion Chip dip instead of sour cream, and I'll add a cup or two of diced lean ham. Serve with a salad, and you have a great, simple meal!!!  :-)

This was so easy to make and so delicious.  I used fat free sour cream and light butter, and it didn't make one bit of difference in the taste.  I would recommend making this for company as a different corn bread dish.  My husband and son both loved it.

Absolutely the best veggie side I have tasted.  Excellent as is.  The only alteration I made was to use No-Fat Sour Cream -- didn't miss a thing except the fat.  Very good and easy to make.  I would recommend this at a Holiday meal as well.  Thanks for sharing!

I had a hard time finding Corn Bread mix and used Corn Fritter mix instead.

I found this to be very tasty but expected to be sweeter. So when I served this I put just a very small stream of honey over each serving as I plated up the dinner.

Easy to make and looks tempting; was very pretty coming out of the oven.  Couldn't find 8.5 oz. package of cornbread mix so I used a 6 oz. package and added 2 tablespoons of self-rising cornmeal.  Tasted like cornbread with corn in it.  I liked it OK, son and husband wouldn't eat it.

This recipe is GREAT!  Everyone loved it :)  I made it for the first time on Memorial Day and took it to a picnic without trying it.  I got rave reviews on it and requests for the recipe.  It is so easy to put together.  Thank you so much for the recipe!  It is going to be a regular thing with our family.

I fixed this recipe today and everyone loved it.  I am not a big fan of cream corn so I used more whole corn and it turned out GREAT!  Thanks.

I made this casserole for a Memorial Day get together.  I had no idea how it would come out.  Well, to my surprise...everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe..they noted how light it was and how it was sort of like a corn pudding.  Many Thanks..Excellent Recipe

This recipe was a little dry, I added monteray jack cheese to it to make it a little more moist.  Very good though!

I doubled this recipe for a recent family party.  The family couldn't say enough good about it.  I had some leftovers and the family had to split them up because so many wanted some. We laughed at this recipe as being an artery clogger, what with the butter, sour cream, and eggs, but it was a real hit. I imagine this recipe will become a tradition at future family gatherings.

I made this for Easter and Everyone loved it sooo much.. they asked to take some of the leftovers home with them.
Then I said I was making it for Mother's Day and they would say "GREAT! That was so good!" 

The kids also loved it.. even my picky 10 year-old-son.

This was very quick and easy but my casserole came out more like corn bread.  I will try less corn bread mix and more corn next time.  Overall it was pretty good!
