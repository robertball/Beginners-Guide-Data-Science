I make this recipe with brown rice already cooked and with 2% milk and it was so good that we ate the whold caserole.

This was remarkably good.  I had some mashed rutabaga's I had tried to make like mashed potatoes.  We did not like them at all--so I salvaged the mashed rutabagas with this recipe.  It worked wonderfully!  Very easy and very tasty!

Simply the best rutabaga recipe I've made yet.  The trick to rutabagas is to cook them halfway, drain the water, then replace liquid with a broth, finish cooking.  This removes the bitter flavor I find in rutabagas.  In addition, I added half an onion I had left over to the second half of cooking.  So with that method and substituting the dairy with coconut milk and dairy-free margarine, we have a winner.

I made this last night for dinner. It is a very tasty dish! My changes, I used fat free milk, instead of whole milk, and olive oil spread instead of butter.

this recipe was so good! just a hint of sweetness, with a nice earthiness from the rutabagas. took it to a holiday potluck tonight and everyone raved about it. made it with 1% milk, brown sugar instead of white sugar and 1 cup of short grain white rice leftover from dinner last night. super easy!

This was pretty good.  I used brown sugar instead of white, and used a package of Trader Joe's Frozen Organic Brown Rice.  Otherwise I actually followed the recipe!   My kids ate it (I sprinkled a little cinnamon-sugar on theirs and told them it was dessert :D) and my husband had seconds.  He ate his with Tabasco.  Rutabaga will never be my favorite thing, I think, but at least we tried it and now the CSA rutabaga that's been in my fridge for a few weeks is gone. :)

I made this for a potluck brunch at church. Everyone raved about it. I followed the recipe exactly except used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  However, I have to add that, if you've never used a rutabaga, it isn't that easy.  Best to microwave it for about 5 minutes on high to get it soft enough to cut into cubes, then you still have to boil it for about 20-30 minutes -- 10 minutes won't be enough.

This is certainly not a side dish for dinner!!!  I was considering putting some raisins in it and having it for dessert.  Its way to sweet. My kids woultn't eat it, and they're really not that fussy especially when it comes to rice!

My husband and I were surprised at how good it was. Only suggestions would be to cut back on the sugar. I will be making this again. 

Note: I used almond milk.

Love it. Never made or tasted rutabaga before this. What a great way to fall in love with rutabaga.

I prepared it as described and then cooked it on my outdoor grill. I was able to maintain the correct temperature by keeping a close eye on the grill gauge. Would I make it again outdoors? By all means.

This was great for our Potluck today - looked in the fridge last night and found a rutabaga, a little milk and butter, and some eggs, so I searched for Rutabaga on Allrecipes. Just before bedtime I cooked the rutabaga and some instant brown rice (separately) so they'd be ready to go this morning. When I got up I really didn't have enough time so I heated up all the ingredients to down on the baking time. As the oven was preheating I put the pot of rice in it, and the cooked rutabaga went in the microwave. I warmed the milk and other ingredients in a pot on the stove while I separated eggs and whipped the whites. Because I used a whole medium sized rutabaga, I doubled the recipe, and it turned out great - one dish for the potluck, and one for home!

This is an interesting dish. It's pretty sweet and could almost be a dessert. I thought it was a little too sweet for a side dish, but might consider doing it again with less sugar. I'm also intrigued by the comment about putting hot sauce on it. That might make it more savory and dinner-suitable. Otherwise, it was pretty easy to make and baked up perfectly. Smells real nice too.
