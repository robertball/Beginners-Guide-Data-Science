Oh wow was this yummy!  The night before, I put two chicken breasts in my crockpot and dumped the can of diced tomatoes over them, and set it to low.  In the morning, I added the onion.  About an hour before making dinner, I drained the chicken (reserving broth for another use).  Shredded it, and mixed with sour cream, green onion and chili powder.  Added cumin and garlic powder.  Then prepared as directed, except I didn't put the cheese on until the last 10 minutes.  The chicken was moist, tender and delicious!  We love tomatoes, and we loved this dish.

I recently made this dish for a party, and it was quite a hit!  I made a few minor modifications.  I used store bought enchilada sauce, as opposed to the sauce suggested here.  I also added a package of taco seasoning to the chicken and sour cream mixture instead of the spices listed.  Finally, instead of rolling individual enchiladas, I layered small corn tortillas, then the chicken mixture, then more corn tortillas and finished with cheese and enchilada sauce.  I am a vegetarian, so I did not try the dish, but it received rave reviews and was gone before I knew it!

So I brought this recipie to the church potluck.  One guy was complaining to me that "he doesn't like to try anything new" and that this dish looked suspicious (because of the olives on top). His wife browbeat him into trying it... and he RAVED about it and even went back for seconds! This is a great recipe; I really liked it.  I cooked the chicken in the crock pot all day while I was at work (just 3 frozen split chicken breasts and a cup of water) to avoid having to cook them at night, and then shredded the meat. Came out great! I also used mild salsa, because we don't like things too spicy. I'm definitely adding this to my rotation at home.

This was delicious!  I have been looking and looking for a red sauce type enchilada because the one I was making used Cream of Chicken Soup and it just wasn't very Mexicany.  After reading other reviews I made a few minor changes.  I didn't have green onions, but I sauted some regular onion in some butter and added it to the mixture instead.  I also added Cumin and garlic pepper to both the filling and the sauce.  I also added a little bit of cheese in the filling and used a mexican blend cheese on top.  It made a whole lot of filling and I was able to use 8 tortillas instead of 6 and probably could have used the whole 10 even.  I did double the sauce which I was glad I did because it wouldn't have been enough if I didn't.  I did't use any olives because I didn't have any and I can't stand them anyway.  I did drain my can of tomatoes and the enchiladas weren't soggy at all!  In fact DH said that the filling melded w/ the tortillas extremely well and this is the recipe he wants me to always use!  And believe me I sure will!  I can't wait for supper tonight to eat some more!

My son says 5 Stars all the way mom! He was surfing AR and found this and asked me to make it.  I was leary of all the tomatos, but it's excellent.  He is on his second plate right now.  I did half the recipe.  I ended up with 5 stuffed 10 inch tortillas.  I used a "full" recipe of sauce, so I recommend if you are doing a full recipe to double the sauce and make sure you cook it down so the flavors meld. I would add some more cheese if you do the "full" recipe.  I used the Rotel diced tomato/green chilis, lots more flavor.. also make sure you "drain" them, I am sure that is why some are ending up with soaky/watery.  I forgot to add that I cooked my chicken breast in skillet with cilantro flavored oil, after I flipped to second side to brown I then added some water to the skillet put a lid on and turned down to med and steamed it the rest of the way.  This chicken came out so moist and easy to shred for the recipe. Don't skip the olives and if you don't like your onion with a little crunch, then saute before hand.  Excellent!!  Thank you!!

Tasty dish.  I omitted the chopped tomato and baked the enchiladas sauceless for the first ten minutes to help with the sogginess problem.

this is excellent!  i used a pressure cooker for the chicken (35 min) added adobo and it shreds with a fork.  next time I either wont add the onions only because they stayed crunchy or ill precook them.  Also, I added more salsa to keep it moist.  great recipe

This is our new favorite enchilada recipe!  I didn't use the fresh tomato but subbed canned for it. I didn't find it too tomato-ey for my family the way some others did, but maybe we just like tomatoes.  I didn't cook the sauce, I just mixed it and spooned it over the top.  Then we covered it with foil and baked it the next day.  Perfect.  I'm making it again next week!

Very tasty dish.  Only thing I would change is the prep time.  Notice recipe ingredients say cooked chicken, so factor in the time it takes cook chicken.  Very good.

A great recipe that I use to dispose of extra chicken when I cook a whole bird. Delicious and fairly easy to make. I generally omit the 8oz can of tomato sauce, per some instructions I believe I read here. Overall a really good recipe.

My family loved it. I used chicken breast which I cut into fajita style strips and then cooked. I bought the already diced peeled tomatoes and added 1 small can of diced green chiles and little bit of fresh cilantro. Also I didn't have dried parsley so I added a dash of garlic powder w/parsley in it. Next time I might try it with corn tortilla's and skip the canned tomatoes, but it was good with them.

Very good! I will make this again.  I doubled the sauce after reading suggestions, and also to make my sauce-loving father happy, he even thought it was a bit too much, 1+1/2 would be perfect.  I also added 1 c. shredded cheddar to the filling mixture. Everyone loved it!

THis was delish and easy!  Only changes I made was that I used whole wheat tortillas.  I do think that it could use a little more sauce, but that is just me.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Great recipe (even despite all my substitutions)! Most important change: I used a whole 15 oz can of tomato sauce. 6 oz wouldn't have been enough. I had no sour cream and no green onions. Didn't miss the onions. For sour cream, I mixed (based on internet search): 1/4 cup powdered lowfat milk, 1/2 cup cold water, 3/4 cup cottage cheese, 2 Tbsp lemon juice, 1/4 tsp salt. I tasted that concoction and it was quite bad, tasting like 10-yr-old powdered milk. But I didn't tell my boyfriend that, just put it in anyway because I don't like to waste things! We also used a combination of flour tortillas, crispy taco shells, and tortilla chips (kind of an experiment), and determined that it could be easily made into a casserole if in a hurry, ingredients layered. The end result was delicious! It did not suffer one bit for the substitution/lack of sour cream. Really easy too! I've never made enchiladas but won't hesitate to use this same recipe with other meats. Thank you!

I must have done something wrong.  After reading the reviews the only thing I was concerned about was the sogginess.  So, I did leave the sauce off for the first 10 minutes of baking....but the flavor wasn't very good and they still came out very soggy.  I think I will try again to see if this was my blunder, thanks for the post all the same.

Wow, this turned out so much better than I ever expected it to.  To the filling, I added a couple of spoonfuls of canned, chopped jalapenos and some chopped olives.  I think next time I'll also add some cheese to the filling but that's just because I like my enchilada's really cheesy.  I didn't have any cooked chicken around so I took someone's suggestion here and cooked about a pound and 1/4 of chicken breast meat with some of the canned tomatoes and all of the chopped onions.  Turned out to be exactly 3 cups worth of chicken and it made the meat a little more tender in my opinion and melded the flavors together wonderfully.  My husband even took some of the leftovers to work the next day and he NEVER eats leftovers.  Ever.  Great recipe.  Will absolutely make this again.

This was good.  I slivered the chicken into bite size pieces.  I also would take the advice of one reviewer & use either the canned tomatoes or fresh tomato, but not both.

we really love this recipe, it didn't take too much time to make and tasted very good.I added some cheese to the stuffing and we topped the finished dish with a spoon of sour cream, oh I did not have celery on hand so I used some celery salt, because it also needed salt in the recipe, and it still turned out wonderful.
Thank you for your tastey recipe Sara.

feb.5,2003

My husbands speciality has always been making chicken enchiladas, now its mine!
This recipe was great, just one complaint, not enough sauce to pour overtop. : )   Definitely want them smothered with the wonderful sauce. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I turned this recipe into a vegetarian dish by using morning star crumbles and black beans as the filling.  Garlic and onion powder helped make this recipe more tasty and I used a can of the Rotelle diced tomatoes with green chilies to give it a little kick.  Great recipe, Thanks!

The only thing I would change in this is the tortillas.  Flour get kind of soggy, and well four tasting to me.  I used corn torillas and the soggy was gone.

This is a great recipe. I recommend making it once as the recipe says to do and then tasting it and making notes for what you want to add the next time you make it. 

I like using crushed tomatoes instead of the diced canned & the canned tomato sauce. It has a fresher taste. I use Chipotle salsa for the red sauce and it is unbelievable. I always make double the red sauce since the amount it calls for barely covers all the rolled up tortillas. One more red sauce recommendation: make the sauce the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight so the flavors can meld together. Makes a huge difference!

This recipe is simply FABULOUS.  I am huge Mexican and Cajun/Blackened foods lover and loved these enchiladas.  I did alter the recipe slightly in the following 2 ways: 1) I added extra chili powder along with Sylvia's "mmmm kissin' good" spice, and, 2) Added 2 squares of the best dark chocolate on the market, Green & Black's 70% chocolate, (available in your supermarket's specialty/organic foods section), to the sauce.  Regarding the sauce, I do feel that I needed to increase the sause quantity just a bit to really cover all 8 enchiladas in the pan.   Enjoy!

A bit soggy but tasty.  Added jalepenos on top to add spice.  I think fresh cilantro would add to the flavour.

I thought it may be too "tomato-y" when I read the recipe, and I was right.  It was very soupy and didn't get favorable review from my family.

This had very good flavor but turned out a bit soupy.  I think I'll leave out the canned tomatoes next time and use fresh chopped maybe.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but next time will buy the smaller tortillas.  Mine were too large and the enchiladas were huge!  I reheated for work the next day and it tasted as good, if not better reheated.

Pretty good. I used the 'Red Enchilada Sauce' and added 2 jalapenos, most in the sauce, and a little bit in the filling, and the HOT Mexican-style chili powder but it still wasn't spicy enough. I also thought it had too much tomato in it. I might omit the canned diced tomato or fresh diced tomato next time. I also shredded most of a 10oz Cracker Barrel Sharp Cheddar and put a tiny bit inside each tortilla, but next time I'd try a shredded bag of Mexican cheese.

This was really good! Very close to what I normally make but I've always used the packets for the sauce. It was nice making the sauce from scratch. This was a very easy recipe. While I was cooking the chicken I was making the sauces, it all timed out pretty well.

Ok so I really changed this up but used as a base. I saute'd green pepper, onion and garlic in olive oil, shredded my chicken which I boiled with garlic in the water, mixed together with half can of diced tomatoes and half cup cheddar cheese, and half pack of taco seasoning- flour tortillas and canned enchilada sauce, Mexican blend cheese and olives on top . Was absolutely amazing!

This is my go-to recipe for enchiladas. I sub corn tortillas (more authentic and gluten-free) and leave out the fresh tomato and olives. I add bell peppers to the chicken mixture.  This recipe makes much more than 4 servings--more like 8 (hence, half the calories posted).

mmm, very good!  Absolutely loved it.   Although I found the tomato sauce quite strong on top, so I will use pasta sauce instead of the tomato sauce unless someone can recommend a sauce that isn't so strong.  I am a tomato lover, so that was a surprise to me.  Thanks for posting!

YUM!  These were soooo good!!!  I'm so excited I finally found a wonderful enchilada recipe.  I've tried so many and have never found one I love.  I thought the tomato sauce would be weird, but it was so much better than canned enchilada sauce! The only thing I really changed was subtracting olives and adding a little cumin to the sour cream mix.  Can't wait to make these again!

We love this recipe. Instead of folding the tortillas into enchiladas, I layer them lasagna style. I use canned diced tomatoes for the filling and store bought canned enchilada sauce for the top. I combine all the spices, most of the cheese, and the chicken to the filling. I lay down a layer of tortillas, put down some filling, and continue layering until I finish the tortillas. I pour the enchilada sauce on the top and move around the tortillas to ensure some of it makes it way down the layers. I finish it all off with a final layer of cheese and bake. Be aware, if using corn tortillas, you need to up the liquid content of the sauce, as they will absorb all the liquid and leave the filling dry.

We loved this recipe! Made a few changes...added seasoning to chicken, and canned tomatoes had cilantro and peppers in it. I also drained some of the juice before mixing it and it wasn't soggy at all. Oh, and I used Enchalada sauce instead of tomato sauce. Definately a keeper!

This was a HUGE hit! I did change a few things - I shredded the chicken, and I also layered like a lasagna. I also added refried beans & olives to the layers. This will be a keeper on the meal "rotation"!! Yum!

This is a good base recipe, but needs a little tinkering, I think. It was pretty easy to make and certainly tasted fine, but was fairly bland. When I make it again, I will experiment with the seasonings to see if I can kick it up a notch! Still, a good, solid easy recipe. Thanks!

Very tasty.  I used whole wheat tortillas and low fat sour cream and thought that it still tasted great. I made my own Enchilada Sauce (from this site) and served it with black beans and rice. Husband and 18 month old daughter loved it.

This was awesome! I miscalculated and had too much chicken mixture and took a phone call, so my salsa mixture cooked way, way down. I combined the mixtures and spread that over the top. I also didn't have the green onions, so I just chopped up a medium sized onion. I loved this--definitely a keeper!

My kids said "Daddy this is a do over".  I stuck to the basic recipe with a few adjustments.  Firstly, I used salsa in the mixture instead of making my own.  Also, I added cumin and garlic salt to the mixture.  Secondly, instead of individually stuffed tortillas, I layered it like lasagna, one layer of tortillas then the mixture, then another layer of tortillas.  Lastly, upon previous reccomendations, I doubled the topping ingredients and added the cheese with 10 minutes left in the oven.  Definitely a do over!!

Made some changes and now rate this six stars. Cooked leg meat in garlic,spices,and a little chicken broth. Ommited chile powder and tomato from the sauce and added at least half a cup of chicken broth for moisture. Used white cheddar and Cotija cheese. Dont like to much chile powder so dumped in a little taco sauce.  I baked some of it and prefer the part I cooked covered in the microwave.  All cooking of this recipe could be done in the microwave which keeps it saucy. Used Mexican onions(look like very large scallions), so you can see I stopped at a Mexican grocery to get some of the ingredients.

2 thumbs up!  Definately would make this again.  Next time I might leave out the onions, however....they turned out a little crunchy.

this recipe was way too moist, especially as leftovers.  at first it was good because it was so different, but after a few bites the novelty wore off.

Great recipe!  This is the first Enchilada recipe I've ever tried--I did add jalapenos bcause we like 'em hot--but left the sauce off for the kids, except the cheese and olives. Rave reviews from everybody!

This recipe was awesome!!  The only change I made was that I had forgotten to drain the tomatoes so I left the fresh tomatoe out.  It was PERFECT!!  Definately a recipe I will use over and over again.

This recipe is a keeper! I didn't have green onions, so I used additional white onions. It takes some time to prepare, but it's worth it.

This dish surprised me.  I thought it would be too heavy on tomatoes.  I find it to taste pretty good and the sour cream and chicken seemed to mitigate all of the tomato-based ingredients.  Worthy to make again, but not a 5-star in my book.

This is great!  I didn't change a thing...didn't need to!  I always use Tyson chicken... it never comes out dry no matter what you do to it.  I always see reviews that complain about chicken being dry and they blame it on the recipe...it's not the recipe...it's the chicken!  Anyway, wonderful recipe!

I made this recipe at my apt. and brought leftovers to college (USM in Hattiesburg, MS) the next day for lunch- all of my teachers came out of their offices while I was heating it up in the microwave because it smelled so good. I told them where I got the recipe from and the entire Medical Technology dept had it by the end of the afternoon. Even my grandmother who is the best cook I know asked for the recipe!  It's awesome!

Great recipe! It took no time to fix and tasted great. I did however make a few changes.  I cooked the chicken, onion and raw tomatoes together.  The flavors seemed to blend better that way.  The only thing I'll do different next time is add more spice, it was kind of bland for my family.  This is definately a keeper!

This was a real hit in our home - definitely a keeper! I used 2 tsp. of taco seasoning mix instead of chili powder and that worked very well. I would also use diced tomatoes instead of chopping the whole tomatoes.

YUM!!  I made this for friends the other night and they kept asking where I got the recipe.  One modification I made was I used the "Mexican" style shredded cheese blend instead of just cheddar, and it was great!  I also didn't have any parsley so I left it out- still tasted great to me.

I thought this was great.  I actually skipped the tomato sauce and just used the salsa on top.  It just seemed like too much tomato for me.  But even without the tomato sauce I thought it was fantastic!  A great thing to prepare ahead of time.

This was easy and great! Instead of all the spices I simply added taco seasoning. I also used low fat everything and whole wheat tortillas. It still has calories due to the cheese and a few minor other ingredients but the yummy factor was worth it!!! I used store bought enchilada sauce and added a bit of low fat cream cheese and salsa for the sauce.  Delicious!!

Hubby and I LOVED this recipe! I used Rotel's Mexican Tomatoes (included lemon and cilantro), drained in place of the diced tomatoes. I think next time I'll leave the sour cream on the side, but that's just my personal preference, I really don't like sour cream. This will be on regular rotation at our house.

I thought, as many others here, that this was a good launching point for some more complexly flavored enchiladas.  In the filling, I added black beans, frozen corn from my garden, 1-2 tsp. cumin, 3-4 tsp. chili powder, and another couple handfuls of shredded cheddar cheese.  For the sauce, I used 1/2 jar of hot green chile sauce (El Pinto) and 1/2 jar of homemade salsa. I spread a little of this sauce on the bottom of the pans before I put the enchiladas in.  Baked them covered for 35 mins at 400, then 10 mins more uncovered at 350. Sprinkled with cilantro to make them taste fresher!

Sorry to say, my family didn't like this one.  We prefer the white cream sauce chicken enchiladas over this one.  Need to also make sure to season the chicken.  I boiled a whole chicken for this one, but didn't season it.

DELICIOUS! I halfed the recipe and added 1/2 can of drained black beans for flavor/color to the chicken mixture. Also, I did not have green onions but added a can of drained chopped green chilies instead. Made enough for 6 enchiladas. Will definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing.

This is a very good recipe I have been using for quite a long time by now.  It is true that it sometimes turns a bit soaky but it is still very good tasting and my husband loves it.  I also add beans to it, always.  Thank you for sharing.

With all the five star reviews, I expected something more. It was very bland. This was definitely missing something. It didn't have enough cheese for my family's tastes, and the enchiladas were soupy. I won't make this again.

Great tasting recipe but it tasted like it was missing something, maybe some more seasoning or something spicy. I will definitely make this again but I think I'll add some more pepper to it.

Not bad, but not great either. I followed some suggestions of previous reviewers, and it was still bland. I might try it again with some more tinkering.

This recipe is delicious!  Although I have to modify for some people in my family (some don't like tomatoes or onion), I use this recipe often.

I use this recipe all the time! It is a good starter. I changed it some. Like adding cumin and garlic to both the sauce and the mixture. And adding more teaspoons of the other spices. I also never use flour tortillas. Corn is much better. Cheese in the mixture is also really good!! And I shred the chicken to absorb more spices. A lot of work but worth it in the end

Mmm, this was a good recipe.  I thought it would be a bit too much tomato, but it actually came out very, very nice.

I thought this was awesome and so easy to make!  I added extra green onion and next time may try using canned diced tomatoes instead of dicing canned tomatoes.  My husband has asked for this all week long!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome!  gawd, this is good!  
soggy tortillas aren't a problem if u eat it like a casserole with a fork...sort of like lasagna.  also, it's easy just to boil chix breasts while you cut up the rest of the items.
variations on this are seemingly endless depending upon type of salsa, veggies, cheeses, meats used.

Wow! This is really good! I seasoned the cooked chicken with Southwestern seasoning and salt. I also sauteed the onion in cooking spray. Since some people complained of sogginess, I made sure that no excess liquid was in the tomatoes. I threw in green chilis as well. This was so yummy! I'm putting it in my meal rotation, because you can really lighten it by using lowfat sour cream and cheese.

Love this recipe.  I have made it over and over and we don't get tired of it.  I have made it with chicken and also with cooked ground beef and it was as delicious.  Have not had a problem with sogginess however I keep some of the sauce to add in the last 10 minutes of baking.

Maybe I was expecting too much from this recipe, but it wasn't a big hit here. The flavour was a bit bland, and the tortillas got very soggy. Having said that, it was very easy to put together.

I made these for a party for 40 people. I did them in a roaster - don't think that I would do that again. They were better done in a 13 x 9 in the oven. I made the chicken mixture the day before, that worked well. They were a hit at the party! Many requested the recipe.

This recipe was a HUGE HIT w/my husband!  He LOVED it!  My only issue is that I don't think it's tangy enough.  Maybe I'll try adding a bit of cumin or something next time.  Otherwise, it's superb!

Very easy and very delicious! I didn't cook the chicken before hand so I skillet cooked it and chopped it up real fine. I didn't have the fresh tomato or olives, and I used diced canned tomatoes instead of whole, it still worked great. Not a real Mexican tasting dish, but good and satisfying none the less!

The recipe was just okay. I wouldn't make it again. This was very American casserole - bland except for lots of chili seasoning, but not melding of flavors. The flavors were not very authentic although it sounded interesting, so I tried it.  A really authentic tasting one in comparison is Gerry's Chicken Enchiladas, which I also found at this website.

As a noveau cook, I've been praying for SOMETHING I cook to be a PERSONAL request of his...((smiles))This was grrreaat and easy to make, too!

Real easy, quick, yummy.  Only complaint is that the tortillas got soggy underneath.  Also I don't think it's necessary to used canned tomatoes AND fresh.  
I'd recommend it.   :)

This is a great recipe and I will definitely make this again. I added a little extra chili powder. The only suggestion I might add is to lightly brown the tortillas before baking. The tortillas were slightly soggy.

Great dish!  I prefer corn tortillas and layered them like lasagne. Also recommend shredding chicken instead of cubing it. Also needs salt. 
I will definitely make this again.

This is an excellent, tasty and quick meal, in the instructions it says to add one can of diced tomatoes, disregard this and just add the diced tomato.

This has a good flavor which we enjoyed.  It was not that fast to prepare when you have to pre-cook the chicken, chop it, then prepare the mixture and the sauce mix then bake.  Also, one ingredient is missing from the ingredient list which is included in the written instructions, but not the amount to use.  There are only two of us, so we had enough for two meals. We will try this again.

I doubled the canned tomatoes and skipped the fresh. I think it would have been good with a can of green chilies or a can of diced tomatoes with chilies. I used 7 tortillas and I should have done 8. It was chicken-heavy in 7.

I made this recipe and changed it up a bit.  I used ziti instead of tortillas and I also added ricotta cooked the peppers onions and chicken.  In another pan added all the tomatoe and all the seasonings, anchilada sause.  then added the chicken mix, sour cream ricotta cheese.  layered the ziti and sause then cheddar cheese.  So yummy!!

This was delicious!  I didn't use olives, as we don't care for them. I also added black beans in with the chicken and some cumin for additional flavor. Definitely will be on our rotation for dinner. Thanks!

Very easy and a delicious combo.  It does take some time and some dishes, but it is worth it.  I made a half batch--there's only two of us.  I also subbed ground turkey for the chicken.  I made the turkey the night before and then assembled the enchiladas and made the sauce today.  It would be easy to make the sauce ahead of time, as well.  I couldn't find olives, so just topped with cheese.  I missed the olives but bf didn't (he hates them).  I added a bit more salsa to the sauce and it was a perfect amount.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an odd recipe.  It is eatable but doesn't taste like enchiladas.  The tomato taste is overpowering and there is hardly any cheese.

Very good!!  I've used this recipe since 2002.  My boyfriend doesn't like sour cream, so I made it without it last time, and it was still pretty good (the mixture was just not as thick).

I had been looking for a red sauce enchilada recipe and this one is great! I added some shredded cheese to the filling and sauteed the onions with some garlic in butter before adding it to the filling. This was great! I would maybe add a little bit more chili powder to the sauce next time (my husband said it was too much like straight tomato sauce). Otherwise very good! Re-heated in oven well too!

I changed the recipe a bit so I could use what I had on hand.  I used a can of Italian tomatoes, and I think this probably made it sweeter.  I also used a drained can of chopped petite tomatoes in place of a fresh tomato (I will try using a real tomato next time.).  I sauteed the onion and a clove of garlic with my chopped chicken.  I also used light sour cream, and I added a drained 4oz. can of chiles, not that it added much kick (maybe I'll try Rotel next time?).  I didn't have any green onions or olives.  I love cheese, so I had to add a whole lot more on top (and a little in the filling).  I ended up laying the tortillas out on the bottom, pouring the soupy chicken mixture over, and then adding the rest of the tortillas on top, before adding the sauce (for which I used a 6oz. can of tomato sauce and 1 cup salsa), and finally the cheese (12 oz.?).  It was tasty, and I'll make it again, trying a few more tweaks!

I liked the sauce a lot but didn't care for the actual enchilada. I thought the tomatoes were overpowering and that there was not a lot of other flavor.  The sauce on top was really good though so I will be using that again.

I made this lowering the fat and calories. I omitted the sour cream and used low fat cottage cheese blended in the food processor w/ 2 Tbsp of chili powder (we like it spicy). I added 1/2 a drained can of Rotel, reserving the juice and the other 1/2 for the sauce. I forgot to add the fresh tomato in there, but I added 2 in the sauce. I forgot other spices, plus I added another Tbsp of chili powder to the sauce. I used whole wheat tortillas, topped w/ low fat monteray jack (but not a whole lot) during the last 10 minutes in the oven. No black olives...we don't like them and they are too salty. I served this w/ fat free black refried beans and steamed broccoli topped w/ salsa. This wasn't tex-mex like I'm used to, but it was a healthy fix to my mexican food craving!

What a great and easy recipe! I did add some salt for taste in the filling. Otherwise I kept everything the same. I did find that it only made and fit 4 tortillas in a 9x13. This was plenty of food though for my husband and I. I could barely even eat one. It made for great left-overs.

This is going in my recipe box. My only modifications were using some fajita mix instead of the other seasonings except chili powder. I used it but not as much as was called for and using garden veggie spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. This is all I had and it seemed to give more flavor to the dish. My tortillas weren't soggy but were soft and soaked up the sauce just right. Definitely a keeper!

Tasty. I like the tomatoes mixed in with the filling. I mixed some shredded cheddar into the filling and also sprinkled some on top during the last 10 minutes of baking. I used a package of taco seasoning in the sauce, in lieu of the seasonings called for in the recipe..

This was a nice dish.  I'd have rated it a four but my family all gave it a five and I was overruled.  I did make a few changes, though.  I used enchilada sauce rather than tomato sauce, and after I had sauteed the chicken for a few minutes, I simmered it in the sauce.  Then I removed the chicken with a slotted spoon and added it to the sour cream mixture.  Also, I was too tired to roll the enchiladas so I tore my tortillas into strips and just layered everything.
Again, an excellent weeknight meal, thanks for sharing.

This is yummy. I served it to 20 teachers and all of them wanted the recipe.  I served it to 20 more people with the same result.  It's a nice change from the "creamy" variety.

Fantastic - the kids love it.  It is a good dish for busy weeks - I make the chicken mixture on the weekend and then the kids can put it altogether and put in the oven whilst I am on my way home from work.  Great way of getting them interested in cooking

This was okay, it tasted kind of bland to me, but my husband liked it.  I drained the canned tomatoes due to some of the other reviews saying their tortillas were soggy.  It turned out great.  The only other thing I did different was leave out the green onions because I didn't have any on hand.  That might have given it more flavor.  I probably won't make them again, but it was nice to have something new to try.

This dish was so good and very easy to make. I didn't have everything on hand so I used dried minced onions, dried chives and tomato paste diluted with water and it was fantastic. This is a good one to use for your leftover roasted chicken. I couldn't believe how easy it was to make, and it was even better the second day!

This recipe has become a staple in my house.  It a bit of work, especially if you start with raw chicken and have to cook it but very good.  Be careful to spread the sauce on evenly as I have had the ends get dry on me in the past.

Awesome!  I made this pretty much as written with the exception of adding extra cheese on top and more chicken.  This is a recipe that you can really experiment with to suit your own tastes.

This was quite good and easy although with raw chicken breasts to cook and dice, it took much longer than I expected.  I grilled chicken breasts rubbed with olive oil and McCormick's Montreal Seasoning in the George Foreman grill.  Diced up the chicken meat that was very juicy and delicious as is and then followed the recipe.  I thought the top sauce could use more volume.  A small can of tomato sauce and a half cup of salsa was just barely enough.  Next time I'll add more sauce.  I also seasoned with Italian Seasoning along the way.

I didn't have much time to make this so I bought a precooked chicken at the market and just shredded it. Used diced tomatoes with garlic instead of the whole peeled tomatoes.  This was very yummy.

I did not have a can of tomatoes so I used fresh tomatoes. Would have been even better with the canned tomatoes because it was a little dry.

These were very good but, like some other reviewers, I didn't like the soggy tortillas.  I will make them again though and bake them without the sauce for a while and that might help.

Excellent!  I make this dish for my family a couple of times a month.  It's an easy recipe to increase the number of servings & add different things to (such as green chiles or green onions)! Delicious!

Very good, everyone loved it! I added rice to the mixture because Im not a big meat eater and it seemed like it was mostly meat. There was plenty of flavor. I will definately make this again.

I've made this twice now, and it was a huge hit both times!  I used Italian style diced tomatoes the second time because I was short on time.  My husband was the envy of his office with leftovers, and my girlfriends all wanted the recipe!

my family was not thrilled with this recipe.  It didn't have a lot of flavor and it had too much of a tomato flavor.  Also, it did not make enough sauce to pour over the enchilada's.

Wonderful.  My first time trying this recipe and it came out great! ^-^ I thought it would be too much tomato, but, it came out just fine.  The prep time was good, and not being a master chef myself, it was easy for me to handle! ^-^  I did have a little bit of problem getting the tortillas to stay closed but I think that was my own fault ^^ A little butter solved that!  Wonderful, I'll use it again!! ^-^

I used this recipe in my cooking class at work.  I have a cooking class at a mental health center and have to have recipes that can be completed in 2 hours and can be upscaled to 45 people.  This recipe worked very well.  It was very good and my students really enjoyed the preparation.
