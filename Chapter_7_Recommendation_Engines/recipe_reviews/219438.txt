Very good and easy. But why oh why does someone change the recipe leaving out the soup and then give it a low rating.

This is the best pot roast I have ever had. I did add only 1 can of soup and also 1 can of water to lighten it up. I am thrilled at how easy and fantastic it was!

I make this recipe without mushroom soup at all and it is less fattening. Use beef broth instead of mushroom soup or just water.

Delicious and healthy with the vegetables added. I wanted to comment that Cream of Mushroom Soup is not that fattening in the overall ratio of the recipe ingredients, (do the math) especially if Campbell's Healthy version is used.

Followed to a T, was delish, however food for thought, cut the red potatoes, they took the longest to cook. Simple and easy and tasted just wonderful.

I love having all the vegetables in the same pot as the roast! I need to remember to salt the individual veggies next time. I cooked the roast on high for 4 hours, using Campbell's Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom Soup and the diced onions. Then I added the rest of the veggies. I did cut the small red potatoes in half and just cut strips of carrots rather than slicing them. The mixture cooked another 5 hours, making a total of 9 hours on high. Delicious and easy!

We added garlic cloves and skipped the beans. Cut the potatoes into long quarters, just like my Mom did when I was young, and put everything thing in at once. 8 hours on low and didn't need a knife to eat it. Will definitely make this again.

I should have reviewed this a long time ago. I found this recipe here about two years ago and have probably made it ten times. My family loves it and the left overs are even great the day after. I use a 32 oz. container of Imagine portobello mushroom creamy soup and I usually dice up two cloves of garlic and mix it in with the onions and soup. This is so easy to make. 10 minutes prep and set the crock pot for 8 hours on low and walk away. A perfect dinner

Gave 4 stars because I have not yet tried making pot roast this way, but we are a pot roast family and will definitely try it. Just a tip with slow cookers, layer the food for optimum cooking, placing the hardest food items on the bottom and working your way up, potatoes on bottom, carrots on top of the potatoes, then the meat, etc. I also give my slow cooker insert a light spray of cooking spray for easy cleanup. Will try adding a healthy version of Mushroom soup as suggested here,  anything with mushroom soup sounds good to me!

I love this. People compliment me every time I make it. I honestly didn't think creme of mushroom soup was any good until I made it in this recipe.

I was worried this might lack flavor but it turned out absolutely fabulous and delicious! I mixed the 2 cans of cream of mushroom with 2 cups of unsalted beef stock, 2 teaspoons of minced garlic, and some pepper. I put the veggies and meat in the crockpot and then poured the mixture over top. I also added about a cup of chopped celery for some extra variety. It was so good I had a hard time keeping myself from getting seconds. I’ll definitely be making this again!

This turned out amazing. I’m only giving it 4 stars because it makes no sense adding the extra things later. Just put it all together in the crock pot and let it do it’s thing! The only thing I did differently was omit the green beans since my family is not a fan, and used only one can of mushroom soup and one can of water. Awesome recipe!

Super easy to make.  I did not use the cream soup, only beef broth.  It turned out to be a lighter version of a pot roast recipe, which is good even in this hot weather.

I used one can of soup, 1 pound of roast, and the same amount of veggies. Just to make it even healthier. Tasted good, though it does need s &p. Normally I leave those out.

My better half and I are trying to eat better and work out this year. Dena found this recipe so we decided to give it a whirl. This was so easy to make. We definitely needed to add salt and pepper to taste.
