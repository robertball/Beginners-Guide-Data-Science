this recipe is great. i got it from my mother-in-law, who has been making it for several years. when i got it from her, she had a slightly different version. i don't know if they were the instructions she recieved or if she changed it. i tried her version. she mixes cream cheese with ranch dressing, instead of sour cream dill and garlic powder. also, we add whichever veggies are to our liking: broccoli, cauliflower, red, green and yellow peppers, carrot strips, mushrooms ect....

This is a great, easy appetizer or snack. I have always used dry ranch or dry italian dressing instead of the dill weed. I just like a more powerful flavor which either of those lend to the pizza. I also chop up a bit of radish, cauliflower and broccoli for my pizza. Its always a hit no matter what you top it with.

I've actually had this recipe for over 10 years and it is always a big hit at parties. Everyone is always asking for the recipe. Don't use fresh dill as it will be too harsh.

An inexpensive appetizer recipe. This is much better and more attractive if the vegetables used are julienned.

This recipe is a classic. It's so versatile, just add the veggies you like. Today I prepared this by shaping the cresent rolls into a Christmas tree and topped with carrots, celery, and green olives as ornaments. Then I sprinkled on cheese and topped with parsley. Tasted great, and was gobbled up in no time!

This is a great appetizer that everyone always loves at parties.  I usually bake the crescent roll crust on a baking sheet, so I can cut the pizza into squares and serve easily.  I also just mix in a packet of dry Ranch dressing into the cream cheese/sour cream mixture which is a great flavor.  You can mix up any kind of veggies you like for the topping, which is great.

A million ways to modify, depending on your whimsy of the day, this pizza is light and very tasty. I especially like the sauce, as it was tangy and different, and I'm not a huge fan of red or traditional pizza sauce.

I add a little celery seed and ranch dressing to the cream cheese mixture.    Also, I've found that celery and cucumbers, if chopped very finely at least, tend to lose their color if left overnight.  They still taste fine, but aren't very attractive.

I believe mine is the same exact recipe and WE LOVE IT!!!!!!, We like orange or red peppers on it too, it's fun because you can switch it up and mix it up.  A sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese is good too!  : )

Excellent! Great for parties and showers! I've made this several times and always get compliments! I use broccoli tomatoes and cucumbers mostly, as I am not a carrot person, but you really could use any fresh veggies you want!

I made a half recipe of this, only using one can of reduced fat crescent roll dough and halving the sour cream and cream cheese BUT I kept all the other amounts the same. I did increase the garlic powder and I added onion powder, chopped chives, a little basil and oregano and some fresh ground pepper. Because I had one to use, I also added one finely chopped red pepper in with the other veggies. This was simple and I was able to make it early this morning so I wouldn't have to cook tonight when it was at it's hottest. NO leftovers.

Loved this.  I used Marzetti's Light Dill Ranch Dip instead of the sour cream & dill.  I also added diced red peppers and celery and topped with a sprinkle of grated chedder cheese.  It was fabulous!

A huge hit at parties! I like using the ranch dry packets rather than the dill. I've made it both ways and people seem to like both.

The first time my mom made this I would not try it.  Everyone enjoyed it.  So, when everyone was outside I tried it and couldn't stop eating what was left.  Make it your own and add the vegetables you like.  I really enjoy it with parmesan cheese.

Guess I'm the odd one out....too much cream cheese taste for me...not enough veggies.  I made as is....would probably have like it with the ranch dressing mix I saw recommded in previous reviews.

My first time ever making this kind of pizza and it was really good. I tweeked the recipe a little bit by adding some grated cheese on top and then a tiny drizzle of ranch dressing. Next time I will experiment with maybe some peppers and onions for a little flavor kick.

Very tasty but I would serve this as an appetizer instead of a main meal.

These are AMAZING! TIP- if you are using this as an appetizer cut the dough into smaller portions before baking. Then you won't have to worry about messing it up when you cut it to serve.  And to change it up, I used cooked zucchini instead of cucumber. Everyone loved them!

This is pretty close to the veggie pizza appetizer I've always made but there are a few differences. I prefer my crescent roll dough to be cooked at 350 for only 12 minutes. Let cool completely. For the ranch sauce, I mix about 1 cup sour cream with 4 oz cream cheese with a dry ranch seasoning packet. Top with a colby jack cheese mix, and add any cold veggies you choose: my choices include sliced cucumber, carrots, broccoli, tomato, & sliced black olives.
