About 30 years ago, I was watching a cooking show where they were making salad dressing.  They said that if you added mustard, it would act like a binder between the oil and vinegar.  They said you could always use lemon juice, too.  Since then, mustard is always added.  It doesn't take much. I prefer my dressing more 1:1 ratio of oil and vinegar.  Also, if you use garlic powder instead of fresh and leave out the shallot, you can leave the dressing out on the counter, so if you are using olive oil, you don't have to wait for it to "melt."  I always have some made and ready on the counter, and it is wonderful.

Hi!  This is my recipe and I want to let you know that I only use a really good quality balsamic for this which tends to be sweet.  If you do use a  lesser quality vinegar you may need to add a little more honey.  It still turns out great!

I'm not typically a fan of balsamic vinegar, but I did like this dressing. Neither overly sweet nor overly tangy, tho' I did adjust the oil and vinegar to the 3:1 ratio I prefer.

This is incredible. I made this early this morning so it would have time to set before dinner. I did increase the garlic but that's really a matter of personal taste. I think this would be really good with some chopped fresh basil.

FABULOUS!!!! I made a grilled romaine lettuce salad with roasted yellow & red cherry tomatoes, roasted red pepper and topped with feta, with this dressing on the side. Our main dish was Korean Beef scewers w/rice noodles (300 CALORIES) that my neighbor made......it was a perfect combo and caloric wise.....approx 450-ish TOTAL! I will make this dressing forever!!!!   I didn't have shallots so I subbed with a oinch of onion powder.....Did the trick! THANKS!!!!!

The first words out of my daughter’s mouth were “This is really great dressing, where did you get it?”  When I told her I got it on AR, she immediately wanted the recipe.  This dressing had the perfect combination of flavors for us.  We loved it. If you don’t have a high quality balsamic vinegar, I recommend adding a little extra honey to compensate for it.

Excellent dressing! It went perfectly with some of my favorite salad ingredients: romaine, spinach, bleu cheese, sunflower nuts and craisins. I will be making this again!

OMG-This is grrreat!! I made the dressing last night but didn't use it until this evening with a spring mix salad I prepared myself with fresh veggies. I could taste the sweetness of the honey & the mellow flavour of aged balsamic vinegar with every bite.  The best part is that it wasn't necessary to shake the jar again after the first time I shook it 28 HOURS earlier! This is by far the best balsamic vinaigrette I've ever made because it's not oily or tangy, and it doesn't separate after sitting for a day in the refrigerator. I absolutely LOVED IT!!!

This makes a very tasty vinaigrette.  I needed to increase the honey a little to get the right flavor balance.  Great as written, but a nice variation is to add some sun dried tomatoes with a big pinch of oregano and basil to the basic recipe.

I made a small batch of this to serve with Spring Delight Salad, also from this site.  It was very good!  I had to improvise a bit, based on what I had on hand.  I didn’t have a shallot so I used finely minced green onions and I used Pomegranate Balsamic vinegar.  I did think it was just a bit too tart, so I added a little more honey to balance the flavors.

This was my first attempt at homemade salad dressing.  I followed the recipe as stated, using a higher quality balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  It was excellent!  It's smooth and tangy-sweet.  The ingredients blend nicely and complement the balsamic flavor perfectly.  This one is definitely a keeper.

This dressing is THE BEST.. all you need to add is a good squeeze or 2 of lemon and it is the best dressing in the world!  I also substitute onion salt instead of regular salt and I don't add shallot.

We really enjoy this as written but think you might like to double the honey amount.  The next time I made it, I picked fresh herbs of rosemary, basil, and thyme and blended it with an extra clove of garlic in this recipe.  This went over even better than the original and my salad hating kids ate without their usual groaning. I think this recipe lends itself to versatility with fresh herb additions.  Either way-it's a great balsamic vinaigrette.

Yum! Thanks for this recipe. The only thing I did differently was using white balsamic. Delish, and the perfect amounts! Thank you for sharing.

I absolutely love this simple, easy to make dressing. I used it for my mixed baby greens salad with dried cranberries, walnuts, and gorgonzola cheese. It was perfect. I've also reduced the balsamic vinegar (simmered 1/2 cup until it was 1/4 cup, about 15 minutes), which mellowed the flavor of the vinegar.

Really changed my attitude about eating salad as a meal! Salad to me has always meant bland, boring, unsatisfying diet food. This has made it a delightful supper to look forward to. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I did not have the shallots so I omitted them. If this is your case too then this will still be delicious but a word of warning, the vinegar flavor is very strong! I thoroughly enjoyed it but added about 1/8 to 1/4 cup more olive oil in order to make it palatable for the rest of my family. The honey and mustard are perfect flavors, thanks for the recipe!!!

I'm trying this with the freeze dried shallot from world market. Just let it set in the vinegar for a few minutes and then proceed. Excellent I used my top shelf balsamic and a very good evoo from my local small market.

This is THE BEST vinaigrette I have found and believe me, I have searched and searched.  I have the most finicky hubby.  He does not like ANY dressing on his salad, but tonight he slathered this dressing on his salad.  We also had a guest for dinner, and he said this was the best salad dressing he has had.  He was dipping the bread in the remaining dressing, and said this is restaurant quality.
Thank you for this fabulous recipe Mattsbelly!!

Good and plenty tart.  Another recipe had equal amounts of oil and vinegar.  I can't imagine how tart that would be!  I did not have a shallot, so I used finely minced onion, and it tasted fine.

love this vinaigrette! Use it all the time, I even put a bit of it on the porkchops I had and it was great! I didn't have honey so I replaced it with brown sugar and it was still tasty, once I get a grill I plan on using this as a marinade.

Really love this vinaigrette, it's got the perfect balance of flavors for my tastes. I enjoyed this over a simple garden salad of lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, and green peppers.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I don't leave many reviews, but this is probably the most-used recipe I have found on this site.  I have made probably hundreds of different recipes from Allrecipes, but this is the only one I use all of the time.   I don't change a thing except that I use minced garlic from a jar to save time and it is the PERFECT dressing!  Our favorite way to top the salad is walnut pieces, craisins, diced apple and feta.   I could eat that salad every day!  I am always ecstatic when I find a knock-out recipe that includes all healthy good-for-you ingredients as well!

Awesome as is, no changes necessary.  I double the recipe and mix this in a pint size mason jar and keep it in the fridge, ready-to-go.  This is our go-to salad dressing.

Love it!! The only change I made was to leave out the shallot because I didn't have any. I also didn't even know what it was. Anyways, the dressing was still great without it. I eat fresh salads every day and I don't like using store-bought dressings because of all the preservatives and stuff added to them.
This dressing is healthy and delicious!! Thanks for sharing:)

The original recipe is too oil-based, in my opinion! It tasted more like I was pouring straight-up balsamic-infused olive oil on my salad.  Luckily, it was quite easy to modify to my tastes.

This is similar to a secret recipe I was given a few years ago. The other recipe was made in a blender and rarely separated, so I threw the ingredients in a blender. I added 1/8c more of balsamic vinegar. I bought expensive aged balsamic vinegar, premium olive oil and premium fresh local honey. I also added 1more Clive of garlic as suggested by another reviewer. It’s so good. I can tell it will be a go too recipe.

Lovely simple recipe, I usually skip the shallots because I never have any in. I use the juice of a lemon not mustard and a 1 - 1 ratio for the most part. Thanks for sharing :-)

It was AMAZINGLY GOOD!  We had to take a luncheon 2 hours away and made a Mexican feast and a fresh, light salad.  20 people out of 20,  raved about the salad.  I did follow the recipe to the letter and got rave reviews!  (I did double the recipe and grated the fresh shallot and fresh garlic)

I have a salad almost every day for my lunch and love to try new dressings.  This was absolutely delicious.  I used Emeril's Horseradish Mustard (which I love) and cut the olive oil a bit.  A hit in my book.

So simple and delicious. I had it over a spinach salad with pecans, craisins, red onion, and blue cheese. I added a bit more honey for my taste and used the 3:1 oil to vinegar ratio. Thanks MATTSBELLY! UPDATE: Used garlic and onion powder as I didn't want to deal with the real thing. Still came out good. This time used a good quality white balsamic. Delicious!

I love this dressing.  I liked the fact that it was less "oily" than a lot of dressings.  I used a good quality balsamic vinegar, and both my husband and I thought it was delicious. When it ran out, I used some "store bought" Balsamic Vinaigrette I had on hand and actually said "Yuk" when I ate it.  Needless to say, I'll be making another batch of this dressing very soon.  The first time I made it, I didn't have any shallots, so I left those out and it was still delicious.

I was looking for a dressing that tasted like the public market dressing I love so much.  Most store-bought balsamic dressings are so oily and no flavor.  Found this and followed the recipe exactly and it tasted great!  I will never buy another store-made bottle again.  You definitely need to use a high quality balsamic for this to taste great.  It stayed mixed even after a day of sitting.

This recipe was so easy to put together and was very good.  I didn't have a shallot so I mixed in some minced onions.  Just the perfect amount of tart and sweet.

Good vinaigrette. Will save this recipe for future reference, but will be trying other recipes first to compare. Wasn't really "wow" worthy for us, but added a delicious kick to our salad.

Use a good quality balsamic (3 leaf) and leave out the honey.  Also added a pinch of oregano and basil.

I didn't make any changes except lowering the amount of olive oil to 1/4 and I left out the shallot since we didn't have any. This  dressing was very good- very sweet, but I enjoyed it. Definitely will make again!

I add the salt and pepper, to taste,  to the salad directly instead of putting them in the dressing.  After I emulsify, I often add a little more olive oil and emulsify it because the dressing is very thick.  This is our favorite dressing!!  You must use a high quality balsamic vinegar.

Amazing recipe. I added a dollop  of almond butter to give it a creamy texture. Served it over a bed of arugula and baby spinach and goat cheese medaillons. If I had had any I would have added fresh figs as the finishing touch. Mmmmmmm

Awesome!  I used a spicy mustard and added more red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  Overall taste is excellent though.  Make sure to let the flavors blend for 30 minutes or overnight.

This was lovely, simple, classic. Alas, the home was without shallots, so I had to excuse their absence from the final production, but, it was very good, a sort of template for all vinaigrettes.

Didn't change a thing except perhaps a titch more honey.  Delicious.  I will NEVER buy balsamic dressing again.  Used fresh greens, red onion, pralined pecans, and blue cheese crumble.  FABULOUS!  Thank you!

Love this recipe, I add a few shakes of Italian seasoning and use the “light taste” olive oil

You can use minced onion instead of shallots also can replace Honey with 1tsp of sugar per 8 servings.

Enjoy! :)

This is really good, per the reviews I used spices vs fresh shallot and garlic.  I added some cayenne pepper and used monk fruit extract extract vs honey to keep it as low carb as possible.  I never knew mustard was a binding agent between the oil and vinegar.  The texture is thick and cream.  Perfect recipe!

Nice balance of sweet and tangy, although to me the flavor is pretty subtle overall. I used red onion bc that’s what I had, and about double the garlic.

This is a great basic recipe!  A hack I have discovered is to use an AeroLatte to emulsify the oil with the other liquids.  It is fun to do and totally mixes up the ingredients without separation.  It is only good for small batches and does not work with thicker dressings.

So quick, easy and flavorful. I prefer agave nectar to honey though. I will use this recipe frequently.

I didn't have the ingredients to make a greek dressing but wanted something to go on my salad with feta cheese. This was an easy recipe I could make with ingredients I had on hand, and I didn't have to pull out my blender. As I had read in one of the reviews, I upped the olive oil and prefer it that way. I swapped regular mustard for the Dijon and thinly sliced red onion for the shallot. I used pink himilayan salt.

SO, SO good. Great balance of sweet and tangy. I crave this on a salad daily now. Easy to make and you are not eating all the preservatives and extra junk that is in store dressings. Very good!!

This dressing is Delicious.  I did add more of the garlic and I used Coleman's powdered mustard because I did not have Dijon mustard on hand. I increased the garlic and mustard by 1/2tbs.

I recently made this recipe, and although it tasted really good, it thickened the next day.  Is this normal or does this need to be used up immediately after mixing it?

My family loves this recipe.  It is the only vinaigrette that we eat.

I chop the garlic quite large and let the emulsion marinate, then take out the garlic for long storage safety.  Same with the shallot.

Yummy!

Really tasty. We prefer more of 1 to 1 with the oil and vinegar.  Tried both and the family liked the 1 to 1 with a medium grade balsamic ($12 for 8.5oz) better than the written recipe. Still giving it 5 stars for the base recipe I would have never tried. Oh, used powdered garlic and fresh,,

Be careful what you use this on.  The shallots are very strong and overwhelmed my mild-flavored salad.  I'm guessing it would be better on a salad that already has onions in it, though.

I made this but didnt have dejon or shallots so I used yellow mustard and minced white onion. It wasnt as tangy as it would have been with the dejon but my bf loved it! It really does hold together well.

I made this recipe because I ran out of my balsamic vinaigrette and that’s one of the only dressings I like in my salad. I made this recipe and it turned out great! I also added 1 tsp of sweet & spicy honey mustard, used dried minced onion since I didn’t have a shallot and added my favorite The Melting Pot garlic & wine seasoning that I love! It came out perfect! I’ll definitely be making this again!

6.2.18 Scaled this down to two servings today for a luncheon salad to see if we liked it.  We did, so I’ll make the full recipe next time.  Quick and easy to make, savory with just  a whisper of the honey giving it that little bit of sweetness.

I have to make my own when I can't find or afford Annie's Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing! I can easily adapt this one leaving out onion & garlic! I'm deathly allergic to those!

Wonderful flavor and consistency. Didn't have shallots tho I doubt they will be missed. Used a 16 yr old balsamic vinegar which I believe makes a difference. We both love it. Thanks for the recipe.

This vinaigrette was really tasty.  I did not have a shallot so I subbed the white part of a green onion. Also added a bit more honey to my taste.  Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Made 1/2 of the recipe for the 2 of us and it was just enough for 2 small dinner salads.  Used 25 yr. old aged balsamic vinegar which I'm sure added to the ability to give it 5 stars.

Excellent basic vinaigrette. Some sites, with similar recipes, recommend to refrigerate the vinaigrette others don’t.

not being a big vinaigrette fan, I found it OK. To me it was a little strong. Maybe I would like it with a little sweeter. I bet it would be great as a marinate and I may try it that way.

Loved it!  I didn't have shallots on hand so I used about 2 tablespoons of finely chopped  vidalia onion instead.    I poured it onto  a mixed spring greens, feta cheese with chopped pecans ... it was nicely sweet and tangy.    The portion size was perfect ... makes 3 to 4 good size salads...   for fear of it going bad.   Will make again and again!

I was looking for a good basic vinaigrette to keep on hand and this is it! We eat lots of salads and have tired of store bought dressings. I made the dressing exactly as the recipe indicated the first time and it was a huge hit! I now double it and add a bit more garlic than listed. We love it!

I didn't have shallots. It was an instant hit with my family and probably the best vinaigrette I've ever had. I used 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper.

I always taste my vinaigrette before adding the "big" flavors (garlic, ...), and this was just bland, bland, bland. I dumped in some red wine vinegar, about 3 Tbsp, plus another 2 Tbsp of sugar, to save the day, and it turned out fine, but as is, this recipe is definitely not anything to write home about.

I debated 5 stars. It's probably a great example of a balsamic vinaigrette. But when I tasted it, it needed... something. I added a half teaspoon (maybe a little more) of Hungarian paprika and that made it 5 stars in my book. A bit extra warmth, heat and tang was what this recipe needed. I will make it again.

This is such a great vinaigrette.  I threw it in the blender to completely emulsify and it has a slightly creamy appearance.  Served over baby spinach with strawberries, feta and slightly candied slivered almonds.  Yum!

Delicious!  Used Popeye's Maui Onion spice (coconut palm sugar, salt, pepper already in it) instead of honey, salt, pepper.  Used garlic and garlic chives from the garden.

I'm not a salad person so take this with a grain of salt! I guess it was ok...too vinegary for me - needs more work than I care to do to get it to my taste.  My daughter - who actually made it for a corn and bean salad - did adjust some ingredients to try to improve the taste and she may make it again.  I'll stick with a bottled tomato vinaigrette.

My first time making homemade dressing. I am allergic to raw shallots and onion, so o used 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder. This was really good!

Addictive.  I wisk before adding the shallot and garlic.  It won't separate at all if you do that and gets a nice velvety texture.

So fast and simple to throw together, and it's as delicious as my favorite dressing at a local restaurant. For my family's taste, I added a teaspoon each of dried oregano and thyme. I also used agave instead of honey since we are vegan. This will definitely go into the 'often used' category!

Delicious!   Followed one suggestion to use garlic powder and onion powder so will keep longer.  Served  over salad made with baby kale, red onion slices, raspberries, grapes,  blue cheese, candied pecans, dried cranberries.  Will definitely make again.

I hate mustard so I was skeptical but this is great. I always change the vinegar/oil ratios in vinaigrettes to add more vinegar and I left out the shallots because I didn't have any. The second time I reduced the honey by half. I may remove it altogether next time.

Pretty basic but good. I used a little less EVOO to make a little healthier.  Next time I would maybe use Stevia instead of honey.

As written,  it was a bit acidic for my taste. . I added 2 teaspoonsful of honey rather than one teaspoonful, and the issue was remedied.

I will never buy salad dressing again!  I made two small changes:  I used garlic salt instead of a garlic clove, and I used about a tsp of Agave because I didn't have any honey.  Seriously - this was shockingly delicious!

Love this recipe although I did made a few tweaks since I didn't have all the ingredients at hand. I used garlic powder instead of the clove and just a regular mustard and left the shallots out since I didn't have any still turned out great. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! So easy to make and tastes much fresher than pre-made stuff. I skipped the shallot and it still tasted great.

I make this dressing quite frequently for my husband and me. It was this recipe that converted my husband to balsamic vinaigrette. We love it on salads, sandwiches, wraps, pasta...almost anything!

I made this exactly as written, using high quality EVOO and balsamic vinegar. For the dijon I used Grey Poupon Country Dijon.  After shaking like crazy, this was rich, stuck to every leaf, and a perfect accompaniment to the Pork, Pear, and Walnut salad on this site.
Using it next on mesclun.

This dressing is fantastic! I love balsamic vinaigrette but wanted a variation to the basic dressing - made only half of the recipe but it was still a decent portion. I found that it tasted better each day as the vinegar flavour continued to soak into the onion. Will definitely be keeping a jar handy at all times.

I made this as was and it was great.  I had everything but shallots so I minced onions and a scallion or two and managed. Easy to make and tasted good on a few different salads. I'd make this again with shallot and see which I prefer.

This is a great recipe! I've made it twice now, and it's so simple and delicious. I poured it over greens with: raisins, quinoa, shredded carrots, cheese, peanuts, cucumber, kidney beans, and garbanzo beans (it's a funky mix, but a good one!) Thanks for sharing this!

I  substituted mustard for Dijon mustard because I didn't have any of the latter and had to add more honey because of the too strong flavor. Basically, it just was too strong as I prefer a more light flavor for my dressings. Perhaps if one added fruit juice or something similar to water down the taste a bit, I would have enjoyed it more. As is, it may be that the only reason I personally didn't prefer it is because I substituted mustard for Dijon.

This recipe has worked great for me! I usually use a table spoon of raw honey and I've tried spicy brown mustard and Dijon mustard. The Dijon works best for my tastes. I usually make double batches in a pyrex  measuring cup and put it in the microwave till it is warm which helps the raw honey mix. A red onion also works if you don't have a shallot. 
Thanks!

This has become my go to balsamic dressing.  Love it on baby spinach and mixed greens both!  Thrilled that it lasts refrigerated for a few days and that it isn't loaded with sugar is a big plus for me.  Plus it only takes a few minutes to put together.  I make all my salad dressings from scratch.  They are just better that way.  Plus this can be tweaked for your pallet easily, I love it as is, husband likes it on the sweeter side and I've even added fresh bacon bits chopped on the fine side for a rare treat.  This is definitely one you can't go wrong with.  Thank you for sharing.

I may never buy store bought vinaigrette again, even though I buy a "healthy" store brand. This can be whipped up fresh in a matter of minutes and most people likely have everything they will need to make it on hand! We are fans and will be making this again!

As with most recipes, the more simple.....the better.  Using a high quality olive oil and balsamic are the key. I used Castad Oro olive oil and Aceto Balsamico Di Modena balsamic. Belissimo.

I leave out the chives, since we don't like them, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I make this on a regular basis. It's restaurant quality and way better than any bottled dressing we have tried. Very simple and quick to make too!

I think it was good. Next time I'll make it in advance to sort of let the flavors come together more. I didn't have dijon mustard so I used regular yellow and it was fine.

I love it, my family loves it, and my daughter who doesn't like to try anything new LOVES it. 
I made only 1 change (twice). I used cherry balsamic vinegar, gave it a really great flavor. The second time, I added fresh raspberries in lieu of the cherry vinegar.
This recipe didn't need improvement, I just like to play around.

An excellent salad dressing and wonderfully easy to make. I used some balsamic vinegar my friend brought me from Italy, a bit better grade than what you find in a grocery store. Really did the trick, I think.

Excellent recipe!  Good quality balsamic means the dressing will last longer since the flavor is more intense.

So much better than store bought dressing! I admit I tweaked it a little, but this base idea is perfect.  I did a half and half mix with the balsamic and oil. Only used half a shallot and squeezed in half a lemon. I am in love with this stuff! (Oh and since I am vegan I used 2 tsp of coconut sugar in place of the honey, worked fine)

Amazing.  This is now my "go to" salad dressing and there is nothing not to love about it.  I totally agree, a top notch balsamic dressing is imperative.  I added more vinegar than olive oil, only to cut some calories.  My company loved it and asked immediately for the recipe.

Thank you MATTSBELLY!

I was out of my favorite brand of balsamic dressing and rushed to AR for a quick fix.  This recipe was very good.  I did not have shallots on hand though-so left them out.  I should have added onion powder because I did feel like it needed onion.  I like the suggestion from the reviewer who mentioned using garlic powder and onion powder instead of fresh garlic and shallots so that it does not need to be refrigerated.  I might try that variation next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy and simple ingredients that I have in the house all the time. I have made at least 10 batches of this (mostly double each time).  It is delicious and something I can eat every day. Thank you for a great recipe!

Quick and easy -- a simple balsamic vinaigrette that comes together in minutes.  I didn't add any salt or pepper and didn't think it needed any.  Also, didn't use a fresh shallot, but substituted some onion juice.  Delicious!

This makes a beautiful balsamic vinaigrette -- but I must say that the type of balsamic vinegar you use completely defines the dressing. I used a very watery store brand the first time I made it, and had to add almost double the honey to get rid of the excessive acidity. It turned out nice though. The second time I made it, I used a very high quality syrupy aged balsamic and the difference was like night and day. Even with just the called for amount of honey it was more than sweet enough. It was lovely and needed to use very little to lightly toss with mixed greens and make a very flavorful salad.

Fabulous and simple.  I was never able to find a store bought dressing this good! I make this dressing all the time, never get tired of it.  I usually don't add shallot because I don't have it available and I reduce the amount of oil and increase the vinegar in order to make it lighter in fat, still tastes great, less calories.

I altered this a bit based on the reviews, and it came out really well. I'm not a fan of dijon mustard personally, so I wonder if there's something else I might substitute to keep it from separating, but otherwise this was very good.

Let me confess that I love balsamic vinegar and could slurp it with a straw!  That said, I used a Costco balsamic vinegar (not my higher end standard), and I found the dressing to have too much pucker factor.  Perhaps with a different brand of vinegar it would have been fine?  To compensate I added about 2 tablespoons of mayonnaise.  That mellowed the whole thing out and made for a wonderful consistency.  I think I'd do that again with any brand of balsamic.

Even though the reviews were excellent, I was still a bit skeptical.  I am not a fan of Balsamic Vinaigrette of any kind, well, until now.  This dressing is absolutely fantastic.  I brought it to our friend's home for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit!!!!  I highly recommend it.

I made this recipe and loved it! I also used a high quality balsamic that I purchase at Olive U Naturally in Prescott Az! It's an 18 year Balsamic and very yummy! Wouldn't change a thing about this one! It's a keeper! Thanks MATTSBELLY!

I made it as written last night and enjoyed it, but ended up adding more vinegar to my salad because it wasn't tangy enough. I prefer my salads to be more flavorful, so today I halved the oil but kept everything else the same. Came out perfect for me. I put blueberries on my salad, and that contrasted the sour vinegar really well.

Excellent recipe!  I hate buying bottled dressing, so I love coming across a recipe that's so easy and fast to put together and tastes AMAZING!  I did not have a shallot on hand and was mixing it up in a hurry so I used granulated garlic instead of fresh and a pinch of onion powder - delicious!  I can't wait to make this again, only try the fresh garlic in it.  This would also make a great marinade for chicken.

It needed to be a little sweeter, so I added about 2 teaspoons of brown sugar.  Now it's a 5 star rating.

Love this recipe, it fresh vibrant, sweet and tangy.  Best part is you know whats in  it, no package of things I can't pronounce in my dressing.  The first time we tried it my sister had this fantastic balsamic vinegar from a winery and the dressing was dreamy.  The 2nd time I made it, I used what looked like decent balsamic from Safeway and it was unedible.  Moral of the story is when one ingredient is star in a recipe, use good stuff.  This also is great for caprese.

Love love love this! Super easy to make and I had most of these ingredients on hand. I followed exact recipe the first time and turned out wonderful! The second time I couldn't find shallots so I used a purple onion and it still was amazing! I would definitely recommend making this, if only to soak up into your bread and make a meal out of that!

Great recipe and a favorite in my home.. salad everynight and most requested dressing. That said I did add more flavor by only increasing the flavor ingredients. .Honey, dijon mustard , garlic , shallots and I use McCormick's great "Mediterranean Seasoning" in and on the actual salad..its great on MANY THINGS! This dressing is also a really good marinade for chicken overnight and then grilled ! Try it !! Thank you for the recipe! !!

Went through the fridge today looking for some salad dressing, of course the last of every bottle had expired by a few weeks which I will not touch.
Hopped on this site and found this recipe, Whoo my luck I had every ingredient except the shallots. This is the BEST dressing ever! Thank you! 
Poured it over some fresh Mozz pearls, grape tomatoes and a bit iceberg. Mmmm!

Very well done.  Such a great salad dressing to have on hand.  Flavors blend well, I keep it in the fridge in a squeeze jar like ketchup comes in at the restaurant.  So handy so have

I scaled it down for a single serving and left out the garlic since I didn't have any at the time. Quick, easy, and tasty. Perfect for weekday salad lunches!

I thought this was a good recipe but a little bland.  Like another reviewer I ended up with 1 to 1 oil to vinegar. I also put in a little Worcestershire sauce to pick it up a little and switched the mustard to one with a little more flavor

Delicious!  Easily cuts in half.  I did not have a shallot so I omitted it.  I also did not measure the honey, so I might have added about 1/2 tsp more.  Served on a salad of mixed greens, chopped pear, slivered almonds, and feta cheese.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Great dressing and exactly what I enjoy having available! I followed the recipe but used an immersion blender and drizzled the olive oil in last to emulsify it so it would continually stay mixed. Because it ended up a bit thick, I added a bit of water to desired consistency. I did use a quality balsamic I buy at a specialty store. Thanks, Mattsbelly!

Wow! This was really good, I made it ahead of time so it can set and be cold with dinner, but I just tried some and it was fantastic! I was amazed at how thick it got! It will go great with my balsamic marinaded steaks :)

I loved it, but... I did modify it a bit to suit my own tastes. Balsamic vinegar can vary so much and the one I have right now is kind of strong and raw tasting, so I reduced it by half and subbed balsamic glaze for the rest. It is probably a bit sweeter because of that, but I wanted it to be sweet because I was dressing an avocado, spinach and watermelon salad (with walnuts, which sounds really crazy, but it was awesome, and I do credit this dressing as being part of it's success.) Also, I did not use the shallots because the ones I bought were so strong that chopping just one of them had the tears streaming down my face much worse than if I had chopped a regular yellow onion. SO, I just used elephant garlic and added a little onion powder. It was yummy! :)

Didn't have any honey but used a honey dijon mustard. Instead of shaking I used a blender to get the dressing emulsified to a creamier texture. Very good!

Great with spinach, apples, and candied walnuts. I was in a rush and used garlic salt instead if garlic and salt and still turned out very tasty. Will definitely make again and again.

This is the first salad dressing I have ever made and I followed the recipe exactly. It had a light flavor that was not too tart or sweet. I served it with a side salad for dinner, and my husband and I both agree that it was good but not great. Will probably try modifications next time to take it from good to great.
