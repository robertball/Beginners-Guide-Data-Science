Absolutely delish! My husband kept snitching the chicken out of the pan. I subbed in plain yogurt for the mayo because I don't like the taste or texture of mayo, but didn't change anything else. This will go on my list of summer menus.

Really good. I think next time I might try a different milder salsa or increase the honey as it was barely discernable. I used sauted broccoli slaw intead of spinach because I wanted to freeze these - which worked out well, by the way. I just popped them into my lunch bag with a small container of the sauce and nuked at lunch

Simply delicious!I halved the recipe since there was only three of us eating, I had a three grilled chicken breast from the night before so I was able to prepare this in very little time, I used whole wheat tortillas and lettuce instead of spinach(that's what I had) other than that followed the recipe exactly. When done they looked delicious and tasted delicious. Thanks for sumitting your recipe! Something that we will be making often, especially during the summer.

Wow, this was unexpectedly good! My husband came in the door and asked, "What is that delicious smell?" and he made me promise to make this again soon. It was super easy and a nice change from my boring old chicken recipes. Thanks!

This was very tasty, and I especially loved the combo of cucumber, honey, mayo and cayenne. Brilliant! The chicken was missing something - maybe some cheese would be good? Maybe some cilantro? Anyway, it was a good meal and we both enjoyed it, and I'll definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

10 STARS! Holy moly, this was so fabulous for such a simple recipe. These wraps are to die for and will DEFINITELY be on our menu again and again. For the salsa, I used Pace Thick 'n Chunky Medium salsa. Used whole wheat wraps instead of tortillas and we loved them, loved them, loved them! What a delightful, perfect, fantastic combination of flavors! Nuclear Rich wasn't kidding when he promised to rock our taste buds. Wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for the awesome recipe! :)

Very good! I had some chicken already cooked, so I just shredded that and proceeded with the recipe. LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the mayo/cucumber sauce, and felt that it really made the wrap extra good. I cut the cayenne pepper down to 1/4 tsp. in the sauce and that was plenty of heat for me. I also omitted it fron the chicken itself, because I used hot salsa, but may add some in next time. I added some shredded cheddar to the wrap as well. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are pretty spicy, but so good! Don't change a thing, and it's no big deal if you don't have cucumber.

So good I made this twice in one day!  I made this for lunch today and I followed the recipe exactly except I downsized it to a portion for one.  I liked it so much I decided to make it for our dinner with one major change.  I replaced the chicken with FISH.  This recipe made great fish tacos!!!  I added some avocado and cheddar cheese on top and served it in corn tortillas.  AWWWESOME (in a sing song voice).  In the fish version I cut the cayenne pepper in half since I was planning on feeding it to my 9mth old.  It still had a nice bite but it was not as hot as the original.  My husband and 9mth old both really enjoyed it.

I give this 4 stars as, minus the mayo/cucumber sauce, it's rather ordinary and the recipe, in my opinion, is way too light on the delicious sauce. I would definitely make them again but increase the mayonnaise mixture by double and really slather it on. I made another wrap for lunch the next day with the bit of leftover chicken there was, added more of the sauce, and that one was knockout delicious. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

These were a hassle to make.  They honey was a pain and would not mix with the dressing.

My kids loved this, but it was too spicy for my husband. Go figure! We'll definitely make this regularly. Loved the sweet with spicy, and the mayo cuts the spice, so it just had a great kick to it. We had way too much sauce tho. Will probably make 1/2 the sauce next time. On a scale of 1 to 5 my 10-year old gave it a "10!"

I thought this was a good base but I will probably make some alterations if I make it again. The honey wasn't very noticeable. I think I may add a little  more in the future. Also, I think it would be better with sour cream as a base for the sauce. That's just my preference. It was good, as is, but I think the coolness of the sour cream would be great to balance out all the cayenne. This recipe has a lot of versatility.. the meat mixture would be a great switch from your usual taco meat or to throw on top of a salad.

This was OK at best, bland, maybe some mustard mixed with mayo, maybe some cheese and cilantro, I don't really know. Definitely needs some experimenting though.

These were excellent!  I halved the recipe and it was enough for 4 small burritos.  The flavors go so well together.  The first couple bites I just had to savor the flavors, sweet than spicy.  We had them for dinner, but I think we will keep them as a lunch for next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had high hopes for these when I started cooking them due to the high reviews.  As I made each part (sauce then chicken), I was tasting them individually and thinking "hmm... just kind of ho-hum."  But somehow it all came together in burrito magic and tasted AWESOME.  I grated my cuke rather than chopping because it just seemed faster, and that way I was able to squeeze a lot of the excess water out, which was good because these wraps were super messy and drippy!  The only other thing that I would try next time is perhaps using shredded chicken from a crockpot or something as my chicken was kind of tough by the time it cooked so long.  Other than that, flavors were incredible, spicy and hit the spot!  Too spicy for the kids, but we loved 'em.  Hubby wanted cheese on his second one, but I only had room for one, so I'll try cheese on mine next time too. Thanks Rich!

I followed the directions almost exactly.... I used 1/2 light mayonnaise & half fat-free sour cream for the sauce to try and lower the fat content a smidge and added extra cucumber to it.  The cayenne can be altered because it is a bit spicy but our family loves spicy so, for us, it was good.  I also added a tiny amount of reduced fat cheddar to each wrap. My oldest hasn't been wanting to eat much lately... told me he only wanted a small one and ended up eating 3 in the end!!! Yum :)

Spicey Spicey SPICEY!  These were good, but next time I think I will scale down the cayenne pepper b/c it was very overwhelming.  We added sliced avocado to our wraps.  I would also like to try this with sour cream in place of the mayo.  **My hubby took a left over wrap to work the next day.  Said it was even better cold!**

Easy, yummy, healthy.  A great, quick, weeknight dinner. My husband said he likes it for the flavor and healthiness. Everyone ate it up, even my picky eaters.  I told the kids it was going to be like a Wendy's wrap, which excited them; but they said it was way better than Wendy's :). I've made it once wiht 1 tsp cayenne pepper, and once with less... 1 tsp is way too much for us. It makes it really spicy! Adjust to your liking.

I made this for supper and it was really good, but too hot. I will cut back on the pepper next time. My two sons were chugging milk! I think that using the medium salsa in the chicken is enough hotness where the cucumber sauce already has 1/2 tsp of pepper. Other than that, I'll definitely make this again!

This was delicious.  I had no idea this combination of ingredients would go together so well, and it was quick to make, which was perfect for a weeknight dinner.  Used 8 inch tortillas, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Great spice level.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I loved how easy yet flavorful this recipe is. Great combo of spicy and sweet.  I didn't have spinach so I used lettuce instead and it gave it a nice crunch. Made for a great lunch.

WOW this was amazing, quick and easy.  I added mexican shredded cheese on top of the chicken, used lowfat mayo, southwest salsa and a baby romaine blend.  I will definitely be making this again!

DH made these for me.  Very tasty and easy enough he had no problem.  I think I’d like yogurt instead of mayo for the spread by that’s just my preference (DH isn’t the biggest yogurt fan so he thought they were great as is).

I altered the recipe slightly (i didn't have salsa) So I mixed together Frank's Red Hot, some tomatoes, some onions, red peppers, some red chili pepper and some cumin. Added that mixture in place of the salsa.    Other than that I followed the recipe and it was simple, quick, and absolutely delicious, thank you.

I make this on a regular basis.  It's so good and simple.  I love how unique the flavor it is.  It's nice to be able to do something different with chicken.

This is a great summer recipe since it requires little cooking!  I really enjoyed the refreshing taste of the dressing.  I added white rice and cheese to the wraps but otherwise followed the recipe.  It makes a nice dinner.

This was really good for how simple it is.  I've made it as is, and also made just the chicken.  I then topped it with some coleslaw with tomatoes and red onion mixed in.  Delicious!

These were yummy.  I made them slightly different based on the ingredients we had on hand.  Instead of mayo I used plain yogurt and instead of cucumber I used zucchini.  The chicken by itself was okay but boring.  However, with the sauce, delicious.  Even my picky husband, who dislikes most sauces, really liked these.

Too spicey! Not bad overall but I will throw out that sauce and start over with a tiny bit of the cayenne pepper. It was so over powering that the kids who are fussy could not eat.

Very tasty!  First though, I cut out a lot of fat by subbing Greek yogurt for the mayonnaise. Didn't have cucumbers, but I did have broccoli so I used that.  I also added some red bell pepper, red onion, and a half can of white kidney beans that I had on hand to the chicken and it turned out VERY delish.

A wonderful, easy, tasty recipe.  My entire family thought it was a great change of pace for a different tasting wrap.  I added slightly more honey and cayenne.  For the dressing, I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  Delicious.  Next time I'm going to try substituting Greek yogurt.

I really enjoyed the combination of flavors.  Especially the chicken mixture.  Next time,  I would reduce the cayenne pepper to a mininal, it was too overpowering for my tastebuds.  Overall good.

This was simple and good.  I did make a wrap but then made a bed of spinach, topped with the chicken and crushed a few tortilla chips on top.  Drizzed with the cucumber dressing and ate it as a salad.  I liked it much better this way. Very quick to whip together.  I'll be making this again.

These had a really interesting flavor.  It was a nice change of pace from the regular chicken wrap.  It was quick and easy.  I think I'd try substituting sour cream for the mayo next time.  I did skip the cayenne since I was serving it to the kids and the salsa I used was already on the spicy side.

AS I typically do, I followed the recipe exactly the first time ....... it was just OK. Next time I think I will double the sauce and add a few more veggies - like julienned carrots and celery or perhaps some lemongrass.

Good and somewhat healthy!  double the recipe and change the tortillas to Wheat wraps.  This worked out as a cold wrap better than a warm one.  As a cold wrap, the mayo does not liquefy.  And add extra spinach for a nice crunch.

These were FANTABULOUS!   Warning: Instead of serving them as a wrap, they morphed into burritos.   Did not use the honey! My family doesn't like anything sweet in Mexican food...unless it dessert! Chicken—I sliced into 2-3” pieces about 3/4 thick. I used mild Pace Picante sauce as I didn’t have salsa on hand, and omitted the second 1/2 tsp of cayenne—it was PLENTY hot and spicy! While sautéing the chicken, I heated a large cast iron skillet and kept it on low heat.  When it was time to warm the tortillas I put them in the skillet and warmed them one at a time. Next, I followed the directions for filling and folding the tortilla, adding some grated cheddar, and poured some of the remaining mayo/cucumber sauce down the middle before folding. Instead of serving them as a wrap I turned up the heat on my skillet to medium, put a very thin layer of butter on the surface and then put as many filled tortillas as would fit, in the skillet. Then, I covered it with a lid and let it cook until the burritos were golden brown on each side—took about 5 minutes. Careful not to use to high a heat.  Served the burritos with a side cottage cheese/cucumber/tomato/red onion salad. YUMMY doesn’t describe this meal!  Oh, and one more thing. There will be excess sauce that the chicken is sautéed in. I saved that to put on the top of the burritos when served.  Hope you try it—you won’t be disappointed! Promise...

I'm not sure why my reviews are being edited considering my opinions are always fair and non judgmental. Some recipes are winners and some aren't. So, here's my second attempt at writing an HONEST review. Aside from all of the glowing reviews, I did not care for this at all. I personally felt the cayenne was overpowering, at least in the sauce (the heat level was spot on, but cayenne was all I could taste). I also think the cook time on the chicken was a little much... Mine was quite dry, but I blame myself for that (I should have watched it more closely). Maybe this will knock your socks off, but this did nothing for me. Thanks anyways, Nuclear Rich.

We loved the combination of spicy and sweet in this recipe. Made only one change, and that was substituting sour cream for half of the mayo (simply to make the sauce a little thicker). I shredded the cuke on the grater and squeezed out excess juice (like I do with tzatziki) so it wouldn't make the sauce too runny. If you're going to be serving to children, may want to halve the cayenne in the recipe. We loved the spiciness, but it might be too much for little ones. I noticed someone had trouble incorporating the honey into the cucumber sauce. If you warm the honey just a tad in the microwave, it will blend very easily.

Very good and very easy for a quick, weeknight meal. I omitted the cayenne pepper altogether from this recipe to make it kid-friendly for our 4 year-old. I added some garlic and onion powders to the mayo/cucumber mixture. As a family preference, I shredded the chicken and added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese along with the salsa and honey. Used mother-in-law's homemade tortillas as the "wraps" and subbed shredded lettuce in mine.....hubby liked the spinach. I also added a bit more shredded cheese to our wraps. Thanks for this delicious submission....a definite regular in our summer meal rotation!

Great way to serve chicken to kids.....though with less cayenne pepper.   Also fun for them to put it together by themselves!

Was Okay, but not a favorite. Already knowing my distaste for mayonaisse and its texture, I tried plain yogurt (which worked well), but found it still overly sweet -- had hoped more for a greek gyro-type side, but my daughter liked it with her avocado.

Pretty good.  It had a different flavor which was a nice change of pace for us.  I used shredded cabbage instead of spinach.

Simple Sweet & Spicy Chicken Wraps' Haiku: "
Epic wrap supreme! But would it be as good cold? Five stars and then some!" I would love to be able to make these wraps and take them to work for lunch everyday, but I'm not sure the chicken and tortilla would be quite as good cold. Putting that aside, this wrap was outstanding! I have a feeling that every sandwich I make for now on will include the cayenne/mayo/honey/cucumber instead of plain mayo. And yes, I know alot of people are snobby about canned chicken, but it was on sale, and worked wonderfully in this sandwich for me. My biggest problem was piling so much on my tortilla that I couldn't roll it neatly and I ended up demolishing my plate w/ sticky, sweet spicy fingers. Scrumptious!!

Made this as part of a mexican themed lunch for a girls day at my house.  It was a huge hit.  I left out the cayanne pepper only because I don't like spicy but use a medium salsa to add a bit more of a kick.  We all loved it.

I can't believe I forgot to rate this recipe - it's awesome! It's so quick to throw together and I can't believe salsa can make something this good.  The cool cucumber sauce balances out the sweet and spicy chicken, I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

This recipe pleased everyone in my family!  We loved the sweet/spicy flavor and the way I could use more or less of the sauces to adjust the heat.  Very unique flavor and it went together so easily. I used leftover grilled chicken and just mixed the salsa and honey together.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous, quick wrap!

This dish was very good! My girlfriend and I loved this.. The mayo, honey, cucumber, and cayenne pepper mix was great and will be made alone to use as a dip for veggies.. The wrap even tastes good cold for lunch the next day..

So good! Used pre-cooked chicken strips. (they were on sale) Had to use up some cucumbers so peeled and cut them lenghtwise then spooned out seeds. Also used zesty garlic herb wraps. Quick easy meal and everyone loved them.

Excellent!  I doubled the recipe and cut back on the cayenne as others suggested since part of the salsa i used was already hot.  I also used lettuce instead of spinach and miracle whip instead of mayo just because thats what i had on hand.  It had a nice kick to it.  Next time, I will try with spinach and mayo.  Thanks for the great recipe

Really great! I didn't have any tortillas so i just lined my plate with the spinach and spread the mayo mixture on the greens. Delicious, and probably saved a few calories that way!

I substituted the mayo with light sour cream and the wraps for 8" weight watchers multigrain wraps and got the calorie count down to 275 each and didn't lose any flavour! So good! Will definitely make again.

Slightly too much honey, but I enjoyed the recipe as a whole. I would probably switch out the cucumber for avocado, and I would switch the salsa with salsa verde in the future.

Delicious and spicy! I used light mayo and Flat Out tortilla to bring calories down. So freaking good.

AMAZING!!! I have made this many times and absolutely love it!  The only change I make is adding less cayenne to the chicken, as kids find it too spicy.  On one occasion I did not have honey, so I substituted maple syrup, and it tasted the same.

Added sriracha chilli sauce to salsa and chicken mix and did not add cayenne pepper. Also used sliced jalapeno and pepper sausages in place of chicken. Turned out heavenly. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

My Husband and family loved this wrap! The only things I changed are that I added a yellow pepper to give it some color and avacado just because I like them.

I made this tonight for my boyfriend and my sister. We all really enjoyed it. The sweetness with the honey worked for me and the spicy flavor worked for my boyfriend. Only thing I did differently was I used a spinach wrap versus a flour tortilla wrap, I doubled the honey and cucumbers, and I added shredded cheddar cheese and onions as toppings. I wasn't fond of the mayo part, so next time I think I will try the plain yogurt or sour cream that someone else suggested. But overall a very enjoyable dish.

My family is not very excited when I told them we are trying something new, wraps for dinner.  But oh boy, they were surprisingly taken when they took the first bite.  It was fantastic.  The mayonaise cucumber sauce is divine.  Had to double the sauce every time I made this.  Just try.

This was awesome!!  Tasty, easy to prepare, I will definately be making this again.  Was a little too spicy for my daughter so next time I will halve the cayenne pepper, but otherwise it's really perfect the way it is, nice balance of sweet and spicy.

I used left over rotisserie chicken for this recipe & it came together even faster! The fresh spinach really makes this & I love the mayo/honey mixture!
This is going in the monthly rotation for those no time to make dinner nights....

This is a very easy tasty quick dinner!  My partner loved it, too.  I replaced a half mayo with plain yogurt to make it lighter that worked very well.  The mixture of the mayo (and yogurt in my way), honey, cayenne pepper, black pepper and diced cucumber is a wonderful sauce. I will use it for other recipe, too.  I added pan sauteed sugar snap that is a wonderful addition to give it a crispy fresh punch.

Unbelievable!!! This is now one of our summer favorites! 
Since I didn't have any salsa, I added big slices of tomato to my wrap. Even my husband (who's picky about vegetables) LOVED it! :)

I fully expected this to be horrible, despite the great reviews.. The flavors sound so strange! But I made it anyway and my boyfriend LOVED it! We did add shredded cheese to the second wrap, which topped it off! I followed the recipe exactly otherwise. Great for the warmer weather!

This recipe was simple and quick to make.  I thought the flavors were delish, and a nice switch for a chicken recipe.  I did not have cucumbers on hand so I used finely chopped onion (in nonfat yogurt instead of mayo), which was very good.  My kids enjoyed this and I would definitely make this again!

Great recipe! I was a little pensive about the cayenne pepper, based on my inexperience with it and the reviews left by others- however, it only added to the dish, it was not THAT spicy! I followed the recipe exactly. I simply used romaine instead of spinach, sprinkled a little sharp cheddar and sliced purple onions on top, and it was great! Thx for the recipe!

This is a great recipe with wonderful flavors and was a hit with my husband and two boys (9yrs and 19mos).  I only gave it 4 stars because I thought that the cayenne pepper measurement was way off.  I can handle a lot of spice but a 1/2 tsp in the sauce made it almost inedible to me and I omitted altogether in the chicken.  I ended up making another batch of the sauce with NO cayenne and mixing the two together and it still had plenty of heat.  Next time I will probably leave it out of the sauce altogether and just add a 1/4 tsp. to the chicken.  I also used Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise to make it a bit lighter. Personally, I think that yogurt or sour cream makes more sense as a base for this sauce with this dish than mayonnaise.  I served it with a side of cilantro lime rice and it was delish!  It would be great with lettuce instead of spinach or even wilting the spinach in with the chicken mixture would be good too.  I found that it needed tweaking but it is an awesome base recipe!

Woweeeee!  I really dig the flavor in this recipe.  What a fantastic combo putting the honey, salsa, and cayenne together.  I could eat the chicken all by itself, yum!  

I decided the use mostly nonfat greek yogurt with a touch of miracle whip (it's all I had).  The cucumber and yogurt combo made this sauce very watery.  It's more like a salad dressing or dipping sauce now.  But VERY tasty.  Next time I may try the mayo instead to see if it is spreadable.  

I love spice so I loaded up on the cayenne, but added a lot of honey to help counterbalance the spice.  

What a tasty dish!  You won't be dissappointed!  :)

These were amazing!  However, like others, I will be reducing the cayenne pepper as it was a bit too spicy for me.  Next time I'll pile in more spinach so it doesn't shrivel down when I wrap it.

This was so delicious. I did cut the cayenne pepper in the sauce in half. Next time I will do the same with the cayenne in the chicken, just to match my family's tastes a bit better. Even so it was wonderful.

Definitely something yummy and different. Very easy, especially since I had most of the ingredients on hand.  I used cayenne pepper and halved the recipe, and that was still a bit too spicy for us. But overall, a good recipe that is super easy when you want something different and delicious.

delicious but a little too hot for me. I will reduce the cayenne in my next go around. This was great otherwise.

This is delicious! I already had chicken thawed, and was wondering what I should do with it. I found this recipe, and I LOVE wraps anyhow. Great mayo-cucumber sauce. I'll have this again!

This was delicious! I thought the cayenne pepper spice was perfect, but my boyfriend doesn't like spice at all, so I think I would just omit it from the mayo next time and just add it to the chicken. I added some diced tomato and cheese to the wraps, too. Just delicious!

These were FANTASTIC!! I cooked it by the exact directions (used a "normal" cucumber, instead of an English) and it was very easy to make! Will be making this again.

Wow! This was really good.  Even my picky kids loved it and asked me to make it again.  I was debating what to make for dinner when I saw this simple recipe and happened to have the ingredients on hand.  It took almost no effort, and very little time to get this to the table. I'm always looking for simple to put together and flavorfull foods, and this fit the bill. The cucumber dressing was really good, and I think it would be great on a salad, too.  The flavors all blend together really well.  I will definitely make this one again!

Very good! It's easy too. I used steak and chicken for my husband. Even my kids loved it. I'll definitely make this more often. Nice change from regular taco wraps.

these are really delicious, my husband and I both loved them!  next time I might add a little less cayenne pepper to the salsa, or even omit it all together, it was a TAD spicy for our taste.... but overall, a wonderful recipe!

This was delicious, I did add some cumin and paprika. I didn't have any spinach on hand so we ate it without and it was yummy!! My daughter put a little grated colby cheese on her's. Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoyed this a lot and it was simple to make. I made it as is, other than only using half of the cayenne called for. It turned out having the perfect amount of spice for me. I will definiltely be making this again and have added it to my "favorites" folder :)

I think I should've poured the liquid out of the pan when the chicken was finished cooking to make the sauce a little less liquidy.

Excellent...  a very nice balance with the pepper and the honey....   lots of flavor, easy to make, it was a hit with the wife who loves things a bit spicy!  Thanks!

We have this on a pretty consistent basis.  This last time we had one of the kids over, a vegetarian, I used green and red peppers and some mushrooms instead of chicken...it was great!

Oh my goodness!!  These are fabulous-super easy and super delicious!  I followed the directions exactly.  I let my sauce sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes prior to serving.  I could eat the sauce with a spoon all by itself.  My husband even said these are awesome!  These will go into a regular lunch rotation at my house.  Thanks for sharing :)

All I can say is WOW! These wraps were absolutely delicious. My mother found this recipe and made it first. Since then it has fallen into the hands of the whole family and I was not surprised to hear that they all shared the same delight as we did! The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. The second time, I used 1/4 cup of nonfat greek yogurt and 1/4 cup mayonnaise in the cucumber sauce. These were equally as delicious as the first time and I felt a lot less guilty eating them!

easy to make and tasty recipe! we bought garlic-pesto tortillas and it enhanced the flavor. also seems hard to mess up (as we accidentally only put 1/2 cup of the salsa instead of the whole cup). everyone wanted seconds!

These are my husbands favourite meal, I make them all the time! It’s a great weeknight dinner. I usually use medium salsa because we like spicy, but you can use mild and start with about half the cayenne then adjust to your taste (remember that it’s in the mayo sauce as well as the salsa) if you don’t like things as hot!

This is very good but VERY spicy!  I reduced the cayenne by half and it was still too hot for us.  But, I love how the flavors blend and we love the cucumbers in the sauce.  It really makes it!  I used plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo, but otherwise made as written.

If I make this again, I would  cook the chicken differently. I really didn't like the chicken cooked with salsa. It didn't brown and looked and tasted blah. I would season the chicken (maybe a sweet and spicy rub) and grill it, then cut into strips. I did like the sauce and overall this was a tasty meal.

The cucumber sauce really balances out the cayenne spice, however, I might put less cayenne pepper in it next time. Just make sure you taste the sauce before you put all of the cayenne pepper in it! Very good!

This is very light and delicious!  I made it exactly as written (except using spinach wraps) and it was a huge hit with the family!  I did add some chopped cucumber, green onion, tomato and grated cheddar cheese to a couple of them as requested by a family member and that was wonderful too.  We will definitely be making this again!   update:  I found that the leftover chicken was kind of dry so I tried shredding the chicken and adding some water before refrigerating and that made the flavor even better the next day both cold and reheated! YUM!

Next time we make this, we'll probably puree the cucumber  and substitute sour cream for the mayo, and see what difference that makes.

This recipe was delicious. I didn't have chunky salsa so I chopped up a tomato and mixed it with picante sauce. The cucumber sauce was the best part of this. I will probably use it for many other dishes in the future.

I liked it. I am not a fan of spicy food, so i cut down on the Cayenne  to 2/8 and it wasn't bad  but may use less next time

I was looking for something a bit different than the stuff I usually make and this recipe did not disappoint at all. I might hold back just a tiny bit on the cayenne next time but that's just a personal preference from a person with a low heat tolerance.

This was wonderful. I did not change a thing. Made the recipe as directed and I found it to be very easy to make with simple ingredients that I had laying around anyway. I was nervous about the mayo mixture but it really went nicely with the flavor of the chicken. This was so so good and low calorie too compared to many other wrap recipes. I also through it in my panini press after wrapping it. It was so so good! Definitely keeping this recipe around! Thanks for sharing!

This was great! If I was to do it again I'd probably tone down the use of the pepper, my family definitely doesn't do spice well. As well, next time I make this I will be sure to drain the chicken once it is cooked, as the sauce was too runny with it still in. Other than that, the honey was lovely in the sauce and the chicken was very tender.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, with a minor change, and a finishing adjustment. For the change: I didn't start with fresh chicken, I had a single leftover baked chicken breast, and about 2/3 of leftover Sam's Club rotisserie chicken. I cut all the chicken into small cubes and combined it in the skillet. Not a big change, but worth mentioning in case anyone else as inexperienced as I am is wondering. For the finishing adjustment: I sprinkled blue cheese crumbles inside the wrap, and it was fantastic. The blue cheese added just enough 'whatever' to counter the spicy of the wrap, and without it, I don't think I would have added this into our rotation.   A couple of minor notes: The wrap is borderline "too spicy", but I liked the bit of extra heat. Also, oddly enough, the smell of the finished and constructed wrap (without the blue cheese) somehow made it less appealing to my youngest child, and I agree somewhat - the chicken didn't smell as tantalizing as I expected when it was cooking, but perhaps that's due to the spices/herbs used in the leftover pieces.

I was a bit leary of the sauce because I had to sub the honey for a mixture of sugar and water, but it was still delicious! I also subbed half of the cayenne for paprika and felt it had the right amount of kick for me

Heads up! If you're like me and you add up the ingredients first, either for shopping or prep, honey and cayenne pepper amounts are listed twice—this appears to be an error. As for the dish, I found it very tasty, with minimum prep time and clean up!.I found the chicken to be a bit spicy for some, so I served it with sour cream so everyone could enjoy it at their own spice-tolerance. Will definitely make again!

I wanted to make something a little healthier and I love wraps. So when I came upon this recipe, it sounded very fresh and light. And it is. The cucumber mayo mix is so flavorful and the perfect combo with the sweet and spicy chicken! Made this multiple times and will continue to do so

Will definitely make this again! It is pretty spicy. After tasting the mayo mixture, I decided that was enough spice for me so I didn't add the cayenne into the chicken mixture. I really liked it and my husband requested I make this again sometime.

Very simple, quick, and tasty.  I cut the Ceyenne amount in half on both parts because we are not fans of really spicy.  Other than that, I went right along with the recipe.  4 thumbs up by all 4 family members.

I can't believe how simple and delicious this was! While I would have loved it, I just removed the cayenne pepper for my pre-schooler. We all enjoyed it!

Changed barely anything (low-fat mayo, wheat wraps, a little extra honey on the chicken) and it was seriously delicious. Served with a big green salad w/ fruity vinaigrette.  I love carbs and cheese so much, and didn't miss them at all!  (4.5 stars)

FANTASTIC RECIPE!!! I am usually really bad at cooking but this recipe is a fool-proof recipe! It was my first time cooking with chicken and it was amazing. The tortillas were gone instantly and I got praised for this amazing recipe!!!

I really like this recipe. I changed some things, not because I didn't like what Nuclear Rich had come up with, but because I wanted it to fit my kitchen and alotted time. 
I made the cucumber stuff with double the cukes and double the cayenne. (I like veggies and I like spicy.)
I had leftover chicken and just sliced that up and put it in my cast iron pan with salsa. 
I didn't have any spinach so I skipped that, and just warmed up my tortillas, added the cukes and chicken and rolled it up. 
Quick, easy, and one of the tastiest lunches I have had in a while. And dairy free, too!

This is SO delicious! I made a few changes though. I used sour cream instead of mayo & cut back on the cayenne pepper (was TOO hot the first time as-is). I also added avacado on top! I like to double the sauce portion to make a little extra since the sauce is so good!

Super easy and delicious!! I added some shredded cheese and substituted chopped romaine for the spinach simply because we were all out and I didn't have time to book it to the store! Will be making again for sure!

If I make this again, I'll either cut down on the cucumber or omit it entirely. I like Pickles but I just can't get behind cucumber. I might have put too much in, but I am not entirely sure. I might have also put too much on the ones I made. I want to make this again and see what I could do to vary it if I can't find the good balance of cucumber to the spicy mayo ratio.

I think I also might have used half of the recommended amount of salsa by accident.

Great recipe and mayo/cucumber/honey combo was fabulous! Only one adjustment, added more honey to the mayo sauce. Definately will make again.

I was very leery of this recipe but decided to try it as it got so many good reviews and seemed so quick and easy with minimal ingredients.  We normally put more toppings (cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion) on our wraps, but I stayed true to this recipe.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!  I will make this again for a quick weeknight meal for sure!  Thanks for the recipe :)

This is a great and simple recipe for when your in the mood for something new.  Instead of plain flour wraps try garden green or sun dried tomatoes wraps to give it a little more flare.

Great recipe.  I to added a twist. I used a 1/4 cup of mashed avocado and a 1/4 cup of sour cream instead of the mayo.  Also I marinated my chicken strips in a little Italian dressing and cayenne pepper. This is definitely a keeper.

Wow. I just finished trying out this recipe...my husband and I ate 5 wraps between the two of us. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was incredible - the ingredients, textures, and flavors are a delightful combination. Great company meal, very fast to whip up. Thanks so much!

Mmmm, really tasty and unique!  I served it on hamburger buns because I had some left over.  Really good.  The tortillas would be great, plenty of sauce to keep them juicy. Thanks for sharing!

These make a perfect lunch on a warm day! Now since it is approaching bikini season, i somewhat deviated from the original recipe. I used greek yogurt instead of mayo, added shredded carrots & grilled the chicken before cooking it with the salsa. It turned out great!

This is super easy, delicious, and can easily be topped on lettuce or spinach instead of in a wrap for a low-carb option.  Really enjoyed it.

This recipe is just about as good as it gets!  I did have to decrease the amount of cayenne pepper as I have an 8 year old who doesn't like things too spicy.  I also suggest using garden vegetable spinach wraps instead of tortillas for a wrap bursting with summer flavor.

It has great flavour but if you are feeding kids you might want to halve the cayenne in the chicken and in the mayo. A bit spicy for my daughter but for me it was great.

This was a super delicious and easy meal to make.  It's quick to whip up as well.  The spice is just right, leaves a head in the mouth.      I followed everything as listed on the recipe but had to use pita bread instead as it was the only thing I had in the house.  I would make extra sauce next time for even more flavor.

These were surprisingly delicious! I thought it sounded like such a strange combination of ingredients, but it was really great. Very spicy but had sweet flavoring as well. I would maybe cut down on the cayenne just a tad next time.

VERY good and easy to make!  Love the sauce!  Perfect amount of spice, as we are a spicy loving family.  My 3 & 4 yr. old daughters devoured the wraps!!

This recipe was awesome! All I did different was add shrimp to the salsa chicken mixture! The spice was just right.  This was a winner in my home. Will definately make this again.

These are pretty good.  I left out the cucumber and added spicy mustard to the sauce because I don't like mayo too much.  I might add a bit more honey if I made these again; I couldn't really taste the "sweet" part.  ***EDIT 5/11*** I've made these a few times for dinner since first reviewing, and my husband always looks forward to them.  I still change the sauce, making it more of a spicy honey mustard than the mayo-based sauce, but the chicken mixture and spinach leaves are left the same and they're wonderful.  I'm eating a wrap now with a glass of Cherry Limeade I from this site, and it is a wonderfully light and easy summer dinner.  :)

Good for a quick and easy lunch.  It's not anything wonderful though.  The sauce was a little too sweet, would probably be better with less honey.

Tastes like eating Grass! Normally, my boyfriend and I really enjoy cucumber sauce.... which is why I picked this recipe. It was an awful combination. The chicken was great, the sauce was great, but not together. Try using no sauce and adding a bit of sharp cheddar for a great dinner that doesn't taste like the one I just ruined by using this recipe.

Amazing flavor and very moist, but also VERY greasy.  And very sweet.  If I make again, I am not going to add the glaze because it made it way too sweet.

Very good.  Only adjustment will be to add a little more cayenne pepper.

Hubby LOVED this one, raved about it actually!  The sweet and spicy hit the spot.  I used thin cut chicken breasts which worked perfectly for quickly cutting them into thin strips.  The sauce is amazing.  Quick, delicious, and easy.  Thanks for a great recipe!  As Nuclear Rich put it "it will rock your taste buds!"

Absolutely INCREDIBLE.  The sauce is fabulous – I wasn’t sure how it would turn out at first, but holy cow it was good!  My husband also loved these.  I will be making the sauce again for salad dressing/dips, etc.  With a 1 year old and working full time, we need quick and delicious weeknight meals … this was it!  Thanks so much for a great, quick, YUMMY Tuesday night meal.

Good lunch recipe.  I suggest microwaving tortillas in between damp paper towels, just so they don't get too chewy.  I used plain greek yogurt instead of mayo, and next time I might cut down the cayenne pepper...this was spicy!

These were delicious. Loved the sweet spicy mayo. I made exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. Perfect for a weeknight meal.
