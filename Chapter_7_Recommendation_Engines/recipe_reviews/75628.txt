With only 2 cups of water, my soup had the consistancy of Peanut Butter. I increased water to 3.5 cups.  Next time I'll use either all white wine or all brandy because the red wine made the onions an interesting shade that wasn't too appealing.  I will also peel the potatoes with a potato peeler, cube and boil before mashing as my potatoes were so big, the outside was mush, but the insides were still raw when boiled whole. I added an extra tablespoon of brandy in at the end to really pop the flavor out. Final result is pretty good.

I make a lot of squash and sweet potato soups...this one looked easy and I was trying to use up some brandy...I feel like I wasted 3 sweet potatoes and I'm dreading eating the leftovers.

I loved the smell of this!  The alcohol really brought out the taste of the allspice!  It was alright as written, but I preferred it with just a splash of cashew milk!

So I also increased the liquid content, using vegetable stock instead. It was ok, but not worthy of keeping in my recipe book.
