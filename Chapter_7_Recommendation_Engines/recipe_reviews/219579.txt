The substitution of puff pastryfor bread in these Monte Crito's is outstanding! The puff pastry is buttery and rich. I have always heard of Monte Cristo sandwiches made with raspberry jam instead of served with maple syrup so I spread a thin layer of good quality raspberry jam inside the puff pastry before I folded it over the other ingredients. I did not serve with maple syrup. Also, I used Gruyere instead of swiss. Looks fancy and tastes decadent. Outstanding!

Made it for my son as a college graduation treat... he loved it! I couldn't find the Puff pastry sheets so instead I used a pie crust.. it was delish! My husband had some too and they both said it tasted just like Bennigans... score!

This was okay. Because you have to seal the crusts for the pastry sheets, you get a lot of 'bread' and all the ham and cheese together in just one spot. My family liked it, but we aren't rushing to make this again.

This one was a HUGE hit in our house for a tasty meal with a breakfast feel.  I'll not do the standard of breaking every ingredient down and incorporating new ones which seems so much the fashion of users that review.  Why post a review about a recipe that was changed completely!?  In any event, this one was followed to exact steps with a really tasty finish that will be repeated again.  Extremely easy to make and really good.

I'm not realy sure what's holding me  back from a 5 star rating, perhaps the fact that we don't normally eat this kind of food, but these were definitely a hit with the kids and the hubby, and they were ridiculously simple.  We served ours with some homemade raspberry jam and some sliced cantaloupe.  Kind of a "Breakfast for Dinner" kind of night.
