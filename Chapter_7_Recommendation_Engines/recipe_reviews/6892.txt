This was awful!!!  I should have been suspicious of the cup of orange juice.  After an hour, it had burned on top, and the middle was nowhere near done!  What did cook through tasted so bad, I threw the whole thing out.

I can't believe this has only 3 stars.  I have been making this bread for years and get rave reviews.  It really needs to rest 24 hours before slicing.

Note that I made changes, so take this rating with a grain of salt! I only had about 2/3 C dried apricots, so I used dried figs to make up the difference. I used fig/orange jam on top instead of apricot. This was good and my family liked it. I think they would have liked it better with more apricot/apricot jam. I think this is best served as a breakfast pastry with coffee.

Perfect!! I'm not a great baker so I trust reviews when I try something. I used water instead of OJ and reduced sugar to 1/4 cup less. Perfect with coffee and warm with butter in the morning.  I saved at least $6 this week in avoiding coffee shop treats!

Um, this is basically a fruitcake without the alcohol and candied fruits.  It's not bad, just not quite what I was expecting when I started making the recipe.  However, I suspected it was what it was as I started tossing in the fruits and nuts, but after pouring it into the pan, I was sure.  It turns out pretty, as well, but hubs complained it was hard to put butter on because it was slippery.  I had to bake for another 15 mins to finish.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was brought to a Bunco game and everyone raved about it.  It is very tasty and reminds me of a light fruit cake.  Very yummy!

Wonderful bread! Not sure how the other bread did not turn out. A MUST TRY!!! I used butter instead, better taste & added some cinnamon & cloves too.
