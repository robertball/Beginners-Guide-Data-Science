I put my own twist on it, but this is a SUPER tasty recipe! My carrots took a lot longer than half an hour to soften, but that's ok, I had time! My family loved the soup, and that's all that really matters!!!

Great soup! Simple yet bold, that is the best way to describe it. It doesn't taste like pureed carrots or even one distinct flavour. I think the sweet potato gives it an edge but it isn't an evident factor. It just has a nice balanced flavour and the Tabasco gives it a familiar afterbite with it's unique taste. I made this in my pressure cooker in about 9 minutes but left the carrots in pretty large pieces. I used a litre of water for a half kilo of carrots and a small sweet potato. The consistency was right on, soupy but not watery. Thank you What's for Dinner Mom for another great recipe.

I really liked this soup.  I don't like spicy foods so i omitted the hot sauce.  I think next time I will halve the tomato paste .  I felt it overpowered the carrot and sweet potato.  It was still good.  I am eating it as I type.

I always make this for our Easter dinner and while preparing it this year I went to use the sweet potato only to find that it was unusable.  I made a substitution of about 1 cup pre cooked, leftover, brown rice.  It added a nice thickness to the soup. I still missed the sweet potato silkiness but thought I'd share a good substitute in a pinch.
