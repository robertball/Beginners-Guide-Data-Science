Good basic recipe, it's pretty bland on it's own. I used cream of chicken soup, added a dollup of sour cream and a splash of white wine, plus a diced small red potato, 1/3 c. carmelized chopped onion w/ 2 t. chopped garlic, 1/3 c. celery, 1/2 t. pepper, 1/4 t. poultry seasoning and 1/4 t. celery seed. I also used half the cheese, no french fried onions, stirred it all up and then added milk until it seemed like a good consistancy. YUM!! (I know some of you feel it wrong to alter recipes but I've made my finest meals by reading reviews and tweaks)

I loved it!  However, I must confess that I did not even attempt to create a lattice crust since I was pressed for time- I used one can of buttermilk biscuits that peeled apart in layers and covered the top of the whole pie. I also used a combo of cream of celery soup and cream of chicken soup.  My family really enjoyed it and everyone had seconds. The french fried onions definitely supplied the extra flavor and texture. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe and thank you so much for sharing. I love the crispness of frozen veggies(Plus they hold more nutrients than canned.). In addition to the cheese called for, I added about 1/4 cup of crumbled blue cheese. I HATE spending the money on those over-priced french fried onions, so I add chinese noodles (which I always save from chinese take-out just for this casserole) and about 1/4 tsp onion powder as a substitute. I don't do the lattice either although it looks really nice. I just unroll it and lay it on top and it works out great.

Even though this casserole was a little bland as other reviewers noted, one can always adjust the seasonings to suit your taste, and don't forget to season the cooked chicken as well.  Also, I didn't have any french fried onions on hand so that was omitted. I still think this recipe deserves 5 stars as it is an easy dish to prepare with basic ingredients. I will prepare this casserole again.

This is exactly what I was looking for, quick, easy, and delicious.  All ingreidients on hand.  I buy large packages of bonless chicken breast when on sale and cook in my crockpot, then cut up into 2 cup ziplock quart freezer bags so I can just pull out and use in recipes.  Huge time saver.  I added some pepper and maybe extra seasoned salt...i just sprinkled on top and didn't measure.  I cut the crescent rolls with a pizza cutter then did the lattice work.  Thanks for sharing!

I used cream of chicken soup instead of potato, a little less veggies, and left out the ff onions (didn't have any on hand).  Overall, not a bad dish!  The lattice was a bit difficult to make, as the strips got soft quickly which made it hard to work with. I also used reduced fat crescents and soup, and couldn't tell the difference.

This recipe is easy and is so yummy!  I tend to use a little less vegetables then it calls for because it seems to chunky if I add in what it calls for.  Also, I don't weave the lattice, but just lay down the long ways and then short ways for the dough, and it comes out just as pretty.

This was very easy to make so for that I give it 4 stars.  But, if I were to make it again I would use fresh veggies.  The frozen ones are quick when you are short on time but just don't have the same flavor.  This also could use a little more spice of some sort.  But overall, I would say this is a good, quick recipe  and probably great for potlucks.

This is an excellent recipe..... very tasty and quick. I am a little unsure about the french fried onions... think I will use onions straight up next time.... but a very flavorful pie!

This was really good. I cooked some chicken up with garlic and did everythig else as written. I used butter crescent rolls but wasnt a fan of it with this dish, It was good but I would just go with regular crescent rolls next time. Thanks!

Just made this tonight and my family loved it! Even my picky son. Hubby wants me to make it for our neighbors. I did take other reviewers advice and added 1/2 cup sour cream, 3 splashes white wine, 2 tablespoons minced garlic and double the seasoned salt. Also, boiled boneless skinless chicken breast with 3 bouillon cubes before shredding and adding to mix. It looked and tasted sooo good! Definitely a keeper!!! Thank you!

We loved this - here are my small modifications: I sauteed fresh onion, carrot, canned corn and frozen peas and hash brown potatoes. I really like a lot of flavor in my meals so I threw in a few spashes of marsala wine and a couple tablespoons of sour cream. I was lazy and didn't lattice the crescent rolls, but it was still amazing. My picky hubby loved it!

Very yummy with the crescent dough on top- I did not bother to do the strips on top, I just took it out of the package and plopped it on top.  I used cream of potato, but next time I will probably use cream of chicken.

This is a great recipe for using up leftover chicken! I have made it as is and also altered it to fit the veggies and soups that I have on hand. My kids love a combo of cream of potato and cream of chicken! I have never done the lattice either, just laid the triangles on top.

OMG...loved this!  I don't eat meat but I made it for my parents because my dad always loved Swiss Chalet's chicken pot pie...and wow, even my mom who isn't a fan of pot pie said it was very yummy! I used cream of chicken soup, some canned potatoes, sauteed some carrots & onions with the chicken, steamed some broccoli, added drained canned corn...and I think that's it. I used the cheese too. It was so easy. I used a little over one thing of pillsbury crescent rolls and didn't make the lattice, just a pie crust.

My family loved this dish, I thought it was okay. I used mixed garden vegi out of a can and half a can of lima beans. Instead of pressing the crescents together, I just bought the crescent dough sheets that pillsbury makes, and it was much easier to work with. Needed pepper and some other seasonings.. play around with seasonings if you want.

Very simple and tasty - the whole family enjoyed it.  I cooked the veggies before mixing with the other ingredients.  Had to pull the potpie out of the oven before 35 minutes because the crust was burning.

I liked this recipe...I changed a few things...used one bag of veggies, added canned diced potatoes and cream of chicken soup, and I cooked the chicken with garlic...and I thought it was awesome...I will not, however, form the lattice on top again...took too much time for me, but all in all, this was really good!

Great recipe to use when crunched for time!  My husband really likes it.  I didn't have the cream of potato soup on hand one time and used cream of chicken which worked well too.  I also combined half of cream of chicken with half of cream of potato and that was good.

I thought this was a simple yet good family dish, I did as other reviews had suggested and sauteed onion and I would add another crescent roll tube to the recipe and then it would be 5 stars.

This was a good tasting dish, however, I'm not fond of frozen veggies, so I substituted canned veggies.  My family doesn't care for the firmness of frozen veggies.  Very good, though!

I would have given it 5 stars, but I changed the veggies for fresh carrots and potatoes (I sauteed them first) and added frozen peas to the mix. This was a great meal for the week after Thanksgiving, I already had all of the ingredients left over from the holiday!

This just didn't go well for us.  The croissant topping never got done.  And to eat it without that part just didn't taste very good.  I didn't separate the rolls to make a lattice, maybe that is why it never got done.  I am not sure if that would've made a difference.  The flavor was a bit bland for us as well.

This was good, however next time I make it I will only use one package of the frozen veggies.  I thought it had to many.   Will aslo try using cream on chicken soup next time.  Overall was pretty gooda and my very picky husband said it was ok.

Very good recipe.  I made a couple changes for the sake of preference and convenience.  I used low fat/low salt cream of chicken instead of cream of potato soup, diced in a half a baking potato, and put in a little extra chicken and cheese.  I also used biscuit dough and flattened it into long ovals instead of going through the trouble of a lattice pattern.  All in all quite good, though my picky boyfriend thought it was a little bland ;)  A very hearty, complete meal!

Easy and yummy, my fiance loved it. I added frozen peas and canned potatos, and used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of potato. I covered the whole top of the pie instead of doing the lattice because I wanted more of a pie crust. It was great! I'll never buy frozen again!
