I will for sure be making this again! We are not the type of people who follow recipes to a T so naturally we made a few changes but overall I feel like this was really great instruction to making these rolls! The tip about coring the cabbage and boiling the whole head was amazing! the leaves fell off easily, just be careful coring the cabbage, don't cut a finger off! We added cabbage to the mixture and we liked that a lot, also I felt like I needed to add some more seasoning so I liberally sprinkled some Mrs. Dash and Lawry's  into the mixture as well. The only other change we made was we browned the meat prior to putting it into the mixture, did not add eggs, used white rice to replace the quinoa and we used venison instead of beef and pork. I know it may sound like we changed the whole recipe but whatever we made, it was delicious and it was completely inspired by this recipe! I want to try making it next time with the eggs and see how the consistency changes. Loved this and would make again (even different variants would be interesting like an Asian theme or Indian theme or Mexican would all be so delicious!)

I substituted vegetarian meatballs and made it completely deconstructed. Easier and still great. 

I also make wontons with some of the extra filling.
