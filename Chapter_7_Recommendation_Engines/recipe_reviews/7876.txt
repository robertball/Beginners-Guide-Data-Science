Go check your pantry or your cupboards! If you've got a white cake mix and a can of pie filling you've got a beautiful cake hiding in there!  I felt like baking today but it was late in the day and I didn't have much time.  I didn't expect much from this other than the speediness factor.  After all, it was "just" a cake mix and a can of pie filling, but that was ok, since Hubs' staff isn't fussy!  I REALLY became skeptical when I realized what it took (nothing, really) to get it in the pan and into the oven.  But it was almost as if the cake played a trick on me, because once it came out of the oven and got all prettied up with the sliced almonds and glaze, it was almost like the Ugly Duckling becoming a beautiful swan.  I was impressed. It is gorgeous.  But I wasn't convinced it would taste half as good as it looked. I was surprised again - it's just delicious - soft and moist, creamy and gooey - everything you could ask for.  The recipe is a true winner on its own, but I think it helped to add a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter and a quarter teaspoon of almond extract to the glaze.  Where it called for a "dash" of vegetable oil, I gave it a "dribble" of corn syrup. It kept the glaze soft and gave it a nice sheen, while the extracts pretty effectively disguised "that cake mix taste."  This is a stunning coffee cake, no matter how shamefully easy it is to make.  I'd love to try other flavors - apple, lemon, blueberry, strawberry, raspberry are all tempting possibilities.

Excellent recipe.   I made this as muffins to make it easier for people to take (use paper liners).  I used Duncan Hiens coconut supreme cake mix for added flavor.  I used fat free sour cream, only two eggs to hold down the fat and increased the water a little.  The batter should be thick and spread, not pour.  That is how you know you have the batter right.   I too added crumb topping before baking and a few pecans for my husband's muffin.  Crumb topping = 1/4 cup of each cake mix,brown sugar & oatmeal.  Only add about 1-2 tablespoon of Parkay buttery spray (no fat, calories or cholesterol)just to make some crumbs.  It should be a bit powdery.  Thanks for a great recipe

This coffee cake is a winner every time.  The only thing I changed was to added 1 tsp of almond extract to the batter.  Yum!

I agree this coffee cake is extremely impressive looking and it's EASY to make! I baked it in a 13x9 pan which takes longer than 25 minutes.

I made this more like a cake, but served it for an office morning get together - they ate it all!  I used a 9 x 13 pan, but it took more like 45 minutes to bake. I kept testing.  Then I made it with a carrot cake mix with apple pie topping.  Still did the glaze, but used finely chopped walnuts.  The whole thing did not make it to the office.  It was first reviewed by my resident taster, my husband,sometime between midnight and 7 a.m.! He obviously approved, because 4 pieces were missing.

Mmm.  I used blueberry pie filling instead of cherry and I omitted the oil in the glaze and used some lemon juice... I also toasted the almonds, as previously suggested.  The white cake mix makes this fluffier and less dense than most coffee cakes, which is nice, but it did have a little bit of a boxed cake mix taste. Despite that, it was lovely with toasted almonds and lemon glaze.

I've made this cake and it is one of my favorites. I've used apple, peach, and cherry pie filling. This cake is so easy to make. I've given the recipe to many friends as well as family members out of state to try. Everyone loves it. This recipe can be made even by novice cooks. It deserves a 5 star rating.

I had to bring a dessert for a meeting.
I picked it because I had all the ingre-
dients on hand and it looked easy and
quick.  I used light sour cream and
omitted the almonds because that was the
one item I didn't have on hand.  It 
turned out great. I think the almonds
would make it even better. -Marilyn

This coffeecake turned out just as I expected.  It was easy to prepare and baked quickly and turned out moist and bursting with cherries.  I added almond extract to the glaze, and it went perfectly with the cake.  The teachers at school loved this one and some could not believe that it started with a cake mix.

My husband called this recipe a "home run" after just one bite.  Unfortunately I didn't have all the ingredients, so I had to replace some ingredients with what I had on hand (and I wanted to lighten it up a little).  My changes were to use a yellow cake mix, subsistute the sour cream with non fat greek yogurt, 3 eggs for 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites, add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cake mixture and a 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract to the glaze.  I didn't bother adding a crumb topping as suggested by some reviewers and it really didn't need it.  I'm looking forward to making this again and again :)

This is AWESOME!  I made this twice and baked in 8 inch round aluminumpans and 4 families raved about this.  My son hates anything cherry, yet tried "just a bite" then ate the whole thing.  This cake is requested for Birthdays, Easter and mothers day.  May try using yogurt to replace cream cheese.  But haven't yet...perfect as is.

This was good for a quick dessert but definitely too sweet for breakfast.  I don't know if I'll make this again because it still tastes a lot like cake mix.  This recipe is flexible though in that you can use fat free sour cream and egg substitute without sacrificing any flavor or texture.  I used a 9x13 pan, and it ended up being about 1.75 inches thick.

Hubs wanted me to make something for his fishing buddies.  I was short on time and this recipe looked like it would be a snap to put together, and it was.  I made half the recipe using an 11x7” baking pan, which worked quite well.  I intended to put some vanilla in the batter but forgot.  I swirled the cherry pie filling into the batter and also sprinkled the almonds on top before baking so they would adhere better.  I made the glaze subbing a little light corn syrup for the vegetable oil.  Hubs said his buddies loved it, so that must mean five stars!

This was very easy, had everything on hand. I used blueberry pie filling and french vanilla cake mix. I will probably run a knife through the fruit and cake batter next time to better blend the tastes!

I will definitely make this again. I did find it to be quite cakey, but still good. Next time, I will bake with a bit of sweetened cream cheese on top as well... And maybe a bit more fruit.

After seeing the rave reviews I decided to give this a shot. Honestly, it tasted just like what it is- cake mix and canned fruit pie filling. It looked nice but it was really nothing special.

This is extremely quick and simple.  I did add some almond extract to the batter, which I always do to white cake mix.  This gives it a little added flavor.

Simple and tasty. I didn't have cherry pie filling on hand so I used a concoction of frozen cherries, white sugar and tapioca to thicken it. Turned out wonderfully. One great thing about this recipe is it's versatility. You can do spice cake with apples, yellow cake with peaches, devil's food with cherries. Many, many possibilities! Love it! Thanks Glenda!

I thought this ws fantastic.....as little as I had of it.  By time I went to have another piece for myself, my husband had almost all of it gone(it did not last a day in the house....no kids....no escape goat).  However, I did use the crumbled topping instesd of the glazed topping.  If you have a big sweet tooth then i suppose the glaze would suit you better.  If you are looking for more of a coffee cake style, I would suggest the crumble topping.  Over all,  very good and I will make it again!  Thank you for the recipe!

I know better, but didn't put my hands on my ingredients and no longer live alone - so sometimes they're consumed without my knowledge!  I had to substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream, and for the glaze I used lemon juice and extract with a couple of tablespoons of milk and melted butter with powdered sugar to give it a bit of tartness, since I had no almonds. I made it Lemon-Glazed Cherry coffeecake.  And it was a sure hit.  Next time, I may make it with lemon cake mix instead, and maybe strawberry pie filling.

Oddly bland. I used reduced-fat sour cream and pie filling with artificial sugar, so that might've been my bad. Even the glaze -- which added significant calories -- had no taste. I'd keep looking for another coffee cake recipe.

Was certainly a sweet cake, very moist.  Everyone who tasted it loved it and said it was a keeper. Would love to do one with peach pie filling.

In selecting this recipe I was looking for fast and easy & with that in mind, 4 stars(it really is more a Betty Crocker thing than home cooking)...when I want REAL coffeecake, I will go to my recipe box of oldies but goodies...

this was okay. Good for breakfast.   Husband wasn't too thrilled about it but it could have been my choice of fruit filling. Next time I will try different flavors.

I make tons of desserts and we eat half of it and I give the rest away, so  I can make something else because we've had enough. Welllllll...I made this cake exactly as the recipe says(which I rarely do)and needless to say my husband and I ate the whole pan full......yuuuummmy! Since the first one the next was spice cake and apple Awesome! and 3 more new one all good. Much better than dump cake which I find tooo sweet.

I am not sure what I did wrong but I used a jelly roll and it overflowed. The cake did not look like the picture after it was done.  May try it in a 9 x 13 pan next

Wanted to do this as muffins, but was not enough batter for 24 regular sized muffin cups.  So I stretched the batter with a mixture of 8 oz. of cream cheese, 2 more eggs, and about 1/2 cup gran. sugar.  Also toasted the almonds before putting them on.  If you do it this way, put the cherries on the bottom or in the middle of the muffin cups, as they tended to slide off the top.  Otherwise, it was quite nice.

My husband really enjoyed this.  I liked the idea of it, but didn't really like the use of a cake mix.  It was too light tasting and a bit too sweet almost to be a coffeecake.  Also, do not apply glaze until ready to serve as cake & almonds will become a bit mushy if it is applied sooner.

As others have noted, this is a good basic recipe that can be modified to fit what you have in your kitchen!  I had sour cream and fresh cherries to use and found this recipe.  Instead of canned cherries, I used the fresh cherries I had (pitting them took the most time of all to complete this).  I used light sour cream and walnuts, instead of almonds because that's what I had.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract in the icing and skipped the dash of oil.  As a quick cake, when you don't have time to start from scratch, this is great.  It's delicious!

i messed this one up by using fat free sour cream, all egg whites, and a light cake mix.  i don't think there was enough fat to hold it all together - it took especially long to cook, and even so only the outside edges were done when we cut into it, and the middle was soup.  obviously my fault, but to anyone else in an endless quest to lighten up dessert, there must be sommmmme fat in this recipe for it to work!  the edges were yummy though :)

Really wonderful and so very easy to make.  I didn't have enough sour cream so made up the difference with mayo (and both were "light").  Worked great!  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing.

This is a very good recipe - good for company as well.  Adding a teaspoon or two of cinnamon to the batter lessens the cake mix taste quite a bit.  I was hoping for a coffee cake a bit more dense, but I will definitely make this one again and try other fillings as well.

Definitely decent for a quick breakfast.  I had a white cake mix that I needed to use up, so decided to make this for my family.  It was pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  I had made it previously as directed and it was WAYYYYY too sweet with the icing.  This time I used 1 cup powdered sugar and a little bit of almond extract and milk.  I drizzled over it and it was still awfully sweet.  Still, it was super fast to throw together, and would be good if you had to run out to a potluck, etc.

This recipe is so easy & delicious. I took it to work & was mobbed for the recipe. I remembered it off the top of my head---it was that easy! My husband asked me to make it at home since I didn't have any left from work. He went crazy over it. Definitely a keeper!

This was very easy to make! I made it for Christmas morning to go with a breakfast casserole and yogurt & fresh fruit parfaits. While it was good, I found it a bit too sweet as a coffee cake. It would be good in a pinch in the future but not sure I would elect to make it on a regular bases.

I used lemon cake mix because it's what I had on hand so that may have been the problem, but this tasted like a cake version of fruit loops.  It was still good in a strange way but definitely can't be called a coffee cake.

This is more cakelike, but good for what it is - quick, easy, and satisfies a sweet tooth.  I made mine with apple filling and added a bit of cinnamon to the  top before baking and to the glaze; topped with toasted walnuts.  It took about 40 minutes to cook in my 13X9 baking dish.  Husband gave it 5 stars, and I gave it 3, so we settled for 4.

Super recipe, quick to make & bake. Made the topping a little different using 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, a scant 1/2 t. of almond extract with the 2 T. of milk, then put it in a Ziploc, snipped one corner, and drizzling it was a "piece of cake".  And, added a little more cherry pie filling. Can use the remaining for a small coffee cake.  Oh, sprinkled a handfull of sliced almonds over it before drizzling. Might toast them next time.  Purchased a Walmart shallow, non-stick roaster, 15 x 10 x ? which worked great, plus has metal handles--great for transporting.  All the other ideas by those who have rated this recipe really helped me,too. Want to use other pie fillings for this great recipe.

Made this last night, left out the oil and added some almond extract to the icing and the cake batter and it was wonderful. Only problem I had was that I took it out of the oven at about 22-23 minutes and the bottom was very very browned on 1 side, but that was probably due to my crappy old oven.

Good - I made my own cherry sauce from canned cherries.  Good flavor.  Scored less becasue I think the best would have more homemade flavor and texture, but it was good for an easy recipe.  The bottom of the cake was wet the second day - fridge it to avoid that problem.

I used this recipe to use up leftover cherry and pineapple glaze from a ham. I already had all the ingredients and I skipped the glaze. It turned out well.

For such a simple recipe, the result is amazing! Try adding 1 tsp of cinnamon for a slightly different flavor.

This was pretty good. I added the topping that someone else suggested. Next time I will add twice the amount. It was good though. Not nearly as sweet as I though it would be from the reviews. It was great with milk.

This is a great and super easy recipe.  It would be great with other pie fillings too.....apple, blueberry or another mixed berry.  I used yellow cake because thats what I had on hand and since I didn't have the almonds I skipped it and it was still fabulous!  Especially served warm!

This recipe had mixed reviews and to be honest I don't know where the raves came from!  It was just OK in my book.  I used the jelly roll pan...wasn't really a coffee cake but not really a cake, either.  Tasted OK but was just disappointing.  Added some almond extract to the glaze

I thought this recipe was very good and even my children ate it (they don't like trying new things).  I was amazed at how easy it was to prepare and had a very nice flavor to it.  I would definitely recommend this recipe!

I made  this tonight as my French Vanilla cake mix was about to expire. Know that this recipe is identical to one on the Duncan Hines site. I didn't have ready made pie filling so I made some out of a jar of morano cherries from Trader Joe's. I drained the juice from the jar and added two large tablespoons of sugar and 4 T. of cornstarch, as I didn't have arrowroot for thickening. Brought it to a boil, threw in the cherries and boiled for a minute, and it was fine. I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the filing.  For the cake, I only had a 1/4 cup of sour cream, so I added almost 3/4 c. of plain yogurt and added 4 T. of whipping cream to make one cup. Because I'm at high altitude, I added 1/4 c. of flour to the mix, before combining everything. It worked out great! Like many others, I added 1/2 t. of almond to the glaze, which improves the flavor, greatly. Very good, I will make it again, but I won't use canned filling. I do think it doesn't taste all that good {the filling}.

This coffeecake turned out fantastic!  The recipe as is turns out to be incredibly easy and delicious, however, lends itself to a host of yummy variations.  I used a cherry chip cake mix instead of a white, used fat-free plain yogurt instead of the sour cream and sugar-free cherry pie filling and it still tasted rich and full of cherry flavor with less fat and sugar overall.  DH and his range buddy devoured half of this in one sitting!  I love how quickly it goes together with everyday pantry items and turns out looking like a posh bakery find.  Will definitely be making this again!

I did add 1 tsp almond flavor, am sure almost any light cake mix would work. It is fabulously flashy, makes a great impression. I am equally sure any other fruity pie filling would work as well. I used a larger can of filling, because that is what I had, and it was a bit moist, BUT everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

This was way too sweet for my taste.  The cake mix makes this extremely sweet and I only made half of the powdered sugar drizzle frosting.  It would have been  much too sweet without the frosting as well.
