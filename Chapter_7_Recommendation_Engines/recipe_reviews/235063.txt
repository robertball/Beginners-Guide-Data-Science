This was great.  I made this on a whim.  I was looking for a different recipe and I saw this.  I used a Hershey Special Dark bar because I am cheep and it is half the price of Baker's chocolate.  It worked fine.  The "pound" cake that I bought was only 10 ounces (what's up with that?) so I cut things back a bit.  I think that I could easily have made two of the smaller cakes with this recipe.  It was very easy and it looked and tasted great.  Everyone enjoyed it.
