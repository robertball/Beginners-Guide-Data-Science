I made this for Easter Breakfast and my family raved about it!  We are always looking for new traditions and this breakfast casserole made the cut.  One recommendation...we went for the Grand biscuits, but they tend to be a little denser and larger than, say a Pillsbury flaky biscuit.  As a result, the middle of the casserole was not thoroughly cooked.  Some loved the doughy texture--but I'm a perfectionist.  It will be on the table next Easter morning (if not sooner)!

Nice recipe!  Have made it a few times and haven't had a problem.  Although we do like our ham shredded rather than chopped and we prefer to have our biscuits laying flat rather than points upward.  Really good taste and quite different for our family and friends.  Thanks

This was wonderful!  I had my doubts, but I had all the ingredients on hand except for apple pie spice.  I subbed cinnamon and it was excellent!  We had for dinner and tasted great, but would make an even better breakfast being as it is a little sweet.  We loved it and will make again.

Fabulous taste, tho I would have called it a casserole, not a coffeecake.  Everybody loved it, but next time I'm only going to glaze 1/2 of it.  The kids liked the flavor before the glaze but not after.   I'll definitely make this again.

This was delicious except for the biscuit dough which turned to goopy balls of dough.  I didn't think the dough added to the dish, so I made it a second time and left out the biscuits and the family raved about it.  The flavors are terrific (buy expensive high-quality syrup-it's worth the price difference in taste).  You could make biscuits seperately and spoon this dish over them if you want the bread component, but it tastes delicious without it!

I really liked this for a morning breakfast treat. Sweet but yet satisfying with the ham.  My roommates loved it as well.

Yummy! I love the maple flavor mixed with the ham. I only had one little piece of biscuit in the very middle that was a little raw; all the rest were golden brown and yummy. Soft and flavorful and didn't take that long to make! I used whiskey instead of bourbon on the glaze, and had to use a lot more powdered sugar to thicken it. All in all a very tasty surprise for our Valentine's Day breakfast!

This was ok.  The biscuits in the middle of the pan were doughy (baked it for more than 45 minutes) and they didn't seem to add anything.  If I make this again I'll leave them out and serve them on the side.  The ham, apple and maple flavors were very good together.  I had some leftovers and added cheese to it, it was good that way too.  I didn't have apple pie spice so I substituted it with cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.

We didnt care for this. I had high hopes as it sounded like something great for brunch. Too many flavours going on. I wont waste my time making it again.

I read this having left over good French bread but not biscuits.  I decided I could add a little butter to the top since bread is much lower in fat than biscuits.  I was concerned that the biscuits rising held it together and my change might need 2 eggs.  My husband thinks this is better than turning older bread into French toast and can't wait to try it with biscuits.  I will also try the sauce next time.

This was good, but VERY sweet.  It reminded me a lot of sticky buns.  Not a coffee cake at all, but a nice change of pace from the usual casseroles and egg dishes.

Good, but not great and not worth the playing around with size of biscuit pieces, temp of oven, and baking time to get the center to cook through and not be doughy.
