It was simple to whip up and made the whole house smell wonderful. A great treat for the jerky lovin man in your house, kids loved it too! The taste was so rich and flavorful. A great way to get rid of those darn rump roasts.

This is a great recipe. If you like the flavor of Teriyaki Jerky add teriyaki sauce to this recipe.

Personally I used Top Round. I found it pre-thin cut at the Commissary on base. I dont know if you can get it like that at a regular grocery store but it works great and the meat isnt as fatty.

It is really good. For more flavor just add garlic powder, onion powder, basil. Just use your imagination and spices.

This recipe as is was very very good. But the next time I will cut back on the sugar. My Boy Scouts loved it. So did my family. Just a little to sweet for my taste but so easy to make. I will certainly do this again. The nice thing is its not as salty as the packaged mixes.

Moose meat soaked in the  Soy sauce for a few minutes makes a huge difference. We tried 3 different types of soy sauce as well.  Add a sprinkle of Garlic salt or onion salt changes everything! GO WILD... literally! lol ;) Jerky doesn't last long in our house. :D

TASTES LIKE BEEF!!!  I marinated sliced moose rump roast for 5 hours and dehydrated for about 12 hours and it turned out nice and chewy.  I added garlic powder and chili pepper flakes to make it sweet and spicy. I don't like much hickory so I only added about 9 drops which didn't really taste at all.  The recipe calls for 4 fluid ounces of liquid smoke which seems like too much for me.
