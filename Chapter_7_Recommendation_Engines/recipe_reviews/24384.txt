Couldn't taste anything but the ketchup. Might as well skip the other ingredients and pour ketchup on your salad if that's what you're into.

I have made this 3 times and Iam finally rating this.This is excellent made exactly according to recipe. My whole family loves this. I am making it again today :o) .... note: "chilli sauces" vary widely from one brand to another. I use a jelly-like sauce that comes in a tube in the salad section of a higher-end grocery store. I bet had I used something else it would taste quite different.

This was just like fry sauce--like when you mix the packets of mayo and ketchup together at a fast food restaurant!  Great for fries, bad for salad.

This dressing is absolutely delicious!  Unsure why another reviewer feels like it tastes only like ketchup because the batch I made certainly doesn't.  Made this according to the recipe and it's wonderfully tangy!

Was browsing salad dressings today, stumbled  across this one, and am I glad I did.  I haven't had Russian salad dressing in so many years that I'd forgotten about it, and it's never offered at restaurants any more.  This is tangy, smooth, and just crazy good.  Thanks Ken, this was a great find today, really enjoyed it.

I wanted something different to use for hamburger sliders with cheddar so made this after reading reviews.  It wasn't spicey enough so added a TBS of grated horseradish and 1/4 tsp of dry mustard. It was great!

I tarted this up a bit (half a teaspoon or so of hot paprika and literally two drops of Worcestershire sauce), but it's also delicious just as written.

Instead of chopping the onion, I grate it: Easier, faster, and no bits of raw onion in your dressing.

It's also low(ish) in carbs because I make it with the Heinz Reduced-Sugar Ketchup.

As soon as I read the ingredients I saw what the problem was:
too much ketchup; just reduce the ketchup and for lots of
flavour add more onion and even garlic if you like it

Simple to make and pretty good; however, be careful with the vinegar.  Half a tablespoon would have been plenty.  I had to add more mayonnaise and ketchup to deal with the overly vinegary flavor.

I absolutely loved this! It’s good as  written, but even better with one small clove of  minced garlic. Delicious. I  could drink it! Wonderful  on  a Reuben.

Tangy dressing that I made for a green salad to go with a Russian soup, but I think it would be better over a shrimp or crab salad.  It also was good as a sandwich spread.

This could not be easier to make and is tasty.  Plus, you can add seasoning and other ingredients - pickle relish, garlic. etc. - to suit your own tastes. It helps to make it an hour or so ahead to allow time for the flavors to blend.

I've made this a number of times, and the taste if perfect each time.  The only change I made was to add 1 tablespoon of relish.  Because it is homemade, I can make the quantity I need, so I double this.  I always felt that I ran out quickly when I used the bottled dressing.  Thanks for submitting this recipe.

I loved this simple recipe! I made it for The Moscow Slow Cooker Chicken recipe on this site. I used light mayo and it turned out amazing! I am already making more for salads and sandwiches.

Added some cajun spice instead of salt/pepper for a little more kick.  Mo better.
