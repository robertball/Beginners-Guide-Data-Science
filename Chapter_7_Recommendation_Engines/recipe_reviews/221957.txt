Very easy.  I didn't have beef drippings, so used margarine, and used water and Better than Bullion for the beef broth.  Takes 5 minutes, and was good with the Beef and Roasted Red Pepper Sandwiches I made it for.  I ended up with more than I needed, so I just tossed the remainder in a soup I'm putting together for the crock pot.  If you added more flour, this would also make some beef gravy.  Thanks for the recipe!

A ribeye prime rib roast will render a lot of fat out. Not wanting to use that much fat, I lifted the meat out of pan and poured all the drippings into a tall narrow plastic cup. I was able to ladle the fat off very easily. I then used just two tbls of the fat (discarding rest) in a skillet and proceeded to follow this recipe. I only used one can of good beef broth as I had a lot of meaty drippings despite having gotten rid of all the fat (about a cup or more!). The results were magnificent and still rich and decadent despite losing all that fat. It made an ample amount of the most delicious "jus" you've ever tasted. Not a real thick gravy, not a real thin pure jus either, but fantastic nonetheless.

Made this for New Years Day dinner w/Chef John's Prime Rib recipe......it was fantastic!!!  Word to the wise tho....I keep a baking stone in my oven and it retained too much heat and my roast came out Medium instead of Med-Rare.  Lesson learned!! Just gives me an excuse to try it again tonight!!  This Au Jus was delicious with the roast and I will be making it also tonight  ;-)  Thanks Chef John!!!!

When my six year old finished his prim rib he picked up his Au Jus sauce bowl and drank it, then said "mom, can I have more of this soup?" Everyone laughed and laughed, awesome moment. Thank you Chef John!

This is delicious and simple to make.  I was cooking a nice prime rib and I hadn't any au jus packages and so I went to the internet to see what I could find.  This was better than any package and it is my go to recipe now.  I use the beef broth in the carton.  What I don't use I freeze in 1 cup tupperware for use another day.

We made this for roast beef sandwiches. We didn't have beef drippings so we just used the same amount of butter instead and it still came out great.

Easy, solid recipe. I didn't have to add many seasonings, as the meat drippings from my roast beef were very flavorful. I did deglaze with a splash of sherry before adding beef stock, threw in a pinch of thyme, finished with a tbsp of butter. I wasn't sure if I wanted to skip the roast and just drink the jus!

A true au jus does not have flour in it. But that being said this is wonderful for dipping sandwiches. Mad Chef John's Prime Rib and having French dip sandwiches for lunch today. I did add a bit of herbs du provence I had made for the roast. Yummie!!!!!!!

I hate gravy.  As a result, I have never made it.  Not once.  Not ever.  This year, I made it.  Using this recipe.  It was amazing, and it couldn't have been easier.  I used GF flour instead of regular all-purpose flour, and it still came out great.

Perfect accompaniment to our prime rib and Yorkshire pudding!  I did use a little more beef broth than called for but only because I had more people and I added a little extra beef drippings as well.  No salt added either.

Fabulous....used it with Chef John's prime rib and just to die for.  Got it nice and boiling hot to offset the room temperature beef.  Couldn't have been more perfect!

From the mouth of my 8 yr old, "This gravy is yummy gravy".  I thickened it for more of a gravy than Au Jus.  I also like using Cornstarch rather than flour.

Chef John, you rock!  This was easy peasy to make after roasting my prime rib, and it tasted wonderful!  I like a little zing in my au jus, so I added a dash of Worcestershire Sauce.  Otherwise, I treated this like gospel. So delicious!

I prepared this recipe for our immediate family gathering for Christmas, 2013. It served as both au jus for our prime rib and gravy for our garlic mashed potatoes. It's not a thick gravy, which is fine; as far as I know, au jus should be on the thin side, though the flour does provide a little body, which is nice. This one is smooth and easy and only needed a little salt and pepper. It's just what we had in mind.

I thought this was good.  I'm not a big fan of au jus but the other people thought it was great.  Tasting it on beef, I thought it was good.  Tasting it alone, I thought it was bland but again, I'm not a big fan of au jus. I just knew I had to make it for the meal I was serving so this recipe was great for that.

I used all the drippings, which was more than 1/4 cup, about 1 1/2 cups, so that means I need more flour and beef broth. I just eyeballed the consistency of the gravy and it was the best I've ever made. That recipe is a keeper! I didn't change anything but the amount. I got great compliments from my picky eater kids!

Easy and basic.  I made Chef John's Perfect Prime Rib, so I had glorious beef drippings to make this sauce with.  Mine didn't need any additional salt because my drippings had plenty.  People wanted to drink this!

Has decent taste but it's not au jus. It's more of a gravy. An au jus is just juice and has no flour

This is really, really good.  As true with so many of his recipes, Chef John did not disappoint.  I would; however, agree with the reviewer that noted this is more of a gravy over a true au jus.  That being said, the flavors are so fantastic that I'm going to try to make it next time w/out the thickening element because it was certainly an added star to our Prime Rib dinner.  (My one, minor complaint would be that because you're using the beef fat, it does congeal when it cools and gets a little "greasy" when heated up. But not a big enough complaint to deter us from making this a repeat in our house!)

This isn't what I think au jus is.  This came out as gravy.  I know how to make gravy.  Misunderstood I guess.

ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!  No Lie, this is the real deal here!   I made it EXACTLY as written, using the pan drippings from my prime rib and it was PERFECTION!   My ONLY  thing was that I felt like I should have used more salt, but that's TOTALLY ON ME!   :-)   It is so good, so easy to make, and, AGAIN,  Oh, so good!  I HIGHLY recommend that you try this recipe.    
As ALWAYS, Chef John NEVER disappoints !   Thanks Chef John; you've done it again

I made this more or less as specified in the recipe. I used beef bone stock that I made myself from bones from the butcher and a roast we had earlier, so the stock was REALLY good. I'm not sure if it was the bone stock or the recipe, but in any case it was terrific.

A simple recipe which was flavorful and smooth!  The consistency was more attuned to a gravy so I needed it a bit thinner for the au jus. I took a bit of beef stock, added some organic molasses and the prepared recipe (didn’t measure but needed only s small amt. so guesstimate would be 1/2 c. stock, 1 T. prepared recipe and about a teaspoon of molasses. Gave great color and still preserved the terrific flavor, yet was a thinner consistency for a French dip sandwich.

I'm sorry Chef John. All your recipes have been great, but I disagree with you on this one. There is no flour in au jous. That would make it a gravy.

Have to say this is a very tasty au jus...and super easy too. I made a prime rib roast for a special dinner last week (my first). It turned out pretty wonderful and gave me just enough drippings to use in the au jus base. I made my own decked-out mashed potatoes and Parmesan asparagus ~served the prime rib with the au jus and creamy hot horseradish and dinner was a hit! 
I appreciate this site so much--you can find find almost any recipe here and reviews/suggestions to help you out too!
Thanks all--and specially you Chef John!!

This was so flavorful. The Au Jus thickened just enough that we also used it as a gravy on our potatoes. I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Did exactly as written. It was good but needed a little stronger flavor to compliment the prime rib. I took the little bit of juice after cutting into the roast and added it to the mixture. Tasty!

Made this yesterday (as written) to serve with the "Foolproof Rib Roast".  Would definitely omit the salt because rib roast rubs in general are salty.  There was also a comment in the recipe to refer to the "footnote", but I couldn't find it.  Also didn't care for the "cloudy" look of the au jus--used to a clear one.  The taste over all was very good.  Next time will either reduce or eliminate the flour.  Overall though a very good recipe!!

Along with the standing rib roast this was beyond belief wonderful.  Selfishly of me, I’m glad I didn’t invite anyone to eat with us as we were able to make two meals out of it. I followed the recipe word for word and it turned out exactly as it was meant to. It was bursting with flavor and easy peasy to make.

I doubled the recipe since I made an 8lb roast and it was very greasy. I kept adding salt and pepper to cut through the greasy smell and taste but to no avail. I wish I had found my au jus recipe. I don't think I would do this one again.

Very good, very basic. For people who just want the simple flavor of the beef without any fancy "extracurriculars". The only trouble I had was that the flour and fat kind of bunched up into a few blobs before I added the broth. I was afraid that it would turn into a disastrous lumpy gravy. Maybe  there wasn't quite enough fat left in the pan? Anyway, once I added the broth and started whisking, the flour began to dissolve and everything turned out ok. The gravy got very positive reviews. Phew.

I made a prime rib roast using Chef John's 'Method X' recipe. The coating I used was the Garlic Prime Rib recipe from this website. This au jus was so good, yum! It went perfectly with the meat. Thank you, Chef John, for another fabulous recipe!

Super easy. Absolutely delicious!!! I added some dried minced onions and a 1 tsp more flour. Didn’t have enough for 2 cups of fresh broth from my brisket so i used 1cup fresh and 1cup of Swanson Beef Broth. This is the best recipe I have found for Au Jus. Thank you Chef John for sharing

This was the hit of our Prime Rib dinner.  Instead of 1/4 cup of drippings I used 1 cup of drippings and reduced the amount of beef broth required.  Glad I have left over.  It goes great on left over mashed potatoes,

Made this AuJus this evening. We loved this recipe. Made no adjustments.  I had everything left over from Christmas dinner. Prime Rib. I did make my own baguettes for the sandwich. I highly recommend you to give this recipe a try.

Well there were no high fives on this particular day. My au jus looked more like Turkey gravy. Luckily I pulled out the McCormick that I had hanging around in my cabinet.

My husband, who is the chef in this household, could not stop complementing me on this jus. I’ve never made something like this, but it’s super easy to do. I used prime rib scraps for “drippings”, frying them in a cast iron skillet since we were smoking the prime rib on the Traeger, then added some beef concentrate for a little stronger flavor. Delicious!

I made it exactly as written and it was very good. Two comments though. The recipe refers to a footnote which I could not find. So I recommend watching the video on how to make it. In the video it explains that the 1/4 fat drippings is in addition to the meat juices in the pan which is not clear in the given directions or ingredients. I think it would make quite a difference in the outcome. If you make it according to the recipe as stated, the outcome is more gravy-like as some other reviewers have stated.  It was good, but not as good as it would have been had I made it according to the video.

This was very easy and turned out fantastic! My husband and kids were raving about it! While it's very hard to resist the urge to open the oven and sneak a look, it is SO worth it. 

I was very hesitant about this particular recipe but extremely happy with the outcome. Don't worry- Your money and time will not be wasted!

I followed it with a 3.5lb beef tender roast and my kids, who do not eat any type of “gravy looking” sauce, devoured it!!  I have NEVER attempted anything like that and if I can successfully do it, anyone can!!  Great step by step and easy to follow directions

Used a bone in 4 lb roast.  I did leave it cook for 5 extra minutes at 500 (25 min total) as we like our meat a little more well done.  It turned out perfect, delicious!  Made the au jus as well.  great meal!

I have a couple of questions.  I have a convection oven.  If I use that feature do I  have to change anything about Chef John's instructions?  And I am having the butcher cut the bone off and tying them back on.  Will that change anything?

i used beef lard rather then drippings which in retrospect was probably a little heavy handed. probably would cut the beef lard down to match the flour next time, 1.5 T. I also used bone broth that i made from beef marrow bones and the texture was silky and intoxicating. and i supplemented the beef flavor that my bone broth was lacking with beef base and the finished product was really perfect. so good.

I made this to dip our roast beef sandwiches in but personally we, my husband & I, thought it was too thick. It made a great gravy.  Next time I will just use a bullion cube & water & maybe  some gravy master & pepper.

Very simple to make and I loved that there was some minimal texture to this au jus- so unlike the watery kind I usually am served.  Excellent flavor!  You can't go wrong with this one.

GREAT recipe. Have to be really careful monitoring the oven heat as it makes a difference. I was lucky to have a meat thermometer because the temp rose much more quickly... I ended up taking it out in less than half the time.  I would maybe add garlic by making slits around the roast and sticking full cloves into each for even more flavour.

Fantastic! Wonderful! Amazing! I could almost drink this when no one is looking. :) You have to make this when you bake your prime rib per Chef John's killer equation-based recipe/technique.

I used butter because I didn't have enough drippings and added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce to it. Simple but good.

Made this with Chef John's prime rib and it was delicious!  Although it was more of a gravy than au jus to me but still fabulous.  I used about 1 tsp of salt.  I didn't have beef broth so used 2 bouillon cubes  with 2 cups of water.  Can sub beef drippings for butter in the same amount.

This is  especially good with a prime rib that has been seasoned well and has garlic inserted throughout.  We used a pre-seasoned prime rib roast from Costco this Christmas. This  au juice recipe was delicious, very easy and a definite keeper.   I strained the juice before serving to remove the clusters of seasoning and garlic pieces..

Perfect, even after I had to modify.  I was out of beef broth so used 1 cup of chicken  broth and 1 cup Merlot.  The Fond, juices and fat were enough to give it a very beefy flavor.  Everyone loved it.  After the beef was gone I used the leftovers to make a gravy by mixing with a bit more roux.  I use this method for all my gravies now.  Super simple, super tasty.

It was amazing!! I made an 8 lb prime rib roast for Christmas Day.  Saved the fat drippings and made this lovely Au-Jus tonight.  Used it to make french dip sandwiches from the leftover roast pieces.  I have saved this recipe and will use it from now on.  Thanks Chef John!!

It is a Christmas tradition in my home to serve Standing Rib Roast for dinner. I have tried many different au jus to go with the roast, this was by far the easier and tastiest. This is a keeper, thank you for sharing!

Made as an accent to the Chef John's Perfect Prime Rib... was simple to make (ensure you have the right type of roaster to use in the oven and on the stove)...I substituted venison broth for the beef broth.... delicious!

I baked the custard.  Went exactly by the instructions.  The pudding before the oven was delicious!  Then I baked it.  It wasn't as great afterwards.
