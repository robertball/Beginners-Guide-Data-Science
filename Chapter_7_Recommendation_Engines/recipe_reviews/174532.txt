This is a great, easy recipe. It doesn't need as long in the slow cooker as this recommends, because all the ingredients except the onion are already fully cooked! My big slow cooker was in use, so I made these on the stove top. I fried my onion (and a few cloves of garlic, because I love it) in a little olive oil, then added the rest of my ingredients, and simmered it on low for around 2 hours, uncovered, stirring periodically to help it reduce. I used Sweet Baby Ray's for my barbecue sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

Great with cornbread! I used Dark Red Kidney Beans (personal preference) and maple syrup and brown sugar in place of the molasses and added hot sauce to kick it up a little more. Almost like a meatless chili.

I had trouble finding the Wildfire BBQ sauce. When I looked online to see what it was about, I noticed it was on the spicy side so I used 1/2 Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and 1/2 Spicy Stubbs BBQ sauce. And then added a dash of liquid smoke to it. I don't think it turned out as good as it shouldv'e. Will have to try again if I ever find the real stuff. It was easy to do and had a nice kick to it, in comparison to normal baked beans.
