I used prepared hamburger patties to save time and it worked out great. I also used a paket of powdered onion soup since I couldn't find it in a condensed can version. This worked well too, just prepare the powdered soup with 3 cups of water instead of 4 and mix in all the other ingredients. Pour over the browned patties and simmer for 1/2 an hour Serve over rice and you have a good quick meal!

This was so good! My husband doesn't usually like things made with ground beef (salisbury steak, meatloaf) but he loved this!

I Liked this even better than my usual way of making this dish.  Next time I think I'll try adding egg to the meat instead of the soup because the patties just barely stayed together.  Great recipe!

I made this using dried onion soup mix. Added a clove of garlic to the meat mixture and some fresh chopped parsley. Added some mushrooms to the sauce. At first I thought the sauce was going to be awful. It was very tangy & salty. I added some brown sugar and after the sauce cooked for about 15mins the flavours came together and it was quite nice.

Delicious!! This is oh so flavorful and so quick and easy to make.  The sauce was very good also.  My husband and son really liked it, and that is saying something for my son, because he is a picky eater at times.  Thanks Pam for a great recipe!

I was a little leary of this when I saw the recipe... salisbury steak made me think of something I got in the lunchroom in gradeschool.  But this recipe was so easy to make, and tasted great.  My husband loved the sauce.  I will definately make it again!

This was pretty good.  Nice and quick.  Only complaint is that there was not nearly enough gravy!  Next time I will double the gravy.  Thanks for sharing!

My family just LOVED this recipe.  I have been searching for a great salisbury steak recipe for years, and this is finally the winner.  I had no problems finding the soup and I think it tastes a lot better with this canned soup than with other versions that call for the powdered soup mix, so its really worth the effort to find it.  Paired it up with green beans and mashed potatoes for a great family dinner!

This recipe was quick, easy and very tasty.  We could not find the condensed French Onion soup, so we dissolved some beef boulion cubes in water, added some onion flakes and onion salt.  Although it was not actually how it was suppose to be made, it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious!  I doubled it and made it with reconstituted dry onion soup mix.  Gravy turned out perfect!  My 5 yr old even ate this, and he normally won't take meat.

I doubled the recipe as I had more than four guests for dinner.  Everything turned out very well and the taste is very good, nothing overpowers anything else in this recipe.  This will be made again by our family!

Delicious! My whole family loved it. I've made salisbury steak before, but with mushroom soup, and they didn't like it as well. I will use just a little less worchestersire sauce next time, but other than that it was perfect!!

This recipe goes together very easily--good as a quick weekday meal.  My husband loved the sauce.  I thought it was a little sweet and may try using tomato paste next time.  Also the steaks are huge, so next time I'll make six instead of four.
