made it as directed.....except that I cooked the beans and carrots ahead of time and put aside.....mixed it all together for 10-15 minutes before serving....I never thought beans and carrots could taste SO good - two thumbs up on this one!

Hard to get my husband to eat green beans and carrots but he liked this dish. I did fry the onions in the same pan as I fried the bacon so the crumbles were an additional touch. I also used 1/2 tsp dried ginger instead of fresh. Will definitely add this to my favorite list.

I needed to bring a veggie dish to a dinner so I went out to the garden to see what was there. Carrots, green beans, kale, and onions. I didn't expect to find a recipe that included all three but there it was. It looks beautiful (I had purple as well as orange carrots) and tastes great! I did have to substitute homey for the agave syrup and added a lot more kale than called for, but this is going to be a staple. Oh, I included the bacon because, bacon!, and used sliced almonds. Each gave an added dimension to this dish.

To be honest, halfway into cooking this recipe I started thinking that it's probably a prank. The ingredients just didn't make sense to me. I'm glad to say I was wrong and it came out really good. I didn't add bacon and didn't feel it was needed. I also used about twice the amount of kale the recipe calls for. I sauteed the kale for a few minutes as I hate raw kale. I will definitely be making this again.

So good!  I steamed the green beans and carrots for less than 10 minutes to keep them firmer and with more color.   I used powdered ginger.  I used a couple of tablespoons of yellow onion since that was all I had.  Skipped the bacon and sprinkled a bit of tarragon during the final toss in the skillet! I will definitely be doing this again.

This was really good, and wife raved about it and me! LOL. Kids ate it too. Great way to get the kale into us/them. Thank you for the recipe.

I didn't make any changes but in future I would add a bit more Kale.    I made this for my supper club and it was a hit.  Since I had to transport this dish, I cooked the carrots & beans ahead of time, put them in a bowl.  I cooked the bacon, and  chopped  the remaining ingredients, placed them in separate containers so that I could finish this dish later at the same time as the main meal was being prepared.   I did reheat the carrots & beans at the time of putting it all together.

My family liked this recipe.  I didn't have green onion so I chopped up some vidalia.  I skipped the bacon and added slivered almonds instead of ground almonds.  I recommend doubling the kale.  I will make it again.
