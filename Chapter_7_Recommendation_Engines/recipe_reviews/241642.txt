I originally posted this recipe but in the 9 years between when I posted it and when it got published, I changed it quite a bit and like my new version much better. Here's a summary:  Double all ingredients except brown sugar, make it 1/2 cup total.   Change cereal to 2 cups All Bran and 2 cups Bran Flakes (don't crush the flakes) Add one small mashed banana (preferably previously frozen so it's really soft)   Add milk to cereal mixture at the very end so that the milk doesn't get absorbed.  Be generous with the milk, I actually use 2 1/4 cups instead of 2 cups.  Also add the liquid ingredients first into the cereal/milk mixture and THEN pour into the dry ingredients.   Bake 24 mins at 375 F.  If you don't have a banana, a 1/3 cup plain applesauce also works well.

This recipe is perfect for me because lately I have had a lot of All Bran cereal to use up, AND it is the perfect way to use up a cup of milk when it is starting to get old. The method of curdling the milk with lemon juice is very practical and substitutes for buttermilk. Also, it only uses 1 egg. which is good because I buy the expensive cage free eggs and then tend to ration them because I am poor. I have made them with raisins, I have also made them with mulberries from a tree in my neighborhood which was also good. These muffins taste best fresh, so if I am not feeding them to others immediately I put the remainder of the baked muffins in my freezer and take them out the evening before when I want one or two in the morning. If they aren't given enough time to cook then they tend to fall apart. But when the cooking time is right and everything goes as planned they are very good. Really good cheap recipe that doesn't require fancy ingredients. I have made it at least about 4 times now.

I've made these twice. The first time with cocoa powder and the second without (didn't have any on hand). The cocoa powder makes a difference. I also added chocolate chips instead of raisins (both times). Milk chocolate chips are definitely better than semisweets

I am not a big fan of bran muffins, but, my husband likes them so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  I am so glad I did because these were very tasty!   They are reminiscent of New England brown bread.  They were very moist and had a lot of flavor.  I used bran flakes and crushed them with my hands into tiny pieces and then measured my 1-1/2 cups of cereal.   I also used 1/4 tsp of cinnamon instead of the 1/8 tsp, but, prepared everything else as is. Make sure you use the dark brown sugar that is listed in the recipes instead of light brown because it gives you a light molasses flavor that you will not get if you use light brown sugar. I filled them slightly over 3/4 full which turned out perfect for my muffin tin because they didn't rise very much.  I will definitely be making these again.

These were good.  I couldn't detect the cocoa or spices, but I'm sure those helped disguise the bran taste = good thing  :D  'Only used half cup sugar & it was enough.

Not a great fan of bran muffins usually but gave this one a try and even though I am not an everything chocolate lover had to say they were excellent.  Would make them again and again.

These are very good. I made them using whole wheat flour and 1/2 C of egg whites instead of the egg.

Yummy is right! Made these this morning. I've been wanting bran muffins lately and came across this recipe. I did make a few changes. I used 1/2 c WW flour and half AP flour. Coconut oil instead of veg oil. 1/3 c brown sugar and 2 T molasses, I wanted more of that molasses flavor :) I think 3T would have been a little better. Great recipe. May have had less raisins than was called for I didn't measure them because I was low just dumped them in. Thank you!

Excellent muffins.  Nice and moist and delicious.  I made them because my little girl doesn't get enough fibre and it's impossible to get her to eat bran cereal.  I added some chocolate chips, and she gobbled up these muffins.  The cocoa and spice make them irresistible.

Since I was using extra large muffin tins, I doubled the recipe, substituting self rising flour, omitting baking soda, baking powder and salt. The muffin batter was a little runny so I added an extra 1/2 cup sifted self rising flour. They turned out just perfect! Delicious and healthy!

Delicious but just a few changes. Didn’t have any cloves and used nothing as a substitute. I threw in a few tbsp of chia seeds and added a few dark chocolate chunks on the top! So good!

Excellent muffins! I didn't have cocoa powder so I substituted powdered baking chocolate.  I also doubled the spices to 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cardamom, 1/4 tsp. cloves.  I didn't have raisins so I used craisins infused with pomegranate juice.      I used whole wheat flour as that is what I had.  They definitely taste better when they are hot out of the oven with a pat of butter.  I will make them again and probably try the orange juice infused craisins.

Kellogg's All-Bran has all but disappeared from my local grocery shelves and has been replaced by All-Bran Buds.  Kellogg says you can substitute these on a one-for-one basis for the traditional All Bran - but you can't.  1-1 substitution leads to muffins that are exceptionally dry and dense and requires the increase in liquids by about 25%.

For something a bit different, try adding 1½ tsp of Cardamom and 2 tsp of orange extract.

These turned out beautifully! They were more moist than other bran muffin recipes I have tried. I normally never make changes to recipes the first time I try them, but I did one small substitute in this one. Instead of 2/3 cup brown sugar, I used 1/3 cup b. Sugar and 1/3 cup honey. Best muffins I have ever made! Will make again soon.

These are delicious. I omitted the cloves because I don’t care for cloves and used skim milk. I got great results.
Will definitely make them again.

I made these twice today; the family demolished the first batch and I wanted to have some for the Man's breakfast at 4:30 a.m. tomorrow.  The second time I waited for the cereal to get saturated with the milk mixture, then beat it into the oil and sugar mixture, then folded in the dry ingredients and raisins.  I also used muffin papers although they always fight with me.  I wanted to get rid of the cereal pieces, and it worked like a charm.  They were also lighter in texture and prettier!

These muffins are light, delicious.  We couldn't taste the bit if chicolate in them but it did serve to enhance the spices.  I will definitely make these again!
