I have made this so many times. It is so easy.  Cheap dill pickle slices make it a lot cheaper. I also have use dill spears. They work great also.

Scaled this down to 12 servings and used a 16-oz jar of dill hamburger chips.  Gotta tell you, this surprised the heck out of me because we REALLY liked them.  They're sweet, but you don't lose the dill flavor either, a really good balance of sweet-dill.  Don't add any vinegar to this because you don't need it.  Just drain the pickles, add the seasonings as listed, give this a day in the fridge shaking/turning upside down occasionally, and you'll have delicious juice in the pickle jar...patience will pay off!  You can't buy a jar of pickles that tastes like this, and it just doesn't get much easier to mix up a batch.  Going into my Favorites Collection.

I pour all pickle into a large colander (sp)draining all juice off. Towel dry whole pickle, cut into irregular pieces.  Layer 4 #sugar, sliced pickle,1/4 cup pickling spice till "dirty" jar is full and pour 1 cup white vinegar over. Seal tightly and place in a large bowl on top. Invert daily for 14 days. Ready to eat.  GREAT for neighbor gifts of 1 pt. each. Seal and tie a big bow on top and recipe. They love it.

This is one of those recipes that will stay  in your memory forever. It was one of our families most cherished delectables during Christmas time. And, if it was not on the decked-out table at our Christmas dinner, then somebody was in major trouble. A crispy, crunchy,  overly (but deliciously) sweet, and delightful compliment to any meal anytime.

I wasn't really sure what to expect with these since I had never heard of candied pickles before. That being said curiosity won out and I decided to give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised and very happy with the results. Some of the sugar is still dissolving at the moment but I gave it a little taste test before I stashed them in the fridge and they already tasted great before they were even cold or fully complete. Very good and I will surely be making these again. Thank you so much for a great new recipe.
