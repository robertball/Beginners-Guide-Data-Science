Honestly, I don't think I'll make it again, but I still give it a few stars because: It was very easy to make - one star. The leftovers were edible enough - two more stars.

This was just okay. Nothing special.  The sauce didn't turn out very well. However I may try it again. Perhaps just not my day!!

I thought it was a great dish especially in the summer. It was light and refreshing. I made it exactly the way the recipe was written. Can't wait to make it again.

I used crushed pineapple instead of pineapple chunks and it worked just fine.

stars for how good this was at cleaning out my veggie drawer and everything else i keep on hand. i did think after i tried this that it needed a sour to compliment the sweet and it was a little bland so i added a few shakes of franks red hot and that helped alot. ill make this again. ps there is no colorful burst of fruity goodness.

I made this dish last night.  I had everything but the green pepper (which I don't like anyway).  It is very quick and easy to make.  I drizzled some Sesame Oil over the top after I stir fried everything and mixed it in and it added some great flavor.  My family (including the 2 year old)loved it and I will be making it again.
