Unfortunately these dry out quickly but that is because of the cream of tartar. I find cream of tartar works better with white flour rather than whole wheat.
My opinion only - perhaps others had better luck.

Moist, light, fluffy and they definitely do rise up very nicely - everything you want in a biscuit!  I love the the flavor the wheat flour brings.  I wanted these to be a little sweeter so I used 3 Tbsp. of sugar and added 2 Tbsp. of honey.  I also used 1/2 cup of Land O Lakes lite butter and 1/4 cup of butter flavored shortening.  I cut the milk down to 3/4 cup and added the egg to it.  I didn't have to knead it more than a few times.  The dough was very easy to work with on a well floured surface and easy to cut with a biscuit cutter. During baking I brushed the tops with melted butter.  These are so good with melted butter!

Beautiful presentation.  I liked the idea of adding the whole wheat flour in expectation these will be better for my family. I didn't use a biscuit cutter, I just patted these into a big square, cut them in to 9 squares, then separated them a little. This was a very nice, wonderfully light and fluffy biscuit. They were moist but crumbled when I tried to split them. A bit dry the second day, these did not keep well. Nice flavor, nice texture, much like the "kentucky biscuits" in texture but much lighter and fluffier. These were great with sausage gravy. These were very wet when I turned them out to the floured board, hard to knead they were too wet and mushy, but I just used lots of flour on my hands and after the 15th knead, I patted this into a large square. This gave me 9 biscuits the perfect size for my DH and son to make a breakfast sandwich. My hubby said these were okay but said he preferred the fluffy "canned" ones I usually use (actually frozen southern style with the poppin fresh boy in the blue bag). I really liked these and would make them again. Thanks Ruth, these were really nice and I enjoyed making and eating them.

These biscuits are fantastic! Instead of wheat flour, I just use 3 C of unbleached, all purpose flour, sifted and sub buttermilk for the milk. They are a hit everytime they come out of the oven!

These were wonderful! I kneaded the dough about 10 times and subbed half the butter with pure lard. Since the lard didn't have salt, I felt it needed a little more so next time I'll add a half tsp.  I also halved the sugar and omitted the cream of tartar simply because I didn't have any. Great recipe, thanks!

I used oat flour instead of the wheat - it's what was on hand.  Simple and so flavorful!  This is a keeper!

Wonderful. I made these for our Christmas morning breakfast and my family said they were just the best ever. Love adding the whole wheat flour, gives it an interesting texture. Flavor was wonderful, unlike the traditional white flour biscuits, my family prefers whole wheet items better. Thanks for the recipie.

These are incredibly simple to make and use ingredients I always have on hand. They are light and fluffy, though some were a bit lopsided after baking. Sky-high definitely describes these! I love the addition of the whole wheat flour. I'll definitely make these again!

Excellent recipe. Thank You

I only used 1/2 cup whole wheat but next time will go for the whole cup and I used  1 stick of butter and 1/4 cup shortening just because I tend to be frugal. :)

They came out high and fluffy

Killer recipe! I made them with all white flour(sifted) and only half a cup butter. Had to add a little more milk for everything to stick together. They came out super moist and (hopefully) with a little less fat.

Great idea but the wheat threw me off however, the teenager in the house ate 5 in one day.  Go figure??  I'm not a salt eater but I think this needed it and next time I will omit the wheat flour.

Best biscuits I've ever made. My dad always loved my biscuits. But I have to say that these definitely would wow him. They turned out light and fluffy with a nice light crunch. I didn't have whole wheat flour so I used all-purpose instead. I will definitely will be using this recipe from now on.

Ever since White Lily stopped making biscuit mix, I've been looking all over the place for a recipe that can compare.  This is the one.  I've already made three batches of these, and they disappear as fast as I can pull them out of the oven.  I did use all white flour, since that was all I had in the pantry, but otherwise, I didn't change a thing.

Light, flaky, and really tasty.  It's one of those recipes that you expect the creator to keep a secret.  I'm glad I finally found a recipe my whole family likes.  My son says, "They're even good cold!"  I did not have any cream of tartar on hand, but the biscuits were still great.

I didn't have the exact ingredients at home.  I used white flour, 1 stick of butter, and 2% milk.  The biscuits still came out great.

I made these exactly as the recipe says and they turned out light and flaky and picture perfect. I made a batch to go with home made soup and my teen-agers inhaled them. Delicious!

While delicious, mine look nothing like  the  picture.  Mine are  more scone-like.  I am eating one with  jam now, while  hot, very nice, but tomorrow morning  they will be dry and hard. I added some sour  cream to  replace the buttermilk  or milk.  (I also did not  put  in the cream of tartar, as I do not  like the taste  of it in the finished  baked good. ) Next time  I  will go  all white flour- I think the whole wheat  has a  lot to do with how  they came out.  Whole wheat is different miller to miller- Hodgson's Mill (what I had)  as opposed to King Arthur.

The taste was really good, but I didn't realize you needed to roll the dough 1" thick so I ended up with little, dry hockey pucks.

I have made this recipe several times now, with no modifications at all.  My family loves these biscuits, and can't seem to get enough of them (I have to double the recipe when I make it because my family ploughs through them too quickly).  We especially love to eat them as biscuits and gravy!  Yum!

These biscuits were the best I have ever made. Until now my biscuits always came out more like hockey pucks than anything edible. Since I found this recipe, I will not be making any other! Thanks!!
