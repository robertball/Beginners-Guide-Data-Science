Oh. My. Word. This was so good!  It's absolutely delicious--perfectly sweet, perfectly spiced, and just the right amount of zing from the orange! I used a few baby rainbow carrots, red pepper, and added some yellow squash that I needed to use up; but other than that, I kept everything else the same. It's great over rice or pasta, too. And not only is it delicious, but it's a really fast and easy dinner to make! Thank you for the recipe!

Love the flavor! I did not have cardamom so I left it out. I cooked the pork chops using the sous vide method: Applied the rub, put the chops in Ziploc bags, cooked at 140Â° for 2 hours and 15 minutes, then seared on both sides and drizzled with soy sauce and honey. I served it with homemade fried rice. It was excellent!

This was really good. The cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, and clove accented with a little orange peel make a nice, tasty accompaniment to the pork and vegetables.

I didn't have chops, but I had pork sliced for stir fry, and served with brown rice noodles instead of white rice. A nice change of pace!
