I liked this soup very much.. but I did use fresh carrots and fresh mushrooms. I cooked the carrots beforehand a bit before they went into the soup. One caveat... the recipe calls for 1T of garlic powder.   In most cases, 1/8t of garlic powder is equal to one clove so 1T is 24 cloves of garlic.   Way way way too much, so adjust that.    I think I used  1/4- 1/2t
