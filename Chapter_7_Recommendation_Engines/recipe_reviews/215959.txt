I just finished having this for dinner with garlic bread on the side! And boy was it good!  I failed to buy fresh herbs on my trip to the store, but the dried version was just fine.  Also, the store was out of manicotti, so I settled for cannelloni.  Due to personal preference, I used original Prego pasta sauce.   Thanks to those who suggested using a ziploc bag to fill the pasta and using fresh garlic instead of the powder.  Worked like a charm.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks Ernie!

yummmm!!!!! Thanks for this recipe! I did add fresh mushrooms as well, and I actually added ground beef. My hubby is a meat eater! I browned the ground beef and put it in with the sauce. Everyone loved it!

This tastes like a manicotti version of the "veggie lasagna florentine" recipe on this site.  Both are excellent vegetarian dishes.  I made a couple of changes:  to the ricotta mixture I sauteed the onion, garlic and also added 5 thinly sliced crimini mushrooms.  I also added some fresh basil.  I made the sauce using a can of tomatoes and a jar of strained tomatoes.  I added garlic, italian seasoning, parsley, basil, oregano, salt and pepper and 1/4 cup of water.  The sauce was quite watery, but it was perfect for the no-cook shells.  When it came out of the oven, the sauce was thick and the tubes were perfectly cooked.  I'll definitely make this again!  Thanks

This was delicious!  I used fresh spinach and added mushrooms, but kept everything else the same!  
I omitted the water, which I think was a mistake because I had a few noodles that weren't completely done.

Simple to prepare, and delicious.  I didn't change a thing.  Great way to sneak in some veggies, too.

This was very good and pretty easy.   I added crab to the ricotta mixture because I had some to use up.   I would make this again.

This turned out fantastic! I experimented a bit by adding finely chopped bacon to the spinach/ricotta mixture, and by sprinkling the top with italian seasoning prior to popping it in the oven. Delicious! Will definitely use it again.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it turned out great. The only change made was that I used dried onion flakes since I forgot to pick up an onion. I made it the night before to let the flavors blend and cooked the manicotti & shells 1/2 way before stuffing them. Everyone liked it.

So I changed this up a little...I boiled the noodles for a few minutes before cooking and didn't put the water in the bottom to cook. I also used alfredo sauce instead of red sauce. The filling was really good but I think it had too much spinach....next time I will use a bit less.

It's good.  Way too much sauce though.  You could get by with 1.5-2 jars max.  It was also missing something that I could not quite put my finger on.  I used fresh spinach and had a bit left over after I cooked it down for use.  The left over made for a good spinach omelette.

Stuff the uncooked shells, place them back in the plastic tray they came in, place in a zip-lock freezer bag and freeze. Fast easy delicious supper that's ready when you are especially if unexpected guests get invited to stay and share the meal.

Great meal for a big crowd.  Easy to make the day before and just slip in the oven an hour before serving time.  Everyone always enjoys this one!

Two quick tips: make sure you have oven-ready pasta shells. Secondly, I always put the cheese/spinach mixture into a plastic bag, cut one corner, and then pipe the mix into the noodles. It makes the hard part easy and less messy!
