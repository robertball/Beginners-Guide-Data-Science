I haven't made it recently but this is basically the recipe for my mother's signature chocolate cake. As  a child growing up on a hard-scrabble 160 acre homestead farm and beginning marriage during the depths of the Great Depression, she learned early to "waste not." She died in 2008 at age 95. Her chocolate cake with clabbered milk was one of her ways of using up everything. No raisins in her cake and she was a little heavier on the cocoa. She also added a small amount of red food color to make it darker. The daughters-in-law and granddaughters have tried to match Mom but they just can't quite emulate her magic. In her later years she added a simple powdered sugar frosting as a finishing touch. I commented once that I never remembered her putting frosting on the cake when I was growing up. In those years she was cooking for a husband and two growing sons, so she explained it quite simply, "They never lasted that long." Thanks for triggering a great memory. Galen

It was OK, but mine seemed a little dry & not very flavorful. It seemed like a lot of effort just to keep from throwing away one cup of milk.  I doubt that I will make it again, but maybe with some tweaking it could be a 5 star recipe.

I really like this cake! It  was easy to make. The only problem was that it needs more flavor!

This is a lovely cake, perfect with coffee! I love that it saves milk that would otherwise be poured down the drain. Thanks for the great idea!
