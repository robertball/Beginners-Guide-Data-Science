I made no changes, but it would be so easy to substitute almond milk for the regular milk.  I used 1% milk, no problem.  Also, I'm sure you could add more squash and get rid of the egg if you were making this vegan. Very tasty and moist.

Great taste. To use a whole kabocha, I doubled the recipe. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Came out great!
