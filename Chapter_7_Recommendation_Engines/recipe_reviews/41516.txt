This is a quick and easy spread to throw together for a get together and everyone always loves it.  I use whipped butter and it seems to come out a bit smoother.  I have also tried different spices and it still comes out great.  Sometimes I form the entire mixture into a ball and roll it in pecans.  This makes an easy cheese ball.

I used this as a substitute for Boursin. It wasn't exactly the same but still quite good. I piped it over cucumber slices and topped it with finely diced red bell pepper.

This is absolutely delicious melted on top of a grilled steak. I also use it in hot sandwiches. Sometimes we just eat it spread on Ritz crackers for a quick snack. Very yummy and easy to make.

This recipe is easy and tastes awesome! i didn't have any dill on hand (and I didn't feel like going back to the store for it). I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder. This spread was great over sliced french bread.

I followed the recipe to a tee, but the flavours just didn't go together.  The thyme was overpowering. If I make this again, I will experiment with seasonings that blend well.

very good.  does not taste like alouette or anything, but very good!  I would recommend using a little less butter and a little more cream cheese.  equal parts of both makes it quite buttery.

This was fantastic with sourdough bread. Im sure its great with any bread. Tastes like the butter spread you get at Spaghetti Warehouse. Wonderful!

Awesome recipe.  Tastes better than rondele garlic and herb. Did not change a thing. I will bring it to the next get together. Thanks for the recipe.

You need to try this, it is fantastic.
I used low fat cottage cheese once and that worked out very well for a low fat spread.

My husband loved it, I wasnt too thrilled with it though, but that is because i am not a fan of cheese balls

It was okay, but I expected more flavor.  It had more of a hint of flavor and a burst.

I made this dip for a poker party and served it with crackers. I found it to be attractive and tasty, yet many people did not seem to go for it. My husband didn't care for it at all. Still, I thought it was alright.

It was alright, but not something I would make again. The texture seemed to gritty to me from all of the spices and the flavor was only mediocre. I did follow the instruction exactly the first time, and then thought if I tinkered with it maybe something could come of it. In the end it's the texture from the amounts of dry seasoning that I don't like. Personally I've since found others that work better.

Delicious....used only 4 oz of reduced fat cream cheese, 2 tblspn of butter and halved all of the spices. I actually used this recipe in the Hot Spinach and Artichoke Dip on this site because it called for garlic and herb cheese spread and I didnt have it. This was perfect.

Too much butter IMO.  That was all I could taste.
