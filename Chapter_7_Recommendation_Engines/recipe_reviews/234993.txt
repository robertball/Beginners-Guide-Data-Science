I made this and it is delicious.  I did add a bit of ground ginger.  I added more apples 3 lbs so I did not have to add that much sugar.

Served this at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I sprinkled walnuts on top for “presentation”.  Ate it with breakfast the next day.  Definitely making it again soon.

This was an excellent accompaniment to baked chicken! I did alter the recipe by adding a teaspoon of ginger and halving the cinnamon to suit my family's palate. I will be making this again!

My daughter and I enjoyed this, my husband and son not so much.
