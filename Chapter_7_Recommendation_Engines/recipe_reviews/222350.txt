Made this recipe after watching the video and it's the best version we've EVER made at home. We used thinly sliced pork instead of chicken and threw in some cilantro too. I'm already craving it again!

This was delicious.  The only changes I made were to use tamarind concentrate instead of the paste (it was all they had at the Asian grocery store), and I forgot to add the paprika at the end.  I would have liked it to be a bit saucier.  I'm not sure if I cooked it a bit too long and the sauce got all soaked up or if I just need to make more sauce next time.  Even still the flavors were wonderful so I am giving this 5 stars.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Finally, I've found a righteous version of my favorite Asian dish! Only things I did differently is: I marinated the chicken over night in coconut milk, the zest of 1 lime and about a teaspoon of red pepper flake. I also grilled the chicken and added the chicken to the rest of the ingredients in the wok just before the cooking was complete. Came out DELICIOUS, and the chicken had a more authentic texture as opposed to cooking the chicken in a skillet. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

I made this recipe twice.  The first time I made it turned out awful.  The second time it was great.  I believe there were two main issues with the first attempt I had.  I couldn't find tamarind paste, only concentrate.  When I searched online, I had found some posts saying you could use these interchangeably.  I think this caused the sauce to be too thick.  The second mistake was that I didn't soak the noodles long enough.  The store I went to only had not flat rice noodles.  I also soaked them in probably too cold of water.  I tried to cook the noodles longer because they were so stiff, which combined with the thicker sauce just turned the noodles into a thick gummy mess.

The second attempt I used just over a tablespoon of tamarind concentrate and also soaked the flat noodles for the full hour in room temperature water.    Everything else I followed to the dot and it turned out great.

I paid attention to those who thought it was too sweet and reduced the amount of sugar I used. Mistake. With the tamarind paste and vinegar, the amount of sugar in the recipe is appropriate.

Extremely delish! I doubled the tamarind mixture after reading other reviews and it was a good amount.  You could probably just use 1.5X the fish sauce as it's a very strong flavor (2X the other ingredients in the mixture).  I used a tamarind paste substitute because I couldn't find any in my town (blend of prunes, lemon juice and dried apricots and was VERY close to the real thing).  I also added a tablespoon of worcestshire sauce to the final product while the noodles were cooking.  I mixed some of the chives and a dash of cilantro in the mixture in addition to using them as garnishes.  I used 5 eggs instead of 4 but only because we love eggs.  The dish was great and I will be making it again very soon!

I followed two recipes, partly this one partly another.  Let that guide what you think of my review.  

I did not add any vinegar, because the tamarind imparts a very acidic flavor on its own.  It has a "lactic"-y flavor like sun dried tomatoes.  Other recipes will not include vinegar, and if you watch the video for this recipe, the guy actually doesn't mention vinegar.  They show vinegar being used, but the guy only mentions the other 3 ingredients.  Maybe if you are starting off with very fresh tamarind you would need it, but the tamarind paste I have was already quite sour in flavor.

Many people making this will want an excess of sauce to drizzle over at the end.  The sauce is thin compared to the sauce at restaurants.  If you want something thicker, brown some onions and puree it into the sauce.  The cellulose will give it some of the body that a cream woiuld, but without changing the flavor.

Also, I used palm sugar, and most recipes that allow for a substitute will recommend brown sugar.

(double these ingredients for the recipe on this page)

1 tbsp. tamarind paste, to taste (available at Asian/Indian food stores)
1/4 cup chicken stock  (campbells)
3 Tbsp. fish sauce  (i used Thai Kitchen)
1 Tbsp. soy sauce  (i used kikkoman)
1/2 to 1 tsp. chili sauce, OR 1/3 to 3/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, to taste  (i used red curry paste, Thai Kitchen brand)
1/8 tsp. ground white pepper
3-4 Tbsp. palm sugar OR brown sugar

Delicious.  Didn't change the sauce proportions at all but did add half a chopped onion, some stir-fried tofu cubes and a splash of sweet chili sauce.  We also used a pound of chicken thighs instead of breasts.  My Thai-food loving teenager and husband loved it

I have NO idea what happened here. I had high hopes for this and as I always do I look at the comments on what to add what not to add blah blah.. So I figured! Ok x's the sauce. I like sauce. Yea the VINEGAR is WAY to much!! It's like eating salt and vinegar chips! YIKES.... So if you have ever eaten those things then you would know how my tongue is feeling and all I had was a sample =( Maybe make again but lessen the vinegar? This might be a I screwed up we're getting pizza night!!

I made this for the first time today.  I went to 3 different stores, trying to find tamarind PASTE."  I finally went to a local International Foods store and asked the counter person what this was, and she handed me a pack of "Wet Tamarind," which was not totally smooth (had some pulp of some sort), so I figured I'd just strain it after boiling it with the sugar and vinegar.  

Next time, I would probably double the tamarind mixture, as my noodles seems to soak it up and came out a wee bit  chewy/dry.  The plate appeal is very plain in and of itself, so if you're serving it to others,  you might want add some of the garnishes suggested in the recipe.  Nevertheless, it was tasty and it passed my kid's picky tastebuds (LOL), so we have a winner.  I added photos... :-)

Just made this and it is wonderful!  Will be making it again and again.  I used the ketchup with some worchteshire(sp) instead of the tamarind because I could not find tamarind paste.  I also used boneless pork chop for the meat instead of chicken because that's what I had on hand.  This dish is a keeper.  I also added a bag of stir fry veggies at the end of cooking.

good, but definitely not authentic.  Wwwaaayyyy  too much sugar, and real pad thai uses palm sugar not white sugar.  It was OK,  probably will not make again

My first attempt at Pad Thai, I made it according to the recipe (scaled for 8 servings). I am very happy with the results as was my girlfriend who hasn't always had a very adventurous palate. I'm looking forward to making it again in the near future, but I would probably double the sauce, lessen the chicken quantity, and add another egg.

Made this tonight for dinner. I reduced the amount of rice noodles to 8 oz.  It was very good, but a bit too sweet. Flavor was great but next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar.

This recipe was so disappointing. My husband and I love Pad Thai (and are both good cooks), so we were really excited to try this out. 
We followed the recipe perfectly and in the end, vinegar was the dominant taste. This is NOT how Pad Thai should taste! 
We looked into this and found that authentic Pad Thai doesn't have a trace of vinegar in it. Do yourself a favor and leave out the vinegar, or better yet, find a different recipe!!

I am giving this 5 stars because the taste was great but when I make it again (and I will) I will make more sauce because we found them a little drier than we like.

I made this recipe tonight after watching the video. It was great. Tasted just like take out from my favorite Thai Restauant. Don't worry if their seems to be too much sauce when you first add everything into the pan - the noodles will absorb much of the liquid after a few minutes of cooking.

This is an OUTSTANDING pad thai recipe. Just as good as restaurants if not better! I made several changes 1) in step 5, I used the tamarind mixture only (no sugar or salt added) 2) I half-cooked the rice noodles by boiling it first instead of waiting 30-60 min 3) added an extra egg  4) did not stir in crushed peanuts-- when serving, the bean sprouts goes on the bottom, then the rice noodles with chicken an eggs, then I sprinkled crushed peanuts on top, 5) added a side of sliced cucumbers,  goes perfectly with pad thai! 6)used tamarind concentrate not tamarind paste (although the concentrate did have a pasty consistency so not sure what the difference is)... one of the best recipes I've tried here!

This was really good! I could not for the life of me find tamarind paste though, so I used red curry paste instead and it worked out really well. I will definitely be making this again, thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't anticipate the amount of grease and cleanup. Other than that this is s great recipe. Not sure I'll make it often due up cleanup. And the smell of the tamarind and vinegar-whoa boy.   I might leave this to the pros.

DELICIOUS!!!  I live in the country very far away from any Thai restaurants.  I can order all of the ingredients online that I can't get locally and have Thai food whenever I want to.  I make this very often.  I also usually add a bag of frozen peas in at the end to make it a whole meal.  Thank you very much for the recipe!!

Made it exactly as instructed and it was amazing!!  Everyone loved it and the kids gobbled it up.  don't change a thing - it is very authentic.  Don't swap the tamarind for ketchup or you'll ruin it.

This is a winner! Had a little trouble finding Tamarind Paste so I used some sweet and spicy Tamarind Chutney I found in the Indian food section at Safeway. The only change I made was adding water chestnuts (cuz they're delicious!) but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will be making this one again. Even my kids ate it! That's a feat.

We gave this a shot, and now we are addicted! We've spent a lot of time in Asia, and this is about as close as we have found to the real thing. We couldn't find tamarind in the stores, so we substituded sugar and lime juice. I also added a little bit of water to the mixture before putting the noodles in, it made everything blend together nicely. We also added more eggs as well. Its a keeper!

It pains me to say this, but this is hands down the worst recipe that I have ever had the misfortune to follow. I'm bit too stupid to follow a recipe. It was awful. This was literally rice noodles and chicken. This recipe was so bad it offends me

The only changes I made were to double the sauce (as I do like it pretty saucy, and after reading other reviews I wanted to make sure there was plenty--especially because I had a 13oz package of noodles), add chili paste to the tamarind mixture and to mix the bean sprouts in with the pad thai instead of as a garnish. The result was a bit disappointing, mostly in the flavoring in the sauce. Perhaps this is because I'm used to getting pad thai at American restuarants, so even those this might be "authentic," it's not the flavor I'm used to. Maybe?

It was just kind of meh, and I'm so glad I had sriracha on hand to spice it up, even after adding 1 tbls of chili paste to the tamarind mixture. It was definitely too sweet for my taste.

I also think I made the mistake of soaking the noodles too long, as the whole thing was kind of gooey--but that's not reflected in my rating, just a tip to everyone else! I probably had them soaking for a good hour and 15 minutes.

I'll likely make a variation of this recipe in the future, but next I'll scale back the amount of sugar and fish sauce, add lots more chili sauce, and double the chicken. Personal preference would have been to crack the eggs on top of the mixture while it was heating and cook it through that way, so I'll do that next time as well.

So far, this recipe is the most truly pad thai on All Recipes. No paprika needed. If you need spice, use Thai chili pepper. Pad Thai also doesn't served with rice. Rice noodle is the carb for the dish. I like to cook beansprout with the noodle until they half way cooked.

This recipe did not turn out well for me.  I read the reviews and doubled the sauce, but it tasted incredibly salty, sweet, and vinegar. With so many good reviews, I feel like I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling the sauce from reading review recommendations.  I will not try this again.

I think I messed it up...I had a 16 oz package of rice noodles so I decided to double the sauce. This put in way too much vinegar. Next time I will still probably double, just cut the vinegar. Also I think it can use a tbsp of peanut butter & hot chili pepper. I also put in a package of stir fry fresh veggies.

Sooooooo much vinegar! All through dinner I could feel it in my nose and each bite hit the back of my throat. Other than that, not much flavor, noodles were really stuck together. Would not make this again.

The flavor was okay, but the texture/end result was not a success... Followed the recipe to a T, and it turned out a dark, gummy mess.  I soaked and cooked the noodles enough, so maybe it was just a bad batch of noodles? I also used tamarind concentrate, not paste, so had hoped for a better presentation. If I made this again (which I probably won't), I'd double the tamarind mixture.

As written, I would give this 2 to 3 stars.   The noodles are dry, dry, dry with the amount of sauce, so I would use half the amount of noodles.  Also, all the sauce was absorbed by the noodles, so there was no sauciness to it.  I like the flavor, but the recipe needs a lot of work to be what I consider good.

I have searched and searched for a Pad Thai recipe and for some reason mine always comes out wrong.  I think my problem lies with the tamarind paste.  It's as black and thick as tar and I followed this recipe to the T and my dish came out black.  It tasted rather tart as well.  Any suggestions?  Am I using the wrong tamarind medium?  My local Thai restaurant guards their recipes tighter than Fort Knox so their no help.  I'm an advanced cook but I'm struggling with this dish.  Thanks.

This was a fantastic recipe!  After eating the very same dish in Thailand this is as close as it gets.  We add hot chili sauce at the end to taste for those that like a little extra kick.   Also found that if you don't have tamarind paste that you can use lime juice instead. Will definitely make this again!

I made this exactly according to the recipe on 5/8/2014. It came out wonderful. People were fighting to take leftovers home. I am made mine with shrimp instead of chicken.

Definitely I will be making this again.

I didn't realize that authentic pad thai is actually quite boring without all the fixin's we add in. The flavor of the sauce is spot on, but I had to make a trip to the Asian store in town to find tamarind.  My thought to make it more of a complete meal rather than just noodles, peanuts, eggs and chicken, is to stirfry some veggies (I used pea shoots from the Asian store, but bok choy, spinach or something that really cooks down works) and other meats (shrimp or pork) ahead of time and add them to your dish. Will make again (hey I have a bunch of tamarind paste to use up!) with more veggies.
Dec 2, 2014 Used this recipe again, this time using tamarind concentrate; there was no such thing as 'tamarind paste'. There was a lot of it, but I used it all since I dislike dry pad thai. I continue to add veggies to make more of a complete meal and less authentic. We really like this version.

This was absolutely delicious! I've made it every week since we first tried it and everyone loves it. Don't make substitutions please! So many people seem to be subbing out various ingredients and they end up with something different but still rate it negatively! Tamarind paste/puree is available at asian foodstores or international markets and you only need buy one jar to make this recipe dozens of times so it's worth a detour to get. I soak the noodles longer than the time stated here (1 hour and 1/2) but perhaps they are a thicker style, Rice noodles really make the dish, it wouldn't be the same without them. I often order Pad Thai at Thai restaurants and I've never had one better than this (Some are as good - but never better!)

My husband and I have had this from a mix, but this time I had almost all the ingredients and so I tried it. Because I can't use sugar, I used Splenda as a substitute. Also, I didn't have rice noodles, so I used spaghetti and cooked it 10 minutes before adding it to the wok. We absolutely LOVED it! I watched the video first and then made the dish. I will attempt more Thai food in the future, because my husband was just thrilled. Thank you.

This was a great recipe. I couldn't find tamarind paste, so I just mixed equal parts lime juice and brown sugar, then measured from that mixture. I will say that I felt my end result needed a little less sugar and a little more citrus, but it may have been because of the absence of tamarind paste. 

Also, I added cayenne pepper and red chili flakes, for a little extra punch. And I used white rice vinegar. It made my pad thai a little darker, but def added depth to the flavor.

We subbed Hoisin since I couldn't find Tamarind.  Everything else was followed to recipe.  Came out very delicious and authentic except the noodles were lighter than expected instead of the medium brown at restaurants.

This was fantastic.  I used shrimp instead of chicken, as I was trying to use up some leftovers.  I couldn't find tamarind paste, so I was planning on winging it then I found some thai curry paste in my pantry.  Turned out it had tamarind as a main ingredient as well as a few others so I used that.  Hubby loved it and had 3 servings, but said it could be a little spicier.  I loved it the way it was.

Perhaps it was my brand of fish sauce, but the fish sauce flavor overpowered it all. Had to double the tamarind sauce to cover all the noodles, but I didn't double the amt of fish sauce that goes into it, and the fish sauce flavor was still overwhelming. Will make again, but will seriously scale back the amount of fish sauce. Not sure it's worth going through all the effort for, if you have a good thai place to order from.

The end result was very delicious, however the sauce smells terrible while you're cooking it! I followed others' advice and made a full amount of sauce for half the noodles, eggs, and chicken and still would have liked more sauce.  The fish sauce is pretty strong - I will probably cut that down next time - but it turned out as good as my favorite local restaurant and my 5-year-old even liked it. I will make this again soon!

This was really good just following the recipe, although not as good as decent pad thai from a restaurant.  I think if I simmered everything together for a little longer (e.g. more than 5 mins), it would have reduced the vinegar flavor which was pretty obvious.  Also, my noodles were a bit al dente - so more evidence that I didn't simmer long enough.  All in all, this was REALLY good, but the bar is set pretty high for me as there is a lot of good Thai here (Seattle) that this dish is competing with.

Everyone loved it!  My oldest said it was the best Pad Thai she ever had.  I didn't have the tamarind paste but had bought the tamarind pods at a mexican food store a while back.  So I just removed them from casing and cooked them in the vinegar sugar solution.  We like a little stronger peanut taste so I always add a scoop of peanutbutter just before removing from the heat.

I used brown sugar for the sauce and white sugar at the end with the salt. The noodles soaked at room temp for 45 minutes but I wish I would have let them sit another 10 minutes. I used shrimp instead of chicken and cilantro instead of green onion because that is what I had on hand. SO GOOD!!

I’m SO confused by all the people who posted that this was authentic and good.  I made the sauce recipe exactly, and it was watery, soupy, sour sweet tangy - and NOT in a good way.  I do a LOT of cooking, I can nail almost any recipe by reading a dozen and then winging it.  This recipe is so far off base I am mad that I wasted two beautiful organic chicken breasts and My time on it.

I think it is an authentic recipe. It was really good I used Spanish Peanuts. Mine was a little dry so I added extra water at the end of the cooking stir fry. I plan to make it again. It says it will feed six and it makes a lot.

Not my cup of tea. I wanted to love this but it tasted like sweet vinegar. Not A taste I want outside of maybe a salad dressing.

Insanely good! I made this with stevia instead of sugar and Chang's zero (shiritaki) noodles, and it tasted AMAZING!! I used 1/4 cup stevia mix instead of 1/2 cup of sugar as that's what the label said to use. I am sooooo full!! I used 5 eggs as mine were rather tiny, but everything was fresh. I don't think I've ever eaten tamarind paste before--total covert! I added all the toppings, but used green onions instead of chives. This one is going to be on repeat for sure. Thank you so much for the recipe!! I absolutely recommend this recipe using stevia and zero carb thin noodles and watching the video as well. The zero carb noodles I rinsed very well, boiled for 4.5 minutes and cooked in a dry pan for about 12 minutes before adding it to the pan with my sauce! So yumm! You have to try this recipe!

I made this for a gathering of friends. Great reviews. Good balance of tangy and sweet.  I added fried tofu instead of chicken. The tofu takes in the flavor of the sauce. I soaked the noodles for 1 hour but I think I would give it more time in the future.  I'll keep and use this recipe.

this recipe was awesome!! Just like a restaurant a few things I did was 

 -tomato paste instead of tamarind (however you spell that) paste because it's not as sour so it won't be as vinegary and you don't have to take a trip to the Asian market

-add the paprika towards the end of cooking so the color will turn out more like you will see at a restaurant 

-let the sauce simmer for a few minutes so some of the vinegar will evaporate off if you hate vinegar (although it will be hard to breathe for a minute)

happy cooking!

YAAAAAAAY!!!! Thank you so much. I love Pad Thai but I have to watch my sodium intake. It was for this reason, I decided to make it at home. 

I watched the video, then made the recipe. For dietary reasons,  I reduced a quarter of the fish sauce and completely omitted salt. Even with this slight modification it came out GREAT!

I am talking about the rare win-win situation folks! A deliciously satisfying meal that also meets dietary needs!   I served this dish with steamed broccoli.

This was not a bad recipe.  2 TBSP of Tamarind is too much for me, next time I'll cut back on it.  I also added 1 TBSP of cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit.

It was okay/good. I used all the ingredients called for, in the correct measurements. I did add 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the sugar/vinegar/tamarind mixture before simmering, and some sliced red bell pepper for color and texture to the garlic before adding the cooked chicken. Topped with cilantro and sliced green onions before serving. The bean sprouts, cilantro and lime juice are what really brought it together. It still seemed a little dry though. It would have been very plain without the cilantro, limes and bean sprouts ( for crunch and moisture).

Simple to make and tasty. A couple points:
- use flat noodles rather than vermicelli
- stir fried some onion and mushroom prior to adding the egg
- used left over pork tenderloin
- added fresh cilantro, onions and peanuts when plating
- don't forget the paprika!

My husband loved this and he usually does not like Pad Thai. I halved the recipe except for the sauce but I think I put too much vinegar in so I will add less next time. Other then that it was really good. Thank you

I made this Pad Thai a month ago and can’t stop thinking about it. It wasn’t so delicious that I’m making it again tonight. I made the recipe exactly as it is written and would not change a thing.

Make sure you plan the stages so you don’t have to scramble  .  I soaked the noodles for well over an hour, and they still took time in the wok to cook.

Good directions for making pad thai. I used a premade sauce instead of making one, so I skipped that step. I found the noodles to be best after soaking for an hour or slightly more.

I didn’t have bean sprouts on hand when I got a craving for Pad Thai and tried this recipe! Didn’t have peanuts either but used chopped dry roasted cashews instead! This is a truly authentic tasting recipe that is quick and easy. I read reviews and made a little extra sauce: using a smaller quantity of palm sugar instead of white sugar; a little extra vinegar, tamarind paste, fish sauce  and a few pinches of pepper flakes, making the paprika unnecesssry. I did not second guess the specific 
instructions in the written recipe and the video, specifying that the rice noodles should be soaked in ROOM TEMPERATURE WATER FOR 60 Minutes! My most successful result using rice noodles!!!!

Recipe is missing two things:
1. The first attempt, pad thai was too dry, noodles didn't soften enough. Need to add some liquid. My second attempt I added enough chicken broth so noodles had enough liquid to soften properly. 
2. Recipe has no heat like chili flakes or srirachi. I added both the second time, and after items 1 and 2 fixes, the pad thai was terrific.

As many noted it was too sweet (for me,  anyway). And one other problem , and hopefully someone has a suggestion: the noodles did not cook sufficiently, and I soaked them for 40 minutes. Suggestions????

I liked this recipe and I do think this can be considered like the original one. Fortunately, it is not sweet. For some reason, though, it got too acid. Maybe I should have allowed the sauce to simmer more. Will try another time.

More authentic tasting than  I expected.  Great the first few bites but went down hill as it cooled.  Not enough juice/moisture and was a dry crumbly batch by the end of the night.  Way too many peanuts and bean sprouts. Nice base to improve on overtime that includes all the basics/stepping point for a good homemade pad thai.

Excellent recipe that creates a "restaurant quality" pad thai.  My only minor complaint is it can be a little bit dry so I add a quarter cup of additional fluid.

This is a very good recipe.  I’ve played with it and without changing any ingredients I’d like to give some tips.  The proportions for this recipe are, I find, a bit off.  First this is enough noodles to feed way more than six.  A lot more.  These noodles expand and absorb every bit of sauce.  These are my tips:  Double the vinegar and sugar.  Increase fish sauce to 1/3 cup.  Tamarind paste 2 1/2 TBS.

What a tasty dish!  I was not expecting this to be so delicious.  My husband and I  both enjoyed this dish.  I made no changes or substitutions.  I did use rice vermicelli instead of wide noodles because that is what I had in the cupboard.  This recipe is staying in my favorites!

I could not find the tamarind paste, mixed 1 tsp brown sugar with 1 tsp fresh lime juice. Also added red pepper flakes w/ thai chili spices and this was awesome! I was pleasantly surprised, this was just as good as my favorite Thai Restaurant!

Everything went great except the noodles. I soaked them for 20 min (even though the package said 30-60) and ended up with hard noodles which kinda ruined it. But the flavour was there. I'm going to try it again this week and see if I can nail it!

Edit- Much better the second time. I gave the noodles a little kick in hot water right before adding them just to make sure they were soft. Worked well.

While this was quite good, it tasted slightly vinegary.  So while not authentic thai dining quality it's pretty good for an uncomplicated home version.

I ditched making sauce and picked up a bottle of pad Thai sauce at hyvee for $3.75. Easy to make the first time and would definitely recommend at any level.

I love Pad Thai but have only had it in the US so I can't vouch for it's authenticity. None-the-less this came out really good.  I had a hard time finding Tamarind paste but did find it eventually and got some very good fish sauce to make this dish.  I followed the recipe (omitting the peanuts).   I watched the video which was very helpful - especially to make my Rice noodles come out right.  Thank you for submitting it - we no longer have to go out for Pad Thai it is wonderfully made right here at home.

I have tried to make several Pad Thai recipes but this is the only one that is worthwhile. This recipe is as good as the best Thai restaurant I've been. 

I think the tamarind is probably a key ingredient (with the fish sauce of course).  I did use tamarind concentrate which worked out fine. I did not add the paprika cause I don't really like it. I also added shrimp along with the chicken. 

This is the real deal! No ketchup in this recipe! It is right on the money.

I like this recipe because it is easy to make and this would be my way of cooking it as well.  There are cooks who actually serve the noodles and sauce separately and I did not like it.  the noodles tend to become dry, stiff and chewy.  And if you have to cheat, you can just actually use peanut butter as replacement for peanuts.  Although you can always buy roasted peanuts in a jar and just chop it in a blender.   For me pad Thai is not the same if you do not use tamarind.  Tamarind gives this dish a distinct flavor.   I usually cook the eggs separately and add to the last minute.   and I do like sunny side up eggs on top of my noodles as opposed to scrambled.   You can buy seasonings with salt and paprika on it to give your noodle a little kick.  Sesame oil also is great with pad thai.  I thought shrimp or chicken are the best proteins for this dish.  I also garnish this in the end with scallions and cilantro for a more robust taste.  P. S.  I like the video but I do not like the fact that the cook was teasing in a way that he has a secret ingredient.  He should have not even said it because it really does not matter especially if it will not appeal to the end user.  who knows it could be msg  lol.

I made this today and only gave it 4 stars cause I am a poor cook and figure there has to be a way to make it even better but this is THE recipe for restaurant tasting Pad Thai. It was -absolutely delicious! I was able to find the Tamarind Paste at Wegman’s. Can’t wait to make this again!

yes I cut this in half for two- it was still generous- I used minced ginger and lemongrass paste (I/2 tsp ea.) along with the garlic in the initial oil- it was very much more like authentic with those aromatic additives included.  It would be excellent with shrimp as well as the chicken-or combined !!

Great flavor and surprisingly easy!! This recipe was amazing as is! I served it with chicken and shrimp. The only change I made was a substitution of the Tamarind since I couldn’t find it at any of my local stores. I replaced it with 1 tablespoon of ketchup, 1/2 tablespoon of brown sugar, and 1/2 tablespoon of rice vinegar. I also doubled the sauce since I like a saucier pad thai.

I don't understand how this recipe rates so highly. I made it exactly as the recipe states and was not impressed. Although edible, there were none of the signature flavours of pad thai or thai food for that matter. No umami, no sweetness, no spice, just a vinegary noodle dish. Find another recipe.

Cut out all the salt.  Added a pound of shrimp, 1 tsp Worstershire sauce. Replaced half the rice noodles with  shredded zucchini.

I have made this recipe several times just as written and no chances, my hubby most likely could have it every night. It is a keeper and one that is requested frequently in our family.

This is a great, simple recipe which is how pad Thai should be! I added puff tofu (personal favorite from a local Thai place and a wonderful punch of soaked up sauce) but in order to make it "saucier" I mistakenly added too much fish sauce...My bf loved it but it was way to salty for me (my own fault). Next time will follow recipe to the tee because this was otherwise excellent and I shouldn't have messed with it!

I love this recipe and keep coming back to it for truly authentic tasting Pad Thai.  I even make a vegan version by substituting soy sauce for the fish sauce and omitting egg and meat.  My niece loves it.  But of course, it's best with shrimp!

I also doubled the sauce, but next time will triple it. I couldn't find any tamarind paste, so I used fresh lemon juice and brown sugar. I followed the instructions except I added the peanuts, green onions and bean sprouts to the pan and heated them all through for about 3-5 mins while cooking the noodles with the sauce. Turned out great, but I like more sauce so next time I'll triple the sauce and actually buy tamarind paste. Will make again!

I liked both this recipe (Do you mean Thai Tom's in Seattle's Udist?) and the suggestions of people who have made it. Something about the style of the recipe helped me make sense of making it with the ingredients I had on hand, better than other versions. It was stormy tonight in the bay area and I didn't want to walk to the store in the hail. I used cashews and ground them in a mini bullet. In future I would grind them in 3 Tbs batches as a group it ground to a thinner almost flour like consistency. I didn't have tamarind, chicken, chives (green onions), or mung bean sprouts as I would have liked. I used red rice noodles cooked for 4 minutes in boiling water, then rinsed in cool water. 1 yellow onion stir fried in peanut oil with chopped garlic and two slices chopped ginger root. Then once those browned, I used a second pan to put fish oil and 3 eggs stirring (almost like scrambled eggs but no milk), then added the noodes and the sauce, topped it with onion garlic mix. If using cashews (more oily soft than peanut) squeeze lemon on first and then add plenty of cashew powder. I added some cashew powder in the pan to even out the taste, but then a lot of it stuck to the pan. Later I fixed it by squeezing 1/2 a lemon on my plate of pad thai and then putting 2 -3 Tbs of cashew powder. Man! It was delish, a bit wonky without the tamerind, and sprouts, etc, but the flavor notes were awesome and on key. I can't wait to eat the left overs!

I love Thai food and there is a REALLY GOOD, small, yet authentic, Thai restaurant a few blocks from my house. The only problem is they don'the deliver and are typically closed by the time I get off work.  I was a little sceptical when I saw the word "authentic " in the title, but after perusing the ingredients list I decided to make it.  And I'm glad I did!  This recipe is so close to what I am accustomed to, that I will probably make it myself from here on out.  
I only gave it 4 stars because the full recipe is too much for 1 person.  When I cut the recipe in 1/2, I felt there wasn't quite enough sauce and the noodles could have absorbed more.  In any case the taste is awsome, but I would have liked to have had 1 more TBSP of sauce.
I followed the recipe by 1/2.  I made 1 change to the preparation aspect.  When it came to adding the sugar and salt at the end, I stirred it into the existing sauce instead of sprinkling it over the noodles and it was just fine.  The next time I make it I will make a full batch and see if my results are any different. 
Loving the fact I will never have to order Pad Thai again!  Hoping the grandkids like it so I can make it over and over again!

This was very delicious - one that the whole family enjoyed. Make sure you get all of your ingredients set before you start cooking. Also, I would recommend maybe during down the heat on the stove to medium when cooking the noodles, chicken and sauce. It ended up getting pretty sticky quickly, and again this may be because I didn't mise en place first. All in all, I really liked this dish and was very close to my favorite Thai place where I live.

I usually bought a jar of Pad Thai sauce. Since I'd moved to new area it was so difficult to find one or at least the brand that I used so I searched for how to make a sauce. Thank you so much for this recipe. Ill never buy a jar sauce again but I'm not a big fan of vinegar so I used only half of the recipe and added water to fill it up. It still tasted right. Oh by the way I made this once about 2 months ago and today I'm making it again for dinner :)

The taste is spot on...loved it.  Next time I will add extra chicken and shrimp, and use less noodles,  but this is just a personal choice.

One thing I notices...it is pretty hard to get the noodles soft with the amount of liquid I had.  Will cover and lover heat during the cooking phase which I think will help.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I soaked noodles for an hour --  30 minutes was not long enough. The tamarind paste I bought was more like mashed fruit (included pits and rind) than puree.  Will try this again and double the mashed tamarind, cook in sugar/vinegar mixture, then strain  the mixture before adding it to the chicken and rice noodles. Fresh bean sprouts are better than canned. I didn't have/use chives, paprika, and lime wedges.

Really enjoyed this. I've be making variations on Pad Thai for years and this is one of the better ones. Be sure to google how to prepare tamarind paste if you aren't used to using it. I added a few of my favorite fixes like basil and soy sauce, but the recipe is good without any alterations.

The flavor is fantastic.  I made no changes to the recipe but my noodles turned out a bit sticky, not sure why.  I soaked my noodles for 45 minutes.

I doubled the sauce, added a minced Serrano pepper and skipped the peanuts. When I make again, I'll add another pepper, use 2 more eggs and add some crushed red pepper flakes. Very tasty as is, though

I liked this recipe enough, but found it lacking in flavor compared to some of my favorite restaurant versions. I will attempt again with better tamarind and see if that helps. Additionally I thought it was a little too sweet overall and will also reduce the sugar or use brown sugar in the next try.

Update: I decided to try this dish again. I used a different sauce recipe and it was delicious this time around. Basically I cut the sugar to 1/2 the amount in the sauce and use chicken broth instead of vinegar (still adding a splash of vinegar to sauce). Turned out very good once I changed the sauce recipe.

MUST DO:
1. Make sure the water you use to soak noodles in is more warm and not cold. ( our water was a bit cold, so we had to recook noodles which made them too sticky and slightly burnt)
2. Use less vinegar, salt and sugar. It was a bit too acidic and yes, the sugar is necessary. I would use 1/2 tablespoon salt and half the sugar.  Flavors definitely tasted authentic, just make the adjustments and I'm sure it will taste good.

I have no idea if these are truly authentic (other than what I gather from other reviews), but these are amazing. I have made this recipe weekly since I found it. I did reduce the sugar slightly and have used cut up rotisserie chicken, otherwise followed pretty much to the T. I have ended up adding more veggies to make the veggies more delectable. Highly recommend!!

I was in the mood for Thai food, so I gave this recipe a try.  It was delicious!  I didn't have tamarind paste but substituted 1 T. vinegar and 2 T lime juice. I  used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  The color was a bit bland, so I added a bit of soy sauce.  I will definitely make this again.  It got reviews from the family, too.

Even on the first time, it was amazing. Make sure to have a large enough pan/wok though. Didn't realize that my roommate had taken the 14 in pan, so had to break it into two 8 in pans which didn't cook the noodles as evenly as I'd like.

I couldn't find tamarind paste so instead I used roasted red chili paste (which has tamarind, fish sauce, garlic, etc.) and substituted the fish sauce (which was already in the past I used) for a 1/4 cup soy sauce. Otherwise followed recipe to a t and it came out very nicely. Will definitely make again.

I added tofu, that was the only change I made and my family who is not picky did not like this at all. They all agreed this does not taste like Pad Thai. Way too much vinegar, and off putting flavors. Too much fish sauce?

I just made this for dinner, and it was a super hit.  I read the reviews and made a few slight changes, but not much.  I used a 16 Oz package of noodles and the recipe calls for 12, so instead of doubling the sauce I tripled it.  I cut the vinegar and sugar by about a third, used 5 eggs, added a generous tablespoon of peanut butter and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes.  I have been wanting to try to make pad thai for ages but was a bit nervous about it. It was awesome for my first try!

My package of rice noodles was for 14 oz, not 12. I used all 14 oz and regretted it. It threw off the balance. If I made it again, I'd make sure to make slightly more sauce and add more chicken, especially if adding extra noodles. Overall, this was a good find.

Rice noodles were really chewy, they should definitely be boiled. Also, make sure you have a big skillet or wok to cook this. We tried making small portions in a smaller omelette pan. That might be why the noodles came out chewy, but i really think they shouldve been  boiled. Adding some veggies to the mix wouldnt hurt either like some carrots. We used tamarind concentrate instead of the paste and it came out fine. We also had a thai peanut sauce salad on the side with iceburg lettuce, spinach, tomato, tangerine slices and carrots on the side and it was a great combo.

My husband and I LOVE making this!  We have tried other Pad Thai recipes that didn't even come CLOSE to the authentic flavor you get from restaurants.  This is it!!!  We couldn't find Tamarind paste, but we did use Tamarind concentrate (same measurement) and it worked fine.  We used green onion instead of chives because that's how I've always seen it in restaurants.  We've made it so many times that we've perfected it to our liking.  I like to add a little water at the end to loosen some of the sauce up.  Definitely soak the noodles for the full hour and DO NOT OVERCOOK THEM in your wok.  Try to stay to the exact times mentioned in the recipe.  The longer the noodles stay in the wok, the glue-ier they become.  This is the real deal, people!

I did not add the extra sugar and salt at the end, as the dish was  already very very flavorful (I used tamarind concentrate). I also omitted bean sprouts and chives as I do not like those, but I added stir fried sweet bell pepper strips for some color and as a veggie. I thought this recipe was ok, it smelled great, but taste wise it somehow lacked depth. The noodles were also quite pale and didn't look that appealing. Perhaps replacing a bit of the fish sauce with dark soy sauce might help? A shame I had no peanuts available at home, peanuts would help the texture and taste a lot!

I live in Istanbul and finding tamarind paste can be problematic at best, but I substituted Nar syrup, made from pomegranate juice, and it worked well.

Followed the recipe to a T. I can't place what was so wrong about it. I cooked the fish sauce out plenty, so it wasn't that it was fishy... It was bitter, but sweet, and pungent and sour. Not good at all.

This is wonderful!  The flavor, everything. The only thing I will change next time is that the sauce needs to be at least doubled.  And add some red chile paste to it for some kick.

Made as is and found the fish sauce was overpowering. May need to make again with a different type of fish sauce (lighter color version).

Great flavor. Noodles didn't quite soften up enough.  A little too sweet. May have reduced sauce too much, but seemed a little dry.

LOVED this dish and my guests did, too! Only wish I had been able to find tamarind at my grocery store. I substituted 1 Tbsp brown sugar and 1 Tbsp lime juice for it, and it was delicious, but I'm sure it would have been even better with the real thing :)

Amazing pad thai! It is even better if you let it sit overnight and then reheat it the next day. As a matter of fact I will most likely be making this the night before we eat it from now on. I love this pad thai!

I have made this twice for company with rave reviews it truly is amazing, I love the tamarind in it. If you put in too many noodle (which I did last night) I added some Tamarind Sauce for a little extra. The flavours were amazing!!!!

I had to make a few changes.  I didn't have paprika, so I used a few red pepper flakes instead.  I did shrimp instead of chicken.  I squirted on lime juice at the last minute out of a bottle instead of wedges.  I also added the bean sprouts in after the noodles had cooked a little bit instead of as a garnish.  It was so delicious.  We love Pad Thai at restaurants.  My family loved this more than any restaurant we've been to.

The taste on this recipe is great. I didn't have tamarind paste at my local Safeway so I substituted lime juice and brown sugar and it worked just fine. I also had to fry it a little bit longer than noted in the recipe - about 8 min total on high heat.

Overall a very good recipe but will need some tweaking at the end. The tamarind was a bit strong for my tastes, definitely will need to reduce that and the final addition of the sugar and salt are probably not necessary in my opinion. But the foundation of the recipe is great and with a garnish of cilantro and lime, quite good. If I make it again, it will be with the above adjustments.

My first attempt to make pad thai and it was so good! I used tamarind concentrate b/c i did not have paste and it still turned out great. I doubled the whole recipe to make a big tray of it for pot luck and it was a winner! No left over. I will definitely make this  again! I used shrimp and pork instead of chicken and lots of bean sprouts!

I made this last night and honestly found it disappointing, especially after such high reviews. It was dry and bland. I would recommend 2-3x the sauce. I did 1 1/2x and it wasn't nearly enough.

This is a very good recipe. I need to work on my noodles though. They stuck together and were very rubbery. But this was very good!

I have done this recipe a few times and I love it. I always make and extra portion of sauce because I felt they were too dry. Also, I substituted the vegetable oil and garlic for stir fry oil and tried  cashews or pine nuts instead of peanuts and pork tenderloin, skirt steak or steak instead of chicken, and it was delicious! Last time I wollowed the recommendation from another comment and marinated the chicken in coconut mil with lime zest and it was amazing!!

Great Recipe! I cheated and used Pad Thai sauce I purchased in Chinatown, but the technique makes a really great Pad Thai.

I really enjoyed this and so did hubby.  I had to improvise with the tamarind paste - could not find any - the closest was a tamarind-date sauce - that worked fine.  The flavour of the pad thai was great, but it wouldn't hurt to have more sauce - I might try doubling it next time.  I also omitted the second amount of sugar.  And I found this dish tasted particularly good the next day.

So I just finished making the recipe.  What a disappointment!!!!!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it was dry and unflavorable.  Don't think I did anything wrong.  I used every ingredient as it asked for.  Now to feed it to the family.....yuck!!!

This had way too much vinegar. Then you had to sugar coat it down to cover over the vinegar.

This turned out so well!! I will definitely be making it again! I substituted 1/4 cup chicken broth as I didn't have any fish sauce. Added carrots, celery, broccoli, and red pepper to make it more of a stir fry (and I didn't have sprouts). And added 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce and 1 tbsp of soy sauce instead of the tamarind paste because i didn't have that either. All in all, probably not the most authentic for me but loved it all the same.

Great flavor! So glad to have a good recipe to make this at home. Did not add the extra sugar called for in step 5 and it turned out yummy. Even picky kids enjoyed it.

The recipe omitted chile oil or flakes which most good pad Thai needs. I prefer less sugar and date sugar is preferable, failing that we have used honey and prefer its organic flavor to simple white sugar. Definitely need to double the sauce and halve the sugar. Overall a decent recipe, we like ours wokked with tofu and fresh cilantro on top.

I was a little nervous while making the recipe because it did not seem like it would taste like the pad thai I loved at a local restaurant.  Those fears were set aside once I tasted it because it was delicious.  The only thing I would do differently next time is maybe add a little crushed red pepper or cayenne.

My husband and son thought this was fantastic!  Substituted palm sugar which is traditionally used instead of using white granulated sugar.  We will be making this again!
