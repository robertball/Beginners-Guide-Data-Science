Seriously?  Please explain how 6 oz. of vodka and 12 oz. of cola and then 3/4 oz. absinthe are supposed to fit into an 8-oz glass?  I'm not sure this is a real recipe.

I scaled this down to 1/3 of the original recipe, otherwise it would have made way too much. The taste of the absinthe overpowers everything else, next time I will reduce the amount even more.
