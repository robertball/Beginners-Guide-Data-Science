This rub was O.K. but it has a fundamental flaw.  Never, EVER rub salt into the meat until just (10-20 mins.) before cooking time!  This really dries out whatever meat you are using and adds to the overall saltiness of your dish.  I grew up in the midwest and cooked at a rib joint for four years, making literally tons of ribs.  Please do not make potentially great BBQ average by salting it too early!

Every year I make baby-back ribs for about 60 people for the 4th of July.  This dry rub has perfected my recipe!  (First, sprinkle ribs generously with liquid smoke, then add dry rub - wrap individually in foil and bake slowly in oven - add some BBQ sauce and throw on the grill for a few minutes!

I used it today for our pork steaks and OMG, it was SOOO yummy. It kept the steaks juicy and was perfect. I did like all the suggestions said and added dried onion and some red pepper. I let it sit in the fridge for 5.5 hours. My husband was raving about it and even my "no, I'll wait and eat pizza at the party" son ate some. 
I'll be making this OFTEN.
I put it in the blender and mixed it all together so I could put it in a seasoning jar.  Makes it easier to apply and store.

We really loved this rub.  For years I had used one from Cuisine Magazine, but couldn't find the recipe anymore.  I tried this one and my family raved that they were the best ribs yet.  I made some alterations...

*  Cut back to about 1 Tbsp kosher salt
*  Used 1 teaspoon pepper 
*  Used 1/2 Tablespoon garlic powder
*  Added about 1 tsp of dry mustard powder

I cooked the ribs in a slow oven (about 250 degrees) for 3 1/2 hours.  This was for 2 2 slabs.  Then, grilled them and added some BBQ sauce while grilling

Overall, a very good rub. However I upped the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, cut back the salt to 2 tsp. and the black pepper down to 1/2 tsp. And, because I love to play with a recipe I added 1 tsp. of onion powder, 1 Tbsp. of cumin, and 1 Tbsp. of chili powder. I rubbed some baby back ribs with this and marinated for a few hours vs. overnight.

My food tasted like brine after using only a tiny amount of this rub. I'd recommend people halve or quarter the amount of salt in the recipe.

This a very nice dry rub. So easy and fast to prepare. A person is also very likely to have all the ingredients on hand. A real plus in my house! I used this dry rub as a base for BBQ country ribs. I tasted the ribs with only the dry rub and then after the BBQ was added. My family and I liked better with just this dry rub on it. Give this recipe a whirl, you'll be glad you did.

This is delicious!  I've tried it on ribs that have marinated for 3 hours, and on ribs that I just rubbed down and threw in the oven.  Tastes the same!  It comes out a little spicy, so next time I might cut the black pepper in half.  But still finger lickin' good!

This was a wonderful rub! I did take suggestions from other reviews and added chili powder and onions, and I also used fresh pressed garlic in place of the powder.  We Love this rub on all meats! Thanks Denise!

Brooksie.. have issue with your review.. not sure where you heard not to use salt proir with rub.. but your crazy... you watch or talk with any bbq pro's there are plenty of them out there that use straight Salt and Pepper rubs prior to cooking....  please dont give bad advice if ya dont know what your talking about.
Other then that this RUB works everyone has diffferent taste palets so try it out and see if you like it ...

This is a great rub but was a little too salty for my taste when following the recipe posted.  I reduced the amount of salt from 1.5 T to 1 T and did the same with the black pepper.  Great on chicken too!

Love this recipe.Marinate for 24 hours. Bake covered in foil 300 degrees [ low and slow ] for 2 hours. open foil slather with baby rays and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. I don't have a grill & this works just fine.  It's great on chicken & beef ribs too.

This rub produced some very successful ribs.  I also used half regular and half smoked paprika.  After applying the rub I used another recipe's technique and cut the racks into serving portion sizes.  I double wrapped them in foil and put all in a large roasting pan and baked for about 2 hours @ 300.  Then we grilled them and added bbq sauce to finish.  They were loaded with flavor and very tender.

These were AMAZING! I followed the ingredients exactly. I wrapped the ribs in foil and left them to sit overnight. Then I put ribs (still in foil) in a preheated oven at 275 degrees F (135 degrees C) and Baked for 3 hours. I carefully removed the ribs (the foil is full of drippings) and smothered ribs with Jack Daniels Sizzling Smokehouse Blend of Grilling Sauce, put them on a hot grill for 4-5 minutes per side and DONE! The results were amazing! The ribs were so tender they were practically falling off the bone.

Never, ever, ever add salt to rib meat a day ahead of time.  Salt dries meat out and makes it jerkyish.  This rub is good I've used it more than once but I must say adding salt to baby backs this far in advance will make your ribs tough.  I personally like fall of the bone moist ribs and have been cooking them for about 12 years now.  The first lesson I learned was low temps and slow cooking, the second never add salt until your almost done (10-15 minutes).

This recipe combined with "Baby Back Ribs" submitted by Ken Heffner's cooking method is FANTASTIC!!! I cut back on the salt and pepper a bit, let the "rubbed" ribs sit in the fridge over night, slow roast in a foil covered pan with about 1/2" of cider (or apple juice off season) then finish with Sweet Baby Ray's  on the grill (or under the broiler during a blizzard). PERFECT ribs! Amazing! This comes out terrific even if you don't have time to marinate! Thank you Denise!

Made this as is except i cut the pepper in half for a family cookout. I allowed the ribs and chicken to marinate over night. Baked them at 220 low and slow for 3 hrs. Finished off on the grill with sweet baby rays sauce. Kids ate themselves silly.

*** for Baby back rib: the dry rub is too salty and peppery.  Next time I will try with half the salt and half the black pepper and perhaps double the amount of garlic powder.
* for chicken: doesn't work on chicken at all.

Best dry rub I have ever tried!  I have found the key is to use plenty.  I keep adding rub until it stays dry when rubbed in.

YUM!!!!!!!!!!  I use this as the base for all my rib recipes!  Today I made ribs in the slow cooker and put this rub on them before I put them in- like I usually do!  YUM!!!!  Thanks for making me a better cook, Denise!  UPDATE!  6/3/07  This has become our 'house' seasoning for ribs!  I rub the ribs with this seasoning and throw them in the slow cooker all day and then put them on the grill to baste with whatever the bbq sauce of our day happens to be.  This is great stuff and always starts the ribs off great!! Thanks for a classic!!

One of our best finds at allrecipes.com!  I always think rubs need to have a million different spices for them to be good -this simple recipe tops any I've tried.  I substitute Lawrey's season salt for the salt because that's what we had on hand -the results were excellent.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!!

Really great!!! I added a teaspoon of garlic powder and a touch of cayenne pepper.I thought since all of the reviews were so wonderful that I should double it, so I keep the extra rub in the fridge. Nothing but compliments,and it really does help to leave the seasoned meat in the fridge over night. Thank you so much for such an easy, flavorful rub!!!

This rub has really good flavour but I found the black pepper to be overpowering and a bit too spicy for my little ones. I also added an additional 2 tsp of garlic powder for a more garlicy taste, but that too was masked by the black pepper. I will make this again as written, but with much less pepper. Thanks for sharing, Denise!

Way way way too much pepper. Ruined ribs that took 10 hours to cook. 

Use one-fourth of the pepper suggested...there's no reason to add that much pepper over 10 hours.  

Tonights dinner tasted like Pepper Beef Jerky! Skip the rub, just use bbq sauce.

Awesome rub!  I used this reipe on May 24, 2009 (Memorial Day).  Used the rub on baby back ribs (remove the membrane on the back of the ribs then use rub), chicken and sausage.  Everyone raved about the meat and how good it tasted.  Denise, I used your rub along with Sweet Ray's Bar-b-que Sauce and I couldn't stop eating!  Thank you for sharing!

I normally just get spare rib and make them however I decide to make them that day. I will probably share some of my rib recipes now that I have registered. I registered today because i just HAD TO COMPLIMENT THIS RECIPE. It was the firsttime i made baby back ribs for one. I figured they probably werent all that different, leaner.. etc.. but I wanted to try a new recipe and I am so glad I did. This rub is fantastic. I read the reviews for this one and the Baby Back Ribs recipe where he says to marinate them in your bbq sauce in foil overnight then bake them in the foil and decided to use this rub, wrap them in the foil, left them overnight, baked them at 250 for a couple of hours and they were already awesome tasting and starting to fall off the bone at this point but when i grilled them over some charcoal and soaked hickory chips and basted them with brown sugar and hickory sweet baby rays for about 20 mins ( low heat ).. WOW. BEST ribs I have EVER EVER tasted. They were already the best when they came out the oven. The only ribs I have everhad that were better were from Dinosaur BBQ in New York and I dont think anything will ever top theirs but these were super.

I use this rub for ribs, ham (it's super!), before I bake a chicken, on a steak before I grill it...you get the picture!  It's versatile and awesome.  I added 1T cayenne pepper for a mild kick.

Had to see what this recipe was all about.  It was mentioned numerous times in the reviews for Kristy's bbq ribs.  Made these today with grilled prawns for Father's Day.  Everyone loved the flavor and 25 people cannot be wrong.  Thank you Denise and Kristy for a memorable bbq ;)

Excellent! This was our first barbeque of the season- plus this was the first time I ever made pork ribs.  My husband loves barbeque- of any kind and I wanted to make ribs for his birthday dinner.  This was great!  I put it on only about 2 hours before cooking- and the flavor was wonderful.  He couldnt stop raving about how good it was.  I used Bullseye bottled sauce for the final coating and it was awesome.  I am pretty happy that my first outing with ribs turned out so good.  It is the only recipe I will ever use!  I made these along with cole slaw and the Baked Corn recipe on this website.  Great birthday meal!  Thank you!

I will never be without this!  LOVE it!  Only change I made was to leave out salt as suggested in an earlier review, adding it at cooking time.  This is great on any meat also as topping for broiled fish. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

OMG! Best ribs ever!  the only difference I made was added a pinch on dried onion. I rubbed my ribs let them rest for 2 hours, baked in a 225 oven for 3 hours and 45 minutes on indirect heat on the BBQ, last 5 minutes put it over med heat...have to watch like a hawk thought because of all the brown sugar you don't want them to burn. Instead of basting with bbq sauce I used appple sauce! They really were sooooooo good!

I made this rub for ribs today.  The only change I made was to substitute onion salt for the regular salt (and only used about 1/2 as much as was called for).  I let the ribs marinate for 5 hours then baked in foil with a little BBQ sauce at 300 for 2 hours.  Then I grilled them for 15 minutes with more BBQ sauce.  My husband and I both loved the flavor this rub added to the meat!!  Great, easy way to make ribs.

Very tasty rub. I used this on baby back ribs after I removed the membrane from the back of the ribs and let it set in the fridge overnight. Came out great!

Perfect everytime! I use this on my babyback pork ribs and it's always a hit. I put the rib on 24 hours before cooking, then I put the ribs inside foil packets with about 1/4 applejuice or water and throw them on the grill! Cook them for 1-1.5 hours, take them out, slather them with even the cheapest barbeque sauce and you have a major hit!

This was mmm mmm good.  I used the rub and used some vinegar and italian dressing and allowed my ribs to marinate over night and then threw it on they came out WONDERFUL.  My friends and family kept going back for more.  I also put it on my chicken and pork chops and put those on the grill.  It was great.  I used seasoned salt instead of white salt and it's great.  Thanks Denise!

I reduced the salt and added some chili powder and onion powder to the mix.  This was good, but I found the black pepper to be too strong for my preference, so next time I'll reduce the black pepper as well.  I've used this not only on ribs, but also on pork chops and pork roast and really gives a good flavor while keeping the meat moist and juicy.

This dry rub is seriously ridiculous. SO GOOD! I used this rub (like other reviewers, removed the membrane on the back of the rack) and let it sit over night and most of the next day until ready to cook. Baked at 300 for 2 1/2 - 3 hrs (depending on size) after slathering in Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Finished on the grill. You will not be disappointed.

Followed suggestion of reviewer "sunnydale" with regards to sprinkling ribs with liquid smoke and then putting on the dry rub.  Fantastic!!!!! We have made them many times.  They turn out perfect everytime.  Rave reviews from everyone who eats them.  We don't even bother throwing them on the grill as they come out falling off the bones from the oven.  Have tried on beef ribs as well as pork.  Pork is the best.  Serving them today to a crowd of 20.

Excellent flavor.  I used fresh minced garlic and increase the amount (but I always increase the garlic!) and I also used come onion powder.  In the last 10 minutes or so of grilling, I just coated the ribs with a brushing of Lucille's barbecue sauce.  Delicious.  Grill the ribs very slowly, at least an hour and a half on very low temperature.

The flavor was excellent and the smell just made me hunger even more.  I used it on spare ribs as that is what I already had but think it would have been better on a nice rack of baby backs.  I also dipped the meat in cider vinegar before applying the rub to allow the rub to really penetrate....Mmmmmm!!! This sure was fantastic!!!

This is the best dry rub recipe ever! I used to love my ribs slathered in sauce, now I can only eat them if they have this rub on them. So many of my family and friends have wanted this recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I have been using this rub for years on my ribs and I get people asking me for the recipe all the time. It's a fantastic rub. Awesome flavour - the perfect amount of sweet and salty for pork. I reduce the amount of black pepper a lot because I'm not a huge fan of black pepper but have added a little cayenne instead once in awhile. I let the rub sit for a full 24 hours and then Q them. I've also use bbq over top of the rub for those folks who really want sauce on their ribs and they're still awesome tasting. Thanks for making my ribs the best in town, Denise!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe,and it was my first time making ribs,and it turned out to be a success,but the one thing i will say is to watch the pepper it over power the ribs a little bit,but other than that they were wonderful

amazing, but watch the pepper!!!!
i have to knock out a start because of the incredible amount of pepper in this. i read the first few reviews and not many ppl mention anything about the pepper. it took everything we had to eat the ribs with the original recipe, we almost threw it out. it was way too hot, and not in a good way either. so the second time we made it, i used 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1.5 tablespoon. i also doubled the garlic. and ommited the salt all together. i read somewhere that you should NEVER salt a dry rub. i used this on some bonesless ribs with bbq sauce whle cooking and it was amazing!!!

Absolutely excellent dry marinade. I used this on pork ribs. Added it 20 minutes before cooking based on other reviews. I used a slow cooker for 6 hours on low, and darn it if this rub didn't infuse itself into the meat. Awesome. Will add ancho chili powder or chipotle powder next time for a little heat.

I've made up the rub but I don't like the smell of it.  I may only try it on a small amount of ribs just in case it tastes like it smells.

Even before I could baste the ribs, which baked in the oven for 2.5 hours with the dry rub on, with BBQ sauce, everyone was grabbing them from the plate and exclaiming how great it tasted.

This dry rub is REALLY good. I did however, put about half the amount of pepper in than the recipe calls for. Cooked in the oven (covered) at 250 degrees F for about 2.5  hours with 1/2 bottle of beer as liquid in the bottom of the roaster. Take them out, cover with BBQ sauce and throw them on a smokin' hot grill.  SO, so good!

I used this dry rub on a boneless pork shoulder roast in the slow cooker. It turned out great.  Sliced an onion and placed in the bottom of crock pot. I sprinkled the pork roast with a little salt and pepper and made the rub with only the brown sugar, paprika, and garlic powder.  Cooked for 8 hours on low and used juices to make gravy, thickening with cornstarch. We served it with rice and steamed asparagus.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks.

This rub added good flavor to the ribs. I added additional garlic powder and left the salt out until the last 2 hours of marinating time (total hours 24).

I got this receipe for our ribs and my husband raved about the seasoning! He said the ribs were comparable to the Rendezvous Rib restaurant in Memphis, TN-the very best ever. I like a sauce so I just poured some Mesquite Bar-b-que sauce over. Delicious! Thanks, Denise

This is one of our favorite combinations for seasoning pork.  Just awesome!  It yields the perfect quantity for our family since I prefer to make rubs as needed rather then store them.  I have yet to try this on chicken but I bet it would be great.  Definately worth making when you plan on grilling pork chops!

Too spicy!  Had a major coughing fit and neither hubby nor I could continue eating the ribs.  Used recipe as written but did not barbecue.  Marinated @ 8 hrs and cooked in oven at 350.  I would like to try it again perhaps using half the pepper and paprika.

Rub was hot until it was cooked, at which point it was really just sweet. I was hoping it'd be hotter. As for the complete final tasting I'd have to try it again, the ribs it was on weren't the best quality.

Great on chicken.  Grilled after marinating for 24 hours.  Chicken was very moist and rub created a crispy outer layer that was incredible.  Not too spicy either.

Loved this rub, actually have 2 different versions in my cabinet now, the original for my chicken, and one with half the pepper but added a teaspoon of onion powder for steaks and such.  My first attempt at bbq'ing dry rubs and the neighbors still won't leave me alone about doing it again.  thanks

Oh, my... this was MARVELOUS!!  Followed a previous reviewers advice and let the rub sit on the ribs for 24 hours, then baked for 3 hours on 275F before putting them on the grill for 5 minutes on each side.  Awesome!  Fabulous!  Marvelous!  PERFECTION!

My goodness, what a great rub! You'd never think that a few simple spices and sugar mixed together could create such a unique and wonderful flavour. This rub is great on ribs, chicken, pork - everything!! I love this recipe and it's definitely a keeper!

This rub is AWESOME! The first time we used just the rub on our ribs and they were pretty good. Next time we used the rub and added some barbeque sauce for the last 10 minutes of grilling, they are the BEST ribs we have ever had. We have made them several times and everyone LOVES them this way.

This was very good.  I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder to the mix.  I rubbed it on steaks and everyone loved it.  This was my first attempt using a dry rub and I was very pleased.  I'll be using this again.

Okay so there's an issue with this rub that I have found. For my family it's so hot from all the spices that it makes the meat inedible! However if I reduce the 1 1/2 TBS to tsp, it's absolutely delicious!

Very good! I added 1 tsp. onion powder, 1/2 tsp cumin and cut the salt to 1 Tbsp. It was yummy. Loved it and very easy. I rubbed it on thick and cooked the ribs in the oven at 325 until they fell apart.

Love this rub.  I make it exactly as written.  Gives a great flavor and not too spicy.  My 10 year old was happy as a clam after I smoked 3 racks of ribs for 6 hours yesterday with this rub and light coat of BBQ sauce.  He loves ribs!

Excellent base! I added some cayenne, coriander and Adobo seasoning. I had some boneless ribs that needed to be cooked, and for more people than I bargained for. I cut up the ribs into cubes, marinated them in the rub for a few hours & then stuck them onto skewers for the grill. They'd created some "juice" in the marinade dish so I basted them with that juice while they cooked. Incredibly moist and tasty! (If you use wooden skewers don't forget to soak them first so they don't burn!)

This rub was good, but it needed a little more "zip" for my taste.  Next time I make it, I'll take the suggestion of some other reviewers & add some red pepper.

I made the recipe exactly as it called for, but I added 1 teaspoon of onion powder and I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and waited to salt the ribs until right before I put them in the oven.

I rubbed the rest of the spices on the ribs, wrapped them in foil and put them in the frig for about 5 hours before putting them in a 350 oven for an hour and a half.  Then I charred them on the grill.

They were yummy, but I wished for just a little more flavor.

Per other reviews I halved the salt and black pepper, but still didn't like this at all. WAY too strong on the paprika IMO.

Really great, and easy. Nicely spiced and incredibly tender.

I did not marinate.  I boiled the ribs first, as recommended by our butcher, before cooking them for 2 hours.  

Used 1 T of salt only - still too much on all but the most meaty ribs.  Also used spanishe paprika, and mustard powder.

Really really good rub, but a little salty.  Will use half the amount next time.  My son ate them dry then wet, and said it was better with the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!

All time favorite! I've used this many times for  baby back ribs as my base.  Wrap it tightly with foil and refridgerate overnight. Bake it at 320 for 2-2.5 hrs. After baking, take out the ribs and transfer to a grill (or broil it) and baste it with my favorite BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Rays or AR's Big Al's) to carmelize. Minor changes: -1/4 T salt, cut pepper in half, and half of garlic powder.

OMG.. what a great rub! Though I did change it just a bit. Instead of regular salt I used garlic salt. And instead of garlic powder I used onion powder. It was the perfect ribs for the Fourth of July cookout!

This was my first time making baby back ribs and this rub was perfect! I slathered it on and baked them in the oven for 2 hours at 250 degrees, then put them on the grill for 15 minutes to crisp them up. We painted on a little bit of barbecue sauce while grilling and they turned out perfect!

This is an awesome rib rub.  I adjusted the amount of salt to 3/4 T and the pepper to 1 T for personal taste.  It marinated overnight then I added my favorite BBQ sauce, double wrapped ribs in foil and baked for 2 1/2 hours at 300 degrees.  I then open up the foil packet and broiled them for a few minutes to caramelize the BBQ sauce.  I have also thrown them on the grill to caramelize the BBQ sauce.  I made this for company and everyone said they were amazing.  One of our guests was from the south and said it rivaled the ribs down there.  This will be my rib rub recipe to go to.

This is a great rub! the only change I made was that I cut the salt down to 1 tbsp. I baked them in the oven at 300 degrees for 2 1/2 hours, then grilled them for about 10 minutes total while basting them with Sweet Baby Ray's sauce. My boys ate theirs without the barb. sauce and asked for seconds. My husband loved them!

Amazing! Be sure to 1) remove the membrane, 2) apply the dry rub, 3)marinade for 8+ hours, 4) cook 2 hours at 300. I cut each into two, or three rib sections. That way they are easier to serve to a group. I like to bake several racks at a time. Once they cool slightly, I pop them into food saver bags and freeze them in meal size portions. They are perfect for a quick summer dinner. I thaw them and reheat  them on the grill with Sweet Baby Rays sauce. Delicious! In fact, I am going to go make a batch right now!!!

I tripled this recipes for several racks of ribs and found it to have way too much black pepper.  Next time I use it in  that quantity I'll scale back the black pepper so that the other flavors can shine through.

Great dry rub, although I agree not to add the salt till 10 mins before cooking.
If you have a large enough grill (3 burners or more) put them on the back with front burner on low and leave them for 3 hours.
Don't touch, turn, or mess with them. They'll be fine .... correction, more than fine ... they'll be great!!!

This rub was very good, although, next time I'm going to reduce the amount of pepper. A little too spicy for the family.That being said, I really liked it and will definitely try it again.

A very good and basic rub. However, I did increase the amount of brown sugar by 2 tbsp. the second time and thought it was much better. Also, I used kosher salt instead of table salt and thought it added to the flavor rather than making it "salty" as some reviewers had stated.

I took the advice and cut down on the pepper, but not the salt. Wish I had; it was way too salty.  Cut the salt in half.  Otherwise, very good.

I used this rub on thick sirlon beef steaks and it worked really well. I added some cayenne pepper as suggested by others. Can't wait to try it again using other spices in place of the paprika. I think rosemary would work well with beef.

Delicious but a bit salty for my taste.  I used boneless, country-style pork ribs and baked them in the oven for about 45 minutes first. (45 minutes was too much--next time I will bake them less; I'm just paranoid about uncooked meat!)  Then my husband grilled them, basting them with barbecue sauce.  
The dry rub is pretty versatile--it sounds odd, but the next day I took the leftover ribs, sliced them thinly and served them with a cold Asian noodle dish and a Korean cucumber salad.

This rub is the best.  I have used it on spare ribs as well as chicken wings.  Each was definatley finger-licking good.  I added a few more spices like cajun, pepper flakes seasoning and used lawry seasoning salt.  I did cook the spareribs on the stove with salt and pepper since i did not have the time to marinate.  The cooking process also got rid of the excess fat and didn't get "runny". Drained and baked in oven for about 2 hrs.   After baking, thew it under the broiler, brushed both sides of spare rib with BBQ sauce, 15mins each side.  Absolutely, delicious!!!!!!

It was a little spicy and I was worried about all of the salt but the pepper evened everything out.  My boyfriend loves it and I ended up saving the remains for another time.  I will use this recipe from now on instead of buying a dry rub at the grocery store.

FANTASTICO!!!!  Great method.  Modified it a little for our taste.  I used two tsp. of cayenne pepper and gasped for air.  So-o-oo I reduced it to a 1/4 tsp.   But a nice way to get a beautiful rib taste.  I also remove the silver skin on back of my ribs - helps get the dry rub in.  :)

This recipe is so quick to prepare.  There are so many cuts of meat that you could use it on.  I used about 3 tbsp of the rub on 3 pork chops the first time I used it, and they came out great.

First time I made ribs with a rub and it was the BOMB!!
Super tender & juicy baby back ribs for our home BBQ on the Fourth.   Just wished we had another slab for seconds because they were so good they were gone too quick!  Super Yum.

This recipe is superb!!!!   There is a guy (McCoys BBQ) who has a smoker set up on the weekends on RT 3 headed to Culpeper, VA, from Spottsylvania.  He has, hands-down, the best ribs we've ever eaten. Outside of the tenderness and texture, the rub is the best!    It's worth the one hour drive to get this guy's ribs...and I've been trying to figure out exactly what makes up the rub he puts on them.

I made ribs today with THIS recipe and so far this is the closest I've found, yet, to McCoy's ribs.  I gave a rack of ribs to my next door neighbor and told him he might want to put some sauce on them....15 minutes later he was telling me how incredible the ribs were and he didn't think they needed any sauce at all.  

The only change I had...small one, is that I have a bag of smoked salt which I used instead of the regular salt.

As this was the first time that I've made this recipe, I made it as is.  Very good rub....I put on baby back ribs, wrapped in foil and let them sit in the fridge overnight.  I baked in oven at 225° still wrapped in the foil for an hour and one-half and then turned the oven off and just let them sit in there all day until I was ready to make dinner.  I finished them on our gas grill, just heated up one side on low and put ribs on opposite side.  Finished with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce at the end of the grill time.  The ribs were delicious and tender.  I had extra rub which I put on half of a cut up chicken, vacuum sealed and then put in the freezer for another meal.  I will, however, cut back on the black pepper next time I use this rub.  I could definitely taste the spice/heat of the pepper a little more than I would have liked to.

Inedible!  I cut the black pepper to 2 teaspoons and it was still inedible. Way too much pepper. The next day my husband washed the leftover ribs under hot running water and rubbed them with his fingers to try to remove the pepper -- still couldn't eat them. To the trash!

I really like how easy this is. I actually use it for stew meat for a soup I make. However, I don't put brown sugar in. It gives the soup just the right amount of kick!

This is my go-to rub for pork roasts and ribs. I do watch my roasts in the oven & loosely tent them toward the end since the sugars tend to get burned. We go through a whole (organic, whey-fed) pig every year, and this rub is perfect for adding a little zing without smothering the incredible, natural flavor of our pork.

Fabulous recipe! I've used this dry rub recipe for a couple yrs now.Depending on who's coming to dinner (grandkids) or people who don't like it too spicy, I might cut back on the black pepper. My grill is on the fritz so I simply rub on the ribs, fold up into a double foil packet then refrigerate overnight. Next day I place them (unopened) into a slow 250 degree oven to slow cook for about 3-4, hours. (I've even placed the packets in my slow cooker to cook low all day) From here you can put BBQ sauce on and grill but ours never made it that far. This dry rub recipe is just THAT good!

If you used smoked paprika instead of regular, and halved the salt, this is a 5 star rub. :)

We really love this one. It's super easy. I often do large batches and freeze them. As noted by another reviewer, if making ahead, and certainly for freezing, make the rub without the salt and add the salt just before or as they hit the grill.

Wow!  I used to boil for an hour, then grill to bake on the BBQ sauce.  I will never do that again.  This was amazing.  I did the rub and refrigerate for 3 hours, then bake for 4 hours at 300 degrees covered with foil. OMG, fall off the bone and awesome flavor.  I changed the way I do ribs from now on.  Thank you for this technique, it's new to me and I love it.

Decided to make this recipe at the last minute when I realized we needed to leave in 30 minutes to make our BBQ. I rubbed yellow mustard onto the ribs and then put the rub on top and massaged it all in. Very good and great flavor!

This was fantastic.  I had never made ribs before and I was looking for something simple and tasty.  I did what others said and left out some of the salt.  I wrapped the rubbed ribs in foil and put them in a pan in the oven for about an hour and a half and then we put them on the grill with a little BBQ sauce to caramelize.  I planned on making them "sloppy" after we took them off the grill with more BBQ sauce, but we didn't need to! Next time, we won't use any sauce because the rub was absolutely perfect.

I used this marinade on pork loin and it was overwhelmingly too peppery...overpowered the marinade and the pork!!  I would cut the pepper in half just to be on the safe side!  Otherwise it was great.  I love a good dry rub recipe!

I like to add about 1/2 cup of raw onions. The juice from the onions turns this into a paste and makes it stick to the ribs while I marinate them. After about 3 hours of marinating, they are ready to be slow cooked and enjoyed!

This recipe is great! I oven baked my ribs and they turned out delish.

ETA: Since I was feeding this to my kids, I reduced spices to half.  I prefer to use a sharp paprika rather than a sweet.  I also tried this on chicken and didn't like it at all.  I will be sticking with ribs as the meat choice.

Pretty good and pretty simple!  Cut the salt drastically and used have the black pepper.  Just sprinkled a bit of salt on top before baking.  Baked, covered at 275 degrees for 2 1/2 hours - last 20 minutes basted with BBQ sauce.  Fell off the bone and had great flavor.  Ingredients are always in the pantry, so will be using again.

Loved this recipe..I added spice thou I put the dry rub directly on the ribs and baked in oven covered at 350 for 3 hours about 5lbs then i let it sit for 30 min put on grill and add additional dry rub or wet depending on preference.  They fall off the bone yummy I add a pic of the ribs out of the oven before grilling

I'd back off on the garlic powder and salt and pepper just a little, but otherwise, this recipe rocks.  6 hours of marinating, and cooked on bbq, indirect heat for 1 hour, average temp was 375 degrees.  Fall off the bone, lots of flavor. Highly recommended this.

This is the best dry rub for ribs! My only go to recipe. I have used this recipe on beef and pork ribs and it is absolutely delicious on either. You will not be disappointed. Do not alter this recipe, because it is PERFECT as is.

This Rib Rub is on the MONEY!!!  I changed the black pepper to half black and half red pepper to spice it up a notch.  I also added and 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder.  The rub came out GREAT!!!

Used this on one rack of pork spare ribs. I didn't have any garlic powder, what a horrible cook! LOL Any how I used the other ingredient as written and rubbbed crushed garlic over the meat, then rubbed it the mix and wrapped the garlic up with the rack and refridgerated overnight. I could definately could taste the flavor of the rub after addition of the sauce, normally it is over powered. I just opened the foil poured on sauce, closed the foil 2 hrs 15 min @ 300, then under broiler for 10 minutes. Next time I will experiment with 1 teaspoon cayenne.

Excellent! I'm sure it could be improved, but it's really good as it is, and simple... like all great recipes.  Salting too early? This is a controversial subject. I don't buy into it because I've done my own testing. I recommend everyone make their own decision.

This was a simple easy to make rub. Not too spicy or too overpowering. I doubled this and had enough for 2 racks of ribs and a brisket and still had some left. I used kosher salt just because. Thanks, I'll probably use this one again, it was really decent.

I made this for last night's "feast".  I had 4 racks of baby back pork ribs.  
I doubled the rub recipe.  Rubbed most of it on the ribs, wrapped them and let them set overnight in the refrigerator.

Yesterday I cooked them,still wrapped, in tin foil on 325 for two hours.  Let them set in the oven till they cooled off a bit and then back into the fridge.

Last night we grilled them and let them set covered for a while and served them with heated bbq sauce on the side.

Just great.  Oh, I didn't use any salt at all.  And I think I would use less pepper next time.

This is our new rib recipe!

Excellent dry rub. I halve the salt and it's great! I put the dry rub on the ribs about 4-6 hrs before and then baste with Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and then wrap in foil packages. Place on foiled cookie sheet (for any oozing)and bake in 300' oven for 1 hr 45 minutes. Then pull out and let sit in foil packages another 30 minutes or so. Then unwrap and light barbie an dplace ribs on barbie to warm up and crisp up the meat while adding more barbie sauce. Excellent, will only make ribs this way forever!!!!

Excellent! My fiance was surprised to see me putting brown sugar into the mixing bowl, but when it was all done he said it smelled like BBQ potato chips! I added 1/4 tsp of dry mustard to the recipe and the ribs seared beautifully.

I can't quite put my finger on it, but something wasn't quite right with the flavoring for my husband and I.  Made exactly as the recipe said, and we thought it was okay, not great.  Will keep tweaking the recipe - my first thought is a little more sugar, a little less paprika, and maybe some cayenne pepper?

I wanted something good to put on pork chops and this was it!  I cut down on the pepper a bit, but used everything else in the exact amounts.  So good!!  I didn't have time to marinate them and they were still awesome!  I'm making them again for my brother on Monday.

This dry rub is awesome!  I've always been so used to a wet sauce when it comes to bbq'in.  Watching the food net work "Diners, drive ins and dives", Guy usually stops at several BBq joints and they always use a dry rub.  So I thought why not.  I really don't want to try any others.  We bought a Brinkman smoker and pork ribs and pork steak and put some soaked hickory chips in foil and smoked slow and low, OMG!  Amazing.  I'm going to wally world to buy extra ingredients so I can make a huge batch and place in air tight container and have on hand at all times.  Thanks for a great recipe! :)

This rub is wonderful.  I cheat a bit with my ribs.  I boil then the night before then put the rub on the ribs and let them list in the frig overnight. Then for dinner the next day I grill them on low and seal in the flavors. At the end of grilling I put a very light coating of b-b-q sauce. However these are wonderful without the sauce. I boil the ribs because I don't have the hours to slow cook them so they are super tender.

Great rub that can be adjusted for your taste.

Cut back on the pepper if you like sweet ribs.  Add some pepper if you like spice.  Leave it alone if you are in between.

Will be added to my favorite list.

Great rub!  I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it was just the right amount of sugar to balance out the spice.

The rub was made according to the recipe and used on baby back ribs.  The ribs were extremely salty, and the salt taste was dominant.  I would highly recommend reducing the salt quantity if you make this rub.  We will try this again, but cut the salt in 1/2.

A+ This is the first time I have used a rub on pork, and I and my family was happy to enjoy.  I had to cut the salt in half due to my wife having CHF but all in all, it was terrific!

Great rub for beef ribs!!! I added 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and 1/4 cup minced onions. Then added "Bubba's best BBQ sauce" to the last 10 min. of grilling. Even people that didn't like beef ribs loved mine!

Awesome and soo easy.  I boiled the baby back ribs for an hour, marinated with the rub for 2 hrs and then put them on the grill for about 20 min on high.  Great!!  A little spicy with all the black pepper but we liked it!

This was very good on beef ribs weve tried on both gas and briquettes and is fantastic. Messed up and put the same amount of garlic as the other ingredients but turned out even better.

I cut the peppers in half and same with the salt and it was still too spicy. The saltyness was ok after i cut it in half. I also drizzled honey over the top of the ribs before rubbing them. They were good but only my dad and I would eat them.

This is the easiest and best dry rub recipe I've ever tried.  We've tried it on baby back ribs, boneless ribs, and chicken (on the bbq grill, of course!), and it just improves the taste of the meat so very much!  We usually use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce at the end of cooking...scrumptious!

Very good! I also added a touch of cayenne pepper (about 1\2 Tsp. I like a bit of bite) and an extra 1\2 Tsp. of Garlic Powder. Very, very good!

I have had a hard time with ribs in the past but thins have now changed. The longer it sits it will have a bit more bite to it, if you like it less spicy, decrease the pepper a bit. My family says these are some of the best ribs the have had!

I added this to the Bay Back Ribs recipe on this site as someone else had recommended and it was really good!  I also used it on a 4LB pork butt and slow baked it to make pulled pork and both recipes were a hit at my Super Bowl party last night!  I will definitely make this again and again!  GO BUCS!!!

I cut the salt down as well to 1-1/2 tsp. and it was fine. My wife is not big on pork ribs but she really liked the flavor and texture the rub gave to the ribs.

Excellent!  I have bbq'd for years, and we are just starting to use rubs.  This is wonderful.  The brown sugar really compliments the rest of the ingredients.  I will recommend it to all of my friends.

After reading all of the reviews and making this recipe, I did agree with cutting down on the salt. I also did add some Oregano and made a big batch of this recipe for later use. Overall, good recipe meriting reuse. No extra sauce needed if you add more of the rub on each side of your ribs and bake in oven for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.

rubbed it on short ribs and marinated with bottled bbq sauce  in aluminum foil for eight hours, and it turned out fantastic. For short times, we'll probably cut back on the pepper, but for 8hrs to 16 hr marinating, it's great the way it is. We ate ribs for three days and it was delicious ! It was also impressive on hamburgers we grilled on the Geo foreman grill. Yumm yumm!  can't wait to try it on chicken.

We really liked this rub, and that says a lot because we've been looking for the perfect rub for ribs for a long time! The only thing missing is a hearty dash of cayenne pepper- which I added. I also used Kosher salt vs regular salt and Smoked Paprika vs regular. I let these sit with the rub for 6 hrs, then baked the baby back ribs at 275 for 2.5 hrs. After baking, grilled them for just a few minutes more after slathering with BBQ sauce. Best homemade ribs I've ever made!

Tried it on smoked baby back ribs.   
Rubbed in 
3 hours wrapped in plastic and brought to room temp  
3 hours of smoke at 225 
1 hour foiled at 225.     
1 hour more bare 225.   

Good results.... Recipe had enough for two racks.     I thought celery seed might be a good addition next time.

Great Spice rub for pork ribs. I found that this recipe is enough for two racks of ribs.

I put on the dry rub, sous vide the ribs for 36--48 hours at 145 degrees Fahrenheit, and then put some BBQ sauce overtop of the dry rub and and finish the ribs on the BBQ.

Very good, simple rub to make. I brushed olive oil over the ribs first so the rub would adhere better and it did. We did not marinate at all. I put it into the oven immediately. It came out delicious, a bit on the spicy side. Wonderful taste. I would use it again.

Way too much salt.  I had to rinse the meat twice after cooking due to it being so salty.

I reduced salt and pepper by 1/2 Tbls. And only did a sprinkle of paprika (since it’s not a spice I care for).  Marinated overnight and made on the smoker.  Very good.  Will do it again.  I did rub the underside of the ribs with a bit of yellow mustard befor refrigerating over night.

So faw this was the best and easiest rib recipe I've ever made. I was going to only leave sit for 1 hour but my plans changed and I left in the fridge over night. I cooked on the grill for about 1 1/2  hours on indirect heat. They were wonderful. Very flavorful and tender. The best time wise recipe ever!

I used only 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. pepper.   Added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. I do not like really spicey ribs. Rubbed on ribs and cooked, standing up for 25 min in my Insta Pot. They turn out so tender and delicious! Put on the grill or in the broiler with Bar b que sauce for 5 min. Or so to brown. They fall off the bone. I use St. Louis ribs because they are more meaty.

Perfect.  Just enough seasoning and so good. I didn't use the amount of salt that was suggested, I used a lot less because i just don't like salt,  and it came out great.  We will be making this again!

Used this rub on a pork shoulder that I then smoked for about 12 hours.  It came out great with a lovely smokey flavor that was complimented by the sugar and salt in the rub.  It was also very juicy and tender, thanks to the large fat-cap on the top that basically acted like an auto baster for the meat.  I did smoke it in a foil pan to prevent the juices from escaping the meat, as well.  Wood chips were only used during the first hour of cooking, then the vents were closed and it was allowed to slow-cook the rest of the 12 hours until it hit 180 IT.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a picture before we'd already devoured half of it.  The rest will be for some delicious pulled-pork sandwiches.

I used this rub on bone-in chicken breast, baked them, then added BBQ sauce and broiled them a few minutes to get that delicious stickiness. There was too much pepper in this rub for our taste, so I'll cut it down to 1/2 Tablespoon next time. Overall this is a great recipe and I can't wait to try it again

My family loved it. Too much pepper for me, but I am really sensitive to spices so I'll cut back on the salt and pepper for mine next time, but leave it as is for everyone else! I didn't marinade the ribs or anything, just followed advice on here to apply the rub just before cooking. I also used liquid smoke before using the rub. At the end I did a honey brown sugar glaze and the ribs were fantastic. Thanks!! Planning on making a huge jar to keep on hand.

I would take Brooksie’s advice with a grain of salt.  The salt actually wakes up the flavor of meat, breaks down the proteins and helps meat retain water.   Ever brine a turkey for Thanksgiving? Same concept.  This is a very good rub and don’t be afraid to marinate overnight.

We butcher our own pigs. I'll make this dry rub and put it on any cut - loins, ribs, roast, and bag it and freeze it.  Later I'll pull it out and put it into the crock pot and cook for 8 hours.  It's the most amazingly delicious pork!

Made the ribs in the instant pot after marinating the ribs in this rub overnight.  Fall off the bone deliciousness before the BBQ sauce is added to caramelize it!   Only thing I added was some chili powder and some onion powder (dehydrated myself and ground up).  Delicious!  You could add red pepper flakes if you like it really spicy.  Would be great on other meats also.

Very good rub, second time making it I used a tblsn of salt because most meat is already salty, and a tblsn of garlic. I didn't really taste garlic the first time around.  Very good rub and I received several compliments on it.

I was looking for a rub for slow cooker spareribs and most were the same as this, but also added an equal amount of onion powder, which I did. I really like the flavour. I was asked to come here to review this and when I read it over again, it's actually the only one that said to marinate it, which I will do next time to see if it makes any difference. Thanks for sharing your recipe!  UPDATE.  I did this the other day with a few revisions. I took 2 other members advice and added onion powder (like before)  and liquid smoke.  I also marinated it. TO DIE FOR!!  I will always do it this way from now on as it's my fav dry rib rub.

Great simple rub. 

I cheated a bit - I'm not much of a planner/multi-day cooker. I applied the rub (minus salt) let it marinate for approximately 20 minutes, then applied liquid smoke and the salt (reduced to 1 TB). Baked them at 300°F for 1 hour uncovered, then 1.25-1.5 hours covered by aluminum foil. Then I applied BBQ sauce and baked them uncovered at 450° for 5-7 minutes (FYI, very smokey as the rub and sauce burnt on the foil- but baked the BBQ sauce in). So good.

 Am sinking into into a meat coma as I write this.

I thought this was a great rub and glad I had all the ingredients on hand.  The recipe I used for the ribs called for the ribs to be basted with Dijon mustard first and then the rub.  The combo together tasted great!  It made quite a bit so I'm saving half of it for the next set of ribs.

I will DEFINATELY make this again.  Everyone loved the ribs with this rub. I left it on overnight and am glad I read the other reviews because it did leak during the night in the fridge.  I will also cook the ribs in a roasting bag at 300 for two hours next time.  I tried 4 hours at 250 and the ribs fell off the bone as I tried to serve them!  Tender beyond compare!!    I'm glad I left the rub on overnight. Great kick to the flavor!  Thanks DENISE!

I have used this a quite a few times this summer now on ribs and pork chops! It is really tasty! I keep it on hand now, so I can quickly fix something for the grill. 
I took the advice of some reviewers and went way down on the salt. 
I imagine over time I will tweak it to suit our taste, but so far it has been a good combination! And the meat was never dry!!!

I made this recipe it was amazing,however I lowered the amount of salt the recipes as for to 1/2 a tbl spoon. I also increased the amount of sugar to 1/4 of a cup . This covered a rack of ribs. . Cooking time,I cooked the rack of ribs covered with aluminum foil on 280 degrees for 1/2 hrs. Then put it under the broiler for 5 min finished it off at 300 degrees for an additional 15 min.

I made this for a pork roast that we smoked. It was a little sweet and a little salty. I will use this again, but reduce the brown sugar to 1 1/2 Tb. and reduce the salt to 1 Tb. I followed the recipe to a T but added a few dashes of red pepper flakes. I also used another reviewers suggestion to rub the meat with liquid smoke first. 2nd review: I added only 1 1/2 T. of brown sugar and 1 T. salt this time, used smoked paprika which added to the spiciness :) and added a teaspoon of onion powder. This is really good! Again I used it for a bone in pork shoulder roast that I smoked. I will keep using this rub!

Used smoked paprika on a pork loin.  Bit too much smoky... still nice flavor,  want to try again and see if just regular paprika improves it even more.

Made this tonight...very good with a couple of adjustments. 1.  I thought the amount of salt in this recipe seemed awfully high, so I reduced it to 1.5 teaspoons and so glad I did...it was just the right amount, more would have been too salty!  2.  I would use less pepper next time, maybe just 1 TBS. 

I cooked one meaty slab at 300 for about 1hr 45min, then put on sauce, turned oven to 450 and cooked for about 15min until sauce carmelized. Will make again for sure!

We basically do 2:1:1:1:1 ratio with brown sugar bring the 2. We make it in bulk and use it for pork ribs, thick cut BBQ bacon, and chicken breasts. An amazing BBQ rub. Brown sugar makes an excellent crust. I don't think I'd recommend it for beef.

These are fantastic! I didn't change anything with the seasonings. I do put the ribs in the oven with the bbq
sauce for about 30 min. Also I have a new crock pot and mine were ready in about 5 1/2 hours. Will continue to make!

My "go to" rub. I make it with half regular paprika and half smoked paprika. Really adds a kick to it. I also wrap in foil overnight and then bake in the foil on a cookie sheet at 325 for two hours or until tender. Then I just put it on a hot grill long enough to crisp the outside up just a bit. Fork tender and fall off the bone moist!

Cut the salt in half as others noted, let it marinate overnight and it tasted great!

I'll be putting on my ribs tonight. I used smoked paprika, added 1tsp onion pwdr, 1tsp cayenne pwdr, and less than the TBS salt called for. The pepper I used was fresh ground peppercorn. I blended the ingredients in my magic bullet, to an even consistency. Tasted with just my finger, really happy I used the smoked paprika!cant wait for dinner!!

Great recipe for ribs but who would ever let rub sit on there ribs for more than 1 hr. I did add double he grown sugar which gave the ribs a actual glaze without using Bbq sauce

Too much salt!!  I was without garlic powder which would have added a nice flavor.  I think next time I'll increase the brown sugar, decrease the salt and pepper by half.  It was awesome watching it caramelize on the grill, lots of smoke too, but much too salty.  I will admit I didn't let it soak overnight, that may have allowed some of the salt and spices to work their way in a bit better.

This rub is a bit too flavourful for my taste.  I already cut the salt to 1 tbsp only.  It didn't taste bad, just overpowering.  I couldn't really enjoy the flavour of the meat.

I had to omit the salt because of dietary restrictions in my household, and I used only 1 tablespoon of black pepper.  I like it but my boyfriend found it too peppery.  Next time I will cut another 1/2 tablespoon of the black pepper and add another teaspoon of garlic powder.  Kept the meat nice and juicy!

Used this recipe for a pork tenderloin. I did add a bit of coffee to it, but I think it's a minor change, and I'm still reviewing the original recipe. I allowed the pork to marinate overnight, then smoked on the grill. I gotta say it tasted great! I have to believe that the people complaining about saltiness are using table salt. I would recommend using kosher or some other coarse grain salt (actually, I wouldn't suggest using table salt in any non-baking recipe). When all else fails, taste as you add!

Wasn't good for my family. After all the good reviews, I wanted to try this. There wasn't much flavor at all. I even added extra of the brown sugar. I really wanted to like it, but it just was bland. Maybe I'll try it again, but add more to it.

I tried this for the first time tonite and it's pretty good but I suggest cutting back on the pepper. It's got a little too much of a bite for me. I took up the suggestion of cutting back on the salt. I'll definitely try it again.

This is excellent and so easy.  I alter the amounts just a little for our taste - a little less paprika, a little more garlic powder.  I then bake in a 300 degree oven for 2 1/2 hours.  Ribs come out juicy and tender every time.  A real favorite, especially because it can be done any season, regardless of weather.

This was very easy and tasty, but a little bit too salty for my taste (many such rubs seem to be so). I'll make it again, but cut the salt way back. It needs to have some salt, but not this much. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used some smoked paprika and some sweet, which had a nice effect since I was slow-roasting the ribs in the oven.

I used this rub many times and it's a hit everytime.  I omitted the salt until ready to bake and also added BBQ sauce.  Broiled it for the last 3-5 minutes to give it a nice color.  However, be careful cuz the foil caught fire cuz. of the sauce on the foil.  I would tuck the foil nicely underneath the ribs before broiling.

Really Great Rub for a Pork Tenderloin on a Grill! I tried it just like this and it was amaizing, but  the next time I substituded the Paprika out for Tandori Seasoning, cause I love Indian Food, and it was also very very good. The key is that Brown Sugar on a Grill! Sooooooo Good! Thanks  Brian from Vancouver BC

This is exactly what Denise promised "a super simple dry rub."  So, naturally I added two things.  1 teaspoon onion powder and I split the paprika:  1 tablespoon regular paprika and 1/2 tablespoon smoked paprika.  The smoked paprika gives it an added depth. I use this rub for brisket, chicken you name it.  It's the best.

I thought these were great, but I did get feedback that the usual delicious, gooey sauce was missed. I will probably try this again with sauce, and I think that would bump it up to 5 stars!

My kids don't like bar-b-q sauce so I needed an alternative. I absolutely love it. The kids ask for it. I even used the brown sugar splenda blend in the recipe and it came out great.

Just tried this rub out and my family really liked it.  I didn't have time to let it marinate for 8 hours.  It was more like 4 hours but still worked great.  Will make it again.

I use this rub recipe with the Baby Back Ribs recipe by KHEFFN from this site. The ribs always turn out amazing. I would prefer a rub with a little more spice, but I think this is perfect to serve to guests.

I've made this 3 times.  The first time I followed the exact recipe - other than I only use Sea Salt.  It was toooooo salty. I can't imagine how salty it would have been with morton's salt.  2nd time - I only used 2 grinds of the sea salt crystals, way way better.  It is a very good rub - just either cut out the salt - or just put a dash or 2 of salt.

I left out the salt completely.
First I grilled the ribs for 20 min.
When they were cool, I rubbed them and wrapped them up tightly.  After overnight in the Fridge, I wrapped them in foil with a little water and back them at 325 for 3 hours.  No added sauce;falling off the bone perfect!

Wonderful recipe! It was my 1st time making a dry rub and I wanted something simple and easy. I put the ribs on broil for about 3 -5 minutes just to get the top a little crispy. The ribs were delicious and I definitely plan on making them again.

We found this to be way to salty and a little too much pepper. Would have probably been better with half the ammount of salt and pepper.

This recipe worked out great for country ribs.  I put the rub on the ribs over night then in a crock pot the next moring and slow cooked all day.  I used Kosher Salt and the taste of the rub on the ribs was terrific.  I will definitely make again!!

Gave the meat a good flavor and kept it juicy...not the typical rib meat and bottled BBQ sauce dinner. We made the recipe exactly as written. Five stars!

Easy, tasty, awesome!  Be careful with the salt, it was a bit strong in this recipe.  Next time (hopefully soon) I will halve the salt this calls for.

Absolute best rub for pork baby back ribs. Except, I add some cayenne pepper for a kick. I smother this generously on ribs and bake in oven for about 1-2 hours. Then grill over hot coals for about 15-20 minutes with your fave bbq sauce. The meat will be so tender and the bbq is nicely caramelized. People have asked for this recipe at parties!

INCREDIBLE!  I added some chili powder as recommended by other reviewers and  smoked the ribs with hickory in my electric smoker for 2 hours.  Even though I only let the rub sit for an hour or so, they were the best ribs I've ever had!!!!

Very good. I added onion powder and left the rub on the baby backs overnight and then used the sauce from Barbecue Ribs by Kristy on this site. Excellent!

I would rate this at 4 1/2 stars. I have used this on ribs, chicken, and steak.  It can be a little too spicy for the young ones.  I scaled and made this in bulk and packaged in nice glass containers and gave for Christmas gifts.

great chicken. I let the chickens sit for 24 hrs after using the dry rib rub on them. The only changes I made were to the salt and pepper in the baste and in the can.  I didn't use any. The rub had plenty. I also used fresh garlic in the can and baste.  Boston chicken has nothing on this recipe.  It took two hours for two chickens on the grill.  Nothing like grilling in new england in the winter when the results are this good.

I used this rub on boneless pork chops, let them sit overnight, and grilled them.  Honestly, after reading all of the reviews I was suprised to find that this rub was only mediocre.  I think a bbq sauce would have been better, but it's different and I had to try it for myself.  Never hurts to try something new.  Thanks.

Great rub. Works great on ribs! I took out the paprika because my husband is a wimp and thinks paprika makes it too spicy. Still wonderful.

This was Great!!!  I took the advise to add a bit of Cayenne pepper...and even though I didn't really have the time for the ribs to marinate in the rub for very long, My family loved it.  They felt that it was a bit too salty so I will probably down the salt to 1 Tablespoon next time, but that may just be our particular taste.  This was our first experience with a rub...and it was one to remember.

This made the refrigerater smell so good when it was marinating and tasted just as good!  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it was so hot - my mouth was on fire.  I think my husband put it on too thick. Next time we'll also use less pepper.

I was skeptical because of how the rub looked and smelled in the bowl, but I marinated the racks overnight and then basted them with brush on sauce while they cooked and they came out great.

Although I like the rub, my husband thought It was a little too sweet for his liking.  All in all this was my first time cooking ribs and the meat was falling off the bone, this was great!
So I had leftovers all to myself is that a bad thing?

This is a great dry rub.  I usually at least double the amount of brown sugar used.

I like this basic rub recipe.  I experiment and change things depending on the job at hand and I am always looking for good "idea" recipes like this one.  Give the kids a treat and let them mix up the ingredients and rub the mixture onto the meat.  They'll get all goopy and really get a kick out of it.  Most kids will always try a taste of whatever they have had a hand in.
