Marcus, who ever you are, this was great! My Boyfriend wants me to make this every time we grill!
The one thing I didn't really think went over well was the coriander seeds. 1+ cups of it is a little unreasonable, especially when looking at the spice rack in the baking isle of the grocery store... for a 3 oz bottle $4? Do the math. I think its a typo for the amount of coriander seeds. I reduced it to a few tablespoon fulls. But over all it tasted great and my parents and the whole family couldnt get enough of the stuff! Its not a quick prep, which reflects my rating of 2 stars, but the 24 hr time to let the spices and the juices soak into the meat gave a fantastic meal!

I was really looking forward to a lovely dinner with my dad at the beach house this past weekend.  I cooked these kebabs and 'Herbed Lamb Chops', also from this site.  The chops were fantastic but these kebabs didn't turn out so well.  First of all the recipe doesn't supply enough information as to what kind of meat it would be best to use.  I'm an Australian and unfortunately we don't have all the same ingredients as you do in America.  Anyway I did the best I could in buying lean lamb steaks, but despite being marinated for about 29 hours, once cooked became tough.  Secondly despite an unusually long amount of boiling the sauce never became a "sticky fluid substance".  It was still very watery and the ground coriander seeds just became lumps of wet spice in the sauce.  I was quite disappointed with the result, my dad said that although they didn't look at all appetizing, the sauce was a mess and the meat was tough they were still good, but I don't know how much I believed him.  I wonder if anyone else has some ideas of how to make this recipe work, because it sounded lovely when I originally read the recipe and I would love to try to make them taste and look as good as they sound.  Thanks for any ideas, Sarah.
