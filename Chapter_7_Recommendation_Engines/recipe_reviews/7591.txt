Delicate and delightful!  I don't keep cake flour in the house, but on the back of my cornstarch box, it gives directions how to make your own cake flour:
For 1 cup cake flour, combine 3/4 cup plus 2 Tbs all purpose flour with 2 Tbs corn starch.  Sift together and use in any recipe calling for cake flour.
I used this substituion in the recipe and it worked wonderfully.  For light texture, remember to cream shortening, butter and sugar, then add eggs one at a time, this process took me at least 5 minutes of mixing with the electric mixer but was well worth it!  
A definite keeper!

Great recipe - only change I made was using part vanilla and part almond. Mine had the dense pound cake quality. I noticed some people had trouble keeping the cake dense and with it overflowing. Remember, a pound cake is a very old style cake - long before electric mixers. The recipe states to stir in the flour and milk, so when using a mixer it must be slow and not for too long. Mixing it fast and for a long time will put too much air in the batter causing it to fluff up and loose the dense pound cake quality and rise too big.

I am a Pastry Chef and I am always looking for wonderful recipes.  This recipe is great, although I did add some things.  Instead of the almond extract(two tsp. seemed like too much to me) I added two TBS. of almond oil, 1/2 tsp. lemon extract and 1 tsp. of vanilla extract.  Instead of just regular shortening, I used butter flavor shortening.  I creamed the butter, shortening and sugar for 20 minutes which gives the cake a fluffy texture.  All of these changes made it great!

It's two days after Christmas and all through the house, not a creature is stirring...except for Hubs and me.  With all our "holiday people" gone I'm left with an empty house and a full refrigerator and pantry, including lots of leftover eggnog. I decided to use some of it in a cake and after looking over this recipe decided it was a good, basic pound cake recipe that I could safely experiment with a little.  Given that I replaced the milk with the sweet eggnog, I knew I'd have to reduce the sugar, but didn't want to reduce it so much that I'd be reducing some of the moisture in the cake as well.  I settled at 2 cups. In keeping with the eggnog flavor  I substituted 1-1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. rum extract for the almond extract, and added 1/8 tsp. nutmeg to the flour mixture.  I wasn't crazy about baking this at 300 degrees, but since I had a dark pan I felt it would be okay. An hour and 15 minutes later the cake was done. This really is a lovely, beautiful cake, moist, with a fine, tender and dense crumb. Pound cake just as pound cake should be. As for my eggnog experiment, it was a real happy result! Pleasantly eggnog flavored, light "mellow yellow" and a perfect choice  for this holiday season.  This was just excellent on its own, but I served it with a fresh, tropical fruit medley and fresh whipped cream (more leftovers!). Make this recipe as is or make my eggnog cake experiment, but either way I highly recommend it!

this is the best cake recipe on this site.. I cut down the sugar to 2 1/4 cups.. I had no cake flour on hand today, so I removed 2T flour per cup, and double sifted the flour... I used only vanilla ex, I don't like almond.. and the result was a moist, delishous, creamy, melt in your mouth cake... I will use this recipe from now on as my signature cake... this is great for weddings and birthdays, it's to to good 100 stars!!!! my husband  refuses to eat store bought pound cake ever again...

This makes a very moist and excellent textured pound cake, but I agree with other reviewers - substitue vanilla for the almond extract. The moistness is due to the 1/2 cup of shortening, but I would have liked a more buttery flavor - just my own personl preference. It did turn out absolutely perfect though.  Thanks!

Since my mother passed away last year, I was afraid that I would never get the chance to learn how to make my own pound cake.  I made this cake today and it turn out just as if mom had done it herself.  Thanks so much! I changed the recipe as suggested by others and used 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond as well as cream cheese instead of shortening.

I'm giving this five stars because it filled up my Bundt pan nicely and the texture was A+, but I strongly recommend cutting the almond extract in half, adding 1-2 teaspoons vanilla extract and also adding 1/2 to 1 tsp. salt.  The sweetness definitely needs to be tempered with the addition of some salt.

This was the best pound cake recipe I've found.  Often pound cakes can come out on the dry side, but this was super moist.  I made it for my some folks at my husband's work, and the container came back empty.  I followed the suggestion in the reviews to use half almond flavoring and half vanilla -- good idea.

I have made this pound cake repeatedly over the last five years.  It's turned out perfect every time, with the most beautiful brown top & sides.  It's dense and rich.  I've even served it as strawberry shortcake for a baby shower!  Everyone always wants the recipe so I always make a few copies to have ready for them!

If anyone is having trouble, make sure that you follow the instructions *exactly*: grease & flour the pan (no spray), beat butter & sugar til light & fluffy (it'll look almost white), and make sure that you are using the freshest ingredients!

Mine always takes longer to cook but that's a non-issue if you understand baking in general.  Check for doneness (just like the recipe says) and adjust cooking time accordingly.  I also put an old cookie sheet on the shelf below the cake to catch any overflow.

Make sure to let the cake cool for *exactly* 10 minutes before turning out our it will stick, as will any other cake.  If you follow these instructions then you'll have an excellent cake!

Hard to imagine how anyone could take exception to this excellent recipe. Super moist, flavorful, with a fine, tender, velvety crumb. It's nice and dense, exactly as a proper pound cake should be. What's not to like?? It's a recipe that can tolerate all manner of changes in flavoring, and turn out consistently like champ. I've made it plain, subbing vanilla for the almond (we don't like in-your-face almond flavor in this house,) and have dressed it up, as well. To do this, I use 1/2 tsp each of coconut, rum, maple, almond, lemon, orange extracts and 1 tsp vanilla. I know this is about double the extract called for in the recipe, but it still works perfectly. I have also used buttermilk in place of the milk in order to use it up, but when I do that, I add 1/4 tsp soda to neutralize the acidity you get from buttermilk.  It's perfect to layer with strawberries and cream, or just to enjoy with a cup of tea. I have used it to make a trifle - just wonderful. Any way you choose to make it or serve it, this recipe will do you proud each and every time. Watch the timing scrupulously, and check with a toothpick or skewer in the center to determine doneness. Overbaking will make this dry. A little watchfulness will be rewarded.

As a pastry chef Instructor, I gather the most rated basic recipes for my student. I make them first before passing them to my students.  This is a very moist cake. Although, my students and I made different versions of this cake. Chocolate was the most flavorful pound cake. Cut the flour to 90% and add cocoa powder plus 2 tsp instant coffee instead. I found it super sweet so I ask them to reduce the sugar to 2/3, add lemon, and lime zest for the plain version and of course we always use butter only. For best result, always use room temp ingredient for cakes and cookies.

Very good, old-fashioned pound cake flavor and texture.  2 tablespoon almond extract was way too overpowering, so I did 1.5 tablespoon vanilla, .5 tablespoon almond.  This was a moist cake, but not SUPER moist like the Cream Cheese Pound Cake I & II from this site.  If you want a definite no fail pound cake, use the recipes just mentioned.  As for this recipe, I used ALL butter and all the ingredients should be ROOM TEMP.  I've also substituted buttermilk for the milk and it was even better.  Make sure you whip the butter and sugar om med. speed for at least 10-15 min. until light and fluffy.  Makes all the difference.  Follow the directions to a T, down to adding one egg at a time, and you'll end up with a winner.  Have made this twice, but will go back to the Cream Cheese lb. cake recipes instead.

I've made this recipe several times  and its the only pound cake recipe I use now. Its even better than my mom's! I always halve the recipe, using all-purpose flour instead of cake flour and  bake it in a 9x5 loaf pan. It has always turned out beautifully for me. I recently made it with a 1/2 cup of blueberries thrown in and have also used peaches.

When I made this cake, I made a lemon glaze to go with it. My husband who is not a person to eat sweets, actually ate a whole slice himself. Usually when I bake cakes etc, he takes them into work with him to share with his fellow co-workers. This time I was told to make sure that I left enough for him to have a slice or two for later. 
Believe me, that is the highest compliment that anyone has ever gotten regarding baked goods of any kind. I really do appreciate you sharing this recipe with us. I will be baking it more often. 
The lemon glaze is as follows:
The juice of 2 lemons.
The zest of 1 lemon finely grated.
1 1/2 cups icing sugar. 
Combine all of the ingredients together and incorporate well. 
When the cake comes out of the oven, poke holes in the cake and with a pastry brush, brush a layer of the glaze over the cake. After 5 minutes brush another layer of the glaze over the cake. Let stand for about 15 minutes. Invert cake onto a serving platter or cake plate. Again, poke holes into the cake and spoon the glaze over the cake. Do this until all of the glaze is used up. Let the cake cool completely. Slice and serve. You won't be disappointed.

I threw a dinner party and served this cake.  I found it to be too almondy and too sweet.  Most my guests preferred the other cake I made (the chocolate cavity cake on this website--), but did not like this one much.  This cake will get eaten eventually, but it is not phenomenal by any means.  Also, it isn't very pound-cake like because the texture is much lighter than the pound cake most of us love.  For all the butter and sugar used. . . this isn't worth the calories!

This is great!  I used cream cheese instead of crisco.  I also used 2 casserole dishes and made 2 sheet cakes rather than a 1 bundt cake.  My husband who usually doesn't like pound cake LOVES this and my boys are devouring it right now.  I am excited to add strawberries and whipped cream.  YUMMY!

I have tried so many pound cake recipes on here, from sour cream to cream cheese and back again. I should've know that the simplest would be the best. This came out so moist, yet not too dense nor fluffy. Perfect, perfect cake. I gave mine a powdered sugar drizzle glaze.

Nearly 5,000 people can't be wrong! I used light cream cheese instead of shortening, Splenda for the sugar, and lemon extract instead of almond. I made some lemon curd (also with Splenda)to dollop onto this cake. I have to say, my friends think I am some kind of closet cake genius! See, we all work at a restaurant and I am a server, so you can imagine how thrilled I was when the cooks asked me for "my" recipe!! Wee! They were especially happy to find out that the calories were significantly reduced due to light cream cheese and splenda; we couldn't tell by the taste or texture! Will be keeping this one and it will be a the girl's night standard.

Used all butter instead of the shortening.  Decided to stick to the almond extract since it was what made the recipe different. Received raved reviews.  The cake turned out awesome.  Keep in mind that CAKE FLOUR is not the same as ALL PURPOSE FLOUR.

This was my first poundcake that I have ever made and it turned out wonderfully.  Because my fiance loved chocolate, I added 2 cups of nestle mini morsels to the poundcake and used only 2 cups of sugar and subsituted the almond extract for 3 tsp of vanilla.  The cake turned out great!  However, the next time, I will leave out the chocolate chips because this pound cake is flavorful on its own.  The addition of the chocolate precluded me from serving it with strawberries.  Thanks for the great recipe.  This one will definitely be in my keeper box.

FINALLY! A pound cake recipe that is moist and firm.  I have tried many pound cake recipes and have not been pleased.  I will use this recipe anytime my husband requests a pound cake.  I said this cake put Sara Lee to shame.  The rest of the family LOVED IT also.

Definitely a keeper,
Bakermom

Oh, this is FOR SURE my new go-to pound cake recipe! I've been using two recipes regularly - one which uses cream cheese, and one which uses whipping cream (both also from this site) but wanted a recipe that didn't require the extra ingredients. This is exactly what I was looking for - a little lighter, but still dense and moist. I used all butter instead of using shortening, and, per other reviewers, swapped out the almond for vanilla extract, and added a bit of salt. [After perousing other reviews, I have to add: If you're getting a batter that is at all "runny," you are doing something wrong. The batter should be extremely thick and should resemble whipped cream. Overly-soft butter will yield a softer batter and a flattened cake, as will incorrectly-measured flour and/or a butter/sugar mixture that hasn't been creamed long enough - I gave it 10 solid minutes on high speed in my stand mixer, scraping the bowl occasionally.]

This was ABSOLUTELY the best recipe for pound cake by far!  I did modify the ingredients, using only 1 tps. of almond extract, 2 tsp. of vanilla, and 1 tsp. of lemon extract.  The cake came right out of the pan with ease.  I used the Baker's Joy spray with the oil and flour combined.  The finished product was golden brown and delicious.  I will continue to use this recipe forever.  THANKS SO MUCH!

This cake is moist with a fine-grained smooth texture, but not as dense as most pound cakes.  The almond extract gives it a wonderful flavor.  A great recipe!

Jean, thanks so much for this recipe!  I did not change a thing in the ingredients.  I followed the directions, making sure it was 'light and fluffy.'  It is so delicious and moist!  The texture is just perfect and my family and friends devour it each time I make it.  I also give it as gifts!  Thanks again!

The cake tasted great and had a fabulous texture. It, however, ran over the edges of the bunt pan and all over the oven. I would split it into two pans if I were to make it again.

This was too sweet for me,even aft i decrease the amount of sugar.Also,i'll recommend cutting down the amount of almond extract,i used 1 tsp vanilla & 1 tsp almond,and yet the almond taste was still TOO strong.Nonetheless,it has a gd texture,fluffy yet firm.Esp gd aft a day in the fridge.

Unbelieveably overated... unless you like your cake sweet enough to cause instant diabetes.
I sure won't trust the reviews anymore.
I was looking for a dense and not overly sweet pound cake suitable for snacking on. This recipe sure wasn't what I was looking for.
All I can say is "yuck!"

This pound cake was awesome.  After reading some reviews, I decided to put 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of lemon instead of 2 teaspoons of almond and I only used 2 cups of sugar. I also added some lemon zest to the batter and finished it off with lemon flavored icing.  Everyone LOVED it!!

Great pound cake!  It was my first attempt at pound cake ever and everybody raved how moist it was. Definetly glad I followed others suggestions to use 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond. It freezes wonderfully too. I will be making this one again!

This was an outstanding poundcake the only thing I suggest is to cut the sugar to 2 cups.It's delicious and very moist. Great with the zest of two lemons added as well.I will make this again and again.

I have made this cake several times, all different ways. And all of them have been amazing. The first time, I made it by the directions. Then I decided to make it a bundt cake. That is what I will do from now on. I like to add coconut extract in the batter and make then make a chocolate glaze with melted semi sweet chocolate and condensed milk. Finally topped with chopped walnuts and shredded coconut

Made exactly as stated (except I used regular flour).  I'm glad I didn't read the reviews first or it would have made me make changes to the recipe or think I needed to do something fancy with the mixing.  I didn't even mix eggs in one at a time (I forgot).  It was dense like pound cake should be.  I love its' almond flavor but would change to vanilla if using for strawberry shortcake.  Amazing!

The texture of this cake is a definite 5 stars; however, the shortening is really difficult to cut through to actually get some flavor into the cake.  The fact that the sugar amount was cut from the traditional pound cake recipe that I use in my family, which is an equal measure of sugar and flour (thus you'd need an extra 1/2c of sugar here, if not more to account for the shortening), caused the flavor to take a real hit.  I strongly suggest using 3 cups of flour.  I'd also do two tsp of vanilla and 1/4-1/2 tsp of almond with 1/4-1/2 tsp lemon.  Also, I'd definitely go with the other reviewer's suggestion to use butter-flavored shortening.  Maybe a tsp of fresh lemon or some zest in lieu of lemon extract would cut through the shortening taste nicely as well.

I just can't emphasize the gap between the excellent texture and the less than stellar flavor in this cake.  I actually did sour cream as a sub for milk, since I was out of milk, and that worked very well.  

Something a bit off-putting is that this cake comes out pretty white.  Don't look for a browned top.  Just wait for a springy top.

As written, this is a pretty good recipe. I read over some reviews and made some changes to suit my own tastes. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 of a cup, added 1/2 tsp salt to my flour and baking powder, split the two teaspoons of almond extract between half almond extract and half vanilla extract. I waited for everything to come up to room temperature, beat the bejesus out of my wet ingredients, but then folded in my dry ingredients/milk with a spoon until smooth. It took almost the full hour and a half to cook, but the end result was a dense, professional-grade pound cake. I drizzled a bit of powdered sugar-orange flavored icing over the top of it. For Christmas, I served it with homemade cranberry sauce and homemade whipped cream to detract from the heaviness of the cake. Very good, will definitely bake again! Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  My aunt found this one and made it.  She normally doesn't bake, but this was a home run for her.  Everyone loved it.  Now I've adopted this recipe for my own family.  I made two adaptations: used all butter and vanilla extract, and added a pinch of salt.

EDIT: I've made this cake twice now and I know why some people's cakes are rising too much or are coming out spongelike and porous: DON'T OVER MIX!!!!!!! I was trying to get the cake slightly less dense my second time so I brought the eggs, shortening, and butter to room temperature and mixed all the ingredients   longer and more vigorously than I had the first time and the cake came out very spongy and almost dry. This is a great recipe. The first time I made this cake it was wonderful. Any less than satisfactory products are the result of improper execution.

This was my first try at pound cake. I used just 2 cups of sugar, buttermilk, and vanilla extract rather than almond extract (as was suggested by other reviewers), then I mixed half the batter with chocolate pudding mix and added chocoate chips.

My result had the classic, dense pound cake consistency and it looked and tasted absolutely lovely.

This is by far the best pound cake I've ever had. I have always made it in a large pound cake pan (tall, straight sides)...NOT a bundt pan. Also, I do not like almond flavoring, so I use a combination of butter flavoring and vanilla extract. By following the rest of the directions exactly, I've never had this cake fail me, and I've made it probably two dozen times, and folks who eat it have asked me if I bake professionally when they try it. The secret is the flavoring and the cake flour.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and the flavor was horrible and the cake spilled all over my oven. The only thing that was right was the timing. I will definitely not make this again. Back to the trying to find a good pound cake.

This is a phenomenal cake!  I've been making it for years, but never reviewed it.  My husband who doesn't have a sweet tooth will attack this cake when I make it.  It is a sweet, moist almond cake that is right along the lines of most homemade pound cakes.  My only "wish" is that the rest of the came came out with the crust that the top part gets- I could eat that (and gain 100 lbs!) all day!  Yes, I have substituted other flavors such as vanilla (added a little extra) and rum.  Always a great cake- Don't over bake!

I substituted vanilla extract for the almond extract and used 4 5-inch bundt pans. I also didn't use shortening because I didn't have any, so I just made up for it with butter. Creamed the butter and sugar with a mixer, added the eggs, milk and dry ingredients as directed but instead of stirring by hand, I just used the mixer since it was there already. The result was a very light and fluffy batter that I divided into the 4 small pans. Baked it for 45 mins and WOW! The cake was nice and fluffy and developed a crust on top that was crunchy, sweet, and delicious. It got denser when I chilled it, but that just made it better. I love this cold or warm with coffee. My mom and dad are stealing a small cake each to share with their co-workers. I'm definitely going to make it again and maybe make it with a variety of fruit glazes next time or maybe even drizzle some expresso on top. Thanks Ms. Higginbotham!

This recipe was okay. It was a bit dry though and instead of almond extract I used vanilla. Added some buttercream icing. My fiance enjoyed the icing the best. I need a pound cake that has more moisture.

Great recipe, easy to make, great results.  I took others suggestions and cut back on the sugar, I used pure vanilla extract, and I added mini chocolate chips, about 1 1/2 cups (tossed in 1/4 cup extra flour)this turned out great.  I drizzled the top with a chocolate glaze in a swirl pattern and it looked very pretty.  I am going to make this again today, only I will be making mini bunt cakes for gifts.

Excellent! A tad on the sweet side, maybe a 1/4 cup less sugar and a little more butter. However, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this recipe as it is. I like a versatile recipe anyway, its easier to fit different tastes.

This cake turned out AWESOME.  I used butter flavored crisco and used the electric mixer to cream butter and sugar, but I mixed the rest by hand, so not to add too much air to the batter.  I used vanilla instead of almond and used a spongcake pan so no overflow.  Some reviews said it was too light and spongecake like, but mine was not, it was perfect, very heavy, was not too sweet, was perfect. I used large eggs instead of extra large (didnt want it too fluffy), and I used cake flour.  I made 2 and glazed one with milk and powdered sugar, they were both incredible, I even rotated flour and milk, beginning with flour and ending with flour.  Can't say enough about this recipe, I will use it forever now! Thank you!!!

My cake turned out very greasy, and the top was burnt to a crisp.  The taste was very mediocre and bland, and this recipe is definitely not a 5-star recipe.

This is an incredible recipe!!! It is easy and when I make it, everyone that tastes it loves it and raves over it. I also use all-purpose flour instead of cake flour with no problem. I used this recipe and melted 4 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate and made it a swirl puond cake and it was pretty good as well. But, this cake made just as the recipe says is wonderful.

This was wonderful - I actually used vanilla extract instead of almond, just because I am not that fond of almond - and I have to admit, I glanced at the recipe too fast and ended up using regular flour instead of cake flour - but it still ended up wonderfully!

I really liked this cake--especially the almond flavor.  And it was so easy!  I will definitely make this again--I keep thinking of it with fresh summer peaches and cream.  My other pound cake recipe was so fussy--this one is easy and fast.  Very good!

I didn't like anything about this recipe.  It was very greasy and the almond flavor way too strong.  I will not try it again.

Awesome! I just made this cake today and I can't stop eating it! I did make some minor changes to suit my taste. I subbed 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of coconut extract for the 2 tsp of almond extract and I also used butter flavored shortening instead of plain. I baked mine for 1hr 15min and it was perfectly moist and delicious. I have tried other pound cake recipes but this is the one I will be using from now on.

This recipes was too moist, and way to sweet to eat. I followed the directions exactly and I knew the batter looked too runny but made it the way the directions said anyway and it came out like I thought it would. On with the search for a perfect pound cake!

Dee-lish!  I'm an American living in England and I made this tonite for my church homegroup.  These crazy English people had never heard of pound cake!  I think they were a bit taken aback by how rich and heavy it is.  Personally I thought this was FANtastic.  First pound cake I'd ever made.  I didn't have cake flour and didn't want to bother trying to make my own so used regular - it worked fine!  I did the 1/2 almond 1/2 vanilla.  You could def still taste the almond which was yummy.  I used 2 loaf pans with one batch.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

My 11 year old son made it by himself except for the part where he needed to alternate ingredients, which he did not understand on his own, but then got it quickly. Came out really good, and everyone loved it and could not believe that he had made it all on his own and from scratch!

Best Pound Cake I've ever eaten!  I did use 1 teaspoon of Almond Extract and 1 teaspoon of Vanilla Extract but otherwise I made it exactly as written.   Loved it -- can't stop eating it.  Probably going to gain 10 pounds myself, lol!

WOW great taste and old fashion feel. I used only 2 cups of sugar: one white and one brown; cake flour not all purpose; butter flavored Crisco; one tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond essence; must add almost a tsp of salt. I baked it on Sat. By Sun it was almost finished. By Mon. one slice left. I MUST do this again!

I followed the recipe exactly.  THis cake is VERY sweet so if you dont want it to be so sweet I would cut back on the almond extract...also I would not reccomend using the electric mixer.  I think my problem was i mixed it too much because the cake didnt have that dense pound cake like feel.  It was more fluffy like regular cake, which is not what i wanted but still tasted great.

One of the best recipes on this site.  I bought an expensive bundt pan that was larger than the average. I bought it just for this recipe because I love it so much.  It is a dense rich cake, perfect crust, cooks very even.  I like it sliced and warmed up in the microwave for just about 20 seconds.  So perfect with coffee.

Great recipe - easy to make. I recommend using all almond extract, as the recipe suggests. It really gives it great flavor! If you're hesitant, just give it a shot! It was a big hit with the coworkers...served with fresh whipped cream and berries.

This is wonderful!  This pound cake was heavy, moist and dense yet it was a cinch to make.  I did alter it a little based on other reviews.  I used 1 tsp of almond extract and 1 tbs of vanilla.  I didn't have any cake flour on hand so I followed the advice of others and used: 3/4 c + 2 tbs. flour and 2 tbs. of cornstarch to make 1c of cake flour.  Thanks for this recipe, I made it twice the first week due to demand!

Definitely better result than a recipe I tried from "The Joy of Cooking".  I read some reviews complaining that the cake pan overflowed.  "Bundt" is a trademark of a company that makes pans of differing capacities. I have a 10 inch diameter, fluted Bundt pan which I measured at 14 cups capacity.  I used the larger capacity pan, which this recipe filled perfectly.  I baked it for an hour and a half, and it finished about 1/4 inch below the outside rim and even with the inside rim.  I think a few minutes more baking or a slightly higher temperature may have helped, but the cake passed the toothpick test.  It was dense, but perhaps appropriate or ideal for pound cake. I understand that cakes can rise higher at high altitude elevations, so pan overflow with this recipe may be more likely if you are located at a high elevation.  My home is only 300 feet above sea level.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used vanilla extract for flavor. My husband and kids were crazy about it! I am making it again today but will try lemon extract at their request. I am wondering if those who had a hard time with the batter spilling over didn't use cake flour? That could have been the problem. Thanks for sharing this recipe ---it's a keeper!!!

If I'm gonna eat pound cake, I like it to be heavy and moist.  This was too light in consistency for my taste.  The almond flavor was a bit overbearing too, but it wasn't bad by any means.  I'll probably stick with "The Best Pound Cake" (submitted by Rhonda).

This cake won't disappoint! While someone else on this forum referred to it as "moist and light", I found it to be "moist and dense" (just the way I like it).  Next time though, I will decrease the Almond Extract by a 1/2 tsp and increase the baking temperature from 300 degrees to about 325.  At 300, it took an hour and fifty minutes in my oven.  I will be making seven more cakes to gift to neighbors for Christmas!

This is a very good pound cake. I was making it for a friend's mother's wake, but I didn't have a tube pan so I made loaves. Let me tell you everyone loved them and the one that I left at home lasted 1 and 1/2 days. I did change the recipe some by using lemon extract 2 teaspoons and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I also used regular flour I just sifted it 3 times

Personally, I'd give this recipe 4 stars, but I had two people tell me that this was the best pound cake they've ever had and I thought that should count for something.  I’m not a fan of pound cake, then again I’ve never had homemade until now and I was pretty impressed with this recipe.  For the record, I did not sift my cake flour, used plain shortening, and I used a Kitchen Aid Mixer.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception that I used 1t of vanilla and 1t of butter extract rather than the almond.  The result was very dense, moist, flavorful, and buttery cake.  I used Baker’s Joy to coat the pan and did not have a problem with sticking.  It took 1 hour 20 minutes to bake.   In retrospect, I’d omit ½ cup of sugar as I found this a little sweet for my taste (no one else complained of this) and I’d probably up the temperature and cook it for less time. Unfortunately, I didn’t get a well formed golden ‘crust’ as others have, but perhaps changing the temperature and cooking time would fix that.  I served this with fresh strawberries and homemade whipped cream.  It was wonderful.

Unbelievable recipe- I can't make enough of it! I sometimes make it with 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of almond.

Excellent! It took a little longer than expected to cream the butter, shortening and sugar together; will be sure to work with room temp butter next time.  The almond flavor was a little strong; but a great cup of tea cuts the almond quite nicely.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow! This is one of the very best recipes I've tried, on any website; moist, densely crumbed, and freezes beautifully.  The only changes I made to the receipe were to exclude the Almond extract (not my favorite) and replace it with 1 tsp Vanilla and 1 tsp. Lemon extract.  Oh, and I added about a 1/2 cup Sour cream to the batter... it just seems to make baked goods extra tender and moist.  I used a cookie sheet lined with greased parchment and spread the batter on that; needed very little time in the oven.  I was then able to slice it into 3 rectangular sections, which froze beautifully.  Layered the defrosted layers with raspberries and cream... holy smokes!  I will pass this recipe on to my two girls; it's in my 'keeper' file!

This cake had a very good flavor, I however did not use almond extract, do not like the taste of it and I've never had a pound cake with that in it so I don't think they go together. I used Lemon Extract and Vanilla Extract and it had a wonderful taste. However I do not consider this a pound cake, too me it is more like a sponge cake, pound cake to me is heavy and dense, this was not so I won't make it again just because it was not the recipe I was looking for.

This was my first attempt at making a pound cake,  and if turned out wonderful.  I did use vanilla rather than almond extract,  and also used bread pans in place of the bundt pan.  Altogether fantastic.

Wonderful.  This was my first attempt at a pound cake and it came out very well.  I did not use the almond extract though, just vanilla.  Took it to an office party and it was the first thing to go.

I used 1/4 tsp orange extract & the rest vanilla. This was very tasty, but mine came out more like sponge cake then pound cake - I was looking for something a lot more dense & less "fluffy". It's good just the same though!

This cake was sooooooo good. I cut the recipe in half and it came out perfect size. It did not overflow the pan. the full recipe is way to much cake for one pan. This will make it hard to bake and hard to get out of the pan. I used all vanilla extract. My kids loved it so much they could not stop talking about how soft it was. It was very moist like birthday cake. It had that great homemade taste.

This cake was far too sweet for my liking.  Texture is great though, so maybe just need to cut down on the sugar?
And the almond taste was very overpowering.
With a few adjustments, I'm sure it would be a wonderful cake.

I didn't read any reviews before baking this cake and it was my first pound cake.  I put all of the mix into the bundt pan and it overflowed but when I removed it from the pan and turned it over, it was perfect.  I also used self-rising flour instead of the cake flour and baking soda. (this is all I had)  The cake is wonderful.  I will make it again.

I substituted one teaspoon of vanilla extract for almond extract.  This cake was so good that I wouldn't have believed I made it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes!  I liked the flavor of the cake.  The texture was almost perfect.  I used an angel food cake pan because more than one of the reviews indicated the batter overflowed in certain bundt cake pans.  Using the angel food cake pan, the batter rose almost to the top of the pan, but I did not experience any overflow.  My husband (Chef Mike) doesn't eat a lot of sweets, but he ate most of this cake.  I topped the cake with a light lemon glaze.  Wow!  Thank you, Aunt Johnnie.

Unfortunately I used the wrong flour-- I used regular flour which I didn't realize was incorrect until it was too late.  The cake turned out dry and a little rubbery.  The taste was good though, and I will try it again with cake flour.  I also split the extracts between vanilla and almond.

I made this pound cake and substituted the almond extract for vanilla. I also added 1 cup of chopped cherries (that had been tossed in flour). Although it took a long time to cook (1.5 hours) it was very good. My husband almost devoured the whole cake!!! I will make this cake again!
Thanks for the great recipe!!!

The best pound cake I have ever made.  I read some of the previous comments about how to make it better.  The one I used was about taking a lot of time to make sure the sugar and butter is fluffy.  I also used half vanilla and half almond extract.  Such a lovely cake.

EXCELLENT recipe- my first try at pound cake. I substituted the almond extract for vanilla & a teaspoon of orange extract. I might try to omit the shortening next time & replace with butter.... other than that- a dense & moist cake which I was proud to serve to my family with strawberries & ice cream.

Needed a pound cake quick for a birthday.  Baked this one. Used some of the variations.  2 cups of sugar.  The cake flour info from one.  Plus I like alot of vanilla, so I used 1 1/2 Tbs.  Left out the almond extract.  Topped it w/ a sugar glaze.  Sugar glaze was to make it look pretty.  I had to bake a second cake, my family ate the first one before I could deliver.  The cake was a hit.

I have made this pound cake more times than I can count. It's amazing with strawberries, or served with a butter/brown sugar sauce with bananas. So moist! I use a bundt pan usually, but works well split into two loaf pans.

I used all butter, and vanilla not almond extract. Everyone thought it was a perfect cake :) Beautifully moist, dense, melt-in-your-mouth and crusty.

Delicious!  I used 1 t. vanilla, 1 t. almond extract.  I baked them in (2) 8"x4" loaf pans at 300F for 65 minutes.  I added foil in the last 15 minutes, after the edges started browning.  Unfortunately, the crust never browned up the way I wanted.  But it tasted so good!  Served with "Simple Strawberry Sauce" and whipped cream.  Thanks Jean!

I followed the recipe exactly except for trading in the almond extract for vanilla.  It was TOO sweet, oily and bland.  I will not be making this again.

SOOOOOOO YUMMY!!!  I wanted to make some pound cake to serve with strawberry and whip cream, but this cake tastes so good by itself.  It turned out sweeter than I thought but still EXCELLENT! I used half almond extract and half vanilla extract.  I also used softened butter to make the creaming easier.

Very delicious recipe, not dry and not heavy like some pound cake recipes can be.  I used this recipe in a Wilton Lamb mold and it came out perfectly. i also added chocolate chips to this recipe, they all sank to the bottom but made a delicious chocolate layer at the bottom... highly recommed!! :)

LOVE this cake. I made half the amount, used all butter, used one vanilla bean instead of almond extract, skimmed milk and plain flour. Creamed the butter and sugar with a hand mixer til smooth and pale, add eggs one at a time, then the vanilla bean. Then I stir in the flour mix alternately with milk by hand. Making sure it is well incorporated by each addition. Takes a little effort but SO worthwhile. Sprayed my cake tin w olive oil spray, baked the cake for an hour. LOVELY. It has a thin crust on top, and such dense, moist cake. Was a bit cautious in the beginning with the recipe after reading the reviews hence I made only half the recipe. Next time I'll make it marbled. YUM!

Wow.. this came out AMAZING! I was a little scared at first after reading some reviews... but wow. I did mostly everything like the recipe says, I did omit the almond extract and replaced with vanilla. I also added 2 tsp of Lemon extract.. and I think that is what made this SO wonderful. I'm not sure why people said there was "too much" batter, but this was the perfect size, and I did use a bundt pan. Make sure you use CAKE flour!! I think that is where some went wrong and got too much. This is definitely going into my recipe box, I'll never again have to search for another pound cake recipe!!

It was good but not fabulous. I was so excited to try it, thinking oh wow a dense rich pound cake. (The way I like it). It wasn't dense and a little dry to tell you the truth. i will keep checking some others out. I should have known when I saw shortening as an ingredient. A pound cake should always be made with butter!!! Sorry I tried.

I followed the directions exactly with the exception of substituting vanilla for the flavoring instead of almond. 
I thought it was fantastic. It was a big cake and baked to the very top of the pan(I dont have a bundt pan, and used an angel foodcake pan) I used the full 1.5hours.
The cake is very dense and buttery tasting. I served the cake toasted with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.

Great recipe

The texture was fantastic. Lighter than a regular pound cake and moist.

I used only vanilla extract.  I added brown sugar on top.

No problem with over flowing because I used 2 loaf pans instead of the bundt pan.

This recipe is highly recommended!

This recipe was quite easy to make.  Cake turned out moist.  I served this with fresh strawberries and whipped cream for dessert.  The almond flavour and strawberries went together very well.  The second time I made this cake, I added lemon juice and grated rind instead of the almond extract just for a different flavour.

This was so-so. the cake definitely stck to the pan even though I folllowed directions to a "t". I covered up the top with fresh fruit and lemon sauce. the flavor was ok but nothing wonderful. I prefer the heavier, denser, and moister pound cakes. And it fell apart easily so it was hard to get it on the fork. the flavor was good but I don't see 5 stars on this one.

The first time I made it, the taste was excellent.  The pan I used overflowed, so in the future, I will take part of it off and put it in another pan.  The second and third times that I made this cake, the middle did not get done in the amount of time listed.  I'm not sure how I did it right once and wrong twice ... go figure ... excellent flavor and texture (when it is completely done).

This recipe is great!  What I liked best was that it was moist & fluffy, not too heavy.  I baked if for 1 hour 10 minutes & once I turned it over on the rack to cool it was a perfect golden color.  Aunt Johnnie hit the mark with this one!

I am rating this recipe again, because I didn't care for it and previously gave it a poor review.  However, I gave half to my mother who took it to bible study to share and half to my grandmother and both called me back with so many great reviews of the cake.  I think I like yellow pound cake.  This isn't like that.  But like I mentioned before it got RAVE reviews....so I guess all I can say is try it!

This was a great cake.  I needed to make a pound cake, as I was making a Fish Tank cake, one that could stand on it's own.  I was making a cake for 8 children between 1 and 7 1/2 - a very difficult task.  Two of the children are autistic and have sensory issues, and two children are 2 year olds (who hate everything sometimes).  Not only did the cake stand up well (literally), ALL the 8 children loved it:)

This recipe is absolutely perfect. I first tried it three years ago, and now my husband requests it for his birthday every year and any other time I think of baking a cake.  
I didn't change a thing and probably never will. Thanks for sharing.

I was disappointed with this pound cake because I usually get great results using the 5 star recipes. The texture was great but it seemed to lack that buttery taste and didn't have that yellow color I was hoping for. Overall, I think the cake was a bit bland. I've added fresh strawberries and whipped cream but I am still disappointed.

I used this recipe to make my sister-in-law's wedding cake.  It was dense enough to support the upper tiers of the cake, and it was delicious as well.  The almond flavoring packs a lot of flavor.  I will definitely be using this recipe again in future cakes.

Just made this pound cake tonight with a few minor changes-Used butter flavor shortening and had no almond extract so I used vanilla instead. The cake turned out beautifully-I was really hesitant to cut into it since it was the nicest bundt cake I ever made. My daughter really liked it and it was really moist and light but in my opinion it lacked "something". Perhaps next time I will add some fruits or nuts. Overall, a very good recipe and a great pound cake base to experiment with add-ons...

Instead of a bundt pan, I used a 12x3 inch round pan.  It turned out very dense and a tad on the dry side.  Any suggestions on how to tweak the recipe for a 12 inch round pan?  Thanks!

This is a truly wonderful pound cake--moist, tender with perfect texture and delicious flavor.  I used half to make the Berry Trifle from this site and froze the other half.  This will be my main pound cake recipe from now on. Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

The best first cake I ever made.  The cake was very moist and tasty.  The only change I made was to use butter flavor shortening.  I made this for Thanksgiving and again for Christmas.  Everyone that tried it wants to know when I will make it again.  Thank you

This pound cake is excellent!! I have tried others, but this is my favorite.  Makes a super-dense cake with great flavor (I used 1 tsp. almond, 1/2 tsp. butter flavoring, and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.)  I also used Butter Flavored Crisco for the shortening.  I will definitely make this again (and again, and again...)

I love this recipe, its a hit every time I make it. I recommend using Pam Baking Spray with flour to spray your bundt pan with before adding the batter it works very, very well.

Fabulous pound cake. I substituted 1 tsp lemon and 1 tsp vanilla flavors, because I do not like almond. People raved about it. I was served with just powdered sugar on top. I gave it as a gift for Christmas and the recipients said it was gone too fast. Thanks for Aunt Johnie. Does she have any more recipies?

This was my first attempt at baking a pound cake. It was heavenly as is!! It was dense...very much like the pound cakes we used to buy from the bread store as a kid. I used a bundt pan, and I put some pound cake icing on mine (tbls orange juice, milk, and conf. sugar).  It was delicious! Next time I'll try to put whipped cream and strawberries on it.

Delicious & very moist 
I used a combination of vanilla & coconut extract for flavoring.  Drizzle the top with a coconut glaze and toasted coconut.

Wonderful pound cake, and easy to make!  I served it with whipped cream and strawberries as was suggested, and it was delicious!  This was my first attempt at pound cake and it came out perfect.  I used an electric hand mixer at medium speed.  To blend in the flour and milk, I stirred by hand.  The texture was just right....not too dense and not too light.  As suggested by some reviewers, I used 1 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Next time I'll try all almond for comparison. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

I have a new favorite cake recipe! I cant believe how delicious and easy this cake is. I have always bought my pound cake at a local bakery for my yearly "flag" cake. I just never thought I could bake a pound cake from scratch that taste nearly as good as the bakery nevermind BETTER. This cake is just so moist! My family devoured my trial cake in record time. Thank you for offering this recipe! I now know that my "flag" cake on the 4th will be a huge hit!

This is the pound cake recipe I've been searching for!!  The flavor is light and delicious, and the texture (well, with all those eggs and shortening!) is perfect. I had a little trouble getting it out of my Bundt pan, but I won't be discouraged from trying again. A good friend, who is a fabulous cook, asked me for this recipe - a high compliment!

Loved this recipe, but tweaked it a bit.  Used evaporated milk, used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp lemon extract and 1 tsp lemon zest.  I also beat the butter, shortening and egg mixture on high speed for 5 minutes (before adding the flour and milk). This was a very moist and light pound cake.

This was a pretty good recipe. I read the other reviews and used vanilla instead of almond, cut the sugar back to 1 3/4 cup and added a teaspoon of lemon juice. Next time, I'll add 2 tsp. lemon - it definitely adds to the cake. Also, it took 2 hours to bake - this is not a last minute cake! I would have preferred more of a butter taste (maybe butter flavored shortening?) but it was very good nonetheless, especially the next day. Overall, a great recipe that I'll try again with blueberries, chocolate chips, raspberries, etc.

This was a wonderful cake!  I never keep cake flour on hand but bake from scratch all the time and always use regular all purpose flour with no problem.  I don't even try to use a conversion chart, I just use the same measurements as you would use cake flour.  I also followed the suggestions and skipped the almond extract.  My husband who doesn't usually care for pound cake loved it.  He especially likes it over a scoop of ice cream.  After making another Bundt-Pound cake yesterday that called for Almond extract that turned out wonderfully, I think next time I'll add a touch of it.  Great recipe that I've added to my box...

I made this for a second time and have dropped my rating from a 4 (from my original version) to a 2.  This time I made according to the recipe as I had all 5 eggs.  Only substitute was buttermilk instead of milk.  It turned out very dry.  Don't know what I did wrong except maybe over beat the batter.  I beat the sugar and shortening/butter till fluffy as stated and alternated between buttermilk and dry ingredients.  Used a bundt pan (which it almost ran over again).  I wouldn't think with this much butter and all those eggs it would've turned out dry.  Did not over bake (I don't think) as I took it out 7 minutes before calculated time.  1st review, Good recipe, though I had to modify it a bit.  I only had 4 eggs. I went to allrecipes substitution site and noticed I could substitute 1/2 banana and an extra 1/2 tsp. baking pwd. for an egg so that's what I did.  I had a banana in the freezer waiting for banana bread.  I also had to make a substitute for the Almond flavoring because I didn't have enough so I used 2 tsp. Amaretto and 1 tsp. Vanilla.  I'm sure it would have been just as good if I were able to follow the recipe to a "T" but I really liked the way it turned out.  It did run over my bundt pan (but not too bad) and I think I will try my angle food cake pan next time as it is deeper.  It took 2 hours to bake.  It has a wonderful texture and only the part that ran over the sides was crunchy.  Thanks for sharing...will make again.  Not after second time.

Great taste and texture! Only problem was, I didn't read the reviews prior to trying out this recipe. And my oven was a Mess! I would half this recipe the next time and maybe put less of the almond essence. It was even better the next day after refrigeration - I'd make it again! Thanks for sharing Jean!! ^_^

Good one. Kinda crusty outside, smooth inside. Very flavourfull and satisfying... Even my sister, who only likes chocolate cakes, ate this one. Maybe too much almond or lemon extract (I guess taste depends on the brand).

Maybe 3 1/2 stars.  The texture was okay, but the flavor was very bland.  I have made this cake twice, adding more flavorings the second time and it still didn't taste very good.  It's okay if you're planning to top with fruit, or ice cream to add flavor.

The cake came out very light and fluffy. A very good texture and flavor. It was very popular with the adults as well as the kids. It went very well with    
Fudgy Chocolate Fondue.

This is a wonderful company dessert.  It freezes well if you need to make it ahead of time. I made a little lightly flavored almond glaze to put on top and then topped it with cool whip and Comstock cherries as I served it.  GREAT RECIPE!

I followed the advise of several other reviewers and used two cups of sugar instead of three and 1/2 almond extract and 1/2 vanilla.  Was a bit bland - seemed to be missing something - though the texture was nice and dense.

this first time i made this (last week) i forgot the butter and it still came out great!  but this week i followed the directions to the T and the pound cake seemed dry/crumbly.  but it made 3 small loaf tins and i am freezing the remaining 2 loafs for later consumption.

This is a wonderful pound cake recipe.  The cake is moist, has a wonderful crumb, and is firm and easy to cut.  I used half almond and half vanilla extract as a few other reviewers recommended.  It's so GOOD!  It's also the perfect recipe for "tweeking"- lemon zest, different extracts, less sugar, etc.  TRY IT!

This is a superb pound cake.  It does take some extra work to make it fluffy but the flavor is excellent and it is moist.  It also stores quite well if you happen to have any leftover.

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe!  You do have to use a "prof." bundt pan, though, not the aluminum kind with a white interior. Difference?  The sides of the pro pan are higher.  It does take a lot of beating to incorporate the air because of the high amount of flour.  I subbed neufatchel (a type of cream cheese) for the shortening and used light butter to get the calories down.  Mine was moist, tasty and easy on the eyes!

This is absolutely the best pound cake I have ever made! Thank you Aunt Johnnie. It rises really high but if you use a professional bundt pan there shouldn't be a problem. I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp lemon and glazed it with a lemon flavored glaze. Everyone at my husband's work ate it up! It didn't last long. Delicious--very moist and smooth texture. Hardly any crumbs.

This was the best pound cake I have ever tasted.  Reminds me of the Sara Lee poundcakes we used to have as kids. The cake spilled over really bad the first time so I used an angelfood cake pan and that solved the problem.

I scaled this recipe up to 18 servings and baked it in a pyrex casserole dish for my daughters 1st birthday cake (ladybird).  Although it took over 3 hours to bake it was well worth it.  Very light and moist.  I found the almond essence quite overpowering though and would scale back a bit.  Alernatively I'm going to try it with vanilla tonight.

This cake is a winner.  Everyone loves this cake.  My cake rises a little over the top but for some people that is there favorite piece.  The only thing that I do different is put a lemon glaze on top and use 2 teaspoons lemon, 1 vanilla.  It is perfect.  Thanks Aunt Johnnie.

My husband and I love the taste of this, but I am having difficulty with cooking it accurately. I have made it three times and each time there is an issue.  Obviously it is something I am cooking it.  The first time I cooked in two bread pans, the second time a bunt, and repeated that again on the same day.  I let it cook 20 minutes, the bunt was still hot, and maybe that is why the top pulls away.  I was sending this to a super bowl party and am embarrased.

I got someone’s recommendation of making my own cake flour by mixing flour and corn starch. This recipe was delicious, except that I think I will rather add less almond extract because it was too strong for me. Other than that my family and I really liked the recipe, definitely baking it again!

I'm teaching my 16 year old son how to cook and bake. Yesterday he made this pound cake. The recipe is easy to follow and the end result was a wonderful cake for dessert. We topped it with some sliced peaches in a light syrup (canned this last summer). What a wonderful memory we made!

The timeline of 1 to 1 1/2 hours to cook this cake is a bit non-committal, unless a person wants to keep checking on a cake every five minutes towards the end of the cook time.   My cake wasn't nearly done in an hour, so I gave it another twenty minutes.  It still wasn't done, so I gave it another ten minutes and then it ended up very dry.   Fortunately, the plan was to put strawberries in syrup and whipped cream over the top of it, so it helped with the dryness.  The almond extract was a bit overpowering, however.   This isn't a bad recipe, but it definitely needs some revision.

This recipe is just like one my mom would always make growing up. It has a beautiful, crunchy top and is moist and dense, just like a pound cake should be. I always learned that you should bring the eggs, milk, and butter to room temp, so I did that. Also, I did 1 tsp almond flavoring and 1 tsp vanilla extract. This was the perfect pound cake for my holiday table!

We all loved it, only change was to cut back on the almond extract to 1 1/2 tsp. But, next time I will use the full amount called for.

I made this one as well and loved it! My only changes were that I didn't have cake flour, so I followed someone's suggestion about cornstarch and I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla. I also took someone else's suggestion of mixing for a long time. I'm not an expert so I don't know if it made a difference, but I do know I liked how it turned out so I will do it the same way next time.

I loved this.  Simple to put together and final results were great.  I always have trouble with making cakes, boxed or scratch but this turned out better than expected.

This recipe is AMAZING!!!!  I don't make any changes per say; I use an almond bakery emulsion (and add extra cause mmmmmmmm, the almond flavour is so good!!!), I change the sugar amount depending on whether we're eating it as is (using full sugar amount) or with a whipped cream frosting (reducing it to 1 3/4c),and I bake it in a spring form pan versus a bundt pan. You can use all kinds of different extracts with this recipe; lemon, cherry, raspberry etc, but almond is the best!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with the world !!

This cake is very delicious!  I was in the mood last night to make something using ingredients I had at home and this was my first time trying a pound cake recipe.  I have really enjoyed reading the reviews.  Definitely a winner.  Someone else suggested making the cake flour with all-purpose flour and corn starch.  (1cup cake flour = 3/4 cup all-purpose + 2 tbs. + 2 tbs corn starch).  It makes for a dense but smooth, melt-in-your-mouth consistency.  I was glad there was no salt called for in the recipe.  Big plus.  Overall a winner!

This is an awesome recipe. Cake came out moist and tastes really good. Although I made few changes. Instead of 2 teaspoons of Almond extract, I used 1tsp of Vanilla Extract, 1/2tsp of Almond Extract and 1/2TSP of Lemon extract. I also added some diced almonds and dried berries. Came out really good. Kids really enjoyed it.

Made exactly as written except used almond milk instead of regular. I think I over mixed because it came out so light it was closer to Angel Food cake than pound cake.  I served it one night with grilled pineapple, another night I grilled the cake slices and served with strawberries and cream. Finally I grilled the cake and served with grilled pineapple and rum sauce.  All were delicious.

I love to bake but this was my first time making pound cake. This recipe was fantastic. The texture was great and so was the flavor. I am a fan of almond extract but may do half vanilla extract next time as other's suggested. Did not find it too sweet.

My fiancé is a huge fan of pound cake. When we first met, he raved on and on about the pound cake his ex’s mother would make. I’m glad to say that he loves this pound cake. I haven’t heard a thing about his former pound cakes!

Cake was a bit too sweet even though I used just two cups of sugar instead of 2 1/2 cps.  Wasn't crazy about the almond flavoring, will use vanilla instead next time.

I cut the almond extract in half and added 1 tsp vanilla extract and still thought the almond flavoring was too much.  Next time I will only use vanilla extract.  The texture was perfect!

I am not a novice at baking and I did notice that the batter looked very soupy and grainy. I decided to continue baking this cake and it turned out just as I expected-  believe it has too many eggs and not enough flour to balance it out. Well, on to the next one......

I loved the texture and moistness of this pound cake, but the taste was not as rich as I wanted.  I did use the half vanilla, half almond.  I used half and half instead of milk.  I just baked this tonight though.  The flavor of some cakes ripens in a day or so.  Maybe this will be one of them.  Thanks for the recipe.

this was great. I made it for a dinner party. It was nice and fluffy and just the right sweetness. I left out the almond extract because i didnt have it on hand, but instead i added fresh lemon juice about a tablespoon or so. And ofcourse the zest of a whole lemon because that gives the most flavour and looks nice too.(the little yellow specks in the cake)I luved it thanks for a great recipe. I might try spliting the batter in half and adding cocoa powder to one half and layering the two batters together to make a marble pound cake next time. thanks again.

I just made this today and here is how it comes out from the oven: although I used 1 tsp of almond and 1 tsp of vanilla exctract (as suggested from some reviewers) the almond taste was too much. The cake came out too dry and was too sweet that I could'n eat more of it. I don't think that I'm going to make this recipe again. But if I do I am surely cutting off some sugar.

This is moist and wonderful.  It's a hit no matter where I take it.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use vanilla instead of almond flavor (don't particularly like almond).

Fantastic pound cake recipe.  It was heavy, moist, dense just like it should be.  I used buttermilk instead. I normally switch off between buttermilk, evaporated milk, heavy cream, or half and half. All work very well. And I used cake flour. We dont like the taste of almond extract, so I used vanilla, and butter & nut.  The trick is not to overmix the flour into the batter.  This has the signature thin crust on the bottom, which is our favorite part! The outside crust is not chewy or tough at all. The entire cake is tender and moist.  Ive made quiet a few different pound cake recipes, and this one is the best.

I liked the cake a little. I guess it is just too dense for me. That said the recipe was fine, I made a few alterations and it turned out well. Again it just isn't for me. I might try another pound cake recipe, but probably not this one again.

This cake is wonderful. I love homeade recipes. I tried this recipe and this is a keeper. I added my own touch, but I truly appreciate the basic recipe. I've made this cake a couple of times for my family. It never last for more than two days.
Thanks

This was very good, I had a hard time getting it out of the pan, but that could be my inexperience talking.  I will make this again.  Other posters commented on the strong almond flavor which I noticed but found pleasant.  If you are unsure, half it and add the rest vanilla.  Worth trying.  This was my first pound cake, and I was pretty darn proud of it.

I made this a long time ago and am just getting around to reviewing it.  I did not like this at all, but I've never been fond of pound cake.  My coworkers seemed to like it, though.  I won't make it again just due to personal preference.

I substituted half of the almond extract with vanilla and still found the almond flavor too strong. Next time I will try it with vanilla alone. I also used only 2 cups of sugar as other reviewers had suggested.

But overall the recipe was great, the cake turned out really moist and tasty. Will definitely give it another go.

This is the only pound cake recipe i'll use for now on! I ommitted the shortening and used just the 2 sticks of butter. Delicious! Thanks

I didn't have shortening, so used butter instead.  Threw in 100gram of pounded almonds too.  It didn't turn out as soft and moist as what has been described by many.  I think mine was rather dry, could be the addition of the almonds.  I didn't use 2 tsp of almond essence either.  Used 1 tsp of that and 1 tsp of vanilla.

I love this recipe.  The almond flavor is a nice change from ordinary pound cake and it is so moist.     I do agree - it is wonderful with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  It's a good strawberry shortcake as opposed to those dry shortcake cups they sell at the grocery store.

I used a 10 inch bundt pan just like the recipe said to and my cake spilled over. It has been cooking for 2 hours and it is still not done. I am afraid I am having the same problem as others. I hope the cake tastes good.

This cake was a disappointment. I followed the recipe and reviewers' hints to a T only to have the cake overflow the pan and come out in crumbles. Taste was overpowering almond extract.  Next time I will try for a traditional pound cake recipe.

This is a very good pound cake.  I used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract.  If you are using a 10 inch tube pan this cake will not spill out of the pan.  It came out golden and I didn't have any problem with sticking because I used "Pam" to coat the pan.

I'll give it a two only because of the flavor; I followed the recipe as written with the exception of the flavor, I made mine lemon. Otherwise a very disappointing result. The cake overflowed the pan, and took over 2 hours to bake. After removal from the pan it was very crumbly. So, back to the drawing board and off to clean the bottom of my oven.....

Very easy to make and tasty, too.  I didn't have a bundt pan.  I filled half the batter into muffin pans.  Dropped some cream cheese into each muffin along with some blueberries.  The rest of the batter I poured into a tart pan, then covered in cream cheese frosting and topped with fruit (kiwi,mango, blueberries, strawberries).  I'll make it again.  Thanks, Aunt Johnnie!

The pound cake was delicious. Mine stuck to the pan but I think it was my own fault. I took the suggestion of the pastry chef andwhipped it for 20 min, it was so beautiful and fluffy. Thanks for sharing.

I made this cake for my family and everyone including myself found this it to be too sweet.  My kids couldn’t/wouldn’t even finish one slice!  We didn’t enjoy it and I’ll have to throw this cake away.  I only used 2 cups of sugar instead of 2.5 and it was still too sweet.  If I do decide to make it again I will use much less sugar and/or use salt to take away from the sweetness.

My husband loves this cake.  Some of my tasters felt it had too strong an almond flavor, so I tried substituting different flavorings, but they seemed bland to me.  The texture really is wonderful and moist.

Seems to be the 7-up cake using milk instead of 7-up. It was good but not spectacular. I will try it again since I do make 7-up cakes a lot and I'm no longer drinking sodas ( i always have milk)

I have made this twice. Both times the cake stuck to the pan causing it to rip. My mother has also made this for easter with the same problem. We've greased and floured the pan as directed. Flavor is pretty good. I just wish it didn't take me 5 mins to get out of the pan and have it be broken.

I was so excited about making this because of the rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, but we were very disappointed! We thought it was very bland. My husband took a couple bites, and couldn't even finish the rest of it! I won't be making this again, sorry!

I made this for Easter.  It was a hit at our house. Got raves from everyone. The almond extract was powerful, so next time I will use less. But there were no complaints from it, most liked it.  I will be making this cake for church tomorrow.  Thanks for a GREAT POUND CAKE RECIPE.  GOD BLESS YOU.....

This is THE BEST pound cake I have ever made/had!  Everyone always looks for it at holiday and family gatherings.  A few changes I made were just 2 cups sugar, and instead of almond I use 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1-2 tsp of lemon extract.  I also make a simple lemon glaze to go on top...EXCELLENT and VERY MOIST! Tastes the best after sitting for a day!

I found this to be, very good and simple to make.However when I made it again it wasn't as good.This is mediocre recipe.

I don't know if this makes a difference but: I ground my granulated sugar , baked the cake in a convection oven, baked it for 1 hour and 22 minutes, and ate the cake while it was both hot and lukewarm .

Some things I noticed about this cake , after it was baked , would be,the almond extract had a subtle taste,the top had kind of a very thin crust-like texture,and sometimes I would see air bubbles 1/4 inches in diameter.

Wow, the best!! This was my first pound cake & it was easy.
The only changes I made was replacing some of the milk with plain yogurt I had to use up & I used plain flour, sifted.

This recipe is astonishingly simple and good! I mixed in some crushed nuts in the batter before baking and got a gorgeous nutty pound cake. I love that the recipe is simple enough to play with, but classic enough to savor entirely on its own.

I thought this cake was just okay, flavor-wise.  It just wan't "buttery", I thought.  I even reduced the shortening to 1/4 cup and increased the butter by the same amount.   I really liked the texture, though.  Very dense and had a really good feel in the mouth, but it was just kind of bland.  My husband even asked if it was low-fat.   So....This is just one person's opinion, and obviously alot of people really like this recipe.  I just would like something more buttery.

Three 12 year old girls made this for a math project and took a slice to all the class.  Everyone loved it and could not wait to get the recipe.  It turned out perfect.

i use this recipe ALL the time, but tonight i decided to change things a little. i put my sugar in a blender and made it very fine before i mixed it with the butter. i also substituted the almond for 2 tsp. vanilla and added 1/2 tsp of cake spice and used a lemon glaze when it was finished. this is ABSOLUTELY delicious. i also mixed all the ingredients by hand besides the butter and sugar. it is sooo moist and chewy. i hope there's some left when my husband gets home, lol, as he was the one who requested it!!

This cake is absolutely awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  The only problem I had was a little overflow, but the payoff was completely worth it.  This is a recipe that I will use over and over again.  THANKS!

This was pretty good but not the best. 3.5 stars would be accurate. I did substitute buttermilk (which we prefer in cakes) for the milk.  I've tried a few pound cakes from this site and this was not my fave.  I love Barbara's Golden Pound cake, and it went a lot quicker than this one.  Probably would not make again.

the cake was awsome - the only change i made was to use less almond only because i ran out - replaced with vanilla - i also hand mixed the flour and milk alternately - the next time i will use the kitchen aid mixer on low speed will let you know how that works-

This is the best recipe I have ever found for pound cake.  I take this to all functions and it is always a hit.  I find the almond extract gives the cake a unique flavor that is very delightful.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with me.  It is now one of my all time favorites.

What a GREAT recipe! The cake came out so moist and absolutely delicious. Instead of using two teaspooons of almond extract, I used one tsp almond extract and one tsp vanilla extract. Again...a wonderful recipe! I will definetley make it again...and again...and again!!!

i used this for a trifle and it turned out good.  i think by itself though it would have been a little too sweet for me.  my partner liked it by itself though.
also, i used regular flour instead of cake flour as i didn't have any on hand.

Thanks for the recipe, Jean! I followed the recipe exactly as you have written and it TURNED OUT PERFECT! It was so moist and just the right height. I used it as a base in a berry trifle dessert so it was nice to save a "few" cubes of cake off to the side :-) My hubby LOVED it! Definitely a keeper!

This cake is delicious!  I did use 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. of almond extract instead of the 2 tsp. of almond extract.  I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon because I was serving it with spiced peaches.  It came out wonderful.  It makes a large cake that has a sweet crunchy outside and a dense, smooth inside.  My husband took the leftover cake (plain) to work and received many compliments.  I was a bit skeptical about baking it at such a low temperature, but it turned out perfect.  Will make again for sure!

The flavor was very nice, I added vanilla extract as well.  However, I felt that the cake was not as dense or moist as Pound Cake is supposed to be.  I will add a few table spoons of oil next time, in hope that will make it more moist.

This was excellent pound cake. I didn't have almond extract, so I substituted orange and vanilla extract. It turned out moist with just a hint of citrus. This pound cake was DEVOURED at a fondue party I threw. I would definitely make this again.

After hearing my boss rave about this site, I looked it up because I needed a pound cake recipe. I picked this one b/c of its reviews and everyone was right. This is a great pound cake. Everyone that tried it LOVED IT! I must say that at first when warm it tastes very sweet but as it cools off, its just fine. I will be using this site more often, thanks!

I made this for a berry trifle, and it was perfect with berries & whipped cream!  I didn't have cake flour, so I just used all purpose flour and it came out a bit dense.  But it was still very tasty!  Thanks Jean for sharing!

This was a good recipe. I made this pound cake with my friend Amanda and upon our first taste, we agreed that it was great. The almond flavor was delicious, but I wasn't too fond of how the 'outer coating' so to speak was a bit crunchy--I would've preferred it soft. It was still good either way. I'd recommend it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This cake almost didn't get baked, the batter was so good my husband had to take it away from me.  Excellent texture, soooo easy to make and I personally add a little extra almond extract. Everyone loves it and asks for more!!!!

This wasn't as good as I expected it to be, and it didn't get rave reviews from my husband or in-laws.  It was really, really sweet.  I think if I made it again I would cut down on the sugar in it.  The texture of the cake is incredible though, I was really pleased with that!

I love to bake and try every recipe imagineable.  I found this recipe to be O.K. The cake was very moist and unlike many others, mine did not spill over the pan.  The cake, in my opinion was not very flavorful.  I would suggest using buttermilk instead or maybe adding some sour cream to give it some kick.

This is an awesome pound cake!  I used half the almond extract and it turned out perfectly.  What a wonderful compliment to strawberries and whipped cream!

Fabulous recipe.  Turns out great everytime.  A great base recipe for pound cake.  Moist, tender, dense, rich.  Sometimes I use lemon juice/extract instead of almond and sometimes just vanilla and or almond. I also like to add butter flavoring for an extra zing. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was a very simple pound cake. I made it plain and I made a second one with a very light orange glaze. They both were a big hit. Cory

I really expected an outstanding result from the reviews but the cake was kind of bland and I think it overcooked cause it was really dry, my hubby had to wash it down with some milk. It tasted good though, but still not what I expected and I did follow the recipe as is.

I recently served this pound cake at a friend's bridal shower & everyone loved it.  Very smooth, even textured, light & absolutely scrumptuous!  I glazed it & placed sugared fruit (grapes, plums & pears) around it to dress it up a bit, although it could easily stand alone with powdered sugar and still be a hit.

This was my first attempt at making a pound cake from scratch and I was a little leery of the outcome BUT to my delight the cake was perfect!  My husband and children really enjoyed the cake and asked me to make it again during the T'giving holiday season.

My daughter and I have just started baking from 'scratch'.  She is 13 years old and loves to bake as much as I do.  We made this together and had a blast doing it.  It was WONDERFUL!!  I know it said to let it cool but I was so excited by the way it looked that I had to try it quick.  I also substituted vanilla since I had no almond extract but I think I will try that next time.

This is a good pound cake recipe, I cut down on the sugar and used only 3 eggs and it still turned out well, very moist and delicious.  I used my bundt pan and I did not have any trouble with the batter spilling over the edge.  I think people are using a different pan than a bundt pan.

Thanks for this wonderful recipe! I just won a red ribbon at the county fair. The judge said it would have been a blue ribbon but there were a few air holes in the cake. Oh well, it is the best pound cake I have ever tasted.

This really is a great recipe.  I made it according to the recipe.  Next time I will use different flavorings though.  I think lemon with either a lemon glaze or maybe orange.  The cake was sweet, but with a little citrus tang I think it would be perfect.  The texture was wonderful, moist and tender.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely fabulous.  I followed the instructions and it came out perfect.  I would probably add a little less sugar.  I tasted the first piece and thought I was in heaven.  The second piece was accompanied by strawberries and ice cream; at that point, I knew I was heaven!  Baked 2 in one week for family and friends.  Will do again for work and home around 4th of July.

Really is moist!  I also substituted vanilla for the almond extract with good results. AND, yes, it did bake "over" the top of the pan for me too. I think next time I will bake it in 2 separate pans.  I didn't see the need to beat the sugar and butter for 10 minutes.  The consistency didn't change much over the minutes.  Could easilly get away with just a few minutes, until thoroughly blended. Will definitely make this one again!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I used an electric mixer and made the batter really fluffy and it baked over the sides of my bundt pan.  I think I would prefer using vanilla next time, and about HALF the sugar recommended.  It was kind of sweet.

This is a very moist cake and very flavorful. I really enjoyed baking it. I baked on Christmas Eve for Christmas Day and I can't wait to make it again. It is the best pound cake recipe that I have yet to find.

Made this last Saturday to take to a group meeting.  It was an enormous hit. Wonderful with fruit and whipped cream!  I'll certainly will make it again without hesitation, definitely a "keeper"!

This was a very moist and favorful pound cake.  Baking time was almost 90 minutes...  I was impressed with the volume with a golden brown color.

I have dozens of pound cake recipes but this one is great with raspberry sauce, fresh strawberries, lemon sauce or whatever you put with it.  I took it to the office with 3 different toppings and it was a smash!

This is a very good cake. I have substituted the flavouring with liquer, and it tasted great! Not too "boozy", but a really nice flavour. It takes a while to prepare, but it lends itself to a lot of different flavours (fresh fruit, etc.), so it's really versatile. Would probably taste really good if you soaked it in a bit of liquer with whipped cream for an adult party or the holidays.
