I really like this recipe because it is healthy and yummy. I think I'll change it up just a little bit next time. I think the sauce wasn't quite enough so I might make a little more. Also, it needed a little spicing up so I think I will throw in some ground cayenne pepper. But this is a good base recipe and you can throw in the veggies you want and adjust the spices as desired.

I had some shrimp to use and was in the mood for stir fry, so I came across this and was sold. The only changes I made were for personal preference...threw in some zuchinni, used green instead of red peppers and I did make extra sauce because 1) I marinated the shrimp in for about 30 minutes and 2) I just love extra sauce. Gettin hungry just thinking about it...Thanks!

I really liked the sauce in this recipe, it "glued" everything together well, but wasn't soupy. I added 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper and 1 tsp of sesame oil to the sauce. Next time I would up the soy sauce by another tablespoon too. Definitely a keeper!

This was a great way to try something new as far as stir-fry goes, but it wasn't the most "WOW" dish I have ever had, and my hubby thought it was a little bland.  But overall, it was good and very easy.  With a little more ginger and a few more cloves garlic, it should taste a lot better.  I may try making it again with some alterations.

This rating is just for the stir-fry sauce only, which was really good!  I doubled the water/cornstarch, soy, ginger and garlic.  Added diced chicken instead of shrimp, and used a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies.  Served on top of brown rice for an easy, quick meal!

Light and flavorful without being overpowering.  Use uncooked shrimp as pre-cooked will give it a different taste.

Had to double the sauce definetely. The flavor wasnt exactly what I was expecting, it was very peanut tasting to me. But the sauce was pleasantly creamy

Have made this several times & varied ingredients slightly (broccoli only; added honey; extra ginger/soy; no nuts) and it's always very good.

Yummy..... I don't think I'm ever eating out chinese again :P The only thing is that it seemed too much cornstarch, so I had to add chicken broth. Besides that it was a big hit with huby and daughter, and easy.

Just what I was looking for. I thought the sauce was great; I took it off the stove just after it started to thicken and it was perfect. Changed it just a little for personal preference (no onions, no peppers, added some low salt chicken boullion to the water). Served with brown rice and enjoyed it!

Pretty good recipe for a straightforward stir-fry - certainly would be adaptable for chicken or pork or whatever. Might try to jazz up a bit more with more garlic and ginger next time as it was pretty tame - but it was easy. I used chicken  broth instead of water and it was not too salty even with the soy sauce, so it may have been even more bland without the broth...

I did alter the vegetables- I used green pepper instead of red and added mushrooms, bean sprouts, and peapods.  The sauce thickened up nicely but very weak flavor. You could barely taste the ginger or garlic. I will definitely use more of both next time.  To make the sauce more flavorful, I added terriaki sauce and sweet and sour stir-fry sauce and it made the dish much more flavorful.

This recipe is great and very easy! I opted out for the peanuts, because I do not like them and did not think my kids would like them. But I think, if you are into that sort of thing, they would have been great in there. I added a touch more ginger, because I like things a little spicier. My kids, surprisingly loved it! They did not even notice the green onions! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

We like this recipe but it was a little bland. We spiced it up with some hot sauce. Also, left out the peanuts due to an allergy and added some chicken chunks. Good, easy middle of the week recipe.

Would have to agree with KRISRIZZIO. Needs a little spicing up. I added crushed red chilies and a good dollop of peanut butter for a Thai flavour. Well done Josie!

Unexciting is the way I'd rate this recipe.  The sauce was way too thick - like glue (maybe it was me - did I do something wong??)  and not much flavor.  You need to add fresh ginger, and real garlic - forget the powders.  Add a cup of snow peas for more crunch.  I won't say it was bad, it was just ho hum - not the best recipe I've tried so I won't be making this again, sorry Josie.

The sauce was good.  Like others, I doubled it and added additional soy and ginger.  Also, you can add all sorts of vegetables such as mushrooms, water chestnuts, bamboo, bean sprouts.  Very filling and really no need for rice!

I've made this twice and it is amazing! The one thing I'd do is add a little bit of salt and maybe some lime juice to the cornstarch/water sauce because two table spoons of soy sauce wasn't quite enough for me. But over all, a great way to cook shrimp quickly!

I thought it was good. I would make it according to the recipe next time. I followed reviews (extra soy sauce) that made it a little too mushy for me. I wouldn't compare this to a Chinese restaurant's stir fry, but it's an easy, quick meal.

This was quick and easy!  I even cheated on the peppers.  I had a frozen bag of peppers and a frozen bag of mixed oriental vegetables.  The whole process took less than twenty minutes.  The flavor of the sauce is light and doesn't overpower the shrimp and veggies :)

I too made double the sauce, but it was a little too much. I would rather have that than not enough though. Also, I live overseas and don't have access to frozen veggies, so I made up my own mix of fresh ones: 1/2 a carrot, 1/2 a zucchini, and 2 celery shoots. I loved the combination. I also didn't have any peanuts so I used 1/4 cup of peanut butter. I liked this as well. The one thing missing was a little kick, so I will likely add some red chillies paste next time.

This is a good basic stir fry recipe, but a bit too dry for my liking, so I added 1/2 c orange juice into the sauce as it was thickening to make it a bit saucier.

This was quite good - when my husband made it he made the following changes - no red pepper, used fresh veggies in place of frozen, added a little sesame oil and used more soy sauce. Everybody had seconds, and we'll definitely make this again!

This was a great meal served with vegetable fried rice. I added extra veggies (2 lg peppers with the 2c broccoli and half a sliced red onion) and in the future I will double the sauce portion of the recipe for our tastes. The ginger does add a really nice flavor. Thanks for sharing.

Good, but a little blah. Left out the peanuts as I am not a huge fan of them. I even added extra honey at the end, but it didn't affect it much.

Easy and delicious! I used fresh garlic and ginger, I think that works better in general that powdered stuff.  I mixed a few fresh veggies with frozen and it turned out wonderfully!

I didn't have an broccoli so I just added extra veggies including fancy mushrooms from the Asian Market. I do think the sauce was a little bland and so next time I make it I think I'll try replacing the water with chicken broth and then add some cayenne for kick. All in all a nice dish though and the peanuts really gave it character.

This was the best stir fry my family has ever tasted.  My husband wanted a stir fry that tasted like "moms" and we found it.  I have tried this with chicken as well and it tastes great too. Thank you for posting this recipie

My family loved this and it was super easy to make. I added an extra splash of soy sauce and substituted the ambiguous "oriental vegetables" for mushrooms and pea pods. Everyone loved it and this recipe definitely got a perfect 10. Served it over no yolk noodles.

I doubled the sauce as suggested by others but it made it so thick.  I think next time I will double all of the sauce ingredients but keep the original measurement fo the cornstarch.  Very tasty!

I give this recipe a 5 star because it incorporates convenience foods.  I just used what fresh veggies I had in the fridge (green pepper and green onion) and added the frozen oriental style veggies and frozen shrimp.

This was good, not amazing, but good for a weekday dinner, that was easy and quick.  We didn't have any peanuts so we used crunchy peanut butter which actually worked out well with the sauce.  For two of us we used 2 tablespoons of PB.

I did mine a little differently- used "California" mix veggies and "Garden Variety" veggies but still used the same method for sauce- the sauce was AMAZING! Just like a restaurant. Definatly the BEST stir-fry I've ever had! DEFINATLEY a keeper, thanks so much!

Simple and delicious!  Took almost no time to make and was great!  I may suggest keeping some extra soy on the table, a few eaters preferred it a little more salty.

I give it 5 stars because of how easy, delicious, and flexible it is. I used some butter with the olive oil, yellow onion, zucchini, fresh garlic, mushrooms,  local South Carolina shrimp, and that's it in my 70 year old 13" cast iron skillet.  Work fast and skillet needs to stay very hot.   After I put the ingredients into my serving dish I deglazed the skillet with about a cup and a half of water. We like extra sauce.  Basmati rice is our favorite.

I followed this recipe as written but probably should have read the reviews first.  It is good and healthy but needs a bit more flavor.  The sauce was a bit too think- next time I will use more water and more soy sauce.  Definitely needs more fresh garlic and will probably add some crushed red pepper.  But it is a good base and I will definitely make it again!

5 stars! I did double all those ingredients except the cornstarch and added 2TBL honey. so it was just enough sauce and not too thick. Since I've made this recipe so many times, I've also added mushrooms, spinach, carrots, zucchini, squash.... Anyway, the sauce was great.

Excellent basic recipe.    The next time I think I will not use frozen oriental vegetables and make up my own mixture of bamboo shoots, water chestnut, bean sprout, etc..     Also, I will cut back on the corn starch.   This recipe stiffened up a little more than I wanted it to.

Really fantasic! Super easy too. I added fresh garlic, honey and ginger as well. I put all the sauce ingredients into a bowl and used my immersion blender. The sauce was smooth and perfectly blended. I served it over jasmine rice.

This was really good! I was sick and tired of the bottled or package stir fry sauces and decided to give this a shot! It's a great base sauce, but does need a little extra zip. Not too salty or sweet. I added some fresh ginger w/the fresh garlic. Skipped the oriental vegetables and just used broccoli, red pepper, green onion and there was plenty of sauce. I chopped the peanuts but I think next time I will leave them whole and I may try to marinate the shrimp in the suace first as one reviewer suggested to hopefully give it that missing oomph!

Very good.  I doubled the sauce since so many other reviews said to, didn't use the oriental veggie mix and instead added other fresh vegetables (zucchini, celery, snow peas).  I will definitely make this again.

This is the first stir-fry I've made without using a packet or jar of premade sauce.  I thought it was very good but it needed a little something more...maybe more garlic.  My husband loves Chinese food and mentioned how we won't have to order in now that I can make it to his liking.  ;)  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good, good in large skillet, and very healthy seeming with vegetables included.

This is ok, but not a huge fan.  I may have made the sauce too thick (which i did double), or maybe after it sat it thickend??  It ended up tasting like a gourmet frozen entree.  Maybe it was just my cooking.  Thanks Anyway:)

I found this recipe to be very bland. This one just did not hit the spot.

This was fine.  It was nothing special and I felt it needed something more in the flavor department, but I can't quite put my finger on it.

My daughter loved this recipe!!  I used more ginger and soy sauce and added 1/2 - 3/4 tsp. crushed red pepper for a better tasting sauce.  I didn't have any stir fry veggies,  so I just used broccoli and cauliflower and with second time with califonia medly!! Tastes very good with chicken too.

This was great - only change was that I added a little Cayenne Pepper to the sauce.
