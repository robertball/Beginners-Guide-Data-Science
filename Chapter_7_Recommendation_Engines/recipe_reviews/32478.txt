I have tried four different smoothie recipes from this site in the past couple of weeks, and this one is my favorite!  It is so tasty and easy to prepare.

Because my strawberries were frozen solid (hard as rocks) I had to blend 1/4 milk into this drink to thin it down. This was the best flavored smoothie I've tried in a long time. We loved it. The blend of lemon, berries and orange juice was very refreshing and delicious. Will keep this one around. Thanks Janice!

My children really liked this.  My strawberries weren't very sweet, so I added a touch of sugar.  Thanks for sharing.

A really yummy smoothie Janice.  I didn't have the strawberries..(I know, how can I rate this recipe when I didn't use the correct fruit) but I had some leftover pineapple, kiwi, oranges and cherries from a fruit salad I made the other day. So, I dumped that in my blender and used key lime yogurt since I couldn't find the lemon.  This was sooo good.  Didn't exactly follow the recipe, but I'm sure my version is just as yummy.

I made this smoothie for breakfast.  This recipe tasted very good.  It was so quick and easy to make.  I usually freeze my fresh strawberries because I don't always use them up quick enough.  What a great way to use frozen strawberries!

Delicious!  Really refreshing.  I think next time I'll add some vanilla to play with the flavor, but it really doesn't need anything, it's great as is!

I added  3 cubes of ice and the juice of one lemon (and the lemon zest...why not?  I like things tart).  I also used frozen raspberries instead of strawberries.  (I guess I changed it a lot).  But WOW...this tasted like raspberry sorbet.  It was Magnificent!

I have been craving some nutrious fruit and this recipe caught my eye while searching. I used a thick thick and creamy organic Stoneyfield yogurt and I sed my juicer to juice a fresh orange for the orange juice portion. I also used fresh strawberries too. I think making this with all fresh ingredients will yield the best results. This made a perfectly balanced fruit smoothie, the texture was perfect as was the taste. I will be making this one often, thank you!

I've really been in a smoothie mood, so I thought I'd try this out - mostly because it didn't call for weird ingredients like some did. It is so yummy! Definitely a favorite!

This is delicious! My kids loved it. Of course you should use frozen berries when making this. The lemon yogurt is what really makes this recipe so good.

This WAS yummy!!!  I just have two things I had to adjust.  First thing was the yogurt.  I can't find 8 ounce cups of yogurt ANYWHERE.  They come in 6oz.  SO...because of that, I had to adjust everything else a tad.  I lowered the orange juice a bit and leave out a strawberry.  HOWEVER, I *DID* have to add a little milk (as another poster mentioned) because it was REALLY thick.  Even doing all of the above, I still could taste the lemon, strawberry, AND orange juice..and THAT is what makes something wonderful :) Perfect blend of ingredients.   Even my 4 year old loved it (and he loves NOTHING of this type).

I quadrupled this to make enough for all four of us. My strawberries were frozen. Very simple and we all liked this. Next time, I'll throw in a frozen banana or two.

Very simple and good.  I was too inpatient to wait for the strawberries to freeze but the drink was still very good.  Had I allowed the strawberries to freeze, I’m sure it would have been even more refreshing.

This is nice and sweet as is. Sometimes I'll add 1/2 scoop of vanilla EAS whey protein powder to add about 12 g of protein to it. Delicious!

EXCELLENT SMOOTHIE!!!! I did not have fresh strawberries but I did have the bird's eye frozen strawberries w/ syrup. I have a 16 year old that is as picky as a 2 year old.  When I made this for her I expected the usual disdain for new recipes. As she took her first sip her eyes got as big as saucers and very quietly she asked me what was in it. I told her and her exact response was "This is freak'n awesome." Needless to say I gave this recipe a 5 star rating.

Excellent.  I used a frozen mix of raspberry, blueberry, and marionberry, vanilla yogurt with lemon juice and apple raspberry juice concentrate.  I just blended and added until it was the right consistency.  mmm mmm good.

So easy and actually tastes really good (for someone trying to be a little healthier). I used frozen stawberries which made it a little thicker. Great recipe!

This was very good!  My family loved it too.  It has a great amount of protein and not too many carbs, compared to a lot of other smoothie recipes.  I will make this one again, often!

The lemon yogurt was a nice added flavor you don't get in most smoothies.  My only additions were 1/2 scoop of soy protein powder and 1 teaspoon ground flaxseed.

Very tasty! My family complained that it's  a little on the tart side (I didn't personally mind it) so I added some condensed milk in to sweeten it.

Oh yum!  My strawberries were rock solid also so had to let them sit for about 15 minutes.  Used vanilla yogurt (all I had) and added half a pack of Equal.  Delicious!

I didn't have any orange juice, but I did have Sunny Delight. I used 1/3 cup of that and it tasted great, although it did make the smoothie a little tangy. I also cut up the strawberries before freezing them - I found it easier for them to blend. However, I will probably freeze the strawberries for longer than one hour next time. And the only yogurt I had came in 6 oz cups, which was still more than enough for me - I feel like 8 oz may have made it too tangy with the Sunny D. 

Great basic recipe though, and one I will definitely be trying again!

Awesome smoothie.  My yogurt comes in 6-ounce containers, so that's how much I used.  I also added a handful of oats and some flaxseed.  Delicious.  Next time, I may try vanilla yogurt since that's what's in the fridge.  Definitely a go-to smoothie recipe.

I thought this smoothie was great, but my family thought that the lemon was a little overpowering as the dominant flavor. I made three servings, and so put in three 8 oz. cups of yogurt - next time I'll only put in two. I still thought it was a great smoothie, though! Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  I used nonfat lemon yogurt to cut down on sugar and calories.  I didn't see any 8 ounce containers so I used 6 oz of yogurt and a little extra orange juice.  Nice & light, not overly sweet.

Excellent smoothie. Since my strawberries were not very sweet I used about a TBS of raw, unprocessed, local honey to sweeten.  I figured if I was going to have something healthy such as a smoothie, I would use honey as a sweetener.  Much better option.

So yummy!!  Love the citrus and strawberry combo.  And what a pretty color. Only addition was 3-4 ice cubes to make it icey cold and thicker.  Another great smoothie to add in to my rotation. Thanks Janice!

I am surprised that the lemon and strawberry flavors are so good together.  I used frozen berries I had put up in my freezer, so that may account for having to thin it down a bit with a little more orange juice. This is a really good, refreshing smoothie.

I blended exactly as directed and found it very tart. I decided to throw in about 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries that I had on hand, and a squirt of honey. That seemed to do the trick for me. Of course, with adding blueberries, this may have to be a California via NH Smoothie?

A great basic recipe.  I used plain yogurt and a mixture of frozen strawberries and blueberries and instead of orange juice I added frozen concentrate 5Alive.  Plus I added 2 tablespoons of flax seed and a bit of splenda to sweeten it some more.  My husband really liked it too!

I was disapointed with this recipe. I had to use vanilla yogurt, because I had no lemon, and I don't know if that's what did it but it was not very good at all. You could distinctly taste the orange juice! I don't know if I will try this again with lemon or not.

Very quick easy and delicious smoothie.  It was good as it is.  To our taste, we liked a little more orange Juice and a little less yogurt to make it a little easier to drink through a straw that retains the sweet with a touch of sour yumminess.

Great consistency, exactly what I want a smoothie to feel like. OJ flavor is a little strong, I think next time I might use half the OJ and replace that volume with some vanilla almond milk to balance things out.

I didnt have any of the ingredients so I improvised. I used plain greek yogurt, the juice of a lime, a small bag of frozen peaches and an almost too ripe banana. It was fantastic! I'm pretty sure you could substitute any fruit and it will come out great! I intend to make this as the recipe calls.

I have tried several smoothie recipes from this site and this one is very simple and refreshing! I don't like anything that is time consuming or takes lots of ingredients! I made no substitutions! I give it a 5 star rating!

This smoothie is perfection!  There is no greater combination of fruit, yogurt, & juice that I have found!  I make this with many different types of fruit and switch up the yogurt, but my absolute favorite is the recipe as written!  My kids ask for this every night with dinner!  The recipe fill 2 (7 oz) juice glasses perfectly with a tad bit left over for mom!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Instead of using 8oz of lemon yogurt O used 4oz of lemon yogurt and 4oz of vanilla yogurt because I thought it would be too tart! Lovely recipe but just a tad too lemony and yogurty for me. Looks fabulous as well.

I improvised on this drink by adding bananas. I found the drink a bit too frothy and I needed to add some more liquid to concentrate it but it had the authentic smoothie taste that I appreciate.

I made this smoothie after I worked in the yard. So refreshing!  However, I passed on freezing the strawberries and simply added about a 1/2 cup of ice cubes in with all the ingredients and blended in the blender. I love lemon yogurt!  Next time I'm going to try it with Key Lime yogurt.  Overall...Great Smoothie!

To be fair, I used vanilla yogurt and mixed berries so I don't know if this is a five star recipe with the ingredients listed.  Good texture though a bit rich.  I'll make again and maybe mix in a bit of ice.

This recipe was excellent. I didn't have 7 large strawberries, so I just used 1 banana. I also didn't have lemon yogurt, so substituted strawberry yoghurt. Finally, I added a bit of milk, replacing the Orange juice.

I loved the clean, tart flavor of this smoothie.  I froze my strawberries first, as I like a thicker consistency and I used Greek lemon yogurt.  This made two nice sized servings.  Delish!  Thanks for sharing, Janice!

This recipe looks great, but why is it stated that it takes over an hour to make? That's an awfully long time to blend something, isn't it? :-)

Yummy!  Easy!  Used fresh strawberries, freeze before  blending.  Placed blender pitcher in freezer after blending for aboUt 15 minutes to get smoothie nice and cold, then blended again.

We make this smoothie with fresh (unfrozen) strawberries and use greek yogurt (1 cup) and a banana.  Very healthy and filling!

Love it! I've tried several smoothie recipes and this one is a keeper! The orange juice is the difference! Thanks!

This recipe is super easy and SO GOOD. I used low fat lemon yogurt and Trop 50 orange juice to cut down even more on the calories. Planning on making this again!

I used greek yogurt and a little milk since it's thicker, but I had to add some sugar since I'm sure it's not as sweet at regular yogurt. It was really creamy and tasted great, plus had more protein than regular yogurt. Good flavor/texture overall, and easy

Teenage son says this is the best smoothie I've ever made.  High praise!   I liked it too, and especially since it is simple.  I did not have lemon yogurt, so I mixed up my own using 1 cup plain yogurt, juice and zest from one medium lemon, and sugar to taste. That made enough lemon yogurt for three smoothies.
