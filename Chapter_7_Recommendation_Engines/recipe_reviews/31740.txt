I made this for the second time tonight, and I made some changes.  I almost doubled the spices, used fresh spinach, subbed cottage cheese for the ricotta and increased the amount slightly, increased the amount of Parmesan slightly, added some chopped provolone cheese, and added some Italian style bread crumbs to combat the soupiness.  Also, half way through baking, I topped the halves with fresh tomato slices instead of sauce.  NOW it was excellent, after a little tweaking.  A very good basic recipe, though.

I love this one! I used a pound of fresh baby spinach instead of the frozen because that's what I had on hand. It came out delicious. My husband and children enjoyed this too. The 1 year old ate seconds. Thanks Whitney, I'll be making this one again and sharing it with friends.

i made this dish for thanksgiving & everyone loved it so much that my mother-in-law requested i make it for easter.  

i ended up having extra spinach mixture leftover.  the next day my husband put it on french bread and topped with tomato sauce.  he popped it in the oven until it was warmed and it made a very yummy side dish for dinner.

This is a great recipe to play with. I made several adaptations and my boyfriend was really impressed! He said we should make it at our next dinner party. I used cottage cheese rather than ricotta and I used a strainer to reduce liquid, since many said it was soupy. I also added breadcrumbs to the cheese mixture. Microwaving rather than steaming the zukes saved time and two pots. Had to cook 20 min before adding sauce, then another 10-15 (I also topped with cheese and breadcrumbs). Endlessly adaptable and pretty presentation - I recommend you try this recipe and play with it to suit your tastes. I'll be using this all summer! Thanks for the recipe.

Well, the zucchini is starting to be harvested from the garden and am I ever glad I found this recipe!  Hubby loved it and so did I.  I only modified by adding a sprinkling of mozzarella cheese on top - other than that, I followed the instructions exactly.  My son (who only likes peas & corn as vegetables) actually said, "not bad" and ate a serving himself.  Hubby ate the leftovers as a late-night snack.  A definite keeper!

This recipe turned out pretty good. I expected it to be a bit runny as I used lowfat ricotta. But that didn't happen and I was pleased. The key is to steam the zucchini just enough to retain some firmness.

Very yummy! I used lowfat whipped cottage cheese in lieu of the ricotta and added more parm than called for. I topped the casserole with shredded mozarella. Hubby and kids loved this dish!

I used large yellow squash instead of zukes and didn't follow the recipe very closely but I did use all the other ingredients so I feel justified in leaving a review.  It was not a difficult recipe but it used a lot of dishes so I will try to simplify somehow.  Nevertheless, it is a very tasty, pretty and light entre.  All you need is a loaf of crusty bread.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent.  I served this to a friend who doesn't like zucchini, and they loved it, and my vegetable hating teenager even admitted it was "OK."  I used part skim ricotta, not whole milk, and of course I added more garlic as I do to everything.  It actually took about 35 min or so to get nice and hot, not 20 min as in the recipe, but no big deal.  Just depends on the oven, I suppose.  Will definitely be making this more often.

I used yellow squash instead of zucchini. This is an excellant low-carb recipe. Next time I'll put some extra cheese on top, but it's also delicious without. Tastes like a low-carb manicotti.

This is good if you like just vegetables.  My husband has a similar recipe using sausage which is much better.

I made this last night and only made two changes, I used small patty pan squash and the yellow of the patty pan was a beautiful contrast for the green spinach. Also, I oppsed and forgot to put the sauce on it. It did not matter, it was really really yummy anyway. I will be making this again, next time for company.

We just harvested a few monster zucchini from our garden; this was the perfect way to use them up! I used half ricotta, half cottage cheese, and baked it for a little longer than called for. I also did not steam the zucchini, but rather sliced it in half lengthwise and put it in the microwave a few minutes to cook after scooping out. I used fresh herbs from the garden as well. I recommend draining the frozen spinach and the cheese as well before mixing together. Overall a great recipe for the summer garden!!!!

Wonderful! In order to shave off a few extra calories...I used low fat ricotta and reduced fat parmesan cheese...I also tossed a sprinkling of mozzarella cheese on top the last few minutes in the oven! It was so good I doubt one could tell the difference in the lower fat version as opposed to the fuller version!
YUMMMMY! Can't wait to make this again!

Used yellow squash and zucchini (since we had both on hand) and it was awesome. My boss was jealous all week watching me eat leftovers.

I didn't have the ricotta so I substituted feta with basil & tomato.  Also, to lower the carbs, I dropped off the tomato sauce and topped with grated mozzarella cheese halfway thru baking.  Great recipe!

Very tasty!  I used home-canned marinara instead of canned tomato sauce and used only one egg instead of two.  Other than that, I added all the other ingredients as written.  I thought this was super flavorful and was a quick weeknight dinner.  Next time I may melt some mozzarella or provolone on top.  Thanks for sharing!! :)

Although my husband liked the filling, I was very disappointed.  I agree that it was bland (even though I was a little more generous with the herbs, onion and garlic than written).  The filling never "bubbled" and the tomato sauce just dried out on top of the zucchini.  I would not make this again.

This was great. I left out the spinach and added feta. I also found no need to submerge the squash in water to cool. I just waited a few minutes. Kids loved it!

This was delicious, lowfat and healthy.  I used fat free ricotta cheese and it was delicious.  I made up the filling and can just whip up a yummy lunch any time I want!  I loved it!

This is a great recipe! Easy to make and has lots of flavor. Like lasagna filling but with zucchini! I omitted the onion and used more garlic and fresh spinach instead of frozen. Will definitely make again.

Simple and easy to make; good flavor overall. Subbed fresh chives for the onion since that's what I had on hand. Also used part-skim ricotta. Zukes did not come out mushy. If you want to skip the steaming step, just cook them in the oven longer, but ensure you add enough sauce or wait until half-way through cook time to add sauce. My only problem with the recipe was that I wanted more sauce--the sauce dried out a bit in the dish. Next time I'll try using crushed tomatoes (didn't really care for the taste of the tomato sauce on top).  Overall, taste was good and will definitely make this recipe again!

OJ taste but don't like the texture of the zucchini.
