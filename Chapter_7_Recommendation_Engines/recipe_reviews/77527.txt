The spring roll wrappers needed should be specified more clearly. There are two types of wrappers available. One kind needs to be cooked (made from flour and eggs) while the other (made from rice flour) does not.

I make these all the time for a quick, light dinner.  My favorite dip is quick peanut sauce - 2T hoisin, 2T peanut butter, 1T light soy. Slowly drizzle water in until it achieves a smooth texture.

These spring rolls are awesome! It's always a little nerve-wracking to be the first person to try out a recipe, but these were delicious. I'm not big on the sauce in the recipe, however. I paired these rolls with the Indonesian Satay recipe from this site. That recipe included instructions for a peanut sauce which was WONDERFUL with the spring rolls. I have never worked with rice wrappers before. I was suprised at how pliable they were. I completely soaked the wrappers to make them soft but they never ripped. Once I got the hang of wrapping the filling it was easy. I did use small wrappers and could only fit 1/12  of the filling in each, therefore ended up making 12 little bites. I also added some bean sprouts for extra crunch. Fantastic! Really scrumptous and so healthful. Not to mention one of the most fun recipes I have ever made!

Great recipe! 

Maesri spring roll sauce is ideal for fried and fresh spring rolls. 

Add a small bunch of fresh chopped mint leaves for extra flavor! 

Most fresh spring roll wrappers need only a quick rinse on both sides and set about 60 seconds. I find this worked well on this recipe, as soaking resulted in wrappers that were too flimsy and weak to roll.

I love the freshness of this dish, however I changed a few things.  I used mixed greens instead of regular lettuce which added great color to it.  I also maranated then steamed the shrimp.  The maranade is simple, I used lemon juice and garlic with a smidgin of olive oil.  I then took my steamer and steamed the raw shrimp till the shells were pink, around 5 min.   Instead of the dipping sauce which I wasn't fond of I used hoisen sause with crushed peanuts on top.  WAYYYY better.  Also for added spice I had a side of crushed chili sause.

Very yummy!  I'm Thai and I found this to taste similar to what my mother would make.  I made this with several different dipping sauces.  Always nice to have a salty, a sweet and a peanut sauce. I did cut each piece of shrimp into 3rds.

This sounds very simalar to the spring rolls I make. I use cellephane/bean thread noodles, mint and thai basil in mine. It makes them filling enough for a main course. I also prepare a couple of different kinds of meat like pork or chicken so people can make it to their taste. You could always leave out the meat or use tofu to make it vegetarian if you like. My family really enjoys sitting down to this 'hands on' meal!

These were great, just like my local Thai restaurant.  I bought the spring roll wrappers in Chinatown, so most of the packages weren't in English.  I did find one in English that said to put a damp cloth over the wrappers for 30 mins.  I did that, and it totally worked.  I used water to seal the edges and they came out beautifully.  Also, I used the satay peanut sauce as recommended by another reviewer.  Awesome!  I ate the sauce with a spoon!

Yummy!  They tasted just like I had ordered them at a Thai restaurant!  I made the rolls exactly as the recipe read.  Could not find mirin so I had to find a substitute online.  The sauce was pretty good.  We also had store bought peanut sauce which was very good on them.  All I can say is you have to be very careful with the wraps or they will tear.  You can do it though.  This was a good starter before serving Sukhothai Pad Thai & Thai Chicken Curry with Pineapple from this site.  TRY THIS RECIPE!!! AWESOME!

I'm going to say that this was just ok...I forgot to put in the lettuce and my cilantro went bad(in 2 days), so I used chopped scallions instead. I think I was expecting more...the texture of the spring roll wrapper was a little rubbery. I will try these again, maybe adjust the filling, add shitaki mushrooms. The dipping sauce was great and I also found a jar of Thai spicy chili sauce in my food store which was so yummy and spicy. Will give this another attempt.

I liked this recipe.  This is pretty much the ingredients of how I've had them.  I made them to specs so I could rate it the way it should be rated, which was fantastic. I too use mint leaves and thai basil. I added a picture of the wraps I use, they are vietnamese Tapioca sheets and only need to be immersed in water for a second before you can begin arranging your ingredients, by the time you are done arranging the ingredients, the wrap will be nice and pliable and shouldn't fall apart.  P.S., For those of you who RATE this and other recipes on a low scale, and totally make it different, you are doing a disservice to the rest of us.  Make it to specs, then rate it.  Thank You.

These were so fast and easy to make. Great for a quick, healthy dinner. I had a little trouble finding rice spring roll wrappers but did find them in the oriental food area of my Jewel Foods. I was surprised to see the raw wraps look like they last a long time. Mine were a bit too big and hard to eat. Cilantro makes these taste so fresh! I used store bought peanut and plum sauces.

I made these for a party last night -- what a hit!  I first arranged Cilantro and Basil on the wrapper, then used a good amount of cellophane noodles, then sauteed chicken strips, bean sprouts, lacy leaf lettuce.  For sauce I used a soy/ginger sauce, peanut butter, rice vinegar and a pinch of brown sugar.  I served this in a small bowl with a couple of spoons.  They were yummy!  The men, especially, liked them.  One man was still raving about them this morning to my husband.  They thought that I had bought them.  Suggestion:  I placed a small amount of the dipping sauce inside the wrapper before wrapping.  They were fun to make and super cheap.  Go to You Tube for more instructions.

This was a simple and delicious recipe. What I liked the most is its light enough for a mid day meal and its so easy you can use what ever you have on hand as I did. I used the rice paper rolls as I am gluten intolerant. I added basil (I didn't have cilantro) & I also added some left over crumbled chicken, spinach and in a few I used raw broccoli slaw. For the dipping sauce I used a mixture of store bought plum & garlic chili sauce. Definitely...Yummy!

Admittedly, I only used two elements of this recipe to combine with another: the cucumber and the sauce. Adding the cucumber to "Vietnamese Fresh Spring Rolls" was great, and the sauce was GREAT. yum yum!

These are good! Dont let the review from another reader confuse you. This recipe states the spring roll wrappers are available in asian markets. Yes there are 2 types cooked and rice wrappers. If its available in the market then its obvious you are not dealing with the ones you have to cook! Go for it! And the sauce is very good.

Made these for a New Years party and they went over well with kids and grown-ups alike. Cut back on the cilantro a bit because the first batch I made it was just too much for my taste. We filled some with chicken pan fried in curry spices and some with shrinp. Very yummy!

Very good recipe.  I love how healthy these are! I could not find the rice papers so I cooked rice noodles and served everything over the noodles kind of like a taco salad.  I served the dipping sauce on the side and people used it like a salad dressing.  Everyone loved it.  One thing I added was fresh mint with the cilantro.  A local thai restaurant serves their spring rolls with mint and I love the cilantro/mint combination in these.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, but these didn't turn out very good at all. The wrappers became very mushy and could barely hold the shrimp/veggie mixture inside. Also, the taste was extremely bland  overall.

i didn't have cucumber, so i just used carrots and lettuce and prawns. instead of cutting the carrots, i grated them with the big grater.

i also added a bit of japanese mayonnaise for flavor. and i didn't make the dipping sauce, i just used kikkoman soy sauce.

i'd make it again. it was easy to make and very yummy.

These are a good basis to tweak to your own taste.   We make some with shrimp and some without, but always like to use fresh lettuce, cucumber, carrot and herbs in them. We often use the round rice papers to wrap with.  We also like peanut sauce for dipping.

AWESOME!  First time trying to make something like this and it was a huge success.  I used cole slaw mix w/carrots instead of lettuce for more crunch and omitted the cilantro because I don't like it.  The best part was the sauces that I used, jarred sweet chili and the simple peanut sauce previously suggested.  I didn't care for the Thai sauce offered w/this recipe but my husband liked it best.  Will definitely make again!!

we made with crab and shrimp, used radish sprouts.  Only change - we matchsticked the carrots and cukes rather than julienne.  excellent.  served with hoisin peanut sauce and sweet chile sauce.. both great!!!

Great recipe that can be adapted to whatever you have and like.  I used carrots and cukes cut like matchsticks, baby shrimp, cilantro, peanuts and vermicilli noodles.  Easier to make than I thought and were a big hit.  Definitely will make these again.

This is awesome. Easy to make snack that is tasty and healthy.  To make this quicker for my kids I often buy a variety of season shrimp from my local seafood deli counter , such as thai flavor, lime marinated, and sweet/sour. This way the kids can just add the shrimpo of their choice for some variety. I also use marinated beef strips sometimes instead of shrimp. I highly recommend this recipe to anyone

These are really yummy and a great way to get kids to eat veggies..."it is fun to eat veggies all wrapped up" my kids tell me.  I haven't made the sauce yet that goes with these rather I've "cheated" and bought hoisin sauce.  I don’t like cilantro that much so I left it out.   I find less is more when it comes to filling and then rolling these up without ripping the wrapper.  I have made them ahead of time, covered them with a damp paper towel and they’ve tasted fine.

Very good.  I added a little soy sauce to the shrimp before cooking, and added sesame oil and chives to the sauce, mostly for visual appeal.

This were really good! I ate these in a restaurant and really wanted to make them on my own.  I added some thinly sliced green and yellow peppers and some julienne sliced scallions.  I would also recommend a shoot of baby asparagus in each.  For the sauce I would recommend using something different. Like a peanut sauce or a sweet and spicy crush red pepper sauce. Thanks!

This was my first time making spring rolls and trust me, it will NOT be my last!  These were so scrumptious, healthy, and fun to make.  I skipped the cilantro and added fresh basil and chives from my garden.  My rolling technique using the rice paper wrappers needs some practice, but that's OK.  I served these with a sweet & sour sauce and a peanut sauce.  I can't wait to make these using chicken too.  Excellent recipe, Molle888!

This recipe was EXACTLY what I was hoping to find.  I will be making this time and time again (next time I'll let the kids help)!  We served it with the easy sauce listed and also a peanut sauce that someone else listed in their review.  I'll repeat it here so others don't have to go searching: 2T Hoisin 2T Peanut Butter 1T Soy Sauce Stir together and slowly drizzle in water until smooth

Pat the wraps till damp before rolling, add sweet chili sauce, or peanut sauce to liven up.  Cilantro was an outstanding suggestion!

Make this recipe vegetarian by using boiled eggs instead of shrimp.  Slice eggs lengthwise into quarters.  Second Hint- as soon as the wrapper becomes bendable, take it out of the water and place on a damp working surface.  It will continue to soften.

Great concept but my rolling technique sucked. Make sure that you buy the thicker wrappers. I made the mistake of buying extra thin for some reason, & I ended up having to double them to prevent them from breaking apart.

These tasty spring rolls make a nice appetizer. I made my vegetarian (no shrimp) and added baby spinach then used a bottle of peanut dipping sauce that I already had instead of making this one. I will make these again.

This was a first for me making/trying fresh spring rolls, and we really enjoyed them! I used sprouts in place of the lettuce and baby shrimp. I also added some minced green onion for a little extra flavor. I did not make the dipping sauce listed b/c I used another recipe. All in all hubby and I enjoyed these and I would make them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Really enjoyed these as a light dinner after two weeks of heavy holiday eating. I added some chopped satay-seasoned chicken and some bean sprouts. I think you can sneak in a little of just about anything in these and they would be great. The "must" for me was the cilantro. That made it seem very fresh and very Thai. I did not use the dipping sauce. Instead I used some prepared Thai peanut sauce and also tried it with some Gyoza (potsticker soy) sauce I had on hand. I preferred the Gyoza sauce.  

I live in Michigan and found the spring roll wrappers at Meijer in the ethnic food aisle. The come in a round sealed plastic tray and are white and dry, like rice noodles. You will need to soak them... quite a bit different than the Chinese style wrappers you often find with the Asian fresh produce that require cooking. Once I got the hang of it they were easy to use. A little slimy and slippery at first but surprisingly strong. I'd have to practice a lot more to serve them at a party, but for me, they were fine. Watch that they don't touch each other. I found that they stuck together a bit.

The ingredients listed is what I normally use except cilantro though (hate them).  We like them basic but we don't shred the lettuce or chop the cucumbers. Instead, lay large pieces of lettuce, and thinly slice the cucumber. You don't want it falling off when you bite to it. Sometimes, we would also use a thinly sliced pork instead of shrimps. I used a different dipping sauce.

My family loves this recipe!  I cook the shrimp in a Court Boullion which imparts great flavor to the shrimp.  I also used the quick peanut sauce given by a previous reviewer.  I took a spoon of the sauce in this recipe and included it within the spring roll to add flavor and moisture.  Loved it.

I rated this 4 stars for an "almost there" recipe. I seasoned the shrimp with garlic powder, and topped the whole stuffing mixture with about a tblsp of lime juice, salt and pepper. This really compliments the cilantro and shrimp.  Also made 2 sauces as some suggested. 1. 2 tblsp Hoisin, 1 tblsp soy, and 2. same plus 2 tblsp peanut butter and water for consistency. Preferred the first sauce, though the hubby preferred the second.   Overall, will make this again and again.

I have always loved spring rolls and was so glad to find the recipe.  I also put mint in with the cilantro.  Sweet and Sour sauce is a great dipper, too.  We all loved them!  And so healthy, too!

Dipping the spring roll wrapper in warm water worked better for me.  I used hoisin sauce with crushed peanuts for a dipping sauce.

This was pretty good, but took a while to prepare.  I didn't really like th dipping sauce, so I used peanut sauce instead.

sorry - this did not work for me.  I thought I had made these once before, but it must have been a different recipe.  They were hard to roll tightly.  so they looked sloppy.  the wrapper became rubbery.  I will not make these again.

We liked these spring rolls. I couldn't find mirin at the store I went to so we used duck sauce instead. Since then I found mirin & next time I do this recipe, I will make the proper sauce to go with it.

These tasted really great and I liked the Thai dipping sauce too, it was just right.  The only problem that I had with this recipe was rolling the spring rolls.  I have trouble with rolling burritos too:)  Needless to say the last roll I made looked really good, but the ones before it did not look so good.  But hey, it still tasted good:)  Thanks for sharing your reicpe:)

This is a good basic summer roll recipe. They make a nice appetizer or side. I added Thai basil to mine, and bean sprouts, just because I like them. I made them without shrimp because I was serving a vegetarian. I found I wanted more lettuce than I had, and I had about two cups. Maybe my balance was just off. At any rate, this is a really good baseline recipe. I liked the dipping sauce.

I love this! So simple! I like the use of spring roll wrappers that I had laying around! *Sooo glad I can tell the difference between a spring roll wrapper and a wonton wrapper, no sloppy mess for me :D*

My first attempt at spring rolls and I wanted an easy recipe...which this is. I did adjust some things. I thought the recipe included rice so I made up just some easy instant rice before I realized it wasn't need. But I thought it was a good inclusion ( fills in the spaces). Also I used imitation crab instead of shrimp. I skipped the dipping sauce. Very yummy!

Made just the dipping sauce, and it was great served with flank steak or tofu over rice. I ran out of mirin, so for half the amount I used sake and added some brown sugar. I would use this dipping sauce for lots of Asian influenced dishes. Thanks!

Fabulous!  I cut the shrimp in half the long way and used 3 pieces (1.5 shrimp) per roll.  We dipped in hoisin, which I adore, but I've also made the dipping sauce listed here and it is delicious!  Thanks for posting!
