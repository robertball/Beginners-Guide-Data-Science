Instead of using prepared ranch dressing, I increased the amount of sour cream and used a homemade dry ranch dressing mix. I did not try this myself but my boys RAVED about it. It lasted about 15 minutes, then it was gone.

I baked chicken breast, adding hot sauce to them and a little Lawry's seasoning, cooled and shredded. This was a great way to get teenage boys to eat raw veges.  Very good dip, served with sugar snap peas, carrots and celery. Gone and requested for next "overnight".

This came out really greasy...we drained a lot of orange grease from the top before we ate it, after we ate it to put it away, and again when we reheated it and was still greasy. Maybe we used the wrong sauce...we used Sweet Baby Ray's buffalo wing sauce and it's the only thing we think the grease could have come from. Maybe we will try it again with a different sauce, but sure wouldn't make it again as we tried it.

So Good! My fiance and I have tried a recipe similar to this before and didn't care for the buffalo wing sauce so I used 1/4 cup of wing sauce and 1/4 cup of chipotle sauce and rotisserie chicken I had no trouble with it being greasy and it was delicious and had an awesome kick! Definately making this again!

Best buffalo chicken dip recipe yet!  I used the breast meat from a store bought fresh cooked rotisserie chicken.  I needed mine to be warm throughout a Super Bowl party so cooked it at 350 for 15 minutes and then put it in a little crockpot on "low" for the remainder of the afternoon.  Yum!!!

Turned out excellent! I didn't really measure the sour cream or ranch, just kind of eyeballed it.  Threw it all in my little crockpot.  Everyone enjoyed it!  Making it again this weekend, and maybe for the Superbowl also!

I use taco seasoning instead of hot sauce. I don't eat spicy foods, very good dip! I use sharp and medium cheddar cheese.

Very delicious and easy!  I made for a small get together and there wasn't hardly any left!  I used the Frank's Hot Sauce as suggested and had a great flavor for this dish.  I definitely recommend.

I make this all the time, just minus the sour cream (darned intolerance).  The only thing I do different is I buy the pre-cooked grilled chicken breast strips in 1 lb packages from Costco cause I'm lazy and just chop it up.
It is my 'go-to' dip recipe for gatherings or Football Sundays.  Everyone always loves it and asks for the recipe.

I had a reopen for this dip that I lost. This was very close. I used pepper jack and cheddar cheese and an absolute must is Frank's Red Hot   This gives it the best flavor. Make this all the time for any occasion or get together!  Everyone loves it. Never any leftovers. Thanks for helping me!

I had a 12.5 oz of canned chicken on hand, so I used that. Not as good a rotisserie or real chicken breast but still pretty good. I Mixed all the cheese in,...I had some shredded cheddar and 4 cheese Mexican. This all fit in a pie plate sized ceramic casserole.  I Took it to a party and received good reviews. I also used lighter cream cheese and sour cream to cut down on calories and fat.

I have made this twice. Loved it both times. Instead of chicken breast, I make a small chicken and shred that or by an already made chicken at the grocery store.

This is an amazing recipe! I made a couple of minor substitutes based on what I had at home, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Thanks so much for sharing such an easy, delicious buffalo chicken dip recipe! This is one of my new quick and easy appetizers to make for unexpected guests.

My grand daughter made this last night to take to a college class get together.  She used a rotissiere chicken and shredded it.  She put it in a crock pot on low for a while then warm over night.  She gave me a taste of it and I thought it was very good, looked up the recipe so I could make some of my own.

Turned out great. I didn't use all that cheese though just sprinkled some on top no grease like some reviewd stated. Very good

10-16-15 ~ Whipped this up for Bosses Day carry-in at work. It was very well received. I liked the extra creaminess that the sour cream added. I mixed it up on the stovetop and put in in my small crockpot, knowing we would munch on it all day. Served it with celery sticks and pita chips.

I make this in a crock pot. I used canned chicken which actually tastes better for some reason, everything else is the same, except no sour cream.  Also, Franks Buffalo Wing sauce. J made these adjustments through trial ad error!
