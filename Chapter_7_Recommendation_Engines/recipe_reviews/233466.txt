Tastes like summer in a glass. The cucumber really brings out the flavor of the gin. I like that itâ€™s refreshing without being overly sweet. Perfect summer evening cocktail!

This recipe is fresh, flavorful and will knock you on your  after three of them. You will especially enjoy this if you like Hendrick's with cucumber.
