Perfect breakfast banana bread. Awesome that it has no sugar! You can't quite taste the honey, but you for sure cannot taste white sugar. Super moist with a great texture too. I couldn't find Ultragrain flour so I used all purpose. My only other change was to leave out the nuts, since that's how my dad likes it. I am adding this to the recipe box :) Update: Made this into three mini loaves, took about 45 minutes to convect bake at 325.

This was great for a low-cholesterol recipe! I did add some more liquid to my batter because I know from experience how wet my banana bread needs to be to bake up great at my house. It wasn't very sweet, which is fine, but if you're looking for a quick bread with a cakelike feel, you should add more sugar or plan a cream cheese glaze. Thanks for sharing!

This was a surprisingly good bread.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a Wilton long loaf pan. The only addition/change was I added a little baking powder.  The bread is not overly sweet but nicely so.  Having extremely ripe (as in black) bananas is key.  Under ripe bananas are not as sweet.  Slices well and freezes just as good.  Will be making this again.

These were so yummy and quick to make. My kids love them so much I had to make another batch.

I am really surprised by this recipe. I've never made banana bread with honey and egg beaters before. It came out great! The only thing I changed was I added chocolate chips instead of the nuts. My family just don't eat nuts in their bread. Also, I used Pam coconut oil spray to spray down the pans. I love it for baking! I was really surprised when I found it at the store. I suggest trying it.

I love banana bread, and this was an awesome recipe for it.  I also adore Pam Spray, makes things so much easier in the kitchen!  I omitted the nuts because I didn't have any and Hubby doesn't like them.

This bread was wonderful. It was very moist and had a good banana flavor. I used slightly less honey because I did not realize I was out. It still turned out great and can't wait to make again! I did use 2 large eggs because I didn't have egg beaters on hand and spraying the pan with Pam made it pop right out of the pan.. I do know I will be making this again and again.

If you are looking for a banana bread that isn't too sweet this is the recipe for you. Many breads are simply too sweet but this one has a good ratio of sweet to balance with the banana. I did make the recipe with gluten free all purpose flour, xantham gum, a full teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 eggs instead of egg beaters.

Everyone LOVED this! It came out very moist with a wonderful banana flavor, but not too sweet, which is what I was looking for. Of course, spraying the pan w/ PAM(R), allowed for easy release! This was a nice, healthier version of banana bread that I will be making again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was the first banana nut bread that we liked.  Loved it because it was so moist, with no sugar but was made with honey.   I did not have egg beaters so I used 2 eggs.  The texture was wonderful and this is a keeper for us.

Very moist, worked well at high altitude. The bread did not sink like some banana breads at high altitude. I used a tsp. of  Butter Vanilla emulsion which added to the bread.  The bread took less time than the suggested time.  I didn't have any egg beaters, so I used 2 large eggs and for more flavor I added 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips. I checked the bread at 40 minutes and the bread was ready to take out of the oven.

I must say I am pleasantly surprised how good these turned out! I did not have High expectations knowing these were made with no sugar. All I can say is I am impressed!! These are Delicious! I agree they are not overly sweet  so make sure your bananas are really ripe! I chose to make muffins out of this recipe so with that being said they baked up beautifully I had no problems  with my muffins sticking thanks to using Pam no stick cooking spray! Worked wonderful!!!! These are full of banana flavor ,moist I love that they are not dense but surprisingly fluffy!! Delish!! Make these they honestly wont disappoint...

I did not think the bread had very much flavor. On a positive note, it has a nice texture and is very moist. It is not very sweet, but it also did not have enough banana flavor for me either (and I used 4 bananas instead of 3). My other issue is I thought it had too much of a flour taste, making it rather bland. I will say, that spraying some Pam on the cup that I poured the honey in was great--the honey slid out and did not leave the cup all sticky.

Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of baking in 3 mini-loaf pans for 35 minutes.  This had just the right amount of sweetness, was extremely moist, and simply loaded with banana flavor.  We watch our cholesterol, so using Egg Beaters® which meant 0mg cholesterol was definitely a plus for this recipe, and it was at no sacrifice to flavor or texture.

I am very surprised by this recipe.   I have made banana bread with honey before.   And usually the  honey is over powering.    Couldn't taste it in this bread.   

It came out very moist.   I don't like nuts in my bread so I omitted that.   But, I will def make this again!!

Excellent banana bread.  I did use real eggs but otherwise followed the recipe.  I tested at 60 min and it was still wet so I set for 10 more minutes, which was about 5 minutes too long.  The bottom is quite overdone but the top 3/4 is just right :)  I'd make this again.

I was looking for a healthier banana bread recipe, and this hit the spot!  I didn't use the egg beaters, or add the nuts, and it turned out fine!  I was so happy that it didn't have sugar in it and still tasted sweet and wonderful!
