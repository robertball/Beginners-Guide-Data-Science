This recipe is really QUICK and EASY. I followed LAWCT's procedure to change the recipe a little and the cookies came out real GREAT! This really is the best peanut butter cookie I've ever tasted yet. If u really like peanut butter u can actually add more. I used one cup of peanut butter (melted) and the flavor came out real good! And remember mix all the wet ingredients together before mixing in the cookie mix. This make the batter to be mixed more throughly and the taste would eventually comes out better. I also added one teaspoon of milk into the peanut butter before mixing in the cookie mix. I think that makes the peanut butter easier to mix well with the cookie mix.

There is not enough liquid to hold this batter together. My suggestion would be to increase the amount of peanut butter to 1 cup (softened in microwave for 1 minute 45 seconds) and to increase the butter to 5/8 Cup. Mix together the beaten egg the vanilla the peanut butter and the butter separately from the basic cookie mix before blending everything together. Baking time in my oven was only 11 minutes for the optimal cookie. With these adjustments my ratings are 5 cards in all categories.

After having bad results with all the varieties of the basic cookie mix I've altered the recipe for the peanut butter ones and they turned out really well. I doubled the basic mix (4 cups) used a little over 1/2 cup melted butter and one cup melted peanut butter along with 2 eggs and the reg. amount of vanilla. I rolled them into 2(?) inch balls moved the oven rack one above the middle position and reduced the oven temp to 325F. Cooked for about 13-14 mins. The turned out nice and fluffy and NO burnt edges!: )

I read two reviews that said with the additions that LAWCT suggested the cookies turned out perfectly. So I gave them a try. The dough looked and tasted as it should for peanut butter cookies but when I put them in the oven they just melted and never cooked up. So I'm not sure what went wrong but i feel it lacked a key component

I liked this recipe it has a very good taste. The dough was a little dry at first but after starting to roll it it became softer and stuck together nicely.

I've just started experimenting with the basic cookie mix. These cookies were so easy and came out perfect. I used my hoffritz cookie sheets and reduced the temp to 325. I baked them for 12 minutes. They were crisp and golden. I'll definitely make them again.:)

I agree with LAWCT's review. Cookies didn't hold together very well. Maybe I will try LAWCT's suggestions.

I agree with LAWCT. It needs more peanut butter and butter. Did not taste peanut buttery enough for me

They spread out big time and didn't get the nice brown color and slightly crumbly texture I like in pb cookies but they sure were easy and delicious!
