This was awesome. I marinated the meat for 24 hours. Instead of red pepper flakes I used 1 Tbl of Mongolian Fire Oil, which added a hint of fire but nothing you need a drink close by for. I also cooked half a white onion, half a red onion, 1/2 a cup of left over red bell pepper and some julienned carrots. Cooked the Onions and Peppers separately in a Tbl. Sesame oil and a Tbl. of Mongolian Fire oil (found in the Asian section of your local grocery) and a Tsp of minced garlic. I used sirloin instead cutting into thin strips. Mixed the Veggies back in at the end and then served it over Oven Brown Rice (found on this side). I have an excellent local Mongolian restaurant we love, sad to say I can now make it better, cheaper, and faster at home.  This dish is defiantly going into the dinner rotation!

Very very good.   I would make it again .   Works very well in the crock pot.   The beef comes out very tender and full of flavor.  My husband loved it and ask me to make it again real soon.

I've tried a few other Mongolian Beef recipes, but this is the best one so far! I used sirloin steak and reduced the garlic and definitely decreased the red pepper like the other reviewers said. I only used 1/2 tsp and it was perfect. This was so good and even got the approval of my husband! I will definitely be making this again!

I rarely rate recipes on here, but I have to say this one deserves it - with a few minor changes.  Definitely decrease the red pepper to 1 tsp.  (That's plenty) I marinate the meat always for 24 hours.  Lightly saute up veggies of your choice before adding the meat and it turns out to be a quick, easy, delicious every-day meal.  Thanks to the submitter - this will be a favorite in our picky home!

Absolutely delicious!  So flavorful!  I have had a hard time finding chinese food recipes that I like, and this is probably the best I've tried.  Only change was that I used 1 tsp. instead of 1 TBS of red pepper flakes... and it still had quite a bit of heat!!  Even hubby said there were some hot bites.  I cut some carrots from our garden into matchsticks and stir-fried those into the dish as well.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

VERY EASY, VERY GOOD. One thing I felt this was missing was a SAUCE to serve it with. Even without it, this is wonderful, but DEFINITELY TOO SALTY with regular soy sauce.  I wanted to try it as written, and I regret it now (and I'm certainly not afraid of salt).  Regarding the sauce, I suppose you could double the marinade, but I think it would be really REALLY salty. Use low sodium soy sauce as other suggested and this would be a 5 star.  I used flank steak / marinated for a day. VERY good. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a superb recipe for the wonderful flavors you get from such little effort.  I have made this recipe about 15 times or so.  I always add one tablespoon of peanut sauce (different from peanut oil) to the marinade.  Because flank steak has gotten so expensive by me, I usually use fajita meat, but the last time I cooked it I sprung for the flank steak, and it was worth the extra cost.  I usually make it with a side of white rice and teriyaki vegetables and mix it all together.  Great submission!

Doubled up on the marinade.  After draining from the meat I added some water and boiled to have a saucier dish.

This was really good! I used a flat iron steak, which is always so tender.  Instead of slicing the beef first, I marinated it, and then my husband grilled it.  Then I cut it up and sauteed it with the green onions and some of the marinade.  We served it with whole grain brown rice --it was really good! Will definitely make this one again.

you werent lying when you said super spicy!  wooooooooooooow was this hot lol.  its definitely full of flavor and ill be making it again but i think im going to cut the red pepper in half or 1/4 even.  i added carrots and broccoli to it and used a yellow onion instead of green.  really good dish but if your only mildly immune to hot food, cut the peppers dramatically.  and to the reviewer that said it was dry and needed more sauce, i dont know what you did wrong but there was plenty of sauce in the pan when i was done with it.

This was terrific and I didn't even get to marinate it long enough.  I did add shredded carrot because I'm always adding a veggie here and there.  Will make again very soon.

This was absolutely DELECTABLE!   I used thinly sliced tenderized pepper steaks. To curb the saltiness, I used low sodium soy sauce. I was afraid that this would be overly spicy as advertised, so I didn't add alot of red pepper flakes.  It was not spicy enough!! so next time, & OH YES THERE WILL BE A NEXT TIME, I will add all the flakes & maybe a little mongolian fire oil as well!  SIDE NOTE: I combined this beef with sesame noodles, also from this site, which was submitted by Scoopnana.  They went very well together.

This was delicious.....I only refrigerated the beef for an hour and then served it over egg noodles because I'm not a big rice fan.  I followed the recipe exactly as it says and it turned out as one of the best meals I've made yet in my young cooking career

I love this recipe. I always make extra marinade though. It is also important to choose a tender meat and not overcook it.

Excellent base recipe that you can tweak to whatever you may have on hand.  If you don't have time to marinade and want dinner in 10 minutes,  buy frozen asian veggies or pepper/onion mix & presliced stir fry beef.   First put minute brown rice in microwave.  Then stir fry the meat with chili oil/peanut oil mix.  Remove meat, then add frozen veggies.  Make the sauce ingredients, but add 1 tablespoon of beef base (better than bouillion is my fav) mixed with a 1/2 c water & 1 T flour) This gives it more flavor & is saucier asian gravy-like consistency.  Add back your meat, and you will have the remaining 2 minutes leftover to set the table.

We really enjoyed this one, especially Hubs - he loved it!!  I made it as written but used top sirloin instead of the flank steak, and only two cloves of garlic.  My only objection to this recipe is sautéing the green onions over high heat for 5-10 minutes and then adding the beef.  No way, the green onion would have disintegrated!  So, I sautéed the beef in two batches, adding the green onions towards the end of each batch.   I served this over jasmine rice.  A do again, for sure!

My husband thought it was amazing...  I thought it had a subtle taste of Chinese kitchen floor.  But I think that was the Hoisin sauce we used... either that or the mushrooms in the frozen oriental blend I added.  I don't like mushrooms, and although I didn't eat any, I suppose it could have flavored the rest of the meal.  Either way, it was best the first day and the taste of kitchen floor increased as it got older.

This is an easy recipe that I've made multiple times. It's a huge hit with the family. I omitted some of the red pepper flake (although I love it spicy) because the rest of the family isn't as big into spicy as myself. I either service this over a bed of Jasmine rice or a side of ramen noodles, both perfect.

AWESOME! I did follow this recipe right down to a tee except I added frozen broccoli. It was fantastic! The only thing I will chance next time is I will add at least 1/2 less red pepper flakes and maybe have some at dinner table for family to add as desired. We all LOVE super hot foods but this was so hot that is you took a breath while eating, it would cause you to cough and eyes would water. I am honestly wondering if it was meant to read as 2 teas. not Tablespoons. As for the review that stated they added double the peeper flakes....I think that would almost be humanly, next to impossible to do without a milk wash after each bite. And I can tolerate some intense heat! Thank You for the great recipe!

This is really good! I don't like spicy food so I didn't add any red pepper, and it still turned out really good. I added a can of La Choy Oriental vegetables and sauteed them with the green onions; I did not think this was too salty.

This is super easy and really good. I left out the red pepper flakes since we don't like super spicey. Other than leaving out the red pepper flakes, I followed the recipe exactly. Thank you for this wonderful  recipe...I am doing it again next week!

I used 1 tbsp. chili garlic paste in place of the minced garlic and cut back the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. Sprinkled on some toasted sesame seeds right at the end and served with white rice. It was way better than take out!

This was excellent!  Cut the red pepper flakes to 1 tsp because my son doesn't like too much spice.  Served with fried rice. YUM!

we have been eating this every other week for 3 months now. my 12 year old son would eat it every day, i think. I did cut down to 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes to make it family friendly. one time i doubled the recipe, froze half and thawed it in refrigerator before cooking as usual. worked great! sometimes i add sliced green and red peppers or broccoli. it always is good. thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This was so simple to throw together.  I put it in the fridge to marinade overnight, and then served it with veggie fried rice for dinner.  After reading the reviews about how spicy it was, I cut back the red pepper flakes to a teaspoon - next time I'm going to use the whole tablespoon because it was hardly spicy at all.  Thanks for a tasty and easy dinner!!

Super quick and tasted quite good.  Unfortunately I was out of peanut oil, so used some more sesame and did use sirloin as many other did.  Next time I'll add a bit more onion, and possibly some green pepper and/or let it marinade more than an hour.  Rating a 5 because right outta the gate this was really good and w/personal taste modifications can only get better.

Very good. I used sirloin steak (what I had on hand) cut down the red pepper flakes to 1 t (personal preference) & didn't use the green onions (didn't have any). I served with fried rice & Chinese vegetables.  For us this recipe makes only 2 servings, we eat 1/2 lb meat per person. Thanks.

Delicious Mongolian Beef! My distant ancestors were Mongols, so I should know, right? Right? I had to cut the hot peppers back by half for my Gringo dude, but it still had almost enough heat to please me. With the short ingredient list, I worried that flavor would be lacking, or that it would be one-dimensional. Not so. I used frozen bottom round steak that I shaved extra thin with a Chinese cleaver and marinated for an hour. The meat was as tender as a filet mignon. I'll make extra marinade next time and reserve it for a finishing sauce thickened with cornstarch. Take it from a Mongol, try it.

I followed the recipe verbatim, and all you could taste was the Hoisin sauce. You might be a fan of Hoisin sauce, but I find it very strong, and in this case too overpowering. I did not like the flavor of this sauce at all. Wasn't even close to spicy, and also wasn't sweet even considering the sugar added. There are better recipe's on here.

I thought it was great!  We love spicy, so the 1 Tbl red pepper flakes was great, but if you aren't all over spicy, then you should cut back on the dried red pepper.  I added veggies (thinly slices red, orange and yellow peppers and broccoli) to make it more of a meal.  I would add a little cornstarch the next time to thicken up the sauce a little.  I kept looking back at the recipe to see if I had missed it...

I'm baffled by the excellent ratings. Other than a little hotness (I used 1tbs of pepper flakes) this really didn't have any flavor at all.  Very disappointing and will not make again.

Very good recipe.  I will definitely make this one again.  My butcher didn't have beef flank steak or flat iron steak, so I used sirloin.  I used low sodium soy sauce and it turned out just right; I think it would have been a bit too salty for my husband had I used regular soy sauce.  I replaced the peanut oil with canola oil because it is what I have on hand and, taking the advice of the other reviewers, I reduced the amount of red pepper flakes by 1/3rd (I used 2 tsp -- a perfect amount if you love spicy but don't want to melt your face off).  I cooked the meat with the lid on the pan for most of the time, so there was plenty of juice left in the bottom when I was done.  I pulled the cooked meat from the pan, thickened the sauce up a little with some Wonder Flour and then tossed the meat along with some steamed matchstick carrots and broccoli florets to coat and served over white rice.  Fantastic!

This was just "OK" for us. Both my hubs & I agree that with several tweaks, this "could" be better. Having said that, I did make one substitution which I believe completely changed the outcome of tonight's dinner (yes, I partly ruined dinner...). Instead of flank steak, I used a 1 lb. pkg. of beef sliced specifically for stir-fry. This meat, although intended for stir-frying, wasn't sliced NEARLY thin enough. It quickly became tough, even after only 5 min. in a hot skillet. For this reason (and this recipe's potential to be improved upon), I'm awarding 4 *'s. My only other regrets are halving the amount of red pepper called for & not making an extra batch of sauce / marinade to cook my beef in (this is pretty dry as is). I wimped out when it came time to add the pepper. I just purchased a new bottle & feared it was going to be SUPER potent. In retrospect, another 1/2 T would have been spot on. One thing I "did" do right was add a sm., thinly sliced yellow onion along w/ my green onions (which we really liked & is how our local chain prepares their mongolian beef). I plan to make this again, but ONLY w/ flank steak, a FULL T of red pepper & a SEPARATE batch of sauce to "cook" everything in. Served over white rice, this was an allright meal. I think I'll try slow cooker mongolian beef b4 giving this a second whirl tho. Thanks anyways, Ang! :-)

We enjoyed this very much.  I marinated the meat overnight. I added the full tablespoon of red pepper flakes. Next time, I may cut that back a little even though we did like it spicy. I, also, used low sodium soy sauce. This is a great weeknight dish since it is so quick to prepare.

I probably shouldn't be reviewing this, because we really changed the recipe to fit what we had on hand. First, we used chicken instead of beef (which was really good, I reccomend doing the same thing if you don't have any beef). Second, we only used half the red pepper flakes and some ginger instead of the hoisin sauce. Didn't have any green onions either, so we used a mixture of vegetables. The flavor was really tasty and spicy (even with half the pepper), but everyone loved it! We'll gladly have this again, and I'd like to try it with more of the actual ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!

My hubby and I loved this! I didn't change the recipe at all. Used the full 1tbspn of red pepper flakes and it was fine for us but we like spicy food. Also sprung for flank steak which was totally worth the extra few bucks. Sauteed carrots, celery and red bell pepper in the same pan then took it out and sauteed the beef with the extra marinating juices (marinated meat for 2-3hours which was sufficient). Served over white rice. Sooo good! Will definitely be making this again.

We tried this several times, first by following the recipes exactly as written and then again with a couple of tweaks. Both times it tasted more like peppersteak instead of mongolian beef.

I was looking for a recipe that tastes like the Mongolian Beef at the restaurants near me. This recipe is definitely not it. 

This recipe is good, but not great. I added a 5 green onions, a 1/2 onion sliced, a teaspoon of ginger, and only 1/2 tablespoon red pepper flakes. Even with the additions, the flavor was still lacking. Aside from being spicy, this dish doesn't really have much going for it. My search continues.

VERY good!  My family loves flavor and this delivered!  They don't like rice so I am always trying to find something to pair this with.
Too bad, they'll have to suffer and go without!  It's all for me!

5 stars.  I used 1 tsp of pepper flakes and it was medium heat.  I marinated for about 4 hours.  I topped it on jasmine rice.  I also steamed broccoli then added it to the cooked marinade for flavor.

This recipe was great. I halfed the amount of red pepper flakes as one of my dinner guests is not a big fan of spicy foods. That made it just mild enough for her to eat and spicy enough for us to have a little bit of heat.

We did this in a bit of a hurry, so I wasn't able to marinate for a full hour. I sped things up by coating the meat well with the marinade and running it through my vacuum marinator.

Served this over some home made fried rice and it was great. I made a double portion and all of it was gone. Will definitely have to make this again.

This is a ten star in my book! Wonderful flavor and great heat. I doubled the sauce and left out the onions. I marinated for two days. Wow! Served with fried rice and baked broccoli and red peppers drizzled with a little evoo, salt and pepper. One of my favorites from this site.

This recipe was very good; I substituted beef tenderloin, thinly sliced, and added carrot, snap peas and a bit of sliced cabbage.  I like spicy food so I also added a few teaspoons of sriracha hot chili sauce.  Yum!

I have made this recipe several times.  I love it.  The only thing that I have changed over the last few times is that instead of peanut oil, I use canola (I don't like peanut oil).  I also make double the marinade so that there is more sauce for rice.  I usually saute onions and peppers in a different pan, but next time will try to add to the same pan and try some julienned carrots as well.

Served on rice that had carrots and peas in it. 

Changes: 
*did not use sesame oil
*used olive oil instead of peanut oil
*purchases meat cut up that is used for stir fry
*only used 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes

My husband and son like spicy things but even the 2 teaspoons I but in had them saying they were glad I did not not add more. 

Next time I might use chicken to make this healthier.

This recipe is outstanding!  I've made it with thinly sliced flat iron steak, pork tenderloin and chicken with great success.  Even one teaspoon of the red pepper flakes is a bit much for us, so I usually just put a pinch in.  I also use more onions (both green and sliced white onion) and because we serve it all on either rice or rice noodles, I like to either double (or sometimes triple) the sauce and I usually add some carrots and some sliced yellow onions as well.

Excellent dish. I added green onions towards the end of cooking as they wilt easily. I didn't have peanut oil but everything else I did have and use. Even the BF who is not a huge spicy fan...he only will eat spicy food if the food itself tastes really good and he ate all of this! :) Excellent recipe! Thanks!

This was great! I just bought a package of pre-sliced beef for stir-frying from the store to make it easier. Since I didn't have peanut oil, I just used olive oil to cook it in. I served it over brown rice.

I don't know what happened, it mostly just tasted like soy sauce... The sauce wasn't thick at all (I guess it doesn't have any ingredients that would thicken it), and to me, it mostly just tasted like soy sauce.  I would much rather make Korean beef with the beef and the ingredients.

I thought this was just ok. My husband loved it though. I also added green pepper and white onion along with the green onion. Though it had plenty of sauce at the end. Also made white rice with it.

Yummy! I only used half a pound of beef and used all the other ingredients with the same specifications used for a whole pound (except I cut the red pepper flakes to 1/2 and used olive oil instead of the sesame & peanut, totaling only 1.5 tbsp [1 tbsp for marinade & 1/2 tbsp for sauteeing the green onions]).  I think if I would have used the same amount of sauce for a pound of meat, it would not have been enough flavor.   The flavor is amazing for 1/2 lb!! WILL MAKE AGAIN!!

we LOVED this and so did both of my kids ages 11 and 5. I doubled the recipe and did half soy sauce and half fish sauce (bought from an Asian supermarket). Since I was doubling I only added one tablespoon of the red pepper flakes, but just because my kids were eating it too. Next time they are not here for dinner I will add the second tablespoon for more of a kick, but we love spicy. I also was only able to marinade for about an hour and it still had great flavor. This is so simple and so delicious that I can't wait for left overs today!

Not bad!  I didn't have a wok so I used a skillet.  The beef came out pretty well but next time I think I night put it under the broiler.  I marinated my meat for about 10 hours.  Will be making this again.  Thank you!

I used flat iron steak (still frozen) cut in thin strips & put it in crock pot with the mixed up sauce minus the oil and green onions and cooked on low for 7 hours.  I also reduced the red pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon for a toned-down version.  Served with stir fried veggies cooked in another serving of the sauce and fried rice.  Pretty good meal that will be added to ou rotation.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'd give this five stars for super simplicity and three for the lack of super spiciness...it really didn't have a punch of flavor liked I'd hoped. We added red pepper flakes *after* it was cooked to punch it up a bit. I think that next time I'll add some ginger *and* more pepper. I used the same marinade on tofu for my daughter and served it all with fried rice and roasted broccoli. Overall we enjoyed it and with changes, will definitely make it again. Thanks!

I guess I'm just used to the Chinese restaurant version of Mongolian beef...a thick sauce and a little more on the sweet side. Upon making this it really didn't resemble that Mongolian beef I knew at all. I altered it by adding about 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a tablespoon or two of flour to thicken up the sauce. That worked wonderfully. Add some siracha sauce to that and BAM---spicy!

This was pretty good and I followed the recipe including crushed red pepper. Even with all that spice it was actually a little sweet for my taste after a few bites, but still pretty good.

This recipe is awesome as is. But I must say, I've made this many times now and I think I've perfected it. I've used many cuts of meat but if you're making this for company, I'd go with sirloin. I also let it marinate for up to 3 days. I add thinly sliced red, yellow and green bell peppers. I also add a hand full of Chinese peas (cut off the nasty tips). Cook these veggies in 1 T olive (or sesame) oil on medium high heat until tender but still crisp. Do not over cook theses. A little crunch is good. Then add the meat and green onion. Mix together.   I serve this with Jasmine rice and Asian Cucumber Salad found on Relishmag.com. This salad is best after several days marinating! I also serve the meal with Bangkok Padang Peanut sauce for dipping. It's to-die-for! The flavors literally explode in your mouth! I buy the peanut sauce at my local Albertsons.  The salad and dipping sauce are both  essential and makes this meal an experience you'll want to repeat over and over again. And with so much of it you can make ahead of time, it's an easy dish for entertaining. Enjoy. And thanks Ang for the recipe!

I took the advice of everyone and didn't add as much soy sauce or red pepper flakes but it still was very spicy. The sauce was too runny for me. I like thick sauce and was kind of flavorless for me. I will make again, but first tweek it a little bit. Also, finding meat sliced thin like that is hard, so I didn't end up using that kind, but I will for sure ask the guy at the meat counter next time because that would help out this dish a lot for me.

With a few changes, I believe that this recipe is a 5.  I did cut the pepper as most did, doubled the marinade recipe and added a a bag of frozen veggies to cook with rice at the end.  There was none left!  Even my mom went back for seconds!  (that never happens).  Simple and very tasty recipe.  Thanks!!

This was an amazing recipe.  It was so easy and simple to make and the flavor was all there.  I'm definitely happy that I used the whole tbs of red pepper flakes as it was just enough kick for me (a little too much for my husband though).  Will make again and again.

Very good. I like things spicy so I used about 3 tbl of red pepper and used red chili oil instead of peanut oil. I also added carrots since I didn't have enough green onions on hand. I will definitely make again.

I was really looking forward to eating this based on all the rave reviews, but once I did I could not figure out what the big deal was. It was okay. My husband said, "Not the one of my favorites to come out of your kitchen, will not wait to have this again".

THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING!!! I found it online just last week and have already made it twice. My two roommates each substituted the beef with chicken and shrimp and it turned out equally as good. We also used the remaining sauce to coat pan fried noodles and served the protein on top. It made for an amazing meal!!!

I made this recipe as written with the exception cutting back on the pepper flake. I used 1 teaspoon. I served it on a bed of brown rice. My wife and I both enjoy spicy food and thought this recipe was by far better than the Mongolian Beef recipes we have tried in the past. I will definitely make this again

I honestly wasn't expecting much with these 5 ingredients but I've made this at least 5 times minimum without changing an ingredient. It's quick , cheap and simple.

This was okay. I love spicy food and the spice level was all I loved about this recipe. I made exactly as directed. It wasn't horrible but I just wasn't impressed.

I think the dish is absolutely amazing, but I double everything for my family (including the meat). We don't fear the heat, so I think it is wonderful as it is with the amount of red pepper flakes. I make Thai noodles to mix in with this, which are also a little hot.

We thought this was really good.  I wanted it to be a little saucier, so I doubled the marinade and put half in a separate bowl and added a couple tablespoons of cornstarch.  I used chuck roast for the meat and marinated for about 4 hours.  It was really tender.  After cooking the meat over high heat (dumped the meat and marinade all in the pan), I reduced the fire and added snow peas and cooked for several minutes until tender-crisp.  I then added the extra "marinade" that I had mixed with the cornstarch and it thicken really nicely.  I did reduce the red pepper flakes to about 1 tsp.  Was nicely spiced, but of course that all depends on personal taste.. Served with Thai Pad noodles.  Hubby said it was better than our local Chinese restaurant.  Will definitely make this again.

My family loves this!  Make it often!  I've tried to use sirloin steak to economize, however, it will not be as good if you don't use Flank Steak.  Also, I always make it the night before to marinate and double the recipe for the sauce.  Even though sesame seeds are not in the recipe, they are in the picture so I sprinkle on top.  I do 1/2 the red pepper flakes due to the spicy tolerance of my family.  We have served over jasmine or brown rice.  This is really really good and the house smells great!

Great recipe.  I have made this numerous times for family and guests.   It is easy and delicious and I'm pretty sure I have never even marinated it for an hour, much less 24. Regardless, everybody loves it.  I have chopped up broccoli and carrots and stir fried them before the meat.  I remove them and then cook the meat.  I add in the broccoli mix when serving.  I've also been lazy and just stir fried a bag of broccoli slaw.  This is a very tasty recipe.

I thought this was good...and nice and easy to make. I used sirloin steak instead of flank, yellow onion instead of green, added carrots, and dramatically cut back on the red pepper flakes.  My only complaint is that, like other reviewers have also mentioned, I found this dish a bit too salty.  I would make this again, but only with a low sodium soy sauce.

We loved this! It was really good. I did make a couple of changes just based on what I had and didn't have - but I want to say that this recipe, as written, is perfection (with the exception of the 1 T of red pepper flakes - 1 teaspoon is PLENTY). I used 3 T dark soy sauce and 1 T light soy sauce, but I don't think it would have been too salty to use all dark soy sauce (for our tastes, anyway). I thinly sliced the white part of the green onions and added it to the marinade. I left out the green parts because my green parts looked awful :( I added some minced fresh ginger. I used about a teaspoon of chili paste and 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes. Finally, I very thinly sliced carrots (into matchsticks) and 1/2 of a white onion. I put 1 T of the marinade in with those veggies, separately from the meat, and cooked them first before adding the meat. I added sesame seeds in the last minute of cooking. Will definitely be making again!

This recipe was amazing! I doubled it and used sirloin steak marinated for a little over 24 hours. I made extra sauce and added red and green bell peppers. It was so full of flavor! Also used chile paste and Szechuan stir fry sauce for more heat and flavor. Better than any Mongolian beef I've had and the bf LOVED it. Will make this easy delicious recipe again super soon!  Thanks Ang!

Great recipe.  one thing we added was two table  spoons of corn starch before mixing the meat and sauce. This way the sauce thickens and stays coated on the meat when cooked. It also helps crisp up the meat,  Brown it.

"EVERYONE LOVES IT!!" was my husbands report.  I used London Broil as it was cheaper, scored the beef and marinated for 8 hours.  Cooked on grill, delicious!!!  We boiled the marinade to serve on the side.  Truly wonderful, yummy dish.  We did not decrease red pepper, actually increased it.  I didn't have hoisin so I used garlic chili sauce and some molasses.  I had it cooked on the grill cause I prepped but the husband cooked it while I was at work.

Wow!  Really good.  I doubled recipe but only added 1 tsp. red pepper flakes for the whole batch and that was plenty spicy for me.  Also used top sirloin instead of flank steak because that's what was in the freezer.  It was a hit and I will make again for sure. Yummo!

My husband and I made this dish on Valentine's Day and it was delicious. I even made more last night, and it came out better than the night before. The longer you leave it to marinate, the better it tastes. I will continue to use this recipe, thanks for the idea!!!

The sauce for this was REALLY tasty.  For me, it falls shy of a 5-star recipe just because in my opinion, Mongolian Beef should have WAY more green onions.  We used about a dozen, and I still would be tempted to use more next time.

This is a wonderful recipe that I make often.  I prepare everything about 6 hours before cooking and let it marinate.  I also add broccoli, water chestnuts and a little extra garlic.  I cook the broccoli in a hot wok with  a little peanut oil just until bright green. I remove the broccoli and put it in a bowl off to the side. Then I cook the meat with the marinade until well done.  It seems to tenderize the meat better.  I add the broccoli back to the wok after the meat is done  and then toss in some sliced water chestnuts and the green onion right at the end. Then just  heat through and serve over rice. 
The veggies will be crisp and the meat is so tender.  My family loves this recipe!

This is fantastic!  I only used 1 tsp. red pepper flake, since little ones were eating it.  (I wouldn't have minded more, but I love heat.)  I also doubled the sauce.  I used half to marinate the meat for 4 hours and added the other half at the end of cooking to warm through.  I served it over rice with veggies.  A huge hit; I wish I had leftovers!

Hello, this truly is super easy and super yummy!! We love spice, but just incase, I took the advise of the other reviewers and decreased the pepper flakes to about a tsp. Next time, I will add a bit more. I also didn't have green onions, so I sauteed some red bell peppers & some water chestnuts. I didn't have peanut oil either, so I just used olive oil. Wow, thanks for this recipe and for giving me the confidence to cook with steak! I can't wait to make this again!!

VERY GOOD!!  My husband says it is a keeper!!  The only thing I did differently was I cut the red pepper flakes back and only used 1 TEASPOON as we were having a side dish that had a lot of spice in it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I have this saved and have been making it exactly as-is for a couple years now, with just slightly less red pepper flakes than it calls for. It's my picky step-daughter's favorite and she always requests it! Even my 5 year old loves it!

We really like this.  I make it milder than written because we have 2 toddlers.  I add lots of thinly sliced red onions and carrots to make it more like our favorite restaurant dish.  I also make a little extra sauce so there is plenty for all those veggies!

So easy and soooo good! I recommend putting red pepper flakes on afterwards, my husband loved how spicy it was but a bit too spicy for me.

Added minced ginger, sake and julienned carrots. I substituted sesame oil for the peanut oil, splenda for the sugar, and a red thai chile (minus the seeds) for the chili flakes. Absolutely delicious, and will definitely be making this again!

I loved this dish.  It tastes just like what I get at my favorite chinese restaurant and it is super easy to make.  My 13 year old son on the other hand said it had a weird aftertaste like melted plastic.  Not sure about his taste buds... maybe he is more taste sensitive to some flavor profile that I can't taste.  I would eat this once a week if I could.

Made the recipe exactly as followed - while there was a slight zing to it, it really wasn't spicy at all.  Maybe I did something wrong.  Also the sauce was a bit watery - that's not to say this wasn't delicious.  It was VERY flavorful and tender beef and made an excellent dish over right.  I may throw in some corn starch or something to thicken up the sauce, and maybe add a red chili or two to really spice things up.  Overall, it was quite good.

This recipe is great and if you don't have peanut oil use the same amount of chunky peanut butter it doesn't change the flavor and it adds a little something extra. Company loved it and I will make again.

This was VERY good.. I added an almond and raisin rice stir-fry for the bed. It was fantastic. I'm glad it said SUPER hot.. because i shied from my usual addition of cyan or curry powder. And it was just hot enough to add kick, but mild enough for the entire family to enjoy. Thumbs up here.

After about 3 years on this site, this is the first recipe I've cared enough about to review.  Sure, I've had some success with a number of them, but this one is stellar!  My only changes: used a little less than 3/4 lb beef, added about 2 cups veggies, then at the end, some corn starch mixed in water to thicken up the sauce.  

I'm not the biggest fan of spiciness, but the kick in this dish was far from excessive.  Those who can't handle the one Tbsp of chili flakes must be REALLY wimpy.  Haaa.

Excellent recipe! Used a London Broil instead of flank steak, doubled the sauce, and added yellow onion. Served it over brown rice. Can't wait to have more for lunch tomorrow.

This was fine, just nothing spectacular for us.  I marinated the meat for 24 hours, then grilled it on our GF grill and boiled the leftover marinade on the stovetop with some fresh broccoli and carrots.  Served over brown rice.

Great!  I used 1.5 tablespoons red pepper flakes and marinated for 1.5 hours.  We got a nice warmth, not enough to burn your mouth.  next time i'll try marinating overnight for a little more heat.  if that doesn't do it, i'll bump up the flakes to 1.75 tablespoons.  I cooked the beef and marinade, removed the beef and add matchstick carrots, sliced red peppers, onions, and mushrooms to the pan.  When they were cooked, i returned the meat to the pan and cooked until everything was heated through.  Served it over white rice and got rave reviews!  Definitely a keeper!

This is one of the best recipes I've found on AR.  The grocery store I shop at does not carry flank steak so I used a thinly-sliced eye of round cut.  I only marinated this for 30-45 minutes and it was very good.  I had it with lemon pepper broccoli and rice.  Thank you!

Wonderful recipe. I cut the crushed red peppers in half too. If you REALLY want a treat, add more garlic, leave out the scallions and put the meat over julienned green apples. Have a similiar version of this at an Asian Fusion restaurant I often go to. OMG!!!

Very good!! A little on the salty side, even using low sodium soy sauce. I did decrease the amount of red peppers to about 1 tsp and it was enough for me.

Super-simple and spicy is correct. I used the same measurements as indicated here, even though I became worried when everyone said they cut the garlic and red pepper down. (I never cut garlic down; that's silly :)) Anyway, I followed this recipe and added a bit of brown sugar to the marinade and it is awesome! The red pepper is not overpowering and may put a little sweat on your brow, but I like it like that. Made this for my friend and he agreed that it was the right amount of spice and loved it.

Absolutely loved it!! So much that this is my first time to write a review.  I followed the person who only added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and used chicken instead of beef.  It was great! Husband loves it and father-in-law said it was the best he had eaten in a while.  I also made a second portion of marinade minus the red pepper flakes as a sauce and added it with linguine noodles (already cooked) and the green onions to the chicken after it was done making it into a one dish meal.

This is a fantastic recipe! I was nervous after a recent Asian cooking disaster, but my boyfriend and his roommates LOVED it; said it was the best Mongolian beef they'd ever had. By request, I've made it 3 times in the last week and half. Used about a teaspoon and a half of ground red pepper in place of the red pepper flakes after reading the "too spicy" reviews, and it turned out just fine. Some reviewers mentioned not having enough sauce. I've found if you prepare the dish according to the recipe there is enough  sauce, BUT if you add extra veggies (I like to add snow peas, carrots, onion) doubling the sauce is a good idea - or if you just like a lot of sauce with your rice!  Thanks for the quick, easy recipe!

I do agree this was a simple recipe.  I love spicy food. That said, I cut down on the amount of pepper flakes and this dish was so terribly hot that neither myself nor my husband could really enjoy our meal. I'm wondering if this is a misprint and should be 1 TEASPOON of pepper flakes instead of 1 TBSP.  My lips are on fire and I drank 2 beers with one plate of this beef.  (I might drink one beer with spicy wings.)  I plan to make this again, using only 1 tsp or less of the pepper flakes.

This recipe is okay.  Not my favorite style I guess.  The marinade smelt so good.  I marinaded the meat over night and when I cooked it, it just wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be.  Also, I made a slight amount of extra sauce in order to have some sauce leftover, but the sauce does not thicken, I added some cornstarch and thickened it up a bit.

I used this recipe with cube steak because that is all I had at home. I cut it into chunks so the cooking method had to change a little. But I used your recipe, just added some yellow onion to and added the green onions the last couple mins. It tasted really good.  Thanks!

My family loved this, but I was disappointed for some reason.  I used only 1/3 of the sugar (because I also made honey walnut shrimp from this site and did not want 2 sweet dishes) - don't know if that made a difference.  I thought that it was too salty and lacked something.  I also think I would prefer a more thicker sauce...maybe adding some corn starch would help in that area.  I would not make this again.  But the preparation was super easy.

The whole family loved this dish. I would recommend using the 1/2 salt soy sauce, it was a bit salty. Also, I added a bag of frozen mixed Chinese vegetables just before it was finished cooking. This one is going on regular rotation.

I doubled this recipe, and substituted sirloin for the flank steak. My family loved it.  We served it over brown rice.  The next time I make it, tho, I will only add 1 Tbsp. of the red pepper flakes instead of 2, as it was a little too spicy for our liking.  This is a very easy and quick dinner.  Good for someone who wants to save $ on takeout or impress their guests.

This was really good! I love spicy food so it was perfect for me. I didn't get to marinate the meat overnight but it was still good, I think it will be even better next time when I marinate it. I added some white onion and green bell pepper to it and it was so yummy! Thanks for the great recipe.

I give this 4 stars because I definitely want to try it again, but need to use MUCH less red pepper flakes.  I used one reviewers advice and put it all in the crock pot - just needed something ready when I came home.  It worked much better than I expected in there.  I also used another person's recommendation and doubled the sauce to ensure there was enough.  I used only half the red pepper flakes, but need to use much more.  From what I can tell, the overall taste was good, I just couldn't tell very well!!  Next time - I'd do everything the same with just a pinch of red pepper flakes.

This recipe was so good!  I scored the flank steak before marinating it then seared it on the grill (didn't cook it on the grill, just seared it) and then cooked as the recipe states.  I made an extra batch of the marinade and poured it in the pan after all was cooked as my husband likes his Mongolian Beef with a bit more sauce to it.

Tried this recipe last night. It's very good. The only thing, I would probably lessen the soy sauce a bit next time. It's a little too salty for my taste...or maybe it's just the kind of soy sauce i used. I recommend trying the recipe as is for the first time and go from there.  I added a carrot, sliced in thin strips for added color.

LOVE IT!!! My fiance's absolute favorite dish. We thrive off spicy foods. We add spice to everything!! So of course I added extra red pepper to the recipe, was not extraordinarly hot prior so added an extra 1/2 tblespn, doubled the marinade to use as sauce over the rice. And added zuchinni, carrots, mushrooms. Was FANTASTIC!!!

Wow!  This was so good!!!!  I doubled the sauce....you will be very glad you did. Used really nice sirloin that I had the butcher slice super thin. Safeway is really good about doing that.  Added diced carrots, green onions and one small hot red pepper to the marinade but took it out before cooking so an unsuspecting husband who is a wus about hot stuff wouldn't find it.  Served with rice, added rice vermicelli (which is served with Mongolian beef in Chinese restaurants) and topped with the meat.  My husband, who always refuses to try Mongolian Beef when I order it, LOVED it.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

We loved this recipe.  We added a half of a bag of shredded carrots and stir-fried in olive oil (allergic to peanut) -- but otherwise, followed the recipe.  Yummy!
Hubby likes it better than the local chinese restaurant's version.

I had always made another recipe for Mongolian Beef but when I found this I thought I'd give it a try.  My husband loves it.  I increase the red pepper as we like spicy food but other than that - take it like it is because it's delish!!  I serve it over jasmine rice.

This was easy and quick -- just want I need!  I substituted chopped red onion for the green onions since that was all I had.  I didn't have peanut oil, so I used vegetable instead.  The tablespoon of red pepper flakes was a bit too hot for us, so I will try it with half to 3/4 of the amount.

This dish is fantastic!!!!  I added frozen Chinese vegetables and served it over whole wheat angel hair pasta.  Hubby and I practically licked our plates clean.  (FYI--I only added a teaspoon of the red pepper flakes as others had suggested.  I'd try it this way first, and if you like it hotter, add more the next time you make it.  We like things hot, and this was perfect.)  Thanks!!!!

This was very good.  I marinated the meat for 24 hours.  I used 1 tsp of red pepper instead of 1 Tablespoon, which was perfect for the whole family.  I also cooked up some matchstick carrots like another reviewer suggested. I did not use flank steak, I used sirloin instead.  When cut thin, it does not need to cook long and remains quite tender.

I make this recipe for everyone.  I do however make 4 times the sauce and buy 2 plus pounds of flank steak.  We save 1/2 the marinade to pour over rice and steak when finished to give it a lot more flavor.  I don't add 4 x's the garlic or red pepper flakes though otherwise it gets way too spicy.

I had no hoisin sauce, so added tbsp of mirin, 2 tsp peanut butter, additional tbsp roasted sesame oil. The heat was just right, though next time I will use low sodium soy sauce. It was a little too salty.

It was really good. A little to spicy for me. But my husband loved it. Recipe calls for 1 T of crushed red pepper. I put 1 instead. Next time I will use less. I didn't marinate overnight, just did it for a couple of hours.

It is our go-to-meal when we are short on time.  We keep in the freezer on sale rib-eyes or new York strips.  Slice them frozen and put in the marinade.  When defrosted toss in the pan.

I followed the recipe except I cut the pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp knowing that 1tablespoon would be way to much for us. Very good flavor and easy too. I will certainly make it again.

Will definitely make again.  Whole family devoured it.  I didn't use non-stick pan and I didn't have any trouble with sticking. 
 In fact my biggest problem was the amount of liquid in the pan, even though I drained the marinade off.  It was still excellent though.  Reduced the red pepper flakes by half.  I also sprinkled a few toasted sesame seeds on at the end.  Recommend serving with rice or quinoa.

This tastes amazing!!! Had to stop myself from eating all 4 servings myself. Made a few adjustments to the recipe. I used hot Chile sesame oil for added heat. I used low sodium soy sauce because this dish can be very salty. I tossed the beef in cornstarch before adding to the pan then added a little water and soy sauce so there was a little sauce to pour over the rice.

Thank goodness I tasted the marinade before wasting good beef! Way too much sesame oil! This recipe isn't even a good start to be worth tweaking. Do no make it! I can't understand all the good reviews, unless some serious changes were made.

Wow!  Even my 12 year old liked it (though he has a decent tolerance for spiciness).

Made this tonight and it was perfect except for my overcooking the broccoli I added.  I agree with others that you could easily double the sauce if serving over rice.  The flank steak was like butter after marinating overnight.   A keeper in this household.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I usually marinade the meat the night before for a quick after-work meal the next day. It’s great with pork as well as beef. I follow the recipe closely, although I just do a few sprinkles of the red pepper flakes. Great with broccoli and mushrooms.

This was SO good, I can't wait to make this again! I did use a different cut of meat, top sirloin, thinly sliced instead of flank steak (because that's what I had on hand). I also doubled the amount of green onions because we love those! I served over Jasmine rice and husband loved it too. This is a keeper, thanks for sharing!

I substituted coconut aminos for soy sauce and it turned out amazing. It did create a lot of sauce in the pan so I used some arrowroot powder to thicken. This will be a regular meal in the rotation.

We loved this! Out of the blue my husband asked me to make Mongolian beef, which I had never done, so I did a search and chose this one. It was delicious!! The only change I made was to reduce the pepper flakes to just a very small sprinkle, and I marinated it for two days. I have made this three times now and plan to make it again soon.

Delish! I sautéed onions, red peppers and broccoli in hot oil, removed from skillet to a covered bowl then cooked the meat. (I will double the marinade next time) Cook just the meat to get it nicely caramelized then add the marinade and bring to a simmer and add some cornstarch to thicken. Serve over jasmine rice!

Both hubby and I love this recipe! Although this recipe is excellent the way it is. We especially love the sauce and make extra. 
I increased the sauce by 50% and made it thicker.  After marinating the beef I reserved the sauce until the beef and onions were done.  Then I removed the beef and onions from the pan.  I added the reserved sauce to the pan and heated it on high, then added 1 TBS of flour, stirring until thickened.  I also used 1/2 the red pepper and added some white onion.

I only used 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and replaced the peanut oil with sesame oil, since my wife has a peanut allergy.  It turned out great!  Could barely taste the heat, so will bump up to 2 teaspoons next time...the tablespoon the recipe calls for makes me a bit nervous, so I'll work up to that :)

This was absolutely delicious!! I did switch a few things. I added half the normal sesame oil it called for, and for the other half used Mongolian Fire oil, as another reviewer mentioned. I also used some worcestershire sauce and ended up only adding a sprinkle of crushed red peppers and a few squirts of sriracha sauce, since I had kids eating it too and it was the perfect heat, not hot at all but a little zip, and lots of flavor. I did end up accidently using 2 tablespoons extra of the hoisin sauce but it still tasted good! If the marinade is too thin, you can thicken it with some cornstarch before you mix the meat and sauce together. Ive served it over rice noodles and rice and the whole family loved it and went back for seconds. I will definitely be making this more!!

I make this a lot. Sometimes I sear the meat in a pan and then throw everything in a crock pot for a more tender steak. Other times I cook it as directed. Either way is good.

This was a  pretty tasty dish. It is spicy though so if u don't like spice turn down the red pepper. I like spice so it didn't bother me. My only complaint was that I wanted it to be a little sweeter.  But that's easy to fix.

So good! I did reduce the red pepper flakes somewhat for my son. He's not as enthusiastic about spicy food like the rest of it. It was still a little hot for him. The rest of us thought it was perfect.

I've been looking for good Mongolian Beef in a restaurant ever since I moved from Illinois to the East coast some 30 years ago.  It was a favorite growing up, but where I live now it's either not available, or the recipes are too different.  Now feeling kind of dumb for not thinking of cooking it myself before, but making up for lost time, I've gotten three recipes for it on line.  This is the second I've tried, and although both are good, I'd give this one the edge.

One thing, I left out the red pepper entirely.  I do like spicy foods, but this is one dish where I think the spiciness gets in the way of the other flavors.  Adjusting the proportions for two servings instead of four, I think I skimped a little on the green onion.  But this was delicious, anyway.  I left the strips of flank steak marinating overnight; they were very tender, and the flavor was amazing.

The only remaining thing is that the restaurants where I got this when young would always serve it on a bed of crispy rice noodles.  The next time I make Mongolian Beef, regardless of the recipe, I'll have to use that.

This is a delicious dish. I used twice as much sugar, three times the amount of garlic and half as much red pepper flakes. I added with the green onions one small can of mushrooms  and a small can of sliced water
chestnuts.

These recipe is fantastic! And it only took about 20 minutes to make! I didn't realize that you were supposed to marinate the meat, so we skipped that step and didn't notice. We used premium stew meat from hyvee and sliced it really thin. It was plenty tender. I also added in an onion, just for a little more veggie. Then served it over rice. Fantastic recipe, will make again! 

Would add a teaspoon or so cornstarch to the sauce mix to help it coat the meat!

I cut the sugar in half and doubled the garlic and crushed red pepper. I tend to eat my spicy dishes much spicier than any recipe I have found. The base recipe is good. I just spiced to taste. I also sauteed jalapeños and onions to serve on the side with the meat.

Very tasty recipe. I cooked the meat into the marinade in a baking dish in the oven, covered. I served this on white rice, it was delicious!

I havent't tried it with marinating it for 24 hours, I only do an hour, but that may be why everyone else says it is either too salty or spicy using the original recipe. I don't plan my meals, I just randomly decide what I will cook before making it, so an hour of marinating works for me, plus it tastes great. I actually make fried rice with it which is a great match, just like the restaurant. I love, love, love this! The first time I made it, it was gone in fifteen min by three consumers including me, I was sad I didn't make more! Ik now, to make it by the batch, in case someone stops by. And as I am typing, my meat is marinating. ;-)

I use this as my go to stir fry sauce now.  I usually add some ginger to it as well.  Goes great with a tofu stir fry and some vegetables instead of the beef.

Good flavor. I only used a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes, because my kids are not fans of anything spicy. It still had a little heat, but everyone liked it.
It was a bit salty for my taste, so next time I'll use low-sodium soy sauce, or cut some of the hoisin sauce, although the hoisin sauce gives it a good flavor.

DELICIOUS! I marinaded the steak (I used Sirloin) for 30 hours and it was perfect!  I served it with the green onion ontop of jasmine rice, along with a side salad....Will DEFINITELY be making this again, especially to impress when having people over for dinner :)

This turned out great!  I also used sirloin instead of flank steak and I didnt use the red pepper flakes, but plan on using them next time.  I used low sodium soy sauce too.  I marinated the meat overnight in a plastic container shaking it up every so often.  I cooked the meat for probably about 2.5 minutes on high heat stirring constantly and added steamed stir fry veggies at the end.  Husband loved it, will definitely make again.

Used full amount of crushed red pepper, as we like heat.  Tossed the beef with broccoli and water chestnuts.  Served rice and edamame on the side.  Will definitely put this meal into our rotation.  Loved it!

I've tried a few other Mongolian Beef recipes, but this is the best one so far! I used sirloin steak and reduced the garlic and definitely decreased the red pepper. I only used 1/2 tsp and it was perfect. This was so good and even got the approval of my wife! I will definitely be making this again!

Great way to use up flank steak - we froze it for 15-20 minutes to make it easier to slice.  Didn't have time to marinade this but threw it into the slow cooker for 4 hours on low.  Doubled the sauce (had a bigger flank steak) and use 1 tsp instead of a tbsp for crushed red pepper, then mixed the sauce after cooking with brown rice, and tossed it together with some quickly stir fried (in peanut and hot sesame oil) snow peas.  I think the only thing needed is some stir fried onions for the hubby as well.  Also went easy on the sugar - the hoisin was sweet enough.

This was super easy.  However, I think I'll try a lite soy sauce next time as this was too salty.  My family still ate it up though.

This was reallyyyy good and easy to make.  I didn't have hoisin sauce, so I just used a little extra soy sauce.  Add sauteed onion and green peppers and top with cilantro for a better presentation!

Pretty decent. I used flank steak as called for and marinated it for 24 hours (prepped it along with dinner the night before so it would be ready for the next day dinner). The only thing I did different was to add about 1/4 cup red wine halfway through the marinating process. I did this because 1) I wanted to be sure the meat got tender and 2) the liquid had been totally absorbed from the original recipe and I feared that it would have no sauce -- as one reviewer complained. However, I realized that the meat will leak out all the stored up juice when you cook it in the pan. So next time I will omit the wine and see what happens.  This was tasty and we'll be making it again. Thanks.

This was an extremely tasty and very easy to make recipe. My husband loved it. I did make some slight changes. I cut the sugar down to 1 tsp and added fresh broccoli, water chestnuts and baby corn. I listened to other reviewers & kept the red paper down to 3/4 tsp. I will be making this recipe often.

Made it exactly as written but went really easy on the chili. Too salty and garlicky for me and seemed like it needed something but we couldn't figure out what. Served it on rice (with NO salt added) which made it too bland. I threw some sauted celery and sliced fresh broccoli in to the mix after the meat was cooked along with the green onion, the sauce was watery so I thickened with 1 Tb cornstarch and 1/8 cup water and cooked til thickened a little. Served with crunchy noodles on top and fresh sliced tomatoes and fruit to cut the salty/spicey on the tongue.

Wow...as is....way to spicy for me. Second time around I used about 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes and it was great. Also, lightly steamed some cauliflower and asparagus and added to meat mixture when meat was almost done. Excellent. Will make again and soon.

I believe the taste of this dish is wonderful, I did let mine marinate over night.  The flank steak was deliciously tender. However, I would have to say it is incredibly salty.  I would definitely choose low sodium soy next time around.  I think that will be the difference maker for my five star rating. 

What I really appreciated was that it wasn't breaded and fried like many mongolian beef recipes. I liked that I could prep it ahead, steam some broccoli and put some rice in the rice cooker.  Finished literally in 20 minutes.  Super quick!

It is very easy to prepare and yet tastes great! It was a little on the salty side for me, but it could just be personal preference. Great weeknight dinner and a tasty one too.

This recipe was so easy and tasted just like the Mongolian Beef from our favorite Chinese carry out!  I will definitely make this again and again.

This was just delicious. I couldn't find hoisin sauce, but I found a recipe for how to make it. After making that, I didn't have much hope for it tasting very good because the hoisin sauce just didn't smell good at all. But it turned out great! I followed the recipe exactly as it is, except I used a different cut of steak. It was extremely spicy, so if you are not a fan of spicy food, I would cut back on the red pepper. I had no complaints from my boyfriend who is usually a picky eater. He even asked to have the leftovers for lunch the next day! I will definitely be making this again.

I really thought this was delicious. My first time using flank steak so I was a little nervous. I froze it the day before then let it thaw for about an hour before slicing as thin as possible. The only changes I made were to reduce red pepper flakes (so the kids would eat it) and I doubled the marinade. This step was essential as the original recipe does not make enough sauce to serve this over rice.

Name says it all. Great weeknight meal. Didn't change a thing other than doubled the amount of marinade and used flat iron steak instead of flank. Broccoli would be good in this.

This was pretty good, though not exactly what my husband was looking for.  My kids liked it, and it was certainly tasty.  The marinade was very flavorful, and we included the red pepper flakes, which gave it a "very hot" factor.  I doubled the marinade recipe to make sure I had enough "sauce" for over the rice, but the sauce needed something to thicken it. Overall, good, but I think I will keep looking for another recipe.

It was good, but I think I was hoping for a little more flavor.  I want to try this again with a better cut of meat because it was super easy and included ingredients I always have on hand.  Thanks for sharing.

Yumm-o!  Made 2 1/2 times the sauce, doubled the meat, and added red peppers and broccoli (gotta have my veggies).  Did not double the red pepper flakes.  1 TBS was perfect heat with the amount of sauce I made.  Added a little cornstarch towards the end to thicken up the sauce.  Served with white rice.  This is so good I can't stop eating it.

Used 1 tsp of pepper flakes. Spicy enough with that! Easy to make. Needs a little extra pizazz but idk what yet. Will make again with adjustments.

Love, love, loved it. Simple and delicious. I did make two small changes: 1) Per each recipe's worth of marinade, I cut the red pepper flake back from 1 tablespoon to 1 teaspoon, which was plenty spicy enough for me (I like spicy food), but still a tad too spicy for my wife. 2) To make it a little saucier, I threw in a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with a half cup of chicken broth at the end.

Beyond that, I do have a few suggestions... For a less salty and agressive soy character, I used low-sodium tamari (Japanese soy sauce). As other reviewers recommended, I stir-fried a julienned carrot, red pepper, and onion after cooking the meat and removing it from the pan. I marinated 1.3lbs of meat in a double batch of the marinade, and I think doubling up the marinade was a good idea, otherwise it would have been a tad dry.

I will definitely make this again. Nom, nom, nom!

5 Stars!  This was tasty, spicy and delicious!  It was also easy to make.  I made the sauce ahead of time, and purchased the meat, then put the sauce in with the meat in a freezer bag and froze it until I was ready to make the recipe (about 1 1/2 weeks later).  I thawed, added to the wok, added a few green onions, and ate dinner about 15 mintues later.  It was delcious!  I am going to be eating at home a lot more now that I have found these delicious recipes!  It's so much fun too!

Fantastic.  I tried it with shrimp this time around and next week I will do the beef.  The sgrimp soaked up the marinade and tasted great.  I made 2 batches one with the red pepper flakes for my husband and I and one with out for the kids.

My family of 4 loved it, and it's hard satisfying all their palettes.  I doubled the recipe for leftovers.  A couple of changes I made: (1) I used very thin sliced sirloin; (2) added cornstarch to meat before adding marinade so sauce was thicker when it cooked; (3) after meat was cooked, I heated left over marinade and poured over meat; (3) I garnished meat with chopped green onions and sesame seeds.

Well this is super spicy with the full Tablespoon of red pepper flakes!  I only used half the soy sauce and added broth for the rest.  Used olive oil and onion powder in the marinade instead of sliced ones.  I can't compare this to authentic mongolian beef because I think I have only ever had ot once but this was good and I'll make it again!

This wasn't as good as i expected. i thought that the ingredient was too expensive for this monogolian beef recipe. and it wasn't that spicy. i rather go to a resturant and buy it rather than making it. this recipe was too salty and it didn't really taste like the mongolian beef at the chinese places. A better recipe is J.P or whatever mongolian beef altho. it isn't really spicy.

This was very good and easy!  I did change a little by adding one yellow onion (sliced) and doubled the red pepper and did not use the sugar. I added the green onions at the end so that they kept their crunch.  MUST use very thinly sliced beef!

I don't know what kind of steak I used (because the writing was in Chinese)but it was delicious with this.  The sauce was so good.  I did add more veggies because I just had a half of a handful of red bell pepper and three mushrooms and a few snow peas.  I tasted the meat and sauce first so I could rate it fairly and man, was it good! Served with white rice cooked in beef broth.

This was pretty good...I always get mongolian beef at my favorite chinese place, and this didn't quite stack up, but for homemade it was pretty good. I added in half of a white onion as well. Don't know if I'll try again or not, but I'm glad I made it! Thanks!

This was fantastic!!!  I made this for the wife and I on Sunday, and it was delicious!  Followed the directions almost exactly, and let it marinate for about 24 hours.    This is a definite make again!  easy and delicious!

Fantastic! I made with ingredients as listed with two exceptions: 1.) used 8 scallions, cut in 2" pieces, and 2.) used 2 tsp. crushed red pepper and 2 tsp. Mongolian Fire Oil. Even without a full hour to marinate the flank steak strips, the dish turned out wonderfully flavorful with a heat factor that was very enjoyable, but that wouldn't keep me from serving this for friends. Easy prep, great aroma, and wonderful flavor. My partner I both enjoyed this very much. Thanks for the recipe, Ang!

I added matchstick carrots in with the onions. Definitely double the sauce.  I think it would be very dry w/o doubling.  I used one serving of sauce for the marinade and the other serving I poured over the meat immediately after I turned off the burner.  I found this to be too salty using Kikoman brand soy sauce.  Maybe the light would be better.  ...and I'm a salt lover!!  Still too salty for me.  This is good but I'd tweek it a bit next time.  Less soy sauce (or light), a tad bit more sugar and a couple of teaspoons of freshly minced ginger would be good.  It's not my favorite Mongolian Beef recipe but I loved that it was quick and easy.

We loved it! Just the right spiciness for our tastes. I marinated the meat for an hour. I also added green pepper and used regular onion because I didn't have green onion on hand. I served with sweet plum sauce which I like to do when I know I have a spicy meal, it helps cut the heat if you need to. Great recipe, thanks.. Ang

This really lives up to its name. Super Simple and SUPER spicy. It definitely needs vegetables. I added red bell pepper and white onions along with the green onion. YUM!

excellent.  We only had time to marinate this for 40 minutes, but the beef was tender and perfect.   I was purposely heavy handed with the hot pepper and the garlic.  Lovely.

Loved this recipe, thank you! I used less red pepper flakes (only a tsp.)& sliced sirloin for my own personal preference. I wasn't sure if I was suppose to stir fry the beef right in the sauce so I opted to remove it from the marinade/sauce with a slotted spoon first, stir fry, then add sauce. Threw in snap peas, onions and red pepper..yum!

Awesome easy recipe!  I only had chicken on hand, and it was still delicious!  I added a little bit of curry to the marinade, half a bunch of cilantro and ~6 leaves of basil to the stir fry and the flavor was fantastic.

Nearly as good as the restaurants and quick and easy.  I used half the red pepper and it was perfect...still spicy but not too bad.  Served it on top of homemade fried rice and it was great.

So good!  I stir fried onions, green pepper and carrot on the side and then added in before serving.  I also doubled sauce and am glad I did, marinated over night, and used a flank steak that I had tenderized at the meat market.  It was not tough at all and so flavorful!

This basic recipe was very good.  I doubled it because we like a lot of sauce when having rice with Asian food.  I will take another's suggestion, however, to use low sodium soy sauce next time.  I am not typically aware of a lot of salt as I tend to salt heavily anyway, but this one was very salty!  Even the sugar didn't even out the extra salt that comes from the soy sauce.  In addition, I used a Tbsp of red pepper flakes and it was mildly warm, the folks in my family that are sensitive to heat said it was just right and those of of who like a lot of heat said it could have taken at least another Tbsp or 2 of the red pepper.  To make it like authentic Mongolian beef I only used the green onion and a sliced white onion in the mixture, but I know that you could add just about any vegetable and have this be really good.  Overall, we liked it ok, but have other Asian favs I've found on this site that we like better.

This was pretty good - I also used sirloin steak and added carrots and broccoli.  Next time I would double the marinade and reduce the pepper flakes just a bit.

Very good flavor. I let it marinade in the refrigerator for over a day. I thickened the wok juices with a little cornstarch and kicked it up with some chili paste.

Yummy!  Made this last night using a package of beef stir fry strips and per some other users, reduced the pepper flakes to about 1 1/2 tsps.  I used broccoli and carrot strips as my veggies and just sprayed my pan to stir fry them in.  Added the marinaded beef and served over brown rice.  Decent amount of heat to give it great flavour and fairly quick to prepare!

This was really, really good!  Mongolian beef is my favorite dish when dining at Asian restaurants, and this definitely measured up.  I was unable to find flank steak, so I used top sirloin instead.  The only other change I made was to use low-sodium soy sauce, and it was still plenty salty.  The beef was tender, flavorful and spicy. We love hot stuff, but if you don't, I think this would be just fine without the red pepper flakes.

My husband I both loved this, and it will be going into my permanent recipe file.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the red pepper to 1 tsp and it was just spicy enough for me. I marinated for 3 hours and added 1/2 an onion and broccoli. I served it over brown rice and it was delicious. I don't marinate often but I might have to start after this recipe.

Sooo good! I followed the recipe exactly, except I also added matchstick carrots and whole button mushrooms. I will *definitely* be making this again. Love the heat it has! Thanks for sharing!!!

This is an excellent and easy recipe!  My husband said it was the best stir fry I've made yet.  I decreased the crushed red pepper to 1 teaspoon and it was still plenty hot.  I also added extra veggies just because we like them - extra onion, zucchini, and carrot.
Served over fluffy steamed white rice, you can't go wrong!
Thank you for posting this recipe.

Marinade was perfect with just a teaspoon of the pepper flakes.  Best Asian dish we've made at home yet!

This really is very easy and good.  Only used 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes and that was plenty!  I always add extra veggies and serve over rice.
