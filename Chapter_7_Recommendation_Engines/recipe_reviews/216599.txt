Ok, they were fast and tasted.......ok.  However, I think I will spend the extra 15 minutes or so next time making really good ones.  There are so many really great Enchilada recipes on "All Recipes" to waste time (and ingredients) on mediocre results.

The recipe is GREAT! A wonderful starting point for me. I only gave 4 stars because, I did adjust it a lot. The following are my alterations/additions.   01. I did NOT use the red and green pepper, or the cilantro or Italian dressing. 02. I used 2 lbs of ground beef. 03. I used one package of large burrito flour tortillas 10 count. 04. When it came time I used one 24oz jar of chunky style salsa and 1/2 cup of enchilada sauce from a 28 oz.can ( reserve) the rest. 05. I also added to the filling mixture one can 19.75 of black beans. 06. While the mixture is slowly bubbling I took the remaining salsa and put it in a sauce pan, mixing, one can 10oz. of diced tomatoes with green chillis drained with it warmed up on med low.  07. I  heated one 16oz. can of refried beans in the microwave ( enough time to warm, about 3:00 minutes. 08. Once everything is prepared, I spread about 2 tablespoons of the refried beans, maybe a bit more enough to put a thin layer on the tortilla. 09. I then put about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of filling down the center amount of filling is preference. Then I rolled the tortilla and placed in a prepared pan seam side down. Repeat, until all ten are in the pan. 10. Once all are in the pan I then poured over evenly the enchilada / salsa sauce on the enchiladas. 11. Baked as directed. Final ten minutes of baking take out and sprinkle shredded Mexican cheese to taste, and garnish with green fire roasted chillies and black olives( optional)  family loved thid

I adapted this by using left-overs from Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Beef. I used only the beef and peppers inside the tortilla omitting the salsa. I did add it on the bottom of the casserole dish. I liked the flavor of the dressing on the tortillas but think I would prefer this made with corn tortillas.

The only thing I did differently was simply brush the tortillas with the dressing once they were wrapped and in the pan instead of using the microwave method. I followed all other directions as is. They were great!

Very good! I have tried other beef enchilada recipes that call for enchilada sauce and haven't really liked them. These taste great and are so easy. I have added black beans as well for a little more protein and fiber.

There are WAY better enchilada recipes out there. Don't waste your time with this one. Typical enchiladas served with rice, refried beans, sour cream - no mention of these items in this recipe or to be served with this recipe. It was edible but not flavorful enough. Won't make again.

I wouldn't call this better-than-ever, more like "as-average-as-ever". The one good thing they've got going for them is few ingredients, however while they seem simple, there's too many steps to getting the finished product.

I didn't like the Italian dressing it was too tangy for Mexican food.
