What an excellent recipe, I replaced the pepper flakes with fresh minced hot peppers for the garden. Also added ground bell pepper, onion and garlic too. Essentially I ground everything up, put 2 tbs of mixture in bottom of quart jars, filled with sprouts and finally added hot brine.

Just made these today and can't wait to try them! They were very simple to make...I halved the recipe and got 3 half-pint jars out of it (had extra liquid left over, but that was no big deal). Will be back in 3 weeks to update...I'm so excited, lol! :)

This was a good starter recipe.  I added dill and pickling spice.  I also added a habenaro on some jars for a little kick for Bloody Marys!  Thanks for recipe!

I made cases of them.  They are turning purple.  They still taste good and have a good texture.  What causes this?  Could it be the crushed red pepper flakes that does it.  Would love to know!!!  Thanks!

My family loves these. I have made them a few times and their favorite is when I add hot thai peppers.

I used kosher salt, added one sliced raw jalepeno, and a few Thai chili peppers. It was awesome.
