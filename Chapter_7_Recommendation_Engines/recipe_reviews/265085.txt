Easy recipe to go off of. Changed out the sugar for condensed milk. Had a little help form my Hispanic mother in law but other than that did it very easily on my own.

I made this recipe with the directions given.  It is SOUP.  My thought was...maybe they meant to say a total of 4 cups of milk, 2 being whole and 2 being evaporated. I would have to say. It is a terrible mess.  But after about an hour, all liquids absorbed and it was very delicious sans the raisins.

This recipe was the closest to my grandmothers style of arroz con leche. All of the other recipes call for raisins (yuck soggy raisins). I also didn’t add sugar I used condensed milk. This recipe was easy and delicious!

I liked it! Easy recipe to go off of. I eliminated the sugar and replaced one cup of evaporated milk with one cup of condensed milk. Yummy!
