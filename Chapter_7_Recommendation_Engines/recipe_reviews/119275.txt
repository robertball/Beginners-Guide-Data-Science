Excellent salad dressing! I'm so glad I stumbled upon this recipe! I used low sodium V8 and splenda and added a little dijon to thicken it up. It's so good you'd never guess it's basically fat free! This is a definite keeper especially if you're on a diet or just looking to keep things light and healthy without giving up taste.

This is a superb dressing and is 0 pt per tablespoon on Weight Watchers.  I did change mine up a smidge.  I made a double batch, doubling the tomato juice to 1 1/2 c and 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar but still used only 1 package of the italian dressing.  I also sweetened mine up with more sugar, about 2 1/2 tablespoons instead of the 1tbl and 1 tsp that would make a double batch but you could use Splenda just as well.  Play with this and make it your own, but you will find the basic recipe is delicious all by itself.  Took me maybe 2 minutes to prepare if you don't count the fact I had to run to the store and get italian dressing mix :)

Wonderful recipe, wouldn't change a thing.  My husband would only eat a salad with a creamy consistency such as a Ranch etc. but now he has been converted to this one also.  We loved it!

I made this sans sugar. I thought this was quite good. Nice way to use an odd packet of italian salad mix I had in my pantry. Wisk in a quarter cup of sour cream and this would make a great creamy dressing as well.

My new favorite salad dressing. Quick to make and delicious.  I use V8 sometimes and it is just as good.  Prefer to use red wine vinegar but balsamic is good too.  I also cut the sugar down to 1 tsp and use Spenda.

This was just OK for us as written. Second time: I used ranch mix and added 1/2 can tomato paste to thicken it. The extra tomato toned the vinegar down nicely,too.  My changes made this 5 stars for us. Update: Added 6 drops of liquid smoke to the leftovers. MMMMM! Tastes like a bacon tomato dressing I sometimes get in the bottle.

Wonderful salad dressing.  I used the Zesty Italian Salad Dressing version but still in the envelope.

This is THE BEST!! I sweetened it with stevia.. and used V8 juice.....I eat PALEO and try to stay with in the guide lines. Other than the high salt this fits perfect into my eating style. Thank you soooo much for sharing this with us. It's a keeper!!!

This is so good.  I'm glad to have an easy vinaigrette dressing I can make at home.  I used splenda instead of sugar.  I put this on my salad and it doesn't cost me any WW points.

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!!  What an easy and tasty recipe.  I'm a diabetic at risk of major problems if I don't get my act together.  I don't like using "low fat" or "fat free" foods because I don't know with what they're replacing the fat. Thanks so much!

At last I have found the perfect salad dressing!  Used V8, splenda instead of sugar, and since packaged Italian dressing mix has so much sodium I used mixed Italian seasoning.

This dressing is wonderful. I made it with Penzey's Italian dressing mix and substituted honey for the sugar hoping to give it a slightly thicker consistency. Wow is this yummy!!! And no fat! Perfect!

I made this for the first time.  I never have tomato juice so I used v8 and splenda.  It taste very good.  I used it on a pasta salad.  It does make the salad look a little dark. My husband loved it!!! He is used to wheat pasta and he thought it was just a new brand.  He asked me to make the pasta salad again.

Not bad, but too tomato-y for my taste, I like more of the balsamic vinegar to come through.  Probably wont make again.

This is a keeper!  I used a tomato & pepper soup instead of tomato juice, balsamic vinegar, one batch of Italian Dressing Mix from this site, and splenda instead of sugar.  I let it sit overnight and Yum!

i wanted to try my white balsamic vinegar so i did an ingredient search and found this. i used some of my homemade italian drssing mix and was very happy w/ the results. i really liked the color and flavor the tomato juice gave the dressing instead of oil for a change. i highly recommend white balsamic vinegar for this. i think standard balsamic would not have been nearly as pretty

This was so great!  Thanks for posting the recipe.  I happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  It went together so fast and was soooo good.  Considering there is zero fat in this dressing, the flavor and texture is really great.

WOW!  I decided to try this dressing on a whim, and I'm SO glad I did.  It is so good, and add to that it's a mere EIGHTEEN calories per 2 TBLS and it's FANTASTIC!  I don't care for tomato juice, so I was more than a bit apprehensive, but if I hadn't made the dressing myself I would not have known it contained tomato juice.   Since I had the blender out for making another dressing, I blended this in the blender, too.  This will become my staple dressing for chopped salads.  THANKS so much, Alice Choate!

I have been looking for a salad dressing that I could make on my own.  I'm new with cooking so I was looking for something simple.  This was not only easy, but amazing!  I am definitely going to make this time and time again.  I signed up for allrecipes just to review this!  Thanks!!!!

Thank you Alice!  I served this at a dinner party last night.  Even my husband who hates any kind of vinegar loved it.  I will always keep this dressing on hand.   My husband is a diabetic and I am always watching my calories and this recipe fits the bill for all.  Outstanding!

Fabulous and so easy.  I loved making this with tomato juice instead of oil - I gobbled the salad!  Can't think of anything that would make this better.

Great dressing! Complements a broccoli slaw salad.  I add pineapple, almonds, and cran raisins and substitute V8 for tomato juice.... makes a great fast salad that even my 4 year old likes.  Thank you

Very yummy, easy, and healthy too!  I used 2 Tbsp of the Italian Dressing mix by Debby on this site.

Super easy to make (takes less than 2 mins) and tastes FABULOUS!!  I prefer the taste of red-wine vinegar over balsamic and this is now my #1 "go-to" dressing. Thanks, Alice!

I agree this should have several other descriptive words in the name...easy, deliciuos, fat free....I added one Splenda packet instead of sugar and about 1/8 additional cup of balsamic (ONLY AFTER I TRIED ORIGINAL recipe without sugar)!  Thank you for sharing my new staple balsamic dressing!

What a great recipe! I really like the taste of balsamic so I added about 1/8 to 1/4cup more of balsamic and only added 1&1/4 of Splenda. Hope you all enjoy.

Fabulous! Excellent and a million other positive adjectives.  I love that there is no oil in this recipe at all.  This will be a staple in my fridge!

A little sweet but very good!  Double the recipe and keep extra in fridge.
