Very flavorful; just needs a sauce to soak into the rice. I used sushi rice instead of the basmati, because I love stick rice. Overall the dish was good.

Very tasty.  Didn't have fish sauce - used Oyster Sauce.  Will definitely do again.  Easy to prepare, could start cooking other ingredients (other than rice) earlier than  indicated.

Corrections: Slice mushrooms. Change instructions from 1/2 " to 3/8". Cook chicken for 1.5 minutes per side and set aside. If sauce starts to dry out, use  white wine with cover to cook vegetables. Delay adding asparagus until last 2 minutes.
