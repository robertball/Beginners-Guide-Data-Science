Reading over this recipe I really liked the ingredient list, but not the cooking methods.  Way too many pots, not in the mood for washing.  I turned this into a 1 pot meal by first boiling and frying the pierogies in a large frying pan.  I removed them from the pan and set them aside. Next I added the mushrooms, onions and garlic in the same pan and sauteed until tender in some oil (did not use the 1/2 cup of butter at all).  I then dumped in everything else except the liquids.  I used chicken stock instead of beer (all I had) and mixed the Worcestershire and vinegar with the stock, and then added to the pan.  Simmered the whole mess until the cabbage was tender and most of the liquid was reduced.  Worked very well and was very good!  This would also be good with noodles instead of pierogies.

This was pretty tasty.  Next time I think after pan frying the pierogies in a little butter (1 -2 tablespoons) will just set them aside instead of adding them to the mixture and just serve the mixture over them because they were a tad soggy, BUT it still tasted good. Followed recipe exactly.  Was a nice change. Will make again. Thanks for posting.  UPDATE:  Made this again.  Turkey kielbasa is a nice substitute.  We love the flavor is it's so much more healthier.  I usually buy the Butterball brand, 3 ounces is 6 grams of fat vs. 27 grams of fat for pork/beef kielbasa.  And honestly it taste just as good.  I also cut the butter in half.  Cooked, covered and set aside the pierogies.  When the cabbage/sausage was done I served it over the pierogies which was way better for us that way the peirogies didn't fall apart and weren't soggy.  It was great.

Great! the only thing I changed was I did not put my pierogies in with the cabbage mixture. I fried with some bacon and olive oil and kept seperate. My family loved it!!!

I used half of butter that was called for in the original recipe to quickly sauté onion, garlic, mushroom, and cabbage, before chicken stock (substitute for beer) was added. I also browned Polish sausage in another pan in its own grease. Because I liked my sausage juicy with some crispy texture, I put it into cabbage mixture at very end. I also reserved some sausage grease for pan-frying pierogies. The remaining of sausage grease I pulled into cabbage mixture to enhance the flavor. It turned out great. I love my first pierogie dish.

I scaled back the seasoned salt to 1 tsp, used Hillshire Farms chicken smoked sausage, and browned the pierogies in butter rather than oil, otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Try to make just enough for dinner because it doesn't look too appetizing after it sits for a while (but cooked cabbage never does), and I doubt that I'd serve it for leftovers.  This was pretty easy to prepare and tasted OK, but didn't wow us like I hoped it would.   But then, that could be just a personal taste preference.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. It was a nice change from just plain sausage and cabbage. I agree with the others about setting aside the pierogies so they won't get soggy. All in all, the turnout had awesome flavor and was quite filling. Good Job Abraxis!

Very easy to make, and very tasty. I did take the advise of several other reviewers and didn't add the pierogies until we were ready to eat. It's been snowing and it's single digits outside and this was the perfect dinner.

Have been making a very similar dish for years but mine is much simplier using 1 large pan.  Fry the sausage, usually kielbasa, and mushrooms first.  When browned I add about half a can of beef broth and the pierogis.  Brown pierogis adding more broth as needed to cook pierogis.  Then top the pan with wide sliced cabbage and steam with top on pan for about 7 minutes until cabbage is cooked.  We like our cabbage cooked until light green not over cooked until grey.

So delish! New favorite for sure. Three ingredients I would not think to put together. The Pierogies made the dish over the top for sure.

This was delicious. I did not use mushrooms, because I hate them. I also used Balsamic Vinegar reduction. I made everything according to the instructions otherwise. It has to be the best Cabbage and Sausage I have eaten ever. I had two huge bowls and bragged about it to my family. Nice change to the blah usual dinner. I loved it and will hold onto this recipe for future dinners with company.

Tasty.  Not sure about seasoned salt.  I added dill , Cayenne pepper  an salt.  Did not have any mushrooms so I used carrots.  Nice color addition to a bland looking dish.

We all liked this, even my husband who rarely likes anything with cabbage. The flavor was good and the dish was very different from our usually meals. However, we also agreed that we like pierogies better with just butter & onions. I think I may try this again with egg noodles instead of pierogies.

I had to adapt a bit due to ingredients on hand.  I had no beer and used beef broth, I did not use butter I used bacon grease (1 TBS) my husband is southern and insists on it in any type of "green".  We didn't have mushrooms.  Reduced seasoning salt in half (I use the low sodium version).  I placed the bacon grease in the dutch oven then added the cabbage, onion and garlic to it wilted it down a tad then added 12 oz beef broth.  I boiled then fried the periogies in the same pan the sausage was browned in.  After adding it all to the dutch oven I continued to simmer it down a bit to reduce the liquid with the lid partially off.  The flavor was amazing the periogies were indeed very soft and next time I may just use them to top the cabbage/sausage mix.  It was a huge hit here and a keeper.

we loved this recipe, I made it last evening. I kept the pierogies separate from the cabbage-kleibasa mixture,and just spooned the mixture over them.  My husband and I both loved it, and I will definitely make this again.
