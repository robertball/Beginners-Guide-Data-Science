Simple Scandinavian Chili Haiku: "Boring as it is. Had a bite around half-way, had to add some salt." Hovered on giving this 3 stars since I had to jazz it up after tasting it at 30 min. (very /yawn/) but seeing how the cook's note mentions adding salt, I would definitely recommend it. Prior to tasting it (and adding salt along w/ a heaping scoop of AR's "Sarah's Chili Seasoning Mix") I was completely faithful to the recipe. It's not a chili recipe that'll win awards, but w/ a little spice-love, and one's usual toppings (our go-to's are cheese, Fritos, sour cream, and occasionally cilantro, green onions and Sriracha), it was quite tasty. Thanks to the Scandinavian mom for the recipe!
