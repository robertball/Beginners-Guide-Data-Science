The cod was dry, but this recipe gets 5 stars for the sauce--it should be a recipe on its own.  I heated the extra sauce and served it with the fish and rice.  It was very good on the rice as well.  This sauce would be good on beef, pork or chicken.  Next time I'm going to put it on hamburgers.

For the horseradish sauce I used a recipe from this site (by Carol46) replacing sour cream with plain lowfat yogurt.

This was delicious, and I'm not a huge fish fan.  I modified it a bit to use what I had on hand, but I followed the "spirit" of the recipe.  I made horsey sauce from scratch at home instead of using prepared.  I also made a mock-cajun topping instead. The red pepper sauce is excellent. I added about a TBSP of lemon juice and a little salt to bring out the flavors more. Yum. I'll probably just use crushed ritz crackers on top next time for simplicity and so other flavors don't compete with the flavor of the sauce.

For those who commented on the sauce having too much of a horseradish taste, I'm wondering if they used plain horseradish instead of the horseradish sauce as the recipe suggested. Anyway, even with the additions of garlic and onion powder, black pepper and a splash of fat free half and half, I still found the sauce to be rather bland with very little flavor.

Loved this recipe! It made a nice creamy sauce. I used crumbled Ritz crackers instead to done down the heat and didn't use the other seasoning. The sauce was so good that I even had some on top of the crackers. It was a great way to have fish - something different than the usual grill or steamed versions.

I used fresh peppers (red and orange) and roasted them on the stove.  It was very good but next time I will add a dash or two of salt.  I put the cajun mix in my processor until crumbled.  It definately added a good punch and flavor. As others have said the horseradish sauce that I got from this site was wonderful and I will use it by itself for future prime rib etc.

WAY too much horseradish--and we LOVE horseradish, so that says something.  Sauce completely overwhelms the cod.  Won't make this again...

The sauce makes this dish. I'm going to make that and use it on chicken next.

I used FERGYBROCK's idea of lemon juice and salt in the sauce. I made a 1/2 recipe and used 1 teaspoon lemon juice and 1/8 teaspoon salt. I also used crushed whole wheat pretzels intsead of the cajun mix. It was very good.

Delicious!  Thank you for this recipe!  I used the horseradish sauce recipe on this site and it was easy to make and so-oo good.  My only problem was in finding cajun snack - couldn't find at our grocer, so I used Kashi TLC vegetable crackers and added cajun seasoning.  Our grocer had swai on sale, so I used it in place of the cod.  You'd ever know the difference. My husband really enjoyed this - I will defintely make again.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I love this recipe!  I don't use the cajun seasoning - sometimes I will add crushed ritz crackers.  I love the horseradish flavor!  One of my favorites, it's a staple in our house!

OMG !!   Just  add extra roasted pepper to the Horsey Sauce.   Used crushed Ritz crackers and seasoned with Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt to season with.  It was beautifully moist.  Can not wait to make it again !

i didn't really like this at all. Although, it;s saving grace was the roasted red pepper sauce. I would try make it again without the cajun snack food coating and see what I think.

My husband loved it!  Said it was some of the best fish he had ever had & he loves fish!  I thought it was terrific, I wished the sauce was a little thicker, but that would be easy enough to fix.  We would do this again!

I really enjoyed enjoyed this recipe.  It is very tasty (dependent entirely on how you make your sauce). The roasted red pepper gives it a great taste.  be careful as the horseradish can overwhelm the roasted red pepper if you're not careful.  You want just a hint of the horseradish... unless of course you are a horseradish fanatic.

I had to substitute wasabi for the horseradish but the sauce for this dish was still delish!!  I plan to use this sauce for other meats like a tenderloin.

I had to play around with the sauce since I had horseradish instead of horseradish sauce, but it turned out great on the end.  I make this for chicken instead of fish and usually crumble saltines on top for a bit of crunch.

When I first made the sauce I was hoping for a little more red pepper favor.  The horseradish sauce I used did seem to over power the sauce.  I made a few changes to this recipe and it turned out pretty good.  I added a few dashes of lemon juice and black ground pepper to the sauce mixture.  Also, when seasoning the fish I used garlic pepper as well as a Cajun seasoning directly onto the fish.  I also substituted the crushed snack mix with Corn Flake Crumbs.  All in all turned out pretty good.

The Roasted Red Pepper Horseradish Sauce is very tasty, but the cod is overpowered in this dish. I want to try this sauce with a beef dish. Maybe a roast! That would be yum.

I love horseradish, but it was WAY too much for this recipe.  My husband took one bite and then wouldn't eat anymore.  I just scraped everything off and ate the fish.

This recipe has a wonderful sauce and is a good starting place, as many recipes here are.

The store horseradish sauce had HF corn syrup in it. I picked a horseradish w/o, added about 1T to some good quality mayo and made my own. I couldn't find the snack mix so used Panko crumbs, after heavily seasoning the fillets w/ a cajun seasoning mix. (The one I have is a mix of garlic, black pepper, cayenne pepper, oregano, chili pepper, salt, onion, paprika and red and green bell peppers...you could make your own with what you have on hand and like.) The fish and sauce were delicious over rice!

We didn't use as much horseradish as it calls for because I am not a big fan.  But to my surprise the fish was excellant!

I made this tonight and it was ok. I thought that the horseradish was way too powerful. The cod itself was tasty after I scraped the sauce off. My husband liked the sauce though, so perhaps it is just a matter of personal taste. It was super easy. I'll probably make this again but use less horseradish

Made this tonight with Halibut. The only change I made was to skip the cajun seasoned snack mix because I didn't have any.  Did bread crumbs instead but think I'll skip them next time too as they didn't really add anything. Tasted the sauce before cooking and it was pretty spicy... but the cooking seemed to tame it down.  The finished dish had a nice horseradish flavor but wasn't too spicy at all, and we have pretty mild taste buds in our house.  I will make this again but may add a few extra spices (maybe some fresh garlic and minced onion in the sauce) to give it some depth.  I used the horseradish sauce from this site and it turned out well.  Made a little less than a full cup but that seemed to be enough for the amount of fish I had.
