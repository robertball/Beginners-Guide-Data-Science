I  just used cheese tortellini from Trader Joe's and Vidalia onions and skipped the carrots (too lazy to grate them). This was phenomenal. People who claimed not to care for pasta salads loved it. I made the dressing with very high quality oil and vinegar, which brought this over the top. And it really was easy - it was a last minute addition to a party buffet based on things I had on hand.

A+ salad! Instead of the spinach tortellini we added 2 packages of the tri-color cheese filled tortellini.  Also topped it off with some feta cheese crumbles.  We used a caesar vinaigrette dressing (that we had on hand) in place of the oil and vinegar - - added a nice flavor. Didn't have marinated artichokes so we used the plain ones. * * The key was to let it set at least 3 hours for all of the flavors to settle.

We Loved it--I did add sliced scallions, 1 lb. large shrimp-
cut in half, a 12 oz jar of artichokes & an 8 oz. tub of
shredded 3 cheese romano-parmesan-asiago mix. It was scrumptious!
Everyone Scarfed it down. You could use any meat or skip the meat,
or add a jar of pimentos or chopped red bell peppers & or
diced celery too. Very versitile!

We served it for guest and they all enjoyed it. Then we took it to a group meeting and everyone liked it. We used Olive Garden Salad dressing.

This salad was wonderful. I brought it to an outdoor barbecue  and everyone raved over it. I forgot the onions but maybe that was good for a crowd.  I also added a can of hearts of palm and zucchini squash since I didn't have any spinach.  I'm planning on making this again real soon!

It turned out great and was a hit with my family.  I added fresh spinach which made it even more colorful.
