“Fudge cake” is an appropriate name for this recipe as it gets cakey around the sides and fudgey in the middle, which I loved! Amazing with ice cream!

Super Rich. Lots of vanilla ice cream is a must to balance the richness. Easy to make and yummy!  I think I'd make it with creamy peanut butter next time. Cooked for right about 1 1/2 hours.

Delicious! My family loved it over ice cream. We followed the other recommendation to cook it on high for 1 hour followed by the warm setting.

Made this last night for the BF and he really liked it....he is a chocolate and PB fan so couldn't go wrong here! It was very rich and gooey and I agree that ice-cream is a must to balance it out. I set the cooker for an hour on high, and then after that kept it on the warm setting for over an hour to have after dinner.

I may have cooked it about 5 minutes too long! Flavor was great, great with butter pecan ice cream.

This cooked a lot faster than the recipe called for and was really not cake-like.  I'm sorry, but it was just sort of blah to us.
