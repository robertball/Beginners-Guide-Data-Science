If you like white Russians and chocolate you will love this. I also added 2 oz of Godiva  white chocolate liqueur and topped with whipped cream. Awesome! Thanks for a great recipe. I never would have thought to use chocolate milk!!

This is my kind of chocolate milk.  The only change I made was to use chocolate vodka.
