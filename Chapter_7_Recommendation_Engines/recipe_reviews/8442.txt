Wonderful cake that wasn't too lemony!  Great glaze, too.  I served it with a pretty lemon/orange/lime sherbet and it went perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is wonderful! I added a glaze, made with 3 cups confectioner's sugar, 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tsp milk, 2 tbsp butter and 1 cup coconut - this added a bit of texture to the cake. It also covers up the holes!  Loved it!

A very moist, very lemony cake. I also make an additional glaze of lemon juice and powdered sugar to go over it after it is cooled...YUM!

This cake was good but way, way, way to sweet (and I like sweet).  Could not taste the lemon and I substituted lemon juice for the water in my glaze.  I also only had a white cake so made it with that.

I made this with butter cake just like the box said W/ (real Butter). Took it to our neighborhood Bingo everyone wanted the recipe. I saved a little of the icing and make it thicker to drizzle over the top after it cooled it looked wonderful and tasted great!

I've lost count of how many times I've made this. Any time I need a good dessert, I go back to this one. I've made it for church socials, holiday meals, and just for fun. So many people have asked me for the recipe. I usually make it in a bundt pan and increase the cooking time to 40-45 minutes. Glazing it in the bundt pan is a bit more of a pain, but I use skewers to poke lots of long holes and a turkey baster to slowly keep pouring the glaze over it. A lot of the glaze will slide off the cake onto the plate, so I just suck it up with the baster and keep glazing. I think it makes the cake look nicer. But any way you prepare it, the recipe is out of this world!

Made this a few hours before heading to a birthday dinner.  I wanted a cake that tasted as though it set overnight.  I wanted a more robust lemon flavor so I added 1 TB of Watkins Lemon Extract to the cake and another TB to the glaze.  I AM SO GL:AD I DID!  I also used the suggestion given by a reviewer to add coconut to the glaze.  It turned out great and pretty!  The cake was very moist, there was a little crunch to the topping.  If I make it again, I will add lemon zest to the glaze as well.  The whole thing got eaten :)

This cake turned out very good.  I couldn't find an 18.5 oz cake mix all I could find was a 15 oz so I only used 3 eggs and reduced the water and oil a little. It still came out good.  I had a lot of glaze left over.  I didn't want it to be overly sweet so I just drizzled a little over the top.  This is a great way to jazz up a boxed cake mix.

This cake was great, my hubby really loved it!  I did use lemon juice instead of water and I also made enough icing to go in the holes and on top the cake (I made it in a bundt pan).

I used 4 eggwhites instead of whole eggs, used 1/2 lemon and 1/2 orange juice in the glaze; when it was cool I topped with light cool whip mixed into instant lemon pudding made with only 3/4 of a cup of skim milk. Everyone loved it!

Great cake. It would have been way too sweet  and gloppy for me if I had used all of the glaze, I only used about 1/3 and it was perfect for everyone in my family.

I followed the recipe exactly,  and my family really enjoyed it.  Like someone else mentioned, this is a very moist and lemony cake (as a lemon poke cake should be).  Thanks for the great recipe!
