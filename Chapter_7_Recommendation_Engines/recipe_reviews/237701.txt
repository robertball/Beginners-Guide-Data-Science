Yaaaaaaaaaas! I just brought this to Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. My aunt stole a huge chunk of it for a post-Christmas meal with other relatives today, my parents took some home, and even my uncle, who hates coconut, liked it (though, I didn't tell him it was in there ;D )

I did use Carrot Cake III from this site instead of a boxed cake mix, and made real whipped cream instead of using Cool Whip. I was a little short on filling, but I'm assuming that's due to the whipped cream change. Next time I'll whip a full 16oz of it and that should do it. I did have a little trouble getting the cream cheese mixed into the pudding smoothly, in the end it was still a little lumpy, but the toppings masked that at least! I let it soften a bit first, but maybe it needed a little more time. I might try a cooked pudding next time and see if the heat makes it easier to blend the cheese in. There will definitely be a next time though, this is completely delicious.

AMAZING!!!!!  I made this for Easter & it was awesome!!  Something different, beautiful & everyone loved!!!  Thank you for this great recipe!  The only change I made, was to make my own carrot cake that my family loves (Carrot Cake X on AR) rather than use a mix.  I used an electric mixer to make the pudding then added a block Neufchatel cream cheese (less fat & softer) that I set out on counter for about a half hour.  I blended until it was creamy.  I put it all together the night before & it was PERFECT!?

Totally addicting! The only changes were that I used a little less than half of a leftover Sam's  iced, carrot cake instead of baking one, and I used 1 vanilla & 1 cheesecake pudding  instead of a larger vanilla  size. Everyone had seconds!

Absolutely delicious. Made it for Christmas Eve and it was a hit. Only thing I did different was omit the coconut because of an allergy and added more toffee bits and almonds. Outstanding!!

This is so good.  My trifle bowl was overfull and I could not fit all the cake in there.  I think it needs more cream cheese flavor and will either add more cream cheese or maybe see if there is a cheesecake pudding flavor to use next time.  My daughter just make the cake per directions on the box.

It was very good however I prefer traditional carrot cake cream cheese icing. Hubby thought it was great! Followed the recipe as printed. I would make it again.

Definitely make this one again.  Everyone raved about it.  Used real whipping cream instead of Cool Whip which made it all the more delicious.    Plus it looked wonderful in a trifle dish.

Actually, my niece made it for my birthday.   I think it was my favorite dessert of all time!  As did my Mom and 5 sisters!  Having read through the recipe I liked the author's suggestion that it can be use with any cake tha may have had an oops out of the pan.   She also made the fondant carrots that were incredibly realistic looking.

I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing.  I used a Carrot Cake box mix that calls for water to reconstitute the included carrots and raisins so I used no extra water.  FABULOUS Easter Dessert!
