Excellent!  Why did I eat cereal out of a box for so long?  I always add 1 T of vanilla, 1 T of cinnamon and 3/4 c sunflower or pumpkin seeds.  Then I vary the fruit each time I make it, allowing about 1/2 c for each type until I reach the 3 cups total fruit called for by the recipe.  I've used dates, figs, dried mango, peaches, nectarines, apricots & cranberries, golden raisins and unsweetened coconut in addition to regular raisins and dried cherries.  For variety, substitute coconut, maple or banana flavoring for the vanilla or maple syrup or agave nectar for the honey.  Line your baking pans with parchment paper for super easy clean up, then roll the paper up and store it to use for your next batch.  You can cut the fat by subbing applesauce for 1/2 of the oil.  I've done this several times and it works fine.  Note:  if you're looking for a clumpy granola, this is not the one for you.  This only clumps up some IF your honey is beginning to solidify.  If clumps are your thing, choose a recipe with more sugar.

Fabulous recipe!  I didn't have dried cherries, so I used some extra raisins and broken pieces of sweetened banana chips.  I also added some sweetened coconut flakes and a bit of cinnamon.  I think 20 minutes total was a bit too long for this recipe - some of the oats were a bit burned.  I would reduce the baking time to 15-17 minutes.

Wonderful recipe.  I have made others from this site and for the sugarless recipes this one is the best.  It is sweet with out the sugar and is gone in minutes.  My family loves it for breakfast,snacks and as an ice cream topper.  This is a keeper.

I loved this base recipe so I made a few changes to make it my own. I use Olive Oil and I sometimes substitute molasses instead of honey for a really great flavor. I also add 1 tsp. Cinnamon AND 1 tsp. of Cloves or Nutmeg. I also added Vanilla! Ever since I started making this recipe about 2 years ago I think I have only bought about 4 boxes of store cereal. I make this (doubled) EVERY week! I change it up with the different spices and also I'll use Almond Flavoring instead of Vanilla. VERY, VERY GOOD! GREAT base recipe!

This recipe was yummy. I made only half the recipe, and substituted some maple syrup for some of the honey for added flavor, and used craisins, raisins and chopped dates. Delicious!

My favorite, non-sugar recipe.  It's a great base - I change the recipe all the time based on what I have in my cupboards.  I like to put pistachios (because the green color makes it so pretty!) and quinoa.  I have used pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and often use dried blueberries.  Change up the flavors by adding vanilla, cinnamon or molasses.  Yum!

Thought this was just OK.  Mine needed some more flavor and it didn't bind together.  But I'm not giving up though.  Next time I will add more cinnamon, honey and add brown sugar and vanilla.  I will also try adding banana like another recipe from this site uses.

I was trying to duplicate granola I bought at a Farmer's Market, and this is it.  Delicious.  Easy to make.  Perfect breakfast food with a little almond milk added.  I used 2 1/4 cups of sliced almonds in place of the walnuts and pecans, though I'm sure it's great with all three.

Delicious! I am eating it over vanilla yogurt. Great way to start the day. I halved the recipe. Threw it all together on a cookie sheet covered with foil with a light coating of butter & a sprinkle of brown sugar. I also sprinkled my homemade pumpkin pie spice over it. Thanks!

Fantastic granola recipe! I may never go back to the boxed stuff. This recipe is great as is and as a base for getting creative. I added flaxseed and swapped dried cranberries for the regular raisins. I can't wait to try this again with molasses...

This was AWESOME! We couldn't stop eating it once it came out of the oven. I added cinnamon for a personal preference. Great recipe. I will be making again - and probably sometime this week!

Great recipe!  I too substituted the raisins with craisins and dried blueberries.  Also, added some flax and sesame seeds.  I will definitely make this again!

I had some trouble evenly toasting the granola, but the result was very tasty.  We ate all of it plain, but it could make a great ice cream, muffin, or pie topping.

Five stars! This recipe makes a lot and was easy. I used 4 cups of thick and rough oatmeal and 2 cups regular oats but I added 2 tablespoons cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of vanilla because I love both ingredients and it added that wonderful aroma! Sounds like a lot but it was just right once it all mixed in. My raisins were baked in, too. Very delicious!

I just made this granola and it is delicious! I followed the proportions of the recipe, but used walnuts, almonds, coconut, and raisins. Also added some cinnamon. This was so easy! I'll be making this again and again. Thanks!

This was easy, quick and delicious.  I just used whatever I had on hand to make up the measurements for each of the oats, nuts and dried fruit and I will no longer be buying granola in the store.  Thank you for sharing this delicious, healthy recipe!

A great base recipe! I don't particullarly like some of the dried fruits so I only used almonds (added about an extra 1/2 cup). I also didn't have canola oil so I used vegetable oil and just a splash of seasme oil. Added cinnammon, cloves, nutmeg, a little brown sugar, vanilla, and drizzled extra honey on top before baking. Yummy!

Really excellent. I had slightly different kinds of dried fruit, but this is truly a good recipe. I made it for its lack of butter and sugar, and I'm very happy with it.

My family loved this!  I was tired of paying huge amounts of money for store bought granola, so I decided to make it myself.  I have made granola before and have always had success, but for some reason I got away from making it.  Well I'm Back!  I did sub craisins for cherries and sunflower seeds for pecans, and added a bit of cinnamon, but other than that the recipe was a hit.

Good base recipe. I halved the recipe and used what I had on hand: 1 C rolled oats and 2 C quick-cooking steel cut oats. Brown sugar instead of honey. Pecans as only nut. Added vanilla, fresh orange zest and a little cinnamon to the liquid mixture. Used assorted dried berries and golden raisins. Most importantly, baked only 13 minutes. I like the chewy texture of the steel cut oats when I mix this granola with yogurt. The orange zest punches up the flavor. I'm going to continue making it with these variations.

It is delicious and nutritious I used Demerara sugar instead of honey, and coconut oil instead of canola oil, I will eat this instead of boxed cereal.

This was an easy, quick recipe but that's about it. The water was unnecessary and there wasn't enough oil and honey to make small clusters. It just looked like lightly toasted oatmeal and nuts. Tasted rather bland too.

I made this recipe with the same quantity of ingredients. I used chopped almonds, sunflower seeds and walnuts. I also added about 1/2 c. dried coconut which added a bit of sweet.

I had butter syrup instead of honey, it worked well.

This recipe is huge so it would make a great gift during holidays.

Excellent!  I only make the half the recipe at a time, and vary the dried fruits each time: cherries, raisins, apples, bananas, figs.  Miniature chocolate chips are a staple, though!

Love this granola! I've been using this recipe for over a year and make a new batch nearly every week. This takes the place of all those box cereals that contain mysterious chemicals and BHT! I've started adding other things like raw flax seeds and pumpkin seeds before I bake it. Even made some for my mom and she loved it.
