Delicious!  I am not normally into cranberries, but this is yummy.  I tweaked it just a little, used fresh ginger frozen, sweetened cherries(who can find fresh cherries during Thanksgiving?) less sugar and a little honey.  Can't wait until dinner!

I am not sure if the recipe is printed wrong or not, but the cinnamon was way too overwhelming. It was to the point that it was all you can taste.  I loved the idea of the wine and cherries (which I also had to buy the frozen).

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. Its "insanely easy" and tasted great. I did reduce the amount of cinnamon from 2 T to 2 tsp after reading other reviews on this recipe and it was perfect! Next I want to try and add a can of mandarin oranges, possibly trying in some crepes for our Friendsgiving brunch. 

It was liquidy when I finished the 45 minutes on the stove top which scared me but it gelled perfectly after refrigeration. I was actually requested to make this again for next Thanksgiving. Def 5 Stars!

This is very good cranberry sauce.  It was a bit high on cinnamon for me, but my family did like it.  This recipes make a large quantity - so there were a lot of leftovers - a little too many left overs.  The wine is a nice tough though.  I also used dried cherries as fresh cherries are tough to come by in Pennsylvania in the winter.
