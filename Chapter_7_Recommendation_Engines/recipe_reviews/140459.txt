I make fried Yucca all the time for my family.  I would suggest some changes to this recipe.  You need to first boil the yucca until tender.  I have never timed how long it takes, 20-30 minutes depending on how thick the Yucca is.  I always buy it frozen since it bruises easily and hard to buy fresh.  Salt the water.  Then fry until golden brown.  I serve this with rice and beans or dip in Peruvian Green Aji sauce.  Yummy!

This is pretty good but for a better taste you have to boil yucca (big chuncks) in water w/salt and 2 or 3 smash cloves of garlic. Once the yucca is cooked cut it and deep fry until light golden brown.  It will be crunchy on the outside and soft & moist in the inside.  Also this is perfect to make "Mofongo de Yuca"!

As a puertorican, I've cooked yuca many times and in many different ways. This recipe works as is, IF you slice the yuca thin enough and skip the lime (it really doesn't "go"). I like to season it with garlic salt, OR drizzle with garlic infused olive oil OR serve with a side of  Mayo-Ketchup to dip in (1:1 ratio of mayo and ketchup with some pressed garlic in it or garlic powder). Having said that, I do prefer to cut the yuca in larger slices (like 1 in thick 3 to 4 inches long) and boil the yuca first, drain well, then fry. It just seems to work better and you get more of the yummy flavor of the yuca and its wonderful texture.

The Upperwest side girls got together to do some new side for Thanksgiving. This one did not make the cut. It was lack in flavor and the lemon juices does not cut it. I recommend season the Yucca sticks before frying them. I would use garlic powder , onion powder, salt, and peeper, then deep fry. This should do the trick

It was good. Better deep fry, Forget the lime, had a dinner party tonight and did Yucca frita (yucca fries) and Yucca Cuban style. The Cuban style was gone in a blink of the eye. but not this, back to this recipe. Use Garlic salt not regular salt. This would be good with steak or hamburger.

Only change I would make is to treat the yucca like potato frites, and soak them. I slice the yucca and rinse in cold water. Then I soak the sliced pieces in a cold water bath for one hour. I pour out the soak liquid and replenish the bowl of sliced yucca with more cold water and soak for another hour. This will allow your frites to fry up in the pan with a crispy exterior that surrounds an airy and flaky center. It helps “de-starch” the yucca which makes for a less heavy treat. A spritz of lime on the finished product is a must!

You are missing the most important step in this recipe, boiling the yucca before frying. If you don't,  you will end up with yucca piedra, not yucca frita.

I have a very picky roomy and even he liked these. In fact, everyone liked them. I started mixing up the seasonings after a while though and I really liked lemon pepper on them the best (although I only tried a few different ones).
