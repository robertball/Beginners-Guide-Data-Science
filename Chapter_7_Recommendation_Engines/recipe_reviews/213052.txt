My family LOVED this dish!  I substituted the celery for Chicago-style green relish.  Easy and yummy!!

This recipe sounded good in theory but, had not much flavor, only hot dog. I know a Chicago hot dog does not have cheese but, cheese would have made this better tasting. I will not even try to play with this recipe, just not worth the time or money.

I will not make this again, just not my taste.  My family wasn't crazy about it either.

As a native Chicagoan, I am always eager to try out recipes that spotlight the city's signature fare. And this was actually pretty good! I had to make a few adjustments, however. I used celery salt in place of the seed (didn't have any), and the sport peppers. Normally they are a staple in my house, but we were completely out. And our oven hasn't worked in quite a while, so I decided to nuke everything for 2 minutes. It was quite delicious, better than I expected. Thanks for the recipe!
