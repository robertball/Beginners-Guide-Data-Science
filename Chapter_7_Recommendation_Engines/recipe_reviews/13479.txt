An excellent recipe. I cut the recipe in half. I used fresh pumpkin and substituted the following for the self-rising flour (1 c. self-rising flour=1 cup minus 2 T. regular flour, 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/8 tsp. salt). I will definitely make this again.

This recipe works great with Butternut Squash instead of pumpkin.
I just:
 * halved my Large Butternut Squash, and removed seeds.
  *Baked both halves (cut side down) in 1-2 inch deep water in the same  9" x 12" glass dish I made the casserole in, seen in the picture,
  * at 350 for 1 & half hrs, then I just left it alone, letting it cool in the oven.
Later, when you are ready to mix your casserole, just spoon out the Butternut Squash, being careful not to tear into the skin.
Don't bother measuring the squash out for this 'Easy Pumpkin (or Butternut Squash) Casserole' recipe, even if your squash is really large like mine was, it'll be great!!
