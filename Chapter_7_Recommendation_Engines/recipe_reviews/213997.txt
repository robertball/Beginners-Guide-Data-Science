EXCELLENT. I didn't have margarine and so I used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C canola oil. The cake is rich, moist, dense, and very chocolaty. The top does crack, but if you're careful, you can still have an attractive (and delicious) cake.

I am in two minds about how to rate this cake.  I had read other's reviews which said that the cake took ages to cook, and I intended to fill the cake anyway, so I decided to bake it in two shallow 9" pans instead of a 3" deep.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee.  

This is NOT a good chocolate cake.  The top didn't just crack, it created a crisp almost crusty top, while the inside was still bordering on gooey.  While trying to cut off the top, my husband commented that it looked more like brownies.  It then struck me that this is an AWESOME brownie recipe.  The dense, gooey texture of the "cake", the rich chocolate flavour and the crisp top is a 5 star brownie.  I only wished I'd baked it in square tins, as I ended up cutting it into squares.

5 stars as brownies, 3 stars as cake.

Hands down best Cocolate Cake I've ever made. I didn't have margarine, so 1 cup of Butter did the trick. I highly doubt and tweeking or changes would make this any better. Just follow the directions and there is no reason this shouldn't come out right for you, pictures comming soon!

I had a difficult time with this cake.  It took nearly two hours to bake and the inside, I feel, was still undercooked.  My springform pan was 8 1/2 inches and I have a convection oven so don't know if that was the problem.  Not sure if I would give it another try.

THIS CAKE TOOK SOO LONG TO MAKE. I put it in the oven for one hour and when i took it out it was still the texture of batter except the sides were starting to cook. THen i put it in for another hour and by the end of that it was okay but the inside was still a little to uncooked. I followed the recipe exactly so I don't know why this happened. I suggest putting more flour in the batter.

Had to rate in the middle on this one.  As a cake I did not care for it at all.  Baking time is way off and after almost two hours I pulled it from the oven.  The middle was still a bit gooey and the outside was hard enough it made cutting difficult.  As many said it is brownie like so next baking I made it as brownies and one word...AWESOME!

I followed the recipe closely but changed the baking temperature to 325 degrees in hopes that it would bake more evenly.  I even used a baking core and cake pan strips.  Unfortunately after 90min the top was crunchy like a brownie and the inside was apparently still VERY undone.  10 min after taking it out it had completely caved in on itself.

This is not one of our favorites for chocolate cake. But we did change it for a vanilla cake that came out good. All we did was omit the chocolate and coffee and add a Tablespoon of vanilla.

Flavor is great but the cooking time is inaccurate...no way this was tested!  After to hours it was still uncoiled in the middle!

I need some advice please. Loved this cake and it's a great way to use up extra eggs I may have in the fridge! My attempt turned out well except the outside was a little too hard for me. Perhaps because I didn't use the foil? Or perhaps I need to try it at a different temp and/or bake time?  Also, I usually don't have instant coffee in house so I'm thinking about substituting the coffee for cocoa next time. If anyone has some suggestions for me, it would be much appreciated!

Excellent cake, very dense and rich.  I frosted with sour cream chocolate frosting.  Worth the extra time it takes to put together.  I used butter (margarine, at least the kind with trans fats) should not even be sold in stores anymore, let alone used by bakers.
