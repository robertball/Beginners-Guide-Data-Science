I just finished making this recipe and it was very good.  I did not have any celery and I used 4 cup-a-soup packets, (I did not have the regular size).  I also was short on time so I just sauteed the sausage, bell pepper, onion, and almonds on top of the stove.  I cooked them until they were good and done and the moisture had evaporated.  I drained off the fat, added the rice, soup mix and the water, covered the pot and simmered about 40 minutes.  I stirred it every now and then and near the end I just let it sit so the bottom got nice and brown (I used a teflon pot).  I don't see why I can't just use chicken flavored Rice-a-Roni next time instead of the soup mix and rice.  It was a very flavorful dish.

My mamaw used to make this for me all the time growing up.  It was one of my favorite meals, and I am so happy to have it now.  This recipe is five stars with changes, four stars without.  First and foremost, for adult tastes, this is far better with hot sausage.  Also, once you have all your ingredients together on the stovetop, bring it to a boil and continue boiling for about three minutes, stirring frequently.  This reduces the baking time.  Next, pour everything into a 9x13 pan and bake uncovered on 350 for about 30 minutes.  My rice was tender, and all the liquid was absorbed after 30 minutes at 350.  If there are any leftovers, you'll find that this casserole is even better the second day!  Thank you so much.

I have this recipe but its called St Paul's Rice and its an excellent dish to bring to potlucks.  I use 2 packs of the dry soup mix for more flavor and bake in a 9 by 13 pan covered with foil.

Excellent recipe. The quantity was skimpy for a family dinner so I bumped up the rice to 1 1/4 cups, water to 5 cups and 2 envelopes soup mix....plenty for a hungry family

I made a short cut to this recipe because I did not have the 2 hrs for baking that it called for. I cooked the rice in the rice cooker, then put the rice in my pan of sausage, noodle mix,etc, mixed it all up, and poured it into a casserole dish and baked for 1 hour. The casserole turned out nice and moist, but, rather tasteless...at least for OUR Cajun mouths. My family asked me specifically NEVER to cook this again. LOL.

This is almost the same as the one my mom used to make, but she also had chicken in her's.  I followed your recipe exactly but then added 2 tsp curry powder like my mom's recipe.  WOW!! Yummy!

This was OK. Not something I would say, "Hey guys want that sausage casserole tonight?" For me to give 5 stars I have to think. Wow when can I make this again?

This recipe surprised me it was better than I thought it would be, and everyone else liked it also. The only thing I would do different next time is add some extra broth and a full cup of rice. I would also mix some almonds in addition to the topping and maybe try a spicier sausage.

We have been eating this as a Christmas/Thanksgiving side casserole for years.  My Mom always made it (We call it St. Paul's Rice) and holiday dinners are not right without it.  We use the hot sausage.  Our recipe calls for 3 chopped onions, 2 cups choppped celery a bag of sliced almonds are added into the mix and we use two  envelopes soup mix.  We simmer for a few minutes after the rice and water are added.  It's great to make ahead and keep refrigerated until you are ready to bake it.

Super Easy and Yummy.  The blahness comes from store-bought sausage...I had some great fresh ground pork, doubled it, the rice and the soup mix..boiled for a while and baked for about 25 mins.  Put cheese on top instead of almonds...super good.  Much like Sausage Stuffed Peppers, without the peppers.

Didn't look so good coming out of the oven, but was actually quite yummy!  I had ground pork, so I just seasoned it up with some Italian seasoning & salt.  I also added carrots to the dish, and it tasted great and added good color.

Made this last night - it was delicious! I followed some of the other suggestions (especially the one about adding the rice and letting it boil before baking to cut down on cook time - excellent!) I used Mild Italian sausage and it gave the whole thing this wonderfully spicy (yet not too much) kick to it that we found irresistible.  I also added carrots into the veggie mix to add a bit of color. Yummy!!

Love this unusual casserole. It did not take as long as stated in the recipe to cook it. My oven is a bit on the hot side though. Just watch it carefully.

I started making this recipe and then realized I was out of chicken noodle soup mix, so I used onion soup mix instead -- it was still really yummy!  I added corn since I didn't have any peppers on hand either :)

This was really good although like another reviewer I think adding chicken flavored rice a roni would give the same effect.  Any sausage would work well in this dish.  I also found the cooking temperature was a little high so I did a 350 oven and only cooked for an hour which was plenty of time.

My family enjoyed this casserole. I added sliced mushrooms and left out the celery because I didn't have any on hand. I used 1 cup of rice and 4 cups of chicken broth. Using the advice from another review I let the mixture come to a boil on the stove and simmer for about 10 minutes. Remaining cooking time was 1 hour in the oven at 350.

I make this recipe using a box of Uncle Ben's Wild Rice blend and adding a small can of mushrooms, one boiled or roasted chicken (remove meat from bone after cooking, discard skin, chop into 1/4" pieces), sage sausage.... It's a family favorite.  Personally I skip the almonds and peppers.

I added more rice than original recipe and didn't have an envelope of chicken noodle soup.  However, had a package of vegetable and worked great.

Thank you for this recipe.  I was very upset when I could not find it.  I have lost so many recipes in my last three moves.  My boys really liked this casserole when they were growing up.  It is such a nice change from the usual casserole dishes. My daughter in law does not care for green peppers but likes the red ones so I will try substituting them in the recipe.  I can hardly wait to make it.

My Mom made this for me when I was little, but I didn't have the recipe.  Thank you so much for posting it, now my kids love it too!  This is a great recipe for any season.
