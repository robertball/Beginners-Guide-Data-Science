Oh this was absolutely delicious.  I did halve the recipe for the two of us and baked it in an 8 x 8 dish.  Wow, it was soooo good.  Served it with Best City Chicken (AR) and steamed, buttered rice.  We both really enjoyed the combination, and I KNOW this will be made again and again.  Thanks, Paula!!

Originally, first made on 1/22/2012...
- We BOTH really liked this casserole! My husband does not usually comment, but he did this time. I used freshly grated Colby-jack cheese for the cheese sauce (good) because that is all I had... Thank you Paula and your grandma for this recipe!!

I'll make this again, it's quick to prepare and a good dish for a light, meatless supper. My vegetables cooked in 10 minutes, I used 1 tsp of Better than Bouillon in place of stock cubes. I made the sauce w/1 TBSP each of olive oil and butter, before baking I sprinkled the top with a few TBSP of panko crumbs that had been mixed with a drizzle of olive oil. I baked the casserole in a 7X11 pyrex dish for just under 20 minutes. Make sure you drain the cabbage and carrots really well before placing in the baking dish as they hold a lot of water. I put mine in a large wire strainer and pressed out any remaining liquid with the back of a serving spoon.

Made recipe exactly as written except used vegetable bouillon cubes.  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I will make again, but will most likely double it to freeze for lunches.

This recipe is fantastic -- I've made it twice in the last week and we've eaten it up -- it's so good I could drink it!  This will definitely be a staple in our home!  BTW I didn't change a thing!

If you like cooked cabbage, this recipe is for YOU.  These ingredients meld so well together.  I halved the recipe since there were only 2 of us, and we had plenty for lunch the next day also.  I served this with 'Grilled Chicken Wings with Sweet Red Chili and Peach Glaze', another AR recipe.  These 2 dishes went well together and we had a great dinner.  Thanks Paula for sharing your recipe, I'm really glad this recipe got published.

surprisingly yummy!  this will be on our regular list for sure.  it doesn't call for too much cheese so it's pretty healthy and the taste is really great!  a winner all around.  thank you!!!!!  I did use chili powder instead of paprika as that is all I had, turned out great.  doesn't even need salt which is surprising.  I did add a touch of pepper at serving time.

Clever way to make a meatless cabbage dish that is tasty, nutritious, and low calorie. Tasted the cabbage and carrots after coating with cheese sauce, and a bit more zing was needed to suit our tastes. Added sazon seasoning and a dash cayenne powder. Topped the casserole with herb seasoned bread crumbs and shredded cheddar cheese. This is a versatile dish, and easily customized to individual tastes and/or adding favorite ingredients. Used about a 60% red (1 medium)/40% green (1 small) fresh cabbage mixture mainly for the much greater antioxidant power of the red variety.

I definitely did not cook the cabbage for as long as instructed. I would say altogether this took about 30 minutes- I cut up the cabbage and started boiling it before tossing the carrots (and a parsnip) into the mix. I used homemade turkey broth instead of bouillon and mixed a bit of smoked paprika into the roux. Took it to a potluck and came home with an empty casserole dish. I call that success.

Very very good.  Don't boil the cabbage and carrots nearly as long as stated. (maybe less than half the time)  Otherwise follow the recipe.  I didn't add the paprika, but it sounds good.  (Maybe smoked paproka) ????

This was delicious!  Everyone loved it.  It had a very delicate flavor, the cabbage was not overpowering at all.  I followed the recipe exactly.  There was a little fluid in the bottom of my pan because I probably didn't drain it enough, but it still tasted wonderful.  I will definitely add this to the regular menu!

Yum, yum, yum.  My husband that hates cooked cabbage took seconds of this.    I added another large carrot because I just wanted more carrot, increased the sauce by 50% just because I wanted it saucier, used old cheddar for extra flavor and a dash of ground pepper to the sauce.  Yummy!

I rated this recipe 4 stars because we absolutely loved it, but I did make changes to it. I boiled the cabbage and carrots for about half the time, and added sauteed pork and onion that I sprinkled with garlic powder. I think it would be good with chicken as well. I didn't make any changes to the cheese sauce, and it was so good!!!

Easy and good. Perfect family style side. I used a bag of shredded cabbage and carrots, adding an extra carrot (I made a half recipe). I put in individual baking cups for a different presentation. Came together very well, I mixed it all up and refrigerated for a bit before throwing in the oven. Very economical too, thanks for sharing your recipe :)

Seriously? I can't believe how good this is! I used home made chicken stock instead of water and added cayenne pepper along with paprika. To die for! I did it over the holidays for the first time and have been craving this dish ever since! I'm going to the store, people! Can't wait to do it again tonight.

This is fabulous!  I only made half a recipe because my kids will never eat cabbage, but they loved it so much that we didn't have enough.  They even came back for seconds!  I am going to get more cabbage and make it again soon.

This is really good!  Followed the recipe to the letter, though I did use reduced fat cheese for health reasons, and I grated some black pepper on the top (along with the paprika).  Thanks for sharing, Paula!  I will make this again for sure.

2.18.15 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228366/cabbage-carrot-casserole/ ... Wow, I got an unsolicited "I like it" almost immediately from the girl child, 15.  I halved the recipe, not knowing if we'd have a hit.  Being me, though, since I'd already cut the carrots; measured the butter, flour, milk & cheese with the full amount; I guess you could say I halved the cabbage & paprika.  Yups & since I didn't have enough to fill the 8x8 dish, I added leftover angel hair pasta, 2c?  I sprinkled with panko, parsley & paprika.  It's homey, comfort food.  Good for winter.  Btw, I'd think the full medium cabbage (mine was 2#) wouldn't have a problem fitting in the 8x8/9x9.

Made this yesterday, to serve with our corned beef for St Pat's Day. It was a big hit!  I did not have any bouillon, so I increased the amount of water and cooked the cabbage/carrots with a onion soup packet, turned out great.

This was good but not 5 star, I daydream about making this again kinda of good.  It is a great way to use up the middle of the cabbages you cant get the leaves off of for cabbage rolls.  the creaminess of the cheese scratches that comfort food itch but at around 100 calories per serving it is not dangerous to you waistline.   It was a no go with my 2.5yr old surprizingly but I liked it and will prob make again.  when I was putting this together I fought the urge to put breadcrumbs over the top for some added crunch but next time I may give in to the pressure :)

I made this recipe with a cut-up turkey kielbasa as a main dish for me and my husband. It was very good, but needed just a little more "zip" as a main dish. Not sure what I'll throw in next time, as there will definitely be a next time!

Using fat-free milk, and a mere 2 oz of shredded cheddar cheese, this came out far richer than I expected which was awesome! It calculated to only 3 Weight Watchers PointsPlus per serving, too, which makes it even more awesome!  I did increase the spices and decrease the initial cooking time of the cabbage and carrots.

This was quite good.  We are not huge cabbage fans but we were given a head and we didn't want it to go to waste.  It taste like macaroni and cheese but with cabbage and carrots instead of noodles.

I followed the recipe  until I got to the very end. Then after I made the cheese sauce, I added one can of white chunk meat chicken and 1/4 of a cup of almond slivers and then poured over my cabbage and carrots and baked in the oven for 20 minutes.
I will definitely make this again as it turned out to be perfect for a cool night in Texas the only thing that I like to do different is serve it  with a side of white rice.?????

It was very good and I would definitely make it again.  This was my first attempt and wasn't sure how much cabbage to add, since I didn't check the weight of my cabbage.  The recipe calls for 2 pounds. Upon searching the internet -after the fact-  a medium head of cabbage is 2 pounds on average. I didn't use the entire head of cabbage- which I would definitely do next time.

Yes, we liked it. I found the white sauce tricky & took a long time to do that part. Otherwise it's easy & delicious. The white sauce is just something I don't make often & need to brush up on.

First, I forgot to add the cheese to the sauce and I doubled the sauce, but I don't think I needed to double the sauce.  I think the recipe needed more salt.  I am giving it a 5 stars because I think it needed the cheese in the sauce and not on top and that was my fault.  The recipe was easy and the dish looked nice.  Cabbage doesn't cost too much and it was somewhat healthy.  A nice side dish.

Very good recipe, my husband loved it. MashaAllah! I did use homemade chicken stock instead of bullion cubes. I also used freshly ground Einkorn flour to thicken the sauce. And I used Bergekäse (Mountain cheese)instead. It was very nice and a great winter comfort food for my recipe box.

Eh. Nothing spectacular. I guess I was expecting something that tasted different than steamed cabbage that you made on the stovetop. To me, baking it didn't add much of a flavor profile or make it any different that stovetop cabbage dishes.

There was leftovers, and we will be using it as stuffing for beirocks.

Good one, Paula!  I wanted to use a head of cabbage from Hubs' garden, and I wanted something other than slaw, so I selected this recipe.  I made this as written, but used chicken broth rather than bouillon and water.  And I couldn’t resist putting some lightly buttered panko over the top for a little crunch.  This was a nice change for us and we’ll be making it again!  Thanks, Paula!

This has become a go-to recipe for us. I typically follow the recipe exactly, using either green or red cabbage - whatever I have in the fridge, but I'll also throw in an extra carrot if I have it on hand.  It is always delicious, and quick/easy to prepare.  Thank you so much for sharing!
