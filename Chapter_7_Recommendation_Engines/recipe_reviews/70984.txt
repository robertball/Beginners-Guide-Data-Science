I normally shy away from recipes that call for canned soup or bottled sauces as an ingredient, but I was intrigued by all the good reviews this recipe got.  I should have followed my instincts.  Maybe it was the brand of alfredo sauce I purchased, but it was a well-known, high-end brand.  I should have tasted it before I dumped it into the pan.  It had no flavor that came close to alfredo sauce, and the texture was gluey, almost gelatinous.  I tried to fix it by adding some milk and some sauted onions and garlic, but it was no use.  My husband ate his, but then he'll eat anything. I definitely will not make it again.

This recipe was too perfect tonight! I was standing in the kitchen with a jar of alfredo in my hand wondering what to do with it. I checked here and this was #2- and I just bought some smoked sausage yesterday! I had the  Roasted Garlic Alfredo by Classico which gave it an interesting flavor. I'll definitely be making this again and I plan on trying it with different types of alfredo. I omitted any additional salt since alfredo & kielbasa can be salty all on their own. Try it with fresh grated parmesan cheese on top- yum! I thought about adding peas but opted to stick to the original recipe- I can't imagine it would taste anything less than delish!

This recipe was good.  I tweeked it just a little.  After I browned the sausage I took it out of the pan and then drained the fat and added 1tbsp of butter and a minced clove of garlic.  I sauted it for less than a minute.  Then I added the sausage back in, then the alfredo sauce and I used No-Yolk Kluski noodles.  It was very good.  My two year old son loved it!

I made homemade alfredo sauce and added chopped mushrooms, peppers, onion and garlic. I can't imagine using a jarred sauce when making a homemade one is so much better. With my additions, it was quick and tasty with enough for my husband to have seconds and lunch for me tomorrow. NOTE: This was a cheap dish to make. Buying most of the vegetables and pasta at Grocery Outlet and using coupons from the Sunday paper for the kielbasa, this made a very filling meal for very little.

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 but I think that ingredient choices could have something to do with that.  I used Ragu Lite Alfredo sauce and a turkey smoked kielbasa sausage.  I used mini penne pasta because that part didn't really matter.  The flavor was good, but the sauce I think was a little thick or rich even for a "lite" sauce.  I should have thinned it with some milk and/or dry white wine.  I did add garlic while sauteeing the sausage and also to the sauce.  I think some Italian flat leaf parsley would work with this and maybe even a smidge of spinach that is wilted in the pasta water. I may try that next time. This is a little bit like spaghetti carbonara, but I like the carbonara better.

Rating this low because the sauce in the jar is gruesome! I had some from a hurricane stash and needed to use it up. Wow, what a disappointment. Here's a wonderful recipe for homemade alfredo sauce, with ingredients you can pronounce! (unlike those on the jar.) Melt 8 tbsp real, unsalted butter in a large pan. Add 16oz heavy whipping cream, 3 cloves minced garlic, and stir well to combine. Let simmer until large, shiny bubbles form, then add previously sauteed mushrooms, and 5 green onions, cut up with scissors into tiny circles. Stir to combine, let simmer 2 minutes, then serve over your favorite cooked pasta. Simple, delicious, and amazing! You can also add sauteed shrimp or your favorite protein to round-out the meal. Happy cooking!

Very good and easy.  I used smoked sausage instead of polska kielbasa and used a four-cheese alfredo sauce.  Also used olive oil instead of butter to fry the sausage. Very similar to stroganoff.
Thanks for a winner!

This was really good!  Could be on the menu at Olive Garden!  I added some onions & mushrooms while the sausage was cooking.  Rinsed the alfredo jar with about 1/2 cup of white wine.  Simmered all that together while the bow ties finished cooking.  Family loved it!

Great product that can be prepared in short time. I used classico sun dried tomato alfredo sauce instead of plain alfredo sauce. Served with garlic bread and ceaser salad. Great Meal

This was good.  We used turkey kielbasa and a jar and a half of alfredo sauce.  We also used ziti because we didn't have egg noodles.  I think it worked well together.

Not bad. I used turkey kielbasa instead of regular, and even then there's no need to cook it in butter - it browns very nicely without it. Wheat pasta was also fine. But I recommend store-bought Alfredo sauce; I tried to use homemade but it clumped up when added to the pan. Would be nice to add some color, like bell peppers, peas, etc to the mix, or be sure to serve some on the side.

I used whole wheat rotini, and turkey kielbasa, and olive oil.  After cooking the kielbasa, I removed it from the pan then added and sauteed garlic, parsley and a little bit of chopped spinach.  I added the alfredo sauce to the pasta, with a bit more spinach.  Added the meat, and sauteed garlic and spinach, let it simmer long enough to heat the additional spinach and then enjoyed wonderfully satisfying and tasty meal.  Thanks so much.

I have made this recipe quite a few times and the key is to not use all the alfredo sauce and instead add some milk to thin it out a bit. Also, for a bit more flavor, saute some diced onion first and then put the kielbasa in that. It is so good! It's a favorite family dinner in my household.

Big hit for dinner, fried some onions before adding keilbasa to skillet.  After draining grease and removing keilbasa I fried up some garlic and butter in the same skillet before introducing everything together at the end.  I used small shells instead of egg noodles and topped of meal with parmesan and pepper flakes.  No leftovers tonite.  Buon Appetito!

I absolutely loved this dish! I followed it exactly, except for the salt and pepper. The sauce and kielbasa were salty enough. I used Bertoli Alfredo Sauce, which I like best. I used rotini noodles because I saw them in a picture for this recipe and they looked good! It was really great and simple to make. I made broccoli and garlic bread with it - yum! Will definitely be making it again. :) -Emalyn

this was quick and easy, but nothing too special-- it was inexpensive, too. Overall, though, wasn't too flavorful. Maybe would have been better w/ a flavored alfredo sauce.

I make the same thing but mines a little diff...I use 3 jars, 1/2 cup of cream, 1/2 cup parmasan & heat those together. I cut my kielbasa in thin slices then 1/4 them, fry them in olive oil, pepper & garlic. I alternate on my pastas. When my kielbasa is just to the almost crispy stage, I put the oil and all into the alfredo sauce, and continue warming it together. I serve this by mixing the 2 together, into a casserole dish, cover w/ more parmasan & put in the oven to melt all together.

This was pretty good. Not sure how the flavors would be together. But we love kielbasa and alfredo sauce separately so I decided to try it. Will definitely make again. This was a very quick meal!

Like most, I also did not think alfredo and kielbasa would go well together.  It was fabulous!  Leftovers were even better heated up for lunch the next day.  You can't go wrong with such a simple, yet delicious recipe.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe! The Kielbasa gives the alfredo a wonderful flavor! I made my alfredo sauce from scratch instead of a can which takes a little more time but definitely tastes alot better!!

Overall this was good, but it needed something.  I added some apple which I liked, but my husband thought was "different."  It was quick and easy and my kids ate it which is always a plus in my house!

Did not "wow" us.  I did not really like the Kielbasa mixed with the alfredo sauce.  Just did not think it went that well together.  Thanks for letting us try.

So sorry, but this one is not a keeper in our house.  Too salty for our tastes.

Upon first reading this recipe, I thought the combination sounded gross, but my kids thought it would be good and I needed something really quick to make.  It was certainly quick, and really tasty.  Normally I'd make my own alfredo sauce (so much for quick!) but the jarred kind can't be beat for convenience and it is easy to keep in the pantry for emergency dinners.  I added a cup of frozen peas to the sauce for color.

I also sauteed some fresh mushrooms with the kielbasa and added some minced onion and garlic while the meat was cooking. I didn't have any egg noodles, so I used bowtie pasta and it came out great. Thanks!

What an easy and tasty recipe! I just happened to have some leftover kielbasa and pasta sauce that I needed to use up (I actually used tomato sauce). I also used olive oil instead of butter and added some minced garlic for additional flavor. It turned out great even with these tweaks. I will definitely try it again with alfredo sauce, I'm sure it will be just as delicious!

Not a fan. Only because keilbasa is way too salty of a sausage for alfredo sauce. All you end up tasting is keilbasa, nothing else. It wasnt the best.

This dish was amazing! I made this for friends and they absolutely LOVED it! I used turkey kielbasa and made my own Alfredo sauce (using a recipe found on this site), and it was perfection. I never thought the two items (Alfredo and kielbasa) would taste good together, but it was a hit.

Definitely a keeper!  Although I didn't use jarred Alfredo sauce, there are some great recipes off this site.  I make the one using the cream cheese.  And I had some left over from the other night from another recipe, so I used that up.  This was quick and easy and delicious.  Those are the best kinds of recipes.

This is a good basic recipe. I think cutting the kielbasa lengthwise and then slicing would make more managable chunks of meat, and more easily serve more people. I fried it down on med-high, because I prefer a nice crust, but if I used medium as specified I think you could easily go without the butter. Made the kielbasa and Dianne's Crab off the site with a big batch of alfredo and pasta for lots of varied leftovers, yum. Will definately make again - thanks for sharing :)

What a nice change for kielbasa! We loved this! I added onions and mushrooms, sauteed along with the kielbasa. I used a sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce, and it seemed to add an extra nice taste. I had no egg noodles, and ended up using tri-colored rotini pasta. The dish came out yummy and colorful too! Thanks Kitram!

I love this recipe...it's simple and flexible and my daughter loves it, which definitely deserves five stars.  The only thing I do differently is use pasta instead of egg noodles and use two jars of alfredo cause I like it saucy.

Hi! I followed this recipe and my meal was delicious. I think your brand of kielbasa and alfredo.sauce make or break this meal. It's so easy it's a shame I didn't know about it sooner! I used Prego Alfredo sauce, and local brand kielbasa. I think it's a good meal and perfect for busy nights.

This is a great "because it's what I had" recipe. I used two boxes of penne pasta (because there are seven of us, and it's what I had), three jars of Alfredo, and black forest sausage. It definitely wasn't gourmet, but it was quick, easy, and one that everyone said they can't wait to have again! It's a great recipe for nights when everyone has hours of homework and each of the five kids has a different place to be. Thanks!

This was very salty and heavy. I made the recipe as is but added broccoli to lighten it up and I’m glad I did, it really needs it.  My boyfriend and I both felt a little queezy after due to the heaviness and fat.   I didn’t use any oil as the kielbasa and Alfredo sauce have enough fat.  Would not make again.

I followed the directions to a "T" until I decided to add shrimp, oregano and chopped cilantro.  I used All-Natural parmesan cheese.  I give this a recipe a 5-star rating.

I made this tonight, with a few modifications. First, i used all-beef smoked sausage, which has a great flavor. just before adding the sausage, i sautéed (frozen) diced onions and fresh sliced mushrooms, and after i added the sausage, I added in 2 cloves of garlic that i pressed in my garlic press. Then, I used a "top-shelf" jar of alfredo sauce, called Mario Batali Alfredo. (I chose it b/c it had no preservatives and was made with fresh cream). I used penne pasta, and it all turned out very well!  I will say that I've had this recipe as-written, with low-fat kielbasa and just a jar of cheap Alfredo, and it was very lack luster. Using beef smoked sausage and the onions, mushrooms and garlic, along with a high quality sauce made, all the difference. I think you must be judicious when selecting your sauce. it can make or break this recipe.

It's okay but not great. I added garlic and bottled roasted pepper, Parmesan and parsley at the end.

This is my recipe but i can't get back into my old name LOL...i recently added red pepper flakes to it and it gave it a nice little spice. Ill be adding the red pepper flakes from now on...not much..just enough to taint the alfredo sauce

Looking for a simple meal tonight. I made this 2 ways.  One for me and one for kids and hubby.  To mine I sauteed smoked sausage in pepper, onions and garlic and then added sauce & macaroni rings (because that's the pasta I had).  I thought it was very good.  Kids and hubby liked theirs with just alfredo sauce, rings and sausage.  i didn't use the whole jar of alfredo sauce.  I just added it until I liked the consistency with the amount of noodles I had.  I think it would have been too much if I used the whole jar.

This was rather strange. I actually like the flavor the kielbasa gave the sauce but I wasn't really a fan when I had to eat the meat. This was a super easy which I need on week night so I will probably make it again just for that reason. I might serve the meat on the side though instead of mixed in

Simple and quick. Used Bertolli Alfredo, added a little white wine that i had left in the bottle (less than 1/4 cup) and some garlic while cooking the meat. Boys liked it, nice quick meal

The only thing I changed was to use Penne Pasta.  The kids and my husband thought it was good, which earned 4 stars.  I gave it 5 stars since the family liked it PLUS it  is a super quick dish.

This was actually pretty good! And the ease factor makes it even better. I cut the kielbasa slices into quarters so there were just little pieces in there, and I used penne pasta. It reminded me a little of Carbonara, which is a creamy pasta with bacon in it. The picky kids ate it!

Family loved this recipe! Including my EXTREMELY picky 6 year old daughter who hates everything I make except for spaghetti or lasagna! Will definitely make again.

This turned out great! We added some peas into the recipe as well. This is a welcome addition to our recipe box!

This was a fast recipe, very filling and unique. It sounds really simple and dull so i didn't want to try it but the Kielbasa really adds a nice touch to this meal.I would definately make again.
