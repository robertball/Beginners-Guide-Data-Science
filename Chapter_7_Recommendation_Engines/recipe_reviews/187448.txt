I was looking for a recipe to use some pork tenderloin strips I had in the freezer. I hit the jackpot. I took this over to a casual family dinner and they said it was the best stir fry they had ever had. The only thing I ommitted was the ginger because I don't like it, and I put a few more carrots and only 2 red peppers but followed exactly otherwise. I used the Chinese noodles but a thin spaghetti would also work fine. Very very good. Thank you.

I made this last night with a couple of modifications.  I used spaghetti instead of chinese noodles because that is what I had on hand.  I also used fresh garlic and ginger- taste so much better then the dry.  I used green onions instead of the white- just personal preference.  I used only 1 Tablespoon of the sweet chile sauce and the rest I used the garlic chili sauce- we like spicy more than sweet.  Instead of napa I used regular cabbage because I had that on hand from a corned beef.  This is a forgiving recipe and you can really add or subtract your flavors, veggies and spiciness based on your personal preferences.  It made a HUGE amount of food.  Thanks for sharing.

Loved this receipe, had to use flank steak instead of pork. I thought the vegetabes and meat mixture was bland, but boy o boy, mixed in with the noodles the taste was outstanding.  The vegetables and meat took away some of the heat from the noodles. If you can stand it, the dressed noodles are good by themselves too.

I do like the versatility of this recipe.  It's adaptable to whatever meat/veggies you want.

One major change I would make if i were to make this dish again is to reduce the sweet chili sauce to less than 1/4 cup and the sesame oil to 1 Tbsp or less.  Sesame oil has a really strong flavor and you don't need a lot.  My dish was WAY too sweet and I'm surprised more reviews don't state that.

Definitely add more veggies if you have them on hand. Shitake mushrooms would be a good too.

This recipe is so versatile! Thank you! I used left over pork roast that was marinated asian style, fresh garlic and ginger because I had them on hand, and angel hair pasta. Love recipes that you can follow exactly or adapt to what you have on hand. The fiance licked his plate!

I didn't change the ingredients much in this dish except to use fresh garlic and ginger instead of dried.  I did change the way it is put together a little, though.  This recipe doesn't say what to do with the marinade, so I removed the pork and drained it well.  I seared the pork first in a very hot wok and then removed it from the pan.  Then  I browned the onions, peppers, celery and carrot (which I grated) before adding the pork back in along with the reserved marinade, simmered it a bit and then put in the cabbage and sweet chili sauce.  For the noodles I used half sweet and half hot chile sauce and cut back the sesame oil a little.  This was a bit labor-intensive with all the chopping, but we enjoyed it very much.  Thanks for the recipe, thriftybob.

This just sounds good but, not having a piece of pork in the house forced me to use chicken tenders which were already thawed. Simply put, outstanding. Loved the sauce; just right!

I joined a CSA this year and didn't know what to do with nappa cabbage and found this recipe.  Awesome, just awesome.  I substituted chicken breast. Just a nice heat...just as is.  If you really like heat...add more cracked red pepper to the saute.  I also used whole wheat angel hair pasta. It does make enough for 6...so cut back if you are cooking for less. Thanks "thriftybob".... I'm sharing this with my CSA!!

Wow, hubby & I really liked this, the kids not-so-much. Based on what i had available, unintentional or otherwise:), I made a couple of changes. I halved the sesame oil(ran out), deleted the carrots & red pepper flakes, & used green cabbage in place of napa. Just great w/the right amount of spice for me! I had pre-cooked a pork roast(cheaper cut) in the crockpot the day before & seasoned it with sesame oil, soy sauce, onion, garlic, & ginger. Wow-sooo good! I just cut it up/shredded & threw it in when the cabbage mixture was almost done. Thank you!

OUTSTANDING! I used Shrimp and added a few TBS of the noodle sauce to the shrimp to marinate before cooking. Had to sub ramen noodles and it still turned out good. cooked noodles beforehand and then let them sit to soak up the sauce. Napa cabbage tasted awesome in this. Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent recipe. Everyone including the mild tongues loved it! I used rice noodles and did not change anything in the recipe. I chopped everything the night before and keep the onion and cabbage separate.

Super duper!  Didn't change a thing.  But, used fresh garlic & ginger.  I'm not a sweet-lover and I thought this was very good... made a double helping just for myself!  p.s.  found a sweet chili sauce recipe online and made my own...real easy.

This recipe made a delicious dinner, like homemade take-out! 5 stars for flavor, 4 stars for method. After reading the directions, I made some changes.  I felt that if I just added the carrots, peppers and celery to the wok after the pork was browned, they would still be pretty ‘hard’ when plated, or the pork would be overcooked. I chose to start by partially stir-frying the veggies in a bit of oil (excluding the napa cabbage) just until they began to lose that hardness, then set them aside. I added them back into the wok along with the cabbage after the meat was browned. They were the perfect tender crisp at serving time. The only other change I made was to add a bit of ginger and fresh garlic to the marinade for the pork, and let the meat marinate for a few hours.  I also removed everything from the wok with a slotted spoon, before adding the cornstarch slurry to the juices in the pan. The sauce for the noodles was perfectly delish and not too sweet. I think it totally depends on which brand you choose for the sweet chili sauce, my sauce was sweet and spicy because I chose a sweet spicy (Asian) chili garlic sauce. The ketchup type American sweet chili sauce would be a huge mistake! I will make this again, using chicken next time.

The pork tenderloin stayed very tender and the dish tasted very authentic.  I was happy to sneak some fresh veggies into my kids as well.  By the way, I dropped the amount of red peppers and carrots to make it more friendly for my kids.

Made to the recipe exactly and thought it was fantastic. Seems to be even better as leftovers with the flavors melting together. It did make a ton of food however, 6 servings is no joke, I'm going to be eating this for awhile.

I really loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as stated.

The only thing I might do next time is skip the cornstarch.  I felt it made the sauce a bit slimy.

Other than that, I will definitely make again.

This was pretty good. My husband loved it which is rare with stir fry so that was good. I made a lot of substitutions but only because I did not have all of this on hand. I used ramen noodles, no seasoning; shrimp, snow peas, mushrooms and in addition to the garlic powder, one clove of garlic.

Really delicious.  I was missing some of the ingredients, so I substituted rice for noodles and added green onions.  It came out great and I"ll definately be making this again!

I loved this dish! Its different from your traditional stir frys.  I made very few changes.  
1) I used whole wheat thin linguini bc I had it.  
2) I didnt marinate the pork and it was still great but I probably would be better with a little soy marinade.  
3) I used spicy thai chili sauce so I didnt add any red pepper flakes. (It was plenty spicy) 
4) I didnt add the water/cornstarch bc I thought it was fine without it. 
5) I reserved 1/2C of the noodle sauce and just added it to the vegetables when cooking instead of adding more chili sauce separetly. 
TIPS: use store bought shredded carrots to make it even faster...or even a package of coleslaw mix with cabbage in it too!  I also added french style green beans for more veggies and it was a great addition.

For some reason, we did not enjoy this mix of flavors.  I did omit the pork from this dish because we had a separate pork dish.  I cannot imagine this would make so much of a difference?

This was very good.  I had left over pork and I could not figure out what to do with it until I came across this recipe. The modifications I made was that I used a bag of broccoli slaw and added red bell peppers to it and ramen noodles instead of chinese noodles.  Very tasty.

This was SO tasty!  I often try to make Asian style recipes at home and find they fail to deliver on flavor without calling for all kinds of ingredients I rarely have on hand.  This one was loaded with flavor.  The substitutions I made were to use chicken instead of pork, and soba noodles instead of chinese noodles (these taste very similar to whole wheat spaghetti, which several other reviewers substituted).  I also made my own Thai sweet chili sauce from a recipe online since I didn't have any.  My cooking technique varied just slightly, since I was starting with uncooked skinless bone-in chicken pieces.  I added these to the pan with the oil, red pepper, and onions until they browned nicely on each side.  Then, I stuck them in the oven at 375 until they were 160 degrees on a thermometer.  I shredded the chicken and mixed it, along with the noodles, back into the stir fry and served.  Yum!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made this with Thai rice vermicelli and changed some of the veggies around. (Celery is not a favorite in stir-fries here.) My store had no Napa cabbage this week, but a bag of coleslaw mix served me well in this. The only truly unique ingredient here is the Thai sweet chili sauce, and that is what makes this stir-fry a star recipe. I found my 12-inch skillet to be inadequate to handle this volume of vegetables and left most of them raw in a salad bowl, mixed with the dressing from AR's "Soccer Salad" which is my go-to for Asian-style cabbage slaw dressings (though there are better versions, that one is the simplest and easiest to whip up in a hurry). We found this stir fry excellent served over our raw extra veggies. Thank you, thriftybob, for coming up with something interesting to do with pork loin, which always comes in too big a roast for one sitting!

the recipe wasn't bad by any means. it wasn't the best recipe ever but it wasn't bad. my only concern was the nutritional value. after i made and ate it i started to realize that it probably wasn't the healthiest choice. i practically used a whole bottle of sweet chili sauce and thats a lot of sugar right there. so the recipe was good, but not so sure if i'd make it again.

YUMMMY!  My guys loved this and the 5 year old said that I need to make it the next time his aunts are over.  The recipe is great as is, but the guys thought it would be ever better with a little peanut butter.  So, we tried and sure enough, it's awesome with a little PEANUT BUTTER.  I think I may add 1/3 as the sauce is thickening next time.

This was just okay for me, but I think because I didn't like the brand of sweet chili sauce I purchased.  Given the quantity in the recipe, that would make a big difference.  So I'm rating four stars instead of three (my usual for 'okay').  I will try this again with a different sauce, or make my own.

These were really good!  Only made the noodle (used thin spaghetti btw) and vegetables because we had chicken on the side.  My daughter thought these were a bit sweet for a noodle dish.

So delicious!  The noodles tasted amazing and the recipe is flexible for whatever you have on hand (I substituted marinated fish for the pork).  A great way to use some of the chinese cabbage I got from my CSA.

It was sweet and it was spicy, it just wasn't for us. It smelled great but maybe it was the ginger? Maybe the Thai sweet red chile sauce? Sorry, this didn't suit our tastes. It was fast and easy though as far as cooking goes once the prep and chopping was finished. Thanks, I had fun fixing a new recipe. :)

On a recent outing to the local farmer's market to get fresh milk, the hubby picked up napa cabbage. Having never cooked with napa cabbage I found this recipe. DELICIOUS!!!! The whole family loved it! I had a hard time finding the sweet chili sauce, but ended up using Tabasco brand Sweet & Spicy and used a lot less. It still turned out terrific! Also, I used whole wheat spaghetti instead of Chinese noodles.

Outstanding and easy.  Ready in well under 45 mins as I used frozen pre-cut vegetables and rice noodles which only require 2 mins cooking time.

I thought this dish was just ok.  I liked the fact that it had a lot of veggies however, it was just too sweet.  If I do make it again I will cut back on the sweet chili sauce and add a little more heat.  Also, I thought the meat was a little dry.

Prepared the meat/veggie combo only - with hot chili sauce instead of sweet - and served over brown rice. Very good.

This turned out ok. I used flank steak rather than pork, which picked up the soy sauce marinade very well. For some reason the sauce wouldn't thicken up as much as I thought it should so it was a bit runny. My husband loved it though!

I didn't change one thing in this recipe (other than cutting it in half) and it was delicious! The whole thing was really good, but the noodles were the best part. I think this would go great with chicken as well. Be warned though - it makes a ton of food. I got at least 4 servings out of the half recipe.

This was yummy! I only used 1 Tbsp of sesame oil in the noodle sauce to cut back on the greasiness. It worked well. I also used leftover pork tenderloin, which I added at the very end, along with the cabbage, and cooked just until heated through.

This meal was excellent! I highly recommend it to anyone that loves Thai food. The only thing I modified was adding peas instead of celery and then throwing the peas and the cabbage in at the last minute so it didn't cook down too much or lose color.

This was ok but kind of one dimensional. I would use fresh garlic and ginger if I were to make this again. Too many veggies to actually stir fry at once. You really need to cook them in batches, otherwise, you're steaming them. The kids did like this, but really liked the incredibly sweet pasta most. I would also suggest adding fresh hot chilies instead of flakes. Siracha was a good addition for those who like it spicier.

Not bad. Flavor was good but i could taste/feel the oil on my lips while eating this. Next time i think i will reduce the oil or elimnate it all together. I used fresh canton noodles to keep it more authentic.

Made this awhile back, but wasn't a "rater" at that time. Anyhoot, this is sooo good. Ofcourse a cook is going to make seasoning adjustment to meet their taste, but the ONLY major change I would make next time (and there definately will be a next time) is using regular cabbage, opposed to napa cabbage, as the napa cabbage was a little too wilty for me. Thank u, love this stir fry!!

OMG -- this was amazing.  So easy and I found a use for my leftover cabbage.  After reading other reviews I anticipated it being rather sweet so I reduced the amount of chili sauce for the noodles and increased soy sauce slightly.  The only other alterations I made were to use a mix of coloured peppers, fresh ginger and garlic, double the amount of chili flakes (our family likes spicy!) and added half a cup of chicken broth to the veggies when cooking -- without this I can't imagine how gooey the sauce would be after adding the cornstarch.  Delish -- my fussy family of four LOVED it.  We WILL be having this again! Thanks for submitting.

It is probably my fault as I used sriracha sauce instead of the sweet chile sauce but I found the noodles made with the chile sauce alone a little monotonous in flavor. The pork mixture is tasty though.

Made as written - except that I sliced up some left over cooked pork tenderloin (just added it in a little later in the recipe), rice noodles (soaked as per pkg instructions)because that's all I had on hand, and regular cabbage because again, that's all I had on hand.  Overall this was an excellent recipe, though a little on the dry side.  Next time I'll double the amount of water (but using chicken stock instead) to make it a little saucier.  We don't like things overly spicy but this recipe suited us to a T.
I'll be making this again.  It was quick and easy to prepare and just one pan to wash up!

I made this dish and thought it was delicious.  It's felt fresh because all the veggies but yet it was spicy from the sweet chili sauce.  I also used fresh ginger because I think that adds a lot of flavor.

This recipes uses a few more bowls and steps than I currently have the patience for.  However, it has lots of flavor and I love the variety of vegetables used.

When the recipe calls for sweet chili sauce dont substitute regular chili sauce for it. I made that poor judgement call and it was so hot I couldnt eat it, I had to throw it out.  Next tme imake it I wil read the directions more carefully.

This woulda been perfect with a little less sesame oil.  A little too much for me.  I did use spicy chili sauce (we love spice) and I also used whole wheat spaghetti (all I had).

Definitely not a 5 star recipe.  I served it for a small dinner party and everyone thought it was just mediocre.  The pasta is the only part that had a nice flavoring to it.  I would make it again, but it will call for some changes.

Great idea! I've used sweet chili sauce for years without really thinking of using it for stir-fry (doh!). I cut back on the red bell pepper and onion, and used pork tenderloin because I had some. I also used thin spaghetti because I prefer the texture to rice noodles, and added sesame oil to the mix. This was delicious and super easy - I'll definitely do it again. Thanks!

OUTSTANDING! This recipe is restaurant quality. It is the best Asian recipe I have ever made at home. I used angel hair pasta and omitted the red bell peppers and celery. My tip is to cut the pork and make the marinade first. Then chop all the vegetables while marinading. So good!

This was a great find it turned out superb. Though I did make some changes I did not use carrots I replaced them with bok choy. I used fresh minced garlic and fresh ginger. I also used 3 tiny bell peppers that were yellow red and orange due to wanting that to have a more subtle bell flavor!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it has 4.5 stars already and I do not want to alter the consensus. But I did not follow this recipe. I followed the meat marinade, the chili/soy sauce for the noodles, and the additional chili sauce/thickener at the end. I completely changed the vegetables and spices. I ended up with a delicious sweet chili sauce dish, which is totally different from the Asian entrees I usually make. Thanks for what I consider wonderful tips on how to properly use sweet chili sauce.

I did not have any sweet chili sauce so just used a combo of chili and hoisin sauce.  Probably more heat than there should of been but still came out pretty good. Loved the veggie noodle combo.

This was a bit of prep work but worth it for this stir fry. I had to use green cabbage but that worked just fine. 
Made the recipe as directed. It was sweet but spicy. I used a bit of Sambal Oelek for the spice as well. I will make this again. The family enjoyed it

Made this today. Since I am cooking for two, I used 1/2 lb finely shaved pork. Used only 3 TBSPs soya sauce and 1 TBSP oyster sauce for marinade. I minced two cloves of garlic and 1 TBSP of fresh ginger half of which I added to the marinade. I also tossed in the red pepper flakes in with the meat and let it sit while I chopped veges and made noodles. I cooked 1/3 of a pound of chinese egg noodles. While the noodles were cooking I sautéed the remaining garlic and ginger in 1TBSP sesame oil, then added 1/4 cup chili sauce, then tossed with drained cooked noodles. I cut  up 2 cups of napa cabbage, (what I had left in the fridge) sliced one small carrot thin, one smaller stalk of celery sliced thin, 1/2 a small onion, 1/2 cup each of sliced red and green pepper. I heated 1 TBSP peanut oil and 1/2 TBSP sesame oil and stir fried meat until just cooked and still slightly pink, then removed from pan. I then stirfried onions, carrots and celery for one minute adding meat juices from reserved meat. Added peppers, meat, cabbageand 1 TBSP chili sauce and stirfried for another minute or two, then added noodle mixture. Mixed 1 TBSP cornstarch with 1/4 cup of chicken broth tossed in the pan and stir fried until sauce was thickened and stirfry hot.  Served with finely chopped green onion. This recipe as I have noted would serve three or four. It was delicious. I think with the original proportions the recipe would be equally delicious, except use fresh ginger and garlic and chicken broth. It

Yummy.  However, don't do what I did.  I used 1/2 cup of sweet chili sauce and 1/4 cup chili garlic sauce and crushed red pepper in the sauce and let it sit all day.  The noodles were so spicy that we ate them with tears running down our face because they were still good.  I think 1 onion and 1 red pepper is plenty.  Anything more would be overpowering.  Next time, I would add more cabbage.

Made it with bok choy as I could not get nappa cabbage. I thought it was a very good recipe. I used udon for the noodles. Bf gave it 4 stars as he would have liked shiitake mushrooms and more spice (for me was perfect spice). I will make it again.

Such a lovely flavour to this sauce. Easily made from store cupboard ingredients. It was quite spicy, which the family enjoyed. I really liked putting the sauce on the noodles - I’ll use that method again for any noodle dish, but I’m sure I’ll be back to use this recipe again. Maybe next time I’ll photograph it before I eat it!

I used veggies I had: mushrooms, onion, carrot, broccoli,  yellow pepper, and a can of bean sprouts. I'm a bit of a sugar bear but this was a little sweet even for me. I would make it again but I'd look for a way to dilute the sweet chili sauce in some way. That being said, I enjoyed it

I used chicken breast instead of pork and served it over quinoa instead of noodles. I reduced the sauce intended for the noodles by half and add 1 Tbs of chili paste (my husband loves spicy) I didn’t have cabbage so I added fresh broccoli. A completely different spin on this recipe, but it was delicious cutting out the carbs and adding the fiber. I love easy recipes that result in a lot of flavor.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe, and make it often. I have a pantry full of homemade pepper jelly and I found it works well for a substitute for sweet Thai chili sauce. When I make the noodles, I combine them with the stir fry before serving. I also sub real ginger and garlic for the powder. The fresh ginger flavor really adds so much to this recipe.

I used chicken and didn't have any bell peppers, otherwise I made it exactly as written. The cornstarch added at the end is really essential. The dish was fantastic and my husband asked that I add this to my usual dinner rotation!

Yum! Fast, simple, and easy too. Budget friendly tip, I made a big batch of my own Thai sweet chili sauce following a recipe from this site since I like avoiding preservatives, coloring, msg etc. and it was way cheaper than the bottled stuff, plus there was tons left over for later.

Delicious!  I left out the red pepper flakes because I was worried it would be too spicy, but I'd probably include them next time.  Without the flakes, there is only the tiniest hint of heat that you wouldn't notice unless you're paying close attention.  Also I wasn't sure whether to include the soy/garlic marinade when I cooked the pork, so I did.  I think this was the right call.  There would have been no sauce without it.

This was pretty easy and quick to put together and tasted really good. I used snow peas, mushrooms, red onion and red pepper for veggies. I didn't add the water and corn starch but otherwise followed the recipe. This is a good recipe to play with using different meats (pork, chicken, steak), different veggies and different starches (noodles, angel hair, rice).

All five members of my family loved this!  I have a daughter who has crohns and I was able to pull out a flavorful dish for her and then added the spiciness in at the end for the rest of the family. The heat was great even though it wasn't able to marinate as long.

Made this according to the directions, and was quite pleased with the result.   I was nervous that adding the stir fry to the standing noodles would result in a lukewarm dish, but the stir fry reheated the noodles nicely.  I would make it again, although the large amount of chili sauce used in the recipe makes it a little pricey.

A dinner my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed.  I did make a couple of changes due to what I had on hand.  I used spaghetti noodles in place of the Chinese noodles, and green peppers in place of the red peppers.  I sliced the meat in the morning and soaked it in the marinade all day.  My sweet chili sauce was a jalapeño sweet pepper from an AR recipe I had canned.  The flavors blend well together and the extra added heat gave it a great punch.  
I halved the recipe and cut back on the sesame oil, as I find it can be very overwhelming and didn't measure the veggies.  I know there were more than the recipe called for, and it worked well.  A nice change for a stir-fry using the napa cabbage.  This recipe is a keeper, in our house.  Thank you.

This was so good!!! Instead of using a pork tenderloin, we bought lean boneless pork chops and trimmed/sliced them.  Also, we only had 8 oz Chinese noodles, but that turned out just fine, with a nice amount of sauce to coat and flavor them.  Heat the noodles for a few seconds in the microwave before adding the stir fry so everything is steaming hot.

Oh my this is sooo good! I skipped the marinate part and velveted the pork instead. Using what I had I subbed olive oil for sesame, beans for cabbage & used a full cup of chicken broth rather than water which worked perfectly for us. Next time I'll add peanuts or sesame seeds. This one's a keeper!

Excellent Dish - we have 10 kids so had to adjust for a much larger quantity.  We added yellow and orange peppers to the red peppers, cut down on how much chili sauce was called.  Also mixed in some red cabbage to give it some variable color.  thanks for the recipe.

Great! Added green pepper and shiracha chance since it wasn't spicy enough for me. Also threw an egg on top. Nice and sweet and flavorful! The cabbage and pork were great.

We loved this recipe. I used rice flat noodles, since that is what my store had, and I am glad, because I prefer them over other asian noodles. (Rice flat noodles are what are used in dishes like Pad Thai) We had less sweet chili sauce than called for, so it was only used on the noodles. We topped our servings with siracha and yum! Absolutely loved it. Flavorful and simple and healthy.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I added some diced up jalapenos because I had fresh ones from the garden. I found the recipe because I had a ton of napa cabbage and was thrilled with how it turned out.

This turned out okay. I used slightly less chili sauce because of some reviews, but felt like it could have stood a little more heat. I forgot to thicken with the corn starch, which I think would have helped with the overall feel of the dish.

bf really liked this.. i thought it was alright.. i think this was just a different flavor profile than what i normally like to make.. i'm not big into sweet but i wanted to try this out b/c i'm sometimes pleasantly surprised.. this wasn't bad.. i just wasn't overly impressed.. i'd give this a 3.5 if it was an option

I made this last night for dinner and we enjoyed it very much.  We don't like a lot of sauce with pasta or stir-fry so I did tone down the amounts of liquid ingredients by 1/3rd.    Also, I didn't use as much sweet chili sauce (which we LOVE the flavor of) because my husbands tummy can't handle a lot of heat.   It was still very good and I'll make it again.   The sesame oil makes this dish, so don't leave it out.

You know it's a good recipe when your husband goes back for seconds, thirds and even a small fourth helping! I admit I changed up this recipe slightly to fit my needs this evening. I used a bake-in-the-bag Asian Ginger pork loin. While that was baking, I chopped and sauteed all my veggies (a small onion, a red pepper, a green pepper, some shredded carrots and a half head of regular cabbage). I used udon noodles because that's what I had. I sauteed all my veggies together with the spices suggested in the recipe, but used my own measurements. Once the pork was done and slightly cooled, I shredded it due to personal preference and then tossed the udon noodles with the sweet chili sauce (which was surprisingly spicier than anticipated!), teriyaki sauce (didn't have soy) and garlic powder. I then added the noodles directly to the pork/veggie mixture so I could combine it all together. Since it was spicier than anticipated, I added a 1/2 cup water mixed with a little chicken base since it would tone down the spice factor a bit and add the saltiness I felt it needed. It was the perfect amount of sauce and my husband and I LOVED it! I just rinsed some of the noodles and pork for my 4 year-old DD since it was still too spicy for her tastebuds. DH spiced up his portions with Slap Yo Mama hot sauce, while I used a scant bit of Sriracha on mine. Yummy!! Will defnitely make again!

This is one of the best recipes I've ever made from this website.  The first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly and it was amazing.  Every time I've made it since, I've improvised and added things we have in the vegetable drawer and it's always just as good, if not better.  LOVE this recipe!
