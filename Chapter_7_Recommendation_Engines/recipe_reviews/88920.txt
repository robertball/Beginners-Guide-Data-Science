Really nice. Easy, light, and flavorful. I think it would have been even tastier had I used the called-for fresh basil instead of the dried I had on hand. Be sure to chop the veggies into smaller bite-sized pieces.

I had never really eaten zucchini before, so I figure this little recipe was a good way to introduce it into my diet. I tried it on top of a romaine mix salad as well as on top of a turkey burger (instead of pickles and tomatoes). Either way, it was good stuff.

Since I'm not a big fan of raw zucchini and onions I decided to try this in the skillet.  Seasoning was wonderful and the vegetables complement one another well!

Amazingly simple and so flavorful. And I have discovered it can be adjusted to complement other dishes. I made it with brown sugar instead of white sugar and it went very well with "Grilled Salmon I" from this site.

I really liked it but made a couple changes. Added a little olive oil, and used red onion instead. But I think it was way too much onion (next time I will omit them altogether) But I'm not a big raw onion person. I used dried basil too and it was still pretty good. A great way to add more raw veggies to you life!!

I'm disappointed with the final product, it was nothing like I imagined [hoped rather]. Bell peppers, onions, and zucchini should be alive and springy, And this actually tasted like a cold leftover pasta dish.  Maybe a touch of dill instead of basil? I'm willing to investigate.

This has great flavor and lasts for a long time in the refrigerator.  Goes with everything, even a side dish with meats. I will be making this recipe again.

This relish would be great on hotdogs (shread instead of chop the zucchini).  My kids will normally only eat zucchini raw if they can dip it in ranch dressing, but they loved this.  On my second batch, I added some leftover diced tomatoes and had to use green onions instead.  The family liked that even better.

I'm still deciding if I like the taste of raw Zucchini or not, but this was pretty good for raw.  I used one tsp. of Diabeti Sweet (an artifical sweetener)and it was sweet but not overpowering.  I can't imagine using a whole tablespoon of sugar substitute or sugar in this recipe.  I want to try it next time with fresh basil and just a touch of olive oil.  The dried basil does work but I'm sure the fresh will be better.  I also subsituted pimentos for the red bell peper only because I didn't have any fresh bell pepper, it's the same thing worked out fine.  It looks very pretty.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I use red onion and don't have any concept of measuring... but serve this over salmon burgers or grilled salmon and it is to die for!!! I occasionally substitute tarragon for the basil also. And Cucumber for zucchini... it's a very versatile recipe. I also don't chop, I grate the zucchini.

Yummy, very good with some dried dill. The only other change was I used red onion and green pepper because that is what I had.

This is a tasty recipe as a side dish.  You really do need to use the fresh basil because raw zucchini doesn't have a great taste. I have fresh basil in my garden and this recipe is unusual and good. I don't think I would try to use it at a picnic, though, because it's just too different.

I have made this many times, it is a favorite in our house.  Goes with so many entrees.  I cut back on the sugar by half and always add jalapeño pepper and a finely chapped garlic.

This relish was fabulous! What a great and easy way to use raw zucchini, especially when you have quite the abundance from your garden. I turned this more into a side salad by adding halved cherry tomatoes and even some cucumber. I just increased the dressing amount. Very tasty!!!

Refreshing, was great with salmon and talapia.  I even threw in some avacado .
