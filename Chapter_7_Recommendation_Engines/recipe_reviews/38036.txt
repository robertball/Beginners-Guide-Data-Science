This delicious soup was rich and creamy tasting even without the cream. I simply added extra broth after it was blended to adjust the thickness.   I also added 3/4 cup of chopped celery and an extra potato to the cooking pot, along with a pinch each of dried parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme. (Sing while you add these!)  I was afraid at first to tell my teenaged son what I was making for dinner, but he helped, and the whole family loved the results.

This was delicious, but trying to stay low fat I did not add heavy cream to the soup. Instead after ladling into the soup bowl I added a dollop of low fat sour cream and garnished with a brunoise of radish. I also use fresh radish tops mixed into tossed salads it gives it a nice texture.

Another "wanted to use my radish greens instead of just throwing them out." I substituted milk for the heavy cream, which is a bit of a stretch but my goal was to combine ingredients on hand with radish greens into something edible, and this recipe met that goal admirably. Also, since potatoes, onions, and milk are all cheap, and the radish greens were "free", this made for an inexpensive side dish. And tasty as well. I will definitely be making this with our radish tops from now on!  UPDATE: I have to change this to five stars because my wife has started buying radishes just so we can make this soup. She doesn't like radishes though, so now we're eating the tops and throwing away the radishes. Not what I had in mind when I searched for this recipe!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly except for two things: I only let it simmer for 20 minutes, instead of 30 (I was short on time) and I didn't have any heavy cream on hand so I used 1/2 cup of raw whole milk, which has high cream content, so it worked well.  You could probably cut the cream out if you wanted to cut some calories, but the milk did make it a bit creamier.  I'll never throw my radish tops out again!  This is now one of my husband's favorite soups - mine, too!

This soup tastes much better than it looks while cooking! Resembles spinach soup, and one would never guess it's radish.

I altered the recipe a lot to use up what I had at home.  I used milk ( instead of cream.  I also added several radishes to the pureed mix to use them up, but I had no potatos so it was not as thick. I sauteed some onions, carrots, and celery and added them to the soup to give it some bulk.  It was delicious, and I'm sure I could pass it off as spinach and no one would know.  (Everyone was appalled when I told them I made radish soup)  I think this recipe is great because radishes are so cheap.

Wow, who knew you could eat radish greens? By themselves I find them too bitter but in this soup they were good. I wanted a more potato soup kind of outcome, so I added a few more potatoes, chopped celery, about 2 TBS of minced garlic (I like garlic) and about  1 cup of chopped garden herbs (dill, lemon thyme, sage, rosemary). If you want more of a "punch" I'd follow the other reviewer's suggestion to add hot sauce, but if you're anti-spicy like me and just want to use up a ton of garden herbs and radish tops, you can't go wrong.

LOVED this! The radishes in our garden had rather gotten away from us -- more leaves than roots, so I went looking for "tops" recipes (I knew they had to be edible somehow!) and I found this!  I subbed bacon fat for the butter but skipped the heavy cream, and subbed homemade turkey broth for the chicken broth. I also cooked the onions past "tender" because carmelized onions make everything better, IMHO.  I used a couple of larger potatoes and I didn't bother to measure the greens; I just threw in everything I had.  I also skipped the radish garnish -- the leaves were older and huge, and the roots were inedible. I pureed half for me and left the other half chunky for DH and we both liked it.  He added salt; I did not.  Might add cheese next time; might add pepper.  Or not!  Either way, this recipe is now in our "garden rotation." Thanks so much for sharing this!

Wasn't sure what to expect and this was wonderful! Even my uber-picky husband likes it!! Followed recipe to a tee, just added garlic and it was perfect.

I've made this so many times. My kids love it. (I call it Green Potato soup because if they knew it was radish greens, they wouldn't eat it.) I've used milk, yogurt, sour cream, cream, or buttermilk, whatever I have on hand. Other than salt, I usually don't add any seasonings; maybe pepper if I'm running at little light on the greens.

I really enjoyed this unusual soup.  I am a Peace Corps volunteer in Guatemala so I have to cook with what is cheap and locally available so radishes fit the bill!  What a creative use for radish tops.   I added some cilantro.

This is a great soup. I added a touch of Green Tabasco and just a little cellery salt.

Tasted nice and ... green.  I added milk, probably about two cups to make it a drinkable soup.  Good cold, too.

This tastes sooooo good and sooooo healthy. I didn't add the cream at all. It doesn't need it. I did add just a bit of salt while it was simmering (probably just less than a tsp, just to bring out the flavor). I highly recommend this recipe and I also highly recommend tasting it after putting it thru the blender. I don't think you'll want any cream either. I will make this over and over again.

This soup is amazing!  I tried it before I added the cream and it would have been just fine without it.  I also didn't add the radishes on top, still fantastic.  Even my picky eater liked it!!  I also added up how much it approximately cost to make...approximately $3.50 for the whole batch!!!  That would increase minimally if you had to buy your radishes, mine came from my garden.

This was very tasty and filling.  I used a little half and half and a little 2% milk instead of heavy cream and the soup came out very heavy.  I also added a very small garlic clove, and because I had no chicken broth, a mixture of water and white wine.  It's also good with Parmesan cheese grated over the bowl.  I would make this again, and probably add a mixture of other salad greens. I'll never throw out radish greens again.

I've been growing radishes and thought it rather sad that I couldn't use the tops(well, there's always compost) in dishes. Decided to see if I could find something here and boy am I glad I did! If you don't have heavy cream on hand, you can always used sour cream. I can't wait to try this during winter, so yummy!

Suprisingly good, again reminded of thick, creamed spinach soup. Even my husband liked it - whose sometimes iffy on new veggie recipes. Doubled the radish greens (2 bunches and 4 potatoes) but kept rest of recipe proportions the same. Used regular full fat yougurt, as didn't have cream on hand. Added a tablespoon of curry and teaspoon of black pepper for an extra bit of flavor.

An excellent, easy soup that I will definitely be cooking whenever I have radish greens on hand!  I'm lactose intolerant, so I sauteed onions in safflower oil and used a little plain soy milk at the end.  I also skipped blending because I don't particularly like blended soups, and found out after starting that I didn't have chicken broth . . . so I added a little thyme, then realized that my drumsticks in the oven produced a lot of juice while cooking and added that in - which included the juices of a pineapple sage and garlic marinade.  This is absolutely going to become my go-to recipe for using radish greens.

This is a very tasty soup that my whole family enjoyed. It was a little thin but that is probably because a medium potato to me might be smaller than the original creator of this recipe had in mind. Adding a clove of garlic, and some basil and tarragon gave it a nice aroma and flavor.

I would never have thought to use radish greens, but I am a convert!

I made a veggie/lactose-free version, using olive oil and ghee instead of butter, and I used spring onions and a sweet potato rather than a regular onion and potatoes. I also added some fresh herbs as another reviewer suggested. Finally, I used three cups of vegetable broth instead of four. No cream needed. Thanks to the other reviewers for their tips and suggestions.

Quite good! I also made it without cream or milk. Added red pepper, which I think was a mistake, but also added mushrooms and rosemary, which were apt. Also added garbanzo beans for protein, meh. Very pleased to have something to do with radish tops, like many others.

NOTE: Make sure you know how to use your blender before using it for this recipe!  Aside from losing half the soup out the bottom of my blender, this soup was excellent and easy to make!!  I added a clove of garlic, some thyme and rosemary, salt and pepper, doubled the potatoes, and used about one cup 2% milk instead of cream since the extra potatoes made it fairly thick.

The spicy bitterness of the radish tops plays very nicely against the creamy potato soup.  I've used arugula in place of radish tops when that was available.

Although I roughly followed the recipe, I thought it sounded bland (no garlic!?), so I did the following instead and it turned out great:
1. Used much more radish tops, I had about double what the recipe calls for.
2. Added 2 zucchinis
3. Added another onion
4. Omitted cream
5. While sauteing onions/greens added quite a bit of garlic and black pepper 
6. For flavor added powdered thyme, a few pinches of ground nutmeg and powdered yellow mustard
7. I used an immersion blender & got a thick creamy soup.
8. Top with a dollop of sour cream and serve with hearty bread

YUM!

I'm not sure why I was surprised, considering how highly rated this is, but this soup was absolutely wonderful!  Hubby and I both loved it.  I didn't have heavy cream and wanted it to be nice and creamy, so I used plain full-fat yogurt.  Also added some salt and pepper (particularly since I was using salt-free homemade chicken stock).  What an awesome use for radish tops!!!

I couldn't believe that all the previous reviewers loved this soup.  I WANTED to love it (because I have many radishes growing in my garden), but, alas, I did not.  My husband and son said they liked it, but didn't want it again after the first day.  I noticed that almost everyone else added several items to this recipe, especially seasonings.  For good reason -- the recipe called for no seasonings and would be very bland otherwise.  I added salt, pepper and sage, but still didn't like it.  Sorry, Laura.

I will never throw away radish tops again!  And I will be disappointed if my store does not have radishes with the tops that day.  Excellent!!!!  I am growing radishes right now, and I am thinking about turning this recipe into a "kit" of something I can freeze and have after the summer.

Added extra radish greens, also added the radishes into the soup (wasn't sure what else to do with them, they were teeny).  So mine ended up red instead of green.  Definitely added the heavy cream.  Tasted it before, and I felt it definitely needed the cream.  Blended on Liquify to get the right texture.  Ate with toasted multi-grain bread--the kind with sunflower seeds in it--to get the best flavor.  Really Fantastic.

Yum! I'm a little hesitant about the 5-star just because I used sour cream instead of whipping cream (that's what I had on hand), and I think that made a difference. But it had a great flavor and a pretty green color, and I loved it. I will definitely make it again the next time I have radish greens to use up, and I think it would still be good using whipping cream, or even substituting milk.

Really very good! The potatoes seem to be the prominent flavor here. I didn't have any heavy cream so I used half & half and it was plenty creamy. Also, it needs a little salt. Other than that, it was great! Such a great way to utilize vegetables that would otherwise be thrown away.

Me and my food class group made this for an assignment. Overall the product was good, but it did not look appetizing. Most people in my class wouldn't even try it! The texture was a little weird but at least you could really taste the chicken flavour.

I made this with vegetarian vegetable broth, added some carrots,and threw some radish roots in as well (I had so much I didn't know what to do with them)
turned out real good. everyone loved it.
its just like a spinach soup. warm and creamy. delicious with crackers. I've made twice. can't wait to make it a third time. I don't think it is entirely necessary to boil for 30 minutes. I cut it down to 20. and I imediately poured into the blender without giving it a chance to cool. I don't recommend doing that unless you are very careful about not splashing the boiling soup around, could burn you.

I have an aversion to leafy greens and I can't believe how delicious this soup turned out! Everyone gave it a thumbs up, even the picky 3-year-old. I added sliced spicy chicken sausage to the grown ups bowls to make it a meal. Also used milk instead of cream because that's what I had on hand, but it was delicious before I added the milk too. I grew more radishes this fall just for this soup. This one's a keeper!

I made this unusual soup today. ..and were we surprised! It was sooo good. I had no cream so substituted a can of cream of chicken soup. I plan to put some in the freezer for this winter. Thank you so much. This certainly is a keeper.

Had a bumper crop of radishes last year. Did a search for recipe ideas, and this recipe popped up. Radish greens? Who knew. I loved it and grew radishes this year, mainly for the greens.

Thank you for this recipe! It has made radishes a mainstay in my garden. I make a double batch and freeze half to enjoy in winter when I don't have a garden.
Also, I season with crushed red pepper or lemon pepper or a little bit of bacon for a little boost in flavor. 
Quick, simple, lots of room to play but really great as posted as well.

This is very good! A but potatoey but I did not add the milk (I try to avoid large amounts of dairy products), next time I would add a bit more broth.
I also added some celery leaves, and fresh cilantro, chives, and thyme from my garden. I would definitely make this again!

I have made this soup many times and served it to lots of folks who grow radishes.  It is always popular!  I use vegetable broth and don't add any dairy and it is delicious this way.  Potatoes make it very creamy.

This is an excellent idea! I've been using my farm share radish tops this way, and I substitute turnips for the potatoes since that's what I've been getting. It ends up tasting like a zestier broccoli soup!

This was an excellent idea for a soup. I used two small onions instead of one large, used up some canned potatoes I had, used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, used extra radish greens, and added the sliced radishes in with the onions. When I was done blending it, I realized there were still some of the fibers from the radishes left, so I strained the soup before continuing. Because the color and texture reminded me so much of the spinach curry that I love, I added a teaspoon of pepper, a teaspoon of garlic, and a whole tablespoon of curry powder. I garnished it with paprika to brighten it up a bit and served it with feta cheese to accent the spiciness. My mom and I loved it!

WOW! I am shocked that something called "Radish Top Soup" could be so delightful! Even more shocking...my four year old LOVED it! I didn't have a fresh onion so I used a combination of dried minced onion and chopped green onions. I also added garlic, black pepper, and thyme.

I like the idea of not wasting, so if I were in a pinch I might make this soup again, but I think it is just okay.  Edible--not bad, but nothing to write home about.  Perhaps a few more seasonings would make it better for me.

Based on others' reviews, I tasted this before adding the cream and it was so yummy already that I skipped the cream.  My daughter loved it so much that she swiped the sides of her bowl with her finger when she was done (and yes, that's against the rules at our house)!  Thanks for posting this great recipe!

Super delicious!  I didn't have heavy cream, so I used butter and milk instead.

This was not that great for us, just okay.  Even though I followed the recipe exactly and blended it a long time, it never seemed to get smooth, there were little fibrous bits of radish green that made you feel like you had to chew the soup.  It was fun to try, but I don't think I will be making it again.  Thanks anyway!

I used plain greek yogurt instead of heavy cream & it was delicious.  Such a yummy way to use up all the radishes in my garden right now!

Better than spinach soup I've attempted before. I left out the heavy cream and just went a little heavier on the butter.

I have been a member of allrecipes for a while and I've never rated a recipe before but this soup was SO good I felt I needed to say so. I skipped the heavy cream and also garnished with radishes and sour cream and it was AMAZING!

I had some nice fresh radish tops from my first garden and searched for a recipe to try. What a surprise! VERY nice. Thank you for sharing this recipe. UPDATE (4/2011): This years first radish harvest inspired me to make this soup again. This time I added some chopped radish to the onion when I sauted them. I also added some swiss chard, which was also ready from the garden. I used margoram as an herb. It was WoNDeRFuL!

Surprisingly good! I made significant changes to the recipe to use up some leftover mashed potatoes and gravy, and the end result was very tasty. I used 3 cups of mashed potatoes, 1 cup of brown gravy, and 3 cups water instead of the potatoes and chicken broth. I also added 4 cloves of garlic and substituted half & half for the heavy cream. I'll definitely make this again!

Easy and very tasty. I had excess arugula and added it in with the radish greens. Added a little more sharpness but did not take away from any of the flavor. Nice ro be able to use the greens rather than compost them!

This soup turned out really good. It actually tasted kind of like potato soup, only it's green. Could use a some salt or even garlic. I used half and half and it worked well. I added carrots, celery, and mushrooms after blending, and cooked for another 10 minutes or so. Next time I think I could do without the celery.

I honestly didn't mind this soup. I added a bit of pepper and had to substitute with whole milk, I forgot to purchase heavy cream. It was actually really good and reminded me of split pea soup. My biggest issue was the tops have a slight bitter after taste I didn't like.

I made this soup for dinner last night. We’re just a little nervous about it but it was really good. Will make it again. I changed it a little bit I used cottage cheese instead of the the heave cream.

My husband and I LOVED this soup! He grew the radishes but was skeptical of eating the greens. And I hate wasting good homegrown produce.  I have made a lot (!) of soups and was so delighted with this one.  The only change I made due to what I had on hand was instead of heavy cream I used 2% milk and coffee creamer at the end. I'm so glad I have a way to use our radish greens now! Thank you!

It wasn't gross or inedible, just completely bland. I even added oregano, garlic, black pepper, a bit of my own sage- and thyme-flavored turkey drippings  with water as broth but it still had little flavor. It needs something more powerful; I think fennel and leeks would do the trick.  Red lentils add a good protein, cooked separately and added at the end. I won't call the recipe a complete loss - at least I'm not throwing out radish tops any more - but it needs help.  I recommend using yellow onion and Yukon gold potatoes to keep the color bright.  If you're not crazy about potatoes, skip them and serve over couscous instead.

When I got my vegetable box from the local coop, I noticed that the radishes came with greens and I knew that I would have to search for a recipe to try them. I do have to admit that I was sceptic but am opened enough to try a recipe. I love it so much that I am already working on my second bowl! I did make it vegetarian and substituted veggie broth and I used 1% milk and a dollop of sour cream instead

This is not a bad recipe.  Without the radish slices that are supposed to be served alongside, it tastes like cream of chicken soup without any chunks of chicken.  I diced the radishes and put them on top of the soup and that improved it and made it more unique.

Bought a super bundle of organic radishes at the farmers market with beautiful green tops  this weekend. :)  Didn't want to waste the greens after using up the radishes, so of course I searched my favorite website wondering if a tasty recipe exists.  Made as suggested with a large pinch of each sage, rosemary, parsley, thyme as one recipe maker suggested & with one substitution for the heavy cream.  I used coconut milk & butter to make my own heavy cream.   Very delicious. Will definitely make again.

My parents signed up for a vegetable subscription and receive a rather large delivery of assorted veggies each month. It's funny because we really don't eat vegetables often, so they mainly take up fridge space until they go bad and need to be thrown away. I was originally only going to add the radish tops, then I came home to my dad throwing away a bunch of vegetables that weren't even bad yet. Instead of letting a whole package of baby spinach, half a package of baby kale, and a bundle of a mystery leafy greens go to waste, I added those to the soup. I also put in a few fresh thyme springs and what may or may not have been cilantro.  After simmering I put it through the blender and decided it didn't need the extra calories from the cream. It tastes great and was the perfect solution for saving some discarded veggies.
The color of it was a bit dull so I put a few drops of food coloring in before tossing it in the fridge. My friends are picky and they weren't going to eat anything colored in turd green, but they might eat something that looks a little more lively.

Added seasonings (parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, nutritional yeast), also added garlic with the onion. Substituted yogurt for cream and used the immersion blender to blend it all together. My 12 year old son really liked it, so I will be making it again!

Really good, easy to make with ingredients on hand and I like not wasting the radish tops. I used Purple Plum radish which has a beautiful dark purle skin with mauve markings on the inside. My husband was pleasantly surprised it was so good. He was skeptical when I told him “Radish Top Soup” as he looked into the pot!

This soup was decent, but a bit bland for my taste. It really was more of a doctored-up potato soup to me. My husband thought it was good. I will probably make it again as I am glad to have a way to use radish greens. I added a clove of garlic and some thyme, but next time I will try more seasoning.  I did not enjoy the chopped radishes as a garnish, but that's just me. I found it weird to have a creamy soup and then a crunch, though they did soften a little in the hot soup. I served the soup with stromboli and a salad, which made for a very nice meal all-around.

This was so good. I saw this in the April 2018 AR magazine. I usually toss the tops but I won’t anymore. The texture is a bit gritty but not enough to bother me. Thank you for the recipe.

Fantastic way to use radish tops although I’ve been eating them sautéed with olive oil and garlic for years. This soup ultimately feels like a potato soup with a nice touch of greens. I only used one bunch of radish tops and I added 2 diced celery stalks,  1 chopped radish, 1 minced garlic clove, couple springs of thyme and parsley, salt, pepper,  and omitted the cream. I felt at the end I need some crunch so I served mine with homemade bacon bits & chopped scallions. I tried it with the radish slices, but ultimately preferred the toppings I chose! Homemade croutons are great too! Will definitely make again! 4 stars for preparing as written, but 5 stars with adjustments!

This was a great soup and both my husband and I devoured it. Wonderful use of radish greens and quite easy to make. I added a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic in with the onion towards the end of the sauteeing process because I love garlic. No regrets! 
A word of caution:  I used Better Than Bullion's chicken stock and found it fairly salty, so I definitely wouldn't advise adding any salt at all until the end of the the cooking process.

Made just as written - here is my review posted on my FB page - a Chef's Journey - "Radish Top Soup – what a wonderful earthy flavor to this summer spectacular choice of using radish tops instead of discarding them. I have never used the term (and normally find it a little pretentious) ‘umami’ to describe a flavor, but I have to say, umami is the first thing that popped into my mind when I tasted the soup. Umami has been described as the round, rich, savory taste which is not covered by the other tastes - sweet, salty, bitter and sour – and this soup is it!!! Can be served warmed or cool – our weather called for a warm soup, but will be trying in cool, also."

I added some carrots and make it with olive oil instead of butter and gotta say it was scrumptious!

The flavor was great.  Next time I will blend the greens mixture before adding the potatoes so it has some "meat and potatoes" for lack of a better term.  It needs some texture, not just creamy soup.  Delicious way to not waste those greens.

I added salt, pepper, and a dash of nutmeg and cayenne pepper.  I ended up straining the soup because it had fibrous pieces in it that I couldn't get to break down.  I would recommend cutting out the middle stalk of each radish leaf, like you do with kale.  I think the soup would be much smoother that way.  What I had left after straining was very thin and tasted kind of like broccoli soup.  To the leftover broth I am going to add white beans, carrots, more potatoes, and celery.  I don't think I  would make this again.

Quite a surprise! I had picked radishes from my garden to make pickled radishes and hated the idea of tossing the lovely greens!

Served hot or cold, this is a new favorite  and it freezes nicely

Excellent! I omitted the fresh radishes (I had roasted them and saved only the tops), and didn't puree the soup. I loved the result, and am thrilled to have a tasty use for radish tops; thanks for sharing!

The kids told me this was a keeper!  It is a creamy potato-based soup, that is similar to a cream of broccoli soup, in my opinion.  I was trying to figure out how to use the blanket of radish leaves in my garden that would not have time this fall to produce radish bulbs.  I made several batches to freeze for the winter.

Delicious!  My soup was bright green, unlike the example photo.  I probably used 1 cup more radish tops than called for.  I used a combination of olive oil and butter as well as substituting almond milk for the heavy cream.  I used a Vitamix to blend the soup quickly into puree.  It seemed to come together within 30 minutes, and I think that is quick for homemade soup.  Left overs were still delicious within the week.

This just goes to show that butter and cream can make anything taste pretty okay.  It's not going to be anyone's favorite soup, but it is plenty tasty.  You don't really taste much beyond the cream and butter.   My daughter calls it cream of green soup.

Liked the idea of using all the parts of the radish, but modified a lot to make this vegan/vegetarian friendly and a healthier option.  Omitted the butter and cream, added 2 green apples and some fresh tarragon.

I can't even believe how good this soup is. I use allrecipes anytime I need help in the kitchen. I picked up my farm share today and received whole radishes. I don't like them and had no idea what to do. I followed this recipe except for 2 things:
1. my husband and I can not have dairy so I omitted the cream
2. I threw in the whole radish (top and bottom) into the soup pot. 
I really hate raw radishes. Unbelievable. My mom hates radishes and loved it too, and my 3 year old is gobbling up as I write this. Holy smokes this is awesomesauce!

I love this soup. I've probably made it at least a half dozen times.  Make it healthy and skip the cream altogether.  Use an immersion blender if you have one.  I make it vegan by using EVOO instead of butter and Better Than Bouillion's No-Chicken flavor stock.
2017 update: I've made this recipe at least a dozen times.  This time, I had an abundance of beet greens, so I used those instead of radish tops.  It turned out just as good.

My husband and I are trying to eat healthier and lower in fat so I cooked the onion in a little bit of water instead of using the butter and omitted the cream. Also you can save a washing of a blender if you have an immersion blender and you can just Blend it in the pot.  to add more fiber I left the peeling on the potatoes and slice them very thin so the peeling wood blend up easily. This was a delicious soup!

This was so good it didn't really need the cream.  I only had half-and-half and did use it because I was afraid my picky hubby won't eat it without.  I don't think I'll tell him it is radish tops, saying spinach might sell it better (he doesn't like many veggies at all).  For fun I did add some home-grown garlic that I mince in the blender and freeze.   Thank you for this awesome recipe!  As the garden radishes keep ripening this will be made again and again to freeze for winter meals.  I think it would be awesome with some white beans to make a hearty Meatless Monday meal.

I too was reluctant to try this, having cooked these greens before and finding them a little to bitter for routine use.  This is a deceivingly easy and good soup.  I  sub'd carrots and celery for the potato and tossed in garlic and sage... yet the star is the radish greens with their earthy, mellow taste.  I liked it both with and without the milk.  I am sad I didn't make this during the farmers market season.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe and opening my eyes.

Very tasty.  Great way to use those radish greens that I usually throw away.  I used left-over turkey stock.  Added a little garlic pepper.  Used a dash of buttermilk - didn't have heavy cream.

What a delicious soup. I bet it would be good with any green you like when radishes aren't in season - I can't wait to make it in the winter with kale.

Found this recipe quite by accident whilst searching ingredients to look for radish. It has very few ingredients, all healthy and I left out the cream and used "better than boullion vegetable base". Astonishingly it requires no additional seasoning. It was fast to make and quite possibly the most delicious soup I have ever tasted. I'm vegan but my family of 6 are not, so I'm used to some grimacing around the table over new recipes. They all agreed is was fabulous which made my day.

Like others, I altered with what I had on hand and turned out very well. I used leeks instead of onion, and at the end, added a dash or two of vermouth and some chopped fresh tarragon leaves from garden. Garnish with a sprig of tarragon as well as radish slices.

Made soup and took to office meeting where we had supper. Rave reviews from everyone that tried it. Some ate it cold, and some warmed in microwave and good both ways. Only thing that was different was the tops made it slightly crunchy, although it was puréed  well. Seemed like had Rice Crispie feel or something, not bad but odd?

I prepped to make this soup and then discovered my radish greens were bad. I substituted spinach, used 1/2cup of half& half instead of the cream.Added a half tsp each of parsley, thyme,and black pepper. Absolutely incredible!

This recipe is great. My family really enjoys it. We don't eat dairy anymore, and they all said it reminds them of broccoli cheddar soup. When they first tasted it they were convinced I used cheese. I followed the recipe except that (per the advice of other reviewers) I added a pinch each of thyme, parsley, rosemary, sage, pink Himalayan salt, and black pepper. I also added a carrot, and substituted unsweetened almond milk for heavy cream.

Really good!  My mom went to the farmer's market and came home with greens galore and I had no idea what to do with them.  I added 2 bay leaves during the simmering (as I do with everything).  When chicken broth is called for, I use the Better Than Bouillon in a jar.   I didn't have any cream (though I love it!), so I used the 4 tsp. chicken bouillon but with 3 cups water.  When the potatoes were cooked I added a can of evaporated milk and 1/2 envelope of dry milk powder.  The milk combination made the soup really creamy and gave it a big protein boost.  I will make this again.

I added broccoli and used plenty of salt, pepper, garlic and a bit of red pepper.  Garnished with sour cream and sliced radish.   If I make it again, I will be sure to use more leaves and fewer stems. The grown-ups loved it

The only thing I am disappointed in was that I didn't find this recipe years ago. I will no longer compost my radish tops. I also didn't add the cream and added a small spoon of sour cream, wish some julienne sliced radishes.  I sautéed the veggies in a tuscan infused olive oil instead off butter and also used homemade veggie stock in place of the chicken broth as that is what I had on hand. Yummy ;)

We had to fill in a lot of the radish green with spinach, but it tasted  great regardless. I expected it to be very bland, and it was instead very savory and filling!

Yummmm!  And healthy. I used 1/3 c. 2% milk instead of cream. I sprinkled some grated cheese on top after dishing up, too. I'm keeping this recipe.

It has been a while since I felt compelled to write a review here, but I had to leave some stars for this winner. My husband started growing veggies, and when we harvest a large batch of radishes I knew there had to be way to use up the stems (I like collard greens, mustard greens, etc.) and figured I'd find that sort of recipe. I did not find anything like that, but I saw this soup and decided to try it. I didn't have cream and used about 1c of milk instead, and I don't like potatoes in my food so I used a few cauliflower pieces to try to thicken it up (it didn't thicken it up, but it didn't seem to matter). I was curious to see how it turned out without herbs or seasonings, but sure enough the greens + onions was plenty! HUGE hit in our house, even with the 3 & 5 year olds. I am now having a problem someone else has, I want more soup but don't want a ton of radishes! I served it with diced radish as well, much more than suggested (and some whole of the littler ones). I also like to simplify, after I blended it, I slowly added the milk to the blender instead of putting it back on the stove.

This is a simple and excellent recipe! Filling, healthy, wholesome. The only change I would make is to add some garlic to the onion at the beginning and top with a sprinkle of parmesan when enjoying. What a delightful way to use all of the radish!

This is super easy and very refreshing. You definitely must blend it in small batches if you don't have a killer food processor.  I found it could get very thick in the fridge.  I whisked in about little skim milk and it was fabulous!

This recipe was a great starting point. I didn't have any potatoes, and had tons of radishes, so I substituted the radishes for the potatoes, and added about a 1/4 cup of red wine. Followed the recipe for everything else.  I had my husband taste it without telling him what it was, and he was really shocked when I told him it was radish soup!

This soup was so easy to make and tastes delicious!  No one would know it was made with radish tops.  The finished color is very green, looks really fresh.  I added a spoonful of sour cream to the finished soup.  Would definitely recommend.

Easy and delicious. Just finished making this out of my first picks of radishes.   I made is as described except for substituting half and half. No other additions or deletions. I shredded some leftover chicken for my husband to add since he is a meat person.

Just made this soup last night and made a few changes...I added 6 cups of chicken stock instead of 4, 3 potatoes instead of 2, and I added 2 tablespoons of sour cream instead of the heavy cream (had it on hand). I also added 8 radishes instead of 5 and only about 2 cups of the radish greens, and 4 cloves of garlic. I was pleasantly surprised as I have never eaten radish greens before! Highly recommended, and quite filling.

What a pleasant surprise. Simple and delicious.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because I didn't make it as is. I doubled the potato, used 2 cups of whole milk instead of cream, and used fresh herbs I had on hand. I also was a little short on radish greens, so I threw in some kale.  Whole family loved it!

I didn't have any broth or cream handy, so I used water and coconut milk instead. It turned out beautifully, very flavorful. I can't believe I threw radish tops out for so long.

My family loves this soup!  I call it "green Soup" and I have added just about any type of greens I get in my CSA share.  Today was kohlrabi greens and bok choy.  It is a great way to use a part of many beggies that you might just throw away.

who knew? radish tops are apparently delicious? i was looking for a recipe for leftover radishes and found this. Ended up still needing something to do with my radishes because this only really uses the greens. I chopped them up and threw them in there anyway. Added some nice chunk to the soup. Really good. Will definitely make this every time i randomly purchase radishes

Made the recipe as written, using only the most tender radish tops from the last of my spring radishes so it wouldn't be bitter. Also I didn't have chicken broth so used veggie broth instead and added sprigs of sage, thyme and rosemary for a little flavor punch as the soup was cooking. The cream really makes the dish silky, my other choice would have been to use evap. milk, but not being afraid of a little cream I went for the indulgence. I will keep this recipe as one of my spring dishes! Reminds me of a fresh pea soup.

This is delicious - what a nice surprise! I did add garlic powder, salt and pepper to it, and just used water since I didn't have any broth on hand but it was still sooooo good! I'm excited to have a new way to cook all the greens I've been getting from my local farmer's markets, I'm already planning the next time I'll do this.

We made this last night and it was really good.  We used whole milk instead of cream, but the consistency was still thick.  I think next time, we'll add in some carrots and maybe some celery to add more flavor since it felt like it was missing something.  Definitely a keeper though!

This was great! If anyone is a beginner like me and has to follow recipes to the T, it might help to specify that you simmer UN-covered (as far as I know anyway, that's what worked for me). I had to consult my mother on that one! This was a great use for the Daikon radishes I bought and had no idea what to do with!

A very nice, healthy base. I added fresh herbs, spices, turnip greens and sliced radishes to the soup. I'll definitely use this many more times and play around with different combinations. Yum.
