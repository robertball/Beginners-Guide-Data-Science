This is a terrible recipe. My wife had to make it for a company function and spent two hours preparing this dish only to find out it tastes horrible..I found her on the kitchen floor in tears! The ingredients are not evenly proportioned and there are way too many onions! STAY AWAY!!!!!

This is the blandest recipe ever created. Ten pounds of macaroni makes 80 cups cooked. Compare that to the amounts of the other ingredients. Fortunately I did a trial run before I made macaroni salad for an important event. I definitely didn't use this recipe.

I decided to be bold and see what could be done with this without a ton of macaroni.  So I mixed everything but the macaroni and onion.  Then made a guess on how much macaroni this would work for, and lastly added some onion til it seemed like a good amount.  In the end I used about 3/4 an onion and bit over a pound of macaroni.  It really wasn't too bad this way, and may be even good with a couple more tweaks, but of course it only made what would be the equivalent of 8-10 servings.
(I'm pretty open to different opinions about recipes, but anyone who gave this a 5, I've got to believe you're a friend of the submitter, because there is simply something WRONG with this recipe.)

All this tastes like is macaroni with little bits, maybe, of flavor.

I thought I would try this because all the ingredients sounded fabulous, if not a bit too much, I did not care for this recipe.
