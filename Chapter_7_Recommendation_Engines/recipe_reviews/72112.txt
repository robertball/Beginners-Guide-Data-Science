Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. The only thing I wasn't fond of was the feta (although I think it was just the type of feta I bought) so the second wrap I made I used real parmesan cheese and this was really great. Even my meat-lovin boyfriend loved them.

I was looking for something other than burritos to use up some tortillas, and this fit the bill perfectly.  Nice, fresh Mediterranean flavors!  This would be good with garbanzos or cannellini beans, too.  Next time I think I'll throw in some thyme or oregano too.

This recipe is mostly tasteless as prepared, but with a few tweaks it can be amazing! I added walnut pieces, a generous amount of curry powder, some cumin (not a lot, it's strong) and some chili powder. Sorry, I don't have measurements, I cook by eye and taste most of the time. Also, if you use dry lentils, use about 6 ounces.  They really expand when you cook them!

Super yummy...even as leftovers. Cooked my own lentils in white wine and water rather using some from a can. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

The first time I made this, I overcooked the lentils and there was too much liquid.  The second time, I was more careful about the measurements and not overcooking, and it was really good.  I like it with or without olives.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I like using the refrigerated lentils from Trader Joe's.  It's quick, easy, and my son loves putting the toppings on himself.  Fabulous!!

This was easy to make and delicious!  Plus, it was cheap!  I did use dried lentils instead of canned, which I just boiled until they were soft.  Then I drained them and added them to the frying pan.  I also added a bit of salt to my lentils (because they were dried) and about 1 tsp of cumin.  I will be making this again!

Really easy and flavorful! I used red wine because that's what was open and added more vegetables to it- a great way to get protein without the meat!

Extremely filling! Great low calorie, high protein meal.  It was missing something though...a tad bland.
