Made a trial run of this today. I used extra sharp white cheddar and served it with Frank's Hot Sauce on the side and with wheat crackers/bagel chips. All my boys liked it, BUT Hubs thinks it could use some more bacon and I thought it could use garlic. As is, it still disappeared.

Made this for the super bowl. It was gone in no time flat! Only thing i did different was add a little bacon crumble on top for decoration and served with bagel chips

As a cold dip, it was okay.  Great flavor, but the texture when it is cold isn't that great.  I threw it in a mini crock pot and let it get all melty, which was really good, except that the cheddar did not melt all that fantastically well.  I will make this again, but I will use velveeta instead, and continue serving it warm.

It was good, but too hard. I had to make sure it was softened the next time I served it. It was too hard and broke crackers! Definately loved the flavor though, otherwise it would have a much lower score.

This wasn't bad but I think I would have enjoyed it more baked in the oven.
