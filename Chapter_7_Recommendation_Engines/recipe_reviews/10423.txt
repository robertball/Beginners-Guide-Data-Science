Valentine cookies that were a hit.  I used vanilla flavouring and everyone loved it.  Left out the red food colouring.

Awesome! I halved the recipe and did not do the pink heart thing :) Also subbed vanilla for almond flavoring. Cookie alone is great, nice light texture and not too sweet; frosting is wonderful. I think I will make this frosting for other cookies in the future; it has such a nice smooth texture, pretty creamy color, no funky powdered sugar taste. Definitely give these a try!

Flavor was only okay, I'd say. Frosting was way better by itself so I used it as a drizzle for a cake I made the other day and it tasted amazing. I think I might try these again some day but not any time soon.
