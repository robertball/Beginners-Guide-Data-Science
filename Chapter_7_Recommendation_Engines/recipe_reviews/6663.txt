Wonderful Stephanie! After assembling these you'd have to wonder why anyone would even want to make cheese twists from scratch! So easy, not to mention delicious. I also used asiago with this recipe and they were amazing. By the way, I didn't even bother with the egg white. Worked well. Thanks so much; our friends loved them!!

Frozen puff pastry is so great! This recipe is simple, and you can change the seasonings to anything that appeals to you that will stick to the dough! You can even make them sweet with cinnamon and sugar.

I left about 4 sheets together, brushed both sided with melted butter, cut into strips, rolled in the Parmesan mixture and twisted each strip.  Came out beautiful and was great served with my gumbo.

They are good, but don't try to make them a few days ahead of time.  Maybe the day before, but after 2 days they just aren't as good as they were that first day.

These were pretty good, I used freshly grated parmesan cheese.  I used the egg white even though a lot of people skipped this step.  The egg made the twists stick to the bottom of the pan and took all the topping with it.  If you use the egg I recommend greasing your pan.

These were good. I ended up baking them about 5 minutes loner than suggested. Used a lot of black pepper & paprika. A great way to use leftover puff pastry. Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely awesome!  I too skipped the egg and they turned out just dandy.  As a busy Mom & Student, it's hard to come across delicious recipes that are this simple to prepare.  Thanks for sharing!

These stuck to the tray horribly.  While the taste was very good, I was disappointed that they weren't crisper.  Perhaps I should have baked them longer, but the cheese was starting to get brown and I was afraid they would get that burnt cheese taste if I baked them longer.  Possibly omitting the egg white as others have suggested would eliminate the sticking.  Not sure if I would try it again, though.

Simple to prepare. I sometimes sprinkle a little bit of cayenne pepper on the twists.

These are nice. I added 1/2 tsp. of ground thyme to the other spices. I found them to be a little bland. If I were to make them again, I think I'd keep all the cheese and seasonings on the inside and sprinkle the sheets with a good half-teaspoon of kosher salt before cutting and twisting. I'd also swab them with a little garlic butter before baking. And just a note: The egg wash is essential to "gluing" the cheese to the pastry; it won't interfere with your pastry "puffing," so I wouldn't advise omitting it or subbing butter. In fact, you cold use a whole egg instead of just the white and you'd get a nice, shiny, browned surface.

This was a fast easy recipe to make.  The taste was good.  The pepper added a little pep to the breadsticks.  Some of the breadsticks that didn't get as much pepper were blander.  Of course, my kids (8 and 6) needed sauce for dipping.  I bought Pillsbury twisted breadsticks and added the seasoning to those-saved time rolling out dough.  I also read other reviews and saw some were having a problem with the sticking.  I sprayed my pans with a little non-stick spray and it helped.  The cheese still stuck a little, but non of my breadsticks were destroyed or unservable.  Also because I used the Pillsbury dough it was hard to flip them and do the other side.  For the first batch, I simply used the egg mixture on one side, sprinkled the cheese and twisted.  Once they were on the pan I sprinkled some cheese on the parts that were bare.  For the second batch I picked up the breadstick dipped it in the cheese and seasoning mix then twisted and put on the pan.  Both ways worked fine for me.

This recipe is not only very easy but great tasting. So happens that this recipe is printed on the pakage side of Tenderflake Puff Pastry that I bought recently with a few changes. I had followed the recipe on the package which consists of Parmesan and Gruyere with fresh ground Pepper and a sprinkle of Italiano seasoning. This is sprinkled on only ONE side of the pastry then with a rolling pin lightly press the cheeses into the dough then twisted with the cheese side hidden inside and placed on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, baked at 375F for 10 min turned over with tongs then baked another 2 minutes. Remove and place on paper towels to absorb any grease. These don't stick to the pan as the cheese is on the inside. Instead of the Gruyere I used extra old, sharp, cheddar for that great taste! No need for salt or butter.

awesome! if you use the egg white, make sure to grease your cookie sheets. I did everything the same but added a pinch of garlic salt and a teaspoon of chopped chives. When I pulled them from the oven, I brushed on some butter....yum!

I made these for a finger-foods function.  Made as instructed, I thought these would be a bit too large and long.  Instead of unfolding the puff pastry, I simply rolled the folded pastry to desired thickness, added the topping, cut about 24 thin strips, twisted and baked them.  They fit well on a small plate, and doubling the recipe yielded quadruple the number of twists.  I skipped the egg white, and didn't miss it.

This is so simple and so delicious! I do use the egg white as it helps the puff pastry to brown.  I do bake them just a few minutes longer to make sure the puff pastry is crisp.

Delicious! I modified it using ingredients on hand like parmesan cheese and a spice blend. Didn't use egg as suggested and it still came out great! Crispy, cheesy...perfect for our family gathering. Thank you!

Great & Easy! I halved the recipe since I only had one sheet of the puff pastry, and added in 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper for some kick. Instead of brushing the pastry with egg white, I brushed it with a whole egg mixed with a bit of water. I could see skipping the wash and having it turn out just as good though.

Don't bother with the egg wash, just very lightly spread some real butter on the dough, sprinkle with your seasonings and roll in lightly with a rolling pin then cut, twist, and bake. Also the egg wash could 'glue' the layers of pastry together and prevent the puff.

These were fantastic, I used colby cheese because I didn't have parm.  I used less pepper than what was called for, but think it would've been good with the full amount.  I cut some of these in half for more of an 'appetizer' friendly twist:)  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great recipe for using up puff pastry. I add a little salt and up the amount of Parm. I also squirt some  cooking spray on the baking sheet so the seasoning doesn't stick to it. This is a tasty little snack. Thanks!

I used butter instead of the egg white and the flavor was good but the sticks were too flaky for me.  It's a good way to use up extra puff pastry dough though.

This is the first time I've ever worked with puff pastry.  While I'm at a loss for words as to why I didn't care for the pastry, I *can* express that we all really liked the flavor of the cheese etc.  I've already done the same thing with some biscuits I made.  Delicious!

Fantastic! I always have leftover puff pastry from when I make Chicken Pot Pie for my boyfriend and I - this is a super easy and tasty way to whip up a very addicting snack.

This was prepared by my 15 year old daughter.  They turned out terrific.  I had never worked with puff pastry myself and thought she might run into problems, but it was a really easy recipe.  They came out light, fluffy & delicious.   After trying a few of them, the whole family requested she make them again soon!

I made these two ways.  Parmesan and pepper  as well as with cinnamon and sugar.  I  have to say they're both delicious!  I can't wait to see what my family thinks about them!

This is a great use for puff pastry scraps. I added grated Parmesan cheese to the pan just before putting in the oven. It turned out great.

Did not use egg white wash - Next time I plan to try a small amount of melted butter to the "top" side before adding the cheese - I also used Parmesan and some sharp cheddar.  Will make again

Delish, but definitely serve them fresh...I made them the night before Thanksgiving and stored them wrapped in a cotton dishtowel inside an open Tupperware container so they wouldn't get soggy or stale, but I still had to pop them back into the oven for about 8-10 minutes to crisp them back up.

Great light appetizer!  I cut these into 3" lengths instead of leaving them 12" long. I had triple the amount so they went much further, yet weren't too filling before dinner. They look like you fussed, but they are so easy to make. Everyone was impressed!

These are great at any gathering. Some seem to have trouble with sticking to the pan. Just use parchment paper. This works great. Also a word on baking........raise the temp. to 400 and check on them at the 15 min. mark. Mine always finish at 15 min. and are great. After I twist them and place them on the sheet I add more topping. I also cut the dough into thirds. This makes them a bit smaller. Some guests just would rather take 2 small pieces rather than one large.

I used to make a sweet version of these. (Using cinnamon & sugar),  but I hadn't ever thought of making a savory version. Thank you for the recipe, Stephanie! They turned out perfect. Everyone loved them. I followed your recipe exactly.

great snack or to go along with the meal.  Puff pastry can be a little hard to work with but it is worth it.

These were a huge hit. I only seasoned the one side not to overdo the flavour and they were perfect. The pastry came in 2 so I used one for this and the other I sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar for dessert . The family loved both of them and they were so quick and easy to make and made me look like a genius. I served with turkey pot pie. It was a pastry overload meal but so yummy!
