Delicious! Easy to make too. I made 3 chicken breasts with the given amount of coating and it worked well. I didn't have stuffing so I used 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs, and replaced the Italian seasoning with crushed Italian croutons. I brushed on olive oil instead of melting butter on the chicken and then coated it, and it came out perfectly after baking it 15 min per side. I added some mozarella on the top after turning them. Great! Served it on top of pasta tossed with olive oil and oregano with sauteed red peppers on the side.

Was really good and "easy" should be in the name. Be careful however, because it sometimes gets a little dry.

Absolutely delicious!  I did something a little different.  I put 3 chicken breasts at a time in a 1 gallon freezer bag and pounded the breasts so they were more even in thickness.  I also dipped the breasts in butter and then breaded it. I used seasoned cornbread stuffing and of course more curry and parmesean. (because we love curry and parmesean) Then I placed the chicken in a dish sprayed with PAM and turned 1/2 way through cooking.  It browned up nicely and the breading stayed on. It was a hit! Plus I made it ahead of time and just had to take it out of the fridge and put in the ove. LOVED IT. Thanks for the new recipe.

Made this from thawed (still a bit frozen in the middle) chicken breasts, which increased the cooking time. The chicken turned out very juicy and delicious. I served this with fresh angel hair pasta and steamed broccoli. My kids had fun helping to cook this and really liked the taste too!

This recipe as is gets a 4 but I cut back the Italian spices to 1 tsp instead of the 1 tbs and then it moves to a 5.  Great the next day too.

This recipe was fantastic - I just finished eating the leftovers for lunch!  I served the chicken with angel hair pasta and spaghetti sauce, and put some of the sauce on top of the chicken.  My boyfriend loved it, too.  I highly recommend this as an easy and incredibly tasty meal!

Delicious!  Simple to prepare, and although it takes some time to cook, it's well worth the wait.  The second time I made this, I cut down on the Italian seasoning (by about 1/2) because my 9 year old daugter thought it was too much flavor and it was still good!

My kids loved this receipe.  It was almost like a shake and bake chicken but with extra crunchies.  I only used two chicken breasts next time, I will use 6 and use a little bit more butter for the coating.

Didn't add the curry, and it was great as it was written without it! The butter made the stuffing mix breading quite moist and crunchy at the same time. I will make this again! I also added some garlic powder to the mix as well.

This chicken is wonderful and easy to make.  I use galic herb bread crumbs, and sautee the chicken in white wine for about a minute per side, then I read the chicken and bake it.  A huge hit:)

This was a pleasant-tasting and easy to make recipe. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs as a substitute for the stuffing and Italian seasoning. In addition, I dipped the chicken in Italian dressing prior to dipping it in the breadcrumb mix. I ate it with Creamy Parmesan Risotto, which was a good combination. Overall it was a good, easy recipe.

This recipe was fairly ordinary.  It had that “straight from the box” taste.  The taste of stuffing dominated the meal.  We love parmesan and were disappointed that the taste wasn’t more prominent.  We cannot recommend this dish.

I added a little bit of red pepper to give it some "zing" -- as an alternative, you can eliminate the butter in the baking dish and forgo turning the chicken.  The top will be nice and crisp.

My husband commented over again how much he enjoyed this.  Definitely will make it again and again!  I have been like the others and omitted curry powder in any recipe. I purchased a mild curry powder and it was perfect for me.  My kids enjoyed this one too!

Good zesty flavor. I used crushed stuffing and followed the directions. Would make again - maybe with some mozzarella and sauce on top.

This was a very easy recipe to make on a busy night! Will definitely be keeping this one for a quick meal idea. I used chicken stuffing mix by crushing the cubes. I was a little worried about the curry powder but I used the full teaspoon & you couldn't even taste it in the end.. Cooking time was perfect! A keeper!

I use this recipe as a good chicken standby.  I use boneless skinless breasts and pound them out to make them flatter, more like chicken picatta would be.  They cook more evenly and tender that way.  The flavor blend in this recipe is excellent even for people who don't like curry - you wouldn't know it's in there, but the flavor is missing something without it. We serve this on top of some angel hair pasta that we've added a drizzle of olive oil and garlic powder to.  We serve it also with hot steamed broccoli.  It's wonderful and turns out perfect every time.  Great for company because it's easy and stress free, yet pretty and very tasty!

I used plain bread crumbs, shredded Parmesan cheese, and bone-in chicken. Otherwise followed exactly as written. I think the unseasoned crumbs helped keep the spices from being overpowering. I also started the chicken with the ribs up, so the meatiest parts were in the butter first. The chicken wasn't dry at all, and it was very tasty.

This was excellent!  I didn't have stuffing mix so I used dry bread crumbs instead.  I dipped the chicken in egg first then coated it with the coating mixture.  I let bake in the oven for 40 mins. then took it out and put half a jar of spahgetti sauce on the bottom of the chicken and the remainder of the jar on top and sprinkled mozza cheese and let bake for 20 more minutes.  It was so tasty.

We followed the directions/ingredients as listed but ended up not having curry on hand so we left it out of the recipe.  We really enjoyed this chicken.  It was a bit dry so next time I will not cook quite as long.  We also discarded a portion of our leftover stuffing mixture fearful that it would be too much seasoning.  Next time I will use all the stuffing mixture as instructed.

I made my own breading, dredged with imported cold pressed olive oil, using thyme, fresh oregano, garlic powder, fresh shredded Parmesan and a dash of johnny's poultry seasoning. I would have used the seasonings below but I always mix my own Italian seasonings and there was no curry powder available. This was the first recipe my husband was taught to cook: excellent!

Excellent and easy!  I also used olive oil and italian bread crumbs instead of butter and stuffing mix.  The bread crumbs give a finer breading texture, while the stuffing mix is a little more substantial breading.  Your choice.  I brushed the EVOO on the chicken then dredged the chicken in the bread crumbs.  Quick, easy and impressive on the table!

Great EASY recipe. I omitted the curry and added a little garlic salt. I also dipped the chicken in an eggwash prior to coating in the breading. Chicken was very juicy and a big hit! Thanks!

My kind of recipe--simple and so good. I followed the recipe exactly (except no curry) and the chicken was so moist and tender. Even my husband raved about it and he is not crazy about chicken. Thanks for sharing.

Very good. Made just as written leaving out the butter. It didn't need it. This was very easy and I will make it again.

This was amazing! I taught how to cook this recipe at a summer camp to kids 11-16. They ate it up!!!! I still continue to make it. The chicken is so moist. My only suggestion is to make a little extra breading.

Great recipe.  My changes were to skip the Curry/Parsley and use Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs instead of stuffing.  Coated well and they cooked nicely.  Served on top of spaghetti and drizzled with a little of the spaghetti sauce.  My boys loved it!

this was delicious! i made a few changes. i used breadcrumbs instead of seasoning, omitted the parsley cuz i don't like parsley, and used an egg instead of butter to make sure the crumbs stayed on! i also double dipped to add another layer of crumbs to make it extra thick. 

it was delicious!

I loved it.  I also used bread crumbs.  Then dipped the chicken in olive oil and then in the mixture.  The chicken was so juicy and tender.  Then I threw  some mozzarella cheese, right before it was done.  Then put it on a roll with some sauce.  Yummy.  I will make this again.

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used three large chicken breasts and pounded them flat for even cooking and cooked approx 14 minutes on each side.  I used the same amount of breading mixture and felt that it was the right amount.  I also added more parm. when I flipped them over.  I think the cheese is the only reason why it got a crispy crust.  I might have used too much butter.  Overall, very good and easy.

I thought this was so good! I put extra curry and stuffing mix, added garlic seasoning and dipped the chicken IN butter then breaded it with my mixture. Instead of parm I used romano and put 3 times the recommended amount of cheese, but I love cheese. I also followed another reviewer's advice and pounded the breast so they would cook evenly, then cooked them for 12-15 minutes each side. I'll definitely make again! MMMMMMMMMM

I modified the recipe with the ingredients I had on hand, using italian breadcrumbs, grated parmesan, fresh parsley, and some additional Italian spices. Very good. The curry powder adds a nice kick to the breading. Should be great hot on a sub roll with some melted cheese.

This really tasted great.   I used four large chicken breasts and, as one other review suggested, I pounded them so they would cook evenly.   I used the exact recipe (other than 4 chicken breasts).   This is a keeper.

This is a really easy recipe to follow. I used garlic powder instead of curry. I also cooked the chicken in a pan covered with aluminum foil for 45 mins. I took the foil off after the 45 min added tomato sauce and real mozzarella cheese, cut the oven off and let the chicken brown and cheese melt. Came out great.  This recipe is also good if you want to cook it on the stove, or saute it.

It was tasty but was a lil dry and although I liked it, my bf didn't. He said I cooked it right but the herbs wasn't on. He said all the herbs was too much together. I do agree with the herbs being a lil much. Between the herb seasoned stuffing, parsley, Italian seasoning then it was too much. The Swiss Chicken baked recipe on this site is a lot better. This would have been better with the stuffing and without the added seasoning and if it had something like cream of chicken with it when it baked. Won't be making again.

I'm rating this a 4 because it would have probably been better if I used Italian bread crumbs instead of panko.  I also used garlic salt instead of curry powder, should have tried the recipe as written.  I cut the breasts in half then pounded them just a little, baked for 20 min. on each side, that was too long, came out dry. Absolutely need to double the seasoning mix.  I blew it, not sure if I'll make this again.

I used cutlets so they were done faster, therefore the crust wasn't browned so I broiled for 5 min. It was juicy and tender. Served with pasta.

Yes!!! I swear oven baked chicken breasts have been my enemy for years because they always comes out too dry or take sooo much longer to cook than expected (and then in turn are dry, haha), but these were so moist and flavorful! The only change I made was to pound the chicken out to about a half-inch thickness, and subbed garlic powder for the curry. Next time I'll be doing a 1.5 batch of breading since I was short this time, and also I may do half the Italian seasoning since it was pretty potent. Otherwise awesome and easy! Hubby and 4-year-old approved (:

THANK YOU! This recipe was so easy and my picky-eater husband LOVED THIS. The only change was I did not use curry powder, but garlic powder instead. This is a great recipe, definately give it a try!

I made this tonight and it was absolutely delicious. I did tweek a few things. Instead of Italian seasoning, I used McCormick's garlic and herb. As suggested, I used egg to coat the chicken and then doubled the recipe for the breading, which I used panko, instead of the stuffing mix. I served this with a side of angel pasta and sauce.  This is a winner. As good as any that I have eaten in any restaurant.

Very easy and delicious.  My 6 year old did most of the breading for me.  I omitted the curry because we don't like curry.  I cut the chicken breast into nugget-sized pieces, made extra breading, and baked at 425 for 20 minutes.  I didn't bother to turn it halfway through.  The breading came out so crunchy it was like panko flakes and the chicken was highly flavored.  We all loved it, even the picky eaters.  Next time I may omit the parsley and Italian seasoning, just to make it that much easier and I think it would still be plenty flavorful.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe that will definitely go into rotation.

DELICIOUS!!  My entire family enjoyed this, especially my husband who is extremely hard to please!  I prepared & baked the chicken exactly as the recipe was written.  When the chicken was finished baking, i poured some warm spaghetti sauce over & then topped with mozzarella and put back in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes, or until slightly browned.  I served angel hair on the side.  DELICIOUS!

This was awesome. I used crushed seasoned croutons and a few bread crumbs. Also added some garlic powder. Topped with speghetti sauce and mozzeralla cheese...moist and delicious!

I was quite pleased with this recipe.  I am always nervous when making baked chicken because I'm afraid the chicken won't cook all the way through but this was cooked to perfection.  The meat was very tender.  Next time I will pound the chicken out first though as the pieces were too thick and it didn't taste as though there was enough breading.  I will also probably use italian bread crumbs as I didn't notice a preferably taste with the stuffing over breadcrumbs and it was more of a hassle than it's worth.  I did add 3 cheese spagetti sauce and motzarella cheese about 5 minutes before it was ready because to me that makes true chicken parmasan.  I put the chicken on top of noodles.  I had no complaints at the dinner table...and I have tough critics here at home.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was an easy recipe, for sure a keeper. It was a little overseasoned because the stuffing mix was preseasoned. Next time I will omit the Italian seasoning because it was almost overpowering. Husband and kids still liked it so I will make again. Thanks for sharing.

I can not believe that someone said it was "overseasoned".  It seemed pretty boring to me.  It was easy though, so I'll probably hang on to the recipe.

I made this to pair with scotch, and boy was it delicious!  I thought I had curry powder, but only had curry paste, so I didn't use it at all, and it turned out great.  Not dry at all.  Instead of 20 minutes on both sides, I did 20 and 15.

The chicken came out moist and tender, and it was terrifically easy to make. My only gripe is that, with the stuffing being pre-seasoned, there was no need to add all of that parsley and Italian seasoning. It seemed almost over seasoned, and I think that omitting those spices would have made it even better. I'll definitely make it again, though.

This recipe was SO easy!! It is definitely a keeper at our house! I made this with plain bread crumbs (because it was all I had) and added the seasonings to it with excellent results! To be honest I was a little worried about the Curry season and it was an amazing addition. My husband talked about it for days!

I admit that I am a novice cook... and even I can make this taste good!  As suggested by other reviews, I used bread crumbs instead of the stuffing mix.  And I coated the chicken in egg to help it stick.  I followed the cooking time exactly, except I broiled them the last few minutes.  Delicious!

This is a fast, easy and tasty recipe! I made a box of stuffing into fine crumbs with a few pulses on my blender. I had enough of the Italian sesoning and stuffing mix to make 1 more batch of the seasonings (minus the fresh parmesan). So next time, it will go even faster. :D Lastly, if my son loves something, my daughter hates it, and vice versa. They both LOVED this chicken and asked for more. I served this with peas and biscuits, and it was requested again the next day. :D Enjoy!

great and simple recipe. The seasoning really sticks to the chicken and the buttered pan keeps the chicken moist! It goes well with seasoned uncle ben's white rice and steamed broccli.

I can't say I followed the recipe exactly... I used bread crumbs instead of stuffing mix, used no parsley, and added garlic salt... but it was wonderful.  The curry powder added just the right kick to it to make it so much better than Parmesan Chicken I've made before.  Thanks, Dusti!

This had a unique flavor and was easy. As a reviewer suggested, I slightly increased the breading ingredient amounts, and used all of it. Flatening the breasts first for even cooking, I didn't need anywhere near the full cooking time. Probably will cook about 12 minutes each side next time. I really didn't taste the spices too much, but my stuffing mix may have been a little strong. Will probably use a different brand, but will definitely make again. Thanks!

I'm always looking for a new way to liven up a chicken recipe and this hit the spot! I did omit the curry (not a fan), added garlic to the mix, and drizzled butter on top of the whole pan of chicken before cooking to keep the top crisp. The chicken turned out juicy and goes great with mashed potatoes and gravy!! Thanks Dusti!

I'm not sure what it was about the flavor but it seemed a bit overpowering to me (perhaps because of the combination of seasoned breadcrumbs and italian seasonings).  It was easy enough, just didn't care much for the taste.

I did not like this one at all!  I followed the advise of others and omitted the curry.  I found the coating didn't stick to the chicken at all and when it was done in the oven, it was very soggy.  My husband who will eat anything didn't even like it.  I won't make it again!!

SUPERB!  I made a few minor adjustments--cut the herbs, left out the curry powder and did a flour/egg/crumb dredge.  Also pounded the chicken breasts so they were uniform thickness.  Saute instead of bake and cut the butter to 1 tbs and made up the rest with olive oil.

I love this recipe!  I make this all the time.  It is fast and yummy.  I season it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to add some extra flavor and I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs....

Awesome recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I doubled the breading and used panko bread crumbs instead.  I omitted the curry powder and italian seasoning.  I coated the chicken in 2 beaten eggs first and added alittle paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, janes crazy salt to the bread crumbs.  Put it under the broiler for about 3 or 4 minutes just to get a nice crisp on the chicken....Delish!!!

HUGE HIT!!!  Super easy to make, very tasty and impressive enough to serve to company.  I doubledthe breading and coated the meat heavily (we like a thick crunchy coating).  Tasted great!

i used 4 chicken breasts and make small strips. i coated them with egg first and then in a mixture of panko bread crumbs, lemon pepper, onion powder, grated Parmesan, curry powder and crushed ground pepper. i browned them in the broil after cooking them on 350,to give them a crispier outside. AMAZING. everyone loved it!

This was easy and absolutely delicious.  Even after baking for 40 minutes, the chicken was tender and juicy with the savory parmesan crumb coating.  I know my hubby really enjoyed it too because the dogs didn't get much leftovers.  I'll definitely make this one again!

I just made this and it turned out SO awesome. I followed the advice of another member to broil it, which I did the last 5 minutes and it really crisped up the breading. mmmmmmmmmm

I made this last night w/ thighs.  Only thing I did different was used Italian bread crumbs instead of the stuffing like many others have.  What was great was it was in the oven in 10 min!  My chicken was still almost frozen, so I cooked it the first 20 min. on convection, then turned them over - turned the oven to regular bake and they were perfect.

very, very good.  I did not have any stuffing mix, so I substituted panko bread crumbs and some extra seasonings including a bit of chicken bouillon.  I served it with rice and salad and it was a big hit.  The piece I have left over will be wonderful sliced and put on top of a salad.

I made this recipe last night and although added garlic, a little bit of dry mustard, I still felt like it was missing something.  Although I ran out of italian bread crumbs and used regular bread crumbs that I seasoned with italian seasoning, the chicken was juicy but still partially bland.  Also, I recommend added lots of sauce as I just coated to the top of the chicken with sauce because I was eating this on a subroll without bread.  Overrall, its a decent recipe and it is super easy.  Also, butter does not do the job to get the breading to stay on, I used an egg (as you would in fried chicken) and that worked well.

Very good! I only cooked the chicken for about 17 minutes on each side. I also added marinara sauce and cheese about 5 minutes before it was done.

Flavor was there but the breading made it a little dry so we just added pasta sauce on top. Will make again.

I thought this was very good.  I didn't use the butter, but dipped the chicken in egg whites and sprayed the pan with PAM.  I also used italian bread crumbs to save time.  I added some mozzarella cheese at the end and served with noodles and spaghetti sauce.  Big hit!

This was OK. Easy to make, but not as flavorful as I thought it would be. It needed something else, but not sure what. Maybe salt.

Wow! This recipe is fantastic!  The coating was incredibly flavorful - restaurant quality.  We did a marinara sauce flavored by green peppers, mushroom, and onion and the combination was out of this world.

i gave this a 5 star but I did change a few things.  i coated the chicken in fat free mayo.  The chicken ended up really moist.  I added a lot more cheese and i cooked the breast on a cookie cooling rack on a cookie sheet instead of a baking pan.  This way they were crispy all around.  I did not use any butter or margarine.  This had a great taste to it next I am going to try it on pork.

loved this recipe, just finished eating this and both my husband and I liked it a lot.
I did alter it slightly, instead of stuffing mix I used breadcrumbs, also added some paprika and left out the curry
I used freshly grated parmesano reggiano and the chicken came out great, very tasty and moist,thank you very much for this recipe

This chicken is PHENOMENAL! I'm not usually a fan of curry, but I found the recipe a couple weeks ago and figured I'd try it. I have made it four times since - I can't get enough of it! It's rare I find a recipe I don't "doctor" but for me, this recipe is perfect as is.

This recipe is easy, and the chicken is very tender. You can serve it with pasta and salad for a great dinner...My husband constantly asks for this. It's a great one!

I loved this recipe.  But I did change it up a bit.  For me 1 Tbsp of Italian seasoning is too strong so I put in 1/2 tsp.  I probably will put try 1 tsp next time as it wasn't enough.  I also put less curry powder (1/4 tsp) for the same reason and may try more next time.  I also coated my raw chicken with melted butter and olive oil before breading.  I dotted my breaded chicken with pats of butter just to be sure that it would come out crispy.  I sprinkled more parmesan on top.  Regardless this is a great way to eat chicken.  Mashed potatoes and salad finishes this dish.  Beth

It was very easy to make, but not something to write home about. I had all the ingredients in the kitchen. The chicken was a tad dry. I suggest covering it and then uncovering it for the last five minutes. My fiance said, "it was delicious, but don't make it again."

Very tasty. I did encounter a little difficulty with the breading falling off. I pounded the chicken first so I decreased the cook time slightly and had great results. Very tender. Thanks!

I tried thie recipe because my husband-to-be is on a low-carb diet. He loved it and so did I! It is wonderful and he raved about it again when he ate it as left-overs. We are wanting to try the "breading" on a pork tenderloin next. Keep your fingers crossed.

Yummy! This is a long-time fave and everyone I've made it for loved it too. I skip the curry powder and usually just use bread crumbs instead of herb stuffing mix.

My whole family loved this recipe. It was gone in one meal.  I didn't put butter in the pan trying to save calories.  The chicken turned out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I served it with scalloped potatoes and green beans.  This will definitely go into the rotation.

I tweaked this a little, using garlic and herb bread crumbs, plus the cheese and curry.  It was easy and quite tasty.  We had some marinara to put on top, but it wasn't really necessary.  The chicken alone with some linguine would have been fine.  Quick and easy with ingredients I have on hand.  This will be added to the rotation.

Very good meal.  I left out the butter because I didn't see any point in putting it in.  Make homemade mac & cheese using spiral vegetable noodles & it can't be beat.

This tasted pretty good.  I liked the use of stuffing mix instead of bread crumbs because I adore stuffing.  I did however miss the marinara sauce you typically find with chicken parm so I will add it in next time.  Thanks for sharing.

I omitted the curry because of personal preference and added marinara sauce to the bottom of the pan when I flipped the chicken. This is a wonderfully flavorful and easy meal. I will definitely keep this recipe!

This makes fabulous chicken sandwiches if you happen to have any leftovers the next day.  For quicker cooking, I pounded the chicken breasts to 1/2 inch thick. I dipped them in butter than breaded them and rested the chicken in the fridge for an hour so the breading stayed on better.  Since I pounded them thin, I could saute them on the stovetop in 12-15 minutes.  Served them on a bed of pasta with tomato sauce and freshly grated cheese for a quick and easy chicken parmesan.  But like I said earlier, they make killer breaded chicken sandwiches the next day.

Loved the curry taste. I topped my son's chicken with Cheddar cheese and that was quite tasty.  I cooked my partially thawed chicken at 375 with the same amount of time and it turned out quire moist.  Will definitely be sharing this recipe with others.

I used plain bread crumbs, adding an herb blend that I had on hand.  I found the chicken to be excessively dry, and the crumb mixture did not stick well -- dipping the chicken in a wash of some sort first might have helped.  I also thought the curry overpowered the other flavors.

As so many other reviewers have written, I doubt that I will make this again; there are too many other recipes I want to try, and too little time to make them all.

I used a stuffing that had a separate seasoning, so I added it when I processed the stuffing.  the chicken was good, just a little dark brown, this is probably my oven.I made pasta Alfredo and Italian peas ( I get the recipe on  Allrecipes) and got rave reviews.

I didn't have stuffing mix, so I used Italian style breadcrumbs.  That was the only thing I changed.  I halved the recipe, because my husband doesn't care for chicken at all.  Well, I wish I hadn't!  My husband took one bite and absolutely loved it.  He even said he'd be willing to eat it once a week!  Thank you Dusti!  This is definitely a keeper!

Didn't like it.  Tastes just like Shake n' Bake.  Might as well buy Shake n'Bake! Would be alot faster!

This sounded like a good recipe to me.  Both my husband and I like to have chicken and rice, so we are always looking for some new flavor.  I like parmesean, curry and stuffing. But, all together we just didn't think it tasted good. I think it's too many different flavors or something.  We went out to dinner.

I increased the amount of parmesan and didn't use parsley because I was out.  It was okay.  It tasted good, but it wasn't spectacular.  I will say though that the chicken was nice and moist.

I enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe and that it was baked in the oven rather than fried. I served it with a spinach salad. We have sliced the leftover chicken for sandwiches. Be careful not to overcook the chicken.

I used breadcrumbs instead of stuffing, and I had no curry powder.  This recipe was quite good.  The chicken took quite a bit longer than the recipe said, but the coating came out fairly crunchy and overall the chicken tasted good.  It is a simple and straight forward recipe, both in preparation and taste.

Very yummy, easy recipe.  I didn't have any stuffing mux, so made my own out of coursely chopped bread with fresh herbs from the garden.  This gave a nice crunchy texture to the final topping.  5 stars from my husband, too!!!

I thought this was good.  Smelled wonderful cooking...I just wondered if I did something wrong, as it seems like the crumb topping should have been a little crisper.  I will definetly make it again though.

Very good. I also used crushed seasoned croutons instead of stuffing. I also cut each chicken breast half into 2-3 pieces and sprayed with olive oil before coating. I baked at 400F for  a total of 25-30 minutes. They crisped up nice and did not get dried out.

This was delicious!!! I didn't use the curry and I actually used one egg on the chicken.  Also instead of melting the butter I put slivers on top of the chicken and then put it in the oven.  The chicken was very moist and very tasty..

I recommend doubling the stuffing mixture as the one is not enough. I liked the flavors, savory enough, however I found a little something was missing but I can't quite put my finger on it. My boyfriend and son ate it up and loved it so I was happy about that!

Made this for dinner last night, and I served it with spaghetti & sauce and fresh Italian bread. I used chicken breast tenderloins vs halves and they turned GREAT and took about 10 minutes less to cook. Definitely a family friendly meal, I've never seen the kids eat baked chicken like they did this meal. Also, my boyfriend and I do long distance runs so this is a prime carb load meal w/ lots of protein as well! Yummy!! Next time I make it I'm going to serve it with some of these other suggestions.

It was amazing. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. I made a few changes like always just according to my taste. I used the thin sliced chicken breastfeeding and lightly seasoned them with garlic powder and onion powder. For the breading mixture, I bought the cubed white bread herb stuffing and put it in a plastic bag and crushed it up finely. I used about 5 tablespoons of parmesan instead of 3, left the Italian seasoning and parsley the same, and used about 2 teaspoons of curry instead of one. I melted the butter in a separate container and dipped the chicken in it before coating it with the breading mix. After about 15 minutes on both sides I turned the broiler on for a couple minutes to crisp the top. I served it with homemade marinara and bow tie pasta and garlic bread. It was amazing!

A really easy recipe. Made this about three times in September. Great weeknight dinner. I did not use the curry because my family does not like it-yet. I added stewed tomatoes I reduced one time for a traditional chicken parm and a lot of basil and oregano. Lots more spices added because they add so much, I don't add salt.

I failed to read the recipe instructions closely enough and used the stuffing mix right out of the bag, rather than "finely crushing" it which I'll do next time.  Although this affected the appearance, it didn't alter the taste which was delicious.  IMO the emphasis is more on the herbs with just a little kick from the curry and less on the parmesan.  Quick to get in the oven, and then you have plenty of time to put together the rest of your meal.  Definitely a "good-to" dish, moist and juicy, and just loaded with flavor.

I will be making this again!  I used seasoned (garlic and herb) bread crumbs and used egg to dip the chicken in before the crumbs.  I added butter to my pan to give the chicken more crunch.  I served over penne noodles and homemade spaghetti sauce.  And of course, garlic bread & a good red wine on the side.

I made this recipe tonight with substitutions given what I had in my cupboard, and I am amazed!! My 3 year old son has NEVER eaten chicken before, and he ate two servings. It was so tasty and so juicy. The subs I made: I used panko + crushed Breton crackers, margarine instead of butter, and oregano instead of italien seasonings. I was unsure how the curry would taste, but it was delicious. Pure comfort food.

Great Recipe! I changed it up just a tad.  I used an egg wash before coating the chicken and for an extra layer of flavor, I mixed Parmesan cheese into the flour.  I didn't have regular Stove Top so I used Cornbread Stove Top, which was even better! Turning the chicken over halfway through cooking made the crust crispy and buttery yumminess! Awesome dinner idea!

I thought using stuffing mix was a great idea,however I prefer using Italian style bread crumbs instead. This was very tasty and my picky 9 year old gave this 5 stars. My chicken breast were rather large,so I pounded them out like another reviewer suggested and extended the time. I cut the butter down in half and used butter flavored cooking spray genorously over the chicken. Great recipe.

This is similar to a recipe for oven-fried chicken I use, but the ingredients (esp the curry powder) made for a great new taste. V easy & fast dinner, my husband loves it with mashed potatoes & green beans. The only change I made is to dip the chicken in either milk or beaten egg, and used italian bread crumbs instead of stuffing.

Very good with lots of flavor! This recipe has become one of my chicken stand-bys. I like to  use crushed up garlic croutons as the breading.

Very, very delicious. I excluded the italian seasoning and I used 3 tablespoons of Kraft Parm Plus garlic herb parmesan cheese. Also instead of stuffing mix, I used grounded unsalted pretzels. Resulted in a taste that had character while being sufficiently spicy yet not salty.

I would definately recommend this recipe.  I couldn't believe how incredibly moist the chicken was!  However, I didn't have any italian seasoning so I substituted a bit of poultry seasoning instead, and it was delicious.

This recipe is okay.  I may try it again.  Next time I will use Italian Seasoning Croutons and smash them more so it will be less chunky.  I will also follow another review and coat chicken with butter then put in a ziploc bag and shake away.

I've made this a lot and it has turned out pretty good every time!  The coating doesnt stick very well to the bottom and is chunky overall, but still tastes good.  I lightened up on the curry powder and the italian seasoning to give it less of a 'bite' the second time around and that seemed to work a little better since the Ital. Seasoning is pretty overpowering if you over-do it.

This was pretty good and moist. I used bread crumbs from the can instead of stuffing and cut the Italian Seasoning to 1 tsp because of the other reviews. However, the coating was not crunchy, but rather soggy (probably my fault though). The bread crumbs may have had something to do with it and I did have to switch pans because the 8x11 pan was too small so I might have had too much butter. Will definitely try again though!

Didn't care for it much.  Tasted too much like stuffing.  I do not think I will be making this again.

It was a bit dry the first time we made it.  But the second time, instead of rice with it we had potatoes and gravy and it was very nice.  It was super simple to make, which I really liked.

This is SUPER easy to do, and tastes great!  Great aroma! I didn't use as many chicken breasts as it called for, but I kept the rest of the recipe the same.  De-lish!

A most excellent recipe - easy and fun to prepare with a marvelous final result.  I tenderized the chicken as per my liking and substituted Romano cheese instead of Parmesan.  My mother in law raved on and on about it!

This is a wonderful change of pace if you are getting bored with plain old baked chicken. It is very easy to prepare, we all loved it so I know it will become a regular dish around here!!

My gf and I LOVED this. I couldnt really taste any parmesan and a bit too much dressing.  But it is very very good.
