This sauce looked and smelled great for about 2 minutes until it completely separated and came unbounded ? Was looking wonderful like i said for about two minutes, turned from the stove to get a Ice Water maybe 15 seconds and the Sauce was just plain ingredients, not together at all...
Thinking I should of used a binding agent such as Corn Starch, and possibly less Butter? Not real sure, but will try again.

I'm not sure I've ever had Bearnaise Sauce and if so, I might have thought it to be Hollandaise. This recipe was the bomb! I thought the rice vinegar would be weird but it was very good. I used onion instead of shallot because that is what I had on hand. It's winter so I've been forced to buy store bought eggs but cannot wait to try this again the Spring when my chickens start laying eggs again. This was so good that I plan on using up the leftovers on my t-bone steak today.

Have never made bearnaise sauce from scratch before. Made this recipe and it is very good and quit easy to make. Won't buy the mix again. Thanks for sharing.
