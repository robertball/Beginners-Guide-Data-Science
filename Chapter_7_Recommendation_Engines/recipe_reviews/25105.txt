I can't imagine how large a cookie the original poster was making because I've made a dozen tablespoon sized balls of dough and still have tons of dough left! I tried one and it's fantastic. 

I used a fancy glass bottom and the pattern stays slightly in after baking. I also had to use regular flour with one teaspoon each of baking soda and baking powder and it turned out great.

My tip is: bake them for only 7 minutes and let them finish baking on the hot pan when you pull them out.

I was actually using this as a crust for French Silk Pie.  However, it makes plenty for that *AND* cookies.  My roommate tried them and ssaid, "Forget the pie, lets make cookies!"  I also used Adams Extract Vanilla claiming to be 2x the strength (Although I can't tell the difference, I just use it because it's clear and I like the top of my french silk pie to be bright white.)  Why this as a pie crust?  French silk pie has a sweet filling.  I added sugar and vanilla to the cream on top, and that made a plain crust stand out like a sore thumb!  I needed a sweet crust, so I went looking and coulsn't find anything that went well with the pie, then it hit me, forget the self rising flour and use a sugar cookie recipie!  It works out great, but it is too sweet for a lot of people.  The only other thing I changed was I used butter instead of shortening, and added about 1/2 Tbsp of light corn syrup (Just because I like it a little sweeter :)  Overall it is great.  This recipie makes nice soft, fluffy melt in your mouth cookies, just the way I like them!  
Thanks Melissa Heath for submitting it

Very delicious.  I iced these with butter cream, and sprinkled them with colored sugar.  My husband loved these even more than our daughter...who has an insatiable sweet tooth.  I didn't have butter flavored crisco, but added some butter flavoring, and they were great.  *just a side note...If you don't want to buy self rising flour just for this recipe, you can substitute regular flour.  For every cup of regular flour just add 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder.  It is the same as self rising.

This recipe was wonderful!  I did make a couple of changes.. I used 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 cup of BROWN sugar, for a little taste kick.. & I added 1 extra tsp vanilla. The cookies turned out great! I rolled them in white sugar & colored sugar crystals for decoration. 
One thing, tho - I cooked the 1st batch for 8 minutes, & they were JUST undercooked. The 2nd batch cooked 9 minutes and turned out fine!

This is an excellent recipe! My three-year-old son helped and loved every second of it! 

We followed the instructions exactly as written, except instead of rolling the dough out, I took out portions and let him help roll them into balls on sugar-coated parchment. After we put them on the cookie sheets, he helped me press them with a sugar-coated glass bottom. 

We decorated them for our family's July 4th celebration with Sugar Cookie Frosting colored red and blue. They were soft and perfectly crispy around the edges. 

Thanks!! We'll be using this one again!

I have long been daunted by cut-out cookie making.  Early in my motherhood I tried them and I was awful!!  I have been scared to try since.  Today I made these and they are beautiful!!  I halved the recipe in case I screwed them up I wouldn't have wasted to much.  I worked slowly at first and added more flour to my ball of dough as it got too sticky to roll out.  Once I pressed them out with the cookie cutters I transfered them from the counter to the pan with a spatula so they wouldn't tear in my hand.  I cooked about 7 minutes and let them continue cooking on the hot pan once they were taken out as another reviewer suggested.  I used regular crisco (because that's waht I had) and they tasted just fine.  I am so grateful for this easy and wonderful recipe!!

I think i would give this recipe more like 3 1/2 stars. I used butter instead of shortening, because I am a skeptic and thought butter would taste better. Maybe that's where I went wrong. Anyways, it doesn't say to chill the dough before cutting into shapes, but mine was way too sticky and soft. I chilled for a few hours, but it was still sticky and soft. I ended up making drop cookies, which were good, but they tasted kind of like the Simple White Cake recipe that is also on this website. I love that recipe, but these cookies just weren't what i was looking for. I might try again with Shortening, though.

My youngest son is a HUGE sugar cookie fan, and he is so excited that I tried this recipe today -- he says it's the best recipe ever!  We've tried several; we've been looking for something similar to the ones he gobbles at Ryan's buffet restaurant, and these are pretty close if you roll them in sugar, flatten slightly with a glass, and bake for 8-9 minutes.  We overbaked a batch by mistake and they were still OK, just crunchy and crisp (we prefer them softer).
I never bought butter-flavored Crsico before, but I'll keep it in my pantry from now on, just so we can make these cookies!

When we are craving something sweet, I pull this recipe out. Each time my family says "but we don't want plain old sugar cookies" and each time they end with "I can't believe they are gone already, they were so good!"

Eh, just ok. I found it pretty much impossible to roll this dough out. I tried adding more flour, I tried chilling it in the fridge first... nothing worked. Just sticky and unforgiving. The cookies were a little bland. I liked the texture, but they were missing something.

I would give this a 4 1/2 star only because the first thing I tasted was the saltiness due to the self rising flour. Not used to working with it, so this could just be me. Doesn't make the cookies too salty, just something I noticed, and I didn't frost these so if frosted might not notice at all. I got about 18 large cookies out of the recipe. I did add 1/4 tsp of almond extract in addition to the vanilla, which I think really made it super. Thanks and I'll be making these again!

First, the dough is way too soft to cut into shapes.  I tried pressing them with a glass like a previous commenter and the dough was too sticky.  I ended up flattening with the palm of my hand to the thickness suggested in the directions. The cookies spread A LOT and were gooey when I took them out. Yuck.  I had some batter left over so for the next batch I rolled them into balls and let them bake for 12 minutes.  They looked better but the flavor wasn't that great. Not using this recipe again.

Very easy and yummy. Like others I used butter rather than shortening but I thought it was great. I also used whole wheat pastry flour and added 1 tbsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt (actually sea salt) as recommended. Didn't roll out the dough (lazy) but rolled into balls and pressed with bottom of sugared cup as recommended. Rock n roll.

Great recipe.  A little more flavorful than the average sugar cookie recipe.  I added about a 1/2 cup more flour during the mixing process and refrigerated the dough overnight so it would be easy to work with.

I had no shortening so used 1/2 cup butter. Bad idea. These were very bland. Reminded me of baby's rice cereal.

These cookies were great!  Even my boyfriend, who only likes (err, or should I say liked) store bought sugar cookies loved these.  I didn't have any butter flavored shortening so I used regular shortening and added about 2 tablespoons of butter =P

Delicious and so easy! Like other posters I substituted butter for the butter-flavored shortening and used half brown sugar. Some yummy variations I came  up with were mixing in three tablespoons of Nutella, which makes deliciously chewy cookies, and adding cinnamon and two tablespoons of grated apple, which makes them nice and fluffy with an apple pie flavor! Really versatile recipe, but just be warned they spread out a LOT. This may be because I dropped them rather than using a cookie cutter, but just something to keep in mind.

Only changes I made were to roll dough into balls and press them down with my fingers and topped them with sugar before I baked them .. They were good

Used butter instead as well.  The dough become super soft so was unable to roll it out. Once I baked the cookies they came out like bread/cookies. A bit confused, but it still taste good :)

Looks like a Snickerdoodle but not nearly as good.

I added cinnamon sugar to half of the batch to make "Snickerdoodles".  I also substituted butter for the shortening, but that's a personal preference. Very good recipe though!

I loved this recipe. I didnt have butter flavored shortening so I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 shortening and these cookies turned out amazing. I followed Tazzlair's advise rolled the dough into balls rolled them in sugar then pressed them with the bottom of a glass. This made a ton of cookies

As a pregnant lady, I get those crazy random sweet cravings. I sat here fighting with it for a good hour before I decided I WAS GOING TO FIX THIS! I searched and searched for a recipe then FINALLY came across this one. Super easy, had everything I needed, and didn't seem too messy. I mixed everything up according to the directions except I had to add an extra half a cup of flour to get it to a dough like consistency. Also instead of vanilla extract, I tried a tsp of Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey Whisky and made them. I let my dough set in the freezer for 5 minutes then balled them into tablespoon size balls. I also kinda made them into a snickerdoodle type cookie! Low-and-behold they came out amazing! Definitely one I'll make again. Husband loved them also. Which is an added plus!

I substituted 1/4 cup regular vegetable shortening and 1/4 cup of unsalted butter for the 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening and they turned out delicious! I wouldn't recommend trying to roll this variation though...I just dropped by the tablespoonful onto the baking sheet.

I followed the recipe exactly and needed about a cup more flour.  Easy for the cut-out cookies, but the taste is just ok.  I don't think I will make these again.

very easy to make, didn't have to buy any extra ingredients, tastes like a sugar cookie, satisfied.
