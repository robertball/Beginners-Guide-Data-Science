This was very good, but not outstanding.  The recipe didn't specify whether the mustard was dry or prepared.  I used prepared.  I was unsure if the mustard flavor would overwhelm the shrimp, but it was very subtle.

We loved this recipe!  Added a few personal touch for our taste buds and my husband & I thoroughly enjoyed it. I used dijon mustard, 1 cup of wine instead of the half, added cilantro & the juice of half a fresh lemon as well as a tblspn of maple syrup to cut the tang of the mustard and lemon, then served it on a bed of fresh spinach pasta.  Yummy! 
This is sure to be one of our regular dishes.

A really easy dish to make and great for the boys in my family.
I served this up on boiled Basmati rice and it went down a treat.
I'll definitely use this again.

Excellent!  I served this with noodles, and we had an easy and quite tasty dinner that everyone enjoyed. The prep time is minimal but the flavor is out of this world.

I have made this recipe for years and it's always great!  The thing I do different is pan-fry the shrimp in the butter and garlic until almost done.  Put shrimp  to the side and deglaze the pan with the white wine and lemon juice (I don't use lemon pepper). 
Simmer a little to thicken then add everything else (I add the other ingredients to taste) and add shrimp last to reheat and finish cooking.  This way you don't wind up with overcooked shrimp in a thin watery sauce.

I really love this recipe.  It was so easy to make.  I added Birdseye Asian Medley steamed veggies and served over rice.  I have made it twice already.  I also tried it with chicken and added some ginger and whole wheat rotini pasta and it was great as well.

Very good!  I used low fat margarine and dried parsley as it is used for color only.  This was a very fast light meal and I served it over basmati rice.  I don't believe this would serve 8 people though.  Maybe 4-6.  Even my picky husband enjoyed this.  I'll definitely make this again and serve it with rolls to slurp up the extra sauce.

GREAT!  Easy and quick with lots of flavor.  I added a bit more garlic and wine, and used less than half the butter and still great!  Served it over steamed brown rice.  Would also be great with scallops, calamari, etc!  Will definately make again.

Very good.  I did not measure ingredients but I know I ended up using more garlic and more fresh parsley.  I also wanted a creamier sauce for dipping a crusty bread so I added about a half a cup of heavy cream to the wine (used Chardonnay - use a wine that you like as a glass goes well with this dish) and butter.  (The treadmill was defintely used after this one.)  Served over pasta noodles.  Thanks

I found this sauce to be rather bland.  It was neither good nor bad, just there.  I would not make again.

This turned out much better than I expected.  I used Jack Daniel's Horseradish mustard and Sauvignon Blanc wine and the dish had such a lovely wine and spice kick that I wish I had had some crusty French bread or rice for the remaining sauce.  Incredible!

I thought this was too salty (maybe because I used salted butter?) and quite bland. I tried adding a ton more mustard to get it to taste good, but it didn't really help. I will say that my boyfriend and his friend enjoyed it, though. However, my boyfriend can't taste much of anything.

I have made this recipe so many times that I actually got burned out on it.  I have not eaten it in about two years but I am going to make it for dinner tonight.  This really is a simple and fabulous dinner to make.  I am with some reviewers, though, that half a cup of butter is bit much, so I use olive oil instead and only enough butter to give it the rich taste that this dish needs.  To anyone who is considering making this recipe, I say bon appetit!

Another wonderful dish!! I tend to add more spices than normal, and I added a little too much red pepper flakes, but was still fantastic! Just hot! I added a little more wine than called for, threw in some orange and green peppers for color along with tomato chunks, and served it on basmati rice. Delicious!!

This was a hit at my house - young kids, teenagers and adults alike loved it! It was a pain to peel and de-vein the shrimp, but the recipe itself was quick and easy and flavorful!

Easy to make in a flash and RESTAURANT Quality. My family loved this. I followed the recipe exactly and added about 1/4 cup half and half.  This was really good and is definitely a keeper, especially for those busy work days and hot summer days. It was light and yummy!

Yum! I've already made this twice and will make it again. A few modifications to make up for ingredients I didn't have: tilapia filet instead of shrimp, extra virgin olive oil instead of butter, the starchy water from spaghetti instead of white wine. I also used hot prepared mustard for a good kick, and more garlic & lemon pepper seasoning. Delicious. Also, this is one of the few recipes where the prep & cook time have been accurate for me - within 20 min, the meal was ready and the dishes were done.

This was very yummy. My boyfriend loved this dish, i would recommend doubling everything but the shrimp if you are making this with noodles, because its not very "saucy". I also made frog legs with this recipie and it turned out just as good.

EXCELLENT DISH!!! Very good after I did some minor changes to the original recipe.
First used twice as much wine, dijon mustard, and cilantro instead of parsley.  Added Parmesan cheese and about 2 tsp of corn starch to make it a little thicker.  Came out Perfect! Will make this one again and again.  OH and served it with Orzo.

I cut the recipe in half. I think dijon would have had a better taste (and look) than yellow mustard. It needed cornstarch to make into a sauce. It looked boring so I added mushrooms and some green pepper. Either is was the pepper or the mustard was too much for us.

This recipe turned out way better than I expected. The flavor was great-I didn't have any white wine so I used a small amount of white wine vinegar but it didn't seem to matter much. All in all, a very good recipe!

I didn't like this much -- I made it exactly as directed, so I could be fair in this review, even though I sensed I probably wouldn't like it.  

I like to taste the seafood instead.

Very good.  We were out shopping all day and were starved when we got home.  The great thing about this recipe is how fast it was to make.  I used dijon mustard instead of yellow.   To be honest, we just ate the shrimp and never served it over anything.  I would serve it over rice or angel hair pasta for company.

Very tasty dish! And so simple. I added a bit more lemon pepper and garlic and finished it with a sprinkle of parm. My boyfriend loved it.

I usually make this dish once a month.  My family loves it.  Sometimes for variety's sake, I use Dijon mustard in the sauce.  Both ways are excellent.

This is an outstanding recipe! Needed a quick dish for company and it was a BIG HIT!  I made a little adjustment by adding a couple of tablespoons of olive oil with the butter, used 1/3 cup of white wine and splashed in the juice of half a lemon...yuuummm! The mustard gave it just the right "zip".  Can't wait to make it again.

Very good.  The only thing I changed was to use dijon mustard as opposed to regular yellow mustard.

To increase the flavor, I tossed the shrimp with the red pepper, mustard and garlic an hour before cooking.  I sauted the shrimp in the butter, then added the wine and the rest of the ingredients.  I used a Riesling as my wine.  Served it all over pasta.

Fantastic!  I reduced the butter to margarine and cut by half, upped the wine a tad and added a bit more garlic.  Yummmy!  Served with a leek, broccoli & blackbeans mixed with a little italian seasoning and leftover spaghetti sauce.

This recipe turned out even better than I expected, I did not have lemon pepper so I used 1 tsp lemon juice and fresh ground black pepper. It was very good, thanks for sharing, I will make this often!

This was incredible!  I would eat it everynight if I could!  The seasonings were perfect.  We sauteed it with brocolli and the brocolli soaked up the flavors beautifully.

Served the shrimp and sauce with pasta.

Really really yummy recipe. I didnt have lemon pepper so I used fresh lemon juice and ground black pepper, substituted dijon mustard instead of yellow, used White Zinfandel as my wine. Served over rice and squash. Would make again. Thanks!

We didn't really enjoy this.  I used some lemon pepper marinade and I think that was the mistake.  There was also hardly any sauce and I found it to be pretty bland.  It was just ok.

This dish had absolutely no flavor.  We actually didn't finish the meal, we went out for dinner.  I used precooked shimp and that was probably the problem.  I will try this one more time with fresh shrimp.

This recipe was a great way to go!  Probably a four-star on taste, but the fact that it was this great for such limited amount of prep time gave it the extra star.  I actually had to make more as my finicky spouse demanded I make more.  She said that the first batch was just not enough.  Thanx for this!  We will probably go with a different meat next time.  I served it over rice, but pasta is a good way to go as well.

My favorite kind of recipe - fast and easy.  It came out tasting like it must have taken hours to prepare (no one needs to know but us).  I used dijon mustard and served it with rice.  I'll use linguine next time.  I'll use this recipe often, especially for guests.

So easy yet delicious!!!  I have made this a few times for myself since my husband does not eat a lot of seafood.  Last night I made too much and my husband finished it off.  When I asked him why he didn't just have it for dinner, he responded by saying, "well, I didn't realize this was going to be restaurant quality!"  What a compliment from him.  I really recommend this recipe, so simple, so quick but OH SO GOOD!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Good recipe...but I added more garlic, more lemon-pepper seasoning and used Dijon mustard.  Left out the red pepper; that can be added to taste later.

I thought this was very good and the flavors (though appearing to be a strange combination when read originally) went very well together.  I did not find it over powering and will make it again as my husband really enjoyed it as well.  I doubled the garlic and lemon pepper as I always do.

Excellent, used dijon mustard as suggested, it was absolutely wonderful.  I have been looking for a recipe like this.  Much better than scampi.  Thank you so much.  My husband even admitted he liked it better than batter fried.  Will do this one again and again.

This meal was quick and easy, very spicy.  Marinated the shrimp in the ingridents for a couple of minutes like someone else suggested.  While I made a Risotto Milanese (Italian rice) to serve with Shrimp.  Family loved it, that I was asked to make some more.

This is a big hit at home. I use dijon mustard for a bit more flavor. I also double the sauce and use a little cornstarch to thicken it up. I serve with rice or egg noodles.

This recipe is scrumptious!  We use dijon mustard instead of yellow, and use much less butter with a little olive oil.  We serve this over angel hair pasta and add steamed broccoli to it as well.  Yummy!  Guests rave about it, too!

This is what I call, "GOOD EATING"!!!  The family and I loved it.  

I doubled the sauce and added asparagus.  Oh my, was it good.

I'm sure I'll be making it again SOON!!!  Will also try with chicken breast.

This was good. The flavors melded together nicely. I immediately tossed the shrimp and sauce with some linguine, salad and garlic bread to complete the meal. No leftovers either.

REALLY GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I thought it would be a bit short on sauce but after adding a bit more wine it was perfect.  We like it spicy so I added all the red pepper and lemon pepper --if you want to tone it down, back off on the red pepper flakes.  I reduced the sauce to where I wanted it to be before I added the shrimp--if you do it with the shrimp they could over cook.  About  2 min. per side is all they take.

I did make a few changes! Started by squeezing half a lemon onto my uncooked shrimp. I didn't have any white wine so I used ginger ale, added a splash of Siracha, doubled the garlic, and  added a yellow and a green bell pepper to sauté in the sauce. Served over angel hair pasta. Very good and approved by the boys!

Really delicious recipes with the mustard, a little bit to much butter/grease for my taste though.

I've made this awesome recipe a few times. My family loves it! I bet it probably tastes fantastic using a whole stick of butter but I just feel too guilty doing it so I cut it to 1/2 stick and a dab of olive oil. Still tastes great.

Didn't have lemon pepper seasoning.  Used ground black peppercorns and the juice of one lemon, also added some of the peel to the garlic and butter.  If you aren't a fan of spicy, you might want to either omit or go light on the red pepper.  Paired it with Shock Top Belgian White beer.

Very quick and simple recipe.  Followed the directions (but upped the red pepper flakes and lemon pepper just a bit).  Used dijon mustard and thought the flavors were mild but tasty, with just a little bit of heat.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Thanks for a fast weeknight recipe.
