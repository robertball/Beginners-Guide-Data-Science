since the key to making this crust get crusty is to remove as much liquid from the cauliflower as possible I run raw cauliflower through my juicer and use the pulp as the base.  No need to precook - the pulp is so fine that it will bake just fine.  This is a great recipe and I also use this crust recipe to make small crusts and use as low carb "bread". Freezes well if packed properly and I crisp it up in the toaster oven

This is an excellent substitute for traditional pizza crust. Baking at 450F for 15 minutes seems a bit excessive and I was worried about burning the cauliflower. However, the steamed cauliflower retains a lot of moisture and the steam created by the baking process makes this into a regular crust. I will definitely make this again.

Like any non-traditional ingredient, one needs to experiment with working with cauliflower to achieve maximum results.  I have made dozens of these crusts for friends and family and consistently get rave reviews.  I make them in batches, bake them and put them on waxpaper lined pieces of cardboard and use my Foodsaver to protect them in the freezer.  Pop one out on the fly, load it up with your favorite toppings which should be prepared ahead of time as you will not be baking this pizza for much longer after you top it.  I agree that you really need to remove as much liquid from the cauliflower prior to working it into the mix. I put the steamed material inside a large cheesecloth and squeezed the ba-boo-boo out of it. The only deviation I made from the original recipe is to add about 1/4 cup coconut flour to the mixture to further absorb whatever liquid didn't come out during the squeeze.  You will love this crust!

Really very good! The first time came out a bit mushy, so instead of steaming cauliflower, I chopped & rinsed, tossed it in a little olive oil, salt & pepper and baked it until it started to brown. I then continued with the recipe...much better!

I didn't even miss the dough!  I didn't cook the cauliflower before I baked it.  I added parmesean cheese, garlic powder, salt, parsley, and pepper to the cauliflower and baked it for 15 minutes.  Then, I topped it with cooked ground beef and shredded cheese and baked for another 5 minutes or until the cheese was melted.  I will definitely make this again!

I did a whole head of cauliflour in microwave for 8 minutes, put all ingredients in and cooled for 15 min in freezer. Then added 2 eggs. Did all the rest like recipe said. Will do again, crust was just right.????

Tasty, but this recipe fails to recommend that you flip the cauli crust before topping. That will help you get a firmer crust, which will give a more realistic pizza product.

In order for this to work, you have to squeeze as much liquid as possible out of the cauliflower before adding the other ingredients.  Really SQUEEZE the daylights out of it!  I put my cauliflower in a dishtowel to squeeze it; it's amazing how much liquid comes out! I use the whole head of cauliflower and steam it in the microwave for about 4-5 minutes.  Otherwise, this makes a nice, slightly crispy (on the edges)cheesy, flavorful crust.  My kids liked it, too.  Great if you are gluten-free or just want to eat more veggies.  Makes for a less-filling pizza; I find I don't get that overstuffed feeling after eating a couple of pieces of this.

I was so impressed with this crust, it was amazing!  I did take into account the other reviews.  I put a whole head in the processor and then put it in the microwave for 7 minutes.  I then put it in a cotton dishcloth and wrung it out.  I used only 1/2 c of cheese but doubled the other ingredients.  We used a combo of Romano and cheddar and instead of parsley put in green onion.  I baked it for 20 minutes and it was crispy and awesome! My family was happy and we will definitely make this a lot, only triple the recipe to have enough!

I thought Scrapbookr"s suggestion of putting the cauliflower through the juicer was brilliant!  That's what I did and it worked beautifully - I got 1 1/2 cups of juice out of one large cauliflower, I'll try to use it in soup or something.   I used the pulp raw.  Followed the recipe after that, and it turned out great and held together very well.  I used carmelized onions, sundried tomatoes, mushrooms,olives and some dry salami, as well as mozzarella of course.  I kind of baked it twice, after I took it out the first time I flipped it over and baked it again, so it was nice and crisp.  Definitely will make it again.

I used a full head of cauliflower and just microwaved it until it was tended.  Then I put it in the food processor and then to a colander in an attempt to drain excess liquid.  I used a mixture of parmesan and mozzarella cheese.  Doubled all ingredients bc of the full head of cabbage.  Spread it on parchment paper on a large pizza pan that has holes on the bottom.  I had to bake this almost twice as long!  It was definitely soggy!  Flavor was pretty good though as a healthy version of crust.  I will try this again just bc of the health factor but, along those same lines, I will reduce the amount of cheese to cut calories a bit.  I think I will up the amount of cauliflower and then squeeze as much moisture out as possible.  Edit 2/14- made again, this time processed the raw cauliflower, micro for 4 minutes, cooled on tea towel then squeezed all the moisture out.  Added a few seasonings- oregano and basil- baked as stated.  Delicious- much better and not so soggy this way.  next time I will cut down on the overall cheese just bc that adds up to a lot of calories and let's face it- if you are going to put that much cheese on then you should just eat a real pizza!

This was very good! ! I cooked the cauliflower & 3 cloves of garlic in pressure cooker, then drained and mashed all after adding several handfuls of baby spinach while still very hot, parmesan,salt pepper and garlic powder to taste.after it cooled some ,I added 2 eggs, mixed all together well.Baked on pam sprayed cookie sheet until  almost done then topped with shredded cheese until melted  very yummy & my husband liked it as well. I will make sure that I drain cauliflower better next time so that it cooks quicker and liquid doesn't run :)

This recipe is amazing!! I used a mix of (mostly) parmesan with shredded cheddar and shredded colby-jack for my cheese. I skipped out on the parsley and I cooked it for 17-19 minutes each time at 450. I did learn though that the more steamed it was (by steamed I mean cooked thoroughly in the microwave submerged in water), the less moisture it had at the end of baking and the better it held it's shape to be eaten like actual pizza.  After it is fully cooked, apply your toppings and cool for another 7-10 (depending on your toppings), but be mindful when using wet cheeses (like fresh mozz) as it makes it more wet in the end. ALSO, make sure you shape/mold it like you would pizza dough. Thick around the edges and thinner in the middle or you will have a swamp, best toppings yet were a tiny spread of sour cream, topped with a thin layer of Campari tomatoes, yellow onion and some fresh mozz (sparingly). AHHmazing!!

I loved this crust and will make it again and again! I didn't use a food processor. I placed steamed, cooled cauliflower into a bowl. Mashed it up good with a fork then added ingredients. I topped with pizza sauce and dried oregano. Then added some broccoli I had leftover from a grilling, sliced tomatoes, sliced red onion and red bell peppers. Lastly topped with mozzarella and baked. A wonderful alternative to Carb-loaded crust!!

Love it!  I don't have a food processor so I chopped the cauliflower and steamed as instructed.  After refrigerating it, you MUST use paper towels to get all the water out the cauliflower.  Also, I had to bake it for like 25 min before adding the toppings.  It's still a little floppy and hard to hold like regular pizza but it's really good.  I topped it with spinach, mozzerella, and mushrooms. And pizza sauce of course

We loved it!  I steamed it for 15 min then put it in the food processor until it was mush.  Then I put the cauliflower through a sift and pushed out the water.  That got most of the water out of the cauliflower. I then put the mushed up cauliflower on a paper towel and wrap it to get more water out.  My paper towel was soaked so I wrapped a dish towel around the paper towel and pressed out the remaining water.... that did the job!  Everything else I did per the recipe. It was not eggy tasting like some people said and was not soggy.  It was great!!! I would even eat it as a flat bread.

The crust was a little cheesy for my taste, and I could really taste the egg. I think this is a fabulous idea and with some tweaking of the ratio, will be a real winner(more cauliflower, reduce the cheese slightly). Instead of boiling the cauliflower I nuked it for 8 minutes and then soaked up some of the excess moisture with a paper towel (friends said it was a bit soggy). I baked at 425 for just under 15 minutes and the "golden brown"ness was perfect.

I have used this recipe to make "bread" for grilled cheese sandwiches as well. Works beautifully. BUT YOU NEED TO SQUEEZE THE WATER OUT!!! If you don't remove some moisture it will be a sloppy mess. I riced my cauliflower in the processor and then covered and microwaved for 7-8 min to save time, then cooled and squeezed out the moisture using a dishtowel. Awesome healthy alternative to flour breads. You won't even know it is a cauliflower base! I have also added parmesan to the crust to increase flavor! YUM!

I heard of cauliflower pizza crust but just didn't think it could be worth the trouble.  Well, it is.  I will never eat the doughy flour crust again.  I PREFER the cauliflower.  Thank you for this recipe.  The only modification I made was a little less cheese and I added oregano.  I didn't even use sauce.  I sautéed a bunch of veggies, threw them on top with some black and green olives and a sprinkle of cheese.  Delish.

So Tasty!  I run the cauliflower, parsley & garlic through my juicer, then add the egg, cheese & s&p. I bake it at 450F until it's firm (15-25 minutes) flip it onto a cooling rack and let it cool before I top it & bake it with the toppings until the cheese is bubbly.

Very good experience.  I added 1/4 cup of coconut flour from an earlier comment.  It is best to drain the cauliflour with a cheese cloth to get most of the water out.  I would make this again.

I also added some milled flaxseed to the dough and drained the excess water of the mixture to thicken it.

i liked this recipe a lot better the third time after some adjustments. Obviously it is not as good as real pizza but it is still quite tasty. I make a Flatbread without sauce since it keeps better and I can change up dipping sauces or eat with hummus. 


I follow this basic recipe but used a juicer on a head of raw cauliflower as per the comments. Even then I try to drain the pulp further on a towel (low moisture is the real key to this recipe). 

I also add 1 Tsp baking powder and various Italian Seasoning spices (mix of Basil, Oregano and/or Rosemary) then mix and hand/spatula press onto a preheated cookie (use cooking spray or a silicon baking sheet to prevent sticking). Make it thin but not too thin.  

I Baked it 35-40 min at 450 F on top rung of oven, checking frequently for desired darkness.

Very Good! I followed other suggestions and made sure I pressed the water out of the cooked cauliflower. Pre-baked the crust and flipped over halfway through pre-baking. I cheated and bought a bag of frozen cauliflower instead of fresh, steamed it in the microwave, then threw it in the food processor. Worked perfect! Only change that I made to the actual flavor of the recipe was to use dried italian seasoning instead of parsley.  No guilt pizza!

Unbelievable!  The aroma as it baked made everyone anxious for dinner..I didn't cook the cauliflower before making it into the crust and it was perfect...the ONE AND ONLY thing I would change is make it like a grandma pizza. Cheese on the crust then blops of sauce on it. Then add your favorite toppings!

We made this last night, both of us skeptical. We were both completely surprised. We made a homemade sauce recipe for it, too. We put a layer of the sauce, a layer smoked sausage slices, baby bella mushrooms and squash, with a layer of mozzarella and cheddar blend cheese topped off with big tomato slices. Amazing! Paired it up with a salad and unsweetened ice tea. I was also surprised that I was full and satisfied after I finished eating. Such a great alternative to the traditional. Big recommendations from our household!!!

this was absolutely incredible!!! loved it. The crust browned beautifully and then I let it cool about 10 minutes. Put pizza sauce, sauteed mushrooms and spinach, sliced cooked chicken, sliced fresh tomatoes, black olives, and mozzarella on top. Baked at 400 for about 15 minutes and everyone loved it!!!

The only bad thing about this pizza is that I couldn't stop eating it!
I made half of the pizza a chicken pizza with ranch sauce, grilled chicken veggies and cheese and half of the pizza a deluxe with pizza sauce ,pepperoni, veggies and cheese. They were both fantastic but too my surprise I loved the deluxe better. My husband had no clue that the crust was not a bread crust and enjoyed the pizza as well.
I was surprised to see how much water you can squeeze out of the cooked cauliflower and believe it,it is a step you should not omit. Next time I will try to squeeze the cauliflower dryer and bake a little longer so the center gets the same crispiness as the edges. The flavour of the crispy edges were amazing!

The juicer idea from an earlier reviewer was perfect.  I baked it a lot longer.  Pulled it out at 25 minutes to try a slice (I did, yummy) and just put it back in to see if it will crisp up more.  A nice change and the cauliflower juice which I drank was a lot sweeter than I expected!

This recipe really worked for me and the cauliflower crust came out as expected.  I had to cook mine for a little more than 30 minutes, otherwise it would have been too soft. I would have liked it to be a little crispier, but it truly held its shape and didn't crumble at all.  The flavor was pretty good...good enough to cure my pizza craving while I'm dieting.  I would definitely make it again. Thank you so much.

Oh my God!  Everyone, even my children gobbled this up.  It was amazing.  I slathered some tomato sauce, bacon, leeks, mushrooms and goat cheese on top.  Wonderful!  I doubled the recipe and did not strain the water from the cauliflower and it stuck together fine.

This recipe was delicious!  I absolutely loved it!  I did make a couple tweaks to it, but otherwise I stuck close to the recipe.  I used the whole head of cauliflower instead of 1/2.  Due to this, I upped the egg count to 2 whole eggs.  Absolutely amazing substitute for regular pizza crust!  Low calorie and low carb!

This was great! I was worried my husband wouldn't like it but he loved it!  I used mozzarella cheese in the crust instead of the blend but that's just because that's what I had on-hand.  I topped it with pesto, basil, and tomato (and of course more cheese!) and it was a hit.  I DID chop up my cauliflower and steam it the night before so I just pulled it out of the fridge day-of and it was perfect.  Actually making it again tonight.  Don't know if I'm going back to regular crust now!

I also did not cook the cauliflower prior to baking. I baked the crust for 15 min then added toppings and baked another 10. This pizza crust really isn't firm, but more of a pizza pie. Though I missed the dough, it is a tasty and healthier exchange. It will be my pizza go-to recipe

This is a very good "pizza" recipe.  The big key is squeezing out the water from the cauliflower - you'll get a large amount of water out and that will help make the crust crisp.  You can also change the flavor with the cheese you use.  I used Asiago and Mozzarella and basil/oregano instead of parsley.  Just yummy.

This recipe was absolutely not for us. I followed the instructions exactly. I even followed some of the tips to squeeze out the extra water from the cauliflower. I don't think I messed anything up, I think the crust turned out pretty much as good as it was going to get. It was not overly mushy and it browned up nicely. I didn't tell my husband it was a non-traditional pizza crust, I wanted to see if indeed the recipe held true to it's claims that "You will never guess this rich, grain-free pizza crust is made with cauliflower instead of flour." Well, my husband took one bite, and believe me, he could tell. He said it was like eating a keish covered with pizza toppings. Normally, when I try a new recipe that doesn't turn out great, he is polite about it and simply points out things he doesn't like and could be improved upon should I try the recipe a second time. But this one...it just wasn't very good. We ended up picking off and eating all the toppings from the pizza.

Yummy! I didn't squeeze out the water as there wasn't much. I put a garlic sauce on top with roasted veggies...also, I just greased the cookie sheet as I didn't have the other stuff. I just had to loosen it around the edges yet it came out fine. I would make again!

The entire family LOVED it! My dad didn't even realize until later that it was a vegetable crust and not bread! So good. Rather than the Italian cheese blend, I used parmesan. The ends were crispy and all the flavors were brought out wonderfully. Low carb (like guilt-free low carb!) never tasted so good! Mind-blowing. We are keeping this recipe for sure!

It stuck to the parchment paper, the bottom was black, fried to a crisp, it broke and crumbled into a million pieces when attempting to "pry" it off. Sorry but I don't give second chances.

This recipe was fantastic.  I've been gluten free for a while (not by choice) and this was a great way to get pizza again.  The crust was really good.  Though I could tell it wasn't "bread" it was very tasty, and it held up to the toppings I piled on it after the initial bake.  Back when I could eat wheat I loved deep dish pizza, so I even formed a 1/2 inch lip on my crust to really layer on the toppings.

GREAT recipe!

Made this last night, it was great.  Like others, I did not steam/cook the cauliflower prior to baking. I doubled the recipe so I could make two pizzas. I baked crusts in advance so that our guests could choose their own toppings.  Then, popped them in the oven on 425 for 10 minutes, and perfection!

The taste was good, but the texture was not. It didn't get brown on the bottom and was a bit mushy. Too much trouble for just an average outcome. 
I cooked the cauliflower in the microwave for 5-6 minutes. Then I baked it for about 20 minutes. Other than that, I followed the recipe.

This was delicious! I used a full head of cauliflower (squeezed the steamed riced cauliflower in a flour sack cloth to remove excess moisture), added garlic powder, Parmesan, and 1T of coconut flour to my crust. I omitted the parsley, as I used fresh herbs in my tomato sauce. I baked it at 425°F and flipped it part way through to make it crispier.  I topped it with mozzarella, onion, basil, and salami. So good; yum!

Very tasty! I doubled the recipe since I needed a large pizza and I took the advise of another reviewer and after shredding the cauliflower in the food processer, put in a bowl, covered with plastic wrap and microwaved it for 8 minutes to steam. Then I stirred in the cheese and put in the freezer for about 15 minutes to cool. Then I added the parsley, garlic, salt and eggs. I lined a 14-inch pizza stone with parchment paper and lightly sprayed the paper with non-stick spray. Then I spread the cauliflower mixture onto the parchment paper and shaped into a circle by hand. It ended up being about a 12-inch circle. (A double recipe.) It felt quite mushy at this point and I wondered if it would bake correctly. I baked at 450 for about 15-20 minutes until edges were just brown. Then I pulled out of oven and placed my favorite pizza toppings and put back in oven for about 7 minutes. It came out beautifully. The crust wasn't mushy at all and had a very nice flavor. I would have never known it was cauliflower if I hadn't made it myself. Will definitely make again!

This was absolutely delicious. Make it, it will be worth it, I promise. Key changes (as previous reviewers have noted):
(1) After using a food processor on the cauliflower- really chop that veggie up!-, stick it in the microwave for 5 minutes.
(2) Use a clean rag to squeeze the liquid out of that cauliflower as if your life depended on it! Good arm workout too...
(3) Use one very large cauliflower head and double all the other ingredients, maybe adding a little more parsley and if you're trying to be healthy, half the cheese. But seriously folks, this is a cauliflower crust pizza, add in that cheese.
(4) Don't be scared to bake for up to 20 minutes to get that autumn leaf crisp. 
(5) Pat yourself on the back for making a delicious meal.

Other key notes: If you don't have parchment paper, go buy it, you really do need it.

Make sure to squeeze all of the moisture out of the cauliflower before forming it into a pizza crust. I used one full head of cauliflower (it was about 7 cups after it was shredded) which cooked down to about 4 cups, and the same amount of everything else. I also did not use the garlic or parsley, but used oregano instead. It was delicious and I almost didn't miss the bread

Tasted great!  After shaping into pizza I layed a paper towel on top to soak up some of the moisture.

I threw everything together in the food processor: I doubled the recipe and added an extra egg, 1/2 cup of cheese as well as 1/4 c coconut flour.  I did not pre cook the cauliflower or drain it. After patting out the crusts (it made 4) I baked 20 mins at 400F and then baked another 15 at 450. They came out beautifully!

I found another recipe that that I liked much better. It added a little coconut flour to the cauliflower.   The coconut flour absorbs the liquid so you don't have to squeeze the cauliflower. The crust also held together much better.

Followed the recipe exactly as shown and came out great. Only problem i had was it got stuck to the bottom of my pan. I recommend spraying with cooking spray. Also, yes you need to squeeze the heck out of it. Didnt fall apart on me though.

Changes: I doubled the recipe.  It took 25 mins in oven at 450 and still wasn't really "done".

Put Hamburg, pepperoni, thick mushrooms and lots of cheese on.

It was good, but the crust wasn't crispy at all. You had to use a fork to eat.

I might try again and somehow try to eliminate some moisture.

This recipe was excellent. I used my juicer as another reviewer suggested and was able to skip the squeezing step. It was very quick to make. I baked it, flipped it and topped it. Next time I will bake both sides before topping.

Great if you're gluten free or, in my case, doing Weight Watchers. I doubled the recipe so I could make four personal sized pizza crusts. I immediately made one into a pizza and froze the other three for future use. I used 2 bags of riced cauliflower from Trader Joes (I've done it myself in the food processor but you have to do small batches to get even consistency and it's rather s pain). Definitely let the cauliflower cool before wringing out the water so you don't burn yourself. Instead of fresh parsley I add plenty of garlic and dried Italian seasoning. I use low fat mozzarella and some Parmesan in the crust. On top I also use low fat mozzarella and add a little of TJs Quatro Fromagio for some extra flavor. Added veggie toppings lightly sautéed in a little olive oil.

This recipe is great! 
I used all Parmesan which made the flavor a little too strong, next time I will use the Italian cheese blend as suggested. Other than that is was very good and held up well. I doubled the recipe and made an extra crust to freeze.  Looking forward to making this again! Thanks for sharing !

I'm so shocked at how this tastes!  I used a Parmesan, Romano and Asiago cheese blend.  I'm thinking melty cheese would make it soggy or burnt? I put a bit of cayenne pepper in too. You HAVE to squish the water out of the cauliflower before you add the other ingredients! This recipe did not tell this. Hence the 4 stars. Maybe because it was steamed? I don't have a steamer so I put a tiny bit of water in a pan and cooked it about 10 minutes covered. I got way more water out than I originally put in the pan. I used a table napkin to squish it into the sink. Then I put the rest of the ingredients in. You must used parchment paper or maybe a silicone mat? Also, it stayed together better by baking it longer. I baked it at 400* for half an hour.  It was so yummy. My teenagers and husband never even asked what kind of crust it was.  I told them afterwards and they said they'd still eat it again. My husband and one boy do not like cauliflower. I chock it up to a good experiment in getting some veggies in them! I also used "Rosso" brand tomato pesto instead of pizza sauce. They said it tasted like  Domino's Pizza.  I also made Chef Johns cauliflower pizza crust. Very similar. I liked watching his video too.

I made this crust for pizza tonight for the first time. It will definitely be a staple in our house.

The reviews changed how I went about it a bit so I was thankful to have them and for having read them.

I put a whole head of cauliflower in my juicer then put it as is in a bowl, combined with double of all of the other ingredients.

I cooked mine for 20 minutes, took it out, let it cool a few minutes then flipped it over, added my sauce and toppings and put it in for another 8 minutes. Next time I may try baking it a bit longer after flipping it, as some suggested.

One thing lots of people didnt mention was whether or not they used sauce, as I was leery since I had a perfect hard crust and I was sure the sauce would add moisture again. I did use sauce and it turned out great but I may try without next time to see if it makes a difference.

I found it to be a little soft when first sliced, but once it sat for 5 minutes you could very easily eat it with your hands and it was not falling apart one bit!

It was perfect, no need to eat carb heavy crust ever again!

I was pleasantly surprised with the results of this pizza crust.  Doubled the recipe and made a thicker crust.   I cooked it in larger portions with dried parsley, then rinsed in cold water as I didn't have time to chill.  Then I pressed the liquid out using a cheesecloth, added the other ingredients and  put in a food processor. 

I will definitely make this again, but will make thinner crust.  I'll just use a larger pan and spread it thinner.  I would think 1 recipe would be too thin though.

Flavor wise, this was great! Direction wise..it lacked a bit. Half of a head of Cauliflower can vary so much in size.I measured mine once it was all blended and drained..and i had 2 cups. Also you really NEED to get rid of any excess moisture or you are gonna have a crust that doesn't stand up to any topping..and will be soggy in the middle. I love the ideas on using a juicer! I don't have a juicer so i did it the old fashioned way..squeezed as hard as i could with a cloth to get rid of any liquid..you should end up with a dry rice like texture.  Mine took 35 minutes to cook (not 15) but again that could depend on how thin you make your crust and how much cauliflower you have to begin with. Other than that it tasted wonderful..and you can really play around and add whatever herbs you would like. I topped half of my Pizza with homemade basil pesto, the other half with a tomato sauce..and sprinkled big chunks of mozzarella all over.

Everyone is our family is very health conscious, and we gave up gluten about a year ago.  One of the hardest foods to give up was flour-based pizza crusts.  It was with great skepticism that I prepared this recipe, as none of us like cauliflower...but the finished product was DELICIOUS, thin, and chewy, just the way we remember great pizza to be!  
I followed another reviewer's suggestion and ran the raw cauliflower through our juicer (not blender) and removed over 1 cup of water from the full head.  I divided the cauliflower pulp in half, so that I could make two, thin crusts.  To each half (of the cauliflower) I added the egg, garlic, seasoning, and cheese that was recommended.  
We ended up with two very thin crusts, baking at 425 for about 13 minutes, then topping with sauce, meat, and cheese.  
PROS:  Thin, chewy, delicious
CONS:  It's time-consuming and messy - the chopped, raw cauliflower was flying EVERYWHERE as I was trying to feed it into the juicer...which the dog thoroughly enjoyed!  Also, clean-up took forever.

The next time I make this, I will probably make multiple crusts and freeze them.  :-)

This was excellent. I found "Riced cauliflower" in a steamable bag in the pre-prepped veggie section of my grocery store.  I steamed for 4 minutes, then laid it out in a tea towel for 5 minutes to cool.  Then squeezed the ever living daylights out of it.  (Seriously, get every bit of water out that you can.  This makes a HUGE difference in your end product).  Then I mixed the Cauliflower with the listed ingredients and put it on a piece of parchment, on top of a vented pizza pan.  I baked it on 450 for 15 minutes, flipped it over onto a fresh piece of parchment on the same pan and topped with pizza sauce mozz, and toppings.  Popped it back in the oven and  baked another 10 minutes.  I was absolutely taken aback by this one.  I thought it would be...well.... awful. But it was delicious!  NO, it doesn't taste like dough.  (I'm a baker-I get that).  But it DOES taste like a light, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, flavorful BREAD-FREE option. Loved it.  :)

Wow! I love it! I used 1 egg for the whole cauliflower and garlic/cheese/oregano. I didn't cook the cauliflower before combining and the crust came out very crisp. Even though I didn't cook the cauliflower you still have to wring out the water.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and there wasn't a water issue because I steamed the cauliflower (didn't touch water) the pizza crust basically fell apart. It tasted good mind you but we ate it with spoons. Very disappointed as I have been wanting to try this recipe for a while now.

I followed the recipe exactly.  However, I recommend watching a few YouTube videos for success secrets.  For example, if you don't drain the water from the cauliflower after tossing it in the microwave or steaming it, your crust will be mush! The videos show you exactly how to do it. I used a pizza sauce from Trader Joe's that made it extra yummy!

OMG! This is amazing! I'm not a big cauliflower fan, but this is delicious and super easy to make. We left the garlic out because of an allergy, but it was fine without it.

We will definitely be making this again!

I was so happy with the outcome of this recipe!!! Thank you so much!
I did add a few chia seeds to mine and plan on replacing the egg with the seeds next time, also sprinkled with freshly shredded mozzarella.

The flavor was excellent (!), but it was a little softer than I'd like it to be.

Wow! This was a lot of work! Wringing the liquid out of the cauliflower seems to be the crux of this recipe being successful. I did, but it wore me out! Everyone liked it (husb & 4 kids) & definitely wanted it again. Once I have the energy I will make it again. Nice to eliminate the carbs for veggies!

My "dough" came out very messy and mushy. Not similar to pizza dough in any way really. Its not that it tasted bad, it just didnt taste like pizza at all. We had to eat it with a fork because it did not hold together like regular pizza at all. I think the problem was how liquidy the cauliflower was after washing it, blending it until it was shredded (because i dont have a food processor) and steaming it. If i try this again i will be sure to remove as much liquid as possible before mixing in the ingredients.

I absolutely loved this and it is a great alternative to pizza crust.  However, I wouldn't go into this recipe thinking that it will taste just like pizza dough.  It doesn't taste anything like it, and as such I wouldn't even call it "pizza" to your children (speaking from experience).  Instead, try something like Veggie Delight with sauce, cheese and pepperonis on top ;).  With all that said, I devoured mine and theirs.  Yum!

I made the crust too thick and it was soggy. Thinner would probably be better and crispier. Next time, I will also dab out some of the moisture in the cauliflower before adding in the egg, etc. That might help to increase the crisp factor as well. Over all though, I like this recipe and the idea of getting to eat "pizza" without all the calories! I will try again! Thanks!

This was definitely a fork-type of pizza.  The crust wasn't firm at all and there's no way you could pick up a slice of pizza and eat it that way.  We thought it was pretty good, but the crust definitely does not 'fool' you.  It's got a very different texture and taste from typical pizza crust.  I did like the ease of this recipe and will likely try it again.  Was a great way to use up my cauliflower with something different!

I was expecting this to taste like cauliflower, but this really tastes just like regular pizza! I did roll up the cooked cauliflower in a kitchen towel and ring the bajeezus out of it, no way this holds together if you don't squeeze all that water out. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. FYI this made a small 8 inch crust, you should double it if you're trying to make a large pizza or feed more than 1 or 2 people with this. Next time I'll try baking the topped crust directly on the oven rack to see if I can get it to crisp up a little more, or maybe nix the parchment after the first bake...

I always end up baking it a bit longer than suggested to dry it out a little more, but it always comes out perfectly.  The crust really does hold together so you can eat it like a real pizza!

I used some leftover sauteed cauliflower and I'm guessing it would have equaled 1/2 medium sized head.  I used Weight Watchers Italian blend cheese and cut back on it some.  I think mine was pretty thick...next time I will use a bigger baking sheet.  Had to use a knife and fork, but that is fine with me it's delicious.  I topped mine with sauteed onions, bell peppers and spinach.  No tomato sauce and no extra cheese, and it was delicious :)

I made this recipe using 1 tbsp of yeast flakes instead of the cheese. I'm sure it can be improved with some tweaking (it stuck to the pan a bit), but it was just wonderful. It tasted almost exactly the way my normal homemade pizza tastes!

I'm one of those people who usually makes recipes from here "as is" - no changes.  So I thought "as is" this recipe was ok.  It was good enough to eat up, but nothing that I'm going to be craving later on.  I will make it again since I'm trying to cut out starches, but when I do, I will definitely take the advice of other reviewers and try to get some of that water out.  I would also cook it a bit longer and add a touch more cheese - maybe some onion powder too.

This is mushy and falls apart.  Also, no need for cheese in the crust . . . .  I really liked the flavor and idea, though; I'll try again with more egg and maybe stick it under the broiler for awhile.

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out pretty tasty. It does have an overwhelming egg taste and it crumbles. Maybe it needed more than 15 mins to bake. I would make this again but probably in a baking dish as a cauliflower bake not a pizza crust.

I cooked for twice as long as recipe called for and this stuff was still sticky. My once adored vegetable of cauliflower has been burned into my brain. I have the feeling that I have made this recipe 1 more time than the person who wrote it. Once will be enough.

My husband said this was his favorite pizza crust! To save time, I used packaged riced cauliflower and steamed it in the microwave. I then used a mesh colander to squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Then followed the directions shown. I baked it as directed first, then added the toppings and baked it again until the cheese was melted.

Good alternative to regular pizza crust, but the flavor will take time to get used to. For people that are looking for low carb alternatives an almond or coconut flower crust has better flavor and texture. I also found them easier to make.

I hate cauliflower.... but this was yummy! 
I was short on time, so puréed the raw cauliflower and made the crust... baked at 425 for 15 mins. Then put toppings on & back in 450 degree oven for 7 mins. 

I added fresh basil to to cauliflower in my food processor!

My first try was a success, probably cooked it longer..I wanted it a little crispier and more brown around the edges.
I put a whole head of cauliflower in the instant pot for 5min and quick pressure release. I put it in the freezer for a few minutes to get cool. I mashed it up and put it in a cloth, as recommended, to squeeze the water out. Mixed it with mozzarella, cheddar( about a 1/2 cup each) dried parsley, an egg and tsp garlic. I didn’t have parchment paper but I see why that would be helpful. I sprayed my pan with Pam. I put mine on the pan pretty thin.  I flipped it about half way and part of it stuck to the pan. I let it cool, then topped it with pizza sauce, mozzarella, green peppers and olives. It turned out AMAZING! My husband is not a fan of cauliflower and he loved it. We are doing a low carb diet and this hits the spot for a pizza craving.

I used this to make a Keto Mexican Pizza but with a microwave shortcut and some chopped green chiles for more of a tex mex flavor. So many bad keto bread recipes out there but this one is now in our regular rotation.

GREAT base recipe, though I admit I modded it.  Doubled it and added 1/4 cup almond flour, as well as fresh basil and some cooked ground turkey crumbles.  We actually dehydrated the cauliflower for 8 hours first (prepped in the morning and let it sit) to pull some of the moisture out of it.  It may seem like an excessive step but it did a great job of helping us get the “dough” into a more dough-like density.  The bake was spot-on: 450° @ 15 minutes.  Dough was shaped into a flat disc with a pita-like thickness (1/4” or so).

Thanks!

I made this recipe for the first time because me and my husband are trying to do the keto diet and we also have to feed 3 kids. I read the comments and decided to juice the raw cauliflower as one person suggested. I also flipped the crusts over half way through and they came out perfectly. They held together nicely and it definitely would curb my pizza cravings.

I went the extra mile, as always, and added some diced black olives, feta cheese, and sliced green olives.  I'm sure the original recipe would have been fine, but I was going for presentation.

We really liked this crust.  I was afraid that my husband would not even try it but he did and said it was good.
Next time I will roll out the dough between two pieces of parchment paper to the size of my cookie sheet without the edge.  I think it will not take so long to cook and make it crispy.
Will definitely be making this recipe again

Loved it! I left out the fresh parsley because when I went to get some my plant had disappeared.  Toppings were olive oil,  shredded mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and Bella mushrooms. Added another spray of olive oil and freshly grated Parmesan and shredded mozzarella on top.

Great!  Simple, fast, & great taste.  Like it better with ham than
pepperoni.  The pepperoni is a bit too greasy for me.

I followed recipe to the letter.  Crust very good however not crispy like I like pizza crust.  My suggestion is to squeeze excess water from cooled riced cauliflower.

I will make it again and double the amount. It was more like a large personal size pizza. My husband and I split it, but he needed a little more. He is gluten free and liked it better than most gluten free recipes in general.

I made it for the third time, and used just one egg, and parmesian and mozzerella, in the mix. And i also used cheesecloth to drain the water from it. Im still not satisfied with the amount of water i can't get out of it that way either but it still turned out real good. I also don't use the parchment paper and it works out.

I made it from this recipe. It was ok, but for those who do not like cauliflower that much this recipe is probably not for you. It starts out with a yummy cheesy flavor and then finishes with that cauliflower taste.

Tastes really good and the edges did definitely crisp up a bit.  I took off one star because it was pretty crumbly towards the middle and that made it hard to eat even with a fork.  I think it's all about the moisture level, possibly including the amount of sauce.  Overall I liked it and will definitely be making it again .

Following hints in the reviews, I sauteed the chopped cauliflower until it was dry and starting to brown instead of steaming it. I baked the crust on a pizza stone at 425 for 20 minutes. Then I added toppings and baked for 7 minutes. It wasn't mushy. The flavor was OK. My husband loved it. I still prefer a good, old-fashioned dough crust myself, but this wasn't bad.

Awesome. 

I used two eggs and as suggested by another reviewer I baked the califlower for 15 min. As it cooled I blotted three times with paper towels. This made the mixture more solid.
Perfect consistency.

I will try this same receipe for bread.

I used cauliflower pearls. Cooked in Microwave for 15 minutes with no added water. Let it cool and then mixed the other ingredients. It worked perfectly with no need to drain or dry in towels. Only recommendation I would suggest not using tomatoes and keeping sauce to minimum as it made the crust soggy. But very yummy with mozzarella and fresh basil!!

I just bake it as is.    Don’t need to worry about moisture. Add a bit more cheese and 2 more eggs and bake for 25 minutes, then add your toppings and bake for 20 min at 350 and then broil for 10. So good.

Just made it for the first time.  Baked crust twice as long as instructed it would not crisp. Finished pizza was good, but crust soggy. Now I see video shows squeezing water from cauliflower. I wish that step was in the printed recipe. I will see if it turns out better when I make it again.

I went to the farmer's market last week and needed to do something with the cauliflower before it went bad.  I've been wanting to try pizza for a while and I stumbled upon your recipe and I loved it. 

I made a few changes: I microwaved my cauliflower about 8 min, cooled it, squeezed out as much liquid as I could. I like cheddar cheese so I used a sharp cheddar blend and baked the crust about 15 min. I made my own bbq sauce had a layer of parmesan cheese added some leftover chicken & onions to one half and ham on the other and baked another 15 min at 375°.

I am completely satisfied, it turned out great and will definitely make again.

The only change I made was to cook the cauliflower on medium in a skillet for about 10 minutes to dry it out, no butter or oil.  It was very good but I used some cheddar cheese, maybe too much cheese since the pizza was greasy.  Will definitely do it again.

I followed a few reviewer’s recommendations and steamed until just tender.  Then I pulsed in my blender because I don’t have a food processor.  Then I put on a clean kitchen towel and used my potatoe masher and mashed the water out of it.  I spent extra time on this step and actually used two towels.  Instead of fresh garlic in the crust, I used garlic powder and Italian spices.  I took another piece of advice and after I pre-cooked the crust (20 minutes), I flipped it before topping it.  Then after topping, I cooked another 20 minutes.  It was wonderful!  I would absolutely make it again trying different spices and cheeses in the crust.

This definitely tastes like cauliflower! I used a whole head of cauliflower, not half. I did not have enough dough for a large pizza so I added almond flour plus the crust was a little wet. I cooked for 7 minutes then put toppings on and cooked until cheese was bubbly. I will not make this again.

I tried to make this recipe, but I thought it came out horribly. My cauliflower fell apart and it was just gross threw it away. I tried it again with one added step. Ring out the cauliflower and boy did that step change the entire recipe. I would give it 4 stars had it not been for that missed information.

This is unbelievably delicious!  I didn't have Italian cheese blend so I used shredded medium cheddar and added Italian spice blend.  I topped the crust with onion, colored peppers, cheese and leftover chicken breast. Put the pan back in the cooling oven and added halved grape tomatoes and black olives prior to serving.  And of course some grated fresh basil. :-)
My husband declared "this is the BEST pizza crust that I have ever had"

I followed the recipe but doubled it.  I just realized that I only put in one large egg and it still worked.  I used a juicer as another reviewer suggested and used the pulp from the juicer and instead of steaming the cauliflower, I put it in a pan on top of the stove as Chef John suggested in his Cauliflower pizza recipe.  This is a very good crust and held up to a lot of pizza toppings.  I will definitely make this again and maybe next time I will try to  brush the crust with olive oil before baking.

I also added a little bit of flour to soak up the extra moisture.  Best cauliflower crust I have had yet!

I made this pizza crust. It tasted good. Found out that I much prefer regular crust for my pizza. This recipe was easy to make. Encountered a problem in that when all ingredients were added and mixed, there was a moderate amount of fluid in the bowl. Had to use a slotted spoon to fish out the cauliflower. Guess squeezing the cauliflower before mixing it all together would have gotten the excess fluid out. Might be helpful is that step is added to the recipe. Thank you.

I LOVE this cauliflower crust recipe; and the calories are so low!! I'm impressed!! I've made this twice and everyone loves it! I just use diced tomatoes as the sauce, but I love how the crust kind of fluffs and rises up more when you actually add a sauce substitute. Fluffy; but like real crust!

I bought frozen cauliflower from Trader Joes and grilled it a bit in a pan before combining with cheese.  So delicious!  Will be making many more times!

No matter how much I squeezed the water out of the veggies it still came out mushy, the taste was very good but it's not nice to eat it with the baking paper as they sort of combined during baking.

I'm afraid I did make a laziness-induced change or two --  
Used my grater attachment on the Kitchenaid and I microwaved the cauliflower with a couple of drops of water in a covered bowl.   Didn't squeeze it out, so used a tablespoon or so of gluten-free flour to soak in the extra moisture.  

It was so very very good topped with pesto, mushrooms and zucchini -- and caramalized onions.  No more cheese needed.  It feels like I blew my diet but I didn't, really!  Thank you for the idea; truly delicious.

I followed the recipe, other than not steaming the cauliflower ahead of time. I presalted it and let it drain as I prepped other ingredients. The crust took about an hour to bake, not 15 minutes. Flavor and texture were not worth the effort.  We threw out the leftovers, which rarely happens.

Very tasty! My only recommendation is to squeeze out extra water from the cauliflower before make it. The first one I made was very moist. Squeezing the excess water out made the second one much firmer. I actually use it as a bread substitute for sandwiches. Added some cheese on top and made bread sticks as well. 
Hubby says it's a keeper!

I’ve made cauliflower crust numerous times, but it’s been a while so I referenced this recipe. It crumbled and I was very disappointed in the texture.  This recipe needs to be altered.

How awesome to not feel guilty eating pizza! It's a bit of a procedure to make, and man is there a lot of moisture to squeeze out. I think I didn't flatten mine enough in the centre because it was a bit soft and I kept adding another and another 5 minutes, but I didn't want the edges to get too dark. It was absolutely delicious and I'll make it again for sure.

I had to make a couple of changes because I didn't have some ingredients on hand.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I substituted a couple of tablespoons of dried oregano.  I had to use mozzarella cheese instead of the blend. I did use the fresh grated Parmesan.  It turned out great!  My husband, who does not like cauliflower, loved it.  After the crust baked, I spread pizza sauce, cooked diced sausage, more mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on the crust and popped it back in the oven for 2 minutes until the cheese melted.  It was delicious!

I've been looking for the perfect keto pizza crust, so I tried this out.  I'm a big fan of cauliflower, but there is no way that you'd 'never guess' that this is grain-free. I didn't like the comination of flavours, but of course, that is just personal preference.  This recipe made quite a bit, so I made small rounds and ended up using them just to melt cheese on as a side dish.   I think I'd rather just bake pizza toppings into a casserole  and eat it that way.  Next I'll be trying the keto crust made with pork rinds on my continuted quest......

This tasted great!  It was definitely not the texture of crust but it tasted really good!  I didn't use the parsley because I didn't have any and I used a 50/50 mixture of cheddar and parmessan for the cheese.  I baked the shredded cauliflower on a cookie sheet with some avocado oil mixed in on 425 degrees for 15 minutes and then mixed it in with the rest of the ingredients and baked at 450  for 15 min.  I then put on the toppings and baked at  450 until the cheese was melted, probably about 5 minutes.

Made this pizza crust tonight. I added a bit more cheese, frozen riced cauliflower, pesto (rather than tomato sauce), shredded organic chicken, diced onion, and fresh Parmesan cheese. It was fantastic!  This crust WORKS!

Use equal amounts of shredded uncooked cauliflower, mozzarella cheese and eggs.  Large pizza 2c cauliflower, 2c mozzarella, 2 eggs.  No need to worry about water with uncooked cauliflower. Bake at 450 for 20 minutes, add toppings and bake another fifteen. 
I have made this many times and it always comes out great.

The jury is still out for me on this one. I rated it high because it was very tasty. It wasn't very crust-like at all. I dried it out, obviously not enough. Maybe bake at a lower temperature to desiccate it more, then high heat?

I didn't realize the cauliflower needed some serious draining--my pizza turned out pretty soggy. Also, this needs a ton more seasoning for flavor. Next time I'll probably add more garlic and Italian seasonings, both in the cauliflower crust, and on top. However, I was overall surprised that this didn't end up tasting like cauliflower! And it's very easy to make.

This was sooo good.  I'm so happy I finally tried this.  Hubby is trying to do low carb and being the wonderful wife that I am, I'm trying to accommodate him.  I actually forgot shredded cheese and used grated parmesan instead and it still turned out good.  Would definitely be better with the Italian cheese. I read all the reviews and did what another viewer suggested and flipped it over after 10 minutes, cooked for another 10 or so, then added toppings and turned to broil.  Hubby was really impressed.  Next obstacle will be my daughter.  Hopefully she likes it too and we can make this a weekly dinner.  I used a small head of cauliflower, shredded the entire thing in the food processor and then nuked it for about 8 minutes then stuck it in the freezer to cool down, proceeded with the rest of the recipe and it was great.  Thank you again.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and ran the raw cauliflower through th juicer and using the pulp. This was genius! The process was much simpler!

I made it and it took longer than the recipe indicated to cook .  I used a baking stone  and added some rice flour to soak up some of the moisture in the cauliflower.   This recipe is a keeper .

Not adequate for altitude cooking. 
Did try the drying and different processes suggested. Tried adding one more egg but still didn't become crunchy.

Hats off to the user that said to use juicer to separate the fiber from the water! I will be doing this for all my cauliflower bread recipes.

I squeeze the moisture out of my cauliflower but no matter recipe I try what I end up with a flimsy crust. That's okay though! I just fold the slice in half! Like a pizza sandwhich :) I used steamables cauliflower this time and used two egg white instead. A word of advice and shame on me for making this mistake twice...DO NOT USE PARCHMENT PAPER!!!!!! Use a baking stone or spray the pan!!!!!!! It's a pain in the butt peeling off the parchment paper because it bakes into the crust. Then you spend half an hour peeling it off :( NO PARCHMENT PAPER!!!!!!

I made it tonight for dinner.  Followed the recipe pretty closely.  Minor variations: used pre-packaged cauliflower "rice"; used a tsp of Good Seasons Italian dressing (powder) and used a half cup of Italian cheese instead of 1/4 cup.  Cooked crust for 15 minutes without any sauce or toppings.  Then added sauce and toppings and cooked for an additional 10 minutes 'til cheese turned golden brown.  Family loved it.

I tried this recipe. I think I made the crust too thick because it didn't bake thoroughly. It was like eating mush. Not crispy at all.

It is cauliflower.  I told myself that it was not pizza.  That said, I guess the expectation of pizza was to much to overcome.  It was "okay" but as it says...it is not pizza!

The taste of this was great made as is. My picky husband even liked it. I only gave 4 stars instead of five because I did have trouble with it being too soggy. I just tried to squeeze against the strainer. I will try using the cheesecloth next time. I will make this as my crust all the time.

I changed the recipe slightly, using a whole head and adding kale and oregano to the crust in place of parsley...It was tasty, however, it was not crispy, which I was hoping for. I think that next time I will use the recommendations from the other reviews and try to get some water out of the cauliflower after it cools.

This was fantastic!  As another reviewer suggested, I chopped the cauliflower into pieces and roasted in the oven first with olive oil and seasonings.  Then I pureed.  I used two eggs and 1 cup of cheese for a whole head, which for us just made one crust.  My husband was skeptical at first, but he, a guest we had, and my children (4 and 1) loved this.  You would not know it was cauliflower.  Everyone wanted dibs on the last slice.

I took the advice of one of the reviewers and ran the cauliflower through the food processor. This eliminates the boiling step. I did press out a little water with paper towels in the bowl and again when in pizza pan . The crust will not be crisp like a flour crust but it's really good! I've made this several times for my family and friends. Everyone loves it!

Delicious!! I loaded it with all the traditional toppings and YUM! Mine didn't have the crusty texture, not sure if I did something wrong, but eating it with a fork solved that. I'll make it again ????

This was so much work! You definitely need more than 1/2 a head of cauliflower. I used 2 heads and it was just enough for two very hungry people! Also, I would not steam it ever again as it added way too much moisture. I ran it through my juicer and squeezed out the juice using cheese cloth. This took forever and the liquid never ended. It also took forever for the  cauliflower to cool down so I would not burn my hands.  My crust was not crusty, and after I put all of the toppings on (putting the sauce on last to create a barrier), it made it even more soggy. It was still edible, but was more of a mash

I have no clue how you guys got crumbly crust....mine was complete mush, I even tried to over cook it.

The good news is, it made FANTASTIC mashed cauliflower.
I do NOT recommend this for crust, I DO recommend this for mashed cauliflower.

This crust recipe is our new fav.  The key is getting all of the water out of the cauliflower and letting it bake until crispy.  After we are done, we put a light dusting of Italian cheese blend, sliced cherry tomatoes, a splash of habanero olive oil and fresh strips of basil.  My husband hates healthy meals, but he will even prep this cause he loves how the flavors, pop!

I ran the cauliflower thru my juicer as others suggested. I would have been less likely to try and make this trying to squeeze it out myself! I did not steam/cook the cauliflower, just added the egg, garlic, some crushed red pepper, onion powder, italian seasoning, and parmesan to it and formed the "dough." I baked it longer than called for...until it was browning, then flipped it and added my sauce, cheese, sausage and turkey pepperoni. It was delicious!!

Crust was great!! I would advise to make sure you spread it thing enough so it cooks evenly just like pizza dough, thick on the edges and thinner on the rest.

I put it in the food processor and used the BLADE to chop it till it looked like rice, baked it for 15 min (don't like the microwave and the oven dried it better) THEN put it in CHEESECLOTH, squeezed it out and then proceeded with this recipe!!!

After the cauliflower is cooled it must be wrung out in a tea towel! This was shown in the video, so I escaped making that mistake.
 Won't make again. 
I am glad that I tried this though.

I am a huge pizza lover and had serious doubts about this recipe BUT I have to admit, as I eat my pizza right now, that it is amazing!!! I used the juicer to initially remove the juices and then used a tea towel and squeezed even more out. Added the egg, Italian seasoning, oregano and garlic salt and then spread it out. This was a tester for a big pizza party I am having on Sunday and this will be my crust.

I was pretty nervous about making this recipe, but it turned out great! Took some work though.  I took the advice of another review and baked the cauliflower with some evoo before putting it in the blender (I don't have a food processor). Once pureed, I put some serious effort into squeezing the moisture out- there was a lot! A few minutes in the freezer to cool, then to add the rest of the ingredients. I am on an elimination diet, so I can't eat dairy or eggs. I just left the cheese out. I used a standard homemade egg replacement: 2 tbsp rice flour, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp evoo, 2 tbsp coconut milk. I cooked the crust for fifteen minutes, flipped it over, added the toppings (roasted peppers, onions, mushrooms, zucchini, and spinach!) Then cooked for another 15-20 minutes. It came out great! The edges were delightfully crispy, while the center was soft- like a New York style pizza! I will definitely make this again. I can tell that it would be great for other recipes as well-maybe grilled cheese or Flatbread sandwiches. So impressed!

Great recipe. I read other reviewers' tips, and through a combination of best practices, was able to make really, really good crust, even from using crappy frozen cauliflower!

One 1-lb bag of frozen cauliflower only yield a small, 8-10" pizza, so think about that for proportions. I didn't measure, but will put my guesstimates here.

I threw all the cauliflower in a large glass bowl and microwaved for about 5 min to cook mostly through, then squished much of it through a screen for first "drying" round. Then, put it all in my blender until was well-riced, some of it almost paste-like but a few larger pieces. In the bottom of one big bowl, I whisked up one egg, THEN added oregano, basil, a little garlic, about a half cup mexican blend, and a half cup shredded italian 3 cheese blend, and about 1oz of crumbled goat cheese (you want to include this, trust me!!). I stirred to incorporate everything, THEN added my super-squeezed cauliflower rice. To dry the cauliflower (before you add it to the mix), I put it in a towel first, wrung and squeezed until VERY dry and crumbly. We put out easily 1c or more liquid. I honestly think that's the secret.

Add the super dry and hardly-any-left (ha!) cauliflower to the mix and stir to smoothly even it all out. I made it about 1/4" thick, maybe 3/8", with a rise at the edges.

Put on parchment paper on tray in 425* oven. I cooked 15 min at 425 and flipped it (put a sheet of parchment over it, pick up the bottom parchment, and flip. Easier than

I squeezed the cauliflower in a towel to remove moisture after cooking it. I also put cheese right on the crust to make a barrier from the sauce so the sauce wouldn't get the crust as soggy. I added a Tbs of coconut flour to the crust to absorb moisture too.

I made this. It was good, but I have to say, you are not fooling anyone with cauliflower. It tasted like cauliflower. Which is fine, but it's not flour. Let's be realistic.

LOVE! My teenager asks for this ALL the time
Now we don't use too much marinara topping, cuz it makes the crust soggy, so we top with cheeses and turkey pepperoni, mushrooms, black olives, etc ect

This recipe is awesome, I followed it almost exactly just adding 2eggs instead of 1 because the "dough" was clumpy while mixing together. I cooked it for 15mins at 450, took it out of the oven and loaded it up with multiple toppings ( pizza sauce,grated mozzarella,sliced sweet onion,black olives,fresh garlic,grilled red and yellow bell peppers, and pepperoni) your basic "junk pie" if you will. I then put it back in the 450 oven for about 10-15 mins and then served.If you're looking for a traditional pizza crust that's not happening with this, however the flavor of the "dough" and all of the toppings tasted excellent! Definitely squeeze the moisture out of "dough" otherwise it will be a crumbling mess.

Made this today, and while I don't think it could pass as a traditional pizza crust, it was pretty tasty.  Next time I will bake, flip it over and then add my toppings, bake again, and see how it turns out.  A great, healthier option for pizza cravings.

I made this exactly like the recipe called for.  Even my non veggie eating kids loved it.  After I told them what it was, they rubbed their tongue dry.  haha

It was a bit salty for me, but once I added the tomato sauce and additional toppings, it was fine.  I will try adding some coconut or almond flower next time, to see if I can use less cheese.  But, as is, it was great.

Second the suggestion of 15 minutes at 425 and 5-7 at 450 without steaming the cauliflower, otherwise the crust would be a squishy mess.

Delicious! I ended up using a whole head of cauliflower, used 1/2 cup mozzarella and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1 egg, sprinkled dried parsley and Italian seasoning, 2 teaspoons minced garlic, salt and pepper. So good and so healthy! Loved hiding another vegetable in the pizza! Great reheated too!

This "crust" was certainly delicious, with just enough cauliflower flavor to add a lovely touch to my pizza. Unfortunately, it was more like a paste, even when cooked, and you had to eat this pizza with a knife and fork. It was overall more like lasagna. So, three stars because it tasted great, but really didn't live up to my "crust" expectations.

Loved it. Entire family enjoyed it. One teen didn't know what the crust was made of until we told her!  Next time I will probably flip the crust over and bake long to get it crispy. Flavor was perfect!

I've made this twice now. The first time I used the cauliflower raw, mixed with the rest of the crust ingredients and baked it that way. It was pretty good, but the center was a little more moist than I wanted. The second time I cooked the cauliflower first and worked to get the moisture out. It was soggier than the first time, and fell apart as I ate it. I do like the roasted flavor of it. I will continue to try perfect it.

Came out great but as others have already said, BE SURE TO SQUEEZE ALL LIQUID OUT!!!!  This is the key to success.  I used a dishcloth to do this.  Also, I used liquid egg whites instead of a whole egg.  I baked it on a silicone sheet.  Makes it easy to remove.

Tried this twice and it is so good!  My husband loves it.  It's a little time consuming, but if you plan ahead, it's worth it.  I boil/steam the cauliflower as usual till tender (no need to cut into really small pieces), drain, mash, and squeeze cauliflower in cheese cloth to remove excess liquid.  Add the other crust ingredients (I used some dry Italian seasonings instead of the parsley), and then bake the crusts first. The 450 degrees is not too high -- works out well cooking it for the 15 minutes.  Then I add my toppings and a little cheese, baking again until the cheese melts. (I sautee/warm up my toppings a little before I put them on the basked crust.  Really - to us -- it doesn't taste like normal pizza crust, but it is, nevertheless, tasty and grain free.  One cauliflower head made 4 pizzas for us. Enjoy!

I used 1 small cauliflower and added  2 tbsp of flax meal and 1 tsp of onion,  garlic powder and oregano (omitted salt and parsley). I spread it on a silicone sheet on the pan and it was about 1/2 inch thick. I should have baked it a bit longer or spread it thinner before adding toppings.  It was tasty though.

The crusy was soggy. :( I made this according to the directions, I really squeezed a lot of liquid before mixing all ingredients. I baked for 15 mins., then 5 more. It browned nicely.  I then topped with sauce a veggies and baked 10 minutes.  It had great flavor,  but the mushy texture was not appetizing.

The flavor was amazing but the crust did not hold up to pizza grabbing standards. I was trying to avoid the (gross) process of wringing the water out of the cauliflower, but I guess it just can't be avoided. The family loved the taste and didn't mind using a fork in the least!  Yummy.

This was surprisingly good!  I used foil, as I didn't have parchment paper or a silicon mat and the "crust" stuck to the foil.  I'd made 2 pizzas, one for my son and one for me, so I just tore the foil and slid each pizza (w/ foil) onto its plate.  I tried this recipe bc we were low on ingredients.  I had 3/4 of a cauliflower and an egg and thought we had cheese, but alas just had cottage cheese.  I made the crust w/o cheese as I don't eat cheese and I put a few dollops of cottage cheese on top of my son's pre-baked crust.  I spread olive oil over the pre-baked crust, then topped w/ sauteed onions and sliced tomatoes.  I also put sliced black olives on mine.  I sprinkled garlic powder, oregano, and a little salt over both pizzas.  Then I baked for another 8 minutes.  My son HATES cauliflower, but agreed that this was a very tasty dish!

Great end result! However took some time with out proper equipment.

I used a hand mixer to mash the cauliflower and coffee filters to squeeze out the water. The hand mixer part was fine you could probably do it with a potato masher or a fork. The coffee filters worked but it would have been sweet to have cheese cloth because they burst open and one can only squeaze a handfull at a time. 

I made 4 rectangles with 1 whole head then froze 3 of them (idk how that will turn out but good I hope)

It took a long time to crisp up I ended up cranking it up to 500. This is probably due to the fact that my oven is pretty old.

This recipe is a celiac's dream come true! I did not cook the cauliflower first, because my processor chopped it quite finely. The flavor was fabulous. The only reason that it did not get five stars is because it was a little bit soggy.
