Made recipe exactly as written.  These were moist and so yummy.  I was looking for a recipe using my leftover whole cranberry sauce from Christmas.  So glad I found this.  Thank you so much for the recipe

These were delicious! I made cranberry sauce for Christmas and used the leftovers for this recipe. I will likely double my cranberry sauce recipe next time just so I can make more muffins!

Loved the flavor, but they were a little on the dry side after 18 minutes in the oven.  Might add more cranberry sauce and/or a jar of baby food squash or sweet potatoes to add more moisture.

I used the jellied cranberry sauce (all I could find in the store).  Not much cranberry flavor.  I may try again when I can find whole berry sauce.
