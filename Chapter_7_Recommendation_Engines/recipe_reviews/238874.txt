Very nice quick recipe, good flavor. The only draw back is that no one makes a cake mix  in a 18.25 oz package, the largest I could find was 16.5oz so I reduced the water by 2 tablespoons

This recipe was amazing! I followed it exactly, and it turned out perfectly! For my oven, 35 minutes at 350 was perfect. I used the banana cream instant pudding as listed, but you could use whatever kind of pudding you like (or your own favorite frosting recipe). I took it to school for a potluck breakfast, and it went very fast! I will definitely be making this again.

I was looking for something easy to bring to a social function that also used up as many bananas as possible (I put them in my freezer when they get too ripe and there are DOZENS in there). 

I was going to bring two of these with me, but they smelled so amazing while they were baking that we ate one as soon as it cooled. I absolutely LOVED this, even though I'm usually a from-scratch cook. 

I'm about to try a modified version with canned pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla pudding in the frosting to go with the turkey I'm roasting today (two days post-Thanksgiving). I bet that's delicious, too.
