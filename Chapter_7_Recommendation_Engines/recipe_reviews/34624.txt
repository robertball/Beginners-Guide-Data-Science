This was another great salad.  I left out the olives, and it still worked for me.  I had to add lettuce, even though I know traditional Greek salads don't use it.

This was just ok for me.  I made exactly as written except I substituted chopped black olives for the Kalamata olives.  The salad looked great until I added the oregano.  2 T was way too much and the salad didn't really need 2 T of olive oil either.  Next time I make it, I'll decrease both the oregano and the olive oil.  I made this for a Greek-themed girl's night and ended up with a lot of leftovers that we threw away.

This was a wonderful Greek salad recipe! I left out the green pepper as I am not used to it in Greek salad.

I just returned from a tour of Greece and the islands. This salad is just like the one we had in many greek restaurants and on the ship.
2 tablespoons of oregano appears to be an overkill. The salad responds well to just about any Italian type dressing.

Excellent salad,with an excellent, fresh and light dressing.  To make it a tossed, garden salad I added Romaine lettuce. Loved the hint of oregano.

22 November 2007, Thanksgiving Day ~ Of all the dishes we had today for our Thanksgiving dinner, this GREEK SALAD V was by far the best! It's like eating a breath of fresh air...so light and tasty! I visited Athens and some of the Greek Islands a few years ago. My favorite food there was the Greek Salad...and this one was SUPERLATIVE and tasted just like those I had in Greece. Additionally, it's such a colorful dish. Nothing can compare to the combination of feta cheese, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions and Kalamata olives. Oooh, it's after 8pm and yet that makes me want to get into the frig and eat some of the Greek Salad V leftovers. NOTE: I didn't layer the salad. Instead I just mixed it all when first made so the flavors could blend. Ciao, Poni (rhymes with Bonnie)

This is just like the salads we were served all over Greece, except that in Greece, the feta was not crumbled. Instead, a slice of feta was balanced atop the other ingredients; we like doing that at home, too. I also use regular cucumber rather than English cucumbers.

I just can't tell you how much I loved this salad! The only changes I made were to use a regular cucumber, omitted the green pepper and used halved cherry tomatoes and regular olives. My husband and I ate it all. I made it again the very next night and made a double batch. It's been about a week and I can't wait to make it again. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!

Lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil, and a healthy grind of salt and pepper  is all you need for this fresh salad.  I have fresh oregano growing on the porch, so I used that instead of dried.

A few small alterations: I had to substitute black olives and some shallots and green onions instead of the original ingredients, and I thought the recipe called for too much oregano for our tastes.

This seems both tasty and quite authentic. I sometimes add lettuce, or use cold pasta as well. I prefer much more feta cheese than this calls for!

I have been using this recipe for years and just got around to rating it.  It's the best Greek salad recipe I have found. Definitely need to reduce the oregano to a maximum of 1 Tablespoon.  Mix together the dressing ingredients before tossing and add some torn romaine with vegetables.  I occasionally substitute feta seasoned with basil and sun dried tomatoes for the plain feta. Nice and refreshing--a change from your traditional tossed salad.  I would recommend it!

Excellent and easy to make salad! I didn't measure the spices or oil/lemon, just eyeballed it, and also used fat-free feta instead of regular. Wonderful, fresh taste! It went well with the other foods I prepared in my Mediteranean-inspired meal last night. Looking forward to the leftovers tonight!

This salad is so refreshing.  I substituted white wine vinegar for the lemon juice since I didn't have any lemons and I didn't use any salt since the Feta and olives were salty enough.  It tasted just wonderful.

This is a pretty straight-forward recipe. I think the 2 full tbsp's of oregano is way too much. I use less than one. A great tip (especially for larger gatherings or entertaining) would be to colour the salad more. I find the cucumber and green pepper adds too much green, a much more interesting choice would be a yellow or orange bell pepper. i know they're more expensive but it makes the overall salad look great.

The salad turned out great! My husband enjoyed it so much I made it twice in one week. The dressing was delicious with a slight modification since I don’t really like oregano. I halved the amount of oregano to diminish its overpowering taste, in my opinion, and to provide enough of its flavoring effect.

This salad is great. For me, a salad dressing with a bit more zip/flavour would be better. Such as caesar, sesame ginger or a spinach salad dressing I have would be good. So I guess my rating would go to 4 1/2 stars wound be better.

Just made this for my women's  tennis team after a match.  They loved it leaving the bowl empty. I used the dressing from this site called Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing instead of the one this recipe called for.   I used the balsamic & red wine vinegar since I didn't have enough red wine.  Liked the punch it gave it.  Also added some salami and used the feta cheese with tomatoe & basil seasoning.  It will definitely be a go to salad for me.

So very simple. So very good.  Craved a good Greek Salad.  This is a definite keeper. Followed advice from several others and used less oregano. Had only crumbled, but cannot wait to serve with a slice of feta like Cassandra had in Greece.  Love this light fresh meal.  I'm thinking of adding some grilled or boiled shrimp next time instead of serving as a side.Chef SuzyQ - thanks so much

this was excellent. I've been looking for some different kinds of salads, specifically more vegetable heavy and this was perfect. I didn't have Kalamata olives and so I added pepperocini  peppers to add back in some flavor and it was wonderful.

I have made this salad according to the recipe several times now.  It is really delicious and the whole family looks forward to having this at dinner time.  I have learned to cut back on the tomatoes, because my crew leaves them behind.

We just came back from 19 days in Greece.  This salad is better than any we tasted in Greece.  We did eat at some upscale restaurants.  Don't layer, mix all ingredients.

Great!  Added chopped Romaine hearts and used greek vinagerette from a bottle (i cheated!) and brought to a party- it was gobbled up quickly.  Make sure to use good olives.

I used a mixture of yellow and red bell peppers instead of the green.  I pitted the olives using a cherry pitter which makes things much easier.  A wonderful, fresh crunchy salad!!  Do not skimp on the dried oregano.  ---It is a must have for this dish!!!!

Finally!  SOmething basic!  I might add some oregano to this, but that's it.  Thank you for offering this up, tastes just like a salad from the greek place around the corner from my apartment.  It's also nice to see someone use kalamata olives instead of nasty waxy black one, LOL! :)
