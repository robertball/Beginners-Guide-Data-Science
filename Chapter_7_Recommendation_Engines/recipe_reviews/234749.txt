I don't need gluten free, but this looked so good.  Well, it is!!!  I put a dollop of pineapple yogurt that I added some vanilla to and it was just like carrot cake.  I will make again and again.

These were a nice pancake, topped with maple syrup they were  even nicer. I had to use buckwheat flour instead of oat flour and used homemade boiled carrots instead of canned. I didn't understand if the liquid should be used or not, so I pureed the carrots with a little of their liquid, but reserved the rest. I used the carrot liquid instead of water. I think the next time I will add a bit of brown sugar to the batter. Thank you for the lovely gluten free recipe.
