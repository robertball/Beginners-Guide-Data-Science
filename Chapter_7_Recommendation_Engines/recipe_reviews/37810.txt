Pretty side dish for my tomato queen. Instead of vinaigrette I made a dressing of olive oil, garlic and parm and drizzled over. Good!

Can make a very elegant presentation dish or simply chop the tomatoes and tear the spinach leaves that are large and toss for easy serving and eating with kids.  

Used a homemade balsamic vinaigrette and drizzled much less.  Everyone enjoyed this fresh and tasty salad.
